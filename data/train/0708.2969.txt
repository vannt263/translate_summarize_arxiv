    "the quantum mechanics of a neutral atom ( na ) or a neutral particle in the magnetic field @xmath3 created by a ferromagnetic wire ( fw ) @xcite becomes a nontrivial problem when the spin @xmath4 of the neutral atom or the particle is taken into account .",
    "the interaction of the spin with the magnetic field generates a potential @xmath5 ( @xmath6 is the magnetic moment of the atom ) , which is inverse square in nature for a certain alignment of the magnetization of the wire .",
    "it is usually assumed that this system does not have any stable bound state @xcite and depending on the sign of the potential it is either unbounded in the field of the wire or it falls to the center .",
    "however , with the advance of research work on mathematical physics we now know that systems with inverse square potential in @xmath7-dimension @xcite , @xmath8-dimensions @xcite , @xmath9-dimensions @xcite and even higher dimensions @xcite provide stable bound state solutions .",
    "it has been possible to obtain bound state solutions due to the consideration of nontrivial boundary condition at the singularity of the hamiltonian .",
    "one possible way of constructing nontrivial boundary condition is to start with a very restricted boundary condition and then go for a possible sae @xcite .",
    "this method has been very successfully implemented in different branches of physics @xcite    in our present article we apply this well established method of sae to explain the quantum dynamics of a neutral atom in the background magnetic field created by a ferromagnetic wire .",
    "although the mathematical technicalities needed for this system is well know in the literature of mathematical physics , it is still not very frequently used especially in molecular physics . in our previous work",
    "we have used this same technique to explain the formation of bound state solution of polarizable neutral atom in the electric field of charged single - walled carbon nano - tube ( swnt ) @xcite .",
    "it is argued that this bound state could be a possible candidate for the smearing of the step edge of quantized conduction @xcite .",
    "the article has been organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ fw ] , we review the system of neutral atom with spin in the magnetic field of a ferromagnetic wire . due to the cylindrical symmetry ,",
    "first the free motion along @xmath10 direction has been separated out from the problem .",
    "the remaining two dimensional system has been reviewed and the radial eigenvalue equation has been constructed , which will be analyzed in the next section . in sec .",
    "[ hi ] , self - adjoint extensions ( sae ) of the radial eigenvalue equation has been made using the von neumann s method and bound state solution has been obtained .",
    "re - normalization techniques are discussed in sec .",
    "[ re ] , to handle the strong attractive , @xmath11 , inverse square potential , which may arise in our problem of neutral atom ( na ) system . in sec .",
    "[ sc ] , classical scale symmetry of the full @xmath9-dimensional problem has been discussed and the partial breaking of that classical scale symmetry due to our quantization has been shown . the consequence of the symmetry breaking is also discussed .",

    "we review here briefly about the neutral atom system in the magnetic field @xmath3 of a ferromagnetic wire .",

    "let us consider a neutral atom of mass @xmath12 moving in the magnetic field @xmath3 of a ferromagnetic wire . for the cylindrical symmetry of the system we consider the wire along the @xmath10 axis .",
    "the magnetization of the wire is considered along the @xmath13 axis .",
    "the magnetic field is confined on the @xmath13-@xmath14 plane and can be described in cylindrical coordinates @xmath15 by @xmath16 at a distance @xmath17 from the center of the wire .",
    "@xmath18 is the magnetization per unit length of the wire .",
    "the motion of the atom along @xmath10 direction is a free particle motion , given by the wave - function @xmath19 ( @xmath20 is the wave - vector along the @xmath10 direction ) .",
    "we therefore consider the @xmath8-dimensional problem on @xmath13-@xmath14 plane . in polar",
    "coordinates @xmath21 , then the time independent schrdinger equation for neutral atom system is of the form ( @xmath22 ) @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the energy eigenvalue of the neutral atom , the magnetic moment @xmath25 , @xmath26 is the spin of the atom , @xmath27 is the lande factor and @xmath28 is the bohr magneton .",
    "( [ schrodinger ] ) is completely separable and after substituting @xmath29 into the schrdinger equation ( [ schrodinger ] ) , the radial equation can be written in the following well known @xmath7-dimensional eigenvalue problem with inverse square interaction : @xmath30 where the radial hamiltonian is given by @xmath31 .",
    "the coupling constant @xmath32 of this hamiltonian @xmath33 can be obtained by solving the spin part @xcite , @xmath34\\chi=0\\ , .",

    "for strong attractive ( @xmath11 ) inverse square potential , the usual analysis of the na system will give a tower of spectrum @xcite with ground state being @xmath80 .",
    "even the self - adjointness technique @xcite also gives the ground state to be -ve infinity .",
    "this implies that the system will collapse if @xmath11 . but re - normalization technique @xcite has a remedy for this problem to give a finite ground state , thus making the problem physically realizable . in re - normalization technique ,",
    "the divergent hamiltonian is regularized with an ultraviolet cut off @xmath81 , for example consider an infinite barrier regularized potential @xmath82 where now the coupling constant depends on the ultraviolet cut off , @xmath83 .",
    "the ultraviolet cut off allows the system to sustain a well defined bound state .",
    "this can be understood form the regularized time independent schrdinger equation @xmath84 with the boundary condition that @xmath85 .",

    "we now discuss scaling symmetry and its anomaly @xcite for the full @xmath9-dimensional problem of a neutral atom in the magnetic field of a ferromagnetic wire .",
    "classically the action constructed from the hamiltonian @xmath101 is scale invariant under the scale transformation @xmath102 and @xmath103 , where @xmath104 , @xmath105 is the scale factor , @xmath106 is the time .",
    "the hamiltonian transforms as @xmath107 under the scale transformation .",
    "lagrangian constructed from this hamiltonian @xmath108 also transforms in the same way @xmath109 .",
    "so the action of our system is evidently scale invariant as stated above .",
    "the consequence of scale invariance is that the system should not have any bound state . because , the presence of bound state energy would provide a scale @xcite for the system and consequently scale invariance will break down .",
    "we have seen in our previous section that after inequivalent quantization of the hamiltonian , the use of nontrivial boundary condition gives a single bound state in the interval @xmath1 for the @xmath8-dimensional problem ( @xmath13-@xmath14 plane ) .",
    "this single bound state is however a characteristic feature of the of the inverse square potential and has been obtained in literature @xcite before .",

    "bound state energy given by ( [ eigen1 ] ) provides a scale for the @xmath8-dimensional the system , leading to  partial scaling anomaly \" .",
    "we use the term  partial scaling anomaly \" , because in the @xmath10 direction scaling symmetry is still restored even after quantization .",
    "this situation happens in other cylindrically symmetric systems also , for example the motion of a charged particle or a dipole in cosmic string background @xcite show partial scale symmetry breaking .",
    "quantum mechanically scaling transformation is associated with a scaling operator @xcite @xmath110 . for a generic element @xmath111 and for @xmath112 or @xmath113 , @xmath114 .",
    "this can be checked from the relation @xmath115 where @xmath116 is any complex number .",
    "since the action of @xmath117 on the domain @xmath70 does not keep the domain invariant , scaling symmetry is broken @xcite .",
    "but it can be shown that for @xmath118 and @xmath119 , scaling symmetry is restored @xcite even after quantization . in this case",
    "@xmath120 for more clarity on scale symmetry and its anomalous breaking we plot the ratio of @xmath121 to @xmath122 as a function of the radial variable @xmath17 for @xmath91 .",
    "note that for @xmath91 , scale symmetry is restored for @xmath123 and @xmath97 respectively . the straight line in fig .",
    "4 corresponds to @xmath123 and straight line in fig .",
    "5 corresponds to @xmath124 . on the other hand",
    "the scaling anomaly is displayed by the two curved line in fig .",
    "4 and fig . 5",
    "one can similarly discuss the scaling anomaly for the @xmath73 case from its bound state solution and its domain .",
    "it can also be noted that the two scaling symmetry points is associated with two extreme points on the energy scale for bound state of the system , one is at @xmath125 and other is at @xmath126 .     as a function of the parameter @xmath78 and @xmath39.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]",
    "in literature @xcite it is usually said that the neutral atom would not have any stable bound state under the magnetic field of a ferromagnetic wire and depending on the coupling constant @xmath32 , it will either be unbounded ( for @xmath127 ) or fall into the singularity ( for @xmath11 ) . in our work",
    "we have shown that the assumption in the literature is not true , if we allow nontrivial boundary condition to hold for the system , contrary to the result of the previous literature @xcite , where usual boundary condition has been considered .",
    "it is in fact possible to form stable bound state for the @xmath8-dimensional problem in the field of a ferromagnetic wire .",
