    "there are now several known solutions @xcite to the equations of motion of vacuum string field theory ( vsft ) @xcite .",
    "these include the sliver state @xcite and the butterfly state @xcite .",
    "the sliver state was conjectured to represent a d@xmath0-brane , and subsequent calculations of its tension based on this assumption yielded the correct brane tension .",
    "the sliver state construction was used also to build solutions corresponding to d@xmath1-branes of arbitrary dimension @xcite , and ratios of tensions were found @xcite which were in agreement with the known results from string theory .",
    "these calculations were based on a field expansion of fluctuations about the classical solution , using a tachyon field to find the brane tension .",
    "one requirement for the consistency of the interpretation of the sliver brane as a d - brane is that the equation of motion for the tachyon must be a consequence of the string field equation of motion ; an on - shell string field must correspond to an on - shell tachyon .",
    "this means that the quadratic term in the resulting tachyon action must vanish , as is the case for the sliver state.@xcite while it has already been assumed in the literature that the butterfly can be interpreted as a d - brane , this may have been premature , as the above properties had not been verified .",
    "were the tachyon field not to satisfy these requirements , it would mean that the butterfly state , although known to be a brane ( _ i.e. _  localised ) solution and a rank - one projector , could not be viewed as a d - brane .",
    "we show in the present paper that the butterfly does indeed support a tachyon field with vanishing on - shell quadratic term .",
    "we now turn our attention to the brane tension .",
    "the tension of the brane may be obtained from the cubic term in the tachyon action @xcite , and this has been completed for the case of the sliver by okawa @xcite . in that calculation , the evaluation of the cubic terms turned out to be very tedious and lengthy , and in the present case of the butterfly we find that it is much more so .",
    "thus rather than attempting a calculation of the entire cubic term , we content ourselves with motivating the procedure and conjecture how the result should obtain . in this way",
    ", we will see how the correct brane tension should arise .",
    "this paper is structured as follows . in section [ bs ]",
    "we review the geometrical construction of the butterfly state as a surface state @xcite , along with the regularisation required for any concrete calculations.@xcite we then in section [ tf ] turn to the expansion of deformations of a vsft solution @xcite . in section [ quad ]",
    "we investigate the quadratic term in the tachyon action .",
    "this surface - state calculation involves the construction of conformal mappings in order to perform star multiplication . in section [ tens ]",
    "we begin the calculation of the ratios of tensions of different butterflies , suggest how this could be completed , and comment on the preliminary results .",
    "we conclude in section [ dis ] with a discussion of surface states and the rle of regularisation and conformal invariance with respect to deformations of string fields and definition of fields .",
    "we use the geometrical , surface representation of string fields ; thus we specify states using a bpz product with an arbitrary state @xmath2 . for details of this representation and methods thereof , we refer the reader to @xcite .    the butterfly state @xmath3 is a factorisable state , so that it may be decomposed into the product of a left - string functional and a right - string functional .",
    "the surface @xmath4 , defined by @xmath5 and @xmath6 , used to define the butterfly is shown in .",
    "the butterfly , defined on the surface @xmath4 ]    the unshaded region is the local patch , @xmath8 , @xmath6 .",
    "the dashed lines which border the local patch are the left- and right - string boundaries , and the solid line is the boundary of the surface on which we impose the standard open string boundary condition . in the centre of the local patch is the puncture @xmath9 where we insert the operator @xmath10 , transformed to this coordinate system from the canonical half - disc via the mapping @xmath11 .",
    "thus the bpz product of the butterfly with the arbitrary state represented by the operator @xmath10 is @xmath12 where the combination of the mapping @xmath11 and the surface @xmath4 really only need be defined up to conformal equivalence .",
    "this is not strictly true of the states we will define in subsequent sections , due to regularisation of operator short - distance singulatities .",
    "we will also have need of the regularised butterfly @xmath13 , and we borrow the formulation from @xcite .     the regularised butterfly , defined on @xmath14    the surface @xmath15 , shown in , is obtained from @xmath4 by identifying the left and right edges , above some height @xmath16 .",
    "this is the regularisation parameter , and the limit @xmath17 will be taken to obtain the surface @xmath4 .",
    "the state is now defined by @xmath18 the regularised state @xmath13 does not satisfy the string - field equation of motion for finite @xmath16 .",
    "in @xcite an elegant proposition was made regarding both the parametrisation of string - field fluctuations by fields and the construction of states representing the coefficients of these fields .",
    "we here present this briefly , referring the reader to that paper for details .",
    "the string - field action is given by @xmath19 since the vsft operator @xmath20 is purely ghost , there are factorisable solutions @xmath21 satisfying @xmath22 as the ghost part of the solution is thought to be in some sense universal @xcite , attention has mainly been given to the matter part of the solution . from @xcite , a finite deformation of the matter solution parametrised by fields @xmath23",
    "is given by @xmath24f\\circ\\phi(p)\\right\\rangle_\\sigma , \\ ] ] where @xmath25 refers to the portion of the boundary of @xmath4 belonging to the state @xmath26 , as opposed to the reference state @xmath2 .",
    "@xmath27 are fields which parametrise the deformation , while @xmath28 are the corresponding vertex operators .",
    "the integral of such a vertex operator , which is of conformal dimension one for on - shell physical states , is thus conformally invariant .    in the case of a tachyon deformation",
    ", we have @xmath29f\\circ\\phi(p)\\right\\rangle_\\sigma .\\ ] ] expanding in powers of the tachyon field @xmath30 , we have @xmath31 where @xmath32 one must take care to regularise these states when taking bpz products , as short - distance singularities will obtain .    @xmath33 is nothing but the classical solution @xmath34 .",
    "the next term in the series is @xmath35 where the tachyon state @xmath36 is given by the intergral of the tachyon vertex operator along the boundary of the surface .",
    "the linearised equation of motion for the tachyon state is then @xmath37 it is shown in @xcite that in the case of the sliver state @xmath38 this equation is satisfied on - shell not only for the tachyon @xmath39 but for all physical string states @xmath40 . in the case of the butterfly , it is easy to see that the linearised equation of motion is satisfied .",
    "inserting the expansion into the action , the term quadratic in the tachyon field is immediately given by @xmath41 where @xmath42 consists of four pieces coming from the above four contributions ; @xmath43 in @xcite , @xmath42 was found to be identically zero in the case of the sliver state . in the following section we perform an analogous calculation for the case of the butterfly .",
    "since we wish to deal with tension in section [ tens ] , we will also need the part of the action cubic in the tachyon , given by @xmath44 where @xmath45 is a function containing contributions from each of the six terms in the action .",
    "we consider the on - shell case , and write this quantity as @xmath46 for the case of the sliver , okawa @xcite showed that the first five terms together cancel ; the cubic action is given solely by the sixth term @xmath47 and thus so is the brane tension .",
    "we will discuss the case of the butterfly in section [ tens ] .",
    "here we calculate the quadratic term in the tachyon action , and show that it vanishes on - shell . from we have four pieces .    for the term @xmath48",
    ", we use the mapping shown in to map     mapping for two - state bpz product ]    the surface obtained by gluing together two copies of @xmath15 onto a cone of circumference @xmath49 .",
    "the boundary of the first and second copies of @xmath15 will be denoted @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "they are shown in the figure as heavy dashed and solid lines . from the appendix ,",
    "the mapping is given by @xmath52 where @xmath53 , so that @xmath54 where @xmath55 denotes the sign of @xmath56 .",
    "from the previous section , we have @xmath57 where by @xmath58 we indicate that there this requires regularisation ; we see there will be short - distance singularities at @xmath59 .",
    "we thus regularise the state by leaving a gap of @xmath60 at each of these points .",
    "the limit @xmath61 will be taken at the end of the calculation . transforming to the @xmath62",
    "coordinate , we have @xmath63 where @xmath64 is a cone with opening angle @xmath49 , and @xmath65 is our regulator @xmath66 , transformed to the theta system ; @xmath67 the propagator on the boundary of the cone is given by @xmath68 and considering the on - shell case , @xmath69 , we have @xmath70 performing the integrals , we obtain @xmath71 where we have made use of the limit @xmath61 .",
    "we see that there is a finite and a divergent part to @xmath48 for finite @xmath72 , and also that there is a divergence as @xmath73 .",
    "we expect the part divergent in @xmath66 to cancel between @xmath48 and @xmath74 in , since products of @xmath75 states must be regularised at the endpoints of vertex operator integration , while the @xmath76 state contains a different , independently regularised divergence .    turning our attention now to @xmath74",
    ", we use the mapping shown in .",
    "mapping for three - state bpz product ]    we may again write @xmath77 recalling the mapping in the appendix , the relation and the derivative remain unchanged .",
    "the mapping is now to a cone of angle @xmath78 , so substituting @xmath79 into the two - point function , we may write @xmath80 again , performing the integrals , we have @xmath81 so that the combination @xmath82 is finite , but non - zero .    in order to calculate the @xmath83 and @xmath84 contributions ,",
    "greater care must be taken with the regularisation procedure .",
    "the @xmath76 state from involves the a double integral since @xmath85 but this will be divergent when @xmath86 .",
    "looking at both and , let us calculate @xmath83 and @xmath84 simultaneously .",
    "we follow okawa @xcite and regularise the double integral as @xmath87 where the @xmath88 integral is to be taken along the coutour @xmath50 from ` just after ' the beginning until the end at @xmath89 , and the @xmath90 integral is taken along the @xmath50 from the beginning at @xmath91 until ` just before ' the point @xmath88 .",
    "that is , the small quantity @xmath92 is equal to @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 and @xmath93 for each segment of @xmath50 respectively , where real @xmath93 is then the regularisation parameter . using this formulation in the @xmath62-system , we write @xmath96 where @xmath97 so that in the inner integral , the upper limit of integration depends on @xmath62 . in order to do both calculations at once ,",
    "we have introduced the constant @xmath98 ; for the cases of @xmath83 and @xmath84 , @xmath99 and @xmath100 , respectively .",
    "let us first perform the inner integral , giving @xmath101_{\\theta_3+\\epsilon_\\theta}^{\\theta_7 } .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] substituting @xmath102 from , we have @xmath103 we may now evaluate , obtaining @xmath104 we thus find the contribution @xmath105 to to be again finite and non - zero , precisely cancelling the contribution to the quadratic term .",
    "we have verified in section [ quad ] that the butterfly does indeed support a tachyon field . in order to further motivate its interpretation as a d - brane state , the brane tension",
    "should also be calculated .",
    "this was properly done for the sliver in @xcite , and we consider the same procedure here for the butterfly .",
    "we recall that the tachyon coupling constant can be identified by first canonically normalising the tachyon field using the quadratic term , and then extracting the coefficient of the cubic term .",
    "this coupling will be related to the tension , and the tension may be expressed in terms of the energy density .",
    "the cubic term in the action contains the quantity from , @xmath106 these may be calculated as follows .",
    "the three - point function on the boundary of the cone @xmath107 is given by @xmath108 in the following , as before , we imply the use of and for two- and three - state products , respectively .",
    "we use the same regularisation parameters @xmath109 and @xmath110 as in the preceding section .",
    "we begin with @xmath47 and write @xmath111 regularisation may be carried out as before , so that @xmath112 the three integrals in this case are independent , ( _ i.e. _ the integration bounds do not depend on the integration variables ) and we find that this is identical to @xmath47 in the case of the sliver , calculated in @xcite , that is @xmath113    moving on to @xmath114 and @xmath115 we may write the unregularised quantity as @xmath116 where we have written both states simultaneously using @xmath98 , as we did in section [ quad ] . we regularise as we did with @xmath117 ; @xmath118 in the @xmath62-system , this becomes @xmath119 here we are using the regulator @xmath93 just as we did in the previous section .",
    "@xmath120 may similarly be expressed as @xmath121    finally , @xmath122 and @xmath123 may be written @xmath124 which may be regularised and written as @xmath125 here , @xmath126 is a new regulator , which is used exactly as is @xmath93 in previous expressions .",
    "this means that @xmath127 , and @xmath128 ` follows the contour ' in the @xmath88-system , as explained for @xmath92 just before equation .",
    "explicit evaluation of the integrals for @xmath129 and @xmath130 in equations , and is not impossible , but very tedious .",
    "primarily this is due to the complicated dependence of the upper limits of the inner integrals on the variables of the outer integrals .",
    "we leave this evaluation for future investigation and here make some comments .",
    "we first mention that the calculation must be done for fixed , finite @xmath72 , taking the limit @xmath73 only at the very end .",
    "the @xmath131 , @xmath132 and @xmath133 limits may be considered while performing the calculation , but care must be taken to keep all divergent terms in these regulators .",
    "in addition , in individual expressions , these three limits do not always commute , and it is only at the end where the divergent parts should be seen to cancel .",
    "given that these two regulators are independent , we again expect that the combinations @xmath134 and @xmath135 will not be divergent .",
    "we also expect that combined , they contribute zero to the expression for the cubic tachyon coupling , through , leaving the tension dependent only on the term @xmath47 . finally , to calculate the tension one must calculate the overall normalisation of the quadratic term , so that it may be written canonically and the cubic term normalised appropriately .",
    "this calculation also is tedious for the case of the butterfly ; we do not undertake it here .",
    "work is in progress on the quadratic normalisation and the cubic term evaluation ; if reasonable , we intend to address the full calculation of the tension in a future publication .",
    "we have calculated the on - shell quadratic term in the tachyon action , and found that it vanishes .",
    "the structure of this calculation is the same as that for the sliver @xcite .",
    "this is compatible with the assertion that the butterfly represents a d - brane state .",
    "the tension could be calculated by following the procedure outlined in the last section , and we expect that this will also agree with the canonical value of unity for a d - brane , matching the case of the sliver .    finally , it is interesting to note that when defining surface states with operators on the boundary , such as the deformation states in equations - , the definition of the state depends on the geometry used .",
    "that is to say , although such specifications are formally conformally invariant , the necessary regularisation procedure will break this symmetry . when defined using operators requiring regularisation",
    ", conformally equivalent surfaces can correspond to different states .",
    "this information is contained in the function which maps the regulator from one coordinate system to another ; here this was the function @xmath102 which maps the regulator @xmath92 in the @xmath88-system to @xmath136 in the @xmath62-system .",
    "the author would like to thank k.  s.  viswanathan and r.  c.  rashkov for enlightening discussions , and simon fraser university for a graduate fellowship .",
    "this work was supported in part by the national sciences and engineering research council of canada .",
    "let @xmath137 be the region of the complex plane given by @xmath8 , @xmath6 .",
    "first let us construct a map from @xmath137 to itself , which transforms the boundary @xmath138 as shown in .",
    "that is , the contour given by line segments from @xmath140 down to @xmath141 , across to @xmath142 and up to @xmath143 should be mapped to the segment of the real line @xmath144 , with the rest of the boundary mapped accordingly .",
    "this map is given implicitly by the relation @xmath145 where @xmath53 .",
    "now , due to the periodicity of the functions in , this map in fact extends to      arbitrarily many copies of the surfaces , as shown in .",
    "each ` bucket ' of width @xmath146 is folded down onto the real line .",
    "we will use the map for two copies of @xmath137 for surfaces corresponding to @xmath48 and @xmath83 , and the three - copy map for @xmath74 and @xmath84 .",
    "explicitly , the map can of course be written as @xmath147 although we must be careful to note that the inverse cosine function is not single - valued .",
