    "<S> the finite - size effects in critical phenomena of a thin film system are studied from a mean field ( mf ) approach with @xmath0 model for second - order phase transition . </S>",
    "<S> the influence of boundary condition on the critical properties are emphasized . scaling functions for relative free - energy and relative specific heat capacity </S>",
    "<S> are given .    </S>",
    "<S> * pacs * numbers : 68.35.rh , 05.70.jk    -1 cm -30pt    the critical phenomena in the thermodynamic limit is characterized by the divergence of the correlation length @xmath1 near critical point . nowadays , the experimental techniques have become so advanced that the correlation length @xmath1 can be pushed up to several thousand   and the samples under study become comparable with @xmath1 . as a consequence , the effects of finite size of the samples on the critical phenomena become increasingly important . </S>",
    "<S> generally such effects depend on the shape of the sample , on the boundary condition , on the dimension of the system and on the number of components of the order parameter . </S>",
    "<S> finite - size effects near critical point have been remained to be a topic of active research over the past two decades . in fully finite or quasi - one - dimensional systems the phase transition </S>",
    "<S> is smeared out , whereas in thin films of thickness @xmath2 the critical temperature @xmath3 is shifted with respect to the bulk @xmath4 . without any doubt , detailed theoretical studies are necessary in order to understand the most important finite - size scaling structures predicted by phenomenological [ 1 ] and renormalization - group theories [ 2 ] .    </S>",
    "<S> since 1985 various perturbative approaches to calculations of finite - size scaling functions with the @xmath0 model have been developed [ 3 - 6 ] . </S>",
    "<S> all those perturbative approaches are based on the division of the free energy into a gaussian term and higher order perturbative terms . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the coupling constant with the @xmath0 model of the perturbation is not necessary small , so that the convergence of the perturbation expansion can not be ensured . </S>",
    "<S> thus some more effective approaches to the calculation are needed . </S>",
    "<S> it is clear that the random changes of the order parameter due to thermal motion should be around certain average and the fluctuations around the average are generally not too large except in the temperature region close to the critical one . if the averaged order parameter can be obtained , the fluctuations can be described as a gaussian term and small higher order terms . </S>",
    "<S> mf calculations are important . </S>",
    "<S> first of all , they furnish the lowest order approximation of the real problem , and some characteristics can be obtained from such calculations . </S>",
    "<S> the advantage of the mf approximation is that it allows a systematic discussion of the corrections to that approximation . for an infinite size system , </S>",
    "<S> such a mf calculation is quite easy and can show some features of critical phenomena . </S>",
    "<S> if the same results are used for system with finite size , thermodynamic quantities will have the same jumps as the bulk system , thus are physically unacceptable for finite size systems . </S>",
    "<S> the normal solution to that problem is with the zero - mode approximation instead of the mf approach . </S>",
    "<S> the fundamental problem in the usual mf approach when used to finite size systems , it seems to us , is that there exist boundary influences . for system with boundaries </S>",
    "<S> , one should consider the influences of the boundaries on the thermal properties near the bulk critical point . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the spatial distribution of the order parameter should be taken into account for finite size system . in the mf calculations for an infinite system , </S>",
    "<S> the gradient term has no contribution , because the system prefers a uniform distribution of order parameter . for a finite size system , </S>",
    "<S> however , the spatial distribution can not be considered as uniform any longer due to the influence of the boundary though the condition of minimum free energy would prefer a smooth distribution . </S>",
    "<S> thus the gradient term should not be ignored in the mf calculations of finite size system . when this term is taken into account for a finite size system , </S>",
    "<S> the mf calculations become much more difficult than those for the infinite system . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> mf calculations provide the base for the consideration of fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> the mf approximation is just the tree level approximation of the corresponding field theory , and corrections to mean field can be given by suitable perturbation theories . by the way </S>",
    "<S> , the calculations can be expected to give reasonable results and are very easy comparing to those in perturbation expansion . </S>",
    "<S> exact calculations show that the mf approximation becomes exact for an infinite system when the dimension @xmath5 of the system becomes very large . to the best of our knowledge </S>",
    "<S> , no such work for finite size system has ever been done yet . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we try to show some features of finite - size effects in second - order phase transition from a mf approach suitable for limited systems . for simplicity , we only consider @xmath0 model for a thin film under second - order phase transition with a one - component order parameter as an example to show the method . </S>",
    "<S> the extension to fully finite system and to the case of @xmath6-component order parameter is straightforward .    in ginzburg - landau theory of phase transition , </S>",
    "<S> the partition function for second - order phase transition is given as @xmath7    with effective hamiltonian @xmath8\\ ] ]    with @xmath9 .    in the following , </S>",
    "<S> we consider a thin film with thickness @xmath2 and assume the boundary condition for the system is of dirichlet type for simplicity . for non - homogeneous boundary conditions , similar calculations can be done . </S>",
    "<S> the mf is the configuration of @xmath10 which makes the effective hamiltonian @xmath11 minimum , or simply @xmath12 . from the point view of partition function , </S>",
    "<S> mf theory is a saddle point approximation . </S>",
    "<S> the corrections to the approximation can be considered by expanding around the saddle point . from the condition of minimum of @xmath11 </S>",
    "<S> , one gets @xmath13    with boundary condition @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> since one intends to choose the configuration of @xmath10 with @xmath11 minimum , the averaged order parameter @xmath10 should vary only in the direction of @xmath2 which will be chosen as @xmath15 direction in later discussions . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath16 , last equation has only trivial solution @xmath17 , the same as for the bulk system . </S>",
    "<S> so one needs only to discuss the case with @xmath18 . defining @xmath19 and @xmath20 </S>",
    "<S> , the last equation can be normalized as @xmath21    with @xmath22 and @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> obviously , @xmath1 is the usual correlation length and @xmath24 is mf relative to @xmath25 , the mf for the corresponding infinite system . </S>",
    "<S> apparently , eq . ( 4 ) is invariant under @xmath26 since @xmath27 correspond to the same effective hamiltonian @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> then one can assume @xmath28 in later discussions . </S>",
    "<S> last equation can be integrated as @xmath29    with @xmath30 an integral constant which , as will be shown afterward , is in the range [ 0,1/2 ] . </S>",
    "<S> it should be kept in mind that the solution of last equation should make the effective hamiltonian @xmath11 minimum . </S>",
    "<S> thus the spatial change of @xmath24 should be as slow as possible . </S>",
    "<S> due to the symmetric boundary condition , @xmath24 will reach its unique maximum at @xmath31 , where @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> let @xmath33 , the integral constant @xmath30 as a function of @xmath1 and @xmath2 can be determined through @xmath34    where @xmath35 is the first kind of complete elliptic integrals . from above expression , one can see that the integral constant @xmath30 depends not on @xmath1 and @xmath2 separately but on the combination of @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> thus it is convenient to define a reduced length of the system @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> the value of @xmath38 depends only on the nature of the substance under study . </S>",
    "<S> in fact both @xmath39 and @xmath38 are dimension - less , they are ratios between the real thickness of the film and certain characteristic lengths . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , eq . [ 4 ] can be written in terms of dimensionless variable @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> since @xmath40 should be in the interval [ 0 , 1 ] the integral constant @xmath30 should be in [ 0 , 1/2 ] . </S>",
    "<S> smaller @xmath30 corresponds to smaller reduced length @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> the behavior of @xmath30 with @xmath39 is shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 . </S>",
    "<S> a special feature appears as shown in the figure . if the reduced length @xmath41 , @xmath42 thus the maximum of the mf or averaged order parameter @xmath43 . in other words , under such condition </S>",
    "<S> the system will remain in the disordered phase despite the bulk critical point has been crossed from above . </S>",
    "<S> one should notice that what plays a role is not the real length @xmath2 of the system but the reduced one @xmath39 which depends also on the deviation from the bulk critical point . </S>",
    "<S> this shows that if the reduced length of the system is too short , either due the small size of the system or due to its closeness to the bulk critical point , the influence of the boundary will dominate . </S>",
    "<S> this result is not surprising considering the physical meaning of the correlation length @xmath1 which can be regarded as an indication of the influence range of the boundary condition . </S>",
    "<S> the minimum values of the reduced length @xmath44 , as a mathematical result , can be understood physically . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath30 is very small , the maximum of @xmath24 is also very small , so the @xmath45 term in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ aa ] ) can be neglected . </S>",
    "<S> then the solution of eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ aa ] ) is @xmath46 . as discussed above </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath24 should reach its maximum before @xmath31 , thus @xmath47 , otherwise @xmath48 . </S>",
    "<S> of course , the existence of @xmath45 term will modify the behavior of @xmath24 and make the two parts for @xmath49 and @xmath50 join together smoothly for larger @xmath39 .    </S>",
    "<S> the existence of a minimum reduced length @xmath51 is an indication of the shift of critical point for a the finite size system with respect to the bulk one . </S>",
    "<S> one can easily get the critical temperature @xmath52 at which the finite system begins to have non - zero averaged order parameter @xmath53    if the characteristic length @xmath38 of the system goes to infinity ( thus the system becomes unlimited ) , @xmath52 in last equation returns to the bulk value @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> but for small @xmath38 the shift of critical temperature will be important . specially , if @xmath54 , so that the limited system will stay in the disordered phase until the temperature becomes absolute zero . </S>",
    "<S> thus there exists a lower bound for the size of the system above which there may exist phase transition . with the increase of @xmath39 , </S>",
    "<S> the constant @xmath30 increases monotonously and saturates at 1/2 for @xmath55 . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath56 , the mf @xmath10 almost equals to the value @xmath25 except in the narrow bands near the boundaries . </S>",
    "<S> this shows that the effects of the boundary condition can be ignored for system with the reduced length @xmath57 . </S>",
    "<S> this point can be seen from the behaviors of other thermodynamic quantities .    </S>",
    "<S> the effects of the boundaries on the distribution of mf @xmath24 can also be shown from eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ aa ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> one can first normalize the film by variable transformation @xmath58 . then @xmath59    where @xmath60 is the first kind of incomplete elliptic integral . from last expression the mf @xmath24 can be solved as a function of @xmath61 and @xmath39 . due to the existence of </S>",
    "<S> minimum reduced length @xmath62 one is interested in the varying behavior of the distribution of @xmath24 verse @xmath63 . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath64=0.0625 , 0.214 , 0.328 , 0.409 , 0.863 and 10.00 the distributions of mf @xmath65 are shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 . from those figures </S>",
    "<S> one can see that the maximum value of @xmath24 increases with the increase of @xmath39 and when @xmath39 is large enough there is a plateau in the spatial distribution of @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> the larger @xmath39 , the larger the fraction of the plateau , indicating the lesser influence of the boundary condition . because of the continuous change of the distribution with the reduced length , the singularities accompanied with the infinite system are smeared , as demanded from general physical consideration . </S>",
    "<S> this can be shown from the behaviors of thermodynamical quantities .    to study the finite - size effects on free energy , define @xmath66 , which is the density of free - energy for infinite system . </S>",
    "<S> then the ratio @xmath67 between free energy of the thin film per unit thickness @xmath68 and that of the infinite counterpart per unit volume @xmath69 can be shown as @xmath70    this ratio depends only on the reduced length of the system , indicating the mutual influences of the boundaries and intrinsic thermal motions . from the saturation of @xmath71 , it is obvious that @xmath67 also saturates to 1 for @xmath72 . </S>",
    "<S> but as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 , the saturation of @xmath67 to its maximum value 1 is very slow , so to speak , the influences of the boundary condition is in force even the length scale @xmath2 of the system is over ten times larger than the correlation length @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> thus the influences of boundaries should be considered even for systems with size scale much larger than @xmath1 .    </S>",
    "<S> once the free - energy of the limited system is known , other thermal quantities can be obtained . as an example </S>",
    "<S> , one can consider the specific heat capacity . </S>",
    "<S> define @xmath73 the ratio between specific heat capacity of the limited system and that of the infinite counterpart . </S>",
    "<S> after simple algebras , one arrives at @xmath74    again this ratio @xmath73 only depends on the reduced length of the system . </S>",
    "<S> the vary of @xmath73 with the reduced length @xmath39 are shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4 . in the region of @xmath39 close to its critical value @xmath75 , </S>",
    "<S> the relative specific heat capacity increases quickly with @xmath39 , but the rate of increase slows down and finally saturates to 1 as expected .    as a summary , we have investigated the finite - size effects on critical behaviors based on a mf approach adapted for the limited system with a one - component order parameter . though the fluctuations have not been considered , </S>",
    "<S> interesting critical phenomena due to finite size of the system have been shown . </S>",
    "<S> the relative thermodynamical quantities such as the free energy and specific heat capacity with respect to those for infinite counterpart are expressed as scaling functions of the reduced length @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> it will be fruitful to study the modification to the mf results from fluctuations , which will be discussed elsewhere . </S>"
