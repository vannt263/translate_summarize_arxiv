    "strict periodicity of the hamiltonian with the laser period implies physically that the laser pulse was always on and will be on forever .",

    "as many interesting phenomena such as the ac stark effect , rabi oscillations , or stabilization against ionization @xcite is most conveniently analyzed in terms of lis , it is desirable to extract the `` floquet information '' from the real - time wavefunction `` on - the - fly '' while propagating ( or by post - processing ) it , without having to solve the floquet equation as well .",

    "fig : states1 ] for @xmath123 ) and back .",
    "note that although the calculation was performed in velocity gauge the kh ground state energy is relevant here because the floquet quasi - energies are frame- and gauge - independent .",

    "it is interesting to observe that in velocity gauge this `` arrival time '' during the pulse is independent of the energy .",
    "as the laser pulse is switched off at @xmath151 many floquet channels close .",
    "however , because electrons are still on their way from the atom to the `` virtual detector '' at @xmath140 we are able to `` measure '' the field - free photoelectron spectrum of the electrons emitted in that direction .",

    "we see that in the kh frame only those states are populated in the laser field which actually contribute to the final field - free spectrum .",

    "so far we studied mainly high - frequency phenomena where the floquet blocks are well separated on the atomic energy scale because the laser frequency exceeds the ground state ionization potential .",

    "examples are tunneling ionization and high - order ati due to rescattering of electrons @xcite . in this section",
    "we choose the so - called `` channel - closing '' ( see @xcite and references therein ) as a low - frequency phenomenon to illustrate our method .",
    "the tdse was solved for a trapezoidal pulse of frequency @xmath155 . on the energy scale of the ionization potential",

    "the calculation was performed in velocity gauge using again the potential .",
    "there is a clear down - shift of all the populated floquet levels with increasing laser amplitude .",
    "this ac stark shift is also referred to as the `` ponderomotive shift '' because the effective ionization potential is increased by @xmath157 .",
    "in fact , the energy in the photoelectron spectrum is given by = = n_1-(_0 + ) , [ closings](provided the ac stark shift of the initial state is negligible , which for atomic ground states at long wavelengths often is the case ) .",
    "@xmath158 is the initial electron energy and @xmath11 is the number of photons absorbed . in order to reach the continuum at all @xmath159 photons have to be absorbed . as the intensity , and thus @xmath157 ,",
    "is increased , more and more photons are needed for ionization . when @xmath11 photons are no longer sufficient but @xmath160 photons are needed the @xmath11-photon channel closing occurs . in the plot shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lowfrequ ] a channel closing manifests itself as a crossing of a floquet quasi - energy and the continuum threshold .",
    "now , the interesting feature in fig .  [ fig : lowfrequ ] is the zero - energy lis .",

    "[ fig : lowfrequ ] is even , and it is known that depending on the parity of the states , channel closings affect the photoelectron spectrum differently @xcite .    in our model , for the first even channel closing eight photons are needed .",

    "[ fig : lowfrequ ] .",
    "the small discrepancy is because of the ac stark shift of the initial state , neglected in .",
    "one would expect that channel closings only affect low - energy electrons because the kinetic energy of the electrons whose channel is about to close is low .",
    "hence , as the intensity is increased the yield of ati peaks at energies , say , @xmath162 should increase monotonously as well . however , near even photon channel closing there is a marked increase in the photoelectron yield at high energies @xcite . instead ,",

    "the first odd photon channel closing occurs around @xmath163 , the next even photon channel closing occurs around @xmath164 .",

    "we described a method for obtaining floquet information from real - time wavefunctions . in this approach , it is not necessary to assume strict periodicity .",
    "in fact , it is possible to follow the time - resolved floquet quasi - energies as they shift during a laser pulse .",
    "moreover , the populations of the floquet states can be determined so that especially cases where superpositions of floquet states play a role can be identified .",
    "the usefulness of the method was illustrated by several examples employing the one - dimensional pschl - teller potential with only a single field - free bound state .",
    "in particular , the origin of peaks at even harmonics of the laser frequency in an inversion - symmetric potential , avoided crossings of dressed already field - dressed states induced by a second laser , the properties of floquet states under time - periodic transformations , the emergence of invariant , observable photoelectron spectra after the laser pulse , and photoelectron enhancements at channel closings were discussed .",
