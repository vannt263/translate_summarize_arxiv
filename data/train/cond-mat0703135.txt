    "uniaxially anisotropic heisenberg antiferromagnets in an external field along the easy axis have attracted much interest , both theoretically and experimentally , due to their interesting structural and critical properties . in particular",

    "furthermore , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and  @xmath9 denote the spin components at lattice site  @xmath10 .",
    "for the three - dimensional case , early renormalization group arguments@xcite and monte carlo simulations@xcite suggested that the triple point is a bicritical point with @xmath11  symmetry . only a few years ago",
    ", this scenario has been questioned , based on high - order perturbative renormalization group calculations.@xcite it has been predicted that there may be either a first order transition , or that the tetracritical biconical @xcite fixed point , due to an intervening mixed or biconical phase in between the af and sf phases @xcite , may be stable .    in two dimensions , conflicting predictions on the nature of the triple point have been put forward recently @xcite , when analyzing the classical version of the above model with spin vectors of unit length , and the quantum version with spin  @xmath0 .",
    "indeed , in the classical case , simulational evidence for a narrow ( disordered ) phase between the af and sf phases has been presented @xcite , extending presumably down to zero temperature .",
    "@xcite on the other hand , in the quantum case , based on simulations as well , a direct transition of first order between the af and sf phases has been argued to occur at low temperatures .",
    "@xcite    obviously , experimental data have to be viewed with care because deviations from the xxz hamiltonian , eq .  ( [ eq_ham ] ) , such as crystal field anisotropies or longer - range interactions , may affect relevantly the critical behavior of the triple point.@xcite    in the following , we present results from large - scale monte carlo simulations of the xxz model on a square lattice for both the classical and the quantum variant . in the quantum monte carlo simulations , the method of the stochastic series expansion ( sse)@xcite is used , and the standard metropolis algorithm is applied for the classical case .",
    "the simulations are augmented by a ground - state analysis of the classical model , showing the significance of biconical structures .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : first we shall discuss our findings on the classical model , followed by a section on the quantum version of the xxz model .",
    "a summary concludes the paper .",
    "-plane . ]    the ground states of the classical model on a square lattice , see hamiltonian  ( [ eq_ham ] ) , can be determined exactly .",
    "the af structure is stable for magnetic fields below the critical value @xmath12 while for larger fields the sf state is energetically favorable . at   @xmath13 ,",
    "the tilt angle  @xmath14 of the sf structures , see fig .",
    "[ fig_gstate ] , is given by @xmath15 increasing the field beyond , all spins perfectly align in the @xmath16-direction .    , see ref .  .",
    "squares refer to the boundary of the sf , circles to that of the af phase .",
    "the solid line refers to the magnetic field  @xmath17 , where the probability distribution  , depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig_2dhisto ] , has been obtained . here and in the following figures error bars",
    "are shown only if the errors are larger than the symbol size and dotted lines are guides to the eye . ]    at the critical field  @xmath18 , see eq .",
    "( [ eq_hc1 ] ) , the ground state is degenerate in the af , the sf , and biconical structures , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig_gstate ] .",
    "this degeneracy in the biconical configurations , following from straightforward energy considerations , seems to have been overlooked in the previous analyses .",
    "the structures may be described by the tilt angles , @xmath19  and  @xmath20 , formed between the directions of the spins on the two sublattices of the antiferromagnet and the easy axis . for a given value of  @xmath19 , the other angle  @xmath20 is fixed by @xmath21 obviously , the biconical configurations transform the af into the sf state : the spins on the `` up - sublattice '' of the af structure , with the spins pointing into the direction of the field , may be thought of to vary from  @xmath22 to @xmath23 , while the spins on the `` down - sublattice '' vary simultaneously from  @xmath24 to  @xmath25 .",
    "accordingly , @xmath19  determines uniquely  @xmath20 and vice versa .",
    "apart from this continuous degeneracy in  @xmath19 ( or  @xmath20 ) , there is an additional rotational degeneracy of the biconical configurations in the spin components perpendicular to the easy axis , the @xmath26-components , as for the sf structure , see fig .",
    "( [ fig_gstate ] ) .",
    "these components are , of course , antiferromagnetically aligned at neighboring sites .     and  @xmath27 on neighboring sites  @xmath28 and  @xmath29 for a system of size  @xmath30 at  @xmath17 , @xmath31 , and  @xmath32 .",
    "is proportional to the gray scale .",
    "the superimposed black line depicts the relation between the two angles in the biconical ground state , see eq .",
    "( [ eq_bic ] ) . ]    to study the possible thermal relevance of the biconical structures at  @xmath33 , we performed monte carlo simulations analyzing the joint probability distribution   for having tilt angles  @xmath34 and  @xmath27 at neighboring sites , @xmath28  and  @xmath29 .",
    "for comparison with the previous studies@xcite we set  @xmath32 , leading to the phase diagram depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig_clpdiag ] .",
    "for example , fixing the field at  @xmath35 , we observed at   an ising - type transition on approach from higher temperatures and a kosterlitz - thouless - type transition on approach from the low - temperature side , extending our corresponding previous findings@xcite to even lower temperatures , and in agreement with recent results.@xcite indeed , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig_2dhisto ] , in that part of the phase diagram , being in the vicinity of the very narrow intervening , supposedly disordered phase , the joint probability   exhibits a line of local maxima following closely eq .",
    "( [ eq_bic ] ) , obtained for the ground state . that behavior is largely independent of the size of the lattices we studied .",
    "similar signatures of the biconical structures are observed in the simulations at nearby temperatures , when fixing the field at  @xmath35 , as well as in the vicinity of the entire transition region between the af and sf phases , see fig .",
    "[ fig_clpdiag ] , at higher fields and temperatures .",
    "accordingly , we tend to conclude that biconical fluctuations are dominating in the narrow intervening phase . whether that phase exists as a disordered phase down to the ground state or whether there is a stable biconical phase in two dimensions ,",
    "remain open questions , being beyond the scope of this article .",
    "note that our additional monte carlo simulations for the anisotropic xy antiferromagnet in a field on a square lattice show that the analogues of biconical structures ( the orientation of the spins being now given by the two tilt angles only ) and fluctuations play an important role near the transition regime between the af and sf phases in that case as well .",
    "in fact , eq .  ( [ eq_bic ] ) provides an excellent guidance for interpreting our simulational data similar to the ones presented in fig .",
    "and  @xmath36 .",
    "the straight solid lines denote the choices of parameters where our very extensive simulations , discussed in the text , have been performed .",
    "the arrows mark the previously@xcite suggested locations of the tricritical point  ( @xmath37 ) and the critical endpoint  ( @xmath38 ) . ]",
    "the aim of the study on the quantum version , @xmath0 , of the xxz model , eq .",
    "( [ eq_ham ] ) , has been to check the previously suggested scenario of a first - order phase transition between the af and sf phases extending up to a critical endpoint and with a tricritical point on the af phase boundary , see fig .",
    "[ fig_phdg ] .",
    "we performed quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) simulations in the framework of the stochastic series expansion ( sse)@xcite using directed loop updates  @xcite .",
    "we consider square lattices of @xmath39  sites with the linear dimension  @xmath40 ranging from  @xmath41 to  @xmath42 , employing full periodic boundary conditions . defining , as usual,@xcite a single qmc step as one diagonal update followed by the construction of several operator - loops , each individual run typically consists of  @xmath43 steps and is preceded by at least  @xmath44 steps for thermal equilibration .",
    "averages and error bars are obtained by taking into account results of several , ranging from  @xmath45 to  @xmath46 , monte carlo runs , choosing different initial configurations and random numbers . especially for large systems and low temperatures we additionally utilize the technique of parallel tempering ( or exchange monte carlo)@xcite to enable the simulated systems to overcome the large energy barriers between configurations related to different phases more frequently",
    "we typically work with a chain of @xmath47  to @xmath46  configurations in parallel which are simulated at different equally spaced temperature or magnetic field values allowing for an exchange of neighboring configurations after a constant number of qmc steps .",
    "the achieved reduction of the autocorrelation times , e.g. of the different magnetizations discussed below , amounts up to several orders of magnitude and therefore results in significantly smaller correlations between subsequent measurements which , in turn , allows for shorter simulation times .    to determine the phase diagram and to check against previous work@xcite , we calculated various physical quantities including the @xmath16-component of the total magnetization , @xmath48 and the square of the @xmath16-component of the staggered magnetization , @xmath49 ^ 2     \\quad \\text{,}\\ ] ] summing over all sites , @xmath50 and @xmath51 , of the two sublattices of the antiferromagnet",
    ". a useful quantity in studying the sf phase is the spin - stiffness  @xmath52 which is related to the change of the free - energy on imposing an infinitesimal twist on all bonds in one direction of the lattice . in qmc simulations the spin - stiffness can conveniently be measured by the fluctuations of the winding numbers  @xmath53 and  @xmath54,@xcite @xmath55 the winding numbers themselves are given by @xmath56 where  @xmath57 and  @xmath58 denote the number of operators  @xmath59 and  @xmath60 in the sse operator sequence with a bond  @xmath61 in the @xmath62-direction , @xmath63 .",
    "all data for the quantum model presented here are obtained at an anisotropy parameter of  @xmath36 to allow for comparison with previous findings@xcite . the phase diagram in the region of interest , where all three phases , the af , the sf , and the paramagnetic phase occur , is displayed in fig .",

    "the earlier study@xcite asserted a phase diagram with a tricritical point at   and a direct first - order transition between the sf and af phases below the critical endpoint at  , see fig .",
    "[ fig_phdg ] . in detail",
    "the authors identified a first - order af to paramagnetic transition at  @xmath65 by means of an analysis of the magnetization histograms  @xmath68 .",
    "we studied that case , improving the statistics and considering even larger lattice sizes . indeed , as expected for a discontinuous change of the magnetization , the histograms of finite systems are confirmed to display two distinct maxima corresponding to the ordered and the disordered phase in the vicinity of the af phase boundary ( see inset of fig .  [ fig_hist ] ) .",
    "note however , that such a two - peak structure can also be found for small systems at a continuous transition , with a single peak in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "thence , a careful finite - size analysis is needed to , possibly , discriminate the two different scenarios .",
    "we simulated lattice sizes with up to   spins adjusting the magnetic field such that coexistence of the phases , i.e. equal weight of the two peaks , is provided . as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig_hist ] the positions of the maxima as a function of the inverse system size exhibit a curvature , which becomes more pronounced for larger lattices . in contrast , in the previous analysis@xcite at the same temperature , linear dependences of the peak positions as a function of  @xmath69 had been presumed , leading to distinct two peaks in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "we conclude , that the previous claims of a first - order transition at  @xmath65 and of the existence of a tricritical point at   needs to be viewed with care . indeed , the tricritical point seems , if it exists at all , to be shifted towards lower temperatures .    in the previous work@xcite",
    "a direct transition of first order between the af and sf phases has been suggested to take place at lower temperatures , . to check this suggestion",
    "we studied the system at constant field  @xmath70 , where such a direct transition would occur , see fig .",
    "[ fig_phdg ] . calculating the expectation values of the different magnetizations as well as the corresponding histograms we obtain an estimate of the critical temperature of the af phase , .     vs. the system size  @xmath40 at  @xmath71 for the temperatures @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , and  @xmath77 ( from bottom to top ) .",
    "the straight line proportional to  @xmath78 illustrates the expected finite - size behavior close to a continuous transition of ising type . ]",
    "surprisingly , approaching the transition from the af phase , the finite - size behavior of the squared staggered magnetization  @xmath79 , being the af order parameter , is still consistent with a continuous transition in the ising universality class : as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig_stmz ] the asymptotic region is very narrow , similar to the observations in the classical model.@xcite the dependence on the system size seems to obey   right at the transition , as expected for the ising universality class.@xcite    furthermore , approaching the transition from the sf phase , an analysis of the spin - stiffness  @xmath52 at the same field value of  @xmath71 results in about the same transition temperature , .",
    "thence , there may be either a unique transition between the sf and af phases , or , as observed in the classical case , an extremely narrow intervening phase , with phase boundaries of ising and kosterlitz - thouless ( kt ) type .",
    "to determine , whether a kt transition describes the disordering of the sf phase , we check the theoretical prediction@xcite that for the infinite system the spin - stiffness is finite within the sf phase , takes on a universal value at the kt transition related to  @xmath80 by @xmath81 and discontinuously vanishes in the disordered phase . as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig_stif ] , the spin - stiffness  @xmath52 at  @xmath82 seems to be , at first sight , significantly larger than the kt - critical value given by eq .",
    "( [ eq_ktstif ] ) .",
    "indeed , in the earlier study@xcite it has been argued , based on similar observations , that there is a direct first order af to sf transition .",
    "however , the finite - size effects close to the transition deserve a careful analysis : for the kt scenario , renormalization group calculations@xcite predict the asymptotic size dependence at  @xmath83 to obey @xmath84 where  @xmath85 denotes an apriorily unknown , non - universal , parameter . by studying the quantity@xcite @xmath86 \\quad \\text { , }    \\label{eq_stifcl}\\ ] ]",
    "which , according to eqs .",
    "[ eq_ktstif ] and  [ eq_stifffs ] , converges for  @xmath87 and  @xmath83 to the value  @xmath85 at a kt transition , we obtain a rough estimate of @xmath88 .",

    "[ fig_stif ] b ) , one may conclude that the lattice sizes accessible by simulations , , seem to be too small to capture the asymptotic finite - size behavior . in any event , in case of a kt transition , the spin - stiffness  @xmath52 drops asymptotically very rapidly to its universal critical value as a function of system size , being consistent with the relatively large values for the simulated finite lattices .",
    "thus , a scenario with a kt transition between the sf and a narrow intervening disordered phase can not be ruled out by the present large - scale simulations down to temperatures as low as .     vs. temperature  @xmath91 for the different system sizes @xmath92  ( circles ) , @xmath47  ( squares ) , @xmath46  ( diamonds ) , and @xmath93  ( triangles ) .",

    "of course , it is desirable to quantify the role of biconical fluctuations in the quantum case as well .",
    "however , accessing the probability distributions of the tilt angles studied in sect .",
    "[ sec_cl ] for the quantum case is beyond the scope of the present numerical analysis .",
    "we studied the classical and quantum , @xmath0 , versions of the xxz heisenberg antiferromagnet on the square lattice in an external field along the easy axis .",
    "the model is known to display ordered af and sf as well as disordered , paramagnetic phases .",
    "here we focused attention to the region of the phase diagram near and below the temperature where the two boundary lines between the af and the sf phases and the disordered phase approach each other , meeting eventually at a triple point .",
    "we performed monte carlo simulations , augmented , in the classical case , by a ground state analysis .    in the classical version , we presented first direct evidence for the importance of biconical structures in the xxz model . indeed , such configurations do exist already as ground states at the critical field  @xmath18 , separating the af and sf phases . the interdependence of the two tilt angles , characterizing the biconical ground states , persists at finite temperatures , in the region where the narrow phase between the af and sf phases is expected to occur .",
    "indeed , the joint probability distribution of the tilt angles at neighboring sites demonstrates the thermal significance of those configurations .",
    "previous arguments on @xmath11  symmetry in that region and down to zero temperature thus have to be viewed with care .",
    "the results of the present simulations suggest that , if the biconical configurations do not lead to a stable biconical phase in two dimensions , the narrow intervening phase is a disordered phase characterized by biconical fluctuations . in this sense the `` hidden bicritical point '' at  @xmath97 may then be coined into a `` hidden tetracritical point . ''    in the quantum version , previous simulations suggested , on lowering the temperature , the existence of a tricritical point on the boundary line between the af and disordered phases , followed by a critical endpoint being the triple point of the af , sf and disordered phases , and eventually by a first - order transition between the af and sf phases at sufficiently low temperatures .",
    "the present simulations , considering larger system sizes and improved statistics , provide evidence that this scenario , if it exists at all , has to be shifted to lower temperatures than proposed before . of course , simulations on even larger lattices and lower temperatures would be desirable , but are extremely time consuming",
