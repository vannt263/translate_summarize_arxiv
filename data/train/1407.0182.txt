    "after intensive study of spin - dependent phenomena in traditional nanostructures in the last decade ,  @xcite the attention of semiconductor spintronics community is shifting now to specially designed low - symmetrical systems where more subtle spin effects can be observed .",
    "one of the most interesting structures are quantum wells ( qws ) grown in [ 110 ] direction .",
    "symmetrical ( 110 ) qws have unusual spin properties due to absence of relaxation for spin component oriented along the growth direction .",
    "indeed , the bulk inversion asymmetry ( bia ) terms in the spin - orbit hamiltonian which lead to the dyakonov - perel spin relaxation have the following form contrasted with traditional qws :  @xcite @xmath0 here we introduce crystallographic axes @xmath1 $ ] , @xmath2}$ ] , @xmath3 $ ] , @xmath4 is the bia spin - orbit constant for two dimensional electrons , @xmath5 is an angle between the wavevector @xmath6 and @xmath7 axis , @xmath8 is a cubic function of @xmath9 , and @xmath10 is the pauli matrix .",
    "the form of this hamiltonian implies that the eigenstates have a definite spin projection @xmath11 onto the growth axis @xmath12 , which results in the absence of the dyakonov - perel spin relaxation mechanism for the normal spin component .",
    "therefore the spin relaxation times in symmetrical ( 110 ) qws are very long up to hundreds of nanoseconds as it has been demonstrated experimentally .",
    "@xcite    spin relaxation can be caused by structure inversion asymmetry ( sia ) which arises from asymmetrical doping , difference of the qw barrier materials , etc .",
    "sia leads to a splitting of the electron energy spectrum due to the rashba spin - orbit interaction  @xcite @xmath13 where @xmath14 is a constant .",
    "however , there is an additional source for spin relaxation even in nominally symmetric qws . if a qw is symmetrically doped with the doping layers located at equal distances from the center of the qw , the system is symmetric only in average .",
    "there are domains of the nonzero electric field produced by non - mirror symmetric impurity distributions in the layers .",
    "the impurity electric fields result in a random spin - orbit coupling via the rashba effect because @xmath15 in each domain .",
    "the corresponding contribution to the hamiltonian is given by  @xcite @xmath16 where the rashba - term coefficient @xmath17 is coordinate dependent , and the anticommutators are defined according to @xmath18 .",
    "this term leads to a finite relaxation rate for the spin @xmath12-component .    in the other low - symmetry heterosystem ,",
    "qws grown along the [ 111 ] crystallographic direction , the bia spin - orbit terms have the following form :  @xcite @xmath19 here the @xmath6-linear contribution with a constant @xmath20 is of the same form as the sia term eq .  , and the @xmath6-cubic term has the same structure as in ( 110 ) qws .",
    "it follows from eqs .   and   that in structure - asymmetric ( 111 ) qws the @xmath6-linear terms may cancel each other if the condition @xmath21 is fulfilled ,  @xcite for a review of recent experiments see ref .   and references therein .",
    "in this situation the spin - orbit interaction hamiltonian is given by eq .   with @xmath22 , and only random spin - orbit coupling eq .",
    "can be responsible for relaxation of the spin @xmath12 component .",
    "the spin - orbit interaction can be probed in both optical and transport experiments , and the low - temperature resistance measurements in classically - weak magnetic fields serves as a powerful tool for its study .",
    "it is well known that the magnetoresistance is caused by weak localization effect consisting in the interference of electron scattering paths . in high - mobility structures",
    "the interfering paths may consist of a few ballistic parts in contrast to large diffusive trajectories typical for systems with low mobility , the so - called diffusion regime .",
    "this fact changes drastically the theoretical approach to the weak localization problem because the conductivity depends on the perpendicular magnetic field @xmath23 in the whole range of classically - weak fields until the magnetic length is smaller than the mean free path @xmath24 , i.e. up to @xmath25 , where the `` transport '' field @xmath26 ,  @xcite ( see also refs .  ) .",
    "the non - diffusive theory of weak localization has been developed for traditional ( 001 ) qws with spin - orbit splitting ,  @xcite si - based structures ,  @xcite @xmath27-type qws ,  @xcite topological insulators and graphene .",
    "@xcite exact theoretical expressions for the weak - localization induced conductivity correction allow for accurate determination of the spin - orbit splittings in various two - dimensional systems such as ingaas- , gan- and hgte - based qws .",
    "@xcite    in the presence of bia spin - orbit interaction  , the eigenstates at any wavevector @xmath6 have the spin projection @xmath11 onto the @xmath12 axis , and the interference in these two subsystems occurs independently .",
    "due to absence of spin - flip processes , the magnetoconductivity is positive in this case like in systems without spin - orbit coupling . moreover , at @xmath28 , the energy spectrum is parabolic with the origin shifted by @xmath29 in the @xmath7 direction in the @xmath6-space , where @xmath30 is the electron effective mass",
    ". therefore the conductivity correction is independent of the linear spin - orbit splitting constant @xmath4 .",
    "however , the @xmath6-cubic term changes the correction in each subband .",
    "its effect on weak localization has been taken into account in ref .",
    "but in the diffusion approximation only .    in wide asymmetrical qws sia",
    "is dominant , and the spin splitting is given by a homogeneous rashba constant @xmath31 . in this case the conductivity correction is described by the theory which has been developed in refs .   and",
    "valid for qws of any crystallographic orientation .",
    "the magnetoconductivity can be both positive or negative depending on the relation between the spin relaxation rate @xmath32 and the dephasing rate @xmath33 .    in the presence of random rashba spin - orbit interaction  , the form of magnetocoductivity",
    "strongly depends on the correlation length @xmath34 of the spin - orbit disorder . in the case of small correlation length ,",
    "@xmath35 , electrons travel ballistically along many domains with random rashba splitting .",
    "the spin - orbit interaction   results in small rotations of electron spins which can be effectively described by spin - flip processes .",
    "@xcite effect of spin - flip processes on weak localization has been considered in the classical work ref .",
    "but the magnetoconductivity has been calculated there only for diffusion regime which is not realized in high - mobility qws .",
    "an attempt to develop a theory for both ballistic and diffusion regimes has been performed in ref .   for a particular choice of the spin - flip probability form but analytical results",
    "have not been obtained . in the present work",
    "we calculate the weak localization induced magnetoresistance in the whole range of classically - weak magnetic fields in ( 110 ) qws and in ( 111 ) qws with @xmath36 .",

    "this hamiltonian is equivalent to the @xmath6-linear part of the bia hamiltonian  , therefore the @xmath12 spin component does not relax by the dyakonov - perel mechanism , and the weak - localization induced magnetoconductivity is positive .",
    "@xcite the random spin - orbit interaction   switches on spin relaxation of the @xmath12 component with the time @xmath262 twice longer than one given by eq .  .",
    "spin - orbit disorder can be responsible for a small positive part of the magnetoconductivity in the most symmetrical qw with equal bia and average sia @xmath6-linear spin - orbit splittings studied in ref .  . for developing the weak - localization theory for this case one should solve the cooperon equations with the correlator obtained from eq",
    "by the substitution @xmath263 . therefore the singlet cooperon has the same form   as in ( 110 ) qws .",
    "in contrast , three other cooperons corresponding to @xmath264 should be found from a coupled equation system   which is infinite in this case . besides",
    ", the @xmath6-cubic terms may be also important in ( 001 ) qws , the corresponding theory of weak localization is developed in ref .  .",
    "to conclude , theory of weak localization is developed for low symmetrical qws beyond the diffusion regime .",
    "we demonstrated that the @xmath6-cubic bia spin - orbit splitting suppresses the anomalous magnetoresistance in symmetrical ( 110 ) qws and in asymmetrical ( 111 ) qws with zero @xmath6-linear splitting , but it is not reduced to additional dephasing .",
    "the derived expressions are valid for a description of the magnetoconductivity in the whole range of classically weak magnetic fields .",
    "we show that the random spin - orbit coupling has a strong effect on weak localization and may result in the positive magnetoresistance even in macroscopically symmetric qws .",
    "the simple expression for the anomalous magnetoconductivity is derived which is shown to be valid at any value of the spin - flip rate and magnetic field .",
    "the effect of @xmath6-linear splitting on weak localization in the presence of spin flips is found to be reduced to renormalization of the spin flip rate without a significant effect of the additional spin - dependent phase .",
