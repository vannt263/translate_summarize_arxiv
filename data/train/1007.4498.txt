    "they define clearly the meaning of the terms `` markovian '' and `` non - markovian '' incarnations of evolution as the absence and presence respectively of the initial time in the local generator of the master equation .",
    "several manifestations of non - markovianity have been proposed recently  @xcite , where non - markovian reflections are recognized based on the departure of the evolution from strict markovianity . while an abstract framework to identify whether a given quantum dynamical channel is markovian or not has been put forth in ref .",
    "@xcite , recently breuer et .",
    "@xcite proposed a quantification based on the maximum increase of the distinguishability of two different initial quantum states over the entire dynamical evolution .",
    "evaluation of this measure , however , requires optimization of the total increase of the trace distance over all pairs of initial states .",
    "more recently  @xcite , deviations from markovianity , in terms of the specific dynamical behavior of quantum correlations  when part of an entangled system evolves under a trace preserving completely positive quantum channel  has been explored . when complete tomographic information about the dynamical map is available a necessary and sufficient condition of non - markovianity is also formulated  @xcite .",
    "all the above manifestations of non - markovianity are built mainly by identifying deviations from the characteristic property of a markovian channel  being an element of one - parameter continuous , memoryless , completely positive semigroup . in this paper",
    ", we propose _ fidelity difference _ as a non - markovian incarnation  which is yet another significant feature capturing the departure from the markovian semigroup property of evolution .",
    "we begin with the well - known kraus representation  @xcite of the reduced density matrix of the system interacting with an environment . in sec .",
    "ii we begin by recalling the known result  @xcite that if the kraus operators exhibit a small - time dependence of a particular form , the markovian master equation  known as the lindblad - gorini - kossakowski - sudarshan ( lgks )  @xcite master equation  is recovered .",
    "this observation points towards the generality of the kraus representation of the quantum evolution in subsuming both the markov and non - markov versions depending on the structure of interaction between the system and its environment .    in sec .",
    "iii , we propose to use fidelity  @xcite @xmath0 $ ] as a measure to examine the nature of propensity of the evolved density matrix @xmath1 with the earlier time density matrix @xmath2 .",
    "this offers a direct approach to the conventional view of markovianity , namely that the fidelity @xmath0 $ ] would increase from its initial value @xmath3 $ ] and approach unity asymptotically .",
    "this is thus a test , for any deviation from this behavior would reflect non - markovian incarnation .",
    "we also bring out the significance of our fidelity test in comparison with the recently proposed trace distance based quantification of non - markovianity  @xcite .    in sec .",
    "iv , we illustrate our results through some examples . here",

    "on the other hand , in the non - markovian limit , we show that the fidelity difference @xmath4-f[\\rho(0),\\rho(\\tau)]$ ] fluctuates between positive and negative values  bringing out the essence of non - markovianity .",
    "further , we observe that the fidelity @xmath6 $ ]  which corresponds to the memory of the initial state carried by the dynamically evolving state - is larger in the non - markovian limit , when compared with that in the markovian case in this model",
    ".    we also investigate another exactly known kraus representation  @xcite of the jaynes - cummings model of interaction of a qubit with the radiation field .",
    "unlike the other dynamical models discussed here , this example is exactly solvable and starts with the full hamiltonian for which the unitary evolution operator can be constructed and as such , we examine here the corresponding dynamical equations associated with both the atom and photon systems .",
    "we explore the small time behavior of the kraus operators in this model to recognize the markovianity and secondly , we identify that the fidelity difference @xmath0-f[\\rho(0),\\rho(\\tau)]$ ] of the atom , initially in an excited state , fluctuates between positive and negative values during evolution  which is a clear signature of non - markovianity .",
    "recently , chruscinski and kossakowski ( ck )  @xcite considered an interesting illustration of non - markovian dynamics of a single qubit , either through a non - local master equation with a memory kernel or equivalently via a seemingly simpler local in time equation .",
    "both the descriptions are complimentary to each other : while the non - local equation involves a time - independent memory kernel , the corresponding local approach is governed by a highly singular generator . in other words , it has been illustrated that non - markovianity manifests differently in local and non - local approaches .",
    "here we show that in this example too the fidelity diference function captures the essense of non - markovianity .",
