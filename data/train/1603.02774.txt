    "while all these interactions give about the same description of the saturation properties of symmetric nm , the hf results for asymmetric nm @xcite show that they are roughly divided into two groups that are associated with two different ( so - called _ soft _ and _ stiff _ ) behaviors of the nuclear symmetry energy at high nm densities . in the soft scenario ,",
