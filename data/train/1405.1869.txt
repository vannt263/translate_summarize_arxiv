    "it is well established that many active galactic nuclei ( agn ) may go through two or more cycles of episodic activity .",
    "this is most clearly seen in extended radio galaxies and quasars , where there may be a new pair of radio lobes with well - defined hot - spots closer to the nucleus , in addition to the more distant and diffuse , extended lobes from an earlier cycle of activity .",
    "the sources with a second pair of lobes have been classified as double - double radio galaxies ( ddrgs ) by @xcite , and their properties have been summarized by @xcite .",
    "although most ddrgs were believed initially to be giant radio sources with sizes of over about a mpc , a significant number of smaller sized ddrgs have also been identified in recent years @xcite . in most of the cases double - double radio sources",
    "are associated with galaxies but it is also possible for a quasar to appear as a radio - source exhibiting episodic activity .",
    "however , the number of ddrqs reported so far is very limited @xcite , and it is important to identify more of these to make the physical scenario of this class statistically robust .",
    "j0935@xmath00204 ( 4c02.27 ) located at the redshift of 0.65 , is one promising ddrq reported by @xcite , has a blue - continuum dominated spectrum , with projected linear sizes of 70 and 470 kpc for the inner and outer radio lobes respectively .",
    "although in optical surveys , the widely popular `` color selection technique '' already identified a large number of quasars having blue - continuum dominated spectra , recent studies found a huge dust accumulation around many new similar objects which make them optically redder @xcite .",
    "these red quasars are usually believed to represent an early stage of agn evolution , which is going through a merging process leading to presence of large amounts of gas and dust @xcite .",
    "based on only radio structural information @xcite classified 811,117 radio sources or entries from the first ( faint images of the radio sky at twenty - cm ; @xcite ) survey into different categories and listed 242 sources as candidate ddrgs .",
    "further detailed investigation of these sources along with optical data from sdss and dss catalogues showed only 23 of these sources to be promising examples of ddrgs @xcite .",
    "in this paper we report the discovery of a red ddrq j0746 + 4526 , discuss some of its properties and also compare these with j0935@xmath00204 .",
    "j0746@xmath04526 which was classified from this survey to show evidence of episodic activity , has been identified as a quasar at a redshift 0.55021@xmath10.00005 in data release 9 of sdss .",
    "however , to confirm that neither of the inner compact components is a compact flat - spectrum nuclear component , as appeared to be the case in many of the candidate ddrgs identified by @xcite , we observed this source with the giant metrewave radio telescope ( gmrt ) at 607 mhz .",
    "we present the results of these observations of j0746@xmath04526 , which confirm the source to be a ddrq , and then discuss the nature of the source using the results of our observations and archival first data at radio wavelengths , and optical data from sdss . the observations and radio data reduction procedures",

    "the optical analysis is based on archival spectra obtained from the sdss dr9 catalog for both the ddrqs j0746 + 4526 and j0935 + 0204 .",
    "the galactic reddening @xmath22 , adopted from the nasa extragalactic database ( ned ) , towards j0746 + 4526 and j0935 + 0204 are respectively 0.056 and 0.042 mag .",
    "the galactic extinction and redshift corrected optical spectrum of j0746 + 4526 is presented in figure [ spec_com ] , along with the spectrum of j0935 + 0204 .",
    "the spectrum of j0935 + 0204 is similar to the typical spectra of normal quasars , while the spectrum of j0746 + 4526 is typical of red quasars . for both quasars , the [ ]  lines at @xmath234960  and",
    "@xmath235008  associated with the narrow - line - region ( nlr ) clouds , are quite prominent , while there is a striking difference in the strength of the hydrogen balmer lines which are weaker in j0746 + 4526 .",
    "it should be noted that the spectra of both the quasars are of moderate signal to noise ratio ( s / n ) . for j0746 + 4526 and j0935 + 0204",
    "it is @xmath1813.6 and @xmath1826.5 respectively , measured around mid portion of the sdss spectral range coverage .",
    "we have estimated the reddening for the object j0746 + 4526 in two different ways .",
    "first we use the empirical relation , developed from the study of spectra of nearby supernovae , between the width of the d absorption dip and the host reddening .",
    "this has been used widely to determine the host galaxy extinction directly from the observed spectrum .",
    "the presence of the d lines ( @xmath245890 , 5896 ) in the spectrum of j0746 + 4526 , for which we obtain an equivalent width of 3.45  , enables us to estimate the plausible host extinction directly from the observed spectrum . using the relation prescribed by @xcite , this corresponds to a host reddening of approximately 0.54 mag . on the other hand , according to the relation proposed by , the reddening of the host is @xmath25 mag .",
    "we therefore assume that the mean host reddening along the line of sight is @xmath26 mag .",
    "we have alternatively estimated the amount of foreground extinction by comparing the de - reddened spectrum of j0746 + 4526 with an appropriate template ( composite spectrum obtained from @xcite ) .",
    "to do so we have adopted the small magellanic cloud extinction curve , and we have de - reddened our observed spectrum by considering dust distributed in front of the qso in a uniform screen geometry .",
    "we have searched for the best value of the color excess that minimizes the differences between the template and our qso spectrum .",
    "we find that the host reddening is @xmath18 0.79 mag .",
    "this result is consistent with the result obtained from the d absorption dip .",
    "this is also consistent with the typical reddening ( @xmath27 mag ) determined for the red quasars @xcite .",
    "the widths of several spectral lines which are presumed to be generated near the central region of the agn ( like @xmath232800  and h balmer lines ) are widely different for two interesting objects . for j0746 + 4526 ,",
    "fwhm of @xmath232800  is @xmath18 35.22 , whereas for j0935 + 0204 it is about 61.33  @xcite .",
    "these demonstrate that the velocity dispersions of several broad - line - region ( blr ) clouds are much higher for j0935@xmath00204 in comparison to that for j0746 + 4526 and further indicate that the former galaxy hosts a higher mass central black hole than the latter one .",
    "`` reverberation mapping '' ( rm ) or `` echo mapping '' has proven to be a viable technique to measure the location of the line emitting clouds and the black hole mass @xcite .",
    "a major drawback with rm is that for a single system it requires a long - term monitoring programme to measure the time gap between continuum and the broad line variability . to measure the black hole mass of this ddrq we follow an indirect technique of virial single - epoch method which is an approximation to the reverberation mapping method @xcite .",
    "it exploits the empirical power - law correlation between the size of the blr and the agn continuum luminosity ( r@xmath28 @xmath29 @xmath30 ; with @xmath31 0.5 ) , as expected from photoionization model predictions @xcite .",
    "the best calibration values for the single epoch mass measurement scaling relations are available for the  line , as it is the basis for the majority of reverberation mapping programmes .",
    "however , the similar r@xmath28-l relationship is also frequently employed to measure the bh mass using the  and lines .",
    "the redshifts of these ddrqs are such that only the @xmath32  and  @xmath33  lines fall in the wavelength range of the observed spectra .",
    "we note that the  and emission features are prominent in the spectrum of j0935 + 0204 , whereas for j0746 + 4526 the  line is clearly seen ( although weaker ) and the emission line is barely seen ( see figure [ spec_com ] ) . therefore , to determine the black hole mass of j0746 + 4526 , we have used the  emission line , whereas for j0935 + 0204 , @xcite used both the  and  emission lines .    according to the @xcite ( followed by @xcite ) ,",
    "the fwhm of the  emission line of a quasar spectrum is related to its black hole mass by the following scaling formula : @xmath34^{0.5 }   \\left[\\frac{{\\text{fwhm}}_{\\text{{\\ion{mg}{ii}}}}}{1000~{\\text{km}}\\,{\\text{s}}^{-1}}\\right]^2 \\label{eq1}\\ ] ] where @xmath35 is the monochromatic luminosity at 3000 .",
    "the  feature of j0746 + 4526 spectrum has been fitted with multiple gaussian functions along with a power - law continuum and underlying uv features have been obtained from the templates of nearby qsos @xcite . in gaussian profile",
    "fits , our initial guess consists of two gaussian components for each line of the  doublet .",
    "however , if one of the components becomes statistically insignificant the procedure automatically drops it during the fit @xcite . in our two component gaussian profile fits , width of each component ( narrow / broad ) of  2796  were tied to the respective components of the mgii 2803 line . here",
    "broad and narrow components represent the  emission associated with blr and nlr clouds respectively .",
    "the width of the broad components are set to be greater than 2000 whereas those for the narrow components are constrained to be less than 1000 .",
    "in addition , we have constrained the width of the broader  component to be the same as the width of uv  emission line in this region .",
    "the fitting has been done in an iterative way , minimizing the reduced @xmath36 to @xmath37 .",
    "our final spectral fitting in the uv region is shown in figure [ j0746_mgii ] .",
    "absence of the narrow  features in this fitting process probably indicates that no ( or very negligible ) emissions are produced by the nlr clouds associated with j0746 + 4526 .",
    "the contribution of the underlying  features is also very small .",
    "the fwhm of the broad components , obtained from the fitting , is 35.22@xmath10.1  .",
    "this corresponds to a bh mass of @xmath38 , where the error has been estimated after propagating the errors associated with flux estimation at 3000   and fwhm estimation of  line in a quadrature .",
    "this value is about one order smaller than the bh mass estimated for j0935@xmath00204 ( @xmath39  from  fit ; @xcite ) .",
    "the eddington ratio has been computed from the relation @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the bolometric luminosity and @xmath42 is the eddington luminosity @xcite . for j0746@xmath04526 ,",
    "the computed values of @xmath41 and @xmath42 are respectively @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "this implies for j0746@xmath04526 , the eddington ratio @xmath18 0.03 , which is consistent with that of j0935@xmath00204 ( @xmath18 0.06 calculated from profiles ; @xcite ) .",
    "in this paper we have presented a radio and optical spectroscopic study of the ddrq j0746@xmath04526 .",
    "both gmrt and first images of this object show that there have been two episodes of activity .",
    "the diffuse emission of the outer double is well beyond both the hotspots of the inner lobes .",
    "the steeper spectral indices of the outer lobes suggest that these are due to older emission .",
    "the lobes of the outer double are significantly more asymmetric in flux density than the inner ones",
    ". the core emission is not detected at either 1400 or 607 mhz .",
    "this is in contrast with the ddrq j0935@xmath00204 , where a prominent core has been detected at both frequencies .",
    "although higher resolution observations at higher frequencies would be required to estimate the core flux density reliably , non - detection of a core in j0746@xmath04526 is consistent with a larger angle of inclination of this source to the line of sight @xcite .",
    "although the projected linear size of j0746@xmath04526 is larger than that of j0935@xmath00204 , both are of frii type , lobe dominated ddrqs and highly asymmetric in flux density .",
    "j0935@xmath00204 has a bright hotspot in the south - western outer lobe .",
    "this feature indicates that , for this source , the time scale of episodic activity is less than a few myr @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , both the outer lobes of j0746@xmath04526 do not show any hot - spots , and a more detailed multi - frequency study would be required to estimate its ages .",
    "j0746 + 4526 and j0935 + 0204 are two quasars where recurrent jet activity has been observed .",
    "the optical spectrum of j0935 + 0204 shows a blue continuum dominated spectrum , similar to most quasars , whereas that of j0746 + 4526 shows evidence of more extinction and obscuration , similar to that of red quasars .",
    "significant populations of obscured red quasars have been reported in recent studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these findings demonstrate that possibly some different mechanism rather than the orientation of the torus is responsible for large obscuration .",
    "in particular , the large extinction in red quasars is probably related to significant dust extinction in the host galaxies .",
    "the fact that , out of the two known ddrqs , one is a red quasar is an interesting result . as large dust extinction",
    "is often related to massive starbursts and galaxy merging , it suggests that galaxy merging can not only trigger powerful agn activity but that it can also trigger the interruption and restarting of jet formation .",
    "in other words , this result plausibly supports the merger - driven scenario for ddrg formation @xcite . in order to test",
    "whether this mechanism is the main scenario for ddrg formation , a larger sample of ddrgs needs to be investigated and compared with the global agn population . the present paper , which presents the first discovery of a red quasar with recurrent jet activity , is only the first step towards a larger investigation .",
    "the bh masses of giant and small - sized radio quasars , measured from emission lines typically belong to the range @xmath45 and @xmath46 respectively @xcite . for j0746 + 4526 ,",
    "the bh mass estimated using the  line is smaller than that of j0935 + 0204 .",
    "however their accretion rates are comparable . although @xcite suggested that larger mass bhs are associated with smaller accretion rates , this does not persist for all types of quasars ( e.g. , j2335@xmath130927 , j1623@xmath03419 , j1433@xmath03209 ; @xcite ) .",
    "hence it appears that the bh mass and accretion rates of these ddrqs are quite similar to other quasars .",
    "the discovery of a new ddrq underlines the importance of identifying more such objects to study the properties of these objects at different wavelengths to estimate time scales of episodic activity , and properties of host galaxies and their environments to understand the triggering mechanisms for jet activity .",
