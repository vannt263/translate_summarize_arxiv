    "one approach  @xciteto quantum yang - mills on a riemann surface of genus @xmath1 requires rewriting the yang - mills action in terms of the energy of a @xmath2-tuple of paths in the symmetry group @xmath3 ( this assumes @xmath4 . for @xmath5 ,",
    "the energy is that of a based loop in @xmath3 . )",
    "the energy of such paths appears more recently in yang - mills inequalities sengupta has developed  @xcite .",
    "sengupta considers the space of smooth connections , grouped into subspaces by certain requirements on holonomy . for each subspace",
    ", there is a loop in @xmath3 whose energy bounds from below the yang - mills action on that subspace . for appropriate choices of the requirements on holonomies ,",
    "this lower bound can be saturated ; yang - mills connections are precisely those which saturate this bound .",
    "uhlenbeck  @xcite has shown that , in two dimensions , the space of connections whose yang - mills action is finite contains discontinuous connections .",
    "theorem  [ inequality ] below provides a lower bound for the yang - mills action on this larger space .",
    "it is analogous to sengupta s , but in this space the bound can always be saturated .",
    "one might then suppose that yang - mills connections arise when these saturating connections are also smooth ; this is the import of proposition  [ relation ] .",
    "these relations between the yang - mills action and the energy of paths may help answer a question raised in atiyah and bott s seminal work  @xcite on the topology of the moduli space of yang - mills connections ; namely , does the yang - mills action , which they show to be equivariantly perfect , in fact define a morse stratification ?",
    "theorem  [ equiv ] describes the correspondence between the critical sets of the yang - mills action and those of the energy on the relevant space of paths , for which there is reason to believe the analytic issues are more tractable .",
    "to describe the required energy requires some background on the structure of the quotient @xmath6 of the space of connections modulo gauge transformations . here",
    "@xmath7 refers to connections with finite total curvature on a given @xmath3-bundle @xmath8 over a riemann surface @xmath9 , and @xmath10 refers to the space of gauge transformations which are the identity at a specified point @xmath11 .",
    "what follows is an overview of the essential elements ; details are in the references  @xcite .",
    "let @xmath12 , a regular @xmath13-gon be a fundamental domain for @xmath9 , chosen so that @xmath14 corresponds to the center of @xmath12 .",
    "the edges making up @xmath15 represent the generators @xmath16 of @xmath17 , and are identified in pairs , with opposite orientations , as in figure 1 .",
    "theorem 3.1 of  @xcite states that @xmath6 is itself a principal fiber bundle over @xmath18 with an affine - linear fiber . here",
    "@xmath18 is the space of @xmath2-tuples of paths in @xmath3 subject to a single relation on the @xmath13 endpoint values of the paths .",
    "there is an obvious energy function ( see eq  [ energy ] ) on this base space @xmath18 ; its critical points are are precisely the images of yang - mills connections . to understand how this arises",
    ", it will suffice to examine the projection @xmath19 .",
    "consider holonomies by a given connection @xmath20 about the following loops in @xmath9 : pick polar coordinates @xmath21 on @xmath12 centered at @xmath14 .",
    "for a given point @xmath22 of the edge @xmath23 , the radial path from @xmath14 to that point followed by the radial path back to @xmath14 from the corresponding point @xmath24 of @xmath25 defines a loop in @xmath9 .",
    "see figure 2 .",
    "relative to a fixed choice of basepoint in the fiber over @xmath14 , the holonomy by @xmath20 about this loop determines an element of @xmath3 .",
    "now , let the point @xmath22 vary within @xmath26 .",
    "the corresponding holonomies trace out a path @xmath27 in @xmath3 .",
    "holonomies about radial paths through the points of the other edges @xmath28 similarly determine paths @xmath29 .",
    "taken together , these define the @xmath2-tuple @xmath30 .",
    "these @xmath2 paths are not completely independent of each other , however , as the radii to the vertices of @xmath15 each lie on two distinct loops in @xmath9 whose holonomies define the endpoint values of distinct paths in @xmath3 .",
    "in fact , traversing , in the appropriate order , each such radius out to the vertex and back again to @xmath14 gives a certain product of the endpoint values of the paths in @xmath31 . on the other hand , by construction",
    ", the holonomy about this path must be the identity in @xmath3 .",
    "equating these gives the relation defining @xmath18 : @xmath32    define @xmath33 ) \\equiv \\vec{\\gamma}_{\\ !",
    "this is well - defined on @xmath6 , since acting on @xmath20 by an element of @xmath34 has no effect on @xmath31 . clearly , adding to @xmath20 a lie - algebra - valued one - form @xmath35 which vanishes in the radial directions of @xmath12",
    "also has no effect on @xmath31 .",
    "in fact , in @xmath6 , as a bundle over @xmath18 , the fiber over @xmath31 is the space @xmath36 : { \\left}. \\tau { \\right}|_{{\\scriptstyle \\mbox{radii } } } = 0\\}$ ] .",
    "this , and the fact that @xmath37 is onto , is proven in theorem  3.1 of  @xcite .    if the bundle @xmath8 is not topologically trivial , then , as detailed in  @xcite , its topology is determined by an element @xmath38 of the center of the universal cover @xmath39 of @xmath3 . on lifting @xmath8 to a @xmath40-bundle , the space @xmath18 is replaced by the corresponding space for @xmath39 with the relation @xmath41 . henceforth ,",
    "though we omit the hats , we assume we are on the lifted bundle with the corresponding relation .",
    "consider now the restriction of the yang - mills action on @xmath42 to the fiber through @xmath31 .",
    "@xmath43 ) = { \\left } < f_{a } ,   f_{a } { \\right}>,\\ ] ] where the inner product combines the invariant inner product on the lie algebra , the metric - induced inner product on forms at each point and integration over @xmath9 . along the fiber , @xmath44 , since the term quadratic in @xmath35 vanishes .",

    "note that @xmath48 $ ] defines a section of @xmath6 over @xmath18 .",
    "relative to this choice of origin , @xmath49 ) = s([\\tilde{a } ] ) + { \\left } < d_{\\ !",

    "the key point is that @xmath51)$ ] pulls back to the energy of @xmath31 .",
    "this follows from the condition on @xmath52 which implies directly that @xmath53 is covariantly constant along radii .",
    "thus , in @xmath51 ) = { \\left } < f_{\\tilde{a } } ,   f_{\\tilde{a } } { \\right}>$ ] , @xmath52 may replaced by its average along the radius .",
    "this , however , by a non - abelian analog of stoke s theorem , or by polyakov s formula , is @xmath54 ( or @xmath55 ) for some @xmath56 depending on the value of @xmath57 .",
    "in fact , for an appropriate choice of parametrization , determined by the area element on @xmath9 , @xmath58 ) = \\frac{1}{2 } \\sum_{i=1}^{2g}\\| \\dot{\\gamma}_i \\|^2 \\equiv e(\\vec{\\gamma}_{\\ ! a } ) ,               \\label{energy}\\ ] ] as detailed in section  5.1 of  @xcite . here",
    "@xmath59 denotes the @xmath56th component of @xmath60 . for a generic connection , which must be gauge equivalent to @xmath61 ,",
    "eq  [ action1 ] thus becomes @xmath49 ) = e(\\vec{\\gamma}_{\\ !",

    "a}\\tau ,   d_{\\ !",
    "a}\\tau { \\right } >        \\label{action}\\ ] ] it leads immediately to a lower bound on the yang - mills action on a given fiber :    for any connection @xmath20 representing an element of the fiber through @xmath62 , [ inequality ] @xmath43 ) \\geq \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{i=1}^{2g}\\|\\gamma_i\\|^2,\\ ] ] with equality holding iff @xmath20 agrees with the section @xmath47 ( up to gauge transformation ) .",
    "this is an immediate consequence of eq  [ action ] , since the second term on the right - hand side is positive semi - definite , and zero iff @xmath63 .",
    "given this decomposition of the yang - mills action , it is easy to see how its critical points correspond directly to critical points of the energy @xmath64 .",
    "[ equiv ] the connection @xmath47 represents a yang - mills critical point iff @xmath65 is a critical point of the energy @xmath64 .",
    "suppose @xmath66 is a yang - mills critical point ; that is , a point at which @xmath67)$ ] is stationary .",
    "( there is no loss of generality in omitting a possible gauge transformation on one side of this equation . ) by considering just @xmath35 of the form @xmath68 , for @xmath69 , it is clear from eq  [ action ] that @xmath63 is a necessary condition for @xmath20 to be a critical point .",
    "it then follows that @xmath31 must be a critical point of the energy .",
    "the converse is immediate .    to relate this picture , in which connections need not be smooth and the energy bound",
    "can always be saturated , to sengupta s , in which connections must be smooth and the energy bound can only be saturated on the fibers containing yang - mills connections , note that in the fibers over critical points of the energy the connection @xmath47 is smooth .",
    "[ relation ] if @xmath70 is a critical point of @xmath64 , then the corresponding @xmath47 is smooth .",
    "a simple calculus of variations computation shows that @xmath70 extremizes @xmath64 iff @xmath71 on the other hand , this condition also ensures that the covariantly constant curvatures @xmath52 , related by the non - abelian analog of stokes theorem mentioned previously , are continuous at @xmath14 .",
    "this was the only place @xmath47 might have failed to be smooth .",
    "atiyah and bott suggest equivariant morse theory might apply to the cohomology of the yang - mills moduli space , and , more particularly , their stratification may correspond to the morse stratification for the yang - mills action . with this in mind , they prove the yang - mills action is an equivariantly perfect morse function .",
    "however , analytic concerns prevent them from developing the theory more fully , except in genus zero .",
    "there bott and samuelson  @xcite have shown that @xmath72 is topologically equivalent to based loops in @xmath3 , and that morse theory arguments go through for a wide variety of symmetric spaces including these based loops .",
    "the geometric picture of @xmath6 as an affine - linear bundle shows it is topologically equivalent to its base space @xmath18 . passing from @xmath10 to @xmath73 ,",
    "this becomes @xmath74 , where a given element @xmath75 acts adjointly on each path : @xmath76 .",
    "moreover eq  [ action ] says the section @xmath48 $ ] pulls the yang - mills action back to the energy on @xmath74 .",
    "clearly , the morse theory for this base space , if such exists , would be the morse theory for @xmath0 .",
    "moreover , the generality of bott and samuelson s results is nearly sufficient to apply them directly to @xmath74 .",
    "the endpoint condition , however , requires careful treatment , which we defer to future work ."
