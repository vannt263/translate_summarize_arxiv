    "it is generally believed that stars do not form in isolation , although the clusters and associations in which they form are subject to disruption by a combination of internal ( e.g. winds and supernovae ) and external ( e.g. interactions with giant molecular clouds ) processes .",
    "evidence that most clusters are short - lived comes from studies of the disks of nearby galaxies , which reveal that the majority of stars belong to the so - called ` field ' ( e.g. silva - villa & larsen 2011 ) .",
    "while a few clusters in disk environments survive their first few myr , the pace of cluster disruption continues at a rapid pace , with a destruction rate of roughly an order of magnitude per decade in age for systems older than 10 myr ( fall & chandar 2012 ) .",
    "young star clusters at large galactocentric radii ( r@xmath1 ) are of interest as they probe evolution in an environment that is systematically different from the solar neighborhood",
    ". the relatively low density of the outer galactic disk will affect the pace of cluster evolution that is driven by external processes , with the result that internal processes may play a larger role in the structural evolution of clusters at large r@xmath1 than in the solar neighborhood .",
    "in addition , the metallicity of young objects tends to drop with increasing r@xmath1 , and a lower metallicity may allow protostars in outer disk clusters to accrete material for longer periods of time than in the solar neighborhood , thereby altering the stellar mf near what will eventually become the bottom of the ms ( e.g. de marchi et al .",
    "finally , if galactic disks form from the inside - out then clusters that are dissolving near the periphery of the present day disk may be contributing a significant fraction of the local field star component  studies of such clusters might then yield insights into the assembly of the field star population at large r@xmath1 .    in the present paper ,",
    "images corrected for atmospheric distortions by the gemini south muti - conjugate adaptive optics system ( gems ) and recorded with the gemini south adaptive optics imager ( gsaoi ) are used to probe the near - infrared photometric properties and spatial distributions of ms stars and pms objects in three young clusters in the outer galaxy : haffner 17 , ngc 2401 , and ngc 3105 .",
    "these clusters were selected for this program based on their ( 1 ) location outside of the solar circle , ( 2 ) age ( @xmath2 gyr ) , ( 3 ) distance ( @xmath3 a few kpc ) , and ( 4 ) angular size ( r@xmath4 arcmin ) .",
    "near - infrared observations of these clusters are of interest since they are at low galactic latitude , and so they may be subject to significant amounts of extinction .",
    "the high angular resolution delivered by gems is useful for overcoming the crowding that might be an issue at faint magnitudes while also allowing wide binary systems to be resolved .",
    "the latter are of interest as the binary frequency in a cluster provides insights into its dynamical state and the population of isolated low mass objects that will ultimately find their way into the field ( e.g. marks & kroupa 2011 ) .",
    "the ages , distance moduli ( @xmath5 ) , and reddenings of the clusters , taken from the august 2013 version of the webda ( mermilliod 1995 ) database , are listed in table 1 .",
    "also listed are @xmath6 magnitudes and radii obtained from 2mass images .",
    "the magnitudes and radii are total values estimated from growth curves , and the integrated magnitudes of all three clusters are subject to significant sources of uncertainty .",
    "ngc 2401 is a diffuse cluster , and its total brightness is susceptible to subtle variations in the sky background in the 2mass images . as for haffner 17 and ngc 3105 ,",
    "the integrated brightnesses of both clusters are affected by bright stars near the cluster centers . in the case of ngc 3105",
    "the total @xmath6 magnitude drops by 2.1 magnitudes if the light from the two brightest stars is excluded .    in the only published photometric study of haffner 17 , pedredos ( 2000 )",
    "used @xmath7 ccd measurements to find @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and an age of 50 myr .",
    "comparisons with isochrones lead pedredos ( 2000 ) to suggest that haffner 17 may have a super - solar metallicity , although this is based on two red stars that may or may not be cluster members . if this metallicity is verified spectroscopically then haffner 17 would be a rare example of a young metal - rich cluster at large r@xmath1 .",
    "ngc 2401 has been the subject of three recent studies that have yielded a range of ages .",
    "sujatha et al .",
    "( 2004 ) present a cmd that shows a well - defined ms turn - off ( msto ) and numerous candidate evolved stars .",
    "they find an age of 0.1 gyr , a distance of 3.5 kpc , and @xmath10 .",
    "in contrast , baume et al . (",
    "2006 ) measure an age of 25 myr , a distance of @xmath11 kpc , and e@xmath12 .",
    "significantly , baume et al .",
    "( 2006 ) also detect a population of possible pms objects with @xmath13 , and a be star that may be a cluster member  both of these findings are consistent with a younger age than found by sujatha et al .",
    "most recently , hasegawa et al .",
    "( 2008 ) find a distance of 5.6 kpc for ngc 2401 , with an age of 0.1 gyr and @xmath14 , which corresponds to @xmath15 . a curious aspect of the hasegawa et al .",
    "( 2008 ) study is that the isochrones in their figure 2 do not match the cmd near the msto , in the sense that there are blue stars with ms - like colors that form a well - defined sequence above the msto of the 100 myr isochrone .",
    "if these blue stars are actual members of ngc 2401 and define the msto , as opposed to blue stragglers or field stars with fortuitous photometric properties , then the age estimated for ngc 2401 by hasegawa et al .",
    "( 2008 ) is too old .",
    "ngc 3105 has one of the largest r@xmath1 of any young cluster yet discovered in the galactic disk .",
    "early studies by moffat & pim fitzgerald ( 1974 ) and pim fitzgerald et al .",
    "( 1977 ) found evidence of numerous be stars and supergiants , pointing to a young age .",
    "sagar et al . (",
    "2001 ) measured @xmath16 , a distance of @xmath17 mpc , and an age of @xmath18 myr .",
    "more recently , paunzen et al .",
    "( 2005 ) found @xmath19 , a distance of @xmath20 kpc , and an age log(t)@xmath21 ( i.e. t@xmath22 myr ) .",
    "the data discussed here are used to examine the @xmath0 cmds of the clusters , with specific emphasis on the magnitude interval that contains pms objects and the the lower reaches of the ms .",
    "the ages of young clusters can be estimated using the brightness of the ms cut - off ( msco ) and the position of the pms sequence on the cmd . assuming a standard mf then this part of the cmd is less susceptible to the stochastic effects that can affect the properties of the more massive cluster members that define the msto .",
    "insights can also be gleaned into the dynamical state of the clusters and  possibly  their early evolution by examining the @xmath6 luminosity function ( lf ) and spatial distributions on the sky of their component stars .",
    "the observations are summarized in section 2 , while the reduction of the data and the techniques used to make the photometric measurements are discussed in section 3 .",
    "the cmds are presented and examined in section 4 , while the lfs and spatial distributions of stars within the clusters are the subjects of sections 5 and 6 .",
    "the paper closes in section 7 with a discussion and summary of the results .",
    "the data were recorded in january and february 2013 as part of program gs-2012b - sv-409 .",
    "details of the observations are summarized in table 2 .",
    "this program utilized two new gemini capabilities  the gems adaptive optics system and the gsaoi  and these are briefly described below .",
    "gems ( rigaut et al . 2012 ; neichel et al .",
    "2012 ) is the facility adaptive optics ( ao ) system on gemini south .",
    "gems monitors wavefront distortions using information provided by five laser guide stars , up to three natural guide stars ( ngss ) , and an on - detector guide source .",
    "the result is a seeing - corrected signal that covers a much larger angular area on the sky than is delivered by  say  a single beacon ao system that is conjugated to the telescope primary mirror .",
    "the brightnesses and locations of the ngss in the gems field play a key role in determining the degree of correction and the angular stability of the point spread function ( psf ) . in sparse stellar environments",
    "the choice of ngss may be problematic , with selection based on the few available objects that are bright enough to serve as ngss .",
    "fortunately , the rich population of bright cluster members and field stars provided a number of potential ngss for the present program .",
    "three ngss that defined a more - or - less equilatoral triangle - shaped asterism were identified for each cluster , and * the mean @xmath23 magnitudes of these , @xmath24 , are listed in table 2 . * while the degree of correction and the stability of the psf across the field depends on a number of factors , such as guide star brightness and the atmospheric conditions in the dominant turbulent layers , an equilatoral triangle - shaped asterism should deliver a near - optimum level of psf uniformity across the gsaoi field .",
    "the wavefront - corrected beam from gems was imaged by gsaoi ( mcgregor et al . 2004 ; carrasco et al . 2012 ) , which was designed specifically for use with gems .",
    "the detector in gsaoi is a mosaic of four @xmath25 hgcdte arrays that cover an @xmath26 arcsec area with 0.02 arcsec pixel@xmath27 sampling .",
    "gaps between the arrays form a cross - shaped pattern with 3 arcsec wide arms on the sky .",
    "images were recorded through @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and br@xmath30 filters , with short and long exposure times to allow a wider magnitude range to be sampled than is possible with only a single exposure time .",
    "a three point ( short exposure ) and five point ( long exposure ) linear north / south dither pattern was employed that allowed one arm of the gap on the detector mosaic to be filled . *",
    "the cluster fields are not crowded , and so the seeing requirements for this program were set to 85%ile .",
    "the fried ( 1966 ) parameter , @xmath31 , provides one measure of image quality .",
    "the @xmath31 measurement taken from the image header of the exposure that was recorded midway through the observing sequence for each cluster is listed in table 2 .",
    "the seeing degrades as @xmath31 moves to smaller values . during a seeing campaign in 1998 ,",
    "vernin et al . ( 2000 ) found a mean @xmath31 of 19 cm on cerro pachon , with a minimum @xmath31 of 5 cm , and a maximum of 40 cm .",
    "the values of @xmath31 listed in table 2 are less than the mean found by vernin et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , indicating that these measurements were made during worse than normal seeing conditions , as was intended . *",
    "the mean fwhm values , @xmath32 , and the standard deviation about these means , @xmath33 , are also listed in table 2 .",
    "these gauge the level of correction and the uniformity of the psf across the gsaoi field , and the entries in table 2 were measured from the psf stars that were used in the photometric analysis of the long exposure images ( section 3 ) .",
    "the psf stars in the br@xmath30 images have similar fwhms to those in @xmath29 , and so @xmath32 and @xmath33 are not listed for that filter .    the angular resolution delivered by an ao system during given seeing conditions",
    "depends on wavelength , in the sense that as one moves to longer wavelengths then the corrected angular resolution will approach the telescope diffraction limit at that wavelength . at the same time",
    ", the psf will also become more uniform across the field ( i.e. @xmath33 in table 2 should decrease ) .",
    "the entries in table 2 show that both the angular resolution and stability of the fwhm across the field is better in @xmath29 than in @xmath28 , as expected .    * the telescope diffraction limit , @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the diameter of the primary mirror , is 0.04 arcsec in @xmath28 , and 0.07 arcsec in @xmath29 .",
    "the @xmath29 images of ngc 2401 have angular resolutions that come closest to the system diffraction limit .",
    "the entries in table 2 indicate that gems can deliver @xmath36 arcsec angular resolution images in @xmath28 and @xmath29 with a stability in the fwhm of 10% across the gsaoi field even when the imaging conditions are less than ideal . *",
    "the initial processing of the data followed standard procedures for near - infrared imaging .",
    "the basic steps were ( 1 ) dark subtracton , ( 2 ) flat - fielding , and ( 3 ) the removal of thermal emission artifacts that are produced by warm objects along the optical path , such as dust on the gsaoi entrance window .",
    "the first two steps used calibration frames that were recorded specifically for these purposes . as for the third step , calibration frames were constructed by median - combining the flat - fielded long exposure images of all program clusters on a filter - by - filter basis after these were processed to correct for differences in exposure time and sky level ( see below ) .",
    "the resulting calibration frames are not ` sky flats ' , as they are constructed from images that have already been corrected for flat - field variations .",
    "rather , they monitor an additive component in the background that constitutes a significant source of noise .    to construct the background calibration frames it is necessary to create a homogeneous set of images that have a common effective exposure time and have been corrected for variations in the background sky level , which can be significant over timescales of a few minutes in the near - infrared .",
    "the individual cluster images were first normalized to a common exposure time ( 1 second in this case ) . a constant sky level , measured by taking the mode of pixel intensities in each frame , was then subtracted from each image .",
    "as four different clusters were observed and the data were recorded with on - sky dithering , then the median intensity of all images at each gsaoi detector pixel is expected to be free of contamination from bright and moderately bright sources , leaving only thermal emission signatures .",
    "this expectation was borne out by visual inspection of the background calibration frames .",
    "the penultimate processing step is to correct for distortions that are introduced by the gems and gsaoi optics , and are manifest as a change in pixel scale with location in the images .",
    "these distortions are primarily ( but not exclusively ) radial in nature and are most obvious near the edge of the science field in images that are registered near the center of the gsaoi field .",
    "they can appear either as filter - dependent diffences in source centroids or as differences between source centroids in images recorded in the same filter but at different points in the on - sky dither pattern .",
    "when comparing observations recorded in different filters , the offsets are largest when @xmath28 and @xmath29 images are compared , where they can amount to differences in image centroids of a tenth of an arcsec ( i.e. a few gsaoi pixels ) near the edge of the gsaoi science field .",
    "offsets of a few hundredths of an arcsec ( i.e. a gsaoi pixel ) are typical when br@xmath30 and @xmath29 images are compared . to obtain a common reference grid for image combination and photometric analysis , the @xmath28 , br@xmath30 , and dithered @xmath29 images",
    "were geometrically transformed using the iraf geomap and geotran tasks into the reference frame defined by the @xmath29 image recorded at the null position of the dither pattern .",
    "the final images for each cluster were then found by taking the median signal level on a filter - by - filter basis at each pixel location in the transformed and aligned images .",
    "stellar brightnesses were measured with the psf - fitting program allstar ( harris & stetson 1988 ) .",
    "psfs for each cluster were constructed from between 15 to 20 stars using the @xmath37 routine in the daophot ( stetson 1987 ) package .",
    "the same stars were used to construct the psfs in all three filters .",
    "the wings of ao - corrected psfs typically extend out to radii that are comparable to the uncorrected seeing disk , and a 1 arcsec psf extraction radius was used here .",
    "psf stars were selected based on brightness and the absence of obvious companions .",
    "an additional criterion was location in the gsaoi science field , with the intent of obtaining a more - or - less uniform distribution of psf stars across the @xmath26 arcsec@xmath38 field .",
    "monitoring the psf at various points across the science field is important as modest residual psf variations remain in the gems - corrected beam .",
    "the @xmath33 entries in table 2 indicate that there are variations in the fwhm of psf stars of up to a few hundredths of an arcsec , and a visual inspection of the fwhm values over the gsaoi field indicated that modest systematic trends were evident .",
    "in fact , photometry obtained with a psf that has a first order spatial variation delivered tighter sequences on the cmds than those that resulted from the application of a constant psf .",
    "still , the differences between the cmds that result from the application of fixed and variable psfs are not large , and the basic results of this study would not change substantially if fixed psfs were used to obtain the photometry .    *",
    "the @xmath28 and @xmath29 photometry was calibrated using 28 observations of 13 persson et al .",
    "( 1998 ) standard stars that were recorded throughout the gems sv run .",
    "the @xmath39 formal error in the @xmath28 and @xmath6 zeropoints is @xmath40 magnitude , with a standard deviation about the mean of @xmath41 magnitudes .",
    "the calibration was checked against photometric measurements made from 2mass images , although the vastly different angular resolutions and faint limits of the gsaoi and 2mass observations limits the number of suitable stars that can be used in such a comparison .",
    "the gsaoi and 2mass images were also recorded at different epochs , and so stellar variability is a potential source of scatter .",
    "the brightnesses of sources in the 2mass images of the clusters were measured with allstar , and the results were calibrated using relevant information in the 2mass image headers . restricting the comparisons to isolated objects with @xmath42 ,",
    "then the mean differences between the two datasets are @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "these differences are in the sense gsaoi2mass , and the quoted uncertainties are @xmath39 errors in the mean .",
    "it is evident that the gsaoi and 2mass measurements are in a consistent photometric system .",
    "a similar conclusion was reached by davidge et al .",
    "( 2013 ) , based on comparisons of gsaoi and 2mass @xmath0 cmds of the cluster haffner 16 , which was also observed as part of program gs-2012b - sv-409 .",
    "*    the calibration of the br@xmath30 images is tied to the @xmath29 calibration .",
    "the central wavelengths and the mean throughputs of the br@xmath30 and @xmath29 filters are not vastly different , and a zeropoint for the @xmath45 filter was found by scaling the @xmath29 zeropoint to compensate for the difference in the effective bandpasses between the two filters . as shown in the next section ,",
    "this scaling results in br@xmath46 for most sources .",
    "* artificial star experiments were run to determine sample completeness and to characterize uncertainties in the photometry .",
    "the artificial stars were constructed by scaling the psfs that were used to make the photometric measurements and were assigned @xmath47 and @xmath48 colors that are representative of the cluster sequences on the cmds . as with real stars ,",
    "an artificial star was considered to be recovered only if it was detected in two filters ( either @xmath49 or @xmath50 ) .",
    "the artificial star experiments indicate that the completeness fractions near the faint end of the cmds vary from cluster - to - cluster , as expected due to differences in angular resolution .",
    "the @xmath0 cmds of all three clusters are complete when @xmath51 . *",
    "the @xmath0 cmds of the clusters are presented in figures 1  3 . *",
    "the blue error bars in the left hand panels show the @xmath52 random uncertainties in @xmath47 computed from the artificial star experiments .",
    "the predicted dispersion more - or - less matches the observations at @xmath53 and @xmath54 , suggesting that the scatter af the faint end of the cmds is dominated by photometric errors .",
    "in contrast , at @xmath55 the random uncertainties tend to be narrower than the observed scatter , suggesting that the width of the cmds at these magnitudes reflects an intrinsic dispersion in the photometric properties of objects .",
    "*    the cmd of haffner 17 has a moderately tight sequence with @xmath56 that is dominated by cluster stars .",
    "the scatter that is present at most magnitudes is likely due to a mix of cluster members , which are a combination of main sequence and pms objects , and field stars .",
    "star counts from the robin et al .",
    "( 2003 ) model suggest that the fraction of field stars in the haffner 17 cmd ranges from 30% at the bright end to 70% at the faint end .",

    "( 2003 ) model , with the reddening assumed to be uniformly distributed along the line of sight towards the cluster .",
    "these assumptions are used for all star count models discussed throughout this work .",
    "the dominant sequence of objects on the ngc 2401 cmd is not as well - defined as in the other two clusters .",
    "baume et al . ( 2006 ) present a near - infrared cmd of ngc 2401 obtained from 2mass images that also shows substantial scatter .",
    "the dispersion along the color axis is likely not due to differential reddening .",
    "if this were the case then @xmath57 magnitudes across the gsaoi field .",
    "differential reddening of this size would be surprising given that stars in ngc 2401 have an average @xmath58 ( section 4.2 ) .",

    "the star count models of robin et al .",
    "( 2003 ) suggest that 25  30% of the objects in the cmd of ngc 2401 are field stars , and we suspect that contamination from these objects is the dominant source of the scatter along the @xmath47 axis .",

    "of particular interest for the current work is the sequence of objects with @xmath59 that runs from @xmath60 to @xmath61 .",

    "@xmath64 was calculated from @xmath63 using the reddening relations listed in table 6 of schlegel et al .",
    "random uncertainties were estimated by perturbing the adopted reddening and determining the smallest change in this quantity that noticeably degraded the agreement between the isochrones and the observations .",

    "these experiments suggest that the random uncertainty in the observed distance modulus is @xmath69 magnitudes . with the reddening and distance set then",
    "an age can be estimated using the point on the cmd where the dominant stellar sequence departs from the ms as defined by old stellar systems and  for ngc 2401 and ngc 3105  from a direct comparison between the pms sequence and isochrones .",

    "still , in the absence of spectroscopic data , efforts to estimate metallicity based only on location in the galaxy are frustrated by the variation in metallicity at a fixed r@xmath1 , which is compounded by variations tied to the galactic position angle ( e.g. balser et al . 2011 ) . if the range in gradients found in the balser et al .",

    "the comparisons in figure 4 indicate that @xmath64 is not sensitive to isochrone metallicity .",
    "this is not surprising given that the reddening is determined from bright ms stars with photospheres in which energy transport is via radiative processes and electron scattering is the primary source of opacity .",
    "on the other hand , the z=0.010 and z=0.025 isochrones give @xmath5 values that differ by 0.3 dex , which corresponds to 1 kpc at the approximate distance of ngc 3105 .",

    "however , the upper part of the ms may be poorly populated in young , low mass clusters .",
    "statistical flucuations amongst the most massive stars in low mass clusters may even introduce a systematic bias in age estimates , in the sense that ages may be overestimated on average .",
    "in contrast , the msco and pms sequences are in parts of the cmd that  barring an anomalous mf  are more richly populated than the upper portions of the ms .",
    "the msco and pms thus provide a means of gauging the ages of young and intermediate - age low mass clusters that is less susceptible to statistical flucuations in stellar content than the msto .",
    "figure 5 shows the portions of the @xmath0 cmds that cover the faintest ms stars and brightest pms objects . the yellow line is a 1 gyr isochrone that is included to show a reference ` old ' ms .",
    "ages are estimated using two criteria : ( 1 ) the magnitude at which the majority of stars at the blue edge of the data envelope depart from the 1 gyr isochrone ( i.e. the msco ) , and ( 2 ) direct comparisons between the isochrones and pms sequences .",
    "it should be recalled that the age estimates made from pms sequences are not sensitive to @xmath72 dex changes in metallicity ( figure 4 ) .",
    "the modest number of sources in haffner 17 , coupled with the sizeable contamination from field stars , complicates efforts to estimate its age .",
    "the upper and lower limits of the msco in this cluster are indicated in the left hand panel of figure 5 .",
    "the faint limit of the msco is the point below which sources no longer fall within @xmath74 magnitude of the 1 gyr ms along the @xmath47 axis , and is defined by the 5 points between @xmath75 and 17.65 that lie close to the 1 gyr ms .",
    "* this @xmath74 magnitude criterion in @xmath47 exceeds the estimated random uncertainties in the photometry , and so provides a conservative means of assessing when stars are not on the ms .",
    "* looking at brighter magnitudes , there is a @xmath76 magnitude gap between this clump of points and the next group of points that fall close to the ms , and these define the bright limit of the msco estimate .",
    "objects that scatter closely about the ms are relatively common at brighter magnitudes .",
    "a well - defined pms sequence is not evident in the cmd of haffner 17 , and this is likely a consequence of the flat lf of this cluster ( section 5 ) combined with the high levels of field star contamination .",
    "therefore , the age estimate for this cluster is restricted to the msco , which suggests that haffner 17 has an age in the range 45  60 myr .",
    "this age is consistent with that estimated by prededos ( 2000 ) from the msto .",
    "given the comparatively low level of field star contamination towards ngc 2401 , the majority of points in the middle panel of figure 5 likely belong to that cluster .",
    "the faint limit of the msco for ngc 2401 is based on the clump of four points near @xmath77 that fall immediately to the right of the 1 gyr ms .",
    "the next faintest clump of points that are close to the 1 gyr ms are seen near @xmath78 , and this large gap indicates that @xmath77 is a reasonable estimate of the faint limit of the msco , * even after considering the random dispersion in @xmath47 estimated from the artificial star experiments*. between @xmath77 and 17.2 there are two points that fall within a few hundredths of a magnitude in @xmath47 of the ms .",
    "the faintest of these at @xmath79 defines the bright limit of the msco for this cluster .",
    "the age of ngc 2401 can also be estimated from pms stars that populate the sequence of points between @xmath77 and 18 and scatter about the 20 myr isochrone .",
    "given the modest level of field star contamination then the majority of these objects are likely members of ngc 2401 .",
    "considering the msco and pms ages of ngc 2401 together , then the cluster has an age in the range 20  30 myr .",
    "this is consistent with the age found by baume et al .",

    "( 2004 ) and hasegawa et al .",
    "( 2008 ) . assuming a normal mf ",
    "an assumption that is justified in section 5  then the older ages predicted by the latter two studies can not explain the absence of ms stars between @xmath77 and @xmath78 and the presence of objects as bright as @xmath77 with pms - like photometric properties .",
    "field star contamination is an issue for determining the msco magnitude in ngc 3105 . still , there are large numbers of points that fall along  or immediately to the right of  the 1 gyr ms isochrone to as faint as @xmath80 .",
    "data points clustering about the ms are present at fainter magnitudes , but they form a more diffuse sequence than at brighter magnitudes * with a dispersion that exceeds that expected from random photometric errors alone*. this suggests that these objects are field stars .",
    "therefore , @xmath80 is adopted as the msco faint limit in ngc 3105 . keeping with the spirit of the procedure applied for haffner 17 and ngc 2401 ,",
    "then the bright limit of the msco in ngc 3105 is assigned to the next brightest clump of points , which occur at @xmath75 .",
    "the age of ngc 3105 determined from the msco is then 25 myr .",
    "an age for ngc 3105 can also be estimated from pms stars that form a locus of points in the cmd with @xmath81 .",
    "the majority of points on this sequence fall between the 20 and 40 myr isochrones and are indicative of an age near @xmath82 myr , which is consistent with the age deduced from the msco .",
    "the age of ngc 3105 based on the msco and pms is then @xmath82 myr .",

    "the predicted random errors in @xmath86 match the observed scatter near the faint ends of the cmds .",

    "the br@xmath85 color of haffner 17 stays roughly constant with @xmath6 magnitude , with no obvious change in br@xmath85 near the msco .",

    "this being said , it is not clear if the change in the br@xmath85 distribution is due to the onset of br@xmath30 emission , or to a decrease in the strength of br@xmath30 absorption .",
    "pms objects have lower surface gravities than ms stars with the same color , and so may have weaker br@xmath30 absorption line strengths .",
    "the differences in the br@xmath30 properties of pms and non - pms sequence stars in ngc 2401 and ngc 3105 could be due to such a surface gravity effect .",
    "if this is the case then the br@xmath30 observations have picked up on a signature of pms stars , albeit one that is due to a mechanism other than hydrogen line emission .",
    "could the break in the @xmath87 cmds not be related to pms stars ?",
    "the m@xmath102 at which the change in @xmath86 occurs corresponds to that of ms stars with spectral type mid - f , and the equivalent widths of hydrogen absorption lines change significantly between spectra types f0v ( m@xmath103 ) to g0v ( m@xmath104 ) .",
    "however , a change in br@xmath85 colors due to spectroscopic variations among ms stars would be expected to occur over @xmath105 magnitude in @xmath6 , whereas the breaks found here seem to occur over a narrow magnitude range .",
    "there is additional evidence that the changes in @xmath86 are due to pms stars .",
    "there is a well - populated , narrow pms sequence on the @xmath0 cmd of ngc 3105 , allowing pms stars to be identified using their location on the cmd .",
    "the br@xmath85 colors of objects that fall along the pms sequence can then be compared with those of objects that are not on this sequence , and so have a lower likelihood of being pms stars . for the purposes of making such a comparison ,",
    "objects in the interval @xmath75 and 18.5 that fall within @xmath106 magnitude in @xmath47 of the pms sequence on the @xmath0 cmd are assumed to be pms objects , while those within the same @xmath6 magnitude range but having @xmath47 colors outside of the @xmath106 magnitude pms strip are classified as non - pms objects .",

    "if br@xmath30 emission is present then spectroscopy at visible / red wavelengths should reveal wide - spread h@xmath116 and h@xmath117 emission from pms objects in these clusters .",

    "in section 4 it was demonstrated that the distance modulus computed from the @xmath0 cmd depends on the metallicity of the isochrone that is compared with the cmd , and this could affect the agreement between the lfs and the models .",

    "the core component of the tpcf is the separation function ( sf ) , which is the distribution of separations between all possible source pairings . the sf multiplexes information from all objects , and so makes efficient use of available information , although at the price of mixing information from cluster and non - cluster members .",
    "geometric effects are rectified by dividing the sf by that of an artificially - generated uniformly - distributed sample of objects with an image geometry that mimics the actual data . this ratio is then normalized according to the number of pairings in the two sfs .",

    "consider haffner 17 , where there is a peak in the tpcf at the smallest separations in the upper panel of figure 8 .",
    "the bin that covers the smallest separations samples objects with spatial separations from 0.0024 pc ( i.e. 0.12 arcsec  the angular resolving power of the data ) to 0.04 pc ( i.e. 2 arcsec - the bin size used to construct the tpcf ) . the bin that samples the smallest separations in haffner 17",

    "the clustering properties of stars having different masses  such as the objects in the bms and fms samples  provide insights into the dynamical state of a system .",
    "for example , objects with lower masses being more uniformly distributed on the sky than higher mass objects is a signature of mass segregation , although other processes could produce similar results .",
    "the ratio of the sfs of the bms and fms samples are shown in the lower panel of figure 8 . if the objects in the bms and fms samples have similar clustering properties then the ratio of the sfs should be @xmath105 , and this is the case over most separations in ngc 2401 .",

    "field stars are uniformly distributed on the sky and will bias tpcfs towards flatter distributions . if the magnitude intervals that cover the bms and fms samples have different fractional contaminations from field stars then the ratio of the bms and fms sfs will be skewed by these differences .",
    "the field star fraction in the haffner 17 and ngc 3105 data is higher in the fms sample ( 70% in haffner 17 and 64% in ngc 3105 ) than in the bms sample ( 29% in haffner 17 and 41% in ngc 3105 ) . for comparison , the field star fraction in the ngc 2401 bms and fms samples  where the objects show similar clustering properties ( see above )  are not greatly different , with 26% contamination in the bms sample , and 29% in the fms sample .",

    "a number of realizations were run , and a mean bms@xmath141field star sf was computed for both clusters to suppress stochastic variations .",
    "the results are compared with the observed bms tpcfs in the top panel of figure 9 .    introducing a simulated field star population has only a modest impact on the bms tpcfs at small separations , reflecting the modest on - sky density of the added stars , and the resulting low probablity that they are near other objects .",
    "however , the multiplexed nature of the sfs causes the contribution made by the added stars to grow towards progressively larger separations . it can be seen in figure 9 that balancing the field star fractions affects the tpcfs at separations @xmath142 arcsec , which is where differences between the bms and fms samples of haffner 17 and ngc 3105 in figure 8 are apparent .",
    "the ratios of the mean bms@xmath141field star and fms tpcfs of haffner 17 and ngc 3105 are shown in the lower panel of figure 9 .",
    "balancing the field star levels in the bms and fms samples moves the ratio of tpcfs at separations @xmath142 arcsec in haffner 17 much closer to unity , as expected if the differences in figure 8 between the haffner 17 samples are significantly skewed by field stars .",
    "still , it is apparent that the bms and fms samples in this cluster have different angular distributions , as the bms / fms ratio falls consistently below unity at separations @xmath143 arcsec after balancing the field star fractions . as for ngc 3105",
    ", the fms sample also remains more uniformly distributed than the bms component after balancing the field star fractions .",
    "there are thus mass - related differences in the spatial distribution of stars in haffner 17 and ngc 3105 .",
    "this is evidence that these clusters are dynamically evolved .",
    "near - infrared images obtained with gsaoi@xmath141gems have been used to examine the photometric properties and spatial distributions of stars in the young open clusters haffner 17 , ngc 2401 , and ngc 3105 .",
    "these clusters are located at large galactocentric radii , and ngc 3105 is one of the most remote young clusters yet discovered in the galaxy .",
    "studies of external galaxies suggest that young and intermediate age clusters are not uncommon in the outermost regions of star - forming disks ( e.g. herbert - fort et al .",
    "studies of young clusters in the outer galaxy may then yield insights into how clusters in the outer disks of spiral galaxies evolve in general . because these clusters are in an environment that is systematically different from the solar neighborhood , their evolution might differ from those of better - studied nearby clusters .",
    "the age , reddening , and distance modulus estimated for each cluster from the gsaoi@xmath141gems data are summarized in table 3 .",
    "the distances and reddenings found here are based on the morphology of the ms on the @xmath0 cmd .",
    "the distances measured for ngc 3105 and ngc 2401 place them closer than previous studies , while the opposite is true for haffner 17 .",
    "the reddenings of all three clusters also differ from previous estimates .",
    "it should be recalled that the @xmath64 values found here were computed from @xmath63 using the entries in table 6 of schlegel et al .",
    "if the extinction along the lines of sight to the target clusters follows different reddening laws then this will affect comparisons with @xmath64 estimates made at visible wavelengths .",
    "the ages are based on the photometric properties of pms and lower mass ms stars , and so are independent of previous age estimates that relied on the msto .",
    "barring a peculiar mf , ages that rely on faint cluster members will be less susceptible to the statistical variations in stellar content that can affect the brightest ms and evolved stars in low mass clusters , which in turn complicates efforts to determine ages from the msto .",
    "this being said , the use of faint objects to measure ages comes at a cost .",
    "uncertainties in the photometric measurements increase towards fainter magnitudes , and sample completeness may become a factor when asessing the magnitude of the msco .",
    "contamination from field stars also becomes a concern when measuring ages from faint members , as the number of field stars grows towards fainter magnitudes .",
    "the predominantly red colors of field stars also mean that they will tend to overlap more with those of pms stars than with stars near the msto . finally , there are also numerous uncertainties in models of pms objects ( e.g. seiss 2001 ) .",
    "still , it is encouraging that the isochrones used here track the observed pms sequences , and yield ages that are consistent with previous determinations .",
    "haffner 17 has the most sparsely populated cmd in our sample , and so it might be aniticipated that the age measured from the msto of that cluster will be the most prone to statistical variations among the brightest ms stars .",
    "however , there is no evidence that this is the case , as the age determined from the gsaoi data is consistent with that found by pedredos ( 2000 ) . as for ngc 2401 and ngc 3105",
    ", the gsaoi data suggest that these clusters have ages 20  30 myr .",
    "previous studies of ngc 2401 have suggested a wide range of ages , and our results favor the age found by baume et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , as opposed to those measured by sujatha et al .",
    "( 2004 ) and hasegawa et al .",
    "the age measured for ngc 3105 agrees with those deduced by sagar et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and paunzen et al .",
    "( 2005 ) from the msto .",
    "the good agreement with published ages suggests that stochastic effects have not affected the present - day msto contents of these clusters .",
    "given their ages , the clusters are expected to contain faint sub - solar mass pms objects , and pms sequences are seen in the cmds of ngc 2401 and ngc 3105 .",
    "an intriguing result from section 4 is that the mean br@xmath85 color changes within @xmath94 magnitudes in @xmath6 of the onset of the pms sequence in both clusters .",
    "in addition , the photometric properties of stars along the pms sequence in ngc 3105 differ from those of field stars in the same magnitude interval , in the sense that the pms stars are brighter on average in the br@xmath30 filter at a given @xmath6 magnitude than field stars . while narrow - band br@xmath30 observations alone do not provide the information required for an unambiguous interpretation of the cause of these differences , both results are consistent with br@xmath30 emission being present .",
    "optical and/or near - infrared spectroscopy will be required to determine if line emission is present .",
    "if br@xmath30 emission is present among pms stars in ngc 2401 and ngc 3105 then it must have a high frequency of occurrence to affect the mean br@xmath85 colors .",
    "star clusters disperse in response to internal and external processes . despite having more - or - less similar ages ,",
    "our data suggest that haffner 17 , ngc 2401 , and ngc 3105 are in different stages of evolution . the @xmath6 lfs discussed in section 5",
    "provide some of the evidence that supports this interpretation .",
    "the @xmath6 lf of ngc 2401 is well - matched over a wide magnitude range by models that assume a chabrier ( 2001 ) mf . to the extent that the initial mf of stars having masses within a few tenths of a dex of solar is universal",
    ", then this suggests that ngc 2401 has not shed large numbers of low mass stars .",
    "however , this is not the case for ngc 3105 , as the @xmath6 lf of this cluster is deficient in low mass objects when compared with models .",
    "the @xmath6 lf of haffner 17 is very different from those of either ngc 2401 and ngc 3105 , in that it is relatively flat , even at the bright end .",
    "the spatial distributions of ms and pms stars provide additional evidence that the clusters are in different stages of evolution .",
    "bms and fms objects in ngc 2401 have similar clustering properties , suggesting that intermediate and low mass objects in ngc 2401 have not yet developed kinematically distinct distributions , and this is further evidence that ngc 2401 is not dynamically evolved .",
    "in contrast , after balancing field star contamination in different magnitude intervals , pms objects and low mass ms stars in haffner 17 and ngc 3105 are more uniformly distributed than stars in the bms sample , suggesting that low and high mass objects in these clusters have different kinematic properties .",
    "insights into the evolutionary status of these clusters can also be deduced from their integrated properties .",
    "cluster masses , radii , and free - fall times were calculated for each cluster , and the results are shown in table 3 .",
    "the masses were computed by transforming the cluster lfs into mfs using magnitude @xmath73 mass relations from the padova isochrones , and then integrating the results .",
    "these masses are lower limits because ( 1 ) the clusters extend beyond the gsaoi field , and ( 2 ) cluster members with masses @xmath144 m@xmath127 are not sampled with these data . still , the corrections for these effects are likely to be modest",
    ". an alternative would be to compute total masses from the integrated brightnesses listed in table 1 , although the results would be highly uncertain due to the presence of bright stars ( section 1 ) .",
    "the last column of table 3 lists the ratio of the cluster age to the dynamical time scale ( @xmath145 ) , which is one measure of the kinematic state of a system .",
    "marks & kroupa ( 2012 ) find that significant evolution in cluster density occurs when a system is younger than @xmath146 , and that only more subdued changes in density occur after this time . to the extent that the ratio of cluster age to the dynamical timescale is a simple probe of kinematic evolution",
    ", it indicates that ngc 2401 is the least evolved cluster ( i.e. it has the smallest ratio of age to @xmath145 ) .",
    "this is consistent with the investigation of the mf and the angular distributions of bms and fms stars presented above .",
    "in contrast , haffner 17 and ngc 3105 are predicted to be more evolved than ngc 2401 .    if these clusters formed in large - scale complexes then they may be susceptible to environmentally - driven evolution .",
    "however , an examination of digital sky survey images shows that the clusters are isolated , in the sense that neighboring stellar groupings are at least 10 arcmin away in projection .",
    "of course , over tens of myr the random motions that clusters attain in disks may cause them to move large distances and erase structure that was in place during the time of their formation ( e.g. davidge 2007 ) .",
    "their present - day environment may then be very different from the environment where they formed .",
    "the evolution and present - day appearance of a cluster can also be shaped early in its life by internally - driven events that can cause significant cluster - to - cluster differences in stellar content .",
    "systems that form massive , short - lived stars may be prone to a catastrophic loss of gas driven by winds and sne that can change the gravitational potential and cause the cluster to disperse ( e.g. lada & lada 2003 ) . if sne activity is delayed then the likelihood of a cluster being disrupted will drop , as the fraction of cluster mass that is in gas and dust decreases with time as this material is consumed by star formation and disperses from the cluster  as time passes the removal of gas will then have a smaller impact on the cluster potential .",
    "any delay in sne activity also allows cluster members to come closer to being fully virialized , with the result that the extremes in velocity that are conducive to the loss of stars when the cluster potential changes are reduced ( e.g. smith et al . 2011 ) .",
    "the total stellar mass of a cluster likely plays a key role in determining if internal processes drive its evolution .",
    "pelupessy & portegies zwart ( 2012 ) investigate the role that statistical variations among massive stars play in the evolution of systems with stellar masses @xmath147 m@xmath127 .",
    "the three clusters studied here have masses close to that adopted for the simulations , allowing relevant comparisons to be made .",
    "pelupessy & portegies zwart find that stochastic variations in the population of upper ms stars can lead to profound cluster - to - cluster differences in the early evolution of the simulated clusters .",
    "if stars are present that are massive enough to become sn early - on , then low mass stars  which attain higher velocities than more massive stars as a system relaxes  may be preferentially lost from the cluster early in its evolution . on the other hand ,",
    "if statistical flucuations in stellar content are such that very massive stars do not form then a cluster may not be purged of gas until much later in its life , with a smaller impact on its structural characteristics .",
    "of course , the timing of sne activity is not the only factor that shapes early cluster evolution . for example",
    ", sub - clustering may concentrate star - forming activity , lowering local gas fractions and thus reducing the impact of sne - driven gas loss ( kruijssen et al .",
    "2012 ) .    the properties of the ngc 2401 lf and the relative distributions of its stars in the bms and fms samples hint that ngc 2401 was not subjected to violent early evolution , and had an uneventful past .",
    "however , the same can not be said for haffner 17 and ngc 3105 , and there are observations that could be carried out that would cast light on their early histories .",
    "clusters will expand in response to the sudden loss of large quantities of gas ( e.g. baumgardt & kroupa 2007 ) , and an extended stellar halo might be an observational signature of this ( e.g. davidge 2012 ; bastian & goodwin 2006 ) . if haffner 17 and ngc 3105 experienced early mass loss then a wide - field survey of these clusters may reveal a halo containing objects that span a range of masses , although the long term survivability of such a structure will depend on the local tidal field . in the case of ngc 3105",
    "some of the halo objects should be pms sources , and these may not be difficult to detect if they are hydrogen line emitters , as suggested in section 4 .",
    "in addition to affecting the structural properties of star clusters , the presence of massive hot stars may also affect the final mf of stars that form . the ultraviolet radiation field produced by very massive stars may erode nearby accretion disks and choke subsequent stellar growth , thereby affecting the minimum stellar mass in their immediate vicinity ( e.g. johnstone et al . 1998 ; adams et al .",
    "2004 ; de marchi et al . 2011 ) .",
    "if haffner 17 contained an extremely massive hot star then such an object may have affected the final cluster mf .",
    "the preceeding discussion assumes that the processes that drive the disruption of a cluster during the initial stages of its assembly differ from those that disrupt older clusters . however , there are hints that the disruption rate of very young clusters may be similar to that of older clusters , as would be expected if cluster destruction during the early stages of cluster assembly and at later times are driven by the same mechanisms",
    ". in particular , if all stars form in clusters , then the relative numbers of stars that are in clusters and the field in the solar neighborhood suggest that over 90% of natal groupings are disrupted within 10 myr of their birth ( bonatto & bica 2011 ) .",
    "if it is assumed that clusters remain intact over the lifetimes of their most massive stars ( i.e. @xmath105 myr ) , then this pace of attrition is consistent with that seen among clusters that span a broad range of ages in nearby disk galaxies , where the number of clusters drops by roughly an order of magnitude for every decade in age ( fall & chandar 2012 ) .",
    "that the pace of cluster destruction among very young systems tracks that among much older systems is suggestive of similar mechanisms disrupting clusters over a wide range of ages",
    ". if this is the case then while very young clusters are undoubtedly subject to mass loss driven by winds and sne , these may not be the dominant mechanisms driving cluster disruption .",
