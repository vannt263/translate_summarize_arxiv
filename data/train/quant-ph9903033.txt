    "entanglement is probably the most important resource in quantum information processing : quantum teleportation @xcite , quantum cryptography @xcite , quantum computation @xcite , quantum error correction @xcite are only some examples of its ubiquitous crucial role . in all the instances mentioned above its main use",
    "is transmitting , processing , correcting quantum information . in this paper",
    "we would like to analyse whether it is useful in one particular scenario of transmission of classical information along a noisy channel : the depolarising channel .",
    "it has been proved that when multiple uses of the channel are allowed entangled states can maximise distinguishability in a particular case of noisy channel : the two - pauli channel @xcite .",
    "it is however common belief that , due to their fragility in the presence of noise , entangled states can not improve the transmission of classical information when used as signal states , at least when the noise is isotropic - in the sense that will be explained in the following sections - as in the case of the depolarising channel .",
    "although there is numerical evidence in this direction @xcite no explicit proof has been produced so far , at least at the best of the authors knowledge .",
    "the scope of this paper is precisely to prove that the mutual information can not be increased when signals of entangled states of two qubits are used with a memoryless depolarising channel .",
    "in the following we will consider a memoryless quantum channel acting on individual qubits .",
    "the channel is described by ",
    "action \" operators @xcite @xmath0 satisfying @xmath1 such that if we send through the channel a qubit in a state described by the density operator @xmath2 the output qubit state is given by the map    @xmath3    by definition a channel is memoryless when its action on arbitrary signals @xmath4 , consisting of @xmath5 qubits ( including entangled ones ) , is given by    @xmath6    for the depolarising channel , on which we will concentrate our attention , the action operators take the following simple form    @xmath7    here @xmath8 are the pauli matrices , which are transformed under the action of the channel as    @xmath9    as we can see , the depolarising channel can be specified by the parameter @xmath10 , whose meaning will be clear in the following section , or equivalently by the error probability @xmath11 .",
    "this gives us a complete description of the channel for any input state composed of an arbitrary number of qubits .",
    "in the simplest scenario the transmitter can send one qubit at a time along the channel . in this case the codewords will be restricted to be the tensor product of the states of the individual qubits .",
    "quantum mechanics however allows also the possibility to entangle multiple uses of the channel . for this more general strategy",
    "it has been shown that the amount of reliable information which can be transmitted per use of the channel is given by @xcite    @xmath12    where @xmath13 with @xmath14 is the input ensemble of states @xmath4 of @xmath5  generally entangled  qubits and @xmath15 is the mutual information    @xmath16    where the index @xmath5 stands for the number of uses of the channel .",
    "here    @xmath17    is the von neumann entropy , @xmath18 are the density matrices of the outputs and @xmath19 .",
    "logarithms are taken to base 2 .",
    "the advantage of the expression ( [ def - i ] ) is that it includes an optimisation over all possible povms at the output , including collective ones .",
    "therefore no explicit maximisation procedure for the decoding at the output of the channel is needed .",
    "the interest for the possibility of using entangled states as channel input is that it can not generally be excluded that @xmath15 is superadditive for entangled inputs , i.e. we might have @xmath20 and therefore @xmath21 .    in this scenario",
    "the classical capacity @xmath22 of the channel is defined as    @xmath23    for the depolarising channel a lower bound on @xmath22 is given by the one - shot capacity @xmath24 ( see @xcite ) , while upper bounds are given in @xcite . in this paper",
    "we will not attempt to find the classical capacity of the depolarising channel , as this would imply analysing signals with any degree of entanglement between @xmath5 qubits and performing the limit @xmath25 .",
    "we will restrict ourselves to the simplest non - trivial case , namely @xmath26 , and we will find the maximal mutual information @xmath27 .",
    "the question we want to address is : is it possible to increase the mutual information by entangling the two qubits , i.e. is @xmath28 for the depolarising channel ? to answer this question with ``",
    "no '' we will show that due to the isotropy of the depolarising channel the mutual information for orthogonal entangled states of two qubits depends only on the degree of entanglement , and in particular that it is a decreasing function of the entanglement .",
    "we anticipate that , as we will show later , the mutual information can not be increased by an alphabet of non - orthogonal states .    to simplify our analysis we express the signal states in the  bloch vector \" representation @xcite    @xmath29    where as before @xmath30 are the pauli operators of the two qubits . using eq .",
    "( [ shrink ] ) the output of the channel can be written as    @xmath31",
    "this shows that the output states are linked to the input signals by an isotropic shrink of the bloch vectors @xmath32 by a factor @xmath10 and of the tensor @xmath33 by a factor @xmath34 .",
    "we will now consider the following general signal state    @xmath35    in the above equation @xmath36 $ ] parametrises the degree of entanglement between the two qubits that carry the signal , which we will measure with the usual entropy of entanglement @xmath37 @xcite , where @xmath38 denotes the reduced density operator of one qubit ( note that @xmath39 is the same for both qubits as the trace can be taken indifferently over any of the two ) .",
    "for the state ( [ signals ] ) we have @xmath40 .",
    "we point out that this is the most general choice for a signal state .",
    "this can be easily verified observing that any pure state @xmath41 of two qubits can be decomposed in the schmidt basis as follows @xcite    @xmath42    where @xmath43 are real and @xmath44 , while @xmath45 and @xmath46 represent orthogonal bases for the first and the second qubit , respectively .",
    "these two bases will not in general have the same orientation in the bloch vector representation , but for our purpose this is not an impediment because of the isotropy of the depolarising channel . in other words , since there is no privileged direction for the choice of basis @xmath47 - they do not even have to be the same for each of the two qubits - we are free to let them coincide with the two respective schmidt bases .",
    "after the action of the depolarising channel , the density operator corresponding to the input state ( [ signals ] ) takes the form    @xmath48    in the basis @xmath49 the output @xmath50 reads    @xmath51    the corresponding eigenvalues are    @xmath52    they depend on the degree of entanglement , but are independent of the choice of basis .    for maximisation of the second term of the mutual information @xmath53 , given in eq .",
    "( [ def - i ] ) , it is sufficient to optimise independently terms of the form    @xmath54    remember that the _ a priori _ probabilities add to one , so neither the number of input states nor their probabilities enter in the maximisation of the second term . as we will show later , the first term in ( [ def - i ] ) and therefore the mutual information is maximised for a set of orthogonal and equally probable states .",
    "we can search the extremum of ( [ mutual ] ) analytically leading to the requirement @xmath55 for @xmath56 there are two solutions , namely @xmath57 which corresponds to non - entangled input states and turns out to be the maximum , and @xmath58 which means maximal entanglement of the inputs and corresponds to the minimum of @xmath53 .",
    "the explicit expression for the maximal mutual information corresponding to four equiprobable orthogonal non - entangled input states is given by    @xmath59    notice that this is equivalent to twice the one - shot capacity .",
    "so we have shown that in this case entanglement does not help to increase the mutual information @xcite .",
    "as promised , we now justify our choice of orthogonal states by proving that the mutual information can not be increased by using non - orthogonal alphabets .",
    "we were able to maximise the two parts of the mutual information , defined in equation ( [ def - i ] ) , independently of each other for the following reasons .",
    "note first that @xmath60 is maximal for @xmath61 .",
    "for the depolarising channel this form is achieved by any set of four orthogonal equiprobable input states .",
    "the minimum of the term @xmath62 in the mutual information , however , does not depend on the orthogonality of the states , as only the eigenvalues of the output states determine the extremum .",
    "we noticed that each @xmath63 can be minimised independently for each input state @xmath4 . as we have shown before , @xmath63 is minimal , and reaches the same minimum value , for any choice of input states of non - entangled qubits .",
    "note that due to these reasons the same mutual information could be also reached by using a larger alphabet of non - orthogonal non - entangled states and adjusted probabilities , but it can never be improved beyond the maximum value given in ( [ maxinfo ] ) .",
    "as an illustration , in figure [ fig1 ] we show the mutual information for the following set of equally probable orthogonal states @xmath64 and @xmath65 for @xmath66 . as we can see , the mutual information is a decreasing function of the degree of entanglement . in figure [ fig2 ]",
    "we report the mutual information as a function of @xmath10 for uncorrelated states and maximally entangled states . as proved above",
    ", we can see that uncorrelated signals lead to a higher mutual information for any channel with @xmath67 .",
    "to summarise , we have asked whether classical communication through a depolarising channel can be improved by entangling two uses of the channel .",
    "our analytical results show that this is not the case : the mutual information is maximised when using orthogonal equiprobable non - entangled states .",
    "the generalisation to more than two qubits remains an open problem @xcite .",
