    "according to the standard model of cosmology , the dark energy accounts for the current accelerating expansion phase of the universe .",
    "however , several alternative ideas have also been proposed to explain this accelerated expansion , and granting mass to graviton is one of them @xcite .",
    "the idea of massive graviton was initiated with the linear theory for a non - zero rest mass particle with spin-2 @xcite , but endowed with mass , the graviton acquires two additional vector modes and a scalar mode compared to its massless counterpart .",
    "the parameters in the mass term are carefully tuned , otherwise a sixth degree of freedom with the ghost mode would appear . in the zero mass limit",
    ", all these degrees of freedom due to the mass term are supposed to decouple and it is expected to recover the general relativistic ( gr ) case .",
    "however , it is found that the vector modes decouple from the tensor perturbations in the massless limit , while the scalar mode retains a strong coupling to the trace of stress - energy tensor , thus causing a discontinuity called the vdvz discontinuity @xcite .",
    "the discontinuity problem can be resolved in the non - linear approach to massive gravity @xcite .",
    "but it is found that the non - linear theory reintroduces the ghost mode @xcite , however the non - linear solutions to this problem are found very useful @xcite .",
    "there are several approaches to massive gravity @xcite . in the present work ,",
    "we consider a particular model of the massive gravity in which gr is modified by the lorentz - violating mass terms @xcite , but still maintaining the 3d euclidean symmetry .",
    "this model is proposed as an analog of the higgs mechanism in gr where the graviton acquires mass as a result of spontaneous breaking of the lorentz symmetry .",
    "the advantage of this theory is that it is free from the ghost modes , vdvz discontinuity and at low strong coupling scale .",
    "further , the vector and scalar modes behave exactly like in gr case and hence the modification to gravity arises only from the two tensor modes whose dispersion relation is massive and relativistic .",
    "the primordial gravitational waves were created during inflationary period of the universe due a mechanism known as parametric amplification of the zero - point quantum oscillations @xcite .",
    "hence , the primordial gravitational waves can be placed in a particular quantum state called squeezed vacuum state @xcite .",
    "it is possible that the initial vacuum state with no graviton can be evolved into multi - particle quantum state through the parametric amplification process .",
    "further , the primordial gravitational waves created during the inflationary period can also be amplified by stimulated emission process thus there is a possibility of existing gravitons with thermal distribution @xcite .",
    "therefore the combined effects of squeezing and thermal features may be observed for the primordial gravitational waves .",
    "it is believed that the primordial gravitational waves have left its own signature on the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) in the form of a polarization , called the b - mode polarization of cmb @xcite .",
    "thus , if the primordial gravitational waves are considered as massive , then its effect is expected to reflect on the various angular power spectra of cmb ( see , for instance @xcite ) and in particular on the @xmath0-mode correlation angular power spectrum of cmb @xcite .",
    "recently , the angular power spectra of cmb for the massive primordial gravitational waves are studied without taking into account of the thermal feature and the existence of these waves in the squeezed vacuum state , but similar study for the massless counterpart is carried out and are compared with various observational results of cmb @xcite .",
    "hence , in the present work the primordial massive gravitational waves are placed in the squeezed vacuum state with thermal feature and their effects on the @xmath0-mode correlation angular power spectrum of cmb for various slow roll inflationary models are studied .",
    "the obtained results are compared with the joint analysis data of the bicep2/keck array 150 ghz and planck 353 ghz maps @xcite .",
