    "it is easy to see that the _ mean letter frequency _ of any given letter in the set of ternary square - free words is @xmath192 .",

    "indeed , the symmetric group @xmath193 acts on any square - free word @xmath12 by permutation of the three letters , and the set of square - free words of a given length is a disjoint union of orbits under this action .",
    "each orbit consists of a square - free word and its images under permutation of letters , and each letter has the same mean frequency on this orbit .",
    "so , for each orbit , the mean frequency of any given letter is @xmath192 , thus also for the set of all ternary square free words of any given length , or indeed for the set of all ternary square free words .",
    "we now want to show that there exist ternary square - free words of infinite length with well - defined letter frequencies for the case @xmath194 and for some cases where not all letter are equally frequent .",
    "in fact , we are going to prove not just that , but that there are exponentially many such words , so the growth rate for words of fixed frequencies , at least for the cases considered below , is positive .",
    "this can be done in a similar fashion as the proofs that the number of ternary square - free words grow exponentially @xcite .",
    "these proofs are based on brinkhuis triple pairs @xcite and their generalisations @xcite .",
    "we briefly sketch the argument here , see @xcite for details .",
    "the argument is based on square - free morphisms @xcite . here",
    ", we immediately consider the generalised version of @xcite .",

    "is defined as a set of substitution rules ( [ brinktrip ] ) such that all these words of length @xmath200 are square - free , for any choice of @xmath12 .",
    "this immediately implies that the number of square - free words grows at least as @xmath201 , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma  2 ) . in the case",
    "@xmath202 , this reduces to a usual substitution rule without any freedom ; in this case , it only proves existence of infinite words , not exponential growth of the number of words with length .    in @xcite , a special class of generalised brinkhuis triples was considered , and triples up to length @xmath203 with @xmath204 were obtained .",
    "this was recently improved to @xmath205 and @xmath206 in @xcite , yielding the lower bound of ( [ bounds ] ) .    what about the letter frequencies ? in general , the words",
    "@xmath196 that replace @xmath5 will have different letter frequencies , and in this case it is easy to see that not all the infinite words obtained by repeated substitution will have well - defined letter frequencies .",
    "however , we can say something about letter frequencies if we consider generalised brinkhuis triples where all words @xmath196 , @xmath199 , have the _ same _ letter frequencies , and analogously for the words @xmath197 , @xmath207 , and @xmath198 , @xmath199 . in this case , regardless of our choice of words in the substitution process , we obtain words with well - defined letter frequencies , precisely as in the case of a standard substitution rule . denoting the number of letters @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath166 in any of the words @xmath196 by @xmath208 , @xmath209 and @xmath210 , respectively , with @xmath211 , and analogously for @xmath197 and @xmath198 , we can summarise the letter - counting for the generalised brinkhuis triple in a @xmath212 substitution matrix @xmath213 in general , all entries of this matrix are positive integers , because there are no square - free words of length @xmath214 with only two letters .",
    "the ( right ) perron - frobenius eigenvector is thus positive , and its components encode the letter frequencies of the infinite words obtained by repeated application of the substitution rules .",
    "the perron - frobenius eigenvalue is @xmath173 , because @xmath215 is a left eigenvector with eigenvalue @xmath173 .    as mentioned previously , the generalised brinkhuis triples considered in @xcite do not have the property that the letter frequencies of the substitution words coincide . however , if we have a generalised brinkhuis triple , any subset of substitutions also forms a triple , because all we do is restricting to a subset of words which still are square - free .",
    "so by looking at the triples of @xcite and selecting suitable subsets of substitutions , we can use the same arguments to prove exponential growth of words with fixed letter frequencies .",
    "let us first consider the case of equal frequencies @xmath216 .",
    "we note that the special brinkhuis triples of @xcite had the additional property that @xmath217 and @xmath218 , where @xmath219 is the permutation of letters defined by @xmath220 and @xmath221 .",
    "if we select a subset of the words replacing @xmath5 such that they have the same numbers of letters @xmath208 , @xmath209 and @xmath210 , the substitution matrix for the corresponding triple consisting of those words and their images under @xmath219 is @xmath222 which is symmetric .",
    "hence the right perron - frobenius eigenvector is @xmath223 , and the letter frequencies are given by @xmath216 .",
    "the simplest example is a brinkhuis triple with @xmath224 @xcite ( see also @xcite ) which explicitly given by @xmath225 where @xmath226 denotes @xmath227 read back - to - front , which thus has the same letter numbers @xmath228 , @xmath229 and @xmath230 .",
    "so the number of ternary square - free words with letter frequencies @xmath216 grows at least as @xmath231 . by looking for the largest subsets of words with equal letter frequencies in the special brinkhuis triples of @xcite",
    ", we can improve this bound . for @xmath203 ,",
    "we find @xmath232 words @xmath196 with letter numbers @xmath233 , @xmath234 and @xmath235 , yielding a lower bound of @xmath236 for the exponential of the entropy .",
    "one of the two triples for @xmath205 of @xcite contains @xmath237 words with @xmath233 , @xmath238 and @xmath239 .",
    "this gives the following result .",

    ".    * remark .",
    "* this bound can without doubt be improved , because the triples of @xcite and @xcite where not optimised to contain the largest number of words of equal frequency .",
    "what about words with non - equal letter frequencies ?",
    "the following square - free substitution rule @xcite @xmath242 already shows that infinite words with unequal letter frequencies exist . in this case , the substitution matrix is @xmath243 and the right perron - frobenius eigenvector with eigenvalues @xmath87 is @xmath244 .",

    "thus , there is no indication that the nature of the singularity changes , in contrast to other examples from statistical mechanics , where such a change indicates a phase transition @xcite .",
    "we now address the question of the number of ternary square - free words , where we fix the frequency of letters of type @xmath5 .",
    "we consider the number of square - free words @xmath350 in @xmath7 letters with @xmath351 occurrences of the letter @xmath5 .",
    "the number @xmath352 may thus be regarded as the frequency of the letter @xmath5 .",

    "thus , the assumptions in ( * ? ? ?",
    "3.19 ) are satisfied , and we obtain    [ thm : ent ] the entropy function @xmath354 of ternary square - free words exists in @xmath364 and is defined by @xmath365 moreover , there is a sequence of integers @xmath366 such that @xmath367 and the limit @xmath368 exists and is finite and concave in @xmath364 .",
    "lastly , note also that @xmath369 is the least value of @xmath161 that maximises @xmath370 , where @xmath371 is that value of @xmath290 where the infimum is taken in @xmath372 .    *",
    "* together with lemma 2 , an immediate consequence of the concavity of the entropy function is that the entropy is strictly positive for all frequencies @xmath373 .",
    "we consider now the question where the entropy function takes its maximum . to this end",

    "[ thm : ent2 ] let @xmath374 .",
    "if @xmath375 , and if @xmath296 is strictly convex in @xmath298 , we have @xmath376 for the entropy function , and it is given by @xmath377 where @xmath378 is the unique positive solution of @xmath379 the entropy function @xmath354 attains its global maximum at @xmath319 .",
    "since @xmath296 is convex in @xmath298 and continuous , and @xmath380 , the infimum in ( [ form : dens ] ) occurs at a unique value @xmath381 . since @xmath382",
    ", we obtain @xmath383 as an implicit equation for @xmath378 .",
    "this uniquely defines a positive function @xmath384 , since strict convexity of @xmath296 and @xmath375 implies @xmath385 .",
    "we have explicitly @xmath386 , which shows that @xmath387 , and @xmath388 .",
    "this implies that @xmath319 is a local maximum of @xmath354 .",
    "due to the concavity of @xmath354 , it is the global maximum .",
    "we note that at @xmath319 , the letter density @xmath389 is the mean letter density , which was determined above to be @xmath390 by a symmetry argument .",
    "thus , under the above regularity assumption , maximum entropy occurs at equal ( mean ) letter density @xmath391 .",
    "this is an example of the more general result that maximum entropy in occurs at points of maximum symmetry , see @xcite for the concept of symmetry and its implications for the free energy and entropy of the combinatorial problem of random tilings , which is applicable in this case .",
    "in this article , we considered the growth rate , or the entropy , of the set of ternary square - free words . by computing generating functions @xmath44 for length-@xmath0 square - free words , where the condition of square - freeness is truncated at length @xmath0",
    ", we verified an upper bound proposed in @xcite and slightly improved it .",
    "the pattern of poles of these generating functions , and their behaviour as @xmath0 increases , points towards a natural boundary for the generating function @xmath33 .",
    "the presence of a natural boundary in a model indicates that it can not be solved exactly in terms of standard functions of mathematical physics , which obey linear differential equations with polynomial coefficients @xcite .",
    "this would exclude , for ternary square - free words , an exact value for the entropy and the functional form of the free energy .",
    "it may even be difficult to prove the existence of a critical exponent , compare the related self - avoiding walk problem @xcite .    in the ternary alphabet",
    ", no letter is preferred by the condition of square - freeness .",
    "thus , averaging over the entire sets of ternary square - free words , all letters appear equally often .",
    "however , in a single infinite word this need not be the case , indeed , the letter frequency may not be well - defined .",
    "however , one can derive limits on the minimum or maximum frequency of a given letter in an infinite ternary square - free words , and by explicitly constructing infinite words with given well - defined frequencies by means of substitution rules the minimum and maximum frequency can be bounded from above and below .",
    "we obtained limits from counting square - free words up to a certain length , sharper limits were given recently in @xcite .",
    "the bounds for the maximum frequency can certainly be further improved employing the approach of @xcite .",
    "lower bounds on the entropy are based on brinkhuis triples and their generalisations .",
    "we used these to prove that , for a list of rational values , the entropy of the set of square - free words with a fixed letter frequency is strictly positive . together with the concavity of the entropy function , obtained by methods of convex analysis and statistical mechanics , this led to the result that the entropy is strictly positive on an entire interval .    concerning the entropy function , it would be interesting to extend the interval of strict positivity by providing sharper bounds from suitable substitution rules",
    ". this might be achievable by following and suitably modifying the approach taken in @xcite .",
    "it is conceivable , albeit not necessary , that there exists a region of frequencies for which infinite square - free words exist , but the entropy vanishes , because the number of square - free words with that given letter frequency grows sub - exponentially .",
    "such behaviour has been reported for @xmath161th - power - free binary square - free words with rational powers in the range @xmath3927/3 @xcite .",
    "further , it is necessary to prove the validity of the regularity assumption on the free energy in theorem [ thm : ent2 ] .",
    "in contrast to other problems in statistical mechanics @xcite , there is no indication of a phase transition in the model of ternary square - free words , wherefore an analytic free energy is expected .",
    "it would also be interesting to analyse the letter distribution using probabilistic methods .",
    "similar examples lead , in an appropriate scaling limit , to gaussian distribution functions @xcite .",
