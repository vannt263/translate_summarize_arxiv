    "the nonlinear optical process of sum frequency generation ( sfg ) , also known as non - degenerate upconversion or frequency summation  @xcite , has been known and investigated for a number of years , going back at least to theoretical investigations in the seminal paper of armstrong _ et al .",
    "_  @xcite and experimental realisation by bass _ et al . _",
    "the process has many uses outside the quantum optics community , such as , to name only a few , surface vibrational spectroscopy of molecules  @xcite , two - dimensional vibrational spectroscopy  @xcite , studies of liquid interfaces  @xcite , low noise optical tomography  @xcite , and the investigation of powder supported catalysts  @xcite .",
    "however , despite the wide number of what we may term classical uses for this process , very little attention seems to have been paid to its quantum properties , especially in terms of entanglement and quadrature squeezing . for the intracavity process",
    ", a notable exception is the theoretical work of eschmann and reid  @xcite , who predicted sub - poissonian photon statistics in the high frequency mode and in the sum of the two low frequency modes .",
    "more attention has been paid to type ii second harmonic generation , where the non - degeneracy is in polarisation rather than in frequency , for example work by jack , collett and walls  @xcite , and by andersen and buchhave  @xcite .",
    "four - wave mixing is also a process which can lead to sub - poissonian fluctuations in intensity sums  @xcite , as well as a source of entangled beams of either photons  @xcite or atoms  @xcite .",
    "this leads us to expect that sum frequency generation may also be a source of entangled output beams .    in this work",
    "we will first introduce the full hamiltonian of the intracavity process before examining the properties of the interaction hamiltonian considered in isolation .",
    "we will then analyse the outputs of the full intracavity system in terms of squeezing and entanglement .",
    "we will show that sfg is in fact a versatile source of entanglement resources which can be easily tuned to entangle beams which have large frequency differences and produce entanglement between output beams at different intensities .",
    "the tunability of the process also allows us to predict that the same device could be used to demonstrate both symmetric and asymmetric steering  @xcite , which may have applications in the field of quantum cryptography .",
    "we will show that this process is potentially very useful for the field of continuous variable quantum information .",
    "the basic interaction is that of a photon at @xmath0 combining with a photon at @xmath1 to produce a photon at @xmath2 , mediated by a second order , @xmath3 , nonlinearity .",

    "we will begin by giving the equations of motion which result from considering the interaction hamiltonian in isolation and then add cavity loss and pump terms below , in section  [ sec : cavidade ] , as the addition of these is a trivial matter .",
    "we note here that the approach we use is not expected to give completely accurate predictions for the system operating in the travelling wave configuration as it does not account for such physical features as dispersion in the nonlinear medium .",
    "however , it does give an approximate idea and is useful for understanding the quantum dynamics which the hamiltonian makes possible .",
    "following the usual procedures  @xcite , we may map the interaction hamiltonian onto a fokker - planck equation for the p - representation pseudoprobability distribution of the system  @xcite . making the operator correspondences @xmath13 and @xmath14",

    "\\label{eq : fpe}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we immediately see that the diffusion term of the above fokker - planck equation is not positive - definite , so we will use the positive - p representation , which at the cost of doubling the dimensionality of the phase - space , allows us to map the resulting fokker - planck equation onto a set of stochastic differential equations  @xcite . making the changes @xmath16 and noting that @xmath17 in a distributional sense , we find the set of it calculus  @xcite equations , @xmath18 where the gaussian noise terms have the correlations @xmath19 we note here that the stochastic positive - p representation equations are an exact mapping from the hamiltonian and allow the calculation of any normally - ordered operator moments through an averaging process over trajectories , such that @xmath20 in the limit of a large number of stochastic trajectories , with the bar representing a classical averaging .",

    "hence we consider that linearisation of these equations is unlikely to be accurate after some shortish interaction time for either the mean fields or the quantum correlations .",
    "we will use a linearisation procedure in section  [ sec : cavidade ] , where this is much more useful as long as we are careful with the regime of viability .",

    "the horizontal axis is a scaled dimensionless time , @xmath21 .",

    "[ fig : ambulante ] for @xmath22 and the initial conditions @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "both the pumping fields are treated as coherent states , which is reasonable for stabilised lasers operating above threshold .",
    "we see that the dynamics are reminiscent of those obtained from a similar treatment of second harmonic generation , showing an almost complete conversion to the higher frequency , followed by partial reconversion to the two lower frequencies  @xcite .",
    "we note here that a previous semiclassical analysis for equal intensities in the two low frequency inputs showed complete conversion and no subsequent reconversion  @xcite , processes which can be explained as due to quantum fluctuations and the discrete nature of the electromagnetic field  @xcite .",
    "stochastic integration using the phase - space representations automatically includes these effects and allows for different quantum states of the input fields to be simulated , such as thermal  @xcite and number states  @xcite .",
    "quadrature variance for the field at @xmath25 and the fano factor for the intensity sum of the two low frequency fields .",
    "a value of less than one signifies squeezing or sub - poissonian statistics respectively .",
    "the two low frequency fields show excessive noise in both @xmath26 and @xmath27 quadratures and exhibit super - poissonian intensity fluctuations . ]    as our motivation for investigating this system is its utility for producing entangled and other quantum states of electromagnetic fields , we will now look at these quantum properties .",
    "the first of these is single - mode squeezing , for which we first need to define quadrature operators .",
    "we will define a general quadrature of the field at a given quadrature angle as  @xcite @xmath28 and use the shorthand @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "with these definitions , a squeezed state is one for which @xmath31 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : vprop ] we show the results of stochastic calculations for the variances of both the high frequency @xmath32 quadrature and the sum of the low - frequency intensities . for the latter , which has been predicted to give sub - poissonian statistics in the intracavity case  @xcite ,",
    "we have plotted the fano factor , defined for this case as @xmath33 so that any value below one means that the combined mode has less intensity fluctuations than a coherent state .",
    "comparing the two curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : vprop ] , we see that the squeezing in @xmath34 essentially continues until the upconversion turns into downconversion , whereas the noise suppression in the intensity sum disappears as the low frequency intensities approach their minima .",
    "the other quadratures , the single - mode intensities and the intensity differences all exhibit excess noise as the interaction proceeds .",
    "this ability to produce quadrature squeezed light at the sum frequency could be useful in , for example , super resolution optical measurements  @xcite .",
    ", and the reid epr correlation , @xmath35 , for the two low frequency fields . with symmetric inputs ,",
    "the epr correlation is equal for @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "note that the duan - simon value has been divided by four so that both entanglement and the epr paradox are demonstrated for values less than @xmath38 . ]",
    "the correlation between the intensities of the two low frequency fields suggests that they may exhibit bipartite entanglement .",
    "we examine this using the criteria for continuous variables developed by duan _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite and simon  @xcite . in the present case where the two pump modes have equal intensities , it is sufficient to violate one of the inequalities , @xmath39 to establish that the two low frequency modes are entangled",
    ". it is known that entangled states are a superset of states which can be used for steering  @xcite and that this can be demonstrated in the continuous variable case by violation of the reid epr ( einstein - podolsky - rosen ) inequalities  @xcite . in this case",
    "the inequality can be written as @xmath40 where @xmath41^{2}}{v(\\hat{x}_{k})},\\nonumber\\\\ v_{inf}(\\hat{y}_{j } ) & = & v(\\hat{y}_{j})-\\frac{\\left[v(\\hat{y}_{j},\\hat{y}_{k})\\right]^{2}}{v(\\hat{y}_{k } ) } , \\label{eq : vinf}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with violation of the inequality showing that modes @xmath42 and @xmath43 are entangled in the epr sense . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : eprduanprop ] , where we have divided the correlation for the sum of the @xmath44 quadratures and the difference of the @xmath45 quadratures by @xmath46 , these two measures give an unambiguous demonstration that the two modes become entangled by the interaction and are in fact entangled in the strong sense required by the concept of steering .",
    "having now established the properties of the hamiltonian dynamics , we will turn our attention to a more quantitative analysis of the intracavity case .",
    "in the intracavity case we are interested in correlations of the steady - state fields , as these are what are normally measured using homodyne techniques . to analyse these theoretically , we must add pumping and loss terms to the equations given above  ( [ eq : sfgsde ] ) . making the usual zero temperature born and markov approximations  @xcite for the interactions with the reservoirs , we find @xmath47 where the @xmath48 are the cavity loss rates at the respective frequencies , the @xmath49 are coherent pumping terms , and the noise terms have the same correlations as in eq .",
    "[ eq : sfgsde ] .    in the intracavity case",
    "it is often possible to find the appropriate fluctuation spectra via a process of linearising the fluctuations in the variables about their steady - state , classical solutions  @xcite .",
    "this enables us to write equations for the fluctuations as a multivariate ornstein - uhlenbeck process , from which it is particularly simple to extract the appropriate spectral correlations .",
    "there are however , two caveats which must be considered here .",
    "the first is that the steady - state solutions of the classical equations ( eq .",
    "[ eq : cavp+ ] with the noise terms dropped ) must be the actual mean - field solutions , and the second is that the drift matrix in the resulting equation for the ornstein - uhlenbeck process must not have any negative real parts to its eigenvalues .",
    "these conditions are known to occur with intracavity parametric processes , with the first being violated in the self - pulsing regime of second harmonic generation  @xcite and the second being a problem at the critical operating point of the optical parametric oscillator  @xcite . in order to check the stability we first turn to solving the steady - state equations for the mean fields .",
    "although in general not possible , we can find analytical solutions for the steady states in the case where we set the pumping strengths equal , with @xmath50 , and the two low frequency loss rates also equal , with @xmath51 .",
    "although achieving equal loss rates may not be so simple in the laboratory , it is useful here in order to gain some insight . with these values",
    "set equal , the two low frequency modes will have equal amplitudes with @xmath52 , which leads to a cubic equation for @xmath53 ( note that we will now drop the superscripts for notational convenience ) , @xmath54 along with a simple expression for @xmath55 , @xmath56 we note that there is no divergence here in the value of @xmath55 since the high frequency field amplitude is negative in the steady state . without setting these loss and pumping rates equal , it is much more difficult to find analytical solutions , although we can proceed via numerics , which we will do later in order to examine the effects of asymmetry . in the present case where the cavity is triply resonant , @xmath57 will be the real solution of eq .",

    "we will examine the quantum correlations in the stable region of the parameter space .",
