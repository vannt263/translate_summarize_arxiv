    "<S> the electronic raman scattering has been investigated in optimally oxygen doped yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 single crystals as well as in crystals with non - magnetic , zn , and magnetic , ni , impurities . </S>",
    "<S> we found that the intensity of the a@xmath3 peak is impurity independent and their energy to @xmath4 ratio is almost constant ( @xmath5 ) . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the signal at the b@xmath3 channel is completely smeared out when non - magnetic zn impurities are present . </S>",
    "<S> these results are qualitatively interpreted in terms of the zeyher and greco s theory that relates the electronic raman scattering in the a@xmath3 and b@xmath3 channels to _ d_-cdw and superconducting order parameters fluctuations , respectively .    </S>",
    "<S> far a long time , the phenomenon of high-@xmath4 superconductivity in the cuprates has been considered as related to an unconventional pairing state.@xcite it is widely accepted that the unconventional mechanism in these materials is closely related to their normal state properties , e.g. , the non - fermi - liquid behavior,@xcite in spite of the lack of consensus about the correct description of this state . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of several kinds of fluctuations , such as spin , flux phases , stripes or charge density waves ( cdw ) is an additional complication@xcite and many models considering one or more of these fluctuations have been proposed . </S>",
    "<S> however , there is a large amount of experimental data that these models can not explain ( see , e.g. , sections 5.4 and 6.4 of refs.@xcite and @xcite , respectively ) . among these data </S>",
    "<S> we mention the absence of a convincent explanation for the electronic raman scattering ( ers ) of many cuprates in the superconducting state .    </S>",
    "<S> the redistribution of the ers in the superconducting state has been used to study the gap order parameter in many superconductors , both conventional or unconventional , such as nb@xmath1sn,@xcite cuprates,@xcite borocarbides@xcite and recently , mgb@xmath0.@xcite in general , the ers of the cuprates presents two characteristic peaks in the b@xmath3 and a@xmath6b@xmath7 channels in the superconducting phase that disappear above @xmath4 . in the yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 ( y123 ) </S>",
    "<S> system the ers of optimally doped crystals has shown the a@xmath3 peak stronger than the b@xmath3 counterpart . </S>",
    "<S> also , the maximum intensity of the a@xmath3 peak lies at a lower energy than that of the b@xmath3 one.@xcite in the overdoped state , the b@xmath3 peak shifts down converging approximately to the same position of the a@xmath3 peak@xcite while in the strongly underdoped regime neither a@xmath3 nor b@xmath3 peaks are observed .    </S>",
    "<S> the appearance of these peaks only below @xmath4 , leads one to believe that they are related to the superconductivity , probably being pair - breaking peaks . </S>",
    "<S> some publications@xcite have already shown that , for a gap with nodes and @xmath8 order parameter at low energies , the ers efficiency obeys the @xmath9 and @xmath10 power - laws in the b@xmath3 and a@xmath11b@xmath7 channels , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> besides , these works have predicted that the a@xmath3 peak should be weaker than the b@xmath3 component with their maxima appearing at the same energy @xmath12 . in spite of the good agreement between the theory and the experimentally observed power laws , the relative position and intensity of the ers peaks are in disagreement with the theoretically expected results for the pair - breaking ers response . </S>",

    "<S> it is known that substituting cu by zn or ni in y123 preserves the oxygen doping level and modify only slightly the crystal structure . </S>",
    "<S> also , the non - magnetic zn@xmath16 impurities , contrary to the magnetic ni@xmath16 ones , restore significant spin fluctuations in the normal state.@xcite since the presence of impurities in the cuo@xmath0 planes are known to induce a pair - breaking effect,@xcite the investigation of the change in the electronic properties by introducing magnetic and non - magnetic impurities can give an important insight into the open questions related to the physics of the cuprates .    </S>",

    "<S> the laser power at the sample was kept below @xmath22 mw on a spot diameter of about @xmath23 @xmath24 m . </S>",
    "<S> the samples were cooled in an exchange he gas variable temperature cryostat , and measured in a near - backscattering configuration on the @xmath25plane . for the tetragonal symmetry @xmath26 , the choice of the @xmath27 geometry probes a combination of the a@xmath3 and @xmath28 symmetries , while choosing the @xmath29 geometry couples to excitations of b@xmath3 symmetry . </S>",

    "<S> 1(a ) the spectrum for y123 at @xmath34 k displays a flat background and just below t@xmath35 k starts the rearrangement of the electronic background , resulting in a broad peak in the spectral range between @xmath36 and @xmath37 @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> the same behavior is also found in fig.1 ( b ) for y123:ni . </S>",
    "<S> however , in this case the rearrangement of the ers starts only below @xmath23 k , producing a broad peak located in the same spectral range as far the pure sample . for y123:zn , fig.1(c ) , </S>",

    "<S> , it starts below @xmath42 k and it appears in the @xmath43 to @xmath44 @xmath38 spectral range . for y123:ni , fig.2(b ) , the broad peak first appears below @xmath45 k and it is also located in the @xmath43 to @xmath44 @xmath38 spectral range . </S>",
    "<S> surprisingly , for y123:zn , fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2(c ) , the rearrangement of the ers is absent below @xmath4 . </S>",

    "<S> we notice that the a@xmath3 energy to @xmath4 ratio @xmath50 is @xmath51 for y123 , @xmath52 for y123:ni , and @xmath53 for y123:zn . </S>",
    "<S> as commented above , at @xmath34 k , the superconducting rearrangement of the ers is absent and the raman spectra present no pronounced peak .    </S>",
    "<S> figure 4 shows the pure ers for the b@xmath3 channel at @xmath22 and @xmath34 k. the dramatic difference between the response of y123:zn compared with that of the other crystals is evident . </S>",
    "<S> the peak is absent in y123:zn but it appears centered around @xmath54 @xmath38 in y123 and y123:ni . </S>",
    "<S> the ratio @xmath55 is @xmath56 for y123 and @xmath57 for y123:ni . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the ers spectrum in y123:zn is almost the same at @xmath22 and @xmath34 k being also very similar to those in y123 and y123:ni at @xmath34 k , except for a small difference in the absolute value of the intensities .    </S>",
    "<S> observation of fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 and 4 indicates that the zn substitution affects the a@xmath6b@xmath7 and b@xmath3 channels in a quite different way . while in the a@xmath6b@xmath7 channel the intensities of the peaks are almost unaffected by the impurities , in the b@xmath3 channel the peak is smeared out in the zn - doped sample . </S>",
    "<S> the comparison between the b@xmath3 channel signals at @xmath22 and @xmath34 k in y123:zn indicates that the ers in the superconducting and normal states are nearly the same . </S>",
    "<S> this unusual effect of zn substitution on the b@xmath3 raman response is surprising and has not been predicted by any theoretical model nor been observed by other systematic experimental work . </S>",
    "<S> another relevant result is the almost constant energy to @xmath4 ratio @xmath58 for the a@xmath3 peak for all samples . </S>",
    "<S> this value is in agreement with previous values obtained for the a@xmath3 peak@xcite and for the superconducting gap measured by electron tunneling spectroscopy in y123.@xcite    recently , venturini et al@xcite and zeyher and greco @xcite have discussed theoretically the ers in the superconducting phase of high-@xmath4 cuprates .    </S>",
    "<S> the work of venturini et al.@xcite presents a model suggesting that the observed peak in the a@xmath3 + b@xmath7 channel is produced by collective spin fluctuations , being a two - magnon raman peak . in the same model , the b@xmath3 peak </S>",
    "<S> is related to pair breaking . </S>",
    "<S> they were able to fit the experimental raman spectrum of bi2212 to their model and obtained the correct relative position of the a@xmath3 and b@xmath3 peaks.@xcite moreover , gallais et al.@xcite have shown that the a@xmath3 peak tracks the magnetic resonance peak observed by inelastic neutron scattering@xcite at 40 @xmath59 in ni - substituted yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath60 . </S>",
    "<S> these authors have interpreted this fact as an evidence for the magnetic origin of the a@xmath3 peak .    </S>",
    "<S> however , our results can not be interpreted in these terms . </S>",
    "<S> the main reason is the strong zn - impurity dependency observed in the b@xmath3 spectra . in the venturini s framework </S>",
    "<S> the b@xmath3 peak is related to pair - breaking process with their maximum at @xmath12 energy . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the complete smearing out of the b@xmath3 peak observed in our experiments ( see fig </S>",
    "<S> . 4 c ) would imply that @xmath61 for the zn - substituted crystal . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is known that @xmath4 does not go to zero in this case and , discharging any anomalous behavior of the @xmath62 ratio , @xmath63 . </S>",
    "<S> futhermore , the @xmath64 ratio for the a@xmath3 peak presents better agreement to the gap energy measured by others groups ( see , e.g. , ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) than the b@xmath3 one , indicating that the a@xmath3 ers peak is related to pair - breaking .    </S>",
    "<S> another possible theoretical comparison could be made with the zeyher and grecos@xcite theory . </S>",
    "<S> these authors used the superconducting model by cappelluti and zeyher@xcite in order to understand the ers of cuprates . </S>",
    "<S> the cappelluti and zeyher model proposed that the superconductivity in cuprates is originated by the competition between the superconducting and the _ d_-cdw ( also called orbital antiferromagnetism ) order parameters . </S>",
    "<S> zeyher and greco@xcite suggested that the a@xmath3 and b@xmath3 peaks are caused by amplitude fluctuations of the superconducting and _ d_-cdw order parameters , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the _ d_-cdw phase corresponds to a flux phase where current flows around each cuo@xmath0 square alternatively clockwise and counterclockwise@xcite giving rise to orbital antiferromagnetism where the only interaction present in the order parameter is the heisenberg exchange coupling between the cu@xmath16 ions.@xcite    as mentioned above , our experimental data indicates that the a@xmath3 peak is related to pair - breaking . in this sense , </S>",
    "<S> our experimental ers results give support to the zeyher and greco s theory . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , the impurity effect on the _ d_-cdw b@xmath3 peak is not well theoretically understood at the moment . </S>",
    "<S> cappelluti and zeyher@xcite have shown that the zn impurities substitution does not have appreciable influence on the oxygen doping phase diagram of the cuprates . however , the effect on the b@xmath3 ers signal could be more subtle and a more detailed theoretical calculation could be used .    </S>",
    "<S> nonetheless , qualitatively we can elaborate about the impurity substitution effect on b@xmath3 signal as follows . </S>",
    "<S> it is known that the main interaction originating the _ d_-cdw is the heisenberg coupling between the cu@xmath16 spins . </S>",
    "<S> thus , it is expected that the cu@xmath16 ( @xmath65 ) substitution by zn@xmath16 ( @xmath66 ) impurity , would break down the long range coherence of the orbital antiferromagnetism , explaining the disappearence of the _ d_-cdw excitation in the b@xmath3 channel . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , this is consistent with the larger depletion of @xmath4 just produced by the presence of zn@xmath16 impurities.@xcite besides , the ni@xmath16 ( @xmath67 ) impurities could be less effective in breaking down the orbital antiferromagnetism notwithstanding having also effect in decreasing @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , as shown by gupta and gupta@xcite the charge density redistribution due to the ni@xmath16 ions is localized while the zn@xmath16 perform an extended perturbation . on this basis </S>",
    "<S> , one would expect that the zn@xmath16 ions would be more effective on reducing the _ d_-cdw excitations .    in conclusion , </S>",
    "<S> our results show that the a@xmath3 ers peak present a constant gap to @xmath4 ratio @xmath58 independent of the presence of magnetic or non - magnetic impurities . </S>",
    "<S> also , the b@xmath3 ers peak is smeared out in the y123 when the cu@xmath16 is substituted by small amount of non - magnetic zn impurities whereas the a@xmath6b@xmath7 spectra remain insensitive to the kind of impurity . </S>",
    "<S> these results could be qualitatively interpreted in terms of the of zeyher and grecos@xcite theory that relates the ers in the a@xmath3 and b@xmath3 channels to _ d_-cdw and superconducting order parameters fluctuations , respectively . </S>"
