    "diffuse backgrounds contain important information about the history of the early universe , when discrete objects either did not exist or are not accessible to telescopic studies .",
    "the cosmic infrared background ( cib ) arises from accumulated emissions from early galaxy populations spanning a large range of redshifts .",
    "the earliest epoch for the production of this background occurred when star formation first began , and contributions to the cib continued through the present epoch .",
    "the cib is thus an integrated summary of the collective star forming events , star - burst activity and other luminous events in cosmic history to the present time .",
    "as photons move to observer they lose energy to cosmic expansion and any stellar emission from high redshift populations will now be seen in the infrared ( mostly near - ir with @xmath6 a few , unless it comes from very cold stars at very high @xmath0 ) .",
    "emission from galactic dust will be shifted to still longer ir wavelengths .",
    "cib thus probes the physics in he universe between the present epoch and the last scattering surface and is complementary to its more famous cousin , the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmb ) which probes mainly the physics at the last scattering .",
    "considerable effort has now gone into studying the luminosity sources during the most recent history of the universe ( @xmath7 ) , but the period from recombination to the redshift of the hubble deep field ( hdf ) remains largely an unexplored era because of the difficulty of detecting many distant galaxies over large areas of the sky .",
    "significant progress in finding high redshift galaxies has been achieved using the lyman dropout technique ( steidel et al 1996 ) , but uncovering substantial populations of galaxies at @xmath8 is extremely difficult and the total sample is still very small .",
    "it is there that the cib measurements can provide critical information about the early history of the universe largely inaccessible to telescopic studies . at more recent epochs galaxy evolution",
    "is also constrained by the measurements of the visible part of the extragalactic background light or ebl ( bernstein et al 2002a , b ; cf .",
    "mattila 2003 ) .",
    "chronologically , the importance of the cib and early predictions about its levels ( partridge & peebles 1968 ) followed the discovery of the cmb which observationally established the big bang model for the origin and evolution of the universe . because of the earth s atmosphere is was clear from the start that the measurement of the cib must be done from space and even there the solar system and galactic foregrounds presented a formidable challenge .",
    "it took a while for technology to reach the required sensitivity and , when the first rocket and space based cib measurements were conducted , the results were inconclusive ( matsumoto , akiba & murakami 1988 , noda et al 1992 ) .",
    "following its launch in 1983 the iras satellite was the first to conduct all - sky infrared measurements of point sources between 12 and 100 ( soifer , neugebauer & houck 1987 ) .",
    "it revealed that galaxies were efficient infrared emitters , but its design was not optimized for diffuse background measurements .",
    "the cobe dirbe instrument , launched in 1990 , operated between 1.25 and 240 and was the first to be devoted specifically to cib measurements ( hauser & dwek 2001 ) .",
    "it led to the first reliable measurements of and limits on the cib over a wide range of infrared bands and literally began the observational cib era .",
    "the status of the cib measurements in the immediate post - dirbe era has been reviewed extensively by hauser & dwek ( 2001 ) and a slightly earlier review by leinert et al ( 1998 ) has provided a detailed discussion of the issues involved in measuring the extragalactic background light ( ebl ) levels . since then several important developments happened , most notably the establishment , through cmb measurements , of the standard cosmological model for the overall evolution of the universe , particularly the existence of the so - called dark energy , and of the standard paradigm ( @xmath9cdm ) for structure formation .",
    "cmb polarization measurements have identified the epoch of re - ionization , presumably due to first collapsed objects in the universe .",
    "this now allows narrowing of cib predictions and puts refined searches for the cib on a much firmer basis .",
    "also , in the cib context , several new measurements have now been accomplished and several old ones are now more firmly confirmed .",
    "scientific exploration is never static and the very recently ( august 2003 ) launched nasa spitzer satellite already led to several important findings for cib and many more are expected to follow as spitzer observational programs get implemented .",
    "new space instruments in the ir and sub - mm bands are planned by nasa and esa which will shed new light on the early universe and the interconnection between the cib and early luminous systems .",
    "this thus seems like an opportune moment for a new attempt to review the cib measurements and their interpretation .    indeed , following the wmap and balloon experiments we now know that the universe is flat and dominated by the vacuum energy ( cosmological constant ) and/or even more exotic quintessence field .",
    "the recent wmap results ( bennett et al 2003 , spergel et al 2003 ) imply that the universe had a large optical depth since last scattering ( @xmath10 ) indicating unexpectedly early star formation ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "direct deep studies of the universe at @xmath122 - 3 show that much of the luminosity of the universe at that time was probably involved in the process of galaxy formation , and the birth of the first generations of stars .",
    "many systems , such as elliptical galaxies , already seem well - formed by the epoch of the hdf , and the metallicities for many systems are already near solar .",
    "somewhere between @xmath13 and @xmath14 reside the systems made up of the first population of stars , the so - called zero - metallicity population iii , about which little is known observationally .",
    "all these galaxies should have left their imprint in the cib and its structure .",
    "observationally , the cib is difficult to distinguish from the generally brighter foregrounds contributed by the local matter within the solar system , and the stars and ism of the galaxy .",
    "a number of investigations have attempted to extract the isotropic component ( mean level ) of the cib from ground- and satellite - based data as described below .",
    "this has in nearly all instances been a complicated task due to a lack of detailed knowledge of the absolute brightness levels and spatial variations across the sky for the many foregrounds that overlay the cib signal .",
    "it is thus very important to understand and estimate to high accuracy the various foreground emissions which need to subtracted or removed before uncovering the cib .",
    "the outline of this review is as follows : in sec .",
    "2 we start with a summary of the units , the various relevant astronomical magnitude systems and the list of frequent abbreviations used throughout the review .",
    "3 discusses theoretical basis for cib and its structure and how these are related to information on the early galaxies and stellar systems .",
    "4 reviews the foregrounds that inhibit the cib measurements and sec .",
    "5 reviews the status of the current cib measurements . in sec .",
    "6 we discuss the topics related to cib measurements and their interpretation such as the contribution from ordinary galaxies composed of population i and ii stars , the role of star formation , dust , the current status of the present day galaxy luminosity density measurements , and the deep galaxy counts from near - ir to far - ir .",
    "7 is devoted to the signature of population iii in the cib and its structure and the almost unique role cib plays in uncovering the population iii era .",
    "we end up with a review of the currently planned instruments and space missions that will or can have direct bearing on the cib in sec . 8 followed by a summary section .",
    "we start with definitions .",
    "the surface brightness of the cib per unit wavelength will be denoted as @xmath15 , per unit frequency as @xmath16 , and per logarithmic wavelength interval @xmath17 , and we call them all `` flux . '' throughout the paper @xmath18 will denote the planck black - body function per unit frequency .",
    "fluxes of astronomical sources are often measured in narrow band filters .",
    "the flux units commonly used in astronomy for @xmath16 are jy=@xmath19 w / m@xmath3/hz .",
    "the surface brightness of the cib is usually given in units of either mjy / sr or 2sr .",
    "the conversion between the two is : @xmath20    the range of wavelengths used in this review is divided into the following groups : near - infrared ( nir ) covers 1 @xmath21 510 .",
    "mid - infrared ( mir ) is defined to lie in 510 @xmath22 50100 range .",
    "we call the far - infrared ( fir ) the region corresponding to 50100 @xmath23 500 , and beyond that will be sometimes referred to as sub - mm .",
    "these definitions are neither exact nor unique and , although the band ranges cover ( largely ) different physical processes , this division is used for convenience only .",

    "vega s magnitudes are zero in all filters . however , because of uncertainties in the absolute flux calibration of vega , magnitudes of this star have been slightly corrected over time .",
    "the zero point of ab magnitude system is constant flux of 3631 jy for apparent brightness ( oke & gunn 1983 ) .",
    "thus in ab magnitude system an object with @xmath27constant ( flat energy distribution ) has the same magnitude in all bands , and all colors are zero . for the wavelengths used frequently in the paper the conversion",

    "the near - ir cib arises mainly from the stellar component of galaxies and probes evolution of stellar component of galaxies at early times .",
    "the mid- and far - ir cib originates from dusty galaxies reprocessing stellar light and other energetic output . as will be discussed in sec . 5 , the recent mutually consistent detections of the near - ir cib from the cobe / dirbe and japan s irts datasets ( see hauser & dwek 2001 for review ) indicated a surprisingly high amplitude of both the cib fluctuations ( kashlinsky & odenwald 2000a , matsumoto et al 2000,2002 ) and mean levels ( dwek & arendt 1998 , gorjian & wright 2000 , wright & reese 2000 , cambresy et al 2001 ) . in the mid - ir firm",
    "upper limits on the cib have been found by various indirect methods , but because foreground emission is so high no direct detection has been possible . in the far - ir",
    "there are mutually consistent detections of the cib from the dirbe ( schlegel et al 1998 , hauser et al 1998 ) and firas ( puget et al 1996 , fixsen et al 1998 ) datasets .    in this section",
    "we provide a general mathematical and observational basis for the underlying parameters and physics that determine the cib and its structure .",
    "specific cosmological and galaxy evolution models are mentioned only briefly ( sec .",
    "3.4 ) and we attempt to make the discussion as general as possible .      in the friedman - robertson - walker universe with flat geometry and the robertson - walker metric , @xmath28 $ ] , the comoving volume occupied by a unit solid angle in the redshift interval @xmath29 is @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the luminosity distance .",
    "thus the flux density in band @xmath24 from each galaxy with absolute bolometric luminosity @xmath32 at redshift @xmath0 is @xmath33 . here",
    "@xmath34 is the fraction of the total light emitted in the wavelength interval @xmath35 $ ] and the extra factor of @xmath36 in the denominator accounts for the fact that the flux received in band @xmath24 comes from a redshifted galaxy .",
    "the contribution to the total cib flux from the redshift interval @xmath29 is given by @xmath37 , \\label{dfdz}\\ ] ] where the sum is taken over all galaxy populations contributing flux in the observer rest - frame band at @xmath24 , and @xmath38 characterizes the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of galaxy population @xmath39 . here",
    "@xmath40 and the ( present - day ) luminosity density is given by : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the ( present - day)luminosity function or the number density of galaxies of morphological type @xmath39 in the @xmath43 interval at frequency band @xmath44 .",
    "it is illustrative to study the redshift dependence of the flux production rate , eq .",
    "( [ dfdz ] ) . at small redshifts",
    "the factor @xmath45 varies little with @xmath0 , and the flux production rate , @xmath46 , is governed by the comoving bolometric luminosity density @xmath47 and the sed of the galaxy emission @xmath38 .",
    "if the luminosity evolution at these redshifts is small , the flux production rate is governed by the sed shape .",
    "if @xmath48 increases toward shorter wavelengths then @xmath46 increases with @xmath0 . for @xmath49 const , and no luminosity evolution ,",
    "the rate is roughly constant with small @xmath0 . at sufficiently high redshifts , modest luminosity evolution in eq .",
    "( [ dfdz ] ) would be offset by the factor @xmath45 , so that the flux production rate would be cut off at sufficiently large @xmath0 .",
    "this factor is responsible for resolving olbers paradox even for a flat sed .",
    "there are three broad parameters that determine the possible modes of galaxy evolution at higher redshifts : 1 ) how bright individual galaxies shine ( luminosity evolution ) , 2 ) their spectral energy distribution ( sed ) which determines how much of the luminosity was emitted at the rest frame of the galaxy ( k - correction ) , and 3 ) how numerous the galaxies were ( number density evolution ) .",
    "consequently , one can separate the @xmath0-dependence in @xmath50 into terms due to k - correction ( @xmath51 ) , pure luminosity evolution ( @xmath52 ) and pure number density evolution ( @xmath53 ) ( e.g. yoshii & takahara 1988 ) , i.e. @xmath54 } { \\cal l}_{\\nu}(0 ) \\label{lumden}\\ ] ] then the total cib flux emitted by evolving galaxy populations becomes : @xmath55 where @xmath56 is given by eq .",
    "[ rdot ] with the expansion factor @xmath57 .",
    "the details of galaxy spectral energy distributions ( sed ) will be discussed later , but a simple analysis can already be made using eq .",
    "( [ dfdz ] ) .",
    "the sed at rest - frame wavelengths @xmath58  is dominated by stellar emission , with a peak at visible wavelengths and a decrease for @xmath59 .",
    "consequently , assuming no - evolution would mean that most of the predicted j band cib comes from redshifts @xmath60 , which shifts the visible emission of normal stellar populations to @xmath61 . in the m band at 5 ,",
    "most of the predicted cib comes from @xmath62 .",
    "evolution will likely push these redshift ranges toward earlier times . at 10 @xmath63 , the emission is dominated by galactic dust and the situation is reversed , so @xmath38 increases with wavelength roughly as @xmath64 with @xmath65 .",
    "hence , the dusty star - burst galaxies observed by iras at low redshifts should make the dominant contribution to the 10  cib . in the far - ir ,",
    "the k - correction is strongly negative ( sec .",
    "6.3 ) and the measured cib found can have large contributions from high redshifts .",
    "it is useful to make a simple estimate of the expected cib flux .",
    "measurements of the galaxy luminosity function in both optical ( loveday et al 1992 ; blanton et al 2001 ) and near - ir ( gardner et al 1997 ; kochanek et al 2003 , ; cole et al 2003 ) indicate approximately that the density of bright galaxies is @xmath66 .",
    "each of these galaxies emits in the rough neighborhood of @xmath67 w. the flux - dimensional quantity composed of @xmath68 and the hubble constant is @xmath69 2sr .",
    "this is a crude estimate , but it already shows that in order to measure reliably the mean levels of the cib , foregrounds must be eliminated to well below @xmath70 2sr levels .",
    "section 4 shows how difficult a task that is in the infrared bands .",
    "because of the difficulty of accurately accounting for the contributions of bright foregrounds such as galactic stars , interplanetary and interstellar dust , which must be subtracted from the observed sky background ( arendt et al , 1998 , kelsall et al , 1998 ) , kashlinsky , mather , odenwald & hauser ( 1996 ) have proposed to measure the structure of the cib or its fluctuations spectrum . for a relatively conservative set of assumptions about clustering of distant galaxies , fluctuations in the brightness of the cib",
    "have a distinct spectral and spatial signal , and these signals can be more readily discerned than the actual mean level of the cib .",
    "the most common source of luminosity in the universe arises in galaxies , whose clustering properties at the present times are fairly well known and are consistent with the @xmath9cdm model predictions ( efstathiou , sutherland & maddox 1990 , percival et al 2002 , tegmark et al 2004 ) .",
    "the cib , being produced by clustered matter , must have fluctuations that reflect the clustered nature of the underlying sources of luminosity .",
    "this signature will have an angular correlation function ( or angular power spectrum ) that distinguishes it from local sources of background emission such as zodiacal light emission , and foreground stars in the milky way . moreover",
    ", distant contributions of cib will have a different redshift , and therefore spectral color , than nearby galaxies and sources of local emission . from galaxy evolution and cluster evolution models it is possible to match the predicted slopes for the power spectrum of the cib against the power spectrum of the data .",
    "on the largest angular scales ( the dipole component ) , there would be an additional source of anisotropy due to our peculiar motion with respect to the inertial frame of the universe",
    ". this component may be measurable over a certain range of wavelengths and is discussed after the more canonical source of cib anisotropies , the galaxy clustering .",
    "whenever cib studies encompass relatively small parts of the sky ( angular scales @xmath71 sr ) one can use cartesian formulation of the fourier analysis .",
    "the fluctuation in the cib surface brightness can be defined as @xmath72 , where @xmath73 , @xmath74 is the two dimensional coordinate on the sky and @xmath75 is the ensemble average .",
    "the two - dimensional fourier transform is @xmath76 .",
    "if the fluctuation field , @xmath77 , is a random variable , then it can be described by the moments of its probability distribution function .",
    "the first non - trivial moment is the projected 2-dimensional correlation function @xmath78 .",
    "the 2-dimensional power spectrum is @xmath79 , where the average is performed over all phases .",
    "the correlation function and the power spectrum are a pair of 2-dimensional fourier transforms and for an isotropically distributed signal are related by @xmath80 @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the @xmath83-th order cylindrical bessel function . if the phases are random , then the distribution of the brightness is gaussian and the correlation function ( or its fourier transform , the power spectrum ) uniquely describes its statistics . in measurements with a finite beam , the intrinsic power spectrum is multiplied by the window function @xmath84 of the instrument .",
    "conversely , for the known beam window function , the power spectrum can be de - convolved by dividing the measured power spectrum by the beam window function .",
    "another useful and related quantity is the mean square fluctuation within a finite beam of angular radius @xmath85 , or zero - lag correlation signal , which is related to the power spectrum by @xmath86 for a top - hat beam the window function is @xmath87 ^ 2=0.5 $ ] at @xmath88 where @xmath89 , and hence the values of @xmath90 correspond to fluctuations on angular scales of diameter @xmath91 .    at small angles @xmath92 sr ,",
    "the cib power spectrum is related to the cib flux production rate , @xmath46 , and the evolving 3-d power spectrum of galaxy clustering , @xmath93 via the limber equation . in the power spectrum formulation",
    "it can be written as ( e.g. kashlinsky & odenwald 2000 ) : @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the angular diameter distance and the integration is over the epoch of the sources contributing to the cib .",
    "[ limber_z ] can be rewritten as : @xmath96 this is equivalent to : @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the time - length of the period over which the cib is produced and @xmath99 is the fluctuation in number of sources within a volume @xmath100 .",
    "defined by eq .",
    "[ delta3 ] and used throughout the review should not be confused with another quantity - @xmath101 - sometimes encountered in the literature under the same symbol . ]    to within a factor of order unity , the square of the fractional fluctuation of the cib on angular scale @xmath91 is @xmath102 .",
    "the meaning of eq .",
    "[ limber_del2 ] becomes obvious if we assume @xmath103=constant during the lifetime of the emitters @xmath98 . in this case",
    "the fractional fluctuation due to clustering of early galaxies becomes : @xmath104 in other words , the fractional fluctuation on angular scale @xmath105 in the cib is given by the average value of the r.m.s .",
    "fluctuation from spatial clustering over a cylinder of length @xmath106 and diameter @xmath107 .",
    "the cartesian formulation is equivalent to the spherical sky representation used in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) studies on small scales .",
    "it was used in some cib analyses ( haiman & knox 2000 , cooray et al 2003 ) . in that case one",
    "expands the flux into spherical harmonics : @xmath108 .",
    "the correlation function of the cib , @xmath109 , is then @xmath110 with @xmath111 , is the two - dimensional fourier transform of @xmath112 and for @xmath113 is related to the multipoles via @xmath114 .",
    "this follows because at @xmath115 the legendre polynomials can be approximated as bessel functions , @xmath116 .",
    "the magnitude of the cib fluctuation on scale @xmath117 radian for large @xmath118 is then @xmath119 . in the limit of small angles ( @xmath120 ) the values of @xmath121 s",
    "are related to the power spectrum of galaxy clustering and the cib flux production rate via : @xmath122    in surveys with arcsec angular resolution it is possible to identify and remove galaxies brighter than some limiting magnitude , @xmath123 . because on average fainter galaxies are at higher @xmath0 , by improving sensitivity and angular resolution",
    ", one can isolate contributions to the cib fluctuations from progressively earlier epochs ( kashlinsky et al 2002 ) .",
    "the luminosity density , @xmath124 , is then peaked at some particular redshift - at lower @xmath0 the ( brighter than apparent magnitude @xmath123 ) galaxies are removed and at larger redshifts the luminosity density gets dominated by the bright end of the luminosity function with a sharp drop - off in the galaxy number density .",
    "the following toy model is useful in estimating the effect : in the visible to near - ir bands the present day galaxy luminosity function is of the schechter ( 1976 ) form @xmath125 . measurements of the galaxy luminosity function from b to k bands indicate that within the statistical uncertainties @xmath126 ( loveday et al 1992 , gardner et al 1997 ) , leading to @xmath127)$ ] .",
    "this then defines the redshift window in eqs .",
    "[ limber],[lumden ] which contributes most to the power spectrum of the cib .",
    "contribution from low @xmath0 galaxies , for which @xmath128 is @xmath129 . in practice",
    "the typical redshift at which most of the contribution arises can be estimated as @xmath130 .",
    "if one can further remove galaxies lying in narrow bins , @xmath131 , around progressively fainter apparent magnitude @xmath123 , one can hope to isolate contributions to the cib by epoch ( kashlinsky 1992 , kashlinsky et al 2002 ) .",
    "in addition to fluctuations from galaxy clustering there would also be a shot - noise component arising from discrete galaxies occasionally entering the beam",
    ". the relative amplitude of these shot noise fluctuations will be @xmath132 where @xmath133 is the average number of galaxies in the beam .",
    "this component is important in surveys with good angular resolution where @xmath134 a few .",
    "if galaxies are removed down to some magnitude @xmath135 , the shot noise contribution from the remaining sources to the flux variance , @xmath136 , in measurements with beam of the area @xmath137 steradian is given by : @xmath138 here @xmath139 is the flux from galaxy of magnitude @xmath135 and @xmath140 is the number of galaxies per steradian in the magnitude bin @xmath141 .",
    "fourier amplitudes of the shot noise are scale - independent and equation [ c0 ] implies that the shot noise contribution to the power spectrum of the cib would be given by : @xmath142 because galaxy clustering has power spectrum that increases towards large scales , the shot noise component becomes progressively more important at smaller angular scales .",
    "any measurement of the angular power spectrum will be affected by the sample or cosmic variance in much the same way as the cosmic microwave background measurement ( abbot & wise 1984 ) .",
    "this results from the fact that in the best of situations we can only observe @xmath143 steradian leading to poor sampling of the long wavelength modes .",
    "if the power spectrum is determined from fraction @xmath144 of the sky by sampling in concentric rings of width @xmath145 in angular wavenumber space , the relative uncertainty on @xmath146 will be @xmath147 , where @xmath148 is the number of ring elements in @xmath149 $ ] interval .",
    "therefore , the relative uncertainty from cosmic variance in the measured power spectrum on scale @xmath150 will be : @xmath151 in order to get reliable and independent measurements at a given scale , it is useful to have narrow band @xmath152 . therefore , for reliable measurements on scales up to @xmath153 , one has to cover an area a few times larger .",
    "the dipole anisotropy of the cib arises from our local motion with respect to the inertial frame of the universe , rather than galaxy clustering .",

    "this section discusses the current observational status of both the mean cib levels and its structure ( fluctuations ) .",
    "observationally , the cib is difficult to distinguish from the generally brighter foregrounds contributed by the local matter within the solar system , and the stars and ism of the galaxy .",
    "a number of investigations have attempted to extract the isotropic component ( mean level ) of the cib from ground- and satellite - based data .",
    "these analyses of the _ cobe _ data have revealed the cib at far - ir wavelengths @xmath262(hauser et al 1998 ) , and probably at near - ir wavelengths from 1 - 3   ( dwek & arendt 1998 , gorjian et al 2001 , cambresy et al 2001 ) with additional support from analysis of data from _ irts _ ( matsumoto et al 2000 , 2003 ) .",
    "however , it would probably be fair to say that none of the reported detections of the isotropic cib are very robust ( especially in the nir ) , because all are dominated by the systematic uncertainties associated with the modeling and removal of the strong foreground emission of the zodiacal light and galactic stars and ism . furthermore , the near - ir colors of the mean cib do not differ greatly from those of the foregrounds , thus limiting the use of spectral information in distinguishing the true cib from residual galactic or solar system emission .    in order to avoid the difficulty of exactly accounting for the contributions of these bright foregrounds in direct cib measurements , ( and the difficulty in detecting _ all _ the contributing sources individually ) , kashlinsky , mather , odenwald and hauser ( 1996 ) have proposed measuring the structure or anisotropy of the cib via its angular power spectrum .",
    "they noted that for a relatively conservative set of assumptions about clustering of distant galaxies , fluctuations in the brightness of the cib have a distinct spectral and spatial signal , and these signals can be perhaps more readily discerned than the actual mean level of the cib .",

    "its cryogenic stage lasted from november 1989 to september 1990 collecting 41 weeks of data .",
    "absolute photometry was obtained through frequent ( 32 hz ) chopping between the sky and an internal zero flux surface maintained at temperatures below 2 k. system response was monitored every 20 minutes throughout the 10 month mission by observing an internal thermal reference source .",
    "the dirbe was designed to achieve a zero - point to the photometric scale with an uncertainty below @xmath263 at all wavelengths ; tests conducted prior to launch and in flight indicate that this goal was indeed reached .",
    "absolute calibration of the dirbe photometric scale , and long - term photometric consistency , was established by monitoring a network of stable celestial sources .",
    "the primary calibrator for the @xmath264 , @xmath265 and @xmath32-bands was the star sirius .",

    "finkbeiner , schlegel & davis ( 1998 ) extended the analysis to the dirbe data at 60 and 100 .",
    "they applied two different methods to remove the zodiacal light component : the first of these methods used the north - south asymmetry with a 1 year period of the zodiacal component and concentrated on the data within @xmath275 of the ecliptic poles , where effects dependent on solar elongation cancel out .",
    "the method further assumed that the zodiacal light north - south asymmetry is the same in all bands .",
    "cirrus was taken from the 100  map produced in the schlegel et al ( 1998 ) analysis .",
    "they decomposed each of the north and south datasets into time - dependent ( zodi ) and time - independent ( cirrus , cib etc ) components and obtain robust solutions for the latter .",
    "in the second method they remove zodiacal component by using its dependence on the ecliptic latitude in each of the dirbe s 41 weeks of data with solar elongation 90@xmath276 .",
    "a statistic was then constructed that ratios the flux in the various diagonal directions to that toward the ecliptic poles and whose advantage is that it has a known dependence on the ecliptic latitude ( @xmath277 ) with a negligible annual variation . the cib flux was determined as a term at @xmath278 .",
    "both methods gave consistent and robust , if high compared to other measurements , levels of the cib at 60 and 100 .",
    "because of the difficulty in measuring the isotropic component of the cib , kashlinsky , mather , odenwald & hauser ( 1996 ) have proposed to probe the cib structure instead . for a reasonable set of assumptions about the underlying distribution of emitters / galaxies , the fluctuations in the cib can provide important information about the rate of production of the cib and luminous activity in the early universe .",
    "the method leads to particularly strong constraints at mid- to far - ir where the foregrounds are very smooth ( kashlinsky , mather & odenwald 1996 ) .",
    "the analysis , however , could not have been applied to the dirbe s longest channels ( 140 and 240 ) , which required the use of bolometers instead of the photoconductors , resulting in much larger noise than at shorter wavelengths .",
    "kashlinsky & odenwald ( 2000 ) have applied the method to the final dirbe data release leading to detection of the near - ir cib anisotropies .",

    "this technique was pushed farther by arendt & dwek ( 2003 ) attaining a more isotropic removal of galactic foregrounds , but at the expense of increased uncertainty in the absolute zero point .    in order to reduce the uncertainty in the galactic stars contribution to the nir dirbe maps , gorjian et al ( 2000 ) have imaged a high galactic latitude region of the sky of @xmath286 on the side in k and l bands with arcsec resolution to k@xmath287 and @xmath288 magnitudes reducing the stellar contribution to confusion noise a factor of @xmath289 below that of dirbe .",

    "surveys are planned to detect high redshift galaxies ( d. a. harper , private communication ) .",

    "the atacama large millimeter array ( alma ) in chile is planned as a synthesis radio telescope built in international collaboration between north america and europe which will operate at millimeter and sub - mm wavelengths .",
    "it will reach resolution of @xmath731 over fields of several square arcmin .      planned for the end of the next decade these prospective nasa missions will achieve both high angular resolution ( arcsecond to sub - arcsecond ) and high sensitivity ( @xmath732jy ) necessary to resolve and characterize most of the sources comprising the cosmic infrared background at far - ir and sub - mm wavelengths .",

    "the safir telescope will operate between 20 and 1 mm and will be cooled to about 5 k. the combination of large mirror size and cold temperature will make safir significantly more sensitive than the spitzer and herschel instruments with sensitivity limited only by the irreducible noise of photons in the astrophysical backgrounds .    in the community plan for far - ir /",
    "submillimiter space astronomy it is envisaged that safir will be followed by a kilometer baseline fir interferometer designed to provide both wide field - of - view imaging and spectroscopy .",
    "this interferometer is widely known as the sub - millimeter probe of the evolution of cosmic structure ( specs ) .",
    "safir and specs were selected for study under the ross / vision mission study program , and the space infrared interferometer telescope ( spirit ) , a science pathfinder for specs , was selected for study under the nasa ross origins science mission concept study program .",
    "these will be the first instruments that would achieve sub - arcsecond resolution at fir / sub - mm wavelengths and provide the @xmath254jy - level sensitivity over a field - of - view of @xmath372 1 arcmin@xmath3 ( leisawitz 2004 ) .",
    "all three observatories , in addition to high sensitivity and resolution , will have spectral resolution of the order of @xmath733 .",
    "cosmic infrared background presents a complementary , and sometimes the only , way to detect cumulative emission from galaxies at all cosmic times , including from objects inaccessible to current or future telescopic studies .",
    "thanks to better detector sensitivities and new measurement techniques it is now possible to identify and remove foreground emissions at ir wavelengths and begin to measure the cib . because of the difficulties in identifying the mean level of the cib in the presence of strong foreground emissions , it is often useful to attempt to measure the cib fluctuations spectrum .",
    "the latter also allows to isolate the contributions to the cib from progressively fainter galaxies and , on average , earlier cosmic epochs from surveys with @xmath372 arcsec angular resolution .",
    "we have reviewed how mean levels of the cib and , both the amplitude and the angular spectrum of , its anisotropies relate to the properties of the underlying galaxy populations .",
    "the various foreground contributions and the latest measurements of the mean cib and its fluctuations were summarized from the near - ir to sub - mm .",
    "there are mutually consistent detections of the mean levels and fluctuations of the cib in the near - ir , low upper limits in the mid - ir and detections of the mean cib in the far - ir longward of 100 .",
    "there are two broad classes of contributors to the cib : from ordinary ( metal rich ) stellar populations and from objects from the population iii era .",
    "the data on the present - day galaxy luminosity density present an important normalization point for interpretation of the cib measurements .",
    "we showed that by constructing realistic seds for the stellar component one can get a fair agreements between the different luminosity density measurements at various wavelengths .",
    "this implies that it is unlikely that significant flux is unaccounted for in galaxy measurements at different bands and with different instruments and methods , and the results are consistent with the independently derived measurements of the present - day stellar density parameter , @xmath734 . the same holds true at longer wavelengths where emission from dust is the dominant contributor .",
    "total flux from observed ordinary galaxy populations gives a lower limit on their contribution to the cib and can be estimated from a variety of galaxy counts data from the near - ir to sub - mm bands .",
    "we summarized such estimates based on various most recent measurements and conclude that 1 ) at far - ir wavelengths the observed background is most likely accounted for by the observed galaxy populations , which are probably located at @xmath735 ; 2 ) at mid - ir wavelengths the total fluxes saturate at levels which are just below the best current upper limits on the cib and probably account for at least a large fraction of the cib ; 3 ) at near - ir wavelengths the total contributions from the observed galaxy population saturate at levels significantly lower than the claimed detections of the cib mean levels and anisotropies .",
    "the latter detections , if taken at face value , would indicate substantial contributions from much earlier epochs than probed by the observed faintest galaxy populations",
    ".    a plausible candidate to explain the excess in the near - ir cib would be emissions from population iii era objects .",
    "their expected contributions should have left a unique and observable signature in the spectrum of the cib anisotropies if population iii were massive stars as is currently expected .",
    "the contributions from the various foreground emissions are such that this signature can , and should be , observed with future space - based instruments and properly tuned observations .    finally , the current ( spitzer ) and planned space missions and new instruments in the ir and sub - mm are expected to bring a wealth of high quality observational data .",
    "this data can and , no doubt , will be used for further progress in the cib studies and in identifying the history of light emission from collapsed objects in the early universe .",
