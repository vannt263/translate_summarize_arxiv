    "team produces the internal linear combination ( ilc ) map and maps for the foregrounds ( synchrotron , free - free , dust emission ) for each k  w bands which are the basis for our analysis .",
    "homogeneous and isotropic cmb gaussian random fields , as a result of the simplest inflation paradigm , is a crucial test for the early stages of the cosmological expansion . because of the pronounced non - gaussianity of the foregrounds it would be natural to expect that possible non - gaussianity of the ilc and other cleaned maps derived from the _ wmap _ data would reflect directly contamination of the foregrounds at different levels .    in this letter",
    "we present the result of a statistical test of the coupling the ilc map and the foreground taking from the _ wmap _ data .",
    "the test is based on the circular cross - correlations analysis of the ilc and foregrounds phases .",
    "our method complementing the mentioned above ones , exploits a natural assumption that phases of the `` true '' cmb signal should not correlate with the phases of the foregrounds .",
    "this allows us to detect significant ilc``w band foregrounds '' cross - correlations .",
    "these peculiarities determine the accuracy of the power spectrum estimation for the ilc map and the statistical properties of the ilc signal .",
    "we would like to point out that the detected non - gaussianity of the ilc map ( see for example , eriksen et al .",
    "2003 , vielva et al .",
    "2003 , coles et al .",
    "2003 ) is most likely related with foreground contaminations ( see also chiang et al .",
    "2003 ) produced most likely by the galactic dust emission .",
    "the basic idea of the phase analysis of the cmb maps was proposed and discussed in chiang and coles ( 2000 ) , naselsky , novikov and silk ( 2002 ) , chiang et al .",

    "( 2003 ) , matsubara ( 2003 )    the cmb signal from can be expressed as a sum over spherical harmonics : @xmath1 where @xmath2 are the coefficients of expansion , @xmath3 is the modulus and @xmath4 is the phase of each @xmath5 harmonic .",
    "homogeneous and isotropic cmb gaussian random fields ( grfs ) , as a result of the simplest inflation paradigm , possess fourier modes whose real and imaginary parts are independently distributed .",
    "the statistical properties of grf are completely specified by its angular power spectrum @xmath6 , @xmath7 where @xmath8 means averaging over the modulus and phase distribution functions .",
    "in fig.1 we plot the cross - correlation of phases between the ilc map and the common foregrounds defined as a sum over synchrotron , free - free and dust emission maps for each frequency band .",
    "as one can see from fig.1 the distribution of the ilc map phases and corresponding foregrounds seems to be non - correlated one .",
    "however , in order to test such a distribution , for these phase diagram we will apply circular statistics ( fisher 1993 ) to investigate the possible cross - correlation quantitatively .",
    "naselsky et al . ( 2003 ) have shown that for linear methods of the foreground separation from the cmb signal we can expect to find some cross  correlations between the phases of the cleaned signal , @xmath9 , and the foregrounds , @xmath10 , which can be used to characterize the degree of separation achieved . to do this , here",
    "we will use the circular correlation coefficients which reflect directly the @xmath11-phase periodicity .    for the k  w frequency band",
    "the maps were taking from the _ wmap _ web site and all the phases are obtained by the spherical harmonic decomposition using the healpix ( grski et al .",
    "1999 ) and the glesp ( doroshkevich et al . 2003 ) codes .",
    "we consider the ranges of multipoles , @xmath12 for which the _ wmap _ own foreground are presented in the _ wmap _ web site .",
    "in addition to the _ wmap _ foregrounds for each band we produce the five maps as a difference between signal ( @xmath13 ) in the band and the ilc signal : @xmath14 . we will call the @xmath15-map as the derived foreground .",
    "let @xmath16 and @xmath17 be the foreground and ilc phases , respectively , for given value of @xmath18 and all the corresponding values of @xmath19 . following fisher  ( 1993 ) we define the statistics @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the @xmath23-th trigonometric moments of the phase samples , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the corresponding mean directions of the samples , @xmath26 is the circular cross - correlation coefficient in each mode @xmath18 and @xmath27 is the mean circular cross - correlation coefficient for all phases . for @xmath28 and for all @xmath18 phases @xmath29 and here we neglect them .    for the k  w bands the circular coefficients ,",
    "@xmath26 are plotted in fig . 2 for the ilc and its own foreground , and for the ilc and the derived foreground .",
    "as is seen from the fig.2 , for the first three channels these coefficients are quite moderate and do not exceed the random scatter ( @xmath30 ) obtained from 200 random realizations .",
    "note that , for all the bands , the shape of the functions @xmath26 are quite similar to each other which reflects the strong correlation of phases in all the channels ( naselsky et al .",
    "2003 ) . as one can see from fig.2 , the cross - correlation of the ilc phases and the derived foreground seems to be more significant .",
    "the same tendency follows from the estimation of the mean coefficients , @xmath31 , for @xmath32 , listed in table1 for the two samples of the foregrounds .",
    "as is expected , for the first three channels these coefficients are small but they become significant for channels v and w.    l ccc ccc & k&ka&q&v&wilc@xmath33 & -0.026 & -0.031 & -0.030 & -0.033 & -0.033 ilc@xmath34 & -0.017 & 0.002 & 0.022 & 0.112 & 0.262    [ tab11 ]    to test the sensitivity of circular statistics , we used the so called `` wmap simulator '' , in which we simulated the w band with all own _ wmap _ foregrounds and the cmb signal with random phases instead of the ilc signalcdm cosmological model from cmbfast by seljak and zaldarriaga ( 1996 ) . ] .",
    "after that we repeat the circular phase analysis in the same way as it was done for the ilc map .",
    "our results are shown in fig.3 .    for the simulator , corresponding mean cross - correlation coefficients are @xmath35 for the cmb  foreground correlations and @xmath36 for `` wrong '' foreground ( actual signal minus simulated cmb ) , corresponds to the dashed line in fig.3 .",
    "thus , if the cmb map and foreground are extracted correctly , corresponding mean cross - correlation coefficient should be less then statistical error ( @xmath37 ) , while the wrong foreground and cmb should have significant positive or negative bias .",
    "for the ilc map it means that a positive bias for @xmath27 for the v and w bands ( see table1 ) reflects directly the cross - correlation with the foreground phases .",
    "the circular cross - correlation analysis for the ilc map and k  w foregrounds and shows that the ilc map has significant correlation with the derived foregrounds obtained by subtraction the ilc map from the v and w bands signals . some of this correlations could be linked with non - gaussianity of the ilc map detected by park ( 2003 ) , eriksen et al .",

    "( 2003 ) , vielva et al .",
    "for example , vielva et al . ( 2003 ) has reported about characteristic scale of non - gaussianity in order to @xmath38 , which corresponds to @xmath39 .",
    "our analysis shows that the cross - correlation coefficients @xmath27 at @xmath40 have the highest maxima for both v and w bands . at high multipole range",
    "@xmath41 corresponding peculiarities are above @xmath42 confidential level .",
    "if we take into account that for @xmath41 all @xmath43 lies along galactic plane in the map , we can conclude that they are related with the v and w bands signal at the same longitude .",
