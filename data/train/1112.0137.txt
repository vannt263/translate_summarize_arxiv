    "studying the influence of size - selected solvents on the structure and dynamics of molecular systems is essential in understanding both molecular energy transfers and the transition from the gas to condensed phase .    in this regard ,",
    "clusters of rare gas ( rg ) atoms doped with a diatomic halogen ( bc ) are particularly convenient for at least two reasons : ( 1 ) the weakness of the van der waals ( vdw ) interactions provides a means to effectively ` separate ' the diatom from the environment , which in turn allows a relatively simple identification of the different energy transfer mechanisms at the state - to - state level ; and ( 2 ) the number @xmath4 of rg atoms can be spectroscopically selected for their addition induces a known blueshift in the vibronic transition @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "these weakly bound complexes have been the subject of intense scrutiny since the pioneering experiments of levy and co - workers @xcite and the theoretical work of beswick , jortner and delgado - barrio @xcite in the late seventies . in their experiments , levy and co - workers used laser - induced fluorescence to study rg@xmath6i@xmath0 molecules based on he , ne and ar with up @xmath7 i atoms .",
    "following the laser - induced vibrational excitation of bc , the energy is usually redistributed within the molecule leading to the breaking of the vdw bonds .",
    "this process is known as vibrational predissociation ( vp ) and provides significant information , for instance , on the dynamics of intramolecular vibrational energy redistribution ( ivr ) .",
    "rotational , electronic and other predissociation processes are possible . in the former , rotational de - excitation of the bc molecule directly provides enough energy for fragmentation . in electronic predissociation ,",
    "non - adiabatic transitions to repulsive electronic states of bc may instead lead to dissociation of the chemically bonded molecule .",
    "this was first observed in ar@xmath6i@xmath0 @xcite and recently studied in hebr@xmath0 and nebr@xmath0 @xcite . in general , the dependence of the transitions on the details of the potential energy surfaces ( pess ) as well as on the available energy makes it possible to extract useful information on binding energies and electronic couplings .",
    "the vp of vdw complexes is by far the predominant dissociation process and as such has been the most extensively studied .",
    "depending on the vibrational state excited , vdw systems fragment following one or several elementary steps , which usually include direct dissociation , different ivr regimes , evaporative cooling ( ec ) , etc .",
    "for example , the vp of ne@xmath6br@xmath0 clusters is described in references .",
    "each step may have different accessible final states and characteristic kinetics which manifest themselves in experiments through distinctively structured product state distributions as in the case of arcl@xmath0 @xcite , hebr@xmath0 and nebr@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "all of the above work ( and considerably more ) has proved through the years that , despite their apparent simplicity , even small vdw aggregates with @xmath8 undergo a wide variety of processes that are representative of most of the dynamical pathways observed in more complex , and conventionally bonded , molecules @xcite .",
    "hence , vdw systems have become valuable prototypes in the analysis of both inter- and intramolecular energy transfers .    for small molecules , exact quantum mechanical calculations ( eqm )",
    "can be performed with modern computers and algorithms .",
    "being essentially exact , at least to the accuracy of the pess , these calculations have provided a rigorous picture of the vp process .",
    "more recently , they have also addressed in detail the problem of ivr dynamics and the role played by continuum resonances in triatomic systems @xcite .",
    "quantum calculations on larger complexes almost inevitably use various approximate methods and there are just a few eqm studies in the literature . in 2001 ,",
    "meier and manthe studied the vp of ne@xmath0i@xmath0 using the multiconfiguration time - dependent hartree method@xcite and although vibrational branching ratios were compared with the experiment @xcite , the main aim of their work was to provide a benchmark for future developments in the methodology . in 2005 , garca - vela proposed a full - dimensional , fully - coupled wave packet method and used it to study the vp of he@xmath0cl@xmath0 @xcite , obtaining good agreement with experimental lifetimes and rotational distributions thus providing a test for the accuracy of the pes employed .    yet , time - dependent , fully detailed investigations of energy transfers in vdw molecules containing more than one or two rg atoms still pose a considerable challenge for both experiments and eqm calculations . in the former",
    ", researchers should be able to identify and characterize all intermediate complexes , as well as address their dynamical evolution . in the latter they have to cope with the increasing number of degrees of freedom ( dof ) and large basis sets that eventually make the computational cost prohibitive .",
    "thus , in the investigation of larger systems hybrid quantum - classical , _",
    "e.g. _  molecular dynamics with quantum transitions ( mdqt ) simulations @xcite , and quasi - classical trajectory ( qct ) methods have been to date the most widely used practical alternatives .    in fact , most qct applications have successfully reproduced the fragmentation kinetics for at least several tri- and tetra - atomic complexes . this is the case for molecules such as ne@xmath6i@xmath0 ( @xmath9  1 , 2 ) @xcite , heicl @xcite and nebr@xmath0 @xcite in which many classical predictions were later confirmed by eqm @xcite .",
    "more recently , some of us have explored the extent to which the gaussian weighted ( gw ) trajectory method @xcite adds to the applicability of qct in the study of rgbr@xmath0 ( rg = he , ne , ar ) molecules @xcite .",
    "we found that gw may enhance the qct description of product state distributions both quantitative and qualitatively , especially if only a few vibrational states are populated or calculations are performed very close to a channel closing .",
    "however , in cases such as the vp of necl@xmath0 @xcite and generally , when ivr takes place in the sparse regime and plays a significant role , it seems that only quantum mechanical calculations can be compatible with the experimental observations .",
    "hence , despite the success of many previous implementations of qct , the validity of classical concepts in the context of the vp of vdw aggregates is yet to be clarified . at last ,",
    "complementary studies addressing the dynamical ( in)stability of these systems exist in the literature .",
    "the analysis of phase - space bottlenecks in the predissociation of hei@xmath0 was used as a benchmark in the foundation of phase - space transport theory ( pstt ) @xcite .",
    "more recently , irregular variations of decay rates as well as details of the absorption spectra have been studied through the analysis of the phase - space structure and its evolution with increasing excitation energy @xcite .    in general , testing the accuracy and reliability of theoretical methods largely depends on detailed experimental data becoming available . in particular , as stated above , realistic kinetic mechanisms can only be obtained if the dynamics of all intermediate species is recorded in the experiment .",
    "this has traditionally proved to be quite challenging .",
    "for instance , in 1992 , gutmann _ et al . _",
    "@xcite used picosecond pump - probe spectroscopy to study the vp of ne@xmath6i@xmath0 with @xmath9  24 but only registered the formation of i@xmath0 .",
    "they therefore inferred the evolution of intermediates by fitting the product dihalogen formation to a sequential first - order kinetic mechanism . in 2010 , pio _ et al . _",
    "@xcite reported the characterization of the vp of ne@xmath0br@xmath0(@xmath10 ) at an unprecedented level of detail . using time- and frequency - resolved pump - probe spectroscopy",
    "they were able to record the real time evolution of all complexes involved , propose a kinetic mechanism , and determine time constants and product vibrational state distributions .    in this paper , we report qct and preliminary cartesian coupled coherent states ( cccs ) @xcite calculations on the vp of ne@xmath0br@xmath0(@xmath10 , @xmath11  1623 ) .",
    "we compare both theoretical methods , as well as their ability to reproduce the experimental observations @xcite and previous mdqt predictions @xcite .",
    "our main goal is to build upon the current understanding of the capabilities of qct in the simulation of vp processes involving larger vdw clusters , and to distinguish whenever possible the results which are intrinsic to the methodology from those that are characteristic to the systems under consideration .",
    "complementary analysis of full - dimensional and simplified models for the vp of the nebr@xmath0 triatomic complex have been very useful in the interpretation of qct results and are conveniently discussed .",

    "the former is associated with two well - defined dissociation steps and usually dominates as long as direct dissociation prevails over ivr .",
    "it leads to the loss of two vibrational quanta and have relatively simple implications in the vp kinetics @xcite .",
    "the latter becomes increasingly important as ivr dominates , and is very often linked to the loss of more than two vibrational quanta and highly - structured product state distributions .",
    "all these features help in distinguishing between the concerted and sequential mechanisms for in the vast majority of cases they lead to the same final products ( compare @xmath15 and @xmath16 )",

    ".morse parameters for the various pair interactions in ne@xmath0br@xmath0 .",
    "[ tab : morse ] [ cols=\"^,^,>,>,>,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     it is readily apparent that qct fails to capture the physics behind the vibrational distributions in the vp process , irrespectively of the statistical procedure ( sb or gw ) employed .",
    "this is a general effect of the large mismatch in the strengths of the different dof involved in the vp of vdw clusters , at least for moderate vibrational excitations of the chemically - bounded diatom .",
    "the same behavior may therefore be expected in similar systems . in the absence of resonances ,",
    "such a mismatch causes the energy transfer from the vibrational to the vdw dissociation modes to be very inefficient .",
    "this is remarkably different from the unimolecular dissociation of more conventional , _",
    "_ i.e.__chemically - bounded , molecules , where statistical arguments are usually applicable at least for the dof directly involved in the fragmentation . in the classical description of the vp of ne@xmath0br@xmath0 ,",
    "the br@xmath0 vibrational energy gradually ` flows ' into the vdw modes and eventually becomes large enough for dissociation to occur .",
    "a very limited number of the accessible final vibrational states is hence populated , the distributions being highly non - statistical ( fig .  [ fig : tdissvf_23dof_v23 ] ) .",
    "in addition , due to the very low density of vibrational states , the classical picture dramatically differs from the quantum - mechanical description and hence the experimental observations .",
    "this is particularly clear from sb product branching ratios . in this case , the loss of 1.5 ` quanta ' provides enough energy to eject both ne atoms up to @xmath25 ( table  [ tab : energetics ] ) , which is reflected in nonphysical trajectories dissociating via the @xmath26 channel ( table  [ tab : pv ] ) .",
    "the main advantage of gw over sb results in this case is to populate the qualitatively correct vibrational channels .",
    "however , as discussed above , the classical description is intrinsically inadequate and gw predicts a larger than observed propensity for @xmath26 and @xmath3 channels for the respective dissociation of the first and second ne atoms . also , the increasing importance of highly state - specific ivr ( sparse regime ) predicted in the experiment for states above @xmath27 can not be adequately reproduced within qct . some additional discrepancies , _",

    "only the gw results are shown because even if just a few vibrational states are populated , the sb and gw curves are only slightly different .",

    "as seen in panel ( a ) , the dissociation of the first ne atom leaves the resultant triatomic complex in a highly - excited rotational state .",
    "the corresponding distribution extends over more than 30 rotational levels and peaks around 810 .",
    "such rotational excitation , together with the additional excitation of the vdw vibrations , are expected to be the cause for the lifetime of the intermediate molecule being larger than that of the directly excited triatomic complex .",
    "this effect has been observed in the experiment @xcite and is reproduced by our qct calculations , as seen by comparing the corresponding lifetimes in table  [ tab : lifetimes ] with the qct predictions in table  1 of ref .  .",
    "the gw rotational distributions for the br@xmath0 product , shown in panel ( b ) , extend over the full range of accessible states determined by the maximum available energy in table  [ tab : energetics ] . for the sake of comparison ,",
    "the initial distribution @xmath29 has also been included in this panel . in the particular case of @xmath32 ,",
    "symmetry considerations for the ground state are only responsible for even @xmath33 values contributing in @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "in general , the calculated rotational distributions are considerably hotter for the products , with a maximum at about @xmath348 almost independent of @xmath28 , than for the initial states .",
    "the initial and final distributions have , nevertheless , similar shapes .",
    "although experimental rotational distributions were not reported in the experiment @xcite , a few points can be made with respect to qct predictions : ( a ) the boltzmann - like shape seems to be consistent with experimental measurements for the directly excited nebr@xmath0 molecule @xcite , and previous qct calculations @xcite ; and ( b ) the br@xmath0 product is more rotationally excited than in the photo - dissociation of nebr@xmath0@xcite , for which the distributions peak about @xmath356 . the extent of the qct distributions may be expected to differ from future experimental measurements due to the pes employed ( see discussion at the end of sec .",
    "[ sec2:pdistros ] ) , particularly close to a channel closing .",
    "we have studied the vibrational predissociation ( vp ) of the ne@xmath0br@xmath0(@xmath10 , @xmath36  1623 ) van der waals ( vdw ) cluster using the quasi - classical trajectory ( qct ) and the ( cartesian ) coupled coherent states ( ccs ) methods .    a sequential mechanism was used to fit the dynamical evolution of the different complexes involved . both qct and ccs",
    "are shown to provide very good estimates for the different dissociation lifetimes reported in the experiment @xcite and previous molecular dynamics with quantum transitions ( mdqt ) simulations @xcite .",
    "qct predictions are , however , obtained at a much lower computational expense .",
    "various sources of non - exponential behavior have been identified and their implications extensively discussed . in particular , the initial shape of the qct curves at short times arises from the ` non - democratic ' selection of classical initial conditions and the classical description of the process .",
    "meanwhile , the quantum ccs simulations give curves whose initial shape is in much better agreement with the experimental observations @xcite .",
    "however , the basis functions used to describe the wave function follow dissociative trajectories .",
    "the high dimensionality of the phase space therefore results in the basis functions decoupling and thus a semi - classical description of the cluster .",
    "this change is as least partially responsible for the departure at longer times of the curves from their initial exponential shape .",
    "an intrinsic multi - step dissociation mechanism , as observed in the experiment @xcite and predicted by mdqt calculations @xcite , may also be responsible for such non - exponential behavior at long times .",
    "additional calculations are needed in order to clarify this issue .",
    "the time scale over which the ccs gives a good description was increased significantly to around 15  ps by re - expanding the dissociated basis functions . despite this improvement ,",
    "the qct simulations give curves that agree much more closely with the experimental results at longer times .",
    "the behavior of the qct curves at longer times is , however , affected by low - dimensional tori in classical phase space .",
    "these tori are mainly in the form of quasi - periodic trajectories and are partially due to the weakness of vdw interactions . in both qct and ccs calculations ,",
    "the percentage of trajectories which correspond to the concerted mechanism is practically negligible , below 0.1% for qct and about 2% for cccs . in this regard",
    ", it is important to note that trajectory - based approaches like ccs may become more effective than ` standard ' quantum methods , mainly because they allow analyzing the different mechanisms by simply inspecting the trajectories .    as in our previous work with qct on triatomic vdw molecules",
    "@xcite , we found that application of the gaussian weighting ( gw ) procedure yields survival probability curves , and consequently lifetimes , which are not significantly different from those calculated using the standard binning ( sb ) procedure .",
    "in addition , the capabilities of qct in the description of the fragmentation kinetics was analyzed in detail by using reduced - dimensionality models of the complexes and concepts from phase - space transport theory .",
    "we have reported qct ro - vibrational product state distributions for the intermediate and final states of the vp process , and compared the vibrational distributions with the experimental results of pio _ _ et al.__@xcite . as in previous studies , _",
    "e.g. _  ref .  , the sb was found to populate nonphysical dissociation channels ( @xmath37 in this case ) .",
    "this is due to energetic issues and can be easily solved by using the gw method .",
    "the latter , however , predicts a larger than observed propensity for dissociation of the first ( second ) ne atom via the @xmath26 ( -2 ) channel .",
    "we argued that this is a general problem in the classical description of the vp of vdw clusters , which may be attributed to the weakness of vdw interactions . due to the latter ,",
    "the characteristic frequencies for the diatomic subunit are usually one or more orders of magnitude larger than those of the bending mode within the vdw well .",
    "the energy transfer leading to dissociation is inefficient and slow . to complicate matters further , as energy flows from the vibrational to the transitional modes , the vdw bending modes evolve from bounded , through hindered , to free type of motion and the role of many non - linear resonances become increasingly important @xcite .",
    "this fact additionally worsens the quality of any classical description of the vp process , since quantum state - selectivity can not be adequately described .",
    "as expected , the quantum - classical discrepancies will be more pronounced for relatively low @xmath28 , given the very low density of vibrational states .",
    "dissociation of the first ne atom leaves the nebr@xmath0 in a highly - excited rotational state .",
    "this rotational excitation , and the additional excitation of the vdw vibration , are responsible for an increase dissociation lifetime of the intermediate complex , as compared to the lifetime of the directly excited nebr@xmath0 .",
    "this effect was observed in the experiment @xcite and is correctly predicted by our calculations .",
    "product br@xmath0 rotational distributions are found to be significantly hotter in the products , extending over the full range of available energies .",
