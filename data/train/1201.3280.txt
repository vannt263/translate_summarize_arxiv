    "the mass of a star is arguably its most fundamental quantity ; according to the russell - vogt theorem , it is the mass of a star ( along with the chemical composition ) that uniquely determines a star s evolution .",
    "we now know that the initial angular momentum also plays an important role in determining the evolution of a star ( maeder & meynet 2000 ; meynet & maeder 2000 ) .    for most stars , the simple way to estimate the mass ( @xmath1 ) of a star is by measuring the star s luminosity ( @xmath2 ) , as @xmath3 where the exponent @xmath4 is approximately 4 for solar - type stars . for both lower mass ( @xmath5 ) and",
    "higher mass ( @xmath6 ) stars , the exponent becomes smaller , due to the importance of convection in lower mass stars , and radiation pressure in higher mass stars . for most stars , the exponent in this mass - luminosity relationship ( mlr )",
    "is well established both by evolutionary theory and empirical measurements .    however , for high mass stars there are two additional complications that make applying the mlr difficult .",
    "first , main - sequence massive stars ( o- and early b - type ) stars are quite hot ( @xmath7=25,000 - 50,000  k ) and because of this only a tiny fraction of their light leaks out in the visible . in order to apply the mlr",
    ", one needs to know not only the distance and reddening of a star ( in order to get the absolute visual magnitude , @xmath8 ) , but also an accurate value for the effective temperature , as the correction to @xmath8 needed to obtain the bolometric luminosity is a steep function of effective temperature .",
    "the second complication is that the mlr is really a function of age .",
    "this is true for all stars , as their luminosities increase slightly as they evolve , but massive stars also _ lose mass _ as they evolve , due to radiatively - driven stellar winds . for massive stars",
    "these issues can be solved by first modeling the optical spectra using non - lte stellar atmosphere codes , such as cmfgen ( hillier & miller 1998 ) or fastwind ( puls et al .",
    "this then provides both the effective temperature and the bolometric luminosity , allowing placement of the stars on the h - r diagram ( hrd ) .",
    "reference to stellar evolutionary models then allow a determination of age and current mass ( referred to often as the  evolutionary mass \" ) without reference to a mlr _ per se_.    however , this method is no better than the stellar atmosphere and evolutionary models on which they are based . a worrisome issue that remains is that of the so - called  mass discrepancy \" , a systematic difference between the masses one obtains from a stellar atmosphere analysis , and that inferred from evolutionary theory .",
    "modeling the star s spectra with a stellar atmosphere code produces a measurement of the mass via the surface gravity @xmath9 , since @xmath10 , and the radius @xmath11 is known once the effective temperature is known _ if _ the distance and hence the luminosity @xmath2 are known , since @xmath12 by the stefan - boltzmann equation .",
    "herrero et al .",
    "( 1992 ) called attention to the fact that the masses derived from spectroscopic analysis are systematically lower than those found from evolutionary models .",
    "this mass discrepancy has never been fully resolved , despite significant improvements in both the evolution and stellar atmosphere models .",
    "( see , for example , massey et al .",
    "but it would be of great interest to measure masses in some more direct way to test the validity of the models .",
    "such an opportunity is granted to us by binaries , where newtonian physics and kepler s 3rd law provides us ( in principle ) with direct mass measurements .",
    "this is the first of a series of papers presenting dynamical masses and bolometric luminosities for massive stars in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) .",
    "the title of our series is intended to pay homage to the  spectroscopic studies of o - type binaries \" series by peter s. conti and collaborators , which appeared 30 - 35 years ago ( e.g. , bohannan & conti 1976 ; conti & walborn 1976 ; massey & conti 1977 ; morrison & conti 1978 , 1980 ; conti et al .  1980 ) .",
    "although telescopes have gotten larger since those days , and instruments and data analysis methods have improved , the basic need to test theory with fundamental mass determinations remains .",
    "work over the past several decades has helped improve the situation but the paucity of systems with well - determined parameters is underscored by our continuing poor knowledge of the mlr and the persistence of the mass discrepancy .",
    "historically , studies of massive binaries have usually begun by the accidental discovery of double lines in the spectrum as a result of an observation taken when the system just happened to be near orbital quadrature .",
    "several dozen subsequent spectra are then usually needed ( obtained over a period of months or years ) to determine the orbital period and the orbital parameters .",
    "usually it is only then that the system is monitored to detect the light variations that would indicate eclipses that allow an orbital inclination ( @xmath13 ) to be determined . without knowledge of the inclination ,",
    "a double - lined spectroscopic orbit solution tells us only the _ minimum _ masses for each component , @xmath14 and @xmath15 , since @xmath16 .",
    "if eclipses are present , then analysis of the light curve will also yield the stellar radii and the flux ratios of the two components , if the effective temperatures can be accurately determined . for most stars",
    "the effective temperatures can be determined by obtaining light curves in different bandpasses ( i.e. , from the colors ) , but for main - sequence massive stars , the colors are largely degenerate with effective temperatures because of the high temperatures , and it requires additional spectral analysis if good values for the effective temperatures are to be found . with these , and with the knowledge of stellar radii , one can then compute the bolometric luminosities of the components , which can be used to refine our knowledge of the mass - luminosity relationship .",
    "it is additionally useful to know the distances to the system , as the comparison between the modeled absolute visual magnitude and the observed absolute visual magnitudes provides assurance that the physical parameters are correct .",
    "since eclipsing systems are necessary for the full analysis , we decided to instead start by searching for stars whose light curves suggested they might be eclipsing massive stars . we chose to concentrate on massive stars in the magellanic clouds since their distances are well known , and they are bright enough for spectroscopic followup , albeit with larger apertures .",
    "in addition , since their metallicities are relatively low , mass loss on the main - sequence should be relatively modest , and thus the connection to the initial masses should be less dependent upon the assumed mass loss rates of the evolutionary models . by refining the periods and times of primary eclipses precisely using frequent photometric observations prior to spectroscopic observations , we should know exactly when to observe these stars at maximum velocity separation ( orbital quadrature )",
    ".    this allowed us to measure the orbital semi - amplitudes very efficiently for two reasons .",
    "first , o - type stars have very broad spectral lines due to rotational broadening ( @xmath17 typically greater than 100 km s@xmath18 ) , and _ most _ spectral observations more than 0.1 phase away from quadrature are unlikely to show resolvable double lines and hence do not provide useful measurements .",
    "secondly , it is the velocities around quadrature that best define the orbital semi - amplitudes . and",
    ", since the phases would be known exactly , determining the amplitude of the orbital motion could be done with very few observations , as we could fix the phases in the orbital solutions to those determined from the light curve .",
    "thus we minimized the amount of large telescope time needed for the spectroscopy by utilizing small aperture telescopes to determine the light curves .",
    "one of the downsides to this approach is that it is easier to find short period systems as their light variabilities are more pronounced : for a given orbital inclination eclipses will be deeper for shorter period systems . however , these shorter period systems are more likely to be in contact , and therefore their masses will be less pertinent to understanding single stars .",
    "but for many such systems our program detected easily interpreted , detached systems .",
    "nevertheless , as we will see , even these  simple \" systems offer some unexpected surprises !",
    "we begin this series of papers with a study of two such simple , detached system consisting of late o - type dwarfs of modest mass : [ m2002 ] lmc 172231 ( o9 v + o9.5 v ) and st2 - 28 ( o7 v + o8 v ) .",
    "subsequent papers will describe the other eclipsing systems we ve identified , including early - type o binaries , wolf - rayet binaries , and contact systems .",
    "we describe in some detail here the observational and reduction techniques , since these will be used in this future work , and illustrate the results we ve been able to achieve .",
    "it is our intent that these systems will allow us to make more critical tests of stellar evolution models than usually possible , and to serve as _",
    "linchpins _ for the empirical mass - luminosity relationship .",
    "our photometric monitoring of stars in selected ob associations in the magellanic clouds began in 2003 july , and continued through 2011 february .",
    "the observing seasons generally extended from august through january or february of the following year .",
    "the only observing season missed entirely in our photometric monitoring program was 2008/2009 , as we had begun our spectroscopic observations , but as the analysis proceeded we realized we needed more supporting photometry .",
    "the only observations during the 2010/2011 season were made in january - february 2011 of selected stars at targeted times in order to improve missing phase coverage in the light curves .",
    "a variety of telescopes were used ; their properties are listed in table  [ tab : telescopes ] .",
    "the swope observations were made in  classical \" mode by n.i.m . and were often nightly during dark time .",
    "the smarts 1.0-m and 1.3-m observations were obtained in queue mode usually with a cadence of once every other night throughout both bright and dark time , with time primarily allocated through georgia state university , although the first season was obtained through noao ( proposal 2005b-0108 ) . in the case of the 1.0-m ,",
    "the queue observations were carried out for a few minutes each night by whatever astronomer happened to be scheduled that night in classical mode ; in the case of the 1.3-m , the data were obtained by dedicated queue observers .",
    "we list in table  [ tab : clusters ] the six magellanic cloud regions we observed , and which telescopes were used in each observing seasons .",
    "this table is intended primarily to give an overall view of the scope of the project ; the specific telescope and instrument will be given for each photometric measurement in the individual photometry tables .",
    "all observations were made through a v filter , and exposure times were typically 10 - 30 sec .",
    "data were obtained under both photometric and non - photometric conditions ( in some cases , through several magnitudes of extinction ! ) , but since each field contained hundreds of reference stars , we were able to obtain good photometry nonetheless .",
    "the reductions of the swope data were straightforward .",
    "our tests on a series of exposures did not justify the use of the nonlinearity correction typically applied to these data ( hamuy et al .",
    "2006 ) , but inclusion or not would have had negligible effect on our photometry .",
    "overscan columns were used to remove the bias , and nightly bias frames were used to remove the ( negligible ) bias structure .",
    "flat fielding was achieved by exposures of dome flats .",
    "the smarts 1.0-m yale y4kcam data proved a challenge to reduce .",
    "our data were among the first to be taken with the instrument , and our reductions quickly identified a number of issues .",
    "the 4k@xmath194k chip was read out using four amplifiers , and we found we had to mask out the central rows and columns as good photometry could not be performed for stars that straddled quadrants as the bias structure was highly unstable .",
    "worse , tests showed that dome flats and twilight sky flats differed by nearly 10% from center to edge .",
    "we prevailed upon one of the observers , david james , to obtain images with the star moved from center to near the edge , and our photometry of these data showed that the twilight flats gave good ( @xmath201% ) results while the use of dome flats would have resulted in a 10% error .",
    "the lack of header information describing the data and bias sections of the four quadrants resulted in our writing our own iraf reduction scripts , which have been made available on the smarts web site for others to use , along with the characterization of the instrument .",
    "we hope this provided some partial compensation for the scheduled observers who were asked to take 15 minutes of data for us every few nights .    at the start of the 2007/2008 observing season , one quadrant of the y4kcam chip died , and our program was switched to the smarts 1.3-m andicam instrument .",
    "reduced data are kindly provided for all andicam observations by suzanne tourtellotte , and the reductions are essentially identical to what we used for the swope data .",
    "photometry was carried out by a series of automatic iraf scripts that characterized the data , identified stars , and obtained aperture photometry .",
    "these routines were loosely based upon the scripts written for producing photometry for the local group galaxies survey ( massey et al .",
    "2006 , 2007 ) .",
    "experiments to perform photometry via point spread function ( psf ) fitting did not yield improved results , and often were inferior , particularly on the smarts 1.0-m yale data where significant psf variations were present across the field . for the swope and smarts 1.3-m data , an aperture with a radius of 3 pixels was used ( 11 - 13 ) . for the smarts",
    "1.0-m data , a similar value in arcseconds was used ( 5 pixels , or 14 ) .",
    "the sky values were taken from the modal value in an annulus located between radii of 10 and 18 pixels from each star .",
    "for each telescope and cluster combination a  master list \" was created , consisting of pixel coordinates and an instrumental magnitude for each star from some frame obtained in good seeing .",
    "in addition , each master list included the celestial coordinates for each star , obtained by using the _ hst _ guide star catalog 1.1 catalog to calibrate the frame with a world coordinate system .",
    "the masterlist also included our best estimate of the standard magnitude of each star , obtained using the ubvri photometry of massey ( 2002 ) and a modest color correction determined for each telescope from a @xmath21 image obtained for these purposes .",
    "the photometry from each frame was cross - correlated against this master list in order to determine the offset , rotation , and a magnitude difference for the ensemble .",
    "the magnitude for each star was then determined by correcting for the magnitude difference of the frame to the masterlist , and the correction between the masterlist s instrumental magnitude and our estimate of the standard magnitude .",
    "a single file of the photometry of each star was then produced including the heliocentric julian day ( hjd ) and the magnitude and instrumental magnitude error .",
    "the photometry from the various years and telescopes were then combined , applying a small zero point shift ( typically on the order of several thousandths of a magnitude ) if needed to bring the median out - of - eclipse data into accord .",
    "we analyzed the data as we went along , and re - evaluated our target list every year , with the goal of having a preliminary set of targets for spectroscopy in late 2008 .",
    "it is for that reason that we dropped ngc 602c from our program ( see table  [ tab : clusters ] ) , as none of the stars of interest showed significant variability .",
    "various methods have been employed over the years to detect variability . in our case , we were interested only in _ periodic _ variability .",
    "we therefore adopted the one - way analysis of variance ( aov ) method of schwarzenberg - czerny ( 1989 ) which excels at detecting periodic narrow events , inspired by the success demonstrated by lpez - morales & clemens ( 2004 ) .",
    "( we are grateful to mercedes lpez - morales for helpful correspondence and for passing on a fortran77 version of the schwarzenberg - czerny 1989 code .",
    "updated versions of the code can be found at dr .",
    "schwarzenberg - czerny s web site . )",
    "we added software that allowed the automatic detection of the spikes in the resulting periodograms , and produced phased light curves that could be examined by eye for significance and to distinguish likely periods from their aliases . in all , several _ thousand _ such light curves were examined multiple times as the data collection grew ; this provided useful training material for a number of undergraduates .",
    "for the final periods , we checked our values using the lafler & kinman ( 1965 ) technique , which involves phasing the data by successive trial periods and determining the point - to - point scatter in the phased data .",
    "we list in table  [ tab : winners ] _ all _ 48 of the stars in the smc and lmc that we thought were interesting from the light curves ; follow up spectroscopy ( described in the next section ) caused us to drop many of these from our program for one reason or another .",
    "for some , the stars were not double - lined at the anticipated phase .",
    "this is unlikely due to our having the wrong period , as in some cases the same period had been found from analysis of macho data ( faccioli et al .",
    "2007 , derekas et al .  2007 ) .",
    "in other cases , double lines were seen but were too blended for reliable velocity information to be extracted . in a few cases it was just not possible to obtain a sufficient number of observations at the needed orbital phases due to time spent on other systems . in one very disappointing case , that of the early - type binary ngc  346 mpg 342 ( massey et al .",
    "1989 ) , spectroscopy revealed that the system was triple , with the third component also shifting . in the end",
    "we were left with no suitable stars in the smc , and 17 in the lmc .",
    "wyrzykowski et al .  (",
    "2004 ) , derekas et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , and faccioli et al .",
    "( 2007 ) have published lists of eclipsing binaries in the smc and lmc from the ogle ( udalski et al .",
    "1998 ) and macho ( alcock et al .  1997 ) microlensing projects , and it is interesting to note that of the 48 periodic light variables we found , only 15 ( 31% ) of them are also in these lists . the reasons for this are not obvious .",
    "saturation is likely not the sole explanation : the brightest stars in the wyrzykowski et al .",
    "( 2004 ) and derekas et al .",
    "( 2007 ) catalogs have @xmath22 , while the average @xmath23 magnitude of stars in our sample have @xmath24 .",
    "of the two stars discussed in the present paper , the @xmath23 magnitudes are nearly the same ( @xmath23=14.04 and 14.15 ) , and yet one was previously detected as a variable while the other one was not .",
    "none of the stars in ngc 1910 or the r136 region are identified as eclipsing systems by these other studies .",
    "r136 is embedded in strong nebulosity , but the nebulosity around ngc 2074 ( where numerous macho objects are found ) is considerably stronger than that of ngc 1910 . crowding may also be an issue , although one of the stars discussed in the current paper ( st2 - 28 ) is relatively crowded and was correctly identified .",
    "it is also true that in some cases the periodic variability was of very low amplitude .",
    "for instance , lmc 171520 , which will be discussed in paper ii , has peak - to - trough variations of @xmath200.1 mag .",
    "still , other stars , such as one of the stars discussed in this paper , lmc 172231 , have very deep ( 0.6 mag ) eclipses but were not detected in these microlensing surveys .",
    "( it is also not located in strong nebulosity . )",
    "we believe this emphasizes the need for such targeted studies such as ours , particularly for finding massive eclipsing systems where nebulosity is a characteristic of the sample .",
    "we do note that when macho or ogle did detect our objects , the periods are in excellent agreement .",
    "the one exception is lmc 164717 , where the macho period is half of ours .",
    "all spectroscopy intended for radial velocities was carried out on the magellan clay and baade 6.5-m telescopes , although a few classification spectra were also obtained on the dupont 2.5-m telescope .",
    "the large aperture of the magellan telescopes allowed us to reach the very high signal - to - noise ( s / n ) we desired ( 200 or more per 1    spectral resolution element ) in exposures of about an hour for our faintest targets , and a few minutes for our brightest .",
    "such high s / n is needed given the general weakness of the spectral features in early - type stars .",
    "all in all , we collected data at the magellan telescopes on 21 nights between 2008 december 8 and 2010 november 27 .",
    "the individual runs varied in length from 2 to 6 consecutive nights .",
    "roughly half of the time was allocated through carnegie , and the other half through the university of arizona .",
    "nine of the nights were on the baade with the inamori - magellan areal camera and spectrograph ( imacs ) , while the other 12 nights were on the clay telescope with the magellan echellette ( mage ) spectrograph .",
    "generally , the first three authors ( p. m. , n. i. m. , and k. f. n. ) were present for all of the observing , although for a few runs either p. m. or n. i. m. were the only ones observing .    for all of the observing ,",
    "orbital ephemerides were computed based upon the accumulated photometry prior to the observing run , and observations were planned to take place near orbital phases of 0.25 and 0.75 , the times of maximum velocity separations .",
    "quick - look was performed in real time to assess the overall quality of the data , and ( in the first few spectroscopic runs ) to determine spectral types and confirm that double lines were present .    for imacs ,",
    "observations were obtained with the 1200 line mm@xmath18 grating with a 09 slit .",
    "the resulting spectral resolution was about 1.0    ( 5.0 pixels on the detector ) .",
    "spectral coverage was nominally 3650 - 5250    over the four ccds , but in practice only the central two chips contained useful spectral features and were used , covering 4020 - 4410    and 4430 - 4820   . because imacs uses a very long slit , it was often possible to rotate the instrument to a position angle that allowed two objects of interest to be placed on the slit and observed at the same time .",
    "a series of three integrations ( ranging from 3x300 s to 3x750 s depending upon the brightness of the object and the sky conditions ) was obtained of the program object , followed by a 150 s exposure for the henear .",
    "the observing procedure for such spectroscopy is relatively straight forward but time consuming for a program such as ours , as there is no provision for viewing the slit directly . despite our experience",
    ", it was never possible to lower the overhead ( setup plus comparison ) to less than 10 minutes for each new object .",
    "flat field data were obtained by exposure of a calibration screen during the afternoon .",
    "typical signal - to - noise was 150 - 200 per 5 pixel resolution element .",
    "data reduction for imacs used the standard iraf tasks .",
    "the overscan at the top of each chip was used , as this removed most of the bias structure .",
    "the remainder was removed using a series of bias exposures obtained each night .",
    "flat - fielding was accomplished by the normalized calibration screen exposures .",
    "spectra of the sources were extracted using an optimal extraction ",
    "clean \" algorithm , with sky chosen adjacent to the object , and combined at the end .",
    "each of the two chips were treated separately .",
    "typical wavelength errors ( root mean square ) from fitting the comparison spectra were 0.03 - 0.05    ( 2 - 3 km s@xmath18 ) .    for mage ,",
    "spectral coverage is nominally from 3100    to 1@xmath25 m covering 15 orders , with a spectral resolution of 4100 , almost identical to the resolution we achieved with imacs .",
    "we did not reduce either the bluest or reddest parts of the spectra , but kept only the central 13 orders ( orders 7 - 19 ) , covering 3150 - 9400   .",
    "acquisition is by means of a slit - viewing tv , so overhead was minimal .",
    "although the short slit ( 10 ) precluded multiplexing by obtaining two objects , the high throughput and lack of overhead made this a more efficient instrument for our program .",
    "exposure times were shorter than with imacs by about 30% , and resulted in higher signal - to - noise than with imacs .",
    "wavelength calibration was by means of a 3 s thar exposure .",
    "flat - fielding of mage is complicated by the very large wavelength coverage .",
    "traditionally users have employed a combination of flat - field quartz lamp exposures in the red and in- and out - of - focus exposures of a xe lamp in the violet . following a suggestion made one night at dinner by ian thompson , we experimented and demonstrated to our satisfaction that we could meet our very high signal - to - noise requirement _ without _ flat fielding : that the chip really is quite uniform . instead , we dithered the star to three positions along the slit . in the end",
    "we typically achieved a s / n of 400 per 4-pixel spectral resolution element at 5000   .",
    "the reductions of the mage data were complicated by the curvatures of each order ( due to the anamorphic distortions of the cross - dispersing prisms ) , and spectral features are also tilted , with a tilt that varies with wavelength along each order . although various mage pipelines have been developed by several groups , we found we did very well with the  mtools \" iraf package written by jack baldwin for dealing with data from another instrument , the magellan inamori kyocera echelle ( mike ) , in combination with the standard iraf echelle reduction tools .",
    "wavelength calibration consisted of a 2-dimensional fit to all of the orders , with rms residuals of 0.05 - 0.06    ( 3 - 4 km s@xmath18 ) .    radial velocities were measured from the normalized spectra using interactive fitting of two gaussians to resolve double lines , a standard technique with double - lined o - type binaries ( see , for example , burkholder et al .",

    "if a spectrum did not reveal double lines , it was not used ; an inspection of the data revealed that there were no instances for our final sample where a star should have shown double lines at an appropriate phase but did not , or vice versa , giving us additional confidence in our period determinations .",
    "anywhere from 1 to 17 lines were measured in a given spectrum ( mainly the he i and he ii although occasionally the balmer lines were used if well separated ) depending upon the phase and the quality of the data , but the typical ( median ) number was 5 .",
    "the effective rest wavelengths were taken primarily from conti et al .",
    "( 1977 ) , supplemented by the updated version of moore ( 1972 ) by coluzzi ( 1993 ) .",
    "typically one uses the radial velocities of each component of a spectroscopic binary to solve for the orbital elements @xmath26 ( the period ) , @xmath27 and @xmath28 ( the orbital semi - amplitudes ) , @xmath29 ( the center - of - mass motion of the system ) , @xmath30 ( the time of periastron passage of the primary ) , @xmath31 ( the orbital eccentricity ) , and @xmath32 ( the angular distance of periastron passage relative to the ascending node ) . in general the radial velocity @xmath33 of star 1 is related to the orbital parameters as @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the true anomaly , a function only of the orbital phase and @xmath31 ( see , e.g. , equations 64 and 65 in binnendijk 1960 ) .",
    "the minimum masses are given by @xmath36 and @xmath37 when @xmath26 is expressed in days , @xmath38 in km s@xmath18 , and @xmath1 is in solar masses .",
    "the orbital inclination relative to the line of sight is @xmath13 , and hence the expression @xmath39 mass , as @xmath16 .",
    "note from these equations that mass ratio is inversely proportional to the ratio of the semi - amplitudes ; i.e. , @xmath40 .    in designing our spectroscopic observations",
    ", we decided to concentrate on the systems with circular orbits , as one can then eliminate the need to determine @xmath31 and @xmath32 , and fewer observations will yield high accuracy for the orbital semi - amplitudes and hence the masses .",
    "fortunately , we expect that to be the case for most massive binaries with short periods , as tidal forces circularize orbits very quickly .",
    "( for instance , of the 15 young detached massive binary systems listed by gies 2003 with periods less than 5 days , only 2 , or possibly 3 , have been shown to have non circular orbits . ) for eclipsing systems , most systems with non - circular orbits can be quickly spotted as the primary and secondary eclipses will likely be separated by other than 0.5 phase .",
    "however , an eccentric system which just happens to have @xmath32 near 90@xmath41 or 270@xmath41 will also have eclipses 0.5 phase apart , and so the definitive test will come from modeling the light curve .",
    "an light curve with eclipses 0.5 phase apart _ and _ the same eclipse widths means that the orbit is circular .    for massive binaries",
    "there can be a further complication .",
    "hot luminous stars have radiatively - driven stellar winds that , if strong enough , may result in appreciable ( tens of km s@xmath18 ) outward motion even down in the photosphere where the spectral lines are formed .",
    "this was first demonstrated in a series of papers by hutchings ( 1968a , 1968b , 1969 , 1970a , 1970b ; see also 1979 ) .",
    "this results in the possibility that the two components in an early - type binary may have different average velocities , equivalent to saying that separate  center of mass \" velocities may be needed for each component , i.e. , that actually @xmath42 and @xmath43 are needed .",

    "we expect that ( in the absence of tidal distortions and the like ) the same areas will be eclipsed at both primary and secondary eclipse .",
    "thus , the deeper eclipse will correspond to the hotter star being eclipsed as the surface brightness of the hotter star will be greater ( at every wavelength ) according to the stefan - boltzmann law .",

    "it is not clear which component would be the more massive given the fact that both stars will be losing mass , with the initially more luminous ( massive ) star having the larger mass - loss rate .",
    "thus we should not expect that the hotter component ( which we will call the primary ) is necessarily the more massive component .    for modeling the eclipses , we used the light curve synthesis code gensyn ( mochnacki & doughty 1972 ) to produce model @xmath23-band differential light curves .",

    "the models emphasize the point we made in section  [ sec - intro ] , namely that the mass - luminosity relationship really depends upon age for massive stars .",
    "although the error bars are large for the entire data set , we find it reassuring nearly all of the points are found within the expectations of main - sequence objects .",
    "the exceptions are three red ( lmc ) outliers on the left , which are , in order of decreasing luminosity , the secondary component of sc1 - 105 ( bonanos 2009 ; bonanos et al .",
    "2011 ) and the primary and secondary components of 78.6097.13 ( gonzlez et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "while this provides good statistical agreement with the evolutionary models , it is not the critical test . in the upper two panels of figure  [ fig : hrd ]",
    "we show the location of our four components on the h - r diagram with the dynamical masses indicated .",
    "( note that because hotter effective temperatures imply high luminosities , error bars are diagonal lines in this diagram . )",
    "overall the agreement is encouraging .",
    "for instance , the components in each system appear to have the same age .",
    "we show isochrones at 1  myr intervals , and the components lie parallel to to these dashed lines , indicating that the physical parameters are consistent with the same age for each component , which we would expect .",
    "although the masses are approximately what we expect from their location in the hrd , it is intriguing that the masses for all four components are a bit too low compared to the masses of the tracks .",
    "we note that these differences are not due to mass loss .",
    "for instance , in the case of lmc 172231 , a 5 myr old star with an initial mass of 20@xmath122 would be expected to have a mass of 19.9@xmath122 ; i.e. , the amount of mass loss expected at these luminosities are small over these time scales .",
    "we can quantify the size of the discrepancy by examining the differences in masses between what we observe and what the models predict by interpolating along an isochrone .",
    "we list these differences in table  [ tab : comparisons ] .",
    "the  observed \" masses come from our orbit solution , and the  model \" mass comes from using our  observed \" bolometric luminosities to interpolate along the isochrone using a smooth , high order polynomial fit . both components of lmc 172231 and st2 - 28 have differences in the same sense , that the masses we observe are lower than the masses predicted by the model .",
    "alternately we can ask what bolometric luminosities should correspond to our observed masses .",
    "we find ( equivalently ) that all four components are slightly over - luminous for their mass , by about 0.2  dex . while the discrepancy for the secondary of lmc 172231 is not significant , the others are all significant at the 2 - 3@xmath118 level . although these discrepancies are small , it is unsettling that they are all in the same sense . are there underlying systematic issues that may be in play ?",
    "first , we consider our calculated bolometric luminosities . we have adopted the effective temperature determinations from fastwind , and if these were systematically too large we would derive too high a bolometric luminosity .",
    "but , they would have be off by more than seems reasonable : to lower the bolometric luminosities by 0.1 - 0.2  dex would require temperatures that were cooler by about 6 - 12% , or 2,000 - 4,000  k. the precision in our fitting the spectra is of order 500 k , and we have formally adopted errors of @xmath1231,000 k in the propagation of errors in tables  [ tab : lmc172231physical ] and [ tab : st228physical ] . the agreement between fastwind and the  gold standard",
    "\" hot star model atmosphere cmfgen ( hillier & miller 1998 ) is near perfect in terms of the effective temperatures ( neugent et al .",

    "alternatively , the radii would have to be over estimated by about 12 - 25% .",
    "this , too , seems beyond any reasonable possibility : the radii are fixed by the widths of the eclipse depths and we believe are determined to 3 - 6 times better than this .",
    "nevertheless , we have assumed spherical geometry in determining the bolometric luminosities , and used the  volume radius \" from the light curve analysis with our fastwind effective temperatures . if these stars were so close that tidal distortions were significant , this could be a potential problem , as our effective temperatures really only correspond to those measured at quadrature .",
    "note though that a change of several thousand degrees would correspond to a change 1 - 2 spectral types during an orbit .",
    "such changes are not seen even in contact systems . in truth ,",

    "in addition gensyn defines a fill - out factor , the ratio of the photospheric surface to the roche surface .",
    "any value below unity indicates a detached component , and values below 0.90 correspond to essentially spherical stars .",
    "the primary of st2 - 28 has the highest fill - out , 0.87 , and we can see slight evidence of this in the small ellipsoidal variations in its light curve .",
    "however we stress that the distortion of even this star is minimal .",
    "as noted above , we have an alternative  tidal model \" solution for the bolometric luminosities as well given in table  [ tab : lmc172231physical ] and [ tab : st228physical ] .",
    "the bolometric luminosities implied by these are about 0.06 - 0.08  dex _ larger _ than the more conservative values we have been using , which would exacerbate the differences with the evolutionary models .    in the introduction we touted the advantage of studying systems in the magellanic clouds rather than in the milky way as the distances are known : many methods yield essentially the same answer for the distance of the lmc , and the distance",
    "is established to at least 10% ( van den bergh 2000 , and references therein ) .",

    "the situation is more complex , as the amount of light contributed by the third component adds a complication .",
    "the modeled total luminosity of the system agrees with what we observe when we adopt a third component contamination based upon our spectral fitting , but the uncertainties are large",

    "the difference is negligible for the primary , but it is clear from the secondary that our adopted velocity is a better fit .",
    "the he ii @xmath83 line in st2 - 28 is shown in the bottom two panels . again on the left we show the shifts required to bring the masses into agreement with the evolutionary values , while on the right we show the shifts based upon our adopted velocities .",
    "the latter is clearly better .",
    "we were of course curious to see if other systems show similar discrepancies .",
    "comparisons at this level of precision between the binary and evolutionary masses are usually not possible ; it requires both very good mass determinations _ and _ careful effective temperatures determinations for the bolometric luminosities .",
    "two studies that meet these criteria are that of sc1 - 105 ( by bonanos 2009 ) and of the lh54 - 425 ( by williams et al .",
    "2008 ) , both lmc binaries .",
    "we compare their masses to those expected from the evolutionary tracks in the lower part of figure  [ fig : hrd ] .",
    "bonanos ( 2009 ) describes the components of sc1 - 105 as highly non - coeval , with ages of 5  myr ( primary ) and @xmath13010  myr using the older ( non - rotating ) geneva evolutionary tracks , and cites this as evidence that there has been significant mass transfer .",
    "we see in figure  [ fig : hrd ] that in fact both components neatly fall along a single isochrone ( 5  myr ) with the newer geneva tracks that include the effects of rotation , and are in fact quite coeval .",
    "the components of sc1 - 105 are late o - type dwarfs , similar to those studied here .",
    "the secondary is highly over - luminous for its mass .",
    "we agree that the system is semi - detached , with the secondary filling its roche lobe",
    ". however , her fit of the light - curve significantly fails to match the eclipse depths for both the primary and secondary eclipses by 0.1  mag or more , a problem she attributes to  spots \" .",
    "rather , we believe this is indicative of a well - known problem in analyzing contact and semi - detached systems . in such systems",
    "the orbital semi - amplitudes are significantly over - estimated using low - excitation optical lines , with smaller @xmath38 values obtained from the uv ( see , for example , penny et al .",
    "2008 ) the physical explanation is that the side of the star in overflow that is facing its companion is producing weaker optical lines because the temperature gradient is less steep there .",
    "the center of light of the optical lines is thus skewed toward the outer parts of the star , giving a spuriously large @xmath38 .",
    "this overestimates the separation of the two stars , producing more shallow model eclipses than what is actually seen .",
    "unless one corrects for this by using only high - excitation lines one will derive masses that are too large , as well as spurious values for the other physical parameters . note that since the 5 myr isochrone is almost vertical in the hrd , a change in luminosity ( due to an incorrect radius ) would have little effect on the derived ages as long as the same effective temperatures were adopted .",
    "lh54 - 425 consists of earlier o - type stars than what we are studying here , but the sense and the size of the mass discrepancy is very similar to what we find here ( figure  [ fig : hrd ] , _ lower right _ ) : both components are slightly over - luminous for their masses ( or , conversely , under - massive for their luminosities ) when compared to the evolutionary tracks . note we find that the components are highly coeval , according to the isochrones , with an age of 2.0  myr , slightly larger than the 1.5  myr derived by williams et al .",
    "we have added the differences between the observations and the models to the end of table  [ tab : comparisons ] .",
    "we can see that the masses for lh54 - 425 are discrepant with theory in the same sense , and by the same amount , as what we find here .",
    "the result is also only marginally significant , however , when compared to the errors .",
    "the mass - loss rates assumed in the evolutionary models are unlikely to be the culprit .",
    "the geneva models rely upon the vink et al .",
    "( 2001 ) mass - loss laws for o stars , and for 20@xmath122 stars ( similar to the mass of those discussed here ) , the mass loss rate averaged over the first 5  myr are indeed very low , about @xmath131 yr@xmath18 .",
    "puls et al .  (",
    "1996 ) did not measure mass - loss in the lmc for stars as low luminosity as these , but did find values @xmath132",
    "yr@xmath18 for lmc o - type stars that were considerably more luminous .",
    "similarly massey et al .",
    "( 2004 , 2005 , 2009 ) find mass - loss rates for lmc o stars with @xmath133 of 5.0 to be @xmath134 yr@xmath18 . in order to account for the discrepancy",
    "we find , the mass - loss rates would have to be about 0.2 - 0.5@xmath135 yr@xmath18 for lmc 172231 , and @xmath136 yr@xmath18 for st2 - 28 .",
    "these high rates can be ruled out observationally for radiatively - driven winds .",
    "what if instead binary evolution ( i.e. , roche - lobe induced mass - loss ) has raised the mass - loss rates ?",
    "we see no evidence of this at present .",
    "certainly in the case of lmc 172231 and st2 - 28 we see little current evidence : as discussed above , the stars are not significantly distorted .",
    "the residual nebular contamination at h@xmath137 in the tomographically separated spectra precludes our making an estimate of the mass - loss rate directly .",
    "is this a problem restricted to that of the lmc ?",
    "unfortunately none of the massive young detached galactic systems listed by gies ( 2012 ) have undergone a similar sort of analysis ; at best , the effective temperatures have come from assigning spectral types , usually without tomographic separation .",
    "the _ masses _ of these systems are likely well determined , but their bolometric _ luminosities _ are not .",
    "( this can be inferred from an inspection of the error bars in figure  [ fig : mlr ] . )",
    "one intriguing possibility has to do with the metallicity we have assumed for the lmc , using a @xmath121 for the lmc based upon the asplund et al .",
    "( 2009 ) abundances .",
    "what if the appropriate abundance was a little bit higher or a little bit lower ? would that be enough to explain our discrepancy ? to investigate the effect of abundances on the derived masses from the models , we used the solar metallicity ( @xmath120 ) geneva models for comparison , re - deriving the ages and constructing new isochrones . in all cases",
    "the evolutionary masses are about 7% higher for a given luminosity .",
    "( at a given age the mass for a particular luminosity is actually _ lower _ for galactic metallicity than for the lmc , but the isochrones are shifted to cooler temperatures and so one derives a younger age for these stars , and that results in a higher expected mass . ) the median change needed in the models ( table  [ tab : comparisons ] ) is about 11% .",
    "there is no reason to believe this effect is linear , but if it were , explaining the discrepancy by metallicity would require the appropriate models to have much lower metallicities ( @xmath138 ) , lower than what is allowed by observations .",
    "of course , given the complicated nature ( isochrones shifting and different luminosity for a given mass ) , it might be that even slightly lower ( or even slightly higher ) metallicity models might help alleviate the problem .",
    "as more models become available , it will be interesting to test this .",
    "we note that the discrepancy between the dynamical masses and the evolutionary masses we find here is in the same sense as that of the mass discrepancy discussed in the introduction , namely that the masses inferred from the evolutionary tracks are larger masses than those inferred from the surface gravities derived from fitting model atmospheres .",
    "but , there the size of the discrepancy is much larger , sometimes a factor of 2 or more , when present .",
    "we can not , however , use our fastwind modeling to obtain a useful additional estimate of the mass .",
    "the uncertainty in fitting @xmath139 to the tomographically separated spectra is about 0.2  dex .",
    "an error of 0.2  dex translates to an uncertainty of 60% in the masses , making this not useful for weighing in on the sort of 15% differences we are seeing here .",
    "in addition , we note that fastwind produces values for @xmath139 that are systematically about 0.05 - 0.10  dex smaller than those found using cmfgen ( neugent et al .",
    "2010 ; massey et al .",
    "2011 , in prep . ) .",
    "we note that our fastwind modeling found a @xmath139 of 4.0  dex [ cgs ] , which is consistent with the @xmath139 values we list in tables  [ tab : lmc172231physical ] and [ tab : st228physical ] , derived from the masses and radii from our analysis .",
    "we believe this emphasizes the need for such fundamental data such as ours . with queue or robotic observing on small imaging telescopes , and modern spectrographs on large apertures , obtaining excellent photometry and radial velocities and hence very accurate masses",
    "is now standard .",
    "however , simply relying upon spectral types to assign effective temperatures do not result in bolometric luminosity determinations that are accurate enough to contribute to the discussion .    if the trend is real , what then could be the problem with the models ?",
    "either a higher initial rotation than assumed , or convective overshooting , would extend the size of the convective core in the model , resulting in higher luminosity at a given mass .",
    "ribas et al .",
    "( 2000 ) have argued that convective overshooting is more significant at higher masses , and this may be consistent with what we observe here .",
    "( we are indebted both to the anonymous referee and to georges meynet for correspondence on this point . )",
    "although our empirical data do show a slight  mass discrepancy \" between the keplerian masses , perhaps the real emphasis should be on how well the observations do in fact confirm the evolutionary masses .",
    "this is perhaps the most stringent comparison made for high mass stars , and we should be encouraged that the agreement is as good as it is in the masses .",
    "it is also encouraging that observation and analysis tools have advanced to the point where one can worry about a discrepancy of order 10% in the masses of these stars .",
    "analysis in future papers will either confirm or refute this as a real trend .",

    "<S> the stellar mass - luminosity relation is poorly constrained by observations for high mass stars . </S>",
    "<S> we describe our program to find eclipsing massive binaries in the magellanic clouds using photometry of regions rich in massive stars , and our spectroscopic follow - up to obtain radial velocities and orbits . </S>",
    "<S> our photometric campaign identified 48 early - type periodic variables , of which only 15 ( 31% ) were found as part of the microlensing surveys . </S>",
    "<S> spectroscopy is now complete for 17 of these systems , and in this paper we present analysis of the first two , lmc 172231 and st2 - 28 , simple detached systems of late - type o dwarfs of relatively modest masses . </S>",
    "<S> our orbit analysis yields very precise masses ( @xmath0% ) , and we use tomography to separate the components and determine effective temperatures by model fitting , necessary for determining accurate ( 0.05 - 0.07 dex ) bolometric luminosities in combination with the light - curve analysis . </S>",
    "<S> our approach allows more precise comparisons with evolutionary theory than previously possible . to our considerable surprise </S>",
    "<S> , we find a small , but significant , systematic discrepancy : all of the stars are slightly under - massive , by typically 11% ( or over - luminous by 0.2 dex ) compared to that predicted by the evolutionary models . </S>",
    "<S> we examine our approach for systematic problems , but find no satisfactory explanation . </S>",
    "<S> the discrepancy is in the same sense as the long - discussed and elusive discrepancy between the masses measured from stellar atmosphere analysis with the stellar evolutionary models , and might suggest that either increased rotation or convective overshooting is needed in the models . </S>",
    "<S> additional systems will be discussed in future papers of this series , and will hopefully confirm or refute this trend . </S>"
