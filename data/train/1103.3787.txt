    "basic concept of associative memories in artificial neural networks was already proposed in early 70 s by a japanese engineer kaoru nakano @xcite . unfortunately , in that time , nobody interested in his model , however in 80 s , j.j .",
    "hopfield @xcite pointed out that there exists an energy function ( lyapunov function ) in the so - called _ associatron _ ( the nakano model ) and the system can be treated as a kind of spin glasses .",
    "after his study , a lot of researchers who were working in the research field of condensed matter physics picked the so - called _ hopfield model _",
    "up for their brand - new ` target materials ' .    among these studies , a remarkable progress has been done by three theoretical physicists amit , gutfreund and sompolinsky @xcite who clearly ( mathematically ) defined the concept of _ storage capacity _ in the hopfield model as a critical point at which system undergoes phase transitions from ferromagnetic retrieval to spin glass phases by utilizing the replica method .",
    "they also introduced a noise to prevent the network from retrieving one of the built - in patterns as a ` heat bath ' which surrounds the neurons .",
    "they draw the phase diagram which is composed of three distinct phases , namely , ferromagnetic - retrieval , paramagnetic and spin glass phases .",
    "these phase boundaries are specified by two control parameters , namely , storage capacity and temperature of the heat bath .    to evaluate the storage capacity of the hopfield model without energy function ( for instance , hopfield model having a non - monotonic input - output function @xcite ) , shiino and fukai @xcite proposed the so - called self - consistent signal - to - noise analysis ( scsna ) which enables us to derive a couple of self - consistent macroscopic equations of state by making use of the concept of the tap equations @xcite .",
    "as we mentioned , these theoretical arguments are constructed for the case in which each neuron is surrounded by a heat bath at finite temperature . in this sense",
    ", the above studies revealed the robustness of the associative memories against _ thermal noises _ in the artificial brain .",
    "however , we might consider a different kind of such noises , that is , _",
    "quantum - mechanical noise_. as such successful attempts , ma and gong @xcite , nishimori and nonomura @xcite independently introduced the quantum - mechanical noise to the conventional hopfield model by adding the transverse field to the classical hamiltonian ( from now on , we shall refer the model as _ quantum hopfield model _ ) . especially , nishimori and nonomura @xcite investigated the structure of retrieval phase diagrams by using of the standard replica method with the assistance of the static approximation .",
    "therefore , we might say that the equilibrium properties of the hopfield model were now well - understood and the methodology to investigate the model was already established .",
    "on the other hand , theory of the dynamics to evaluate the pattern - recalling processes is not yet well - established .",
    "however , up to now , several powerful approaches were proposed .",
    "for instance , amari and maginu @xcite pointed out that the relevant macroscopic quantities in the synchronous neuro - dynamics are the overlap ( the direction cosine ) and the noise variance .",
    "they derived the update equations with respect to these quantities .",
    "after their study , the so - called amari - maginu theory was improved by taking into account the correlations in the noise variances by okada @xcite .    whereas for the asynchronous dynamics , coolen and his co - authors established a general approach , so - called _ dynamical replica theory _ @xcite .",
    "they utilized two assumptions , namely , equipartitioning in the sub - shells and self - averaging of the intrinsic noise distribution to derive the deterministic flow equations for relevant macroscopic quantities .",
    "however , there is no such theoretical framework so far to investigate the pattern - recalling process of the quantum hopfield model systematically .    in this paper",
    ", we propose such a candidate of dynamical theory to deal with the pattern - recalling processes in the quantum hopfield model .",
    "we shall consider the stochastic process of quantum monte carlo method which is applied for the quantum hopfield model and investigate the quantum neuro - dynamics through the differential equations with respect to the macroscopic quantities such as the overlap .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section 2 ,",
    "we explain the basics of the conventional hopfield model and its generic properties .",
    "then , we categorize the model into two distinct classes according to the origin of noises in artificial brain . the quantum hopfield model is clearly defined . in section 3",
    ", we explain the quantum monte carlo method based on the suzuki - trotter decomposition @xcite and consider the stochastic process in order to investigate the pattern - recalling dynamics of the quantum hopfield model . in section 4",
    ", we derive the macroscopic deterministic flow of the overlap between the neuronal state and one of the built - in patterns from the microscopic master equation which describes the stochastic processes in the quantum monte calro method for the quantum hopfield model @xcite .",
    "the general solution of the dynamics is obtained under the so - called static approximation . in the next section 5 ,",
    "we apply our general solution to a special case , namely , sequential recalling the built - in two patterns via asymmetric hebb connections .",
    "the effect of quantum - mechanical noise is compared with that of the conventional thermal noise .",
    "the last section is summary .",
    "in this section , we briefly explain the basics of the conventional hopfield model .",
    "then , we shall divide the model into two classes , namely , the hopfield model put in thermal noises ( the model is referred to as _ classical systems _ ) and the same model in the quantum - mechanical noise ( the model is referred to as _ quantum systems _ ) . in following , we define each of the models explicitly .",
    "let us consider the network having @xmath3-neurons .",
    "each neuron @xmath4 takes two states , namely , @xmath5 ( fire ) and @xmath6 ( stationary ) .",
    "neuronal states are given by the set of variables @xmath4 , that is , @xmath7 .",
    "each neuron is located on a complete graph , namely , graph topology of the network is ` fully - connected ' .",
    "the synaptic connection between arbitrary two neurons , say , @xmath4 and @xmath8 is defined by the following hebb rule : @xmath9 where @xmath10 denote the embedded patterns and each of them is specified by a label @xmath11 .",
    "@xmath12 denotes @xmath13-size matrix and @xmath14 stands for the number of built - in patterns .",
    "we should keep in mind that there exists an energy function ( a lyapunov function ) in the system if the matrix @xmath12 is symmetric .",
    "then , the output of the neuron @xmath15 , that is , @xmath4 is determined by the sign of the local field @xmath16 as @xmath17 where @xmath12 and @xmath18 are elements of @xmath19-size matrices , respectively",
    ". we also defined the overlap ( the direction cosine ) between the state of neurons @xmath20 and one of the built - in patterns @xmath21 by @xmath22 here we should notice that the hamiltonian of the system is given by @xmath23 .",
    "the first term appearing in the left hand side of equation ( [ eq : local ] ) is a contribution from @xmath24 what we call ` condensed patterns ' , whereas the second term stands for the so - called ` cross - talk noise ' . in this paper",
    ", we shall concentrate ourselves to the case in which the second term is negligibly small in comparison with the first term , namely , the case of @xmath25 . in this sense",
    ", we can say that the network is ` far from its saturation ' .      to extend the classical system to the quantum - mechanical variant , we rewrite the local field @xmath16 as follows .",
    "@xmath26 where @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) stands for the @xmath29-component of the pauli matrix .",
    "thus , the hamiltonian @xmath30 is a diagonalized @xmath31-size matrix and the lowest eigenvalue is identical to the ground state of the classical hamiltonian @xmath32 ( @xmath4 is an eigenvalue of the matrix @xmath33 ) .",
    "then , we introduce quantum - mechanical noise into the hopfield neural network by adding the transverse field to the hamiltonian as follows .",
    "@xmath34 where @xmath35 is the @xmath36-component of the pauli matrix and transitions between eigenvectors of the classical hamiltonian @xmath37 are induced due to the off - diagonal elements of the matrix @xmath38 for @xmath39 . in this paper",
    ", we mainly consider the system described by ( [ eq : hami1 ] ) .",
    "the dynamics of the quantum model ( [ eq : hami1 ] ) follows schr@xmath40dinger equation .",
    "thus , we should solve it or investigate the time dependence of the state @xmath41 by using the time - evolutionary operator @xmath42 defined for infinitesimal time @xmath43 as @xmath44 however , even if we carry it out numerically , it is very hard for us to do it with reliable precision because @xmath31-size hamilton matrix becomes huge for the number of neurons @xmath45 as in a realistic brain .",
    "hence , here we use the quantum monte carlo method to simulate the quantum system in our personal computer and consider the stochastic processes of glauber - type to discuss the pattern - recalling dynamics of the quantum hopfield model .",
    "the difficulty to carry out algebraic calculations in the model system is due to the non - commutation operators appearing in the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hami1 ] ) , namely , @xmath46 .",
    "thus , we use the following suzuki - trotter decomposition @xcite in order to deal with the system as a classical spin system .",
    "@xmath47 where @xmath48 denotes the ` inverse temperature ' and @xmath49 is the number of the trotter slices , for which the limit @xmath50 should be taken .",
    "thus , one can deal with @xmath51-dimensional quantum system as the corresponding ( @xmath52)-dimensional classical system .",
    "in the previous section , we mentioned that we should simulate the quantum hopfield model by means of the quantum monte carlo method to reveal the quantum neuro - dynamics through the time - dependence of the macroscopic quantities such as the overlap .",
    "however , in general , it is also very difficult to simulate the quantum - mechanical properties at the ground state by a personal computer even for finite size systems ( @xmath53 ) .    with this fact in mind , in this section , we attempt to derive the macroscopic flow equations from the microscopic master equation for the classical system regarded as the quantum system in terms of the suzuki - trotter decomposition .",
    "this approach is efficiently possible because the hopfield model is a fully - connected mean - field model such as the sherrington - kirkpatrick model @xcite for spin glasses and its equilibrium properties are completely determined by several order parameters .      after the suzuki - trotter decomposition ( [ eq : st ] )",
    ", we obtain the local field for the neuron @xmath15 located on the @xmath54-th trotter slice as follows .",
    "@xmath55 where parameter @xmath56 is related to the amplitude of the transverse field ( the strength of the quantum - mechanical noise ) @xmath57 by @xmath58 in the classical limit @xmath59 , the parameter @xmath56 goes to infinity . for the symmetric matrix @xmath12 ,",
    "the hamiltonian ( scaled by @xmath48 ) of the system is given by @xmath60 .",
    "then , the transition probability which specifies the glauber dynamics of the system is given by @xmath61 $ ] .",
    "more explicitly , @xmath62 denotes the probability that an arbitrary neuron @xmath63 changes its state as @xmath64 within the time unit .",
    "therefore , the probability that the neuron @xmath63 takes @xmath65 is obtained by setting @xmath66 in the above @xmath62 and we immediately find @xmath67 with probability @xmath68 in the limit of @xmath69 which implies the classical limit @xmath59 .",
    "hence , the probability that a microscopic state including the @xmath49-trotter slices @xmath70 obeys the following master equation : @xmath71 \\label{eq : master}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath72 denotes a single spin flip operator for neuron @xmath15 on the trotter slice @xmath54 as @xmath64 .",
    "when we pick up the overlap between neuronal state @xmath73 and one of the built - in patterns @xmath21 , namely , @xmath74 as a relevant macroscopic quantity , the joint distribution of the set of the overlaps @xmath75 at time @xmath76 is written in terms of the probability for realizations of microscopic states @xmath77 at the same time @xmath76 as @xmath78 where we defined the sums by @xmath79 taking the derivative of equation ( [ eq : pt0 ] ) with respect to @xmath76 and substituting ( [ eq : master ] ) into the result , we have the following differential equations for the joint distribution @xmath80 d\\xi^{\\nu }   \\nonumber \\\\ \\mbox { } & \\times &   \\frac { \\sum_{\\{\\mbox{\\boldmath $ \\sigma$}_{k}\\ } } p_{t}(\\{\\mbox{\\boldmath $ \\sigma$}_{k}\\ } ) \\xi^{\\nu } \\tanh[\\beta \\phi ( k ) ] \\prod_{k , i } \\delta ( m_{k}^{\\nu}-m_{k}^{\\nu}(\\mbox{\\boldmath $ \\sigma$}_{k } ) )   } { \\sum_{\\{\\mbox{\\boldmath $ \\sigma$}_{k}\\ } } p_{t}(\\{\\mbox{\\boldmath $ \\sigma$}_{k}\\ } ) \\prod_{k } \\delta ( m_{k}^{\\nu}-m_{k}^{\\nu}(\\mbox{\\boldmath $ \\sigma$}_{k } ) ) } { \\biggr \\ } } \\nonumber \\\\ \\mbox { } & \\times & \\delta ( \\sigma ( k + 1)-\\sigma_{i}(k + 1 ) )   \\delta ( \\sigma ( k -1)-\\sigma_{i}(k - 1 ) )   \\label{eq : dpmkdt}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we introduced several notations @xmath81 \\equiv    \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i}\\delta ( \\xi^{\\nu}-\\xi_{i}^{\\nu } ) \\label{eq : defdxi}\\ ] ] @xmath82 for simplicity .    here",
    "we should notice that if the local field @xmath83 is independent of the microscopic variable @xmath84 , one can get around the complicated expectation of the quantity @xmath85 $ ] over the time - dependent gibbs measurement which is defined in the sub - shell : @xmath86 .",
    "as the result , only procedure we should carry out to get the deterministic flow is to calculate the data average ( the average over the built - in patterns ) .",
    "however , unfortunately , we clearly find from equation ( [ eq : local2 ] ) that the local field depends on the @xmath84 . to overcome the difficulty and to carry out the calculation",
