    "interest is surging on vehicular networks and connected vehicle technology due to their increasingly important role in improving road traffic efficiency , enhancing road safety and providing real - time information to drivers and passengers @xcite .",
    "two major wireless communication modes : vehicle - to - infrastructure ( v2i ) communications and vehicle - to - vehicle ( v2v ) communications , are supported in vehicular networks . v2v and v2i communications",
    "can be realized by deploying wireless communication infrastructure points along the roadside ( e.g. , road - side units ( rsu ) , or lte base stations ) , equipping vehicles with on - board communication facilities ( e.g. , on - board units ( obu ) ) , and with the assistance of dedicated short - range communication ( dsrc ) @xcite and lte technology .",
    "v2i and v2v communications , on one hand , are both major techniques to disseminate data for vehicular applications , including safety applications like disseminating real - time information about traffic accidents , traffic congestion or obstacles in the road , and non - safety applications such as offering value - added services ( e.g. , digital maps with real - time traffic status ) and in - car entertainment services @xcite . on the other hand , as pointed out in the literature , purely relying on v2i communications or v2v communications alone can not meet the diverse communication requirements of different vehicular applications .",
    "for instance , v2v communications may become unreliable when the number of hops in the communication becomes large @xcite .",
    "they may also not be supported and incur long communication delay when the vehicular density is low @xcite .",
    "furthermore , v2i communications may have limited availability , especially in rural areas and in the initial deployment phase of vehicular networks due to the high deployment cost .",
    "the aforementioned factors may result in frequent interruptions in data transmissions , especially when downloading files of large sizes from the internet , e.g. , in - car entertainment services .",
    "therefore , v2i and v2v communications have to co - exist and complement each other to improve the network performance .",
    "capacity is one of the most important performance metrics in vehicular networks .",
    "capacity of vehicular networks with infrastructure support is both an interesting and challenging problem as the capacity is determined by the inter - play of multiple factors including v2i communications , v2v communications , density and mobility of vehicles , and cooperation among vehicles and infrastructure . since the seminal work of gupta and kumar @xcite , extensive research on capacity has been conducted , e.g. , @xcite . focusing on the capacity of vehicular networks , wang et al .",
    "@xcite studied urban vehicular networks with uniformly distributed rsus and analyzed the asymptotic uplink throughput scaling law when the total number of vehicles is sufficiently large . in @xcite , huang et al . introduced a euclidean planar graph and used a practical geometric structure to study the asymptotic capacity of urban vehicular ad hoc networks ( vanets )",
    "the aforementioned work all assumed that the number of vehicles or vehicular density is sufficiently large and utilized asymptotic analysis to study the capacity scaling law , which is only applicable when the number of vehicles or vehicular density is sufficiently large . in our previous work @xcite , we considered a vehicular network scenario where there is only one vehicle , termed vehicle - of - interest ( voi ) , with download request from the internet and all other vehicles cooperate to assist the communication of the voi , and analyzed the achievable throughput of the voi assuming a cooperative communication strategy .",
    "the scenario being studied correspond to a sparse network scenario where there are a very small number of vehicles with download requests .    in this paper",
    ", we consider a typical delay - tolerant application scenario with a subset of vehicles , termed vehicles of interest ( vois ) , having download requests .",
    "each voi downloads a distinct large - size file from the internet and other vehicles without download requests , termed _ _ , assist the delivery of the files to the vois .",
    "a cooperative communication strategy is proposed that explores the combined use of v2i communications , v2v communications , mobility of vehicles and cooperation among vehicles and infrastructure to improve the capacity of vehicular network .",
    "an analytical framework is developed to model the data dissemination process using this strategy , and a closed form expression of the capacity is obtained , which reveals the relationship between the capacity and its major performance - impacting parameters such as inter - infrastructure distance , radio ranges of infrastructure and vehicles , sensing range of vehicles , transmission rates of v2i and v2v communications , vehicular density and the proportion of vois .",
    "numerical result shows that the proposed cooperative communication strategy significantly boosts the capacity of vehicular networks , especially when the proportion of vois is low .",
    "different from the single - voi scenario studied in @xcite , when there are multiple vehicles with download requests , the possible contention and collision among vehicles in vehicular communications become both important and challenging issue to study .",
    "furthermore , the work presented in this paper distinguishes from previous work @xcite in that we focus on an accurate analysis ( versus asymptotic analysis ) of the capacity of vehicular networks with a moderate vehicular density and explore the combined use of v2i communications , v2v communications , mobility of vehicles and cooperation among vehicles and infrastructure to improve the achievable capacity of vehicular network , whereas the results obtained in previous work @xcite are only applicable when the number of vehicles or vehicular density is very large .",
    "specifically , the following contributions are made in the paper :    1 .",
    "we propose a novel cooperative communication strategy , which utilizes v2i communications , v2v communications , mobility of vehicles , and cooperation among vehicles and infrastructure to boost capacity of vehicular networks ; 2 .",
    "we develop an analytical framework to model and investigate the data dissemination process assuming the aforementioned cooperative communication strategy , and a closed - form expression of the capacity achieved by the vois in a vehicular network with a finite vehicular density is obtained , which reveals the relationship between the capacity and its major performance - impacting parameters ; 3 .",
    "both simulations and numerical analysis are conducted , which show that the proposed cooperative strategy significantly improves the capacity of vehicular networks , compared with its non - cooperative counterpart , even when the proportion of vois is small .",
    "our results shed light on the optimum deployment of vehicular network infrastructure in terms of their interval distance , and the optimum design of cooperative communication strategy to improve the capacity of vehicular networks .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows : section [ sec : related - work ] reviews related work . section [ sec : system - model - and ] introduces the system model , the proposed cooperative communication strategy and the problem formation .",
    "theoretical analysis of the v2i communications , v2v communications and the capacity are provided in section [ sec : theoretical - analysis ] . in section",
    "[ sec : simulation - and - discussion ] , we validate the analytical result using simulations and conduct further numerical analysis to discuss our result and its insight . section [ sec : conclusion - and - future ] concludes this paper .",
    "extensive work in the literature investigated the performance of vehicular networks , measured by the information propagation speed @xcite , transmission delay @xcite , downloaded data volume @xcite , packet reception rate @xcite , etc . among the major techniques to enhance these performance measures , cooperative communications , including cooperation among vehicles , cooperation among infrastructure points @xcite , and cooperation among both vehicles and infrastructure points @xcite , stands out as a popular and important technique . in the following , we review work closely related to the work in this paper .",
    "the following work investigated cooperative communications among vehicles in vehicular networks . in @xcite , zhu et al . studied using multiple nearby vehicles to collaboratively download data from a rsu and analyzed the average download time using network coding techniques . in @xcite , zhou et al . introduced a cooperative communication strategy using a cluster of vehicles on the highway to cooperatively download the same file from the infrastructure to enhance the probability of successful download . in @xcite ,",
    "liu et al . proposed a centralized cooperative data dissemination scheduling scheme that utilizes the location information of each vehicle and cooperation among vehicles to maximize the number of vehicles that successfully retrieve their requested data in vehicular networks . in @xcite ,",
    "das et al . introduced a coalitional graph game to model cooperative message sharing among vehicles in vehicular networks and proposed a coalition formation algorithm to improve the efficiency of the network in terms of improving the packet reception rate and reducing transmission delay .",
    "cooperation among infrastructure points can be achieved by caching different files or different parts of a file into different infrastructure points to help moving vehicles download from the internet . in @xcite , to fully utilize the bandwidth provided by aps , zhang and yeo proposed a cooperative content distribution strategy for vehicles by prefetching different data into some selected aps , so that vehicles can obtain the complete data from those selected aps when traveling through their coverage areas . in @xcite , li et al .",
    "proposed a heuristic content distribution algorithm that caches data in different infrastructure points by taking data delay and each infrastructure point s storage limit into account , to maximize the downloaded data size . in @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "the authors proposed a cooperative content dissemination scheme utilizing cooperative infrastructure points in vehicular networks to maximize the success probability of download , utilizing greedy algorithm and integer linear programming optimization respectively .",
    "studies considering both vehicular cooperation and infrastructure cooperation are comparatively scarce . by exploring cooperation among vehicles and inter - connected infrastructure points , mershad et al .",
    "@xcite designed an optimum routing algorithm to reduce end - to - end delay for delivering a packet from a source to its destination ; and si et al .",
    "@xcite designed an optimum distributed data hopping mechanism to enable delay - tolerant data routing over a vehicular network . in @xcite , wang et al .",
    "proposed a scheme that utilizes moving vehicles to serve as relays to assist data dissemination to a target vehicle , and the relay selection was conducted by the cooperative infrastructure points .",
    "they focused on reducing the transmission outage of the target vehicle .    in this paper , we propose a cooperative communication strategy that explores the combined use of v2i communications , v2v communications , mobility of vehicles and cooperation among vehicles and infrastructure to improve the capacity of vehicular network , and analyze the data dissemination process and the capacity of the network .",
    "in this section , we introduce the system model and assumptions used in the analysis , and also give a rigorous definition of the problem studied in the paper .",
    "specially , we consider a scenario where some vois ( with proportion @xmath0 ) want to download large files , e.g. , videos , from a remote server and the file to be downloaded by different voi is different .",
    "we consider a bi - directional highway segment with length @xmath1 where roadside infrastructure , e.g. , rsus , wi - fi aps or lte base stations , are uniformly deployed along the highway and separated by equal distance @xmath2 .",
    "the width of a lane is typically small compared with the transmission range of vehicles .",
    "therefore , we ignore the road width and model multiple lanes in the same direction as one lane @xcite .",
    "we further assume that all infrastructure points are connected to the internet through wired or wireless backbone with much larger capacity than the vehicular network .",
    "we adopt a widely used traffic model in highway @xcite that the distribution of eastbound and westbound vehicles follows a homogeneous poisson process with densities @xmath3 and @xmath4 respectively .",
    "it follows that the inter - vehicle distances in each direction are exponentially distributed .",
    "this exponential inter - vehicle spacing distribution has been supported by some empirical study that it can accurately characterize real traffic distribution when the traffic density is low or medium @xcite .",
    "furthermore , as a ready consequence of the superposition property of poisson processes @xcite , all vehicles on the highway are also poissonly distributed with density @xmath5 .",
    "we assume that the proportion of vois travel towards each direction is @xmath6 ( @xmath7 .",
    "therefore , vois and _ _ _ _ respectively have traffic density @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "moreover , we assume that eastbound and westbound vehicles travel at a constant speed of @xmath10 and @xmath11 respectively . in reality , individual vehicular speed may deviate from the mean speed .",
    "however , we will show later that our analysis also applies to other time - varying speed model , e.g. , gaussian speed model @xcite .",
    "the system model is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : system model ] .    .",
    "the density and speed of vehicles in each direction are @xmath3 , @xmath10 and @xmath4 , @xmath11 respectively.[fig : system model ] , width=287 ]      both v2i and v2v communications are considered .",
    "all infrastructure points are assumed to have the same radio range , denoted by @xmath12 ; and all vehicles are assumed to have the same radio range , denoted by @xmath13 . a pair of vehicles ( or vehicle and infrastructure )",
    "can directly communicate with each other if and only if ( iff ) their euclidean distance is not larger than the radio range @xmath13 ( or @xmath12 ) .",
    "this simplified unit disk model has been extensively used in the field @xcite .",
    "it grossly captures the fact that all wireless devices have a limited transmission range and that the closer two devices become , the easier it is for them to establish a connection .",
    "we consider a prioritized v2i transmitting scheme that infrastructure will transmit its data to vois first , i.e. , _ _ can receive data from infrastructure only when there is no voi within the coverage of infrastructure .",
    "for v2v communications , _ _ function as transmitters and vois as receivers .",
    "a transmitter can choose a receiver from either direction within its transmission range .",
    "we limit both v2i and v2v communications to one - hop . _ _",
    "now we introduce the cooperative communication strategy considered in this paper .",
    "as mentioned previously , we consider a scenario where some vois ( with proportion @xmath0 ) want to download large files , e.g. , videos , from a remote server and the file to be downloaded by different voi is different .",
    "each requested large file by the vois may be first split into multiple pieces and transmitted to different infrastructure points such that each infrastructure point has a different piece of that file , which enables cooperation among infrastructure .",
    "each piece of data delivered to infrastructure may be further split and transmitted either directly to the corresponding voi requesting it or _ _ to _ _ _ _ when they move into its coverage so that vois and _ _ have different pieces of data . each",
    "_ _ may store data for different vois .",
    "we assume there is a central server that has full knowledge of the data transmission process to guarantee that the data the _ _ receive from infrastructure is the data required by the vois they will encounter .",
    "this assumption helps to establish the maximum capacity that can be achieved .",
    "therefore , when the vois are in the coverage of infrastructure , they receive data directly from the infrastructure . in the meantime , the _ _ may also receive different pieces of data from the infrastructure when they obtain access to the infrastructure .",
    "when the vois move outside the coverage of infrastructure , they may continue to receive data from _",
    "_ , exploiting the mobility of vehicles and v2v communications .",
    "in this way , v2i communications between the vois and infrastructure , between _ _ and infrastructure , v2v communications between the vois and _ _ , cooperations among infrastructure and among vehicles , as well as vehicular mobility are coherently combined to maximize the capacity of the vois .",
    "furthermore , we consider that some practical issues like out of sequence data delivery can be handled by techniques such as network coding ( e.g. , our previous paper @xcite ) so that we can focus on the main theme of the paper without the need for considering their impacts .",
    "now we give a formal definition of the capacity considered in this paper .",
    "consider an arbitrarily chosen time interval @xmath14 $ ] and denote the amount of data received by all vois as @xmath15 during this time interval , which includes data received both directly from infrastructure and indirectly from _ _ . in this paper , we are interested in finding the long - term achievable capacity of the vois using our cooperative communication strategy , where the long - term capacity , denoted by @xmath16 , is formally defined as follows : @xmath17",
    "in this section , we will give detailed analysis of the achievable capacity by the vois , including analyzing the capacity achieved directly from infrastructure through v2i communications and the capacity achieved indirectly from _ _ through v2v communications .",
    "we define the area covered by one infrastructure point ( termed _ v2i area _ ) and the adjacent area between two consecutive infrastructure points but not covered by the infrastructure point ( termed _ v2v area _ ) as a _ cycle _ , which has length @xmath18 .",
    "[ cycle ] for an illustration .",
    "it follows from the renewal theory @xcite that the long - term achievable capacity by the vois from each cycle , denoted by @xmath19 , is identical and the total capacity achieved in a given highway segment with length @xmath20 can be readily calculated by ( ignoring the trivial fact that @xmath21 may not be an integer ) : @xmath22     , width=302 ]    from , to calculate the total capacity achievable by the vois from a highway segment with length @xmath1 , it suffices to calculate the capacity achieved by the vois from one cycle , which includes capacity achieved both from v2i communications and v2v communications , given as follows : @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are respectively the expected amount of data received by the vois from infrastructure in the v2i area and from _ _ in the v2v area during time period @xmath26 . in the following ,",
    "we will focus on studying one cycle entirely contained within the highway segment of length @xmath1 , termed the _ cycle of interest_. we will first calculate the two terms on the right hand side of separately , and then combine both terms to obtain the final expression of the achievable capacity .      without loss of generality , we call the infrastructure point located in our cycle of interest @xmath27 .",
    "we assume that time is divided into time slots of equal length @xmath28 , and @xmath28 is sufficiently small that we can approximately regard vehicles as stationary during each time slot .",
    "denote by @xmath29 a discrete random variable representing the fraction of time that vois v2i communication with @xmath27 happens during the @xmath30th time slot @xmath31 . recall that infrastructure delivers its data directly to the vois as long as there are vois within its coverage .",
    "therefore , @xmath32 is equal to 1 when there exist at least one vois within the coverage of @xmath27 during the @xmath30th time slot ; otherwise it is equal to 0 .",
    "this follows that the expected total amount of data the vois can obtain from one cycle through v2i communications during time period @xmath14 $ ] can be calculated by ( ignoring the trivial fact that @xmath33 may not be an integer ) : @xmath34    according to the ergodicity and stationarity properties of homogeneous poisson point process @xcite , the time average of @xmath32 is equal to the probability that there is at least one voi within the coverage of @xmath27 at a randomly chosen time slot , denoted by @xmath35 .",

    "therefore , the amount of data the vois can receive from v2v communications during time period @xmath14 $ ] , on one hand , is constrained by how much data the _ _ can receive via their v2i communications during time period @xmath14 $ ] ; on the other hand , is limited by how much data the _ _ can transmit to the vois through v2v communications during time period @xmath26 . taking the above two constraints into account",

    "more specifically , imagine the v2v communication process between _ _ and the vois as a single - queue queuing system . the rate the _ _ receive data from the infrastructure , @xmath43 , is equivalent to the incoming rate of the queue .",
    "the rate the _ _ deliver data to the vois , @xmath42 , is equivalent to the processing speed of the queue .",

    "the capacity achieved from v2v communiactions by the vois ] , to obtain the capacity achieved by the vois through v2v communications with the _ _ from one cycle , it remains to calculate the long - term capacity achieved by the _ _ from one cycle through their v2i communications , @xmath43 , and the long - term capacity the vois can achieve through v2v communications from one cycle without considering the limitation of the amount of data the _ _ received , @xmath42 . in the following , we will calculate these two terms separately .",

    "therefore , the spatial distribution of the vehicles are both stationary and ergodic @xcite ( ignoring the finite length of the road segment @xmath1 ) .",

    "this observation implies that when vehicles arrive following a poisson process , our analysis assuming the constant speed model is also applicable to other time - varying speed model , e.g. , gaussian speed model @xcite , as long as the resulting spatial distribution of vehicles is time - invariant , i.e. , stationary .    in the extreme case when all vehicles have download requests , i.e. , when @xmath103 , the achievable capacity from one cycle is @xmath104 , which is exactly the achievable capacity when all vehicles directly receive data from the infrastructure without cooperative v2v communications .",
    "it can be further established when @xmath6 is greater than a certain threshold , cooperative v2v communications between the _ _ and the vois are of little use in boosting the capacity .",
    "this can be explained by that in the particular scenario considered in the paper , all new data comes from outside the vehicular network .",
    "v2v communications between the _ _ and the vois only help to extend the communication range of the vois when there is no voi in the infrastructure s coverage and balance data among the vois , but can not increase the net amount of data available in the vehicular network .",

    "v2v cooperative communications offer little benefit in boosting the vehicular network capacity .",
    "unsurprisingly , following the argument outlined earlier , when the vehicular density is sufficiently large , even for a small value of @xmath6 , the benefit of v2v cooperative communications vanishes very quickly . this can be also validated using .      in this subsection",

    "is statistically indistinguishable from another voi travels in the same direction , this result suggests that the achievable throughput by a ( any ) voi , no matter which direction the voi is traveling in , will be statistically the same .",
