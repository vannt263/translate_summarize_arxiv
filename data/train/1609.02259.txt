    "event - triggered and self - triggered control have been active areas of research in the community of networked control systems ( ncss ) , due to their potential advantages over the typical time - triggered controllers @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the time - triggered case where the control signals are executed periodically , event - triggered and self - triggered strategies require the executions based on the violation of prescribed control performances , such as input - to - state stability ( iss ) @xcite , lmi based stability conditions @xcite , and @xmath0 gain stability @xcite .",
    "the main difference between these two strategies is that in the event - triggered case an intelligent sensor is required to determine the execution by continuously monitoring the state , while in the self - triggered case the next execution is pre - determined without needing to measure the state continuously . in another line of research ,",
    "model predictive control ( mpc ) has been one of the most successful control strategies applied in a wide variety of applications , such as process industries , robotics , autonomous systems , and moreover , recent research also includes ncss @xcite .",
    "the basic idea of mpc is to obtain the current control action by solving the optimal control problem ( ocp ) online , based on the knowledge about current state and predictive behaviors of the dynamics .",
    "the application of the event - triggered or self - triggered framework to mpc is in particular of importance as the possible way to alleviate communication resources for ncss . combining these strategies",
    "has been a relatively recent research topic , where most results have been proposed for discrete - time systems see , e.g. , @xcite , while some results have been proposed for continuous - time systems , e.g. , @xcite . in this paper , we propose a new self - triggered mpc for continuous - time linear systems , as an alternative approach to the preliminary works in the literature . in @xcite ,",
    "the self - triggered condition was derived for continuous - time systems , based on the condition that the optimal cost as a lyapunov function is guaranteed to decrease .",
    "since this result considered input - affine systems , it is applicable to the linear case .",
    "however , the self - triggered strategy may lead to a conservative result in the following sense ; the obtained self - triggered condition includes several parameters , such as lipschitz constant of stage and terminal costs , which are characterized by the maximum size of state regions .",
    "depending on the problem formulation , therefore , these parameters are sometimes over - approximated and the corresponding self - triggered condition may then become conservative .",
    "a related work is also reported in @xcite , where the authors proposed an event - triggered scheme for continuous - time systems . in their approach , the ocp is solved only when the error between the actual and predictive state exceeds a certain thereshold .",
    "the self - triggered strategy proposed in this paper takes a different problem formulation from previous works in the literature .",
    "the basic idea is to parallelly solve ocps , which provides different transmission time intervals under a piece - wise constant control policy .",
    "based on the different solutions , the controller then selects one solution providing the largest transmission time interval while at the same time guaranteeing the control performance .",
    "the new formulation of the proposed self - triggered strategy leads to the following main contributions of this paper with respect to the earlier approaches :    1 .",
    "the proposed self - triggered strategy does not include parameters ( such as lipschitz constant parameters ) that may be the potential source of conservativeness .",
    "the simulation result also illustrates that less conservative results can be obtained than the previous framework .",
    "the optimal costs can be compared under various transmission time intervals .",
    "this allows us to obtain the desired control performance by evaluating how much this becomes better or worse according to different values of transmission time intervals .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , the ocp is formulated . in section iii ,",
    "the self - triggered strategy is provided . in section iv ,",
    "the feasibility of our proposed algorithm and the stability are investigated . in section",
    "v , the proposed scheme is validated through a numerical example .",
    "we finally conclude in section vi .",
    "the notations used in the sequel are as follows : @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 are the real , non - negative real , non - negative integers and positive integers , respectively . for a matrix @xmath5",
    ", we use @xmath6 to denote that @xmath5 is positive definite .",
    "denote @xmath7 as the euclidean norm of vector @xmath8 .",
    "we consider a networked control system depicted in fig.[network ] .",
    "the dynamics of the plant are assumed to be given by the following linear continuous - time invariant system : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the state and @xmath11 is the control variable .",
    "we assume that the pair @xmath12 is stabilizable , and @xmath13 is subject to the constraint @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is a compact subset containing the origin in the interior .",
    "the control objective for the mpc is to drive the state to the origin , i.e. , @xmath16 , as @xmath17 .",
    "let @xmath18 , @xmath19 be the time instants when ocps are solved ; at @xmath18 , the controller solves an ocp based on the knowledge about the state @xmath20 , and the dynamics given by . in this paper , we consider the following cost function to be minimized : @xmath21 where @xmath22 , @xmath23 are the matrices for the stage cost , @xmath24 is the matrix for the terminal cost , and @xmath25 is the prediction horizon .",
    "more detailed characterization of @xmath26 will be discussed in later sections .    in order to derive a self - triggered strategy",

    "the plant then applies it as sample - and - hold fashion until the next transmission time @xmath30 ( blue line ) , and sends back the new state measurement to the controller .",
    ", width=302 ]    this discretizing scheme is motivated as follows : the solution of the ocp by minimizing the cost is in general given by a continuous trajectory of the optimal control input , say @xmath31 , for all @xmath32 $ ] . if the optimal control input _",
    "could _ be applied until @xmath33 , i.e. , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , then we could utilize the classic mpc result to guarantee the asymptotic stability of the origin , see @xcite . however , applying the continuous trajectory of the control input is not suited for practical ncss applications in terms of the two aspects .",
    "firstly , transmitting continuous control trajectory over the network requires an infinite - transmission bandwidth , which is un - realizable . secondly ,",
    "implementing the exact continuous control input is difficult for embedded control system architectures , since they only deal with samples as a discrete time domain , resulting in applying the control input eventually as a sampled - and - hold implementation at a high frequency .",
    "as the actual control trajectory for this case possibly differs from the optimal control trajectory , it fails to guarantee the asymptotic stability of the origin .",
    "the ocp under the piece - wise constant control policy considered in this paper thus provides the optimal control sequence at discrete sampling intervals , i.e. , @xmath36 rather than the whole control trajectory @xmath37 $ ] . as the procedure of transmitting control samples , we consider the following steps ; ( i ) the controller transmits the optimal control sample @xmath38 to the plant ; ( ii ) the plant then applies @xmath38 at constant until @xmath39 ; ( iii ) the plant sends back a new state measurement @xmath40 to the controller to solve the next ocp at @xmath33",
    ". under this procedure ,",
    "the transmission time interval is then given by @xmath41 .    applying the above transmission procedure",
    "not only allows the controller to transmit control command as a sample , but also allows us to formulate the ocp as the discrete time domain .",
    "the main difference of the problem formulation with respect to the periodic ( or event - triggered ) mpc for general discrete time systems is , however , that we are now free to select the sampling time intervals @xmath42 in an appropriate way .",
    "although there is a flexibility to select @xmath42 , these intervals must be carefully determined such that :    1 .",
    "the asymptotic stability of the origin is guaranteed under mpc with the piece - wise constant control policy .",
    "the reduction of communication load is achieved through the self - triggered formulation .    in the next subsection",
    ", we provide one possible way to determine the sampling time intervals @xmath42 , such that the above problems can be tackled .      under the piece - wise constant control policy outlined in fig.[piecewise ] , the sampling time intervals are determined in this subsection . by making use of the flexibility of selecting the sampling time intervals ,",
    "consider at first that we have _ multiple patterns _ of sampling time intervals , i.e. , we have @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) different sampling patterns in total , where each @xmath45-th ( @xmath46 sampling pattern has @xmath47 sampling intervals , @xmath48 .",
    "more specifically , in this paper we consider the sampling patterns as shown in fig.[controlpatterns ]",
    ". stated formally , for given @xmath49 , where @xmath50 and @xmath51 represents the maximum number of sampling intervals among all patterns , and @xmath52 , the sampling time intervals for the @xmath45-th ( @xmath53 ) pattern are given by @xmath54 with @xmath55 .",
    "that is , the 1@xmath56 pattern has the same interval : @xmath57 .",
    "the 2@xmath58 pattern is the same as the 1@xmath56 pattern only except the first sampling interval : @xmath59 , @xmath60 .",
    "similarly , for the general @xmath45-th pattern we have @xmath61 , and @xmath62 for the remaining intervals .",
    "the controller solves the corresponding ocps under all sampling patterns above , and then selects one sampling pattern according to the self - triggered strategy proposed in the next section .",
    "the main motivation of using the sampling patterns shown in fig.[controlpatterns ] , is that it allows to evaluate the trade - off between the transmission interval and the control performance quantitatively .",
    "according to the transmission procedure given in the previous subsection , the transmission time interval is given by @xmath63 .",
    "thus , using larger patterns leads to longer transmission intervals . from the self - triggered point of view",
    ", it is desirable to have larger patterns .",
    "however , as we will see in the analysis that follows , the control performance instead becomes worse ; this will be proved by the fact that the optimal cost becomes larger as larger patterns are selected .",
    "in later sections , we will provide a framework of selecting one sampling pattern , such that the trade - off between the transmission time interval and the control performance can be taken into account .",
    "if the number of patterns @xmath43 is chosen larger , then we may increase the possibility to have longer transmission time intervals .",
    "however , since this leads to the requirement of solving larger number of ocps at the same time , it will also induce time delays for obtaining optimal solutions under all sampling patterns .",
    "we will note in later remarks that existing delay compensation strategies may serve as a solution to this problem .          in this subsection",

    "to arrive at the self - triggered strategy , we will in the following derive some useful properties for the optimal costs obtained under different sampling patterns .",

    "since @xmath112 is a feasible controller for the @xmath114-th pattern , we obtain @xmath116 and the above inequality holds for all @xmath117 .",
    "the proof is thus complete .",
    "lemma[lem1 ] states that the 1@xmath56 pattern provides the best control performance in the sense that the optimal cost takes the minimum value among all patterns , and moreover , the control performance becomes worse as larger patterns are selected .",
    "the next lemma states that the optimal cost is guaranteed to decrease whenever the 1@xmath56 pattern is used :    [ lem2 ] suppose that the @xmath45-th pattern was used at @xmath118 and the next time to solve the ocp is given by @xmath119 . then , under assumption[terminal ] , the optimal cost satisfies @xmath120    ( sketch ) let @xmath121 be the optimal control input and the corresponding state sequence obtained at @xmath118 under the @xmath45-th pattern .",

    "2 .   at @xmath18 , @xmath141 ,",
    "the controller solves problem 1 for all patterns @xmath142 based on @xmath20 .",

    "the controller selects one pattern @xmath148 by solving the following problem ; @xmath149 subject to + @xmath150 + @xmath151 + where @xmath152 and @xmath153 are the constant parameters , satisfying @xmath154 , @xmath155 .",
    "4 .   the controller transmits @xmath134 , and then the plant applies @xmath134 as sample - and - hold implementation until @xmath156 .",
    "the plant then sends back @xmath40 to the controller as a new current state measurement .",
    "the main point of our proposed algorithm is the way to select the pattern @xmath133 given in the step ( iii ) . from lemma[lem1 ] , the 1@xmath56 pattern provides the minimum cost among all sampling patterns .",
    "thus , the first condition implies that larger patterns are allowed to be selected to obtain longer transmission intervals , but the optimal cost should not go far from the 1@xmath56 pattern ; the optimal cost is allowed to be larger only by @xmath152 from @xmath157 , so that it does not degrade much the control performance .",
    "thus , the parameter @xmath152 plays a role to regulate the trade - off between the control performance and the transmission time intervals .",
    "that is , a smaller @xmath152 leads to better control performance ( but resulting in less transmissions ) , and larger @xmath152 leads to less transmissions ( but resulting in worse control performance ) .",
    "the second condition takes into account the optimal cost obtained at the previous time @xmath118 , and this aims at guaranteeing the asymptotic stability of the origin . note that @xmath153 needs to satisfy @xmath155 .",
    "as we will describe in the next section , this condition ensures that algorithm 1 is always implementable .",
    "since it is desirable to reduce the communication load as much as possible , the controller selects the pattern providing the largest transmission interval satisfying , , i.e. , max @xmath45 in .",
    "the main advantage of using the proposed method is that the optimal cost @xmath158 can be compared not only with the previous one @xmath159 , but also with the current ones obtained at @xmath18 under different sampling patterns .",
    "this allows us not only to ensure stability , but also to evaluate how much the control performance becomes better or worse according to the transmission time intervals .",
    "note that the control performance may also be regulated through the tuning of @xmath153 in .",
    "however , due to the condition @xmath155 , we can not select @xmath153 large enough such that small patterns ( good control performance ) are ensured to be obtained . thus the desired control performance can be suitably specified through the first condition , rather than .",
    "note also that in contrast to our preliminary work in @xcite , algorithm 1 does not involve parameters such as lipschitz constants for the stage and the terminal cost .",
    "since these parameters involve the maximum distance of the state from the origin , i.e. , @xmath160 ( see e.g. , _ lemma 3.2 _ in @xcite ) , they may need to be over - approximated and the self - triggered condition may then become conservative .",
    "we will also illustrate through a simulation example that the proposed method attains a less conservative result than the previous approach .",
    "the main drawback of algorithm 1 is the requirement of solving multiple ocps at the same time , which clearly induces a time - delay of transmitting control samples in practical implementations . regarding time delays ,",
    "several methods have been proposed to take them into account and can also be applied to our proposed self - triggered strategy .",
    "for example , a delay compensation strategy has been proposed in @xcite .",
    "when applying this approach , the maximum total time delay @xmath161 needs to be upper bounded to satisfy @xmath162 in order to guarantee stability .",
    "this implies that the condition @xmath163 is required in addition to the conditions , as the rule to choose the sampling pattern .    in the above formulation",
    ", we have not considered any effects of model uncertainties or disturbances .",
    "however , the proposed scheme can be extended to take into account these effects by slightly modifying lemma[lem2 ] .",
    "suppose that the actual state is given by @xmath164 , where @xmath165 denotes additive uncertainties or disturbances satisfying @xmath166 . by utilizing theorem 2 in @xcite",
    ", we can show that there exists a positive @xmath167 such that @xmath168 instead of .",
    "therefore , assuming that @xmath169 is known , the corresponding self - triggered strategy is obtained by adding @xmath170 to the right hand side of .",
    "note that the first condition does not need to be modified , since lemma[lem1 ] still holds even for the disturbance case .",
    "one of the desirable properties of algorithm 1 is to ensure that it is always implementable , i.e. , we need to exclude the case when all the patterns do not satisfy both and .",
    "furthermore , the stability of the closed loop system under algorithm 1 needs to be verified . in the following theorem",
    ", we deduce that both of these properties are satisfied .",
    "consider the networked control system in fig.[network ] where the plant follows the dynamics given by and the proposed self - triggered strategy ( algorithm 1 ) is implemented .",
    "the followings are then satisfied :    1 .",
    "the way to obtain the pattern @xmath133 in step ( iii ) in algorithm  1 , is always feasible .",
    "that is , there exists at least one pattern @xmath171 , satisfying both , for all @xmath172 .",
    "the closed loop system is asymptotically stabilized to the origin .",
    "the proof of ( i ) is obtained by showing that the 1@xmath56 sampling pattern ( @xmath173 ) always satisfies and .",
    "the first condition is clearly satisfied when @xmath173 since @xmath174 .",
    "furthermore , from lemma[lem2 ] , we obtain @xmath175 thus the second condition holds for @xmath173 .",
    "thus the proof of ( i ) is complete .",
    "the proof of ( ii ) is obtained by the fact that the optimal cost decreases along the time sequence . since the optimal cost of the selected pattern satisfies",
    ", we have @xmath176 where the derivation from the first to the second in - equality follows from the definition of the stage cost @xmath177 given by . summing over both sides of the above yields @xmath178",

    "as an illustrative example , we consider the spring - mass system ; the state vector @xmath183 $ ] consists of the position @xmath184 and the velocity @xmath185 , and the dynamics are given by @xmath186x + \\left [ \\begin{array}{c } 0 \\\\ 1/m \\\\ \\end{array } \\right ] u,\\ ] ] where @xmath187 is the spring coefficient and @xmath188 is the mass . the matrices for the stage cost are @xmath189 , @xmath190 , and the prediction horizon is @xmath191 .",
    "the terminal matrix @xmath26 and the local controller @xmath127 are computed properly by following the procedure presented in @xcite .",

    ", the state achieves asymptotic stability of the origin , and larger patterns ( i.e. , longer transmission time intervals ) are more likely to be obtained as the state gets closer to the origin .",
    "one can also see the trade - off between the control performance and the number of transmissions ; faster convergence is achieved when @xmath198 than @xmath199 from the upper figure , while it requires more transmissions of control samples as shown in the lower figure . to compare with the previous framework , we have also plotted the transmission time intervals in fig.[state_patterns ] obtained by the methodology presented in @xcite . here",
