    "a fault - tolerant quantum logic gate@xcite is the central issue in realizing the basic constituents of a quantum information processor .",
    "quantum computation via the controlled geometric phase shift@xcite provides a nice scenario to this purpose . due to its geometric property , a geometric phase@xcite shift can be robust with respect to certain types of operational errors .",
    "in particular , suppose that the spin(qubit ) undergoes a random fluctuation about its path in the evolution .",
    "the final value of the geometric phase shift will not be affected provided that the random fluctuation does not change the total area on bloch sphere@xcite .",
    "recently , it was reported@xcite that the conditional berry phase ( adiabatic cyclic geometric phase ) shift can be used in quantum computation .",
    "in particular , in ref@xcite , an experiment was done with nuclear magnetic resonance(nmr)@xcite under the adiabatic condition .",
    "demand on both running speed and precision of every gate in a quantum computer is quite high . by the available technology at present ( and at near future ) , due to the enviromental noise ,",
    "distortion to a quantum state increases fast with time .",
    "this requires all quantum gates complete the task as fast as possible . however , the schemes raised previously@xcite required the adiabatic condition . that is to say , if we run the gate too fast(i.e .",
    "change the hamiltonian rapidly ) , the distortion from the nonadiabaticity must be significant .",
    "it has been reported in the recent experiment that@xcite , due to the requirement of adiabatic condition , faster running speed causes severe distortions to the results@xcite .",
    "the adiabatic condition makes the fast speed and high precision conflict each other in the conditional berry phase shift gate .",
    "increasing the running speed of the logic gate can exponentially increase the power of a quantum computation such as quantum factorization@xcite .",
    "it seems that the geometric phase shift gate will only be practical if it can run at a speed comparable to that of the usual quantum gate .",

    "the non - zero @xmath6 distorts the state in the evolution and makes it _ noncyclic _ at time @xmath17 .",

    "4 ) in controlling the @xmath80 operation . in particular , for @xmath96 , the value adopted in the recent nmr experiment , the relation curves for @xmath97 vs @xmath4 and @xmath95 vs @xmath4 are shown in fig .",

    "however , here we need again remove the dynamical phase contribution . note the situation here is different from the single qubit case .",
    "qubit @xmath61 could be either up or down .",
    "we need choose the appropriate @xmath6 value so that the instantaneous dynamic phase for qubit @xmath60 is always zero no matter qubit @xmath61 is up or down .",
    "so in this case the following simultaneous conditions are required .",
    "@xmath98 setting @xmath99 will make the simultaneous conditions hold . with this setting",
    "we propose the following scheme to make the @xmath0adiabatic conditional geometric phase shift . @xmath100",

    "@xmath102 represents rotating the external field around @xmath5axis for @xmath15 in a uniform speed @xmath6 .",
    "we should choose the rotating direction so that additional field @xmath6 is anti - parallel the field @xmath103 , ( @xmath104 ) .",
    "since qubit @xmath60 evolves on the dynamical phase free path , the scheme raised here can remove the dynamic phase and retain only the geometric phase .",
    "it can be shown that the geometric phase acquired after the operation is @xmath105 , @xmath106 , @xmath107 and @xmath108 respectively for the four different initial state ( @xmath109 and@xmath110 .",
    "to make a quantum computation , we need both single qubit gates and the two qubit c - not gate .",
    "it is impossible to make any single qubit geometric gate with nmr in the adiabatic condition because the interaction among different qubits can not be switched off . though the interaction is small",
    ", the effects from the interaction may accumulate significantly after a long term .",
    "strictly speaking , the adiabatic geometric quantum computation raised previously@xcite is only a partial geometric quantum computation .",
    "however , in the our non - adiabatic scheme , we can easily make single qubit gate . in this nonadiabatic case , the effect of the interaction among qubits is negnigible because the operation time is very short .    in section",
    "ii , we have required the initial state of the qubit be the eigenstate of the initial hamiltonian , @xmath11 . however",
    ", this requirement is not necessary in making the geometric quantum gates , instead of making geometric phase shift to the qubit directly .",
    "if we are only interested to the geometric quantum gates instead of making the phase shift to the qubit itself , we can directly use arbitrary initial state .",
    "we now demonstrate this by some examples . without any loss of generality",
    ", we suppose the initial state of the single qubit is @xmath111 or @xmath112 .",
    "we start from the phase shift gate .",
    "we set the initial magnetic field @xmath113 in the @xmath88 direction .",
    "we then rotate @xmath114 anti - clockwise around @xmath115 axis .",
    "the rotating angular velocity is @xmath6 .",
    "the angle between @xmath115 and @xmath88 axis is @xmath116 ( see fig .",
    ". meanwhile we add the additional field @xmath6 .",
    "the rotating speed and additional field should satisfy eq.([restr ] ) .",
    "note that in this case , the additional field is in the @xmath117 direction .",
    "after a @xmath15 angle rotation the initial states will gain phase shifts according to the following equation @xmath118 and @xmath119 the phase shift here is determined by area enclosed by the state evolution loop on bloch sphere , i.e. by angle @xmath116 .",
    "since @xmath116 can take arbitrary value , we can make arbitrary phase shift gate through the above equation .",
    "now we consider the hadamad gate , which is another fundamentally important gate in quantum computation .",
    "we come back to @xmath88 axis .",
    "now @xmath116 is the angle between magnetic field @xmath120 and @xmath88 axis . with the constraint of eq([restr ] ) , suppose the additional magnetic field and rotating speed of @xmath114 is @xmath6 .",
    "state @xmath111 or @xmath112 can be written in the following linear superposed forms respectively @xmath121 are the spin states parallel or anti - parallel to the direction of @xmath122 .",
    "after the field rotates one loop around @xmath88 axis , the initial state @xmath111 or @xmath112 changes by the following formula @xmath123 where @xmath124 i.e. @xmath125 here @xmath126 is the geometric phase gained by state @xmath127 after it completes the loop around @xmath88 axis .",
    "if we take @xmath128(root @xmath116 for this equation obviously exists ) , this @xmath129 is @xmath130 here @xmath131 . combining this @xmath132 gate with an appropriate phsae shift gate",
    "we can obtain the hadamad gate .",
    "explicitly we have @xmath133    obviously , by combining the gate @xmath134 and the @xmath135 , we can also make the not gate .",
    "it is @xmath136 the not gate of single qubit played an important role in the adiabatic scheme to cancel the dynamical phase@xcite .",
    "so far we have demonstrated the geometric realization for several types of logic gates in single qubit operation . here",
    "geometric phase is the only contribution in the time evolution . actually , all single qubit gate can be realized in a similar way",
    ". the running speed of the above geometric gates can be in principle arbitrarily fast .      with the conditional geometric phase shift ,",
    "it is very easy to construct the c - not gate .",
    "to do so , we take @xmath137 , then we have @xmath138 and @xmath139 if qubit @xmath61 is up . and",
    "@xmath140 if qubit @xmath61 is down",
    ". we can use a specific phase shift gate @xmath135 on qubit @xmath60 to convert the above form of conditional phase shift gate into @xmath141 sandwitching it by two hadamad gates to the single qubit @xmath60 we obtain the c - not gate , i.e. @xmath142",
    "to make the conditional geometric phase shift gate we need be able to control two elementary operations .",
    "one is to exactly control the cyclic state evolution on a cone ; the other is to produce the initial state on the cone with an angle @xmath143 conditional on the other bit .",
    "previously@xcite , these two elementary operations were done adiabatically .",
    "we have shown that both of these two tasks can be done nonadiabatically .",
    "we have demonstrated the non - adiabatic geometric phase shift and quantum logic gates for both single qubit and two qubit case .",
    "the single qubit geometric gate can run arbitrarily fast in princilpe .",
    "the running speed of two qubit gate is is only limited by the @xmath67 , the value of the qubits interraction .",
    "this is the case for all normal conditional quantum gates .",
    "so it possible to run the geometric quattum gate in a speed comparable to that of the normal quantum gate .",
    "the idea on nonadiabatic geometric phase shift gate demonstrated by the nmr system here should in principle also work for the other two level systems , such as josephson junction system@xcite and the harmonic oscillator system@xcite , where the decoherence time can be much shorter .",
