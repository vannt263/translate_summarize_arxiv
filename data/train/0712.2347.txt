    "the virtual knot theory was introduced by l.  kauffman  @xcite .",
    "let us recall some of its basic notions .",
    "a knot is a smooth embedding @xmath11 .",
    "it can be described by its knot diagram which is a generic immersion of @xmath12 into the @xmath13-plane equipped with information about over - passes and under - passes at double points .",
    "a knot diagram @xmath14 gives rise to a gauss diagram @xmath15 that is a circle parameterizing the knot with each pair of preimages of double points of @xmath14 connected by an oriented signed chord .",
    "the chords are oriented from the preimage point on the over - passing branch to the preimage point on the under - passing branch .",
    "the sign of a chord is the sign of the corresponding double point .",
    "the resulting gauss diagram @xmath15 is called _ the gauss diagram of the knot diagram @xmath14 . _",
    "gauss diagrams that are obtainable as gauss diagrams of some knot diagrams are said to be _ realizable . _",
    "a knot diagram corresponding to a realizable gauss diagram can be recovered only up to a certain ambiguity .",
    "however the isotopy type of the corresponding knot is recoverable in a unique way .",
    "it is well - known that two knots described by their knot diagrams are isotopic if and only if one can change one diagram to another by a sequence of ambient isotopies of the diagram and of _ reidemeister moves _ shown in figure  [ redemeister.fig ] .",
    "the redemeister moves can be easily encoded  @xcite in the language of gauss diagrams , see figure  [ gaussredemeister.fig ] .",
    "the equivalence classes of the , not necessarily realizable , gauss diagrams modulo the resulting moves are called virtual knots .",
    "recall that a bridge in a knot diagram is an arc between two consecutive underpasses that contains nonzero many overpasses .",
    "the bridge number @xmath3 of a knot @xmath2 , is the minimum number of bridges in a knot diagram realizing @xmath16 given a gauss diagram constructed from a knot diagram , the number of bridges in it is the number of circle arcs between two consecutive arrow heads that contain nonzero many arrow ends .",
    "note that this number is well defined even for nonrealizable gauss diagrams , and we call it the number of bridges in a gauss diagram .",
    "the _ virtual bridge number _ @xmath17 of a virtual knot @xmath2 is the minimum number of bridges over all the gauss diagrams realizing @xmath16 if @xmath18 then @xmath2 is the unknot .",
    "note that if @xmath2 is isotopic to an ordinary knot then @xmath19 it is plausible that for many @xmath2 we should actually have @xmath20 but we have not studied this question yet .",
    "an _ isotopy _ between two gauss diagrams is a sequence of the gauss diagram versions of reidemeister moves .",
    "a ( generic ) _ homotopy _ between two gauss diagrams is a sequence of isotopies and `` flip moves '' that change simultaneously the direction and the sign of an arrow . if a gauss diagram corresponds to a knot diagram ,",
    "then the last move reflects the passage of a knot through a singular double point at a crossing identified with the arrow .",
    "note that any two knots in @xmath21 are homotopic as loops .",
    "however there are many different homotopy classes of virtual knots .",
    "in particular not every virtual knot is homotopic to the unknot .    for an ordinary knot @xmath2 , its _ unknotting number _",
    "@xmath4 is the minimal number of passages through a double point of two branches of the knot in a generic homotopy of @xmath2 to the unknot .    for virtual knots ,",
    "the unknot is the trivial gauss diagram with no chords .",
    "if @xmath2 is a virtual knot homotopic to the unknot , then we put the _ virtual unknotting number _",
    "@xmath1 to be the minimal number of flip moves in a virtual homotopy that changes @xmath2 to the unknot .",
    "note that if @xmath2 is nontrivial , then @xmath22    clearly if @xmath2 is an ordinary knot , then @xmath23 for many knots we have @xmath24 for example this is always true if @xmath25    let @xmath26 be two different virtual knots that are homotopic to each other .",
    "we put the _ relative unknotting number _",
    "@xmath27 to be the minimal number of flip moves in a generic homotopy of @xmath28 to @xmath29 clearly if @xmath26 are homotopic to the unknot , then we have @xmath30 moreover if @xmath31 is the unknot , then @xmath32    it is well - known that there are no ordinary knots @xmath2 with @xmath6 however , as we show , the theory of virtual knots with @xmath9 is surprisingly nontrivial .",
    "[ main1 ] for every @xmath8 there exists a virtual knot @xmath33 homotopic to the unknot that has @xmath34 and @xmath35    the following theorem can be thought of a generalization of the above result to the case of virtual knots that are not homotopic to the unknot .",
    "[ main2 ] there are infinitely many virtual knot homotopy classes @xmath36 enumerated by pairs of distinct positive integers @xmath37 such that @xmath36 contains infinitely many distinct virtual knots @xmath38 with @xmath39 and @xmath40 for all @xmath41    note that for a virtual knot homotopy class not containing the unknot , there is no obvious choice of the most trivial knot in the class . in the examples constructed in the proof of theorem  [ main2 ] the knots",
    "@xmath42 are simpler than all @xmath43 so one can think of them as the chosen most trivial knots in the corresponding virtual homotopy classes .",
    "in the proofs of theorems  [ main1 ] and  [ main2 ] we use properties of invariants studied by v.  turaev  @xcite and a.  henrich  @xcite .",
    "[ pinvariant ] let @xmath14 be a gauss diagram realizing a virtual knot @xmath16 the end points of a chord @xmath44 in @xmath14 separate the circle in @xmath14 into two arcs .",
    "choose one of the arcs and perform the flip moves on all the other chords so that they point into the chosen arc .",
    "let @xmath45 to be the sum of the signs @xmath46 of the chords pointing into the chosen arc after the flip moves .",
    "we put @xmath47 to be the sign of @xmath48    put @xmath49 to be the polynomial in variable @xmath50 with integer coefficients .",
    "one can show that @xmath51 does not depend on the choice of the diagram @xmath14 realizing @xmath2 .",
    "hence we have a polynomial invariant @xmath52 of a virtual knot @xmath16 it is easy to see that @xmath53 is a vassiliev - goussarov invariant  @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite of order one of virtual knots in the sense of kauffman  @xcite .",
    "[ premark ] it is easy to see that a flip move on a chord @xmath44 with @xmath54 changes one of the coefficients of the polynomial @xmath53 invariant by @xmath55 .",
    "the flip move on a chord @xmath44 with @xmath56 does not change the @xmath53 invariant .",
    "thus , as it was observed by a.  henrich  @xcite , if @xmath26 are homotopic virtual knots and @xmath57 , then every ( generic ) homotopy between @xmath28 and @xmath31 involves at least @xmath58 flip moves .",
    "thus @xmath59    let @xmath2 be a virtual knot homotopic to the trivial knot @xmath60 let @xmath61 .",
    "since @xmath62 the above relation of the @xmath53 invariant with the relative unknotting number @xmath63 implies that the vitual unknotting number @xmath64    let @xmath14 be a gauss diagram realizing a virtual knot @xmath16 let @xmath65 be the gauss diagram obtained from @xmath14 by performing the flip moves that convert the signs of all the chords to be @xmath66 the end points of an oriented chord @xmath44 separate the core circle of @xmath65 into two oriented arcs .",
    "the oriented arc that starts at the arrow head of @xmath44 would be called the preferred arc and denoted by @xmath67 .",
    "the other arc is @xmath68 put @xmath69 to be the number of oriented chords different from @xmath44 that start in @xmath70 and end in @xmath71 put @xmath72 to be the number of oriented chords different from @xmath44 that start in @xmath67 and end in @xmath68 put @xmath73 and put @xmath74 to be the sign of @xmath75    put @xmath76 to be a polynomial in @xmath50 with integer coefficients .",
    "this @xmath77 in a slightly different form was introduced by v.  turaev  @xcite . from his work one",
    "immediately gets that @xmath77 depends only on the virtual homotopy class of the virtual knot @xmath16 in particular , if for two virtual knots @xmath26 we have @xmath78 , then @xmath28 and @xmath31 are not virtually homotopic .",
    "consider the virtual knots @xmath79 depicted in figure  [ bridgefigureone.fig ] .",
    "all these knots are virtually homotopic . indeed to get from @xmath80 to @xmath33 perform a flip move on the chord in @xmath80 with the rightmost arrow head .",
    "then use the gauss diagram version of the second reidemeister move , see figure  [ gaussredemeister.fig ] , to cancel the resulting chord and the chord with the left most arrow head in @xmath80 . since @xmath81 is the trivial knot",
    ", we see that @xmath82 for all @xmath83          for @xmath90 with @xmath91 we put @xmath92 to be the virtual knot shown in figure  [ bridgefiguretwo.fig ] whose gauss diagram consists of @xmath93 parallel positive vertical chords oriented upwards and @xmath94 parallel positive horizontal chords oriented to the right .",
    "a straightforward computation shows that @xmath95 since @xmath96 is invariant under virtual homotopy we see that if @xmath97 are such @xmath98 , @xmath99 and @xmath100 , then @xmath101 and @xmath102 are not virtually homotopic .",
    "if we draw the horizontal and vertical arrows of @xmath92 to be close to the @xmath103- and @xmath104-axis , then we have four large arcs of the circle in @xmath105 that are free of chord ends",
    ". we will refer to these arcs as the arcs located in the corresponding four quadrants . for @xmath106 put @xmath107 to be the virtual knot whose gauss diagram is obtained from the diagram of @xmath92 by adding @xmath108 positive chords that pass through the circle center .",
    "the first @xmath109 of the added chords should start in the fourth quadrant arc , end in the second quadrant arc and have almost vertical slope .",
    "the other @xmath109 chords should start in the second quadrant arc , end in the fourth quadrant arc and have almost horizontal slope , see figure  [ bridgefigurethree.fig ] .",
    "we claim that for fixed @xmath110 all the knots @xmath107 are virtually homotopic . for @xmath111 the homotopy between @xmath112 and @xmath113",
    "is constructed as follows .",
    "take the chord from the group of @xmath109 chords going from the second to the fourth quadrant arc whose slope is the farthest from the horizontal one and perform the flip move on it .",
    "use the gauss diagram version of the second reidemiester move to cancel the resulting chord and the chord in the group of @xmath109 chords going from the fourth into the second quadrant arc whose slop is the farthest from the vertical , see figure  [ bridgefigurefour.fig ] .",
