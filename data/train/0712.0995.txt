    "relativistic models are a very useful tool in the description of a wide variety of applications in nuclear matter , finite nuclei and nuclear astrophysics . they can be tested and , hopefully constrained , according to experimental and astrophysical observation results .",
    "unfortunately , most theoretical results are model dependent and so far it is unclear whether some of them should be discarded .",
    "many variations of the well known quantum hadrodynamic model @xcite have been developed and used along the last decades .",
    "some of them rely on density dependent couplings between the baryons and the mesons @xcite while others use constant couplings @xcite .",
    "still another possibility of including density dependence on the lagrangian density is through the coupling of the mediator mesons among themselves @xcite .",
    "the strong model dependence of the results come from the simple fact that relativistic model couplings are adjusted in order to fit expected nuclei properties such as binding energy , saturation density , compressibility and energy symmetry at saturation density only . once the same relativistic models are extrapolated to higher densities as in stellar matter or higher temperatures as in heavy - ion collisions or even to lower densities as in the nuclear matter liquid gas phase transitions , they can and indeed provide different information .",
    "hence , experimental constraints obtained either from polarized electron scattered from a heavy target , from heavy - ion collisions at different energies or from astronomical observations are very important in order that adequate models are chosen and inadequate ones are ruled out .    in the present work we focus our attention to the calculation of the difference between the neutron and the proton radii known as the neutron skin thickness .",
    "based on the argument that experimental results should be used to constrain relativistic models , it is very important that an accurate experimental measurement of the neutron skin thickness is achieved .",
    "this depends on a precise measurement of both the charge and the neutron radius .",
    "the charge radius is already known within a precision of one percent for most stable nuclei , using the well - known single - arm and non - polarized elastic electron scattering technique as well as the spectroscopy of muonic atoms @xcite . for the neutron radius ,",
    "our present knowledge has an uncertainty of about 0.2 fm @xcite .",
    "however , using polarized electron beams it is possible to obtain the neutron distribution , as first discussed in @xcite and , as a consequence , to obtain the desired neutron radius . in fact , the parity radius experiment ( prex ) at the jefferson laboratory @xcite is currently running to measure the @xmath0pb neutron radius with an accuracy of less than 0.05 fm , using polarized electron scattering . in the prex experiment , the asymmetry is expected to be measured at a momentum transfer @xmath5 .    at this point it is worth mentioning that two other experimental methods have been used in order to measure neutron skins and neutron halos @xcite , namely , the nuclear spectroscopy analysis of the antiproton annihilation residues one mass unit lighter than the target mass and the measurements of strong - interaction effects on anti - protonic x rays . whenever possible , the results obtained with the above mentioned methods are also used for comparison in the results section .    in a recent work @xcite , the neutron skin thickness and the asymmetry for polarized electron scattering off a hadronic target",
    "were investigated with the help of both density dependent and with constant coupling relativistic models . for these calculations",
    "two important compromises were made : for the calculation of the proton and neutron densities , a thomas - fermi approach was used and for the calculation of the asymmetry a plane wave born approximation for the electron @xcite was enforced .",
    "the @xmath6 neutron skin thickness was then obtained with two different density dependent hadronic ( ddh ) model parametrizations , the tw @xcite , where the density dependence is introduced explicitly through the couplings and the nl@xmath7 model @xcite , where the density dependence appears through the coupling of the vector and the isovector mesons .",
    "one of the most used parametrizations of the non - linear walecka model ( nlwm ) , the nl3 was also used .",
    "the asymmetry , in the momentum transfer range of interest for the calculation of neutron skins , was shown to give very similar results for all models .",
    "on the other hand , the neutron skin thickness is smaller with the ddh model than with the nl3 .",
    "as the coupling strength between the @xmath8 and @xmath9 mesons increases in the nl@xmath7 model , the neutron skin thickness moves from the original nl3 towards the ddh results . as the momentum transfer increases , the asymmetry becomes strongly model dependent .    in the present work",
    "we revisit the same quantities , but with improvements in both approximations mentioned above in order to check if the model differences remain . as",
    "the target is a heavy nucleus ( @xmath0pb ) , the results for the asymmetry are reconsidered with the use of the partial wave expansion method as briefly discussed in the appendix . on the other hand ,",
    "the proton and neutron densities are calculated from the solution of the dirac equation .",
    "we also extend our calculations to obtain the neutron skin thickness of @xmath10 , @xmath11,@xmath12 and @xmath4zr . for the asymmetry",
    ", we also include applications for @xmath11 .",
    "as the nl@xmath7 model was shown to give results that interpolate between the nl3 parametrization of the nlwm and the tw parametrization of the ddh model , we next restrict ourselves to the nl3 and the ddh models , i.e. , one with constant couplings and another one with density dependent couplings .",
    "we also comment on the differences between the results obtained in the present work and within the thomas - fermi approximation .",
    "it is worth mentioning that most applications to neutron stars , to equations of state used to describe supernova simulations and the description of nucleation processes have been done within the thomas - fermi approximation .",
    "understanding its limitations and accuracy is indeed very important .",
    "information about the skin thickness as obtained in finite nuclei can be directly related to astrophysical calculations and so the possible connections between thomas - fermi and dirac density profiles can be useful .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii we show the lagrangian density of the ddh model and describe the formalism used ; in section iii we present and discuss the results ; in section iv we draw our final conclusions .",
    "we describe the main quantities of the ddh model , which has density dependent coupling parameters in the following .",
    "the lagrangian density reads : @xmath13 @xmath14\\psi\\ ] ] @xmath15 @xmath16 where @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the scalar - isoscalar , vector - isoscalar and vector - isovector meson fields and the photon field respectively , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 for protons and neutrons respectively .",
    "the parameters of the model are : the nucleon mass @xmath25 mev , the masses of the mesons @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , the electromagnetic coupling constant @xmath29 and the density dependent couplings @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 , which are adjusted in order to reproduce some of the nuclear matter bulk properties , using the following parametrization : @xmath33 with @xmath34 and @xmath35 ,   \\label{paratw2}\\ ] ] with the values of the parameters @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 , @xmath42 given in @xcite .",
    "this model does not include self - interaction terms for the meson fields as in nl3 .",
    "we consider two parametrizations of the above mentioned ddh model , the original one that we next refer to as tw and a more recent one known as ddme1 @xcite , obtained from a fitting that includes known experimental values of the @xmath6 neutron skin .",
    "once the lagrangian density is chosen , the euler - lagrange equations are used to calculate the equations of motion .",
    "the meson field equations of motion are easily found in the literature and we refrain from writing them . an interested reader can obtain the equations in @xcite , among other papers in the literature .",
    "the dirac equation for the nucleon field reads : @xmath43 \\psi = 0 ~~,\\ ] ] where the scalar and vector self - energies are given respectively by    @xmath44    with @xmath45 @xmath46 the term @xmath47 is known as the rearrangement term . as",
    "done in @xcite , we consider that the nucleus is approximately given by a slater determinant and only the lowest lying positive energy states are occupied .",
    "the usual ansatz for the nucleon spinor is @xmath48 and the one - particle states are obtained from the solution of the dirac equation .",
    "only spherically symmetric nuclei are considered and the usual notation for the expected values of the meson fields are used .",
    "the self - energies become : @xmath49 @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 and @xmath9 are the usual scalar and baryonic densities . next the ansatz given in eq.([ansa ] ) and the spin - isospin wavefunctions @xmath53 are substituted into the dirac equation . @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the spinorial spherical harmonics and the isospin wavefunctions respectively . after some straightforward algebraic manipulations , a new system of coupled equations",
    "is obtained : @xmath56 @xmath57 where @xmath58 and @xmath59 at this point , @xmath60 and @xmath61 are expanded in the harmonic oscillator basis of dimensions @xmath62 and @xmath63 respectively , as in @xcite .",
    "the linear variational method is then used to solve the above equations and we are left with an eigenvalue problem solved by the diagonalization of a matrix of order @xmath64 .",
    "the fields @xmath17 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 are also expanded in a harmonic oscillator basis and solved iteratively through their corresponding klein - gordon equations .",
    "the coulomb field @xmath67 is obtained by the green s function method .",
    "the proton and neutron mean - square radius are defined as    @xmath68    and the neutron skin thickness reads @xmath69    it is also useful to define the nuclear charge distribution as : @xmath70^{3/2}}\\int~d^{3}r'exp[-\\frac{(\\overrightarrow{r}- \\overrightarrow{r}')^2}{(a_p^{2}-b^{2})}]\\rho_p(\\overrightarrow{r } ' ) ,   \\label{rhoc}\\ ] ]    where @xmath71 , @xmath72 fm and @xmath73 is the oscillator length used to define our basis set .",
    "the above definition includes the proton finite size , for which we have assumed a gaussian shape to describe its intrinsic charge distribution :    @xmath74    and an approximate center - of - mass correction according to the prescription given in @xcite .",
    "neutron finite size corrections are disregarded , i.e. , its intrinsic form factor is taken as unit .    for the calculation of the differential elastic electron cross - section ( @xmath75 ) and the asymmetry ( @xmath76 ) ,",
    "details are given in the appendix .",
    "we first plot the * @xmath6 * neutron and proton densities obtained for the ddh model within the thomas - fermi approximation from @xcite and the solution of the dirac equation in fig .",
    "[ densities ] . as it is well known , the thomas - fermi approximation flattens the central energy densities while the dirac equation keeps the internal nuclear structure .",
    "the difference in the central density is then compensated near the surface , with consequences in the calculations of the mean square radii and neutron skin thickness .",
    "one can see that the ddme1 parametrization gives almost the same density profiles as compared with the original tw parametrization .",
    "in table i we show the results of the present calculations for @xmath0pb obtained with the nl3 and both parametrizations of the ddh model . for the sake of completeness",
    "we also include the results obtained in @xcite within the thomas - fermi approach .",
    "one can observe that the thomas - fermi results for the radii are systematically larger than the dirac solutions , but the neutron skins are smaller .",
    "the surface energies also give smaller contributions within the tf approach .",
    "both parametrizations of the ddh model show the same neutron skins albeit the small differences in the proton and neutron radii .",
    "the binding energy and the surface energy are also slightly different .",
    "finally , the charge radius ( @xmath77 ) , calculated with the charge distribution given by equation ( [ rhoc ] ) is presented and compared with the experimental value .",
    "all results are very similar .    in table",
    "ii we show the results for @xmath1ca , @xmath2ca,@xmath12 and @xmath4zr .",
    "most of the conclusions drawn from table [ tab1 ] remain valid , i.e. , the neutron skin thickness are the same for both parametrizations of the ddh model , tw gives larger surface energies than ddme1 and nl3 and the proton , neutron and charge radii vary from one model to the other .    according to @xcite ,",
    "experimental data show a linear relation between the neutron skin thickness and the proton - neutron asymmetry of the considered nuclei , i.e. , @xmath78 . assuming that this dependence really exists , the authors of @xcite fit it as @xmath79 in fig .",
    "[ correlation ] we have plotted the fitted dependence lines considering the most extreme values for @xmath80 . if this dependence has really to be satisfied , the theoretical points should lie within both curves .",
    "the tw and ddme1 points coincide and they are shown to be inside the appropriate range while the nl3 results for very asymmetric nuclei are outside the upper boundary .",
    "now let s focus on the electron scattering cross sections and the asymmetry . in fig .",
    "[ cross ] the elastic cross section for nl3 and ddh models are compared with the experimental data for @xmath0pb and @xmath11 .",
    "finite size proton as well as center - of - mass effects were also included in the cross - section calculation . in both cases",
    "the theoretical and experimental results are in very good agreement and both models show very small quantitative differences along all the momentum transfer region covered by the data . while tw and ddme1 seem to give a slightly better desciption for @xmath0pb , nl3 results are closer to the cross section for @xmath11 at momentum transfers between 3.0 and 3.5 @xmath81 . for the sake of completeness",
    "we have added the results obtained with the thomas - fermi approximation for the tw parametrization of the ddh model for @xmath0pb .",
    "one can see that the results for the cross section start to deviate from the experimental points around 1.5 @xmath81 with larger discrepancies at larger momentum transfers ."
