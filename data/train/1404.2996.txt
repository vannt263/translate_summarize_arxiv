    "two strong direct evidences indicate the existence of new physics : one is the observations of neutrino oscillations , which lead to massive neutrinos  @xcite , and another one is the astronomical evidence of dark matter ( dm ) , where a weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp ) is the candidate in particle physics .",
    "the planck best - fit for the dm density , which combines the data of wmap polarization at low multipoles , high-@xmath2 experiments and baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) , etc .",
    ", now is given by @xcite h^2=0.11870.0017 .",
    "[ eq : omega ] until now , we have not concluded what the dm is and what the masses of neutrinos originate .",
    "it is interesting if we can accommodate both dm issue and neutrino masses in the same framework .",
    "although the probe of dm could be through the direct detection experiments , however according to the recent measurements by lux collaboration  @xcite and xenon100  @xcite , we are still short of clear signals and the cross section for elastic scattering of nuclei and dm has been strictly limited .",
    "in contrast , the potential dm signals have been observed by the indirect detections .",
    "for instance , the recent results measured by ams-02  @xcite have confirmed the excess of positron fraction which was observed earlier by pamela  @xcite and fermi - lat  @xcite experiments .",
    "additionally , the excess of positron+electron flux above the calculated backgrounds is also observed by pamela  @xcite , fermi - lat  @xcite , atic  @xcite and hess  @xcite .",
    "inspired by the observed anomalies , various interesting possible mechanisms to generate the high energy positrons and electrons are proposed , such as pulsars @xcite , dark matter annihilations @xcite and dark matter decays @xcite .",
    "the origin of neutrino masses is one of most mysterious problems in high energy physics .",
    "before nonzero neutrino masses were found , numerous mechanisms had been proposed to understand the source of neutrino masses , such as type - i seesaw @xcite and type - ii seesaw @xcite mechanisms , where the former introduced the heavy right - handed neutrinos and the latter extended the standard model ( sm ) by including a @xmath3 higgs triplet .",
    "since the triplet scalars only couple to leptons , based on this character , it may have interesting impacts on the cosmic - ray positrons , electrons and neutrinos .",
    "we therefore study a simple extension of conventional type - ii seesaw model by including the possible dm effects .    for studying the excess of cosmic rays by dm annihilation and the masses of neutrinos , we add an extra higgs doublet @xmath4 and a higgs triplet ( @xmath5 ) to the sm .",
    "besides the gauge symmetry @xmath6 , in order to get a stable dm , we impose a discrete @xmath0 symmetry in our model , where the @xmath7 is @xmath0-odd and the @xmath5 and sm particles are @xmath0-even .",
    "the @xmath0 odd doublet is similar to the one in inert higgs doublet ( ihd ) model  @xcite , where the ihd model has been studied widely in the literature , such as dm direct detection @xcite , cosmic - ray gamma spectrum  @xcite , cosmic - ray positrons and antiproton fluxes  @xcite , collider signatures  @xcite , etc",
    ". the lightest neutral odd particle could be either cp - odd or cp - even , in this work we will adopt the cp - even boson as the dm candidate . for explaining the observed excess of cosmic rays , we set the odd particle masses at tev scale . there are two motivations to introduce the higgs triplet . first , like the type - ii seesaw mechanism @xcite , the small neutrino masses could be explained by the small vev of triplet without introducing heavy right - handed neutrinos .",
    "second , the excess of cosmic - ray appears in positrons and electrons , however , by the measurements of ams  @xcite , pamela  @xcite and hess  @xcite , no excess is found in cosmic - ray antiproton spectrum .",
    "since triplet higgs bosons interact with leptons but do not couple to quarks , it is interesting to explore if the observed excess of positron fraction and positron+electron flux could be explained by the leptonic decays of higgs triplet in dm annihilation processes .",
    "the model with one odd singlet and one @xmath8 triplet has been studied and one can refer to ref .  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the search of doubly charged higgs now is an important topic at colliders .",
    "if doubly charged higgs is 100% leptonic decays , the experimental lower bound on its mass has been limited in the range between 375 and 409 gev  @xcite . the detailed analysis and",
    "the implications at collider physics could consult the refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the decays of triplet particles to leptons depend on the yukawa couplings .",
    "as known , the yukawa couplings could be constrained by the measured neutrino mass - squared differences and the mixing angles of pontecorvo - maki - nakagawa - sakata ( pmns ) matrix @xcite , where the current data are given by @xcite m^2_21&=&(7.500.20)10 ^ -5 ev^2 , +    ^2(2_12 ) & = & 0.857 0.024 , ^2(2_23 ) > 0.95 , + ^2(2_13)&=&0.095 0.01 .",
    "since the data can not tell the mass pattern from various neutrino mass spectra , in our study , we classify the mass spectra to be normal ordering ( no ) , inverted ordering ( io ) and quasi - degeneracy ( qd ) @xcite and investigate their influence on the production of cosmic rays .",
    "because we do not have any information on the dirac @xmath9 and majorana @xmath10 phases in pmns matrix , we adopt four benchmark points that are used by cms collaboration for the search of doubly charged higgs @xcite .",
    "the first three benchmark points stand for the no , io and qd with @xmath11 while the fourth one denotes the qd with @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "we note that the necessary boost factor ( bf ) for fitting the measured cosmic - ray electron / positron flux by dm annihilation is regarded as astrophysical effects @xcite .",
    "we take the bf as a parameter and use the data of antiproton spectrum to bound it .",
    "furthermore , since the singly charged and neutral triplet particles couple to neutrinos , an excess of cosmic - ray neutrinos is expected in the model .",
    "we find that a breit - wigner enhancement could occur at the production of neutrinos ; therefore , without bf , a large neutrino flux from dm annihilation could be accomplished .",
    "accordingly , with the same values of free parameters that fit the excess of cosmic - ray positron / electron flux , our results on neutrino excess from galactic halo could be close to the upper bound measured by icecube  @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we introduce the gauge interactions of ihd and triplet , yukawa couplings of triplet , and scalar potential in sec ii .",
    "the set of free parameters and the branching fractions of triplet particle decays are introduced in sec iii . in sec iv , we discuss the constraints from relic density of dm and cosmic - ray antiproton spectrum . with the values of constrained parameters ,",

    "for explaining the measured positron excess by the dm annihilation , we have studied the extension of the sm by adding an odd ihd @xmath7 and an even higgs triplet @xmath5 .",
    "the lop of @xmath7 can be a wimp dm candidate . due to the unbroken @xmath0-parity ,",
    "the dm candidate is stable .",
    "we take the cp - even component @xmath145 as the dm candidate .",
    "the neutrinos become massive through the type - ii seesaw mechanism . in order to suppress the effects from ihd model and emerge the triplet contributions , we have set @xmath146 , @xmath147 gev and @xmath148 . even though , the antiproton spectrum is dominated by triple interactions",
    "@xmath149 and @xmath53 and quadratic interactions @xmath150 which appear in ihd model . with the measurement of antiproton spectrum ,",
    "we study the correlation between the upper bound of bf and @xmath139 .    in terms of the feynman diagrams ,",
    "three scenarios are involved in our analysis . in scenario - i",
    ", we further use three schemes to describe the parameters @xmath151 and @xmath152 . in our model , the excess of positrons / electrons is mainly arisen from the triplet decays .",
    "since the neutrino mass spectrum is still uncertain , we also study the influence of neutrino mass in the cases of no , io and qd . from figs .",
    "[ fig : positronbp1]-[fig : positronbp4 ] , we see that scenario - i@xmath110 and -i@xmath116 have similar contributions .",
    "moreover , the normal ordered mass spectrum could fit well to the excess of positrons / electron measured by pamela , fermi - lat and ams-02 .",
    "although we have not observed the excess of comic - ray neutrinos , however if the source of excess of positrons / electrons is from triplet decays , the same effects will also increase the abundance of cosmic - ray neutrinos .",
    "we find that the quasi - resonance effects at @xmath153 could occur in scenario - iii so that large neutrino flux can be obtained without bf .",
    "we calculate @xmath154 for cosmic - ray neutrinos and realize that our results in some parameter region are close to the recent icecube data for neutrino flux from galactic halo .",
    "hence , our model could be tested if more data for cosmic - ray neutrinos are observed .",

    "<S> weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp ) as a dark matter ( dm ) candidate is further inspired by recent ams-02 data , which confirm the excess of positron fraction observed earlier by pamela and fermi - lat experiments . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , the excess of positron+electron flux is still significant in the measurement of fermi - lat . for solving the problems of massive neutrinos and observed excess of cosmic - ray , we study the model with an inert higgs doublet ( ihd ) in the framework of type - ii seesaw model by imposing a @xmath0 symmetry on the ihd , where the lightest particle of ihd is the dm candidate and </S>",
    "<S> the neutrino masses originate from the yukawa couplings of higgs triplet and leptons . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the cosmic - ray production in our model by using three kinds of neutrino mass spectra , which are classified by normal ordering , inverted ordering and quasi - degeneracy . </S>",
    "<S> we find that when the constraints of dm relic density and comic - ray antiproton spectrum are taken into account , the observed excess of positron / electron flux could be explained well in normal ordered neutrino mass spectrum . </S>",
