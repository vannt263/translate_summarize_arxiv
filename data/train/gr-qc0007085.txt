    "the chances of detecting these events and then unraveling the information contained in the gravitational wave signals will be greatly increased if we have accurate numerical simulations of black - hole binary coalescence . while post - newtonian techniques can be used to simulate the inspiral of a compact binary system , the final plunge and coalescence must be simulated numerically .",

    "four - dimensional indices will be denoted by greek letters , while 3-dimensional indices will be denoted by latin letters .    to avoid confusion , the covariant derivative and ricci tensor associated with @xmath6",

    "einstein s equations , @xmath12 , represent ten independent equations .",
    "since there are ten equations and ten independent components of the four - metric @xmath1 , it seems that we have the same number of equations as unknowns . from the definition of the einstein tensor ( [ eq : einstein ] )",
    ", we see that these ten equations are linear in the second derivatives and quadratic in the first derivatives of the metric .",
    "we might expect that these ten second - order equations represent evolution equations for the ten components of the metric .",
    "however , a close inspection of the equations reveals that only six of the ten involve second time - derivatives of the metric .",
    "the remaining four equations are not evolution equations .",
    "instead , they are constraint equations .",
    "the full system of equations is still well posed , however , because of the bianchi identities @xmath13 the four constraint equations appear as a result of the general covariance of einstein s theory , which gives us the freedom to apply general coordinate transformations to each of the four coordinates and leave the interval , @xmath14 unchanged .",
    "if we consider einstein s equations as a cauchy problem , we find that the ten equations separate into a set of four constraint or initial - value equations , and six evolution or dynamical equations . if the four initial - value equations are satisfied on some spacelike hypersurface , which we can label with @xmath15 , then the bianchi identities ( [ eq : bianchi ] ) guarantee that the evolution equations preserve the constraints on neighboring spacelike hypersurfaces .      in the cauchy formulation of einstein s equations ,",
    "we begin by foliating the 4-dimensional manifold as a set of spacelike , 3-dimensional hypersurfaces ( or slices ) @xmath16 .",
    "these slices are labeled by a parameter @xmath17 or , more simply , each slice of the 4-dimensional manifold is a @xmath18 hypersurface . following the standard @xmath0 decomposition  @xcite , we let @xmath19 be the future - pointing timelike unit normal to the slice , with @xmath20 here , @xmath21 is called the _ lapse function _ ( frequently denoted @xmath22 in the literature ) .",
    "the scalar lapse function sets the proper interval measured by observers as they move between slices on a path that is normal to the hypersurface ( so - called normal observers ) : @xmath23 of course , there is no reason that observers must move along a path normal to the hypersurface . in general",
    ", we can define the time vector as @xmath24 where @xmath25 here , @xmath26 is called the _ shift vector _ ( frequently denoted @xmath27 in the literature ) .",
    "because of ( [ eq : shift - const ] ) , @xmath26 has only three independent components and is a _ spatial _ vector , tangent to the hypersurface on which it resides . at this point , it is convenient to introduce a coordinate system adapted to the foliation @xmath16 .",
    "let @xmath28 be the spatial coordinates in the slice .",
    "the fourth coordinate , @xmath17 , is the parameter labeling each slice . with this adapted coordinate system , we find that 3-dimensional coordinate values remain constant as we move between slices along the @xmath29 direction ( [ eq : time ] ) .",
    "the four parameters , @xmath21 and @xmath30 , are a manifestation of the 4-dimensional coordinate invariance , or gauge freedom , in einstein s theory .",
    "if we let @xmath6 represent the metric of the spacelike hypersurfaces , then we can rewrite the interval ( [ eq : interval ] ) as @xmath31    in the cauchy formulation of einstein s equations , @xmath6 is regarded as the fundamental variable and values for its components must be given as part of a well - posed initial - value problem . since einstein s equations are second order , we must also specify something like a time derivative of the metric .",
    "for this , we use the second fundamental form , or extrinsic curvature , of the slice , @xmath32 , defined by @xmath33 where @xmath34 denotes the lie derivative along the @xmath19 direction .    together , @xmath6 and @xmath32 are the minimal set of initial data that must be specified for a cauchy evolution of einstein s equations .",
    "the metric @xmath6 on a hypersurface is induced on that surface by the 4-metric @xmath1 .",

    "( [ eq : k - evolution ] ) , ( [ eq : hamiltonian - const ] ) , and ( [ eq : momentum - const ] ) are defined with respect to a normal observer .",
    "this is in contrast to the usual definition of @xmath39 with respect to the rest frame of the fluid in hydrodynamics . ]",
    "we have also used the fact that in our adapted coordinate system , @xmath45 .",
    "the set of second - order evolution equations is completed by rewriting the definition of the extrinsic curvature ( [ eq : extr - curv ] ) as @xmath46    equations  ( [ eq : k - evolution ] ) and ( [ eq : g - evolution ] ) are a first - order representation of a complete set of evolution equations for given initial data @xmath6 and @xmath32 .",
    "however , the data can not be freely specified in their entirety .",
    "the four constraint equations , following the same procedure outlined above for the evolution equations , become @xmath47 and @xmath48 here , @xmath49 and @xmath50 is the matter momentum density .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : hamiltonian - const ] ) is referred to as the hamiltonian or scalar constraint , while ( [ eq : momentum - const ] ) are referred to as the momentum or vector constraints .",
    "valid initial data for the evolution equations ( [ eq : k - evolution ] ) and ( [ eq : g - evolution ] ) must satisfy this set of constraints . and , as mentioned earlier , the bianchi identities ( [ eq : bianchi ] ) guarantee that the evolution equations will preserve the constraints on future slices of the evolution .",
    "as we will see below , the hamiltonian constraint ( [ eq : hamiltonian - const ] ) most naturally constrains the 3-metric @xmath6 , while the momentum constraints ( [ eq : momentum - const ] ) naturally constrain the extrinsic curvature @xmath32 . taking the constraints into consideration",
    ", it seems that the 3-metric has five degrees of freedom remaining , while the extrinsic curvature has three .",
    "but we know that the gravitational field in einstein s theory has two dynamical degrees of freedom , so we expect that both @xmath6 and @xmath32 should each have only two free components .",
    "the answer to this problem is , once again , the coordinate invariance of einstein s theory .",
    "this seems strange at first , because we have already used the coordinate invariance of the theory to narrow our scope from the ten components of the 4-metric to the six components of the 3-metric .",
    "however , the lapse and shift do not completely specify the coordinate gauge .",
    "rather , they specify how an initial choice of gauge will evolve with the foliation .",
    "the metric on a given hypersurface retains full 3-dimensional coordinate invariance , reducing the number of freely specifiable components to two  @xcite .",
    "there also remains one degree of gauge freedom associated with the time coordinate which must be fixed .",
    "each hypersurface represents a @xmath51 slice of the spacetime , so how the initial hypersurface is embedded in the full 4-dimensional manifold represents our temporal gauge choice .",
    "there is no unique way to specify this choice , but it is often convenient to let the trace of the extrinsic curvature @xmath52 represent this temporal gauge choice  @xcite .",
    "thus , we find that we _ are _ allowed to choose freely five components of the 3-metric and three components of the extrinsic curvature .",
    "however , only _ two _ of the components for each field represent dynamical degrees of freedom , the remainder are gauge degrees of freedom .    the four constraint equations , ( [ eq : hamiltonian - const ] ) and ( [ eq : momentum - const ] ) , represent conditions which the 3-metric and extrinsic curvature must satisfy .",
    "but , they do not specify which components ( or combination of components ) are constrained and which are freely specifiable . in the weak field limit where einstein s equations can be linearized , there are clear ways to determine which components are dynamic , which are constrained , and which are gauge . however , in the full nonlinear theory , there is no unique decomposition . in this case",
    ", one must choose a method for decomposing the constraint equations .",
    "the goal is to transform the equations into standard elliptic forms which can be solved given appropriate boundary conditions  @xcite .",
    "each different decomposition yields a unique set of elliptic equations to be solved _ and _ a unique set of freely specifiable parameters which must be fixed somehow .",
    "seemingly similar sets of assumptions applied to different decompositions can lead to physically different initial conditions .      for general initial - data configurations ,",
    "the most widely used class of constraint decompositions are the york ",
    "lichnerowicz conformal decompositions . at their heart",
    "are a conformal decomposition of the metric and certain components of the extrinsic curvature , together with a transverse - traceless decomposition of the extrinsic curvature .",
    "first , the metric is decomposed into a conformal factor @xmath53 multiplying an auxiliary 3-metric  @xcite : @xmath54 the auxiliary 3-metric @xmath9 is often called the conformal or background 3-metric , and it carries five degrees of freedom .",
    "its natural definition is given by @xmath55 leaving @xmath56 , but we are free to choose any normalization for @xmath57 . using ( [ eq : conformal - metric ] ) , we can rewrite the hamiltonian constraint ( [ eq : hamiltonian - const ] ) as @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the scalar laplace operator , and @xmath60 and @xmath61 are the covariant derivative and ricci scalar associated with @xmath9 . equation  ( [ eq : conf - hamiltonian - const - v1 ] ) is a quasilinear elliptic equation for the conformal factor @xmath53 , and we see that the hamiltonian constraint naturally constrains the 3-metric .",
    "the conformal decomposition of the hamiltonian constraint was proposed by lichnerowicz .",
    "but , the key to the full decomposition is the treatment of the extrinsic curvature introduced by york  @xcite .",
    "this begins by splitting the extrinsic curvature into its trace and tracefree parts , @xmath62 the decomposition proceeds by using the fact that we can covariantly split any symmetric tracefree tensor as follows : @xmath63 here , @xmath64 is a symmetric , transverse - traceless tensor ( i.e. , @xmath65 and @xmath66 ) and @xmath67 after separating out the transverse - traceless portion of @xmath68 , what remains , @xmath69 , is referred to as its `` longitudinal '' part .",
    "we now want to apply this transverse - traceless decomposition to the tracefree part of the extrinsic curvature @xmath70 . however , the conformal decomposition of the metric leaves us with at least two ways to proceed .    the goal of the decomposition is to produce a coupled set of elliptic equations to be solved with some prescribed boundary conditions .",
    "we have already reduced the hamiltonian constraint to an elliptic equation being solved on a _ background _ space in terms of differential operators that are compatible with the conformal 3-metric . in the end , we want to reduce the momentum constraints to a set of elliptic equations based on differential operators that are compatible with the same conformal 3-metric .",
    "but , the longitudinal operator ( [ eq : tt - op - def ] ) can be defined with respect to _ any _ metric space . in particular",
    ", it is natural to consider decompositions with respect to both the physical and conformal 3-metrics .",
    "let us first consider decomposing @xmath71 with respect to the conformal 3-metric  @xcite .",
    "as we will see , when certain assumptions are made , this decomposition has the advantage of producing a simpler set of elliptic equations that must be solved .",
    "the first step is to define the conformal tracefree extrinsic curvature @xmath72 by @xmath73 next , the transverse - traceless decomposition is applied to the conformal extrinsic curvature , @xmath74 note that the longitudinal operator @xmath75 and the symmetric , transverse - tracefree tensor @xmath76 are both defined with respect to covariant derivatives compatible with @xmath9 .    applying equations  ( [ eq : conformal - metric ] ) , ( [ eq : trace - free - k ] ) , ( [ eq : tt - op - def ] ) , ( [ eq : conf - a ] ) , and ( [ eq : decomp - back - a ] ) to the momentum constraints ( [ eq : momentum - const ] ) , we find that they simplify to @xmath77 where @xmath78 and we have used the fact that @xmath79 for any symmetric tracefree tensor @xmath80 .    in deriving equation  ( [ eq : conf - mom - v1 ] ) ,",
