    "the continuing success of the standard model ( sm ) has turned into a challenge both for theorists and experimentalists alike . on the one hand , theorists believe that the sm picture of the higgs mechanism based on one elementary scalar doublet is unnatural , trivial and has come to be viewed as an effective description of a more complicated higgs sector , one involving perhaps additional scalars and/or fermions or even new gauge interactions . in addition , the idea that fermion masses arise as a result of the interactions with this elementary scalar , requires for instance that its dimensionless couplings to two otherwise identical fermions such as the up and the top quarks , differ by more than four orders of magnitude . understanding the mechanism for electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) and the origin of fermion masses calls for physics beyond the sm . at least in the case of ewsb , it is understood that this new physics must reside at an energy scale not far beyond @xmath3tev .",
    "the experimental challenge of finding new physics in direct searches may still take some time if the new states or their effects only set in at several hundred gev .",
    "a complement of these direct signals at the highest available energies is the measurement of the effects of the new particles in loops , either through precision measurements such as the ones performed at lep , or through the detection of processes only occurring at one loop in the sm . among these",
    "are the transitions induced by flavor changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) , such as @xmath4 or @xmath5 .",
    "these are forbidden at tree level in the sm due to the presence of the glashow - illiopoulos - maiani ( gim ) mechanism . as a consequence",
    ", these processes are highly suppressed in the sm .",
    "thus the one loop effect of a new heavy state may translate into a large effect in a branching ratio if this loop induces a fcnc transition . here",
    "i discuss the fcnc decays of @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 and their potential as tools in searching for new physics at high energy scales @xmath6 .",
    "one critical aspect in evaluating this potential is the extent to which a given process is determined by high energy scales , i.e. short distance physics , or it is contaminated by the more mundane effects of long distance dynamics such as the ones induced by propagating intermediate hadrons . since the latter are not calculable in perturbation theory , the decay modes affected by long distance physics are less understood .",
    "next , i will give examples of short and long distance contributions in the fcnc decays of @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 mesons .",
    "once established which modes are the most likely to be testing grounds of the sm , i will turn to the discussion of two typical examples of its extensions : supersymmetry and the effects of anomalous triple gauge boson couplings .",
    "let us start the discussion with the decay @xmath7 . in the sm this process receives one loop contributions from electroweak penguin and box diagrams involving up - type quarks .",
    "these are truly short distance diagrams and although some long distance physics enters in the hadronization from @xmath8 and from @xmath9 in the way of form - factors , the theoretical uncertainties this introduces are not by themselves large enough to obscure the interesting physics .",
    "however , the process @xmath10 followed by @xmath11 gives another contribution , reflecting the long distance dynamics of the @xmath12 vertex , and dominates the rate  @xcite .",
    "we conclude that this decay mode is not well suited for a test of the short distance physics entering the loops .",
    "we now turn to consider @xmath13 .",
    "the short distance contributions to this process involve direct cp violation .",
    "this is extremely interesting since the measurement of this decay rate could be in principle a direct determination of the cp violating parameter @xmath14 , the complex phase in the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix .",
    "furthermore , the one photon intermediate state can not contribute here since the long distance vertex to one photon is cp conserving .",
    "still , there is contamination from long distance physics .",
    "this comes from two sources .",
    "first , there is indirect cp violation given essentially by @xmath15 where the @xmath16 decay , being cp conserving , is dominated by the one photon intermediate state .",
    "in addition , there is a cp conserving contribution to the decay rate from @xmath17 which gives a non interfering term resulting in @xmath18 , although this could be larger  @xcite .",
    "the indirect cp violating piece will be well known once the @xmath16 decay mode is measured .",
    "progress to a better understanding of the cp conserving piece may be achieved in the near future .",
    "thus , there is reasonable hope that in this process we may be able to disentangle the short and long distance physics , at least to some extent . for the moment",
    ", it remains in the list of long distance `` polluted '' modes .",
    "finally , we turn to the decay modes with neutrinos replacing the charged leptons in the final state .",
    "the processes @xmath19 and @xmath20 are almost completely determined by short distance physics .",
    "the effective hamiltonian for the charged mode is @xmath21 where @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 is the result of the top quark loop contribution , and @xmath25 is the charm quark contribution and carries a dependence on the lepton flavor coming from the box diagram with charged leptons .",
    "the contribution from the charm loop , in addition to the charm quark mass dependence , introduces a sizeable scale dependence which is only reduced when including next - to - leading - order corrections . the remnant dependence on the scale @xmath26 entering in the charm running mass results in an uncertainty @xmath27 in the @xmath28 .",
    "the hadronic matrix element needed to compute the matrix element of the exclusive mode can be obtained by isospin rotation from @xmath29 and therefore does not introduce additional hadronic uncertainties . the sm prediction for the branching ratio",
    "is obtained for @xmath30gev , @xmath31gev , @xmath32 and @xmath33 , leading to  @xcite @xmath34 , where the uncertainty is mainly from the ckm parameters .",
    "the recent observation of one event in this channel by bnl e787 , translates into  @xcite @xmath35 .",
    "finally , the neutral mode @xmath20 is even cleaner than the charged one due to the fact that it is largely dominated by direct cp violation . as a result , only the top quark loop in eq .",
    "( [ heff ] ) contributes so the uncertainties associated with the charm scale are not present .",
    "furthermore , this mode constitutes a very unique and direct way to measure the cp violating phase of the ckm matrix .",
    "the amplitude depends on @xmath36 $ ] , which in the wolfenstein parametrization can be written in term of the cp violating term @xmath14 and @xmath37 , giving  @xcite @xmath38 with @xmath39/\\lambda$ ] .",
    "the branching ratio of the neutral mode is still too small in the sm when compared with current experimental limits .",
    "future experiments expect to be sensitive to a few @xmath40 branching fraction .",
    "there seems to be a compromise between experimental accessibility and the theoretical uncertainties in any of the modes discussed above : the most accessible modes tend to be affected by larger theoretical uncertainties .",
    "this tension is always present in rare fcnc decays . in the case of @xmath0",
    "decays , the neutrino modes are hard but still accessible experimentally .",
    "the charged kaon mode seems to be a good compromise , since is a short distance dominated process and the uncertainties seem to be surmountable .",
    "the additional interest of the neutral mode is the observation of direct cp violation and the direct measurement of ckm parameters .",
    "we now turn to a comparative discussion of fcnc in @xmath1 and @xmath2 decays .",
    "the essential aspects can be framed as external - up - quark vs. external - down - quark processes .",
    "we will make the comparison using the radiative processes @xmath41 vs. @xmath5 , for the sake of simplicity .",
    "most of the conclusions can be extended to other modes .",
    "the short distance contributions to the radiative fcnc process @xmath42 result in the decay width @xmath43 where the superscript `` @xmath44 '' denotes the absence of qcd corrections , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and the function @xmath47 is the result of integrating the loop contribution of the internal quark @xmath48 .",
    "this loop function is the same in the @xmath49 and @xmath50 cases .",
    "the main difference in eq .",
    "( [ radwid ] ) comes from the masses of the internal quarks and the ckm factors @xmath51 . in order to see how this affects the widths we turn to table  i , where we show separately the contribution of each quark flavor .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     table  ii :  leading order and qcd - corrected branching ratios for @xmath42 .",
    "the qcd corrected rates involve important qcd uncertainties .",
    "the important point is that the overwhelming dominance of the qcd corrections in @xmath41 not only tells us that the short distance physics is not sensitive to the one loop fcnc operators of interest , but also signals that there will be even larger long distance contributions to the rate .",
    "after all , the qcd corrections were computed perturbatively . in general",
    ", the dominance of the perturbative one loop amplitude by light quark contributions hints the existence of large long distance effects .",
    "although these can not be computed from first principles , it is possible to estimate them phenomenologically .",
    "for instance , the operator ( [ ffop ] ) with @xmath52 gives rise to the dominant short distance piece in @xmath41 , through a @xmath53 loop .",
    "but one could imagine the @xmath53 pair propagating a long distance , forming a `` @xmath54 '' , which turns into a photon via vector meson dominance .",
    "these and other similar long distance mechanisms  @xcite give rise , for instance , to @xmath55 , far above the level of the qcd - corrected short distance rates expected for @xmath41 processes .",
    "many other long - distance dominated radiative @xmath1 decays are at this level .",
    "similar effects are expected in the leptonic modes . there , however , the gap between short and long distance physics is less dramatic . the inclusive short and long distance branching fractions are  @xcite , respectively , @xmath56 then , although the long distance contributions still dominate in the sm , it is still conceivable that new physics contributions could overcome them .",
    "for instance , the sm prediction for the exclusive mode @xmath57 , is still well below the current experimental bound , @xmath58 .",
    "some extensions of the sm may give large enhancements in charm processes .",
    "although , these effects would be more noticeable in @xmath59 mixing , they could also result in @xmath60 rates well above @xmath61 .",
    "in general , however , one loop effects from new physics in @xmath1 decays are likely to be small compared to long distance effects .    on the other hand , the analogous @xmath50 decays are believed to be dominated by short distance physics .",
    "for instance , the next - to - leading order sm prediction for the short distance rate gives  @xcite @xmath62 .",
    "long distance contributions similar to those discussed in radiative charm decays , can proceed via the propagation of intermediate @xmath63 states , the off - shell `` @xmath64 '' .",
    "estimates of the pollution due to these states in the inclusive rate  @xcite can not be made reliably within controlled approximations .",
    "they tend to vary from one calculation to the next and can be as large as @xmath65 .",
    "the current experimental measurements give  @xcite @xmath66 thus , for the moment the potential long distance pollution is not problematic , but it should be taken into account in the future when precise enough measurements become available .",
    "similar considerations apply to the dilepton modes @xmath67 . in this case",
    "the long distance pollution comes in the form of `` spill over '' of the @xmath64 and @xmath68 resonant peaks into the continuum  @xcite .",
    "but in principle these modes are short distance dominated and together with @xmath5 constitute a stringent test of the sm .",
    "in addition to the dipole moment operator in ( [ o7 ] ) , these modes receive contributions from the operators @xmath69 these receive contributions from @xmath70 penguin and box diagrams . as a result , there are three quantities to be measured : @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 , the wilson coefficients evaluated at the relevant experimental scale .",
    "new physics effects enter as additions to the values of the coefficients at the high energy scale @xmath74 .",
    "the extraction of these quantities is a research program involving the inclusive rates @xmath75 , @xmath76 , as well as exclusive modes such as @xmath77 among others .",
    "a lot of theoretical effort has gone into understanding the inclusive decay rates  @xcite , and the theoretical predictions are under control . on the other hand ,",
    "the exclusive modes are , in principle , affected by large theoretical uncertainties due to our poor knowledge of the non - perturbative dynamics determining form - factors .",
    "some sound theoretical predictions can be made based on symmetries  @xcite . in some cases  @xcite , this is enough to extract the short distance physics . in any event , in the future",
    "all these form - factors will be obtained from first principle calculations on the lattice  @xcite , where a lot of progress has been made recently in computing weak matrix elements  @xcite .",
    "here we discuss two typical examples of extensions of the sm of very different kind : supersymmetry and anomalous triple gauge boson couplings ( tgc ) .",
    "supersymmetry is perhaps one of the most popular extensions of the sm .",
    "however , as many other extensions , it has a fcnc problem : in its most general form it does not come with an automatic gim mechanism , and therefore it may generate large fcnc effects  @xcite .",
    "most of the trouble comes from the fact that the diagonalization of fermion mass matrices does not , in general , diagonalize the squark mass matrices .",
    "thus flavor mixing in the sfermion sector `` misaligned '' with the fermions , are a potential disaster in general susy scenarios . even if the sfermion sector is assumed to be diagonal ( or aligned ) , there is an additional source of fcnc effects , coming from the charged higgs and chargino - squark contributions , arising from the standard ckm matrix .",
    "these effects , then are expected to be present at most at the sm level , since they depend only on the masses of the charged higgs , the charginos and the third generation squarks . in any case , some assumption about the sfermion mass matrices is necessary in order to accommodate the fcnc constraints .",
    "the two possibilities are : ( i ) sfermion mass matrices are diagonal at some high energy scale ( e.g. @xmath78 ) and small off diagonal elements are generated by the running down to the electroweak scale ; ( ii ) they are ( partially ) aligned with the sm fermion mass matrices .",
    "the vast parameter space of susy models includes these off diagonal elements , the superpartner and higgs sector masses and mixings , and allows to accommodate the lack of deviations in fcnc processes such as @xmath4 mixing , @xmath5 , etc .",
    "however , one can argue that in most cases the susy effects should be `` naturally '' of the order of @xmath79 or larger .",
    "such effects , for instance , in @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 mixing , or @xmath80 and @xmath81 transitions , are hard to see at the moment .",
    "but larger effects are also possible .",
    "for example , even satisfying the current @xmath5 and mixing bounds , we could still see enhancements of @xmath82 in @xmath83  @xcite and @xmath67  @xcite .",
    "moreover , it has been recently argued  @xcite that if large off diagonal sfermion mixings are allowed , the next to leading order expansion in theses mixings reveals the possibility of even larger effects in the @xmath84 vertex .",
    "this would have a large impact in decay modes such as @xmath83 , where the @xmath70 penguin plays a dominant role , resulting in enhancements of the branching ratios of one order of magnitude or more , depending on the modes .",
    "this is an interesting possibility and deserves further study , particularly the correlation with possible enhancements in @xmath1 mixing and rare @xmath1 decays that would result from very large mass insertions in the up - squark sector .",
    "we now turn to examine the potential of rare fcnc decays to constrain anomalous triple gauge boson couplings ( tgc ) . in general",
    ", we can assume in a model independent way , that extensions of the sm might modify some of the couplings of fermions and/or gauge bosons .",
    "in particular , the tgc are of interest since they have not been measured with such precision as some of the fermion couplings .",
    "we have in mind deviations from the sm values for the couplings of a pair of @xmath85 to a photon or a @xmath70 .",
    "we would expect that the anomalous tgc encode the physics of some higher energy scale . imposing @xmath86 conservation , the most general form of the @xmath87 ( @xmath88 ) couplings can be written as  @xcite    @xmath89    with the conventional choices being @xmath90 and @xmath91 . additionally , the are three cp violating lorentz invariant terms , resulting in other 6 parameters : @xmath92 and @xmath93 , obtained from ( [ wwnc ] ) by replacing @xmath94 by the dual field strength ; and @xmath95 from a term similar to the second one in eq .",
    "( [ wwnc ] ) .",
    "gauge invariance implies @xmath96 , @xmath97 .",
    "then , in principle , there are @xmath98 new free parameters .",
    "two cp conserving ( @xmath99 , @xmath100 ) and two cp violating ( @xmath101 , @xmath102 ) affecting the @xmath103 couplings ; four cp conserving ( @xmath104 ,   @xmath105 ,  @xmath106 and @xmath107 ) and three cp violating ( @xmath108 ,  @xmath109 and @xmath110 ) shifting the @xmath111 vertex .",
    "this is a typical problem of this type of approach , where the model independence is traded off by a large number of free parameters the sources of which are not known .",
    "however , simplification is possible , when considering rare @xmath2 and @xmath0 decays .",
    "we can neglect the contribution of @xmath107 ,  @xmath106 , as well as the three @xmath111 cp violating anomalous tgc , since their effects are suppressed by powers of the small external momenta over @xmath112 .",
    "this selective sensitivity is an advantage , rather than a handicap , when we view these measurements as complement of other ones made at higher energies and sensitive to all the @xmath70 tgc .",
    "thus up to this point , we have @xmath113 coefficients left",
    ". however , we can ignore @xmath100 and @xmath102 if we assume that the dynamics producing these non - sm effects resides at a scale parametrically larger than the weak scale , say @xmath114tev . although this is is not general , i believe this is a reasonable scenario , since if this was not the case we should take into account the states that are present with weak scale masses ( e.g. superpartners , weakly coupled scalars , etc . ) and not integrate them out as we do in an effective coupling approach .",
    "when we accept this , we see that in an effective lagrangian approach , these coefficients can only be generated by next to leading order operators , which can be ignored since they are suppressed by @xmath115 with respect to the leading order ones . in these linear realization scenarios , the power counting requires the consideration of @xmath116 and @xmath93 on the same footing with the other anomalous tgc . ] .",
    "thus , at the energies at hand in rare decays , the only relevant coefficients are the three cp conserving parameters ( @xmath99 ,  @xmath117 ,  @xmath105 ) ; and a cp violating one , @xmath118 .",
    "their fcnc effects are most interesting in @xmath2 and @xmath0 decays .",
    "for instance , in fig .",
    "[ fbsg]a we see the sensitivity of the current measurements of the @xmath5 rate to the presence of @xmath99 , whereas in fig .",
    "[ fbsg]b the branching ratio for @xmath19 , normalized to the sm , is plotted against both @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "the effect of @xmath99 in @xmath5 is obtained without any assumption other than the suppression of @xmath100 .",
    "similarly , from fig .",
    "[ fbsg]b we see that the only significant contribution of anomalous tgc to @xmath19 is given by @xmath104 , which could give effects as large as factors of @xmath119 in the branching ratio .",
    "the cp violating parameter @xmath118 gives smaller effects that its cp conserving counterpart since it does not interfere with the sm . in @xmath67",
    "decays again these two coefficients ( @xmath99 , @xmath104 ) give the dominant contributions . in fig .",
    "[ fbsll]a we see the effects of the @xmath111 couplings on the sm normalized branching ratio , taking @xmath120 .",
    "somewhat less dramatic effects are given by this @xmath103 coupling by itself .",
    "however , an interesting feature of these decay modes , is that the additional information given by the lepton asymmetry can be used to disentangle the two contributions . as it can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fbsll]b , the effect of @xmath104 on the forward - backward lepton asymmetry @xmath121 in @xmath122 is such that it does not change the position of the zero  @xcite , but affects the shape of the asymmetry as well as the rate . on the other hand ,",
    "the zero of @xmath121 is shifted significantly by accessible values of @xmath99 .",
    "thus , a measurement of this asymmetry , as well as the rate , provides enough information to constrain the two relevant anomalous tgc without assuming that one of them vanishes .",
    "then , the bounds obtained from fcnc decays are not only competitive with those from high energy colliders , but also complementary to them due to their rather selective sensitivity . for comparison , we show in table  iii the projected sensitivities of lepii  @xcite at @xmath123  gev and @xmath124 integrated luminosity , the upgraded tevatron  @xcite with @xmath125 , and a guess of the @xmath126 sensitivity to be reached in the next round of @xmath2 and @xmath0 experiments for fcnc decays .     &",

    "some of the fcnc decays we discussed are largely dominated by short distance physics , a fact that makes them very sensitive to extensions of the sm entering at one loop .",
    "this is particularly true of the @xmath83 modes as well as for the @xmath128 decays .",
    "the former are accessible at experiments planned for the near future , such as kami and ckm , whereas is not clear how to get sm sensitivity for the neutrino modes in @xmath2 decays . on the other hand , @xmath5 and @xmath67 are short distance dominated modes .",
    "they may contain some long distance pollution as large as @xmath65 , although this is theoretically very uncertain . at the moment",
    "this is not a limiting uncertainty , but it may become an issue when experiments such as lhc - b and btev start running .",
    "rare charm decays are mostly dominated by long distance dynamics .",
    "this , in general , would prevents us from using this physics to test the short distance structure of the sm , but on the other hand it constitutes a laboratory where we could improve our understanding of these effects , something we may need in rare @xmath2 decays . also , there are some exceptions in charm physics , where one may still constrain considerably new physics scenarios .",
    "we mentioned the @xmath60 modes , and also @xmath129 mixing , have the potential to receive large non - standard effects that would appear somewhere between the current experimental limits and the most conservative estimates of the long distance effects .",
    "finally , we have seen how rare fcnc decays complement the searches for new physics at high energy colliders .",
    "it is possible to imagine that , with the wealth of data on these physics that will be available in the near future ( belle , babar , @xmath0 and @xmath2 physics at the tevatron main injector , bnl and cern @xmath0 experiments , etc . )",
    "a program similar to the electroweak precision measurements of the 1990 s could emerge .",
