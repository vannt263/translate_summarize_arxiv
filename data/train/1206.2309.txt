    "the _ relative _ velocities involved in close encounters can be very small compared to the velocity dispersion in star clusters ( typically @xmath18km / s ) .",

    "[ fig : relvel ] shows that the velocity dispersion of ncos at large disk radii is less than in star clusters for small to moderate nco orbital eccentricities and inclinations ( @xmath28 ) .",

    "* ) ; dynamical heating of disk ncos by cusp stars is a new , additional source of disk heating which will contribute to maintaining the outer disk against gravitational instability . a self - consistent calculation of the disk heating requires a disk model ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) and is beyond the scope of this paper , but see mckernan et al .",
    "2012 ( in prep . )",
    "nevertheless , we can see that a large density of ncos in a galactic nucleus will strongly excite the orbits of disk ncos ( @xmath67 is large ) .",
    "gas damping ( @xmath42 ) will naturally transfer much of this dynamical energy to the disk gas .",
    "thus , disk luminosity must increase and the disk itself will puff up .",
    "the scale height increase will be a function of the density of ncos in the nucleus .",
    "therefore , one prediction of our model is that among nuclei with similar supermassive black hole masses , those with denser stellar cusps , should generate more luminous agn disks ( see paper ii ) .",
    "so far we have discussed low mass stars .",
    "however , we are interested in higher mass imbh seeds . for simplicity let us assume a steep nco mass function ( @xmath126 ) with two mass bins .",
    "the low mass population ncos are @xmath84 stars ( @xmath127 in number ) ; thus the high mass nco population is @xmath128 @xmath129 stellar mass black holes . for a total initial disk nco mass of @xmath130 ,",
    "the distribution is @xmath131 low mass stars and 1(10 ) stellar mass black holes .",
    "@xcite show that a low mass population of stars will diffuse out of the disk more than the high mass population of stars and in fact damp the orbits of the high mass stars , as expected from equipartition .",
    "thus , for small initial values of @xmath56 among disk ncos , we expect potential imbh seeds in agn disks to evolve to even smaller eccentricities than the equilibrium value of @xmath132 calculated above .",
    "recall that small eccentricities imply large @xmath14 , allowing imbh seedlings to grow rapidly via collisions .      depending on the recent star formation history of a given galactic nucleus , massive binaries are likely to be rare in agn disks .",
    "however , if there is even _",
    "one _ in the initial agn disk , it will have the largest collisional cross - section of any disk nco and should undergo the largest number of interactions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a massive binary , if present , is therefore the most likely imbh seed and should arise frequently enough to be of astrophysical interest ( for similar ideas concerning planetesimal growth through binary - single interactions in a protoplanetary disk see e.g. @xcite ) . in this section ,",
    "we briefly consider some of the issues involved in binary mergers in an agn disk and we contrast the merger efficiency with that found in star clusters . for ease of comparison",
    "we consider the @xmath133 binary from @xcite .",
    "an unequal mass binary ( @xmath134 , separation @xmath135 ) in the disk is considered hard if its binding energy ( @xmath136 ) is greater than the kinetic energy ( @xmath137 ) of a typical interacting nco .",
    "the collisional cross - section of such a binary is given by @xcite @xmath138 where @xmath139 is the critical velocity separating hard and soft binaries , with @xmath140 is the reduced total mass of the binary ( @xmath141 ) and interacting nco ( @xmath142 ) . the time to merge for a binary of reduced mass @xmath143 where @xmath144 , semi - major axis @xmath135 and eccentricity @xmath145 is @xmath146 and the typical semi - major axis separation for a merger time of @xmath147myr ( assuming @xmath148 ) is @xmath149 where @xmath32 are the masses in units of @xmath150 and @xmath151 respectively @xcite .",
    "however , the above discussion neglects the gas disk .",
    "@xcite carried out hydrodynamic simulations of a binary in an agn disk and found that binaries harden rapidly due to interaction with their own migratory spiral wakes .",
    "@xcite also found that @xmath145 is damped rapidly with inward migration .",
    "the rate of binary hardening ( @xmath152 ) scales with the disk surface density such that @xmath153 , the binary migration timescale .",
    "massive binaries with initial separation @xmath154 , end up at half this separation within 10 orbits of the supermassive black hole , where @xmath155 is the hill radius @xmath156 , with a the semi - major axis of the binary center of mass and q the mass ratio of the reduced mass binary to the supermassive black hole . for a constant rate of hardening ( @xmath152 ) , a @xmath32 migrating binary separated by @xmath157 cm ( or @xmath158(2 au ) ) at @xmath159 will merge in @xmath160myrs , which is a very small fraction of the agn disk lifetime .",
    "so , because of the presence of a gas disk , it is easier to harden binaries in agn disks than in star clusters .",
    "binaries will also encounter field ncos in the disk as they migrate .",
    "this can either result in hardening to merger or disruption .",
    "the probability that a binary is disrupted per unit time is @xmath161 where @xmath162 \\label{eq : disrupt}\\ ] ] where the field nco has mean mass @xmath163 and velocity dispersion @xmath26 , @xmath164 is the number density of field ncos , @xmath165 is the binding energy of the binary , and the average energy change per interaction is @xmath166 @xcite . in stellar clusters",
    "@xmath167 field interactions are required to harden massive binaries to merger @xcite , where the relative velocities at close encounters are approximately the velocity dispersion ( @xmath168 ) in star clusters . in agn disks ,",
    "the number of interactions required to harden a binary to merger depends on the mean eccentricity ( @xmath39 ) of the field nco orbits .",
    "the probability of binary disruption ( @xmath161 ) increases as @xmath39 increases .",
    "however , for already hard binaries ( large @xmath169 ) , fewer interactions ( of energy @xmath170 ) are required for merger in gas disks .",
    "thus , hard binaries will continue to harden due to inward type i migration @xcite _ and _ due to interactions with field ncos in the disk .    for a @xmath171 unequal mass binary ( @xmath32 ) at @xmath159 interacting with a population of ncos having @xmath172 ,",
    "the energy per binary interaction ( @xmath170 ) is @xmath173 the typical interaction energy in stellar clusters ( where @xmath174 km @xmath27 ) .",
    "so for highly damped nco orbits , binary interactions are likely to be soft. the number of interactions depends on the disk nco surface density . if this binary is already hard , it could merge within a few orbits , i.e. orders of magnitude faster than binary merger timescales in stellar clusters .",
    "the gas in the agn disk exerts a net torque on ncos .",
    "this means that individual ncos ( and imbh ) will migrate within the gas disk , enhancing the probability of collision and merger .",
    "migration is mostly inward in disks , although sometimes outward .",
    "this means that imbh can migrate into new regions of the disk , in search of new nco victims. the imbh feeding zone ( approximately @xmath10 ) moves with the migrating imbh .",
    "this is analagous to a giant planet core continuing to collide with planetesimals as it migrates through a protoplanetary disk @xcite .",
    "migration can stall in disks , leading to a pile - up ( overdensity of disk ncos ) . in this case",
    "rapid merger leading to rapid imbh growth may occur , by analogy with pile - up in protoplanetary disks @xcite .",
    "a detailed calculation of this scenario will be carried out in future work .",
    "ncos and imbh may also migrate onto the central supermassive black hole , just as protoplanets may migrate onto a central star .",
    "so the issue of imbh survival in agn disks parallels the survival of giant planets in protoplanetary disks .",
    "ncos with mass ratios @xmath175 of the mass of the central supermassive black hole will undergo migration in the disk analagous to type i protoplanetary migration , on a timescale of @xcite @xmath176 where @xmath177 is the central mass , @xmath12 is the ratio of the satellite ( nco ) mass to the central ( supermassive black hole ) mass , @xmath178 is the disk surface density , @xmath179 is the disk aspect ratio and @xmath180 is the satellite angular frequency .",

    "larger mass migrators ( stellar mass black holes , binaries , large mass stars or seed imbh ) are likely to have migration timescales roughly comparable with the agn disk lifetime . therefore , as imbh seedlings grow in mass they should migrate in the disk and encounter low mass ncos at low relative velocities . if migration stalls for a given nco , either inwards at small disk radii , or outwards at large disk radii , interactions are possible at incredibly low relative velocities ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "note that spiral density waves from migrating ncos should not strongly perturb the nco migrations or their orbits @xcite . here",

    "an assumption of independent migration seems reasonable , but future simulations involving multiple migrators are required to test this assumption .    because we expect ncos in the agn disk to migrate differentially , we expect the migrators to encounter each other .",
    "as large mass ncos migrate inwards across the orbits of less - massive ncos , if the gas has damped @xmath39 ( see  [ sec : ecc ] above ) the relative velocities ( @xmath15 ) will be low and the collision cross - section ( with gravitational focussing ) will be large .",
    "however , different large mass ncos will have different outcomes from multiple interactions .",
    "large stars could have a shorter life expectancy if there are many nco interactions increasing the odds of merger and supernova .",
    "stellar mass black holes and imbh seedlings will tend to shred low mass main sequence or giant stellar ncos as they migrate inwards , although they can swallow compact ncos whole as tidal forces shred compact objects only after the compact object crosses the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) .",

    "although conditions in the innermost agn disk are dramatically different from those in the outskirts , it is useful to consider the possibility of nco pile - ups .",
    "evidently , if the agn inner disk truncates at some radius and then becomes a geometrically thick , optically thin advection flow , nco migrators will stall near the disk truncation radius . as ncos build up over time , the chances of interaction increase and hypervelocity scatterings become likely .",

    "a gap will have major implications for observational signatures in agn , but we defer that discussion to paper ii .",

    "evidently a gap - opening imbh can migrate on timescales shorter than the agn lifetime across the disk .",
    "we therefore have to ask whether any gap - opening imbh will survive the agn disk ? this is analagous to a major problem encountered in proto - planetary disk theory",
    ". the migration of some gap - opening migrators must somehow stall before accretion onto the central mass , otherwise no jupiter - mass planets would be observed .",
    "one solution to this problem is that type ii migration can stall once the co - rotating disk mass is less than the migrator mass .",

    "this radius is @xmath215 for a @xmath208 imbh .",
    "once type ii migration stalls , it can resume but at a much slower rate , once the migrators angular momentum is exported to the local disk ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "if we simply assume the imbh can undergo type ii in - migration without stalling , the imbh will collide with ncos at radii interior to its starting position @xmath213 before accreting onto the supermassive black hole in 1(30myrs ) . ignoring gas accretion ,",
    "the imbh can swallow up to @xmath216 of the uniformly distributed disk nco population if it starts migrating at @xmath217 .",

    "if the imbh stalls permanently at @xmath215 , only a small number of remaining migrators ( @xmath220 of the remaining disk nco population ) migrate inwards to merge with the imbh within 50myrs .    to sum up , for a powerlaw stellar mass function ( @xmath221 ) ,",
    "most ncos should be low mass stars ( @xmath222 ) with a small fraction of compact ncos ( mostly white dwarfs , some neutron stars and stellar mass black holes ) .",
    "the largest mass ncos ( and seeds for imbhs ) are likely to be small in number , and consist of stellar mass black holes or massive binaries .",
    "imbh seedlings will undergo type i migration in the disk .",
    "imbh migration means that they can maintain a feeding zone of disk ncos as they catch up with the much more slowly migrating low mass disk ncos .",
    "this migration of the feeding zone is precisely analagous to the situation expected for migrating giant planets ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "some of the classic problems of protoplanetary migration ( e.g. how to stop migrators from accreting onto the central object , or how to get migrators moving once stalled ) will also apply to imbh seeds in agn disks .",
    "nevertheless , low relative velocity encounters due to migration will result in large nco collision cross - sections and will help grow imbh seeds via core accretion .",
    "in this section , we shall draw together much of the above discussion and construct a simple model of imbh growth in agn disks .",
    "the starting point for our model is a stellar mass black hole .",

    "this is a very high accretion rate for a black hole , exceeding inferred accretion rates from gas disks in most seyfert agn @xcite .",

    "once the imbh reaches its isolation mass , it will then grow via accretion from the gas disk , at a much slower rate ( eddington or a fraction thereof ) .",

    "<S> here we propose a mechanism for efficiently growing intermediate mass black holes ( imbh ) in disks around supermassive black holes . </S>",
    "<S> stellar mass objects can efficiently agglomerate when facilitated by the gas disk . </S>",
    "<S> stars , compact objects and binaries can migrate , accrete and merge within disks around supermassive black holes . while dynamical heating by cusp stars excites the velocity dispersion of nuclear cluster objects ( ncos ) in the disk , gas in the disk damps nco orbits . </S>",
    "<S> if gas damping dominates , ncos remain in the disk with circularized orbits and large collision cross - sections . </S>",
    "<S> imbh seeds can grow extremely rapidly by collisions with disk ncos at low relative velocities , allowing for super - eddington growth rates . </S>",
    "<S> once an imbh seed has cleared out its feeding zone of disk ncos , growth of imbh seeds can become dominated by gas accretion from the agn disk . </S>",
    "<S> however , the imbh can migrate in the disk and expand its feeding zone , permitting a super - eddington accretion rate to continue . </S>",
    "<S> growth of imbh seeds via nco collisions is enhanced by a pile - up of migrators .    </S>",
    "<S> we highlight the remarkable parallel between the growth of imbh in agn disks with models of giant planet growth in protoplanetary disks . if an imbh becomes massive enough it can open a gap in the agn disk . </S>",
    "<S> imbh migration in agn disks may stall , allowing them to survive the end of the agn phase and remain in galactic nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> our proposed mechanisms should be more efficient at growing imbh in agn disks than the standard model of imbh growth in stellar clusters . </S>",
    "<S> dynamical heating of disk ncos by cusp stars is transferred to the gas in a agn disk helping to maintain the outer disk against gravitational instability . </S>",
    "<S> model predictions , observational constraints and implications are discussed in a companion paper ( paper ii ) .    </S>",
