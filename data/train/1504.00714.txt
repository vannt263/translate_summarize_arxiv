    "feature finding algorithms are designed to automatically localize the intensity centroid of a specific feature in an image . in biological systems ,",
    "the features of interest are often fluorescently labelled proteins and organelles , with dimensions below the diffraction limit ; the intensity distributions to be localized are therefore diffraction limited spots .",
    "feature finding algorithms consist of two main steps to automatically detect and then localize all features of interest in a given image .",
    "the first step is an initial detection of local intensity maxima over the entire image , identifying candidate feature locations to pixel resolution . in the second step ,",
    "the full intensity distribution of the candidate features , which spans many pixels , is used to localize the centroid of each intensity distribution to sub - pixel resolution .    to extract the real space dynamics of a feature from a time - series of images , tracking algorithms establish the correspondence between features in successive image frames ,",
    "forming a set of single - particle trajectories .",
    "in general , feature correspondence is determined by minimizing the displacement of localized features between frames .",
    "the ability of tracking algorithms to reconstruct feature trajectories with high fidelity is critically dependent on the ability of the localization algorithm to determine the particle positions accurately .    among articles that assess the limits of accuracy and precision of particle localization algorithms , cheesum _ et al . _",
    "@xcite quantitatively compare algorithms for localizing fluorescently labelled objects in two - dimensions , from among centre - of - mass algorithms , direct gaussian fitting which exploits the shape of the intensity distribution for a diffraction - limited spot , image cross - correlation algorithms , and sum - absolute difference methods .",
    "typically , centre - of - mass and direct gaussian fitting methods obtain sub - pixel resolution directly .",
    "in contrast , both the cross - correlation and sum - absolute difference methods determine the object s position to only pixel resolution . to obtain sub - pixel resolution ,",
    "the cross - correlation or sum - absolute difference matrices must be interpolated .",
    "measured accuracy as the mean difference between the localized position and actual position of a simulated object over a large number of trials and determined , unsurprisingly , the direct gaussian to be the superior algorithm for localizing point sources .",
    "_ examine the factors that limit the precision of centroid localization  @xcite , for limiting cases where a large number @xmath1 of signal photons are collected , in which the data is considered photon shot - noise limited ; and the limit of small @xmath1 , where the image is considered background noise limited , obtaining the theoretical limiting precision for one spatial dimension , @xmath2 by considering each of these limits independently and linear interpolation between them  @xcite .    in a more general treatment ,",
    "ober _ et al .",
    "_ have used a fisher information matrix to determine the limit of localization precision for single - molecule microscopy @xcite .",
    "the inverse of the fisher information matrix is independent of the particular localization procedure .",
    "however , importantly , ober _ et al .",
    "_ assumed the localization procedure would provide an _ unbiased _ estimate of the object location .",
    "this assumption is not justified for all localization routines , as was shown in @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "the ultimate limit of localization precision , as a function of the emission wavelength @xmath3 , photon emission rate @xmath4 , objective lens numerical aperture @xmath5 , and acquisition time @xmath6 , is @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the optical system efficiency , defined as the fraction of photons leaving the object that reach the detector .",
    "this is a fundamental limit of localization and does not include the effects of pixelation or noise  @xcite .",
    "when these effects are included , the relation is much more complicated , and the limiting precision depends on the particular imaging conditions and detector specifications .",
    "knowledge of the expected intensity distribution for a diffraction - limited spot is used in feature localization routines to obtain the spatial coordinates of an object with high precision and accuracy .",
    "this knowledge can also be used to segregate two spots that are closely spaced .",
    "@xcite developed a method for automatic detection of diffraction - limited spots separated by less than the rayleigh limit in three - dimensional image stacks under the key assumption that each spot detected in an image is comprised of a finite number of superimposed psf s . using simulated data , thomann _",
    "_ @xcite found that their algorithm can resolve points at sub - rayleigh separation .",
    "the localization accuracy approached the nanometer range for signal - to - noise greater than @xmath9 db , and was sub-20 nm for lower signal - to - noise ratios .",
    "high accuracy was only maintained for points separated by at least the rayleigh limit , and depended on the relative brightness of the two points .",
    "spots of equal brightness could be distinguished at a distance of half the rayleigh limit . for cases where the spots differ in brightness ,",
    "the resolution limit decreased by up to 50 % .",
    "several works address high fidelity tracking in systems where particle trajectories may overlap  @xcite , a common problem encountered in using two - dimensional detection to acquire images of three - dimensional objects .",
    "imaging using three dimensional detection of diffraction - limited spots separated by greater than the rayleigh limit lifts the degeneracy of particle overlaps and ( dis)appearances .",
    "just as the dynamical resolution of point - like objects is limited by the resolution in the feature localization , so also the resolution for volumetric changes of cells or subnuclear regions is limited by the faithfulness of any surface reconstruction being performed .",
    "many works address the problem of reconstructing the topography of a surface from sample points in three dimensional spaces  @xcite .",
    "watertight surface reconstructions , which return a well - defined interior and exterior , are needed for many applications , including computer graphics , computer aided design , medical imaging and solid modeling , but are not guaranteed by many reconstruction methods .",
    "basic surface reconstruction techniques can be classified into explicit representations , including parametric surfaces and triangulated surfaces , in which all or most of the points are directly interpolated based on structures from computational geometry , such as delaunay triangulations ; and implicit representations , which solve the problem implicitly in 3d space by fitting the point cloud to a basis function , and then extracting the reconstructed surface as an iso - surface of the implicit function .",
    "methods in the second category differ mainly in the different implicit functions used .",
    "implicit representations are a natural representation for volumetric data : the marching - cube ( mc)-like algorithm  @xcite is currently the most popular algorithm for isosurface extraction from medical scans ( ct , mri ) or other volumetric data  @xcite .",
    "mc has been applied to subcellular  @xcite and cellular  @xcite volumetric data using commercially - available software applied to three - dimensional image data obtained by confocal microscopy .",
    "mc produces the desired watertight , closed surface and is easy to parallelize , but requires uniform ( over-)sampling , produces degenerate triangles ( requiring post - processing re - meshing ) , and does not preserve features .",
    "while the output mesh that mc generates is adequate for visualization purposes , it is far from being suitable for surface or volume quantification in situations of local undersampling due to high curvature .    in practice , the data may sample only part of a surface densely , and may suffer from inadequate sampling in other , local regions , either due to non - perfect homogeneous distribution of a fluorescent reporter , or to local high curvature of those regions relative to the imaging ( pixel ) sampling rate .",
    "for example , in budding yeast , due to the small cell size and the even smaller incipient daughter cell ( bud ) size , there are local regions in which the curvature may be high relative to the sampling , even when sampled at the highest microscope magnification .",
    "existing surface reconstruction algorithms face difficulty if the data contains local undersampling , and will yield holes or artifacts under these conditions .",
    "we envision many scenarios where local undersampling is present .",
    "the tight cocone method generates a surface representation given a set of sample points , suppressing undesirable triangles and repairing and filling the holes in the surface  @xcite .",
    "it provides a water - tight reconstruction even when the sampling bounds required by other algorithms are not met . for surfaces that are complex , i.e. that are not single compartments , the tight cocone algorithm will reconstruct the full surface . by decomposing the space and re - running the algorithm",
    ", we are able to build more complete volumetric representation of the dividing yeast cells , producing watertight reconstructions of each compartment . in this work ,",
    "feature finding and tracking in living cells was developed together with surface reconstruction and volume determination .",
    "the algorithms are semi - automated to maximize the number of cells that can be analyzed with a minimal amount of subjective manual input .",
    "these new methods were applied to investigate budding yeast mitotic spindle dynamics at a high spatial resolution over the entire cell cycle , and the compartment volumes of dividing cells .",
    "to analyze the spatial location of mitotic spindle poles in a reference frame intrinsic to the dividing _ s. cerevisiae _ cell , we determined the 3d position of the poles and , in parallel , the cell bounding surface , the plane of cell division ( neck plane ) , and neck plane center , as landmarks .",
    "to fluorescently tag spindle poles , we used cells in which the chromosomal copy of spc42 was fused to the red fluorescent tandem - dimer tomato .",
    "we additionally used cells in which the chromosomal copy of the g - protein gpa1 was fused to gfp , to visualize the cell surface in the same cells .",
    "we imaged asynchronous live - cell populations in three dimensions , yielding images containing up to @xmath10 cells each .     and",
    "@xmath11 lie in the plane of separating the mother and bud cavity during cell division , called the _ bud neck _ in budding yeast .",
    "the @xmath12 coordinate in this definition is positive in the mother cavity and negative in the bud.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    experiments were performed at a temperature of 25 @xmath13c . at this temperature",
    "the budding yeast cell cycle is @xmath14 hours .",
    "photobleaching restricts the window of time that a single cell can be observed at several nanometer resolution .",
    "thus , to capture spindle dynamics over the entire cell division , populations of unsynchronized cells were observed , with each cell in a field - of - view acting as a sample of a specific temporal window of the cell cycle .",
    "the spindle poles were labelled with one fluorescent protein and cell periphery was labelled with a different fluorescent protein .",
    "the spindle pole trajectories and mother and bud cavity surfaces were reconstructed from fluorescence data as described below .",
    "the final result of pole and surface finding is an ensemble of spindle pole trajectories , with the capability for each trajectory to be described in a coordinate system relevant to cell division for that cell .",
    "the geometry resulting from such an analysis for a single cell is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : img_sim : cell_coord ] . in the next section ,",
    "the algorithms used for extracting spindle pole dynamics and cell surface topography are described .",
    "all implementations were written in matlab ( mathworks , natick , ma ) .      as described above , knowledge of the expected intensity distribution for a diffraction - limited spot can be used to automatically localize fluorescently - labelled objects that are smaller than the diffraction - limit .",
    "the general principle of the localization routine is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : ff:3d_ff_principle ] . by fitting the full intensity distribution of the object to a three - dimensional gaussian function",
    ", the centroid of the spot can be determined to sub - pixel resolution in all three dimensions .    to construct spindle pole trajectories from a time series of confocal fluorescence image stacks ,",
    "an automated three - dimensional feature - finding and tracking algorithm was used .",
    "the algorithm locates the centroids of the spindle pole intensity distributions , termed features , to sub - pixel resolution in 3d in a series of successive confocal image stacks acquired at controlled time intervals .",
    "it was originally developed as center - of - mass fitting for applications in colloidal systems at 3d sub pixel resolution  @xcite , and adapted for application in living cells using gaussian fitting by two of the authors .",
    "the tracking algorithm links localized features in sequential image stacks and outputs a time series of coordinates for each feature .",
    "the resolution of the three - dimensional localization depends on the signal - to - noise ratio of the images , as will be discussed in detail below . for this study",
    ", the localization accuracy is between @xmath15 and @xmath9 nm in 3d .    the automated feature finding consists of three main steps : filtering , initial estimation of feature positions , and refinement of position estimates . to suppress image artifacts and noise , which exhibit high spatial frequencies ( small length scale )",
    ", the images are initially filtered using a three - dimensional band - pass gaussian kernel . by choosing a spatial cut - off for the filter kernel close to the characteristic size of a diffraction - limited spot",
    ", high frequency noise is attenuated to a level far below that of true features .",
    "once the image has been filtered , pixels that are local intensity maxima can be used as initial estimates for feature positions . to further distinguish real features from noise",
    ", the integrated intensity is calculated for a sub - volume surrounding each of the local maxima .",
    "features for which the integrated intensity is below a cut - off value are excluded from further processing . at this point , the feature position estimates have a spatial resolution equal to the pixel size , typically 180 nm in @xmath16 and @xmath17 and 300 nm in @xmath18 . to refine the feature position ,",
    "a three - dimensional gaussian function is fit to the intensity distribution within the sub - volume surrounding the initial estimate , using non - linear least squares .",
    "the final sub - pixel estimation of the feature location is obtained by a second iteration of gaussian fitting .",
    "the second iteration involves first shifting the pixel - spaced sub - volume so that it is distributed around the centroid of the initial gaussian fit  @xcite , followed by a second least squares gaussian function fit , using the outputs of the initial fit as parameter estimates for the second fit .",
    "the band - pass length scale , the dimensions of the sub - volume used for fitting , the integrated intensity cut - off value , and a characteristic size of the object are used to define a region around the candidate feature in which a second feature can not be located , and are defined by the user .",
    "the last parameter is adjusted to allow or reject any overlap between two or more features of interest .",
    "these four parameters are set to optimize the fidelity of feature localization across a large number of cells contained in a single field - of - view .",
    "since photobleaching degrades the signal of a given feature as it is observed over time , the integrated intensity cut - off can be automatically reduced by a user - defined constant factor for each timepoint in the series of confocal stacks .",
    "the tracking algorithm links localized features in sequential image stacks and outputs a time series of coordinates for each feature .",
    "the algorithm used here is based on crocker _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite and implemented in matlab  @xcite .",
    "feature coordinates are linked in time by minimizing the total displacement of each of the identified features between successive frames .",
    "the search for corresponding features in consecutive frames is constrained to a maximum likely displacement over the timescale between frames .",
    "accurate and robust tracking is obtained by tailoring the timescale of image acquisition and the cut - off distance to the particular dynamics of the features being tracked .",
    "high fidelity tracking is obtained by applying successive iterations of the tracking algorithm to each data set  @xcite .",
    "this method ensures that the majority of trajectories over a cell population are captured , and results in data sets biased for trajectories that persist to long times .",
    "the cell periphery is visualized using fluorescent reporters that localize to the cell cortex . using the procedure we developed ,",
    "if the reporter is distributed uniformly over the entire surface , the fluorescence intensity distribution in a confocal image stack can be used to reconstruct the cell surface .",
    "automated surface reconstruction is carried out on stacks of images obtained using reporters that label the periphery of living cells , provided the resolution in @xmath19 is sufficient and the label ( dye or fluorescent reporter protein ) distributes uniformly around the cell periphery .",
    "key features of the surface shape that are important to cell division , such as the bud neck in budding yeast , may then be extracted .",
    "the plane of cell division in budding yeast is called the bud neck : in any dividing cell it is characterized by local deformation of the bounding surface to create two cavities out of one .",
    "in addition to the final topology change , local geometry is also modified smoothly during the process of cell division . using the mother and bud cavity fits for each cell",
    ", the neck plane position and orientation can be calculated using the methods described here .",
    "the automated surface reconstruction procedure we developed consists of five main steps : filtering and thinning , initial estimation of closed bounding surface , refinement of surface estimates by decomposition of the space , calculation of volume of each convex cavity ( here , mother and bud cavity of mitotic cells ) , and , in mitotic cells , determination of position , orientation , and size of the neck separating the mother and bud cavities , which provides a basis coordinate system for cell division unique to each cell .",
    "the first step of surface feature finding begins with spatial filtering of the image stack , with the characteristic size parameter of the 3d band pass algorithm corresponding to the surface thickness . using a first estimate of the thickness",
    ", one can iterate through different values until the surface and a reasonable cavity size are reproduced with optimum fidelity .",
    "the thresholding step must use a threshold value that maximizes the amount of surface included , while minimizing artefacts such as protrusions , small clusters away from the surface , and non - faithful connection between opposite sides of a cavity .",
    "typically , the true surface data is comprised of thousands of connected voxels , whereas small noise clusters may span only a few hundred voxels or less , providing an effective means for the identification and removal of small noise clusters .    the thresholded image stack is then sliced in @xmath20-plane images , each of which is `` thinned '' to a minimal collection of points that preserves holes and general shape , to allow for a full surface reconstruction .",
    "thinning was used instead of skeletonization which is less suited for minimizing the surface data as it sporadically produces branches .",
    "the thinning algorithm transforms an entity within the image into a single pixel thickness entity  @xcite .",
    "the algorithm yields good results on slices near the equator of the surface to be analyzed , where it reduces a thick shell to a 1 pixel - wide shell .",
    "an example on one focal plane of data acquired from the surface reporter imaging in budding yeast , before and after the thinning step , are shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : meth_surf3 ] ( a - b ) .",
    "on nearly - flat curved surfaces , which are manifest in slices through the top or bottom of a cell , the thinning algorithm has the undesired effect of reducing a uniform disk to a single or branching lines .",
    "by additionally slicing the image stack into sets of @xmath21 and @xmath22 planes , and processing these sets of planes with the thinning algorithm , we eliminate these artifacts specific to the slicing direction . in these new slices , `` top '' and",
    "`` bottom '' caps are instead part of equatorial profiles .",
    "the result produces good performance , defining the top and bottom of the cell as a collection of points in a contour .",
    "the estimated minimal set of points describing the surface is then constructed by merging the results from the @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 slice directions .",
    "we assemble the final cloud of points by requiring that for a point in space to be retained , it must appear in at least two of the slicing directions .",
    "the resulting 3d thinned version of the thresholded image stack is composed of a cloud of points centered approximately in the middle of the original thick surface of the image stack .",
    "again small disconnected clusters of points can be removed from the thinned surface by requiring a certain minimum size of connected points .",
    "the output of this discrete cloud of points estimation step is used as input to the voronoi - based algorithm to obtain useful surface representation , which can then be used to quantify volume .      to define the volume , the scattered point samples of the surface need to be turned into a proper watertight surface mesh . in cases where the signal is strong and uniform , an accurate",
    ", arbitrarily - shaped tessellated surface can be obtained via a full surface reconstruction .",
    "we achieve this using the tight cocone software  @xcite applied to the minimized discrete surface points .",
    "the tight cocone algorithm takes a point distribution in 3d and attempts to reconstruct a water - tight surface described by those points .",
    "the algorithm is robust to local undersampling as intended , but as it is sensitive to noise , we supply the filtered data .",
    "the output is a list of triangles that comprise the reconstructed surface . as a proof - of - concept example , the result on one budding yeast cell for which the surface is thus tessellated is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : meth_surf3 ] .",
    "the determined surface is remarkably faithful to the actual cell s topography , reproducing bumps , curves , and the typical smooth curvature transitions at the bud neck .      from a reconstructed surface , quantities such as volume may then be computed .",
    "if the shape is a single convex hull , the volume can be computed simply , by using a well - known algorithm .",
    "if the complete surface is not a single convex hull , this approach will not robustly provide the volume .",
    "for example , in budding yeast , the bud cavity can protrude significantly out of the mother , with a concave neck region linking the two cavities . however , individually , the mother and bud cavities are convex .",
    "we effectively decompose the complex multiple - hull surface into individual convex hulls , for each of which compartment the volume can be determined .    in principle",
    ", the negative curvature of the neck region could be used to obtain the orientation and location of the plane separating the mother and bud cavities . in practice , even though the periphery is well - labeled so that the whole surface can be reconstructed , undersampling prevents determination of the local curvature everywhere . moreover , in small budded cells the neck curvature may only just change sign at the transition region from mother to bud . instead",
    ", we exploit other information to uniquely identify the tessellated surface data in this region between the two cavities . in our dividing cells ,",
    "we subdivide the surface into sections by performing a fit of two ellipsoids to the minimized surface points . for each vertex of the closed bounding surface",
    ", we then compute the shortest distance to the fitted ellipsoids .",
    "the computed proximity is used to segregate the vertices into two subsets : those assigned to the mother cavity , and those assigned to the bud cavity . after this assignment step",
    ", we perform the water - tight surface reconstruction on each segregated point set .",
    "this provides individual convex surfaces which are used for robust calculation of volumes for each of the two cavities . following this step ,",
    "those triangles in the original full surface reconstruction having at least one vertex belonging to each of the mother and bud sets are assigned to the neck region , and are used to reconstruct the surface of the neck region .",
    "all of these steps are carried out for each dividing cell .",
    "the volume of a convex hull can be computed simply , as follows .",
    "considering any point on the surface of or inside the volume , the volume is calculated as the sum of all pyramids whose base is one of the triangles forming the surface and whose summit is that point .",
    "these pyramids constitute a complete set , containing the volume enclosed by the surface , and the sum of their volumes is the total volume of the convex hull .      from the minimized points forming the neck surface ,",
    "we extract geometric characteristics of the neck by fitting a circle ( or ellipse ) to these points .",
    "this yields the neck plane location ( including the center ) ; circumference ; and , via its normal , orientation with respect to the imaging frame of reference .",
    "knowledge of this plane provides a reference frame for cell division unique to each cell . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : meth_surf3 ] ( d ) , this automated procedure results in faithful description of the orientation and position of the neck plane between the mother and bud cavities .",
    "the results obtained show the suitability of the method for a correct representation of the target object .",
    "the trajectories of other point - like features obtained simultaneously with the surface in each cell can now be transformed into their cell - unique coordinate system , and therefore examined relative to the neck origin .",
    "together , the spindle position and surface mapping could additionally be used in tandem to define a wealth of physical observables .",
    "measuring the dynamics of the mitotic spindle in a coordinate space defined by the plane of cell division , over a population of cells , would reveal dynamical and shape cues related to stages of the cell cycle not quantifiable precisely by other methods . specifically , spindle orientation , and translocation with respect to the neck plane ,",
    "could be obtained automatically .",
    "the orientation of the normal vector to the neck plane , @xmath23 is determined from the fitting as described above , and its sign can be assigned as desired : we here define @xmath24 as extending into the mother cavity .",
    "a spindle vector @xmath25 may be defined as the vector spanning from the pole proximal to the bud to the pole distal to the bud .",
    "spindle orientation is then parametrized by the angle @xmath26 between @xmath25 and @xmath23 , given by @xmath27 , where @xmath28 .",
    "for each cell , the spindle orientation and its angular excursions may be calculated over the observation window .",
    "the distance of the spindle poles from the neck plane may be computed by constructing the vectors @xmath29 , representing the displacement of each spb located at point @xmath30 from the neck centre at point @xmath31 .",
    "the distance , given by @xmath32 , is positive for all @xmath30 in the mother cavity , and negative for all @xmath30 in the bud cavity , using our definition of the @xmath23 direction .",
    "accurate segregation of aberrant spindle positioning behavior from that of normal cells would require knowledge of the spindle size and position relative to the mother and bud cavities .",
    "such studies , achievable at high resolution in cells in sc medium with both poles and surfaces labelled , will be enabled by these tools .    the ability to calculate compartment volume might have other uses .",
    "not all volumes one wants to quantify are conveniently regular .",
    "chromosome territories , nucleoli , and golgi bodies are all examples of compartments with complex distributions or irregular outlines , occupying in higher eukaryotes approximately the same volume as the yeast cells under study here , a few tens of femtoliters  @xcite . methods to study such compartments in a statistically meaningful manner have been limited and are generally complicated by the fact that estimating the volume of such exclusion zones requires calculating the volume of irregular domains .",
    "the accuracy of feature finding and tracking in cells is influenced by many factors .",
    "signal - to - noise must be maximized with well defined intensity distributions for each feature , spanning multiple voxels so that the nyquist criterion is satisfied . the hardware , signal - to - noise , and sampling requirements limit the achievable temporal resolution .",
    "investigation of fast dynamics in the cell requires some trade - off between temporal and spatial resolution . a detailed assessment of the factors influencing the performance of localization algorithms to determine the limits of the spatial resolution greatly aids in the design and interpretation of feature finding experiments .",
    "a simulation of diffraction - limited spots that is relevant to the experimental conditions requires knowledge of the true psf of the optical system used for the experiment .",
    "the theoretical description of a confocal psf is only relevant in the ideal aberration - free scenario , and it is necessary to measure the real psf of the microscope .",
    "measurement of the psf will reveal any aberrations that may be present in the optical system .    the image of an object that is smaller than the diffraction - limit closely approximates the true psf of the microscope . in an optical system , a diffraction - limited object acts as a low - pass spatial filter with a high cut - off frequency relative to that of the otf .",
    "the cut - off frequency increases as the inverse of the object size .",
    "the true psf is the image of an infinitesimal object , i.e.  one with an infinite bandwidth .",
    "however , in practical imaging conditions , background and noise signals often mask any contribution of high frequency components to the psf , so that the effect of a small but non - zero object size on the psf is negligible",
    ". therefore subresolution fluorescent beads may be used to measure the psf .",
    "measurement of the psf for our optical system is described in the supplementary materials  @xcite .    to simulate all aspects of image acquisition realistically ,",
    "the background or bias signal and the readout noise from the ccd camera were also measured , as also described in  @xcite .      in order to determine the accuracy and precision associated with the feature localization algorithms used in this hybrid method , the localization algorithms",
    "were applied to computer generated confocal images of spindle pole bodies .",
    "our procedure for generating these simulated images , using parameters drawn directly from our hardware , signal - to - noise , and 3d sampling characteristics , is described in  @xcite .    for each simulation run ,",
    "an image was generated at a given signal level and with a given displacement between the two diffraction - limited spots in a prescribed direction in three - dimensional space .",
    "noise characteristic of the yeast medium and camera ( as measured ;  @xcite ) was added to the image , and the feature localization algorithm was applied . at each signal level and",
    "spot separation tested , 500 iterations of feature finding were performed with a new noise profile generated for each iteration .",
    "all simulations were performed in matlab .",
    "feature localization parameters were set to the values used for live cell trials .",
    "the feature coordinates , as determined by the localization algorithm , were then compared to the real coordinates to obtain an estimate of the localization error over a range of signal - to - noise values and spot separations .",
    "knowledge of the true spot locations allows for an estimate of both precision and accuracy of a given measurement .",
    "the deviation between the actual position and the localized position was derived in this way .",
    "the result for a point - to - point displacement typical of a metaphase spindle , over a range of signal - to - noise levels , is shown in fig .   [",
    "fig : img_sim : error_vs_rsn ] .",
    "anaphase spindles have greater separation and even less vector component along the @xmath18 direction , so suffer less from localization error than than do metaphase spindles .",
    "budding yeast cells are small , rendering subcellular quantitation challenging .",
    "nevertheless , the spindle poles in these cells are separated by @xmath33 in the early phase of cell division ( metaphase ) , and by larger distance later in the cell cycle .",
    "thus the metaphase spindle is the more stringent test of true subpixel and aberration - free resolving of the spindle pole features from one another . in our applications studied here , metaphase and anaphase , the spindle pole psfs in our optical system do not overlap . using the simulations we had developed , we tested the effect of overlap at distances of the same order as , and smaller than , our metaphase spindle length , to validate that effects of overlapping of features need not be taken into account at these distances , and determine at what separations such effects play a role .",
    "interestingly , we found that when filtering is used , the filtering itself is a source of small overestimation of the separations at distances @xmath34 .",
    "for such separations , spatial band - pass filtering attenuates the summed intensity distribution in the region between the two points , and forces the least - squares fitting routine to localize the centroid of each intensity distribution away from the overlap region , resulting in overestimation of the point - to - point separation . as overlap increases ,",
    "the centroids of each feature are forced back towards the overlap region , initially decreasing the estimated separation , until significant overlap has occurred at @xmath35 , and the two spots are difficult to distinguish ( see figs .  [",
    "fig : img_sim:2poinintdist ] ,  [ fig : img_sim : msep_vs_asep ] ) .    for automated feature detection with live cell image data ,",
    "spatial band - pass filtering is often necessary .",
    "real data is subject to many sources of noise , and accurate automated segregation of the real features of interest from noise is often not possible without spatial filtering .",
    "therefore , although our feature separations here well exceed this limit , the systematic bias demonstrated here will always contribute to the localization error for closely - spaced features .",
    "although small , this effect must be considered in the interpretation of the results of a feature finding experiment under such conditions .",
    "propagation of localization error in the separation of two points was studied in order to determine its role , if any , in the observable @xmath36 , the spindle pole - pole separation  @xcite .",
    "comparison of measured error with propagated error for point - to - point separation showed that for large separations , the covariant terms are negligible ( see fig .  [",

    "convolution of the object and psf was performed by two - dimensional fast fourier transform of each of the arrays , multiplication in the frequency domain , and finally , inverse fourier transformation ( fig .",
    "[ fig : img_sim ] ( c ) ) . to avoid circular convolution ,",
    "the image and psf arrays were appropriately zero padded prior to fourier transformation .",
    "convolution of the object with the psf results in the intensity distribution of a diffraction - limited spot in the continuous image space , the magnitude of which is interpreted in terms of a number of photons . to generate a realistic image that is comparable to experimentally acquired images , it is necessary to sample the continuous image space intensity distribution into a discrete distribution collected by the ccd detector . to do this ,",
    "the image space intensity distribution is resampled to a pixel grid , with each pixel representing an individual ccd element ( fig .",
    "[ fig : img_sim ] ( d ) ) . to simulate the spindle poles ,",
    "two diffraction - limited spots are produced in the image .",
    "the ccd grid has voxel dimensions of 174 nm in @xmath2 and @xmath78 , and 300 nm in @xmath19 , to mimic the experimental conditions . to construct the ccd voxel distribution ,",
    "the continuous image space distribution was sampled at a number of focal planes in the @xmath19-stack .",
    "finite depth - of - field was explicitly accounted for at each @xmath19-slice by weighting the image space matrix by a gaussian function with an amplitude of 1 and a standard deviation of @xmath99 pixels , centered on the particular @xmath19-slice .",
    "the intensity distribution in the focal plane was then constructed by integrating the depth - of - field - weighted image space matrix along @xmath19 .",
    "each ccd pixel in the focal plane was formed by integrating the focal plane over square regions corresponding to the ccd pixels .",
    "the resulting matrix represents the distribution of photons impinging upon each of the ccd elements for each focal plane collected .",
    "this matrix is adjusted by a scaling factor to control the signal - to - noise .",
    "sub - pixel displacements of the object were produced by shifting the image space grid by one or more of its elements , with respect to the overlying ccd grid .",
    "detector noise and background offset were added to each image stack at intensity levels corresponding to experimental values . to represent the photon detection process accurately ,",
    "poisson noise was simulated for each pixel by random sampling from a poisson distribution with a mean of @xmath1 , where @xmath1 represents the number of photons impinging on each pixel .",
    "the intensity units , which represent numbers of photons , were converted to grey scale units by multiplying by the quantum efficiency and by the gain factors of the ccd , and dividing by the photo - electron / adu conversion factor provided in the camera manual @xcite .",
    "these values could then be directly converted to integers , that represent grey scale levels in the camera s dynamic range ( 16 bit ) .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio was calculated as the mean pixel value above background of the diffraction - limited spot divided by the standard deviation of the background pixel levels .",
    "the mean signal level @xmath100 , mean background level @xmath101 , and variance @xmath102 were calculated in terms of numbers of photons , and the signal - to - noise ratio is expressed as a decibel quantity , @xmath103",
    "the localization error is not a monotonic function of the point - to - point separation .",
    "as the displacement decreases below @xmath104 , there is a large increase in the localization error . at some separation below @xmath104 ,",
    "the error decreases , and then upon further reduction in separation rapidly diverges as the two features become difficult to distinguish . in order to examine this effect more closely , the measured point - to - point separation",
    "was compared to the true point - to - point separation . in figure",
    "[ fig : img_sim : msep_vs_asep ] .     is @xmath105 db.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    we determined that the initial increase in error , at @xmath106 - 9 pixels separation , is due to a systematic over - estimation of the point - to - point separation .",
    "the overlap between the intensity distributions forces the least - squares fitting routine to localize the centroid of each intensity distribution away from the overlap region , resulting in overestimation of the point - to - point separation . as overlap increases ,",
    "the centroids of each feature are forced back towards the overlap region , initially decreasing the estimated separation , until significant overlap has occurred , at @xmath107 pixels , and the two spots are difficult to distinguish .    to investigate this behaviour of the localization error at close separations in greater detail",
    ", a simulation was performed wherein the features were localized in only one - dimension .",
    "three - dimensional images of point features were created as described above .",
    "the features were displaced from each other along the @xmath18 direction by a known amount and the @xmath19 coordinate of each point was localized by fitting each intensity distribution independently to a one - dimensional gaussian function .",
    "the centroids were displaced at fractional pixel values along the @xmath19 -axis and the integer pixel locations of the centroids were used as initial parameter estimates for the gaussian fits .",
    "the @xmath18-direction was chosen because localization of the @xmath19-coordinate has the largest error for closely spaced points . to localize features with limited spatial filtering , i.e. the extreme values of  @xmath108 and @xmath109 , the noise had to be reduced to unrealistically small values , mimicking unattainably perfect imaging conditions .",
    "for suitable comparison , the simulations in figure [ fig : img_sim:2poinintdist ] were performed with @xmath110 .    when filtering is used , it is a source of small overestimation of the separations .",
    "filtering removes high spatial frequency components from the image , predominantly noise ; however , the operation also smoothes components of the real intensity distribution that vary rapidly in space . when the distance between points is smaller than @xmath111 , the filtering operation modifies the summed intensity distribution of the two features such that the distance between the two is overestimated by fitting each feature independently to a gaussian function .",
    "the origin of the behavior of the localization error for features that are closely spaced is verified upon examining the effect of the band - pass filter .    at some separation close to @xmath112 ,",
    "the effect of filtering in the overlap region becomes negligible compared to the effect of the overlap itself . at this separation",
    "the measured separation agrees with the actual separation again ( fig .",
    "[ fig : img_sim : msep_vs_asep ] ) . at these and",
    "smaller separations , the measured separation begins to systematically diverge from the actual separation , due to overlap of the feature psf s .",
    "plots of the intensity distributions before and after filtering for two different spacings are shown in figure [ fig : img_sim:2poinintdist ] .",
    "propagation of localization error in the separation of two points was studied in order to determine its role , if any , in the observable @xmath36 , the spindle pole - pole separation .",
    "the error for any arbitrary quantity @xmath113 that has been calculated from the set of coordinates for both features @xmath114 can be estimated by propagating the errors associated with each of the coordinates . for notational simplicity ,",
    "the coordinates representing the positions of each of the features are written as the set @xmath115 , where @xmath116 .",
    "the errors for all the coordinates are written generally as @xmath117 , and the covariance terms @xmath118 are given by @xmath119 .",
    "the set of values @xmath120 is the set of most probable estimates of the true coordinates , which is exactly known for the simulations .",
    "frequently when uncertainties are estimated , the covariant terms are assumed negligible . however , for parameters obtained from fitting a curve to data , the covariant terms can contribute significantly to uncertainties @xcite .",
    "the appropriate relation for estimation of uncertainty in @xmath121 is : @xmath122 the error in point - to - point distance can be determined directly during a simulation by comparing the real separation with the measured separation .",
    "this error can also be determined from the uncertainties of each coordinate via equation [ eq : errorprop ] , since @xmath123 . to test this ,",
    "a simulation was performed with the displacement vector between the points oriented in an arbitrary direction in @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 , and the error in @xmath124 determined over a range of separations .",
    "the results of this simulation are displayed in figure [ fig : img_sim : errorpropcompare ] .    .",
    "@xmath125 for this simulation is 10.5 db.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    it can be seen that for large separations , in our case for @xmath126 , the covariant terms are negligible . as the two features approach one another to within less than @xmath127 , the covariant terms become significant and they must be included for an accurate estimate of the error . by simulating point - to - point separation trajectories for each of the directions in the set @xmath128 the form of all @xmath117 ,",
    "can be obtained .",
    "using this relation for @xmath129 , the errors for all quantities determined from feature finding can be estimated .",
    "chromatic shift was measured and corrected for prior to combining results obtained using two different wavelengths . the chromatic shift in @xmath2 , @xmath78 , and @xmath19 between the gfp and red acquisition channels",
    "was determined by imaging approximately @xmath130 @xmath131-diameter inspeck beads ( invitrogen ) immobilized on a poly - k - coated cover glass .",
    "the intensity distribution of each of the beads in a field - of - view was fit to a three - dimensional gaussian function to find the centroid of every bead in each channel .",
    "gfp- and red - channel centroid positions were then compared for each of the immobilized beads to determine the chromatic shift between the excitation channels , averaged across all the beads .",

    "<S> current imaging studies of subcellular , or subnuclear , dynamics of localized features of interest in small bounding volumes , for example in the important model organism budding yeast , the eukaryotic nucleus , or er / golgi bodies , suffer from important limitations . </S>",
    "<S> first , dynamics single features such as a chromosome locus position are often described only by position , without contextual information  @xcite , subjecting the extracted features to translational , rotational , or vibrational noise , and to lack of knowledge of position in the cell s cycle . </S>",
    "<S> features that are free to move in three - dimensional ( 3d ) space are often either detected in two dimensions ( 2d )  @xcite , or in 3d without subpixel resolution in 3d , allowing out - of - plane motion to be ascribed to in - plane motion . in many other studies , </S>",
    "<S> contextual information is used , for example relative positions of two spots such as in the spindle pole bodies ( spbs ) , but without subpixel resolution in 3d  @xcite , so that the uncertainty in the measurement is insufficiently small to enable new and valuable dynamical information at tens of nanometers scale to be uncovered . </S>",
    "<S> there are however important exceptions to these limitations  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> finally , in many reports cell volume is extracted by measuring an area and extrapolating to volume by assuming the cell has some regular azimuthal symmetry  @xcite , which it may not have . in various micropipette aspiration studies to determine mechanical behavior , the cell has been either considered as a fully incompressible material ( with true 3d volume unmonitored during deformation )  @xcite , or has been assumed compressible without any emphasis on its importance  @xcite . yet , a number of cell types have already been shown to be compressible  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> cell compressibility may prove to be more general  @xcite . on account of these limitations , changes in cell volume due to deformation and other perturbations may be strongly underappreciated . </S>",
    "<S> commercial software solutions exist for extracting volume using isosurface methods on a continuous mass distribution and have been applied to cells  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> isosurface methods are notoriously sensitive to the threshold chosen . </S>",
    "<S> there is a need for methods of reconstructing cell or small subcellular volumes surface that are relatively insensitive to thresholding , and that are robust to challenging conditions of local regions of high curvature .    </S>",
    "<S> clearly , additional , and more flexible and accessible , high - accuracy computational imaging tools for point and bounded surface features are needed . </S>",
    "<S> such methods would not only enable direct volume measurements in combination with feature tracking of localized entities , but would facilitate accurate monitoring of cell volume under nonlinear deformation of cells , and open up new avenues distinguishing between compressibility and viscoelastic bulk relaxation / fluid flow in the nonlinear deformation behavior of cells . </S>",
    "<S> here we describe a hybrid computational imaging technique that overcomes these obstacles and generates high resolution tracking of nanoscale to organelle - sized spots in living cells at identifiable locations within the cell , together with bounding surfaces , from hundreds of cells . </S>",
    "<S> the watertight bounding surface is obtained using computational geometry techniques and enables monitoring of the volumes of dividing cells and the orientation of the virtual plane separating them . </S>",
    "<S> the features can then be transformed to a new co - ordinate system unique to each cell if desired . </S>",
    "<S> these methods allow for accurate dissection of yeast mitosis or chromosome locus motions in their precise cellular context _ in vivo_. besides automated high - resolution , high - throughput image and data analysis , our technique also makes possible the extraction of new phenotypic metrics by which cell - to - cell heterogeneity across populations can by quantified  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> much cellular motion is stochastic and must be assessed statistically from large populations . </S>",
    "<S> the ability to calculate volumes and shapes in situations of low sampling of surface points is likely to become more important as more sophisticated models are developed for how the interior of the cell and nucleus are organized .    here </S>",
    "<S> , we use these methods to demonstrate nanometer - scale measurements of directed motions or fluctuations of the eukaryotic mitotic spindle , using relative motion to unambiguously identify cells in different stages of cell division ; additionally , to demonstrate measurements of cell volume of individual small biological cells . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the resolution of the point feature finding in our optical system , for which we perform simulations of model spindle poles under similar image detection conditions to what is expected in the living cell , is @xmath0 in 3d , depending on the specific signal - to - noise in the acquired images . </S>",
