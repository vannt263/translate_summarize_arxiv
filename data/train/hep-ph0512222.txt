    "many of the unsolved problems in particle physics have their origin in the fact that we do not yet fully understand the properties of matter . in flavor physics , we study aspects of matter connected with the observation that its fundamental constituents ( quarks and leptons ) come in replications known as generations . there exist some big , open questions in flavor physics , to which we would love to find some answers .",

    "all quarks carry the same color charge . in almost all respects",
    "the fermions belonging to different generations are equal  but not quite , since their masses are different . today",
    ", we understand very little about the underlying dynamics responsible for the phenomenon of generations",
    ". why do generations exist ?",
    "why are there three of them",
    "? why are the hierarchies of the fermion masses and mixing angles the way they are ?",
    "why are these hierarchies different for quarks and leptons ?",
    "we have good reasons to expect that the answers to these questions , if they can be found in the foreseeable future , will open the doors to some great discoveries , such as new symmetries , new forces , new dimensions , or something we have not yet thought about .",

    "+ + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    the existential question about the origin of the matter - antimatter asymmetry provides a link between particle physics and the evolution of the universe .",
    "the standard model satisfies the prerequisites for baryogenesis as spelled out in the sakharov criteria : baryon - number violating processes are unsuppressed at high temperature ; cp - violating interactions are present due to complex couplings in the quark ( and presumably , the lepton ) sector ; non - equilibrium processes can occur during phase transitions driven by the expansion of the universe .",
    "however , quantitatively the observed matter abundance can not be explained in the standard model ( by many orders of magnitude ) .",
    "additional contributions , either due to new cp - violating phases or new mechanisms of cp violation , are required .",

    "virtually any extension of the standard model that can solve the gauge hierarchy problem ( i.e. , the fact that the electroweak scale is so much lower than the gut scale ) naturally contains a plethora of new flavor parameters .",
    "some prominent examples are :    * supersymmetry : hundreds of flavor- and/or cp - violating couplings , even in the mssm and its next - to - minimal variants * extra dimensions : flavor parameters of kaluza - klein states * technicolor : flavor couplings of techni - fermions * multi - higgs models : cp - violating higgs couplings * little higgs models : flavor couplings of new gauge bosons ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 ) and fermions ( @xmath3 )    if new physics exists at or below the tev scale , its effects should show up , at some level of precision , in flavor physics .",
    "flavor- and/or cp - violating interactions can only be studied using precision measurements at highest luminosity . in the future",
    ", such studies will profit from the fact that the relevant mass scales will ( hopefully ) be known from the lhc .    to drive this last point home ,",
    "let me recall some lessons from the past .",
    "top quarks have been discovered through direct production at the tevatron . in that way , their mass , spin , and color charge have been determined .",
    "accurate predictions for the mass were available before , based on electroweak precision measurements at the @xmath4 pole , but also based on studies of @xmath5 mesons .",
    "the rates for @xmath5@xmath6 mixing , as well as for rare flavor - changing neutral current ( fcnc ) processes such as @xmath7 , are very sensitive to the value of the top - quark mass . more importantly , everything else we know about the top quark , such as its generation - changing couplings @xmath8 and @xmath9 , as well as its cp - violating interactions ( @xmath10 with the standard choice of phase conventions ) , has come from studies of kaon and @xmath5 physics .",
    "next , recall the example of neutrino oscillations .",
    "the existence of neutrinos has been known for a long time , but it was the discovery of their flavor - changing interactions ( neutrino oscillations ) that has revolutionized our thinking about the lepton sector .",
    "we have learned that the hierarchy of the leptonic mixing matrix is very different from that of the quark mixing matrix , and we have discovered that leptogenesis and cp violation in the lepton sector may provide an alternative mechanism for baryogenesis .",
    "exploring flavor aspects of the new physics , whatever it may be , is therefore not an exercise meant to fill the particle data book .",
    "rather , it is of crucial relevance to answer some profound , deep questions about nature . some questions for which we have a realistic chance of finding an answer with the help of a second - generation @xmath5-factory are :    *",
    "do non - standard cp phases exist ?",
    "if so , this may provide new clues about baryogenesis .",
    "* is the electroweak symmetry - breaking sector flavor blind ( minimal flavor violation ) ? * is the supersymmetry - breaking sector flavor blind ?",
    "* do right - handed currents exist ? this may provide clues about new gauge interactions and symmetries ( left - right symmetry ) at very high energy .",
    "the interpretation of new physics signals at present or future @xmath5-factories can be tricky .",
    "but since it is our hope to answer some important questions , we must try as hard as we can .",
    "flavor physics will thus remain a valuable component in the comprehensive exploration of the tev scale .",
    "it is a shame that this vital part of physics is currently being terminated in the u.s .      at first sight ,",
    "the presence of generations , i.e.  the replication ( triplication ) of the fundamental fermions , makes the standard model more ugly than it needed to be .",
    "the fermion masses and mixings constitute many of the parameters of the standard model lagrangian . unlike the parameters in the gauge sector , these masses and mixings exhibit strongly hierarchical patterns .",
    "importantly , fermions of different generations can communicate via flavor - changing weak interactions .",
    "indeed , these are the _ only _ flavor - changing ( i.e. , generation - nondiagonal ) interactions in the standard model .",
    "one of the main goals of the present @xmath5 factories ",
    "one that has been achieved in a spectacular way !  is the precise determination of the parameters of the quark mixing matrix ( the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa matrix ) .",
    "interestingly , the presence of at least three fermion generations allows for cp violation to occur in flavor - changing weak decays , which is one of the prerequisites for an explanation of the matter - antimatter asymmetry observed in the universe .",
    "( yet , as mentioned above , while baryogenesis is thus possible in the standard model , it has not been possible to explain the observed baryon asymmetry quantitatively . )",
    "modern ckm physics is often described with the help of the unitarity - triangle relation @xmath11 which contains the two smallest entries in the matrix , @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "measuring the parameters of the unitarity triangle serves two purposes : first , to determine some fundamental parameters of the standard model , and secondly , to test whether the ckm mechanism of flavor and cp violation is indeed correct , or whether there are hints of deviations from the standard model .",
    "by now , there is a plethora of ways in which the sides and angles of the unitarity triangle have been constrained ( see @xcite for a comprehensive review ) . until now",
    "no significant deviations from the ckm mechanism have been established . in particular , measurements of the sides of the triangle are consistent with measurements of the angles .",
    "also , the cp - violating phase of @xmath14 , which is probed in particle - antiparticle mixing , is consistent with the phase of @xmath15 , which is probed in rare exclusive @xmath5-meson decays .    developing theoretical methods for a systematic analysis of exclusive hadronic decays such as",
    "@xmath16 has been one of the greatest challenges to heavy - flavor theory . in the remaining lectures",
    ", i will discuss some of the theoretical concepts relevant in this context .",
    "exclusive hadronic decays also feature prominently in searches for new physics at the @xmath5 factories , and indeed there exist some hints ( not more ) for possible deviations from the standard model in the measurements of cp asymmetries in some loop - dominated processes such as @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "if confirmed , this could point toward the existence of some new fcnc transitions , which can effectively compete with standard model loop amplitudes .",
    "this would be the first signal we have for new tev - scale physics , and it should provide enough motivation for you to follow the rest of these lectures .",
    "effective field theory ( eft ) is a very powerful tool in quantum field theory @xcite .",
    "it provides a systematic formalism for the analysis of multi - scale problems .",
    "this is particularly important in qcd , where the value of the running coupling @xmath19 can change significantly between different energy scales . as such",
    ", eft greatly simplifies practical calculations in field theory ; indeed , it often makes such calculations feasible .",
    "as we will discuss , eft also provides a new , modern meaning to `` renormalization '' .    the main idea of eft",
    "is simply stated : consider a quantum field theory with a large , fundamental scale @xmath20 .",
    "this could be the mass of a heavy particle , or some large ( euclidean ) momentum transfer .",
    "suppose we are interested in physics at energies @xmath21 ( or momenta @xmath22 ) much smaller than @xmath20 .",
    "how can we expand scattering or decay amplitudes in powers of @xmath23 ?",
    "the answer to this question proceeds in several steps :    1 .",
    "choose a cutoff @xmath24 and divide the fields of the theory into low - frequency and high - frequency modes , @xmath25 where @xmath26 contains the fourier modes with frequency @xmath27 , while @xmath28 contains the remaining modes with frequency @xmath29 .",
    "we can think of the cutoff as a `` threshold of ignorance '' in the sense that we may pretend to know nothing about the theory for scales above @xmath30 ( which is indeed often the case ) . by construction",
    ", low - energy physics is described in terms of the @xmath26 fields .",
    "everything we ever wish to know about the theory ( feynman diagrams , scattering amplitudes , cross sections , decay rates , etc . ) can be derived from vacuum correlation functions of these fields .",
    "these correlators can be obtained using @xmath31 } \\left ( -i\\,\\frac{\\delta}{\\delta j_l(x_1 ) } \\right )      \\dots \\left ( -i\\,\\frac{\\delta}{\\delta j_l(x_n ) } \\right )     z[j_l ] \\big|_{j_l=0 } \\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath32 = \\int{\\cal d}\\phi_l\\,{\\cal d}\\phi_h\\ ,     e^{is(\\phi_l,\\phi_h ) + i\\int d^dx\\,j_l(x)\\,\\phi_l(x)}\\ ] ] is the generating functional of the theory . here",
    "@xmath33 is the action , @xmath34 is the dimension of space - time , and we have only included sources @xmath35 for the light fields , as this suffices to compute the correlation functions in ( [ correl ] ) .",
    "2 .   in the next step ,",
    "we perform the path integral over the high - frequency fields .",
    "this yields @xmath32\\equiv \\int{\\cal d}\\phi_l\\ ,     e^{is_\\lambda(\\phi_l ) + i\\int d^dx\\,j_l(x)\\,\\phi_l(x ) } \\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath36 is called the `` wilsonian effective action '' .",
    "note that , by construction , this action depends on the choice of the cutoff @xmath30 used to define the split between low- and high - frequency modes .",
    "@xmath37 is non - local on scales @xmath38 , because high - frequency fluctuations have been removed from the theory .",
    "the process of removing these modes is often referred to as `` integrating out '' the high - frequency fields in the functional integral .",
    "3 .   in the final step ,",
    "we expand the non - local action functional in terms of local operators composed of light fields .",
    "this process is called the ( wilsonian ) operator - product expansion ( ope ) .",
    "this expansion is possible because @xmath39 by assumption .",
    "the result can be cast in the form @xmath40 where @xmath41 this object is called the `` effective lagrangian '' .",
    "it is an infinite sum over local operators @xmath42 multiplied by coupling constants @xmath43 , which are referred to as wilson coefficients . in general , all operators allowed by the symmetries of the theory are generated in the construction of the effective lagrangian and appear in this sum .",
    "since there is always an infinite number of such operators , the question arises : how can the effective low - energy theory be predictive ?",
    "this is where the simple , but powerful trick of `` naive dimensional analysis '' comes to play . as is common practice in high - energy physics , let us work in units where @xmath44",
    ". then @xmath45=[e]=[p]=[x^{-1}]=[t^{-1}]$ ] are all measured in the same units .",
    "we denote by @xmath46=-\\gamma_i$ ] the mass dimension of the effective couplings @xmath43 .",
    "it follows that @xmath47 with dimensionless coefficients @xmath48 .",
    "since by assumption there is only a single fundamental scale @xmath20 in the theory , we expect that @xmath49 .",
    "this assertion is known as the hypothesis of `` naturalness '' . unless there is a specific mechanism that could explain the smallness of the dimensionless numbers @xmath48 , we should assume those numbers to be of @xmath50 .",
    "the presence of unusually large ( e.g.  @xmath51 ) or small ( e.g.  @xmath52 ) numbers in a theory would appear `` unnatural '' and call for further explanation .    at low energy ( @xmath53 ) ,",
    "the contribution of a given operator @xmath42 in the effective lagrangian to an observable ( which for simplicity we assume to be dimensionless ) is expected to scale as @xmath54 it follows that only operators whose couplings have @xmath55 are important at low energy .",
    "this very fact is what makes the ope a useful tool .",
    "depending on the precision goal , one may truncate the series in ( [ ope ] ) at a given order in @xmath23 .",
    "once this is done , only a finite ( often small ) number of operators @xmath42 and couplings @xmath43 need to be retained .",
    "let us go through the above arguments once again , being slightly more careful .",
    "assuming weak coupling , , as we will see later .",
    "for this reason , the @xmath56 are referred to as `` anomalous dimensions '' .",
    "] we can use the free action to assign a scaling behavior with @xmath21 to all fields and couplings in the low - energy effective theory . consider scalar @xmath57 theory as an example .",
    "the action is @xmath58 using that @xmath59 and @xmath60 , and requiring that the action scale like @xmath50 ( in units of @xmath61 ) , we see that @xmath62 . if we denote by @xmath63 the mass dimension of an operator @xmath42 , then @xmath64 . for the operators in the lagrangian ( [ phi4 ] ) we find :    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the lo approximation is really only good for illustration purposes . at nlo",
    "we achieve the same accuracy as in the case of a conventional one - loop calculation for a single - scale problem .",
    "note , however , that two - loop anomalous dimensions are required at this order .",
    "the nnlo approximation is the state of the art for many applications , where high precision is of concern .",
    "heavy - quark systems provide prime examples for applications of the eft technology , because the hierarchy @xmath65 provides a natural separation of scales .",
    "physics at the scale @xmath66 is of a short - distance nature , while for heavy - quark systems there is always also some hadronic physics governed by the confinement scale @xmath67 . being able to separate",
    "the short - distance and long - distance effects associated with these two scales is vital for any quantitative description in heavy - quark physics .",
    "for instance , if the long - distance hadronic matrix elements are obtained from lattice qcd , then it is necessary to analytically compute the short - distance effects , which come from short - wavelength modes that do not fit on present - day lattices . in many other instances ,",
    "the long - distance hadronic physics can be encoded in a small number of universal parameters .",
    "to identify these parameters requires that one first extracts all short - distance effects .",
    "the simplest effective theory for heavy - quark systems is heavy - quark effective theory ( hqet ) @xcite .",
    "it provides a simplified description of the soft interactions of a single heavy quark interacting with soft , light partons .",
    "this includes the interactions that bind the heavy quark with other light partons inside heavy mesons ( @xmath5 , @xmath68 ,  ) and baryons ( @xmath69 , @xmath70 ,  ) .",
    "i will only offer an hqet primer in this lecture , referring to reviews in the literature for a more detailed discussion @xcite .",
    "a softly interacting heavy quark is nearly on - shell .",
    "its momentum may be decomposed as @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the 4-velocity of the hadron containing the heavy quark ( @xmath73 ) , and the `` residual momentum '' @xmath74 .",
    "this off - shell momentum results from the soft interactions of the heavy quark with its environment .",
    "( this assumes a reference frame in which the heavy meson has a small velocity , @xmath75 .",
    ") a near on - shell dirac spinor has two large and two small components .",
    "we define @xmath76 , \\ ] ] where @xmath77 are the large , `` upper '' components , while @xmath78 are the small , `` lower '' components .",
    "the extraction of the phase factor in ( [ hdef ] ) implies that the fields @xmath79 and @xmath80 carry the residual momentum @xmath81 .",
    "these fields obey the projection relations @xmath82 inserting these definitions into the dirac lagrangian yields @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the `` spatial '' covariant derivative ( note that @xmath85 in the heavy - hadron rest frame ) .",
    "we have used that between two @xmath79 spinors a dirac matrix @xmath86 can be replaced with @xmath87 , while between two @xmath80 spinors it can be replaced with @xmath88 .",
    "we have also used the projection properties ( [ project ] ) , which in particular imply that @xmath89 .",
    "the interpretation of ( [ lq ] ) is that the field @xmath79 describes a massless fermion , while @xmath80 describes a heavy fermion with mass @xmath90 .",
    "both modes are coupled to each other via the last two terms .",
    "soft interactions can not excite the heavy fermion , so we integrate it out from the generating functional of the theory . the light field which remains",
    "describes the fluctuations of the heavy quark about its mass shell . solving the classical equation of motion for the field @xmath80 yields @xmath91 which implies @xmath92 provided the residual momenta are small .",
    "the leading - order effective lagrangian obtained from ( [ lq ] ) then reads @xmath93 note that the covariant derivative @xmath94 contains only the soft gluon field .",
    "hard gluons have been integrated out .",
    "it is straightforward to include power corrections to the effective lagrangian by keeping higher - order terms in ( [ hv ] ) .",
    "one finds that at subleading order in @xmath95 two new operators arise , such that @xmath96 + \\dots \\,.\\ ] ] the new operators are referred to ask the `` kinetic energy '' and the `` chromo - magnetic interaction '' .",
    "the kinetic - energy operator corresponds to the first correction term in the taylor expansion of the relativistic energy @xmath97 , and lorentz invariance ensures that its coefficient is not renormalized .",
    "the wilson coefficient of the chromo - magnetic interaction operators is , however , non - trivial .",
    "it has been calculated in @xcite at nlo in rg - improved perturbation theory .",
    "the leading term in the hqet lagrangian exhibits a su(2@xmath98 ) spin - flavor symmetry .",
    "its physical meaning is that , in the infinite mass limit , the properties of hadronic systems containing a single heavy quark are insensitive to the spin and flavor of the heavy quark @xcite .",
    "the flavor symmetry is broken by the operators arising at order @xmath95 and higher .",
    "note , however , that at this order only the chromo - magnetic operator breaks the spin symmetry .",
    "many phenomenological implications of heavy - quark symmetry are explored in @xcite .",
    "it is useful to set up a systematic power counting in @xmath99 by assigning scaling properties for all objects in the effective theory . to do this ,",
    "all dimensionful quantities are expressed in powers of the fundamental scale @xmath100 .",
    "for the residual momentum we find @xmath101 .",
    "all derivatives on the soft fields in hqet obey the same scaling as the residual momentum , i.e.@xmath102 .",
    "the scaling property of the heavy - quark field @xmath79 follows by considering the free quark propagator in position space .",
    "we have @xmath103 from which it follows that @xmath104 . for the soft gluon field , a similar consideration shows that @xmath105     \\sim \\lambda^4\\cdot\\frac{1}{\\lambda^2}\\sim \\lambda^2 \\,,\\ ] ] and hence @xmath106 .",
    "note that this ensures a homogeneous scaling of the covariant derivative , @xmath107 . using these relations",
    ", we see that the different terms in the hqet lagrangian in ( [ lhqet2 ] ) scale like @xmath108 the scaling of the integration measure @xmath109 for operators containing soft fields follows from the requirement that @xmath110 , since this defines what are `` important contributions '' to fourier integrals .",
    "we conclude that @xmath111 , @xmath112 , and hence @xmath113 as it should be .",
    "the effective lagrangian @xmath114 defines an effective theory for soft interactions of heavy quarks .",
    "all hard interactions ( including the couplings of heavy quarks to hard gluons ) are integrated out in the construction of the effective lagrangian . as a result",
    ", the effective theory no longer has the full gauge invariance of qcd , but only a residual gauge invariance with respect to gauge transformations that preserve the scaling properties of the fields .",

    ", however , the use of dimensional regularization makes it unnecessary to introduce the hard cutoffs associated with this construction .",
    "the couplings of soft gluons to heavy quarks can be `` removed '' by the ( non - local , field - dependent ) field redefinition @xmath118 with @xmath119 a time - like wilson line extending from minus infinity to the point @xmath120 .",

    "the wilson line @xmath123 is given by a similar expression but with the opposite ordering prescription , and with @xmath124 replaced by @xmath125 in the exponent .",
    "the soft wilson line obeys the important property @xmath126 using this relation , it follows that in terms of the new fields the hqet lagrangian becomes @xmath127 at leading order in @xmath95 , this is a free theory as far as the strong interactions of heavy quarks are concerned ! however , the theory is nevertheless non - trivial once we allow for the presence of external sources .",
    "consider , e.g. , what happens to a flavor - changing weak - interaction current , which turns a heavy @xmath128-quark into a @xmath129-quark ( plus a @xmath130 boson ) . at tree level , matching such a current onto hqet gives @xmath131 here @xmath72 and @xmath132 are the ( in general different ) velocities of the heavy mesons containing the heavy quarks . unless the two velocities are equal , the object @xmath133 is non - trivial , and hence the soft gluons do not decouple from the heavy quarks inside the current operator . indeed ,",
    "if we close the integration contour at @xmath134 we may interpret @xmath133 as a wilson loop with a cusp at the point @xmath120 , where the two paths parallel to the different velocity vectors intersect .",
    "the presence of the cusp leads to non - trivial uv behavior ( for @xmath135 ) , which is described by a cusp anomalous dimension @xmath136 depending on the kinematical invariant @xmath137 .",
    "this quantity was calculated at two - loop order as early as in 1987 @xcite .",
    "the cusp anomalous dimension is nothing but the celebrated velocity - dependent anomalous dimension of heavy - quark currents , which was rediscovered three years later in the context of hqet @xcite .",
    "the technology introduced in the last three subsections is usually not taught in courses on hqet , and indeed it is not required necessarily .",
    "however , the interpretation of heavy quarks as wilson lines is very useful , and it was put forward in some of the very first papers on the subject @xcite .",
    "i have emphasized this technology here , because it will be useful in the study of the interactions of heavy quarks with collinear degrees of freedom , to which we turn now .",
    "an long - standing problem in qcd is how to systematically parameterize long - distance effects ( power corrections ) for processes that do not admit a local ope . in problems with a large mass @xmath20 or a large euclidean momentum transfer @xmath138",

    "in other words , @xmath156 points in the direction of the collinear momenta , and @xmath157 points in the opposite direction . for an arbitrary 4-vector @xmath139 , we write @xmath162 where i have introduced several useful notations in the second line .",
    "let us perform the light - cone decomposition for the relevant momenta in the two examples discussed above . for @xmath7 decay",

    "for the example of @xmath16 decay , we have @xmath166 and hence @xmath167 and @xmath168 .",
    "we now distinguish between different types of momenta , classified according to their scaling properties with the large energy @xmath169 .",
    "for the example of @xmath7 decay , the relevant momenta are ( with @xmath170 ) : @xmath171 the corresponding virtualities are @xmath172 , @xmath173 , and @xmath174 .",
    "the partons of the final - state hadronic jet typically carry hard - collinear momenta , however , the jet may also contain some partons with soft momenta .",
    "the effective theory results from integrating out all fields carrying hard momenta , keeping fields with hard - collinear or soft momenta as dynamical degrees of freedom .",
    "in exclusive processes such as @xmath16 one also encounters particles with collinear momenta , whose virtualities are @xmath175 .",
    "the corresponding scaling relations are : @xmath176 while this looks similar to the scaling relation for a hard - collinear momentum , just with @xmath177 replaced by @xmath178 , the difference is that the same replacement is _ not _ done for the soft fields .",
    "hence , in a situation where both soft and collinear fields are present , integrating out hard modes results in a different eft than the one mentioned above .",
    "it is conventional to call the eft for soft and hard - collinear fields scet-1 , and that for soft and collinear fields scet-2 . in the latter case",
    ", the theory also contains so - called messenger modes with momentum scaling @xmath179 .",
    "we will not discuss the many subtleties of scet-2 here but refer the interested reader to the literature @xcite .",
    "from now on we study the theory scet-1 in further detail , calling it scet for simplicity .    as mentioned above , after integrating out hard modes ( i.e. , modes carrying hard momenta ) we obtain an eft for soft and hard - collinear fields .",
    "the momentum scalings in ( [ scet1scale ] ) allow for interactions among these modes subject to the constraint that interactions among hard - collinear and soft fields are only allowed if the soft fields couple to at least two hard - collinear fields .",
    "the reason is that , when we couple one or more soft fields to a hard - collinear field , the resulting total momentum scales like a hard - collinear momentum : @xmath180 .",
    "momentum conservation then implies that there is another hard - collinear particle that can absorb this momentum .",
    "let us now introduce the various fields of scet obtained by decomposing the quark and gluon fields into various momentum modes .",
    "the soft fields and their scalings are the same as in hqet : @xmath181 next , we introduce the following hard - collinear fields : @xmath182 there are no hard - collinear heavy - quark fields , since the corresponding virtualities would be hard , @xmath183 , and so these fields have already been removed from the effective theory .",
    "note that the scaling of the hard - collinear gluons is such that the covariant derivative @xmath184 has a homogeneous scaling when acting on hard - collinear fields .    as in the case of hqet ,",
    "the scaling properties of the hard - collinear fields can be derived most easily by analyzing the corresponding two - point functions @xcite . for the gluon propagator",

    "( this mistake has been made in the literature . )",
    "let us now discuss the hard - collinear fermion field . for simplicity we will assume zero mass from now on , even though it would be straightforward to include a mass term of @xmath191 or smaller in the effective lagrangian .",
    "we decompose the 4-component dirac spinor field into two fields @xmath192 using that @xmath193 it is easy to see that @xmath194 and @xmath195 are projection operators onto these two 2-component spinors , such that @xmath196 consider now the two - point function @xmath197 projecting onto the various components , we find @xmath198 obviously , this implies @xmath199 and @xmath200 .",
    "it follows that a hard - collinear fermion spinor has two `` large '' and two `` small '' components .",
    "the small - component field @xmath201 can be integrated out from the theory , leaving @xmath202 as the field describing hard - collinear fermions in scet . like the soft heavy quarks in hqet ,",
    "hard - collinear quarks in scet are thus described by effective 2-component fields .",
    "let us first derive how hard - collinear quarks interact with hard - collinear or soft gluons , following closely the derivation presented in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "when expressed in terms of @xmath202 and @xmath201 , the dirac lagrangian becomes @xmath203 here the covariant derivative @xmath34 still contains both the soft and the hard - collinear gluon fields .",
    "we now `` integrate out '' the small - component field @xmath201 by solving its equation of motion : @xmath204 where the `` @xmath205 '' prescription is arbitrary but must be fixed once and forever .",
    "note that the result is highly non - local , involving an inverse differential operator acting on the hard - collinear quark field .",
    "it is instructive to compare this solution with the corresponding expression ( [ hv ] ) for the `` small '' components of the heavy - quark field in hqet . in this case , the result was `` almost local '' in that the derivative in the denominator produces a power of the residual momentum @xmath206 , which is much smaller than @xmath90 .",
    "it was therefore possible to expand the expression ( [ hv ] ) in an infinite series of local operators , and this produced the terms in the ( local ) hqet lagrangian . in the case of scet",
    "such a local expansion is not possible . in order to proceed ,",
    "it is useful to introduce the wilson line @xmath207 where @xmath208 still contains both soft and hard - collinear gluons .",
    "the ordering prescription is the same as in ( [ sdef ] ) . in analogy with ( [ srule ] ) , this object obeys the relations @xmath209 this allows us to turn the inverse covariant derivative in ( [ eta ] ) into an ordinary inverse derivative , i.e. , an integral .",
    "the result is @xmath210 inserting this into ( [ lstep1 ] ) yields the non - local effective lagrangian @xmath211    at this stage our job is almost done .",
    "the remaining problem we need to deal with is that the above expression does not yet respect a proper power counting , since terms of different orders in @xmath177 are mixed up . in order to avoid double counting , it is imperative to expand all objects in the effective lagrangian such that the power counting is consistent .",
    "for instance , the different components of the covariant derivative acting on hard - collinear fields scale like @xmath212 while for @xmath213 all three contributions are of order @xmath177 , for @xmath214 and @xmath215 the contributions involving the soft gluon field are power suppressed and should be neglected at leading order .",
    "likewise , in the definition of the wilson line @xmath130 in ( [ firstw ] ) the contribution of the soft gluon field in the exponent is power suppressed and should be neglected .",
    "it follows that @xmath216 , where @xmath217 finally , in interactions with hard - collinear fields , soft fields must be multi - pole expanded in order to ensure a proper power counting @xcite . to see why ,",
    "consider as an example the phase factor associated with the coupling of a hard - collinear field ( incoming momentum @xmath218 ) to a soft field ( incoming momentum @xmath219 ) , producing a hard - collinear field ( outgoing momentum @xmath220 ) : @xmath221 the combined momentum in the exponent scales like a hard - collinear momentum , since @xmath222 .",
    "consequently , @xmath50 contributions to the action arise if @xmath223 .",
    "however , in this case the phase factor involving the soft momentum can be taylor expanded : @xmath224 where the terms inside the bracket scale like 1 , @xmath225 , and @xmath177 , respectively .",
    "it follows that in interactions with hard - collinear fields we should expand soft fields as @xmath226 it is understood that the derivatives are evaluated before setting @xmath227 in the argument of the field @xmath228 . at leading order , only the first term on the right - hand side contributes .    with all this insight",
    ", we are now prepared to write down the leading - power terms in the scet lagrangian .",
    "the result is @xmath229 it is easy to check that each term in this lagrangian scales like @xmath178 , which when integrated with the measure @xmath230 gives a leading , @xmath50 contribution to the action .",
    "it is in principle straightforward to work out the higher - order corrections to the effective lagrangian , but i will spare you the rather lengthy details and instead refer to the literature @xcite .    at leading order in power counting , there are no terms in the scet lagrangian containing interactions of soft quark fields with hard - collinear fields .",
    "there are , however , interactions among soft and hard - collinear gluons .",
    "their explicit form at leading and subleading power can be found in @xcite . from the scet lagrangian",
    ", one can derive feynman rules for soft and hard - collinear fields in the usual way @xcite . while these rules are more complicated that in hqet or even in full qcd , they nevertheless allow for a straightforward calculation of feynman diagrams in scet .",
    "the effective lagrangian of scet ( including power corrections ) is invariant , order by order in @xmath177 , under a set of residual hard - collinear and soft gauge transformations , @xmath231 and @xmath232 , that preserve the scaling properties of the various fields @xcite . in analogy with ( [ residualgauge ] )",

    "as before , `` soft '' and `` hard - collinear '' functions like @xmath115 and @xmath235 can be defined via a restriction to soft and hard - collinear modes in their fourier decompositions , respectively .      at leading order in @xmath177 , soft gluons couple to hard - collinear fields only via interactions involving @xmath236 .",
    "the reason is simply that this is the only component of the soft gluon field which scales in the same way as the corresponding component of the hard - collinear gluon field . in analogy with our discussion for hqet",

    "relation ( [ qcdf ] ) is a beautiful example of a qcd factorization formula .",
    "the technology of scet and hqet , and of eft in general , have made the derivation of such factorization statements a bit more straightforward then it was previously .",
    "similar relations can be established for many other processes in @xmath5 physics @xcite and elsewhere ( e.g. , in dis and jet physics @xcite ) . in many cases factorization",
    "is a property of the amplitude in the large - energy limit , but non - factorizable corrections arise at subleading order in the power expansion .",

    "<S> these notes are based on five lectures presented at the 2004 theoretical advanced study institute ( tasi ) on _ `` physics in @xmath0''_. after a brief motivation of flavor physics , they provide a pedagogical introduction to effective field theory , the effective weak lagrangian , and the technology of renormalization - group improved perturbation theory . </S>",
    "<S> these general methods are then applied in the context of heavy - quarks physics , introducing the concepts of heavy - quark and soft - collinear effective theory .    </S>",
