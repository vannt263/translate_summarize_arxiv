    "one of the prime motivations for a high - energy and high - luminosity @xmath7 linear collider is the possibility to do precision measurements of new particles beyond the standard model .",
    "the lightest of these new particles is often stable by virtue of a new discrete symmetry and hence a candidate for the dark matter ( dm ) of the universe .",
    "one therefore hopes to be able to precisely determine the properties of the dm in the laboratory , and in particular to make a  collider prediction \" of its relic abundance , which can be tested against cosmological models .",
    "for such a collider prediction to be of interest , it must be as precise as the value obtained from cosmological observations .",
    "this means a precision of about 10% ( for 95% cl ) to match wmap+sdss",
    "@xcite or few percent to match expectations at the planck satellite @xcite . moreover , if the annihilation cross section of the dm candidate is known , one can also predict direct and indirect dm detection cross sections as functions of astrophysical quantities such as galactic densities , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "the possibility to make collider predictions of the cross sections for annihilation of dark matter candidates has been examined within specific supersymmetric scenarios . within the constrained minimal supersymmetric standard model ( cmssm ) , which has only a handful of free parameters",
    ", it has been shown in a case study  @xcite that the lhc could make a prediction for the dm relic density of the order of 10% , assuming the standard cosmological scenario ; the ilc could reach a precision of few percent  @xcite in several scenarios .",
    "the particular case of stau co - annihilation in the cmssm was investigated for the lhc in @xcite and for the ilc in @xcite with similar conclusions . in the general mssm",
    ", it was shown that the lhc might match roughly the wmap+sdss precision in a favourable scenario  @xcite while the ilc could achieve much better precision  @xcite .",
    "these conclusions , however , depend very strongly on the scenario considered ; many remain challenging for both the lhc and the ilc  @xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "moreover , the studies mentioned here mainly concentrated on a few scenarios that provide the correct amount of neutralino annihilation , consistent with the wmap+sdss range .",
    "furthermore and more importantly they assumed that cp is conserved , although cp - violating ( cpv ) phases are generic in the mssm .",
    "it is well known that cpv mssm phases can have an important effect on the neutralino annihilation cross sections  @xcite .",
    "the consequences of phases for direct and indirect detection were examined in  @xcite . in @xcite",
    ", we performed a comprehensive analysis of the impact of cp phases on the relic density of neutralino dark matter , taking into account consistently phases in all ( co-)annihilation channels , and carefully disentangling cpv effects due to modifications in the couplings from pure kinematic effects .",
    "we found variations in @xmath1 solely from modifications in the couplings of up to an order of magnitude .",
    "we concluded that the determination of the relevant couplings ( including cpv phases ! ) can be as important for the prediction of @xmath1 as precision measurements of masses , i.e.  pure sparticle spectroscopy .    in this paper",
    ", we therefore consider a particular scenario of the cpv mssm , taken from @xcite , and investigate i )  which measurements are possible at the ilc , ii )  to which precision the underlying mssm parameters and the neutralino relic density can be inferred from these measurements , and iii )  what are the implications for direct and indirect dm detection and measurements of electric dipole moments ( edms ) .",
    "our scenario has light gauginos and staus with masses below 200 gev .",
    "the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) is the lightest neutralino with a mass of @xmath880 gev ; it is dominantly bino .",
    "the two staus have masses of about 100 gev and 180 gev , with a strong mixing between the left- and right - chiral states .",
    "the neutralino lsp annihilates predominantly into tau pairs , with the annihilation cross section being sensitive to the stau mixing .",
    "although the @xmath9 is very light , the scenario does not rely on coannihilation but on t - channel stau exchange .",
    "we therefore refer to it as the `` stau - bulk '' scenario .",
    "such a scenario occurs in the cp - conserving mssm only for @xmath10 .",
    "we further impose that the sfermions of the first and second generation are heavy in order to avoid the strong edm constraints .",
    "the resulting mass pattern , light staus but tev - scale selectrons and smuons , is not found in susy models where universality among scalar masses is imposed at a high scale .",
    "it is important to note that our scenario , despite having several particles below 200  gev , is quite challenging for colliders . at the lhc ,",
    "susy events are dominated by squark and gluino production followed by cascade decays leading to jets plus @xmath11 s plus @xmath12 . at the ilc , two neutralinos , the lighter chargino , and",
    "the two staus are within kinematic reach with @xmath13  gev .",
    "however , production of these sparticles again only leads to taus plus missing energy .",
    "the paper is organised as follows .",
    "section  2 describes the detailed setup of our `` stau - bulk '' scenario .",
    "expectations for ilc measurements are given in section  3 . in section  4",
    ", we present our results concerning the determination of the model parameters and the prediction for the relic density of dark matter . in section  5",
    "we then discuss cp - sensitive observables , and in section  6 additional possibilities to test and constrain the model at higher energies , through edm measurements or through direct dm detection experiments .",
    "finally , section  7 contains our conclusions .",
    "in the mssm , the parameters that can have cp phases are the gaugino and higgsino mass parameters , @xmath14 , with @xmath15 , and @xmath16 , and the trilinear sfermion - higgs couplings , @xmath17 .",
    "not all of these phases are , however , physical .",
    "the physical combinations are arg@xmath18 and arg@xmath19 .",
    "allowing for cp - violating phases , in particular non - vanishing @xmath20 , induces a mixing between the two cp - even states @xmath21 , @xmath22 and the cp - odd state @xmath23 .",
    "the resulting mass eigenstates @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) are no longer eigenstates of cp .",
    "therefore the charged higgs mass , @xmath28 , is typically used as input parameter in the cpv - mssm .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the `` stau bulk '' region of @xcite , which appears for light staus and large phase of @xmath29 .",
    "the point is the following .",
    "in the conventional case , there are mainly two mechanisms that can make a light bino - lsp annihilate efficiently enough : resonant annihilation through the light higgs , or co - annihilation with a sparticle that is close in mass in the cmssm typically the lighter stau . the so - called  bulk region \" where the lsp annihilates through t - channel exchange of very light sleptons is largely excluded by lep . for large phases of @xmath29",
    "we have found , however , that the couplings of the neutralino to staus can be sufficiently enhanced such that a new region opens up , where the @xmath30@xmath31 mass difference is too large for co - annihilation to be efficient but the lsp annihilates into taus through t - channel exchange of both @xmath9 and @xmath32 .    to define a benchmark point for such a scenario , we choose the following input parameters at the electroweak scale : @xmath33 all other parameters , i.e.  sfermion masses , @xmath34 , and @xmath28 are set to 1  tev for simplicity . this way edm constraints",
    "are avoided when varying @xmath35 and @xmath36 ; all other phases are assumed to vanish .",
    "we use cpsuperh  @xcite to compute higgs and sparticle masses and mixing angles , and  @xcite to compute the relic density , edms , and ( in)direct detection cross sections .",
    "the mixing angle in the stau sector writes @xmath37 and for our scenario is completely dominated by the @xmath38 term .",

    "the particles accessible at ilc with @xmath13  gev are @xmath30 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath9 , @xmath32 and @xmath41 .",
    "production cross sections and branching ratios are discussed in section  3 . at this stage",
    "we just note that the scenario is rather challenging to resolve experimentally because susy events involve only @xmath11 s and missing energy .    [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "having established how precisely one could measure various cp - even observables at ilc , we now estimate how this would constrain the parameters of the underlying model , and the properties of the dark matter candidate . to this aim",
    "we perform a fit to the six observables listed in table  [ tab : measurements ] assuming gaussian errors .",
    "we also compute the total @xmath42 susy cross section at @xmath43  gev with polarized beams and add it to the fit : @xmath44  pb ( for 10  fb@xmath45 ) . here",

    "the first kinematically accessible process is @xmath157 at about 700 gev , followed by @xmath158 at about 800 gev .",
    "however , the production cross sections are small , below a femtobarn , since one state is almost purely bino or wino and the other higgsino . to be precise , at @xmath159  gev one would have @xmath160  fb and @xmath161  fb , increasing to @xmath162  fb and @xmath163  fb respectively at @xmath164  tev . at @xmath165  tev",
    ", one could finally produce the heavier states in pairs , i.e.  @xmath166 , @xmath167 , etc .. the @xmath168 cross sections rises fast , giving @xmath169  fb at @xmath170  tev , while @xmath171  fb at this energy and the other cross sections much smaller . with such measurements , the complete neutralino / chargino system can in principle",
    "be reconstructed  @xcite .",
    "a detailed analysis of lhc measurements or linear collider measurements at tev energies is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "notice , however , that for a percent - level collider determination of @xmath1 , one would need to know not only @xmath49 and @xmath50 but also the cp phases ( in our case @xmath35 ) to a comparable , i.e. percent - level , precision .",
    "considering the general mssm with cp phases , we have investigated a `` stau - bulk '' scenario , in which only gauginos and staus are light and accessible to ilc measurements , while all other sparticles are heavy . in this scenario , a precise determination of susy particle properties is quite challenging at colliders because of the dominance of the channels involving taus and missing energy . combining threshold scans , endpoint methods , measurements of polarized cross section and tau polarization , the masses of the lightest neutralino , chargino and of both staus can be determined precisely at the ilc .",
    "information on the stau mixing can also be obtained .    from these measurements ,",
    "some of the underlying lagrangian parameters can be extracted with good precision : @xmath29 , @xmath48 , @xmath172 , @xmath173 .",
    "moreover , the product @xmath38 can be constrained .",
    "however , we are left with a large uncertainty in both @xmath49 and @xmath50 , as well as in the phase of @xmath29 , @xmath35 .",
    "this causes a rather large uncertainty in the collider prediction of the neutralino relic density of @xmath174 at 95% cl .",
    "taking into account the possibility of non - zero phases is of particular importance : from pure sparticle spectroscopy , e.g.  the measurement of the @xmath30@xmath9 mass difference which is @xmath175 gev in our scenario , one might conclude that the neutralino relic density is too large , @xmath176 .",
    "evidence of a cp - violating signal in edms and/or in collider measurements would clearly show that phases have to be taken into account .",
    "it would , however , not directly add information for infering the relic density of the neutralino dark matter candidate .",
    "we have also discussed implications for ( in)direct dark matter searches .",
    "while the cross section for indirect detection shows a too weak dependence , information from large scale dark matter detectors could indeed somewhat reduce the allowed parameter range . in any case ,",
    "direct and indirect detection are important cross checks that the @xmath177 is indeed the dm .    finally , for a percent - level collider determination of @xmath1 , which matches the precision of cosmological observations",
    ", one would need know also @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and the cp phases ( in our case @xmath35 ) to percent - level precision .",
    "to this aim , the above - mentioned ilc measurements have to be complemented by precision measurements of the heavy higgsino - like neutralinos and charginos at tev energies .",
