    "in searching for gravitational wave signals from coalescing binary compact objects , one commonly uses an optimal filtering technique @xcite .",
    "this technique consists of the comparison of the output signal of an interferometric gravitational waves detector with a family of expected theoretical waveforms , called templates .",
    "each template depends on one or more parameters @xmath0 .",
    "the choice of the templates in the @xmath0 parameter space , called placement , is the purpose of this paper .",
    "we restrict ourselves to a 2d parameter space , considering spinless templates computed at second post - newtonian order .",
    "we will first describe in section [ sec_motivations ] the motivations of our placement technique , comparing it with a simple uniform paving of the parameter space .",
    "section [ sec_computation_par ] describes the calculation of the parameters of the parameter space portion covered by a single template .",
    "this portion is in our case well approximated by an ellipse .",
    "next , section [ sec_triangulation ] treats the triangulation of the parameter space , a step needed by the placement , which is covered by section [ sec_placement ] .",
    "finally , performance tests are covered by section [ sec_performance ] , where some real use - cases are considered in the context of the virgo detector @xcite .",
    "the comparison of a signal with one template is made through a wiener filter @xcite : @xmath1\\ ] ] this is essentially a weighted intercorrelation , @xmath2 being the interferometer output and @xmath3 the template .",
    "@xmath4 is the noise power spectral density ( psd ) of the detector , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the lower and upper limits of the detector spectral window .",
    "each template is represented by a point in a multidimensional parameter space . after taking care of most extrinsic parameters ( like time of arrival or initial orbital phase of the system ) by maximizing the output of the optimal filter over them @xcite ,",
    "there remain only two parameters , that we will call @xmath7 and @xmath8",
    ". those parameters may be the masses of the two bodies but in general , one uses parameters derived from the masses that simplify the calculations .",
    "a template corresponding to parameters @xmath9 is sensitive to a signal corresponding to nearby parameters @xmath10 .",
    "the difference leads to a decrease in signal over noise ratio ( snr ) with respect to the snr obtained with a signal corresponding to the exact template . for an acceptable loss in snr ,",
    "each template covers a portion of the two dimensional parameter space . following owen @xcite in a geometrical interpretation of the optimal filtering , one is able to define a distance between two templates as the ambiguity function maximized over extrinsic parameters , called `` match '' .",
    "when filtering a signal which has the same shape as a template of parameters @xmath10 with a reference template of parameters @xmath9 , the match is the fraction of the optimal snr obtained when filtering the reference template with a signal identical in shape to itself .    given a minimal match @xmath11 , we can define the region of parameter space around a given point corresponding to a template @xmath12 , the match of which , computed with any template corresponding to a point in the region , will be above @xmath11 .",
    "we will call the boundary of this region the `` isomatch contour '' .",
    "the shape of this boundary may be complex , so one generally uses parameters for which it has been shown that , for high values of the minimal match , ( @xmath13 ) the contour is closed and well approximated by an ellipse @xcite . throughout this paper , instead of masses , we will use chirp times @xmath14 and @xmath15@xcite defined as :    @xmath16    in geometrized units ( @xmath17 ) , where @xmath18 is the total mass of the binary system , @xmath19 is the symmetric mass ratio and @xmath20 a fiducial frequency chosen as the lower frequency cutoff of the detector sensitivity .",
    "results are properly scaled to restore physical units .",
    "the calculation of the parameters of the ellipse may be done analytically for a given spectral density @xcite@xcite .",
    "the final goal of our study is to pave the parameter space with isomatch contours in as optimal a way as possible .",
    "this is equivalent to finding the minimal set of templates whose isomatch contours pave all the parameter space , without letting any hole or unpaved region @xcite .",
    "one simple solution , already described elsewhere , is to calculate the ellipse parameters for the point in the parameter space where it is known to be the smallest and pave the space with this single ellipse @xcite , obtaining a regular tiling of the parameter space .",
    "this is not very different from paving a bidimensional space with circles . as was already noted @xcite , because of the rotational symmetry",
    ", the centers of the circles should sit at the vertices of regular polygons which make a regular tiling of the plane .",
    "this is only possible for triangles , squares or hexagons . in the first case ,",
    "the centers of the circles are placed on the corners of an equilateral triangle , as shown in figure [ circle_place ] a ) .",
    "it is desirable to have the sparsest possible circles , which means that three circles touch at one single point @xmath21 .",
    "the surface region consisting of the points whose closest circle center is @xmath22 is shown in gray .",
    "this is also the surface covered on average by one circle .",
    ", width=566 ]    in the triangular case , it is a hexagon .",
    "the set of points which belongs to this region is called the voronoi set of @xmath22 . as illustrated in figure [ circle_place ] , in the case of a square tiling",
    ", the voronoi set has a square shape and in the case of a hexagonal tiling , the voronoi set has a triangular shape .",
    "it has been shown @xcite , as one would intuitively expect , that the most efficient tiling in the case of placement of circles is the triangular one .",
    "of course , in our case , the circles are skewed according to the parameters of the initially calculated ellipse .",
    "the tiling is extended outside the parameter space to make the coverage complete .",
    "the ellipses , the center of which lies in a physically forbidden region ( under the equal mass line ) , are shifted towards the allowed region , staying on the equal mass line , still ensuring the completeness of the coverage .",
    "an example is given in fig .",
    "[ simple_tile ] , where the ellipse at the extreme right ( smallest masses ) represents the only computed point .",
    ", width=491 ]      the above simple method is very fast but , assuming that one uses the smallest possible ellipse , is clearly suboptimal in most cases .",
    "it gives a higher number of templates than would be ideally needed if one was able to calculate the shape of the isomatch contours at any given point of the parameter space and use those bigger shapes to cover the space .",
    "a second problem would then arise , since an optimal tiling of the parameter space with varying shapes is far from being obvious .",
    "the principle of reconstruction of exact isomatch contours has been described previously @xcite as well as a preliminary placement method .",
    "we present in this paper an extension and improvement of this method in the case where the elliptic approximation for isomatch contours is assumed valid .",
    "before doing the placement , one should be able to calculate as fast as possible the ellipse parameters at any given point in the parameter space .",
    "this is done by    * calculating the ellipses at a chosen set of points ( we obtain `` seed ellipses '' ) .",
    "* triangulating the parameter space with this set . actually , as we will see , those two steps are closely linked .",
    "we give in appendix a short tutorial about triangulation and computational geometry .",
    "* interpolate linearly ellipses at any point using the previously calculated seed ellipses .",
    "this step is much faster than an analytical computation .",
    "the seed ellipses are computed using the algorithm included inside the ligo analysis library ( lal ) @xcite .",
    "this algorithm uses the procedure described in @xcite .",
    "the metric components used to find the parameters of the ellipse are calculated using the moments of the psd curve .",
    "the triangulation of the parameter space deserves hereafter a section by itself .",
    "once it is computed , each point @xmath21 in the parameter space belongs to one and only one triangle whose corners are three seed points .",
    "one is able to interpolate linearly the shapes ( resp .",
    "metric parameters ) of the three seed ellipses to obtain the parameters of the ellipse ( resp .",
    "metric ) at point @xmath21 ( see fig . [ interpolation ] ) .    ,",
    "the triangulation of the parameter space is done using standard techniques known in computational geometry .",
    "the notions necessary to understand the present study are explained in appendix .",
    "the base algorithm used is known as the bowyer - watson @xcite@xcite algorithm .",
    "the bowyer - watson algorithm is quite simple but needs adaptation to our problem .",
    "we need to take care of the fact that the borders of the parameter space are not convex and we need to choose which points to use for the triangulation .    the main idea of our adapted algorithm is to start from an existing triangle at the corners of which sit three already calculated ellipses @xmath23 and subdivide it only if necessary , i.e. if for any point @xmath21 inside the triangle , the ellipse linearly interpolated between @xmath23 is different enough from the one calculated using the metric at that point .",
    "let @xmath24 be the interpolated ellipse and @xmath25 the calculated one .",
    "@xmath26 being the measure of the surface of @xmath24 , @xmath27 the surface of @xmath24 that does not intersect @xmath25 ( fig . [ intersect_ellipses ] ) , the variable describing the difference between @xmath24 and @xmath25 has been chosen as the proportion @xmath28 it was not deemed necessary to also take into account the surface of @xmath25 that does not intersect @xmath24 , because if @xmath27 is null , the interpolated ellipse is completely inscribed inside the calculated one and we are simply going to make a more dense placement at a later stage .    , height=132 ]    a limit is set on this variable to stop the subdivision of triangles .",
    "given an existing triangle , a choice has to be made on the points appropriate for its subdivision .",
    "ideally , one would use the points which have the highest proportion @xmath29 .",
    "it is however impractical , and very expensive in terms of computing power to test all the points in a triangle to find the one with the higher @xmath29 .",
    "we chose to test only the middle points of each segment forming the triangle .",
    "each of these three points is inserted and used to subdivide the triangle following a delaunay method , but considering only the triangle , not the adjacent ones that may exist in the ongoing triangulation process .",
    "if the middle point of a segment is outside the parameter space , it is replaced by the closest point on the border , perpendicularly to the segment ( fig .",
    "[ close_border_point ] ) . some peculiar situations ( two middle segment points outside the parameter space for example ) are taken into account .",
    "all subtriangles generated outside the parameter space are removed .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     the frequency of recomputation of the placement is still under consideration in virgo .",
    "it depends on the change rate of the shape of the sensitivity curve over time , the stability of which is not yet fully assessed for future science runs .",
    "the numbers given in table [ compute_time ] may seem too large for a frequent recomputation , for instance every 15 minutes , in the case of large volume parameter spaces .",
    "though such a frequency is not expected for the final virgo science runs , we may need to consider a parallelization of the algorithm .",
    "the part of the algorithm that could be parallelized efficiently is the placement part , but one should not expect more than an estimated factor 2 to 5 improvement in overall computing time , due to the sequential nature of the algorithm . indeed , in one line of ellipses , ellipse number @xmath30 may not be placed before ellipse number @xmath31 .",
    "only the placement of complete lines may be somewhat decorrelated .",
    "beside very important pioneering efforts @xcite@xcite the results of which are now widely used , several previous studies were done for the template placement problem .",
    "we believe that our method is somewhat complementary to them .",
    "for example , the placement algorithm used in @xcite for extended hierarchical searches is based on a square tiling .",
    "this is justified in this case by the low minimal match value used ( @xmath32 ) , which gives very irregularly shaped contours .",
    "our method could probably be adapted to such a case by applying methods such as in @xcite to determine the shape of the contours , but an important effort has to be made to improve the speed of the shape reconstruction algorithm , which is going to be one of the main limiting factors .",
    "another example is the paper of arnaud et al.@xcite where authors devise a 2d tiling method and test it in the case of supernova ringdown signals .",
    "it is very difficult to make a direct comparison between this algorithm and ours .",
    "the very large parameter space curvature described by arnaud et al is likely to bring some holes if we apply directly our tiling method to ringdown signals .",
    "this would imply the need for an improvement to our placement procedure . on the other hand ,",
    "the arnaud 2d tiling method was not yet applied to the case of a @xmath33 inspiral parameter space and it is not clear what would be the result in terms of speed and possible overcoverage .",
    "the computational geometry tools that we used are still valid in higher dimensional spaces",
    ". it may be tempting to consider the extension of our algorithm to multidimensional searches . in that case",
    ", the main challenge would be to improve the algorithm speed , since the number of contours in nd is roughly going as @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the number of contours obtained in 2d .",
    "this is of course a `` worst case '' scenario where the granularity is the same ( and high ) in all dimensions .",
    "we presented a technique for doing the placement of isomatch ellipses on a template parameter space using triangulation and interpolation of seed ellipses .",
    "a comparison is done with a simple regular triangular tiling using a single ellipse .",
    "this comparison shows an improvement between 6% and 30% depending on the mass range and frequency range .",
    "some coverage tests were also performed that show a few percent undercoverage of the parameter space , mainly in the high mass region .",
    "this undercoverage seems to come from the miscalculation of the metric for high masses .",
    "finally , speed tests were made .",
    "we would like to thank all our virgo colleagues from the inspiral data analysis group , and particularly andrea vicer for his help in bringing an important piece of mathematica code and insightful comments .",
    "we would also like to acknowledge the use of the ligo analysis library , and thank thomas cokelaer for his precious help .",
