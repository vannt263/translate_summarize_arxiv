    "given the positional uncertainty of the _ herschel _  250  @xmath10 m  sources , the 5  lower limit on the angular separation is imposed as an attempt to avoid far - ir - luminous qsos , i.e. , the qsos are the smgs themselves . through visual inspection of the qso spectra , we further excluded 31 pairs whose qsos exhibit strong broad absorption lines ( bals ; this makes them unsuitable for absorption line work ) , have wrong redshifts , or are misclassified .",

    "we conservatively classify this system as ambiguous , even though the non - detection of strong metal lines strongly suggests that it is an optically thin absorber , because fewer than 5% of optically thick absorbers have no detection of a metal transition @xcite . * _ ngp1333@xmath62357_.",

    "all of these lines lie within the ly@xmath3  forest , and their velocity profiles are distinctly different from that of the ly@xmath3  line , indicating that these putative metal absorption are spurious .",

    "this system is unlikely optically thick because the line center drops only to 40% of the continuum intensity ( i.e. , it does not go line black ) . like the previous cases",

    "hence , we classify this system as optically thin .    in summary ,",
    "we have identified one clearly optically thin case and two ambiguous cases with three qso sightlines covering impact parameters between @xmath130  kpc around smgs at @xmath131 .",
    "the two ambiguous cases are also likely to be optically thin , given the non - detection of any metal transitions .",
    "for background qso sightlines probing the cgm of @xmath132 foreground qsos , one observes hi  absorbers optically thick at the lyman limit @xmath13360% of the time .",
    "the high hi  covering fraction extends to at least the expected virial radius of @xmath0160  kpc @xcite . in figure",
    "[ fig : covfrac ] , we compare ( 1 ) the smg sample distribution with the qsos from the qpq project , and ( 2 ) the covering fraction of optically thick hi  gas around smgs with that around qsos .",
    "the two samples overlap in the plane of foreground redshift vs. impact parameter : the smgs cover the same redshift range as the qsos in the intermediate impact parameter range between 100 and 200  kpc .",
    "we calculate the 1@xmath54 binomial confidence intervals of the optically thick fraction using the quantiles of the beta distribution @xcite . because there is no clearly optically thick absorber among the three systems we analyzed , our 1@xmath54 confidence interval of the covering fraction is 4.2@xmath836.9% for a non - detection in a sample of three . for comparison",
    ", we consider all of the qso sightlines with @xmath130  kpc from the qpq project @xcite and we find the optically thick covering fraction is @xmath134% for 21 clearly optically thick systems among 33 systems . therefore , despite our small sample , the upper bound of our 1@xmath54 confidence interval is 3@xmath54 below the best - estimated covering fraction around qsos at the same ranges of redshifts and impact parameters .    note that although our analysis may appear to have limitations based on the classification of two of the smg absorbers as ambiguous , these same limitations also apply to the qpq analysis , and are inherent to any attempt to classify absorbers using low or moderate resolution spectra without coverage of the hi  lyman limit ( at 912  in the rest - frame ) . as such ,",
    "we have followed exactly the same procedure for absorber classification as in the qpq studies , enabling a direct comparison to that work .",
    "note , however , there are some minor differences between our analysis and the qpq analysis which are compared in fig .",
    "[ fig : covfrac ] .",
    "first , the bulk of the qpq dataset @xcite utilized background qso spectra with moderate resolution ( @xmath135 ) .",
    "this is a factor of two higher than the resolution we used for the qso spectra probing two of our smgs ( @xmath85 ) , whereas in l6-fls1712@xmath66001 our spectrum has @xmath87 .",
    "but the lower resolution of our spectra does not play a significant role in the resulting classification of our absorbers , since the typical strength of the metal lines seen in the optically thick systems would still be easily detectable at @xmath85 , and the one system that we observed at @xmath87 is unambiguously optically thin , since it does not go line black .",
    "another significant difference , is whereas @xcite restricted analysis to only those foreground qsos with redshifts lying within the ly@xmath3  forest of the background qso , we have included foreground smgs landing in the ly@xmath101  forest , owing to the larger redshift separations between the smgs and the qsos in our sample .",
    "this is unlikely to impact our deduced covering factor in fig .",
    "[ fig : covfrac ] though . for example",
    ", earlier qpq studies @xcite also considered absorbers lying in the ly@xmath101  forest , and the covering factor deduced there was consistent with that derived in @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in all of the three smg@xmath8qso pairs  shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : abs ] , multiple metal lines that are strong in optically thick absorbers ( i.e. , siii@xmath1191527 , civ@xmath1361548,1551 , aliii@xmath1191671 , and mgii@xmath1362796,2804 ) land in the clean regions outside of the lyman forest but remain undetected . finally , whereas qpq searched for absorbers within a velocity window in a @xmath71500 km s@xmath30  window owing to the large errors in qso redshifts , we adopted a @xmath7600 km s@xmath30  search window .",
    "we were able to consider a smaller velocity interval because our smg redshifts derived from narrow rest - frame optical lines are much more accurate , and this interval was instead chosen to encompass the typical virial motions in a @xmath17@xmath2  dark matter halo .",
    "the larger velocity interval used in qpq formally implies a higher level of contamination from physically unassociated absorbers .",
    "but the contamination is estimated to be at only @xmath03% level for a @xmath71500 km s@xmath30  window ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see their figure 10 and table 7 ) .",
    "this is too small to be responsible for the difference in the optically thick covering factor that we observe between qsos and smgs .",
    "motivated by the unique properties of smgs and their purported evolutionary link to high - redshift qsos and today s massive ellipticals , we have started a project to use qso absorption line spectroscopy to probe the diffuse cool hi  gas in the cgm of smgs .",
    "this work requires a sample of projected smg@xmath8qso pairs , which are extremely rare .",
    "wide - area sub - millimeter surveys are needed to compile such a sample .",
    "thanks to the advent of _ herschel _ , we have identified 163 smg@xmath8qso pairs  with bright @xmath137 qsos ( @xmath138 ) and angular separations between 5  and 36  from a suite of wide - area _",
    "herschel _  surveys and spectroscopic qso surveys .",
    "extensive followup observations are required to carry out the absorption line study . to allow slit spectroscopy ,",
    "the first stage is to use an interferometer to pin down the positions of the _ herschel _  sources .",
    "this paper focuses on a subsample of 13 smg@xmath8qso pairs  that were observed with the vla in c - band . with an average integration time of 25  min per source , the vla detected sources within the _ herschel _  beam in six fields .",
    "one of the six smg@xmath8qso pair  turns out to be a far - ir - luminous qso at @xmath78 , while the _ herschel _  source in another pair turns out to be a pair of smgs .",
    "hence , we effectively identified six smg@xmath8qso pairs  from observations of 13 fields ( 46% ) .",
    "the second stage is to measure the spectroscopic redshifts of the smgs .",
    "we observed five of the six vla - identified smg@xmath8qso pairs  with near - ir spectroscopy .",
    "we were able to determine the redshifts for three of the five smgs ( 60% ) from the redshifted h@xmath3 and [ nii ]  lines .",
    "the remaining two sources show only featureless continuum in the near - ir windows , making it impossible to determine an accurate redshift .",
    "the last stage is to obtain optical spectroscopy of the qsos once it is confirmed that the qsos are in the background of the smgs . because we have selected only the brightest qsos , the success rate of this step is approaching 100% once bad qsos are removed from the sample . because of the low success rates of the first two followup stages ,",
    "only @xmath023% of the initial sample ( i.e. , three smg@xmath8qso pairs  out of 13 ) are spectroscopically confirmed and are suitable for final absorption line study .",
    "our main findings are as follows :    1 .",
    "the near - ir spectra of the five vla - detected sources are all detected in hour - long integrations with 8-meter telescopes , although only three of those show emission lines that yielded accurate spectroscopic redshifts .",
    "since we positioned the slits on the vla positions , this result shows that the spatial offset , if any , between the near - ir and the radio counterparts is less than an arcsec ( the slit width ) , consistent with the finding from differential lensing in strongly lensed sources ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the vla - identified _ herschel _  `` 350  @xmath10mpeakers '' at @xmath131 are similar to smgs selected at longer wavelengths ( i.e. , 850  @xmath10 m  to 1  mm ) , in terms of the [ nii]/h@xmath3  ratio ( i.e. , gas metallicity ) , the ir luminosity ( i.e. , sfr ) , and the ir - to - radio luminosity ratio ( i.e. , radio excess due to agn ) .",
    "the vla - identified smgs are optically faint and unbiased to radio - loud agns , so they indeed represent a galaxy population distinct from the optical selected qsos and the lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) in the same redshift range .",
    "strong hi  ly@xmath3  absorption is found in the background qso spectra for all of the three spectroscopically confirmed smg@xmath8qso pairs  with impact parameters between @xmath130  kpc .",
    "here we have adopted a much narrower search window ( @xmath7600  km s@xmath30 ) than the qpq study , further reducing the level of contamination from physically unrelated clouds .",
    "however , none of the three absorption line systems seems optically thick at the lyman limit ( i.e. , llss with @xmath113  @xmath37 ) , in contrast to the @xmath060% covering fraction of llss around qsos from the qpq study despite similar data quality , foreground redshifts , and impact parameters .",
    "our comparison thus suggests _ either _ that smgs do not have a substantial neutral gas reservoir in their halos that could potentially fuel a prolonged star formation phase _ or _ that smgs inhabit @xmath139@xmath2  halos so that our sightlines are yet to probe inside their virial radii . if the latter , their halos are comparable to those of lbgs .",
    "@xcite found an optically thick covering fraction of @xmath140% around lbgs at @xmath141 and @xmath142  kpc .",
    "note that this is @xmath02@xmath77 lower than that of coeval qsos and is consistent with the 1@xmath54 confidence interval that we were able to place for the smgs . on the other hand ,",
    "the difference in the optically thick hi  covering fraction between smgs and qsos casts doubt on the evolutionary link between the two populations , unless agn outflows can somehow affect the physical state of gas at hundreds of kpc scales within its short lifetime .",
    "our final conclusion is limited by the small sample size . to enable a more robust comparison with previous absorption - line studies , we badly need to increase the effective yield of our survey from the current level of @xmath023% . in a future publication , we will present observations with the atacama large millimeter / submillimeter array ( alma ) to pinpoint the positions of the _ herschel _  sources in the smg@xmath8qso pairs . observing at a wavelength ( 870  @xmath10 m ) much closer to the selection wavelengths ( 250 to 500  @xmath10 m ) , we expect doubling the detection rate with integration times of just several minutes per source",

    "<S> we constructed a parent sample of 163 smg - qso pairs with separations less than @xmath036  by cross - matching far - infrared - selected galaxies from _ herschel _ with spectroscopically confirmed qsos . </S>",
    "<S> the _ </S>",
    "<S> herschel _ sources were selected to match the properties of smgs . </S>",
    "<S> we determined the sub - arcsecond positions of six _ herschel _ sources with the very large array and obtained secure redshift identification for three of those with near - infrared spectroscopy . the qso sightlines probe transverse proper distances of 112 , 157 , and 198  kpc at foreground redshifts of 2.043 , 2.515 , and 2.184 , respectively , which are comparable to the virial radius of the @xmath1  @xmath2  halos expected to host smgs . </S>",
    "<S> high - quality absorption - line spectroscopy of the qsos reveals systematically strong hi  ly@xmath3  absorption around all three smgs , with rest - frame equivalent widths of @xmath4   . </S>",
    "<S> however , none of the three absorbers exhibits compelling evidence for optically thick hi  gas or metal absorption , in contrast to the dominance of strong neutral absorbers in the cgm of luminous @xmath5 qsos . </S>",
    "<S> the low covering factor of optically thick hi  gas around smgs tentatively indicates that smgs may not have as prominent cool gas reservoirs in their halos as the co - eval qsos and that they may inhabit less massive halos than previously thought . </S>"
