    "massive stars are known as progenitors of supernovae .",
    "the end - product of the supernova explosions are neutron stars or black holes which can be sources of strong gravitational waves .",
    "therefore massive stars affect not only dynamical but also chemical evolution of the galaxies .",
    "they ionize the surrounding material and emit uv radiation . almost at the beginning of their life",
    "they start to lose considerable amount of their material .",
    "studies of physical characteristics of massive components of early - type double - lined eclipsing binaries are essential for understanding of the final stages of stellar evolution .",
    "the two components of an eclipsing binary system have the same age and chemical composition when they born but slightly different masses and radii and temperatures .",
    "therefore , theoretical stellar models must be able to match their precisely determined physical properties for one age and chemical composition .",
    "this comparison for the detached eclipsing binaries leads to improvement in input physics and success of the treatment in stellar models of several physical phenomena , for example mass loss , mixing - length , convective core overshooting and opacity @xcite .",
    "in addition to this , some hints about the spin and orbital angular momentum exchange in close binaries due to mass - transfer and loss will be obtained .",
    "@xcite propose that the incidence of binary and multiple stars among the massive o - stars is much larger than that for solar - like stars .",
    "this difference in multiplicity properties is attributed to the differences in the star formation process between massive and low - mass stars .",
    "while low - mass stars may loose angular momentum by magnetic- and disk - related processes , these are ineffective in massive star formation due to short time scale of formation .",
    "@xcite estimate that o - star binary frequency is larger than 60% , even this may reach to 100 % as the gap in orbital periods between close and wide binaries is filled .",
    "they also note that most binaries occur in clusters and associations and that binaries are less common among field star and especially among young runaway stars .",
    "so far , many eclipsing binary systems have been discovered in the open clusters and associations .",
    "they not only offer determining the properties of the cluster but also allow one to calculate an accurate distance , age and chemical composition as a whole .",
    "accurate physical parameters of stars , especially masses , radii and effective temperatures may only be determined from the analyses of multi - passband light curves and radial velocities .",
    "these analyses may also yield signs about the existence of additional components .",
    "eclipsing binaries which are members of physically bounded multiple stellar systems provide additional constraints for the reliability of evolutionary models .",
    "the physical parameters that can be evaluated for the members of a multiple system should be represented by the same isochrone that fit the eclipsing pair .",
    "recently , @xcite collected astrophysical parameters of 94 detached non - interacting eclipsing binaries .",
    "masses and radii of these stars have been determined with an accuracy of 3% or more .",
    "this sample includes only three high mass binaries with a component as massive as 27 m@xmath2 .",
    "the massive binary system myser ( hd167971 , v=7.65 , u - b=-0.34 , b - v=0.75mag ) is the central star of ngc6604 , which is listed by @xcite among the visually most luminous o stars in the galaxy .",
    "ngc6604 is a young , compact open cluster lying at the core of the h ii region s54 @xcite , in the serob2 association @xcite .",
    "first photoelectric photometry made by @xcite who classified it as o8f in the mk system .",
    "later on @xcite refined this classification as o7.5if , and @xcite as o8ib(f)p .",
    "@xcite re - classified the star as o8ibf .",
    "its light variability was detected by @xcite , and later , its eclipsing nature with an orbital period of 3.32 days was revealed by @xcite .",
    "photometric and spectroscopic observations of the star were obtained by @xcite .",
    "they derived the orbital period for the eclipsing pair as 3.32 days and classified the stars as o8i+o5 - 8v .",
    "they have also pointed out that a third component of spectral type o5 - 8v dominates the optical and the uv luminosity of the eclipsing pair .",
    "first attempt for the solution of the light curve is made by @xcite .",
    "they obtained ubvri light curves and performed preliminary analyses of these curves assuming the light contribution of the third star as 63.3% , 31.55% and zero . later on ubv passbands and their analyses are published by @xcite .",
    "they find light contribution of the third star in the u , b and v light curves as 55.2% , 56.5% and 56.7% , respectively .",
    "the radial velocities of both components of the eclipsing pair were revealed by @xcite using the eso archive spectra . combining the results of the radial velocity and light curves analyses they estimate the masses of the components as 37.4 and 34.8 m@xmath2 .    in this paper",
    "we present new spectroscopic observations and radial velocities of both components of the eclipsing pair . by analysing the previously published light curves and the new radial velocities we obtain orbital parameters for the stars . combining the results of these analyses",
    "we obtain absolute physical parameters of both components .",
    "in addition we reveal for the first time orbital parameters of the third - body s orbit and the parameters of the third star .",
    "optical spectroscopic observations of the myser were obtained with the turkish faint object spectrograph camera ( tfosc ) attached to the * 1.5 m telescope in july , 2129 , 2012 * , under good seeing conditions .",
    "further details on the telescope and the spectrograph can be found at http://www.tug.tubitak.gov.tr .",
    "the wavelength coverage of each spectrum was 4000 - 9000   in 12 orders , with a resolving power of @xmath5/@xmath6 @xmath77000 at 6563   and an average signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) was @xmath7120 .",
    "we also obtained high s / n spectra of four early type standard stars 21cyg , @xmath8her , hr153 and 21peg for use as templates in derivation of the radial velocities .",
    "the electronic bias was removed from each image and we used the crreject option for cosmic ray removal .",
    "thus , the resulting spectra were largely cleaned from the cosmic rays .",
    "the echelle spectra were extracted and wavelength calibrated by using fe - ar lamp source with help of the iraf echelle package , see @xcite .",
    "the ubv and intermediate - passband photometric observations have been obtained in 1985 by @xcite in three observatories . despite some gaps in the resulting light curve",
    "the overall - shape of the light curve is well - represented by their observations .",
    "depth of the primary minimum is deeper only 0.03 mag and the phase interval between the two eclipses is about 0.5 , giving an evidence of circular orbit .",
    "almost the same epoch @xcite performed photometric observations in the cousins - bessel ubvri filters .",
    "they have published five - passband light curves as well as individual differential photometric measurements .",
    "the most outstanding feature in their light curves is the asymmetry , in particular , light level immediately following primary eclipse appears to be depressed .",
    "ubv photometry of myser in seven seasons of the years from 1990 to 1994 is performed by @xcite .",
    "fortunately , one can reach to their original data . in consequence ,",
    "two original multi - passband data sets are available for the use in interpretations .",
    "@xcite found from the line spectrum that myser is a triple system with two close eclipsing o stars and a distant companion also of spectral type o. they note that the third star is the most luminous component of the system both in the optical and the uv spectra .",
    "the third star has been angularly resolved for the first time by @xcite using multi - epoch vlti observations .",
    "their observations provide direct evidence for a gravitational link between the eclipsing pair and the o8 supergiant .",
    "they measured separations between the components a and b ( the eclipsing binary ) vary from 8 to 15 mas over the three - year baseline .",
    "they suggest that the stars evolve on a wide and eccentric orbit which is not coplanar with the orbit of the inner eclipsing pair .",
    "since the photometric observations of the eclipsing pair go back to middle of 1980s the orbit of the eclipsing pair around the center - of - mass of triple system can be determined from the times of mid - eclipses . however , the orbital period of the eclipsing binary is too long to be obtained a complete minimum in a night in an observing site .",
    "the eclipse , from first to fourth contact , lasts about 20 hours . for this reason",
    "a few times of mid - eclipse was seen in the literature . they could be obtained from the observations at the near to mid - eclipse .",
    "therefore we try to estimate mid - primary and mid - secondary eclipses using the observations obtained in the ingress and egress of the minima . for this reason",
    ", we performed a preliminary analysis of the light curves obtained by @xcite and obtained the best fit representation of the observed light curves . plotting the observations with the same scales that of the computed curve and determined the minimum time by shifting it along the time axis .",
    "we note that the shape of the light curve is assumed to be constant during the time base of the observations . as the best fit is obtained the time for mid - primary or mid - secondary eclipses are read off from the observations . using this procedure",
    "we obtained 20 times for the mid - primary and 21 for the secondary eclipse .",
    "the times are given in table 1 with those taken from o - c gateway data - base in the literature .",
    "the uncertainties of the minima derived in this study are about a few hundredths of a day .",
    ".times of mid - eclipses for myser and the o - c residuals ( see text ) [ cols=\"^,>,^,^,>\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "hd167971 is one of the rare triple system with massive components .",
    "analysis of the radial velocities and light curves suggest that the inner binary consists of an o7.5 iii and o9.5 iii stars .",
    "the spectral type of the third star is estimated as o9.5 between giant and supergiant luminosity classes .",
    "the times for mid - primary and mid - secondary eclipses are analysed for the first time for the parameters of the third - body orbit .",
    "the gravitational link between the myser and a third - star is confirmed .",
    "using our estimation of @xmath10(b - v ) and a@xmath11 we determined a distance of about 1650pc which is in agreement with the distance of the open cluster ngc6604 .",
    "the properties of the components of myser are compared with theoretical models . while the locations of the more massive primary component on the effective temperature - luminosity , effective temperature - gravity and mass - gravity planes are consistent with the models the less massive secondary star appears to have lower temperature with respect to its mass .",
    "both components of myser locate on the mass - gravity plane , that matched very well with an isochrone of 4myr .",
    "the ages suggested for ngc6604 range from 4 to 6myr .",
    "our results yield that the age of the close binary , is close to 4myr , and thus ngc6604 , where star formation still is going on .",
