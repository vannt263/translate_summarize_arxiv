    "quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) connects hadronic matter to its fundamental constituents , quarks , and gluons .",
    "many aspects of qcd are poorly understood , in spite of four decades of intense experimental and theoretical effort . as part of this effort ,",
    "deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) of leptons from nucleons has played a central role in establishing qcd as the reigning theory of the strong interaction and continues to serve as a mainstay for attempts to unravel qcd s mysteries ( for complete reviews see , for example , refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "theoretically , inclusive dis cross sections are separated into leptonic and hadronic tensors , which capture the electroweak and strong dynamics of the scattering process , respectively .",
    "the hadronic tensor factorizes into a convolution of infrared - safe perturbative coefficients and parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) , which incorporate the low - energy qcd physics and therefore must be determined nonperturbatively .",
    "pdfs are independent of the scattering process  but depend on the target nucleon , while the perturbative coefficients are independent of the external scattering states .",
    "pdfs are important for two reasons .",
    "first , they furnish direct knowledge of the constituents of hadronic states  the dominant form of visible matter in the universe  in terms of the fundamental theory of the strong force .",
    "second , they provide constraints on hadronic backgrounds at collider experiments , such as the large hadron collider .",
    "these backgrounds affect the sensitivity of a variety of high energy experiments , including studies of the properties of the higgs boson @xcite , and searches for heavy @xmath0 and @xmath1 boson production @xcite .",
    "pdfs can not currently be calculated directly from qcd using _ ab initio _",
    "lattice qcd , because they are defined in terms of light - cone matrix elements that are not directly accessible on euclidean lattices .",
    "hence , pdfs are usually extracted from global analyses of different experiments @xcite .",
    "naturally a direct nonperturbative computation of pdfs is desirable : with sufficient precision , such a calculation would further constrain global fits in regions that may be experimentally inaccessible .    until recently ,",
    "lattice calculations have focused on determining the mellin moments of pdfs , which are related to matrix elements of twist-2 operators that _ can _ be determined on the lattice @xcite .",
    "the lattice regulator breaks lorentz symmetry , which induces radiative mixing between operators of different mass dimensions .",
    "the resulting power divergences in the lattice spacing completely obscure the continuum limit .",
    "moments up to the fourth moment can be extracted by carefully choosing the external momenta and operators , but this significantly limits the precision with which one can extract meaningful results for pdfs @xcite . beyond the fourth moment , power divergent mixing is inevitable and this method can not provide reliable calculations .",
    "ji recently proposed a new approach to directly extract pdfs from lattice calculations @xcite , based on a large - momentum effective theory @xcite .",
    "preliminary results first appeared in ref .",
    "@xcite , but a number of issues remain , including a complete understanding of the renormalization of the relevant lattice matrix elements and the practical ability to resolve sufficiently large momenta on the lattice .    here",
    "we propose a new formalism that removes mixing in the continuum limit and , in principle , enables the extraction of higher moments of pdfs from lattice qcd .",
    "we call this formalism the `` smeared operator product expansion '' ( sope ) .",
    "we expand continuum matrix elements in a basis of locally - smeared lattice degrees of freedom .",
    "the resulting matrix elements are functions of two scales , the smearing scale and the renormalization scale .",
    "the sope provides the framework necessary to relate these matrix elements , via wilson coefficients , to phenomenologically useful quantities , such as the hadronic tensor of dis .",
    "smearing has been widely used in lattice qcd to reduce ultraviolet fluctuations , partially restore rotational symmetry and thereby systematically improve the precision of lattice calculations @xcite . for a pedagogical overview of smearing in lattice calculations ,",
    "see , for example , ref .  @xcite . in the sope ,",
    "we implement smearing via the gradient flow , a classical evolution of the fields in a new dimension , the flow time , toward the stationary points of the action @xcite .",
    "matrix elements determined nonperturbatively on the lattice require no further renormalization , up to a fermionic wave function renormalization @xcite , and remain finite , provided the smearing scale is kept fixed in physical units in the continuum limit @xcite .",
    "there are two further advantages : the gradient flow allows one to use smearing lengths of only one or two lattice spacings , much smaller than hadronic length scales on typical lattices , and therefore does not distort the low energy physics @xcite , and also the gradient flow is computationally very cheap .",
    "the gradient flow is now well - established as a tool to study lattice gauge theories , with applications from scale - setting , _",
    "i.e. _  determining the lattice spacing in physical units @xcite , to studying renormalization in lattice gauge theories .",
    "for example , the gradient flow has been used to define finite - volume renormalization schemes for the strong coupling constant @xcite , for operator renormalization @xcite , and to understand the nonperturbative scale dependence of renormalized matrix elements @xcite .",
    "related work has used ward identities to study chiral fermions on the lattice @xcite and the energy - momentum tensor @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we introduce the gradient flow for a single real scalar field with quartic interactions and outline some of the properties of the sope applied to real scalar field theory .",
    "scalar field theories describe some important critical phenomena in nature , such as the antiferromagnetic phase transition , and have a long history as a testing ground for fundamental ideas in quantum field theory in four dimensions . for our purposes ,",
    "the chief advantage is the simplicity of euclidean scalar field theory , which lays bare the structure of the sope and highlights the points of similarity and contrast with the local operator product expansion ( ope ) .    in the next section ,",
    "we review wilson s ope and introduce the sope .",
    "we then apply the sope to scalar field theory in sec .",
    "[ sec : phi4 ] , illustrate how the gradient flow removes power - divergent mixing in sec .",
    "[ sec : lattsmear ] , and calculate the perturbative wilson coefficients to two loops in sec .",
    "[ sec : wc ] . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : rgeqns ] , we study the scale dependence of the sope through renormalization group equations for the wilson coefficients .",
    "wilson s approach to the ope for a nonlocal operator is widely known ",
    "see , for example , ref",
    ".  @xcite  and here we review some notation necessary for our discussion .",
    "we write the ope for a nonlocal operator , @xmath2 , as @xmath3_{\\mathrm{r}}.\\ ] ] the wilson coefficients @xmath4 are complex functions of the spacetime separation , @xmath5 , and renormalization scale , @xmath6 , that capture the short - distance physics associated with the renormalized local operator @xmath7_{\\mathrm{r}}$ ] .",
    "we represent renormalized operators by @xmath8_{\\mathrm{r}}$ ] and suppress their dependence on the renormalization scale , @xmath6 , for notational simplicity .",
    "the free - field mass dimension of the local operator determines the leading spacetime dependence of the corresponding wilson coefficient .    as an example , let us consider the time - ordered two - point function of two scalar fields with spacetime separation @xmath5 : @xmath9 . in free scalar field theory , the ope is a laurent expansion .",
    "interactions generate subleading dependence on the spacetime separation in the wilson coefficients , which become functions of the spacetime separation , the ( renormalized ) mass @xmath10 , and the renormalization scale , @xmath6 : @xmath11_{\\mathrm{r } } \\nonumber\\\\ { } & \\qquad   + { \\cal o}(x).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here we have factored out the leading spacetime dependence from the wilson coefficients .",
    "the @xmath12 indicates terms of order @xmath5 , up to logarithmic corrections generated by interactions .",
    "we propose replacing the set of local operators in the ope by their locally smeared counterparts @xmath13 the wilson coefficients , @xmath14 , and the smeared operators , @xmath15 , are now functions of an extra scale , the flow time , @xmath16 .",
    "nevertheless , the leading spacetime dependence of the wilson coefficients is dictated by the canonical mass dimension of the corresponding smeared operator and is therefore just that of the standard ope .",
    "just as the ope is only valid for small spacetime separations , the sope requires small flow times .",
    "we will see that we require that @xmath17 , where @xmath5 is assumed to be small , to ensure that the wilson coefficients are independent of the external states .",
    "for example , returning to the time - ordered two - point function , the sope is @xmath18 where we denote smeared fields at flow time @xmath16 by @xmath19 .    in the following sections",
    ", we will observe four features of the smeared wilson coefficients in the sope .    1",
    ".   the logarithmic spacetime dependence of the original ope is preserved in the sope .",
    "2 .   the flow time serves as an ultraviolet regulator for the smeared wilson coefficients , to leading - order in perturbation theory .",
    "3 .   beyond",
    "leading - order the flow time can not regularize the wilson coefficients , because the flow evolution is classical .",
    "we can , however , absorb renormalization scale dependence into the renormalization parameters of the original theory .",
    "4 .   for any ope to be meaningful , the wilson coefficients must be independent of the external states .",
    "we can ensure this for the sope by choosing @xmath20 ; _ i.e. _  the mean smearing radius must be smaller than the spacetime extent of the nonlocal operator .",
    "this ensures that the sope remains an expansion in approximately local operators . in other words , if the gradient flow probes length scales on the order of the nonlocal operator , then the sope becomes a poor expansion for the original operator .",
    "although we refer to this expansion as the _ smeared _ ope , we really have in mind that the smearing is implemented via the gradient flow .",
    "the gradient flow acts as a smoothing operation that drives the degrees of freedom of the theory to the stationary points of the action . in qcd",
    ", the gradient flow corresponds to a continuous stout - smearing procedure , an analytic method for constructing lattice gauge fields with damped ultraviolet fluctuations @xcite .",
    "the direct comparison of the gradient flow to other smearing schemes was first undertaken in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "many studies of the gradient flow have incorporated a small flow - time expansion of fields at nonvanishing flow time in terms of local fields at zero flow time @xcite .",
    "we can view such an expansion as an ope in the flow time and thereby relate renormalized quantities calculated at nonzero flow time to the corresponding quantities in the original theory at vanishing flow time , which would otherwise be difficult to compute .    in this work ,",
    "we take a different approach .",
    "we do not expand the flowed fields in terms of original fields at nonzero flow time , but rather take as the fundamental objects of study the ( matrix elements of ) fields at positive flow time .",
    "both approaches reflect the physically - motivated expectation that smearing scales much smaller than the physical scales of the system should not distort the physics in question .",
    "the small flow - time expansion quantifies any deviations from this expectation and , furthermore , decouples analytic calculations of wilson coefficients in the continuum from lattice calculations with smeared degrees of freedom .",
    "the sope incorporates the smearing scale as an inherent scale of the system , which requires new wilson coefficients to be determined .",
    "thus , both the small flow - time expansion and the sope are shaped by the role of the smearing scale as ultraviolet regulator and are related , but distinct , conceptual approaches to the same physics : partially restoring rotational symmetry on the lattice .",
    "smearing , in general , is a tool that partially restores rotational symmetry @xcite and thereby improves the continuum limit of lattice calculations .",
    "smearing via the gradient flow has a number of advantages .",
    "in particular , matrix elements determined nonperturbatively on the lattice using smeared degrees of freedom require no further renormalization @xcite , up to fermionic wave function renormalization @xcite , and remain finite , provided the smearing scale is kept fixed in physical units as the continuum limit is taken .",
    "we now turn to a more complete study of the sope applied to @xmath21 scalar field theory , a particularly straightforward theory in which to examine the sope .",
    "we can solve the flow - time equations exactly , because the flow - time evolution is linear in the scalar field .",
    "we do not need to consider the complications associated with gauge fixing @xcite  nor the extra renormalization of fermions @xcite .",
    "furthermore , for scalar fields the sope can be understood to be simply a resummation of the original ope .",
    "although it is not necessary for our work , it is also interesting to note that the ope is known to converge for euclidean @xmath21 theory in four dimensions , at a fixed , but arbitrary order in the perturbative expansion @xcite .",
    "this result holds at arbitrary spacetime separations , provided the external states are of compact support .    looking toward future calculations in qcd",
    ", we anticipate that the technical issues associated with a flow equation that incorporates gauge field interactions will slightly complicate the perturbative calculations by increasing the number of diagrams at a given order in perturbation theory , but will not alter our conclusions . within the gauge sector",
    ", there are no loops of flowed fields , because renormalized correlation functions remain finite at nonzero flow time @xcite .",
    "therefore , at leading - order in perturbation theory , the flow time regulates ultraviolet divergences ; beyond leading - order an appropriate renormalization procedure must be incorporated . with fermionic fields",
    "there is an extra fermion renormalization parameter , calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite , but this can be removed by considering renormalization group invariant quantities @xcite .",
    "we also note that all perturbative calculations for the sope can be carried out in the continuum and do not require lattice perturbation theory , which is generally more involved @xcite .",
    "we work in four - dimensional euclidean scalar field theory with quartic self - interactions and bare mass @xmath22 , defined by the action @xmath23 = \\frac{1}{2}\\int \\mathrm{d}^4x\\ , \\left[(\\partial_\\nu    \\phi)^2 + m^2\\phi^2 + \\frac{\\lambda}{12}\\phi^4\\right].\\ ] ]    to study the sope , we introduce the scalar gradient flow , which we define through the flow - time evolution equation @xmath24 where @xmath25 is a scalar field at nonzero flow time , @xmath16 , and @xmath26 is the euclidean , four - dimensional laplacian operator .",
    "note that the flow time has units @xmath27 = [ x]^2 $ ] .    imposing the dirichlet boundary condition @xmath28 ,",
    "we may write the exact solution of the flow time equation as @xmath29 or , in the momentum representation , as @xmath30    the full solution is @xmath31 which demonstrates explicitly the `` smearing '' effect of the gradient flow : the flow time exponentially suppresses ultraviolet modes .",
    "we parametrize the smearing radius via the root - mean - square smearing length , @xmath32 .",
    "the ( euclidean ) smeared scalar propagator , for two fields at flow times @xmath33 and @xmath34 , is given by @xmath35 the flow - time evolution is classical , so any interactions must occur at zero flow time .",
    "the corresponding feynman rule for the four - point vertex is just that of the standard ( euclidean ) four - point vertex , @xmath36 .",
    "before we examine the sope in detail , we demonstrate how the gradient flow removes power - divergent mixing on the lattice .",
    "we consider the example of twist-2 operators in scalar field theory , which are symmetric and traceless and given by @xmath37 on the lattice , we replace the partial derivatives with discrete difference operators @xmath38 the spacetime point @xmath5 is now a node in the lattice , @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the lattice spacing and @xmath41 is a four - component lattice vector . the discrete difference operators can be improved to remove discretization effects , but the simplest such symmetric operator acts on a scalar field as @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the unit vector in the @xmath44 direction .",
    "the lattice regulator breaks rotational symmetry , which induces mixing between twist-2 operators of different mass dimension . on dimensional grounds , the mixing coefficients scale with inverse powers of the lattice spacing and",
    "these coefficients diverge in the continuum limit .",
    "this is the problem of power - divergent mixing on the lattice .",
    "for example , the simple bilinear @xmath45 mixes with the operator @xmath46 with a coefficient that scales as @xmath47 .",
    "more generally , the mixing between @xmath48 and any twist-2 operator with an even number of derivatives , @xmath49 , scales as @xmath50 .",
    "the smeared counterparts of these operators , which are given by @xmath51 do not suffer from this problem .",
    "the mixing coefficient between @xmath52 and @xmath53 scales as @xmath54 , where @xmath16 is the flow time in _ physical units_. provided we keep the dimensionful scale @xmath55 fixed , where @xmath56 is dimensionless , then as the lattice spacing @xmath40 decreases , the mixing coefficient remains finite , because matrix elements at nonzero flow time can not contain any additional divergences @xcite .    as a simple illustration of this behavior ,",
    "let us consider the matrix element of two twist-2 operators of different mass dimension : @xmath57 this matrix element vanishes for massless scalar fields . on the lattice , however , the corresponding matrix element , @xmath58 is nonzero .",

    "applications include nonperturbative studies of critical phenomena in the heisenberg model , spin systems and other condensed matter systems .    in the sope , we expand nonlocal operators in a basis of smeared operators , the matrix elements of which can be determined on the lattice .",
    "we implement the smearing via the gradient flow , a classical evolution of the theory in a new dimension that smooths ultraviolet fluctuations .",
    "the continuum limit of these matrix elements is free of power divergent mixing , provided the localization scale , the smearing length , is kept fixed in the continuum limit .",
    "the resulting matrix elements are functions of two scales , the renormalization scale and the smearing length .",
