    "manganite compounds exhibiting colossal magnetoresistance ( cmr ) are of the form la@xmath8d@xmath9mno@xmath10 with d divalent , e.g.  ca , sr , ba . as the doping @xmath11 and temperature @xmath12 are varied a rich variety of phases are observed , as discussed by ramirez @xcite .",
    "recently there has been a lot of interest in these compounds with @xmath13 owing to their interesting magnetotransport properties in this regime : as @xmath12 is decreased they undergo a transition to ferromagnetic order , and near the curie temperature @xmath14 the @xmath12-dependence of the resistivity @xmath5 changes from insulating ( @xmath15 for @xmath16 ) to metallic ( @xmath17 for @xmath18 ) , with a strong peak in @xmath5 at the crossover .",
    "the application of a strong ( @xmath19 t ) magnetic field substantially reduces this peak in @xmath5 and shifts it to higher temperature , giving rise to a very large negative magnetoresistance .",
    "the physical processes causing this behaviour have been the subject of much discussion .    the simplest model proposed for the cmr",
    "compounds the one that we will study in this paper is zener s @xcite double exchange ( de ) model with hamiltonian @xmath20 here @xmath21 and @xmath22 refer to sites of the ( approximately ) simple cubic lattice of mn atoms , @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) is a @xmath25-spin conduction electron annihilation ( creation ) operator , @xmath26 is a local spin operator , @xmath27 is a conduction electron spin operator , @xmath28 is the hopping integral with discrete fourier transform @xmath29 , and @xmath30 is the hund s rule coupling constant .",
    "the number of conduction electrons per atom @xmath2 is assumed to be given by @xmath31 .",
    "physically , the relevant electrons are those coming from the mn atoms 3d shells , which contain four electrons per site in the undoped compounds and are split by the cubic crystal field into triply degenerate @xmath32 levels and higher energy doubly degenerate @xmath33 levels .",
    "strong hund coupling attempts to align all electron spins on a site , so the @xmath32 electrons are treated as localized @xmath34 spins while the conduction band is formed from the @xmath33 states .",
    "the main physical effects neglected by @xmath35 are the double degeneracy of the @xmath33 conduction band , impurity atom ( d ) disorder scattering , and coupling to the lattice degrees of freedom .",
    "furukawa @xcite has studied the infinite dimensional limit of @xmath35 for @xmath36 using dynamical mean field theory , and has concluded that the de model s predictions for @xmath5 in the paramagnetic state are compatible with experiment .",
    "millis @xcite however have claimed that @xmath5 predicted by the de model is much smaller than that measured , and that to get agreement with experiment dynamical jahn - teller phonon coupling must be included in @xmath35 .",
    "experiments show that phonon coupling is important , with for example a large shift in @xmath14 observed upon replacing some of the o atoms with a different isotope @xcite , so furukawa s claim is puzzling . in this paper",
    "we will study the one - electron local green function @xmath1 and calculate @xmath5 in an attempt to reconcile the results of millis and furukawa .",
    "this work has been briefly summarised elsewhere @xcite and is discussed in more detail by green @xcite .",
    "our starting point is kubo s calculation based on a dynamical coherent potential approximation ( cpa ) . for finite local spins @xmath0 dynamical scattering processes may occur in which local spins and conduction electrons exchange angular momentum , whereas in the classical @xmath37 limit taken by most authors the local spins are rigid and @xmath35 is a one - electron hamiltonian with spin dependent diagonal disorder .",
    "kubo s cpa is an extension of the familiar alloy cpa which takes these dynamical processes into account in a local approximation .",
    "since it is a one - electron theory kubo s approximation is only valid in the low - density @xmath3 limit , but in this limit the behaviour of the spectral function is qualitatively correct with bands with the correct weights forming about the two atomic limit ( @xmath38 ) peaks as the hopping @xmath28 is switched on . if @xmath39 double occupation of a site is forbidden so that at half - filling ( @xmath7 ) the system should be a mott insulator .",
    "this is not the case in kubo s cpa where the fermi level lies within the lower band .",
    "the correct behaviour will be obtained in an approximation which becomes exact in the atomic limit for all filling , so we are looking for a many - body extension of kubo s cpa , valid for all @xmath2 , which reduces to kubo s cpa as @xmath3 and to the correct atomic limit as @xmath40 , for all @xmath2 .",
    "it is difficult to extend the usual cpa method to the many - body case .",
    "instead we return to the original approach of hubbard @xcite in which he applied the equation of motion method to calculate the one - electron local green function @xmath1 for the hubbard model .",
    "his decoupling approximation was motivated by the alloy analogy in which electrons of one spin are considered as frozen on atomic sites .",
    "hubbard s ` scattering correction ' is equivalent to a cpa treatment of the alloy analogy @xcite and his ` resonance broadening correction ' was an attempt to restore some dynamics to the frozen electrons .",
    "the idea of @xmath41 spins being frozen in the calculation of the @xmath42 spin green function @xmath43 is introduced in the equation of motion method by neglecting commutators of the kinetic part of the hamiltonian @xmath44 with @xmath45-spin occupation numbers .    in the derivation of our approximation to @xmath1 for the de model we will make approximations analogous to those used by hubbard to obtain the scattering correction ;",
    "terms corresponding to his resonance broadening correction will be neglected .",
    "our method represents a considerable extension of hubbard s owing to the more complicated form of the interaction term of the de model , which for instance allows electrons to change spin via exchange of angular momentum with the local spins .",
    "this effect couples the equations for @xmath46 and @xmath47 which may perhaps be regarded as including some resonance broadening effects .",
    "our choice of approximations will be guided by the requirement that we recover kubo s cpa as @xmath3 and the correct atomic limit as @xmath40 .",
    "owing to the spin symmetry of @xmath35 we only need to derive an equation for @xmath46 , and the equation for @xmath47 follows immediately .",
    "we calculate the atomic limit green function @xmath48 exactly in and derive our many - body cpa equation for the green function @xmath1 in .",
    "the cpa spectral function is studied in . in the limit of infinite @xmath49 and @xmath50 ,",
    "kubo @xcite has introduced a cpa treatment of holes and we compare our results with this in section .",
    "a formula for the resistivity @xmath5 of the zero field paramagnetic state is derived in and in @xmath5 is calculated for various approximations to the density of states ( dos ) .",
    "a summary is given in .",

    "hence it will often be a good approximation to neglect the lowest band .",
    "the total weight summed over spin in the lowest two bands is @xmath107 , so it is clear that a @xmath108 theory that becomes exact as @xmath40 will give an insulator at half - filling .",
    "our general strategy in this section follows that of hubbard we will retain occupation numbers as operators rather than replacing them with their averages , but their commutators with @xmath44 will be neglected where appropriate , corresponding to the frozen electron approximation of the alloy analogy .",
    "terms which are not multiplied by @xmath28 must be treated exactly in order to obtain the correct atomic limit .",

    "is dropped and we set @xmath136 in the second term , which corresponds to neglecting a second scattering correction .    the system of equations for the scattering correction is now closed apart from the last green function in . in the equation of motion for this term we use the fact that @xmath137 and replace @xmath138 by its average in the green function coming from @xmath44 . neglecting two - site correlation functions and commutators of @xmath135 we obtain the equation of motion , for @xmath132 , @xmath139 thus closing the system of equations for the scattering correction .",

    "the scattering correction of may be treated in the same way as that of ; the only difference is that @xmath163 is replaced by @xmath164 , hence @xmath165 it is less obvious how to treat the scattering correction of . instead of giving a rigorous derivation we proceed by analogy and make the apparently reasonable approximation @xmath166 it will be seen later that this is consistent with the rest of the derivation , leading for instance to a local self - energy as expected in a cpa .    the system of equations of motion is now closed apart from the green function @xmath167 appearing in and . in general",
    "we will have to write more equations of motion to close the system .",
    "this is straightforward to do if we make approximations analogous to those used to obtain the equations of motion for @xmath126 and @xmath127 .",
    "then the green functions @xmath168 and @xmath169 and the expectations @xmath170 and @xmath171 for @xmath172 are brought into the system of equations .",
    "the resulting system of @xmath173 equations per spin is complicated to solve self - consistently for large @xmath0 however , so we will restrict ourselves to simple special cases in which we do not need any more equations of motion ; in the next three subsections we will consider the paramagnetic state in zero magnetic field for arbitrary @xmath0 , the case @xmath4 for arbitrary magnetization , and the case of saturated ferromagnetism for arbitrary @xmath0 .",
    "our approximation scheme is now complete and is entirely self - consistent , i.e.  all the expectations appearing in the system of equations can be obtained from the green functions in the system via the relation @xcite @xmath174 where @xmath175 is the fermi function and @xmath176 is the chemical potential .",
    "also , since all the approximations made above have been in terms proportional to @xmath28 the approximation is exact in the atomic limit for all @xmath0 and @xmath2 as required .",

    "agreement with kubo s approximation in the case of arbitrary magnetization is a much more stringent condition on our cpa than agreement just in the paramagnetic case , so this gives us confidence that our approximation is indeed a many - body extension of kubo s .",
    "if we assume the existence of a saturated ferromagnetic state where all local spins and conduction electron spins are aligned parallel to the positive @xmath208-axis substantial simplification occurs .",
    "the expectations occurring in the @xmath128- and @xmath129-spin systems are given by @xmath209 and the green functions @xmath75 , @xmath210 , and @xmath211 may be simplified using the relations @xmath212 the higher order green functions are given by @xmath213 the system therefore closes without needing any more equations .",
    "after simplification the set of equations of motion ( for both spin types ) reduces to @xmath214 with the other equations satisfied automatically . here",
    "@xmath215 and @xmath216 are defined as in the previous subsection .",
    "we can solve these equations in the same way as in the previous two subsections , with the usual self - consistency condition similar to applying , and the local green functions are given by @xmath217 the @xmath128-spin green function here is just the free green function shifted in energy , as might be expected . in the @xmath3 limit",
    "these equations reduce to those of kubo @xcite , providing a further check on our approximation .",
    "it is shown in the next section that these green functions are in fact not consistent with the initial assumption of a saturated ferromagnetic state .",
    "in this section we study the dos , first for the saturated ferromagnetic state and then for the paramagnetic state .",
    "we make the approximation of replacing the true dos @xmath218 for a simple cubic lattice with the elliptic dos , @xmath219 where @xmath220 is the bandwidth . for an elliptic dos the free green function",
    "is given by @xmath221 .",
    "since the self - energy @xmath155 is local the full green function is given by @xmath222 , and it follows immediately that @xmath223 .",
    "the green function equations therefore become algebraic in this approximation , greatly simplifying the calculations .",
    "the elliptic dos is also a fairly good approximation to the true dos , unlike the lorentzian dos @xmath224 considered by furukawa @xcite . in the infinite dimensional limit of a hypercubic lattice with nearest neighbour hopping the scenario considered by furukawa",
    "it may be shown that the true dos is a gaussian if the hopping @xmath28 is scaled as the inverse square root of the number of dimensions @xcite . with the scaling appropriate to three dimensions",

    "these dos s are compared in .",
    "we study the ferromagnetic state with complete spin alignment in the strong - coupling @xmath226 limit which is most favourable to ferromagnetism , shifting the energy origin by @xmath79 in order to have the zero of energy in the lowest band .",
    "equations and become @xmath227 the dos of this state is plotted in for @xmath4 and various @xmath2 .",
    "since the @xmath228- and @xmath129-spin dos s are nonzero for the same range of energies it is clear that consistent saturated ferromagnetism does not occur within our approximation for any @xmath2 .",
    "it may easily be shown that this is true for any finite @xmath0 . since strong ferromagnetism",
    "is expected to occur in the de model for at least some parameter values this is a limitation of our approximation and suggests that our cpa may not be very good at low temperatures .",
    "of course in common with the usual alloy cpa we can not obtain a true fermi liquid groundstate in our cpa the imaginary part of the self - energy does not vanish at the fermi surface at @xmath229 so we only expect our cpa to describe the de model well at finite ( but not necessarily large ) temperatures where this is not a problem .",
    "the possibility of weak ferromagnetism occurring in our approximation will be discussed elsewhere ; preliminary work on the magnetic susceptibility has already appeared in @xcite@xcite .",
    "note that the weights of the @xmath128- and @xmath129-spin bands here are 1 and @xmath230 respectively , so in the classical spin limit @xmath37 there is no possibility of @xmath129-spin weight occurring near the fermi level .",
    "in fact for @xmath37 the saturated state is always stable against spin reversal but for finite @xmath0 this is not always the case @xcite .",

    "we make this approximation in , in which the paramagnetic state dos is plotted for @xmath34 and @xmath234 for various @xmath2 ; this has the effect of removing the weak band centred on @xmath106 .",
    "it may be seen that as @xmath2 increases from 0 the band near @xmath82 is reduced in weight and a new band appears near @xmath235 , until at @xmath7 no weight remains in the band near @xmath82 .",
    "the weight in the band near @xmath79 is @xmath236 per spin , so if @xmath237 is sufficiently large to separate the bands ( @xmath233 ) this band will just be filled at @xmath7 producing a mott insulator , as discussed in",

    "simplifies to @xmath241 which corresponds to an elliptical band of weight @xmath236 and bandwidth @xmath242 .",
    "the band - narrowing factor is expected to depend upon the form of the bare dos , as pointed out by kubo @xcite , but it is interesting to note that ours is the square root of the factor obtained by brunton and edwards @xcite using a different method .",

    "there is no obvious reason for one of these cpa s to be a better approximation than the other , so we would like our many - body cpa to agree with both of kubo s approximations in the appropriate limits . in this section",

    "unfortunately the green functions defined by and are not equal ; this may be seen by considering the zero - field paramagnetic state where they reduce to @xmath252 respectively , and these equations correspond to bands with different widths .",
    "this appears to be a limitation of our cpa , which we would ideally like to interpolate continuously between kubo s cpa s .",
    "a possible explanation for this disagreement is our neglect of resonance broadening corrections in .",

    "it may be seen that @xmath5 correctly diverges at @xmath6 and @xmath7 , but the size of @xmath5 and @xmath298 for @xmath299 are much too small to explain experiment , at least in some materials .",
    "for example urushibara @xcite , who measured @xmath5 for la@xmath300sr@xmath301mno@xmath10 , found ( for @xmath12 well above @xmath14 ) that @xmath302 20 m@xmath260 cm for @xmath299 and that @xmath5 drops by about an order of magnitude as @xmath2 is reduced from 0.85 to 0.7 .",
    "we therefore agree with millis @xcite that the bare de model does not explain the paramagnetic state of the cmr materials .",
    "we also find that the @xmath12-dependence of @xmath5 is always of the metallic @xmath17 form in our approximation , whereas urushibara find a crossover between metallic behaviour at @xmath303 to insulating behaviour at @xmath304 .",
    "it should be noted that @xmath5 is independent of @xmath305 here , and the size of @xmath49 and @xmath0 and the choice of resistivity formula or , using @xmath306 in both cases , does not have a large effect .      in order to make contact with furukawa s work @xcite we now consider the effects of approximating the true cubic dos @xmath286 with the lorentzian @xmath307 , which is somewhat less realistic than the elliptical dos approximation owing to its slowly decaying tails .",
    "our equations are very simple in this case : it may be shown that @xmath308 and our equations for the green function become explicit ; switching on @xmath305 here merely broadens the peaks of the atomic limit spectral function into lorentzians with the same width parameter @xmath305 as the bare dos .",
    "our approximation and furukawa s become very similar in this case ; in the classical @xmath37 limit for example our local green function is equal to furukawa s .",
    "the slowly decaying form of the lorentzian means that the precise value of @xmath49 has more effect here than in the case of the elliptical dos : the approximation @xmath309 only holds accurately for very large @xmath49 and we only obtain a true insulator at half - filling for @xmath246 for instance . for simplicity",
    "however we take the limit @xmath226 ( with energy origin shifted by @xmath79 ) rather than use the finite value used by furukawa . in the paramagnetic state",
    "the local green function @xmath1 is then @xmath310 and the self - energy and chemical potential are @xmath311.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    if we use our finite - dimensional formula to calculate @xmath5 with the lorentzian dos we must use a mixed approximation to the dos , calculating @xmath312 using the lorentzian approximation but using the elliptic approximation for @xmath286 , in order for the integral in to converge .",
    "this problem does not arise when using the infinite dimensional conductivity formula so @xmath313 can be used throughout .",
    "the choice of conductivity formula ( with mixed approximation ) or does not qualitatively alter the results , but since the calculation using has already been published @xcite we use here .",
    "it also seems more satisfactory to use the same approximation for the dos throughout .",
    "we believe conductivity formula to be more realistic however , as it does not rely on the infinite dimensions approximation .",
    "@xmath5 is plotted against @xmath2 for various @xmath0 in .",
    "note that the result is independent of @xmath305 . as before we obtain insulating behaviour at @xmath6 and @xmath7 , but now @xmath5 and @xmath298 are of the same order of magnitude as experiment for @xmath299 , and our results are also consistent with those of furukawa .",
    "even better agreement can be obtained by reducing @xmath49 , which has the effect of reducing @xmath5 and @xmath298 for @xmath299 .",
    "furukawa s result that the de model s prediction for @xmath5 is of the same order of magnitude as the experimental value is therefore due to the unphysical approximation he used for the cubic dos .",
    "in addition to theoretical predictions of the properties of the de model , experiments @xcite also suggest that coupling to lattice degrees of freedom is a necessary ingredient in a model of cmr systems . however , we take the view that a good understanding of the bare de model is necessary before more accurate and complicated models can be tackled . accordingly in this paper we have presented a many - body cpa for the de model and a compatible formula for the resistivity @xmath5 ; our main result is the reconciliation of the calculations of millis @xcite and furukawa @xcite of @xmath5 in the paramagnetic state .",
    "we have confirmed that single - site scattering within the de model is inadequate to describe the resistivity of cmr systems .",
    "now the alloy cpa is known to give good results for a wide range of systems in which localization effects are unimportant .",
    "this should be the case here since , although some authors have claimed otherwise @xcite , localized states are expected to occur for the bare de model only in the tails of the band ; we therefore expect our formulae for @xmath75 to be good approximations .",
    "nevertheless several problems exist with our approximation .",
    "firstly , in common with the usual alloy cpa the imaginary part of the self - energy does not vanish at the fermi level at @xmath229 so we do not obtain a true fermi liquid ; this should not be important in the high temperature paramagnetic regime that we have considered but the problem could perhaps be fixed following the approach of edwards and hertz to the hubbard model @xcite .",
    "secondly , we have shown that for finite @xmath0 the saturated ferromagnetic state is never consistent in our approximation .",
    "real cmr systems are believed to exhibit strong ferromagnetism in some regimes , and it is generally expected that the de model has regions of strong ferromagnetism . finally , although we recover kubo s @xmath6 cpa in the low - density limit , we do not recover his strong - coupling @xmath7 cpa @xcite at half - filling .",
    "this appears to be a shortcoming of our approximation , possibly due to our neglect of resonance broadening corrections .",
    "these problems and possible remedies will be discussed in a later paper in which we will concentrate on the magnetic susceptibility of our cpa .",
