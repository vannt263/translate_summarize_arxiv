    "the galaxy luminosity or mass function is a fundamental tool used in interpreting the evolution of galaxies .",
    "the functions are usually defined as the number density of galaxies per logarithmic luminosity or mass interval . a steeply rising mass function to the faint population has been a generic prediction of galaxy formation based on hierarchical clustering @xcite . in contrast , the field galaxy luminosity function was observed to have a significantly flatter ` faint end ' @xcite . in order to reconcile cold dark matter ( cdm ) galaxy formation models with the observed luminosity function , star formation ( sf )",
    "is suppressed in low - mass halos by , for example , supernovae feedback @xcite or photoionisation @xcite .    on the observational side ,",
    "accurately determining the number densities of faint galaxies in the field or in clusters is challenging .",
    "this is mainly because of the low surface brightness ( sb ) of these galaxies , which means that they can be undetected in photometry even if high - sb galaxies with the same apparent magnitude are detected @xcite . despite these and other challenges",
    ", there is evidence for a ` faint - end upturn ' in luminosity functions whereby the luminosity function is rising steeply fainter than about 35 magnitudes below the characteristic luminosity , in clusters @xcite or the field @xcite .",
    "note however that the upturn is not always evident @xcite .",
    "a faint - end upturn suggests that the efficiency of feedback has levelled off at low galaxy luminosities .",
    "a more direct analysis is to compare galaxy mass functions with predicted mass functions from cdm models .",
    "@xcite compared the circular velocity distribution of satellite galaxies in the local group ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "this highlights the ` substructure problem ' where there are 510 times as many low - mass satellites in cdm models than observed .",
    "however , we still have not reached a complete census of local group satellites as evidenced by recent discoveries of low - sb galaxies around m31 @xcite and the milky way @xcite .",
    "reliable dynamical mass estimates for complete and large samples of field galaxies are difficult to obtain .",
    "stellar masses can be estimated for significantly larger samples of galaxies using the principles of stellar population synthesis @xcite .",
    "thus , galaxy stellar mass functions ( gsmfs ) can be derived from galaxy luminosities ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "comparisons between gsmfs are then , in theory , free of the stellar - population contribution to mass - to - light ( m - l ) variations that are inherent in comparisons between luminosity functions .    integrating a field gsmf to determine the cosmic stellar mass density ( smd ) brings to light the large gap between this value ( @xmath7 ) and estimates of @xmath8 from big - bang nucleosynthesis theory ( 0.04 , @xcite ) or the power spectrum of the cosmic background radiation ( 0.045 , @xcite ) .",
    "even determination of the baryonic content of galaxies including stars and cold gas accounts for less than or about 0.1 of @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "about 0.2 of @xmath8 is accounted for by hot plasma identified by x - ray emission in clusters and groups @xcite ; while the rest is projected to be in a more diffuse inter - galactic medium @xcite and perhaps the ` coronae ' of galaxies @xcite .",
    "the overall efficiency of baryons falling into the luminous disks or bulges of galaxies is low .",
    "the efficiency of sf ( fraction of baryonic mass converted to stars ) varies significantly with galaxy mass .",
    "a low efficiency averaged over the life of a galaxy gives rise to a low gas - phase metallicity ( in the inter - stellar medium ) because the metal production by supernovae is diluted by gas reservoirs within a galaxy @xcite and further infalling material .",
    "conversely a high efficiency can drive the gas - phase metallicity to high values . in this paper",

    "this then gives a more fundamental account of the baryons that are locked up in stars and how they are distributed amongst galaxies of different masses .",
    "one of the key ingredients in this calculation is the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) , which is generally assumed to be independent of galaxy type or mass @xcite . for the comparisons in this paper ,",
