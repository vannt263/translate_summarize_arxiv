    "a main goal of lattice qcd is to calculate the spectrum of light hadrons@xcite .",
    "such a calculation would not only be a major achievement in its own right and a confirmation that qcd is the correct theory of the strong interaction , it would give us added confidence in our ability to calculate many other nonperturbative quantities that are of phenomenological interest .",
    "it has been 15 years since the first pioneering calculations of the spectrum were done @xcite with computers capable of about 1 megaflop , yet some very simple questions are still relevant .",

    "these would vary with the particular computational techniques used in the calculation .",

    "in fact , this is one of our basic questions . on the other hand ,",
    "the two quark representations have different finite lattice spacing errors but are expected to have the same continuum limit .",
    "we would like to see this demonstrated by the calculations .",
    "additional possible sources of systematic error include convergence criterion for iterative matrix inversions , gauge fixing accuracy when that is done , and integration step size for molecular dynamics algorithms .",

    "the chiral extrapolation process is complicated because chiral perturbation theory is a small mass expansion , but our most accurate numerical data are for large mass .",

    "the two curves are nearly indistinguishable over a wider range , but at the physical pion mass or below , there is clearly a significant difference .",
    "we thus see that the extrapolation can be quite sensitive to which terms are kept in the chiral approximation .    over the past two years",
    ", several groups have been working particularly hard to understand the chiral extrapolations .",
    "the lanl@xcite , milc@xcite , and scri@xcite collaborations have looked at vector mesons and the nucleon .",

    "thus , they have more data and more degrees of freedom when doing their fits .",
    "this allows them more freedom in choosing the range of quark mass included in the chiral fit .",
    "milc , on the other hand , has a very wide range of quark masses in its calculations ( a factor of 16 from lightest to heaviest ) .",
    "however , with five quark masses and only hadrons constructed from equal mass quarks , there is limited freedom to play with the range of mass included in the fits .",
    "one of the difficulties in reviewing the chiral extrapolations is that for quenched calculations hadron masses for different quark masses are correlated . to get a proper goodness of fit for the chiral extrapolation",

    "( it must be admitted , however , that not every group includes these correlations in their chiral extrapolations . )    at lattice 95 , john sloan @xcite presented evidence from the scri collaboration that fits to the @xmath6 mass as a function of the @xmath33 mass can be extended to higher quark mass if either either @xmath34 or @xmath35 is added to @xmath36 .",
    "for instance , with the cubic term , the range @xmath37 can be fit , but without it , the range is 0.580.77 . in terms of @xmath27 , the ranges are very roughly 0.51.3 gev and 0.50.8 gev , respectively .",

    "the ibm continuum extrapolation was based upon the smaller volume , sink 0 , 1 , 2 results .",
    "( that volume is more comparable to the physical volume of their weaker coupling calculations . )",
    "any of the other three results would clearly decrease the fitted slope for @xmath77 and result in a larger value of the ratio at @xmath62 .",
    "et al_.  have performed the continuum extrapolation using their result and the sink 4 , smaller volume result and find 1.38(7 ) in the continuum limit .",
    "clearly , the 5.7 value plays a crucial role in the extrapolation , and having more results at other couplings would improve our understanding .",
    "results other than the ks points denoted by diamonds , wilson points denoted by crosses and the strong coupling ks result all involve an improved gluon action .",
    "the scri results , with six couplings , comprise the most extensive results at this point .",
    "the lattice spacing dependence of the mass ratio is consistent with a quadratic correction .",
    "it is not consistent with a linear dependence .",
    "results for the wilson quark action for these gauge configurations are also available .",
    "most of the other improved glue results fall well below the ks result in ordinary glue ( diamond above @xmath80 ) .",
    "the results for the d234 and d234(2/3 ) actions from alford , klassen and lepage@xcite are promising , but the errors are too large to determine the @xmath3 dependence",
    ". the results from fiebig and woloshyn on the next - nearest - neighbor action may indicate a stronger dependence on @xmath3 , but again it would be useful to have greater precision .",
    "the two points denoted by a fancy cross compare the ordinary kogut - susskind and naik quark actions in the same improved glue configurations .",
    "their proximity indicates that most of the improvement comes from the glue , not from the quark action .",
    "there was not sufficient time in my talk for a discussion of glueballs or exotics ; however , there were some interesting works that should be advertized .",
    "bali presented a poster on new results for glueballs in dynamical wilson quark configurations .",
    "lee and weingarten presented a talk and poster session regarding scalar quarkonium and further evidence that @xmath81 is a glueball .",
    "luo described recent glueball mass calculations done in a hamiltonian formalism .",
    "the ukqcd collaboration has been studying hybrid mesons recently@xcite and two papers appeared shortly before the conference , one being a review by michael@xcite .",
    "toussaint presented a poster session describing recent attempt of the milc collaboration to calculate exotic masses .",
    "also of iterest were two contributions related to the @xmath82 .",
    "massetti described a bermion calculation of the @xmath33-@xmath82 splitting and venkataraman described an @xmath82 calculation done in configurations with @xmath83 , 2 and 4 dynamical staggered quarks .",
    "a great deal of interesting work is being done ( much more than can be adequately described here , so do nt forget to check the www site ) .",
    "we are on the verge of answering some of the questions posed at the beginning of the talk , especially as regards the quenched or valence approximation . to answer those questions will require additional work in order to demonstrate control of systematic errors .",
    "we need :    * very high statistical accuracy ( @xmath84% ) * large volumes * a wide range of quark masses , with special attention to the chiral region and chiral extrapolations * better understanding of relevant terms in the chiral expansion .    various improvement schemes are being pursued , but it is too soon to say which approach is best .",
    "there is certainly considerable evidence for a faster approach to the @xmath85 limit with several schemes .",
    "( although it is not yet clear that all the schemes have the same limit ! ) improvement schemes are supposed to greatly ease the computational burden . if that is so , then a higher degree of statistical accuracy should be expected in such studies .",
    "such accuracy as well as reliable values for the computational effort required for these calculations are necessary to decide which scheme is best .",
