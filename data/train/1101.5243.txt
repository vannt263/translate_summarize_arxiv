    "the two - dimensional allotrope of carbon , namely graphene , has emerged as a very promising electronic material . in monolayer graphene electrons",
    "are described by the dirac equation @xcite . here",
    "we analyze the geometrically induced chemical potential due to confinement ( i.e. the gauge field ) in the dirac equation on a two dimensional sheet since graphene is a two dimensional sheet .",
    "height fluctuations of a graphene layer ( carriers are described by a relativistic equation ) on a rough substrate generate a nonvanishing geometric potential . in this case",
    ", the shape of the graphene sheet is determined by a competition between the interaction of the layer with the rough substrate @xmath0 ( which tends to impose a preferred height ) , the elastic properties of the layer @xmath1 and the electronic energy @xmath2 , which is also a function of geometry : @xmath3    the confining procedure employed here for exploring the electronic properties of graphene goes beyond the standard analysis of the dirac equation in curved geometries @xcite . here",
    "we will employ an alternative approach which is consistent with the heisenberg principle .",
    "on one hand the starting point is the realization that graphene as a one - atom - thick membrane has carriers confined in a two dimensional space trapped in three dimensions .",
    "furthermore the electrons are described by a massless relativistic equation . on the other hand",
    "the wavefunction of a quantum particle is always three dimensional due to the heisenberg uncertainty principle which forbids setting any of the coordinates to zero [ this would lead to indefiniteness in the momentum according to @xmath4 . in this way",
    "any two dimensional quantum motion would have an evanescent off - surface component of the wavefunction which can probe the two dimensional surface for curvature @xcite .",
    "if the graphene sheet is curved , either intrinsically or extrinsically , then the carriers will at least be able to  feel \" this curvature in the form of some mass or effective gauge field .",
    "in fact , curvature of the sheets builds strain and from a microscopic point of view strain has been shown to modify the electronic structure @xcite .",
    "this is a confirmation of the line of thinking presented in this paper .",
    "when interatomic distances are modified due to strain in the underlying lattice caused by curvature , the periodicity is disrupted and the conditions for the application of bloch theorem do not hold .",
    "therefore , standard methods of solution fail to grasp the complexity of the rippling property of graphene .",
    "effectively this means that one has to use a constraining procedure which starts from three dimensions and gradually confines the quantum dynamics onto the surface .",
    "note , for the schrdinger equation the curvature induces an effective ( da costa ) potential @xcite through a confining procedure reducing the dimensionality of the quantum system .",
    "one question stands out : what is the corresponding potential for the relativistic case ?",
    "we have answered this question and illustrated it through graphene . in short ,",
    "the effective potential has a linear dependence on the mean curvature ( @xmath5 ) as opposed to @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the gaussian curvature , in the usual ( or nonrelativistic ) case .",
    "this effect is studied by expanding around the two dimensional space of the graphene sheet for vanishingly small excursions in the third direction .",
    "such a procedure is well known for the schrdinger equation @xcite and we have carried it out in the case of a relativistic equation .",
    "the idea behind this confinement is that an  external force \" gradually compresses the quantum dynamics onto a surface . in the following section we discuss where this force appears from in the case of graphene .",
    "when the excursion in the normal to the surface direction becomes small enough one can take the limit ( the normal to the surface coordinate goes to zero ) and split the original 3 + 1 dimensional relativistic equation into 2 + 1 and 1 + 1 dimensional equations .",
    "the 2 + 1 dimensional equation encodes the quantum dynamics onto the surface and the 1 + 1 dimensional equation describes the behavior of the  evanescent component \" , that is the normal to the surface component of the wavefunction . in this way the heisenberg principle is not violated since in the process described above no setting - to - zero of any coordinate of a",
    "three dimensional wavefunction takes place .    in reducing the dirac equation from 3 + 1 dimensions to 2 + 1 and 1 + 1 dimensional equations",
    "we use the fundamental 2 representation of the clifford algebra @xcite , which is appropriate for the isospin of graphene .",
    "the results of this confining procedure ( sec .",
    "ii ) and its specific applications ( sec .",
    "iii ) are also relevant for other fields of physics where phenomena are described within the framework of dirac theory : chiral spin liquids , quantum hall systems , anyons .",
    "experimental confirmations , as to what is the correct relativistic description of quantum motion on a curved manifold , are important .",
    "graphene presents with an experimental opportunity to answer this question with potential applications to the theory of gravity and its connection to quantum mechanics .",
    "this aspect also motivates us to consider the two - dimensional cross - sections of a wormhole geometry ( sec .",
    "our main findings are summarized in sec .",
    "now let us consider constrained nonrelativistic dynamics described by the schrdinger equation with the extra chemical potential due to confinement@xcite @xmath8 where @xmath9 are the principal curvatures of the surface , @xmath10 is the planck s constant and @xmath11 is the effective mass . here",
    "@xmath5 is the mean curvature and @xmath7 is the gauss curvaure .",
    "note , by virtue of its derivation , this potential stems from the kinetic part of the constrained schrdinger equation , that is in the case of the massless dirac equation geometric potentials stemming from the kinetic part will not vanish .",
    "as is well known , the dirac equation is a  square root \" of the schrdinger equation , meaning that whatever the constrained dirac equation is , we would expect the chemical potential to scale linearly with the curvature since it scales as the square of the curvature in the case of the schrdinger equation .",
    "bending the surface of graphene by a radius @xmath12 and its effect on the @xmath13 orbitals . ]",
    "consider bending the graphene sheet by a radius @xmath14 this will decrease the distance between the orbitals from @xmath15 to @xmath16 , @xmath17\\approx l \\frac{x^2}{6 } , \\qquad x\\simeq \\frac{l}{2r } \\ll 1 .\\ ] ] the decrease in the distance between the orbitals increases the overlap between the two lobes of the @xmath13 orbital , see fig .",
    "[ fig : overlap ] .",
    "the overlap scales as the square of the curvature @xmath18 but this does not necessarily point to an effective chemical potential proportional to the square of the curvature in the dirac equation for the carriers@xcite .    next ,",
    "let us proceed with the derivation .",
    "here we choose to use gauge covariant dirac description for the massless carriers in graphene , both electrons and holes : @xmath19 \\psi(t , q_i ) = 0 , \\ ] ] where @xmath20 are the generalized coordinates of the surface and @xmath21 measures the deviation from the surface in the embedding 3 dimensional space . here",
    "@xmath22 stands for a 3 + 1 dimensional gauge covariant derivative , @xmath23 are curved gamma matrices @xmath24 related to the usual constant matrices @xmath25 by @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the tetrad constructed from the metric tensor . here",
    "@xmath28 is an effective mass term with the following property @xmath29 and @xmath30 is the constraining potential forcing the system onto the surface @xmath31 here a possible model of the confining potential is the charged plate potential @xmath32 since when the electron deviates from the two dimensional world of the sheet it disrupts the charge balance and a coulomb force emerges .",
    "the gauge covariant derivative is defined through its action on a vector field as follows @xmath33 where @xmath34 are the components of a vector potential and @xmath35 are the christoffel symbols of the second kind @xmath36 here @xmath37 is the metric tensor of the embedding space .",
    "this equation is defined in the entire embedding space @xmath38    our goal now is to constrain ( [ eq : dirac3d ] ) onto a surface @xmath39 and separate in two parts : one that describes the relativistic dynamics on the surface and one that describes the dynamics in a direction @xmath21 orthogonal to the surface .",
    "we will treat the off surface dynamics nonrelativistically since as soon as the carriers leave the two dimensional world of the graphene sheet they attain mass ( an adjustable parameter in the confinement model ) and the hexagonal symmetry of the underlying lattice no longer applies indicating the nonrelativistic limit .",
    "this also indicates that the off - surface component of the wavefunction is a scalar which allows separation of variables .    to achieve the above goal we will minimize the action of the dirac equation ( [ eq : dirac3d ] ) @xmath40 \\psi,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the conjugated two component spinor wavefunction is @xmath41 first ,",
    "let us make few transformations .",
    "the volume element in the above action is defined with respect to a moving frame associated to the surface @xmath42 where @xmath43 is a vector normal to the surface .",
    "this coordinate system facilitates the probing of the three dimensional space @xmath44 from the viewpoint of a two dimensional surface @xmath45 for the volume element we obtain @xcite @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 hereafter @xmath49 s are the metric components and @xmath50 is the determinant of the metric associated with the surface @xmath51 @xmath5 is the mean and @xmath7 the gaussian curvature of this surface , respectively .    in this construction",
    "the spinor wavefunction is normalized according to @xmath52 and in order to facilitate the separation of the dynamics into two parts , surface and orthogonal to it , we rewrite the action with the substitution @xmath53 the normalization condition for the new spinor wavefunction @xmath54 is the following @xmath55 and the action is @xmath56 \\frac{\\psi}{\\sqrt{f}}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] now we pull the factor @xmath57 through the gauge covariant derivative . for the corresponding equation of motion",

    ": f ] ) , @xmath62    now the tetrad fields , in the definition of the curved gamma matrices , constructed from the metric tensor ( [ 3dmetric ] ) @xmath63 can be read off    @xmath64    where @xmath65 are the corresponding metric components of ( [ 3dmetric ] ) .",
    "note @xmath66 is constant which means that @xmath67 is constant .",
    "we are now ready to take into account the effect of the constraining potential @xmath68 since when it applies the wavefunction is compressed between two steep potential barriers on both sides of the surface",
    ". the value of the wavefunction will be significantly different from zero only for very small range of values around @xmath69 therefore , we take the limit @xmath70 in all coefficients in the above equation except the terms containing @xmath28 and @xmath71 in this limit the tetrad constructed from the full metric tensor @xmath72 and the curved gamma matrices are defined with respect to the surface metric @xmath73 @xmath74 where the tetrad field @xmath63 is given with respect to the surface metric @xmath49    @xmath75    in the limit we also have @xmath76 and @xmath77 . as a result",
    "we obtain the following equation @xmath78 in coulomb gauge @xmath79 the wavefunction is separable @xmath80 into normal to the surface @xmath81 and tangential @xmath82 part . since @xmath66 is constant ,",
    "so is @xmath67 and the equation is separable @xmath83 here @xmath22 are gauge covariant derivatives defined with respect to the two dimensional metric of the surface @xmath84 the second equation in the case of graphene should be solved in the nonrelativistic limit since it describes the off surface dynamics .",
    "it turns out that the nonrelativistic system tends to extract more information from the manifold than the relativistic one since the relativistic fermion system only probes the surrounding space to first order in the derivatives of the wavefunction , whereas the schrdinger fermions or bosons probe it to second order .",
    "more specifically , the gauss curvature @xmath7 appears only non - relativistically and is related through the gauss - bonet theorem to the topology class of the manifold . in the nonrelativistic limit",
    "this information is returned as higher derivatives of the wavefunction . as a result",
    "the gauss curvature does not appear explicitly in the confining potential for the relativistic case .",
    "now , let us explore a particular example , namely a bump on the surface of graphene .",
    "the bump has a gaussian shape and is rotationally invariant .",
    "the reason we explore this geometry is the fact that it has been discussed previously@xcite and we can compare our results which depend on the confining procedure with the results obtained by postulating the two dimensional dirac equation to which the carriers of graphene are subjected .",
    "it turns out that due to the confining procedure an extra term appears which is proportional to the mean curvature of the surface .",
    "a bump on the graphene surface affects local density of states ( ldos ) as inferred by ( [ eq : h_bump ] ) .",
    "the shaded region is approximately where the mean curvature is at maximum and the ldos should be affected the most . ]    in polar coordinates the surface is given by @xmath85 and is asymptotically flat , @xmath86 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : bump ] ) .",
    "we will use this in order to check if the equation we obtain has the correct limit .",
    "let us denote @xmath87 which leads to the following for the line element @xmath88 dr^2 + r^2 d \\theta,\\ ] ] where @xmath89 $ ] is the polar angle .",
    "the metric is @xmath90    before we derive the dirac equation for the bump we will focus on the flat case which will provide the asymptotic .",
    "the flat case is obtained by taking @xmath91 then the metric reduces to @xmath92 which yields one possible choice for the moving frame @xmath93 @xmath94 the affine connection @xmath95 for this metric has the nonvanishing elements @xmath96 which play a role in computing the spin connection @xcite @xmath97 @xmath98 the spin connection takes part in the two dimensional dirac equation on the metric @xmath99 as follows @xmath100 where @xmath101 ; see the appendix .",
    "finally the flat hamiltonian is @xmath102    now that we know the asymptotic limit we may derive the corresponding hamiltonian for the gaussian bump keeping in mind that due to confinement we have an extra term in the hamiltonian @xmath103 as indicated by equation ( [ dirac_2d_curved ] ) .",
    "this extra term in the 2 representation we are working reduces to @xmath104 due to the properties of the @xmath105 matrices @xcite . in the curved geometry @xmath106,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 are the principal curvatures of the surface .",
    "for the curved metric ( [ g_bump ] ) the moving frame can be given by @xmath107 which together with the affine connection @xmath108 yields for the spin connection @xmath109 finally for the dirac equation describing the carriers in the curved graphene sheet we have @xmath110 \\psi=0,\\ ] ] where @xmath111 is defined through the moving frame ( [ gamma_curved ] ) .",
    "the corresponding hamiltonian is @xmath112 where the magnetic field associated with the gauge field @xmath113 is substantial @xmath114 and for the typical size of the bumps on graphene varies between 0.5 - 3 t. it is straightforward to check the asymptotic form @xmath115 of this hamiltonian and to see that indeed @xmath116 when the bump flattens .",
    "one of the most obvious consequences of this geometric potential ( [ eq : geompotm ] ) is that it shifts the fermi energy . thus controlling graphene",
    "s electronic properties can be achieved not only by doping and creating imperfections in the lattice , but also by _ bending _ .",
    "since we have developed an effective treatment of the massless carriers in graphene for the low - energy electronic properties of curved sheets in the continuum limit , we proceed to apply it to the wormhole geometry@xcite .",
    "our motivation stems from one of the biggest gaps in modern physics , namely the relation between quantum mechanics and general theory of relativity .",
    "constrained quantum systems present us with the opportunity to explore the quantum mechanical consequences of curvature .",
    "the metric of the wormhole is given by    @xmath117    where @xmath118 is the proper time of a static observer , @xmath119 is the proper radial distance at constant time , @xmath120 is the shape function of the wormhole [ @xmath121 is the radius of the throat of the wormhole ] and @xmath122 are spherical polar coordinates .    as is usually the case with quantum systems we are interested in eigenmodes and we fix the time @xmath123 we also consider the case @xmath124 which represents an equatorial cross - section of a three - dimensional wormhole at constant time .",
    "the line element therefore becomes @xmath125 which is precisely equivalent to the line element of the catenoid@xcite @xmath126 note that at any arbitrary cross - section of the three - dimensional wormhole say @xmath127 the line element is @xmath128 where @xmath129.$ ] for the catenoid this will mean only rescaling the radius from @xmath130 to @xmath131 the catenoid with the biggest radius corresponds to the equatorial cross - section , see fig .",
    "[ fig : catenoid ] .     any two - dimensional section ( catenoid ) of a three dimensional wormhole geometry . a large graphene sheet folded like",
    "this may serve as a solid state experimental realization of transport of relativistic particles trough a wormhole . in the process of folding the hexagonal symmetry of the underlying lattice should not be disrupted . ]    in cylindrical coordinates @xmath132 a two dimensional cross - section of a wormhole is given by @xmath133.\\ ] ] the principal curvatures @xmath134 and @xmath135 of this surface are @xmath136    this means that any two dimensional cross - section of a wormhole is a minimal surface @xmath137    since the fermi velocity in graphene is 0.3% of the velocity of light , the mixing of space and time coordinates is negligible .",
    "therefore , the two dimensional catenoid section of the wormhole geometry can be realized through folded graphene providing us with a genuine solid state experiment .",
    "the constrained fermion dynamics we derived for the purposes of obtaining the electronic properties of curved graphene can now be combined with the geometry of the catenoid as an experimental solid state proposition testing the transmission of material particles through a wormhole .",
    "indeed graphene can be shaped as catenoid provided the sheet is big enough so that while bending it one does not destroy the hexagonal symmetry of the underlying lattice and lose the relativistic description@xcite .",
    "the destruction of the hexagonal symmetry can be inferred by the splitting of the g peak in the raman spectra of graphene@xcite .",
    "it appears that due to the vanishing of the mean curvature , no extra potential subjects the relativistic particles heading for a transition  on the other side \" of the wormhole .",
    "the governing equation is the free dirac equation in curvilinear coordinates .",
    "we have demonstrated that due to the essentially three dimensional nature of the carriers of graphene , using a purely two dimensional relativistic description to derive their properties contradicts the heisenberg principle . in order to obtain the correct relativistic equation we employed a gradual confining procedure which produced a geometric potential in the equation of motion . as a result ,",
    "the possibility to open a band gap in a purely mechanical way , simply by _ bending _ the material , is demonstrated .",
    "the result presented here also connects to the properties of quantum systems in the curved space - time of general relativity .",
    "it is interesting to note that due to the coupling of mechanical and electronic degrees of freedom through the geometric gauge potential ( which for nanoscale radii of curvature is substantial ) @xmath138 mechanical vibrations of graphene can induce resonance electronic transitions , since the band gap is proportional to the curvature created by the mechanical oscillation itself .",
    "this can result in a new class of mems and nems based on the geometric properties of graphene .",
    "even more intriguing is the observation that when a graphene membrane in mems and nems is set to oscillate this would result in a time - dependent mean curvature @xmath139 term , which can mechanically drive transitions between and within electronic bands@xcite .",
    "strain induced modification of the electronic properties or ",
    "straintronics \" is clearly an important field of study in graphene .",
    "moreover , the band gap of the material can be tuned in the terahertz region where powerful sources of coherent radiation are much needed in industrial applications involving security aspects and medical scans .",
    "in 2 + 1 flat dimensions the fundamental 2 representation of the @xmath105 matrices is satisfied by @xmath140 for @xmath141 here @xmath142    they obey the following relations @xmath143 = 0\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
