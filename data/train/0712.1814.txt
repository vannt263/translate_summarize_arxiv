    "is @xmath2 partially made of gluonium ? to answer this question we perform a phenomenological analysis of radiative @xmath0 and @xmath1 decays , with @xmath6 and @xmath7 , in order to determine the gluonic content of the @xmath2 wave function .",
    "similar analyses were driven in the seminal work by rosner @xcite , where the allowed gluonic admixture in the @xmath2 could not be established due to the lack of data on @xmath8 , and , later on , by kou who pointed out that the @xmath2 gluonic component might be as large as 26% @xcite .",
    "more recently , the study by c.  e.  thomas over a large number of different processes concludes that while the data hint at a small gluonic component in the @xmath2 , the results depend sensitively on unknown form factors associated with exclusive dynamics @xcite .    from the experimental side ,",
    "the kloe collaboration , combining the new measurement of @xmath9 with other constraints , has estimated the gluonium content of the @xmath2 meson as @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "this new result contrasts with the former value @xmath11 , which was compatible with zero and consistent with a gluonium fraction below 15% @xcite .",
    "the sole difference between the two analyses is the inclusion in the amplitudes of ref .",
    "@xcite of two extra parameters to deal with the overlap of the vector and pseudoscalar meson wave functions produced in the transitions @xmath0 or @xmath1 , a feature first introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite . however , the new analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite uses the most recent experimental data taken from ref .",
    "@xcite in association with the values for the parameters related to the overlap which were obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite from a fit to available experimental data at that time .",
    "therefore , a reanalysis of this uncomfortable situation is needed before drawing definite conclusions on the gluon content of the @xmath2 meson .",
    "this is the main motivation of the present work . a more extensive version including a detailed analysis also for the case of the @xmath12 , the effects of considering the newest ( not reported in the pdg ) data , a comparison with other approaches , and a discussion of the @xmath13 decays within this context can be found in ref .",
    "we will work in a basis consisting of the states @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "the physical states @xmath12 and @xmath2 are assumed to be linear combinations of these : @xmath17 with @xmath18 and thus @xmath19 . a significant gluonic admixture in a state is possible only if @xmath20 @xcite .",

    "_ no mixing with @xmath21 , and neglects other possible admixtures from @xmath22 states and/or radial excitations . an interesting situation occurs when the gluonium content of the @xmath12 meson is assumed to vanish , @xmath23 . in this particular case",

    "we will work in a conventional quark model where pseudoscalar and vector mesons are simple quark - antiquark @xmath35-wave bound states with characteristic spatial extensions fixed by their respective quark - antiquark @xmath36 or @xmath37 wave functions .",
    "we take the good @xmath38 limit with @xmath39 and with identical spatial extension of wave functions within each @xmath36 and each @xmath37 isomultiplet .",
    "@xmath40 will be broken in the usual manner taking constituent quark masses with @xmath41 but also , and this is a specific feature of our approach , allowing for different spatial extensions for each @xmath36 and @xmath37 isomultiplet .",
    "finally , we will consider that @xmath33 transitions fully respect the usual ozi - rule .",
    "in our specific case of @xmath33 @xmath34 transitions , these generic statements translate into three characteristic ingredients of the model : _",
    "i ) _ a @xmath33 magnetic dipole transition proceeds via quark or antiquark spin - flip amplitudes proportional to @xmath42 . this effective magnetic moment breaks @xmath40 in a well defined way and distinguishes photon emission from strange or non - strange quarks via @xmath41 ; _ ii ) _ the spin - flip @xmath43 conversion amplitude has then to be corrected by the relative overlap between the @xmath36 and @xmath37 wave functions ; _ iii ) _ indeed , the ozi - rule reduces considerably the possible transitions and their respective @xmath44 wave - function overlaps : @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 characterize the @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 spatial overlaps , respectively .",
    "notice that distinction is made between the @xmath51 and @xmath52 spatial extension due to the gluon or @xmath53 anomaly .",

    "we leave the @xmath60 s free and allow for gluonium in the @xmath2 wave function only .",
    "this will permit us to fix the gluonic content of the @xmath2 in a way identical to the experimental measurement by kloe , that is , under the hypothesis of no gluonium in the @xmath12 wave function .",
    "unfortunately , a simultaneous fit of the @xmath60 s and the gluonic admixture in the @xmath12 _ and _ @xmath2 is not possible .",

    "the remaining parameters are taken from eq .",
    "( [ zphipphietapg ] ) .",
    "in addition to the bands , we have also plotted the circular boundary denoting the constraint @xmath102 as well as the favoured region for the @xmath12-@xmath2 mixing angle assuming the _ absence of gluonium _ , @xmath103 , obtained at @xmath89 from the corresponding fitted value in eq .",
    "( [ zphip ] ) . there exists an intersection region of the three bands inside and on the circumference .",
    "as most of this region is interior but close to the circular boundary it may well indicate a small but non necessarily zero gluonic content of the @xmath2 . indeed , we have found @xmath3 ( or @xmath104 ) or using the angular description @xmath5 .",
    "the size of the error is precisely what prevent us from drawing a definite conclusion concerning the amount of gluonium in the @xmath2 wave function .",

    "the point corresponding to the preferred solution , @xmath109 , is also shown .",
    "the allowed region is very constrained in the @xmath28 axis by the experimental value of the @xmath110 coupling , whose vertical band denotes its non dependence on @xmath105 .",
    "the other three bands , all dependent on @xmath28 and @xmath105 , constrain the amount of gluonium down to a value compatible with zero at @xmath89 .",
    "in this work we have performed a phenomenological analysis of radiative @xmath0 and @xmath1 decays with the purpose of determining the gluon content of the @xmath2 meson .",
    "the present approach is based on a conventional @xmath40 quark model supplemented with two sources of @xmath40 breaking , the use of constituent quark masses with @xmath111 and the different spatial extensions for each @xmath36 or @xmath37 isomultiplet which induce different overlaps between the @xmath36 and @xmath37 wave functions .",
    "the use of these different overlapping parameters a specific feature of our analysis is shown to be of primary importance in order to reach a good agreement .",
    "our conclusions are the following .",
    "first , accepting the absence of gluonium for the @xmath12 meson , the current experimental data on @xmath33 transitions indicate within our model a negligible gluonic content for the @xmath2 meson , @xmath3 .",
    "second , this gluonic content of the @xmath2 wave function amounts to @xmath5 and the @xmath12-@xmath2 mixing angle is found to be @xmath4 .",
    "third , imposing the absence of gluonium for both mesons one finds @xmath112 , in agreement with the former result .",
    "finally , we would like to stress that more refined experimental data , particularly for the @xmath8 channel , will contribute decisively to clarify this issue .",
