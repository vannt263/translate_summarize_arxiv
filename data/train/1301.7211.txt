    "the study of relationships between the theory of isomonodromic deformations and the theory of differential equations satisfying the so - called painlev property is a well - established branch of the analytic theory of differential equations in complex domain ( see below a brief summary of the most important results obtained in this direction ) .",
    "one of the outputs of the present paper suggests that the above mentioned relationship is less straightforward than it was traditionally believed .",

    "our observation is that eq .",

    "however , this equation does not satisfy the painlev property as its general solution has third order branch points of the form @xmath4 ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) where the location of the branch points depends on the choice of the solution ( the so - called _ movable critical singularities _ ) .    in spite of such a somewhat surprising phenomenon the method of isomonodromic deformations proves to be almost as powerful in the study of solutions to the equation [ pi21 ] as in the case of classical painlev equations .",
    "namely , it is possible to derive the large @xmath1 asymptotics of solutions and , moreover , to describe the branching locus of a given solution in terms of a kind of a spectral problem for a quintic anharmonic oscillator .",
    "the equation [ pi21 ] is of interest on its own .",
    "namely , it describes the behavior of poles of solutions to another fourth order ode @xmath5 usually denoted as .",
    "it is the second member of the so - called  hierarchy .",
    "the coefficients of this equation depend on @xmath1 as on a parameter .",
    "it is well known ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) that the equation is compatible with the korteweg - de vries ( kdv ) dynamics @xmath6 the laurent expansion of solutions @xmath7 to the system , near a pole @xmath8 has the form @xmath9 where the function @xmath10 solves eq .",

    "associates a multivalued solution @xmath10 to eq .",

    "thus , the above mentioned isomonodromy realization of eq . [ pi21 ] provides one with a tool for studying the kdv dynamics of poles of solutions to the  equation .",
    "particular solutions to the  equation are of interest .",
    "we will concentrate our attention on one of them , namely , the one that has no poles on the real axis @xmath11 ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite about importance of this special solution to the eq . ) .",
    "such a solution @xmath12 exists @xcite for any real @xmath1 and it is uniquely determined by its asymptotic behavior for large @xmath13 . using the developed techniques along with the isomonodromic description @xcite of the special solution to",
    ", we arrive at the asymptotic description for large @xmath1 of poles of this special solution .    before proceeding to the formulation of main results",
    "let us first briefly recall the basic notions of the present paper , namely the painlev property and the isomonodromic deformations . in the description of the historical framework we will manly follow the paper @xcite .      in 1866",
    ", l.  fuchs @xcite has shown that all the singular points of solutions to a linear ode are among the singularities of its coefficients and thus are independent from the initial conditions . in the nonlinear case ,",
    "the reasonable problem is to look for odes defining the families of functions , called the _",
    "general solutions _ , which can be meromorphically extended to the universal covering space of a punctured riemann surface with the punctures determined by the equation .",
    "in other words , the problem is to find odes whose general solutions are free from the branch points and essential singularities depending on the specific choice of the initial data .",
    "this property is called now the _",
    "painlev property _ , or the _ analytic painlev property _ , and is obviously shared not only by the linear odes but also by the odes for elliptic functions .    in @xcite , l.",
    "fuchs started the classification of the first order polynomial in @xmath14 and @xmath15 odes , @xmath16 , with single - valued in @xmath17 coefficients with respect to the painlev property .",
    "h.  poincar @xcite and p.  painlev @xcite accomplished the analysis not finding new transcendental functions .    in @xcite ,",
    "p.  painlev revisited the l.  fuchs idea extending the program of classification to the second order odes of the form @xmath18 with @xmath19 meromorphic in @xmath17 and rational in @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "in the course of classification of the 2nd order 1st degree odes modulo the mbius transformation @xcite , it was found 50 equations which pass the painlev @xmath20-test and thus called now the _",
    "gambier equations_. it occurs that all these equations can be either integrated in terms of the classical linear transcendents , or elliptic functions , or reduce to one of the six exceptional _ classical painlev equations _ .",
    "the monodromy group to a linear ode was first considered by b.  riemann @xcite , h.  schwarz @xcite and h.  poincar @xcite .",
    "apparently , it was l.  fuchs in @xcite who for the first time set the problem of the deformations of the coefficients in a linear equation that leave the monodromy group unchanged .",
    "namely , assuming that solutions of a linear ode depend on an additional variable , he obtained a system of the first order pdes the solutions must satisfy .",
    "more modern treatment of the isomonodromy deformations was developed by r.  fuchs in @xcite .",
    "he has shown that the monodromy group of a scalar linear ode with four fuchsian singularities at @xmath21 and an apparent singular point at @xmath22 does not depend on the location @xmath17 of the fourth fuchsian singular point if the location of the apparent singularity @xmath14 depends on @xmath17 according to a nonlinear 2nd order ode .",
    "later , the fuchs isomonodromic deformation equation was included as the sixth painlev equation  into the list of the classical painlev equations .    in 1912 , l.  schlesinger @xcite generalized the fuchs approach finding the equations of the isomonodromic deformations for arbitrary linear fuchsian odes , while r.  garnier @xcite presented the scalar second order linear odes with irregular singular points whose isomonodromic deformations are governed by the lower classical painlev equations . in 1980 , m.  jimbo , t.  miwa and k.  ueno @xcite extended the theory of garnier to the linear odes with generic irregular singularities .",
    "it is interesting that to the date of the mentioned above achievements , the fact that these equations do indeed possess the painlev property was not proved rigorously even for the case of the classical painlev equations .",
    "thus the term `` painlev equation '' loosely refers to various equations among which we mention the higher order odes in hierarchies associated with the classical painlev equations , the higher order odes in the classifications by f.  bureau @xcite and c.  cosgrove @xcite based on the use of some painlev tests , as well as the differential , difference , @xmath23-difference and elliptic - difference equations found in the course of the study of the symmetries and geometry of the classical painlev equations , see e.g.  @xcite and @xcite .",
    "a general elegant approach to the painlev property of the equations of the isomonodromic deformations was presented by t.  miwa @xcite and b.  malgrange @xcite in the early 80s of the last century ( recall that the direct proof of the painlev property of the classical painlev equations appeared even later , see @xcite ) .",
    "the approach by t.  miwa and b.  malgrange is based on the use of the zero curvature representation and the riemann ",
    "hilbert correspondence .",
    "in fact , they have proved the analytic painlev property of the isomonodromic deformation equations for arbitrary linear fuchsian odes and for equations with unbranched irregular singular points . in this respect",
    "we also mention the papers of m.  inaba and m.  saito @xcite who developed an algebro - geometric approach to the _ geometric painlev property _ of the isomonodromic deformations of the logarithmic and unramified irregular connections which also implies their analytic painlev property .",
    "one can expect that the isomonodromy deformation equations for arbitrary rational connections possess the painlev property .",
    "however , the nave induction does not work .",
    "namely , and this is our first result , we show that the polynomial in all variables 4th order 1st degree ode governs the isomonodromic deformations of the following linear differential equation with polynomial coefficients @xmath24 here @xmath2 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 are some smooth functions .",
    "the monodromy of the stokes multipliers of the system - see below .",
    "] of the system does not depend on @xmath1 if and only if the coefficients have the form @xmath27 a ' + a-40 \\alpha_3 ^ 0 t + \\alpha_1 ^ 0 \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\alpha_0=-\\frac9{20 } a'''-\\frac{54}5 { a'}^4 + 432 \\alpha_3 ^ 0 { a'}^3 + 18 \\left [ t-330 ( \\alpha_3 ^ 0)^2   - \\alpha_2 ^ 0 \\right]{a'}^2 \\nonumber\\\\ & & + 3\\left [   a -130 \\alpha_3 ^ 0 t + 10800 ( \\alpha_3 ^",

    "so , our claim is that the equation [ pi21 ] describes the isomonodromic deformations of the system but , however , it does not possess the painlev property as being satisfied by a 4-parameter puiseux series in powers of @xmath33 .",
    "nevertheless , as we show , this equation can be effectively analyzed using the isomonodromy deformation techniques developed during last decades .",
    "in particular , the ramification points @xmath34 ( see eq .",
    "above ) can be determined by a kind of a spectral problem for the quintic anharmonic oscillator @xmath35 here @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 are the coefficients of the puiseaux expansion of @xmath10 ( see eq . below ) .",
    "namely , the coefficients of the quintic polynomial must be chosen in such a way that the equation possesses solutions exponentially decaying on certain contours in the complex plane , look for details in remark  [ scattering_problem ] .    in section  2",
    "we discuss the second member of the   hierarchy , equation , as an equation that describes the isomonodromic solutions to the kdv equation , and find a nonlinear ode , equation , that controls its pole dynamics . in section  3",
    ", we derive the above isomonodromic representation for the eq .  presenting a regularization of the linear system for  along its singularity locus . in section  4 ,",
    "we consider the puiseux series solution for  and the singularity reduction of the corresponding linear system at the branch points . in section  5",
    ", we set the riemann ",
    "hilbert problems for all the previously introduced wave functions and discuss existence and uniqueness of their solutions . in section  6 ,",
    "we present the asymptotic analysis of the riemann ",
    "hilbert problems corresponding to a physically interesting special solution of  and  implementing the steepest - descent method introduced by deift and zhou .",
    "our main result in this section is the description of the large @xmath1 asymptotics of the singularity locus as a theta - divisor on a modulated elliptic curve , @xmath39 where @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 , the function @xmath43 is determined by equations  , @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the period integrals on the elliptic curve . in section  7 , we find explicitly the pole dynamics of the special solution in a vicinity of the attracting point @xmath46 , @xmath47{3}}{2\\sqrt[4]{5}\\sqrt{7 } } \\ln\\bigl ( t^{-7/4}(m+\\tfrac{1}{2})\\tfrac{3^{11/4}}{2^{6}5^{3/4}7^{5/2}e } \\bigr ) \\\\ + i\\pi(n+\\tfrac{1}{2})\\tfrac{\\sqrt[4]{3}}{\\sqrt[4]{5}\\sqrt{7 } } + { \\mathcal o}(t^{-7/2}\\ln^2t),\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where @xmath41 and @xmath40 enumerate the points of the pole lattice .",

    "<S> we show that the fourth order nonlinear ode which controls the pole dynamics in the general solution of equation compatible with the kdv equation exhibits two remarkable properties : 1 )  it governs the isomonodromy deformations of a @xmath0 matrix linear ode with polynomial coefficients , and 2 )  it does not possesses the painlev property . </S>",
    "<S> we also study the properties of the riemann  hilbert problem associated to this ode and find its large @xmath1 asymptotic solution for the physically interesting initial data . </S>"
