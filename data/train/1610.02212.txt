    "in @xcite watkins ( 1969 ) first introduced the gpgs to discover tait coloring of the graphs and castagna and prins ( 1972 ) proved watkins conjecture about gpgs in @xcite .",
    "after they introduced gpgs , some properties of gpgs have been studied .",
    "for instance , alspach ( 1983 ) determined which gpgs have a hamilton cycle in @xcite .",
    "fu , yang and jiang ( 2009 ) studied the domination number of gpgs in @xcite .",
    "now we define double generalized petersen graphs dp@xmath0 ( dgpg for short ) as follows .",
    "let @xmath1 and @xmath2 be integers that satisfy @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "the double generalized petersen graph dp@xmath0 is an undirected simple graph with vertex set @xmath5 and edge set @xmath6 , where @xmath7    note that @xmath8 denotes a set of integers @xmath9 throughout this paper .    ]",
    "zhou and feng ( 2012 ) first introduced the double generalized petersen graphs by modifying the generalized petersen graphs in @xcite . in @xcite , zhou and feng ( 2014 ) determined all non - cayley vertex - transitive graphs and all vertex - transitive graphs among dgpgs . from their result ,",
    "kutnar and petecki ( 2016 ) gave the complete classification of automorphism groups of dgpgs in @xcite .",
    "they also proved that dp@xmath0 is hamiltonian if @xmath1 is even or @xmath1 is odd and the greatest common divisor of @xmath1 and @xmath2 equals to @xmath10 in @xcite .",
    "in addition , a computer - assisted search verified that dp@xmath11 have hamilton cycles for all @xmath12 and they conjectured that all dp@xmath0 are hamiltonian .",
    "this paper gives the following theorem .",
    "[ thm ] all dp@xmath0 are hamiltonian .",
    "as mentioned in the previous section , @xmath8 denotes a set of integers @xmath9 . a sequence of vertices @xmath13 denotes a path in a graph . a path whose end points are the same vertex is called a cycle .",
    "@xmath14 denotes the vertex set of a graph @xmath15 .",
    "let @xmath15 be an arbitrary subgraph of dp@xmath0 .",
    "we define functions @xmath16 as follows .",
    "we assume that @xmath1 is even . in this case ,",
    "kutnar and petecki showed that all dp@xmath11 are hamiltonian in @xcite .",
    "observe that there exist paths @xmath18 for all @xmath19 .",
    "@xmath20 joining all of the paths gives a hamilton cycle in dp@xmath11 .",
    "we assume that @xmath1 is odd .",
    "let @xmath21 be the greatest common divisor of @xmath1 and @xmath2 . in order to construct a hamilton cycle in dp@xmath0 , we define paths @xmath22 for all @xmath23 .",
    "@xmath24 where @xmath25 satisfy the following conditions @xmath26 for instance , if @xmath27 , the above conditions are met . joining the paths in the following way gives a hamilton cycle in dp@xmath11 .",
    "@xmath28    an example of a hamilton cycle in dp@xmath0 is shown in figure [ fig : cycle ] .",
    "in this section , we prove that the cycle described in the previous section contains all vertices of dp@xmath11 exactly once for all odd integers @xmath3 .",
    "let @xmath15 be dp@xmath0 and @xmath30 be the greatest common divisor of @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "secondly , we will prove that paths @xmath38 contain all of @xmath39 .",
    "we define cycles @xmath40 in dp@xmath0 for all @xmath23 .",
    "@xmath41 note that odd integers @xmath42 and @xmath43 satisfy @xmath44 and @xmath45 . for all @xmath23",
    ", @xmath40 consists of paths @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "since @xmath42 is odd , the last vertex of @xmath48 is not @xmath49 but @xmath50 . by symmetry",
    ", the last vertex of @xmath51 is @xmath49 .",
    "in addition , @xmath50 and @xmath49 are respectively adjacent to @xmath52 and @xmath53 since @xmath54 is a multiple of @xmath1 .",
    "observe that @xmath55 contain no two same vertices since @xmath56 is the least common multiple of @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "hence @xmath57 also contain no two same vertices .      observe that both @xmath61 and @xmath62 are subgraphs of @xmath40 . for all @xmath23 , @xmath61 and @xmath35",
    "share no vertex and contain all vertices in @xmath40 since the first vertex of @xmath61 and the last vertex of @xmath61 are respectively adjacent to the first vertex of @xmath62 and the last vertex of @xmath62 .",
    "therefore , paths @xmath38 contain all of @xmath39 .",
    "this completes the proof of theorem [ thm ] ."
