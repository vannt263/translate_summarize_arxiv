    "the cf is one of the most popular statistical tools used to quantify the degree of galaxy clustering .",
    "it also has been used to characterize the dependence of the galaxy clustering on the properties of galaxies for example morphology @xcite , surface brightness , luminosity and internal dynamics .",
    "+ generally , the cf is fit within the range @xmath8 1.5 - 2.3 and @xmath7 5 - 7.5 @xmath4 mpc for optically - selected galaxies , where @xmath9 = 100 @xmath10 km s@xmath11 mpc@xmath11 . the data being used for analyzing the cf here",
    "is hipass bgc [ 6 ] , which includes the 1,000 hi brightest galaxies from hi parkes all sky survey ( hipass ; [ 1 ] ) .",
    "the survey is the largest , least - biased survey of large - scale structure in hi - selected galaxies . since the survey has been done in radio regime so it can easily image through the milky way plane unlike optical or infrared surveys .",
    "approximately 70% of the new galaxies have been found in the zone of avoidance @xmath12 .",
    "the hipass survey has imaged the entire southern sky and 40% of northern sky using the parkes multibeam receiver .",
    "the survey has been looking for galactic and extragalactic neutral hydrogen ( hi ) and is sensitive to a volumn of six million cubic mpc .",
    "this survey is expected to eventually cataloque about 10,000 galaxies .",
    "the hipass bgc includes the 1,000 hi - brightest galaxies ( @xmath13 ) according to their hi peak flux in the global hi spectrum ( peak@xmath14 117 mjy / beam ) with a systemic velocity 350 - 8,000 km / s .",
    "all known galaxies with systemic velocity @xmath15 350 km / s have been added in the sample .",
    "figure 1a shows distribution of hipass bgc as a function distance , with the selection function multiplied by area , @xmath16 .",
    "the peak of distribution is around 13 @xmath4 mpc .",
    "two estimators have been used for analyzing the cf in hipass bgc : @xmath17    where @xmath18 refers to davis & peebles estimator @xcite and @xmath19 is hamilton estimator @xcite .",
    "@xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the number of data - data , data - random and random - random pairs respectively . comparing these two estimators ,",
    "@xmath19 is less affected by the uncertainty in the mean density , which is a second order effect . nonetheless , even though @xmath18 explicitly depends on the mean density , it is the most commonly used estimator . in this analysis ,",
    "both estimators have been weighted with the selection function , @xmath23 , and 20,000 random galaxies have been generated to match @xmath23 . + figure 1b shows a plot of @xmath0 for @xmath18 with poisson error bars .",
    "however this can be improved by using bootstrap method in the future work ( with deep hipass catalogue ) .",
    "it can be fit by @xmath24 ( @xmath25/@xmath26)@xmath27 with @xmath2 and @xmath3 @xmath4 mpc .",
    "when using @xmath19 , @xmath0 is fit by the same form with @xmath5 and @xmath6 @xmath4 mpc .",
    "these results definitely show less clustering than other optical selected surveys e.g. cfa redshift survey @xcite with @xmath28 and @xmath29 @xmath4 mpc , or stromlo - apm with @xmath30 and @xmath31 @xmath4 mpc @xcite .",
    "clearly , the cf from the hipass bgc shows less clustering than other existing surveys .",
    "however this result is expected , as hi - selected galaxies trace late - type galaxies which tend to avoid the densest region .",
    "correspondingly , this result supports the morphology - density relation which was first described by dressler @xcite",
    ". it will be interesting to see how the cf changes with deep hipass catalogue ( available late 2001 ) which will contain @xmath32 8,000 - 10,000 galaxies .",
