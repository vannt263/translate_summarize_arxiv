    "molecules are a ubiquitous component of the dense interstellar medium . to date",
    ", about one hundred distinct species have been detected in the interstellar gas ( ohishi 1997 ) ; they range from simple diatomic molecules to complex species containing as many as thirteen atoms .",
    "the wide variety of interstellar molecules demonstrates the thermodynamic tendency of most elements to form molecules under the conditions present in the dense interstellar medium .",
    "although most of the interstellar molecules that have been detected previously contain elements of cosmic abundance greater than @xmath15 , a few molecules containing elements of lower abundance have also been detected .",
    "for example , chlorine , with a solar system abundance of only 2@xmath16 relative to hydrogen ( anders & grevesse 1989 ) , was detected more than a decade ago in the form of hydrogen chloride ( blake , keene & phillips 1985 ) .",
    "recent estimates ( neufeld & green 1994 ; schilke , phillips & wang 1995 ; zmuidzinas et al .",
    "1995a ) of the hcl abundances implied by observations of the hcl @xmath17 line toward sgr b2 ( zmuidzinas et al .",
    "1995a ) and the orion molecular cloud 1 ( blake et al .",
    "1985 ; schilke et al .",
    "1995 ) have yielded results for @xmath18 in the range 0.3  2 @xmath19 .",
    "if the elemental abundance of chlorine in these sources is the same as that in the solar system , then hcl accounts for only @xmath20 of the total number of chlorine nuclei .",
    "theoretical models for the chemistry of chlorine - bearing molecules ( schilke et al .",
    "1995 ) predict that hcl will account for @xmath21 of gas - phase chlorine .",
    "thus the observed abundance of hcl can only be understood if the chlorine depletion in the dense ism is large .",
    "the required depletion factors of @xmath22 greatly exceed the values inferred for the _ diffuse _ ism from uv absorption line studies ( e.g.  harris , gry , & bromage 1984 ) .",
    "prior to the observations reported in this letter , hcl was the only known _",
    "interstellar _ molecule containing a halogen element .",
    "motivated by the earlier observations of hcl , by the fact that the solar system abundance of fluorine lies only a factor of 6 below that of chlorine ( anders & grevesse 1989 ) , and by the large h  f bond strength which suggests that hydrogen fluoride is likely to be a major reservoir of gas - phase fluorine ,",
    "we have undertaken a search for interstellar hydrogen fluoride toward the strong far - infrared continuum source sgr b2 .",
    "such a search would provide a unique probe of the chemistry of interstellar fluorine and of the fluorine depletion in the dense interstellar medium . because of its large rotational constant  the largest of any diatomic molecule other than molecular hydrogen or heh@xmath23  hf possesses a rotational spectrum that lies entirely shortward of the atmospheric windows within which most molecules show a rotational spectrum .",
    "observations of hf rotational transitions are therefore possible only from airplane or space - based observatories .",
    "we have made use of the long wavelength spectrometer ( lws ; clegg et al .",
    "1996 ) on board the infrared space observatory ( iso ; kessler et al.1996 ) to search for hydrogen fluoride .",
    "the @xmath17 transition of hf lies longward of the wavelength range to which the photoconductive detectors used in lws are sensitive , so we have carried out observations of the @xmath1 line at 121.6973 @xmath0 m .",
    "these observations are described in  2 below .",
    "our results are presented in  3 , and discussed in  4 .",
    "the detection of hydrogen fluoride reported here marks the first discovery of an _ interstellar _ molecule containing the element fluorine and the first time that a new astrophysical molecule has been identified by means of observations in the far - infrared ( 30  300 @xmath0 m ) spectral region .",
    "using the lws of iso in fabry - perot mode at a resolving power @xmath24 of 9600 , we observed the @xmath1 line of hf toward the source sgr b2 on 1997 march 28th .",
    "the rest frequency of the line is @xmath25 ( nolt et al .",
    "1987 ) , corresponding to a vacuum wavelength of 121.6973  @xmath0 m . unlike hcl",
    ", hf shows no electric quadrupole hyperfine structure , and the magnetic hyperfine splitting is far smaller than the intrinsic width of any astrophysical absorption line .",
    "the iso beam , of approximate diameter @xmath26 fwhm , was centered midway between sgr b2(m ) and sgr b2(n ) , at coordinates @xmath27 , @xmath28 ( j2000 ) .",
    "the observation , which covered the wavelength range 121.63  121.80 @xmath0 m , was carried out in fast scanning mode with 8 spectral samples per resolution element .",
    "the total integration time was 2549 seconds .",
    "the initial data reduction was carried out with version 6.1 of the iso pipeline software .",
    "the isap software package was then used to remove bad data points , to co - add the individual spectral scans , and to derive estimates of the likely statistical error for each flux measurement from the variance of the individual scans .",
    "the resultant spectrum showed a continuum flux level that varied by @xmath29% over the narrow wavelength range covered .",
    "this behavior , which has been widely observed in lws fabry - perot spectra , is caused by the grating that is used as an order sorter for the fabry - perot etalon .",
    "due to errors in the grating setting , the grating wavelength is sometimes offset slightly from the central wavelength of the fabry - perot scan , thereby superimposing an asymmetric envelope on the measured spectrum and compromising the absolute flux calibration .",
    "that envelope was fit with a second order polynomial , and the absolute flux calibration was obtained from a spectrum taken in the grating mode of lws immediately after the fabry - perot scan .",
    "figure 1 shows the lws spectrum observed toward sgr b2 , normalized with respect to the measured continuum flux of @xmath30 jy .",
    "we used a @xmath31 analysis to fit the observed spectrum and assess the statistical significance of lines that we detected .",
    "our analysis makes the implicit assumption that the errors in the fluxes measured at each spectral point are gaussian and independent .",
    "we approximated the spectral response function of the fabry - perot instrument as a lorentzian with a width corresponding to the nominal resolving power @xmath24 of 9600 ( trams , clegg & swinyard 1996 ) ; and we assumed that the astrophysical absorption feature was narrow compared to the instrumental profile , as suggested by the intrinsic line widths measured for hcl ( zmuidzinas et al .",
    "1995a ) .",
    "fitting a single absorption feature to the spectrum , and with a quadratic fit to continuum as described in  2 above , we obtained an absorption line equivalent width of @xmath3  nm and a central lsr velocity of 67 km s@xmath32 for the 121.6973 @xmath0 m hf line .",
    "the measured lsr velocity is in excellent agreement with the centroid velocity observed by zmuidzinas et al .",
    "( 1995a ) for the hcl @xmath17 line in sgr b2 .",
    "our detection of an absorption feature is statistically significant at the @xmath33 level .",
    "in addition to the absorption feature that we attribute to hf , we find evidence at a lower level of statistical significance ( @xmath7 ) for an emission feature near the expected position ( for @xmath34 67 km s@xmath32 ) of the @xmath8 line of water , which has a rest wavelength of 121.7219  @xmath0 m ( toth 1991 ) .",
    "the emission line equivalent width is @xmath9  nm . with the water emission line included in the fit , the reduced @xmath31 is 0.98 ( with 108 degrees of freedom ) .",
    "our identification of the absorption feature in figure 1 with hf @xmath1 is based upon ( 1 ) the excellent agreement of the observed line position with the expected position of the hf line ; and ( 2 ) the absence of any other astrophysically plausible candidate in available line catalogues .",
    "notwithstanding these considerations , the detection of additional hf lines would be desirable as a confirmation of this identification .",
    "unfortunately , according to the excitation model discussed below , we do not expect absorption lines higher than @xmath1 to be strong enough to be detected by the iso spectrometers .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath17 transition near 243.2  @xmath0 m lies longward of the spectral region that is observable with the photoconductive detectors used in lws .",
    "fortunately , the earth s atmosphere permits observations of hf @xmath17 from airplane altitude : that line , with a large predicted equivalent width @xmath35  nm , will therefore be a prime target for observations with instrumentation for longer wavelengths that has been proposed for the stratospheric observatory of infrared astronomy ( sofia ) .",
    "observations of hf @xmath17 will also be possible with instrumentation proposed for the far infrared and submillimetre telescope ( first ) .    in deriving a hydrogen fluoride abundance from the observed equivalent width of the @xmath1 line , we have made use of an excitation model to determine the fractional level populations as a function of position within the source .",
    "our model is essentially identical to that used by zmuidzinas et al .",
    "( 1995a ) to model the excitation of hcl in sgr b2 .",
    "the temperature and h@xmath5 density in the source are assumed to vary with the radial coordinate @xmath36  pc according to @xmath37 @xmath38 for an assumed dust opacity that varies with wavelength as @xmath39 , these temperature and density profiles yield a predicted dust continuum spectrum that is in excellent agreement with the observations . because of the large dipole moment ( 1.826 debye ; muenter 1972 ) and large rotational constant ( @xmath40 ) of the hf molecule ,",
    "the critical density at which collisional processes become important in the excitation of hf @xmath41 is very much larger ( @xmath42 ) than the density of the gas ( @xmath43 \\rm \\sim 10 ^ 5\\,cm^{-3}$ ] ) that we sampled in our observations of sgr b2 .",
    "thus the excitation of hf is dominated by the effects of radiative pumping by dust continuum radiation .",
    "the radiative transfer was treated using the method of accelerated lambda iteration ( rybicki & hummer 1991 ) , and the line equivalent width obtained as a function of the hf abundance . in the absence of available collisional data for hf",
    ", we adopted as the rate coefficients for collisional de - excitation those computed previously for the de - excitation of hcl by he ( neufeld & green 1994 ) ; fortunately , because radiative pumping dominates the excitation of hf in sgr b2 , our results are almost entirely independent of the assumed collisional rate coefficients .",
    "on the basis of this model , we found that the observed equivalent width of @xmath3  nm corresponds to an abundance @xmath44 .",
    "the predicted equivalent width shows a nearly linear dependence on the assumed hf abundance ( equivalent width @xmath45 abundance@xmath46 ) for abundances in the range @xmath47 .",
    "figure 2 shows the fractional level populations in @xmath48 , 1 , 2 and 3 as a function of radial coordinate for a hydrogen fluoride abundance of @xmath49 .",
    "observations of the @xmath1 absorption line sample the region exterior to an effective photosphere at @xmath50 .",
    "we also modeled the excitation of the h@xmath5o @xmath8 line that is evident in the spectrum at a lower level of statistical significance .",
    "for the case of water , an excitation model had previously been developed to account for the observed strengths ( zmuidzinas 1995b ; gensheimer , mauersberger & wilson 1996 ) of the @xmath51 and @xmath52 emission lines of h@xmath53o and the @xmath54 absorption line of h@xmath53o toward sgr b2 .",
    "the temperature and h@xmath5 density profiles assumed in that model were identical to those adopted for the hf and hcl excitation models . to fit the measured fluxes of all three lines , a variable water abundance must be assumed , with a smaller water abundance @xmath55 in the cooler outer parts of the source ( @xmath56  k ; @xmath57 ) , and a larger water abundance of @xmath10 in the warmer inner regions ( i.e.  the `` hot core '' with @xmath58  k ; @xmath59 ) .",
    "a variation in the water abundance of this nature could be explained by the vaporization of water ice from grain mantles in the warmer parts of the source .",
    "water abundances @xmath60 have previously inferred from observations of h@xmath53o and h@xmath61o in other warm dense molecular regions ( jacq et al .",
    "1988 ; cernicharo et al .  1994 ; gensheimer et al .  1996 ; van dishoeck & helmich 1996 ) . without the adjustment of any model parameter",
    ", our excitation model for water predicts that the @xmath8 line of h@xmath61o  which is excited primarily within the hot core where the assumed water abundance is @xmath10  will be an emission line with an equivalent width of 0.4  nm , in good agreement with the observations .    to interpret our detection of hf ,",
    "we have constructed a simple model for the steady - state chemistry of interstellar fluorine .",
    "fluorine is qualitatively different in at least one important respect from all the other elements of which hydrides have been detected in the interstellar medium : atomic fluorine reacts exothermically with h@xmath5 via the reaction @xmath62 fluorine also undergoes an exothermic reaction with water : @xmath63 both reactions have been well - studied in the laboratory , although only at temperatures greater than 200  k. for reaction ( r1 ) , measurements by three independent groups have yielded results for the rate coefficient at 298 k in the narrow range @xmath64 ( wurzberg & houston 1980 ; heidner et al .  1980 ; stevens , brune , & anderson 1989 ) .",
    "the temperature dependence of the measured rate coefficient implied the presence of a relatively small activation energy barrier that was variously estimated as @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67  k in these three studies .",
    "we adopted atkinson et al.s ( 1992 ) review value of @xmath68 for the rate coefficient for ( r1 ) .",
    "for reaction ( r2 ) , stevens et al .",
    "( 1989 ) obtained a rate coefficient @xmath69 with no detectable variation over the temperature range 240373  k ; the implied limit on any activation energy barrier was ( @xmath70 ) k. for a water abundance of @xmath71 , these rate coefficients imply that reaction ( r1 ) dominates the formation of hf at temperatures @xmath72  k. at the h@xmath5 densities present in sgr b2 , both reactions are expected to dominate ion - neutral reaction networks as a source of hf .",
    "once formed , hf is destroyed only very slowly .",
    "hf is more strongly bound than any of the species cf , ch , of ,",
    "oh , nf , nh , sf , sh , sf@xmath23 , sif , sih , or sif@xmath23 : thus reactions of hf with c , o , n , s , s@xmath23 , si , and si@xmath23 are all endothermic .",
    "hf has a smaller proton affinity than h@xmath5o , co or n@xmath5 : thus reactions with h@xmath73o@xmath23 , hco@xmath23 , and @xmath74 are likewise endothermic .",
    "destruction of hf takes place slowly by means of cosmic ray induced photodissociation and as a result of reactions with species of low abundance such as ch , he@xmath23 , h@xmath75 , and c@xmath23 .    considering these formation and destruction processes for hydrogen fluoride",
    ", we find that over a wide range of densities and temperatures , including those probed by our observations of hf @xmath1 in sgr b2 , hf accounts for more than @xmath76 of all fluorine nuclei in the gas - phase . in comparison with the ion - neutral reaction routes responsible for the formation of other interstellar hydrides , the neutral - neutral reactions ( r1 ) and ( r2 ) are extremely effective in producing hf . given ( 1 ) our theoretical expectation that hf is the dominant reservoir of gas phase fluorine along the line - of - sight to sgr b2 , ( 2 ) the assumption that the elemental abundance of f is the same as that measured in the solar system ( @xmath77 relative to h ; anders & grevesse 1989 ) , and ( 3 ) the observed hf abundance of @xmath4 relative to h@xmath5 , we conclude that a depletion factor @xmath78 results from the depletion of fluorine onto dust grains in sgr b2 .",
    "this is somewhat smaller than the depletion factors inferred by zmuidzinas et al .",
