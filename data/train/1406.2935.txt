    "the observations of coplanar planets surrounding the millisecond pulsar psr 1257 + 12 @xcite and of a disk around the anomalous x - ray pulsar ( axp ) 4u 0142 + 61 @xcite seemed to suggest that circumpulsar disk formation plays an important role in pulsar spin down @xcite and particle acceleration quenching in the pulsar magnetosphere @xcite .",
    "jiang and li @xcite carried out a monte carlo simulation of the pulsar evolution by assuming that all young pulsars could be surrounded by disks .",
    "the comparison of the simulation results with observations allowed the authors to estimate the effects of the propeller torque by constraining the parameters of the new - born pulsars in intervals of reasonable values .",
    "the presence of circumpulsar disks was also invoked in the literature to explain observations from soft gamma repeaters ( sgr ) @xcite , axps @xcite , rotating radio transients @xcite and central compact objects @xcite .",
    "grimani has also shown @xcite that the presence of disks near the light cylinder of a large sample of pulsars appears compatible with both observed braking indices and the e@xmath0 production in the galactic pulsar magnetosphere contributing to near - earth positron observations @xcite .    in case of disk formation from supernova fallback material ,",
    "it was found ( @xcite and references therein ) that after the supernova explosion @xmath1 0.1 m@xmath2 of material may remain with typical angular momentum of 10@xmath3 ergs s. material with this momentum value would naturally form keplerian disks near the light cylinder of young pulsars",
    ". however , perna et al .",
    "@xcite have recently demonstrated that disk formation around neutron stars occurs only in case of minor magnetic coupling among star layers during the evolution and if the explosion geometry leaving the neutron star behind presents peculiar characteristics .",
    "in addition , small pulsar initial periods would prevent the formation of disks near the pulsar light cylinder .",
    "in @xcite it is shown that fallback disk build up would not be allowed near the light cylinder of pulsars with periods smaller than approximately 40 ms . from the experimental point of view , it is difficult to prove unequivocally through electromagnetic observations that a large sample of pulsars is surrounded by disks @xcite .",
    "moreover , disk self - occultation may occur in case the outer part of the disks blocks the electromagnetic emission from the inner part .",
    "disk precession might further reduce the detection probability .",
    "the mentioned conflicting clues arising from models and electromagnetic observations do not allow us to say any final word about the presence of disks around a large sample of pulsars in the galaxy .",
    "however , in @xcite we found that gravitational wave ( gw ) emission from a precessing disk around the nearby pulsar b0656 + 14 could have been observed by the future deci - hertz interferometer gravitational wave observatory ( decigo ) @xcite and big bang observer ( bbo ) @xcite devoted to gravitational wave detection in space near one hertz .",
    "we extend here this approach to other pulsar - disk systems to study their detectability and characteristics in the sun environment .",
    "this manuscript is organized as follows : section 2 describes briefly the processes leading to the formation of circumpulsar disks . in section 3",
    "we find consistent , independent results indicating that pulsar birth period average values are of hundreds of milliseconds suggesting that disk formation near the pulsar light cylinder is feasible . in sections 4 and 5",
    "the characteristics of precessing disks around pulsar light cyclinders are presented . in section 6",
    "we illustrate the advantages of the detection of gravitational waves generated by precessing disks near the light cylinder of young and middle aged pulsars with respect to electromagnetic observations .",
    "two possible origins were proposed for circumpulsar disk formation : supernova fallback matter and tidal disruption @xcite . in the first case , part of the outer shell of the supernova fails to escape the gravitational potential of the neutron star .",
    "a disk can form if the fallback material has enough angular momentum or when the total pulsar energy output equals the gravitational potential energy gained by the infalling material forced into rotation by the electromagnetic interaction with the pulsar magnetosphere @xcite .",
    "metal rich circumpulsar disks are expected to form from supernova fallback material .",
    "conversely , disks should consist of light elements in case the circumpulsar material originates from a companion star tidally disrupted by the pulsar .",
    "the first scenario is conceivable with isolated pulsars , while the second may likely occur in old , millisecond pulsars .    in the paper by menou ,",
    "perna and hernquist @xcite it is found that the characteristics of some young radio pulsars , including crab , are consistent with the hypothesis that they are surrounded by fallback disks .",
    "we have also shown @xcite that in the case of psr b0656 + 14 , a precessing disk @xcite penetrating the magnetosphere and quenching the particle production may explain the weak pulsed gamma - ray observations from this pulsar @xcite .",
    "if this is the case , the role of nearby pulsars in contributing to near - earth positron observations at energies larger than a few tens of gev @xcite should be reconsidered accordingly .",
    "it is commonly assumed that 10@xmath4 neutron stars belong to our galaxy .",
    "isolated neutron stars are generally associated with supernova events .",
    "the distribution of massive , short lived stars in the galaxy spiral arms constrains the pulsar spatial distribution ( see for example @xcite ) and the supernova explosion rate in the milky way of one every 50 years @xcite sets an upper limit to the pulsar birthrate ( pb ) . the fermi / lat collaboration has found a pb of one pulsar born every 59 years on the basis of a monte carlo simulation normalized to young @xmath5-ray pulsar observations @xcite .",
    "star break up sets the lower limit to the pulsar rotation periods to about 0.6 ms , however sub - millisecond pulsars have never been observed @xcite .",
    "maciesiak , gil and ribeiro @xcite report that approximately 1830 pulsars are known with periods ranging from 1.4 ms to 8.5 s.    the simulation of the active pulsar sample in the milky way by faucher - gigure and kaspi @xcite indicates pulsar initial periods of 300@xmath6150 ms .",
    "experimental clues on initial periods are obtained for those pulsars with known ages and braking indices . for the pulsars associated with supernovae g263.9 - 3.3 ,",
    "snr 0540 - 69.3 , g11.2 - 0.3 , g320.4 - 1.2 birth periods of 52 ms , 63 ms , 63 ms and 39 ms were found , respectively ( @xcite and references therein ) . by using the same method , for crab",
    "it was found 19 ms while 16 ms and 62 ms were estimated for the pulsars psr j0537 - 6910 and psr j1811 - 1925 @xcite .",
    "the accuracy of this approach may be limited by the assumption that braking indices are constant over the pulsar age .",
    "this is most probably untrue since all known braking indices are smaller than 3 , indicating that pulsars lose energy via processes different from the electromagnetic ones @xcite .",
    "gravitational wave energy losses @xcite and interaction with surrounding disks @xcite may play some role in pulsar spin down . to this purpose",
    ", van der swaluw and wu @xcite considered pulsars residing in composite supernova remnants consisting of plerionic and shell - type components to estimate the pulsar birth periods .",
    "a sample of 13 composite supernova remnants was studied .",
    "these authors found that pulsar initial periods vary between 37 and 484 ms .",
    "their findings for the pulsars associated with the supernovae g263.9 - 3.3 , snr 0540 - 69.3 , g11.2 - 0.3 , g320.4 - 1.2 appear consistent with those inferred from braking indices and consistent with the other results reported above .",
    "we conclude that the uncertainty on the assumption of constant braking indices over the pulsar lifetime is negligible .",
    "pbs can be also estimated on the basis of the off - center dipole emission in which pulsar proper motion is correlated to initial periods .",
    "it has to be pointed out that since the orbital velocity of the progenitor and asymmetric kick in the supernova explosion may affect the observed pulsar velocity , the pulsar birth periods thus obtained must be considered lower limits . by following this approach ,",
    "huang and wu @xcite estimate normal pulsar initial periods of a few milliseconds .",
    "vranesevic et al .",
    "@xcite find that up to 40% of pulsars are born with periods ranging between 0.1 and 0.5 s. similar results were obtained by lorimer et al . in @xcite and by vivekahand and narayan @xcite .",
    "theoretical models of cosmic - ray positron production in nearby pulsar magnetosphere @xcite lead to a good agreement with pamela @xcite data by assuming for these pulsars initial periods of 40 ms or 60 ms .",
    "a pulsar origin for the e@xmath0 excess in cosmic rays was also considered in @xcite with analogous findings .",
    "bednarek and bartosik @xcite have shown that their model for high - energy cosmic rays accelerated by pulsars appears consistent with composition and spectra observations between a few@xmath7@xmath8 ev and a few@xmath7@xmath9 ev by assuming for pulsar birth periods an average value of 400 ms .",
    "giller and lipski @xcite and , recently , feng , kotera and olinto @xcite found consistent results .    in conclusion ,",
    "the majority of observations and models summarized in table 1 indicate that pulsar initial periods are of the order of magnitude of tens of milliseconds and above .",

    "the inner radius of disks around young pulsars is set equal to the size of the light cylinder by several authors ( see for instance @xcite ) due to the propeller effect of matter penetrating the light cylinder .",

    "the outer radius of the disk is set twice the inner radius .",
    "this choice follows from similar characteristics of the disk observed around the axp 4u 0142 + 61 @xcite .",

    "young pulsars have a number density of 11 kpc@xmath45 . by assuming that disk masses are uniformly distributed between 10@xmath30 kg and @xmath31 kg , a fraction of 2.5@xmath23 of disks",

    "aged pulsars ( 10@xmath104 - 5@xmath710@xmath104 years ) and small wobble angles , the higher detection rate is expected at 0.46 hz for disk masses larger than 10@xmath39 kg ( see figure [ fig6 ] ) .",

    "pulsar average initial parameters are compatible with the possibility that a large fraction of young and middle aged pulsars are surrounded by disks . precessing keplerian disks near the light cylinder of young and middle aged pulsars",
    "are expected to generate gravitational waves in the frequency range 0.2 - 20 hz .",
    "detection of these gravitational waves appears feasible near one hz with the future decigo / bbo space interferometers . up to thousands of disk - pulsar systems",
    "could conceivably be detected up to tens of kpc distance during ten year space interferometer mission durations and disk masses larger than 10@xmath39 kg under the small wobble angle approximation .",
    "gravitational waves generated by smaller mass precessing disks could be observed for wobble angles of a few degrees .",
    "the observations of gravitational waves generated by circumpulsar disks will allow us to estimate the disk geometrical characteristics and to study their role in quenching the particle production in the pulsar magnetosphere .",
    "cosmic - ray positrons observed near earth at energies larger than tens of gev are produced within one kpc from the solar system . in case",
    "they originate in the magnetosphere of middle aged pulsars , the characteristics of circumpulsar disks inferred from gravitational wave measurements should be properly taken into account in @xmath105 production models .",
