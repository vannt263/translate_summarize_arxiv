    "<S> sub - wavelength semiconductor nanowires have been attracting strong interest recently for photonic applications because they possess various unique optical properties and offer great potential for miniaturizing devices . however , with these nanowires , it is not easy to realize tight light confinement or efficient coupling with photonic circuits . </S>",
    "<S> here we show that a high @xmath0 nanocavity can be created by placing a single iii / v semiconductor nanowire with the diameter less than 100 nm in a grooved waveguide in a si photonic crystal , and employing nanoprobe manipulation . </S>",
    "<S> we have observed very fast spontaneous emission ( 91 ps ) from nanowires accelerated by the strong purcell enhancement in nanocavities , which proves that unprecedented strong light confinement can be achieved in nanowires . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , this unique system enables us to move the nanocavity anywhere along the waveguide . </S>",
    "<S> this configuration provides us tremendous flexibility in integrated photonics because we can add and displace various functionalities of iii / v nanocavity devices in si photonic circuits .    </S>",
    "<S> it has been well established that various semiconductor nanowires ( nws ) with diameters smaller than 100 nm can be grown by epitaxial methods , such as the vapor - liquid - solid ( vls ) method @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a variety of structures , including core - shell @xcite , multi - layer heterostructures @xcite , and p - i - n junctions @xcite , have been implemented specifically for iii / v semiconductor nws by appropriately arranging the growth sequence . </S>",
    "<S> several interesting nw photonic devices have been reported , such as lasers @xcite , light - emitters @xcite , single photon source @xcite , photo - detectors @xcite , and wavelength converters @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the dimensions of the nws naturally suggest that nw - based photonic devices are promising for ultrasmall and power - efficient device operation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , their performance has been limited because no effective light confinement has been achieved for nws when the nw dimensions are in the sub - wavelength regime . </S>",
    "<S> nws coupled with plasmonic waveguide modes have been reported @xcite , but the quality factor ( @xmath0 ) is rather low ( @xmath110 ) and the mode size is smaller than ( thus , not compatible with ) the nw dimension . besides the plasmonics , some studies have reported nws coupled with relatively - small resonators or photonic crystals @xcite , but the light confinement volume is much larger than the wavelength of light and the nws are too small to achieve a sufficient overlap with the confined mode . </S>",
    "<S> this means that we can not enjoy the various enhancements which would arise from strong light confinement in a tiny active material .    in this report </S>",
    "<S> , we propose and demonstrate the design shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1]a in which a sub - wavelength iii / v nw is placed in a grooved waveguide in a si photonic crystal . </S>",
    "<S> it has been previously shown that a small local modulation of a line defect waveguide produces high-@xmath0 nanocavity modes resulting from the spatial modulation of the mode gap frequency in the line defect . </S>",
    "<S> this is a modulated mode - gap cavity , which exhibits a @xmath0 of millions and an effective mode volume ( @xmath2 ) of @xmath3 for well - optimized structures , which @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the cavity wavelength and the medium index , respectively @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is noteworthy that a surprisingly small modulation can lead to ultra - strong light confinement in this type of structure @xcite . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1]a , the sub - wavelength nw produces a certain refractive - index modulation in the line defect , and we confirmed numerically that this modulation is sufficient to form a high-@xmath0 nanocavity mode exactly at the nw position @xcite . as we show later , the cavity mode is mostly localized in the nw . </S>",
    "<S> thus , it can solve the aforementioned problem for nw - based photonic devices . </S>",
    "<S> but this is not the only merit of this design . </S>",
    "<S> it also enables us to implement various iii / v - semiconductor - based nanocavity devices in a si waveguide platform . </S>",
    "<S> si photonics is now being extensively studied to provide a future photonic platform for integrated circuits , but it suffers severely from the poor optical functionality of si @xcite . with our proposed design , we can add various iii / v functional nanocavity devices at arbitrary positions in si waveguides . from another viewpoint , nw photonic devices generally suffer from poor input / output coupling @xcite , but with our present configuration </S>",
    "<S> the nw cavity mode can be easily coupled to si photonics waveguides as already demonstrated for a simple waveguide @xcite .    moreover , this nw cavity is movable , which is exceptional as regards high-@xmath0 nanocavities . since strong light confinement with a small loss </S>",
    "<S> is only achieved by using a special arrangement of photonic crystal cavities @xcite or strongly disordered media @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> wavelength - sized high-@xmath0 nanocavities are prefixed to the surrounding arrangement and are immovable . in our present design , </S>",
    "<S> the cavity is created by the perturbation from the nw and is not fixed to the surrounding photonic crystal lattice . although reconfigurable cavities have been proposed and reported in various forms in photonic crystals @xcite , but none of them demonstrated the position manipulation of the cavity as a result of moving the single nano - object scatterer ( nw ) . also with our method </S>",
    "<S> , an active material can be embedded in the scatterer so that a nanocavity with active function becomes movable . </S>",
    "<S> this feature adds more flexibility and tunability to the application for si photonics , and more importantly it may open up an interesting application when combined with a microfluidic circuit @xcite . if we fill the groove with a certain liquid , a nw can flow along the groove . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , we may be able to deliver an active nw nanocavity to another location in a microfluidic si photonic circuit .    in this study </S>",
    "<S> , we demonstrate the formation and movability of a cavity by manipulating inasp / inp nws on si photonic crystals with a scanning probe , in other words , by atomic force microscopy ( afm ) manipulation . here </S>",
    "<S> we also report the clear observation of a large purcell enhancement of spontaneous emission from nws .    </S>",
    "<S> first of all , we describe the procedure for making the proposed structure ( shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1]a ) by afm manipulation @xcite . after we measured the emission intensities of a number of nws </S>",
    "<S> , we chose some of the nws for our experiment . </S>",
    "<S> then , we transferred these nws from the outside of the photonic crystal using an afm tip with a scanning velocity of 50 nm / s , shown as process ( 1 ) in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1]a . </S>",
    "<S> the afm manipulation technique has been used to slightly adjust the position of nanoparticles on the photonic crystal cavity @xcite , but now we use afm for manipulating much larger semiconductor nws over a much larger distance . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the longer dimension of nw is advantageous for long - distance transfer because the nws will not fall down into photonic crystal holes . by manipulating the afm tip , we put the nw into the square - grooved waveguide of the photonic crystal , shown as process ( 2 ) in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1]a . process ( 3 ) corresponds to the movement of the nw along the groove that we describe later . </S>",
    "<S> note that the existence of the groove is a great help as regards the controllability of afm manipulation , and also enlarges the light confinement as shown below .    the electric field intensity profile for the resonant mode calculated by three - dimensional finite difference time domain ( 3d fdtd ) is shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1]a , where we assumed a photonic crystal with a lattice constant @xmath6 = 352.5 nm and a square groove along the waveguide with a depth @xmath7 of 75 nm and a width @xmath8 of 150 nm . the radius of the hole @xmath9 , the slab thickness @xmath10 , and the width of the waveguide @xmath11 are 100 nm , 200 nm , and 0.98@xmath12 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we modelled a square - cross - section nw with a length @xmath13 = 2 @xmath14 m and a side length @xmath15 = 90 nm ( see also supplementary fig . </S>",
    "<S> s1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> these parameters are close to those used in our experiment . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1]b shows simulated results for the nw on a normal waveguide without a groove . </S>",
    "<S> it is apparent that tight light confinement is achieved around the nw after the nw placement . when we place the nw in the groove , the nw has better overlap with the confined field and the maximum intensity point is moved to the inside of the nw ( see supplementary fig . </S>",
    "<S> s2 ) . using the fraction of the area of the confined field inside the nw in comparison with the total field , @xmath16 20 - 30 @xmath17 of photons </S>",
    "<S> are coupled to the nw for the nw inside the groove while @xmath181@xmath17 of photons for the nw placed on the waveguide . </S>",
    "<S> the calculated @xmath0 and @xmath2 values ( normalized by @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the nw index ) for the cavity formed by the nw inside the groove are 33,200 and 0.95 , respectively ( see methods ) . </S>",
    "<S> when we compare nws of the same size on the top and at the center of the photonic crystal waveguide , the @xmath0 and @xmath2 of the former are three - fold larger and four - fold smaller , respectively ( see supplementary fig . </S>",
    "<S> s1 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> our previous simulation @xcite showed that @xmath15 , @xmath8 , and @xmath7 should be optimized for increasing @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , @xmath15 should be approximately equal to @xmath7 .    generally speaking , </S>",
    "<S> this type of cavities ( modulated modegap cavities ) are not so sensitive to the detailed shape of the modulation . </S>",
    "<S> the overall effective index modulation determines the cavity confinement @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , it was shown that random disorder in mode - gap waveguides can also create an ultrahigh-@xmath0 localized modes @xcite , which indicates that an irregular shape of nw does not necessarily lead to low @xmath0 . from our simulation , the nw diameter influences @xmath0 </S>",
    "<S> greatly , especially when it becomes closer to the groove width ( see supplementary fig . </S>",
    "<S> s3 and ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> we regard that this is more critical issue for creating higher @xmath0 .    for our experiments , we fabricated a series of grooved line defect waveguides in si photonic crystals . </S>",
    "<S> we used inasp / inp heterostructure nws with ten inasp quantum disk ( qd ) layers that worked as emitters @xcite as illustrated in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1]c . a scanning electron micrograph of these nws in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1]d shows that @xmath13 and @xmath15 are homogeneous and @xmath13 for this sample is about 2 @xmath14 m . </S>",
    "<S> the inasp qds inside a single inp nw without a cap are shown in the transmission electron micrograph in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1]e . </S>",
    "<S> the details of the fabrication and structure are described in methods and supplementary information .     in this manuscript </S>",
    "<S> , we use sample a ( sample b ) to refer to the nw with @xmath13 = 1,760 nm ( 940 nm ) and @xmath15 = 83 nm ( 95 nm ) in a photonic crystal with @xmath6 = 352.5 nm ( 350 nm ) . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2]a shows an afm image of the nw after we manipulated the nw inside the groove for sample a ( see supplementary fig . </S>",
    "<S> s4 for the microscope images ) . </S>",
    "<S> this result shows that the nw was successfully placed in the middle of the grooved waveguide . </S>",
    "<S> the top of the nw is slightly above the top surface of the photonic crystal and slightly inclined ( see supplementary fig . </S>",
    "<S> s5 ) .    we can locate the nw position directly from the bright photoluminescence ( pl ) image of inasp qds inside the nw at room temperature ( rt ) using a highly sensitive infrared ingaas camera ( see fig . [ </S>",
    "<S> fig2]b ) . to confirm the nw cavity formation , we investigated the pl spectra of the same nw on sample a before and after we placed the nw inside the groove ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2]c ) . </S>",
    "<S> the pl spectrum ( black lines ) for a single nw of sample a outside the photonic crystal on a bare si on insulator ( soi ) exhibits peaks between 1,200 - 1,500 nm .    in the pl spectrum ( red lines ) of the nw inside the groove in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2]c , we observed a distinctive peak at 1,286 nm . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2]d shows the magnified pl spectrum recorded with higher resolution , which exhibits a strong - intensity peak at 1,286 and another weak - intensity peak at 1,281 nm . from a comparison with the fdtd calculation </S>",
    "<S> , we confirm that the strong - intensity peak with @xmath21 = 7,100 is related to the fundamental mode of the cavity shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1a while the latter with @xmath22 = 7,500 is related to the second - order cavity mode . </S>",
    "<S> next , using the emission intensity filtered at 1286 nm ( at the resonance peak ) , we performed a spatially resolved pl scan over the entire area of photonic crystals ( as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2]e ) ( see also methods ) . </S>",
    "<S> this result confirmed that the intense emission at 1,286 nm is highly localized at exactly the position of the manipulated nw ( see supplementary fig . </S>",
    "<S> s4 for the microscope image as a position comparison ) . </S>",
    "<S> all of these results proved that the nw placement created a confined resonance mode at the nw position .    </S>",
    "<S> other information regarding the origin of the peak emission can be obtained with a polarization measurement . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2]f , we analyze the polarization properties of the sample a emission . </S>",
    "<S> when the nw is on a bare soi , the polarization is parallel to the nw axis ( @xmath23 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this polarization is expected for a zincblende inasp qd inside a single inp nw @xcite but this is also related with the different dielectric , the thickness , and the quantum effect of the qd @xcite ( see supplementary information ) . however , the polarization of the nw inside the grooved waveguide is almost perpendicular ( @xmath24 ) to the nw . </S>",
    "<S> its degree of polarization @xmath25 is 66 @xmath17 and is defined as @xmath26 , where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the intensities at the maximum and minimum of the polar plot . </S>",
    "<S> the observed polarization matches the expected polarization for the cavity mode calculated in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1]a , which strongly supports the previous assignment of the observed resonant mode . </S>",
    "<S> note that the observed polarization degree is not perfect as simply expected from the cavity mode . </S>",
    "<S> we regard that this imperfect polarization may be due to photons directly radiated into the free space and polarization variation of intrinsic nws . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the polarization degree slightly varies for different samples as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> s6 .    here </S>",
    "<S> , we demonstrate the movability of our nw - induced cavity , which is one of the most important features . </S>",
    "<S> to demonstrate the movable cavity , we move the nw inside the groove along the waveguide direction and observe the narrow characteristic peak of the cavity at the new position . in this experiment </S>",
    "<S> , we used the afm manipulation technique in sample b three times : first to locate the nw in the groove , and then to displace it twice . </S>",
    "<S> after each displacement , we recorded the afm images , pl images , pl spectra , and spatially - resolved pl scan images as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] . </S>",
    "<S> we overlay three afm images that we obtained after the first , second , and third manipulations in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3]a . </S>",
    "<S> the displacement by the second and third manipulations was 3.0 , and 6.0 @xmath14 m , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we confirmed that the positions of the nw in the afm images are the same as the bright spots of the nw emission in the pl images of fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3]b . in all three cases </S>",
    "<S> , we successfully observed a narrow cavity peak in the pl spectra at a wavelength of @xmath161,277 nm with slightly different @xmath29 ( 5,200 - 2,900 - 3,200 ) ( see blue curves in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3]c and supplementary fig . </S>",
    "<S> s3 for the fdtd simulation ) . at each step </S>",
    "<S> , we measured the pl spectrum at a reference nw outside the groove , which showed no difference ( green curves in fig . [ fig3]c ) . </S>",
    "<S> next , we performed a spatially - resolved pl scan with a filter centered ( 2-nm window ) at the peak wavelength in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3]c resulting in the pl maps shown in fig . [ fig3]d . in each image , a single bright peak ( in a blue circle ) is seen exactly at the nw location shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3]a . </S>",
    "<S> the weak spot in a green circle corresponds to the unmanipulated nw we used for the reference . </S>",
    "<S> these results clearly show that the sharp resonance moved with the nw displacement . </S>",
    "<S> this constitutes the first observation of a movable sub - wavelength - sized high @xmath0 cavity .    </S>",
    "<S> our target is to create a nanocavity mode concentrated in nw . to demonstrate this feature , we next investigated the emission lifetime since the strong light confinement in a single nw should lead to a large purcell enhancement . </S>",
    "<S> here we measured the emission decay curves at 4 k using an 800-nm pulse excitation laser and a bandpass filter ( bpf ) at the cavity wavelength ( see methods ) . since at 4 k the nonradiative recombination rates are much smaller than those at rt @xcite , we should be able to see the purcell effect more clearly . for our sample , </S>",
    "<S> the cavity wavelength and @xmath29 at 4 k do not differ significantly from the values at rt ( see supplementary fig . </S>",
    "<S> s7 ) . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4]a , the emission decay curve of the nw on a bare soi is shown by black dots . </S>",
    "<S> the data can be well fitted with a single exponential curve resulting in an emission lifetime ( @xmath30 ) of 770 ps . </S>",
    "<S> other nws measured on the bare soi also show similar values around 800 ps ( see supplementary fig . </S>",
    "<S> s7 ) . in contrast , the nw inside the groove for sample a ( red dots in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4]a ) shows distinctive shortening of the pl decay yielding a lifetime ( @xmath31 ) of 187 ps . from a comparison with the emission lifetime of a single nw on a bare soi </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain a 4-fold reduction in the lifetime .    </S>",
    "<S> the above result was obtained with a pl decay measurement for different nws , but we can directly investigate the purcell effect by measuring the same nw while varying the cavity @xmath29 by afm manipulation . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the result in fig . [ fig3 ] </S>",
    "<S> shows that the cavity @xmath29 changes at each displacement step ( 5,200 - 2,900 - 3,200 ) , although the resonant wavelength is mostly the same . </S>",
    "<S> we consider that this was because the vertical position of the nw in the groove was changed a little , in other words , part of the nw was lifted up slightly . </S>",
    "<S> we confirmed this speculation by pushing the nw down into the groove with the probe after the third displacement , and observed that @xmath29 recovered from 3,200 to 4,200 ( see supplementary fig . </S>",
    "<S> s8 ) . </S>",
    "<S> our calculation shows that such misplacement leads to a slight reduction in @xmath0 , but has negligible influence on the cavity volume ( see supplementary fig . </S>",
    "<S> s9 ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus , this manipulation method is ideally suited for purcell effect characterization . </S>",
    "<S> we performed time - resolved emission measurements for sample b at each step of the manipulation shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] . for the nw on the bare soi of sample b , the lifetime ( @xmath30 ) was 730 ps ( black dots in fig . [ fig4]b ) . </S>",
    "<S> the pl decay curves of the nw in the grooved waveguide at each step are shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4]b with the corresponding @xmath29 values . </S>",
    "<S> the graph clearly shows that the emission becomes faster as the @xmath29 increases . at the highest @xmath29 ( 5,200 ) , </S>",
    "<S> the lifetime was as short as 91 ps . </S>",
    "<S> this lifetime is the shortest lifetime reported for the iii - v nw . </S>",
    "<S> since this measurement was performed for the same nw in the cavity with the same volume , it represents a clean demonstration of purcell enhancement , which was realized by the unique feature of our nw - induced nanocavity . for a better comparison </S>",
    "<S> , we collect @xmath32 in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4]c from samples a and b for different @xmath33 values . </S>",
    "<S> note that the @xmath2 values for samples a and b are 0.95 and 0.54 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we also added other data points from different nws of c and d ( see supplementary figure s10 ) . </S>",
    "<S> sample c ( three samples of d ) refers to the nw with @xmath13 = 2,620 nm ( 1,700 , 1,800 , and 1,900 nm ) and @xmath15 = 85 nm ( 102 , 129 , and 90 nm ) in a photonic crystal with @xmath6 = 416 nm ( 382.5 , 360 , and 360 nm ) . </S>",
    "<S> nw in sample c has a similar structure as a and b while nws in sample d are inasp nws capped with inp layer . </S>",
    "<S> the result clearly reveals a linear relationship between @xmath33 and @xmath32 , which is an evidence of the purcell enhancement .    </S>",
    "<S> although the inhibited spontaneous emission in nws has been reported by many groups@xcite , there has been very little work on purcell enhancement observation for nws . </S>",
    "<S> recently , oulton et al . </S>",
    "<S> observed a six - fold shortening of the pl lifetime in a single cds nw coupled to plasmonic waveguides ( no cavity effect)@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> since these plasmonic structures realize an extremely small mode volume , it can lead to large purcell enhancement even with very low @xmath0 resonance . </S>",
    "<S> our present result gives the clear purcell enhancement of a single nw for the first time in a high-@xmath0 dielectric cavity . </S>",
    "<S> the achieved enhancement is slightly larger than the result in the nw - plasmonic system . </S>",
    "<S> although there are pros and cons for both methods , we regard that our nw system is advantageous for integrated photonics applications because of its low loss and ease of integration with the waveguide . </S>",
    "<S> although the confinement factor ( 15 - 20 @xmath17 ) is comparable to that for our cavities ( @xmath16 20 - 30 @xmath17 ) , the plasmonic mode is much smaller than the nw dimension , which generally degrades the energy efficiency for device operations . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , extreme plasmonic modes may suffer from nonradiative energy transfer to metals@xcite , which makes the observation of large purcell enhancement difficult . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , our system may still have a room for achieving larger enhancement if we boost up the cavity @xmath0 as we discuss below .    </S>",
    "<S> the theoretical purcell factor @xmath34 for our sample with the fastest emission rate is about 732 . </S>",
    "<S> as is well known , the emission rate will be reduced for several reasons , such as a spectral , spatial , or polarization mismatch @xcite . note that in our experiments , the polarization mismatch is large ( as seen in fig . [ fig2]f ) . </S>",
    "<S> a quantitative investigation of these reduction factors is beyond the scope of this study . </S>",
    "<S> although we could not determine the exact position of the emitter that we measured in this experiment , our afm manipulation technique is able to precisely align the emitter position at the field maximum of the cavity if we know the precise position of the emitter in the nw . </S>",
    "<S> this would constitute an important advantage of our system over other solid - state cavity qed systems @xcite .    in conclusion , we demonstrated that a high-@xmath0 cavity can be created simply by putting a single nw into a groove in a photonic crystal waveguide . </S>",
    "<S> we used the spontaneous emission of the qds inside the single nw to probe the cavity formation by comparing the pl spectra and the emission polarization of the nw on a bare soi and inside the groove . </S>",
    "<S> we moved the cavity spatially while manipulating the position of the nw . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we also observed emission rate enhancements for the nw inside the groove showing unprecedented strong light confinement in a single nw with a record of eight - fold emission rate enhancement . </S>",
    "<S> we believe that our observation will stimulate the discovery of new phenomena in fundamental research on cavities in photonic crystals @xcite and also the localized modes in disordered photonic systems @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> as regards the realization of novel nanophotonic devices , our new approach for creating cavities is useful for movable devices such as nanolasers @xcite or all - optical memories @xcite with the capability of integrating them on a si platform . </S>",
    "<S> especially , a laser is one of the most interesting applications of our system . to achieve lasing , we may need a larger gain volume and higher @xmath0 , which remains for a future study . as for the improvement of @xmath0 , smaller - diameter nws in narrower grooves </S>",
    "<S> are possible options . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the integration technique of nw is not limited to iii - v nws on si photonic crystals , e.g. diamond nanowires @xcite with suitable refractive index photonic crystals . </S>",
    "<S> another potential method for moving cavities , namely nanofluidic technology @xcite remains tantalizing . </S>"
