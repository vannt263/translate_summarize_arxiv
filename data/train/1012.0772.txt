    "spontaneous parametric down - conversion ( spdc ) with its production of photon pairs belongs to the most fascinating nonlinear optical effects .",
    "two photons comprising a photon pair can be entangled in their degrees of freedom as it was first observed by hong , ou , and mandel @xcite for temporal correlations .",
    "nonlinear bulk crystals served nearly exclusively as sources of these photon pairs for many years .",
    "however , many highly nonlinear crystals could not be used due to impossibility to achieve natural phase - matching conditions . here ,",
    "the concept of additional periodic modulation of nonlinear susceptibility as introduced by armstrong @xcite has become fruitful and resulted in the invention of poling of nonlinear crystals @xcite .",
    "highly nonlinear materials in which quasi - phase - matching conditions @xcite are met can be efficiently used since then .",
    "they have allowed the construction of bright and versatile sources of photon pairs .",
    "moreover , periodical poling has also allowed to tailor the properties of emitted photon pairs using nonlinear domains with variable lengths ( chirped periodical poling ) .",
    "domains of different lengths in an ordered structure allow an efficient nonlinear interaction in an ultra - wide spectral region extending typically over several hundreds of nm @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that such photon pairs can posses quantum temporal correlations at the timescale of fs and so can be extraordinarily useful , e.g. , in metrology ( quantum optical coherence tomography @xcite ) or quantum - information processing @xcite .",
    "alternatively , domains of different lengths can be ordered randomly .",
    "the nonlinear interaction can be efficient even in this case [ stochastic quasi - phase - matching ] as studies of the process of second - harmonic generation indicate @xcite . here , we show that these structures despite their randomness are able to generate spectrally ultra - wide photon pairs at generation rates comparable to chirped periodically - poled crystals ( cppc ) .",
    "this shows that contributions from the coherent summation of photon - pair fields coming from ordered domains of different lengths in cppcs are considerably lower than generally accepted .",
    "when properly phase compensated photon pairs with correlation times at the fs timescale can be emitted from these structures .",
    "moreover , these structures have usually smaller requirements with respect to fields polarization properties and orientation of the nonlinear medium @xcite .",
    "also fabrication tolerances are less strict in this case @xcite .",
    "practically , technology of poling produces structures with relatively large declinations from an ideal geometry which results in reduction of photon - pair generation rates .",
    "there is the hope that the fabricated randomly poled structures can even out - perform their chirped periodically - poled counterparts .",
    "the extension to 2d or 3d geometries offers additional possibilities including naturally poled materials @xcite .",
    "quantum state @xmath0 describing a photon pair generated in the process of spdc in a poled crystal can be written as follows @xcite : @xmath1 where a two - photon spectral amplitude @xmath2 gives the probability amplitude of emitting a signal photon at frequency @xmath3 and its idler twin at frequency @xmath4 .",

    "this elucidates why two neighbouring domains form basic elementary units for the interpretation of properties of photon - pairs @xcite .",
    "the emitted photon pairs can be characterized by mean spectral density @xmath45 of the number of photon pairs .",
    "the density @xmath46 is defined along the formula @xmath47 where the symbol @xmath48 means stochastic averaging over an ensemble of random realizations of the crystal . in practice mean values can correspond to averaging over states of photon pairs emitted at different positions in the transverse plane of a naturally - poled material @xcite . or they can just serve as an indicator of expected values for individual realizations .",

    "a structure composed of @xmath72 layers is roughly 19  mm long and typically delivers @xmath73 photon pairs per second per 100  mw of pumping for ordered positions of boundaries .",
