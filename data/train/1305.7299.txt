    "in order to compare the theoretical and experimental data , we are interested in the centroid of the isgmr . this quantity can be directly related with the nuclear incompressibility modulus @xmath8 . one can consider @xmath8 as the analogous for a nucleus of the elastic constant of a spring ; for this reason we will refer to nuclei with a low value of @xmath8 as soft or to the ones with high values of @xmath8 as stiff .",
    "because of the definition of @xmath8 this means that the higher the centroid the stiffer the nucleus @xcite : @xmath9 @xmath10 being the nucleon mass , @xmath11 the mean square radius of the nucleus , and @xmath12 being the centroid energy .",
    "it has been shown that extracting the value of the incompressibility of nuclear matter @xmath13 as the volume term of a leptodermus formula from @xmath8 is strongly model dependent @xcite .",
    "for this reason , the most reliable way to obtain @xmath13 is to find a microscopic model able to reproduce accurately the experimental results for a nucleus or a series of nuclei ; the same microscopic framework can then be used to obtain the equation of state of nuclear matter from which @xmath13 is defined as @xcite : @xmath14 where @xmath15=0.16 @xmath16 is the saturation density and @xmath17 is the energy of the system .",
    "although the present work is devoted to finite nuclei , the incompressibility of nuclear matter @xmath13 is a universal quantity ( not dependent on the single nucleus like @xmath8 ) and we will use it to compare the results of different edf . in order to extract the correct value for the centroid of the giant resonance ( @xmath12 ) one can use the ratios @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 . since in literature",
    "the most reported estimates of the centroid are based on @xmath18 , we will focus on this quantity .",
    "the moments are defined as : @xmath21 where the strength is @xmath22 ; @xmath23 being the ground state and @xmath24 an eigenstate with energy @xmath25 of the qrpa .",
    "the monopole operator is of the form : @xmath26 in theory one should calculate the integral of eq .",
    "( [ eq : moment ] ) from zero to infinity . in practice ,",
    "the qrpa calculations return discrete values for the eigenstates and the integral of eq .",
    "( [ eq : moment ] ) reduces to a finite summation . when trying to compare the experimental results and theoretical findings , one has to take into account that the values of the centroid can be strongly affected by the energy interval where the moments are calculated , for this reason we will report it in all our results .    with the finite amplitude method",
    "an existing hfb code is required to build the qrpa code @xcite .",
    "we employ the _ hfbrad _",
    "@xcite , which solves the hfb equations in coordinate space in a spherical box .",
    "we modified the _",
    "hfbrad _ in order to introduce interactions which were not present in the original version .",
    "the maximum angular momenta taken into account are @xmath27=21/2 , 15/2 for neutrons and protons .",
    "the hfb self consistent iterations are considered convergent when the relative difference between the calculated energies is smaller than @xmath28 and the maximum variation of the sum of the neutron and proton pairing gap is smaller than @xmath29 mev .",
    "the hfb calculations are performed with _ quadruple _",
    "precision real numbers , while the qrpa matrix construction and diagonalization with _",
    "double _ precision variables . for the mean field",
    "we use sly5 @xcite , skm * @xcite and skxs20 @xcite skyrme interactions ( this last interaction has been created to replace the skp , which , according to @xcite presents intrinsic stability problems and it is thus unreliable ) . in accordance to the fact that the sly5 interaction has a value of @xmath30 mev , while skm * has @xmath31 217 mev and skxs20 have @xmath31 202 mev , these parametrizations cover a wide range of possible incompressibilities . in appendix",
    "[ app : b ] we report the main properties associated to the interactions used and we compare the charge radii and binding energy with the experimental values of the nuclei under investigation . in the pairing channel",
    "we apply density dependent delta interactions . due to the divergent character of a delta force we limit the number of states used for the calculations ( see later for further details ) .",
    "the pairing interaction present in the _ hfbrad _ is of the form @xcite : @xmath32\\delta({\\bf r}-{\\bf r'}).\\ ] ] the density dependence of the interaction mimics the pairing suppression at high momenta ( density ) . according to how the parameters @xmath33 are modified one can obtain different kinds of pairing called @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 pairing .",
    "the names reflect the pairing field they give rise to , which can be localized in the volume , on the surface , or on a mix of the two .",
    "the _ volume _",
    "interaction in particular has no explicit density dependence ( @xmath34 ) , and for this reason it is easier to treat it when calculating the residual fields . as a representative of the _ mixed _ pairing case we choose @xmath35 .    among the different types of pairing",
    ", _ surface _ pairing is expected to have a special role ; in fact the compressibility is particularly sensitive to the surface properties of a nucleus @xcite .",
    "theoretical models show that the coupling with collective vibrations leads to pairing fields strongly peaked at the surface of the nucleus @xcite and according to ref .",
    "surface _ pairing can reproduce nuclear masses with better accuracy with respect to other parametrizations . in order to have a pairing field peaked on the surface and vanishing in the central part of a nucleus where @xmath36 , according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : pairing - int ] ) , @xmath37 is set equal to 1 . in these calculations @xmath38=1",
    "( we will test in sec .",
    "[ sec : pairing ] pairing interactions with different values of @xmath38 ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : pairing - comparison ] ( b ) we show different kinds of pairing as a function of the parameter @xmath37 passing , with small steps , from _ volume _ to _ surface _ pairing .",
    "the rearrangement term due to the density dependence of the pairing interaction is properly taken into account in this work .",
    "this term is originated by the fact that the energy in a skyrme and dddi approximation has the form : @xmath39 , where the kinetic term , the skyrme term , the pairing term and the coulomb term are present . in the hfb approach",
    "the single particle hamiltonian is obtained as a functional derivative of the energy with respect to the density ; the part of the single particle hamiltonian coming from the @xmath40 is usually referred to as rearrangement term : @xmath41 similarly , the residual fields giving rise to the qrpa matrix are functions of the second derivatives of the densities and the rearrangement term is : @xmath42 if there is no explicit density dependence of the pairing term , @xmath43 $ ] , the first and second derivatives vanish identically and there is no rearrangement term in the hfb or in the qrpa matrix .",
    "this is the case of the _ volume _ pairing , while _",
    "mixed _ and _ surface _ parametrizations give rise to a non zero rearrangement term .",
    "its impact on the centroids ranges from 0.04 - 0.2 mev .",
    "in particular , the energy weighted sum rules are very sensitive to the correct handling of the rearrangement term .",
    "this term should thus be properly taken into account for a calculation to be considered fully self consistent .",
    "as an example we report in fig .",
    "[ fig : rearr ] the strength functions for @xmath44sn with and without the rearrangement term .",
    "the energy weighted sum rule in the full calculation including the rearrangement term is 99.2% .",
    "if we neglect the rearrangement in both of the hfb and qrpa it is 137% , while neglecting the rearrangement term only in the qrpa calculation leads to ewsr exhausted at 116% .",
    "the effect on the strength function is very patent for this nucleus where , in the fully self consistent calculation , the peak at 16 mev is higher than the one at 17 mev , while in the calculations without rearrangement term the opposite happens ; as a result these last calculations tends to return higher centroids respect to the fully self consistent case .      for a good comparison with the experimental data it is useful to constrain the numerical uncertainty originating from the calculations .",
    "three main parameters influence the quality of the qrpa calculations : the mesh size , the box size and the quasiparticle energy cutoff . at first we",
    "analyze how the centroids of @xmath45sn are affected by the mesh size ; tab .",
    "[ tab : mesh ] shows that this parameter has a very small impact on the results and we decided to stick to 0.05 fm mesh since it is often used in literature .",
    "mesh ( fm ) &   @xmath18   &   @xmath46   &  @xmath47   + 0.025 & 15.37 & 15.30 & 15.56 + 0.05 & 15.36 & 15.30 & 15.55 + 0.1 & 15.36 & 15.29 & 15.54 + 0.2 & 15.36 & 15.29 & 15.54 +    the next step is to vary the box size .",
    "the bigger the box the better one expects the continuum to be approximated .",
    "however , this is at the cost of increasing the number of states of the qrpa matrix and making the diagonalization slow .",
    "as a good compromise we decided to use a 20 fm box . going to higher box sizes would increase the precision of the results by about 0.03 mev but the two quasiparticle space would increase by 1.6 times ( 25 fm box ) rendering the calculations @xmath31 4 times slower ( since the diagonalization of the qrpa matrix scales as the third power of the matrix size ) .",
    "box size ( fm ) &   @xmath18   &   2qp   + 18 & 15.29 & 2746 + 20 & 15.36 & 3460 + 25 & 15.33 & 5640 + 30 & 15.33 & 8320 +    at this point we address the size of the quasiparticle space as a function of the cutoff .",
    "a space too small can lead to not fully self consistent results .",
    "all the quasiparticle excitations obtained in the hfb calculation are also employed in the qrpa calculations ( this is necessary for full self consistency ) .",
    "no prescription is used to take into account the continuum other than using a box size big enough to obtain stable results . as can be seen in tab .",
    "[ tab:2qpspace ] , stability is reached in the cutoff range 150  -  200 mev .",
    "cutoff &   @xmath18   &   @xmath47   &  @xmath48   + 60 & 15.36 & 15.30 & 15.55 + 100 & 15.30 & 15.24 & 15.48 + 150 & 15.26 & 15.20 & 15.43 + 200 & 15.25 & 15.19 & 15.43 +    in summary , according to the preceding results , we decide to employ in the rest of the article a 20 fm box with 0.05  fm mesh and a 200 mev cutoff .",
    "these parameters allow us to estimate the numerical uncertainty of our calculations to be @xmath49  0.1 mev .",
    "the value of the pairing gap , in the case of dddi pairing interaction is a function of the cutoff . in order to obtain gap values corresponding to the experimental five point formula we adjusted the values of the strength @xmath50 as detailed in appendix [ app : a ] .",
    "the resulting qrpa two quasiparticle space usually contains about @xmath31  6000 states leading to matrices of the order of @xmath31 12000@xmath51 12000 entries .",
    "the spurious states which can appear at low energy ( @xmath49  1  mev ) have been proven to be very well separated from the physical modes @xcite and we can thus ignore them .     &   @xmath18   & @xmath47 & @xmath48 + our & 12.925 & 12.849 & 13.185 + terasaki _ et al .",

    "the two qrpa approaches are completely different ( fam @xcite and canonical basis expansion @xcite ) , and they only share the underlying hfb . despite this fact , the difference in the centroids is about 0.001 mev as can be seen in table [ tab : comparisontera ] .",
    "experiments on giant monopole resonances have been performed for more than 30 years .",
    "the number and accuracy of the data obtained in recent years is increasing , and for this reason we will limit our analysis to the most recent experiments .",
    "two main groups have been recently working on isgmr , namely the team at texas a&m ( tamu ) at college station ( usa ) , and the team of the research center for nuclear physics ( rcnp ) at osaka university ( japan ) .",
    "many detailed analysis of giant resonances have been carried out but , there are still some discrepancies which have to be addressed . in the following , we will review the major findings of both groups , however , since the quantities to be compared are functions of the moments of eq .",
    "( [ eq : moment ] ) and different experiments use non equivalent systems to evaluate them , they will be addressed separately .",
    "in particular the energy range of evaluation of the moments changes from experiment to experiment , and this can affect the centroids .",

    "there is a general agreement that the experimental strength of @xmath1pb is rather symmetric around the centroid located at 13.5 - 14 mev with a width of 2.5 - 3  mev .",
    "we will take as a reference the latest results found in @xcite for @xmath1pb since they almost completely exhaust the energy weighted sum rule ( ewsr ) .",

    "the skxs20 , in fact , overestimates the binding energy and returns smaller nuclei with respect to the experiments .",

    "<S> since about two - thirds of the nuclei under investigation are better explained with a soft parametrization this tends to suggest that the currently accepted picture for the incompressibility might require modifications .    </S>",
    "<S> introduction[intro ] the study of the isoscalar giant monopole resonance ( isgmr ) has been for a long time @xcite a valuable tool to investigate the nuclear structure and to extrapolate the behavior of nuclear matter @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> various approximations in the energy density functional ( edf ) framework using interactions with nuclear matter incompressibility modulus @xmath0 mev have shown good agreement with the experimentally determined centroids , in particular for @xmath1pb , @xmath2zr , and @xmath3sm . in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite niksi _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . _ showed for the first time that a relativistic mean field theory approach is also able to return good estimates of the isgmr centroids with the same value of the incompressibility ( improving older results which required values of @xmath4 250 mev ) . </S>",
    "<S> this further confirmation seemed to settle down the problem .    </S>",
    "<S> more recent experimental data on sn @xcite and cd @xcite however , can not be reproduced equally well with the same functionals . </S>",
    "<S> the differences between the experimental and the calculated centroids are about 0.5 - 1.0  mev ; for this reason the compressibility of atomic nuclei has become once again an important topic in nuclear structure  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> many attempts have been made to reduce the gap between experiments and theory . in a work by col _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . </S>",
    "<S> _ @xcite it has been pointed out that increasing the value of the symmetry energy j at saturation density can decrease the calculated centroids while keeping the incompressibility constant </S>",
    "<S> .    the role of superfluidity on the softness of nuclei has been investigated in an early work by civitarese _ </S>",
    "<S> et al _ in @xcite and more recently it has been addressed in detail by khan in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is now generally accepted that pairing can help in reducing the problem @xcite , but can not cure it completely . </S>",
    "<S> for this reason , a prominent role in studying giant monopole resonances is played by the harmonic approximation , taking into account the pairing correlations ( qrpa ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is important to remark that neglecting parts of the energy density functional in the residual fields can lead to incorrect estimates of the centroids of the isgmr @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a completely self consistent qrpa on top of a hf+bcs and its extension quasiparticle time blocking approximation were adopted in @xcite , but also in this case a good agreement with the experiments required different skyrme parametrizations according to the isotopic chain . the same framework ( hf+bcs+qrpa ) but with density dependent delta interactions ( dddi ) in the pairing channel and other kinds of skyrme interactions in the mean field have been used by cao _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . </S>",
    "<S> _ in @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the hfb , however , is a more general approach to pairing properties than hf+bcs ( in particular for neutron rich nuclei ) and it should to be preferred as a basis for the qrpa @xcite . in the case of isgmr , it has been shown that the two approaches can give rise important differences in the determination of the centroids @xcite . in the same article @xcite sn isotopes isgmr centroids were studied in the framework of a hfb+qrpa with the use of dddi interactions , however both of the rearrangement terms due to the density dependence of the pairing interaction and the contribution of the two - body spin - orbit interaction were neglected .    </S>",
    "<S> a systematic fully self consistent hfb+qrpa calculation ( solved with arnoldi method ) of isgmr was shown in @xcite . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> the effects of a separable interaction in the pairing channel were compared to a _ volume _ type pairing . </S>",
    "<S> this kind of pairing interaction , however , also fails at curing the discrepancies between the experiments and the calculations .    </S>",
    "<S> a clear assessment on the validity of the skyrme energy edf and density dependent pairing framework requires thus the least number of approximations : fully self consistent hfb+qrpa+dddi .    </S>",
    "<S> the scope of this paper is to clarify via systematic calculations which are the most suitable parametrizations able to reproduce the centroids of the isgmr . in order to achieve this result </S>",
    "<S> we employ an accurate and fully self consistent hfb+qrpa method . to our knowledge , this is the first calculation of this kind that properly takes into account the rearrangements due to the density dependence of the pairing interaction in the context of the hfb+qrpa .    </S>",
    "<S> our calculations are based on the finite amplitude method ( fam ) @xcite and in particular on the recent matrix - fam @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this method has proven to return results as accurate ( if not more ) as the qrpa expanded on a canonical basis , since the latter requires special care in handling the canonical basis @xcite , and additional cutoffs are required @xcite in building the qrpa matrix to prevent it to become too large . </S>",
