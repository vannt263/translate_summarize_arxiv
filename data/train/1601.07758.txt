    "after the discovery of the 125 gev higgs boson @xcite , the primary task of the lhc is to hunt for new physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) . among various extensions of the sm ,",
    "the low energy supersymmetry ( susy ) is the most appealing candidate since it can solve the gauge hierarchy problem , naturally explain the cosmic cold dark matter and achieve the gauge coupling unification .",
    "the search for susy has long been performed both directly and indirectly . on the one hand ,",
    "the colliders have directly searched for the sparticle productions . on the other hand ,",
    "susy effects have been probed indirectly through precision measurements of some low energy observables .",
    "@xmath8 is a famous observable which is sensitive to new physics beyond the sm @xcite .",
    "so far the most precise experimental value @xmath9 comes from the lep and slc measurements @xcite , while the sm prediction is @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "the future @xmath2-factories are expected to produce much more @xmath2-bosons than the lep experiment .",
    "for example , @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 @xmath2-bosons are expected to be produced respectively at the international linear colldier ( ilc ) @xcite , the circular electron - positron collider ( cepc ) @xcite , the future circular collider ( fcc - ee ) @xcite and the super @xmath2-factory @xcite .",
    "this will allow for a more precise measurement of @xmath0 @xcite and help pin down the involved new physics effects .",
    "the susy effects in @xmath0 were calculated and discussed many years ago @xcite . in this work",
    "we revisit these effects for two reasons : ( i ) the current experiments , especially the lhc experiments , have severely restrained the susy parameter space .",
    "it is intriguing to figure out the possible magnitude of the susy effects in the currently allowed parameter space ; ( ii ) given the possibility of some future @xmath2-factories like ilc , cepc or fcc - ee , a more precise measurement of @xmath0 will help reveal the susy effects although these effects may have already been restrained to be rather small by current experiments . in order to know if the susy effects are accessible in a future measurement of @xmath0 , we must figure out their currently allowed value .",
    "this work is organized as follows . in sec.[sec : formula ] , we give a description of susy effects in @xmath0 . in sec.[sec : result ] , we scan over the susy parameter space and display the susy effects in the allowed parameter space . finally we give our conclusion in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "since the susy effects in @xmath0 have been calculated in the literature @xcite , here we only give a brief description .",
    "the dominant susy effects in @xmath0 are from the vertex corrections to @xmath14 , as shown in figs .",

    "the notation @xmath37 represents ( @xmath38 ) for gluino loops , ( @xmath39 ) for chargino loops , ( @xmath40 ) for neutralino loops , ( @xmath41 ) for charged higgs loops and ( @xmath42 , @xmath43 ) for neutral higgs loops .",
    "in addition to @xmath0 , we also show the susy effects in the forward - backward asymmetry @xmath44 in the decay @xmath45 : @xmath46 its experimental value is @xmath47 from the lep experiment @xcite while its sm prediction is @xmath48  @xcite . in the future @xmath2-factories",
    ", this forward - backward asymmetry will be measured together with @xmath0 , both of which will jointly allow for a revelation of susy effects .",
    "to clarify our numerical calculations we consider the general mssm and the natural - susy scenario @xcite . from the natural - susy results ( the natural - susy parameter space is much smaller than the general mssm ) , we can acquire the more detailed characters of each kind of loops , while from the general mssm results we can obtain the more general size of susy loop effects .    for the natural - susy scenario , since in this scenario",
    "only the higgsino masses and the third - generation squark masses are assumed to be light , while other sparticles are assumed to be rather heavy and thus their effects in low energy observables are decoupled , in our scan we fix the soft - breaking mass parameters in the first two generation squark sector and the slepton sector at 5 tev , and assume @xmath49 . for the electroweak",
    "gaugino masses , inspired by the grand unification relation , we take @xmath50 and fix @xmath51 at 2 tev .",
    "the gluino mass is fixed at 2 tev since it is supposed to be not too far above tev scale in natural - susy .",

    "we use the package higgsbounds-4.0.0  @xcite to implement these constraints . * the experimental constraints in @xmath1-physics .",

    "we require the thermal relic density of the neutralino dark matter to be below the 2@xmath62 upper limit of the planck value  @xcite and require the dark matter - nucleon spin - independent scattering scross section @xmath63 to satisfy the 95% c.l .",

    "while for the stops the right - handed one is weakly bounded ( its mass can be as light as 210 gev for higgsinos heavier than 190 gev ) @xcite . when we display the numerical results , we will not show a sharp lhc bound on stop or higgsino mass ( we only consider the lep bounds on stop and higgsinos ) . for each surviving sample",
    "we calculate the correction to @xmath0 and display the numerical results in the proceeding section .",

    "note that , as commented in the preceding section , so far the right - handed stop mass in natural susy is weakly bounded by lhc experiments ( its mass can be as light as 210 gev for higgsinos heavier than 190 gev ) @xcite . * as shown in fig.[dia : gluino ] , the gluino - sbottom loop effects are very small due to the heaviness of gluino .",
    "the loop effects of the neutralinos , charged and neutral higgs bosons , as shown in figs.[dia : neturalino ] , [ dia : chargedhiggs ] and [ dia : neutralhiggs ] , are sensitive to @xmath79 and can be sizable for a large value of @xmath5 .",
    "our numerical results show that the neutralino loop can push the @xmath80 mass to 850 gev when @xmath5 is around 32 .",
    "if the @xmath5 is about 23 , through the charged higgs loop , @xmath81 mass less than 770 gev is excluded .",

    ". both observables can jointly probe the susy effects .",
    "while the chargino loop effects always enhance both quantities , the combined total effects of all loops can either enhance or reduce them .",
    "we also find that in the general mssm without special naturalness requirement , both @xmath0 and @xmath65 are allowed to vary in a larger region than in natural susy , especially when @xmath82 is small . * from figs.[dia : chargino]-[dia : total - tan - dabfb - general ] we see that in some currently allowed parameter space , the effects of natural susy may be accessible in the future @xmath0 measurement .",
