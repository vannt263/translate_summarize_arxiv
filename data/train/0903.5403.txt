    "high mass x - ray binaries ( hmxbs ) are binary stellar systems with a compact object and an early type massive star .",

    "hmxbs display a wide range of x - ray behaviour and luminosities .",
    "the x - ray emission varies from a persistent nature to a transient behaviour .",
    "outbursts occur on timescales ranging from hours to months , and some sources also show short term flaring activity .",
    "periodic modulation and eclipses are also seen in many hmxbs .",
    "the hmxbs can be split into two main categories as the companion star can be either a be star or an ob supergiant ( van paradijs 1983 ) .",
    "the majority of hmxbs ( @xmath2 ) belong to the first class of be binary systems ( kaper , van der meer @xmath3 tijani 2004 ) . in be system , mass transfer is effected by intermittent mass ejection from the equatorial region of a rapidly rotating be star .",
    "the compact object is a neutron star and is typically in a wide ( p@xmath4 20@xmath0100 days ) and eccentric orbit ( e @xmath5 0.3@xmath00.5 ) ( liu , van paradijs @xmath3 van den heuvel 2000 ; negueruela @xmath3 coe 2002 ) .",
    "the x - ray emission is highly variable , ranging from complete absence to giant transients lasting weeks to months .",

    "accretion is powered either by the stellar wind from the supergiant and/or through roche lobe overflow .",
    "the neutron stars orbiting wind - fed supergiant binaries are generally less luminous ( l@xmath6 ergs s@xmath7 ) .",
    "the orbital periods of the supergiant systems are shorter than the be - star systems and the orbits are more circular . however , during the past few years , the ibis instrument ( ubertini et al . 2003 ) onboard the integral @xmath8 ray satellite ( winkler et al .",
    "2003 ) has discoverd many new supergiant systems that occasionally exhibit a fast x - ray transient activity .",
    "these systems were termed as supergiant fast x - ray transients ( sfxts ) ( negueruela et al 2006 ; smith et al .",

    "several models have been suggested to explain the origin of bright short duration flares .",
    "bozzo , falanga @xmath3 stella ( 2008a ) explained that flares occur due to interaction of the inflowing wind with the neutron star magnetosphere .",
    "int zand ( 2005 ) proposed that the flares are due to sudden accretion of small ejections originating in a clumpy wind from the supergiant donor .",
    "however , romano et al . ( 2007 ) showed that the accretion phase persists for a longer duration and the sources are mostly at an intermediate flaring level with an x - ray luminosity of 10@xmath10 ergs s@xmath7 .",
    "negueruela et al . ( 2006 ) suggested that the low rate of emission ( @xmath11 ergs s@xmath7 ) during quiescence in sfxts is due to the fact that these systems have wider orbits as compared to persistent supergiant hmxbs , due to which the compact object accretes from a less dense environment .",
    "the quiescent state of sfxts is characterised by a soft - spectrum and an x - ray luminosity of 10@xmath12 ergs s@xmath7 .",

    "this is supported by our detection of an orbital period of 3.32 d.    int zand ( 2005 ) had suggested the @xmath17clumpy winds \" model to explain the occurence of short and bright flares .",

    "the interaction of the compact object with the dense clumps formed in the massive wind leads to increased accretion rate and hard x - ray emission ( leyder et al . 2007 ) .",
    "oskinova et al .",
    "( 2007 ) also proposed that optically thick macro clumps are present within the wind from the hot supergiant companions . from the hard x - ray variability of sfxt systems ,",
    "walter @xmath3 zurita heras ( 2007 ) determined the luminosity , frequency and duration of flares in sfxts and derived the wind clump parameters .",
    "they proposed that the orbital radius of the compact object is relatively large ( @xmath1 10 r@xmath25 and the clump density varies with the orbital radius .",
    "sidoli et al .",
    "( 2007 ) proposed that the winds are anisotropic and outbursts occur due to enhanced accretion onto the neutron star when it crosses the equatorial disk component from the supergiant .",
    "however , it should be noted that in a short orbital period binary system , the accretion onto the compact object should continue for a large fraction of the orbit or the entire orbit . the average mass accretion rate should also be high and yield a relatively higher quiescent luminosity .",
    "grebenev @xmath3 sunyaev ( 2007 ) proposed that due to propeller effect , the compact object do not emit during quiescence , but are active when the wind density increases .",

    "( 2008 ) proposed that different orbital configurations lead to different subclasses of supergiant systems . according to their model , in short orbital period supergiant systems ,",
    "neutron star is embedded in a quasi - continuous wind and receives a significant fraction of clumps from the companion .",
    "whereas , in long orbital period systems , the wind fills a large volume and therefore , the clump density is small .",
    "bozzo et al .",
    "( 2008a ) also explained the flaring mechanism in the context of gated accretion .",
    "they proposed that accretion onto the compact object is inhibited when the magnetospheric radius becomes larger than the corotation radius .",
    "they showed that the large luminosity swings between the quiescent and outburst phase are due to the interaction of massive infalling wind with the neutron star magnetosphere .",
    "this in turn depends on the spin period of the neutron star and the magnetic field .",
    "however , the nature of the compact object is still unknown in a majority of sfxts .",
    "moreover , in a short orbital period binary with an eclipse lasting for @xmath1 20@xmath26 of the period , it is intersting to explore whether gated accretion mechanism can occur at a few stellar radii where the matter density and radiation pressure are high .",
    "further , in view of the results presented here , it is also important to explore the model put forth by negueruela et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , specially in the case of short orbital period systems .",
    "the unified @xmath17clumpy ",
    "wind model suggests that the short period systems should be bright for most of the time , but the sfxt igr j16479@xmath04514 spends most of the time in a quiescent phase , with luminosity well below the persistent bright state of normal supergiant systems .",
    "the observed short orbital period and the orbital modulation opens up many questions regarding the true nature of the super fast x - ray transients .",
    "sfxts share many properties with persistent accreting x - ray pulsars in supergiant hmxbs .",
    "the spectral properties of sfxts are similar to those of accreting x - ray pulsars and the compact object is expected to be a neutron star .",
    "but , pulsations have been detected only from two such systems .",
    "in particular , the quiescent and long term average luminosity of igr j16479@xmath04514 is higher that other sfxts but it is fainter as compared to persistent hmxbs .",
    "therefore , a short orbital period of igr j16479@xmath04514 and a relatively higher quiescent luminosity sheds light on the probable link between the classical persistent supergiant systems ( small and circular orbit ) and other classical sfxts ( large and eccentric orbits ) .",
    "the sharp eclipse of igr j16479@xmath04514 shows that it will also be possible to determine the orbital evolution of the x - ray binary by measuring the mid - eclipse times ( jain , paul @xmath3 dutta 2009 ) , even if the x - ray emission does not show pulsations .",
    "long term monitoring of all the sfxts is therefore important to study the physical phenomena behind their unusual behaviour .",
