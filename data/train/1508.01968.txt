    "most undergraduate physics students encounter special relativity and quantum mechanics in their second year through a course on _ modern physics .",
    "_ as these two topics do not fit particularly well with the intuition and skills they develop in their first - year courses , mathematical abstraction seems to be the path forward for many .",
    "if students are to gain insights and develop intuition in these two subjects at an early stage , it is important to make available to them several alternate routes of exploration . with regard to special relativity , students welcome the standard undergraduate introduction to minkowski spacetime diagrams , guessing that these diagrams will eventually be helpful for solving quantitative problems .",
    "unfortunately , this hope goes unrealized in most modern physics texts / courses because the diagrammatic approach is not developed beyond the descriptive level . in our experience , this does not stop students from attempting to adapt spacetime diagrams for quantitative use , often unsuccessfully .",
    "what these students would truly appreciate is the graphical construction introduced by minkowski in his famous 1908 lecture on spacetime diagrams,@xcite where the tilted and stretched  axes of a moving observer are overlaid on the cartesian  grid of a stationary observer ( for example , see fig .",
    "[ relativistic ] ) . from now on",
    ", we will use the term _ minkowski diagram _ to refer to this quantitative graphical construction , rather than the generic spacetime diagram ( or  plane ) of a single observer .",
    "the main purpose of this work is to showcase the multitude of ways in which minkowski diagrams can be used for instruction . in particular , we highlight several new ways of using and interpreting minkowski diagrams that we have developed .",
    "these together with well established applications are presented here in one place , as a complete set of graphical alternatives to all of the standard introductory lessons on the kinematics of special relativity . since standard",
    "pedagogy already makes use of spacetime diagrams in a qualitative sense , extending their use for quantitative purposes is , we believe , a natural and expected step .",
    "it is not our hope that the entire sequence laid out here will be adopted in full .",
    "however , continued access to it will , we believe , benefit most students and instructors .",
    "we also hope that this article will put minkowski diagrams on the same footing as other ( newer ) diagrammatic methods by presenting , in one place , a compilation of its uses , so that instructors may easily gauge the relative strengths and weaknesses of different methods .",
    "the minkowski diagram has long been recognized as an effective quantitative tool in special relativity.@xcite then , why is nt it used routinely in introductory treatments as a graphical alternative or to reinforce standard algebraic methods ?",
    "one reason implied in the literature,@xcite is the need for many geometrical constructs  triangles and invariant hyperbolae@xcite  and hence , `` busy diagrams '' in obtaining quantitative results . after a detailed survey of the literature ,",
    "another reason that stands out is the emergence of two other excellent graphical techniques in the late 1950s to early 1960s , which was also the time when introductory treatments of special relativity found their way into second - year undergraduate syllabuses . in these two graphical constructions , named loedel@xcite and brehme@xcite diagrams ,",
    "the two observers are treated more symmetrically than in the minkowski approach and , as a result , no stretching of @xmath0 and @xmath1 axes are required for either observer .",
    "hence , these diagrams were recognized as superior , simpler , and more appropriate for introductory treatments .",
    "we contend that the ultimate simplicity of loedel and brehme diagrams is achieved through a certain degree of abstraction and cleverness , which may not be ideal for an intuition - building introduction to special relativity .",
    "for instance , identifying / drawing trajectories ( worldlines ) of the two observers themselves on a brehme diagram requires a few steps in reasoning,@xcite unlike with minkowski diagrams where these trajectories are obvious .",
    "furthermore , loedel and brehme diagrams can not be used to _ derive _ special relativity from einstein s two postulates ; they are constructed by accepting the equality of the invariant interval between two inertial observers.@xcite on the other hand , the minkowski diagram can be constructed directly from the postulates , and this is a valid method of deriving special relativity , as demonstrated in max born s text on relativity.@xcite in addition , the loedel diagram and , therefore , the closely - related brehme diagram can be easily recognized as special applications of the minkowski diagram .    due to the above reasons or perhaps due to the perception that such an old technique must have already reached its pedagogical potential , there does not exist a comprehensive introductory treatment of special relativity , based on minkowski diagrams , to the best of our knowledge",
    ". meanwhile detailed introductory sequences based on other graphical techniques can easily be found in textbooks@xcite and pedagogy - oriented publications including this journal.@xcite the closest parallels to these treatments , that utilize minkowski diagrams , can be found on the worldwide web,@xcite not in print journals . on the other hand , _",
    "specific _ applications of minkowski diagrams have appeared in the past literature@xcite as well as in more recent journal articles.@xcite unfortunately , authors of recent graphical treatments seem to be unaware of the connection between their methods and the original work of minkowski .    over the past 2 years , we have assembled a complete and original lesson plan for introducing special relativity at the second - year level purely through minkowski diagrams .",
    "the complete cannon of introductory topics including the derivation of lorentz transformations , length contraction , time dilation , velocity addition , doppler shift , and an exposition of well know paradoxes are covered . in applying minkowski diagrams to these topics ,",
    "we have tried to use modern arguments that would be most transparent to current second - year students , given their usual preparation and experience at this stage .",
    "in particular , we have avoided excessive use of geometrical constructs including invariant hyperbolae .",
    "instead , we have pursued a unique approach where where the  grid pattern of a moving observer is examined using a mix of geometry and algebra .",
    "we have also tried to develop methods that are useful for solving standard textbook problems in special relativity .",
    "these goals were achievable mainly because the work was carried out as a student - faculty collaboration .",
    "the result of this work , which we present here , is a streamlined introductory sequence made up of succinct individual lessons that are often quite different from arguments / derivations we have seen in the previous literature or on the web .",
    "we start in section [ galilean ] with galilean transformations and an introduction to the graphical approach used here . in section [ derivation ] , using einstein s postulates and the previously developed graphical ideas , work toward lorentz transformations and the other kinematical results of special relativity . in section [ results ] , we demonstrate the usefulness of minkowski diagrams in deriving well know results and solving typical textbook problems . in section [ paradoxes ] , we demonstrate the use of this method in unraveling several well known paradoxes of special relativity . in this work",
    ", we will not cover the standard topics discussed in the context of generic spacetime diagrams , such as worldlines and light cones .",
    "those topics can be introduced prior to or in parallel with the development presented here .",
    "we introduce minkowski diagrams in the context of galilean transformations so that methods can be introduced independently from the surprises of relativity .",
    "initially , spacetime diagrams may be referred to as `` time vs. position graphs , '' as the unification of space and time comes later . on these position - time graphs ( e.g.  fig .",
    "[ galilean ] ) , one spatial dimension ( @xmath0 ) and the @xmath1 axis will be displayed , following convention .",
    "thus , the trajectories ( worldlines ) of light pulses have slopes of @xmath2     the parallelogram in dark outline is the unit cell of s grid .",
    "the dashed lines indicate how event p can be projected onto the  grid.,width=336 ]    on fig .",
    "[ galilean ] , we first note the  axes and square ( dotted - line ) grid of observer , who is stationary relative to the page .",
    "we regard s lines of constant @xmath0 ( vertical dotted lines ) as the worldlines of synchronized clocks spaced apart by unit length intervals along his @xmath0 axis . along these worldlines",
    ", we mark a set of points corresponding to the ticks of each clock .",
    "the lines of constant @xmath1 ( horizontal dotted lines ) are the lines connecting these clock ticks .",
    "next , we overlay on this graph the  grid of observer , who is moving with speed @xmath3 in the @xmath4 direction of observer .",
    "we do so by following the ticks and worldlines of equally - spaced synchronized clocks in observer s reference frame .",
    "the positions of these clocks at @xmath5 are marked by the crosses of fig .",
    "[ galilean ] . for convenience ,",
    "the origins of the two grids intersect at @xmath6 and the spatial axes of the two coordinate systems are aligned with each other .",
    "we can construct observer s position - time grid by adopting two `` postulates '' from _ day to day experience : _ * ( 1 ) * the size of a unit ruler does not change due to one s motion , and * ( 2 ) * all the clocks of a moving observer remain synchronized with one another and with the clocks of a stationary observer .",
    "it follows that the titled ( light ) solid lines of fig .",
    "[ galilean ] , with slope @xmath7 are lines of constant  while the horizontal dotted lines serve as lines of constant  as well .",
    "this type of diagram , where the position - time grids of both observers are overlaid , is what we will refer to as a _ minkowski diagram . _ in section [ derivation ] , we will replace the familiar postulates * ( 1 ) * and * ( 2 ) * with einstein s postulates to arrive at the relativistically correct form of the minkowski diagram .",
    "now , given the @xmath0 and @xmath1 coordinates of an event , such as event p of fig .",
    "[ galilean ] , one can project it onto the  grid as indicated by the dashed lines . using simple geometry and the fact that there is no motion along the @xmath8 and @xmath9 axes , it is easy to show that @xmath10 eqs .",
    "[ galilean_transformations ] are the galilean transformations , which we have derived using postulates * ( 1 ) * and * ( 2 ) * above . before starting on relativity , it is important to point out some key results that follow from fig .",
    "[ galilean ] . an object that moves with a constant velocity according to observer",
    "would be represented by a straight line in fig .",
    "[ galilean ] .",
    "this worldline would have a constant rise over run ( slope ) on the  grid as well .",
    "therefore , the object has a constant velocity according to observer  as well .",
    "however , the  velocity will _ always _ differ from the @xmath0 velocity by @xmath11 the relative velocity between  and .",
    "we begin with einstein s two postulates . a definition / explanation of inertial observers ,",
    "as those for whom the laws of physics assume their familiar and simple forms , should precede this .",
    "if an observer moves with constant velocity relative to an inertial observer , he / she is an inertial observer as well .",
    "all inertial observers will obtain / measure the same numerical value @xmath12 for the speed of light .",
    "we note that under these two postulates , it is still possible for each inertial observer to set up a system of synchronized clocks as before .",
    "many introductory texts on relativity describe in detail how a 3-d jungle gym of clocks can be synchronized , most often using light signals , in a world where the above postulates are true.@xcite thus , given that  is inertial , his position - time grid can still be represented by the dotted lines of fig .  [ galilean ] .",
    "now , according to postulate 1 above ,  is also inertial , as he moves with constant velocity relative to .",
    "however , it is obvious that observer s coordinate grid can no longer be represented as in fig .",
    "[ galilean ] because , according to that representation , the speed of a light pulse moving in the positive ( negative ) @xmath0 direction of observer  would be @xmath13 for . our goal is to find the correct representation of s grid .",
    "we will start by asking which aspects of fig .",
    "[ galilean ] we should keep and which aspect we need to change .      * 1 . * observer s  axis and other lines of constant  should continue to be straight lines with slope @xmath7 because they are the worldlines of clocks that move along with observer  at speed @xmath3 relative to observer .",
    "next , we ask if the stars along the  axis of fig .",
    "[ galilean ] , which are the ticks of s clock at unit time intervals , could be spaced differently than they are .",
    "it is easy to appreciate that such a change would cause s speed of light measurements to yield values different from @xmath14 physically , we are asking whether we ( and observer ) might observe s clocks to be ticking at a different rate from s clocks due to s motion , even though all clocks were manufactured identically .",
    "although we will not answer this question definitively just yet , let us keep the option to change the spacing between stars on the @xmath15 axis .",
    "we have represented this freedom in fig .",
    "[ freedoms ] .",
    "however , we require that the stars are _ equally _ spaced along the ( @xmath15 ) axis .",
    "physically , this is equivalent to requiring that the relationship between s clocks and s clocks depends solely on their relative motion and not on the specific time on an observer s clock or the absolute distance between observers .",
    "next , we turn our attention to the @xmath16 axis",
    ". our guiding principle here will be that all observers identified as being inertial by  must also appear inertial to .",
    "thus , all straight lines in s coordinate system should have a constant slope ( rise over run ) in s coordinates as well .",
    "this constrains the @xmath16 axis to be represented by a straight line and his unit length markings along @xmath16 ( crosses ) to be equally spaced . for the moment , we acknowledge the possibility that the @xmath16 axis may not be parallel to that of observer  and that the unit length marks on it may be spaced differently from the unit length marks on s @xmath0 axis",
    ". we will elaborate on the physical significance of these potential differences later .",
    "-@xmath17 coordinate system may look like .",
    "the spacing between crosses ( unit length markings ) , the spacing between stars ( unit time markings ) , and the angle of the @xmath16 axis have been chosen arbitrarily here , as we have not determined those parameters thus far .",
    "an important result is that s coordinate grid can be completely characterized by the repeating unit - cell parallelogram highlighted here.,width=336 ]    fig .  [ freedoms ] encapsulates our present reasoning on what s position - time grid may look like .",
    "an important result is that s position - time grid can be completely characterized by the repeating parallelogram indicated in fig .",
    "[ freedoms ] .",
    "its sides represent s unit length and time intervals .",
    "therefore , we concentrate on this `` unit cell '' from now on .",
    "so far , the undetermined properties of the unit cell are the lengths of its @xmath16 and @xmath15 sides and the slope ( or angle ) of the @xmath16 side",
    ". we can easily utilize these degrees of freedom so that the speed of a particular light pulse will be measured as @xmath12 ( not @xmath18 for example ) by observer .",
    "for instance , consider a light pulse traveling in the @xmath4 direction . according to observer",
    ", its worldline has a slope of 1 and can be represented by the long dark solid line of fig .  [ bad_cells ] .",
    "this figure also shows several options for s unit cell that will yield a slope of 1 in s spacetime diagram . in these trial unit cells ,",
    "the @xmath16 side has been kept horizontal .",
    "the problem with the trial unit cells of fig .  [ bad_cells ] is that they do not yield the correct speed for a light pulse traveling in the @xmath19 direction , represented in fig .",
    "[ bad_cells ] by the dark solid line with slope -1 .",
    "the problem is that this line does not connect two opposite vertices of the trial unit cells .",
    "therefore , if we were to construct s position - time grid from these unit cells , the worldlines of left - ward moving light pulses would not have a slope of -1 .",
    "the requirement that both light pulses must travel a unit length per unit time in s frame results in the following geometrical constraint on s unit cell :    _ the two lines that connect opposite vertices must have slopes of + 1 and -1 .",
    "_    after some exploration , students will realize that the correct unit cell must look like the parallelogram in dark outline in fig .",
    "[ good_cells ] .",
    "the dashed lines are the lines of slope @xmath20 that connect opposite vertices of the unit cell .",
    "it is easy to show that the four right triangles separated by the dashed lines are identical .",
    "therefore , we find that ( 1 ) the @xmath16 and @xmath15 sides of the unit cell have the same length , and ( 2 ) the slope of the @xmath16 side is @xmath21 the inverse of the slope of the @xmath15 side .      at this , point we recommend pointing out the physical significance of observer s  axis being tilted relative to s @xmath0 axis .",
    "the @xmath0 axis identifies events that are simultaneous with @xmath22 in observer s reference frame .",
    "similarly , the  axis identifies events that are simultaneous with @xmath23 in s reference frame .",
    "earlier , we required that the two coordinate origins pass though each other at @xmath24 from the shape of observer s unit cell ( fig .",
    "[ good_cells ] ) , we can clearly see that  and  identify _ different sets of events _ as being simultaneous with that event , and hence that simultaneity is a not an absolute concept , but rather depends on one s reference frame .",
    "the surprising implications of this truth will be highlighted in sections [ results ] and [ paradoxes ] .",
    "having established the shape observer s unit cell , the next step is to find its size .",
    "this is tantamount to finding the value of the `` scaling constant '' @xmath25 in fig .  [ good_cells].@xcite to do so , we must use the concept of reciprocity between observers  and .",
    "the particular method that we follow , makes use of some very basic linear algebra .",
    "we recommend this approach because it ( 1 ) automatically yields lorentz transformations , and ( 2 ) fits better with modern pedagogy in terms of viewing lorentz transformations themselves as mathematical objects , or operators .",
    "most second year students are familiar with matrices and matrix sums .",
    "in addition , they have or will soon encounter linear algebra in their course work and this derivation will serve as a prelude or reinforcement of those concepts .",
    "in appendix i , we provide a more traditional geometrical derivation of the value of @xmath26    we start by considering observer s point of view . on his position - time graph ,",
    "the @xmath16 and @xmath15 axes are orthogonal and the unit interval markings ( tick marks ) on both these axes are spaced precisely one unit apart . in moving to observer s representation of this coordinate system , these two axes tilt and",
    "the space between tick marks may change , as far as we know . in fig .",
    "[ good_cells ] , the parallelogram in dark outline represents this transformation .",
    "we note , however , that ( a ) the  and  axes are still straight lines , and ( b ) the space between tick marks on these axes , even if different from 1 , remains a constant .",
    "as properties ( a ) and ( b ) are synonymous with _ linear transformations , _ we can now find the matrix representation of this transformation .",
    "we do this by following how unit vectors in s coordinate system get represented in s coordinate system .",
    "let @xmath27 and @xmath28 be unit vectors along the  and axes respectively , as represented on observer s position - time graph . according to fig .",
    "[ good_cells ] , the move to s coordinate system has the following effect : @xmath29 therefore , the matrix that performs the this transformation must be @xmath30 thus a general event represented by the vector @xmath31 in s reference may be transformed into s frame as @xmath32    a move from s coordinate system to s proceeds in a perfectly symmetric manner .",
    "the parallelogram with the light outline in fig .",
    "[ good_cells ] shows how s unit cell would be represented in s position - time graph .",
    "this parallelogram differs from the first one only in terms of its sides having negative slopes , due to observer  moving in the @xmath33 direction of observer .",
    "therefore , using similar reasoning as above , we find that the matrix for transforming events from s coordinates to s is @xmath34 where @xmath25 stands for the very same scaling constant as before .",
    "using @xmath35 we can conveniently convert an event s @xmath36 coordinates to @xmath37 coordinates .",
    "of course , we need to know the value of @xmath25 to fully define the matrix operators @xmath38 and @xmath39 we can find @xmath25 by requiring that a vector remains unchanged if the two transformations are performed in sequence on an event , or @xmath40 carrying out the matrix sum , we finally find that @xmath41 in the process , we have derived lorentz transformations in the form of eqs . 2 and 3 .",
    "actually , a complete lorentz transformation must be represented by a 4-dimensional matrix and we still need to show that its second and third rows / columns , corresponding to the @xmath8 and @xmath9 transformations , are trivial .",
    "first , it is easy to argue that the  and  axes can not have projections along the @xmath8 and @xmath9 axes due to the complete symmetry of the situation with regard to those dimensions . thus , the second and third rows can only have diagonal elements .",
    "the requirement that @xmath42 allows us to conclude that the diagonal elements are 1 .",
    "thus , the complete lorentz transformation will have the form @xmath43 written out as individual equations , the final form of the lorentz transformation is @xmath44 the opposite transformation ( from s frame to s ) looks identical except for a switch in the signs preceding @xmath45          since the @xmath8 and @xmath9 transformations are trivial , the non - trivial content of lorentz transformations can be captured in the  graph of fig .",
    "[ relativistic ] . in it",
    ", we are now able to correctly represent observer s spacetime diagram on top of observer s . in fig .  [ relativistic ]",
    ", the grid lines parallel to the @xmath0 and @xmath16 axes should be viewed as lines of simultaneity for observers  and  respectively .",
    "the lines parallel to the @xmath1 and @xmath15 axes represent fixed positions in their respective reference frames .    in order to make quantitative use of diagrams such as fig .  [ relativistic ]",
    ", we need to know one more geometric quantity : the size of unit intervals along the  and  axes .",
    "these are the intervals marked by stars and crosses on those axes .",
    "they obviously have unit length in observer s own reference frame , but get stretched in the lorentz transformation @xmath46 in fig .",
    "[ good_cells ] , we defined @xmath25 as the projection of the unit  interval onto the @xmath0 axis and the unit interval onto the @xmath1 axis . from this and the slopes of the and  axes in fig .",
    "[ relativistic ] , we find that @xmath47    therefore , when converting a line - segment length along the axis into and an actual length that observer  would measure , we must divide by the factor @xmath48 similarly , when converting a line - segment length along the  axis into an actual time as judged by , we must divide by @xmath49 we note that , a lorentz transformation from s frame to s frame is completely equivalent to ( 1 ) projecting an event , such as event p in fig .  [ relativistic ] , onto the  and  axes , as shown by the dashed lines , and ( 2 ) converting the projected line - segment lengths into length and time intervals , using the above factors .",
    "we find that it is usually more convenient to perform _ lorentz transformations _ algebraically using eqs .",
    "[ lorentz_transformations ] , which were derived here using diagrams .",
    "however , for many of the other results and applications of special relativity , we believe that the method of minkowski diagrams is as illuminating or more illuminating compared to standard algebraic methods . therefore , we point out these uses in sections [ results ] and [ paradoxes ] .    finally , the correct recipe for drawing observer s spacetime diagram on top of observer s , as in fig  [ relativistic ] , is the following :    1 .   draw the  axis as a line of slope @xmath50 that passes through the origin of the  grid of observer .",
    "2 .   draw the  axis as a line of slope @xmath51 that passes through the origin of the  grid of observer .",
    "thus , the angle between the @xmath0 and  axes is the same as the angle between the @xmath1 and  axes .",
    "mark stars ( clock ticks ) along the  axis and crosses ( unit length intervals ) on the  axis , separated by a distance @xmath48    in our case , the above steps are motivated by the entire development up to this point . however ,",
    "if one arrives at lorentz transformations through a different route , these three steps can be directly tied to the lorentz transformation equations ( eqs .  [ lorentz_transformations ] ) as follows .",
    "since the  axis is the @xmath52 line , its equation on the  plane can be found by setting to zero the l.h.s .  of the first equation in eqs .",
    "[ lorentz_transformations ] .",
    "this motivates step 1 above .",
    "similarly , step 2 can be motivated by setting @xmath23 in the last of eqs .",
    "[ lorentz_transformations ] .",
    "next , one can find the @xmath53 line and its intersection with the  axis , using eqs .",
    "[ lorentz_transformations ] , to derive the size of unit length intervals on the  axis ( step 3 ) .",
    "unit  intervals can be found in a similar way .      in many introductory treatments , the idea of unifying space and time into one entity ",
    "spacetime  is rationalized as follows : ( 1 ) unlike with galilean transformations where time is absolute , space and time are `` mixed '' thoroughly by lorentz transformations ; ( 2 ) there exists a metric for spacetime that remains invariant between inertial observers .",
    "we believe that , even at the introductory level , the concept of spacetime needs to be justified with more quantitative substance than this .",
    "in particular , it should be pointed out that _ quantities of spacetime _ are conserved by lorentz transformations .",
    "what we mean here by a _",
    "quantity _ or _",
    "amount _ of spacetime is the 4-dimensional hyper - volume occupied by a region of spacetime .",
    "algebraically , the above property is a consequence of _ proper _ lorentz transformations having unit determinant .",
    "however , at the introductory level this property can most easily be demonstrated graphically . because the @xmath8 and @xmath9 transformations are trivial , a 2-d diagram such as fig .",
    "[ relativistic ] is sufficient for our purposes . in it",
    ", a 4-d hyper - volume of spacetime translates to a 2-d area on the plane .",

    "the number of s unit cell parallelograms that would fit within this region is equal to the number of s own unit cells that would fit within it .",
    "thus ,  and  would agree about the _ amount _ of space - time that was marked out even though the shape of this patch would look different in their own spacetime diagrams . therefore , quantities / amounts of spacetime have physical meaning across inertial reference frames .",
    "this , we believe , strengthens the rationale for adopting the concept of spacetime .",
    "the invariance of the common metric used with spacetime  the invariant interval  can be presented as a consequence of the above result .",
    "given the 4-coordinates of two events , we can position observer s coordinate system so that his origin coincides with one of the events and the spatial separation between the two events lies purely along the @xmath0 dimension .",
    "therefore , in s reference frame , the separation between the events can be represented by the vector @xmath60 where @xmath61 and @xmath62 are the spatial and temporal separations .",
    "next , we can construct a parallelogram on the  plane using the above vector and its `` transpose , '' @xmath63 using the cross product of these two vectors , one finds that the area of this parallelogram is @xmath64 in observer s  plane this parallelogram will deform into a different parallelogram with area @xmath65 but we know that the two observers will agree on the area of this parallelogram , which results in @xmath66",

    "we stress that our methods are equally well suited for introducing these topics as well as for working problems related to them .      with the above point in mind",
    ", we will discuss time dilation and length contraction in terms of a problem that is typical of sophomore - level textbooks : an observer on the ground sees an airplane traveling at speed @xmath3 flying parallel to an airstrip of length @xmath67 on the ground .",
    "therefore , she finds that the airplane traverses the length of the airstrip in time @xmath68 ( a ) according to the pilot of the airplane , how much time does the airplane take to traverse the length of the airstrip ?        in fig .",

    "the front tip of the airplane just reaching the far end of the airstrip is represented by event c. the time interval of interest is the time recorded for event c in the two reference frames . in the ground frame , @xmath71 is the length of lc , which can be computed from the length of ol ( @xmath67 ) and the slope of the  axis ( @xmath50 ) .",

    "this is because they can not visualize events such as o and c  the front tip of the airplane intersecting the beginning and then the end of the airstrip  occuring at the same position in one observer s reference frame .",
    "[ dilation ] explicitly illustrates that oc is a proper time in the pilot s frame , as it lies on the  axis ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "given the generality of the derivation , it will also be clear that `` improper '' time intervals are always _ dilated _ by the factor @xmath25 relative to proper time intervals .",
    "the natural continuation of the above problem is : ( b ) does the pilot of the airplane measure a different length for the airstrip , and if so , what is that length ?",
    "[ dilation ] offers a good opportunity to stress what is meant by _ length .",

    "in other words , it is the size of an object measured along a line of simultaneity .",
    "for example , the unit length intervals along the  axis ( marked with x s in fig .  [ relativistic ] ) are lengths for observer , while ol in fig .",
    "[ dilation ] represents a length for observer .",
    "thus , the length of the airstrip as measured by the pilot is represented by the line segment om . from the slope of the  axis ( @xmath51 ) and the pythagorean theorem ,",
    "the length of om is found to be @xmath79 as found in section [ recipes ] , this must be divided by @xmath80 to yield a distance as measured by the pilot .",
    "thus , the pilot measures the airstrip to have length @xmath81 given the generality of this derivation , it is clear that the length of an object is largest in its own rest frame ; it is smaller by a factor of @xmath25 when measured from a different frame .",
    "the question addressed here is : if a projectile moves with constant velocity @xmath82 in observer s reference frame , what is its velocity @xmath83 in s reference frame ?",
    "a projection of this situation along the @xmath0 direction is shown in fig .",
    "[ velocity ] .",
    "one way for  to establish the projectile s velocity is to measure the @xmath84 @xmath85 and @xmath86 coordinates of the projectile when exactly 1 time unit has elapsed on his own clock .        in fig .",

[ lorentz_transformations ] ) , we find that @xmath94    a common problem with relativistic velocity addition is the difficulty in intuiting why @xmath95 appears in the expressions for @xmath96 and @xmath97 especially since the lorentz transformations for @xmath8 and @xmath9 and trivial .",
    "[ velocity ] is very useful in this regard .",
    "the critical step is to understand the physical significance of event p. it represents the coordinates of the projectile , as judged by observer , exactly when his clock registers 1 .",
    "therefore , @xmath98 however , @xmath99 clearly depends on the slope of the projectile s trajectory on the  plane , and hence on @xmath100 it is through @xmath99 that @xmath95 finds its way into the expressions for @xmath96 and @xmath101    next , we need to find @xmath102 this is equal to @xmath103 which is represented by line segment tp in fig .",

    "thereafter , it _ is _ possible to find the  and  values of the event using purely geometry .",
    "however , we find that geometrical solutions turn out to be as lengthy as the derivation of the lorentz transformation .",

    "[ lorentz_transformations ] for these problems , which were derived here using minkowski diagrams .    in another class of problems ,",

    "students are asked whether these two events can occur at the same position in some observer s reference frame and , if so , what the velocity of that observer needs to be .",
    "alternately , they are asked if the two events can be simultaneous for some observer and , if so , what the velocity of the that observer needs to be .",
    "these problems can be solved very easily using minkowski diagrams and , in our experience , most relativity instructors / texts do recommend spacetime diagrams for solving problems of this sort .",
    "the major theme that links the famous relativistic paradoxes is the relativity of simultaneity .",
    "the graphical methods developed here are especially helpful for visualizing the latter and , therefore , for unraveling paradoxes .",
    "we will briefly describe how four well known paradoxes can easily be visualized using the methods developed here .      in the following",
    ", we will refer to an observer s lines of simultaneity as his / her `` time - frames . '' from minkowski diagrams , it is clear that even if observer  moves at a walking pace relative to , his time - frames are very slightly tilted relative to s time - frames . according to fig .",
    "[ relativistic ] , events in the positive @xmath0 direction , that are in s _ present _ time - frame are in a _ future _ time - frame of observer .",
    "events in s present time - frame that are in the negative @xmath0 direction are in the past of observer . even when @xmath3 ( the relative velocity between  and ) is very small , a difference in the time assigned to a remote event by  and  can be quite large when the event is located very far away .",
    "for instance , suppose that intelligent beings within the andromeda galaxy have just now learned of the existence of humans on earth .",
    "now , by starting to walk in the direction of the andromeda galaxy you will be able to `` dial in '' to your time - frame a later date on the andromedan s calendar . perhaps by that date , after careful consideration , they have already launched a fleet of spaceships to conquer the earth .",
    "it is important to stress that this time - frame jump is a non - local ( or remote ) effect and that , for instance , we can not use it to influence the eventual actions of the andromedan fleet .",
    "however , as we will see in the context of the next paradox , the ability to dial in various dates on a remote calendar into one s time - frame can lead to interesting local effects as well .      in this",
    "well known paradox , one twin stays on the earth while the other races to a distant point in space at a significant fraction of @xmath122 quickly turns around , and returns to earth at the same high speed .",
    "when they reunite , the earth - bound twin has aged more than the astronaut twin .",
    "the apparent paradox is that the motion of the astronaut twin relative to the earth - bound twin is exactly the same as the motion of the earth - bound twin relative to the astronaut twin .",
    "therefore , how can there be an asymmetry in their aging ?    in most textbooks , it is explained that the simple time dilation calculation ( dividing by @xmath25 ) is only applicable from an inertial , or non - accelerating , frame .",
    "thus , we can employ the simple calculation from the reference frame of the earth - bound twin but not the astronaut .",
    "therefore , the answer obtained this way by the earth - bound twin  that the astronaut twin ages less  must be correct . to strengthen this argument",
    ", many authors use spacetime diagrams and follow the transmission and reception of light signals issued by the two twins .",
    "these diagrams are very good at dispelling any doubts that the astronaut twin ages less .",
    "however , these approaches fall short of pinpointing , as the explicit cause of unequal aging , the intense acceleration of the astronaut twin during the turn - around . with minkowski diagrams",
    ", we can directly visualize how one twin perceives the passage of time of the other twin , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ twins ] .     axis and",
    "then returns to it is the astronaut twin s worldline .",
    "the dashed lines and the light solid lines are lines of simultaneity of the earth - bound and the astronaut twins respectively.,height=240 ]    the dashed horizontal lines are the earth - bound twin s time - frames ( lines of simultaneity ) that mark one - year intervals since the astronaut s departure .",
    "the tilted solid lines are the astronaut s time - frames , separated along her worldline by intervals that correspond to a year . during most of the",
    "out - bound and return legs of the trip , both twins observe the other s time progressing at a fixed but slow rate .",
    "for instance , the earth - bound twin s year-2 time - frame ( the second dashed horizontal line from the bottom ) intersects the astronaut s worldline before year-2 arrives on the astronaut s calendar .",
    "similarly , the astronaut s year-2 time - frame intersects the @xmath1 axis below the second dashed line .",
    "note that the astronaut s time - frames have a slope of @xmath21 where @xmath3 is the speed of the astronaut at the intersection of the astronaut s time - frame and worldline .",
    "therefore , between year 3 and year 4 the slope of these time - frames undergoes a rapid change ( from positive to negative ) . as a result",
    ", she `` dials in '' a quickly incrementing sequence of dates on the earth - bound twin s calendar into her own time - frame .",
    "thus , from her point of view , the earth - bound twin ages very quickly during the turn - around .",
    "in fact , at the end of year-4 on the astronaut s calendar , she estimates that the earth - bound twin has aged @xmath123 years .",
    "although the mutual perception that the other twin ages more slowly is restored soon after the turn - around , the astronaut twin can never catch up with this difference and returns to earth one year younger than the earth - bound twin . on the other hand , the earth - bound twin `` judges '' that the astronaut ages at essentially the same slow rate throughout the journey.@xcite      a group of physicists convince a pole vaulter to run very fast while carrying his pole , in order to demonstrate lorentz contraction . to prove their point , the physicists ask the pole vaulter to run through a barn that is shorter than the rest - frame length of the pole . at the beginning of the demonstration , the _ entry door _ of the barn",
    "is open and the _ exit door _ of the barn is closed . according to the physicists plan",
    ", the pole vaulter will enter the barn through the entry door .",
    "once the contracted pole is fully contained within the barn , the entry door will be closed first .",
    "next , the exit door is opened to allow pole vaulter to exit the barn without accident .",
    "of course , the physicists at each door must synchronize their clocks and be able to open / close doors by a sufficient amount almost instantaneously .",
    "even so , if the pole vaulter knew about relativity , he would not have agreed to this exercise , would he ? for , in his frame , the barn would appear even shorter than normal compared to the pole , due to lorentz contraction .",
    "thus , the pole would never fit within the barn and would surely collide with at least one of the doors because there is never a time when both doors are open .",
    "the physicists , on the other hand , believe that no collision will take place . in the end , only one answer ",
    "collision or no collision  can be correct .",
    "but none of the viewpoints expressed above seem to be wrong .",
    "axis and the vertical dashed line is the spacetime traced out by the barn .",
    "the tilted dark solid lines are snapshots of the pole in its rest frame at two points in time .",
    "the tilted dashed line and the  axis are the worldlines of the two ends of the pole .",
    "event n represents the closing of the entry door and event p represents the opening of the exit door.,width=240 ]    the key to this paradox is the difference between the pole vaulter s and physicists time - frames . fig .  [ pole ] illustrates the resolution of this paradox quite simply .",
    "the physicists frame is the stationary one ( observer ) .",
    "the barn and the pole are labeled along the @xmath5 and @xmath23 time - frames respectively .",
    "the two critical events in this demonstration  the closing of the entry door and the opening of the exit door  are events n and p respectively .",
    "the key here is to realize that the pole vaulter s lines of simultaneity are parallel to the pole in fig .",
    "[ pole ] and , therefore , events n and p occur in reverse order . thus , in the pole vaulter s reference frame , the exit door opens _ before _ the entry door closes !",
    "thus , the pole vaulter must agree with the physicists that no collision will take place .",
    "two rockets in space are at rest relative to the earth .",
    "they are tied together with a stretched rope .",
    "if the rope is stretched anymore , it will break .",
    "the pilots of the rockets set off on a journey but agree to reach cruising speed by using a synchronized sequence of accelerations .",
    "the pilots believe that , because they accelerate in unison , the rocket - rope - rocket system will reach cruising speed as one object , and the rope will not be stretched anymore .",
    "therefore , it will not break .",
    "the pilots point out that those on earth would observe the gap between the two rockets ( occupied by the rope ) to lorentz contract . on the other hand ,",
    "an earth observer insists that he would measure the gap between the rockets to remain unchanged if the pilots do indeed accelerate their rockets in a synchronized manner .",
    "he argues that the pilots , in their frame , would find the separation between rockets to increase .",
    "therefore , the rope would break .",
    "the object here is to determine whose argument is flawed and , therefore , whether the rope breaks or not .",
    "it turns out that neither argument is wrong , just that the statement `` synchronized accelerations '' can not apply to both the pilots frame ( once they start moving ) and the earth frame .",
    "if the rocket thrusts appear to be synchronized to the earth observer , the pilots would detect a delay between the thrusts of the two rockets . in that case ,",
    "the assertion of the earth observer , that the rope will break , will come true . in fig .",
    "[ rockets ] , we illustrate the opposite case where the thrusts are synchronized in the pilots frame .",
    "the three thrusts lie along the pilots lines of simultaneity at the time . in the earth frame ( the stationary one )",
    ", rocket b always accelerates later , causing the gap between the two to contract .",
    "therefore , in this case , the rope does not break .",
    "minkowski diagrams deserve a prominent place among the pedagogical tools used for introducing special relativity to undergraduates . the graphical lessons presented here can serve as the primary means of instruction or an alternate route available to students .",
    "the major advantages of the methods presented here are :    1 .",
    "the use of diagrams helps students visualize situations and facilitates qualitative reasoning .",
    "this is key to true learning and retention .",
    "the availability of graphical alternatives is important for enabling a more conceptual and intuitive grasp of relativity as opposed to math - based proficiency .",
    "2 .   converting qualitative reasoning to quantitative answers requires just a few simple steps , as outlined in section [ recipes ] .",
    "the brevity of this section illustrates how easily these diagrams can be adapted for quantitative use .",
    "the usefulness of minkowski diagrams is not limited to a subset of introductory topics .",
    "methods based on them are as effective and elegant as any other treatment of the complete cannon of introductory topics , that range from galilean transformations and the notion of inertial observers , to deriving lorentz transformations , time dilation , length contraction , and other important results , to resolving difficult paradoxes in relativity .",
    "our main goal has been to present , in one place , a complete set of introductory lesson plans based on minkowski diagrams .",
    "we have also pursued a modern and systematic approach suited to present - day undergraduate instruction .",
    "here , we find the value of @xmath25 using a purely geometrical approach as an alternative to the derivation of section [ lorentz ] .",
    "note that @xmath124 at this point , is simply a geometrical factor that sets the size of the unit parallelogram of observer , as shown in fig .",
    "[ gamma_geom ] .",
    "the projection of event p , the top left corner of s unit cell , onto the @xmath1 axis has the following physical meaning .",
    "observer  judges that the first tick of observer s clock ( when @xmath125 ) is simultaneous with his own clock reading a value of @xmath126 not 1 .",
    "observer  should come to the same conclusion about the rate at which observer s clock advances .",
    "therefore , according to him , s clock reads @xmath127 when his own clock reads @xmath128 the dashed line of fig .",
    "[ gamma_geom ] represents s unit - time line of simultaneity .",
    "since the @xmath1 intercept of this line is @xmath129 and the slope of s line of simultaneity is @xmath21 the expression for the dashed line is @xmath130 the  axis may be described by the expression @xmath114 by equating these two expressions , we find the  coordinates of event p to be @xmath131 but @xmath25 is defined as @xmath132 in fig .",
