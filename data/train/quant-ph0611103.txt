    "after its prediction in 1948 @xcite , the casimir force has been observed in a number of ` historic ' experiments which confirmed its existence and main properties @xcite . with present day technology ,",
    "a new generation of casimir force measurements has started since nearly a decade ago @xcite .",
    "these experiments have reached a good enough accuracy to allow for a comparison between theoretical predictions and experimental observations which is of great interest for various reasons @xcite .",
    "the casimir force is the most accessible effect of vacuum fluctuations in the macroscopic world .",
    "as the existence of vacuum energy raises difficulties at the interface between the theories of quantum and gravitational phenomena , it is worth testing this effect with the greatest care and highest accuracy @xcite .",
    "a precise knowledge of the casimir force is also a key point in many accurate force measurements for distances ranging from nanometer to millimeter .",
    "these experiments are motivated either by tests of newtonian gravity at millimetric distances @xcite or by searches for new weak forces predicted in theoretical unification models with nanometric to millimetric ranges @xcite",
    ". basically , they aim at putting limits on deviations of experimental results from present standard theory . as the casimir force is the dominant force between two neutral non - magnetic objects in the range of interest",
    ", any new force would appear as a difference between experimental measurements and theoretical expectations of the casimir force . on a technological side",
    ", the casimir force has been shown to become important in the architecture of micro- and nano - oscillators ( mems , nems ) @xcite . in this context , it is extremely important to account for the conditions of real experiments .",
    "the comparison between theory and experiment should take into account the important differences between the real experimental conditions and the ideal situation considered by casimir .",
    "casimir calculated the force between a pair of perfectly smooth , flat and parallel plates in the limit of zero temperature and perfect reflection ( see fig.[fig1a ] ) .",
    "apart.,width=151 ]    he found an expression for the force @xmath0 and the corresponding energy @xmath1 which only depend on the distance @xmath2 , the area @xmath3 and two fundamental constants , the speed of light @xmath4 and planck constant @xmath5 @xmath6 each transverse dimension of the plates has been supposed to be much larger than @xmath2 .",
    "conventions of sign have been chosen so that @xmath0 is positive while @xmath1 is negative .",
    "they correspond to an attractive force ( @xmath7n for @xmath8 and @xmath9 m ) and a binding energy .",
    "the fact that the casimir force ( [ fcasimir ] ) only depends on fundamental constants and geometrical features is remarkable . in particular",
    "it is independent of the fine structure constant which appears in the expression of the atomic van der waals forces .",
    "this universality property is related to the assumption of perfect reflection used by casimir in his derivation .",
    "perfect mirrors correspond to a saturated response to the fields since they reflect 100% of the incoming light .",
    "this explains why the casimir effect , though it has its microscopic origin in the interaction of electrons with electromagnetic fields , does not depend on the fine structure constant .",
    "however , no real mirror can be considered as a perfect reflector at all field frequencies .",
    "in particular , the most precise experiments are performed with metallic mirrors which show perfect reflection only at frequencies smaller than a characteristic plasma frequency @xmath10 which depends on the properties of conduction electrons in the metal .",
    "hence the casimir force between metal plates can fit the ideal casimir formula ( [ fcasimir ] ) only at distances @xmath2 much larger than the plasma wavelength @xmath11 for metals used in the recent experiments , this wavelength lies in the @xmath12 m range ( 107 nm for al and 137 nm for cu and au ) . at distances smaller than or of the order of the plasma wavelength , the finite conductivity of the metal has a significant effect on the force .",
    "the idea has been known since a long time @xcite but a precise quantitative investigation of the effect of imperfect reflection has been systematically developed only recently @xcite . as the effect of imperfect reflection is large in the most accurate experiments , a precise knowledge of its frequency dependence is essential for obtaining an accurate theoretical prediction of the casimir force .",
    "this is also true for other corrections to the ideal casimir formula associated with the experimental configuration . for experiments at room temperature ,",
    "the effect of thermal field fluctuations , superimposed to that of vacuum , affects the casimir force at distances larger than a few microns .",
    "again the idea has been known for a long time @xcite but a quantitative evaluation taking into account the correlation of this effect with that of imperfect reflection has been mastered only recently @xcite .",
    "a number of publications have given rise to contradictory estimations of the casimir force between dissipative mirrors at non zero temperature @xcite .",
    "many attempts have been made to elucidate the problem by taking into account the low - frequency character of the force between metallic films @xcite , the spatial dispersion on electromagnetic surface modes @xcite or the transverse momentum dependance of surface impedances @xcite .",
    "experimentally the effect of temperature of the casimir force has not yet be conclusively measured @xcite .",
    "for a recent analysis of this issue see reference @xcite .",
    "most experiments are performed between a plane and a sphere with the force estimation involving a geometry correction .",
    "usually the casimir force in the plane - sphere ( ps ) geometry is calculated using the proximity force approximation ( pfa ) .",
    "this approximation amounts to the addition of force or energy contributions corresponding to different local inter - plate distances , assuming these contributions to be independent .",
    "but the casimir force and energy are not additive , so that the pfa can not be exact , although it is often improperly called a theorem .    in the present review ,",
    "we consider both the original casimir geometry with perfectly plane and parallel mirrors and the plane - sphere geometry when comparing to experiments .",
    "the pfa is expected to be valid in the plane - sphere geometry , when the sphere radius @xmath13 is much larger than the separation @xmath2 @xcite , which is the case for all present day experiments , and it will thus be used to connect the two geometries . in this case , the force @xmath14 between a sphere of radius @xmath13 and a plane at a distance of closest approach @xmath2 is given in terms of the energy @xmath15 for the plane - plane cavity as follows @xmath16 interesting attempts to go beyond this approximation concerning the plane - sphere geometry have been made recently @xcite , in the more general context of the connection between geometry and the casimir effect @xcite .",
    "another important correction to the casimir force is coming from surface roughness , which is intrinsic to any real mirror , with amplitude and spectrum varying depending on the surface preparation techniques . the departure from flatness of the metallic plates",
    "may also be designed , in particular under the form of sinusoidal corrugation of the plates which produce a measurable lateral component of the casimir force @xcite . for a long time , these roughness or corrugation corrections to the casimir force have been calculated with methods valid only in limiting cases @xcite or by using pfa @xcite . once again",
    ", it is only recently that emphasis has been put on the necessity of a more general method for evaluating the effect of roughness outside the region of validity of pfa with imperfect mirrors at arbitrary distances from each other @xcite . while the condition @xmath17 is sufficient for applying the pfa in the plane - sphere geometry ,",
    "more stringent conditions are needed for pfa to hold for rough or corrugated surfaces .",
    "the surfaces should indeed be nearly plane when looked at on a scale comparable with the separation @xmath2 , and this condition is not always satisfied in experiments .",
    "when pfa is no longer valid , the effect of roughness or corrugation can be evaluated by using the scattering theory extended to the case of non - specular reflection .",
    "we review the casimir effect within scattering theory and the theory of quantum optical networks .",
    "the main idea of this derivation is that the casimir force has its origin in a difference of the radiation pressure of vacuum fields between the two mirrors and in the outer free field vacuum .",
    "this vacuum radiation pressure can be written as an integral over all modes , each mode being associated with reflection amplitudes on the two mirrors .",
    "we first present formulas written for specular reflection which are valid for lossless@xcite as well as lossy mirrors @xcite .",
    "we discuss the influence of the mirrors reflection coefficients at zero and non - zero temperature .",
    "we then extend the approach to the case of non - specular reflection which mixes the field polarizations and transverse wave - vectors .",
    "finally we apply the latter approach to the calculation of the roughness correction to the casimir force between metallic mirrors @xcite and of the lateral component of the casimir force between corrugated plates @xcite .",
    "let us first consider the original casimir geometry with perfectly plane and parallel mirrors aligned along the directions @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "the two mirrors thus form a fabry - perot cavity of length @xmath2 as shown in fig.[fig1b ] .",
    "we analyze the cavity as a composed optical network , and calculate the fluctuations of the intracavity fields propagating along the positive and negative @xmath20-axis , @xmath21 and @xmath22 , in terms of the fluctuations of the incoming free - space fields @xmath23 and @xmath24 ( the outgoing fields @xmath25 and @xmath26 are also shown ) .",
    ".,width=264 ]    the field modes are conveniently characterized by their frequency @xmath27 , transverse wavevector @xmath28 with components @xmath29 in the plane of the mirrors and polarization @xmath30 . as the configuration of fig.[fig1b ] obeys a symmetry with respect to time translation as well as transverse space translations ( along directions @xmath18 and @xmath19 ) , the frequency @xmath31 , transverse vector @xmath32 and polarization @xmath33 are preserved throughout the whole scattering processes on a mirror or a cavity .",
    "the scattering couples only the free vacuum modes which have the same values for the preserved quantum numbers and differ by the sign of the longitudinal component @xmath34 of the wavevector .",
    "we denote by @xmath35\\right)_j$ ] the reflection amplitude of the mirror @xmath36 as seen from the inner side of the cavity .",
    "this scattering amplitude obeys general properties of causality , unitarity and high frequency transparency .",
    "the additional fluctuations accompanying losses inside the mirrors are deduced from the optical theorem applied to the scattering process which couples the modes of interest and the noise modes @xcite .",
    "the loop functions which characterize the optical response of the cavity to an input field play an important role in the following @xmath37 & = & \\frac{\\rho_\\bk^p\\left[\\omega\\right]}{1-\\rho_\\bk^p\\left[\\omega\\right]}\\nonumber\\\\ \\rho_\\bk^p\\left[\\omega\\right ] & = & \\left(r_\\bk^p\\left[\\omega\\right]\\right)_1 \\left(r_\\bk^p\\left[\\omega\\right]\\right)_2 e^{2ik_z l}\\label{rho}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath38 and @xmath39 are respectively the open - loop and closed - loop functions corresponding to one round trip in the cavity .",
    "the system formed by the mirrors and fields is stable so that @xmath39 is an analytic function of frequency @xmath27 .",
    "analyticity is defined with the following physical conditions in the complex plane @xmath40 \\quad,\\quad & & \\kappa\\left[\\omega\\right ] \\equiv\\sqrt{\\bk^2-\\frac{\\omega^2}{c^2 } } \\quad,\\quad\\re\\kappa\\left[\\omega\\right ] > 0 \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the quantum numbers @xmath30 and @xmath28 remain spectator throughout the discussion of analyticity .",

    "this contribution thus merely reflects the intuitive picture of a radiation pressure of fluctuations on the mirrors of the cavity @xcite with the factor @xmath52 representing a difference between inner and outer sides .",
    "equations ( [ forcereal],[ereal ] ) also include the contribution of evanescent waves with @xmath53 and @xmath51 imaginary .",
    "those waves propagate inside the mirrors with an incidence angle larger than the limit angle and they also exert a radiation pressure on the mirrors , due to the frustrated reflection phenomenon @xcite . their properties are conveniently described through an analytical continuation of those of ordinary waves , using the well defined analytic behavior of @xmath54 and @xmath39 .",
    "using analyticity properties , we now transform ( [ forcereal ] ) into an integral over imaginary frequencies by applying the cauchy theorem on the contour enclosing the quadrant @xmath55 .",
    "we use high frequency transparency to neglect the contribution of large frequencies .",
    "this leads to the following expression for the casimir force @xmath56 f_\\bk^p \\left[i\\xi\\right ] + c.c .",

    "it is thus clear that both expressions for force and energy are equivalent .",
    "let us now review the correction to the casimir force coming from the finite conductivity of any material .",
    "this correction is given by relations ( [ forcereal ] ) or , equivalently , ( [ forceimag ] ) , as soon as the reflection amplitudes are known .",
    "these amplitudes are commonly deduced from models of mirrors , in particular bulk mirrors , slabs or layered mirrors , the optical response of metallic matter being described by some permittivity function .",
    "this function may be either a simple description of conduction electrons in terms of a plasma or drude model or a more elaborate representation based upon tabulated optical data . at the end of the section",
    ", we will discuss the uncertainty in the theoretical evaluation of the casimir force coming from the lack of knowledge of the specific material properties of a given mirror as was illustrated in @xcite .",
    "assuming that the metal plates have a large optical thickness , the reflection coefficients correspond to the ones of a simple vacuum - bulk interface @xcite @xmath61 @xmath62 stands for @xmath63 and @xmath64 is the dielectric function of the metal evaluated for imaginary frequencies ; the index @xmath28 has been dropped .",
    "taken together , the relations ( [ forceimag],[rthick ] ) reproduce the lifshitz expression for the casimir force @xcite . note that the expression was not written in this manner by lifshitz . to our present knowledge , kats @xcite was the first to stress that lifshitz expression could be written in terms of the reflection amplitudes ( [ rthick ] ) .",
    "we then have to emphasize that ( [ forceimag ] ) is much more general than lifshitz expression since it still holds with mirrors characterized by reflection amplitudes differing from ( [ rthick ] ) . as an illustration",
    ", we may consider metallic slabs having a finite thickness .",
    "for a given polarization , we denote by @xmath65 the reflection coefficient ( [ rthick ] ) corresponding to a single vacuum / metal interface and we write the reflection amplitude @xmath66 for the slab of finite thickness through a fabry - prot formula @xmath67 this expression has been written directly for imaginary frequencies .",
    "the parameter @xmath68 represents the optical length in the metallic slab and @xmath69 the physical thickness . the single interface expression ( [ rthick ] )",
    "is recovered in the limit of a large optical thickness @xmath70 . with the plasma model",
    ", this condition just means that the thickness @xmath69 is larger than the plasma wavelength @xmath71 .    in order to discuss experiments , it may also be worth to write the reflection coefficients for multilayer mirrors .",
    "for example one may consider two - layer mirrors with a layer of thickness @xmath69 of a metal @xmath3 deposited on a large slab of metal @xmath72 in the limit of large thickness as shown in figure [ multi ] .",
    "composition of networks  : two networks labeled a and b are piled up to build up a network ab.,width=113 ]    the reflection formulas are then obtained as in @xcite but accounting for oblique incidence @xmath73 it reproduces the known results for the simple multilayer systems which have already been studied @xcite .",
    "the combination of ( [ rslab ] ) and ( [ composlab ] ) allows to calculate most of the experimental situations precisely .    in order to assess quantitatively the effect of finite conductivity , we may in a first approach use the plasma model for the metallic dielectric function , with @xmath74 the plasma frequency ,",
    "@xmath75 it is convenient to present the change in the casimir force in terms of a factor @xmath76 which measures the reduction of the force with respect to the case of perfect mirrors @xmath77 using expressions ( [ rthick],[epsplasma ] ) it is possible to obtain the reduction factor defined for the casimir force through numerical integrations .",
    "the result is plotted as the solid line on figure [ fig - plasma ] , as a function of the dimensionless parameter @xmath78 , that is the ratio between the distance @xmath2 and the plasma wavelength @xmath71 .",
    "as expected the casimir formula is reproduced at large distances ( @xmath79 when @xmath80 ) . at distances smaller than @xmath71 in contrast ,",
    "a significant reduction is obtained with the asymptotic law of variation read as @xcite @xmath81 this can be understood as the result of the coulomb interaction of surface plasmons at the two vacuum / metal interfaces @xcite .",
    "the generalization of this idea at arbitrary distances is more subtle since it involves a full electromagnetic treatment of the plasmon as well as ordinary photon modes @xcite .",
    "equal to @xmath82 .",
    "the difference due to the relaxation parameter has only a small effect on the calculation of the casimir force .",
    "the dotted - dashed line corresponds to the short distance asymptotic behavior ( [ etashortf]).,width=264 ]    the plasma model can not provide a fully satisfactory description of the optical response of metals , in particular because it does not account for any dissipative mechanism .",
    "a more realistic representation is the drude model @xcite @xmath83 this model describes not only the plasma response of conduction electrons with @xmath84 still interpreted as the plasma frequency but also their relaxation , @xmath85 being the inverse of the electronic relaxation time .",
    "the relaxation parameter @xmath85 is much smaller than the plasma frequency .",
    "for al , au , cu in particular , the ratio @xmath86 is of the order of @xmath87 .",
    "hence relaxation affects the dielectric constant in a significant manner only at frequencies where the latter is much larger than unity . in this region ,",
    "the metallic mirrors behave as a nearly perfect reflectors so that , finally , the relaxation does not have a large influence on the casimir effect at zero temperature .",
    "this qualitative discussion is confirmed by the result of numerical integration reported as the dashed line on figure [ fig - plasma ] . with the typical value already given for @xmath88 ,",
    "the variation of @xmath76 remains everywhere smaller than 2% .    for metals like al , au , cu ,",
    "the dielectric constant departs from the drude model when interband transitions are reached , that is when the photon energy reaches a few ev .",
    "hence , a more precise description of the dielectric constant should be used for evaluating the casimir force in the sub-@xmath89 m range .",
    "this description relies on one hand on the causality relations obeyed by the dielectric response function and on another hand on known optical data .",
    "the reader is referred to @xcite for a detailed analysis , but we recall here the main argument and some important details .",
    "let us first recall that frequencies are measured either in @xmath90v or in rad / s , using the equivalence 1  ev @xmath91  rad / s .",
    "an erroneous conversion factor 1  ev @xmath92  rad / s was used in @xcite , which led to a difference in @xmath93 of less than 1% over the relevant distance range . in the end of the calculation , this was corresponding to a negligible error in the casimir force and energy @xcite .",
    "the values of the complex index of refraction for different metals , measured through different optical techniques , are tabulated as a function of frequency in several handbooks @xcite .",
    "optical data may vary from one reference to another , not only because of experimental uncertainties but also because of the dispersion of material properties of the analyzed samples .",
    "moreover , the available data do not cover a broad enough frequency range so that they have to be extrapolated .",
    "these problems may cause variations of the results obtained for the dielectric function @xmath64 and , therefore , for the casimir force .",
    "ev and @xmath94  mev ) , the dashed line to the second set ( optical data given by @xcite , low frequencies extrapolated by a drude model with @xmath95  ev and @xmath96  me v).,width=264 ]    figure [ fig - eiwcu ] shows two different plots of @xmath64 for cu as a function of imaginary frequency @xmath97 .",
    "the solid line corresponds to the first data set with data points taken from @xcite and extrapolation at low frequency with a drude model with parameters @xmath98  ev and @xmath94  mev in reasonable agreement with existing knowledge from solid state physics .",
    "however , as explained in @xcite , the optical data available for cu do not permit an unambiguous estimation of the two parameters @xmath10 and @xmath99 separately .",
    "other couples of values can be chosen which are also consistent with optical data . to make this point explicit ,",
    "we have drawn a second plot on figure [ fig - eiwcu ] ( dashed line ) with data taken from @xcite and the low frequency interpolation given by a drude model with @xmath95  ev and @xmath96  mev .",
    "these values lead to a dielectric function @xmath93 smaller than in the first data set over the whole frequency range , but especially at low frequencies .",
    "an estimation of the uncertainties associated with this imperfect knowledge of optical data can be drawn from the computation of the casimir force in these two cases .",
    "for the casimir force between two cu plates as a function of the plate separation @xmath2 .",
    "the solid line corresponds to the first set ( optical data given by @xcite , low frequencies extrapolated by a drude model with @xmath98  ev and @xmath94  mev ) , the dashed line to the second set ( optical data given by @xcite , low frequencies extrapolated by a drude model with @xmath95  ev and @xmath96  m@xmath90v).,width=264 ]    figure [ fig - etacu ] shows the reduction factor @xmath100 for the casimir force between two cu plates as a function of the plate separation @xmath2 for the two sets of optical data .",
    "the two corresponding curves have similar dependance on the plate separation but the absolute values are shifted from one curve to the other . at a separation of 100 nm the difference can be as large as 5% . as the plasma frequency is basically the frequency above which the mirrors reflectivity diminishes considerably , the drude parameters of the first set ( @xmath101 ev and @xmath102 mev ) give a larger casimir force than the second set , where the plasma frequency is lower ( @xmath103 ev and @xmath104 mev ) .",
    "a detailed analysis of this uncertainty has been recently reported @xcite .",
    "let us emphasize that the problem here is neither due to a lack of precision of the calculations nor to inaccuracies in experiments .",
    "the problem is that calculations and experiments may consider physical systems with different optical properties .",
    "material properties of mirrors indeed vary considerably as a function of external parameters and preparation procedure @xcite .",
    "this difficulty could be solved by measuring the reflection amplitudes of the mirrors used in the experiment and then inserting these informations in the formula giving the predicted casimir force . in order to suppress the uncertainty associated with the extrapolation procedure",
    ", it would be necessary to measure the reflection amplitudes down to frequencies of the order of 1 mev , if the aim is to calculate the casimir force in the distance range from 100 nm to a few @xmath89 m .",
    "the casimir force between dissipative metallic mirrors at non zero temperature has given rise to contradictory claims which have raised doubts about the theoretical expression of the force . in order to contribute to the resolution of this difficulty",
    ", we now review briefly the derivation of the force from basic principles of the quantum theory of lossy optical cavities at non zero temperature .",
    "we obtain an expression which is valid for arbitrary mirrors , including dissipative ones , characterized by frequency dependent reflection amplitudes .",
    "this expressions coincides with the usual lifshitz expression when the plasma model is used to describe the mirrors material properties , but it differs when the drude model is applied .",
    "the difference can be traced back to the validity of poisson summation formula @xcite .    to discuss the effect of finite temperature we use a theorem which gives the commutators of the intracavity fields as the product of those well known for fields outside the cavity by the airy function .",
    "this theorem was demonstrated with an increasing range of validity in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it is true regardless of whether the mirrors are lossy or not .",
    "since it does not depend on the state of the field , it can be used for thermal as well as vacuum fluctuations .",
    "assuming thermal equilibrium , the theorem leads to the expression of the field anticommutators , _",
    "i.e. _ the field fluctuations .",
    "note that thermal equilibrium has to be assumed for the whole system , which means that input fields as well as fluctuations associated with electrons , phonons and any loss mechanism inside the mirrors correspond to the same temperature @xmath105 , whatever their microscopic origin may be .",
    "if parts of the system correspond to different temperatures , completely different results are obtained @xcite .",
    "the anticommutators of intracavity fields are given by those known for fields outside the cavity multiplied by the airy function .",
    "hence , the expression written in @xcite for a null temperature is only modified through the appearance of a thermal factor in the integrand @xmath106 f_\\bk^p\\left[\\omega\\right ] c\\left[\\omega\\right ] + c.c . \\right\\ } \\nonumber \\\\ & & c\\left[\\omega\\right ] \\equiv \\coth\\left ( \\frac{\\pi\\omega}{\\omega_\\t } \\right ) \\quad,\\quad \\omega_\\t \\equiv \\frac{2\\pi k_\\b t}{\\hbar }   \\label{forcerealt}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    using as before analyticity properties , we transform ( [ forcerealt ] ) into an integral over imaginary frequencies giving the following expression for the casimir force @xmath107 f_\\bk^p \\left[i\\xi+\\eta\\right ] c\\left[i\\xi+\\eta\\right ] + c.c . \\right\\ } & & \\label{forceimagt}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is now written as an integral over complex frequencies @xmath108 close to the imaginary axis , with the small positive real number @xmath109 maintaining the matsubara poles @xmath110 of @xmath111 $ ] outside the contour used to apply the cauchy theorem . up to this point , the present derivation is similar to lifshitz demonstration @xcite while being valid for arbitrary reflection amplitudes . the next steps in lifshitz derivation , scrutinized in @xcite ,",
    "may raise difficulties for dissipative mirrors .",
    "let us briefly recall the main arguments of @xcite .",
    "we may first write a series expansion of the casimir force ( [ forcerealt ] ) based upon the expansion of the function @xmath112 into a series of exponentials @xmath113 ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "this expansion obeys the mathematical criterion of uniform convergence so that , when it is inserted in ( [ forcerealt ] ) , the order of the summation over @xmath114 and integration over @xmath97 may be exchanged .",
    "it follows that the force ( [ forcerealt ] ) may also be read as @xmath115 \\nonumber\\\\ \\phi_\\bk^p \\left[\\xi\\right ] & \\equiv & \\lim_{\\eta\\to 0^+ } \\kappa_\\bk\\left[i\\xi+\\eta\\right ] f_\\bk^p \\left[i\\xi+\\eta\\right ] \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we have introduced the common summation convention @xmath116 the function @xmath117 is well defined almost everywhere , the only possible exception being the point @xmath118 where the limit @xmath109 may be ill defined for mirrors described by dissipative optical models @xcite . since this is a domain of null measure , the cosine fourier transform @xmath119 of @xmath117 is well defined everywhere and the expression ( [ forceimagexp ] ) of the casimir force is valid for arbitrary mirrors , including dissipative ones .",
    "note that the term @xmath120 in ( [ forceimagexp ] ) corresponds exactly to the contribution of vacuum fluctuations , or to the zero temperature limit , while the terms @xmath121 give the corrections associated with thermal fields .",
    "we come back to the derivation of the lifshitz formula @xcite , often used as the standard expression of the casimir force .",
    "this formula is directly related to the decomposition of the @xmath122 function into elementary fractions corresponding to the matsubara poles @xmath123 .",
    "if we assume furthermore that the function @xmath117 is a sufficiently smooth test function , in the sense defined by the theory of distributions , we deduce that the expression ( [ forceimagt ] ) can also be read @xmath124 \\label{lifshitzform}\\ ] ] this is the generalization of the lifshitz formula @xcite to the case of arbitrary reflection amplitudes .",
    "it is a discrete sum over matsubara poles with the primed summation symbol having the definition ( [ sumconv ] ) .",
    "this formula is known to lead to the correct result in the case of dielectric mirrors ( for which it was derived in @xcite ) , for perfect mirrors @xcite and also for metallic mirrors described by the lossless plasma model @xcite .",
    "however its applicability to arbitrary mirrors remains a matter of controversy @xcite .",
    "the point is that the derivation of the lifshitz formula ( [ lifshitzform ] ) requires that the function @xmath117 be a sufficiently smooth test function , in the sense defined by the theory of distributions .",
    "whether or not this is the case at @xmath118 for @xmath117 calculated from dissipative optical models constitutes the central question of the controversy on the value of the term @xmath30=te , @xmath125 in lifshitz sum @xcite .",
    "let us repeat that ( [ forceimagexp ] ) is still a mathematically valid expression of the casimir force even when @xmath117 is ill defined for @xmath97 in a domain of null measure .",
    "the question of validity of lifshitz formula ( [ lifshitzform ] ) may also be phrased in terms of applicability of the poisson summation formula @xcite .",
    "this applicability depends on a smoothness condition which is met for dielectric mirrors , for perfect mirrors and for mirrors described by the plasma model and this explains why lifshitz formula ( [ lifshitzform ] ) may be used as well as ( [ forceimagexp ] ) in these cases @xcite .    in order to solve this controversy ,",
    "it is crucial to improve our knowledge of the reflection amplitudes at low frequencies . as already discussed , the best manner to do that is to measure these amplitudes on the mirrors used in the experiment at frequencies as low as possible .",
    "although the theoretical question of a good modeling of mirrors at low frequencies is certainly of interest and needs to be answered , the crucial point for a reliable theory - experiment comparison is the necessity of assessing the real behavior of the mirrors used in the experiments .",
    "we will now present a more general formalism to calculate the casimir force and energy which takes into account non - specular reflection by the plates .",
    "non - specular reflection is of course the generic reflection process on any mirror while specular reflection is an idealization .    in order to introduce the more general formula ,",
    "let us first rewrite expression ( [ eim ] ) of the casimir energy between two flat plates as a sum over modes labeled by the @xmath97 and @xmath126 @xmath127 \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\delta_\\bk^p \\left [ i\\xi \\right ] = \\ln\\left ( 1-r_{1}r_{2}e^{-2\\kappa l}\\right ) \\label{esp}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this can be interpreted as the energy stored inside the cavity during the scattering process .",

    "these phase shifts are deduced from the @xmath129-matrix of the cavity @xcite in such a manner that the casimir energy is simply equal to the logarithm of the determinant of the @xmath130matrix . using the techniques of quantum field theory @xcite , this can also be written as the trace of matrix , here diagonal , defined on these modes @xmath131 here , @xmath132 and @xmath133 are diagonal matrices which contain as their diagonal elements the specular reflection amplitudes , as they are seen from fields inside the cavity , @xmath134 while @xmath54 is a matrix diagonal over the same modes @xmath135    it is now easy to write down a more general formula of the casimir energy for the case of stationary but non - specular scattering @xmath136 the two matrices @xmath137 and @xmath138 are no longer diagonal on plane waves since they describe non specular reflection on the two mirrors .",
    "the propagation factors remain diagonal on plane waves .",
    "note that the matrices appearing in ( [ enonspec ] ) no longer commute with each other . as a consequence , the two propagation matrices in ( [ enonspec ] ) can be moved through circular permutations in the product but not adjoined to each other .",
    "formula ( [ enonspec ] ) has already been used to evaluate the effect of roughness @xcite or corrugation @xcite of the mirrors on the casimir force .",
    "to this aim , it was expanded at second order in the profiles of the mirrors , with the optical response of the bulk metals described by the plasma model .",
    "the non specular reflection amplitudes were then deduced from techniques developed for treating rough plates @xcite .",
    "the condition of validity of this expansion is that the roughness or corrugation amplitude is the smallest of length scales involved in the problem . in this regime , it was possible to investigate various domains for the roughness or corrugation wavelength and thus to investigate the effect of roughness or corrugation outside as well as inside the range of validity of the proximity force approximation .",
    "we may again emphasize at this point that the formula ( [ enonspec ] ) has a wider range of validity than used in those applications .",
    "it can in principle describe mirrors with nanostructured surfaces corresponding to large amplitudes which can not be treated as a small perturbation .",
    "it can as well deal with more complicated optical responses which are described neither by a plasma nor by a drude model . as was extensively discussed above for the case of specular reflection ,",
    "the formula ( [ enonspec ] ) remains valid for arbitrary mirrors , the only problem being to obtain the precise form of the reflection matrices to be inserted into it .",
    "let us now recall how the non - specular scattering formula ( [ enonspec ] ) can be used to calculate the effect of roughness on the casimir force .",
    "taking this effect into account simultaneously with that of finite conductivity is essential , because both of them are important at short distances . in order to analyze the roughness effect between two metallic plates",
    ", we will describe the optical properties of the mirrors by the plasma model .",
    "the values for the plasma wavelength , the mirror separation and the roughness correlation length will be arbitrary with respect to each other , the roughness amplitude remaining the smallest length scale for perturbation theory to hold .",
    "we will review some simple analytical expressions for several limiting cases , as well as numerical results allowing one for a reliable calculation of the roughness correction in real experiments @xcite .    in a plane - plane geometry ,",

    "these functions are defined so that they have zero averages .",
    "we consider the case of stochastic roughness characterized by spectra @xmath141 we suppose the surface @xmath3 of the plates to contain many correlation areas , which allows us to take ensemble or surface averages interchangeably .",
    "the two plates are considered to be made of the same metal and the crossed correlation between their profiles is neglected ( @xmath142 ) .",

    "the dependance of @xmath150 on @xmath151 reflects that not only the roughness amplitude but also its spectrum plays a role in diffraction on rough surfaces  @xcite . the formula ( [ main ] ) has been obtained for the energy in the plane - plane configuration but it also determines the force correction @xmath152 in the plane - sphere configuration since the pfa is still used for describing the weak curvature of the sphere ( see below ) .",
    "we now focus our attention on the validity of pfa for treating the effect of roughness and notice that this validity only holds at the limit of smooth surface profiles @xmath153 .",
    "in fact , the following identity is obeyed by our result @xcite , for arbitrary values of @xmath2 and @xmath154 , @xmath155 where the derivative is taken with respect to the plate separation @xmath2 . if we now suppose that the roughness spectrum @xmath156 is included inside the pfa sector where @xmath157 , @xmath150 may be replaced by @xmath158 and factored out of the integral ( [ main ] ) thus leading to the pfa expression  @xcite @xmath159 in this pfa limit , the correction depends only on the variance @xmath160 of the roughness profiles , that is also the integral of the roughness spectrum .    in the general case in contrast , the sensitivity to roughness depends on the wavevector @xmath151 .",

    "pfa is indeed recovered at the limit of very smooth surface profiles and the deviation from pfa given by our results as soon as the roughness wavevector goes out of this limit .",
    "the mirrors used in a given experiment have a specific roughness spectrum which can , and in our opinion must be , measured when the experiments are performed .",
    "the integral ( [ main ] ) then leads to a reliable prediction for the roughness correction , as soon as the spectral sensitivity @xmath187 and the real spectrum @xmath156 are inserted into it .",

    "a more stringent test can be performed by studying the lateral component of the casimir force which arises between corrugated surfaces .",
    "this lateral casimir force would indeed vanish in the absence of surface corrugation so that the expression of the spectral sensitivity will thus appear directly as a factor in front of the lateral casimir force . for reasons which will become clear below",

    "nice experiments have shown the lateral casimir force to be measurable at separations of a few hundred nanometers  @xcite , that is of the same order of magnitude as the plasma wavelength @xmath154 .",
    "it follows that these experiments can neither be analyzed by assuming the mirrors to be perfect reflectors  @xcite , nor by using the opposite limit of plasmon interaction  @xcite .",
    "it is no more possible to use the pfa if we want to be able to treat arbitrary values of the ratio of the corrugation wavelength @xmath189 to the interplate distance @xmath2 .",
