    "estimation of coverage error in census operation is an important statistical and demographical issue .",
    "federal agencies are generally interested to know the actual size of a specified population or any vital event occurring in a specified area within a given time span .",
    "census or any vital events registration system often fails to extract the actual size . as a remedy , one or more information is collected on that population independently , near to the census operation , and the population size ( say , _",
    "n _ ) is estimated by matching the available lists of information . in the context of human population",
    ", this kind of data structure by matching information is known as multiple - record system , which is equivalent to the capture - recapture system in biological or epidemiological studies ( _ see _ otis et al . , 1978@xcite and seber , 1986@xcite ) .",
    "now a days this technique is increasingly employed to correct for under ascertainment in traditional epidemiological surveillance ( chao et al .",
    ", 1996@xcite , 2001@xcite ) .",
    "in dual - record system ( or shortly , drs ) , two samples ( @xmath1 ) and in triple - record system ( trs ) , three samples ( @xmath2 ) of information are used to estimate the _ n_. undercount estimation in census ( wolter , 1986@xcite ; cressie , 1989@xcite ; wang et al . , 2006@xcite ) ,",

    "the most simple and widely practiced model is @xmath3 , which accounts for only time ( _ t _ ) variation effect , was first invoked in modern times by chandrasekar et al .",
    "( 1949@xcite ) on human population .",
    "there are various frequentist and likelihood approaches for this basic model in the literature of animal population size estimation ( _ see _ , huggins ( 1989@xcite ) ) and epidemiology from capture - recapture experiment ( _ see _ , hook ( 1995@xcite ) and chao et al .",
    "( 2001@xcite ) ) .",
    "bayesian approach was pioneered by robert ( 1967@xcite ) , castledine ( 1981@xcite ) and smith ( 1988@xcite ) , primarily for @xmath3 .",
    "george and robert ( 1992@xcite ) first gave an extensive account on the population size estimation through hierarchical bayesian analysis on model @xmath3 .",
    "but this common dse model doesn@xmath4 t work well because of the violation of the underlying assumption of independence between the capture probabilities in different samples . brittain and b@xmath5hning ( 2009@xcite ) efficiently reviewed various methods available by relaxing the independence assumption and associated comparative study undertaken in the drs context .",
    "for a homogeneous population , the capture probabilities might become correlated due to list dependence and it occurs for the time ordered samples when capture probability at the time of second survey depends on whether he / she is captured in first time .",
    "this behavioral dependency is driven by a parameter @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) , called _ behavioral response effect_. when behavior response ( _ b _ ) effect acts together with the time variation ( _ t _ ) effect on the capture probability in second list , then we would have a more complicated model @xmath0 .",
    "this model has a strong relevance in practice for a group of homogeneous individuals when the sample lists are not thought to be independent .",

    "( 2006 ) and farcomeni and tardella ( 2012 ) worked on identifiability issues for heterogeneous population .",
    "however , in this article , we confine ourselves to a homogeneous population .",
    "lloyd ( 1994@xcite ) used a martingle approach to solve the problem using an assumption in case the number of capturing ( @xmath8 ) is strictly more than two .",
    "quasi - likelihood method by chao et al .",
    "( 2000@xcite ) and univariate markovian approach proposed by yang and chao ( 2005@xcite ) also successfully solve the nonidentifiability for @xmath9 and provide significant improvement over the classical solutions - unconditional and conditional mle obtained from the popular assumption of lloyd ( 1994@xcite ) .",
    "in bayesian paradigm , lee and chen ( 1998@xcite ) applied the gibbs sampling idea to the model @xmath0 but they did not use recapture data and estimates were unstable and prior sensitive .",
    "lee et al .",
    "( 2003@xcite ) considered the model with an informative uniform prior on @xmath6 and came up with a fully bayesian solution using adaptive acceptance - rejection sampling . to discover a reasonable range for @xmath6",
    ", they require large number of samples ( i.e. @xmath10 ) likely for animal population size estimation but unlikely for human . in a drs framework ,",
    "nour ( 1982@xcite ) proposed an estimator assuming the directional knowledge of recapture proneness ( _ i.e. _ @xmath11 ) in human demographic studies .",
    "another possibility is that recapture aversion ( _ i.e. _ @xmath12 ) might take place in some situations , e.g. drug abused population size estimation .",
    "the goal of this article is to investigate the potential of an approximate bayesian methodology for homogeneous human population size ( @xmath13 ) estimation as an alternative or supplement to the very few existing approaches when behavioral effect plays a key role along with time variation . in this article",
    "we confine ourselves only to drs , as three or more sources of data is seldom used for human population . in the next section ,",
    "first we present the data structure in drs and discuss the model @xmath0 .",
    "it is clear from the nature of the present model that without the help of informative prior , it is not possible to have a reasonably good bayesian solution .",
    "hence , we design approximate bayesian strategy using vague prior based on available directional knowledge on @xmath6 . by understanding a need to develop an approach when no such directional knowledge on @xmath6 is available ,",
    "another bayesian strategy is proposed using a subjective choice of conjugate prior . in both situations , priors specifications using the available domain knowledge ,",
    "preserve some characteristics of the system and use minimal subjectivity so that efficient solutions could be obtained simply .",
    "both the strategies are presented along with extensive numerical illustration over several simulated populations in section [ sub : first methodology_combo ] and [ sub : second methodology_combo ] .",
    "the full bayes strategy is also presented without consideration of the directional knowledge as developed in lee et al .",
    "( 2003@xcite ) .",
    "section [ sec : real data ] examines a real drs data on death records as an illustrative example . finally in the last section , we summarize our findings and provide the best possible estimation rule depending upon the availability ( or non - availability ) of the directional knowledge on @xmath6 .",
    "the idea of dual collection is equivalent to the very popular capture - recapture sampling in wildlife management to estimate the population size , @xmath13 .",
    "laplace ( 1786 ) pioneered this kind of sampling to estimate the population size of france from vital events like births , marriages and deaths .",
    "let us consider a human population _",
    "u _ of size _ n_. census usually fails to count this @xmath13 exactly and therefore , it can be considered as a sample ( though a very large one for human population ) . to know the true _",
    "n _ , another independent attempt is organized . then combining these two sources of information , estimate of _ n _",
    "could be obtained assuming different conditions on the capture probabilities of both the lists leading to different models . in this article",
    "we will concentrate on the situation which has two basic assumptions - ( _ i _ ) population is closed upto the time of second sample taken , ( _ ii _ ) individuals are homogeneous with respect to their capture probabilities .",
    "let , @xmath14 and @xmath15 denote the capture probabilities of _",
    "_ j__th individual in first sample ( list 1 ) and second sample ( list 2 ) respectively .",
    "hence , homogeneity assumption in ( _ ii _ ) ensures that @xmath16 in list 1 and @xmath17 in list 2 for _ _ j__=1 , 2 , @xmath18 , _ n_. some countries use their regular survey as the second source , e.g. us census bureau uses the current population survey(cps ) to estimate the true population .",
    "the individuals captured in first list ( i.e. census ) are matched one - by - one with the list of individuals made from second survey ( often called post enumeration survey or pes ) .",
    "hence the data structure classified according to a multinomial fashion as in table @xmath19 is popularly known as dual - record system or shortly , drs .",

    "nour ( 1982 @xcite ) estimated these death sizes as _ 378 _ and _ 3046 _ for _ lilongwe _ and _ other urban areas _ respectively assuming the fact that two data sources are positively correlated ( i.e. @xmath11 ) in a human demographic study . to implement our both methods ,",

    "in the present article , we have presented two approximate bayesian approaches under a general framework for dual - record system ( drs ) where behaviour response effect might play a significant role along with time variation effect . here",
    "we suggest efficient approximate bayesian computation strategies conditionally and unconditionally on the directional knowledge available on @xmath6 .",
    "the first one is formulated with uniform prior whereas the second one depends on subjective conjugate prior based on structural relationships among the underlying parameters .",
    "some features of the first approach with uniform prior on behaviour effect ( @xmath6 ) are : noninformative prior for _ n _ and @xmath41 is used and a reasonable range for @xmath6 is always available with or without the help of the available directional information on @xmath6 . when @xmath42 , specification of the lower bound of @xmath6 by @xmath25 works successfully .",

    "moreover , the upper limit @xmath30 is not at all influential if the nature of @xmath6 is correctly known .",
    "it is found that estimates from poisson prior with @xmath29 are less efficient than jeffrey s .",
    "hence , we conclude that the first approximate bayes approach ( discussed in section [ sub : first methodology ] ) performs very well based on the information on the possible range of underlying @xmath6 , when available . in practice",
    ", experts can usually judge whether the specified population is either recapture prone ( i.e. @xmath43 ) or averse ( i.e. @xmath42 ) from past studies .",
    "if so , our strategy with noninformative prior on @xmath6 has significant improvement over nour ( 1982 @xcite ) in terms of efficiency .",
    "an alternative bayes approach ( discussed in section [ sub : second methodology ] ) with informative generalised beta prior is also proposed when there is no reliable information available on @xmath6 .",
    "some features of this approximate empirical type bayes approach are the following : for @xmath42 , map - based estimates are very efficient ( compared to other loss functions ) when the capture probabilities are high . in contrast , the other two estimates , @xmath46 and @xmath47 , with jeffrey s prior or @xmath48 pois(@xmath27 ) perform relatively better than @xmath49 for @xmath43 .",
    "when directional information is not available , @xmath49 obtained from @xmath48 p(@xmath29 ) would be a unique choice among the two approaches .",
    "it is also found that the second approach improves the performance than that of first approach for known information of @xmath43 . for recapture averse population ( @xmath42 ) ,",
    "the first approach is little better because of its relatively tighter prior domain .",
    "hence , our proposed methods can be used to have a better and easily computable estimate of population size from this complex dual system .",
    "apart from the computational advantage , these methods are transparent and relatively easy to explain to the practitioner . though our methods incorporate subjective elements through the choice of priors , as necessary , but this subjectiveness helps the underlying model to successfully get rid of the identifiability problem .",
