    "low surface brightness galaxies ( lsbgs ) are important populations in galaxy field .",
    "however , their contributions to galaxy population have been underestimated for a long time since they are hard to find owing to their faintness compared with the night sky .",
    "an initial quantitative study was made by freeman ( 1970 ) , who noticed that the central surface brightness of their 28 out of 36 disc galaxies fell within a rather narrow range , @xmath0(b)=21.65@xmath20.3 mag arcsec@xmath1 .",
    "this could be caused by selection effects ( disney 1976 ) .",
    "since then , many efforts have been made to search for large number of lsbgs from surveys ( bothun & impey 1997 ; impey & bothun 1997 ; zhong et al .",
    "2008 and references therein ) .",
    "one of the important ones is the apm survey , i.e. , impey et al .",
    "adopted the automated plate measuring ( apm ) mechanism to scan uk schmidt plates and discovered 693 lsbgs which forms the most extensive catalog of lsbgs to that date ( impey et al .",
    "oneil et al .",
    "( 1997 , in  texas survey \" ) firstly found the red lsbg populations .",
    "monnier ragaigne et al .",
    "( 2003 ) selected a sample of about 3800 lsbgs from the all - sky near - infrared 2mass survey , and then made hi observations for a sub - sample .",
    "the modern digital sky survey , such as the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , certainly provide a wonderful chance for us to find much more lsbgs .",
    "kniazev et al .",
    "( 2004 ) developed a method to search for lsbgs from sdss images and used the apm sample to test their method .",
    "they recover 87 same objects and 42 new lsbgs .",
    "recently , our group ( zhong et al .",
    "2008 ) successfully select a large sample of lsbgs from sdss - dr4 main galaxy sample , which includes 12,282 nearly face - on disk galaxies with low surface brightness @xmath0(b)@xmath3 22 mag arcsec@xmath1 , and another 18,051 high surface brightness galaxies ( hsbgs ) with @xmath0(b)@xmath422 mag arcsec@xmath1 are also selected for comparisons .",
    "this will be a very efficient sample to study the properties of lsbgs , and to check the variation of these properties with surface brightnesses if there exists .",
    "we have studied some properties of this large sample .",
    "zhong et al .",
    "( 2008 ) presented the sample selection criteria , and their magnitudes , surface brightness , scalelengths and colors etc .",
    "the metallicities ( liang et al .",
    "2009 , in preparation ) and stellar populations ( chen et al .",
    "2009 , in preparation ) are also studied from optical spectra , i.e. the emission lines , continua and absorption lines .",
    "in addition , the modern digital sky surveys have been made in wide wavelength ranges , such as galex - uv , sdss - optical , 2mass - nir , iras - ir etc .",
    "these allow us to construct the multi - wavelength seds for our sample galaxies ( gao et al .",
    "2009 , in preparation ) , which are very useful and efficient to study their star formation history . in this paper",
    ", we summarize the interesting results we obtained for this large sample of galaxies , which will be presented in detail in the series work mentioned above .",
    "especially , we try to check the varying trends of their properties following surface brightness . a cosmological model with @xmath5 = 70 km s@xmath6 mpc@xmath6 , @xmath7 = 0.3 and @xmath8 = 0.7 is adopted in this paper .",
    "we select 30,333 nearly face - on disk galaxies from the sdss - dr4 main galaxy sample .",
    "they have been estimated the reliable surface brightness values and minimize the effect of dust extinction inside the galaxies .",
    "the selection criteria are given below .    1 .",
    "@xmath12 @xmath4 0.25 ( @xmath12 indicates the fraction of luminosity contributed by the de vaucouleurs profile relative to exponential profile in the @xmath13-band , and this low value for limit can also minimize the effect of bulge light on the disk galaxies ) ; 2 .",
    "@xmath14 @xmath15 0.75 ( for nearly face - on galaxies , where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the semi - major and semi - minor axes of the fitted exponential disk respectively ) ; 3 .",
    "@xmath9 @xmath4 -18 ( this excludes the few ( 6% ) dwarf galaxies contained in the sample ) .    taking @xmath0(b)=22 mag arcsec@xmath1 as criterion , 12,282 objects are confirmed as lsbgs and other 18,051 objects are confirmed as hsbgs .",
    "the properties of this large sample of lsbgs have been studied carefully by zhong et al .",
    "specially , these lsbgs show clear correlations between @xmath9 and log@xmath10 , and between log@xmath11 and log@xmath10 , which mean that the brighter galaxies tend to have larger scalelengths and the galaxies with larger scalelengths have the benefit to be detected and observed in the more distant universe .",
    "furthermore , both of the lsbgs and hsbgs can be divided into two sub - groups following @xmath0(b ) , which will allow us to study their properties in a sequence of surface brightness .",
    "the criteria for @xmath18 ( in mag arcsec@xmath1 ) are following mcgaugh ( 1996 ) : slsbgs ( 2,815 ) with 22.75 - 24.5 , isbgs ( 9,467 ) with 22.0 - 22.75 , shsbgs ( 10,989 ) with 21.25 - 22.0 , vhsbgs ( 7,062 ) with @xmath421.25 .",
    "fig.1a shows the relations of @xmath9 vs. log@xmath10 for the samples in these four sub - groups .",
    "fig.1b shows that for log@xmath11 vs. log@xmath10 .",
    "all the four sub - groups show clear correlations . however ,",
    "the comparisons among these four show that , at a given disk scalelength , the galaxies having higher @xmath0(b ) are brighter , and could be observed at a farther distance",
    ". there are gradually varying trends following surface brightnesses of the galaxies .",
    "metallicity is an important parameter of galaxy and a good tracer for their evolution history .",
    "the metallicities of this large sample of nearly face - on disk galaxies can be estimated from optical emission lines . to select the target galaxies with good quality spectroscopic observations , we adopt the criteria below ( following liang et al .",
    "2006 and tremonti et al .",
    "2004 ) .    1",
    ".   cross correlating between our sample and the sdss - dr4 spectroscopic database .",
    "the fluxes of the emission lines of the galaxies have been measured for [ o  ii ] , h@xmath19 , [ o  iii ] , h@xmath20 , [ n",
    "ii ] , and the line h@xmath19 , h@xmath20 , and [ n  ii]6584 are detected with s / n ratios greater than 5@xmath21 .",
    "then the selected sample in the four sub - groups are 1,364 in slsbgs , 6,055 in isbgs , 9,107 in shsbgs are 6,231 in vhsbgs .",
    "3 .   selecting the star - forming galaxies by using the diagnostic diagram of [ n  ii]/h@xmath20 vs. [ o  iii]/h@xmath19 following kauffmann et al .",
    "( 2003a ) .",
    "now we obtain 1,299 of slsbgs , 5,551 of isbgs , 8,310 of shsbgs , and 5,872 of vhsbgs .",
    "this also means that the agn fractions of these sub - groups are quite small .",
    "the 12+log(o / h ) abundances of these star - forming galaxies are taken from the mpa/ jhu database ( tremonti et al .",
    "the median values in the four sub - groups are 8.77 for slsbgs , 8.94 for isbgs , 9.03 for shsbgs , and 9.06 for vhsbgs .",
    "this means that the galaxies have lower surface brightness generally have lower metallicity .",
    "fig.2a shows the relations of 12+log(o / h ) vs. @xmath18 of the star - forming galaxies in the four sub - groups .",
    "the median values in each of the bins of 0.2 in @xmath18 are also given ( the big squares ) , as well as the three vertical long - dashed lines at @xmath18=21.25 , 22.0 and 22.75 to mark the ranges of @xmath18 for the four sub - groups .",
    "a general varying trend shows that , for the slsbgs , isbgs and shsbgs , the galaxies with lower surface brightness have lower metallicity .",
    "we further obtain the stellar masses of these sample galaxies from the mpa / jhu database ( kauffmann et al .",

    "the results show that the importance of young populations increases from slsbgs to isbgs , shsbgs , and to vhsbgs ( more details in chen et al .",

    "finally we obtain about 280 lsbgs and 300 hsbgs with reliable observations from uv to ir . if without considering ir , there are about 2100 lsbgs and 7300 hsbgs having multiwavelength observations from uv to nir",
    ". these will be good samples to study the multiwavelength seds and stellar formation history of galaxies .",
    "one of the useful model to analyze their seds is grasil ( silva et al . 1998 ) .",
    "this model could produce the multiwavelength seds of galaxies , such as m51 ( nearly face - on disk ) , m82 ( starburst ) and ngc 6090 ( strongly interacting galaxy ) etc .",
    "our sample could be compared with these seds and hopefully they will be similar to those of m51 and/or m82 .    in summary , we have selected a large sample of lsbgs from sdss , which could provide interesting and important results for understanding the properties of this kind of galaxies .",
    "also it must be very useful to better understand their contribution to the local galaxy population .",
    "their effects on the number density , light density and light functions of galaxies in the local universe will be further studied ."
