    "note that @xmath851 and @xmath852 are both subsets of cliques in the weakly separated collection @xmath853 .",
    "it almost contradicts proposition  [ prop : embed ] for these two segments to cross .",
    "the only subtlety is that @xmath851 and @xmath852 might be contained in the same clique of @xmath853 , with @xmath854 occurring in that circular order around the corresponding face of @xmath855 .",
    "but then the triangle @xmath856 is contained in @xmath386 , and lies on the @xmath832-side of @xmath665 , contradicting that @xmath665 is supposed to be on the boundary of @xmath832 .",
    "so , @xmath386 is a disc , whose two faces are naturally colored black and white .",
    "let @xmath45 be the dual graph , so the faces of @xmath45 are labeled by @xmath14 , and the boundary faces by @xmath29 .",
    "there are @xmath18 vertices on the boundary of @xmath45 , labeled by @xmath2 $ ] , with vertex @xmath61 between faces @xmath91 and @xmath87 .",
    "we now show that @xmath45 is reduced .",
    "be warned that , at this point , we do not know that the labels of the faces of @xmath45 inherited from @xmath386 are the labels @xmath301 .",
    "let @xmath583 be a strand which separates @xmath672 and @xmath700 , for some @xmath652 , and then goes on to separate @xmath672 from some @xmath685 .",
    "as we travel along @xmath583 , the faces on the left are of the form @xmath857 for some sequence @xmath858 , with @xmath859 , and the faces on the right are of the form @xmath860 .",
    "we have @xmath861 due to the definition of cliques in plabic tilings .",
    "therefore , @xmath583 can not loop or cross itself ; it must travel from the boundary of @xmath840 to the boundary of @xmath840 .",
    "in particular , we see that there are only @xmath18 strands in total , one ending between each pair of boundary faces of @xmath45 .",
    "the strand @xmath583 must start separating @xmath862 from @xmath863 , and end separating @xmath864 from @xmath865 .",
    "that is because these are the only pairs of adjacent faces at the boundary of @xmath45 which differ by an @xmath59 .",
    "thus , the strand we have called @xmath583 is the strand labeled by @xmath59 in our standard way of labeling the strands of a plabic graph .",
    "now fix two strands @xmath291 and @xmath292 which intersect at least twice , labeled @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "we want to show that the intersections occur in reverse order along @xmath291 and @xmath292 . at one crossing , let the strands separate faces @xmath866 and @xmath867 ; at the other crossing let the adjacent faces be @xmath868 and @xmath869 . from the fact that @xmath870 and @xmath871 , we get that one of the following holds :    * @xmath872 and @xmath873 or * @xmath874 and @xmath875 .",
    "assuming the first case holds , we get @xmath876 and @xmath877 .",
    "so the intersections occur in opposite order along @xmath291 and @xmath292 .",
    "we also conclude that the intersections occur in opposite order in the second case .",
    "we have now checked that strands do not cross themselves , do not form closed loops , and that the intersections along any pair of strands occur in opposite order along the two strands .",
    "so @xmath45 is reduced .",
    "finally , we must check that the labels coming from @xmath386 are the same as the labels @xmath301 . in this paragraph , when we refer to the label of a face of @xmath45 , we mean the label @xmath0 of the dual vertex of @xmath386 .",
    "consider a strand @xmath583 , with label @xmath59 .",
    "we must check that the faces to the left of @xmath583 all contain @xmath59 , and those to the right do not .",
    "the faces immediately to the left of @xmath583 all contain @xmath59 , and those immediately to the right do not .",
    "let @xmath878 be the union of all faces that contain @xmath59 , so @xmath583 is part of the boundary of @xmath878 , as is part of @xmath879 .",
    "we claim that , in fact , this is the entire boundary of @xmath878 .",
    "if there were any other edge @xmath357 in the boundary of @xmath878 , since @xmath45 is a disc with boundary @xmath879 , there would have to be a face on the other side of @xmath357 from @xmath878 , and the label of this face would not contain @xmath59 .",
    "but then one of the strands passing through this edge would be @xmath583 .",
    "similarly , the boundary of @xmath880 is also made up of @xmath583 and a piece of @xmath879 .",
    "it is now topologically clear that @xmath878 is the part of @xmath840 on one side of @xmath583 , as desired .",
    "so starting from a maximal weakly separated collection @xmath14 for @xmath30 , we have obtained a reduced plabic graph @xmath45 with @xmath383 .",
    "this completes the proof of theorem  [ thm : wsisfgpos ] . .",
    "we have now proved theorem  [ thm : wsisfgpos ] . by theorem  [ thm : p ] , we now know that every maximal weakly separated collection of @xmath107 has cardinality @xmath881 and any two maximal weakly separated collections of @xmath30 are mutation equivalent .",
    "this is theorem  [ thm : gsconjecture ] and our work is complete .",
    "before we end , we state a simple result that follows from theorem  [ thm : wsisfgpos ] .",
    "[ cor : wsalign ] let @xmath29 be a grassmann necklace , @xmath169 the associated decorated permutation , and @xmath30 the associated positroid .",
    "we define @xmath882 to be the union of @xmath354 for all reduced plabic graphs @xmath45 of @xmath30 .",
    "then @xmath199 is in @xmath882 if and only if it obeys the following condition : for any alignment @xmath158 in @xmath31 , if @xmath883 then we have @xmath884 .",
    "one direction is obvious : for any @xmath368 for some plabic graph @xmath45 of @xmath30 , it should meet the condition due to the way the faces are labeled in plabic graphs .",
    "so we only need to check the other direction .",
    "pick any @xmath199 that satisfy the condition .",
    "assume for the sake of contradiction that @xmath1 is not weakly separated with some @xmath91 .",
    "this means that there is some @xmath885 and @xmath886 such that @xmath887 is circularly ordered .",
    "the condition @xmath888 tells us that @xmath889 , while the condition @xmath890 tells us that @xmath891 .",
    "so @xmath892 are circularly ordered and @xmath893 forms an alignment of @xmath31 .",
    "then @xmath1 should contain both @xmath17 and @xmath372 due to the condition , but this contradicts @xmath894 .",
    "so @xmath1 is weakly separated from all @xmath91 s , and @xmath895 is a weakly separated collection",
    ". then theorem  [ thm : wsisfgpos ] tells us that there is some @xmath354 that contains @xmath1 .",
    "in this section , we state leclerc and zelevinsky s conjectures on @xmath35-chamber sets and explain how they follow from theorem  [ thm : gsconjecture ] .    given two sets of integers , @xmath0 and @xmath1",
    ", we write @xmath896 if @xmath755 for all @xmath897 and all @xmath884",
    ". we will write @xmath898 for @xmath899 with respect to the shifted order @xmath99 on @xmath2 $ ]",
    ". the following definition will only be necessary in this section ; it is an extension of the definition of weak separation to sets of unequal cardinality .",
    "let @xmath35 be a permutation in the symmetric group @xmath351 .",
    "the @xmath35-chamber set , @xmath913 , is defined to be the collection of those subsets @xmath0 of @xmath914 $ ] that satisfy the following condition : for every pair @xmath915 with @xmath916 , if @xmath917 then @xmath918 .",
    "the attentive reader will notice that our definition of a @xmath35-chamber set differs from that in  @xcite by switching the directions of all inequalities .",
    "thus , the @xmath35-chamber set in our notation is the image of leclerc and zelevinsky s @xmath919-chamber set under the map @xmath920 .",
    "this flip has to be included somewhere , due to an incompatibility in the sign conventions of  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "a weakly separated collection @xmath14 of @xmath913 is a collection of subsets in @xmath913 such that the elements of @xmath14 are pairwise weakly separated ( in the lz sense ) .",
    "a maximal weakly separated collection of @xmath913 is a weakly separated collection of @xmath913 that is maximal under inclusion .",
    "let @xmath931 and @xmath932 . the padding allows us to reduce weak separation in the sense of leclerc and zelevinsky to the notion of weak separation of elements in @xmath23}{k}$ ] which we use in the rest of the paper . specifically , we have :      if @xmath19 then @xmath935 if and only if @xmath936 if and only if @xmath934",
    "otherwise , we may assume that @xmath937",
    ". then @xmath938 .",

    "so @xmath925 is weakly separated from @xmath940 if and only if there is no element of @xmath8 which lies between two elements of @xmath4 in the standard linear order on @xmath914 $ ] .",
    "this precisely means that we can partition @xmath8 as @xmath941 so that @xmath942 .",
