    "one of the key questions in theoretical cosmology is whether the space - time metric near the singularity is regular or chaotic .",
    "as was shown by belinskii , khalatnikov and lifshitz ( bkl ) , the generic solution of the four - dimensional vacuum einstein equations exhibits an oscillating behavior @xcite which was later qualified as essentially chaotic ( see @xcite and references therein ) . recently",
    "the issue of chaos in the early universe received a renewed attention due to discovery that the antisymmetric form fields in ten and eleven - dimensional supergravities imply chaos @xcite .",
    "namely , it was shown that the general solution near a space - like singularity of the einstein - dilaton - p - form field equations exhibits an oscillatory behavior of the bkl type .",
    "however the issue of chaos in superstring cosmology is not completely solved yet , since these considerations are based on the lowest in @xmath0 level of the string theory . to go beyond this approximation in the closed string theories",
    "is difficult , since no exact in @xmath0 effective action is known .",
    "moreover , the quadratic curvature corrections obtained perturbatively are likely to disfavor chaos @xcite .",
    "recently damping of the bkl oscillations was observed also within the brane - world scenario @xcite .",
    "the role of non - perturbative string corrections is easier to study within the open string context ( or d - branes ) where an exact in @xmath0 effective action is known in the slow varying field approximation under the form of the born - infeld ( bi ) action @xcite .",
    "a non - abelian generalization of the born - infeld action was suggested in ref .",
    "consequently , one can explore whether the yang - mills ( ym ) chaos extensively studied for homogeneous fields in flat space - time and in bianchi i cosmology persists when the usual ym action is replaced by the non - abelian born - infeld action ( nbi ) .",
    "this would probe the effect of the string non - locality on the issue of chaos .",
    "classical ym fields governed by the ordinary quadratic action exhibit chaotic behavior in various situations @xcite .",
    "the simplest case is that of the homogeneous ym fields depending only on time in the flat space - time @xcite : when only two ym components are excited , the problem is reduced to the well - known two - dimensional hyperbolic system @xmath1 which is chaotic .",
    "furthermore , in the lattice simulations of the inhomogeneous ym system , one observes the energy flow from the infrared to the ultraviolet region @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is believed that the chaotic behavior is typical for the purely classical ym equations , one of the arguments being the absence of solitons in this theory .",
    "in addition , it is known that adding the higgs field to the ym theory leads to stabilization of chaos in the homogeneous systems . in this case",
    "the hyperbolic model is replaced by the system of coupled harmonic oscillators which is regular in the weak coupling regime .    in the context of ym fields in the presence of gravity , it is of interest to pint the following .",
    "the ym field has violent oscillating behavior near the singularity of the einstein - yang - mills ( eym ) black holes @xcite , but the oscillations are not chaotic . in the domain of cosmology ,",
    "some homogeneous models , such as an axisymmetric bianchi i , the ym chaos unambiguously persists @xcite , though in principle gravity leads to a smoothing of the chaotic behavior .",
    "on the other hand , the born - infeld effect on the flat - space dynamics of the homogeneous axisymmetric ym field was shown to provide a chaos - order transition @xcite , so it can be expected that in the gravity coupled case this effect will be even more pronounced .",
    "note that in the related investigation of the behavior of the ym field inside black holes @xcite , it was found that violent ym oscillations disappear once the quadratic ym action is replaced by the nbi action .    in this paper",
    ", we study in detail the axisymmetric bianchi i cosmology with the ym field governed by the nbi action . though the system becomes much more complicated when the ordinary ym lagrangian is replaced by the non - abelian born - infeld ( nbi ) lagrangian",
    ", we show that the equations can be considerably simplified in some physically interesting limiting cases , and even admit some exact solutions .",
    "the generic solution exhibits a transition from the ym chaos to the regular oscillating regime when moving backward in time .",
    "as was discussed recently @xcite , the definition of the nbi action is ambiguous",
    ". one can start with the u(1 ) bi action presented either in the determinant form @xmath2 or in the equivalent ( in four space - time dimensions ) `` square root '' form @xmath3 in the non - abelian case of the matrix - valued @xmath4 , the trace over gauge matrices must be specified .",
    "one particular definition is due to tseytlin  @xcite .",
    "a symmetrized trace was therein introduced , prescribing a symmetrization of all products of @xmath4 in the power expansion of the determinant ( [ det ] ) before the trace is taken . inside the symmetrized series expansion",
    "the gauge generators effectively commute , so both the determinant ( [ det ] ) and the square root ( [ sqrt ] ) forms are equivalent .",
    "this property does not hold for other trace prescriptions , e.g. , an ordinary trace . in the latter case it is common to apply the trace to the square root form ( [ sqrt ] ) .",
    "note that string theory seems to require the symmetrized trace definition in the lower orders of the perturbation theory @xcite , while higher order corrections seem to violate this prescription @xcite .",
    "here we choose the `` square root / ordinary trace '' lagrangian just for its simplicity .",
    "it is worth noting that in the static case discussed recently both in the ordinary  @xcite and the symmetrized trace  @xcite versions , qualitative features of solutions turn out to be the same .",
    "thus we choose the action of the einstein - nbi system in the following form @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the scalar curvature , @xmath7 is the bi critical field strength and @xmath8 the limit @xmath9 corresponds to the standard eym theory with the action @xmath10    we consider an axially symmetric bianchi i space - time described by the line element @xmath11 where functions @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 depend on time @xmath15 . in the ym case",

    "the einstein equations can be derived by variation of the one - dimensional action over @xmath26 .",

    "the energy density is given by @xmath33 the pressure in the plane orthogonal to the symmetry axis is @xmath34 and the pressure along the axis of the symmetry is @xmath35",
    "the above system of equations look as a dynamical system of the eight - order in the presence of a constraint .",
    "however , it possesses additional scaling symmetries which can be used to reduce the system order by two ( for the eym action this possibility was noticed by darian and kunzle @xcite ) .",
    "it is easy to check that under a scaling transformation @xmath36 the lagrangian remains invariant .",
    "moreover , under a separate rescaling in the @xmath37 sector @xmath38 the lagrangian scales as @xmath39 , and under the transformation @xmath40 as @xmath41 .",
    "the corresponding reduction of the eym system is achieved by an introduction of new variables invariant under the above rescalings . following barrow and levin @xcite",

    "in the ym limit @xmath63 the square - root factor in the above formulas should be replaced according to the relation @xmath64 the main qualitative difference between eym and enbi theories lies in the fact that the standard ym action is scale - invariant ( though not the eym one ) contrary to the nbi case .",

    "( [ tb ] ) , ( [ bc ] ) we obtain @xmath107 this is a pancake singularity .",
    "thus , the bi non - linearity modifies the singularity from a pancake to a cigar type .",
    "consider now the general solution near the cosmological singularity .",
    "it turns out that except for a special isotropic solution @xmath108 , previously studied in @xcite , generic solutions have the same metric singularities as the vacuum bianchi i solutions . near the pancake singularity",
    "the solution is not analytic in terms of @xmath15 , but in terms of @xmath109 .",
    "in fact , one finds the following laurent expansion containing four free parameters @xmath110 : @xmath111 the @xmath112-component of the ym field vanishes at @xmath113 , while @xmath114 is singular .",
    "the scale factor @xmath115 and the shear @xmath116 near the pancake singularity both behave as @xmath117 .    near the cigar singularity",
    "the solution has a laurent expansion in terms of @xmath15 : @xmath118 where the quantity @xmath119 is the leading term in an expansion of the nbi square root : @xmath120 the scale factor and the shear have the following expansions : @xmath121    the quantities @xmath122 , @xmath123 , @xmath124 , @xmath125 ( @xmath126 , @xmath127 , @xmath128 , @xmath129 ) are independent free parameters which , together with an arbitrariness associated with a time shift , provide five constants needed to specify the generic solution for both singularity types .",
    "in order to better understand the effect of the bi nonlinearities on the gauge field dynamics let us first study the strong field limit @xmath131 , or , formally , @xmath132 . the leading term in the square root ( [ sqrtdef ] ) containing",
    "the pseudoscalar invariant @xmath53 is negative definite .",
    "therefore , imposing the square root @xmath54 to be real - valued in the limit @xmath132 may be ensured only if @xmath53 tends to zero , in which case @xmath133 one can show that this condition is compatible indeed with the equations of motion as @xmath132 .",
    "given the condition ( [ cons1 ] ) , the square root term will read @xmath134 the right hand sides of the einstein equations ( [ 1e ] ) , ( [ 2e ] ) tend to zero , so the gravitational degrees of freedom decouple @xmath135 and the gravitational constraint assumes the vacuum form as well @xmath136    decoupling of gravity means that in the limit @xmath132 the metric is given by the vacuum kasner solution either of a cigar type @xmath137 or a pancake type @xmath138 where we set the singularity at @xmath113 .",
    "substituting the explicit expressions for the hubble and shear parameters one finds another constraint @xmath139 and thus in the remaining equations one can express all the gauge field variables either in terms of @xmath140 , or in terms of @xmath141 .",
    "one simple consequence of this constraint is that in the non - trivial case @xmath142 the variables @xmath143 and @xmath144 can not have zeroes except for the singularity , and thus should preserve their signs . from the nbi field equations",
    "one then finds @xmath145 in both cases the dynamical equation for @xmath114 will be of the form @xmath146 with some function @xmath147 .",
    "it describes oscillations with a decreasing amplitude .",
    "the second ym variable @xmath112 is related to @xmath114 algebraically via constraints ( [ cons1 ] ) , ( [ cons2 ] ) and therefore oscillates with the same frequency exactly in an antiphase .",
    "oscillations are fully regular , so no ym chaos can persist in the regime of the strong bi non - linearity .",

    "the solution can be expanded in terms of @xmath15 : @xmath152",
    "now we address the problem numerically .",
    "various methods were suggested to study a chaotic behavior in the context of gravity , where the absence of the canonical time variable prevents a straightforward use of such convenient tools as the lyapunov exponents ( however , see @xcite ) . in the case of the conformally invariant ym lagrangian , one can use the approach of ref .",
    "@xcite to separate the dynamics of the ym field from the gravitational expansion and then apply the invariant technique of chaotic scattering . for systems exhibiting chaotic behavior",
    "the set of all periodic orbits has fractal structure invariant under coordinate reparameterizations .",
    "however these methods become problematic in our case , where the conformal invariance is absent from the matter action .",
    "apart from the special asymptotic regimes , it is not possible to separate the ym dynamics from the metric evolution .",
    "though it can be done for the high ym intensity , it turns out that the time interval in the actual evolution where this regime holds is rather small for @xmath7 of the order of unity or greater .",
    "the ym variables perform only a small number of oscillations during the epoch of high field intensity , the field then being fast diluted .",
    "however , if we set the parameter @xmath7 sufficiently small , the time spent by the system in the highly nonlinear region will be large enough , and in this case the chaos - order transition is unambiguously manifest .",
    "a numerical analysis of the system for small values of @xmath7 reveals the following .",
    "while the gauge field strength is considerably greater then the critical field @xmath7 , both conditions ( [ cons1 ] ) and ( [ cons2 ] ) approximately hold , and the dynamics of the gauge field qualitatively coincides with that discussed in the previous section for @xmath130 . both variables @xmath143 and @xmath144 perform nonlinear oscillations with decreasing amplitude in an antiphase with respect to each other and without crossing zero . in this region",
    "the dynamics is fully regular , while the evolution of the metric is mainly governed by purely vacuum terms and is close to the vacuum kasner solution .    to test the validity of an approximate description of the system in terms of the limiting @xmath130 solution we check the constraint equations ( [ cons1],[cons2 ] ) in the case of small but finite @xmath7 .",
    "the first constraint is the condition of smallness of the pseudoscalar ym invariant @xmath153 .",
    "the second constraint was directly checked numerically .",
    "[ fig : constraint ] illustrates the situation for the cigar solution with @xmath154 . from this figure",
    "one can see that the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ cons2 ] ) evolves on time scales much larger than the period of oscillations of the gauge field variables . under the overall volume expansion ,",
    "the ym energy density falls down and the role of the bi nonlinearity decreases . at the same time",
    "the matter terms in the einstein equation become more significant forcing , in particular , to decrease the shear anisotropy @xmath155 much faster than the hubble parameter @xmath156 .",
    "these features are illustrated in figs .",

    "[ fig : cha ] demonstrates the same solution at late time .",
    "one can see that the dynamics of the gauge field becomes essentially chaotic .",
    "the function @xmath155 coupled to matter performs chaotic oscillations with decreasing ( as compared to the hubble parameter @xmath156 ) amplitude .",
    "the first zeroes of the gauge functions @xmath143 and @xmath144 serve as an approximate boundary separating highly nonlinear evolution from the region of the chaotic regime .",
    "the actual type of singularity ( pancake or cigar ) , plays a relatively small role in both the regular and strongly chaotic phases except for the small vicinity of the singularity .",

    "[ fig : hubble ] for various @xmath7 .",
    "this function interpolates between the value @xmath163 at @xmath113 ( vacuum kasner solution ) and the value @xmath164 at @xmath165 corresponding to the isotropic `` hot universe '' cosmology .",
    "however , for small values of @xmath7 , when the system stays in a highly nonlinear regime for a considerable time interval , there is a region where @xmath162 is greater than @xmath164 .",
    "this feature can be explained using the results of the frw - bi model and was firstly presented in ref .",
    "@xcite ( subsequent analysis can be found in ref . @xcite . )",

    "the latter corresponds to the value @xmath168 , which is , however , never achieved in the anisotropic case which we investigate here .",
    "the main goal of this paper was to test the non - perturbative effects of superstring theory on the issue of chaos in cosmology .",
    "at least three different patterns of chaotic behavior in cosmology were identified .",
    "the first is the billiard - type behavior which is manifest in the bianchi ix pure gravity and its supergravity ( including multidimensional cases ) generalizations .",
    "the second is the bouncing behavior of the frw - scalar field cosmology .",
    "the third type is the matter - dominated chaos of the bianchi i eym cosmology , and it is this type of chaos which was investigated here ( recently an interesting analysis was performed @xcite of the ym field behavior in more general type a bianchi space - times showing that basic features of the ym chaos persist there as well ) . from these three patterns",
    "the last one is the most appropriate for testing the superstring non - locality effects accumulated in the bi non - abelian action .",
    "our results clearly demonstrate disappearance of chaos in the high energy regime .    from a mathematical viewpoint ,",
    "it is worth noting that the einstein - nbi system of equations admits a reduction of order due to the presence of scaling symmetries similarly to the eym case .",
    "moreover , in the strong bi regime the axisymmetric bianchi i nbi system can be reduced further due to existence of two additional asymptotic integrals of motion .",
    "this limit is characterized by the dynamical vanishing of the pseudoscalar quadratic invariant of the ym field .",
    "this simplifies dynamics considerably and leads to a decoupling of the gravitational degrees of freedom .",
    "color oscillations are still governed by the bi non - linearity and are reducible to the one - variable second order system predicting perfectly regular behavior .",
    "numerical experiments shows that the system behavior for sufficiently small @xmath7 consists of a regular phase in the high energy region near the singularity and the chaotic phase at later time .",
    "the regular phase is qualitatively similar to that described by the @xmath130 approximate description .",
    "the chaos - order transition is observed when one is moving backward in time towards the singularity .",
    "the singularity itself is either of a cigar or a pancake type , as in the vacuum bianchi i case , though the ym field does not tend to the vacuum configuration .",
    "thus the non - perturbative in @xmath0 string corrections to the ym action suppress the ym chaos which takes place at lower energies where dynamics of the ym field is governed by the ordinary quadratic action .    in the case of only an abelian component",
    "excited , an exact analytic solution of the einstein - bi system was found which generalizes the rosen solution to the einstein - maxwell equations .",
