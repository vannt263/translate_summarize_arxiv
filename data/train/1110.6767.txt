    "it is generally believed that the picture of space - time as a differentiable manifold should break down at very short distances of the order of the planck length .",
    "there are different proposals for the modified space - time structure which should provide a consistent framework encompassing physics in this regime .",
    "these proposals include , among others , the dynamical triangulation as a way of direct geometrical construction of modified space - time , strings and loops as non - local fundamental observables dynamically generating space - time , and a deformation of algebra of functions on a manifold as a way of introducing a noncommutative space - time.    introducing a non - trivial algebra of coordinates in order to modify the space - time structure can be seen as an attempt to generalise the concept of symmetries that should encompass physics on a quantum manifold . a possible way to describe physics on such a manifold is to construct ( effective ) field theory compatible with the algebra of coordinates in the framework of deformation quantization .",
    "the main advantage of such effective models is that one can extract phenomenological consequences of the space - time modification using standard field - theoretical tools .    in this work",
    "our primary interest is to examine the compatibility of the local gauge principle with the deformation of the algebra of functions on a specific example of noncommutative space - time , the @xmath0-minkowski space - time .",

    "it is a dimensionful deformation of the global poincar group , the @xmath0-poincar group .",
    "the constant @xmath0 has dimension of energy and sets a deformation scale .",
    "the @xmath0-minkowski space also provides an arena for formulating new physical concepts .",
    "these include the generalisation of special relativity with one additional invariant scale known as doubly special relativity @xcite , and the concept of relativity of locality @xcite , a proposal in which space - time is observer - dependent projection from the invariant phase space .",
    "this makes the @xmath0-minkowski space - time an example of noncommutative space - time with potentially interesting phenomenology .",
    "we are interested in the construction of the field theory on this space as a step towards extracting observable consequences of underlying noncommutative structure . in our previous work @xcite",
    "we showed that within the framework defined in @xcite one can consistently describe a gauge theory on the @xmath0-minkowski space - time by explicit construction of @xmath1 gauge theory coupled to fermions .",
    "although successful , the construction revealed certain ambiguities which were fixed by physical arguments and intuition , rather then by the formalism itself . with this motivation in mind , we use the twist formalism in order to gain a better understanding of the gauge theory on the @xmath0-minkowski space - time @xcite .",
    "note , however , that in this formalism we can not maintain the @xmath0-poincar symmetry ; the corresponding symmetry of the twisted @xmath0-minkowski space is the twisted @xmath3 symmetry .",
    "one of the advantages of the twist formalism is the straightforward way to define a differential calculus .",
    "this enables us to write the action in a geometric way , as an integral of a maximal form .",
    "furthermore , the geometric description we use clearly shows that one can not decouple translations and gauge symmetries , a generic feature for theories with underlying noncommutative structure . in our model",
    "this mixing of internal and space - time symmetries enters in the construction of the ( hodge ) dual field strength .",
    "we present two different ways of defining the dual field strength leading to the same expanded action in the first order in deformation parameter .",

    "however , the commutation rule of the basis one - forms with functions reproduces the effect of `` higher order differential operator '' gauge field without producing unwanted terms in the action .    we have shown that the twisting of symmetries , as a way of deforming the algebra of coordinates , is compatible with the local gauge principle .",
    "the obstruction we have encountered in the construction of the hodge - dual field - strength tensor is a manifestation of the fact that the introduction of a noncommutative geometrical structure prevents decoupling of translation and gauge symmetries .",
    "we proposed two different possibilities for construction of the dual field strength , both leading to the same effective action in the first order of the deformation parameter .",
    "although the mixing of space - time and internal symmetries appeared as a problem in our construction , this is in fact one of the most intriguing property of models based on non - trivial algebras of coordinates .",
    "one possible way to understand this mixing was offered in the framework of yang - mills type matrix models @xcite .",
    "there it was shown that @xmath1 part of general @xmath205 gauge group can be interpreted as induced gravity coupling to the rest ( @xmath206 ) gauge degrees of freedom .",
