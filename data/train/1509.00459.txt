    "<S> the availability of big data on human activity is currently changing the way we look at our surroundings . with the high penetration of mobile phones </S>",
    "<S> , nearly everyone is already carrying a high - precision sensor providing an opportunity to monitor and analyze the dynamics of human movement on unprecedented scales . in this article , we present a technique and visualization tool which uses aggregated activity measures of mobile networks to gain information about human activity shaping the structure of the cities . </S>",
    "<S> based on ten months of mobile network data , activity patterns can be compared through time and space to unravel the `` city s pulse '' as seen through the specific signatures of different locations . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the tool allows classifying the neighborhoods into functional clusters based on the timeline of human activity , providing valuable insights on the actual land use patterns within the city . </S>",
    "<S> this way , the approach and the tool provide new ways of looking at the city structure from historical perspective and potentially also in real - time based on dynamic up - to - date records of human behavior . </S>",

    "<S> one of the central questions for city planners is to know the function of different neighborhoods , which is crucial for understanding their needs . </S>",
    "<S> traditionally , cities maintain a database of land - use classification , which is based on official records . </S>",
    "<S> while such data is generally of very high resolution , its nature limits the ability to follow changes dynamically . </S>",
    "<S> but today s challenges come together with new solutions to them : the use of anonymized mobile phone data enables dynamic measurement of human activity and sensing the unique signatures of each neighborhood of a city based on that . exploiting these new possibilities , recent years saw increasing usage of mobile phone data for better understanding people s presence around the city  @xcite , human mobility  @xcite , structure of the city  @xcite and many other applications , including regional delineation  @xcite .         </S>",
    "<S> the presented tool  @xcite , developed in collaboration between mit senseable city laboratory and ericsson , allows the comparative analysis of city structure with the use of aggregated mobile network activity data in four global cities : new york , london , hong kong and los angeles . </S>",
    "<S> further research insights coming from such analysis are presented in  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the tool uses aggregated data collected between april 2013 and january 2014 in the four cities provided by mobile network operators with representative market shares . </S>",
    "<S> the data includes measurements of human phone activity aggregated on the level of mobile antennas within 15-minute time intervals . </S>",
    "<S> these include the number of calls placed and text messages sent , the amount of data downloaded and uploaded , and the number of data requests ( number of individual times data transfer was initiated ) for each antenna in each 15-minute time window . </S>",
    "<S> this way , the aggregated data does not include any sensitive customer information , but provides enough detail about the typical usage patterns on the scale of small neighborhoods . </S>",
    "<S> we proceed by further spatial aggregation so as to account for the variation of antenna - level activity volumes due to technical constraints of cellular network operation . for most of the analysis , </S>",
    "<S> we normalize the resulting time series of different locations ; we expect that the most information can be gained from comparing the shape of time series , i.e.  how activity is distributed over a day or week . </S>",
    "<S> looking at the spatial distribution of activity volumes is possible in a separate usage mode in the tool .        </S>",
    "<S> possible usage of the data is demonstrated via three possible usage modes in the online tool  @xcite : time series , spatial clusters and density maps . </S>",
    "<S> the first , time series mode facilitates the exploration of human activity measures on the level of city districts ; possible usage is illustrated in figs .  1 , 2 and  3 . </S>",
    "<S> in this mode , one can look at individual time series throughout the measurement period making possible to identify long - term trends and special events , and weekly averages enabling the comparison of typical activity patterns in different neighborhoods or in different cities . </S>",
    "<S> notable features in long - term time series include the steady increase in data traffic , the distinct effect of holidays , and specific signatures of some important events like the wimbledon tennis championship or football matches in london . </S>",
    "<S> looking at typical week time series , patterns representative of cities business centers and residential areas can be easily identified . apart from looking at the long - term time series of activity and weekly averages , it is also possible to inspect the residual activity , i.e.  difference of activity on a specific week from the average . </S>",
    "<S> special events can also be noticed by peaks in these time series as illustrated by the example of wembley stadium in fig .  1 .        </S>",
    "<S> the second , spatial clusters mode of the online tool allows the interactive exploration of results on decomposing the cities into functional clusters based on the mobile network activity time series . </S>",
    "<S> this analysis was performed on the typical week time series of network activity aggregated into a regular grid . each of the functional clusters </S>",
    "<S> can then be represented with a cluster - wide average time series and a map displaying the grid pixels which belong to it . as an example </S>",
    "<S> , the functional clusters of new york city are displayed in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 4 . </S>",
    "<S> looking at the average cluster time series , we can classify them as e.g. core business , where activity is especially high in normal working hours and low otherwise ; residential , where the peak of daily activities is in the evenings ; leisure and parks , where activity has noticeable peaks in weekends during the day . </S>",
    "<S> it is also possible to compare clusters from different cities . </S>",
    "<S> for example , in fig .  4 , we show comparison of clusters identified as core business and residential in new york and hong kong . </S>",
    "<S> it is remarkable that the activity signatures of the two business clusters seem much more similar than the signatures of the two residential clusters . </S>",
    "<S> a more detailed analysis of results of clustering , including in - depth discussion of the interpretation of the clusters , comparison of results with traditional , census - based data , and a systematic analysis of differences among the four cities is presented in our related scientific publication  @xcite .         </S>",
    "<S> the third mode of the online tool presents the spatial distribution of activity volumes in the cities . </S>",
    "<S> it also allows inspecting the ratio of volumes of different activity types , giving an overview of which type of activity is preferred in different parts of the cities . </S>",
    "<S> an example is displayed in fig .  5 , showing the spatial distribution of call volumes in hong kong .        </S>",
    "<S> we believe the presented tool to be a valuable supplement for urban planning decision support as well as for providing important insights on the way people use the city for researchers , urban stakeholders and general public . </S>"
