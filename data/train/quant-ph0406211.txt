    "most of quantum - octave functions can be applied to density operators , which are represented by normalise matrices .",
    "package offers also functions for operations on pure states .",
    "base ket vectors and their linear combinations are easily constructed and transformed into corresponding density operators using state function , and it is easy to obtain mixtures of states using mixstates function .",
    "computation process is performed using evolve(gate , state ) function , where gate is unitary operation .",
    "lowlevel functions binvec2dec and dec2binvec allow for convenient use of register notation @xmath0 .",
    "they are implemented in c++ using liboctave are they are used for manipulations of registers in ptrace and ptranspose functions . for example",

    "cc +    [ fig : main ]    the idea was to observe how quantum state , obtained by performing quantum algorithm on non - pure state , differs from state obtained in ideal ( pure state ) case . on each step of simulation",
    "initial state @xmath25 was prepared as mixture of pure state @xmath26 and maximally mixed state @xmath27 @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 is @xmath31-dimensional identity matrix . for each state",
    "obtained in such way the trivial and shor s circuits were applied and for each obtained outcome two distances and two fidelity measures were calculated .",
    "results of those simulations are presented in fig .  1 .",
    "shor s algorithm is performed on 7 qubits , but only the first 3 qubits are taken into account during calculations of fidelity and distance measures because the last 4 qubits decohere and normally are nt measured .",
    "fidelity between density matrices , as given in ref .",
    "[ equ : fid ] is proper measure which shows how much two mixed states differ.@xcite to compare different methods of calculating distance between states we have chosen three functions ( eqs .",
