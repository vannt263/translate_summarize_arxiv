    "the study of dilute granular materials  @xcite , as well as of other many particles systems lacking an equilibrium description ( glass forming liquids in their non - equilibrium regime  @xcite , for instance ) , requires the use of appropriate tools , models and paradigms in order to simplify the picture and gain new insights .",
    "the introduction of the free inelastic hard spheres model has been of fundamental relevance for the rigorous foundation of granular kinetic theory and hydrodynamics  @xcite .",
    "the model consists of a gas of @xmath10 hard spheres in a volume @xmath11 , with inelastic collisions modeling the macroscopic nature of grains : part of the energy of the relative motion between two colliding grains is irreversibly dissipated into heat .",
    "such simple generalization of the hard sphere model leads to dramatic consequences : the gas performs a non - stationary dynamics , cooling down and evolving toward a final state of thermal death .",
    "moreover , in large enough systems a homogeneous granular gas is unstable toward the formation of vortices and clusters of closely packed grains .    a satisfying description of the late dynamics of the gas , after the onset of strong inhomogeneity , is still lacking .",
    "coarse - grained descriptions in terms of hydrodynamic fields are made difficult by an apparently general lack of separation between microscopic and macroscopic scales  @xcite .",
    "velocity or density structure factors , usually difficult to be measured because of rapid temporal evolution , indicate a generic growth of structures but are insufficient to appreciate the rich kinetic behavior at the level of small groups of grains .",
    "analogies with percolation transitions , burgers models , or @xmath12 turbulence have been proposed , sometimes on the mere basis of phenomenological similitudes .    in front of the openness of this problem",
    ", we propose a novel method of analysis , borrowed to the graph s theory , the so - called @xmath2-core analysis  @xcite : a @xmath2-core is the maximum subgraph containing only nodes with at least @xmath2 links in the same subgraph .",
    "very recently , the theory of @xmath2-cores has proved to be useful in defining a possible universality class for the dynamical glass transition , the bootstrap ( also called `` jamming '' ) percolation  @xcite . in simple models of glass forming liquids , at finite temperature and above a critical value of the tunable average density , a jammed giant component in the @xmath2-core subset of the contact network ( defined in a specific way )",
    "percolates the system , marking a breaking of ergodicity .",
    "even if these works have been of some inspiration to us , we stress that our study addresses a different phenomenology and applies the analysis of graphs in a substantially different way .",
    "therefore we do not claim any analogy between the dynamical breaking of the homogeneous cooling state of a granular gas and the jamming percolation or any other proposed glass transition scenario .",
    "our proposal is to dynamically construct a graph by linking two nodes ( particles ) each time a collision happens : the resulting graph grows with time and the average number of links per node is equal to two times the average number of collisions per particle .",
    "the decomposition of the interaction network into a hierarchy of cores of increasing degree of self - interaction will prove to be a powerful tool to distinguish between particles in the solid - like phase from those in the fluid - like phase .",
    "the sequence of collisions in the non - homogeneous state is in fact dominated by repeated impacts among grains trapped into sorts of self - sustained cages with very small escape probabilities .",
    "such cages can be thought as almost closed _ communities _ in an interaction network .",
    "strongly dissipating collisions , on the other side , are mostly concentrated outside of those cages , in the periphery of clusters , and involve particles which still have a certain degree of mobility .",
    "more specifically , the @xmath2-core decomposition of the collision network appears as the natural characterization of the violation of molecular chaos . in an ideal gas ,",
    "i.e. a gas satisfying the molecular chaos assumption , a grain never collides with another grain that is connected ( through collisions ) to its own previous history . in terms of graphs ,",
    "true molecular chaos is equivalent to the following statement : the collision network is a tree , and therefore all the cores of index larger than @xmath13 are empty .",
    "the minimal mechanism of molecular chaos breaking is that of _ rings collisions _ , which appear as loops in the collision graph , i.e. the simplest structures in cores of index @xmath14 .",
    "an example of dynamical collision network , with trees and loops , is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : rings ] .",
    "cores of high degrees , i.e. systematic violations of molecular chaos , appear naturally in any finite system , even with purely random collisions .",

    "iv we will show numerical results for the homogeneous state , while the non - homogeneous state will be discussed in section v. in section vi we discuss a model of random correlated collisions that reproduces the main features observed in a non - homogeneous granular gas .",
    "a discussion with conclusions and perspectives will come in section vii .",
    "one of the simplest models of granular gas is the gas of free inelastic hard objects ( rods , disks or spheres , depending on the dimensionality ) with constant coefficient of restitution .",

    "this model is widely used in the theoretical work on granular gases , conveying usefulness and simplicity : it reproduces the main features of real dilute granular experiments , allows fast event driven simulations and is prone to analytical formalization , being at the very basis of rigorous kinetic theories  @xcite .",

    "a thermalization phase follows , where the system evolves with elastic collisions .",
    "finally the real inelastic evolution begins : all time and collision counters start from this moment . during evolution , the granular temperature decreases since a fraction of kinetic energy is lost after each collision .",
    "nevertheless the initial stage of the cooling remains homogeneous in space , with a decay of the granular temperature given by the haff law : @xmath27 with @xmath28 , @xmath29 the mean free time between collisions at the beginning of the evolution , and @xmath30 . during the hcs",

    "a sign of this symmetry breaking is the departure from the haff law : the growth of structures reduces the dissipation , reflected by a slower decay of @xmath33 .",
    "the generally accepted scenario is a two - stages process : initially the density remains homogeneous while a macroscopic velocity field with vortical structures emerges ( shear instability ) ; after a while the density field begins to develop clusters ( clustering instability ) . both kinds of structures seem to obey a coarsening dynamics with characteristic lengths growing as @xmath37  @xcite . in fig .",

    "the observation of this `` final '' cooling regime has been made possible by implementing a regularization of the dynamics , in order to get rid of the inelastic collapse problem .",
    "inelastic collapse  @xcite is a singularity of the inelastic hard spheres dynamics which is triggered by rare collisions happening at very low relative velocities and in situations of high density , and it is not related to the shear and clustering instability .",
    "many kinds of regularization have been proposed : in the rest of our paper we will use the one implemented by ben - naim et al .",
    "@xcite , the so - called elastic cut - off : all collisions happening at a relative velocity @xmath39 are treated as elastic . we ( as well as in ben - naim s work ) have verified that the statistics behavior ( e.g. @xmath33 and @xmath34 vs. @xmath1 ) does not depend on the choice of @xmath40 , provided that @xmath41 .",
    "the percentage of those `` fake '' elastic collisions remains negligible , but they are enough to prevent the collapse .",
    "the main characterization of the asymptotic regime , independently of the regularization mechanism , is the granular temperature decay , @xmath42 in @xmath14 dimensions .",
    "the @xmath5 law could be generally explained as the consequence of some kind of diffusion , where an energy decay @xmath43 is expected .",
    "while this seems true for the velocity field at the beginning of the instability , i.e. still in the presence of a homogeneous density distribution  @xcite , it becomes less evident in the asymptotic , strongly compressible , situation .",

    "a @xmath2-core of @xmath64 can therefore be obtained by recursively removing all the vertices of degree less than @xmath2 , until all vertices in the remaining graph have degree at least @xmath2 .",
    "it is worth remarking that this process is not equivalent to prune vertices of a certain degree . indeed , a star - like subgraph with node with a high degree that connect many vertices with degree one and connected only with a single edge to the rest of the graph is going to belong only to the first core no matter how high is the degree of the node .",
    "we will also use the following definitions    [ coreness ] a vertex @xmath19 has _ shell index _",

    "[ component ] a _ component _ is a connected subgraph , i.e. a path exists between any pair of nodes in the same component .",
    "the @xmath2-core decomposition therefore identifies progressively internal cores and decomposes the network layer by layer , revealing the structure of the different k - shells from the outmost one to the more internal one ( e.g. fig .",
    "[ fig : kcores ] ) .",
    "now , we define a collision network as follows : each particle is a node of the network , and each collision between two particles is represented by a connection between both nodes .",
    "this network has the particularity that each node may have multiples connections with other nodes .",
    "technically we say that a collision network is not a graph , but a multigraph , i.e each edge may be multiple .",
    "we have considered two possibilities to build a dynamical collision network at time @xmath1 .",
    "the first is obtained collecting all collisions from time @xmath0 to time @xmath1 : we call it a _ complete _ network .",
    "the second one is built taking only the collisions occurred during a window of time of fixed length ( in terms of number of collisions ) , ending at time @xmath1 : this has been called a _ partial _ network .",
    "qualitatively the analysis of both networks produce the same results : the distribution of populated shells is narrow in the uncorrelated / homogeneous phase and is very spread in the correlated / inhomogeneous one .",
    "the shell distribution in the partial network has the advantage of being concentrated in a fixed range of shells indexes , while the complete network distribution shifts with time toward high shell numbers , since the average number of links per node is growing . on the other side ,",
    "the complete network offers a better resolution of higher cores , which becomes crucial in the non - homogeneous regime : during this regime , defining a characteristic time scale and choosing the length of the time window for the partial network gets harder and harder . for this reason , in the following",
    ", we have focused our attention on the complete network .",
    "it is important to remark that the time complexity to compute the @xmath2-core decomposition is very low .",
    "the vertex degree @xmath66 is given by the number of nearest neighbors .",
    "given a graph @xmath64 represented by its list of vertices , where each vertex has a list of neighbors , the @xmath2-core decomposition can be computed as following :    * make an ordered array of lists , where each list is composed by the vertices with the same degree .",
    "this step takes @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the number of vertices .",
    "* compute each @xmath2-core , recursively , starting by the minimum degree @xmath69 , until any vertex remains in the graph .",
    "the time complexity of this step is @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is the number of edges .    to compute each @xmath2-core ,",
    "it is enough to cut the vertices , and their corresponding edges , with degree lower than @xmath2 .",
    "note that when a node loses a neighbor , its degree is decreased , therefore it changes its degree - list and may possibly fall into a degree - list which is being cut .",
    "then , the final time complexity for a general graph is @xmath72 , which is transformed into @xmath70 for a connected graph ( where @xmath73 ) .    using this algorithm",
    ", it is very easy to compute the @xmath2-shell .",
    "normally , the algorithm begins from the nodes in the @xmath74 list .",

    "in particular we will analyze the dynamical collision network of four different models :    * a `` small '' system of inelastic hard disks ( @xmath55 ) that cools down staying in the hcs during its whole history ; * an elastic system ( @xmath79 ) that permanently remains homogeneous in its equilibrium dynamics ; * a system of inelastic hard disks simulated with the so - called homogeneous direct simulation monte carlo  @xcite ( dsmc ) . in the homogeneous dsmc",
    "each particle can collide with any other particle ( spatial coordinates are discarded ) and the random choice of colliding couples is performed with a probability proportional to @xmath80 , in order to reproduce the kernel of the collisional integral in the boltzmann equation ; * a pure randomly growing network where links ( collisions ) are added with uniform probability on the set of all possible couples of nodes .",

    "the size of the system is compared to the critical size given by linear stability analysis of the hcs .",

    "the small system considered here has a size @xmath86 , corresponding to a density @xmath87 , an area fraction @xmath88 and a mean free path @xmath89 , so that @xmath90 .",
    "the elastic system instead has the size of the large inelastic system discussed in the next section , i.e. @xmath91 ( it is smaller in units of a diameter , but is much larger in units of a mean free path ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : deg_hom ] we present the evolution of degree distribution @xmath92 of @xmath66 edges attached to a node , with time @xmath34 measured in collisions per particle ( @xmath93 ) , for the four different cases .",

    "[ fig : kcore_hom ] results of the @xmath2-shell decomposition are shown for the four different cases .",
    "very similar results are observed for all the cases : a small group of few shells is populated , the shape of the distribution is stationary and is linearly shifting in time towards high shell numbers .",
    "a shift in time is expected from the simple fact that @xmath7 is growing .",
    "since the shape of the distribution is conserved , we can track the growth of the average shell number looking at the index of the maximally populated shell , @xmath95 .",
    "we observe for all the systems a growth @xmath96 . to our knowledge ,",
    "the only calculation of a similar quantity is in  @xcite , in the case of erds - rnyi graphs ( i.e. random graphs with a poisson degree distribution with average @xmath7 ) where the largest index of a populated core grows as @xmath97 .",
    "note that even our random case is different , since we look to a random network with _",
    "constant _ total number of edges . on the other side",
    ", the shape of the shell distribution seems almost identical in all the four homogeneous case and strikingly resembles the shape of erds - rnyi graphs depicted in ref .",
    "@xcite , with an asymmetric distribution and @xmath95 coinciding with the largest index of a populated shell .",
    "in particular a nice exponential fit can be applied to the left tail of the distribution with a growth rate that asymptotically ( for large @xmath34 s ) does not depend upon @xmath34 .",
    "a core of order @xmath2 can be , in principle , divided in components , i.e. each of one is a connected subgraph and they are not connected among them .",
    "we have verified that in all the four considered cases only one component is present in the graph and in all subgraphs of any core index , consistently with the scenario of the @xmath2-core percolation : the maximum core is therefore a giant fully connected component of the whole graph .    from the results of this section",
    "a first conclusion can be drawn on the properties of a dynamical collision network : lack of correlation in the process of link attachment gives place to a well defined , narrowly peaked and shifting in time , distribution of shells . even in the presence of inelasticity we observe an almost perfect coincidence with a randomly constructed network : this is not surprising , since the only difference ( the bias coming from the collision frequency due to relative velocity ) is not a preference on the degree of connection and therefore does not affect the network topology .",
    "also the small spatial correlations present in gases of hard disks with finite diameter , do not play a relevant role : at the level of diluteness , we had considered ( area fraction smaller than @xmath98 ) , they give place only to a small correction in the collision frequency , usually taken into account with the so - called enskog factor in the collisional integral of the boltzmann equation , with a small @xmath45 dependence . in any case",
    "those finite diameter correlations do not bias the attachment between nodes after a given total number of collisions .",
    "tiny discrepancies observed are , in our opinion , due to finite statistics and are not relevant .    before proceeding ,",
    "the meaning of `` molecular chaos '' for real finite systems can now be discussed . as mentioned in the introduction ,",
    "the only realization of a gas satisfying the true molecular chaos constraint is a gas where each particle collides with particles that are not connected ( via other collisions ) with its own previous history : this of course requires infinite particles and gives place to a collision network without cores of index larger than @xmath13 , i.e. a tree structure . in finite systems re - collisions are always possible and",
    "they are reflected in the percolation of cores of growing indexes , as shown in this section .",
    "anyway , a vast literature teaches us that in all systems discussed here , most of the predictions coming from kinetic equations with the assumption of molecular chaos are satisfied . as a matter of fact ,",
    "the violations of molecular chaos described by the presence of cores of growing indexes are negligible for the most of physical observables .",
    "we propose , therefore , to use in this case the term `` finite size molecular chaos '' .",
    "this assumption is analogous to the assumption , typically used in the theory of random graphs , that a graph is `` locally a tree '' .",
    "a striking deviation from this behavior is observed when spatial homogeneity is broken , as we discuss in the next section .",

    "this observation also provides a nice physical interpretation of k - core decomposition : such decomposition fairly manages to discriminate between the gas - like phase ( few strongly dissipating collisions ) and the solid - like phase ( many weakly dissipating collisions ) .",
    "note that , while this separation is clear when the average dissipated energy per collision is regarded , it becomes less evident when looking at the total dissipated energy : collisions in high - index shells dissipate few energy but dominate , in number , the total number of collisions in the gas .",
    "we can still say that the most of the total energy of the gas is dissipated in the first group of shells , but we can not put a clear discriminating mark between `` gas '' and `` solid '' .",
    "another interesting observation concerns the kinetic energy contained in the various shells .",
    "total energy ( i.e. summed over all particles in a shell ) still reproduces the large peak at small shell indexes followed by a very large tail . on the other side",
    "the average kinetic energy per particle has much weaker @xmath2-dependence : all shells contain particles with similar kinetic energies , i.e. velocities in absolute value .    the spatial location of grains of a given shell index , given in the right frame of fig .",
    "[ fig:200_inhom ] , confirms the above physical interpretation : particles in the first group of shells ( indexes @xmath0-@xmath110 , at the time chosen ) are spread in a low density / high mobility phase , while the rest of the particles constitute compact clusters : in particular , higher shell indexes individuate inner grains whose escape probabilities are smaller and smaller .     of the collisions have been taken ) .",
    "each sampled network has the complete visualization ( a and d ) , a zoom of a central part ( b and e ) , and an half of a longitudinal cut ( c and f).,width=646 ]    figure  [ visualizations ] shows a synthetic representation of a part of the total collision network after 100 cpp ( i.e. @xmath111 links ) for both granular molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations , i.e. homogeneous ( a - c ) and non homogeneous ( d - f ) . only a fraction ( @xmath112 , i.e. @xmath113 ) of the total number of links is considered in the construction of the picture : this leads to a distributions of shells that differs from the previous analysis ( core indexes are much smaller ) .",
    "all particles / nodes are placed in the graph as dots : size , gray tone ( color ) and position reflect various properties of that node .",
    "the gray tone ( color ) of a dot tells its shell index ( following the scale on the right ) .",
    "the size represents the number of different particles linked to it ( following the size scale on the left ) .",
    "the position of each node is able to represent both its core index and the connected component ( in its own core ) it belongs : each core component is a group of circles with the same center and radii proportional to the core index , while different components have displaced centers , so that they can be distinguished .",
    "small ( second order ) modifications of this rule are applied to represent also the number of links of the node toward higher shells . in the visualization also a sample ( only @xmath114 ) of the considered links is displayed , in order to give a flavour of the density of connections in different parts of the network .",
    "looking for example at the right frame , one can clearly see that at low indexes ( violet ) there is only one component , at high indexes ( blue - cyan ) there are few different components , while at the highest indexes ( red ) again only one component is present : all this is consistent with fig .",
    "[ fig:200_comp ] .",
    "the reader can find a complete description in  @xcite and@xcite . from this visualization it is possible to immediately evaluate the difference between the homogeneous and inhomogeneous case .",
    "in the first case ( fig  [ visualizations ] frames a - c ) there are very few shells and most of the particles are in the maximum core , while all the cores have a unique connected component , reminding a random graph behavior  @xcite . on the contrary , in the non homogeneous case ( frames d - f of fig  [ visualizations ] ) , several components are present ,",
    "each representing a cluster , while the index of the maximum core is much larger than in the homogeneous case .",
    "here we propose a minimal algorithm to stochastically build up a network with properties similar to those observed in the collision network for homogeneous and non - homogeneous granular gases .",
    "the number of nodes , @xmath10 , is constant with time , while links connecting pair of nodes are added in sequence .",
    "a parameter @xmath115 $ ] denotes the percentage of links homogeneously created .",
    "the algorithm consists in sequential steps , at each step the following happens :    1 .",
    "the first node @xmath19 is chosen with uniform probability among the @xmath10 nodes ; 2 .   a random number @xmath116 is generated in the range @xmath117 ; 3 .   *",
    "if * @xmath118 the second node @xmath20 is chosen with uniform probability among the @xmath119 left nodes , i.e. @xmath120 ; a new link @xmath121 is added ; then repeat from 1 ; 4 .   *",
    "if * @xmath122 , a sequence ( `` chain of recollisions '' ) of @xmath123 links is added ; @xmath123 is equal to the degree @xmath124 of node @xmath19 ( number of links attached to @xmath19 ) ; * * for * 1 * to * @xmath123 * do * * * choose uniformely one of @xmath19 s links , and put another link to that neighbor * when the sequence of @xmath123 `` recollisions '' ends , repeat from 1 .",
    "the results of the simulations of this simple model appear in fig .",
    "[ fig : model]a . when @xmath125 , the results of all homogeneous models are reproduced .",
    "the distribution of shells is peaked at a value @xmath126 and all populated cores are spanned by a single connected component .",
    "when @xmath127 , the situation radically changes : the distribution of shells becomes broad , fairly resembling those of fig .",
    "[ fig : kcore_inhom ] , with many components in the cores with high indexes .",
    "in particular the gaussian - like shape in the low - index range and @xmath128 power law decay for the population of shell with high indexes is reproduced .",
    "these remarkable findings suggest that the above algorithm contains the ingredients sufficient to explain the topology of recollisions in non - homogeneous granular gases .",
    "we have also tempted different algorithms , changing the kind of preferential bias : most of them generated strongly different distributions .",
    "a variant of the model where @xmath123 is uniformly randomly chosen between @xmath13 and @xmath124 displays an intermediate behavior , with a peak at low - index shells , characteristic of the homogeneous systems , and the @xmath128 tail observed in correlated systems . in summary ,",
    "the mechanism depicted in the rules 1 - 4 above seems the only one to fully recover the physical distribution of shells and components .    to conclude this analysis",
    ", we now speculate about the possibility of recovering the physical decay of the granular temperature using this minimal model for recollisions . assigning initial random velocity vectors ( in 2d ) to all @xmath10 nodes , from a normal distribution , and updating the velocities of linked nodes @xmath19 and @xmath20 by eq .",
    "[ eq : rule ] at every new link , we obtain a decay of granular temperature . in the collision rule",
    "we randomly choose the angle ( with a fixed axis ) of the unitary vector @xmath25 from a uniform probability in @xmath129 .",
    "our first observation concerns energy dissipation : as in the granular gas ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:200_inhom]b ) , lower shells contain the most dissipating collisions .",
    "one can also study energy dissipation in different kinds of collisions ( those with @xmath118 against those with @xmath130 ) : on average , taken over a large and fixed number of total collisions , the energy dissipated in the first kind is two order of magnitude larger than the second .",
    "finally , we have provided our network model with a physical time @xmath1 : at each new link / collision , time advances of a step @xmath131 .",
    "this allows us to measure the time decay of temperature @xmath46 , which is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : model]b",
    ". one can easily recognize the haff decay @xmath132 in the homogeneous situation , @xmath125 , i.e. in the absence of recollisions chains , and the non - homogeneous decay @xmath5 when @xmath127 .",
    "the consistency of the @xmath125 case with the haff law is expected since , for this choice of the parameter , the model is equivalent to the dsmc model discussed as third case in section  [ sec : hom ] : particles in fact collide at random , but their collision rate is proportional @xmath133 .",
    "note also that the variation with @xmath123 random in @xmath134 $ ] does not reproduce the @xmath5 decay when @xmath127 .",
    "the same happens , for example , if one takes @xmath123 to be a fixed fraction of @xmath124 .",
    "since the @xmath128 tail is obtained also with those variations of the model , we must conclude that the @xmath5 energy decay is much less related to such tail than to the shape of shell distribution of low indexes .",
    "this is consisten with the observation that energy dissipation is mostly concentrated in the low index range .",
    "these are preliminar results that are being explored in an ongoing investigation  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , already at this level , they are striking and indicate that the proposed recollision mechanism is close to the one at work in the asymptotic non - homogeneous state of the granular gas .",
    "in this work we have exploited a novel statistical method , originally introduced in the theory of random graphs , to gather information about recollisions ( i.e. collisions among correlated particles ) in a cooling granular gas .",
    "we constructed a network using the collision sequence up to a given time , then we decomposed it in the @xmath2-core and @xmath2-shell structure . in the homogeneous state",
    ", the finiteness of the system naturally induces a giant component that percolates the core of index @xmath106 where @xmath34 is time measured as a number of collisions per particles .",
    "when the gas becomes inhomogeneous , because of inelasticity and large size , the system separates into two populations with dramatically different core statistics : a large component percolates the low index @xmath2-cores , while the rest of the gas ( a non negligible part ) is found in a finite ( small ) number of disconnected components at very high index @xmath2-cores , corresponding to spatial clusters .",
    "the dilute low - core phase is characterized by strongly dissipating collisions , while in the clustered high - core phase the dissipated energy per collision is @xmath135 times smaller .",
    "the whole phenomenology is well reproduced by a simple model which distillates the crucial ingredients of the recollision mechanism .",
    "this model consists in a randomly growing network which , tuning a `` homogeneity '' parameter , displays the same features of both homogeneous and non - homogeneous granular gases .",
    "the success of this model is the ability to reproduce , when supplied with a reasonable measure of physical time , the observed decay of temperature @xmath136 which has received many non - conclusive interpretations in the previous literature  @xcite .",
    "the lack of spatial coordinates for particles , in the proposed algorithm , suggests that the statistics of recollisions and the energy decay do not directly depend on the spatial arrangement of clusters , which is usually observed to happen in the form of string - like structures .    the collision network analysis can also be applied to any `` hard core '' system , including systems with soft interactions that can be simplified as piecewise hard - like potentials .",
    "a natural extension is the study of hard disks and spheres gases at very high packing fractions , with the hope of elucidating the glass transition in off - lattice systems , as well as experimental studies of granular materials , where the use of rapid cameras is today able to collect huge amounts of collisional data .    _",
