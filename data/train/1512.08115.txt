    "according to von neumann s projection principle @xcite , when some measurement is performed on one subsystem of the quantum - mechanically correlated system , the effect of the measurement outcome appears in the other subsystem . in particular , when a correlated two - mode optical field is prepared in an entangled state of two subsystems and the measurement is performed on one subsystem , then the quantum state of the other subsystem can be reduced to a new state @xcite .",

    "hence the bs and the pa are key optical devices to obtain quantum - mechanically correlated state @xcite . if appropriate measurement , such as homodyne measurement and photon counting , is employed in one of the output ports , then conditional quantum state is generated in other output port . among the schemes of conditional measurement ,",
    "the most feasible strategy is quantum - optical catalysis , proposed by lovvky and mlynek @xcite .",
