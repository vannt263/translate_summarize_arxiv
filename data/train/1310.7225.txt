    "the hydration thermodynamics of analogs of amino acid side - chains or of amino acid side - chains in small model peptides have often been used to understand protein folding and protein - protein association .",
    "examples of such approaches abound in the biochemical literature . an admittedly biased list of a very small number of the many pioneering investigations where this approach has been used include work identifying hydrophobicity as a dominant force in protein folding @xcite , investigations of protein denaturation @xcite , interpretation of calorimetric data on protein unfolding @xcite , and more recently , investigations on the role of osmolytes in protein folding @xcite . drawing upon insights attributed to cohn and edsall , tanford @xcite formulated this approach into a quantitative , predictive framework . in his approach ,",
    "the free energy of unfolding is given as a sum of the free energy of transfer of `` the small component groups of the molecule , from the environment they have in the native form , to the environment they have in the unfolded form '' @xcite .",
    "accounting for subsequent refinements that included corrections for the solvent - exposure of the `` small component groups '' ( cf .",
    "ref .  ) , the generic equation of the unfolding free energy ( @xmath1 ) can be written as @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the free energy of transferring the group @xmath4 from some reference phase to liquid water , and @xmath5 is a factor that corrects for the change in solvent - exposure of the group @xmath4 in protein unfolding . in interpretation of calorimetric data @xcite ,",
    "for example , a gas - phase reference is natural , as is also the case in this article .",
    "the same form of equation can also be used to describe the effect of osmolytes on protein unfolding : identifying @xmath3 with the free energy for transferring the group between water and the aqueous osmolyte solution and @xmath5 with the change in the solvent exposure upon unfolding in the osmolyte solution relative to water , the above equation directly gives the so - called @xmath6-value for 1  m osmolyte @xcite .    at a time when theory , simulations , and experimental techniques were much less developed than they are now , the group - additive approach a pragmatic first step to understand the hydration thermodynamics of a complicated macromolecule .",
    "but it is also important to assess its limitations , and probe if the _ physical conclusions _ based on this approach are valid .",
    "for example , the group - additive model appears to capture the effect of osmolytes rather well @xcite : the predicted and experimentally determined @xmath6-values agree to within a couple kcal / mol for proteins with about 100 residues . on this basis",
    "it has been suggested that osmolytes largely act by tuning the solubility of the peptide backbone @xcite .",
    "our recent simulation - based scrutiny of the transfer for a peptide , however , suggests that the good agreement in @xmath6-values likely arises because solvent - mediated correlations between two groups largely cancel in the water - to - osmolyte transfer @xcite .",
    "further , in the vapor - to - liquid transfer , a situation where solvent - mediated correlations are preserved , the identified group - additive contribution of the peptide group depends on whether blocked - gly@xmath7 or cyclic - diglycine was used as a model : that is the group - contribution was not context independent as often assumed .",
    "building on the work noted above @xcite , and other recent studies that have exposed limitations of the additive model @xcite , here we study how well a model of the side - chain describes the hydration of the side - chain and , most importantly , whether the physical conclusions about hydrophobicity of a model are applicable to the side - chain .",
    "the problem we consider is the vapor - to - water transfer ( hydration ) of an isoleucine side - chain in the context of model extended and helical peptides .",
    "butane in the _ gauche _ conformation , matching exactly the side - chain conformation of the isoleucine in extended peptides , is used as a small - molecule analog of the isoleucine side - chain .",
    "as before , we parse the hydration free energy into hydrophobic and hydrophilic contributions .",
    "we find that the net hydration free energy of the target peptide igggg or ggigg is predicted to within 2  kcal / mol ( in a net free energy of about 30  kcal / mol ) using the hydration free energy of ggggg and @xmath0-butane , appropriately adjusting for solvent exposure of ggggg and isoleucine side - chain in the target peptide .",
    "but , the underlying components convey a different picture .",
    "using the @xmath0-butane model will cause one to overestimate substantially the hydrophobicity of the isoleucine side - chain in the peptide models .",
    "since the @xmath0-butane model also underestimates the hydrophilic contributions , the net chemical potential works out reasonably well .",
    "importantly , using group - additivity the magnitude of the excess enthalpy and entropy of hydration are also incorrectly predicted , but these also balance one - another .",
    "similar trends are also found when we use the conditional hydration free energy of isoleucine in ggigg to predict the hydration thermodynamics of model helical deca - peptides .",
    "our work suggests that while the group - additive approach may describe the net free energy reasonably well , caution is necessary in drawing physical conclusions based on this observed agreement .",
    "the excess chemical potential @xmath8 and its enthalpic ( @xmath9 ) and entropic ( @xmath10 ) components are of primer concern in this work .",
    "the excess chemical potential is that part of the free energy that would vanish if all intermolecular interactions were neglected .",
    "formally , @xmath11 , where it is understood that @xmath8 is referenced relative to the ideal gas at the same density and temperature .",
    "the averaging @xmath12 is over the solute - solvent binding energy distribution @xmath13 and @xmath14 , with @xmath15 the temperature and @xmath16 the boltzmann constant .",
    "the direct approach to calculate @xmath8 by characterizing @xmath13 usually fails since the high - energy ( high-@xmath17 ) regions of @xmath13 are never well - sampled in simulations .",
    "the usual approach then is to calculate @xmath8 by accumulating the work done in changing the strength of the solute - solvent interaction from a non - interacting solute to the fully - interacting solute .",
    "here we approach the problem differently , with a view to better dissecting the physics of hydration .",
    "imagine an inner - shell ( or hydration shell ) , defined by a length parameter @xmath18 , around the solute . at equilibrium ,",
    "the solute samples a distribution of coordination states @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the number of water molecules within the inner shell .",
    "the association of the @xmath20-water molecules with the solute can be described in terms of an equilibrium constant @xmath21 .",
    "a basic mass - balance then gives the probability @xmath22 that the inner - shell is empty of solvent by @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the bulk density of water @xcite .",
    "the free energy to allow water molecules to populate a formerly empty inner - shell is just @xmath25 . for a solute with an empty inner - shell the solute - solvent interactions are necessarily of a longer - range than for the solute without this restriction .",
    "but these long - range interactions are better behaved , such that for a sufficiently large inner - shell ( typically up to the first hydration shell ) , @xmath26 , the probability density of the solute - solvent binding energy with the restriction of an empty inner - shell ( denoted by @xmath27 ) , is gaussian .",
    "thus the specification of the inner - shell helps separate strong , short - range solute - water interactions from weaker , non - specific , longer - range interactions .",
    "we can consider an analogous process of solvent clustering within the same defined inner - shell but in the absence of the solute ; @xmath28 , the probability to find a cavity in the solvent , has an expansion similar to @xmath22 .",
    "the quantity @xmath29 is the work done to create a cavity in the liquid and is of principal interest in understanding hydrophobic hydration @xcite .    in terms of the short - range chemical , long - range nonspecific , and cavity ( packing ) contributions , we then have @xcite @xmath30}_{\\rm local\\ ; chemistry } \\underbrace{- \\ln p_0[\\phi_\\lambda]}_{\\rm packing } + \\underbrace{\\beta\\mu^{\\rm ex}[p(\\varepsilon|\\phi_\\lambda)]}_{\\rm long - range\\ ; or\\ ; outer } \\ ; . \\label{eq : qc}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] figure  [ fg : cycle ] provides a schematic of the decomposition of @xmath8 according to eq .",
    "[ eq : qc ] .",
    "the constraint @xmath27 is essentially an a field of range @xmath18 that is used to regularize the problem of calculating @xmath8 from @xmath13 .    ) .",
    "schematic reproduced from ref .   with permission from elsevier.,width=312 ]    in simulations , we grow the external field @xmath27 ( instead of changing the underlying system hamiltonian ) to calculate @xmath22 and @xmath28 @xcite . in practice , the field has a soft - boundary at @xmath18 @xcite , unlike the sharp - demarcation suggested in the schematic .",
    "it is straightforward to correct for this effect @xcite , but we do not pursue that here .    for @xmath31 a gaussian , we have @xmath32 = \\langle \\varepsilon | \\phi_\\lambda\\rangle + \\frac{\\beta}{2 } \\langle \\delta\\varepsilon^2 | \\phi_\\lambda\\rangle \\ , .",
    "\\label{eq : gaussian}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the excess entropy of hydration of the solute is given by @xmath33 where @xmath34 , the excess energy of hydration , is essentially equal to the excess enthalpy ( @xmath9 ) of hydration .",
    "the above equation ignores small corrections due to a finite excess volume of hydration and corrections arising from the thermal expansion coefficient and the isothermal compressibility of the pure liquid .",
    "the above framework is particularly apposite to investigate the additive description of @xmath8 . to this end , for simplicity consider the hydration of a dimer aa . within the additive model",
    "the packing contribution of aa is obtained from the packing contribution of a alone .",
    "given that a cavity is already formed around one center , the work required to create the cavity around the second center will necessarily be less than the work required to form the same cavity in isolation .",
    "this is because for the cavity in isolation more water molecules are pushed away and a larger interface is created than when another cavity is in proximity .",
    "thus a naive additive approximation of the cavity contribution for the pair aa will be more positive than dictated by the molecular reality . for the same reasons , less work is needed to empty the inner - shell around the pair aa than given by the sum of the chemistry contribution for each a. that is , the pair additive description of the chemistry contribution will always be more negative than dictated by molecular reality",
    ".    such correlation effects are also present in the long - range contribution @xcite . in this case , however , the correlated fluctuation of binding energies can either raise or lower the free energy .",
    "for aa , we expect the favorable interaction of the solvent with one center to come at the expense of favorable interaction with the other center . for such anti - correlated binding energies ,",
    "the free energy of the pair is lowered , as has been discussed earlier @xcite .",
    "even simple glycyl - peptides show context - dependent positive and negative correlations .    in practice ,",
    "the @xmath8 of a is usually scaled by extent of solvent exposure in aa to model the @xmath8 of the dimer ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : areascaling ] below ) . in terms of the quasichemical decomposition",
    ", we can appreciate that the area - scaling tries to correct for the overestimation of the packing contribution and the underestimation of the chemistry contribution .",
    "how a a local area - based scaling can correct long - range interaction contributions is difficult to appreciate , but this is precisely what is done in experimental analysis .",
    "the pentapeptides ggggg , ggigg , and igggg are modeled in the extended configuration with the long axis aligned with the diagonal of the simulation cell and the center of the peptide placed at the center of the simulation cell .",
    "helical deca - glycine ( g@xmath35 g ) and a helical peptide with nine alanine and one glycine residues ( a@xmath35 g ) served as the reference for the helical peptides , g@xmath35i and a@xmath35i , respectively . in the helical peptides ,",
    "isoleucine was substituted at position 6 , roughly in the center of the peptide .",
    "butane in the _ gauche _ conformation was built using the isoleucine conformation in the extended pentapeptide .",
    "the g@xmath35 g and a@xmath35 g peptides were built from a helical deca - alanine .",
    "these structures were extensively energy minimized with weak restraints on heavy atoms to prevent fraying of the helix .",
    "the g@xmath35i and a@xmath35i helices were built by appropriately grafting the conformation of isoleucine in the ggigg system onto position 6 .",
    "( thus we ensure that the internal conformation of the isoleucine is the same in both @xmath0-butane , ggigg , and the helical peptides . )",
    "all peptides had an acetylated ( ace ) n - terminus and an n - methyl - amide ( nme ) c - terminus .",
    "after energy minimization , the peptide atoms are held fixed throughout the subsequent simulation .",
    "the solvent was modeled by the tip3p @xcite model and the charmm @xcite forcefield with correction terms for dihedral angles @xcite was used for the peptide .",
    "a total of 2006 tip3p molecules solvated the pentapeptide ; 3500 water molecules were used for studies with helical peptides .",
    "the conditional hydration free energy of isoleucine in ggigg relative to the model ggggg is defined by @xmath36 = \\mu^{\\rm ex}[{\\rm ggigg } ] - \\mu^{\\rm ex}[{\\rm ggggg}]$ ] @xcite .",
    "similar definitions apply to the excess enthalpy and entropy of hydration and to isoleucine in context of other reference systems . in experiments",
    "it is often the case that the hydration thermodynamics of the gxg tripeptide is compared with the ggg peptide to ascertain the contribution of x alone .",
    "the zwitterionic amino acid x alone is not used primarily to minimize end - effects . by this yardstick",
    ", we should expect the ggigg peptide constrained to be in the extended conformation to be an even more conservative model to ascertain the contribution of the isoleucine side - chain . capping the ends with ace and nme",
    "further serves to dampen end - effects arising from long - range electrostatic interactions .",
    "the free energy calculations and error analysis exactly follow the procedure described earlier @xcite .",
    "briefly , the free energy to apply the field is obtained by growing the field between 0 and 5   .",
    "we use gauss - legendre quadratures with five gauss - points per unit ngstrom to integrate the force exerted by the field on the solvent molecules versus the distance @xmath18 . at each gauss - point , the system was equilibrated for 0.5  ns and data collected over the subsequent 0.5  ns .",
    "the long - range contribution was obtained by performing particle insertion calculations in the appropriate molecular - shaped cavity ( cf .",
    "[ fg : cycle ] ) to calculate @xmath31 ( @xmath37   ) .",
    "water with the appropriate cavity was simulated for 1  ns and 1250 frames from the last 0.625  ns used for analysis . confirming the gaussian - distribution of binding energies , particle extraction calculations agree with the particle insertion procedure ( data not shown ) .    the excess energy was obtained by adapting the shell - wise calculation procedure used earlier for studying the hydration of methane @xcite . for the peptides , water molecules in the first two hydration shells",
    "were considered , where the hydration shell is defined by the union of shells of radius @xmath18 centered on the heavy atoms . for ease ,",
    "@xmath38   defined the first shell , @xmath39   defined the second shell , and @xmath40   defined the third shell .",
    "we find that the excess energy contributions from the third shell is close to zero , justifying our use of just the first two shells for calculating @xmath9 . for calculating the excess energy we equilibrated the solvated peptide system an additional 1.5  ns ( beyond what was used in the free energy calculation ) , and the propagated the trajectory for an additional 3  ns , collecting data every 500  ps for a total of 6000 frames .",
    "entropies obtained using eq .  [ eq : entropy ] agree with entropy calculated using @xmath41 ( data not shown ) .",
    "further details on the entropy calculations will be described separately .    in experiments ,",
    "conditional or small molecule thermodynamic quantities are used in reconstructing the free energy of a macromolecule by scaling these quantities by the solvent - exposure in the macromolecule .",
    "we follow this procedure and find solvent accessible surface area ( sasa ) using a standard code @xcite and bondi radii @xcite .",
    "the area - scaled group - additive estimate of the free energy of the solute @xmath42 is given by @xmath43 where @xmath44 refers to the side - chain model ( either @xmath0-butane or isoleucine in ggigg ) , @xmath45 is the hydration free energy of the reference for the remaining peptide , and @xmath46 and @xmath47 are , respectively , the fractional solvent exposure of the side - chain and of the reference in @xmath42 . as an example of this procedure , to find the group - additive free energy of the g@xmath35i helix using the conditional hydration of isoleucine in the ggigg peptide , we compute the sasa of g@xmath35i , @xmath48 , and",
    "identify the contribution due to the side - chain alone , @xmath49 .",
    "the contribution of the rest of the peptide is then @xmath50 .",
    "we likewise find the sasa of isoleucine in the reference ggigg , @xmath51 , and of the g@xmath35 g peptide , @xmath52 .",

    "for an additive model to be satisfactory in predicting the thermodynamics of folding , dill@xcite has suggested that the allowable error per group for a modest 100 amino - acid protein is about 10 cal / mol / group ( or about 0.02  @xmath56/group at 298  k ) .",
    "this order of magnitude estimate sets the scale against which we can compare the success or failure of the additive approach . beyond the numerical prediction of thermodynamic quantities ,",
    "our aim is also to question if the physical conclusions based on translating small - molecule hydration data can be used to understand the hydration of a macromolecule .",
    "table  [ tb : penta ] summarizes the results on the conditional hydration of isoleucine in the ggigg and ggggg pentapeptides . for reference",
    "we also show the value expected from @xmath0-butane .    [",
    "cols=\"^,>,>,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     it is evident that the reconstructed free energy of the helices deviate from the simulated values by at least 1.5  kcal / mole , and the small net deviation results from large compensating deviations in the predicted chemical , packing , and long - range contribution .",
    "for both g@xmath35i and a@xmath35i , the magnitude of the minimum error is set by the errors in the long - range contribution to hydration . as suggested in sec .",
    "[ sec : qual ] , trying to model the long - range contributions using a scaling based on surface areas will have limitations : the surface area scaling is effectively a local construct , whereas the long - range interactions , as the name indicates , involves interaction of the group with the entire solvent bath .",
    "the above analysis shows that one of the most often used premises to model and/or interpret protein hydration , namely using data from gxg after scaling for solvent - exposure , is inadequate in predicting the hydration of the same residue in a somewhat different context .",
    "therefore , all results based on such constructions must be considered with caution .",
    "there are two main conclusions that emerge from this work .",
    "first , the conditional solvation of an amino acid in a peptide model is rather different from the solvation of the corresponding amino acid side - chain in bulk solvent .",
    "this point is has been made before , most notably by ben - naim .",
    "what we show here is that assuming a non - polar solute ( @xmath0-butane ) models the side - chain of isoleucine one would ascribe to the isoleucine residue a greater hydrophobicity than is warranted .",
    "we anticipate that even the temperature dependencies of the conditional packing contribution to be rather different from the packing contribution for the nonpolar solute . on this basis concerns",
    "are raised about drawing conclusions about the presumed dominance of hydrophobic hydration in protein folding based on small molecule hydration .",
    "the second allied conclusion is that even if an additive description of free energy predicts the numerical values in reasonable accord with experiments , it is likely that this success arises primarily due to compensating failures in describing the underlying physics .",
