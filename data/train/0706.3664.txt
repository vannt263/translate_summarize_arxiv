    "many examples of long - range interacting systems can be found : self - gravitating systems @xcite , unscreeened coulomb systems @xcite , trapped charged particles @xcite , wave - particle interactions @xcite , vortices in two - dimensional fluid mechanics @xcite , magnets where dipolar effects are dominant @xcite .",
    "the study of both equilibrium and out - of - equilibrium properties of systems with long - range interactions poses several challenges , that in recent years have been faced through analytical and numerical methods ( for a review see , e.g. , ref .",
    "it has been shown that different statistical ensembles can be nonequivalent , so that the equilibrium states which can be reached by fixing certain thermodynamic parameters may be different from those obtained fixing other thermodynamic parameters .",
    "rigorous results have been produced in this field @xcite .",
    "the approach to equilibrium reveals the existence of transient states whose lifetime can diverge in the thermodynamic limit ( i.e. , when the number @xmath0 of degrees of freedom of the system goes to infinity ) : these states can be called quasi - stationary states ( qss ) , and it is worth underlining that they are not metastable states , i.e. , they are not stable local extrema of thermodynamic potentials , but their robustness is of dynamical origin @xcite . moreover , the characteristics of the qss can depend on the initial conditions of the system .",
    "another very interesting dynamical property is the breaking of ergodicity in microcanonical dynamics @xcite .",
    "these facts imply that a deep understanding , in long - range systems , of kinetic effects , and in particular of the features of qss , can be achieved considering both thermodynamics and dynamics and their intricate relationship .",
    "this program has been pursued for several years on a simple model originally introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite and called the hamiltonian mean - field ( hmf ) model .",
    "the model is an approximation of one - dimensional gravitational interactions , and it is also closely related to the colson - bonifacio model for free electron laser @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian is : @xmath1\\ , .\\ ] ] it refers to a system of @xmath0 globally coupled rotators of unit mass , each one being described by the angle variable @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) and by its conjugate momentum @xmath4 ( that in the following , for short , will be denoted as the velocity ) .",
    "the coupling constant is scaled by the number of rotators .",
    "this quite unphysical rescaling ( the kac prescription @xcite ) is necessary to ensure extensivity of the thermodynamic potentials , but it is not dramatic in the study of dynamical properties , since , as long as @xmath0 is not infinite , it is equivalent to a rescaling of time .",
    "the statistical mechanics of this system can be exactly solved , both in the canonical @xcite and in the microcanonical @xcite ensembles , that , for this model , have been shown to be equivalent .",
    "the system has a ferromagnetic second order phase transition at a critical temperature @xmath5 , corresponding to a critical energy per particle ( or energy density ) @xmath6 .",
    "the magnetization , that spontaneously attains a nonzero value below the critical temperature , is the modulus @xmath7 of the ensemble average of the vector : @xmath8 i.e. , @xmath9 , with @xmath10 , is positive below the critical temperature .",
    "the lower bound for the energy density is @xmath11 .",
    "contrary to the equilibrium case , the out - of - equilibrium behavior of the system presents a great richness .",
    "this work aims at presenting some results concerning the dynamics of the hmf model .",
    "we describe the properties of the qss that the system exhibits when the initial conditions belong to different classes . in the remaining of this section",
    "we give a short summary of the results , connected with those presented in this work , that have already been obtained .",
    "microcanonical molecular dynamics simulations have shown that , for energy densities slightly below the critical value , qss are present , whose lifetime diverges with a power of @xmath0 .",
    "this implies that , if the thermodynamic limit @xmath12 is performed before the infinite time limit , the system remains trapped in the qss .",
    "while in the qss , the distribution of the velocities @xmath4 of the rotators is not maxwellian @xcite .",
    "the energy density that has been mostly considered is @xmath13 ; at equilibrium @xmath14 , corresponding to a temperature @xmath15 . in the simulations",
    "the behavior of @xmath7 is studied through the observation of the dynamical variable @xmath16 , while , as usual , the temperature is studied through the observation of the dynamical variable @xmath17 , i.e. , twice the kinetic energy per particle ( let us use , for this dynamical variable , the same symbol @xmath18 of the thermodynamic temperature ) . it should be noted that the study of @xmath19 in the microcanonical simulations is equivalent to that of @xmath18 , since the conserved hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) can be written as : @xmath20 the simulations have shown that the details of the dynamics in the qss depend on the initial conditions .",
    "the most studied classes of initial conditions are those in which the initial value of @xmath19 is either @xmath21 or @xmath22 ( obtained with a uniform initial distribution of the @xmath2 or setting all @xmath2 equal to zero , respectively ) , while the velocities @xmath4 are uniformly distributed in a range whose extension is determined by @xmath23 . when @xmath24 it has been found that the lifetime of the qss diverges as @xmath25 @xcite , while in the case @xmath26 this divergence is linear in @xmath0 @xcite . in both cases",
    "the magnetization @xmath19 in the qss converges to zero for increasing @xmath0 , although differences in the details of this convergence are observed .",
    "for example , starting with @xmath26 the magnetization in the qss , for a given @xmath0 value , depends on the initial conditions ( i.e. , on the different realizations , for finite @xmath0 , of the uniform velocities distribution , see fig .",
    "1 ) ; it is then necessary to perform several runs to obtain an average value .",
    "starting from @xmath24 the different runs are much more similar .    the observed non - gaussian character of the velocity distributions has given rise to a lively debate on the characterization of these distributions .",
    "in particular , numerical investigations have concerned the tails of the distributions , to see if their decay is exponential ( or even faster ) @xcite , or if the decay could be fitted @xcite to the expressions derived in the framework of nonextensive thermodynamics @xcite , that predicts tails decaying with a power law .",
    "the controversy has extended to the study of the anomalous diffusion @xcite , and fits to nonextensive thermodynamics expressions have been done also for the cases where the initial magnetization takes values between @xmath21 and @xmath22 and for the model where the coupling between rotators has a slow decay with distance @xcite ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for the generalization of the hmf model and a detailed study of its equilibrium behavior ) . in this paper",
    "we are not directly concerned with the characterization of the qss in terms of ordinary boltzmann - gibbs ( bg ) or non extensive thermodynamics , and we limit ourselves to the following remarks .",
    "recent analytical calculations have shown that it is possible to interpret the qss of the hmf model within a dynamical approach based on the vlasov equation @xcite .",
    "in fact , it has been proved @xcite that , in the limit @xmath27 the microscopic one - particle distribution function obeys this equation for a class of mean - field models , to which hmf belongs .",
    "following the same line of research , it has then been argued that the qss are formed in a short time through a fast relaxation to a state that maximizes an entropy functional of fermionic type @xcite , similarly to what happens for gravitational systems @xcite . the approach to the qss and",
    "its short time behavior seems well reproduced by this theory , although some details need further explanations @xcite .",
    "the long time behavior , with the slow approach to the final bg equilibrium state , is much less understood from an analytical point of view , although again the vlasov equation can be of help in justifying the very slow relaxation @xcite .",
    "it is this long time behavior that we are concerned with in this paper .",
    "we do not offer new analytical tools ; rather , we study in details the characteristics of the velocity distribution functions of the qss that arise when the dynamics starts from several different classes of initial conditions .",
    "the main point is the introduction of a new tool that characterizes the qss , and that is based on the fluctuations of the phase of the magnetization . mainly on the basis of this tool ,",
    "we show that qss are present also above the critical temperature , a fact that , up to now , has been overlooked in the literature .",
    "in section ii we explain , referring also to appendix a , the different classes of initial conditions . in the following three sections we present our results , focussing , respectively , on the role of the initial conditions on the properties of the qss , on the dynamics of the magnetization using the new tool related to its phase , and on the qss that occur at supercritical energy densities .",
    "the discussion , relating ours with previously published results , follows in the last section .",
    "the equations of motion derived from hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) can be written as : @xmath28 where @xmath16 and @xmath29 are the polar coordinates of the vector @xmath30 .",
    "the equations , that in this form clearly emphasize the mean field character of the system , have been numerically integrated , in microcanonical simulations , with a fourth order symplectic algorithm @xcite , with an integration timestep @xmath31 , which ensures an energy conservation with a relative error of the order of @xmath32 .",
    "the initial conditions that have been explored in this work can be characterized by the one - particle distribution functions @xmath33 that the initial values of @xmath2 and @xmath4 are intended to realize . in this work",
    "we consider initial conditions in which the value @xmath19 of the magnetization is initially @xmath21 or @xmath22 , and a single case where it is @xmath34 . in all cases",
    "@xmath33 is factorizable as @xmath35 .",
    "we refer to appendix a for the expressions of the different distributions ; here we limit ourselves to a few details .",
    "as @xmath36 we always consider a distribution function that is constant inside a range and @xmath21 outside ; the range is determined by the value of @xmath19 that one wants to set .",
    "for @xmath37 we consider distributions with compact support , ( see appendix a ) . among the initial conditions here considered",
    "there are the two types that have been mostly used in the literature : i ) the so called water bag ( wb ) initial conditions , characterized by @xmath38 ( i.e. , @xmath39 ) and @xmath40 between @xmath41 and @xmath42 , with @xmath42 determined by the value of the energy , and ii ) the uniform ( u ) initial conditions , characterized by @xmath43 in the entire @xmath44 range ( i.e. , @xmath45 ) and @xmath46 between @xmath47 and @xmath48 , with @xmath48 again determined by the value of the energy .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the microscopic one - particle distribution function @xmath49 obeys , in the limit @xmath27 , the vlasov equation @xcite ; in appendix b we give this equation for the hmf system . for large values of @xmath0",
    "it is expected that the one - particle distribution will deviate from the solution of the vlasov equation because of finite size effects , but that these effects should be small .",
    "it is immediate to see that a distribution uniform in @xmath44 is a stationary solution of the equation ; therefore , if in addition it is possible to prove its stability , one should expect that for large @xmath0 such one - particle distribution will be maintained for a long time , giving rise to a qss .",
    "uniformity in @xmath44 is not a necessary condition for stable stationarity with respect to the vlasov equation , therefore it is possible to find also nonuniform distributions that produce a qss .",
    "the two questions related to this fact are the following : _",
    "i ) _ if the system is prepared in a generic initial condition , i.e. , a state that is not a stable stationary solution of the vlasov equation , one would like to know if it reaches such a state , and thus remains in a qss before eventually going to bg equilibrium ; _ ii ) _ when the system is in a qss , either by preparation or by reaching it from a generic initial condition , what are the modalities by which the system reaches bg equilibrium , and how the modalities depend on the preparation of the system .",
    "the first question has been recently studied @xcite for a simple particular class of initial conditions , that should relax in a short time to a qss ; answers to the second questions up to now are only of numerical nature , relying on results of simulations , with the exceptions of some arguments again based on the vlasov equation @xcite .",
    "the qss lasts for a time proportional to a power of @xmath0 , after which the one - particle distribution relaxes to the bg equilibrium expression : @xmath50 where the values of the inverse temperature @xmath51 and of the spontaneous magnetization @xmath7 are those computed in the microcanonical or canonical ensembles , and where the normalization factor @xmath52 is proportional to @xmath53 , the modified bessel function of order @xmath21 .",
    "when @xmath54 , the magnetization phase @xmath55 is determined by the boundary conditions .",
    "it is useful to stress again that the qss are not thermodynamical metastable states , and therefore their properties can not be deduced by the study of thermodynamical potentials . in this paper",
    "we provide more extended numerical results on the relaxation to equilibrium of qss , especially with the introduction of new tools .",
    "if the dynamics of the system starts from random @xmath56 and @xmath57 , it usually does not get trapped into a qss , so that the one - particle distribution function rapidly reaches the form ( [ bgf ] ) , then the temperature and average magnetization attain their bg values . only the preparation in selected non equilibrium initial conditions",
    "induces a dynamics that generates a qss .",
    "this is palusible , especially on the basis of point _",
    "i ) _ treated above : apart the case in which the system is prepared in a stable stationary solution of the vlasov equation , it is not expected that the rapid early evolution of a generic initial evolution will lead to such a solution .",
    "usually , the qss have been studied at energy densities @xmath23 slightly below the critical value @xmath58 , and mostly at the value @xmath59 .",
    "however , it seems that there is no argument that prevents qss from occurring also above the critical value @xmath58 .",
    "in fact , in this work we observe that qss exist even at supercritical energy densities .      in the water bag ( wb ) initial conditions ,",
    "as put in evidence in the corresponding distributions in appendix a , the initial angles are all set to zero and the initial velocities are sampled from a uniform distribution centered on zero ; the initial configuration has magnetization @xmath39 , and therefore @xmath60 , as can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ ham1 ] ) .",
    "simulations at energy densities in the range between @xmath61 and @xmath58 have shown that the temperature falls onto a non equilibrium plateau value @xmath62 within a few timesteps @xcite .",
    "however , the @xmath0 dependent value of @xmath62 is an average over many trajectories , i.e. , over many realization of the ( wb ) initial conditions .",
    "for example , if @xmath63 , the canonical solution of the model gives an equilibrium temperature @xmath64 , while @xmath65 . correspondingly ( see eq .",
    "( [ ham1 ] ) ) , the initial unitary magnetization gets very rapidly a small value , close to zero , that characterizes the qss , and , after a time diverging with @xmath0 , reaches the equilibrium value @xmath66 .",
    "a characteristic of the ( wb ) initial conditions is the presence of large sample to sample fluctuations in the relevant observables ( temperature and magnetization ) . figs .",
    "1 , 2 and 3 illustrate this intrinsic randomness in the typical case of @xmath67 : fig .",
    "1 shows the temperature time course for @xmath68 different trajectories with @xmath69 , together with the average time course ; fig .",
    "2 plots the dispersion , at different times , of the temperature : the dispersion shrinks only when the system relaxes to bg equilibrium .",
    "fluctuations around the average temperature of the qss decrease with increasing @xmath0 ; in addition , when @xmath0 increases , the average temperature of the qss decreases and tends to the value @xmath70 , corresponding , according to eq .",
    "( [ ham1 ] ) , to zero magnetization .",
    "3 puts in evidence the decrease of the average qss temperature when @xmath0 is increased , and it shows , for the largest @xmath0 value , the time fluctuation of the qss temperature of a single trajectory . in ref .",
    "@xcite one can find a study of the dependence of the average qss temperature as a function of the initial magnetization @xmath19 .",
    ", @xmath67 , ( wb ) initial conditions .",
    "the full bold line is the average over 20 trajectories .",
    "the dotted lines refer to the individual trajectories , that can considerably deviate from the average . only considering a larger and larger number of rotators the fluctuations around the average tend to reduce . ]",
    "rotators , @xmath67 ; each dot is an average over 100 timesteps . note that , for this number of rotators , after the spread from the initial value ( curves corresponding to @xmath71 and @xmath72 ) , temperatures fall in a large interval up to times @xmath73 ( approximately , the lifetime of the quasi - stationary state ) . only over time",
    "@xmath74 , when the system relaxes toward equilibrium , they tend to concentrate around the canonical value of @xmath75 , expected for the energy density here considered .",
    "short trajectories have been simulated with a smaller timestep , as indicated . ]    , in the hmf model , for the ( wb ) initial conditions .",
    "note that increasing the number of rotators the temperature of the quasi - stationary state tends to the value of @xmath70 , corresponding to a zero magnetization state with energy density @xmath67 . ]",
    "the ( wb ) initial conditions are implemented with a random extraction of the initial velocities from a uniform distribution centered around zero .",
    "however , it is possible to assign deterministically the initial velocities with the prescription : @xmath76 , @xmath77 , with @xmath42 defined in appendix a as a function of the energy density @xmath23 .",
    "we have called this special initial condition isotropic water bag ( iwb ) , ( they had been independently introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . for @xmath27",
    "any realization of ( wb ) should not differ appreciably from ( iwb ) .",
    "we have found that this particular realization of the water bag conditions does not produce time fluctuations of the dynamical temperature .",
    "moreover , in this case , the qss temperatures do not depend on @xmath0 and are very close to the large @xmath0 value of the average qss temperature observed in the case of the mostly used ( wb ) initial conditions @xcite .",
    "besides the absence of fluctuations , it is remarkable that , at variance with the ( wb ) , the qss arising from the ( iwb ) initial conditions behave very similarly to those produced by the two classes of initial conditions that we have studied , in which the initial magnetization @xmath19 is set equal to zero .",
    "in fact , the isotropic water bag ( iwb ) , the uniform ( un ) and triangular ( tr ) initial conditions all share the following properties : i ) the magnetization in the qss is given , as a function of @xmath0 , by @xmath78 ( thus it is asymptotically zero for large @xmath0 ) , and , consequently , @xmath79 ; ii ) the initial velocity distribution evolves in a short time towards an attracting distribution , whose shape is approximately a semi - ellypse ( see fig .",
    "4 ) .    the velocity distribution funtion becomes maxwellian when eventually the system goes to bg equilibrium , leaving the qss .",
    "following this observation , one could represent the function @xmath37 , during the qss , exactly with a semi - ellipse ( that will therefore be equal to the ( el ) initial conditions described in appendix a ) .",
    "the two parameters ( i.e. the semi axes of the ellipse ) are fixed by the energy density and by the normalization condition , and the shape is fixed .",
    "it is not surprising that , as we show in appendix b , at @xmath67 the elliptic velocity distribution function satisfies the condition for its stability as a stationary solution of the vlasov equation @xcite , if @xmath80 . in ref .",
    "@xcite a similar attracting distribution was found , although it was not parametrized as an ellipse and its vlasov stability through eq .",
    "( [ stvl ] ) was not studied .",
    "it should be remarked that the velocity distribution function evolves in time .",
    "nevertheless , during the qss , the evolution is very slow , and the elliptical representation will remain a good approximation until the relaxation toward bg equilibrium starts , when tails in the distribution begin to develop . 0.5 cm    , @xmath67 .",
    "for the ( tr ) initial conditions we give the ratio of the distribution parameters . ]",
    "it is then clear that , if the elliptical velocity distribution is chosen as the initial condition ( the ( el ) initial conditions of appendix a ) , the system will be prepared in a slowly evolving qss , without any initial transient characterized by a shorter time scale .    in the following section we show , in particular , the occurrence of the qss with elliptical velocity distribution function when the dynamics starts from the ( iwb ) initial conditions .",
    "we then study the lifetime of this qss as a function of @xmath0 , introducing a new determination of this dependence on the basis of the fluctuations of the phase of the magnetization .",
    "furthermore , we will show that qss are present also at supercritical energy densities .",
    "in this subsection we follow the time evolution of the modulus of the magnetization , in parallel with the evolution of the one - particle distribution function @xmath33 and of its integral over the positions , i.e. , the velocity distribution function .",
    "this is done for the ( iwb ) initial conditions at @xmath67 , with @xmath81 . as we pointed out , in this case",
    "the equilibrium magnetization is equal to @xmath82 .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "5 the dynamics up to time @xmath83 .",
    "the quasi - stationary state is characterized by a small value of the magnetization around @xmath84 , that persists until times of about @xmath85 , when the relaxation toward equilibrium starts . as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "5 the magnetization modulus , initially equal to @xmath22 , falls to small values in o(1 ) time , with some bounces before setting to the above mentioned value of about @xmath84 .",
    "the arrows in fig .",
    "5 denote the times at which the snapshots shown in fig .",
    "6 are taken .",
    "this figure shows the evolution of the one - particle distribution function @xmath33 and of the velocity distribution function .",
    "the first one is represented plotting on the @xmath86 plane the canonical coordinates of all the rotators .",
    "one can see that during most of the duration of the qss , namely from a time of about @xmath87 up the time when relaxation to bg equilibrium begins , around @xmath85 , the velocity distribution function is characterized by the elliptical shape , illustrated in the previous fig .",
    "the qss ends when the semi - elliptical distribution starts to develop tails and eventually becomes a maxwellian .",
    "correspondingly , the developing finite magnetization can be spotted in the dishomogeneous appearance of the left plot of panel h ) of fig .",
    ", approximately as @xmath88 . a null magnetization is associated to the quasi - stationary state . in the inset : details of the short time behaviour .",
    "data refer to the case : @xmath81 , @xmath31 , @xmath67 . for this number of rotators",
    "the lifetime of the quasi - stationary state is around @xmath85 , then there is a transient ending around @xmath89 , then the equilibrium value for the actual value of the energy density is reached : @xmath90 .",
    "the arrows indicate times at which shapshots of the @xmath91-space are shown in the corresponding panels of the following fig .",
    "when the dynamics starts with the ( un ) , ( tr ) , and ( el ) initial conditions , the evolution of the velocity distribution functions is practically the same as that presented in fig .",
    "6 ( in the last ( el ) case there is not even an initial transient ) . in these cases",
    "the magnetization @xmath19 is practically @xmath21 from the beginning .",
    "space and , in parallel , of the distribution of velocities , ( iwb ) initial conditions .",
    "the run is the same reported in fig .",
    "5 : @xmath81 , @xmath31 , @xmath67 , where the corresponding times are marked by arrows . clearly , after a very short initial time the velocity distribution reaches a shape that is easily fitted to an elliptic profile .",
    "the elliptic distribution is maintained until the dynamics is in the quasi - stationary state .",
    "after , approximately , @xmath92 the distribution starts to develop tails and , after a transient , it becomes evidently gaussian , in the equilibrium state .",
    "data in panel h ) have been fitted to the maxwellian : @xmath93 , the fitted temperature results @xmath75 , as expected . ]",
    "the previous results indicate that the qss arising from these four classes of initial conditions can be described by as an almost - zero magnetization state , characterized by a semi - elliptical velocity distribution function . in the next subsection",
    "the qss is further characterized by a new quantity , the angular frequency of the magnetization , determined by the dynamics of the argument of the magnetization .      in the qss the argument @xmath55 of the ( very small in modulus ) magnetization displays a strongly fluctuating behaviour , corresponding to frequent and abrupt changes in direction . during the relaxation towards equilibrium , while the modulus increases towards its equilibrium value , the fluctuations are much less violent .",
    "this different behavior is plausible , considering the large ratio between the modulus of the equilibrium magnetization and that of the qss magnetization .",
    "we found that this difference can be exploited to give a convenient characterization of the qss .",
    "in particular , indicating with @xmath94 the integration timestep , we define the following cumulative quantity : @xmath95",
    "-\\arg\\left[\\mathbf{m}\\left(n dt\\right)\\right ] \\right|.\\ ] ] this is the sum of the absolute values of the angular distances spanned by the magnetization vector during an integration time @xmath94 , sampled up to time @xmath96 . let us note that this observable is monotonically increasing with @xmath96 , but it is also timestep dependent : for given@xmath96 , it is monotonically not decreasing if the sampling interval @xmath94 is decreased .",
    "fig . 7 , that shows both the modulus @xmath97 and the the quantity @xmath98 , refers to a typical trajectory started from the ( el ) initial conditions , i.e. directly from the qss . from the plot",
    "it is evident that there is a crossover between two regimes , passing from the qss to the bg equilibrium state .",
    "the crossover is characterized by the change in the derivative @xmath99 of @xmath98 .",
    "we find that it is possible to fit the observed time evolution of @xmath98 with :     and of the modulus of the magnetization , ( iwb ) initial conditions .",
    "data refer to the case @xmath100 , @xmath67 . ]",
    "@xmath101    in the qss , and with : @xmath102 in the equilibrium state .",
    "therefore : @xmath103 in the qss , and : @xmath104 in the equilibrium state .",
    "we found that @xmath105 , the derivative in zero of @xmath98 , depends on the energy density , but appears to be independent of the system size @xmath0 ; on the contrary @xmath106 decreases as @xmath0 increases , going as the inverse square root of @xmath0 , while @xmath107 depends both on @xmath0 and the energy density .",
    "namely , it increases with @xmath23 and decreases with @xmath0 . in fig .",
    "8 we show both @xmath97 and @xmath99 for a given @xmath0 value at @xmath67 , while in fig .",

    "show , @xmath99 linearly decreases with time in the qss , and then tends to level off , when the system reaches the equilibrium state . from fig .",
    "9 it is also possible to see the mentioned independence on @xmath0 of @xmath105 , while the different slopes prove the marked dependency on @xmath0 of @xmath107 in eq .",

    "the change of behavior implicit in the passage from eq .",
    "( [ omeqs ] ) to eq .",
    "( [ omeeq ] ) seems to be much more clear cut than the gradual increase of the magnetization ( or of the temperature ) at the start of the relaxation to equilibrium .",
    "therefore , the time evolution of @xmath99 can be used to define the lifetime of the qss in an easier way .",
    "in fact , let us define this lifetime by the time in which the linear fit of @xmath99 in the qss extrapolates to zero .",
    "because of the independence on @xmath0 of @xmath105 , this intercept in inversely proportional to @xmath107 .",
    "the inset of fig .",
    "9 plots the dependence of @xmath107 on @xmath0 , and from this plot it is possible to reconstruct the scaling law of the qss lifetime .",
    "the scaling exponent is evaluated as @xmath109 , in agreement with previous determinations .",
    "the angular frequency of the magnetization , introduced here , provides a very convenient operational definition of the qss .",
    "the latter have been searched for , until now , exclusively at subcritical energy densities , i.e. , for @xmath110 .",
    "however , the observations presented in the next section , based on the quantities just introduced , indicate that qss can be present also at supercritical energy densities .",
    "the behavior of @xmath99 shows that , by starting from the ( el ) initial conditions , the system can be set in a qss even at super critical energy densities . in fig .",
    "10 we show the time evolution of @xmath99 and that of @xmath97 at the supercritical energy density @xmath1110.8 .",
    "note that , also in this case , it is possible to distinguish two regimes .",
    "the crossover is around the time @xmath112 . now @xmath99 crossovers from a logarithmic decay with time to a constant , when the system relaxes to bg equilibrium . in this supercritical case",
    "the equilibrium value of the magnetization is zero and the relaxation to equilibrium is characterized by the velocity distribution function that becomes maxwellian , thing that happens at the crossover of @xmath99 , as we have checked .",
    "although at the crossover the magnetization modulus should remain very small , in fig .",
    "10 there is trace of a small relaxation , possible signature of a finite size effect .    , @xmath113 , ( el ) initial conditions , average over 20 trajectories .",
    "]    in fig .",
    "11 we show that the slope of @xmath99 in the qss is substantially independent of system size , but the function is multiplied by an @xmath0-dependent factor , as indicated by the parallel translation of the signal .",
    "this is the opposite behavior with respect to the subcritical case .",
    "in addition , note the logarithmic time axis , that points , in the supercritical case , to an exponential increase of the qss lifetime with the system size .",
    "0.5 cm     dependence of the time evolution of the angular magnetization .",
    "@xmath113 ; in each case average over 20 trajectories . ]",
    "in this paper we have considered different classes of initial conditions .",
    "we have observed that at long times , before the relaxation to equilibrium , for the classes of initial conditions with @xmath24 and for the ( iwb ) initial conditions , which have @xmath26 , the velocity distribution function acquires an elliptical shape ; this is shown in fig .",
    "4 . this special functional form is a stable solution of the vlasov equation , as shown in the appendix b and in fig .",
    "these results are consistent with the attracting character of the elliptic velocity distribution function .",
    "the quasi - stationary states of the hmf have been phenomenologically characterized through the dynamics of both the magnetization modulus and phase .",
    "these states are characterized by the small value , @xmath114 , of the magnetization modulus and by a linear decay in time of the angular frequency of the magnetization , an observable used here for the first time , that has been very useful to revisit the power law behavior of the qss lifetimes as a function of @xmath0 . moreover , this observable",
    "was effective in showing that long - lasting dynamical states , quite similar to the subcritical qss , are present also at supercritical energy densities ; it has been shown that in this case the time scale for the approach to bg equilibrium is much greater .",
    "recent work on the short time behavior of the hmf model @xcite has studied the dynamics on the basis of an entropy functional which is suitable for systems in the collisionless approximation @xcite , which is generally valid for mean field systems , and where the dynamics satisfies the vlasov equation .",
    "actually , the study was restricted to the cases where the initial one - particle distribution function has only two values : a constant in a given region of the one - particle phase space , and zero outside ( i.e. , the authors consider only uniform initial distribution functions , realizing different initial magnetizations ) .",
    "the dynamical mixing in the one - particle phase space will lead , in a short time scale ( fast relaxation ) , to a qss , characterized by a one - particle distribution function that is a stable stationary solution of the vlasov equation , and that maximizes the entropy functional ; the particular shape of this distribution function depends on the initial magnetization @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations , limited to very short times , were performed for comparison with the analytical calculation : these show that , at the energy density @xmath67 , the qss has a zero magnetization , unless the initial value @xmath115 is above a critical value around @xmath116 @xcite .",
    "finite size effects , acting as a perturbation term in the vlasov equation , will then be responsible , at large times , of the approach to the bg equilibrium .",
    "our uniform initial distribution function , with @xmath24 , belongs to the class studied in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this particular case",
    "the initial distribution is already the stable stationary solution maximizing the entropy functional , and there should be no fast relaxation .",
    "this seems to contradict our numerical results , obtained also in ref .",
    "@xcite , showing that , when we start from the ( un ) initial conditions , the distribution function has a semielliptical shape while the system is in the qss .",
    "then , to have another comparison , we have investigated also a case with initial magnetization between zero and one .",
    "the corresponding uniform initial distribution is the one called ( pm ) in appendix a. we have considered the case @xmath117 , and fig .",
    "12 shows the distribution at different times . in this case",
    "we find that , during the qss , the distribution function maintains the shape reached after the first fast relaxation , that in turns agrees with that obtained in ref .",
    "the different behavior between the ( un ) and the ( pm ) initial conditions can therefore be summarized in the following .",
    "the dynamics starting from the ( pm ) conditions has a fast relaxation towards a qss , with the velocity distribution slowly evolving , afterwards , to the bg equilibrium form .",
    "starting from the ( un ) conditions , where fast relaxation does not take place , the velocity distribution has nevertheless an evolution towards the elliptical form , although quite slower than the the fast relaxation ; from there , the distribution slowly evolves towards bg equilibrium .",
    "0.5 cm    ; @xmath81 , @xmath67 . ]",
    "one can argue that a possible explanation of these different behaviors can be ascribed to a different influence of finite size effects on both cases , according to the following .    as noted before , once in the qss",
    ", the velocity distribution evolves very slowly , passing through a series of stable stationary states of the vlasov equation @xcite .",
    "finite size effects are responsible for this very slow dynamics . as we have checked numerically , when this slow evolution drives the velocity distribution to a situation where the stability condition ( appendix b ) is no more satisfied , a faster approach to bg equilibrium takes place",
    ". however , finite size effects are present also during the initial dynamics .",
    "they have been studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , again on the basis of the vlasov equation , but without any reference to entropy functional ; i.e. , through a purely dynamical approach .",
    "it has been shown that the one - particle distribution function is modified by a diffusion process .",
    "the corresponding diffusion coefficient is proportional to @xmath118 , but the proportionality coefficient can be extremely large for the ( un ) initial distribution function .",
    "this would tend to modify the distribution function rapidly",
    ". it would be interesting to perform the same calculation in the case of the elliptic function , to have a confirmation that in this case the proportionality coefficient is much smaller .",
    "the present work has been supported by the prin05 grant on _ dynamics and thermodynamics of systems with long - range interactions_. the authors thank s. ruffo and a. rapisarda for fruitful discussions .",
    "we collect in this appendix the distributions describing the initial conditions studied in this paper .",
    "let us denote with @xmath119 the characteristic function of the segment @xmath120 , i.e. , the function which is equal to @xmath22 inside this segment and @xmath21 otherwise .",
    "the distributions @xmath121 are the following .",
    "except in the first case , where the initial magnetization @xmath19 is equal to @xmath22 , and the third case , where it has a generic value , in the others it is equal to @xmath21",

    "there remains a free parameter .",
    "the form of the distribution function @xmath37 is that of a box surmounted by a triangle .",
    "0.3 cm @xmath122 semi - elliptical ( el ) @xmath140 with @xmath141 given by @xmath142 ; this case is possible again if @xmath127 .",
    "we have also considered ( wb ) initial conditions where the corresponding function @xmath37 is not realized through the usual random number generations , but the @xmath0 initial velocities are given the values @xmath76 , @xmath77 . this special initial condition has been called isotropic water bag ( iwb ) . losely speaking , for @xmath27",
    "any realization of ( wb ) should tend to ( iwb ) .",
    "the vlasov equation for the one - particle distribution function @xmath49 of the hmf system is given by @xcite : @xmath143 where @xmath144 is actually a function of @xmath145 and a functional of @xmath146 given by : @xmath147 0.5 cm      it is immediate to see that any distribution function which is homogeneous in @xmath44 , i.e. , any distribution of the form @xmath150 , is a stationary solution of the vlasov equation .",
    "the necessary condition for its stability can be expressed using the normalized distribution @xmath37 ; the condition is @xcite : @xmath151 in the case of the ( el ) initial conditions , from the expression for @xmath37 given in appendix a we obtain : @xmath152 that , after integration , gives : @xmath153 .",
    "using the relation between @xmath141 and @xmath23 given in appendix a , we obtain that stability requires @xmath154 .",
    "therefore the elliptic velocity distribution function is unstable if the energy density is below 0.625 .",
