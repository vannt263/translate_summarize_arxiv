    "ngc 3576 also known as gum38a comprises the western part of the rcw 57 complex @xcite and corresponds to a bright knot embedded in a large system of diffuse emission gas filaments @xcite .",
    "this knot is one of the most luminous galactic regions in the infrared @xcite .",
    "it was thought that most of the ionization of ngc 3576 is due to two o stars ( hd 97319 and hd 97484 ) and two b stars ( hd 974999 and cpd60@xmath52641 ) which are the main visual components of the ob association @xcite ; but recent infrared observations suggest that the main ionizing sources of this region are behind heavily obscuring clouds @xcite .",
    "it is located in carina at a distance of 2.7 kpc @xcite and at a galactocentric distance of 7.4 kpc ( assuming a galactocentric solar distance of 8.0 kpc ) .",
    "previous abundance determinations for ngc 3576 are those by @xcite , based on the analysis of collisionally excited lines ( hereafter cels ) ; @xcite based on cels and some recombination lines ( hereafter rls ) of c@xmath3 and o@xmath3 ; and @xcite based on far - infrared data and photoionization models .",
    "the temperature fluctuations problem @xcite is , nowadays , a much - discussed topic in astrophysics of gaseous nebulae @xcite .",
    "traditionally , the abundance studies for regions have been based on determinations from cels , which are strongly dependent on the temperature variations over the observed volume of the nebula .",
    "alternatively , rls are almost independent of such variations and are , in principle , more precise indicators of the true chemical abundances of the nebula .",
    "several authors have obtained o@xmath3/h@xmath6 from recombination line intensities for the brightest regions of the galaxy ( peimbert , storey & torres - peimbert 1993 ; esteban et al .",

    "the cel abundances depend strongly on the adopted temperature while the rl abundances are almost independent of it . in the presence of temperature inhomogeneities",
    "the temperature derived from the [ ] diagnostic lines , @xmath7 ( ) , is considerably higher than the average one and than those temperatures derived from the balmer and pashen continua . for regions the differences in both",
    "the abundances derived from cels and rls and the temperatures derived from cels and recombination processes , can be consistently accounted for by assuming a _ @xmath4 _  ( mean square temperature variation over the observed volume ) in the range 0.0200.044 .",

    "the origin of temperature fluctuations is still controversial and a serious challenge to our knowledge of the physics and structure of ionized nebulae .",
    "we have taken long - exposure high - spectral - resolution spectra with the vlt uves echelle spectrograph to obtain accurate measurements of very faint permitted lines of heavy element ions in ngc 3576 .",
    "we have determined the physical conditions and the chemical abundances of ngc 3576 with high accuracy , including important improvements over previous determinations .",
    "we have considered c@xmath3 and o@xmath3 abundances obtained from several permitted lines of and , avoiding the problems of line blending , including several 3d-4f transitions which are very useful for abundance determinations because they are free of optical depth effects ( liu et al .",

    "the observations were made on 2002 march 11 with the ultraviolet visual echelle spectrograph , uves @xcite , at the vlt kueyen telescope in cerro paranal observatory ( chile ) .",
    "we used the standard settings in both the red and blue arms of the spectrograph , covering the region from 3100 to 10400   .",
    "the log of the observations is presented in table  [ tobs ] .",
    "the wavelength regions 57835830   and 85408650   were not observed due to a gap between the two ccds used in the red arm .",
    "there are also five small gaps that were not observed , 96089612  , 97619767  , 99189927  , 1008010093   and 1024910264  , because the five redmost orders did not fit completely within the ccd .",
    "we took long and short exposure spectra to check for possible saturation effects .",
    "the slit was oriented east - west and the atmospheric dispersion corrector ( adc ) was used to keep the same observed region within the slit regardless of the air mass value .",
    "the slit width was set to 3.0@xmath9 and the slit length was set to 10@xmath9 in the blue arm and to 12@xmath9 in the red arm ; the slit width was chosen to maximize the s / n ratio of the emission lines and to maintain the required resolution to separate most of the weak lines needed for this project .",
    "the effective resolution for the ngc 3576 lines at a given wavelength is approximately @xmath10 .",
    "the center of the slit was placed 65@xmath9 west and 24 @xmath9 north of hd 97499 , covering the brightest region of ngc 3576 .",
    "the reductions were made for an area of 3@xmath9@xmath118.25@xmath9 in the blue arm ( b1 and b2 ) , 3@xmath9@xmath1110.1@xmath9 in the red arm ( r1 ) and 3@xmath9@xmath119.5@xmath9 in the r2 configuration of the red arm .",
    "these areas were chosen in order to maximize the s / n ratio of the emission lines .",
    "a test was made to confirm that line fluxes were not significantly affected by the different areas chosen in each spectral range .",
    "the spectra were reduced using the iraf echelle reduction package , following the standard procedure of bias subtraction , aperture extraction , flatfielding , wavelength calibration and flux calibration .",
    "the standard star eg  247 was observed for flux calibration .",
    "line intensities were measured integrating all the flux in the line between two given limits and over a local continuum estimated by eye . in the cases of line blending ,",
    "a multiple voigt profile fit procedure was applied to obtain the line flux of each individual line .",
    "most of these measurements were made with the splot routine of the iraf package . in some cases of very tight blends or blends with very bright telluric lines",
    "the analysis was performed via gaussian fitting making use of the starlink dipso software @xcite .",

    "the fifth and sixth columns include the observed flux relative to h@xmath14 , @xmath15 ) , and the flux corrected for reddening relative to h@xmath14 , @xmath16 ) .",
    "the seventh column includes the fractional error ( 1@xmath17 ) in the line intensities ( see   [ errors ] ) .",
    "a total of 458 emission lines were measured ; of them 344 are permitted , 108 are forbidden and 2 are semiforbidden ( see table  [ lineid ] ) .",
    "some [ ] and [ ] lines were detected , but they are blended with telluric lines , making impossible their measurement .",
    "several other lines were strongly affected by atmospheric features in absorption or by internal reflections by charge transfer in the ccd , rendering their intensities unreliable .",
    "also , 29 lines are dubious identifications and 4 emission lines could not be identified in any of the available references .",
    "those lines are indicated in table  [ lineid ] .",
    "the identification and adopted laboratory wavelengths of the lines were obtained following previous identifications in the orion nebula by epte , @xcite and @xcite ; we also used the compilations of atomic data by @xcite , @xcite , the line catalogue for gaseous nebulae of @xcite , the catalogue of @xcite for lines and the papers of eptgr on m8 , @xcite on m17 and @xcite on spectrophotometry of the planetary nebulae ngc 6153 , m 1 - 42 and m 2 - 36 .",
    "also , we have used an interactive source of nebular data : the atomic line list v2.04peter / atomic/ ] , directly or through the _ _ emili _ _ code @xcite    following @xcite we have assumed the extinction law of @xcite with r@xmath18=3.1 .",
    "a reddening coefficient of @xmath19=1.40@xmath200.07 dex was determined by fitting the observed @xmath21(h balmer lines)/@xmath21(h@xmath14 ) ratios ( from h16 to h@xmath14 ) and @xmath21(h paschen lines)/@xmath21(h@xmath14 ) ( from p22 to p7 ) , to the theoretical ones computed by storey & hummer ( 1995 ) for @xmath7 = 9000 k and @xmath22 = 1000 @xmath23 ( see below ) .",
    "lines affected by blends or atmospheric absorption were not considered .",
    "the observational errors associated with the line intensities have been determined taking into account two sources of uncertainty : statistical errors in the line flux measurements and @xmath24(h@xmath14 ) uncertainty .",
    "it has not been possible to determine the systematic error of the flux calibration because we used a single standard star ( eg 274 ) .",
    "however , the comparison between observed and theorical balmer and paschen line ratios of the brightest and no sky - affected lines show that the average differences are below 3% .",
    "moreover , in a future paper ( esteban et al .",
    ", in preparation ) , we compare the echelle observations of epte with new vlt data for the same zone of the orion nebula .",
    "these vlt data have been flux calibrated in identical form than our observations of ngc  3576 and do not show any systematical differences in the emission line ratios in common with epte , which differ typically not more than 3% .",
    "therefore , we can conclude that the flux calibration of the data presented in the present paper is confident , and it is not a source of significant systematical uncertainties .",
    "the method developed to determine the line uncertainties consist of the following steps : firstly , the spectral ranges with the same exposure time ( b1 and r1 ; b2 and r2 ) are grouped , then in each of these ranges several lines covering all the intensity ranges are chosen and the statistical errors are computed using the iraf splot task .",
    "error propagation theory and a logarithmic interpolation of @xmath25(@xmath13)/@xmath25(h@xmath14 ) _ vs. _ @xmath17(@xmath25(@xmath13)/@xmath25(h@xmath14 ) ) are used to determine @xmath17(@xmath25(@xmath13)/@xmath25(h@xmath14 ) ) for each line .",
    "taking into account the uncertainties in the determination of @xmath24(h@xmath14 ) and error propagation , the final percentile errors ( 1@xmath17 ) of the @xmath16)/@xmath26 ratios are computed and presented in column 7 of table  [ lineid ] .",
    "colons indicate errors higher than 40 % .",
    "the large number of emission lines identified and measured in the spectra allows us the derivation of physical conditions using different line ratios .",
    "the temperatures and densities are presented in table  [ plasma ] .",
    "most of the determinations were carried out with the iraf task temden of the package nebular , based in the fivel program developed by @xcite and improved by @xcite .",
    "a representative initial @xmath7 of 10000 k was assumed in order to derive @xmath22 ( ) , @xmath22 ( ) , @xmath22 ( ) and @xmath22 ( ) . on the other hand , we have derived the [ ] density from the intensity of 14 lines , that seem not to be affected by line blending , together with the computations of @xcite .",
    "the computed value is very consistent with the densities derived from [ ] and [ ] lines . from table  [ plasma",
    "] it can be seen that all diagnostic ratios are in good agreement , except the densities obtained from [ ] and [ ] , which give lower values than the other indicators .",
    "we have derived @xmath22 ( ) using the classical ratio @xmath133726/@xmath133729 . in spite of the low critical density of the highest level of the @xmath133729 transition",
    ", this ratio does not saturate in ngc 3576 , but with this density we obtained a value of @xmath7()=10800 k which is too high if compared with @xmath7 ( ) and @xmath7 ( ) . due to the extreme sensitivity of @xmath7 ( ) with the adopted density ,",
    "we have decided to use the @xmath273726 + 3729/@xmath277320 + 7330 ratio to derive a new @xmath22 ( ) , because the abundances obtained with the different individual lines of [ ] assuming this density and @xmath7 ( ) are more consistent than those obtained with the density derived from the usual ratio .",
    "it is not the aim of this work to solve this problem but it could be due to several reasons including errors in the atomic data and the uncertainty in the contribution of recombination to the excitation of the auroral lines . to obtain @xmath22 ( )",
    "it is necessary to subtract the contribution to @xmath277320 + 7330 due to recombinations ; @xcite find that the contribution to the intensities of the [ ] @xmath27 7319 , 7320 , 7331 , and 7332 lines due to recombination can be fitted in the range 0.5@xmath28t/10@xmath29@xmath281.0 by : @xmath30 where @xmath31=@xmath32/10@xmath29 . with this equation",
    "we estimate a contribution of approximately 6% to the observed line intensities .    a weighted average of @xmath22 ( ) , @xmath22 ( ) , @xmath22 ( ) and @xmath22 ( )",
    "was then used to derive @xmath7 ( ) , @xmath7 ( ) , @xmath7 ( ) and @xmath7 ( ) , and iterated until convergence .",
    "so , for all the species except for s@xmath6 the adopted value for the density is : @xmath22=2800@xmath20400 @xmath23 .    for s@xmath6",
    "we have adopted @xmath22()=1300@xmath33 @xmath23 , because this ion has the lowest ionization potential of all the species studied . the @xmath7 ( )",
    "derived making use of this density is much more consistent with temperatures derived using other diagnostic ratios than that derived with @xmath22=2800 @xmath23 , which gives a temperature 2000 k lower .",
    "@xcite determined that the contribution to the intensity of the @xmath13 5755 [ ] line due to recombination can be estimated from : @xmath34 in the range 0.5@xmath28 @xmath32/10@xmath29@xmath282.0 .",
    "we have obtained a contribution of recombination of about 7.5% , that represents a decrease of more than 200 k in the temperature determination .    finally , considering the similarity of the temperature determinations based on cels , an average of [ ] and [ ] temperatures",
    "was adopted for ngc 3576 , assuming a 1-zone ionization scheme .",
    "this is because these diagnostic temperatures are the usually adopted ones to characterize high and low ionization zones respectively , and because in our case they are coincident .",
    "we obtain a representative value of @xmath7=8500@xmath20150 k. @xmath7 ( ) and @xmath7 ( ) temperatures are absolutely consistent with the adopted temperature and do not affect to the average .",
    "we have not included @xmath7 ( ) because this is the most discrepant value .",
    "the balmer continuum temperature was determined following the equation by @xcite : @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the he@xmath6/h@xmath6 and he@xmath3/h@xmath6 ratios respectively , and @xmath38 is the value of the discontinuity of the balmer jump in erg @xmath39 s@xmath40 @xmath40 .",
    "a power - law fit to the relation between @xmath41(@xmath38)/@xmath21(h@xmath42 ) and @xmath7 for @xmath43 gives the same result as the method mentioned above , but higher uncertainties due to the statistical dispersion .",
    "the paschen continuum temperature was derived fitting the relation between @xmath41(@xmath44)/@xmath21(p@xmath42 ) and @xmath7 for @xmath45 .",
    "the emissivities as a function of the electron temperature for the nebular continuum and the balmer and paschen lines were taken from @xcite and @xcite respectively .",
    "the finally adopted value of @xmath32(@xmath44 ) was the average of those obtained using the different lines , neglecting those which are affected by atmospheric features .",
    "figure  [ saltos ] shows the spectral regions near the balmer and the paschen limits .",
    "the discontinuities can be easily appreciated .      under the assumption of a constant electron temperature ,",
    "rls of heavy elements yield higher abundance values relative to hydrogen than cels .",
    "this is a well known result that different authors have corroborated for regions and planetary nebulae ( e.g. epte ; esteban et al .",
    "2002 ; liu et al .",
    "2002 , and references therein ) .",
    "@xcite proposed the presence of spatial temperature fluctuations ( parameterized by @xmath4 ) as the cause of this discrepancy , because cels and rls intensities have different dependences on the electron temperature .",
    "in addition , and for the same reason , the comparison between @xmath32(@xmath38 ) or @xmath32(@xmath44 ) and electron temperatures obtained from forbidden line analysis can give an indication of such fluctuations .",
    "a complete formulation of temperature fluctuations has been developed by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . to derive the value of @xmath4 we have followed @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we have assumed a 1-zone ionization scheme , and have combined the temperature derived from the ratio of the [ ] @xmath274363 , 5007 lines with the temperature derived from the ratio of the paschen continuum to @xmath21(h@xmath14 ) , @xmath32(@xmath44 ) , which are given by : @xmath46 \\label{to3},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath47 we have labeled the resulting value as @xmath48 in table  [ t2 ] .",

    "we have found that the rl / cel ratio for o@xmath3 in this case is 1.9 , which is in excellent agreement with the value found by @xcite that amounts to 1.8 ( see   [ recom ] for discussion about rls abundances ) .",
    "also , we have derived the @xmath4 value from the rl / cel ratio of the ne@xmath3 abundance , which is completely consistent with the @xmath4 derived from the rl / cel ratio of o@xmath3 abundances .",
    "we have not considered the @xmath4 derived from the rl / cel ratio of o@xmath1 due to the high uncertainty of the abundance derived from the only suitable rl in our spectra ( see   [ recom ] )    the values of @xmath4 obtained are shown in table  [ t2 ] .",
    "we have adopted a final value of @xmath4=0.038@xmath200.009 , that is , the average of o@xmath3(r / c ) , ne@xmath3(r / c ) , @xmath7(@xmath48 ) , and @xmath7(@xmath50 ) @xmath4 s weighted by their uncertainties .",
    "this value is consistent with the correlation showed by @xcite their figure 8 between the ratio of cels and rls abundances with @xmath7(@xmath50 ) .",

    "there are 91 emission lines identified in our spectra .",
    "these lines arise mainly from pure recombination , although they may have contributions from collisional excitation and self - absorption effects . on the other hand ,",
    "singlets are , in general , more suitable for deriving an accurate the he@xmath1/h@xmath1 ratio , because they are not affected by self - absorption effects . due to the large number of singlet lines detected , and to their good signal - to - noise ratio",
