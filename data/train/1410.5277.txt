    "the standard cosmological paradigm , while successful in describing our observable universe , is plagued with horizon and flatness problems . moreover , despite being able to explain the large scale structure formation due to some seed fluctuations in our universe , standard cosmology fails to provide a mechanism that can produce such seed fluctuations .",
    "inflationary models are at present the only way to provide solutions for these shortcomings in standard cosmology @xcite . according to this paradigm ,",
    "the universe at an early epoch experienced an exponentially rapid expansion for a very brief period due to some apparently repulsive gravity - like force .",
    "such a scenario not only can successfully address the horizon and flatness problems but at the same time , provides a theoretical set up to produce the primordial fluctuations which later may act as a seed for large scale structure formation in the universe .",
    "amazingly the predicted primordial fluctuations in any inflationary model @xcite can be tested accurately through the measurement of temperature anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background radiation as recently done by planck experiment @xcite .",
    "the construction of a viable models for inflation , which are consistent with cosmological observations like planck experiment , therefore is of utmost importance and is a subject of study of the present work .    among various models for inflation ,",
    "the models with extra dimensions have been discussed by many authors @xcite .",
    "such models are independently considered in particle phenomenology due to their promise of resolving the well - known naturalness / fine tuning problem in connection with stabilising the mass of higgs boson against large radiative corrections @xcite .    in this context , the 5-dimensional warped geometry model due to randall and sundrum ( rs ) @xcite is very successfull in offering a proper resolution to the naturalness problem without incorporating any intermediate scale other than plank / quantum gravity scale .",
    "the radius associated with the extra dimension in this model ( known as rs modulus ) acts as a parameter in the effective 4-dimensional theory and from a cosmological point of view , such a modulus can be interpreted as a scalar field which , due to it s time evolution , may drive the scale factor of our universe before getting stabilized to a desired value . the well - known methodology to extract an effective or induce theory on a 3-brane from a 5-dimensional warped geometry model is demonstrated in @xcite where using the gauss - codazzi equation with appropriate junction condition in a two - brane warped geometry model and implementing a perturbative expansion in terms of the brane - bulk curvature ratio , the effective einstein s equation is obtained on a lower dimensional hypersurface .",
    "this eventually results in the form of a scalar - tensor gravity theory in our brane ( known as visible brane ) @xcite .",
    "here we try to explore the role of such a scalar - tensor theory in stabilizing the modulus of the bulk geometry as well as to generate inflation in the visible brane which is consistent with the results obtained by planck .",
    "we show that an effective potential for the modulus field ( often called radion ) automatically emerges from the construction of the model .",
    "the stabilisation requirements put further constrains on various parameters of the modulus / scalar potential . after deriving these constraints we study the cosmological evolution in the einstein frame in presence of such a potential and show that it gives a viable model for inflation with required number of e - folds ( to solve the horizon and flatness problem ) and also gives a primordial fluctuations which is perfectly consistent with the planck results .",
    "the inflation is shown to end with the modulus attaining it s stable value .",
    "hence our set up not only provides a mechanism to stabilise the modulus in the bulk but also provides a viable model for inflation which is consistent with the recent observational results .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows : in section ii , we briefly review the shiromizu and koyama set up @xcite for the low energy effective gravity in curved branes ; in section iii , we investigate the constraints on the potential that is necessary for moduli stabilisation ; in section iv , we describe the inflationary behaviour in our model and constrain it using the recent result from the planck experiment ; in section v , we briefly comment about the recent bicep2 results ; we end with conclusions in section vi .",
    "we start with a configuration which contains two 3-branes embedded in a five dimensional @xmath0 symmetric ads spacetime containing a bulk cosmological constant @xmath1 .",
    "the branes are located at two orbifold fixed points .",
    "one has positive tension and is placed at @xmath2 in the fifth dimension ( the `` hidden brane '' ) while the other has negative tension and is placed at @xmath3 ( the `` visible brane '' ) , @xmath4 being the distance between the two branes .",
    "next we assume the five dimensional action as @xcite :    @xmath5    here @xmath6 is the five dimensional gravitational constant , @xmath7 is the bulk curvature radius which is related to the bulk cosmological constant as @xmath8 . @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the tensions of the hidden and the visible branes .",
    "the 5d line element is taken as :    @xmath11    fixing the bulk curvature scale to be @xmath12 , we define a parameter @xmath13 and assume @xmath14 which is legitimate as the scale of the cosmological evolution in brane is considerably smaller than the planck s scale namely the natural scale for the bulk curvature .",
    "this ensures that the classical solutions of the effective einstein s equation can be trusted .",
    "one can perturbatively expand the extrinsic curvature of the brane at fixed @xmath15 in terms of @xmath16 . at the zeroth order one retrieves the rs model with the corresponding brane tensions :    @xmath17    the einstein tensor can be calculated from the given action ( see @xcite for detail derivation ) and",
    "in the first order , one can get the effective einstein s equation on the visible brane as :    @xmath18    where @xmath19 and @xmath20 . here",
    "@xmath21 is the proper distance between the two branes and is the modulus field in the effective 4-dimensional theory . @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the respective energy momentum tensors in the hidden and the visible branes .",
    "if we now assume that the two branes are endowed with only cosmological constants i.e @xmath24 and @xmath25 then for a spatially flat frw metric with scale factor @xmath26 , the einstein equations in the visible brane are given by :    @xmath27    where @xmath28 is the hubble parameter .",
    "the term @xmath29 can be interpreted as the potential for the scalar field @xmath30 in this model .",
    "to study the dynamical evolution of our system , it is convenient to write the equations in the einstein frame which can be obtained using the following conformal transformations :    @xmath31    we use a field redefinition @xmath32 , such that @xmath33    on solving the above equation we arrive at , @xmath34 where @xmath35 is a constant of integration .",
    "we can also write jordan frame field @xmath30 in terms of field @xmath36 in the einstein frame as @xmath37 where @xmath38 with @xmath39    potential @xmath40 in einstein frame is now related to potential @xmath41 in jordan frame as@xcite , @xmath42 we further define two parameters @xmath43    in terms of the parameters @xmath44 and @xmath45 , @xmath40 has the form : @xmath46 moreover with these transformations , the einstein equations , simplifies to @xmath47    there are several restrictions on the form of the potential so that the model can simultaneously address the following issue : + firstly to achieve the stabilisation of the brane motion , the potential should have a minimum and field value at this minimum should be non - zero to avoid any brane collision .",
    "secondly , the potential should also satisfy the necessary slow - roll conditions to trigger the inflation on the visible brane and finally the spectrum of the primordial fluctuations produced in this case should also be consistent with its recent measurement by planck experiment .",
    "we address these issues one by one to ascertain the viability of the model .",
    "first let us examine the extremum of the potential given by equation ( 11 ) .",
    "the equation @xmath48 gives the following set of conditions :    @xmath49 } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath50 .",
    "the first and the third conditions result the corresponding @xmath30 in the jordan frame to be either infinity or zero . neither of these are acceptable as they imply infinite or zero separation between the two branes .",
    "the second condition is not possible as @xmath45 is strictly positive .",
    "so the acceptable @xmath51 is given by equation ( 20 ) .",
    "also it is easy to check that @xmath52 is necessary in order to have a real @xmath51 .",
    "now if one further calculates @xmath53 , one gets    @xmath54    in order to have a minimum of the potential at @xmath55 , one further needs @xmath56 .",
    "this , together with the condition on @xmath57 , implies that @xmath58 should be negative and @xmath59 should be positive which is similar to the randall - sundrum set up of warped geometry .",
    "further , it is easy to show that at the minimum ,    @xmath60    but the cosmological observations actually is consistent with a de - sitter universe .",
    "hence we need to add an uplifting term @xmath61 in our potential with the condition such that    @xmath62    this feature is similar to the de - sitter lifting by fluxes in kklt model @xcite where the supersymmetry preserving ads minima is lifted to a de - sitter one from the energy of the background fluxes of higher form tensor fields in type iib string - based @xmath63 supergravity model in presence of brane and anti - brane .",
    "presence of anti - brane breaks the supersymmetry giving rise to a positive definite vacuum energy by compensating the ads value of the scalar potential at the minimum .",
    "the mechanism here is to generate some extra energy from background fluxes which show up in the scalar potential .",
    "we should stress that adding this uplifting term does not disturb the process of radion stabilisation and the subsequent solution of the hierarchy problem .",
    "so the final form of the potential is    @xmath64    where @xmath56 , @xmath52 .",
    "we now study the inflationary solution induced by the potential as given in equation ( 24 ) .",
    "we define two new variables @xmath65 and @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the reduced planck mass .",
    "the form of the potential @xmath68 is shown in figure 1 .",
    "as @xmath69 rolls over from the flat part near the region @xmath70 towards the minimum at the either side , inflation continues to occur .",
    "the equations ( 15 ) and ( 16 ) now become , @xmath71    we further define slow roll parameters as@xcite , @xmath72 and @xmath73    inflation takes place when @xmath74 and @xmath75 which are also called the slow - roll conditions .",
    "the inflation ends when any one of these conditions breaks down . in figure",
    "( 2 ) , we show the behaviour of the slow - roll parameters for the potential shown in figure ( 1 ) .",
    "the inflation ends at @xmath76 and hence it ends before the scalar field settles down at its minima at @xmath77 .",
    "the total amount of inflation is measured through the number of efolding @xmath78 , defined as @xcite    @xmath79    to solve the flatness problem in standard cosmology , we need at least 70 efolds of inflation . for the potential shown in figure ( 1 ) and with @xmath76 ,",
    "the required initial value of @xmath69 is @xmath80 to achieve the desired number of efolding .",
    "the figure ( 1 ) clearly depicts that at such a @xmath81 , the field is initially displaced slightly from the flat part of the potential .",
    "after that it slowly rolls down and one gets enough number of efolds before it finally settles at the minimum of the potential @xmath68 .",
    "the relevant observational quantities related to the spectrum of the primordial fluctuations are @xcite    @xmath82    where @xmath4 is the tensor to scalar ratio , @xmath83 is the scalar spectral index and @xmath84 is amplitude of the scalar fluctuation . to comply with our purpose all these quantities here",
    "must be calculated at the time of hubble exit @xmath85 .",
    "when the scale @xmath86 leaves the hubble radius , the number of efolding before the end of inflation , @xmath87 , is given by    @xmath88    so the quantities @xmath4 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 should be estimated at @xmath87 .",
    "the value of @xmath87 depends crucially on the reheating mechanism . for reasonable inflationary models ,",
    "one can show that @xmath91 .",
    "in our case we take @xmath92 which is consistent with the planck s analysis .    the constraints obtained by the planck s measurements are as follows @xcite :    @xmath93    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]      + -1.2 & -0.96 & 50 & 0.955 & 0.003 & 3.09 & 0.02041 & 57.6 & -60 + -1.0 & -0.97 & 55 & 0.959 & 0.003 & 3.09 & 0.01523 & 64.7 & -66.7 + -0.8 & -0.98 & 55 & 0.961 & 0.003 & 3.08 & 0.01010 & 78.4 & -80 + -0.6 & -0.985 & 57 & 0.962 & 0.003 & 3.07 & 0.00756 & 78.8 & -79.9 +",
    "cmb polarization is one of the most important observational signatures that can give important clues about the physics of very early universe .",
    "the e - mode polarization was first detected by dasi in 2001 .",
    "but the b - mode polarization which is a clear evidence of primordial gravitational waves generated during inflation has not been detected until recently .",
    "just few months before , bicep2 experiment @xcite has announced the detection of the b - mode signal for the cmb polarization thereby confirming the existence of the primordial gravitational waves . their measured value for the tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath4 turns out to be @xmath94 where as they rule out zero tensor fluctuation at @xmath95 confidence level .",
    "this result brings in huge conflict with the planck results on measurement of @xmath4 which is @xmath96 .",
    "but the contribution from galactic foregrounds to this b - mode signal has been an issue which has to be settled .",
    "people have shown that although the bicep2 data is consistent with @xmath97 with negligible galactic foreground , it is also consistent with negligible @xmath4 with significant polarization due to dust @xcite . just recently by using the planck hfi polarization data for @xmath98 to @xmath99 ghz , adam et al . @xcite",
    "have shown that polarization signal due to dust over the multipole @xmath100 is roughly the same as that obtained by bicep2 over this @xmath101 range .",
    "this shows that it is entirely possible that the polarization signal bicep2 has measured is not due to the primordial gravitational wave but due to dust . as",
    "this issue is still not settled , we have not considered the bicep2 results in our analysis .",
    "we believe , we should wait till we get the results from ongoing joint analysis of planck and bicep2",
    ".    however we should stress that it is difficult to get high value of @xmath4 in the present model .",
    "but added contributions coming from cosmic defects @xcite , primordial magnetic fields @xcite as well as cosmic birefringence caused by the coupling between scalar field and the cmb photons through chern - simons term @xcite can cause an enhancement to the total contribution for the tensor components .",
    "to summarize , we study a scalar tensor theory that can explain the moduli stabilisation in the bulk geometry as well as can produce an inflationary universe in the visible brane which is consistent with the recent measurements by planck experiment @xcite",
    ". the scalar tensor theory can naturally arise as an effective 4-dimensional theory through perturbative corrections of the brane curvature in a two - brane rs - like set up as obtained earlier by shiromizu and koyama @xcite .",
    "the potential for the inflaton field is not an ad hoc one but emerges from the construction of the model through the effective energy momentum tensor of the modulus field .",
    "the dynamics of radion facilitates the inflation and thus offers a natural explanation for the origin of inflation . such an inflaton field",
    "( i.e. the radion ) needs to be stabilised and stabilisation of the radion in turn is related to the scalar field sitting at the minimum of the potential . to inflict a de - sitter character to this minimum",
    ", we have to add an uplifting term to the potential which is similar to the de - sitter lifting by adding fluxes in the kklt set up .",
    "we show that one gets enough e - folding in this model to solve the flatness and horizon problems .",
    "moreover the primordial fluctuations produced by the inflaton field is consistent with the planck s measurements for @xmath89 , @xmath4 and @xmath90 .",
    "hence the present set up not only provides a viable inflationary scenario which is consistent with the planck data but also offers a possible resolution to the modulus stabilisation mechanism concomitantly .",
