    "according to data of neutron diffraction measurements [ 1 ] and x - ray investigations [ 2 ] the monoclinic modification of layered ferroelectrics -semiconductors @xmath1 undergoes a sequence of structural phase transitions with the intermediate incommensurate phase having the modulation vector @xmath2 where @xmath3 .",
    "@xmath1 crystals have the space group symmetry @xmath4 [ 2 ] at the high - symmetric phase @xmath5 .",
    "the ionic - covalent bonds in layers and ones of van - der - waals type between layers are competive interactions in the structure of these crystals [ 3 ] .",
    "inproper ferroelectric phase transitions in @xmath1 are intermediate between types of mixing and order - disorder with the characteristic value of curie s constant @xmath6 [ 4 ] .",
    "an analysis of experimental data by the temperature dependence of dielectric constant for various samples @xmath1 with monoclinic structure shows that the @xmath7 curves characterized for proper ferroelectrics with incommensurate phase acquire the form characteristic for inproper ferroelectrics with incommensurate phase ( fig.1 , curves 1,2,3 ) .",
    "the detailed study of results of neutron diffraction measurements [ 1 ] , x - ray [ 2 ] , nuclear magnetic resonance and nuclear quadrupole resonance investigations [ 5,6 ] allows to conclude that layered compounds @xmath1 depending on concentration of defects in the structure have different character of phase transitions . besides the considerable mobility of atoms in an interlayer space imparts to the structure the properties of weak glass [ 7 ] .    at certain value of concentration of defects in the structure",
    "the system losing the property of layerity becomes isotropic .",
    "the range of existence of incommensurate phase and the position of lifshits points on the diagram of states depend on concentration of defects in the structure . for the most widespread group of samples @xmath1 the dependence @xmath8",
    "is characterized by the evistenge of two maxima and the value of low temperature peak varies in the large range ( fig.1 , curve 2 ) [ 8 ] .",
    "the anomaly shows itself on the dependence @xmath7 in the range of existence of incommensurate phase at @xmath9 in addition to maxima at @xmath10 and @xmath11 for frequently occurred and detailly investigated samples @xmath1 .",
    "experimental investigations show that the incommensurate phase springs up in the temperature range in which the spontaneous polarization differs from zero [ 9 ] .",
    "in seldom occurred samples @xmath1 ( with large concentration of defects ) the dependence @xmath7 ( fig.1 , curve 1 ) [ 10 ] is typical for isotropic inproper ferroelectrics like @xmath12 [ 11 ] . in this work",
    "the results of differential - thermal analysis ( dta ) of various samples @xmath13 as well as dielectric measurements of @xmath0 are presented .",
    "single crystals of @xmath1 compound were grown by modificated bridgman method at small variation of growth conditions . for dielectric measurements the samples had the form of parallelepiped with parallel edges orientated along crystallographic directions .",
    "the silver paste was used as contacts put on polished surfaces .",
    "the measurements of dielectric constant @xmath14 were carried out on the frequency @xmath15 in the temperature range @xmath16 .",
    "the rate of temperature change was @xmath17 .",
    "the results of dta of various samples @xmath1 are presented on fig .",
    "2 . the samples with one maximum on the @xmath18 dependence show only one endothermal effect at @xmath19 on the dta curve stipulated by melting with the melting heat @xmath20 .",
    "the samples @xmath1 with two maxima on the @xmath18 dependence have two endothermal effects at temperatures @xmath21 and @xmath22 with the melting heats @xmath23 and @xmath24 , respectively .",
    "two endothermal effects at temperatures @xmath25 and @xmath19 with the melting heats @xmath26 and @xmath27 , respectively , are detected on the dta curve for samples displaying three maxima in the temperature dependence of dielectric constant .",
    "the results of dielectric measurements for compounds @xmath28 , where @xmath29 , at both the regime of cooling and the regime of heating are presented on fig .",
    "an analysis of experimental data of temperature dependence of dielectric constant @xmath30 allows to conclude :    -at any @xmath31 the values of @xmath18 in the regime of heating are more than in the regime of cooling ;    -at any @xmath31 the @xmath18 dependence displays two maxima , and the temperature interval between them does not almost depend on temperature ;    -at increasing @xmath31 the temperature interval of existence of incommensurate phase shifts to low - temperature region ;    -at increasing @xmath31 the response of system decreases ;    -at increasing @xmath31 the transitions at @xmath10 and @xmath11 acquire the character of blurred phase transition ;    -with increasing @xmath31 the @xmath18 curve loses the shape and acquires the form characterized for inproper ferroelectrics with incommensurate phase ;    -substitution of @xmath32 on @xmath33 does not change the temperature width of existence of incommensurate phase and shifts it to high temperatures .",
    "according to data of @xmath31-ray investigations the atoms @xmath34 in the elementary cell of crystals @xmath1 occupy the general position [ 2 ] . besides these atoms have high mobility in the interplane space [ 5 ] .",
    "nuclear quadrupole resonance investigations indicate on the anomaly at temperature @xmath35 [ 6,12 ] .",
    "evidently , the relative displacement of atoms @xmath34 in the elementary cell occurs at @xmath35 and this deformation does not change the space group symmetry of the crystal .",
    "in addition , the deformation of the band structure of @xmath1 and levels of adhesion take place .",
    "an increase of concentration of carriers decreases the temperature of transition to the incommensurate phase and increases the response of this system on the external influence .",
    "these facts explain the temperature dependence @xmath7 in the high - symmetric phase .",
    "although experimental data about details of disordering in the compounds with blurred phase transitions are absent [ 13 ] , the broadening of the phase transition is general phenomenon for solid solutions and other disordered structures .    with increasing of concentration of defects in the layered structure the blurring of phase transitions at @xmath10 and @xmath11 and their shift to low temperatures",
    "happen . at some threshold value",
    "the layerity of structure loses and the crystal becomes isotropic and distribution of defects does homogeneous .",
    "as known , if the disordering is homogeneous , a clear phase transitions observed even in amorphous structures [ 14 ] .",
    "an increase of a depth of minimum in the temperature dependence @xmath36 is the result of intensification of the constant of interaction of polarization with the amplitude of the order parameter .",
    "consequently , with increasing @xmath31 the interaction of polarization with the amplitude of the order parameter rises while it decreases with the phase . incidentally , the incommensurate phase behaves inself as modulated one in which the soliton regime is absent .",
    "the temperature hysteresis of @xmath36 connects with the temperature dependence of the band gap with accuracy to the energy of adhesive level and it connects with the inner mobility of impurities of the structure .      with increasing of concentration of defects in the layered structure of @xmath13 the line of lifshits points on the states diagram shifts and the incommensurate phase @xmath38 in dielectric measurements is not observed .    with further rise of concentration of defects in the structure the compound @xmath13 loses the property of layerity and",
    "the sample becomes isotropic .",
    "the temperature dependence of dielectric constant of isotropic samples at the transition from the high - symmetric phase to the incommensurate phase remains continuous , the incommensurate phase has not the minimum and behaves itself as @xmath39 .",
    "consequently , the dependence of physical properties of @xmath1 on concentration of defects is the result of existence of competing interactions in the structure .",
    "the principal parameter determining the mechanism of melting is the energy required for the rupture of bonds in the structure [ 14 ] .",
    "that is why , only one endothermal effect shows itself in the isotropic samples of @xmath1 .",
    "layered samples @xmath1 , having the temperature dependence with two or three maxima , show themselves two endothermal effects on the dta curve .    the opposite isotropic effect connected with substitution of @xmath32 on @xmath40 in the @xmath41 compounds",
    "is not the result of the rise of the tunneling frequency between two positions of equilibrium .",
    "the existence of blurred phase transition and the fact of a decrease of temperature of phase transition with a rise of concentration of defects testifies that the samples with @xmath32 more regulated than ones with @xmath40 ."
