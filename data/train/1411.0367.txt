    "in the ferromagnetic metals one can distinguish the electrons , according to the parallel or antiparallel direction of their magnetic moment to the total magnetization .",
    "the charge carriers parallel to the total magnetization are referred as spin - up electrons and antiparallel to the total magnetization are referred as spin - dn electrons . in these materials",
    "the two bands are not equally filled and hence lead to a non - zero magnetization .",
    "mott described that the spin splitting of the energy bands in the ferromagnetic spin states induces the specific transport behavior@xcite .",
    "he gave a model for the electrical conduction in ferromagnetic transition metals by considering the two independent parallel currents , carried by spin - up and spin - dn electrons .",
    "in the two current model the scattering events with the conservation of spin direction become more probable at low temperature i.e. at temperature lower than the curie temperature ( @xmath2 ) . above @xmath2 , the application of the two - current model",
    "is limited by spin - mixing effects .",
    "according to this model , in the absence of any spin - flip processes the resistivities from two spin channels are added as that of two parallel resistors .",
    "the resulting average isotropic resistivity is given by    @xmath3    and hence the total conductivity can be expressed as@xcite @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the resistivities and @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the conductivities of the spin - up and spin - dn channels , respectively .    in the two current model the total seebeck coefficient ( @xmath9 )",
    "can be expressed as the average of seebeck coefficients from both the channels weighted by the corresponding conductivities@xcite    @xmath10/[\\sigma^{\\uparrow}+\\sigma^{\\downarrow}]\\ ] ]    where , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the seebeck coefficients of the spin - up and spin - dn channels , respectively",

    "this model is applicable well below the @xmath2 and compounds with higher @xmath2 are important for technological applications . therefore , in the previous calculations we have applied this model to study co@xmath0mnge heusler alloy having @xmath2 equals to 905 k@xcite .",
    "but we did not find much importance of the model in the compounds because of the presence of the large band gap ( @xmath15 0.4 ev ) in the spin - dn channel .",
    "this motivates us to search for the compound with very small spin - dn band gap so that this channel can also participate in the transport behavior of the compound .",
    "we came across the fe@xmath0cosi compound which has almost negligible band gap in the spin - dn channel .",
    "this compound is having a curie temperature of 1038 k@xcite .",
    "based on first principles calculations , luo et al .",
    "have shown that fe@xmath0cosi is typical half - metallic ferromagnets@xcite .",
    "however , du et al .",
    "have proposed it as a gapless half - metallic ferromagnetic alloy@xcite .",
    "half - metallic ferromagnets have attracted scientific and technological interest because of their potential in spintronic applications@xcite . in these compounds",
    "only one spin channel contributes to the transport properties if the band gap of the another one is large .",
    "however , contributions from both the channels are expected when the band gap becomes almost zero .",
    "thus in fe@xmath0cosi compound both the spin channels are expected to play an important role in deciding the transport properties of this compound .",
    "ishii et al have reported the temperature dependent data of seebeck coefficient , electrical conductivity and electronic thermal conductivity of fe@xmath0cosi above the room temperature@xcite and show significant temperature dependence . in the light of these data",

    "the absolute value of s increases linearly with the temperature and in the spin - dn channel it varies non - linearly . in both the channels the electrical conductivity",
    "is found to vary non - linearly , whereas the electronic thermal conductivity varies linearly with the temperature .",
    "the overall temperature dependence of the transport coefficients is computed by combining the contributions from both the channels under two current model .",
    "the transport coefficients data thus obtained agree fairly well with the experimental data .",
    "the electronic , magnetic and thermoelectric properties of the compound are studied by using the full potential linearized augmented plane - wave ( fp - lapw ) method implemented in wien2k code@xcite in combination with the boltztrap code@xcite .",
    "the exchange - correlation functional was taken within the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) of perdew et al.@xcite .",

    "generally , heusler alloys prefer two kinds of structure .",
    "one is cu@xmath0mnal - type structure having space group @xmath27 and the other is hg@xmath0cuti - type structure having space group @xmath28 .",
    "the heusler alloys which crystallize in hg@xmath0cuti - type structure are known as inverse heusler alloys and fe@xmath0cosi belongs to this .",
    "these are named so because in these alloys the atomic number of y atom is more than the x atom of the same period i.e. if @xmath29 , opposite to that of traditional heusler alloys . in this structure",
    "the two @xmath30 atoms occupy the @xmath31 and @xmath32 wyckoff positions , while @xmath33 and @xmath34 atoms occupy @xmath35 and @xmath36 positions , respectively@xcite . in this",

    "firstly , we will proceed with the discussion of spin - unpolarized calculation to see how far this calculation is going to help in understanding the transport behavior of the compound .",
    "the electronic band structure along the high symmetry direction in the first brillouin zone ( _ bz _ ) is shown in the fig .",
    "this figure shows that fe@xmath0cosi is metallic as two bands are crossing the _ e@xmath40 _ at 10 different k - points along the w to k direction .",
    "many bands are concentrated around the w point along the x to k direction and the system seems to be unstable .",
    "such systems can minimize their energy by shifting these bands and this can lead to the ferromagnetic ( fm ) ground state as per stoner theory@xcite .    the total density of states ( tdos ) and partial density of states ( pdos ) plots are presented in fig .",
    "it is clear from fig .",
    "1(b ) that there is very large density of states @xmath15 25 states / ev / f.u . at the _ e@xmath40_. since in the present system",
    "the _ e@xmath40 _ is mainly contributed by the @xmath41 orbitals with negligibly small contribution from the other orbitals , so we have shown the partial density of states ( pdos ) of fe and co atoms in fig .",
    "1 . the pdos plot of fe@xmath37 atom is presented in fig .",
    "this plot shows that around _",
    "e@xmath40 _ the main contribution ( @xmath15 5 states / ev / atom ) is from the @xmath42 states with small contribution ( @xmath15 1 states / ev / atom ) from the @xmath43 states . the fe@xmath0 atom shown in fig .",
    "1(d ) , provides more contribution than the fe@xmath37 atom at the _",

    "1(e ) ) it is clear that at _ e@xmath40 _ the large contribution is from @xmath42 states ( @xmath15 6 states / ev / atom ) and from the @xmath43 states it is small .",
    "the dos plots of fe@xmath37 and co atom show three peak structures because of the presence of four fold symmetry in these atoms , whereas fe@xmath0 atom show mainly two peak structures as it is eight fold symmetric . from the study of pdos plots of these atoms it is clear that the transport behavior of the compound is mainly governed by the @xmath42 states and the contribution from the fe@xmath0 atom is more .",
    "now we study the temperature dependent transport behavior of the compound obtained from spin - unpolarized calculations .",
    "the variations of @xmath9 , electrical conductivity ( @xmath44 ) and electronic thermal conductivity ( @xmath45 ) ( where @xmath25 is the relaxation time ) with temperature are shown in fig .",
    "2 . the value of @xmath9 remains negative in the entire temperature range which implies that this compound is @xmath46-type .",
    "the absolute value of @xmath9 is found to increase with temperature upto 350 k and after that it decreases with increasing temperature as is clear from fig .",
    "the absolute value of @xmath9 at the room temperature comes out to be @xmath15 30 @xmath47vk@xmath48 .",

    "the value of @xmath13 is @xmath15 9 @xmath51 . on comparing the temperature dependent behavior of the transport coefficients with the experimental results@xcite one",
    "can easily concluded that the spin - unpolarized calculation is unable to explain the temperature dependent behavior of the experimental data .",
    "as the spin - unpolarized transport coefficients do not show agreement with the experimental results , so we have studied the compound using the spin - polarized calculation .",
    "the spin - polarized calculation is expected to change the dos around the _",
    "e@xmath40 _ by shifting the bands and consequently the transport behavior .",
    "the spin - polarized dispersion curves along the high symmetry direction of 1st _ bz _ are presented in the fig .",
    "3(a and b ) .",
    "the spin - up channel is found to be metallic as 3 highly dispersing bands are crossing the _ e@xmath40 _ at 6 different k - points along the w to k direction . in the spin - dn channel",
    "one can find that the bands are not much dispersing and they slightly cross the _ e@xmath40 _ at @xmath52 and @xmath53-points .",
    "thus this compound show almost half - metallic ferromagnetic behavior .",
    "also the band structure of the spin - dn channel of this inverse heusler alloy differes from the normal heusler alloys , where one can see the almost flat conduction band along @xmath52 to @xmath53-direction@xcite .",
    "the density of states plots of fe@xmath0cosi are also presented in the fig .",
    "3 . in the tdos plot shown in fig .",
    "3(c ) there are three peaks in the valence band of the minority and majority spin channels as is observed in case of spin - unpolarized calculation .",
    "the tdos at the _ e@xmath40 _ of majority spin channel is @xmath15 1 states / ev / f.u and is nearly 25 times less than the spin - unpolarized calculation . in the spin - dn channel",
    "there is negligibly small dos at the _ e@xmath40 _",
    "so this channel show almost semiconducting behavior .",
    "similar tdos plot for this compound is also observed in the earlier theoretical work@xcite .    to see the contributions from various atomic states around the _ e@xmath40 _ , we have presented pdos plots in fig .",
    "3(d - f ) . in these plots only @xmath41-orbitals are shown for the fe@xmath37 , fe@xmath0 and co atoms .",
    "the spin - up channel of fe@xmath37 and co atoms is contributed by both @xmath43 and @xmath42 states , with the value less than 0.5 states / ev / atom at the _",
    "e@xmath40_. in the spin - dn channel , the _ e@xmath40 _ is at the edge of the @xmath43 states of fe@xmath37 and co atoms and shows the almost semiconducting behavior .",
    "the pdos plot of fe@xmath0 atom shows only two peak structure . in the majority spin channel",
    "there are two peaks below the _ e@xmath40 _ and in the minority spin channel one peak is below and other is above the _",
    "e@xmath40 _ due to the exchange splitting .",
    "it is clear from these plots that , mainly the @xmath43 states of fe@xmath37 and co atoms are contributing to the dos around the _",
    "e@xmath40 _ in the minority spin channel .",
    "thus in fe@xmath0cosi , the contribution in the transport properties is expected from both the spin channels . also around the _",
    "e@xmath40 _ different states are contributing to the tdos of both the channels so the relaxation time ( @xmath25 ) is also expected to be different for the both channels .    the value of magnetic moment of the compound comes out to be @xmath15 5 @xmath54 which is as per the slater - pauling rule@xcite and is closer to the experimental values @xcite .",
    "the contribution from the fe@xmath37 , fe@xmath0 and co atoms is @xmath15 1.41 , 2.69 and 1.05 @xmath54 , respectively .",
    "the maximum contribution to the total magnetic moment is from the fe@xmath0 atom because of large exchange splitting in the @xmath55 orbitals of fe@xmath0 atom .",
    "the dos plots of the compound show the contribution from different states around the _ e@xmath40 _ , so the transport behavior is also expected to be different for both the channels .",
    "therefore we have studied the transport coefficients of the compound for both the spin channels and transport coefficients versus temperature plots are presented in fig .",
    "4 . the seebeck coefficient for spin - up and spin - dn channels",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "4(a ) and 4(b ) , respectively .",
    "the @xmath9 for spin - up channel is negative and its absolute value increases linearly with temperature .",
    "the room temperature value of @xmath56 is @xmath15 -11 @xmath47vk@xmath48 .",
    "the negative value of @xmath9 indicates that this is @xmath46-type thermoelectric material . for the spin - dn channel",
    "the variation of @xmath9 with temperature is not linear , its absolute value firstly increases upto 300 k and then start decreasing upto 500 k. after 500 k the @xmath9 becomes positive and again starts increasing with the temperature .",
    "the value of @xmath57 at room temperature is around -13 @xmath47vk@xmath48 .",
    "experimentally , the absolute value of @xmath9 shows non linear increment with the temperature , which can only be understood if one combines the contributions from both the channels .",
    "also we have plotted the electrical conductivity with temperature for both the spin channels in fig .",
    "4(c and d ) . for the spin - up channel",
    "the @xmath44 decreases with increasing temperature which corresponds to the metallic behavior .",
    "the value of @xmath49 at 300 k is about 38,000 @xmath50 . in the spin - dn channel it increases with the temperature like semiconductors .",
    "the spin - dn channel gives very less conductivity , clearly because of low value of dos at the _",
    "e@xmath40_. both these channels show non linear variation with the temperature and have curvatures in opposite directions .",
    "however , in experimental plots the @xmath49 decreases almost linearly with the temperature , thus one can expect the overall combination from both the channels can give such temperature dependent behavior of @xmath49 .",
    "4(e and f ) show the plots of electronic thermal conductivity with the temperature for both the spin channels .",
    "the @xmath45 increases linearly with the temperature in the spin - up channel and at 300 k it is @xmath15 28 @xmath51 .",
    "the spin - dn channel shows that @xmath45 increases non - linearly with the temperature as there is a curvature . in the spin - dn channel",
    "@xmath13 is almost 10 times smaller and its value at the room temperature is @xmath15 1 @xmath51 .    from the above discussions it is clear that the overall temperature dependent behavior of transport coefficients can be understood by combining the contributions from both the channels .",
    "therefore we have applied the two current model to find the total seebeck coefficient , electrical conductivity and electronic thermal conductivity of the system .",
    "the total @xmath9 , @xmath49 and @xmath13 are presented in the fig .",
    "5(a - c ) .",
    "the value of total @xmath9 is negative and decreases with the temperature .",
    "the variation of s with temperature using the two current model shows non linear temperature dependence , as is observed experimentally .",
    "the absolute value of s at room temperature is @xmath15 11 @xmath47vk@xmath48 and is closer to the experimental value of @xmath15 13 @xmath47vk@xmath48 .",
    "the @xmath49 shows non linear increment with the temperature while @xmath13 increases linearly .",
    "the temperature dependent behavior of the @xmath49 and @xmath13 does not show agreement with the experimental data .",
    "this may be due to the reason that the value of the relaxation time has been taken same for the both spins .",
    "as mentioned earlier , the different states are contributing around the _ e@xmath40 _ therefore one expects different values of @xmath25 for both the spin channels .",
    "if we take the values of @xmath25 equal to @xmath58 and @xmath59 s for spin - up and spin - dn channels , respectively the calculated values of @xmath49 and @xmath13 are found to be in fairly good agreement with the experimental data as evident from fig .",
    "the room temperature value of @xmath49 agrees with the experimental value of 19,000 @xmath50 .",
    "the plot of the @xmath13 versus temperature is found to increase almost linearly with the temperature .",
    "the value of @xmath13 at the room temperature is @xmath1514 @xmath51 which is comparable with the experimental value . at this stage",
    "it is important to note that the experimental @xmath13 has been calculated by using the wiedemann - franz law and it shows a curvature at the higher temperature .",
    "however , calculated @xmath13 shows almost linear dependence .",
    "this deviation suggests the inadequacy of the wiedemann - franz law in understanding the temperature dependent behavior of the @xmath13 . above results",
    "clearly show the importance of two current model in understanding the temperature dependent behavior of the transport coefficients .",
    "it is also important to note that we have not considered the temperature dependent @xmath25 , thus the values of @xmath49 and @xmath13 are expected to be different at the higher temperature .",
    "the electronic and transport properties of the fe@xmath0cosi inverse heusler alloy are studied by combining the electronic band structure calculations with the boltzmann transport theory .",
    "the spin - unpolarized calculation shows a very large dos at the _ e@xmath1 _ and is unable to predict the correct temperature dependent behavior of the transport coefficients .",
    "the spin - polarized calculation provides @xmath15 25 times less dos at the _ e@xmath1 _ for the spin - up channel whereas there is almost zero dos in the spin - dn channel .",
    "fe atom at 4c wyckoff position shows large exchange splitting and contribute largely to the total magnetic moment .",
    "the s@xmath60 varies linearly while s@xmath61 shows non linear relation with the temperature .",
    "the @xmath62 decreases while @xmath63 increases non linearly with the temperature .",
    "the electronic thermal conductivity also found to increase with the increasing temperature for both the channels .",
    "the experimentally observed temperature dependent behavior of the compound is well explained by combining the transport coefficients of both the channels and considering different values of relaxation time .",
    "the room temperature values of s , @xmath49 and @xmath13 are 11 @xmath47vk@xmath48 , 19,000 @xmath50 and 14 @xmath51 , respectively and show good agreement with the experimental values .",
