    "plasma oscillations in heterostructures with a two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) and some devices using the excitation of these oscillations have been experimentally studied over decades ( see , for instance , refs .",
    "there are also many theoretical papers on different aspects of these plasma waves and their potential applications .",
    "the gated and ungated 2deg channels in heterostructures can serve as resonant cavities for terahertz ( thz ) electron plasma waves .",
    "@xcite the resonant properties of such channels can be utilized in different thz devices , in particular , resonant detectors .",
    "@xcite the mechanism of the thz detection observed in transistor structures  @xcite might be attributed to the nonlinearity of the plasma oscillations as suggested previously .",
    "@xcite the variation of the conductivity of 2deg with periodic gate system can be possibly explained by the heating of 2deg by absorbed thz radiation ( heating or bolometric mechanism ) .",
    "@xcite recently , a concept of resonant detectors in which a plasma resonant cavity is integrated with a schottky junction has been proposed and substantiated .",
    "@xcite as shown , when the frequency of incoming thz radiation is close to one of the plasma resonant frequencies , the ac potential drop across the barrier at the schottky junction becomes resonantly large .",
    "this leads to rather large values of the rectified component of the current through the junction , which is used as output signal of the detector .",
    "since the resonant excitation of the plasma oscillations by absorbed thz radiation leads to the heating of 2deg , the heating ( bolometric ) mechanism can also contribute to the rectified current over the schottky barrier .",
    "thus , two mechanisms can be responsible for the operation of this detector : the dynamic mechanism considered previously  @xcite and the heating mechanism .",
    "similar mechanisms can work in the detectors utilizing the excitation of plasma oscillations but having the barrier of another origin .",
    "in particular , the barrier formed by an additional gate which results in an essential depletion under it was used in recent experiments .",
    "@xcite in this paper , we develop a device model for a thz resonant detector based on a heterostructure with the 2deg channel and the barrier region utilizing the plasma oscillations excitation .",
    "we consider a device with three gates ( see fig .",
    "1 ) : the 2deg under two extreme gates forms the plasma resonant cavities , while the central gate , to which a sufficiently large negative bias voltage is applied , forms the barrier .",
    "the excitation of the plasma oscillations by the incident thz radiation is assumed to be associated with an antenna connected with the source and drain contacts to the 2deg channel . in the following we demonstrate that each of the mechanisms in question can dominate in different temperature ranges ( the dynamic mechanism is predominant at elevated temperatures , whereas the heating mechanism provides larger contribution at low temperatures , @xmath0  k ) .",
    "the device structure under consideration differs from that studied in ref .",
    "@xcite in which the thz radiation input was realized by a periodic grating",
    ". however , the physical mechanisms of detection are the same .",
    "we assume that the net drain - source voltage @xmath1 includes both the dc bias voltage @xmath2 and the ac component @xmath3 induced by incoming thz radiation via an antenna connected with the source and drain contacts .",
    "thus , @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the thz radiation frequency . the bias voltage @xmath6 is applied between the side gates and the pertinent contacts .",
    "this voltage affects the electron density in the quasi - neutral portions of the 2deg channel , so that the dc electron density is given by @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the electron charge , @xmath9 is the gate layer thickness , and @xmath10 is the dielectric constant . it is also taken to be that the potential drop , @xmath11 , between the central gate and the source contact is negative and its absolute value is sufficiently large to deplete some portion of the 2deg channel underneath this gate and create a potential barrier .",
    "this implies that @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the 2deg threshold voltage .",
    "the ac component of the electric potential in the channel @xmath14 satisfies the boundary conditions which follow from the fact that at the source and drain contacts its values coincide with the ac components of the incoming signal voltage : @xmath15 assuming that at the conductivity of the quasi - neutral sections is much larger than that of depletion region ( including the thermionic current over the barrier and the displacement current associated with the capacitances shown in the equivalent circuit of fig .",
    "1 ) one may use the following additional conditions : @xmath16 here @xmath17 is the length of the 2deg channel between the source and drain contacts , @xmath18 is the length of the depletion region under the central gate , and @xmath19 is the length of the latter ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "the quantity @xmath20 is determined by the potential of the central gate @xmath11 . definitely , the conductivity of the quasi - neutral sections markedly exceeds the real part of the depleted region admittance .",
    "the role of the displacement current across the depleted region is discussed in viii .",
    "the electron transport in the channel is governed by the hydrodynamic equations coupled with the poisson equation for the self - consistent electric potential  @xcite . at sufficiently small intensities of thz radiation",
    ", this system of equations can be linearized and reduced to the following equation  @xcite valid in the quasi - neutral regions of the channel ( @xmath21 and @xmath22 ) :    @xmath23    where @xmath24 is the frequency of electron collisions with impurities and phonons , @xmath25 is the plasma wave velocity , and @xmath26 is the electron effective mass .",
    "the effect of electron pressure results in some renormalization of the plasma wave velocity :  @xcite @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the velocity of the electron `` sound '' ( usually @xmath29 ) .",

    "the detector responsivity exhibits sharp resonant peaks at the frequencies of incoming thz radiation corresponding to the plasma resonances in the gated 2deg channel .",
    "the plasma resonances can tuned by the gate voltage @xmath11 and , to some extent , by the potential of the central gate @xmath11 .",
    "it is demonstrated that the dynamic mechanism dominates at elevated temperatures , whereas at low lattice temperatures ( @xmath115  k for algaas / gaas based detectors ) , the heating mechanism prevails .",
    "this can be attributed to a marked increase in the electron energy relaxation time @xmath59 with decreasing lattice temperature .    at rather low temperatures",
    "when the ratio @xmath160 is large , the thermionic electron current over the barrier can be surpassed by the tunneling current .",
    "the rectified portion of this current can be associated with both dynamic and heating mechanisms ( the thermo - assisted tunneling current in the case of the latter mechanism ) .",
    "this , however , requires a separate detailed study .    in the case of detection of thz radiation",
    "modulated at some frequency @xmath161 , the relative contributions of the dynamic and heating mechanisms to the responsivity , @xmath162 , characterising the detector response at the frequency @xmath163 can be different than those considered above .",
