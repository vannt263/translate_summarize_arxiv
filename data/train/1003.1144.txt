    "the averaged concentration is given by @xmath57 and the annual modulation of concentration is characterized by @xmath58 the rate of nuclear reactions of ohe with nuclei is proportional to the local concentration and the energy release in these reactions should lead to observable signal .",
    "there are two parts of the signal : the one determined by the constant part and annual modulation , which is concerned by the strategy of dark matter search in dama experiment @xcite .",
    "our explanation @xcite is based on the idea that ohe , slowed down in the matter of dama / nai or dama / libra detector , can form a few kev bound state with nucleus , in which ohe is situated * beyond * the nucleus .",

    "such level may not exist at all , or has other value of energy .",
    "the rate of reaction ( [ heeaz ] ) is proportional to temperature and suppressed in cryogenic detectors , making the comparison of their results with dama a nontrivial task .",
    "the approach of refs .   and assumes the following picture : at the distances larger , than its size , ohe is neutral and it feels only yukawa exponential tail of nuclear attraction , due to scalar - isoscalar nuclear potential . it should be noted that scalar - isoscalar nature of he nucleus excludes its nuclear interaction due to @xmath60 or @xmath61 meson exchange , so that the main role in its nuclear interaction outside the nucleus plays @xmath62 meson exchange , on which nuclear physics data are not very definite . when the distance from the surface of nucleus becomes smaller than the size of ohe , the mutual attraction of nucleus and ohe",
    "is changed by dipole coulomb repulsion .",

    "the spherically symmetric potential appears , given by @xmath63 here @xmath64 , @xmath65 are atomic weight and charge of helium , @xmath66 and @xmath67 are respectively atomic weight and charge of nucleus , @xmath68 and @xmath69 are the mass and coupling of scalar - isoscalar meson - mediator of nuclear attraction , @xmath70 is the size of ohe and @xmath71 is its electromagnetic formfactor , which strongly suppresses the strength of dipole electromagnetic interaction outside the ohe `` atom '' .    to simplify the solution of schrodinger equation the potential ( [ epot ] )",
    "was approximated in @xcite by a rectangular potential , presented on fig .",
    "[ pic23 ] .",
    "solutions of schrodinger equation for each of the four regions , indicated on fig .",
    "[ pic23 ] , are given in textbooks ( see e.g.@xcite ) and their sewing determines the condition , under which a low - energy ohe - nucleus bound state appears in the region iii .",
    "the energy of this bound state and its existence strongly depend on the parameters @xmath68 and @xmath69 of nuclear potential ( [ epot ] ) . on the fig .",
    "[ nai ] the region of these parameters , giving 2 - 6 kev energy level in ohe bound states with sodium and iodine are presented . in these calculations",
    "@xcite the mass of ohe was taken equal to @xmath72 .",
    "the rate of radiative capture of ohe by nuclei can be calculated with the use of the analogy with the radiative capture of neutron by proton with the account for : i ) absence of m1 transition that follows from conservation of orbital momentum and ii ) suppression of e1 transition in the case of ohe .",
    "since ohe is isoscalar , isovector e1 transition can take place in ohe - nucleus system only due to effect of isospin nonconservation , which can be estimated by factor @xmath73 , corresponding to relative mass difference of neutron and proton . in the result",
    "the rate of ohe radiative capture by nucleus with atomic number @xmath66 and charge @xmath67 to the energy level @xmath74 in the medium with temperature @xmath75 is given by @xmath76    formation of ohe - nucleus bound system leads to energy release of its binding energy , detected as ionization signal . in the context of our approach the existence of annual modulations of this signal in the range 2 - 6",
    "kev and absence of such effect at energies above 6 kev means that binding energy of na - ohe and i - ohe systems in dama experiment should not exceed 6 kev , being in the range 2 - 4 kev for at least one of these elements .",
    "the amplitude of annual modulation of ionization signal ( measured in counts per day per kg , cpd / kg ) is given by @xmath77 here @xmath78 is avogadro number , @xmath79 denotes na or i , @xmath80 ( corresponding to 1 kg of the matter of detector ) , @xmath81 , @xmath82 is the binding energy of na - ohe ( i - ohe ) system and @xmath46 is the local density of o - helium dark matter . the value of @xmath83 should be compared with the integrated over energy bins signals in dama / nai and dama / libra experiments and the result of these experiments can be reproduced e.g. for @xmath84 and @xmath85 .    at the corresponding values of @xmath68 and @xmath69 energy of ohe binding with other nuclei can strongly differ from 2 - 6 kev .",
    "in particular , energy release at the formation of ohe bound state with thallium can be larger than 6 kev .",
    "however , for the cross section of radiative capture of thallium by ohe , given by eq .",
    "( [ radcap ] ) and taking into account that thallium content in dama detector is 3 orders of magnitude smaller , than nai , such signal is below the experimental errors .    it should be noted that the results of dama experiment exhibit also absence of annual modulations at the energy of mev - tens mev .",
    "energy release in this range should take place , if ohe - nucleus system comes to the deep level inside the nucleus ( in the region i of fig .",
    "[ pic23 ] ) .",
    "this transition implies tunneling through dipole coulomb barrier and is suppressed below the experimental limits .",
    "the actual rate of these transitions is under our current study .",
    "since ohe capture rate is proportional to the temperature , it is suppressed in cryogenic detectors by a factor of order @xmath86 .",
    "the predicted effects of ohe radiative capture in different cryogenic detectors at @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 are given in table  [ ta1 ] .",
    "to conclude , the existence of heavy stable charged particles may not only be compatible with the experimental constraints but even lead to composite dark matter scenario of nuclear interacting warmer than cold dark matter .",
    "this new form of dark matter can provide explanation of excess of positron annihilation line radiation , observed by integral in the galactic bulge .",
    "the search for stable -2 charge component of cosmic rays is challenging for pamela and ams02 experiments .",
    "decays of heavy charged constituents of composite dark matter can provide explanation for anomalies in spectra of cosmic high energy positrons and electrons , observed by pamela , fermi and atic . in the context of our approach search for heavy stable charged quarks and leptons at lhc",
    "acquires the significance of experimental probe for components of cosmological composite dark matter .",
    "the results of dark matter search in experiments dama / nai and dama / libra can be explained in the framework of our scenario without contradiction with negative results of other groups .",
    "our approach contains distinct features , by which the present explanation can be distinguished from other recent approaches to this problem @xcite ( see also review and more references in ref .  ) .",
    "the proposed explanation is based on the mechanism of low energy binding of ohe with nuclei . within the uncertainty of nuclear physics parameters",
    "there exists a range at which ohe binding energy with sodium and/or iodine is in the interval 2 - 6 kev .",
    "radiative capture of ohe to this bound state leads to the corresponding energy release observed as an ionization signal in dama detector .",
    "ohe concentration in the matter of underground detectors is determined by the equilibrium between the incoming cosmic flux of ohe and diffusion towards the center of earth .",
    "it is rapidly adjusted and follows the change in this flux with the relaxation time of few minutes .",
    "therefore the rate of radiative capture of ohe should experience annual modulations reflected in annual modulations of the ionization signal from these reactions .    an inevitable consequence of the proposed explanation is appearance in the matter of dama / nai or dama / libra detector anomalous superheavy isotopes of sodium and/or iodine , having the mass roughly by @xmath19 larger , than ordinary isotopes of these elements .",
    "our results show that the ionization signal , detected by dama , is proportional to the temperature and should be suppressed in cryogenic detectors",
    ". therefore test of results of dama / nai and dama / libra experiments by other experimental groups can become a very nontrivial task , especially , in view of their rejection of electromagnetic part of counting rate in the absence of nuclear recoil .",
    "the presented approach sheds new light on the physical nature of dark matter .",
    "specific properties of composite dark matter and its constituents are challenging for their experimental search .",
    "ohe interaction with matter is an important aspect of these studies . in this context positive result of dama / nai and dama / libra experiments",
    "may be a signature for exciting phenomena of o - helium nuclear physics .",
