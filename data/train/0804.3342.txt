    "the behavior of the spin susceptibility at moderate to high temperatures remains almost unchanged when interchain couplings @xmath12 and @xmath13 are gradually introduced from single- to triple - chain models .",
    "this insensitivity of the susceptibility to the interchain couplings explains why initially tiocl was described as a good realization of a one - dimensional spin 1/2 system  @xcite since the experimental data could be perfectly fitted to a one - dimensional spin 1/2 heisenberg chain .",

    "after quantizing the lattice degrees of freedom by introducing the phonon creation and annihilation operators and integrating out the phonon degrees of freedom , an effective @xmath97-@xmath98 model is obtained , where @xmath99 and @xmath100 ( @xmath101 is the bare phonon frequency ) . since the ratio @xmath102  @xcite , non - adiabaticity will not affect the dimerization in tiocl ( in contrast to the situation in cugeo@xmath0  @xcite ) .",
