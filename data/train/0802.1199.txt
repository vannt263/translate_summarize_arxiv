    "it is well known that the ultimate origin of dissipation is the unavoidable interaction between a system and its surroundings . for quantum systems , a distinction is usually made between _ decay _ ,",
    "during which energy leaks into the environment , and _ decoherence _ , whereby correlations established with the surroundings rapidly wash - out any coherence between certain elements of the system @xcite .",
    "decoherence generally takes place on a much shorter timescale than decay , and this timescale is governed by the separation in phase - space of different components of the system density operator .",
    "however , for a single two - level atom , the timescale governing both decay and decoherence is related to the rate of spontaneous emission , which simplifies matters and thus makes this an ideal quantum system in which to study dissipative effects .",
    "the idea of using the surroundings to control atomic decay has been pursued ever since the first studies using nearby conducting surfaces and cavities @xcite and experimental control has now reached the point where an atom can be strongly - coupled to a cavity in which it is placed .",
    "this technological development has allowed for many useful applications of the atom - cavity interaction , including the generation of entanglement @xcite , creation of number states of the electromagnetic field @xcite and photons on demand @xcite , observation of quantum jumps of the electromagnetic field @xcite and experimental tests of non - locality @xcite among many others @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , interaction with the environment is traditionally seen as a negative feature since this is the root - cause of dissipation and there is currently a huge theoretical and experimental effort aimed at controlling dissipative effects in cavity quantum optics .",
    "one way to achieve this goal is to limit the extent of the system - environment coupling , although ultimately this will always still prevail at some level .",
    "another promising approach is to exploit certain symmetries in the system - environment coupling , so as to confine the dynamics to a ( decoherence - free ) subspace of the overall hilbert space in which dissipative effects cancel out @xcite . a third method , and the approach we shall pursue here , is to dynamically modify the system s surroundings so as to control the _ effects _ of the dissipative couplings rather than reducing their magnitude @xcite .",
    "the use of dynamically engineered reservoirs to control dissipation is appealing , since this technique is non - invasive and furthermore does not require individual components of the system to be addressed separately .    to the lowest order of approximation ,",
    "an atom s environment consists simply of the electromagnetic field modes into which it can emit .",
    "we should therefore expect that changing some property of _ all _ of these modes should affect the process of atomic decay , and these effects are well documented @xcite .",
    "it is less clear what will happen in the more subtle case where the properties of individual modes are altered , but in a controlled way , such that , for example , the combined effect is to keep all macroscopic reservoir structure static in time . it is tempting to think that this type of manipulation might only produce observable effects in strongly - coupled atom - cavity systems , since it is only the memory kernel for the atom - bath interaction which changes and is dynamically modified under this model .",
    "however , it has recently been shown ( in ref .",
    "@xcite for a linear increase of all reservoir frequencies ) that this form of reservoir manipulation can be used to control the rate of spontaneous emission for both strong and also weak atom - reservoir coupling .    in the current paper",
    "we investigate the case of an oscillatory manipulation of all reservoir mode frequencies and coupling strengths .",
    "this can be achieved by modifying the length of a cavity , and hence the mode frequencies , in an oscillatory way , ( further details are given in section [ observable_effects ] of this article ) . from a practical perspective",
    ", an oscillating mode - structure has several advantages over a linear chirp of the reservoir frequencies : ( i ) piezoelectric actuators used to modify the cavity length typically perform favourably in an oscillatory regime ; ( ii ) the required changes in the cavity length are periodic and do not grow large at long times , unlike in the linear - chirp case .",
    "the remainder of the article is arranged as follows . in section [ general_dynamic_environment ] ,",
    "the mathematical model is introduced and some general observations are made regarding the applicability of dynamic environments to the control of decoherence and decay . in section [ dynamic_res_model ] , the detailed form of the microscopic reservoir structure",
    "is given for an _ oscillatory modulation _ of the reservoir mode frequencies and closed - form expressions for the atomic decay rate and emission spectrum are derived .",
    "these results are tested against numerical simulations in section [ sinusoidal_example ] for the specific case of a sinusoidal modulation of the bath mode frequencies .",
    "a particular physical realisation of the model and the potential size of observable effects are examined in detail in section [ observable_effects ] .",
    "it is found that our scheme can give rise to a surprisingly large reduction in the rate of dissipation and that the method studied here compares favourably with other , more basic reservoir manipulations studied previously ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "finally , in section [ conclusions ] we conclude our findings .",
    "we consider a two - level atom with transition frequency @xmath0 and lower and upper states @xmath1 and @xmath2 , coupled to a zero - temperature bath of electromagnetic field modes , which together constitute a reservoir for the atomic decay .",
    "the reservoir is engineered so that the individual bath mode frequencies @xmath3 and also the coupling @xmath4 between the atomic transition @xmath5 and the @xmath6 mode of the radiation field are _ time - dependent_. we initially consider a discrete bath . without loss of generality ,",
    "all couplings are chosen to be real , since any time - dependent phase in the coupling @xmath4 can be transferred onto the time - dependence of the corresponding mode frequency @xmath3 and as usual , constant phase terms can be absorbed into the basis states .",
    "the hamiltonian for the composite atom - reservoir system in the rotating - wave approximation ( with @xmath7 ) is : @xmath8 with raising and lowering operators and . due to the oscillation of the cavity",
    ", individual mode - frequencies may pass through resonance on a timescale which is very rapid from the point - of - view of the atom and may even be much shorter than the bath correlation time .",
    "however , we note that in any practical setting , the rate of change of reservoir mode frequencies is never fast enough to create photons in the reservoir by itself ( in the sense of refs .",
    "thus , the cavity field will adiabatically follow the motion of its end - mirror , and so the bath creation and annihilation operators , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , depend only on the index @xmath11 ( not explicitly on time ) .",
    "it is convenient to move to an interaction picture , in which the effect of the first two terms in equation ( [ hamiltonian ] ) are factored into the energy basis states . in this",

    "dynamically modulating the microscopic properties of a reservoir can only have an observable effect if the system - reservoir coupling is a structured function of frequency .",
    "however , we note that the requirement of a structured reservoir is not synonymous with strong coupling between the system and its environment , since the distinction between strong coupling , reservoir structure and non - markovian dynamics is more subtle for dynamic reservoirs than the usual static case .",
    "( for further details see @xcite . )",
    "having established that the use of dynamic environments requires the system - reservoir coupling to be spectrally dependent , we now turn to the specific form that this dependence will take . in order to isolate the novel effects associated with dynamically structured reservoirs , we choose to investigate a model for which the _ macroscopic _ properties of the reservoir remain fixed .",

    "the envelope of the coupling strengths can be kept static .",

    "the envelope of the couplings remains the same as the reservoir mode frequencies vary in time .",

    "the lorentzian reservoir structure ensures exponential decay of atomic population .",
    "equation ( [ rho_g_squared ] ) describes both the time - dependent coupling of a single bath mode , @xmath3 , and also the instantaneous coupling between the atom and the whole bath of modes at time @xmath29 .",
    "since this structure has no explicit dependence on @xmath29 ( i.e. only the implicit time - dependence contained in @xmath3 ) the envelope of these couplings is fixed in time ; as in the static case , the atom always has some resonant modes with which it can exchange a photon but these are now different bath modes at different times .",
    "we note that the weight , @xmath38 , of the lorentzian , which is defined through the relation @xmath39 also remains static in time with this choice of couplings .",

    "in either case , the coupling strengths @xmath127 are static and do not compensate for the changing mode - frequencies and this has the effect of dynamically modulating the macroscopic atom - reservoir detuning .",
    "such variable - detuning models have been well studied ( see for example @xcite ) and in the weak - coupling limit the atomic decay - rate is given by @xcite : @xmath128 in the ultrafast modulation limit considered in section [ ultrafast ] , equation ( [ gamma_janowicz ] ) simplifies to @xmath129 somewhat surprisingly , in the limit of ultrafast frequency modulation , the decay - rate @xmath130 is _ always greater than _ the equivalent decay rate @xmath57 given in equation ( [ analytic_ours ] ) for the same frequency modulation and depth",
    ". therefore a more effective suppression of the atomic decay - rate can be achieved by keeping the atom and reservoir on - resonance rather than dynamically changing the detuning .",

    "this is a monotonically decreasing function of @xmath133 , and always less than 1 . providing that the modulation frequency is high enough , it is possible to achieve high values of @xmath133 whilst still satisfying @xmath134 .",
    "experimental verification of the predictions made above may be achieved with currently available technology and without great difficulties .",
    "first we take an optical atomic transition with angular frequency and a 40 @xmath135 m inner cavity for which @xcite , whilst for the outer cavity we let @xmath136 1 cm . assuming that the end - mirror is driven sinusoidally by a piezoelectric actuator , with frequency @xmath137mhz and an amplitude @xmath138 nm , the ratio @xmath139 is achieved and the resulting decay rate , @xmath57 is four times lower than for a variable - detuning model .    for microwave systems",
    ", we consider an atomic transition with frequency and a 2 cm inner cavity for which @xcite , whilst for the outer cavity we let @xmath140 cm . in this case , a frequency @xmath141mhz and an amplitude @xmath142 nm , gives so the heirachy given in equation ( [ high_omega_osc ] ) can be made to hold very strongly .",
    "the resulting inhibition of the decay - rate ( equation ( [ f(x ) ] ) ) is ; decay into the cavity field mode is effectively ` switched - off ' in this limit .",
    "we have studied how the process of spontaneous emission may be controlled by dynamically manipulating the microscopic structure of an atom s environment . while is it well known that changing the structure of an atom s surroundings ( by introducing nearby conducting surfaces or a cavity , for example ) can alter the process of spontaneous emission , in this article we have considered a model for which the macroscopic reservoir - structure _ does not _ change with time . instead",
    ", the individual electromagnetic field - modes which make up the reservoir are assigned time - dependent frequencies and time - dependent couplings to the atom . in this way , the atom and reservoir always remain on resonance but the atom interacts with different bath - modes at different times ; by manipulating the environment in this manner it is possible to control the memory - kernel for the atomic state and hence to control the atomic decay - rate .    in order for such a scheme to work , we must be able to alter the reservoir - structure on a timescale which is shorter than the static - bath correlation time .",
    "therefore , it is essential that the system - bath couplings are frequency - dependent , as shown in section [ general_dynamic_environment ] .",
    "although essential , this frequency - dependence may be very weak , and in section [ dynamic_res_model ] we show that it is possible to control the atomic decay - rate even in the case of weak atom - reservoir coupling ( as well as in the strong - coupling limit ",
    "see @xcite ) . in subsection [ atomic_decay_rates ]",
    "the atomic decay - rate is calculated for the case of a periodic manipulation of all reservoir mode - frequencies .",
    "a floquet analysis is applied and after analysing the final occupation - spectrum ( in subsection [ reservoir_occupation_osc ] ) , we find that the atomic decay only occurs into a discrete collection of reservoir - sidebands , each of which satisfies a dynamic resonance condition with the atom .",
    "the total atomic decay - rate is a structured function of the modulation - depth and modulation - frequency and exhibits a peak whenever one of the reservoir sidebands is resonant with the atom for a significant fraction of each modulation cycle .",
    "section [ sinusoidal_example ] treats the specific case of a sinusoidal modulation of all reservoir mode - frequencies and the general expressions derived in section [ dynamic_res_model ] are found to be in excellent agreement with numerical simulations .",
    "of particular interest is the limit of ultrafast modulation , studied in subsection [ ultrafast ] , for which compact analytic expressions are derived .    in section [ observable_effects ]",
    "the observable effects of the model are considered . in order to emphasise how strong the suppression of decay may be in the limit of ultrafast modulation",
    ", a second model is introduced in subsection [ variable_detuning ] for which the atom - reservoir detuning is modulated sinusoidally . upon first inspection , it may appear that this second reservoir manipulation should give rise to a more dramatic inhibition of the atomic decay , since in this case the atom and reservoir spend a large proportion of each cycle away from resonance .",
    "however , a detailed analysis shows that the dynamical suppression of decay studied in sections [ dynamic_res_model ] and [ sinusoidal_example ] is a far more potent method for inhibiting dissipation than a straightforward atom - bath detuning .",
    "physical realisations for both of these types of dynamic environment are proposed in subsection [ double_cavity_system ] ( also , more details are given in @xcite ) .",
    "finally , in subsection [ size_effects ] , we show that it should be possible to observe all of the effects predicted above using currently available technology .",
