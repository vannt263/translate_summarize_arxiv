    "the quest to verify the most basic laws of nature , and then to search for deviations from them , is an ongoing challenge at the frontier of precision metrology . to this end",
    ", high resolution spectroscopy experiments have made significant contributions over the years .",
    "for example , the coupling strengths and transition energies between atomic and molecular levels are predominantly determined by the electromagnetic interaction .",
    "however , the standard model does include fundamental processes , e.g.  the weak interaction  @xcite , which have spectroscopic signatures that are both theoretically calculable and experimentally detectable .",
    "parity - violating transition amplitudes , forbidden by the electromagnetic interaction but allowed in the presence of the weak interaction , have been calculated and measured in atomic cesium  @xcite and ytterbium  @xcite with sufficient precision to test electroweak theory at the @xmath1 level .",
    "in addition , high - resolution molecular spectroscopy experiments are underway to probe parity violation in chiral polyatomic molecules  @xcite and to probe nuclear spin - dependent parity violation in diatomic molecules  @xcite . looking outside of the standard model , precision molecular spectroscopy experiments",
    "have been designed to search for time - variation of fundamental constants , such as the electron - to - proton mass ratio  @xcite and the fine structure constant  @xcite , as well as to search for simultaneous parity and time - reversal symmetry violation in the form of permanent electric dipole moments ( edms )  @xcite .    in most cases ,",
    "atoms and molecules that are either neutral or ionic can be studied in an effort to observe the same underlying physics ; however , typically there are technical advantages to selecting one system over the other . systems of neutral , as opposed to ionic , particles are attractive for precision spectroscopic studies due to the relative ease of constructing high - flux neutral particle beams , the relatively weak interactions between neutral particles , and the lack of coupling between the translational motion of neutral particles and external electromagnetic fields .",
    "conversely , charged particles are favored due to the relative ease of constructing ion traps and the long interrogation times that come with studying trapped particles . indeed , some of the most stringent tests of the standard model have been performed using trapped ions  @xcite , and spectroscopy on trapped molecular ions is of fundamental interest for studying interstellar chemistry  @xcite . looking to combine the techniques of ion trapping and high - resolution molecular spectroscopy , several research groups are working to develop experimental platforms for studying ensembles of trapped molecular ions  @xcite .",
    "the additional degrees - of - freedom afforded to molecular systems , in comparison with simple atomic systems , provide additional interaction mechanisms and correspondingly more routes for experimental investigation .",
    "for example , molecular levels are inherently more sensitive to applied electric fields due to the presence of nearby states of opposite parity , e.g.  rotational levels and/or @xmath2-doublet levels . on the surface",
    ", this means that the stark shifts observed in molecular spectra will be significantly larger than the corresponding shifts to atomic transitions .",
    "more fundamentally , this means that in relative weak electric fields the quantum eigenstates of an atomic system are still dominated by a _",
    "parity eigenstate , while the quantum eigenstates of molecular systems asymptotically approach an _ equal admixture _ of even and odd parity eigenstates .",
    "there are several classes of atomic and molecular symmetry violation experiments where larger stark mixing amplitudes give rise to larger signals .",
    "for example , the parity violation signals already attained in atomic systems  @xcite are expected to be exceeded by the next - generation of experiments using polarized diatomic molecules  @xcite .",
    "similarly , in experiments designed to search for permanent electric dipole moments , the expected signal size scales with the ability to thoroughly mix parity eigenstates and increases dramatically when going from atoms to diatomic molecules  @xcite .    herein lies the conundrum for symmetry violation searches using trapped molecular ions : the electric field required to fully polarize the molecules will interfere with the electromagnetic fields necessary for trapping the ions with the likely result of accelerating the ions out of the trap .",
    "our solution to this problem is to apply an electric field that rotates at radio frequencies . under these conditions ,",
    "the ions will still accelerate , however they will undergo circular motion similar to charged particles in a penning trap  @xcite or storage ring  @xcite .",
    "the nuances of performing high - resolution electron spin resonance spectroscopy in this environment will be the main focus of this work , with the ultimate goal of demonstrating that such an experiment on the valence electrons in a ground or metastable @xmath0 level could prove to be a sensitive probe for a permanent electron electric dipole moment ( eedm ) .",
    "the powerful techniques of spin resonance spectroscopy , as applied to electrons , muons , nuclei , and atoms , have made possible exquisitely precise measurements of electric and magnetic dipole moments .",
    "these measurements in turn represent some of the most stringent tests of existing theory , as well as some of the most sensitive probes for new particle physics . as an example , the recent improved measurement of the electron s magnetic moment  @xcite agrees with the predictions  @xcite of quantum electrodynamics out to four - loop corrections . compared to the electron work , muonic g-2 measurements  @xcite",
    "are less accurate but are nonetheless more sensitive ( due to the muon s greater mass ) to physics beyond the standard model .",
    "digging a new - physics signal out of the muon g-2 measurement is made difficult by uncertainty in the hadronic contributions to the standard model prediction  @xcite .",
    "one of the primary motivations for experimental searches for electric dipole moments ( edm ) is the absence of such standard model backgrounds to complicate the interpretation of these studies . in the case of the electron , for example",
    ", the standard model predicts an electric dipole moment less than @xmath3  e cm  @xcite .",
    "the natural scale of the electron electric dipole moment ( eedm ) predicted by supersymmetric models is @xmath4 to @xmath5  e cm  @xcite ( table  [ t : predictions ] ) .",
    "the current experimental limit is @xmath6  e cm  @xcite .",
    "with predictions of new physics separated by nine orders of magnitude from those of `` old '' physics , and with the current experimental situation such that a factor - of - ten improvement in sensitivity would carve deeply into the predictions of supersymmetry , an improved measurement of the eedm is a tempting experimental goal . in this paper we will describe an ongoing experiment that we believe will be able to improve on the existing experimental upper limit for an eedm by a factor of thirty in a day of integration time .",

    "we shall assume a total nuclear spin of @xmath23 , the nuclear spin of fluorine or hydrogen .",
    "this leads to the values @xmath24 and @xmath25 for the states of experimental interest .",
    "in selecting a molecular ion for this experiment we have several criteria .",
    "first , we want a simple spectrum . ideally , we would like the supersonic expansion to be able to cool the molecules into a single internal quantum state so that every trapped molecule could contribute to the contrast of the spectroscopic transition . failing that , we want to minimize the partition function by using a molecule with a large rotational constant , most likely a diatomic molecule with one of its atoms being relatively light . small or vanishing nuclear spin is to be preferred , as are atoms with only one abundant isotope .",
    "second , we need to be able to make the molecule .",
    "this requirement favors more deeply bound molecules and is the main reason we anticipate working with fluorides rather than hydrides .",
    "third , the molecule should be polarizable with a small applied electric field , i.e.it should have a relatively small @xmath2-doublet splitting , @xmath26 .",
    "fourth , and most important , the molecule should have unpaired electron spin that experiences a large value of @xmath27 .",
    "these latter two requirements would appear to be mutually exclusive : a small @xmath2-doublet splitting requires a large electronic orbital angular momentum , which prohibits good overlap with the nucleus required for a large @xmath27 .",
    "fortunately , working with two valance electrons in a triplet state allows us to satisfy our needs .",
    "one valance electron can carry a large orbital angular momentum making the molecule easily polarizable , while the other can carry zero orbital angular momentum giving it good overlap with the nucleus and generating a large @xmath27 .",
    "this concept was detailed by some of us in ref .",
    "@xcite and for the @xmath28 state of interest here , the two valance electrons occupy molecular @xmath29 and @xmath30 orbitals . our calculations , as well as those of ref .",
    "@xcite , indicate that in the @xmath28 state of thf@xmath8 and hff@xmath8 we should expect @xmath31  khz with @xmath32  gv / cm for thf@xmath8 and @xmath33  gv / cm for hff@xmath8  @xcite .",
    "we mention one final valuable feature we look for in a candidate molecule : a small magnetic g - factor , so as to reduce the vulnerability to decoherence and systematic errors arising from magnetic fields . to the extent that spin - orbit mixing does not mix other @xmath34 states into a nominally @xmath28 molecular level",
    ", it will have a very small magnetic moment , a feature shared by pbf in the @xmath36 state  @xcite .",
    "this is because @xmath37 , and because the spin g - factor is @xmath382 times the orbital g - factor . under these conditions",
    ", the contributions of the electronic spin and orbital angular momentum to the net molecular magnetic dipole moment nominally cancel . in hff@xmath8 ,",
    "the magnetic moment of a stretched magnetic sublevel level of the @xmath39 rotational ground state is about @xmath40 .",
    "this is a factor of 20 less than the magnetic moment of ground state atomic cesium . in the @xmath41 level , on the other hand , the magnetic moment in the stretched zeeman level is @xmath42",
    ". the @xmath43 state may nonetheless be of scientific interest .",
    "the @xmath28 and @xmath41 levels have @xmath27 equal in magnitude but opposite in sign . if one could accurately measure the science signal , @xmath44 , in the @xmath41 level despite its larger sensitivity to magnetic field background ( and despite its shorter spontaneous - decay lifetime ) , the comparison with the @xmath28 result would allow one to reject many systematic errors .      since we have not made a final decision as to which molecule we will use , and",
    "also because we have yet to measure the hyperfine constants of our candidate molecules , the discussion of level schemes in this section will be qualitative in nature , usually emphasizing general properties shared by all the molecules we are investigating . to simplify the discussion",
    ", we will specialize to discussing spectroscopy within the @xmath46 rotational manifold of a molecular @xmath28 level .    for hunds case ( a ) molecular levels with @xmath47",
    ", each rotational level is a @xmath2-doublet , that is , it consists of two closely spaced levels of opposite parity .",
    "we can think of the even ( odd ) parity level as the symmetric ( antisymmetric ) superposition of the electronic angular momentum lying predominantly parallel and antiparallel to the molecular axis [ fig .",
    "[ f : hyperfine_stutz](a ) ] .",
    "the parity doublet is split by the @xmath2-doubling energy @xmath26 .",
    "a polar diatomic molecule will have a permanent electric dipole moment , @xmath48 , aligned along the internuclear axis @xmath49 , but in states of good parity , there will be vanishing expectation value @xmath50 in the lab frame . an applied laboratory electric field , @xmath51 , will act on @xmath52 to mix the states of good parity . in the limit of @xmath53 , energy eigenstates will have nonvanishing @xmath50 in the lab frame .",
    "more to the point , @xmath16 , a signed quantity given by the projection of the electron angular momentum on the molecular axis , @xmath54 , can also have a nonzero expectation value [ fig .",
    "[ f : hyperfine_stutz](b ) ] .",
    "heuristically , it is the large electric fields developed internal to the molecule , along @xmath49 , that gives rise to the large value of @xmath27 that the electron spin can experience in polar molecules . in the absence of the @xmath2-doublet mechanism for polarizing the molecule ,",
    "a much larger field would be necessary , @xmath55 , to mix rotational states with splitting typically twice the rotational constant @xmath56 .",
    "for hff@xmath8 , we estimate @xmath26 will be @xmath57  khz , whereas @xmath56 will be about @xmath57  ghz . for a dipole moment @xmath58  d ,",
    "mixing the @xmath2-doublet levels will take a field well under 1  v / cm , whereas `` brute force '' mixing of rotational levels would require around 10  kv / cm .",
    "for an experiment on trapped ions , the smaller electric fields are essential .    in the context of their eedm experiment on the @xmath59 level in pbo , demille and",
    "his colleagues have explored in some detail  @xcite the convenient features of an @xmath60 state , especially with respect to the suppression of systematic error .",
    "our proposal liberally borrows from those ideas . in a molecule with at least one high - z atom",

    "[ f : hyperfine_stutz ] we present the @xmath28 , j = 1 state with hyperfine splitting due to the fluorine i=1/2 nucleus . a key feature is the existence of two near - identical pairs of @xmath22-levels with opposite parity . as seen in fig .  [",

    "if we measure the resonant frequency for the transition indicated by the solid ( or dashed ) line once before and once after inverting the direction of the magnetic field , time reversal invariance tells us the difference between the two measurements should be zero . in the presence of an eedm , which violates time - reversal invariance ,",
    "this energy difference @xmath67 will give @xmath68 .",

    "[ f : hyperfine_stutz](b ) , the geometric phase factor can be written as @xmath667 , where @xmath101 is the solid angle subtended by the contour on the unit sphere traced out by the time - varying quantization axis .",
    "thus , the relative phase generated between the @xmath668 states used for spectroscopy is @xmath669 .",
    "the concern of this subsection is how ion - ion collisions cause uncontrolled excursions of the quantization axis leading to random geometric phase shifts and decoherence between spin states .",
    "these uncontrolled phase shifts will be written as @xmath670 to distinguish them from the calibrated geometric phases in the experiment .",
    "the instantaneous quantization axis for the molecular ion eigensates is defined by the net electric field vector at the location of the ion . during a collision",
    ", this axis is defined by the vector sum of the rotating electric field , @xmath671 , and the ion - ion interaction electric field , @xmath672 .",
    "both of these are time - varying vectors , however typical ion - ion collisions have a duration short compared to the rotation period of @xmath51 so for the purpose of this discussion @xmath51 will be taken as stationary .",
    "thus , the problem is reduced to calculating the excursion of the quantization axis under the time variation of @xmath659 .",
    "a typical ion - ion collision is shown in fig .",
    "[ f : collision](a ) and the effect of this collision on the quantization axis is shown in fig .",
    "[ f : collision](b ) .    at the temperatures of our trapped ion samples , no two ions are ever close enough for the details of the intermolecular potential to matter . only monopole - monopole and monopole - dipole interactions matter .",
    "further , the translational degree of freedom may be treated as purely classical motion in a @xmath673 ion - ion potential , with the initial condition of a given collisional event characterized by an impact parameter and relative velocity .",
    "the outcome of the collision depends not only on the magnitudes of the impact parameter and of the velocity , but also on their angles with respect to the ambient electric bias field , @xmath51 .",
    "each initial condition contributes a particular amount to the variance in the phase between the relevant internal states .",
    "these contributions can be converted to partial contributions to a decoherence rate , and a numerical integral over a thermal distribution of collisional initial conditions can yield the total decoherence rate .",
    "we have pursued this program to a greater or lesser extent with the decoherence mechanisms discussed in this subsection and the one immediately following , but the results are not especially illuminating and we have used them primarily to confirm that the power - law expressions discussed below represent only overestimates of the decoherence rate , and that for experimental parameters of interest , the decoherence rate will be conservatively less than 1  s@xmath589 .",
    "the main question is whether @xmath294 is high enough to include significant phase space for collision trajectories for which the peak value of @xmath674 ( which is to say , large enough to transiently tip the direction of the total field by more than a radian ) .",
    "if so , then a single collision can cause decoherence and one can get a simple estimate of the cross - section for decoherence simply from the size of the impact parameter that leads to those events .",
    "there is a significant probability for collisions with @xmath675 when @xmath676 which leads to a decoherence rate @xmath677    if @xmath294 is instead so low that the coulomb barrier suppresses collisions that could lead to a sufficiently large value of @xmath101 and cause decoherence with a single collision , then decoherence will arise only from the combined effects of many collisions each causing small phase shifts that eventually random walk the science transition into decoherence .",
    "in this regime , the decoherence rate falls off very fast at low temperatures .",
    "for @xmath678 typical collisions have @xmath679 and the decoherence rate is @xmath680    both eqs .",
    "[ e : hightdecoherencerate ] and [ e : lowtdecoherencerate ] represent conservative estimates of the decoherence rate , and for an intermediate range of temperature , the decoherence rate will be less than whichever estimate gives the smaller value ( fig .  [",
    "f : taucoll ] ) .    , due to geometric phases accumulated during ion - ion collisions as a function of ( a ) collision energy in temperature units and ( b ) @xmath51 .",
    "dotted lines are approximations given in eqs .",
    "[ e : hightdecoherencerate ] and [ e : lowtdecoherencerate ] .",
    "solid lines are more involved estimates based on integrals over collision parameters , but are still based on approximations so as to be conservative .",
    "the ion density was taken to be @xmath681  @xmath682.[f : taucoll ] ]      a second source of decoherence can arise from ion - ion collisions that induce transitions between internal levels of a molecule .",
    "the dominant inelastic channel will be transitions between @xmath22 levels induced by a sufficiently sudden tilt in the quantization axis defined by the instantaneous local electric field .",
    "there are two conditions for such a transition to occur : ( i ) the direction of the total field must change by nearly a radian or more , so that there is significant amplitude for , e.g. , an @xmath684 level in the unperturbed electric field to suddenly have non - negligible projection on an @xmath685 level in the collision - perturbed field , and ( ii ) the time rate of change of the electric field direction must be comparable to or larger than the energy splitting between an @xmath686 level and its nearest @xmath687 level in the field @xmath51 .",
    "note that the first requirement is the same as the requirement for picking up an appreciable single collision berry s phase .",
    "however , not all collisions that satisfy the first requirement will satisfy the second requirement .",
    "in particular , if the relative velocity in a collision is too low , then the time rate of change of the electric field direction will be too slow to satisfy the second requirement .",
    "thus , given that the first requirement is satisfied , then the second requirement will _ not _ be satisfied when @xmath688 in this limit , the second requirement is more stringent than the first requirement , which means that the rate of @xmath683-level changing collisions will be smaller than the rate of single - collision berry s phase - induced decoherence . in the opposite limit , we expect the second requirement will be met whenever the first requirement is met , and thus we would expect that the two channels of decoherence , @xmath683-level changing and single - collision berry s phase , will be comparable in magnitude .    looking at particular collision trajectories in more detail , we see that there are trajectories that can cause an @xmath683-level change but for which there is no contribution to berry s phase because the electric field traces out a trajectory with no solid angle ( for instance , if the classical impact parameter @xmath689 is parallel to @xmath671 )",
    ". we also note that our formulation of the requirement of sweep rate for @xmath683-level changing collisions neglects the fact that @xmath659 will not only change the direction of the total electric field ( @xmath690 ) but also in general will change its magnitude . for most impact parameters ,",
    "the magnitude of the total electric field will increase , thus suppressing nonadiabatic effects .",
    "however , a narrow range of impact parameters exists where the magnitude of the total electric field decreases , thus enhancing nonadiabatic effects .",
    "however , the above scaling laws account for the majority of collisions .    in the end , we are less interested in the actual rates than we are in putting conservative limits on decoherence rates . for instance , in calculating the curves in fig .  [",
    "f : taucoll ] , we pessimistically took a worst - case geometry , @xmath691 , which gives an upper limit on the size of the effect .",
    "thus we estimate that :    * for @xmath692 the _ total _ collisional decoherence , including both @xmath683-level - changing and berrys - inducing effects , will be less than or equal to the value given by solid curves in fig .",
    "[ f : taucoll ] , while * for @xmath693 , the _ total _ collisional decoherence will be no greater than twice as large as the rate indicated by those curves .",
    "recall from sec .  [ s : intro ] the three components to the sensitivity figure - of - merit :      conclusions of sec .  [ s : spectroscopy ] and  [ s : collisions ] : taking into account only collisional decoherence , and all the questions associated with being in rotating fields and in trapping fields , we would anticipate a coherence time longer than one second .",
    "black - body thermal excitation of the j=1 rotational level will also be well over one second .",
    "vibrational black - body excitation for the v=0 state is estimated at 6 s for hff@xmath8 in a 300 k environment .",
    "thus the dominant limitation to coherence will likely be the radiative lifetime of the @xmath28 state , estimated  @xcite at 390 ms for hff@xmath8 , and still longer for thf@xmath8 , for which the @xmath28 state is predicted to be still lower in energy .",
    "the largest uncertainty in the lifetime calculation is the uncertainty in the @xmath694 @xmath695 decay energy , calculated to be 1600 @xmath86 in hff@xmath8 .",
    "@xmath625 in hff@xmath8 is calculated by meyer and coworkers to be 30  gv / cm  @xcite , and by titov _",
    "_ to be 24  gv / cm  @xcite . for thf@xmath8",
    ", meyer calculates 90  gv / cm  @xcite .",
    "the uncertainties in these numbers are hard to assess , but they are very likely accurate to better than a factor of two and , if ongoing spectroscopic studies provide experimental values of hyperfine and fine structure that confirm the ab initio values predicted by the st .",
    "petersburg group , our confidence in the precision of calculated @xmath625 will be much higher .",
    "we are producing hff@xmath8 ions by photoionization in a relatively narrow range of quantum states , and can estimate yield per quantum level within the desired trapping volume at perhaps 100 ions per shot , but we have just begun to characterize the efficiency of the process and very little optimization has been done .",
    "our design efficiency for reading out spin states of trapped ions via laser - induced fluorescence ( lif ) is 4% , but that has not been verified yet . with a large uncertainty ,",
    "then , we may detect about one ion per shot with four shots per second .",
    "overall , precision in one hour could be about 10 mhz . for ten hours of data ,",
    "we anticipate ( very roughly ) a raw precision at @xmath696 e  cm in hff@xmath8 , and @xmath697 e  cm in thf@xmath8 .",
    "we are investigating several more efficient alternatives to lif for spin readout , including in particular resonantly enhanced photodissociation or second photoionization .",
    "even if we detect as many as four ions in a shot , single shot precision will be no better than 300 mhz , which sets a relaxed requirement for suppressing experimental shot - to - shot noise .",
    "we have not completed a systematic study of the consequences of all possible violations of reflection symmetry in the trapping fields , but work in this direction is ongoing .    for",
    "now , we make the following three observations :    \\i ) for the field asymmetries we have analyzed to date , realistic estimates for the magnitude in as - constructed field imperfections lead to systematic errors on the order of a few 10@xmath698 e cm or less .",
    "while this is not yet as accurate as our ultimate ambitions , it would represent roughly a factor of thirty improvement on the existing best experimental limit .",
    "\\ii ) asymmetries analyzed to date lead to systematic errors whose signs reverse when the direction of rotation @xmath445 reverses .",
    "if we combine measurements made with clockwise and counterclockwise field rotation , the errors vanish .",
    "ideally , we d like to design sufficient accuracy into the experiment so that the chop in field rotation is not needed to achieve desired accuracy , but as a practical matter we will of course run the experiment both ways , averaging the results to get ultimate accuracy , and differencing them to diagnose experimental flaws .",
    "\\iii ) auxiliary measurements are envisioned to characterize and shim out flaws in the as - constructed trap .",
    "for instance , we plan to be able to shim the equilibrium position of the ion cloud up and down along the trap axis , and at each location measure the energy difference e@xmath699-e@xmath700 .",
    "unlike e@xmath701-e@xmath699 , e@xmath699-e@xmath700 is highly electric - field sensitive .",
    "the result will be a precise measurement of any spatial gradient in @xmath62 .",
    "\\iv ) all systematic errors we have analyzed to date have strong dependencies on quantities such as @xmath445 , @xmath444 , @xmath62 , and on the ion - cloud temperature and density , and the trap confining frequencies .",
    "a true signal from a nonzero value of d@xmath652 will be largely independent of all those quantities .",
    "we anticipate making a number of auxiliary measurements with the experimental parameters tuned far away from their optimal values to deliberately exaggerate the size of systematic errors and allow us thus to characterize their dependencies in less integration time than that required for ultimate sensitivity .",
    "even so , and as is often the case in precision measurement experiments , sensitivity and accuracy are coupled . to the extent we can measure d@xmath652 to high precision at many combinations of experimental parameters , we will better be able to detect and reject false signals .",
    "we believe the experiment as we have described it should have the capability to improve the limit on the electron s electric dipole moment to 10@xmath698 e cm . as of this writing , the largest contribution to the uncertainty in our ultimate capability has to do with unknown efficiencies of state preparation and read out .",
    "more specialized publications from our group addressing progress in these areas are forthcoming .      until now",
    ", molecular ions have not been viable candidates for symmetry violation searches largely due to the fact that applying electromagnetic fields to manipulate the internal states of the molecule would also violently perturb the translational motion of the ions . in this work ,",
