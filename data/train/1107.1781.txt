    "in the last decade remarkable experiments were performed involving measurements and manipulations of states for a single or several nanoscopic josephson junctions which were consistently interpreted in terms of two - level quantum systems [ 1 - 5 ] .",
    "low - capacitance josephson - junction devices have recently attracted a wide interest , both theoretically and experimentally , particularly in view of the possibility of identifying macroscopic quantum phenomena in their behavior . in this respect ,",
    "one of the circuits that have gained great attention is the so - called superconducting cooper pair box ( scb ) , with an increasing number of experiments aimed at supporting a qubit interpretation of its evolution [ 6 - 9 ] .",
    "several schemes have been proposed for implementing quantum computer hardware in solid state quantum electronics .",
    "these schemes use electric charge [ 10 ] , magnetic flux [ 11 ] and superconducting phase [ 12 ] and electron spin [ 13 ]",
    ".    the basic element of the quantum information is the quantum bit ( qubit ) which is considered as a two level system . in the quantum information and more precisely in the quantum computer",
    ", there is an important question which would be raised : what is the speed of sending information from a nod to another so as to reach the final output ?",
    "since the information is coded in a density operator , we therefore ask how fast the density operator will change its orthogonality [ 14 ] .",
    "this is to shed some light on the general behavior of the interaction process and its relationship with the speed of the computation [ 15 - 17 ] ( maximum number of orthogonal states that the system can pass through per unit time ) , speed of orthogonality [ 18 ] ( minimum time for a quantum state @xmath4 to evolve into orthogonal state @xmath5 where @xmath6 ) .    in the present paper ,",
    "we consider the concrete situation of a two - level system ( cooper pair box ) interacting with a quantum cavity field .",
    "we investigate the speed of computations when the initial state of the field is considered either in a fock state or a binomial state .",
    "the following questions are considered : do useful properties of computational speed arise from considering different initial state settings ?",
    "what role , if any , does mean photon number play any important role in the general behavior of the computational speed ? and , in the framework of an initial binomial state ,",
    "is it possible to obtain different orthogonality times which are useful for quantum computation ?",
    "answering these questions is the main aim of this paper .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii , we introduce a brief discussion on the qubit - field interaction and its dynamics .",

    "we suppose that the gate capacitance @xmath13 is screened from the quantized radiation field ( see figure ( 1 ) ) , and then the hamiltonian of the system can be written as [ 19 - 21 ]    @xmath14    where @xmath15  is the cooper pair charge on the island , where @xmath16 is the number of cooper - pairs , @xmath17  is the phase difference across the junction , @xmath18  is the field frequency , and @xmath19 , @xmath20 are the creation and annihilation operators of the microwave .",
