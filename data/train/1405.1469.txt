    "@xcite in contrast , even today there is no consensus for the corresponding probability distribution for non - equilibrium systems . @xcite the most common approximation for a non - equilibrium system that has a time - varying potential is the maxwell - boltzmann distribution evaluated at the current time .",
    "the problem with this is that it is insensitive to the sign of the molecular velocities , which violates the second law of thermodynamics .",
    "another approximation is the so - called yamada - kawasaki distribution , which also uses the maxwell - boltzmann distribution , but evaluated at point on the adiabatic ( hamiltonian ) trajectory in the distant past.@xcite this takes the non - equilibrium system to be instantaneously in equilibrium in the past , again in violation of the second law , and it neglects the influence of the reservoir on the subsequent evolution of the sub - system .",
    "neither approximation has been generalized to thermodynamic non - equilibrium systems ( heat flow , chemical reactions , etc . ) .",
    "the present author has derived a formally exact expression for the non - equilibrium probability distribution that is suitable for systems with time varying potentials or with applied thermodynamic gradients.@xcite although still lacking broad consensus , it is true to say that it is the only non - equilibrium probability distribution that respects the second law of thermodynamics and that has been successfully tested analytically and numerically with computer simulation .",

    "some clarifying remarks are added in places , and some approximate steps in the original derivation are either removed or corrected .",
    "the first task is to obtain the reservoir entropy for a trajectory in the sub - system phase space .",
    "because points in phase space have no internal entropy ( i.e.  they have uniform weight ) , the points in phase space of the sub - system itself have no entropy , and so the reservoir entropy is the same as the total entropy.@xcite    for a mechanical non - equilibrium system the time dependent hamiltonian has the form @xmath0 here @xmath1 is a point in the phase space point of the sub - system , which may be split into position and momentum components , @xmath2",
    ". the total energy is not fixed , but depends upon the work done .",
    "the latter depends upon the specific trajectory leading up to the present point , and it is given by @xmath3 the the change in total energy of the system is the work done , @xmath4",
    ". the adiabatic rate of change of the sub - system energy is @xmath5    the sub - system has an energy that only depends upon the current point and time .",
    "hence the change in the sub - system energy over a trajectory is just the difference between the initial and final values of the hamiltonian , @xmath6 where the trajectory @xmath7 starts at @xmath8 at time @xmath9 and ends at @xmath10 at time @xmath11 .    with the change in reservoir energy being the change in total energy less the change in sub - system energy one can write the change in reservoir entropy on a particular trajectory as @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the reservoir temperature .",
    "this is strictly the change from the initial time , but the initial values , including the initial sub - system energy @xmath14 in the third equality , are not shown . in the final equality has been identified the static reservoir entropy for a mechanical non - equilibrium system , @xmath15 more generally , this is obtained from the exchange of conserved quantities with the reservoir and is the usual equilibrium formula for the entropy ( see , for example , eq .",
    "( [ eq : sst - e0-e1 ] ) ) .",
    "the dynamic part of the reservoir entropy , which is the specifically non - equilibrium part of the reservoir entropy , is defined as @xmath16 this term vanishes for an equilibrium system .",
    "it represents a correction for double counting in the expression for the static entropy when it is applied to a non - equilibrium system",
    ".    the double counting may be seen by noting that @xmath17 comes from the total change in the sub - system energy .",
    "this total change is in part due to the adiabatic evolution of the sub - system , which is independent of the reservoir , and in part due to interactions with the reservoir .",
    "by energy conservation , only the latter change the reservoir entropy .",
    "this is why the adiabatic changes of the sub - system have to be subtracted from the total change in reservoir entropy via @xmath18 .",
    "denote the most likely trajectory that ends at @xmath10 at time @xmath11 by an over - line , @xmath19    the reduction theorem@xcite states that the entropy of the current point is equal to the entropy of the most likely trajectory leading to the current point , @xmath20 the final two terms in the first equality come from the conservation law for weight in non - equilibrium systems , ( see  8.3.1 of ref .  [ ] ) .",
    "these invoke the total entropy , which at time @xmath21 is @xmath22 .",
    "since this is independent of @xmath10 , the final two terms of the first equality may be neglected in the point entropy , the final equality .",

    "the purpose of this and the following  [ sec : nesdeom ] is to derive the stochastic , dissipative equations of motion that correspond to the non - equilibrium probability .",
    "in fact , the derivation could be bypassed in favor of the physical interpretation discussed in the conclusion .",

    "let @xmath25 be the most likely configuration of the sub - system at time @xmath11 and let @xmath26 be the fluctuation or the departure from the most likely point .",
    "the non - equilibrium reservoir entropy is maximized at @xmath27 , or , equivalently , @xmath28 , and so in the expansion of it about this point the linear term vanishes , @xmath29 here @xmath30 is the reservoir entropy most likely produced to date , and the fluctuation matrix is @xmath31 .",
    "an expansion of the static part of the reservoir entropy about the most likely configuration yields @xmath32 the gradient on the most likely trajectory is @xmath33 .    in the dissipative equations of motion that are derived below the gradient of the reservoir entropy appears . in this",
    "one may approximate the full reservoir entropy fluctuation matrix by the static part of the entropy fluctuation matrix , @xmath34 there are three justifications for this approximation .",
    "the first is that the fluctuations about the non - equilibrium state are determined by the current molecular structure of the sub - system , which is the local equilibrium structure , and they are therefore determined by the static part of the reservoir entropy .",
    "the second is that the fluctuations about the most likely non - equilibrium state have the same character and symmetries as equilibrium fluctuations . in particular , the matrix representing them must be block diagonal in the parity representation , just as @xmath35 is .",
    "the third justification follows from the resulting equations of motion and is given in the conclusion .",
    "this approximation has been found to be accurate in computer simulation tests for both mechanical @xcite and thermodynamic @xcite non - equilibrium systems .",
    "since the gradient of the static part of the reservoir entropy has the expansion , @xmath36 one sees that the above approximation for the gradient of the reservoir entropy implies that @xmath37 this is a time dependent constant in phase space .",

    "the final time dependent constant term arises from the reduction theorem : for time dependent weights , the transition weight is normalized to the geometric mean of the two terminal states ,  8.3.1 of ref .  [ ] .",

    "there are two justifications for neglecting any reversible reservoir contribution to the evolution of a fluctuation .",
    "the primary reason for considering any reversible reservoir contribution to be negligible is that the thermodynamic contribution to a fluctuation should be time symmetric : in the future and in the past the fluctuation is equally likely to be closer to zero . as far as the reservoir is concerned , the regression of a fluctuation back to the most likely state is as probable as the progression of the fluctuation from the most likely state .",
    "this means that the reservoir contribution to the transition between fluctuation states should be an even function of time .",
    "the secondary reason is the one mentioned above , namely that the reservoir represents a perturbation on the sub - system , and any reversible reservoir contribution would be dominated by the reversible adiabatic contribution .",
    "conversely , it is necessary to retain the irreversible reservoir contribution because it is the only such contribution to the evolution and so it is not negligible relative to any other term with the same time symmetry .    with these , the conditionally most likely transition , eq .",

    "the physical interpretation of this is that the evolution of the fluctuation is the sum of a reversible adiabatic term due to the internal interactions within the sub - system , and an irreversible term that arises from the reservoir .",
    "this latter term depends upon the gradient in the entropy and it represents the thermodynamic driving force toward the most likely trajectory @xmath81 .    recalling that the fluctuation is @xmath82 , this may be rearranged to give the conditionally most likely point in phase space itself , @xmath83 in obtaining the final equality , the approximation @xmath84 has been used for the reservoir gradient , eqs  ( [ eq : olsr = olsst ] ) , ( [ eq : dsreq ] ) , and ( [ eq : grad - sdyn ] ) .",
    "further , by evaluating the first three terms at @xmath85 in the forward direction , the reservoir contribution to the evolution of the most likely trajectory has been identified as @xmath86 ( see the physical interpretation in the conclusion . ) note that this evolution is not purely adiabatic , @xmath87 , which is to say that it contains contributions from the reservoir . even though the entropy gradient vanishes on the most likely trajectory , @xmath88 , it is the static part of the gradient , @xmath89 , that drives the non - adiabatic evolution .",
    "also , because the most likely trajectory is a single valued function of time , its evolution has to be reversible , and hence this reservoir contribution is proportional to @xmath72 rather than to @xmath76 .",

    "the total reservoir force is the sum of the above dissipative term and a stochastic contribution , @xmath96 .",
    "the origin of the random force may be seen by rearranging the second entropy explicitly into gaussian form , which is to say a fluctuation about the conditionally most likely terminus , @xmath97 . since the remainder reduces to the first entropy",

    "it shows that the magnitude of the fluctuations is linearly proportional to the magnitude of the dissipation , both being determined by @xmath104 , the leading - order coefficient of the second entropy expansion . in consequence , one can never have dissipation without fluctuations .",
    "the dissipative term @xmath105 is the thermodynamic driving force that involves the gradient in entropy .",
    "it is called this because dissipation is the rate of entropy production , which is the velocity times the gradient in the entropy .",

    "apart from the factor of mass , the change in the position component over a time step is just the momentum component times the time step , at least to first order in the time step , @xmath107 .",

    "this is formally the same as in the equilibrium case .",
    "the specifically non - equilibrium concept is that the reservoir entropy consists of a static and a dynamic part , eq .",
    "( [ eq : srgt ] ) , @xmath175 the static part is the ordinary equilibrium expression that is based on exchange of conserved variables with the reservoir . in a non - equilibrium system the conservation laws may not hold , ( e.g.  the energy may change due to a time - varying external potential , or energy gradients may change by internal relaxation processes ) , and so the dynamic part of the reservoir entropy subtracts the adiabatic or internal change from the total change .",
    "this adiabatic change is path dependent , but in the thermodynamic limit it can be obtained by integrating over the most likely trajectory leading to the current point and neglecting fluctuations about this trajectory . in  [ sec : adtraj ] a useful adiabatic approximation to the trajectory used in the dynamic part of the entropy was given .    in   [ sec : fluc - form ] and [ sec : nesdeom ] the stochastic , dissipative equations of motion that correspond to this non - equilibrium probability density were given .",
    "for a single time step , the phase space transition @xmath176 was found to be governed by the stochastic , dissipative equation ( [ eq : olgamma2 ] ) , @xmath177 there are four transition terms on the right hand side .",

    "the third term is basically the second term evaluated on the most likely trajectory , @xmath81 .",
    "this term arises as a correction to the second term because by definition the most likely trajectory is reversible ( i.e.  a single valued function of time can be chosen ) .",
    "one can see that on the most likely trajectory the irreversible parts of the second and third terms cancel with each other leaving the deterministic transition on this trajectory fully reversible . for a forward trajectory , @xmath185 , the coefficient of this third term vanishes .",
    "the fourth term is the stochastic term .",
    "it arises from the fact that the sub - system phase space is a projection of the total system phase space , and so the evolution of a trajectory in the sub - system is not uniquely determined by a point in the sub - system , which is the definition of randomness .",
