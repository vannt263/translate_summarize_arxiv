    "over the past decades , the interest in discrete mechanics has been steadily increasing .",
    "partly this is due to the development of geometric integrators , which provide a relatively simple means for the long - term numerical integration of mechanical systems . on the other hand , many concepts ( poisson tensors , reduction , etc . ) from the continuum theory also have a natural counterpart in the discrete realm , which makes discrete mechanics a subject worthy of interest in its own right .",
    "we refer here in particular to the pioneering efforts of moser and veselov @xcite , who studied a class of discrete integrable systems , and weinstein @xcite , who was the first to recognize the fact that many of these discrete systems can be understood from the point of view of lie groupoids .    inspired by these powerful and elegant methods , a number of people set out to develop a similar geometric approach to classical field theories .",
    "bridges @xcite introduced a concept of `` multisymplecticity '' for hamiltonian partial differential equations and later bridges & reich @xcite studied numerical integrators that conserve a discretized version of multisymplecticity . independently ,",
    "marsden , patrick , and shkoller @xcite extended the work of veselov in order to deal with lagrangian field theories . in a previous paper @xcite",
    ", we built upon their work by extending the lie - groupoid methods from weinstein s paper and related work by marrero , martn , and martnez @xcite to the case of lagrangian field theories , allowing us to treat a larger class of field theories , as well as shedding new light on some of the constructions in @xcite .    in this note",
    ", we now focus on a special class of discrete lagrangian field theories and their behaviour in the presence of symmetry : we introduce a reduction procedure , similar to the one proposed by marsden , pekarsky , and shkoller @xcite and bobenko and suris @xcite for discrete mechanical systems , and show that the resulting discrete field equations have a simple and natural interpretation in the context of discrete geometry .",
    "we begin by introducing a fixed mesh ( a certain collection of vertices , edges , and faces ) in the space of independent variables .",
    "initially , we are interested in discrete fields that associate to each vertex an element of a given lie group @xmath0 . if the lagrangian of such a model is @xmath0-invariant , we show in  [ sec : dep ] that these fields can be reduced to a new class of fields that associate a group element to each _ edge _ of the given mesh .",
    "this reduction procedure is a field - theoretic version of the discrete euler - poincar equations from @xcite .",
    "we then show that the converse procedure ( of reconstruction ) is possible only if a certain obstruction vanishes .",
    "this obstruction has a natural interpretation as the curvature of a discrete @xmath0-connection .",
    "this is similar to the case of continuum field theories , as studied in @xcite .    in  [ sec : noether ] , we take an alternative route to the euler - poincar equations : inspired by a similar treatment in @xcite , we prove a discrete version of noether s theorem and use the @xmath0-invariance of the lagrangian to derive the field equations . finally , in  [ sec : mv ] , we consider the lagrangian of harmonic mappings into a lie group : we propose an extension of the well - known moser - veselov algorithm , demonstrate its equivalence to the euler - poincar equations , and establish a particularly clear form of the field equations ( involving the concepts of discrete geometry introduced in  [ sec : discdg ] ) .    throughout the paper",
    ", a number of simplifying assumptions will be made . in ",
    "[ sec : general ] we therefore conclude this paper by giving a brief overview of how these assumptions may be circumvented , and we also indicate how the discrete field theories in this paper fit into the framework of lie groupoid field theories developed in @xcite . in particular , we show that the euler - poincar reduction procedure in  [ sec : dep ] is just a particular instance of a general reduction theorem in the category of lie groupoid field theories .",
    "in this paper , we consider field theories with two independent variables .",
    "such field theories can be modeled as sections of a fibre bundle with base space @xmath1 ( see @xcite ) . in order to discretize these fields",
    ", we introduce the _ set of vertices _ @xmath2 in @xmath1 as the set of points in @xmath1 with integer coordinates ( @xmath3 ) . as in finite - difference approximations ,",
    "the idea is that continuous fields are approximated by specifying their values on the elements of @xmath2 .    for future reference",
    ", we also introduce the _ set of edges _",
    "@xmath4 , whose elements are ordered pairs of the following form : for all @xmath5 , @xmath6 furthermore , we also demand that if @xmath7 , then also @xmath8 , and we write @xmath9 . in other words",
    ", @xmath4 consists of `` horizontal '' and `` vertical '' line segments of unit length . to avoid cumbersome notation",
    ", we will note an arbitrary element of @xmath4 as @xmath10 , or if we have to refer to its begin and end vertex , as @xmath11 .",
    "finally , we introduce the _ set of faces _ @xmath12 as the set of quadruples @xmath13 of closed paths in @xmath4 , i.e. where the end vertex of @xmath14 is the begin vertex of @xmath15 for @xmath16 , and , in addition , we demand that @xmath17 for @xmath16 .",
    "( the indices should be interpreted as being `` modulo @xmath18 '' : @xmath19 is just @xmath20 . )    the elements of @xmath12 can thus be pictured as little squares in @xmath1 . a generic element of @xmath12 will be noted as @xmath21 , or , since @xmath21 is fully determined by its bounding vertices , as @xmath22 . note that there are two distinct classes of elements in @xmath12 : those where the vertices are denoted in clockwise and anticlockwise fashion , respectively .",
    "this section is devoted to a review of some elementary concepts of algebraic topology , which will be needed in our discussion of discrete harmonic maps in section  [ sec : mv ] .",
    "most of this section is modeled on @xcite , as well as on the text book @xcite .",
    "consider the mesh @xmath23 in @xmath1 introduced in the previous section .",
    "the collection of sets @xmath24 together with its various incidence relations determines a cell complex and this leads us naturally to the concepts of homology and cohomology .",
    "it is therefore not unreasonable to expect that some of these concepts will enter our study of discrete field theories later on .",
    "an _ @xmath25-chain _ on the given mesh , where @xmath26 , is a formal linear combination ( with coefficients in @xmath27 ) of `` @xmath25-dimensional elements '' . more precisely , the vector space of @xmath28-chains is given by @xmath29 where it should be stressed that the elements of @xmath30 are _ formal _ linear combinations of elements of @xmath2 .",
    "similarly , the vector space @xmath31 of @xmath32-chains is generated by elements of @xmath4 , @xmath33 by elements of @xmath12 , and so on .",
    "furthermore , for the space of @xmath32-chains , we adopt the identification that @xmath34 .",
    "it is customary to define _ discrete @xmath25-forms _ as @xmath25-dimensional cochains , i.e. elements of the dual vector space @xmath35 of @xmath36 . from this definition",
    ", it follows immediately that a discrete zero - form induces a function @xmath37 .",
    "conversely , such a function gives rise to a zero - form through linear extension .",
    "similarly , discrete one - forms can be identified with functions @xmath38 defined on the set of edges .",
    "it should be borne in mind that these functions are not necessarily defined on the whole of @xmath39 , but only on the subset @xmath4 of edges of the mesh .",
    "we also note that @xmath40 for any edge @xmath11 .",
    "we continue by defining discrete two - forms as functions @xmath41 on the set of faces .",
    "again , these functions can be extended unambiguously by linearity to a proper cochain . to summarize",
    ", we have the following definition :    for @xmath26 , a * discrete @xmath25-form * is a linear map @xmath42 . for @xmath43 ,",
    "all discrete @xmath25-forms are zero .",
    "the set of all discrete @xmath25-forms is denoted by @xmath35 .    for the sake of self - containedness , we recall the explicit form of the coboundary operator @xmath44 . for a zero - form @xmath45 , @xmath46 . for a one - form @xmath38 , @xmath47 the coboundary of a discrete two - form",
    "is defined to be zero .",
    "we will sometimes refer to @xmath48 as the `` discrete differential '' .",
    "note that @xmath48 is the dual of the boundary operator @xmath49 , in the sense that @xmath50 for all @xmath51 and @xmath52 , and where @xmath53 is the natural pairing between @xmath36 and @xmath54 .",
    "this is a discrete analogue of the stokes theorem . for more information ,",
    "see  @xcite .      in riemannian geometry , the hodge star on an oriented manifold @xmath55 maps @xmath25-forms on @xmath55 to @xmath56-forms on @xmath55 , where @xmath57 .",
    "as could be expected from the continuous theory , the discrete hodge star @xmath58 , to be introduced below , maps discrete @xmath25-forms into @xmath59-forms .",
    "however , there is an additional complication in the discrete case : the forms @xmath60 are not defined on the mesh itself , but rather on a _ dual mesh _ , which we now define .",
    "the * dual mesh * @xmath61 is constructed as follows .",
    "for every face in @xmath12 , there is a vertex in @xmath62 ( for which one usually takes the circumcentric dual ; see @xcite ) .",
    "there is an edge in @xmath63 between two vertices @xmath64 if and only if the faces in @xmath12 corresponding to @xmath65 and @xmath66 have precisely one edge in common .",
    "this determines the sets @xmath62 and @xmath63 ; the set @xmath67 consists of the faces of this dual graph .",
    "it is easy to see that to each face in @xmath67 , there corresponds a vertex in @xmath2 .",
    "see figure  [ fig : vierkantjes ] for an illustration .",
    "implicit in this definition is the existence of a duality operator @xmath68 between @xmath25-chains on the mesh and @xmath59-chains on the dual mesh .",
    "this duality is well defined , but only up to orientation ; we now use the standard orientation of @xmath1 to settle this point .",
    "the definition used here agrees with the algorithm for the orientation of dual cells proposed in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* remark  2.5.1 ) .",
    "we first define @xmath68 on the elements of @xmath2 , @xmath4 , and @xmath12 . by linear extension , it",
    "will then be determined on the whole of @xmath36 .",
    "the dual vertex @xmath69 of a face @xmath21 whose vertices are written down in anticlockwise fashion is the element @xmath70 of @xmath62 introduced above .",
    "if , on the other hand , the orientation of @xmath21 is the opposite , then @xmath69 equals @xmath71 .",
    "we define the dual @xmath72 of a vertex @xmath73 to be the corresponding face in @xmath67 , with the natural orientation : @xmath74 .",
    "finally , the definition of @xmath68 on @xmath4 is slightly more intricate ; here , we follow @xcite .",
    "let @xmath11 be an edge in @xmath4 and let @xmath75 be the corresponding dual edge , considered as an unordered set .",
    "the line segments @xmath76 $ ] and @xmath77 $ ] determine a basis of @xmath1 : if this basis is positively oriented , then @xmath78 , otherwise , @xmath79 . in the case of the square mesh of figure  [ fig : vierkantjes ] , the action of @xmath68 on @xmath4 corresponds to an anticlockwise rotation over @xmath80 .    on the dual mesh , one can again introduce discrete forms .",
    "we will denote the vector space of discrete @xmath25-forms on the dual mesh by @xmath81 . as the dual mesh is again a square mesh",
    ", there is a natural way to extend @xmath68 to an operator from @xmath61 to @xmath23 .",
    "it is then easy to check that @xmath82 for any @xmath52 .",
    "the * discrete hodge star * @xmath83 is defined by @xmath84    the definition given here is ( up to a constant ) a special case of the one proposed in @xcite .",
    "note that @xmath85 .    with the discrete hodge star and the coboundary operator of the previous paragraph , we now arrive at the definition of the discrete codifferential .",
    "let @xmath86 be a discrete @xmath25-form .",
    "then the * discrete codifferential * @xmath87 is the discrete @xmath88-form @xmath87 defined as @xmath89 .",
    "it is useful to write out this definition explicitly for one - forms and two - forms .",
    "if @xmath38 is a discrete one - form , then @xmath90 is given by @xmath91 where @xmath92 are the end points of the edges that emanate from @xmath73 .",
    "in other words , @xmath93 assigns to each vertex @xmath73 the sum of contributions from @xmath38 on the edges that have @xmath73 as a vertex .",
    "secondly , for a discrete two - form @xmath94 we note that @xmath95 is the discrete one - form given by @xmath96 , where @xmath97 and @xmath98 are the faces that have @xmath11 as a common edge , and where @xmath97 is the face where the orientation of the boundary edges agrees with the ordering of @xmath11 , whereas @xmath98 is the face with the opposite ordering .",
    "our definition of discrete codifferential agrees with the one from desbrun _ et al . _",
    "@xcite up to sign .",
    "in their paper , the discrete codifferential is defined as @xmath99 , where @xmath100 is the dimension of the ambient space .",
    "note that here , as @xmath101 , @xmath102 regardless of @xmath25 .      in the preceding sections",
    ", we introduced discrete one - forms as assignments of a real number to each edge @xmath103 .",
    "this theory can be extended in a straightforward way to discrete forms taking values in an arbitrary _ abelian _ lie group @xmath0 , the only significant difference being that we have to redefine the spaces of @xmath25-chains @xmath36 as consisting of formal linear combinations with coefficients in @xmath104 .",
    "for instance , if @xmath105 is a discrete one - form , then @xmath106 is determined by its action on the set @xmath12 by ( [ eqdiff ] ) and can be extended by linearity to yield a map from @xmath33 to @xmath0 , where it should be borne in mind that the elements of @xmath33 are still formal linear combinations of elements in @xmath12 , but now with coefficients in @xmath104 .",
    "the theory of discrete forms with values in an abelian lie group will be used in section  [ sec : mv ] , but in the general case , we will be confronted with mappings from @xmath4 to a _ non - abelian _ lie group @xmath0 . such maps can no longer be interpreted as discrete one - forms . luckily , it turns out that these maps have a natural interpretation as _ discrete @xmath0-connections _ , which we now define .",
    "[ def : dc ] a * discrete @xmath0-connection * is a map @xmath107 , such that , for all edges @xmath103 , @xmath108 .",

    "a discrete @xmath0-connection is said to be * flat * if @xmath112 for all @xmath113 .",
    "note that in the case of a non - flat connection , @xmath114 depends not only on @xmath21 , but also on the exact representation of @xmath21 as a set of edges @xmath111 ( any cyclic permutation of this set represents the same face ) .",
    "however , this indeterminacy does not occur for flat connections , the only case that we will consider later on .",
    "the theory of discrete @xmath0-connections closely mimics the usual theory of connections . as an example , we mention the following proposition , from which a number of interesting properties may be deduced .    [ prop : holonomy ] consider a discrete @xmath0-connection @xmath107 . if @xmath115 is flat , then there exists a unique mapping @xmath116 such that @xmath117 .",
    "this follows immediately from ( * ? ? ?",
    "7 ) , or can be proved directly as follows .",
    "we define a _ path _ in @xmath4 to be a sequence @xmath118 of edges , such that the end vertex of @xmath14 is the begin vertex of @xmath119 ( for @xmath120 ) .",
    "let @xmath107 be any discrete @xmath0-connection .",
    "in particular , @xmath115 need not be flat .",
    "then , @xmath115 induces a map @xmath121 from the set of paths to @xmath0 as follows : @xmath122    we call @xmath121 the `` discrete holonomy mapping '' .",
    "note that if @xmath115 is a flat connection , one can easily prove that @xmath121 maps closed paths to the unit in @xmath0 .",
    "furthermore , in the case of a flat connection , it can be easily established that simplicially homotopic paths have the same image under @xmath121 .",
    "( this is the discrete counterpart of a well - known theorem of continuous connections ( see @xcite ) : if @xmath115 is a flat connection , then any two closed homotopic loops have the same holonomy . )",
    "let us now return to the discrete theory . in the case of a flat connection on a simply - connected cell complex",
    ", we have seen that @xmath121 does not depend on the choice of path between two fixed points , and induces therefore a map @xmath123 .",
    "this map satisfies the requirements in proposition  [ prop : holonomy ] .",
    "the concept of discrete @xmath0-connections used here is common in lattice gauge theories ( see @xcite ) .",
    "novikov @xcite studied a similar concept .",
    "closely related to this definition is the concept of _ discrete connection on a discrete principal fibre bundle _ ( see @xcite for definitions and @xcite for an application to discrete reduction ) .",
    "the latter could be used to extend the results in this paper to the case of _ lagrange - poincar reduction _",
    ", where a @xmath0-invariant lagrangian on a pair groupoid @xmath124 is given .",
    "if @xmath125 coincides with the symmetry group @xmath0 , then lagrange - poincar reduction is just euler - poincar reduction , the case considered here .",
    "in this section , we begin our study of discrete lagrangian field theories .",
    "initially , we define discrete fields as follows :    a _ discrete field _ is a map @xmath126 .",
    "if the discrete lagrangian , to be defined below , is @xmath0-invariant , we shall see that these fields induce a new class of discrete fields , that associate a group element to each edge . from the last section ,",
    "we know that such maps have a natural interpretation as discrete @xmath0-connections .",
    "in theorem  [ thm : eulerpoincare ] , it is shown how the field equations for the unreduced fields @xmath45 are equivalent to a set of equations , called _ discrete euler - poincar equations _",
    ", for the reduced fields @xmath38 .",
    "both sets of equations arise by extremizing a certain action functional . in theorem  [ thm :",
    "reconstruction ] , we deal with the reconstruction problem . starting from a reduced field @xmath127 , it is shown that @xmath38 gives rise to a solution @xmath126 of the original field equations if and only if the curvature of @xmath38 vanishes .",
    "this treatment was inspired by the work of castrilln and ratiu @xcite , who developed lagrangian reduction for field theories in the continuous case .      a * discrete lagrangian * is a function @xmath128 .",
    "a word of explanation is in order here . in the continuous case ,",
    "a lagrangian is a function @xmath129 , where @xmath130 is the first jet bundle of the bundle @xmath131 .",
    "it can be shown that , in this case , @xmath130 is isomorphic to @xmath132 ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma  4.1.20 ) ) . under the ( modest ) assumption that lagrangian @xmath133 does not depend on the coordinates of the base space ,",
    "we therefore conclude that @xmath133 is just a function on @xmath134 .",
    "the idea of defining a discrete lagrangian as a function on @xmath135 then follows from the idea of moser and veselov of approximating @xmath136 by @xmath137 : by applying this veselov - type discretization twice ( once in the `` horizontal '' and once in the `` vertical '' direction of the square mesh ) , it follows that @xmath138 has @xmath139 as a natural discrete counterpart ; see figure  [ fig : points ] .     by @xmath139 ]",

    "in contrast to discrete mechanics , it is not very likely that a reconstruction theorem can be proved in the context of lie groupoids ; in the case of lie groups , for instance , there is the obstruction of flatness .",
    "in this paper , we have shown that the well - known concepts of symmetry and euler - poincar reduction can be extended by very modest means to the case of discrete field theories .",
