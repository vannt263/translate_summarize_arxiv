    "there exist in the literature tables of clebsch - gordan tables involving representations of su(3 ) with integral hypercharge values @xcite .",
    "these are inadequate for handling physical problems that use representations that can not be built from combinations involving three quarks or quark plus antiquark .",
    "such problems include calculations involving exotic hadrons , sextet quarks , or flavor @xmath0 transitions such as @xmath4 . hence the need to develop the program su3clebsch that calculates tables involving representations with nonintegral hypercharge .",
    "the conventions of @xcite are used to label the representations .",
    "users desiring a review of the theoretical background can consult @xcite .",
    "we can always write an @xmath0 tensor with only upper indices which run over @xmath5=1 , @xmath6=2 , @xmath7=3 . in the program tensors",
    "are represented by arrays of integers .",
    "real values are not necessary as a result of the structure of the group ; i.e. , the quantum numbers of states are not continuous and therefore the coefficient of each term in a vector is a rational number .",
    "the number of integers is @xmath8 for an array that represents a tensor with @xmath9 indices .",
    "a state in a representation of @xmath0 is a tensor with a particular hypercharge , isospin and third component of isospin .",
    "the array representing such a state is called a `` vector '' in the program code .",
    "states of a representation must be properly normalized in order to maintain the unitarity of the table of clebsch - gordan tables .",
    "that is , the inner product of a vector with itself must be 1 .",
    "therefore the sum of the squares of the integers in a vector is stored in the 0 , 1 , ... , 1 component of the vector and serves as the denominator ( squared ) .",
    "the integers themselves serve as the numerators .",
    "the vectors can now be thought of as arrays of rational numbers .",
    "for example , consider the highest - weight state of the * 8*. in the pion octet this state is the @xmath10 , and in the lowest baryon octet it is the proton",
    ". @xmath11 the vector that represents it has nonzero components only in the spaces marked by @xmath5 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath5 .",
    "the norm squared is 2 and is stored in the space marked 0 , @xmath5 , @xmath5 .",
    "we can write it simply as @xmath12 although our storage method is not efficient , it has facilitated the coding of the program .    the raising and lowering operations of the group @xmath0",
    "are performed by subroutines that raise or lower the indices of a vector .",
    "raising or lowering can occur in any of the three directions corresponding to the three @xmath13 subgroups of su(3 ) .",
    "for example , if we wish to lower the isospin of the highest - weight state of the * 8 * shown above , the first nonzero component can have either its first or second index lowered , while the other nonzero component can have either the first or third index lowered .",
    "two of these possibilities cancel to leave @xmath14 the raising and lowering operations are used to construct all of the vectors in a given representation from the highest - weight state .",
    "the product of two representations is calculated as all possible outer products of vectors in the representations .",
    "the outer product of an @xmath9-vector and an @xmath15-vector is an @xmath16-vector whose nonzero components are the products of the appropriate nonzero components of the factor vectors . for example , the outer product of the highest - weight vector of the * 8 * in equation ( [ highest8 ] ) and the highest - weight vector of the @xmath1 , @xmath17 is @xmath18    the representations in the clebsch - gordan series are constructed from the largest to the smallest . by larger",
    "we mean having a highest - weight vector with quantum numbers larger than the highest - weight vector of a smaller representation .",
    "the smaller ones are constructed such that their highest - weight vectors ( and hence all of their vectors ) are orthogonal to the vectors of the larger representations of the same weight .",
    "for example , consider the product ( [ high8x3bar ] ) above .",
    "this is the highest - weight vector of the @xmath19 representation .",
    "we apply a lowering operation to find the state of the @xmath19 that has the set of quantum numbers ( `` weights '' ) @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , i.e. , @xmath23 the highest - weight vector of the * 6 * in the product is found to be a vector spanned by the outer products of the vectors in * 8 * and @xmath1 of the same weight and which is orthogonal to this vector of the @xmath19 .",
    "the complete @xmath19 and * 6 * representations are constructed , and the @xmath1 in the product is constructed to be orthogonal to both .    to find the clebsch - gordan coefficients , we consider two sets of vectors .",
    "the first set consists of all possible outer products of the vectors in the representations that we are multiplying .",
    "the second set consists of all of the vectors in the representations that have been constructed in the product .",
    "the coefficients are the inner products between these sets of vectors . in the example that we have been following ,",
    "the coefficient @xmath24 this is the second line in the table of sample output shown below .",
    "the program is broken up into routines that handle vectors and representations with specific numbers of @xmath0 indices .",
    "this means that we have replication of procedures for each set of indices , but that the program is easier to use and to code .",
    "the main routine calls the subroutines that generate the tables desired .",
    "they in turn call the routines that manipulate the vectors and representations necessary to compile the tables .",
    "the routines that build the pieces necessary to construct the tables of coefficients are named do*r*x*s * , where * r * and * s * are the names of the representations to be multiplied . the user must remove the comment braces around the procedure calls in the main routine ( at the bottom of the program listing ) for the tables that he wishes to calculate .",
    "the routines that are included in this version of the program are    .2 in    [ cols= \" < , > , < , < , < , > , < , < \" , ]     .2 in",
    "in order to use this program , the user must remove the comment braces around the call to do*r*x*s * in the the main procedure for the table that he wishes to calculate .",
    "then the code can be compiled and run .",
    "we recommend calculating one table at a time , due to the variable , and sometimes very long , running time .",
    "since we store representations as arrays of vectors , the vectors are labelled not by their quantum numbers , but merely by integers . here",
    "we explain the ordering of the vectors .",
    "the highest - weight state is always numbered 1 .",
    "this is the state of highest isospin in the isomultiplet of highest hypercharge .",
    "states are then sequentially numbered from right to left and then from top to bottom of the weight diagram of the representation . for representations that have doubly ( or more ) occupied sites in the weight diagram , the states with largest total isospin are numbered first . only after one state in every site has been numbered are the other states numbered , again from right to left and from top to bottom .",
    "the procedures display*r * write the weight diagrams with their numbering schemes into the files repfile",
    ". the figure shows the fifteen representation and the numbering of its states .",
    "it contains the isoquartet 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , the isotriplet 8 , 9 , 10 , the isodoublet 13 , 14 , and the isosinglet 15 .",
    "a square root is assumed to appear over each coefficient in the tables generated .",
    "any minus signs are outside the square root .",
    "if the user finds it necessary to write additional procedures to compile additional tables , then he should be aware of some error messages that may be written to outlog .",
    "the routines findperp_n _ write error messages if their results are not highest - isospin vectors or if their results are null vectors .",
    "in many cases , one does not want the highest - isospin vector , and so this error message is often ignored .",
    "when calc*r*__n _ can ignore that message , it will place a note to that effect in outlog .",
    "if findperp_n _ returns a message that the result is a null vector , it is an indication that the desired result was not found ( because the two input vectors were parallel ) . a new choice of input vectors",
    "is then required .",
    "if a routine returns an error message saying that a vector is not a highest - weight vector when one was expected , then this is an indication that the construction of that vector was flawed .",
    "this can only be corrected on a case - by - case basis .",
    "below is a sample table generated by the program .",
    "the first column is the number of the state in the first representation in the product .",
    "the second column is the number of the state in the second representation .",
    "the third column is the number of the state in the product representation that is denoted in the heading of that part of the table .",
    "the last two columns are the numerator and denominator of the clebsch - gordan coefficient between those three states .",
    "recall that a square root is assumed to appear over each fraction .",
    "only nonzero coefficients are tabulated .",
