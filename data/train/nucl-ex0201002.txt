    "ceres / na45 is an experiment at the cern sps dedicated to measure low - mass e@xmath2e@xmath3 pairs near midrapidity in ultrarelativistic nuclear collisions @xcite .",
    "the ceres spectrometer ( fig .  [ tpc_trunc_field ] ) covers the full azimuthal acceptance in the polar angle region between @xmath4 @xmath5 @xmath6 @xmath5 @xmath7 .",
    "the high electron identification capability allows to separate the rare leptonic signals from the large hadronic background ; it is provided by two ring - imaging cerenkov counters ( rich ) .",
    "precise tracking of charged particles and vertex reconstruction are provided by two silicon drift detectors ( sdd1,2 ) located behind a segmented au target .",
    "this detector system is also used as a multiplicity trigger to get information on the centrality of the collision .    in order to improve the momentum resolution",
    "the ceres experiment has been upgraded @xcite during 1998 by the addition of a new magnet system and a time projection chamber ( tpc ) with a radial electric drift field .",
    "the tpc is operated inside an inhomogeneous magnetic field with a maximal radial component of 0.5 t , and provides the measurement of up to twenty space points for each charged particle track .",
    "besides a precise determination of the momentum the tpc also provides additional electron identification via de / dx . the magnet system between the two riches was not operated in the upgraded configuration .",
    "the addition of the tpc substantially improves the hadron capability of the ceres spectrometer allowing a systematic investigation of hadronic observables around midrapity . in the fall of 1999",
    "the upgraded ceres spectrometer was operated for the first time and @xmath8 semicentral pb+au collisions at 40 agev / c beam momentum were recorded .",
    "because of a not yet completely functional read - out system this data set is limited in terms of statistics and momentum resolution . in the fall of 2000 , the ceres spectrometer was fully operational with a very good overall performance , and @xmath9 central 158 agev / c pb+au events were recorded . in this paper",
    "we will focus on the @xmath0 analysis of the 40 agev / c data set .",
    "in this @xmath0 analysis we have used only the information from the sdd s and the tpc . the @xmath0 hyperon and its antiparticle",
    "were identified by reconstructing their decays into final states containing only charged particles : @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",

    "the combinatorial background is evaluated using the mixed event method .    to get a significant @xmath0 signal we had to reduce the large combinatorial background using different types of cuts discussed in the following .    * discrimination from target tracks * : taking into account the proper decay length @xmath15 = 7.89 cm of the @xmath0 and the @xmath16-factor of about 5 for the tpc acceptance , the decay length in the laboratory is @xmath17 40 cm .",
