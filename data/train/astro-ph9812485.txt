    "there is an increasing direct evidence that , at the centers of bulge - dominated galaxies , reside massive dark objects ( mdo ) , which are the likely remnants of the engines that once powered the qso phenomenon ( ho , 1998 ) . in a limited number of cases ,",
    "the evidence comes from the spectacular central - body - dominated ( cbd ) rotation curves of circumnuclear ( @xmath3 ) gaseous disks obtained by means of very high resolution instruments ( i.e. hst , vlbi and vlba , e.g. bower et al .",
    "1998 , cretton et al . 1998 ,",
    "schreier et al . 1998 ) .    in general",
    ", however , the evidence is more indirect : only careful studies of the dynamics of the innermost regions ( @xmath4 ) of galaxies reveal the presence of a central compact object , allowing mass estimates ( e.g. kormendy and richstone 1995 ; magorrian et al .",
    "1998 ; van der marel 1997 ) .",
    "the conclusions are that virtually every hot galaxy hosts a mdo with a mass ranging from @xmath5 to @xmath6 and roughly proportional to the mass of the spheroidal stellar component ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "these mdo masses are large enough to match those associated with the qso phenomenon .",
    "in fact , the highest bolometric luminosities of quasars , ( @xmath8 ) , under the assumption that the latter radiate at the eddington limit , imply underlying bh masses of @xmath9 , i.e. masses comparable with those of the largest mdos detected in ellipticals ( magorrian et al .  1998 ) . on the other hand , the lowest qso bolometric luminosities @xmath10 still imply considerable bh masses , of the order of @xmath11 ( e.g. paper i ) that it will be hereafter considered as the minimum reference mass for a bh qso - powering remnant . for disk galaxies",
    "the situation is different and much more uncertain .",
    "a direct determination of the central mass has been obtained only in a few cases ( including m31 and the galaxy ) and remarkably , these do not exceed @xmath12 ( see e.g. paper i , ho , 1998 ) .",
    "that is , in spirals , mdo masses in the range of the qso engine remnants have not currently been detected .",
    "this could be an intrinsic property of galactic bh s , perhaps related to the link between the bh mass and the bulge mass , coupled with the relationship between the latter and the host galaxy hubble type . in any case",
    ", the eventual lack of detections in spirals of massive bh ( @xmath13 ) can not be ascribed to observational biases .",
    "in fact , the `` sphere of influence '' @xmath14 , of a black hole of mass @xmath15 at the center of a galaxy at distance @xmath16 and with a _ projected _ central dispersion velocity @xmath17 is given by : @xmath18 with @xmath14 measured in arc - seconds . in hot , pressure - dominated systems , @xmath17 `` balances '' the gravitational attraction per unit mass due to a _ great part _ of the _ whole _ galaxy : since @xmath19 , the stellar dynamics , probed at @xmath20 resolution , can disentangle the central bh from the surrounding galactic nucleus only if @xmath21 . in rotationally - dominated objects",
    "a relation like the above still approximately holds when we substitute @xmath22 with the circular velocity . in this case , the rcs ( rotation curves ) , often available down to @xmath23 , if correctly probe the gravitational potential , measure only the mass _ inside _ @xmath24 .",
    "therefore they can resolve a central body of very small mass in that the nuclear stellar mass , obtained by extrapolating at low radii the stellar mass distribution , is quite small @xmath25 ( e.g. pss ) . turning back the argument , if nuclei of spirals host qso remnants , then the innermost kpc of their circular velocities will be strongly affected by such central bodies .    in paper",
    "i ( salucci et al .",
    "1998 ) we showed that the mass function of massive dark objects in elliptical galaxies matches that expected from the remnants of the past qso activity . extrapolating the e / s0 mdo mass function , we have predicted that only low mass mdos reside in spirals and that in these objects activity has been statistically lower than in ellipticals .",
    "the aim of this work is to confirm this scenario by investigating , through mdo s masses upper limits obtained by inner kinematics , the predicted strong hubble type dependence of the qso remnant mass ( salucci et al .",
    "1999 , monaco et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "the plan of this work is the following : in section 2 we set up the issue , in sections 3 and 4 we derive the mdo mass upper limits for late and early type spirals , in section 4 we investigate the bh mass vs bulge mass relationship for disk systems and in section 5 we derive the constraints for the cosmological mass function of spiral bh .",
    "it is worth to recall two definitions .",
    "given a distribution of mass and the related gravitational potential @xmath26 , the _ circular velocity _",
    "@xmath27 is defined as @xmath28 and for a point - like or a spherical distribution , the enclosed mass is given by @xmath29 .",
    "the _ rotation curve _",
    "@xmath30 is a set of centered , folded and de - projected recessional velocities considered as a function of their galactocentric radii .",
    "these two quantities are in principle different , in that observational errors , non - axisymmetric disturbances , disordered motions and a finite spatial resolution modify @xmath27 into a different curve .    in this paper",
    "we assume @xmath31 , and we take , as the reference magnitude in the i - band , @xmath32 ( which translates to @xmath33 in the b - band ( e.g. rhee , 1997 ) ) .",
    "no conclusion of this work depends on these choices .",
    "is the available kinematical data consistent with the centers of spirals being the host of the silent qso remnants , i.e. of the bh - powered engines that once radiated at the eddington rate ( see paper i ) ?    to introduce the data with which we will tackle this issue , we start from the 967 rotation curve of spirals recently published in ps95 , and notice that most of them trace the kinematics down to the central kpc ( ps95 , see also mfb ) .",
    "these rc s have an effective spatial resolution of @xmath34 , i.e. @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the galaxy systemic velocity .",
    "the range of @xmath36 is large : @xmath37 , so that many objects ( @xmath38 , see appendix a ) lie within a distance leading to a spatial resolution of @xmath39 or lesser , well sufficient to detect a qso remnants similar to those commonly found in ellipticals . as an example , in figure ( 1 ) we compare the innermost - kpc region of two typical rc s belonging to our high - resolution sample ( see below ) with the circular velocity of a test particle rotating around a central body of mass @xmath40 , corresponding to an average elliptical mdo mass . in order to produce the actual rotation curve ,",
    "the original circular velocity has been line - of - sight projected , seeing - convolved and pixel averaged ( here and throughout the paper ) following well - known prescriptions ( e.g. appendix d in qian et al .",
    "1995 ) . in detail , we convolve @xmath41 with a @xmath42 fwhm gaussian seeing and we process it by assuming an inclination of @xmath43 , a spatial resolution of @xmath42 perpendicular to the slit , and of @xmath44 along the slit , i.e. assuming values similar to those of the rc s of our samples ( see mfb )",
    ". furthermore ( conservatively ) @xmath45 .",
    "( no conclusion of this paper depends on which ( reasonable ) values are assumed for the above quantities . )    in figure 1 we show the resulting @xmath46 : we realize that , an average - mass , qso powering bh , situated in the center of these spirals , would be the major contributor to the rotation curve out to @xmath47 , i.e. 5 - 6 times their effective spatial resolution scale . therefore ,",
    "as we look for silent qso in spirals , ground - based kinematical observations are able to detect their massive remnants , if present .",
    "on the other hand , the large number of rc s in ps95/mfb sample provide the needed database to put this issue on a statistical basis .",
    "the available data amounts to about 800 ( @xmath48 , one for each arm ) measurements inside @xmath49 which refer to @xmath50 galaxies and four times more measurements inside @xmath51 .",
    "these data provide individual and synthetic rc s and , in turn , the circular velocities .",
    "the data - base for our investigation includes two sub - samples selected from the ps95 sample .",
    "more specifically , we select a sample , ( herafter the ind sample ) by including all the rotation curves that _ individually _ probe the mass distribution of the innermost @xmath52 and a sample ( hereafter the syn sample ) by including all the rotation curves that _ collectively _ form the _",
    "rotation curve of the innermost kpc ( see rubin 1982 , pss ) .",
    "the ind sample is built by selecting all ps95 rc s that fulfill the following criteria : ( _ i ) _ the rc has at least 4 measurements inside a radius of @xmath53 , _ ii ) _ the innermost velocity data is situated inside a radius of @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the i - band absolute magnitude .",
    "these criteria are a good compromise made in order to select a large sample of rotation curves equally distributed per magnitude interval , whilst at the same time being able to set very stringent upper limits to the mdo / bh mass .",
    "we find 83 rc s that result smooth , symmetric and with negligible non - circular disturbances ( see also ratnam and salucci , 1999 ) as it is also indicated by recent hst measurements ( erwin and sparke , 1999 ) .    the syn sample is built by selecting all the rc s in ps95 with at least one velocity data inside a radius of @xmath56 , except for the highest luminosity class , where we set @xmath57 .",
    "we found 158 rc s with ( 2 - 10 ) data velocities each , notice that we neglect all the ( few ) velocities at distances @xmath58 on both arms , because the kinematical symmetry center can not usually be determined with a precision better that @xmath59 ( see ps95 ) .",
    "to determine the upper limits for the spiral mdo masses we devise a dual ( individual / coadded ) multi - step strategy : _ 1 ) _ we prove that the mass distribution of a stellar disk ( plus occasionally that of a bulge ) generates a circular velocity @xmath60 that reproduces very well the observed innermost - kpc rc s and moreover , @xmath61 .",
    "_ 2 ) _ we hide the biggest possible central bh in these rc s by exploiting their r.m.s and the ( small ) discrepancies between the disk mass models and the observations .",
    "_ 3 ) _ we correct the derived mass upper limits for the effects of the finite spatial resolution .",
    "first , we derive this correction by following qian et al , ( 1995 ) . for a point - like object observed with setup similar to that of our rc s , to assume @xmath62 results incorrect by a non - negligible amount @xmath63 : @xmath64 ( see fig .",
    "( 1 ) ) and therefore it leads to underestimate the mdo mass by up to a factor @xmath65 . however , if the finite resolution effect would dominate , we should also find : @xmath66 .",
    "we observe , instead : @xmath67 that implies that the actual values of @xmath68 are smaller than the maximum one .",
    "this is because one fraction of @xmath69 originates from the diffuse stellar disk , which is free from above effect , @xmath70 and is has a positive log derivative @xmath71 , as the observed one . by applying to a disk+bh system the eqs .",
    "( 1)-(5 ) of ps90 we estimate that the fraction of @xmath72 due the ordinary diffuse matter is more than @xmath73 so that : @xmath74 .",
    "notice that , by assuming @xmath75 , no conclusion in this paper changes .",
    "then , the mdo mass upper limits are computed as @xmath76    where @xmath77 indicates the mdo - to - total mass fraction ( inside @xmath24 ) that can be hidden in the irregularities and/or in the r.m.s . of the rotation curves , and @xmath68 corrects for the depression of the circular velocity occurring when it is measured at a low spatial resolution .",
    "we reproduce the 83 rc s of the ind sample by means of two mass models , the first of which features : ( _ i ) _ a freeman disk of length - scale @xmath78 ( derived from photometry , ps95 ) and mass @xmath79 and ( _ ii ) _ a mdo of mass given by eq(1 ) , while the second one assumes @xmath80 . in fig .",
    "( 2 ) we show the best - fitting solution for the first 6 rc s of the ind sample relative to the @xmath80 ( only disk , od ) and @xmath81 ( disk+ black hole ) cases . more details and the plots relative to the entire sample are given in ratnam @xmath82 salucci ( 1999 ) .",
    "as result , the kinematics of the crucial innermost regions ( i.e. @xmath83 ) never shows a pure cbd rotation curve , neither a rc obviously influenced by a bh+resolution effects . on the contrary , all rc profiles strictly conform to those generated by a mass distribution proportional to the light distribution , as it is best recognized by noticing that , at @xmath84 , the values of the _ local _ rc slopes , @xmath85 are in good agreement with those of a freeman disk .    despite",
    "that the no - mdo model fits have excellent reduced chi - squares : @xmath86 and result systematically better than the disk+ mdo model fits , we take the latter solutions to determine the mdo mass upper limits .",
    "we obtain values of @xmath87 that , galaxy by galaxy , range between @xmath88 and @xmath89 . these lead to the mdo mass upper limits plotted in fig ( 3 ) as a function of galaxy luminosity .",
    "notice the main uncertainty in these estimates comes from errors in the assumed distances that may be as large as a factor 2 .",
    "observational errors and mass modeling uncertainties induce , in the estimated upper limits , at most a fractional uncertainty of @xmath73 , that is negligible in that the findings of this paper involve effects of the order of one magnitude or more .",

    "the mass model has no free parameters in the three least - luminous luminosity classes , and one free parameter , the bulge mass , in the remaining two .",

    "before we draw our conclusion let us point to appendix b where we show that we need a very small correction to eqs ( 1 ) in order to take into account the part of the gravitational attraction balanced by pressure gradients rather than pure rotation ; more specifically . in sb - im s the asymmetric drift term in the jeans equation is not a relevant fraction of the _ circular _ velocity and therefore the _ rotation _ velocity does not significantly underestimate the enclosed mass .    the upper limits on mdo s obtained from the ind and syn samples are very similar , though the methods employed are different and complementary . in detail ,",
    "the `` detection '' method used for the ind sample has a lower mass threshold and it probes each galaxy separately , while the one employied for the syn sample is negligibly affected by observational errors or galaxy peculiarities and it involves a larger statistics .",
    "as matter of fact , the luminosity - averaged values upper limits obtained for the ind sample ( see fig ( 2 ) ) turn out to be just @xmath140 smaller than those obtained for the syn sample ( shown in fig 6 ) .",
    "the global results are shown in fig.(6 ) : mdo s in spirals , if existing , are remarkably less massive than those detected in ellipticals : strict limits on their mass range between @xmath141 at @xmath142 to @xmath143 at @xmath144 . only in the very most luminous spirals ( i.e. @xmath145 ) , that amount to only few per thousand of the whole population , the upper limits reach @xmath146 ( barely ) allowing a qso powering mdo .",
    "sa galaxies are much less numerous than late type spirals , however , in view of their massive bulge , @xmath147 , they must be considered as a possible location for qso remnants . from an observational point of view",

    "we then include in the mass models a central mass component large enough to affect the innermost kinematics . by increasing the value of the mdo mass ,",
    "the models are progressively unable to reproduce the data until for a central mass value of @xmath179 , the model rotation curves become inconsistent with the coadded ones at a level @xmath180 ( with @xmath181 ) ( see fig.(7 ) ) .",

    "the bulge - to - disk mass ratio is given by @xmath191 where the multiplying term @xmath188 takes into account that bulges and disks have different stellar populations and therefore different stellar mass - to - light ratios in fact , the bulge mass - to - light ratios are higher than the disk by a factor @xmath192 ( van der marel 1996 ; pss ) .",
    "this , inserted in the above equation , yields to two limiting relationships between disk and bulge masses : @xmath193 and @xmath194 . for a number of objects with known bulge mass ,",
    "the mdo mass has been directly determined ( see ho , 1998 ) .",
    "this sample of six objects provides the crucial calibration of the mdo - bulge systematic in spirals .    in fig.(8 )",
    "we show the bulge - mdo mass relationship , namely with mdo upper limits for early and late type spirals and mdo determinations for spirals and ellipticals .",
    "both upper limits and actual detections show that mdos in early type spirals may follow the elliptical @xmath195 vs @xmath7 relationship ( paper i ) . on the other hand ,",
    "late type spirals , even conceding a direct proportionality between these masses , clearly show a lower zero - point of the mdo mass .",
    "notice , that the magorrian et al .",
    "( 1998 ) zero - point of the mdo mass vs bulge mass relationship implies a larger discrepancy between the values of mdo masses in ellipticals and spirals .    as a result , at a given bulge mass ,",
    "the mass of the central dark body depends on the hubble type of the host galaxy .",
    "thus , we are lead to conclude that the bulge mass does not play an _ exclusive _ role in `` determining '' the bh mass .",
    "where are the engines of the qso phase , i.e. where are the masses , as large as @xmath196 , of the bh remnants presently located ?",
    "recent observations suggest that every hot system hosts a central bh ( magorrian et al .",
    "1998 ) of mass of a few @xmath197 times the mass in stars . integrating the mdo upper limits over the spiral luminosity functions we obtain an upper limit for the cosmological density of mdos residing in spirals . assuming that galaxies distribute according to schecther luminosity functions @xmath198 , with the parameters given in paper i , we get : @xmath199 @xmath200 these limits must be compared with the cosmological bh mass density , as implied by the qso / agn accreted material , estimated to be as large as @xmath201 ( paper i ) .",
    "thus , the contribution to the shining phase of quasar due to bhs hosted in late type spirals is totally negligible .",
    "the role of spirals as bh hosts can be further elucidated by determining the mdo upper limits mass function ( ulmf ) , which can be obtained by convolving the spiral luminosity functions with the mdo mass limits as a function of the luminosity .",
    "inspection of figure ( 9 ) indicates that , while the qso / agn phenomenon implies the existence of a large number of bh s with a wide range of masses , @xmath202 , the inner kinematics of late type spirals , in agreement with the few detections available so far , specifies that these systems can be major hosts of bhs only for @xmath203 .",
    "notice that recent estimates seem indeed to indicate very low values for the bh masses in spirals ( colbert and mushotzky , 1999 )    thus , we can rule out the possibility that in the distant past cold stellar systems such as late type spirals hosted highly luminous qsos .",
    "the nuclei of these objects possibly host only minor activity , of which low luminosity seyferts and liners represent perhaps the `` last fires in the last galaxies '' .    outside these mass scales ( see fig .",
    "( 9 ) ) different hubble types must provide the location for the great majority of bh remnants .",
    "in particular , nuclei of the most luminous sa may contribute , with @xmath204 at the mass scale of @xmath205 , to the locations of the present population of dormant bhs once at the heart of the qso shining phase .",
    "in fact , at higher bh masses the number of sa hosts declines exponentially , while lower masses are outside of the qso phenomenon .",
    "what about for the hubble types with peculiar luminosity and/or central surface brightness ?",
    "mass models of dwarf ellipticals and rotation curves of dwarf spirals imply that in these objects the gravitating mass inside the innermost @xmath206 is @xmath207 ( salucci & persic 1997 ) ; lsb rotation curves , on the other hand , indicate that the gravitating mass within the innermost kpc is @xmath208 ( e.g. salucci and persic , 1997 ) .",
    "in addition , in these objects a diffuse dark matter component largely contributes to the `` central '' dark mass .",
    "thus , we can completely neglect these hubble types as host for dormant bh s in the qso - engine mass range .    a - fortiori , then",
    ", ellipticals and s0s remain the sole location for the qso remnants both for the common detection in the nuclei of these objects of very massive mdos and for the exclusion of all other galaxy types .",
    "this conclusion is supported by recent results obtained with hst , which show that all the qsos brighter than @xmath209 appear to reside in elliptical galaxies ( mclure et al .",
    "in fig ( 10 ) we show the distribution of kinematical distances for the ps95 sample .",
    "the scale is : @xmath210 .",
    "altough the presence of an axisymmetric drift , common at very low radii in early type galaxies ( e.g. kent 1988 ) , is unlikely in objects of later type types ( vega beltran and references therein , 1999 ) , it is worth to investigate its possible relevance on the rc s of our samples .",
    "_ ind sample _ the od mass model has just one free parameter , the disk mass , determined by the outer kinematics not affected by non - circular motions .",
    "therefore , in the case of no - central mdo , if , at @xmath24 , the axisymmetric drift dominates , we should detect a significant excess of the od circular velocity with respect to the observed value @xmath126 . since in the great majority of the 83 rcs",
    "the od prediction perfectly agrees with data , it is unlikely that , in each galaxy , the central object plot to exactly compensate the part of @xmath211 cut off by the axisymmetric drift .",
    "_ syn sample _ a set of exponential thin disk rc s of different length - scales @xmath78 ( in pc ) gives rise to a set of rc s , that , when estimated at a _ fixed _ radius ( e.g. @xmath212 ) , depend on @xmath78 as shown in figure 11 ( see pss and salucci and persic , 1999 for details ) .",
    "then , the observed velocity-@xmath78 relationship , ( see figure 11 ) , in perfect agreement with the above tully - fisher - like prediction , should be considered as a further coincidence , in the case of a systematic presence of a large axisymmetric drift effect .",
    "finally , we can use the above relationship to show that , at @xmath24 the rotation velocity is a good measure of the circular velocity : @xmath213 .",
    "we thank the referee for very useful suggestions that have improved this work .",
    "one of the authors c.r would like to thank the hospitality of ictp / sissa where this work was carried out .",
    "we thank ezio pignatelli for helpful discussion .",
