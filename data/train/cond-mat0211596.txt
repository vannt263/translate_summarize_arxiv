    "the flow equation method , introduced by gazek and wilson @xcite and independently by wegner,@xcite has become a powerful tool to analyze many - body systems in nuclear and solid - state physics.@xcite the method is based on the continuous mapping of a given hamiltonian on to its unitarily equivalent representations .",
    "this induces a flow of the system parameters which is governed by the so - called flow equations .",
    "the continuous transformations can be characterized by the anti - hermitian generator @xmath0 and the flow equations of the hamiltonian @xmath1 are then given by the differential form @xmath2 $ ] , @xmath3 denoting the flow parameter . the objective is to reach a simple fixed point hamiltonian for @xmath4 .",
    "the flow equations for many - body hamiltonians are non - linear , integro - differential equations and in general analytically non - approachable .",
    "yet , it is possible to analyze the asymptotic behavior as was done for the spin - boson model@xcite as well as for an electron - phonon model.@xcite it was found that the asymptotic behavior of a given energy scale @xmath5 generally leads to @xmath6 , with @xmath7 and @xmath8 denoting a dimensionless constant.@xcite so far , @xmath0 has been chosen such that @xmath9 was finite and the asymptotic fixed point hamiltonian has thus been characterized by this renormalized energy scale .    in this paper",
    "we want to apply the flow equation technique to dissipative systems .",
    "the general hamiltonian then consists of a system hamiltonian @xmath10 with energy scale @xmath11 , a bath hamiltonian @xmath12 , and the interaction term @xmath13 .",
    "instead of integrating out the bath degrees of freedom and thus reducing the effective configuration space , the flow equation method performs a sequence of infinitesimal unitary transformations with the objective that the interaction between the system and the bath becomes zero , i.e. @xmath14 .",
    "this is done systematically by first `` rotating away '' interaction terms which connect states with high energy differences . if @xmath9 is finite , the interaction between the system and the environment is thus transformed away in the following way : first decoupling the high - energy modes of the bath , then proceeding with decoupling the low - energy modes and in the end decoupling nearly degenerate states around the renormalized energy scale @xmath15 .",
    "whereas in the first two regimes the coupling constants decrease exponentially as functions of @xmath3 , the coupling constant belonging to the renormalized energy scale @xmath9 follows an algebraic decay according to @xmath16 , see ref . .",
    "in order to evaluate spectral properties within the flow equation approach , observables need to be subjected to the same sequence of unitary transformations .",
    "this leads to flow equations for observables and the observable flow follows the systematic decoupling procedure of the hamiltonian , i.e. the correlation function is first built up for high and low energies and the intermediate energy regime around @xmath9 is determined at last .",
    "flow equations are more stable for @xmath3-values far away from degeneracies .",
    "this means that the regime which comprises most spectral weight is determined by flow equations which are the most unstable . in case of the spin - boson model , kehrein and mielke",
    "circumvent this problem by mapping the asymptotic flow of the spin - boson model onto the asymptotic flow of the exactly solvable dissipative harmonic oscillator.@xcite they thus integrated the flow equations numerically up to some finite @xmath17 and then employed a conservation law which was derived for the exactly solvable model .",
    "nevertheless , this mapping was restricted to a certain parameter regime@xcite and might not be applied to other , more general dissipative models .    in this paper , we will set up flow equations with a different asymptotic behavior .",
    "the crucial point is that the fixed point hamiltonian @xmath18 does not contain any characteristic renormalized energy scale , i.e. @xmath19 and @xmath20 is thus just given by the non - interacting bath . as a consequence ,",
    "the system is monotonously decoupled from the bath , starting from high - energy modes and finishing with the low - energy modes .",
    "but it also implies that the fixed point hamiltonian does not contain any other information but the ground - state energy .",
    "if the physical renormalized energy scale is denoted by @xmath21 , the flow equations do not yield @xmath22 as before .",
    "all physical information is transferred on to the observable flow .",
    "the asymptotic behavior of the hamiltonian is passed on to the observable flow as before .",
    "since the asymptotic flow equations deal with the decoupling of the low - energy modes , the asymptotic behavior of the observable will determine the low - energy regime of correlation functions .",
    "the low - energy regime of dissipative systems is generally determined by universal power - laws .",
    "we thus find the connection between universal flow equations and universal spectral properties .",
    "we will further set up a conservation law , based on asymptotic , scale - invariant spectral functions , which will allow us to halt the numerical integration after some finite value @xmath17 . like this",
    ", we also obtain analytical results for the low energy behavior of correlation functions .",
    "the procedure should not be restricted to specific models as before .",
    "there are other advantages of flow equations which lead to a trivial fixed point hamiltonian only consisting of the free bath .",
    "first , one can easily include a logarithmic grid around @xmath23 to increase the numerical precision while decoupling almost degenerate states .",
    "second , the spectrum of a dissipative system at low coupling@xcite is generally that of the free bath , consisting of a ground - state and a gap - less continuum.@xcite unitary transformations do not alter the spectrum , but if the fixed point hamiltonian consisted of the system with the renormalized energy scale @xmath24 plus the free bath , the continuous spectrum of the bath would be superposed by the discrete spectrum of the system .",
    "universal asymptotic behavior thus also guarantees the correct spectrum .",

    "ii , we will treat the exactly solvable dissipative harmonic oscillator .",
    "we will first summarize the analytic solution of kehrein and mielke in a comprised form and then introduce and discuss universal asymptotic behavior .",

    "iii , we will consider the spin - boson model for two different truncation schemes . in sec .",
    "iiia , we investigate flow equations stemming from a form - invariant truncation , i.e. no additional coupling terms are generated .",
    "this will allow a direct comparison with the results of the dissipative harmonic oscillator , but will yield rather poor results for dynamical correlation functions . in sec .",
