    "the magnetic fields that are observed in galaxies and galaxy clusters are believed to result from the dynamo amplification of weak magnetic field seeds , whose origin remains a mystery .",
    "intergalactic magnetic fields ( igmfs ) , deep in the voids between galaxies , provide the most accurate image of the weak primordial seed fields and could be linked to the early stages in the evolution of the universe ( see e.g. @xcite for a recent review ) . among the several methods used to study cosmological magnetic fields",
    "( see e.g.@xcite for a recent review ) , the observation ( or nondetection ) of cascade emission from blazars can potentially measure very weak igmfs .",
    "a number of blazars have been observed to emit both very - high - energy ( vhe , @xmath5 gev ) @xmath0-rays with ground - based @xmath0-ray instruments and high - energy ( he , mev / gev ) @xmath0-rays with the fermi gamma - ray space telescope @xcite .",
    "most of the detected tev @xmath0-rays are from the nearest sources since such high energy @xmath0-rays can not propagate over long distances in intergalactic space due to interactions with the extragalactic background light ( ebl ) .",
    "of course , some higher - redshift sources still have detectable tev emission ( e.g. blazar pks1424 + 240 , which has redshift lower limit of @xmath6 @xcite ) , but with highly absorbed spectra consistent with theoretical calculations of the attenuation by the ebl .",
    "these interactions of tev @xmath0-rays with the ebl produce electron - positron pairs that subsequently are cooled by inverse compton ( ic ) interactions with the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , ultimately leading to gev @xmath0-ray emission from these pair cascades .",
    "since magnetic fields deflect the electron - positron pairs changing the angular distribution of cascade emission , searches for extended gev emission around blazars can provide an avenue for constraining the igmf .",
    "due to the low gev @xmath0-ray flux from extragalactic sources , it is difficult to examine the angular extent of the photon events from a single blazar or even to assess the joint likelihood for detailed fits to a set of individual sources where individual source parameters are taken to be completely independent . to overcome this limitation , stacking sources has been used to make such statistical analysis feasible . despite early hints at a signal in the stacking analysis of 170 brightest active galactic nuclei ( agns ) using 11-month fermi observations @xcite , by comparing with the gev emission from the crab nebula [ which is essentially a point source for the fermi large area telescope ( fermi - lat ) ] , a. neronov et al .",
    "@xcite found no significant evidence of extended emission and argued that the apparent excess could be attributed to an underestimation of the real psf @xcite . a subsequent analysis by ackermann et al .",
    "@xcite comparing an updated psf to one hundred stacked bl lac agns did not find any statistically significant halo - emission either .",
    "the cascade emission from individual blazars has also been studied by modeling the intrinsic tev spectra and adopting ebl and cosmological microwave background ( cmb ) models ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "delays in arrival time of the cascade emission were used to explain the non - dectection of several tev sources in fermi energy , and to derive a lower bound of the igmf strength ( e.g. @xmath7 in @xcite ) .",
    "the angular extent of the cascade signals caused by igmfs above @xmath8 also provided an explanation for the non - detection of tev sources 1es 0229 + 200 and 1es0347 - 121 by fermi @xcite .",
    "w. essey et al .",
    "reported a possible _ measurement _ of igmfs in the range @xmath9@xcite based on the tev - gev spectra .",
    "very recently , a study of 1es0347 - 121 spectral energy distribution ( sed ) provided an igmf estimation of @xmath10 @xcite . fitting to tev data from , e.g. , veritas and hess , such studies yielded detailed predictions of the cascade emission , but invariably made assumptions about the sources , e.g. the relationship of the long - term tev emission to measurement of a few flares .",
    "the upper bound of the igmf strength with correlation length above @xmath11 mpc is below @xmath12 constrained by the non - detection of the large scale cmb anisotropies , and is given to be @xmath13 by the galaxy cluster simulation , as summarized in @xcite .",
    "the likely range of the igmf strength from previous studies is given from @xmath14 to @xmath13 .",
    "as the energies of the primary @xmath0-rays increase , the pair production occurs closer to the source , reducing the angular size of the cascade .",
    "depending on the strength of the igmf and the redshift of the source , the highest energy emission might not be resolved by the fermi psf .",
    "while at lower energies ( especially for the nearest sources ) , the emission may be too diffuse to be readily detected .",
    "it follows that only a few blazars would have cascade emission that can be statistically detected through their angular profiles .    in our study",
    ", we combine data from 24 isolated high - synchrotron - peaked ( hsp ) bl lacs which are _ a - priori _ selected to provide the best prospects for detection and adequate photon counting statistics .",
    "both frequentist likelihood ratio test ( lrt ) statistics and bayes factors are evaluated for estimating the pair halo parameters ( the angular size and halo fraction ) , which consequently provide the possible range of igmf strength .",
    "we use the fermi - lat pass 7 reprocessed data through february 2014 : source class front - converted photon events are binned into four logarithmically spaced energy ranges to roughly equalize counts ( see table [ tab:1 ] ) .",
    "the source candidates are selected from the agn associated sources in the fermi - lat high - energy catalog ( 1fhl @xcite ) .",
    "the regions of the galactic disk and fermi bubbles are excluded to avoid anisotropic background emission @xcite .",
    "data is also divided into angular bins to provide adequate statistics .",
    "source bins of equal solid angle are set around the direction of the source , surrounded by a larger background bin with an outer boundary of @xmath15 . to reduce systematic errors from nearby sources , we require that no nearby sources ( those bright enough to appear in the 2fgl catalog ) are within @xmath16 of the stacked sources and correct for the impact of any remaining nearby sources by defining an exclusion region of radius @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) about these sources",
    "; we account for these exclusion regions by assuming that the signal and background effective area is reduced in proportion to the excluded solid angle .",

    "following the discussion in a. neronov and d. v. semikoz @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , we derive the typical angular size of a pair halo as a function of the observed energy of cascade photons @xmath20 , the typical redshift of the source @xmath21 , and the igmf strength @xmath22 at the present epoch , given by @xmath23^{-2}\\left(\\frac{e_\\gamma}{100\\mathrm{gev}}\\right)^{-1}\\left(\\frac{b_0}{10^{-16}\\mathrm{g}}\\right)\\left[\\frac{d_\\gamma(e_\\gamma , z_s)}{d_s(z_s)}\\right ] ,      \\label{eq : s1}\\ ] ] the basic geometry of propagation of the direct and cascade @xmath0-rays from the source to the observer ( see fig . 3 in @xcite )",

    "assuming that the correlation length of the igmf @xmath28 is much greater than the mean free path for ic scattering @xmath29 , @xmath27 can be estimated as the ratio of @xmath29 and the larmor radius of electron @xmath30 in the magnetic field , which are given by @xmath31 @xmath32 where we assumed that the pair produced electron / positron has half the energy of the initial photon , @xmath33 .",
