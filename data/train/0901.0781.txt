    "it is important to distinguish  static \" structure functions which are computed directly from the light - front wavefunctions of a target hadron from the nonuniversal  dynamic \" empirical structure functions which take into account rescattering of the struck quark in deep inelastic lepton scattering .",
    "[ see fig .",
    "[ figstatdyn ] . ] the real wavefunctions underlying static structure functions can not describe diffractive deep inelastic scattering nor single - spin asymmetries , since such phenomena involve the complex phase structure of the @xmath0 amplitude .",
    "one can augment the light - front wavefunctions with a gauge link corresponding to an external field created by the virtual photon @xmath1 pair current  @xcite , but such a gauge link is process dependent  @xcite , so the resulting augmented wavefunctions are not universal . @xcite .",
    "a remarkable feature of deep inelastic lepton - proton scattering at hera is that approximately 10% events are diffractive  @xcite : the target proton remains intact , and there is a large rapidity gap between the proton and the other hadrons in the final state .",
    "the presence of a rapidity gap between the target and diffractive system requires that the target remnant emerges in a color - singlet state ; this is made possible in any gauge by soft rescattering .",
    "the multiple scattering of the struck parton via instantaneous interactions in the target generates dominantly imaginary diffractive amplitudes , giving rise to an effective `` hard pomeron '' exchange .",
    "the resulting diffractive contributions leave the target intact and do not resolve its quark structure ; thus there are contributions to the dis structure functions which can not be interpreted as parton probabilities  @xcite ; the leading - twist contribution to dis from rescattering of a quark in the target is thus a coherent effect which is not included in the light - front wavefunctions computed in isolation .",
    "the shadowing of nuclear structure functions arises from destructive interference between multi - nucleon amplitudes involving diffractive dis and on - shell intermediate states with a complex phase .",
    "the physics of rescattering and nuclear shadowing is not included in the nuclear light - front wavefunctions , and a probabilistic interpretation of the nuclear dis cross section is precluded .",
    "antishadowing of nuclear structure functions is also observed in deep inelastic lepton - nucleus scattering .",
    "empirically , one finds @xmath2 in the domain @xmath3 ; _ i.e. _ , the measured nuclear structure function ( referenced to the deuteron ) is larger than than the scattering on a set of @xmath4 independent nucleons .",
    "ivan schmidt , jian - jun yang , and i  @xcite have extended the analysis of nuclear shadowing to the shadowing and antishadowing of the electroweak structure functions .",
    "we note that there are leading - twist diffractive contributions @xmath5 arising from reggeon exchanges in the @xmath6-channel  @xcite .",
    "for example , isospin  non - singlet @xmath7 reggeons contribute to the difference of proton and neutron structure functions , giving the characteristic kuti - weisskopf @xmath8 behavior at small @xmath9 .",
    "the @xmath9 dependence of the structure functions reflects the regge behavior @xmath10 of the virtual compton amplitude at fixed @xmath11 and @xmath12 the phase of the diffractive amplitude is determined by analyticity and crossing to be proportional to @xmath13 for @xmath14 which together with the phase from the glauber cut , leads to _ constructive _ interference of the diffractive and nondiffractive multi - step nuclear amplitudes .",
    "the nuclear structure function is predicted to be enhanced precisely in the domain @xmath15 where antishadowing is empirically observed .",
    "the strength of the reggeon amplitudes is fixed by the fits to the nucleon structure functions , so there is little model dependence .",
    "quarks of different flavors will couple to different reggeons ; this leads to the remarkable prediction that nuclear antishadowing is not universal ; it depends on the quantum numbers of the struck quark .",
    "this picture implies substantially different antishadowing for charged and neutral current reactions , thus affecting the extraction of the weak - mixing angle @xmath16 .",
    "we find that part of the anomalous nutev result  @xcite for @xmath16 could be due to the non - universality of nuclear antishadowing for charged and neutral currents .",
    "in fact , schienbein et al .",
    "@xcite have recently given a comprehensive analysis of charged current deep inelastic neutrino - iron scattering , finding significant differences with the nuclear corrections for electron - iron scattering .",
    "diffractive multi - jet production in heavy nuclei provides a novel way to resolve the shape of light - front fock state wavefunctions and test color transparency  @xcite .",
    "for example , consider the reaction  @xcite .",
    "@xmath17 at high energy where the nucleus @xmath18 is left intact in its ground state .",
    "the transverse momenta of the jets balance so that @xmath19 because of color transparency , the valence wavefunction of the pion with small impact separation will penetrate the nucleus with minimal interactions , diffracting into jet pairs  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath20 and @xmath21 dependence of the dijet distributions thus reflects the shape of the pion valence light - cone wavefunction in @xmath9 ; similarly , the @xmath22 relative transverse momenta of the jets gives key information on the second transverse momentum derivative of the underlying shape of the valence pion wavefunction  @xcite .",
    "the diffractive nuclear amplitude extrapolated to @xmath23 will be linear in nuclear number @xmath4 if color transparency is correct .",
    "the integrated diffractive rate will then scale as @xmath24 .",
    "this is in fact what has been observed by the e791 collaboration at fermilab for 500 gev incident pions on nuclear targets  @xcite .",
    "among the most interesting polarization effects are single - spin azimuthal asymmetries in semi - inclusive deep inelastic scattering , representing the correlation of the spin of the proton target and the virtual photon to hadron production plane : @xmath25 .",
    "such asymmetries are time - reversal odd , but they can arise in qcd through phase differences in different spin amplitudes .",
    "in fact , final - state interactions from gluon exchange between the outgoing quarks and the target spectator system lead to single - spin asymmetries ( ssas ) in semi - inclusive deep inelastic lepton - proton scattering which are not power - law suppressed at large photon virtuality @xmath11 at fixed @xmath26  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the ssas arising from transversity and the collins fragmentation function , the fragmentation of the quark into hadrons is not necessary ; one predicts a correlation with the production plane of the quark jet itself .",
    "physically , the final - state interaction phase arises as the infrared - finite difference of qcd coulomb phases for hadron wavefunctions with differing orbital angular momentum . the same proton matrix element which determines the spin - orbit correlation @xmath27 also produces the anomalous magnetic moment of the proton , the pauli form factor , and the generalized parton distribution @xmath28 which is measured in deeply virtual compton scattering .",
    "thus the contribution of each quark current to the ssa is proportional to the contribution @xmath29 of that quark to the proton target s anomalous magnetic moment @xmath30  @xcite .",
    "the ssa in the drell - yan process is the same as that obtained in sidis , with the appropriate identification of variables , but with the opposite sign .",
    "if both the quark and antiquark in the initial state of the drell - yan subprocess @xmath31 interact with the spectators of the other incident hadron , one finds a breakdown of the lam - tung relation , which was formerly believed to be a general prediction of leading - twist qcd .",
    "these double initial - state interactions also lead to a @xmath32 planar correlation in unpolarized drell - yan reactions  @xcite .",
    "as noted by collins and qiu  @xcite , the traditional factorization formalism of perturbative qcd for high transverse momentum hadron production fails in detail even at the lhc because of initial- and final - state rescattering .",
    "an important signal for factorization breakdown is a @xmath32 planar correlation in dijet production .",
    "the probability for fock states of a light hadron such as the proton to have an extra heavy quark pair decreases as @xmath33 in non - abelian gauge theory  @xcite .",
    "the relevant matrix element is the cube of the qcd field strength @xmath34 in contrast to qed where the relevant operator is @xmath35 and the probability of intrinsic heavy leptons in an atomic state is suppressed as @xmath36 the maximum probability occurs at @xmath37 where @xmath38 ; _ i.e. _ , when the constituents have minimal invariant mass and equal rapidity . thus the heaviest constituents have the highest momentum fractions and the highest @xmath39 .",
    "intrinsic charm thus predicts that the charm structure function has support at large @xmath26 in excess of dglap extrapolations  @xcite ; this is in agreement with the emc measurements  @xcite .",
    "intrinsic charm can also explain the @xmath40 puzzle  @xcite .",
    "it also affects the extraction of suppressed ckm matrix elements in @xmath41 decays  @xcite .",
    "the dissociation of the intrinsic charm @xmath42 fock state of the proton can produce a leading heavy quarkonium state at high @xmath43 in @xmath44 since the @xmath45 and @xmath46 can readily coalesce into the charmonium state . since the constituents of a given intrinsic heavy - quark fock state tend to have the same rapidity , coalescence of multiple partons from the projectile fock state into charmed hadrons and mesons is also favored . for example , one can produce a leading @xmath47 at high @xmath48 and low @xmath49 from the coalescence of the @xmath50 constituents of the projectile @xmath42 fock state . in the case of a nuclear target",
    ", the charmonium state will be produced at small transverse momentum and high @xmath48 with a characteristic @xmath51 nuclear dependence since the color - octet color - octet @xmath52 fock state interacts on the front surface of the nuclear target  @xcite .",
    "this forward contribution is in addition to the @xmath53 contribution derived from the usual perturbative qcd fusion contribution at small @xmath54 because of these two components , the cross section violates perturbative qcd factorization for hard inclusive reactions  @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with the observed two - component cross section for charmonium production observed by the na3 collaboration at cern  @xcite and more recent experiments  @xcite .",
    "the diffractive dissociation of the intrinsic charm fock state leads to leading charm hadron production and fast charmonium production in agreement with measurements  @xcite .",
    "the hadroproduction cross sections for double - charm @xmath55 baryons at selex  @xcite and the production of @xmath56 pairs at na3 are be consistent with the diffractive dissociation and coalescence of double ic fock states  @xcite .",
    "these observations provide compelling evidence for the diffractive dissociation of complex off - shell fock states of the projectile and contradict the traditional view that sea quarks and gluons are always produced perturbatively via dglap evolution .",
    "it is also conceivable that the observations  @xcite of @xmath57 at high @xmath48 at the isr in high energy @xmath58 collisions could be due to the dissociation and coalescence of the  intrinsic bottom \" @xmath59 fock states of the proton . as emphasized by lai , tung , and pumplin  @xcite , there are indications that the structure functions used to model charm and bottom quarks in the proton at large @xmath26 have been underestimated , since they ignore intrinsic heavy quark fluctuations of hadron wavefunctions .",
    "goldhaber , kopeliovich , schmidt , soffer , and i  @xcite have proposed a novel mechanism for exclusive diffractive higgs production @xmath60 and nondiffractive higgs production in which the higgs boson carries a significant fraction of the projectile proton momentum .",
    "the production mechanism is based on the subprocess @xmath61 where the @xmath62 in the @xmath63 intrinsic heavy quark fock state has up to @xmath64 of the projectile protons momentum .",
    "this mechanism provides a clear experimental signal for higgs production at the lhc due to the small background in this kinematic region .",
    "it is conventional to assume that leading - twist subprocesses dominate measurements of high @xmath49 hadron production at rhic energies . indeed",
    "the measured cross section for direct photon fragmentation @xmath65 is consistent with @xmath66 as expected for the fixed-@xmath67 scaling of the @xmath68 leading - twist subprocess  @xcite .",
    "however , the measured fixed-@xmath67 scaling for proton production at rhic is anomalous : phenix reports @xmath69 .",
    "a review of this data is given by tannenbaum  @xcite .",
    "one can understand the anomalous scaling if a higher - twist subprocess  @xcite where the proton is made _ directly _ within the hard reaction , such as @xmath70 and @xmath71 , dominates the reaction @xmath72 at rhic energies .",
    "the dominance of direct subprocesses is possible since the fragmentation of gluon or quark jets to baryons requires that the 2 to 2 subprocess occurs at much higher transverse momentum than the @xmath49 of observed proton because of the fast - falling @xmath73 quark - to - proton fragmentation function .",
    "thus the initial quark and gluon distributions have to be evaluated at higher @xmath9 in leading twist fragmentation reactions compared to direct processes .",
    "direct \" reactions can readily explain the fast - falling power - law falloff observed at fixed @xmath67 and fixed-@xmath74 observed at the isr , fermilab and rhic .",
    "furthermore , the protons produced directly within the hard subprocess emerge as small - size color - transparent colored states which are not absorbed in the nuclear target .",
    "in contrast , pions produced from jet fragmentation have the normal cross section .",
    "this provides a plausible explanation of the rhic data ,  @xcite which shows a dramatic rise of the @xmath75 ratio at high @xmath49 and a higher value for @xmath76 at fixed @xmath67 when one compares peripheral with central ( full overlap ) heavy ion collisions .",
    "the directly produced protons are not absorbed , but the pions are diminished in the nuclear medium .",
