    "after discovery of the conspicuous radial velocity ( rv ) pulsational variations in a sample of rapidly oscillating magnetic peculiar ( roap ) stars ( kanaan & hatzes , savanov , malanushenko & ryabchikova , kochukhov & ryabchikova for @xmath0  equ ; baldry et al . , baldry & bedding , kochukhov & ryabchikova for @xmath1  cirand hd  83368 ) , attempts to search for magnetic field variations over the pulsational period have been made .",
    "first , hubrig et al .",
    "@xcite tried to measure pulsational variability of the longitudinal magnetic field @xmath2  in six roap stars .",
    "their sample included @xmath0  equ   probably one of the most favourable stars for this kind of investigation .",
    "equ  is a bright northern roap star with a strong magnetic field , and with one of the largest pulsational rv amplitudes which exceeds 1000  ms@xmath3  in individual spectral lines .",
    "the extremely slow rotation of @xmath0  equ , leading to very sharp spectral lines , makes this star the best candidate for any study of the pulsational variability in spectroscopy .",
    "hubrig et al .",
    "@xcite used low - resolution zeeman time - series observations and measured @xmath2   using hydrogen lines and unresolved blends of metal lines .",
    "they failed to detect any variability beyond the formal errors of their measurements which were 40100  g.    according to a coarse theoretical estimate made by hubrig et al .",
    "@xcite there should exist a linear relation between magnetic field variability over the pulsational cycle and the rv amplitudes . in roap",
    "stars the largest rv amplitudes are observed in the lines of first and second ions of rare - earth elements ( ree ) , while they are usually below measurement errors for the lines of iron group elements .",
    "thus , high - resolution spectroscopy and spectropolarimetry of selected ree spectral lines is a more promising tool for an investigation of possible rapid magnetic oscillations in roap stars . taking this into account leone &",
    "kurtz @xcite obtained a high - resolution ( r=115000 ) , high s / n time - series of observations of @xmath0  equ  with a circular polarization analyzer , and measured @xmath2  using four ndiii  lines .",
    "they reported the discovery of pulsational variations with amplitudes between 112 to 240  g and , more surprisingly , with discrepant phases of magnetic maximum for different ndiii  lines .",
    "leone & kurtz s result was based on only 18 time - resolved spectra .",
    "a year later kochukhov , ryabchikova & piskunov @xcite obtained a time - series of polarimetric observations of @xmath0  equ  with a smaller resolving power ( r=38000 ) , but acquired more than 200 spectra over 3 nights , more than compensating for lesser quality of individual spectra .",
    "kochukhov et al .",
    "@xcite used simultaneously 13 ndiii  lines for magnetic measurements which allowed them to achieve a substantial reduction of the error of the @xmath2  determinations .",
    "they did not confirm longitudinal field variability over the pulsational period in @xmath0  equand gave a conservative upper limit of @xmath440  g for the amplitude of pulsational modulation of @xmath2   determined from ndiii  lines .",
    "another attempt to search for possible rapid magnetic variability in @xmath0  equ  was made by savanov , musaev & bondar @xcite .",
    "they measured the surface magnetic field @xmath5  variations over the pulsational period using the feii6149.25    line observed in unpolarized light .",
    "due to a very simple zeeman pattern ( two equally separated @xmath6- and @xmath7-components ) this line is ideal for @xmath5  measurements ( see mathys et al . ) .",
    "savanov et al .",
    "reported a 1.8@xmath7 detection of @xmath5  variability with an amplitude of 99@xmath853  g. at the same time they did not find periodic variations of rv measured for the individual zeeman resolved components of the feii6149.25    doublet exceeding their error limit ( 100120  ms@xmath3 ) .",
    "the authors used high - resolution r=120000 time - series observations , but the s / n of a single spectrum did not exceed 4060 .",
    "clearly , the result of savanov et al .",
    "@xcite is marginal and needs to be confirmed or rejected with data of better quality .    in this paper",
    "we present the results of a new search for pulsational variations of @xmath5  in @xmath0  equ  using high - resolution and high s / n time - resolved observations of this star .",
    "these observational data allowed us to obtain precise measurements of the magnetic field in @xmath0  equ , and strongly constrain possible changes of @xmath5   over the pulsation cycle of the star .",
    "the time - resolved observations of @xmath0  equ  were obtained using the single - order @xmath9 gecko coud spectrograph with the eev1 ccd at the 3.6-m canada - france - hawaii telescope .",
    "table  [ tbl1 ] gives details of this spectroscopic time - series dataset .",
    "the spectra cover approximately the spectral window 61046194   .",
    "this wavelength interval contains two zeeman resolved lines , feii  6149.25    and fei  6173.34   .",
    "it also has strong ndiii  and priiilines , optimal for investigation of pulsational variability of roap stars , as well as strong and weak lines of other elements such as si , ca , cr , and ba .",
    "the spectra were reduced using standard iraf tasks .",
    "each stellar , flat and calibration frame had a mean bias subtracted and was then cleaned of cosmic ray hits and extracted to one dimension .",
    "extracted stellar spectra were divided by an extracted mean flat field , and the continuum was fit with a third - order legendre polynomial , using the same rejection parameters for all spectra so that the continuum fit is as uniform as possible .",
    "the wavelength scale was established using about 40 lines of a thar emission lamp , resulting in an rms scatter about the adopted pixel - wavelength polynomial ( a sixth - order legendre polynomial ) of about @xmath10  .",
    "the wavelength scale was linearly interpolated between thar lamp spectra taken before and after the stellar series , but the spectra were not resampled to a linear wavelength spacing . in this paper",
    "we also used 31 very high resolution time - resolved observations of @xmath0  equ  analysed by kochukhov & ryabchikova @xcite .",
    "these time - resolved data were obtained with the coud echelle spectrograph ( ces ) , fiber - linked to the cassegrain focus of the eso 3.6-m telescope .",
    "the highest resolution ces image slicer and the eso ccd#38 were used , allowing us to reach a resolving power of @xmath11 and record spectra in the 61406165  wavelength interval .",

    "as a first step in our analysis of @xmath0  equ  we computed synthetic spectra in the region of the zeeman resolved iron lines feii  6149.25    and fei6173.34     ( hereafter we refer to these spectral features simply as the feii  and fei  lines ) using abundances , fe stratification and model atmosphere from the study of ryabchikova et al .",
    "synthetic spectra of @xmath0  equ  were calculated with the code ( piskunov  ) , modified to take into account vertical stratification of chemical abundances .",
    "the simplest model , with a constant magnetic field over the stellar surface , was adopted .",
    "the splitting pattern of the fei  line is a pure zeeman triplet with unshifted central @xmath6-component and two @xmath7-components . to fit the relative intensity of the @xmath6- and @xmath7-components of this line the magnetic field vectors in our model have to be inclined by @xmath18 to the stellar surface . to look more carefully at the blending effects we took into account the hyperfine structure of nearby laii  6172.72    and euii  6173.03   .",
    "an unidentified line at @xmath19  6148.85   , which shows a pulsational behaviour typical for ree lines , was synthesized with arbitrary atomic parameters to take into account its possible blending of the blue - shifted feii  component .    the comparison of these calculations with the average cfht spectrum is presented in fig .  [ fig1 ] .",
    "this figure shows that the feii  line is free from significant blends , which enables accurate pulsational analysis of both the red and blue components of this zeeman doublet .",
    "in particular , we found that pulsational variability of the 6148.85    feature has negligible influence on the measurements of the blue component of the feii  line . on the other hand ,",
    "the blue @xmath7-component of the fei  line is blended by the euii 6173.03    and hence is not suitable for time - resolved measurements of @xmath5 .",
    "consequently , rv analysis and field modulus measurements using the fei  line were based on the @xmath6- and red @xmath7-component .",
    "we determined the time - dependent position of the centres of zeeman components using centre - of - gravity measurements within the spectral regions indicated in fig .",
    "we note that an alternative technique of fitting a superposition of three gaussian profiles to the 6148.85    and feii  line represents a better way to derive @xmath5  from _ time - averaged _ spectra because it allows to model partially resolved feii  components and remove the blending contribution of the 6148.85    feature .",
    "however , this method may encounter difficulties in describing _ time - resolved _ profiles of ree lines , including the 6148.85    line , which show substantial rv shifts and exhibit profile asymmetries associated with non - radial pulsation velocity field . consequently",
    ", we prefer to use the centre - of - gravity technique throughout this paper and show the gaussian fitting results in figs .",
    "[ fig2][fig4 ] for comparison purpose only .",
    "the rv obtained from the iron lines were compared with the outstanding pulsational variation seen in the ndiii  6145.07    line .",
    "this feature allows us to verify the presence of rapid spectroscopic variability during our observations of @xmath0  equ  and to determine the oscillation period and amplitude with high accuracy . for each available dataset we established the period of the spectroscopic pulsational variation using this ndiii  line and",
    "then fitted the phase ( counted from the start hjd , see table  [ tbl1 ] ) and the amplitude of the fe rv measurements using a non - linear least - squares technique .",
    "results of this analysis are summarized in table  [ tbl2 ] .",
    "we do not find any pulsational variation of the rv determined for the zeeman resolved components of the fe lines exceeding about 510  ms@xmath3for the feii  and @xmath20  ms@xmath3  for the fei  line .",
    "the measurements of the feii  line reported in table  [ tbl2 ] supersede tentative rv amplitude of 64  ms@xmath3  given by kochukhov & ryabchikova @xcite , who used the same ces dataset as studied here .",
    "this difference mainly comes from the fact that in the present paper we adopt a fixed pulsation period ( @xmath21  min ) for the analysis of the individual feii  zeeman components , while a set of four photometric periods was tested in our previous paper and the corresponding maximum rv amplitude for @xmath22  min and for the whole line was reported .",
    "the measurements of the line centre positions were converted to surface field using the expression : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the half of the wavelength difference between the red and blue zeeman components of the feii  line or the distance between the red @xmath7- and the @xmath6-component of the fei  line , @xmath25  is the mean land factor and @xmath26 is the laboratory wavelength of a line .",
    "based on the information available from the vald database ( kupka et al . )",
    "we adopted @xmath27 and 1.35 for the fei  and feii  lines respectively .",
    "the internal precision of our magnetic measurements is estimated to be @xmath2810  g for the feiiline and @xmath470  g for the weaker fei  line . at the same time",
    "the average field strengths derived from the two lines are substantially different in the cfht spectra : centre - of - gravity measurements of the feii  line give @xmath29  g ( @xmath30  g is obtained with multiple fit of three gaussians ) , while @xmath31  g ( @xmath32",
    "g ) is derived using the weaker fei  line .",
    "this @xmath33  g difference is confirmed by the spectrum synthesis .",
    "the discrepant @xmath5  might be related to inaccuracy of the tabulated land factors , or it could be real and reflect different horizontal and/or vertical formation regions of the two diagnostic lines , or the effects of saturation in the feii  line .",
    "an average field strength of @xmath34  g ( @xmath35  g ) was obtained from the feii  line in the eso spectra of @xmath0  equ .",

    "[ fig2][fig4 ] present results of our time - series analysis of the surface field measurements .",
    "we see absolutely no evidence for any magnetic variations during the pulsation cycle in @xmath0  equ .",
    "formal results of the least - squares fits with a fixed pulsation period as derived from the ndiiiline indicate insignificant amplitudes , all below 10  g. our most precise time - resolved magnetic measurements are derived from the cfht dataset .",
    "analysis of the 6149.25    line in these spectra results in formal @xmath5  amplitude of just @xmath41  g , with the highest noise peaks in the amplitude spectrum ( fig .",
    "[ fig3]d ) not exceeding 5  g over the whole period domain typical for roap pulsations .",
    "a 3@xmath7 upper limit of the amplitude of magnetic variability was estimated from monte carlo simulations by sampling a sinusoidal signal at the phases of our observations and adding a random noise , characteristic of the scatter of the @xmath5  measurements .",
    "this rigorous statistical estimate is reported in table  [ tbl3 ] and indicates that , at the 3@xmath7 confidence level , no magnetic variability with the amplitude @xmath385  g is seen in @xmath0  equ  during the night of our cfht observation .",
    "our time - resolved magnetic measurements of @xmath0  equ  have achieved the highest precision for a roap star , but reveal no evidence of pulsational modulation of the field strength .",
    "we constrain possible magnetic variability to be below @xmath45  g in fe lines .",
    "these results suggest that the marginal detection of @xmath4100  g @xmath5  variability during the pulsation cycle reported in @xmath0  equ  by savanov et al .",
    "@xcite is spurious , and probably stems from insufficient precision of the @xmath5  measurements in that study .",
    "the null result reported in the present paper complements non - detection of the pulsational variability of @xmath2  determined from ndiii  lines ( kochukhov et al . ) .",
    "it should be recalled that the fe lines studied in our paper and the ree lines showing strong pulsational rv modulation are formed at substantially different atmospheric depths due to the extreme stratification of chemical abundances in cool ap stars and in @xmath0  equ  in particular .",
    "stratification analysis presented by ryabchikova et al .",
    "@xcite allows us to conclude that ndiii  lines sample very high atmospheric layers with optical depths @xmath39 , while the fe lines are formed below @xmath40 . the striking difference in the rv amplitudes of fe and ndiii  lines",
    "is then attributed to an outward increase of pulsational amplitude by roughly a factor of 50100 .",
    "this increase is none the less not accompanied by an increase or even the presence of any observable oscillations of the magnetic field structure . combining the results of this paper with the study of kochukhov et al .",
    "@xcite , and taking into account that for @xmath0  equ@xmath41 , we find that at all observed atmospheric depths @xmath5changes by less than about @xmath42  g per ms@xmath3  of corresponding velocity oscillations .",
    "hence , possible magnetic variability is constrained to be below 1% of the field strength .",
    "we note that @xmath0  equ  is distinguished among the roap stars by its strong magnetic field , sharp lines and the exceptionally high amplitude of pulsational line profile changes .",
    "yet this star defies any attempts to detect magnetic variability with pulsation phase .",
    "this suggests that rapid magnetic modulation may be even more difficult to detect in other roap pulsators .",
    "the outcome of our monitoring of @xmath2  and @xmath5  in @xmath0  equ  demonstrates that very accurate measurements of the zeeman resolved lines can yield more precise magnetic time - series compared with the polarimetric @xmath2  observations .",
    "therefore , the most promising direction for future attempts to detect magnetic oscillations in @xmath0  equ  ( which are in any case unlikely to exceed a few tens of gauss ) would be to observe those ndii , ndiii  and priii  lines which are characterized by large pulsational rv shifts and at the same time show zeeman resolved profiles .",
    "unfortunately , the extra broadening of the pulsating lines ( see kochukhov & ryabchikova ) strongly smears observed zeeman structure and makes proposed study of @xmath5oscillations extremely difficult .",
    "this paper is based on observations obtained at the european southern observatory ( la silla , chile ) and at the canada - france - hawaii telescope .",
