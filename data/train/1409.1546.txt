    "the uncertainty principle and the pauli principle are two fundamental pillars of quantum physics which have relevant consequences for the determination of quantum states of matter systems .",
    "indeed , the former one prevents us to measure with arbitrary accuracy all the physical quantities which are classically within our reach , and the second one states that two identical fermions can not occupy the same quantum state simultaneously .",
    "but perhaps the most distinguished issue of these two principles is the stability of matter @xcite : atomic electrons operate as small radiating classical antennas that should fall on the nucleus at the time of a few billionths of a second , causing unstable atoms .",
    "the uncertainty principle comes to your rescue , enabling , together with the exclusion principle , the existence of electronic shells and subshells , and thus the periodic table and all the wealth of structural chemistry .",
    "+ in fact , it is more than that . when we talk about the stability of microscopic systems ( e.g. , the stability of hydrogen ) , we simply mean that the total energy of the system can not be arbitrarily negative . if the system would not have such lower bound to the energy , it would be posible to extract an infinite amount of energy , at least in principle .",
    "this stability of the first kind admits a generalization to the macroscopic systems , referred as stability of second kind . in this second type of stability ,",
    "the lowest posible energy of the macroscopic systems depends at most linearly on the number of particles ; or , in other terms , the lowest posible energy per particle can not be arbitrarily negative as the number of particle increases .",
    "these two stability problems have a crucial relevance to understand the world around us .",
    "both of them rely on the fermionic property of electrons ; more specifically , they rely on the uncertainty principle and the pauli principle",
    ". + the influence of the pauli principle on the mathematical formulations of the uncertainty principle ( i.e. , the uncertainty relations ) has been previously perceived ( see e.g. , @xcite ) but it has never been explicitly described , to the best of our knowledge . in this paper",
    "we tackle this issue .",
    "to be more specific , in our work we explore the effects of the pauli exclusion principle on two concrete uncertainty relations of d - dimensional systems : a generalised heisenberg relation valid for general finite fermion systems , and the fisher - information - based uncertainty relation of systems moving in a central potential . in other words ,",
    "we investigate the combined balance of the effects of spatial and spin dimensionalities on these two fundamental uncertainty relations .",
    "we do this way because of the relevant role that space dimensionality plays in the analysis of the structure and dynamics of natural systems and phenomena , from atomic and molecular physics ( see e.g. , @xcite ) , quantum optics @xcite to condensed matter ( see e.g. , @xcite ) and quantum information and computation ( see e.g.,@xcite ) . + the structure of the present work is the following . in section ii",
    "we first show the explicit dependence of a generalised heisenberg uncertainty relation on the spin degree of freedom . as a particular case ,",
    "the spin effects on the standard heisenberg relation are given and the accuracy of the corresponding lower boun is examined for all atoms of the periodic table from hydrogen to lawrencium . in section iii ,",
    "a similar study is carried out for the fisher - information - based uncertainty relation in quantum systems with a central potential .",
    "finally , some conclusions and open problems are given .",
    "atomic units will be used throughout all the paper .",
    "let us consider a @xmath0-dimensional system of @xmath1 independent fermions of spin @xmath2 moving in an arbitrary potential .",
    "let us denote by @xmath3 the position probability density of the system , whose moment around the origin or radial expectation value of order @xmath4 is given by @xmath5 and @xmath6 denote the corresponding radial momentum expectation value of second order . in this section",
    "we find a lower bound to the uncertainty product @xmath7 , @xmath8 , which only depends on @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath4 .",
    "then , for @xmath9 we obtain the standard heisenberg uncertainty relation with the spin - dependent effects .",
    "finally , we numerically analyze the accuracy of this relation for all atoms with nuclear charge @xmath10 through @xmath11 .",
    "+ first we show the main result : the generalised uncertainty relation of the form @xmath12 with the constant @xmath13 where @xmath14^{2/d},\\\\\\ ] ] @xmath15^{1+\\frac{2}{d}+\\frac{2}{\\alpha}}}\\cdot\\left[\\frac{\\gamma(\\frac{d}{\\alpha}+\\frac{d}{2}+2)}{d(d+2)\\gamma(\\frac{d}{\\alpha})}\\right]^{2/d},\\\\\\ ] ] and @xmath16 for @xmath17 .",
    "there is a longstanding conjecture @xmath18 due to lieb and thirring , which is now current belief ; this is assumed heretoforth .",
    "+ we will prove this result in two steps .",
    "first we use an inequality of lieb - thirring type @xcite to bound the kinetic energy of the system in terms of the entropic moments @xmath19 = \\int_{\\mathbb{r}_{d } } \\rho(\\vec{r})^{a}\\ , d^{d}r , \\ , \\ , a \\ge 1,\\ ] ] and then , we bound these quantities in terms of the position moments @xmath20 of arbitrary order @xmath4 .",
    "indeed , the lieb - thirring inequality appropriately modified @xcite tells us that @xmath21\\ , , \\quad \\text{with } \\quad q= 2s+1\\ ] ] on the other hand , we can variationally bound the entropic moments @xmath22 $ ] with the given constraints @xmath23 and @xmath20 , @xmath24 . following the lines of the method of lagrange s multipliers described in refs .",
    "@xcite , we obtain the lower bound @xmath25",
    "\\geq f(\\alpha , a , d ) \\frac{n^{1+\\frac{2}{d}+\\frac{2}{\\alpha}}}{\\langle r^{\\alpha } \\rangle^{\\frac{d}{\\alpha}(a-1)}},\\ ] ] with @xmath26^{a-1}}\\times \\left\\ { \\frac{(ad - d)^{ad - d}}{[a(\\alpha+ d)-d)]^{a(\\alpha+ d)-d}}\\right\\}^{\\frac{1}{\\alpha}}\\ ] ] and @xmath27 . the symbols @xmath28 and @xmath29 denote the well - known gamma and beta functions , respectively .",
    "+ now , putting @xmath30 into expressions ( [ eq : ineq2])-([eq : ctef2 ] ) and multiplying the subsequent expression by the inequality ( [ eq : inepe2 ] ) one finally obtains the wanted generalised uncertainty relation ( [ eq : ineq1 ] ) .    for the particular case @xmath31 , the generalized uncertainty relation ( [ eq : ineq1 ] ) gives the spin - dependent heisenberg relation for @xmath0-dimensional @xmath1-fermion systems @xmath32 with @xmath33^{1/d}\\right\\}^{2}.\\ ] ] let us note that the lower bound on the position - momentum heisenberg product increases when both the spatial and spin dimensionalities are increasing , so that the uncertainty relation gets improved .",
    "note that for large values of the spatial dimensionality @xmath0 , the bound ( [ eq : ineq3 ] ) behaves as @xmath34 .",
    "since the general spinless @xmath0-dimensional bound is @xmath35 , it is interesting to highlight that there is a delicate balance between the spatial and spin dimensionality effects so that it turns out that the lower bound ( [ eq : ineq3 ] ) is better or worse than the spinless bound when @xmath0 is small or large , respectively .",
    "this is because of the relative values of @xmath0 , @xmath2 , and @xmath1 in ( [ eq : ineq3 ] ) .",
    "+ moreover , for @xmath36 one trivially obtains the spin - dependent heisenberg uncertainty relation for all real @xmath1-fermion systems @xmath37 where the equality is reached for the harmonic oscillator , as previously known @xcite .     to @xmath11.,width=302 ]    to have an idea of the accuracy of the heisenberg relation ( [ eq : ineq4 ] ) , we study the uncertainty product @xmath38 for all neutral atoms of the periodic table from hydrogen ( @xmath39 ) to lawrencium ( @xmath40 ) in a numerical hartree - fock framework .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] , where the lower bound is @xmath41 since the electron spin @xmath42 .",
    "therein we can clearly observe two important phenomena : ( i ) the atomic shell structure is grasped by the heisenberg uncertainty relation , and ( ii ) the accuracy of the inequality globally decreases when the nuclear charge of the atoms is increasing .",
    "the fisher information of a @xmath0-dimensional system of @xmath1 fermions characterized by the quantum - mechanical probability densities @xmath3 and @xmath43 in position and momentum spaces are defined @xcite by @xmath44 : = \\int \\frac{|\\vec{\\nabla } \\rho(\\vec{r})|^{2}}{\\rho(\\vec{r})}\\ , d^{d } r \\quad \\text{and } \\quad   i[\\gamma ] : = \\int \\frac{|\\vec{\\nabla } \\gamma(\\vec{p})|^{2}}{\\gamma(\\vec{p})}\\ , d^{d } p.\\ ] ] it has been proved that the product of these information - theoretical quantities is known to have an uncertainty character @xcite . in fact , for the systems subject to central potentials of arbitrary type one knows that the fisher - information - based uncertainty product is bounded from below by the standard heisenberg uncertainty product @xcite as @xmath44\\times i[\\gamma ] \\geq 16 \\left ( 1- \\frac{2|m|}{2l+d-2}\\right)^2 \\langle r^{2}\\rangle\\langle p^{2}\\rangle,\\ ] ] where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are two hyperquantum numbers",
    ". we should keep in mind that the angular part of the wavefunctions of a particle in a @xmath0-dimensional central potential is characterized by @xmath47 hyperangular quantum numbers @xmath48 .",
    "+ then , taking into account this inequality together with the expressions ( [ eq : ineq3])-([eq : ctea2 ] ) one finds the following spin - modified fisher - information - based uncertainty relation @xmath49 \\times   i[\\gamma ] \\geq c(l , m , d ) ( 2 s+1)^{-\\frac{2}{d } } n^{\\frac{2}{d}+2},\\ ] ] with the constant @xmath50^{2}\\times \\left\\{\\frac{d}{d+1}[\\gamma(d+1)]^{\\frac{1}{d } }   \\right\\}^{2}.\\ ] ] this uncertainty relation holds for all @xmath0-dimensional @xmath1-fermion systems subject to a central potential of arbitrary type .",
    "it is interesting to note that for the values @xmath51 , one has @xmath52",
    "\\times   i[\\gamma ] \\geq \\left\\ { \\frac{4d}{d+1}\\left[\\gamma(d+1)\\right]^{\\frac{1}{d } } \\right\\}^{2 } ( 2 s+1)^{-\\frac{2}{d } } n^{\\frac{2}{d}+2},\\ ] ] which is the pauli - modified expression of the general spinless fisher - information - based uncertainty relation @xmath53 \\times   i[\\gamma ] \\geq 4d^{2 } n^{2}$ ] recently found @xcite .",
    "note that for large values of the spatial dimensionality @xmath0 , the bound ( [ eq : ineq6 ] ) behaves as @xmath54 .",
    "again here , it is manifest the delicate balance between the spatial and spin dimensionality effects which makes the lower bound ( [ eq : ineq6 ] ) to be better or worse than the spinless bound when @xmath0 is small or large , respectively . on the other hand ,",
    "we observe as in the heisenberg - like case discussed in the previous section , that the lower bound on the position - momentum fisher - based product increases when the spatial dimen- sionality is increasing ; and it decreases when the spin dimensionality is increasing , so that the pauli effects worse the uncertainty relation , especially when the spatial dimensionality decreases .",
    "the global improvement of the pauli - modified bound actually comes from the extra ( 2/d)-power which n has with respect to the spinless bound .",
    "+ then , for @xmath55 we obtain the uncertainty relation @xmath44 \\times   i[\\gamma ] \\geq 9\\times 6^{2/3}\\ , ( 2 s+1)^{-\\frac{2}{3 } } n^{\\frac{8}{3}}\\ ] ] for real @xmath1-fermion systems .",
    "so , for electronic systems ( @xmath56 ) , one has @xmath44",
    "\\times   i[\\gamma ] \\geq 3^{\\frac{8}{3}}n^{\\frac{8}{3}}\\ ] ] the accuracy of this relation is numerically examined in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] for all neutral atoms of the periodic table from hydrogen ( @xmath39 ) through lawrencium ( @xmath40 ) in a hartree - fock framework .",
    "the lower bound is @xmath57 . here",
    "again we first observe that the known atomic shell structure is grasped by the fisher - information - based uncertainty product .",
    "moreover , contrary to the heisenberg uncertainty product , this fisher - like product globally decreases , and so its accuracy globally increases , when the nuclear charge of the atom is increasing .",
    "the different behavior of the fisher uncertainty relation with respect to the heisenberg one is due to the local character of the position and momentum fisher informations ; indeed , they are functionals of the gradient of position and momentum densities of the system , respectively .     to @xmath11.,width=302 ]",
    "the pauli - principle effects on two uncertainty relations ( the generalised heisenberg relations and the fisher - information - based relation ) have been investigated together with the spatial dimensionality contribution . summarizing , we have explicitly found the effects of the combined contribution of the spatial and spin degrees of freedom on two mathematical formulations of the quantum - mechanical uncertainty principle .",
    "first , for a system with a fixed number @xmath1 of fermions we have observed in heisenberg - like and fisher cases that the lower bound increases when both spatial and spin dimensionalities are increasing ; thus the uncertainty relation becomes more accurate , so better .",
    "second , when @xmath1 is increasing , the lower bound on the heisenberg - like and fisher - like uncertainty products globally increases and decreases , respectively ; so that the corresponding uncertainty relations worse and better , respectively .",
    "the main reason for this opposite behavior is that the position - and - momentum - uncertainty measures of the two uncertainty relations have a global character in the heisenberg - like case and a local character in the fisher - like case .",
    "+ the pauli effects on the uncertainty relations based on the shannon , rnyi or the tsallis entropies remain unknown .",
    "to determine them it is necessary to design a _ modus operandi _ different to the one used in this work .",
    "indeed , here we have expressed the heisenberg - like and fisher - like uncertainty products in terms of the standard heisenberg product @xmath58 , and then we have obtained a lower bound on it . in the shannon and rnyi cases it is not yet possible to express the corresponding position and momentum sums",
    "@xcite in terms of the standard heisenberg product , and a similar situation occurs for the position and momentum quotients in the tsallis or rajagopal - maassen - uffink case @xcite .",
