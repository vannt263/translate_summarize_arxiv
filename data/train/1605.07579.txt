    "the origin of the martian methane ( ch@xmath1 ) is still poorly understood . despite the fact that the presence of ch@xmath1 remains under debate ( zahnle et al .",
    "2011 ; zahnle 2015 ) , detections have been claimed at the 1060 parts per billion by volume ( ppbv ) level in mars atmosphere from space and ground - based observations at the end of the 90s and during the following decade ( formisano et al . , 2004 ;",
    "krasnopolsky et al . 2004 ; mumma et al .",
    "2009 ; fonti and marzo 2010 ) .",
    "recent observations suggest a ch@xmath1 atmospheric abundance of @xmath010 ppbv , and in some cases no or little ch@xmath1 with an upper limit of @xmath07 ppbv in 20092010 , during mars northern spring ( krasnopolsky 2012 ; villanueva et al .",
    "more recent _ in situ _",
    "measurements performed by mars science laboratory ( msl ) have evidenced variations in the methane detection at the location of gale crater . despite a background level of methane remaining at 0.69  @xmath2  0.25 ppbv , an elevated level of methane of 7.2  @xmath2  2.1 ppbv was evidenced during a timespan of @xmath06 months ( see table 1 of webster et al .",
    "2015 ) , a range of values comparable to the levels observed remotely during the last decade .",
    "because local methane enhancements such as those measured by msl require ch@xmath1 atmospheric lifetimes of less than 1 yr ( lefvre and forget 2009 ) , its release from a subsurface reservoir or an active primary source has widely been discussed in the literature .",
    "a plausible explanation is that ch@xmath1 could have been produced either by hydrothermal alteration of basaltic crust ( lyons et al . 2005 ) or by serpentinization of ultramafic rocks producing h@xmath3 and reducing crustal carbon into ch@xmath1 ( oze and sharma 2005 ; atreya et al .",
    "2007 ; chassefire and leblanc 2011 ; chassefire et al .",
    "2013 ; holm et al .",
    "this hypothesis is supported by the fact that ultramafic and serpentinized rocks have been observed on mars , in particular in the nili fossae region ( brown et al .",
    "2010 ; ehlmann et al .",
    "2010 ; viviano et al .",
    "once formed , methane storage on mars is commonly associated with the presence of hidden clathrate reservoirs .",
    "martian clathrates would form an intermediate storage reservoir in the subsurface that regularly releases methane into the atmosphere ( prieto - ballesteros et al .",
    "2006 ; chastain and chevrier 2007 ; thomas et al . 2009 ; gainey and elwood madden 2012 ; herri and chassefire 2012 ; mousis et al . 2013 , 2015 ) .",
    "however , because clathrates are more likely thermodynamically stable in the martian subsurface and at depths depending on the soil s porosity ( mousis et al . 2013 ) , their existence has never be proven by remote or _ in situ _ observations .",
    "interestingly , it has been recently proposed that halite or regolith could also sequestrate ch@xmath1 on the martian surface ( fries et al .",
    "2015 ; hu et al .",
    "2015 ) , but these mechanisms still need to be thoroughly investigated .    here , because of their ability to trap substantial amounts of gases , we suggest that zeolites may form an alternative plausible storage reservoir of methane in the martian subsurface .",
    "spectral evidence for the presence of zeolite has been found on the martian surface ( ruff 2004 ; ehlmann et al .",
    "2009 ; carter et al .",
    "2013 ; ehlmann 2014 ) and there is strong geological case arguing for the presence of this aluminosilicate as part of the martian regolith . in sec .",

    "the amount of methane potentially trapped in these zeolites in martian conditions is estimated in sec .",
    "is devoted to discussion .",
    "zeolites have been first detected by ruff ( 2004 ) on martian dust using the mars global surveyor ( mgs ) tes spectroscopic observations .",
    "fialips et al .",
    "( 2005 ) then suggested that the water - equivalent hydrogen observed by mars odyssey could be partially stored by zeolite minerals present in the first meters in the martian regolith .",
    "indeed , dickinson and rosen ( 2003 ) observed up to 18 wt% of authigenic chabazite in frozen soils of antarctica ( equivalent to martian conditions ) .",
    "recently , both omega and crism instruments onboard the esa mars express and nasa mars reconnaissance orbiter ( mro ) detected zeolite minerals on the rocky outcrops of several places on mars ( ehlmann et al .",
    "2009 ; carter et al .",
    "2013 , ehlmann 2014 ) . while the first observations on dust and soils suggested a grossly zeolite mineral distribution at mid - latitude , we now have detailed observations revealing the geological / morphological context of zeolite outcrops ( 152 occurrences were detected by carter et al . 2013 ) .",
    "for instance , ehlmann et al .",
    "( 2009 ) claimed the identification of pure analcime ( si - al - na form ) in the deposits in and around the central peaks of two 25-km impact craters nearby nili fossae and isidis .",
    "these peaks would then reflect post - impact hydrothermal alteration ( osinski and pierazzo 2013 ) .",
    "carter et al .",
    "( 2013 ) had a detailed discussion of the issue of their timing of formation and concluded that most hydrous minerals , including zeolites , were formed during the noachian period .",
    "however , they also noticed the presence of zeolites in the younger northern lowlands , probably resulting from ice - volcano interaction .    in summary ,",
    "both tes and omega instruments were able to remotely differentiate zeolite spectra from other alteration minerals , namely opal a and saponite formed under similar conditions .",
    "such secondary zeolites result from low temperature aqueous alteration by alkaline brines ( or ice ) of volcanic glass included in pyroclastic or volcanic sedimentary rocks and form authigenic cements in volcanoclastic sandstone .",
    "note that volcanic ash and tephra , the common contributor to sedimentary material on mars , should be widespread , as explosive volcanism on mars is the rule rather than the exception ( grott et al .",
    "however , the resolution of existing infrared spectra remains insufficient to constrain the variety of zeolites that really crystallized on mars .    among the possible zeolites ,",
    "chabazite is a good candidate to account for their widespread occurrence on mars .",
    "this mineral is the end product of weathering sequences in a wide range of chemical context ranging from silica - rich to silica - poor volcanic rocks .",
    "chabazite typically forms in chemically open systems , in which transports of soluble ions take place efficiently by flowing vadose water or near - surface ground water ( sheppard and hay 2001 ) . on the other hand , in the closed systems in the martian subsurface ,",
    "more alkali analcime and clinoptilolite should be the major zeolites due to limitation of transports of soluble ions .",
    "also , there are several terrestrial locations where nearly pure analcimes form thick bedding ( several tens of meters ) with wide special extent ( hundreds of kilometers ) ( sheppard and gude 1973 ; whateley et al .",
    "1996 ; deer et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "one can provide an estimate of the amount of zeolites potentially existing on mars .",
    "using noachian estimates for the martian crustal thermal flux ( 1220@xmath4c / km ) and thermodynamic data of low - grade metamorphic facies ( @xmath0160220 @xmath4c and from 0 to 3 @xmath510@xmath6 kpa ) , zeolites may be formed at depths ranging from approximately 8 to 1520 km ( e.g. mcsween et al .",
    "this estimate is confirmed by the detection of zeolites near central peaks , independently suggesting that those minerals are indeed present at depths of several kilometers in the crust . assuming this depth range ( 815 km ) , it corresponds to a global volume of 10@xmath7 km@xmath8 and a global equivalent layer ( gel ) reaching @xmath07 km of martian zeolites .",
    "however , the maps of carter et al .",
    "( 2013 ) show that the area where zeolites ( and all hydrous minerals ) were detected by remote sensing is equivalent to the surface of the 045@xmath4s latitudinal band , i.e. about 35% of the surface of mars . if we do not consider temperature constraints but only different thicknesses ( 0.001 to 10 km ) of a 100% zeolite layer at all 045 @xmath4s latitudes , the total volume and gel are in the @xmath05 @xmath5 10@xmath95 @xmath5 10@xmath10 km@xmath8 and @xmath00.353500 m ranges , respectively .",
    "the smallest values may be considered as reasonable estimates ( in the range of @xmath01% of zeolite in crystal clays ; ehlmann et al .",
    "2011 ) , but other geological settings or models can be considered .",
    "for instance , the total volume of possible isolated cylindrical zeolite layers located beneath @xmath0150 impact craters ( carter et al .",
    "2013 ) ranging from 5 to 200 km of diameter ( zeolite layer thickness from 0.1 km to unrealistic 20 km ) may reach @xmath010@xmath8 to 10@xmath10 km@xmath8 ( 0.07 to 700 m gel ) .",
    "these isolated layers may correspond to zeolite minerals formed by post - impact hydrothermal alteration ( osinski and pierazzo 2013 ) .",
    "therefore , it seems that any scenario of zeolite geological generation ( sparse post - impact hydrothermal alteration or crustal global alteration ) can lead to important ranges of volumes / gel .",
    "these values , in particular the most optimistic ones , should not be taken as true quantities , but only as starting reasonable estimates .",
    "indeed crustal porosity and fluids surely decrease the efficiency of zeolite formation at depths : the low water - to - rock ratio would prevent any alteration while secondary mineralizations fill the pores .",
    "in this section , the adsorption selectivity of ch@xmath1 with respect to co@xmath3 is investigated on chabazite , analcime and clinoptilolite .",
    "the common chemical formula of a hydrated chabazite is [ ca@xmath11al@xmath12si@xmath13o@xmath14,(h@xmath3o)@xmath15 .",
    "there exists several forms of chabazite zeolites that differ in their si / al ratio and the nature of cations ( ba@xmath16 , ca@xmath16 , sr@xmath16 , k@xmath17 , na@xmath17 ) , which counterbalance the electric charges .",
    "the framework structure of chabazite is composed of sio@xmath1 and alo@xmath1 tetrahedrons joined by their oxygen atoms",
    ". this arrangement forms primary building units interconnected by secondary building units , as shown in fig .",
    "[ chab1 ] .",
    "the unit cell of chabazite thus contains one large ellipsoidal cavity accessed by six 8-ring windows ( pascale et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "the chabazite zeolite gets specific adsorption properties for various molecules having a size smaller than the 8-ring apertures , which gives them access to the ellipsoidal cages . owing to the presence of compensation alkali cations ,",
    "the chabazite is a hydrophilic material .",
    "its adsorption capacity of water is around 0.2 cm@xmath8/g at 257 k ( jnchen et al . 2006 ) .",
    "this zeolite is also able to adsorb co@xmath3 and ch@xmath1 , two molecules of interest for the martian atmosphere .",
    "figure [ chab2 ] shows the adsorption isotherms of co@xmath3 and ch@xmath1 on chabazite at 300 k calculated by monte carlo simulations in the grand canonical ensemble ( gcmc ) ( garcia - perez et al .",
    "2007 ) for pressure ranging below 10@xmath8 kpa .",
    "these simulations are in a very good agreement with some experimental data reported in the literature ( watson et al . , 2012 ; jensen et al . 2012 ) .    as would expected , owing to the presence of a quadripolar moment in the carbon dioxide molecule , the chabazite adsorbs more co@xmath3 than ch@xmath1 . in spite of this , the amount of methane adsorbed is not insignificant at 300 k and even better at lower temperature",
    ". it can reach @xmath02 mol / kg against more than 6 mol / kg in the case of co@xmath3 .",
    "this result suggests that the chabazite will selectively adsorb methane and carbon dioxide , with an adsorption in favor of the latter molecule .",
    "the adsorption selectivity of methane with respect to carbon dioxide is defined by the relation :    @xmath19    where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the mole fractions of component i in the adsorbed phase and in the gas phase at equilibrium , respectively .",
    "@xmath22 can be predicted from the adsorption isotherms of single components by means of the ideal adsorbed solution theory ( ias theory ; myers and prausnitz .",
    "when the gas pressure converges towards zero , each single adsorption isotherm exhibits a linear part ( see fig .",
    "[ chab2 ] ) , which corresponds to the henry s law region . in this domain ,",
    "the adsorbed amount of each single component i is proportional to the gas pressure : @xmath23  =  @xmath24 . by applying the ias theory to the henry s law region ,",
    "this allows us to derive the adsorption selectivity from the ratio between the henry constants :    @xmath25    the ratio of the adsorbed amounts of ch@xmath1 and co@xmath3 can then be related to the ratio of their partial pressures at equilibrium via the relation :    @xmath26    henry constants determined from experimental adsorption isotherms at 300 k are given in table [ table_chab ] with the corresponding selectivities . with the values of the adsorption enthalpies found in the literature , the henry constants can be estimated at any temperature relevant to mars conditions by using the vant hoff relation :    @xmath27    once the values of @xmath28 have been determined for ch@xmath1 and co@xmath3 at given temperature , it is possible to derive the corresponding adsorption selectivity from eq .",

    "the maximum diameter of a sphere that can diffuse throughout this structure is @xmath02.4  .",
    "because the kinetic diameters of co@xmath3 and ch@xmath1 are 3.3 and 3.8   respectively , these two molecules can not be adsorbed in analcime .",

    "clinoptilolite has the same framework structure as heulandite .",
    "however it presents a better thermal stability .",
    "the porosity is composed of three sets of intersecting channels , all in the same plane ( fig .",

    "[ chab2 ] given at 300 k ) , this enables us to investigate the amount of ch@xmath1 that would be potentially trapped in martian chabazite or clinoptilolite in contact with an older martian atmosphere at various temperatures , assuming that the methane abundance was higher than today s value at that time .",

    "it shows that the ch@xmath1/co@xmath3 ratio must be in the @xmath010@xmath313  @xmath5  10@xmath33 range at 150 k in the coexisting gas phase to give a value in chabazite matching the ch@xmath1 abundance range measured by msl ( in the @xmath00.257.2 @xmath5 10@xmath34 range ) .",
    "ch@xmath1/co@xmath3 ratios must also exceed @xmath05  @xmath5  10@xmath35 and 4  @xmath5  10@xmath36 in gas to give values in chabazite higher than those measured by msl at 300 and 200 k , respectively .",
    "on the other hand , the ch@xmath1/co@xmath3 ratio in the coexisting gas must be in the @xmath010@xmath373  @xmath510@xmath36 range in clinoptilolite to match the ch@xmath1 abundance range measured by msl at 150 k. interestingly , because @xmath22 is higher in clinoptilolite than in chabazite at temperatures lower than @xmath0270 k , smaller ch@xmath1/co@xmath3 ratios ( @xmath07  @xmath5  10@xmath35 at 300 k and @xmath05  @xmath5  10@xmath37 at 200 k ) are needed to allow this zeolite to match the msl values .",
    "comparisons with models depicting the composition of clathrates potentially existing in the martian subsurface show that chabazite or clinoptilolite can be comparable methane sinks ( i.e. , methane trapping from a methane - containing atmosphere on early mars or from an abiotic source in the crust on early / present mars ) at significantly higher temperatures .",
    "for example , @xmath38 in chabazite or clinoptilolite becomes greater or equal to 0.1 at temperatures reaching 300 k ( see fig . [ chab3 ] ) , whatever the initial ch@xmath1 atmospheric mole fraction .",
    "similar selectivities are achieved in clathrates for ch@xmath1 mole fractions in the 10@xmath3310@xmath39 range but the existence of these structures requires temperatures lower than @xmath0150  k at 0.6 kpa of atmospheric pressure ( mousis et al .",
    "2013 ) , namely the coldest temperature reached during winter in the south pole region .",
    "therefore , scenarios advocating a substantial trapping of volatiles in martian clathrates argue that these ices are buried in the soil at sufficient depth , allowing them to be isolated from the atmosphere and remain stable over long time periods ( chastain and chevrier 2007 ; thomas et al .",
    "2009 ; herri and chassefire 2012 ; chassefire et al .",
    "2013 ; mousis et al .",
    "this scenario also applies to martian chabazite or clinoptilolite , allowing ch@xmath1 to be extracted either from a potentially methane - rich ancient atmosphere or directly from an abiotic source localized in the crust .",
    "indeed , because of their burial in the soil , these zeolites could have preserved the trapped methane over long time periods and create the sporadic releases observed in the atmosphere over the last decade due to impacts , seismic activity or erosion .",
    "an alternative possibility would be to assume that zeolites did continuously remain in equilibrium with the martian atmosphere during the course of its evolution . in this case",
    ", zeolites would not be able to supply any methane to the atmosphere : because the value of @xmath38 is in the @xmath010@xmath3210@xmath40 range between 200 and 300 k , the amount of ch@xmath1 trapped in chabazite and clinoptilolite would be lower than the measured atmospheric levels .",
    "for the same reason , chabazite and clinoptilolite could not act as ch@xmath1 sinks if they remain in contact with the atmosphere . similarly to the proposed trapping scenarios in clathrates , the methane stored in these zeolites could have been produced earlier either via hydrothermal alteration of basaltic crust ( lyons et al . 2005 ) or via serpentinization reactions ( oze and sharma 2005 ; atreya et al .",
    "2007 ; chassefire and leblanc 2011 ; chassefire et al .",
    "2013 ; holm et al .",
    "otherwise , alternative methane sinks should be considered on mars .    in order to quantitatively",
    "test the link between the current time presence of ch@xmath1 in the atmosphere and the possible destabilization of zeolites , we can estimate the total gel of zeolites that must be destabilized each second , assuming an initial quantity of trapped ch@xmath1 . in the following ,",
    "we make the assumption that chabazite or analcime are the dominant zeolites on mars . if , instead , analcime is the dominant form , then this material can not be at the origin of the atmospheric ch@xmath1 , due to the small size of its porous network .",
    "two case studies can be envisaged . in the first case",

    "these ratios correspond to amounts of trapped ch@xmath1 of @xmath010@xmath39 mol kg@xmath40 in chabazite and @xmath010@xmath36 mol kg@xmath40 in clinoptilolite ( see fig . [ chab4 ] ) .",

    "3.3 ) , the aforementioned values of gel and localized layer would be increased by the same factor .",
    "when based on realistic values of the methane flux , our calculations show that the second case appears more plausible than the first because it requires amounts of chabazite or clinoptilolite well below those independently quantified from geological constraints .",
    "if the martian methane present in chabazite or clinoptilolite is directly sourced from an abiotic source in the subsurface , the destabilization of a zeolite localized layer of a few millimeters per year at worst may be sufficient to explain the current observations .",
    "our study suggests that if the methane outgassing from excavated chabazite or clinoptilolite prevails over any other source on mars , then the presence of these minerals around gale crater could explain the variation of the ch@xmath1 level observed by msl .",
    "an interesting follow - up of this work would be to investigate the adsorption / desorption efficiencies of other gases in zeolites .",
    "coupling all the data together might lead to predictions of other observable effects in the martian atmosphere that could be used to test the present hypothesis .    finally , it is interesting to note that the zeolites adsorption properties depend on their si / al ratios .",
    "the smaller is this ratio , the greater are the compensating cations and the hydrophilic and organophilic properties of the zeolites .",
    "the adsorption selectivity of ch@xmath1 with respect to co@xmath3 also varies according to this ratio and the nature of the cation .",

    "<S> the origin of the martian methane is still poorly understood . </S>",
    "<S> a plausible explanation is that methane could have been produced either by hydrothermal alteration of basaltic crust or by serpentinization of ultramafic rocks producing hydrogen and reducing crustal carbon into methane . </S>",
    "<S> once formed , methane storage on mars is commonly associated with the presence of hidden clathrate reservoirs . here </S>",
    "<S> , we alternatively suggest that chabazite and clinoptilolite , which belong to the family of zeolites , may form a plausible storage reservoir of methane in the martian subsurface . </S>",
    "<S> because of the existence of many volcanic terrains , zeolites are expected to be widespread on mars and their global equivalent layer may range up to more than @xmath01 km , according to the most optimistic estimates . </S>",
    "<S> if the martian methane present in chabazite and clinoptilolite is directly sourced from an abiotic source in the subsurface , the destabilization of a localized layer of a few millimeters per year may be sufficient to explain the current observations . </S>",
    "<S> the sporadic release of methane from these zeolites requires that they also remained isolated from the atmosphere during its evolution . </S>",
    "<S> the methane release over the ages could be due to several mechanisms such as impacts , seismic activity or erosion . </S>",
    "<S> if the methane outgassing from excavated chabazite and/or clinoptilolite prevails on mars , then the presence of these zeolites around gale crater could explain the variation of methane level observed by mars science laboratory .    </S>",
