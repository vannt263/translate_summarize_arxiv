    "when the multiplicity function @xmath52 for @xmath47 takes @xmath29 on @xmath51 , we can construct two bounded maximal abelian sets of idempotents in the commutant of @xmath68 which are not similar to each other in @xmath70 . by lemma 3.10",
    ", we know that if @xmath52 takes @xmath29 on @xmath51 , then the @xmath69 group of @xmath292 is @xmath8 a.  e.  on @xmath293 .",
    "denote by @xmath294 the restriction of @xmath68 acting on @xmath295 .",
    "the operator @xmath68 can be expressed as @xmath296 . since the spectral measures of @xmath72 are mutually singular , we obtain @xmath297 the rest of the proof is essentially an application of theorem 2.2 .",
