    "transition - metal oxides with perovskite - type crystal structure attracted a great deal of interests in the past two decades due to the fascinating characters of superconducting , magnetic and transport properties .",
    "these properties range from high - temperature superconductivity,@xcite colossal magnetoresistance,@xcite ferroelectricity,@xcite multiferroics,@xcite to co - incident metal - insulator , structural , and magnetic phase transitions.@xcite the perovskite cobaltites acoo@xmath4 was discovered in 1950s@xcite .",
    "but they still attracted interests due to a couple of unique properties ; namely , the large magnetoresistance ( mr),@xcite enormous hall effect,@xcite the existence of the spin - state transitions,@xcite and the unusual magnetic ground states of doped cobaltites.@xcite    the distinct feature in perovskite cobaltites compared to other transition - metal oxides such as manganites is the existence of various spin states of co ions .",
    "recent experimental and theoretical investigations on perovskite cobaltites indicate that the spin states are low - spin ( ls ) and the mixture of intermediate - spin(is)/ls for tetravalent and trivalent cobalt ions , respectively.@xcite this behavior arises from the fact that the crystal field splitting of co @xmath12 states ( @xmath13 ) and the hund s rule exchange energy ( @xmath14 ) are comparable in magnitude for the cobaltites , which means that the energy gap ( @xmath15 = @xmath16-@xmath14 ) between @xmath17 and @xmath18 bands is rather small .",
    "in fact , this gap can be of the order of 10 mev in lacoo@xmath4 , so that the electrons in @xmath17 levels can be thermally excited to the @xmath18 states , leading to higher spin states of co ions.@xcite because @xmath13 is very sensitive to the variation in the co - o bond length ( @xmath19 ) or the unit cell volume of lattice , the subtle balance between @xmath13 and @xmath20 may be easily disrupted by different kinds of effect , such as the hole - doping and the chemical / external pressure.@xcite the @xmath21intermediate spin state@xmath21 has been claimed to exist in la@xmath2sr@xmath3coo@xmath4 by different groups.@xcite it is generally accepted that the ferromagnetism in hole - doped la@xmath2m@xmath22coo@xmath4 ( m = ca , sr , and ba ) results from the double - exchange ( de ) interaction between co@xmath10 and co@xmath11 ions , facilitating also the electrical conductivity in the ferromagnetic metallic phase . in this consideration , the de interaction is accomplished through transfer of @xmath18 electrons in the intermediate - spin ( is ) co@xmath10 to ls co@xmath11 , so that the @xmath18 electrons become collective in la@xmath2sr@xmath3coo@xmath4 and the co ions ultimately turn into @xmath23 electronic configuration . for the cobaltites ( such as : pr@xmath0ca@xmath1coo@xmath4 and nd@xmath0ca@xmath1coo@xmath4 ) with small average radius of ions on a sites , resistivity is not metallic in these compounds , meaning that the magnetic exchange should be localized to some extent instead of being itinerant as in de exchange .",
    "therefore , further studies to make clear the magnetic exchange interactions in cobaltites are desired .",
    "if co ions are partially substituted by other transition metal ions , the de interaction between co@xmath10 and co@xmath11 will be destroyed to some extent .",
    "in addition , magnetic exchange interactions between co ions and the doped transition - metal ions could be expected because the existence of various valence and spin - states of co ions .",
    "investigation on such interactions through substituting co ions by other transition ions would be expected helpfully to make the role of all kinds of spin - states and valences in the magnetic exchange interactions clear . in the present paper",
    ", we choose fe element as the substitution ion",
    ". the effect of fe doping in la@xmath2sr@xmath3coo@xmath4 has been studied by several groups,@xcite and the common conclusion is the suppression of ferromagnetism and metallicity with fe doping as a result of the diluting of ferromagnetic interaction of co@xmath10-o - co@xmath11 and the introduction of the antiferromagnetic exchange interactions fe - o - fe and fe - o - co .",
    "however , our recent work on pr@xmath24ca@xmath24co@xmath2fe@xmath3o@xmath25 gave the evidence that fe doping enhances the ferromagnetism.@xcite the contrasting results observed in la@xmath2sr@xmath3coo@xmath4 and pr@xmath24ca@xmath24coo@xmath25 with fe doping could give some constructive hints on the magnetic interactions and spin states in the two systems . because the existence of spin - state transition with temperature in pr@xmath24ca@xmath24coo@xmath25,@xcite it is not suitable to be used for investigating the magnetic interactions between co and fe ions .",
    "therefore , we choose two systems with less ca content , which do not exhibit spin - state transition at low temperature.@xcite as a comparison , the system gd@xmath7sr@xmath8coo@xmath9 , which has the similar magnetic and transport properties to the typical la@xmath2sr@xmath3coo@xmath4,@xcite was chosen as another object for fe doping .",
    "the distinct responses of magnetic properties to the fe doping are observed due to the different average ionic radius of a site .",
