    "<S> the electron - electron and electron - photon interactions are described by exact numerical diagonalization . </S>",
    "<S> the photon field can be polarized perpendicular or parallel to the charge transport . </S>",
    "<S> we find a pronounced charge current dip associated with many - electron level crossings at the aharonov - casher phase @xmath0 , which can be disguised by linearly polarized light . </S>",
    "<S> qualitative agreement is found for the spin currents of the 1d and 2d ring . </S>",
    "<S> quantatively , however , the spin currents are weaker in the more realistic 2d ring , especially for weak spin - orbit interaction , but can be considerably enhanced with the aid of a linearly polarized electromagnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> specific spin current symmetries relating the dresselhaus spin - orbit interaction case to the rashba one are found to hold for the 2d ring in the photon cavity . </S>"
