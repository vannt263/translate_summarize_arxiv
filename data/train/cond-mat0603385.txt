    "driven lattice gas models have recently received much attention due to their possible application to intracellular transport @xcite .",
    "the connection of non - equilibrium transport to biology has been recognized almost 40 years ago by modelling ribosome motion on mrna . in two pioneering papers",
    "macdonald et al.@xcite have introduced a one - dimensional ( 1d ) driven lattice gas model which later became known as the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process ( tasep ) .    in this model",
    "each particle occupies a site on a one - dimensional lattice and advances stochastically uni - directionally ( hence the term `` totally asymmetric '' ) .",
    "the non - trivial properties arise by imposing the constraint that each site may at most be occupied by one particle , and that moves are forbidden if the target site is already occupied ( hence the term `` exclusion '' ) . of particular interest",
    "are systems with open boundary conditions where particles may enter and leave the 1d lattice at the left or right boundary with rates @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "remarkably , this 1d driven system with open boundaries exhibits a non - trivial phase diagram with @xmath0 and @xmath1 as control parameters @xcite .    for low extraction rate @xmath1 a high density ( hd )",
    "phase occurs , where the density profile is controlled by the right boundary .",
    "symmetrically , for low injection rate @xmath0 a low density ( ld ) phase appears , where the density profile is determined by the left boundary . for high values of both @xmath0 and @xmath1",
    "the bulk density is independent of the boundary conditions and the system carries its maximal current ( mc ) .",
    "exact solutions were found both for periodic and open boundary conditions through exact methods , such as recursive relations , bethe and matrix product ansatz @xcite .",
    "the stochastic fluctuations have been investigated in terms of static and dynamic correlation functions by exact methods @xcite and phenomenological approaches @xcite .",
    "the rich phenomenology , as well as the availability of exact results established tasep as on of the paradigmatic models in non - equilibrium statistical mechanics @xcite .    over many years",
    "the tasep has served as a testing ground for a mathematical analysis of non - equilibrium problems .",
    "more recently , the application to biology reentered the focus of attention in the context of systems of extended particles .",
    "for example , ribosomes bind to mrna occupying twelve codons and progressively advance by a single codon through two cycle of gtp hydrolysis ( elongation step ) .",
    "the implications of mutual steric hindrance of @xmath2-mers ( monomers , dimers , 12-mers ) have been studied by stochastic simulations and ` refined mean - field theory ' for @xmath2-tasep @xcite .",
    "the picture already found for monomers has been corroborated also by exact methods ( bethe ansatz @xcite and mapping to zero range process @xcite ) .",
    "intracellular transport , where a molecular motor ( kinesin ) is moving along a molecular track ( microtubule ) is yet another example of 1d non - equilibrium transport in a biological system ( see e.g.@xcite ) . in marked difference",
    "to directed motion of ribosomes on mrna here there is exchange of molecular motors with the surrounding cytosol acting as a particle reservoir .",
    "this observation has motivated a recently proposed extension of tasep , by supplementing the unidirectional hopping with langmuir ( on - off ) kinetics @xcite .",
    "single motor experiments suggest that both processes compete on the scale of the microtubule , i.e.  a motor explores a significant fraction of the track before detaching @xcite .",
    "to capture such an interplay mathematically , a _",
    "mesoscopic limit _ has been suggested , where local adsorption - desorption rates have been rescaled in the limit of large but finite systems , such that the gross rates are comparable to the injection - extraction rates at the boundaries @xcite .",
    "the study of this system has shown an unexpectedly rich and new phase diagram with phase coexistence regions . surprisingly in the mesoscopic",
    "limit the density profiles show a sharp discontinuity ( shock separating low from high density phase ) or cusp in a large portion of the phase diagram .    here",
    "we propose a model for intracellular transport incorporating both coupling to a reservoir as well as the finite extension of particles .",
    "the model is motivated by the fact that many processive molecular motors ( e.g.  kinesins , dyneins and myosin v ) are composed of two heads ( trail and lead ) that bind specifically each to a subunit of the molecular track ( @xmath0- and @xmath1-tubulin in case of microtubules ) .",
    "hence , we concentrate on particles which occupy two sites , i.e.  dimers , and advance by a single site per hopping event .",
    "the theoretical challenge arises from finding an appropriate and quantitative description that captures both the on - off kinetics as well as the @xmath2-tasep features on an equal footing .",
    "whereas for monomers a straightforward decoupling of correlations yields a consistent mean - field theory , such an approach fails even to describe the chemical equilibrium of a pure on - off kinetics @xcite . in the following paragraphs we review some aspects of our model where the geometric constraints usually play an important role introducing non - trivial static and dynamic correlations .    at the _",
    "static _ level the geometrical frustration emerges already in the equilibrium thermodynamics of the one - dimensional _ tonks gas_. identical extended particles are distributed according to the grand canonical ensemble on a one dimensional lattice .",
    "a hard core repulsion reduces the task to a combinatorial problem @xcite .",
    "it turns out that the single site occupation densities do not determine the configurational probabilities , contrary to the monomer case .",
    "there the _ langmuir kinetics _ specified in terms of attachment and detachment rates @xmath3 and @xmath4 , or equivalently the binding constant @xmath5 .",
    "the coverage density is simply determined by a single site consideration , resulting in the _ langmuir isotherm _ : @xmath6 .",
    "this is to be contrasted with the dimer case where a full evaluation of the grand canonical partition function is required leading to an equilibrium coverage density @xcite : @xmath7    at a _",
    "dynamical _ level a non - trivial approach to the steady state is found in the on - off kinetics in the fast attachment limit : at short time scales only deposition processes are frequent , while detachment processes are still unlikely .",
    "the kinetics belong to the class of problems referred to as _ random sequential adsorption ( rsa ) _ and the so - called `` flory plateau '' @xcite is reached exponentially fast . after this transient the particles can detach ( on longer time scales ) freeing new gaps ; this process results in a long tail relaxation where the isotherm is approached with a power law @xmath8 .",
    "such behavior has been explained using the mapping of the gap dynamics to a 1d reaction diffusion system @xmath9 ( for a review see @xcite and references therein ) for which this anomalous power law dynamics is known .",
    "this two step relaxation has been found also in other models like in irreversible deposition of dimers ( i.e.  rsa ) with diffusion @xcite and is intrinsically related to the extended nature of the particles .",
    "driving a system of extended particles far from equilibrium , e.g. introducing the @xmath2-tasep dynamics , suggests a variety of competing time scales and ordering phenomena , i.e.  non - equilibrium phase transitions .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to shed light on density and current profiles in the stationary state for a model incorporating such aspects , as well as to provide a complete analytical theory supported by simulated data .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] we specify the model under consideration and introduce the used formalism .",
    "section [ sec : mc ] exemplifies results of the stochastic simulations and puts extracted features into proper perspective . in sec .",
    "[ sec : mf ] we construct a suitable set of mean - field equations relying on results for @xmath2-tasep and on - off kinetics . in sec .",
    "[ sec : mfpd ] , with the help of these equations , we rationalize the mc data and study the complete phase diagram . in the conclusion ,",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] , we discuss the robustness of the model , give a possible generalization to @xmath2-mers and summarize our main results .",
    "we consider a finite one dimensional lattice with sites labeled @xmath10 , of unit length @xmath11 ; consequently the lattice spacing reads @xmath12 . the first two sites ( @xmath13 ) and the last two sites , ( @xmath14 ) represent , respectively , the left and right boundary . the lattice is partially covered by dimers , i.e.  composite objects consisting of two monomers rigidly tied together .",
    "a dimer occupies two lattice sites , see fig .",
    "[ fig : model ] ; we refer to the monomer to the right of the dimer as the _ lead head _ and correspondingly to the left monomer as the _ trail head_.    a microscopic state @xmath15 of the system consists of a configuration of non - overlapping indistinguishable dimers on the lattice .",
    "non - overlapping requires that no two heads ( trail or lead ) occupy the same lattice site .",
    "we specify the dynamical evolution by the following set of updating rules :    * if the lead head of a dimer occupies a site @xmath16 and the following site is empty , the dimer advances one step with unit rate .",
    "* at site @xmath17 a dimer enters the lattice with its trail head with rate @xmath0 provided that the first two sites are empty . *",
    "a dimer with its lead head on site @xmath18 leaves the lattice with rate @xmath1 emptying the last two sites . * everywhere in the bulk ( i.e.  trail head on a site @xmath19 ) a dimer leaves the lattice emptying two sites with a site independent detachment rate @xmath4 . * everywhere in the bulk ( @xmath19 ) a dimer enters the lattice with its trail head , provided that the considered site as well as its right neighbor is empty , with a site - independent attachment rate @xmath3 .",
    "the first three rules encode the usual totally asymmetric simple exclusion process of extended objects ( @xmath2-tasep ) , while the last two implement the coupling of the lattice to a reservoir of dimers with fixed chemical potential @xcite .",
    "the rules entail that a complete description of the underlying stochastic markov process is given in terms of the time - dependent probability @xmath20 .",
    "the time evolution is governed by the associated master equation @xmath21\\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the transition rates @xmath22 can be inferred form the dynamical rules .",
    "it is expected that the system evolves towards a stationary ensemble @xmath23 for long times . due to the lack of detailed balance",
    "this macroscopically stationary state does not correspond to an equilibrium ensemble , i.e.  there is no gibbs - boltzmann measure to be inferred from thermodynamics arguments .",
    "the macroscopic quantities we aim to compute are understood as averages over this distribution .    to exploit probabilistic methods we label sites according to : empty ( state @xmath24 ) ,",
    "occupied with the trail head ( state @xmath25 ) or with the lead head ( state @xmath26 ) .",
    "the configuration @xmath15 can be represented as a string of occupation number @xmath27 , with @xmath28 .",
    "the quantity of fundamental interest in the following is the average site - dependent dimer density in the stationary state , in particular we shall derive equations for the density of the lead head @xmath29 at site @xmath30 , @xmath31 .",
    "since the dimers are rigidly connected , the corresponding density for the trail head at site @xmath30 simply reads @xmath32 .",
    "the probability of having site @xmath30 in state @xmath33 will be denoted by @xmath34 .",
    "since the states mutually exclude , the probability @xmath35 immediately yields the average lead head density : @xmath36 .",
    "the coverage density @xmath37 is sum of the lead head density and the trail head density , i.e.  @xmath38 .",
    "consistently with the notation the joint probability will read @xmath39 .",
    "we also shall need the conditional probability @xmath40 , i.e.   the probability for site @xmath41 to be in state @xmath33 provided site @xmath30 is in state @xmath42 .    in the simulations we will concentrate on the average coverage density @xmath37 , and the spatially resolved current @xmath43 , defined as the flux of particle through site @xmath30 per unit time . only averages on the stationary state",

    "in this section we present the method used to perform numerical simulations and the results obtained from them .",
    "density profiles much different from the tasep motivate our interest in the model .",
    "we have simulated the stochastic equation through a kinetic monte carlo algorithm , to determine the average density profile in the stationary state with high accuracy .",
    "the results have been obtained using a random sequential updating algorithm by bortz , kalos and lebowitz ( bkl - method or @xmath49-fold way )  @xcite : a list of all sites which are possible candidates for a successful move is stored and dynamically updated .",
    "the method is ( for the present case ) faster than the conventional algorithms and constitutes a reliable way to simulate _ real time _",
    "dynamics , although here we focus on equal - time averages in the stationary state ( note that the algorithm is equivalent to gillespie s , commonly used in chemical reactions @xcite ) .    explicitly , we keep three lists of sites for the respective allowed moves : there are @xmath50 sites where particles can perform a jump forward , @xmath51 sites that may accept a particle from the reservoir , and @xmath52 sites from which a particle can detach . furthermore we keep track of the occupation of the boundaries ( @xmath53 and @xmath54 ) .",
    "one of these moves is selected randomly with the appropriate weights : @xmath55 .",
    "then we increment time by an interval drawn from an exponential distribution with timescale @xmath56 .",

    "furthermore , we have checked the ergodicity by comparing time - moving and ensemble averages .",
    "the longest simulations have been performed approximately a day on a 1ghz processor .",
    "we exemplify our results by fixing the binding constant to @xmath60 and the entrance / exit rates to @xmath61 and @xmath62 ; see fig .",

    "the on / off kinetics dominates the bulk of the density profile .",
    "however , contrary to equilibrium thermodynamics of on / off kinetics , a large directed current is simultaneously present .    for intermediate values of the detachment rate , neither the density profile nor",
    "the current is constant anymore .",
    "there appear rather narrow regions where the density steeply rises from an almost linear profile to one that approaches the isotherm value .",
    "such findings are similar to the ones of monomeric tasep coupled to langmuir kinetics @xcite , where it has been shown that the steep increase corresponds to a domain wall of a coexistence phase in the mesoscopic limit .",

    "since the stationary density profiles for tasep of monomers coupled to langmuir kinetics have been successfully described in terms of mean - field theory , it appears promising to look for an analytical description for dimers also .",
    "however , it turns out that in the case of dimers the conventional mean - field approach , i.e.  a decoupling of correlations at lowest order starting from the quantum hamiltonian formulation , see e.g.  @xcite , is inappropriate : the non - trivial correlations , arising from the fact that the particles are extended , manifest themselves already at the level of pure tasep of dimers @xcite .",
    "the failure of conventional mean - field approach requires the introduction of phenomenological methods .",
    "the aim of this section is to identify useful strategies that are capable to deal first with the simple on / off kinetics of extended objects without directed motion and second with pure tasep for dimers .",
    "we will then combine the two cases to obtain a formulation for the complete problem , and we will provide arguments that the aspects of correlations are captured on a reliable level for both processes .    the density profile in the mesoscopic limit will be described in terms of a balance equation . the evolution of the course - grained dimer density is determined by : ( a ) a flux @xmath64 of dimers within the lattice that encodes the asymmetric diffusion , ( b ) two source terms that represent the on - off kinetics of dimers : @xmath68 the non - trivial task is to provide reasonable expressions for the current and the sources in terms of the local density . in sec .",
    "[ sec : mfpd ] we shall compare the analytical results to stochastic simulations and demonstrate the validity of this approach .",
    "the dynamics of the on - off kinetics in a rate equation approach is described by the difference between a gain term @xmath69 and a loss term @xmath70 : @xmath71 these two terms are proportional to the attachment and detachment rates , @xmath3 and @xmath4 . clearly the detachment flux is exactly given by @xmath72.@xcite    an attachment event at site @xmath30 ( lead head ) requires both sites @xmath30 and @xmath73 to be empty ( i.e.  in state @xmath74 ) .",
    "the corresponding attachment flux then reads @xmath75 , and knowledge of the joint probability is needed . in order to obtain closed equations for the lead head density we break the hierarchy of joint probabilities resulting from the master equation . here , we rely on an _ ad hoc _ approximation for the conditional probabilities : @xmath76.@xcite the idea is that the probability of having site @xmath30 empty is independent of having a lead head or a hole in the site @xmath73 : note that this is precisely what usually the mean - field approximation does in monomeric lattice gases , where correlations are broken factorizing the density : @xmath77 . in appendix [ app : cp ] we show that this assumption yields a closed expression for the joint probability : @xmath78 eliminating the probabilities for single empty sites and collecting results , the rate equation for the lead head density reads : @xmath79    as a next step we perform a continuum limit . relabelling position as fraction of the system size , @xmath80 ,",
    "the density @xmath81 becomes a function @xmath82 in the mesoscopic limit @xmath83 .",

    "this value of the _ isotherm _ is consistent with the one obtained by mcghee and von hippel @xcite for the general case of @xmath2-mers .      to corroborate the results presented above",
    ", we compare the isotherm of the rate equation with the one computed from the grand canonical partition function of the tonks gas .",
    "in particular , we shall identify the fugacity @xmath91 with the binding constant @xmath92 .",
    "the statistical mechanics of the tonks gas on an open lattice consists of distributing extended objects on the @xmath47 sites , respecting the excluded volume constraint . in the case of the canonical ensemble",
    "this reduces to the combinatorial problem of counting the number of ways to distribute @xmath49 dimers on @xmath47 lattice sites . using the standard trick to represent the two occupied sites of each dimer by a `` stick '' and the @xmath93 empty sites by `` balls '' @xcite",
    ", one immediately concludes @xmath94 the corresponding grand canonical partition function is readily evaluated using the previous result @xmath95 where @xmath91 denotes the fugacity @xcite .",
    "the average density is then obtained in the thermodynamic limit by @xmath96    since the master equation of pure on / off kinetics fulfills detailed balance , the stationary state is given in terms of the grand canonical ensemble . by a single detachment event a configuration @xmath15 of @xmath49 dimers connects to some new configurations @xmath97 of @xmath98 dimers . for such configurations the detailed balance condition implies @xmath99 .",
    "conversely , the ratio can be determined also from the grand canonical boltzmann factors .",
    "since , apart from the total exclusion , energy does not enter the problem , the probabilities are determined by the number of dimers only : @xmath100 and @xmath101 . combining both expressions , we conclude @xmath102 as in the case of monomers .",
    "the last result shows that the `` isotherm '' obtained using _ ad hoc _ approximations ( sub - section [ subsec : prob ] ) is at least consistent with thermodynamics .",
    "let us mention that in equilibrium the situation is probably better than in the general case , since correlations are quickly washed out by the coupling to the reservoir",
    ". the relaxation towards equilibrium can be rather different from the naive picture of rate equations , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "in pure tasep particles can not leave or enter the track except at the boundaries . correspondingly in the bulk a conservation law holds @xmath103",
    "the currents @xmath43 can be determined by probabilistic arguments . a hopping event of a dimer at site @xmath30",
    "requires first that site @xmath30 is occupied by a lead head and second that site @xmath41 is empty .",
    "since we fixed the hopping rate to unity this yields @xmath104 hence , also in the case of pure tasep the master equation induces a whole hierarchy of joint probabilities . to close the equation we rely on the same _ ad hoc _ approximation for the conditional probabilities as for the on / off kinetics . in the appendix",

    "note that the current - density relation leads to the following boundary condition on the current : @xmath145      on the right boundary the last two sites are emptied at the same time and there is no exclusion on the last site @xmath18 , therefore the incoming current on the second last site @xmath146 is the usual one while the outgoing current is given by the occupation of the site @xmath147 ( since the last site is empty ) ; consistently with the continuity property , the outgoing current at site @xmath146 is also the gain term for the last site , while the loss term is given by @xmath148 :        it is obvious that in the continuum limit the density in the last two sites is different and only a coarse grained quantity like the average density ( which is half the coverage density ) makes sense : @xmath151 .",

    "( [ eq : bcr2 ] ) ( that gives @xmath153 ) , to obtain @xmath154 which finally gives the right boundary condition : @xmath155 the right boundary condition for the current reads : @xmath156 which has naturally the same form of the left condition because of the effective particle hole symmetry .",
    "note also that in the hd phase the particles wait a long time before detach giving rise to peculiar correlations : the ( coverage ) density profile exhibits a sawtooth profile superimposed to the analytical one . by using linear analysis on the discrete map",
    "it can be shown that these correlations decay exponentially ( but not as fast as the usual boundary layers ) to the fix point ."
