    "recent theoretical works have found that efficient structures can be generated through a self similar design principle @xcite . under external pressure and gentle compressive loading the same tendencies are found : with decreasing load , the optimal number of hierarchical orders is found to increase and a tendency towards more slender components is observed @xcite .",

    "the construction of frames with a photosensitive polymer can be used in conjunction with other techniques such as electroless nickel plating and etching , to create frames with the same geometry but constructed from hollow , metallic tubing @xcite .",
    "using such techniques , hierarchical metallic lattices , for example , have been created with structural order ranging from the nano- to the centimetre scale @xcite .",
    "such techniques make it possible to design and create materials where beneficial properties of the macrostructure are bought about through the prudent choice of design parameters at structural length scales orders of magnitude smaller .    here",
    ", a hierarchical spaceframe design constructed from hollow tubes is analysed in full and its benefits over a solid beam construction are discussed .",
    "a spaceframe constructed from solid beams is created through rapid prototyping techniques showing the fabrication of the thin walled structure to be a plausible goal .",
    "the optimal number of hierarchical levels for a given loading is found and fractal dimension of the optimal structure is calculated .",
    "we discuss particular issues of practical importance when designing and fabricating hierarchical structures .",
    "to serve as a reference , we first consider the problem of obtaining the amount of material that is required , @xmath0 , to construct a beam of length @xmath1 , freely hinged at its ends , stable under a compressive load @xmath2 .",
    "if we take an initially straight , solid , slender beam with circular cross section , constructed from an isotropic material , we see that the euler buckling mode of the strut gives the first limit on stability .",
    "the load at which this instability is reached is given by : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the second moment of area ( @xmath5 for a solid beam with circular cross - section ) and @xmath6 is the young s modulus of the material .",
    "suitable non - dimensional variables for this problem are defined as , @xmath7 measuring loading and volume respectively . for a given @xmath8 ,",
    "setting @xmath9 such that the beam is on the point of instability due to euler buckling gives us the minimum volume required for stability .",
    "this value of @xmath9 is found to be , @xmath10 thus the minimum non - dimensional volume of material , @xmath11 , required for stability for a given loading , @xmath8 , can be expressed as : @xmath12 as a comparison , it is noted that the volume of material required for stability under tension varies linearly with the loading parameter , or @xmath13 . in all practical applications",
    "the non - dimensional parameters @xmath8 and @xmath11 are much smaller than 1 .",
    "thus , to support a given magnitude of loading over a given distance requires less material if the support is under tension rather than compression .",
    "furthermore , it is seen that splitting a given load over two tension members , each supporting half the load , has little consequence on the total volume of material required ; on the other hand , as a result of the above scaling , the amount of material required increases greatly if multiple compression members are used to support a given load @xcite .    if instead the circular beam is taken to be hollow , with thin walls , two restrictions are seen to apply to the loading . the first is given by eq .",

    "secondly , a short wavelength failure mode must be considered , koiter buckling @xcite , giving a second inequality : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the poisson ratio . setting the geometry of the beam to be such that euler buckling and koiter buckling occur at the same value of loading , it is straightforward to show that @xmath18^\\frac{1}{6 } f ^\\frac{2}{3}.\\ ] ] in the regime @xmath19 this change in scaling law represents a saving in material over the solid beam . in this work , the hollow cylinder will be referred to as the generation-0 structure .",
    "the generation-1 structure is a simple spaceframe made up of @xmath20 octahedra which separate two end tetrahedra : the geometry of the spaceframe is shown in figure [ frame123 ] ( a ) with @xmath21 .",
    "here we consider the component cylinders to be hollow with thin walls .",
    "if the length of the whole structure is defined as @xmath1 , and the length of an individual component beam is @xmath22 , then , @xmath23 assuming all beams in the structure to be made up of identical beams that exhibit hookean behavior for loading less than the euler limit and whose spring constant is given by , @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the cross - sectional area of the beam . for large enough @xmath20 , the whole frame can be shown to have a bending stiffness , @xmath26 , and spring constant , @xmath27 given by : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is a constant found to be @xmath30 @xcite . if the structure is oriented such that the end points of the tetrahedra are aligned along the @xmath31-axis in cartesian coordinates , then on loading these end points with a force @xmath2 in a compressive manner , it is found that that all beams parallel with the @xmath32 plane are under tension .",
    "assuming @xmath33 the beams under tension making up the end tetrahedra support a load of @xmath34 while other tension members support a load of @xmath35 .",
    "it is found that all other beams support a compressive load .",

    "the three parameters that we wish to optimise over are @xmath9 , @xmath15 and @xmath20 .",

    "it is an analogous step that takes us from the generation-1 structure to the generation-2 structure : all simple beams in the structure that are loaded under compression are replaced by ( scaled ) generation-1 frames .",

    "it is also noted that the `` slender beam '' approximation used here is not well met by structures fabricated to date .",
    "we have shown that through a hierarchical design principle a highly efficient compression bearing structure can be created . analysing all possible modes of failure , at each length scale",
    ", we have shown that the scaling of volume of material required for stability against a given loading can be systematically varied in an advantageous manner .",

    "@xcite , a structure with @xmath20 characteristic length scales of failure obeys a relationship of @xmath96 .",
    "we have also shown the dependence of fractal dimension of the optimal structure on the applied load at failure .",
    "the dependence on loading of the optimal number of levels of hierarchy for this structure has also been obtained .",
    "further optimisation of the structure is possible : at every hierarchical level , there exist two different loading conditions for beams / sub - frames under compression . despite this , in the work presented here , all beams and sub - frames at a particular hierarhical level are equivalent ; variation of sub - frame charateristics , optimising each one for its particular loading would result in a more efficient structure",
    ".    the use of these hierarchical structures will be dependent on cost of production and robustness of the structure in their intended use .",
    "the potential trade - off between mechanical efficiency and robustness of hierarchical structures must be investigated further .",
    "it is noted that the structure presented above is minimally rigid .",
    "thus , for this particular structure , modeled with freely hinged joints , removal of a single beam ( or subframe ) will result in collapse of the structure at all larger lengthscales . in the case of non -",
    "freely hinged joints , some rigidity will be maintained however a transition from stretching to bending dominated regimes will occur .",
    "finally it is noted that the smallest possible building blocks for these hierarchical designs are single and multi wall carbon nanotubes .",
    "it has been shown that both koiter and euler buckling of these tubes are closely approximated by eqs .",
    "( [ euler_1 ] ) and ( [ koiter ] ) , up to a prefactor in the case of multi - walled carbon nanotubes @xcite .",
    "thus it is expected that the analysis shown previously will still hold .",
