    "the renormalization group ( rg ) has proved to be the most efficient tool for studying self - similar scaling behavior",
    ". first appeared within the context of quantum field theory @xcite , it was then successfully applied to a variety of problems as disparate as phase transitions , polymer dilutes , random walks , hydrodynamical turbulence , growth processes , and so on ; see , e.g. , the monorgaphs @xcite , the proceedings @xcite , and references therein .",
    "the most powerful and well - developed formulation of the rg is the field theoretic one ; see @xcite .",
    "it is this version of the rg that is simplest and most convenient in practical calculations , especially in higher orders .",
    "it is also important that it has a reliable basis in the form of quantum - field renormalization theory , including the renormalization of composite operators and operator product expansion .",
    "for this reason , the first step in the rg analysis of a given problem is to reformulate it as a field theoretic model .",
    "this means that the quantities under study should be represented as functional averages with the weight @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is a classical random field ( or set of fields ) and @xmath5 is certain action functional . for parabolic differential equations with an additive random source ,",
    "such a formulation is provided by the well - known martin  siggia",
    " rose formalism , see @xcite . in problems involving fluctuation effects in chemical reactions the somewhat more complicated approach of doi @xcite ( see also @xcite ) has also been widely used @xcite . no general recipe , however , seems to exist to cast a nonlinear problem to a field - theoretic form .",
    "such a reformulation , however , is by no means superfluous : once the field theoretic formulation has been found , it becomes possible to apply standard tools ( power counting of the 1-irreducible correlation functions etc ) to verify the renormalizability of the model , i.e. , the applicability of the rg technique , to derive corresponding rg equations , and to calculate its coefficients ( beta functions and anomalous dimensions ) within controlled approximations .",
    "an instructive example is provided by the model of the so - called true self - avoiding random walks @xcite .",
    "after its field theoretic formulation had been found @xcite , it became clear that the model in its original formulation was not renormalizable , and the direct application of the rg to it would lead to completely erroneous results .",
    "the renormalizable version of the model can be obtained by adding of infinitely many terms to the original action ; see @xcite .",
    "it has long been known , however , that symmetries of the rg type also appear in various physical problems described by ordinary or partial differential equations and integro - differential equations , whose solutions exhibit self - similar scaling behavior @xcite . since then , the list of such problems has been essentially increased ; see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein . as a rule",
    ", the field theoretic formulation for these models does not exist ( or , at least , is not known ) , and derivation of the corresponding rg equations is a nontrivial task . quoting the authors of @xcite , `` the procedure of revealing rg transformations @xmath6 in any partial case @xmath6 up to now is not a regular one . in practice , it needs some imagination and atypical manipulation ` invented ' for every particular case . '' in ref .",
    "@xcite , a general approach was proposed to constructing rg symmetries for certain classes of partial differential equations , but its relationship to the field theoretic rg techniques is not clear .",
    "the present paper is an attempt to ` bridge the gap ' between these two vast areas of the applicability of the rg : field theoretic models and partial differential equations . to be specific",
    ", we shall consider nonlinear diffusion equation of the form @xmath7 where @xmath8 is a scalar field , @xmath9 is the diffusion coefficient , @xmath10 is the laplace operator , and @xmath11 is some nonlinearity dependent on the field @xmath4 and its spatial derivatives . within the rg context , various special examples of eq .",
    "( [ diff ] ) were studied earlier in @xcite . in practical calculations",
    ", we shall confine ourselves to the nonlinearity of the form @xmath12 , where @xmath2 is not necessarily integer .",
    "we shall show that the problem ( [ diff ] ) can be cast into a field theoretic model and apply the standard rg formalism to it to establish the scaling behavior and to calculate corresponding anomalous dimensions .",
    "then we shall discuss the range of applicability of the results obtained and their relationship to the previous rg treatments of the model .",
    "we begin the analysis of the cauchy problem ( [ diff ] ) with a localized initial condition which corresponds to the equation @xmath13 for the green function @xmath14 .",
    "it will be shown later that the large - scale asymptotic behavior of this problem survives for all integrable initial conditions ( i.e. such that @xmath15 converges ) . in eq .",
    "( [ green ] ) we denote @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the dimensionality of the @xmath18 space , and @xmath19 is the full set of parameters",
    ".    the functional derivation of the msr formalism @xcite can be adopted to represent the solution of eq .",
    "( [ green ] ) as a functional integral over the doubled set of fields , @xmath4 and @xmath20 : @xmath21 . \\label{funi}\\ ] ] here the normalization constant is included into the differential @xmath22 , the action functional has the form @xmath23 with @xmath24 . the last term in ( [ green ] )",
    "can be treated as an addition to the ` interaction ' @xmath11 and gives rise to the last term in the exponential of eq .",
    "( [ funi ] ) .",
    "the term quadratic in @xmath20 , typical to the msr actions , is absent in ( [ act ] ) owing to the absence of the random force in eq .",
    "( [ diff ] ) .    representation ( [ funi ] )",
    "shows that the green function ( [ green ] ) can be viewed as the correlation function @xmath25 in the field - theoretic model with the action ( [ act ] ) .",
    "it is not convenient , however , to deal with the exponential composite operator @xmath26 .",
    "a more useful interpretation is the following : the integral ( [ funi ] ) describes the correlation function @xmath27 for the extended action @xmath28 with an ` ultralocal ' interaction term concentrated on a single spacetime point @xmath29 .",
    "the renormalization of field theoretic models with ultralocal terms , concentrated on surfaces , was studied in ref .",
    "@xcite in detail .",
    "the analysis of @xcite , which we also naturally take to apply to our case , has shown that the standard renormalization theory is applicable to such models , with some obvious modification ( see below ) .",
    "the analysis of ultraviolet ( uv ) divergences is based on the analysis of canonical dimensions ; see @xcite .",
    "dynamical models of the type ( [ act ] ) , in contrast to static models , have two scales , the length scale @xmath30 and the time scale @xmath31 .",
    "therefore , the canonical dimension of any quantity @xmath32 ( a field or a parameter in the action functional ) is described by two numbers , the momentum dimension @xmath33 and the frequency dimension @xmath34 , determined so that @xmath35 \\sim [ l]^{-d_{f}^{k } } [ t]^{-d_{f}^{\\omega}}$ ] .",
    "the dimensions are found from the obvious normalization conditions @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and from the requirement that each term of the action functional be dimensionless ( with respect to the momentum and frequency dimensions separately ) .",
    "then , based on @xmath33 and @xmath34 , one can introduce the total canonical dimension @xmath40 ( in the free theory , @xmath41 ) , which plays in the theory of renormalization of dynamical models the same role as the conventional ( momentum ) dimension does in static problems ; see @xcite .",
    "now let us turn to the special case of the model ( [ green ] ) with the extended action of the form @xmath42 where we have introduced the new parameter @xmath43 , which plays the part of the coupling constant ( a formal small parameter of the ordinary perturbation theory ) .",
    "canonical dimensions for the model ( [ extend ] ) are given in table [ table1 ] , including the dimensions of renormalized parameters , which will appear later on . from table",
    "[ table1 ] it follows that the model is logarithmic ( the coupling constant @xmath44 is dimensionless ) for @xmath45 . in what follows ,",
    "we fix the exponent @xmath46 in eq .",
    "( [ extend ] ) and consider the model in variable space dimension @xmath47 .",
    "then the uv divergences take on the form of the poles in @xmath48 in the correlation functions .",
    "the ` interaction ' is therefore irrelevant ( in the sense of wilson ) for @xmath49 , marginal ( logarithmic ) for @xmath50 , and relevant for @xmath51 ; cf . the analysis in ref . @xcite .",
    "this means that for @xmath52 , the ordinary perturbation expansion ( i.e. , series in @xmath44 ) fails to give correct infrared ( ir ) behavior and has to be summed up .",
    "the desired summation can be accomplished using the renormalization group .",
    "it is common wisdom of the renormalization theory that for the analysis of uv divergences of all correlation functions of the fields @xmath4 and @xmath20 it is sufficient to consider one - particle - irreducible ( 1pi ) correlation functions , whose graphical representation contains only graphs which remain connected after removal of one ( arbitrary ) line ( i.e. a free - field correlation or response function ) of the graph .    the total canonical dimension of an arbitrary 1pi correlation function @xmath53 in the time  coordinate representation is given by the relation @xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the numbers of corresponding fields . in ( [ gammag ] )",
    "@xmath57 is the ( dimensionless ) generating functional of 1pi green functions .",
    "it should be noted , however , that due to the presence of the ultralocal term in the action , the functional @xmath57 is _ not _ the legendre transform of the functional @xmath58 , where @xmath59 $ ] is the generating functional of green functions of the model .",
    "moreover , contrary to the usual field theories , the functional @xmath60 does not include all connected graphs of @xmath61 . by definition of the generating functional ,",
    "the 1pi green function with @xmath55 external @xmath4 legs and @xmath56 external @xmath20 legs may be obtained by @xmath55 functional differentiations of @xmath57 with respect to the field @xmath4 and @xmath56 differentiations with respect to @xmath20 .",
    "the canonical dimensions of the functional derivatives are related to the dimensions of the corresponding fields as @xmath62 = d - d^{k}_{\\phi}$ ] , @xmath63 = 1 - d^{\\omega}_{\\phi}$ ] , and similarly for the auxiliary field @xmath20 .",
    "then the total canonical dimension of the function ( [ gammag ] ) in the frequency  momentum representation ( obtained by the fourier transformation with respect to all @xmath64 independent differences of the time and coordinate arguments ) is obtained from ( [ deltac ] ) by subtracting the term @xmath65 and has the form @xmath66 where the data from table [ table1 ] are used in the last equality .",
    "the quantity ( [ deltacc ] ) is the formal index of the uv divergence for the function @xmath67 .",
    "like for usual ( local ) models , superficial uv divergences , whose removal requires counterterms , can be present only in those functions @xmath67 for which @xmath68 is a non - negative integer ; see @xcite .    from eq .",
    "( [ deltacc ] ) we conclude that for any positive @xmath17 , such divergences can exist only in the 1pi functions with @xmath69 and arbitrary value of @xmath56 . for all these functions",
    "@xmath70 , that is , the divergences are logarithmic and the corresponding counterterms in the frequency  momentum representation are constants .    at first glance",
    ", we have established that the model ( [ extend ] ) requires infinitely many counterterms , and hence it is not renormalizable .",
    "however , it turns out to be sufficient to renormalize the 1pi green function @xmath71 only to render the model finite , as we shall now show .",
    "the first few feynman diagrams of @xmath72 are shown in fig .",
    "i for @xmath73 ; the symmetry coefficients are shown for general @xmath46 ( it would be embarrassing to depict the diagrams for fractional @xmath46 , but the idea is the same ) . the lines with a slash denote the bare propagator @xmath74\\over ( 4\\pi\\nu_{0}t)^{d/2}}\\,,\\ ] ] the end with a slash corresponds to the field @xmath20 , and the end without a slash corresponds to @xmath4 .",
    "the initial ( left ) point in each diagram corresponds to @xmath75 , and the final ( right ) point with variable number of attached lines corresponds to @xmath29 .",
    "the crucial point is that , as is easily seen from fig .",
    "i , all possible 1pi subdiagrams entering into the diagrams of @xmath72 belong to the only 1pi function @xmath71 ; no other 1pi functions are involved .",
    "the function @xmath72 appears to be ` closed with respect to the renormalization , ' i.e. , we can eliminate their uv divergences by the only counterterm corresponding to its 1pi part @xmath71 .",
    "+    moreover , the renormalization of the only function @xmath71 is in fact sufficient to completely renormalize all functions with @xmath76 .",
    "a typical diagram for @xmath77 is shown in fig .",
    "it is clear that any such diagram reduces to a product of blocks that belong to the simplest function with @xmath78 ( we recall that there is no integration over @xmath29 , the only point that connects the blocks ) .",
    "therefore , the diagram contains no superficial divergences ; all its divergences are those of the subdiagrams and they are completely removed by the renormalization of the function with @xmath78 .",
    "this is equally true for any diagram of any function with @xmath76 .",
    "+    in the generic case all the loops are created by the presence of a single local vertex with any number of @xmath20 legs , from which continous chains of retarded diffusion propagators emanate . due to the structure of the nonlinear term",
    "these chains do not branch , but they may merge ( the single @xmath20-field in the nonlinearity allows only one outgoing propagator from each ordinary vertex , whereas up to @xmath46 incoming chains are allowed ) . a little reflection along the lines",
    "sketched above shows then that all divergent 1pi green functions are factorized : @xmath79 thus , we are left with the only counterterm to the function @xmath71 .",
    "it is constant ( see above ) , which in the time ",
    "coordinate representation corresponds to the function @xmath16 . in the action",
    "functional , after the integration over the field argument , this gives @xmath80 .",
    "such term is present in the extended action ( [ extend ] ) , so that our model is renormalized multiplicatively , with the only renormalization constant , which we denote @xmath81 .",
    "the renormalized action has the form @xmath82 here and below the @xmath83 and @xmath84 are the renormalized analogs of the bare parameters , @xmath85 is the reference mass in the minimal subtraction ( ms ) scheme , which we use in practical calculations , and the constant @xmath81 depends on the dimensionless parameters @xmath83 , @xmath46 and @xmath86 .",
    "the renormalized green function @xmath87 , which is finite for @xmath88 , is given by the representation ( [ funi ] ) with the substitution @xmath89 .",
    "if we now replace the local initial condition with an integrable one : @xmath90 , then ",
    "after fourier transforming  we obtain wave - vector integrals in which all the propagator lines starting from the initial condition contain a multiplicative factor @xmath91 . for the large - scale asymptotic analysis using rg",
    "it is sufficient to keep the leading small wave - number terms in all the lines which amounts to the replacement @xmath92 , and we thus return to loop integrals of the problem with localized initial condition in which @xmath93 is the amplitude of the initial @xmath94 function .    to clarify the idea , consider the one - loop graph of fig .",
    "i , whose analytic expression with the initial condition @xmath90 is @xmath95 here , @xmath96 is the diffusion propagator ( [ bare ] ) .",
    "fourier transforming @xmath97 with respect to @xmath98 we arrive at the expression @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the spatial fourier transform of the diffusion kernel ( [ bare ] ) . from the point of view of rg , the ir relevant terms are given by the leading terms of the gradient expansion of the initial condition : @xmath101 .",
    "this allows to replace ( [ g01k ] ) by @xmath102 which corresponds to the localized initial condition with the amplitude @xmath103 .",
    "it follows from eqs . ( [ act ] ) , ( [ extend ] ) , and ( [ renac ] ) that the original and renormalized action functionals satisfy the relation @xmath104 , if the bare and renormalized parameters are related as follows : @xmath105 with the only renormalization constant @xmath81 from eq .",
    "( [ renac ] ) .",
    "this implies the relation @xmath106 for the corresponding green functions in eq .",
    "( [ funi ] ) ; i.e. , this quantity is multiplicatively renormalizable .",
    "we use @xmath107 to denote the differential operation @xmath108 for fixed @xmath109 and operate on both sides of this equation with it .",

    "we shall see below that , for small @xmath51 , an ir stable fixed point @xmath115 of the rg equation ( [ rge ] ) exists in the physical region @xmath116 i.e. , @xmath117 , @xmath118 . the functions @xmath72 and @xmath87 coincide up to a constant ( i.e. , independent of the time and space variables ) factor @xmath81 and the choice of the parameters ( bare @xmath109 or renormalized @xmath119 , @xmath85 ) and can equally be used in the analysis of the ir behavior .",
    "the general solution of the rg equations is discussed in detail , e.g. , in @xcite .",
    "it follows from this solution that , when an ir stable fixed point is present , the leading term of the ir behavior of the function @xmath120 satisfies eq .",

    "we then obtain @xmath130 where the form on the ` scaling function ' @xmath131 is not determined by the equation ( [ rge2 ] ) .",
