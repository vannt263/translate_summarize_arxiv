    "the coefficient should have a value of 0.40 which is somewhat smaller than 2.85 obtained from the data of fig.1 .",

    "<S> it is shown that the critical velocity of a small sphere oscillating in superfluid helium increases with the square root of the oscillation frequency . </S>",
    "<S> this behavior can be described by a simple dimensional argument . </S>",
    "<S> the size of the sphere and the temperature of the superfluid are found to have no or only very little effect . </S>",
    "<S> surface properties of the sphere and remanent vorticity may have an influence but have not been under systematic investigation in these measurements .    </S>",
    "<S> a quantitative description of the critical velocity for the onset of turbulent drag of a macroscopic body moving in superfluid helium is still an unsolved problem although there is a large amount of experimental data available from vibrating wires , grids , quartz tuning forks , and oscillating spheres . at small driving forces @xmath0 </S>",
    "<S> the velocity amplitude @xmath1 grows linearly because the drag force due to quasiparticle scattering is proportional to the velocity . at a certain critical value @xmath2 vorticity </S>",
    "<S> is shed by the moving body and the drag increases strongly . </S>",
    "<S> typically , these velocity amplitudes are in the range from mm / s up to almost m / s @xcite , and therefore much lower than the landau critical velocity of about 50 m / s . above @xmath2 </S>",
    "<S> the velocity amplitude grows approximately with the square root of the driving force because turbulent drag is proportional to the square of the velocity @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> critical velocities for vortex production have been calculated , for a review see @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for example , a vortex ring of radius @xmath3 is calculated to expand if a critical velocity is exceeded that is given approximately by @xcite    @xmath4    where @xmath5m@xmath6/s is the circulation quantum and @xmath7 nm is the size of the vortex core or the coherence length . for a sphere of radius @xmath3 = 100 @xmath8 m this would give 2.5 mm / s for a ring of the same size . </S>",
    "<S> this is at least an order of magnitude lower than the experimental value , see below . within this picture </S>",
    "<S> , it follows that smaller vortex rings will be shed , probably because of the roughness of the surface . </S>",
    "<S> numerical simulations of vortex shedding have been performed using full biot - savart calculations and assuming a smooth sphere @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> numerically , the obtained critical velocities are of same order as in experiments . </S>",
    "<S> however , the results are somewhat sensitive to the computational accuracy and therefore the frequency dependence for @xmath2 is not extracted yet . in any case , a simple dimensional argument tells us that a characteristic velocity scale in the turbulent superfluid must be given by @xmath9 , whatever the length scale r is .    </S>",
    "<S> the question arises whether the physics will be different in case of oscillatory motion . </S>",
    "<S> the turbulent drag force @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is now the superfluid density and @xmath12 for a sphere @xcite ) differs from the classical result for steady flow only by the shift @xmath13 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this shift implies a critical velocity for the onset of turbulent drag given by @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> the shift is temperature independent @xcite , and so is this critical velocity . </S>",
    "<S> a theoretical calculation of @xmath13 is not available . </S>",
    "<S> ( it should be mentioned , however , that a similar drag force has been calculated for a body moving through a bose condensate @xcite . ) in this situation it is necessary to resort to dimensional considerations . because there is a time scale now given by the oscillation frequency @xmath15 </S>",
    "<S> , we have a new velocity scale for the onset of the turbulent regime given by @xcite    @xmath16    remarkably , there is no length scale present any more . </S>",
    "<S> there might be , however , a logarithmic term like the one in eq.(1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that this critical velocity does not or only very little depend on the size of the body . in the following , </S>",
    "<S> this scaling law is confirmed experimentally with spheres oscillating at various frequencies . in appendix 1 a model calculation based on kelvin waves is presented that supports the scaling law . in the appendix 2 , the same dimensional arguments are applied to a classical viscous liquid and shown to be consistent with analytical calculations for spheres .    </S>",
    "<S> the experiments were performed at regensburg university in the years from 1993 to 2000 . </S>",
    "<S> most of the results have been published in earlier work @xcite , but a systematic analysis of the frequency dependence of the critical velocities was only performed recently . </S>",
    "<S> the data were taken with 2 different spheres , having a radius of 100 @xmath8 m and 124 @xmath8 m . </S>",
    "<S> the smaller one was used in a @xmath17he cryostat , the other one in a dilution cryostat . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic spheres were placed inside a horizontal parallel plate capacitor consisting of niobium electrodes to which a voltage was applied while the temperature was dropped below the superconducting transition temperature of niobium , ca.10 k. at helium temperatures the charged spheres were levitating between the capacitor plates . </S>",
    "<S> frozen flux in the electrodes was necessary for a stable vertical oscillatory motion when a small ac voltage was applied at resonance . </S>",
    "<S> the frequency of the oscillations could not be controlled quantitatively because it depended on the frozen flux of the particular levitation status . </S>",
    "<S> it was observed , however , that a faster cooling rate from 10 k to 4.2 k in general lead to higher resonance frequencies . </S>",
    "<S> the critical velocities were measured by increasing the driving ac voltage from the linear flow regime to the turbulent one and back . </S>",
    "<S> the results of the various runs , all taken below 1 k , for both spheres are displayed in the figure 1 .     </S>",
    "<S> critical velocity for the onset of turbulence as a function of the frequency of 2 oscillating spheres . </S>",
    "<S> blue squares : radius @xmath18 m ; red dots : radius @xmath19 m ; green solid line : @xmath20 ( m / s ) ; temperature is below 1 k. ]    it is obvious that the predicted @xmath21 variation gives a fair fit to the data . </S>",
    "<S> the errors of the individual values of @xmath2 vary from ca . </S>",
    "<S> 1% to about 5% , depending on how closely @xmath2 was approached in the experiments . the large scatter visible near 200 hz is by far larger than any error bar . </S>",
    "<S> recently , it has been found that remanent vorticity affects the critical velocity of vibrating wires and its absence greatly increased @xmath2 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this might be a reason for the scatter . moreover </S>",
    "<S> , surface properties might affect a numerical prefactor in eq.([e.scalerel ] ) , although , as indicated above , only on some logarithmic scale , otherwise we would have had much more scatter . the mostly higher resonance frequencies of the smaller sphere are due to its smaller mass and probably also due the faster cooling rate from 10 k used with the @xmath17he cryostat . towards higher temperatures </S>",
    "<S> only a rather weak increase of @xmath2 by about 10% was observed up to 2 k @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this rules out any thermally activated process for the onset of turbulence in these experiments </S>",
    "<S> .    it will be interesting to compare these results for spheres with those for vibrating wires . </S>",
    "<S> earlier observations by the osaka group indicated frequency independent critical velocities below 2 khz @xcite . a more recent analysis by other authors @xcite did show an increase scaling approximately with @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> a more complete and very recent work of the osaka group is in fact in agreement with eq.([e.scalerel ] ) @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we are very grateful to j. jger , h. kerscher , m. niemetz , and b. schuderer for their excellent thesis work in the former low temperature group at regensburg university , from which these data were obtained . </S>",
