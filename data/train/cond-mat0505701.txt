    "the charge transfer between fe and co causes a ls - hs ( spin - crossover ) transition of co , and the magnetic moments of the co and fe couple antiferromagnetically in the high spin state ( hs ) , which results in local ferrimagnetic moment .",
    "although the ls - hs transition of pba is different from simple sc transitions , we can regard pba as a sc system in the broad sense .",
    "a new aspect of pba is the magnetic ordering at low temperatures , where the magnetic interaction between spins is important .    as another type of phase transition due to the charge transfer ,",
    "other new inorganic systems , showing magnetic changes after the spin transition , have been reported in literatures , such as mixed - valence iron complex ( nc@xmath1h@xmath2)@xmath3n[fe@xmath4fe@xmath5(dto)@xmath1](dto = c@xmath7o@xmath8s@xmath7 ) @xcite , where the charge transfer causes a change of degeneracy , and a phase transition occurs between a high temperature and low temperature states . in this system ,",
    "a magnetic transition is also observed at a low temperature .",
    "there , the spin - crossover of each atom does not occur .",
    "however , the entropy effect plays an important role in the structure change associated with the electronic configuration .",
    "it is an interesting problem to study the mechanism of combined phenomena of the structure change and magnetic transition .    in sc transition ,",
    "a cooperative distortion of the lattice occurs , which is associated with a large change in the average metal - ligand distance .",
    "indeed it increases about @xmath9 at the molecular level in the conversion from the ls to hs state which causes a volume expansion of the molecules .",
    "thus , the sc phenomenon at the microscopic scale is due to the coupling between the electronic and the vibrational structures @xcite of the molecules .",
    "that is the intra - molecular vibronic coupling .",
    "the coupling between the lattice distortion and the change of the electronic states of the molecules induces the cooperativity of sc solids .",
    "this is the microscopic origin of the elastic interaction which is responsible for the sc transition . from the experimental point of view ,",
    "optical and magnetic properties change during the sc transition , so that the switching properties can be followed by magnetic or optical ( absorption , reflectivity ) techniques .    for the analysis of these structural transition",
    ", it is largely admitted that the bistable properties at the molecular level are adequately described through a molecular configurational diagram , i.e. a plot of adiabatic energies versus distortion coordinate of the molecular system . in fig.[fig - energylevel ] , we show a unified three - states configurational diagram suited to sc and pba in the case of the low spin ( ls ) ground state .",
    "it is noteworthy that the effect of environment in molecular solids affects the configurational diagram .",
    "for example , an external pressure mainly increases the @xmath10hs@xmath11ls@xmath12 energy gap , and thus reduces energy barrier between hs and ls states in sc solids .",
    "consequently , it raises the transition temperature ( @xmath13 ) and it decreases the lifetime of the metastable hs state @xcite . in the case of pba , the same effect of pressure",
    "is also expected on the spin transition of cobalt @xcite , which would cause variation of the magnetic properties under high pressures . in the mixed - valence iron complex ( nc@xmath1h@xmath14)@xmath3n[fe@xmath4fe@xmath5(dto)@xmath1](dto = c@xmath7o@xmath15s@xmath7 ) ,",
    "the pressure effect has been reported @xcite .    to describe sc systems , a two - states ising - like model proposed by wajnflasz and pick ( wp ) @xcite",
    "is currently used . in this phenomenological model ,",
    "the hs and ls microscopic states of the molecule are associated , respectively , with the eigenvalues @xmath16  and @xmath17  of the fictitious spin operator @xmath18 with their respective degeneracies @xmath19  and @xmath20 . here , we denote by @xmath21  the degeneracy ratio , by @xmath22  the ligand field energy ( such that the ls state is the ground state at @xmath23k ) , and by @xmath24  the interaction between the molecules .",
    "@xmath25  is assumed to have an independent value on the spin states .",
    "taking into account the isomorphism @xcite between the ising model with degenerate levels and an ising model under a temperature dependent  field ",
    "@xcite , the wp hamiltonian is written as @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the sum over the interacting neighbors and @xmath18 takes 1 ( hs ) or -1 ( ls ) .",
    "@xmath28 is the interaction parameter between the sc units .    as we mentioned before , the interaction in sc solids originates from elastic strength @xcite .",
    "however , in the wp model it is expressed through the phenomenological term @xmath29 . here",
    "@xmath24 is not an exchange magnetic coupling .",
    "this term expresses the situation that an attractive force ( i.e. a ferroelastic interaction ) acts between neighboring sites in the same state ( ls - ls or hs - hs ) and a repulsive force acts between those in different states ( ls - hs ) , which leads to bistability of the ls and hs states . a more realistic treatment which includes",
    "a spin - phonon interaction leads to obtain a similar hamiltonian as ( [ wp ] ) with effective parameters @xmath24 and @xmath30  which depend on the distortions of the molecules at sites @xmath31  and @xmath32  @xcite .",
    "thus , it is important to consider here the parameters @xmath24  and @xmath30  as effective parameters which have elastic origin , even if they are taken as constants in the model in order to make the present treatment easy .",
    "the degeneracy ratio ( @xmath33 ) between the hs and ls states is related to the molar entropy change ( @xmath34 ) due to the total spin - conversion which is given by @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath37  the avogadro s number . because of both electronic , vibrational ( intramolecular ) and phonon factors , the experimental entropy changes by @xmath38jk@xmath39mol@xmath39@xcite .",
    "this corresponds to the following degeneracy values @xmath40 , which indicates that @xmath41 generally , @xmath33  depends on temperature through the temperature dependence of the phonon density of the lattice @xcite . here , we simply take @xmath33  as a constant .    the ratio of molecules in the high spin state , called hs fraction ,",
    "is denoted by @xmath42 which is expressed as a function of the `` fictitious magnetization '' @xmath43 such as @xmath44 despite of the drastic simplification of the realistic vibronic levels scheme by the two - level system , this model permits to describe with amazing success most of the quasi - static properties of the sc solids . for example , it explained consistently the change from a smooth transition to a first order transition@xcite of spin conversion between the ls and hs states as a function of the parameters of the model .",
    "it also well explained the two - step spin crossover behavior @xcite .    in order to study the magnetic properties in pba solids , etc .",
    ", we need to go beyond the 2-states model . in previous studies",
    "@xcite , focusing on the condition of the reversible switching between nonmagnetic ls state and the magnetic metastable ordered hs state which was observed in pba@xcite , the following three state model called blume - capel model @xcite was investigated : @xmath45 in this model , the spin operator @xmath46 has three states : @xmath47 , where 0 ( @xmath48 ) is associated with the ls nonmagnetic ( hs magnetic ) state . here",
    ", @xmath49 is really an exchange magnetic coupling and @xmath30 plays a role of a ligand field .",
    "reversible switching was demonstrated by a suitable change of parameters of the model assuming photon s effect is renormalized into the parameters . in addition , from a dynamical viewpoint , it has been pointed out that existence of multi - time scale dynamics is essential for the switching in both directions ( magnetic @xmath50 diamagnetic ) .",
    "that is , the difference between the time scales of the spin flip process and of structural change ( ls@xmath50hs ) process is important .",
    "this concept is very important to investigate photomagnetism of pba@xcite .    to reproduce the temperature - induced sc properties of pba , the information of the difference in degeneracies between the high temperature and the low temperature phases and the nonmagnetic interaction between molecules ( which is originated from the lattice ) have to be taken into account",
    "this is the motivation of this paper . here",
    ", we propose a model taking into account both mechanisms of the temperature - induced sc transition and of the magnetic transition .",
    "then , we extend the 3-states model @xcite ( given by the hamiltonian ( [ bcapel ] ) ) to include the mechanism in the wajnflasz and pick model ( hamiltonian ( [ wp ] ) ) . as we will see in the next section , this present model can be regarded as an extended blume - emery - griffiths ( beg ) hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that for the elastic interaction between molecules , alternative scenarios to describe the sc phenomenon have been proposed recently .",
    "some of them are based on pseudo - spins coupled by springs @xcite .",
    "the originality of this approach is that the elastic constant between two neighboring atoms depends on their electronic states . indeed , due to the expansion of the lattice in the hs state , the elastic force constants are weaker in the hs state than in the ls state .",
    "this approach leads to a hamiltonian which is equivalent to an ising - like model in which the interaction parameter depends on the local distortions of the molecules .",
    "an extension of this scenario including the intramolecular potential energy of the molecules has been published recently by one of the authors @xcite .",
    "however , due to the complicated structure of the hamiltonians , these models have been investigated only in the one dimensional case , but we expect new development of this kind of descriptions in near future .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section ii we introduce the model , section iii is devoted to study the equilibrium properties obtained by a mean - field theory . in section iv ,",
    "results of monte carlo simulations are presented . in section",
    "v , we discuss the obtained results in comparison with available experiments in the literature and we conclude .",
    "here we adopt a model based on a three states ising - like hamiltonian of @xmath51 the state @xmath52 denotes the non - magnetic state , which corresponds to the electronic configuration fe@xmath53co@xmath54 in the case of pba , and simply fe@xmath53 for sc systems .",
    "the states @xmath55 are associated with magnetic states .",
    "the magnetic state corresponds to the ferrimagnetic state fe@xmath56co@xmath57 for pba compounds , and fe@xmath58 in the case of sc solids . due to large expansion of the coordination sphere of the molecule during the spin transition ,",
    "the vibrational structure @xcite and the electronic properties between the hs and ls states are strongly affected .",
    "consequently , the degeneracies of the non - magnetic state and the magnetic state are different .",
    "let us denote by @xmath59 and @xmath60 the degeneracies of the states @xmath52 and @xmath55 , respectively , and by @xmath33 the ratio @xmath61 .",
    "here we assume that the degeneracies of the states with @xmath55 are the same and @xmath33  is temperature independent .    because the high and low spin states are described by @xmath55 and @xmath52 , respectively .",
    "the wajnflasz and pick model ( [ wp ] ) in the present three states approach , in which the degeneracies are included as entropic terms @xcite , is given by @xmath62 adding the magnetic interaction @xmath63 and the zeemann energy @xmath64 , we obtain the general hamiltonian : @xmath65 where @xmath66 @xmath67 and @xmath68 @xmath69 ( @xmath70 : the coordination number ) . here",
    "only the nearest neighbor interactions are considered for the pairing @xmath71 .",
    "the magnetic interaction between the spins is only relevant when both spins @xmath46 and @xmath72 are in the magnetic state , i.e. @xmath55 . if we do not consider the degeneracies , i.e. , @xmath73  and @xmath74 , this hamiltonian corresponds to the well known beg model.@xcite here , we adopt the form of eq .",
    "( [ ham ] ) to refer to past works on beg model .",
    "indeed , beg hamiltonian was extensively studied to describe the thermodynamical properties of the tri - critical point in he@xmath75-he@xmath76  mixtures @xcite .",
    "later , sivardire and lazerowitch @xcite used an extended version to lattice gas model of beg hamiltonian to study the condensation and phase separation in binary fluids .",
    "it is also interesting to mention that even recently , beg hamiltonian was also applied @xcite to describe the ferroelectric order thermally induced in donor - acceptor materials like ttf - tcnq @xcite .",
    "this kind of materials are also intensively studied for their photo - induced properties @xcite .",
    "in experiments , so far the spin crossover and magnetic ordering in pba take place in the range of temperature @xmath77 @xmath78 k. as typical values of the parameter of the model , extracted from the experiments @xcite , we can refer to the exchange interaction @xmath79k , the ligand - field energy gap @xmath80 k , the elastic interaction @xmath81 is about @xmath82k and the degeneracy ratio *  * @xmath83 here @xmath70 is the number of the nearest neighbor pairs .",
    "the present model describes the systems of sc and pba solids as special cases :    \\(i ) for sc systems , the magnetic interaction between the magnetic hs units is negligible because of the large distance between them ( @xmath84 @xmath85 ) @xcite .",
    "\\(ii ) in the case of pba , all the terms of the model should be taken into account , because they are effectively present .",
    "however , as far as we concern the equilibrium thermodynamics , only the electron - transfer contributes to the thermal bistability between the states fe@xmath53co@xmath54 and fe@xmath86co@xmath57 .",
    "indeed around the spin crossover transition temperature , experimentally around @xmath87k , there is no magnetic ordering .",
    "this fact suggests that the magnetic coupling @xmath88 which is about @xmath89k , is very small in comparison to the ligand - field energy gap @xmath80 k. however , in the near future , because of an amazing developments of synthesis of materials in this subject , we may expect new systems in which the magnetic and sc properties could compete .",
    "thus , we study a general structure of the phase diagram caused by @xmath90 and @xmath49 in the present paper .",
    "as we mentioned above , in the case of sc , the magnetic interaction is irrelevant and the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) without the magnetic field and magnetic interaction can be written in the following form @xmath91 it is straightforward to see that a flipping of any spin @xmath92 does not change the hamiltonian .",
    "therefore , as expected , the magnetization @xmath93 should be zero at any temperature . introducing a new variable @xmath94",
    ", the hamiltonian [ hameq ] reduces to wp model@xcite , which leads to a first order phase transition as it is well known from the literature@xcite : @xmath95 in a mean - field approximation , the order parameter of the system is @xmath96 .",
    "it corresponds exactly to the hs fraction of molecules in the system .",
    "the self - consistent equation accounting for the thermally driven first - order transition between the macroscopic ls ( @xmath97 ) and hs ( @xmath98 ) states , is given by @xmath99 so - called transition temperature @xmath13 is obtained by setting @xmath100 in the equation ( [ selfeq2 ] ) , or more simply by setting the effective field @xmath101 of the hamiltonian ( [ hsigma ] ) equal to zero .",
    "thus we have @xmath102    it is interesting to notice that occurrence of the first - order transition is only possible when the condition @xmath103 , where @xmath104 denotes the critical temperature of the pure spin @xmath105 ising model in the same lattice . in the mean - field approximation ,",
    "the curie temperature is given by @xmath106 .",
    "two types of behavior of the order parameter can be obtained in the mean - field approach depending on the ligand - field energy gap @xmath107 and the interaction @xmath90 :    \\(i ) a first - order spin - crossover transition , with a hysteresis loop , when @xmath108    \\(ii ) a smooth conversion between the two states when @xmath109 .",
    "the temperature dependence of @xmath110  is summarized in fig.[fig - mfq ] .      here , we consider the general model of sc solids in which the magnetic moments of the hs state interact magnetically , which may cause a magnetic order .",
    "therefore , in this section we consider the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) with various parameters .",
    "the model imposes two order parameters @xmath93 and @xmath111 , respectively , associated with the magnetization and the high spin fraction in the system . if @xmath112 as the case of pba , we can deal with a multi - scale energy problem in the present frame work : high energy scale for the spin - crossover phenomena ( at high temperature ) , low energy scale for magnetic phenomena ( at low temperature ) .",
    "now , let us study properties of the system ( [ ham ] ) by a mean - filed theory ( mft ) which gives the phase diagram of the model .",
    "the one site hamiltonian for this system is given by @xmath113    the associated mean - field free energy per site is given by @xmath114 minimizing the free energy ( [ elib ] ) with respect to the order parameters @xmath115 and @xmath110 , we easily obtain the following coupled self - consistent equations on @xmath115 and @xmath110 , @xmath116 and @xmath117    if @xmath118 , we reproduce naturally the case of sc previously studied . equations ( [ hmf],[mself],[qself ] ) have the same structure as that found in beg model .",
    "however , due to the temperature dependent ligand - field ( anisotropy in beg model ) we expect new behavior for the order parameters @xmath115  and @xmath110  and also a different phase diagram .",
    "putting @xmath74 gives exactly the same self - consistent equations as that published by mukamel and blume @xcite in their study of the beg model to describe the thermodynamical properties of the tricritical point in he@xmath119-he@xmath120 mixtures@xmath121 our aim here is to analyze the effect of the magnetic interaction on the spin - crossover phenomena ( @xmath122 ) .",
    "therefore , we study the following two cases :    \\1 . @xmath123    \\2 .",
    "@xmath124      this case corresponds to the situation of the sc system under a magnetic field @xcite ; the spins are too far to interact each other .",
    "in such situation , the system is paramagnetic or diamagnetic , and the magnetization has no strong effect .",
    "however , we study the effect of the magnetic field on the transition temperature and on the hysteresis loop in detail . in the present situation ,",
    "the self - consistent equations ( [ mself],[qself ] ) become @xmath126 and @xmath127    it is clear from eqns .",
    "( [ m2 ] and [ q2 ] ) that the magnetization depends linearly on the hs fraction in the system . in the limiting case , where the magnetic field is very small in comparison with the transition temperature ,",
    "the magnetization is @xmath128 in the following , we will demonstrate that the magnetic field stabilizes hs ( magnetic ) state and decreases the transition temperature @xmath13 of the system .",
    "so , we expand the equation ( [ q2 ] ) around the transition temperature of the first - order transition , for which @xmath129 by considering that @xmath130 . after some simple calculations ,",
    "we arrive at the following expression of the field dependence of transition temperature @xmath131 @xmath132 here , @xmath133 is the transition temperature of the system under zero applied magnetic field .",
    "the shift of the transition temperature @xmath134 depends on the ratio between the square of the magnetic field and the enthalpy change , @xmath135 , at the transition .",
    "these results are in good agreement with available experimental results and the microscopic analysis on sc @xcite phenomena .",
    "it follows from this result that , lowering the transition temperature @xmath136 enhances the magnetic field effect on sc systems .    on a hysteresis loop , see fig.[fig - mfqh ] , the magnetic field has as effect to shift the whole hysteresis to the low temperature side , by acting differently on the ascending and descending metastable branches . denoting , by @xmath137 ( @xmath138 ) and @xmath139 ( @xmath140 ) , the transition temperatures under the field @xmath141 ( @xmath142 ) , at the ascending and descending branches , respectively",
    ", one can deduce approximately from the equation ( [ deltateq ] ) that the associated shifts are given @xmath143 since @xmath144 , it follows that @xmath145 , which indicates that the magnetic field causes a non - symmetric distortion of the hysteresis loop of sc solids by stabilizing the hs and destabilizing the ls state .    to give an order of magnitude of the shift of the hysteresis loop",

    "first - order magnetic phase transition at @xmath177 takes place while @xmath49 becomes large from @xmath217 to @xmath218 .",
    "when we choose larger @xmath90 , @xmath13 becomes smaller and the transition at @xmath219 can become of first order ( see next section ) .",
    "let us now discuss the case of small @xmath49 for which @xmath115 is always zero . in this case , although the magnetic interaction may cause a metastable magnetic phase at low temperatures , the system simply undergoes a transition from the diamagnetic state ( ls ) to the paramagnetic state ( hs ) .",
    "this situation corresponds to the simple spin - crossover phenomena .",
    "the transition can be smooth or discontinuous as the first order transition .",
    "the latter is the case of the experimental results observed in pba , like na@xmath220co[fe(cn)@xmath221@xmath222 .",
    "2.7 h@xmath7o @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that many authors have investigated the phase diagram of the original beg model @xcite .",
    "most of works on beg model concerned the case of antiferromagnetic biquadratic interaction ( @xmath223 ) @xcite because it is expected a rich phase diagram due to competing interactions .",
    "it was found that beg model exhibits various complicate phase transitions , such as successive phase transition , re - entrant and double re - entrant double transition against the temperature . here , in the present study , both magnetic ( @xmath49 ) and biquadratic ( @xmath90)interactions are positive ( ferro ) , and as long as these interactions are  ferromagnetic  , the original beg model does not show re - entrant phases .",
    "however , in the present study we obtain a re - entrant behavior with @xmath224and @xmath225 . on the other hand ,",
    "the degeneracy of the hs state ( @xmath226)combined to the ligand field @xmath107 act as an effective temperature dependent  anisotropy ",
    "@xmath227  which is strongly reduced when temperature increases . as a consequence , in a rough approach ,",
    "the original phase diagram ( in the plane @xmath228 at constant @xmath107 ) of the original beg model ( in which @xmath74 ) is changing depending on the temperature .",
    "this effect constitutes the basic mechanism of a new competition leading to obtain re - entrant phase transitions .",
    "in the previous section , we have studied the structure of the phase diagram as a function of the lattice coupling @xmath90 and magnetic coupling @xmath49 in mft . in this section",
    ", we check the results obtained by mft using a monte carlo method where the effect of fluctuation is taken into account . here",
    ", we adopt an extended scheme of the glauber dynamics because we study only static properties of the model .",
    "we deal with three - dimensional system ( @xmath229 ) with 20@xmath23020@xmath23020 sites through this section .",
    "the dynamical properties such as the relaxation process after rapid changing of temperature or photo - irradiation will be reported in the separate paper @xcite where the types of dynamics will be carefully discussed .",
    "taking into account the degeneracy of the states , @xmath59 and @xmath60 for the low and high spin states , respectively , we adopt the following transition probability between the initial state @xmath231  and the final state @xmath232 : @xmath233 where @xmath234 *  * is the degeneracy of the *  * electronic state , represented by the fictitious spin @xmath231 ( @xmath55 for the hs state and @xmath52 for the ls state ) .",
    "thus , we have @xmath235  and @xmath236 . here",
    ", @xmath237 is given by @xmath238 *  * this energy denotes the energy of the corresponding site , which can be hs or ls and it includes elastic ( trough the  biquadratic  interaction ) and magnetic contributions due to the interactions with the neighbors .",
    "the transition probability @xmath239 satisfies the detailed balance for the canonical distribution for the degenerate state .",
    "we define the following quantity @xmath240 to study magnetic order in the mc method @xmath241 where @xmath242 means mc average and @xmath37 is the system size ( @xmath243 ) .    in figs .",
    "[ fig - qt ] , we show the temperature dependence of @xmath110 ( @xmath244 ) and @xmath245 ( @xmath246 ) . here the temperature is raised up from @xmath247 to @xmath248k sequentially , and is reduced to @xmath249k again . in fig.[fig - qt](a ) , smooth change of @xmath110 and no change of @xmath245 is depicted for @xmath170 , @xmath142 , @xmath211 , @xmath250k and @xmath172k . the transition temperature ( @xmath251 ) is larger than the critical temperature ( @xmath252 ) of the corresponding ising model and no phase transition occurs .",
    "we find that the plotted circles for both upward and downward processes are well superimposed at each temperature . in fig.[fig - qt ] ( b ) and ( c ) , we plot @xmath110 and @xmath245 in the case of the first order phase transition , respectively , where @xmath211 , @xmath253k , and @xmath172k , giving @xmath254 ( @xmath255 k ) , for @xmath170 , @xmath142 ( @xmath244 ) and for @xmath256 ( @xmath257 , @xmath258 ) .",
    "we performed relatively short steps ( 200mcs ) at each temperature for figs 6 , which is enough to get equilibrium for case ( a ) , leading well visible hysteresis loops of @xmath110 for case ( b ) .",
    "the shape of the hysteresis changes with the duration time in principle . indeed ,",
    "if we change the temperature infinitesimally slow , the system would change in a quasi - static way and the hysteresis would disappear .",
    "however , in practice , the nature of metastability is robust and the shape of the hysteresis changes little in the case with @xmath259 mcs at each temperature . in the fig.[fig - qt](b ) we also confirm the field - dependence of the shape of the hysteresis obtained in the previous section by mft .",
    "triangles ( @xmath257 ) denote the case @xmath260 and squares ( @xmath258 ) @xmath261 .",
    "shift of hysteresis curve to the low temperature side is observed and the shift is more prominent in downward process .    here , we study the effect of magnetic interaction on the spin - crossover phase transition .",
    "we consider the case where the magnetic interaction @xmath49 is nonzero . if we include weak magnetic interaction , the qualitative nature of the order parameter @xmath110 does not change , although the interaction causes a metastable branch of magnetically ordered state at low temperatures .",
    "this effect will be reported when we study the dynamical properties of the system @xcite . here",
    ", we investigate the change of equilibrium phases which were studied in the previous section in mft . in order to change the structure of phase diagram",
    "we need a strong magnetic interaction which is comparable to @xmath262 . in figs.[fig - qmt ] , temperature dependence of @xmath110 and @xmath240 is depicted for @xmath263(k ) and @xmath172(k ) , where @xmath264 , with @xmath265(k ) .",
    "at each temperature , @xmath266 mcs are performed to obtain the data .",
    "we find that the magnetization appears at intermediate temperatures .",
    "decreasing the temperature , magnetization appears continuously at the critical temperature @xmath267k where the phase transition is of the second order as was predicted in mft , and vanishes discontinuously in the first order phase transition at @xmath268k , where the hs fraction changes discontinuously .",
    "now , we study dependence of the critical temperatures @xmath269 and @xmath270 as a function of @xmath49 for the case @xmath250(k ) , @xmath172(k ) and @xmath211 , where @xmath271 . in fig.[fig - tcm](a ) , the dependence is depicted , where the closed circles denote the temperature at which @xmath188 .",
    "the transitions depicted by the closed circles occur smoothly .",
    "the closed triangles denote @xmath177 and the close boxes @xmath269 . the magnetic transition at @xmath177 changes from second order to first order with @xmath272 between @xmath273 and @xmath274 .    as another example , we also give the phase diagram in fig.[fig - tcm](b ) for the case @xmath275(k ) and @xmath172(k ) , where @xmath276 .",
    "then the closed circles denote the phase boundary of the first order phase transition .",
    "technically we obtain @xmath13 and @xmath177 of the first order phase transition as follows .",
    "we prepare an initial condition where half of the system is in ls state ( @xmath52 ) and the other half is in the magnetic hs state ( @xmath277 ) .",
    "we perform mc simulations with different random number sequences for given @xmath49 and observe the relaxation of @xmath110 and @xmath240 .",
    "when all samples go to ls ( hs para , hs magnetic ) phase , we regard the parameter set as belonging to the ls ( hs para , hs magnetic ) phase .",
    "we could determine the border within the precision of the size of the closed circles and closed triangles .",
    "these phase diagrams are very similar to those obtained by mft in the previous section .",
    "it is interesting to study the intermediate parameter region between ( a ) and",
    "( b ) , where the line connecting the closed circles with the smooth transition ( case ( a ) ) changes to that with the first order phase transition ( case ( b ) ) .",
    "the phase diagram of the system with the spin - crossover phase transition and the magnetic phase transition has been studied using an extended beg model with degenerated levels by means of the mean - field theory and monte carlo simulations .",
    "this model can be a model for both sc and pba materials in the framework of a common description .",
    "the present model can be also seen as an extension to 3 states of the wajnflasz and pick model for spin - transition @xcite .",
    "this unified approach contains both  elastic  and magnetic interactions between the molecular species .",
    "these two kind of interactions obey to different symmetries , and then involve two different order parameters . indeed , the terms responsible for the sc phenomena are the temperature - dependent ligand field @xmath278 and the biquadratic @xmath279 interaction , which modulate the energy between hs and ls states , leading to the gradual or first - order transition . on the other hand , the magnetic interaction @xmath280 , assumed here as ferromagnetic ,",
    "acts only between the hs units , which breaks the symmetry , and leads to the second - order or first - order magnetic transition when it competes with the sc transition .",
    "we found that when the magnetic interaction is weak , it does not cause a magnetic phase transition at even very low temperature at equilibrium .",
    "it only causes a metastable magnetic state at very low temperature .",
    "this is consistent with the observation in pba .",
    "the properties of the metastable state will be reported in the study of dynamics @xcite .",
    "it has also been found that the magnetic interaction causes a magnetic order in the hs phase at intermediate temperatures , i.e. @xmath281 . the magnetic order disappears at a lower temperature than @xmath177 .    even in the condition of @xmath90 and @xmath107 that @xmath165 changes smoothly when @xmath170 , i.e. , @xmath271 , the magnetic interaction drives the spin crossover transition which causes the first - order transition for large @xmath49 .    as we have referred in the text ,",
    "the dynamical properties of the present model are also very interesting and important in the light of recent experimental extension of photo magnetization.@xcite they would be related to a description of the photo - magnetic behavior of pba , in particular , of the relaxation properties of the photo - induced magnetic state . there ,",
    "the relaxation of two coupled magnetic and elastic order parameters , which have different time scales , is involved.@xcite    [ sec : matome ] the present work was supported by grant - in - aid for scientific research from ministry of education , science , sports , culture , and technology of japan , and centre national de la recherche scientifique ( cnrs , pics  japon n@xmath282 ) of france .",
