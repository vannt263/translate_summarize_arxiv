    "in a hierarchical scenario , the interactions affects general properties of the galaxies such as star formation rate , nuclear activity and morphology @xcite    although galaxy pairs @xcite and groups with four or more members @xcite have been the subject of several papers in the literature , there are far few works on triplets of galaxies , a link between pairs and groups and a potentially interesting laboratory to investigate several process associated to galaxy evolution .    traditionally , galaxy groups selection have excluded triplets of galaxies because these systems were not considered as bonafide physical structures , i.e. , dynamically isolated systems .",
    "nevertheless , @xcite have recently analysed a sample of galaxy triplets derived from the catalogue of isolated triplets of @xcite finding signatures of physical interactions ( tidal bridges , excess of barred galaxies ) , that implies that most of these objects are indeed real physical structures .",
    "pioneering works on the identification of triplets of galaxies were performed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these authors present a list of 84 northern isolated galaxy triplets with members with component apparent magnitudes brighter than 15.7 , selected by visual inspection of palomar sky survey prints .",
    "they found that about 24@xmath7 of the members are elliptical and lenticular galaxies , while 76@xmath7 are spirals and irregulars .",
    "numerous studies have been made in the follow up of this catalogue .",
    "@xcite measured radial velocities for the isolated triplets and found that 5@xmath7 of the systems are spurious ( @xmath8 ) , 31@xmath7 consist of a pair of galaxies with nearly equal radial velocities ( @xmath9 ) and a projected third component and 64@xmath7 are considered physical triplets ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "velocity dispersion , diameters , integrated luminosity , virial mass , and the virial mass to luminosity ratio were estimated for the physical triplets @xcite . the spatial configuration ,",
    "dynamics and dark matter content of these systems was studied by several authors @xcite . for the southern sky ( @xmath10 )",
    "@xcite selected 76 isolated triple systems of galaxies using the eso / serc and poss - i sky surveys , with the same criteria defined fort the northern systems .",
    "@xcite compiled a list of 108 triplets of galaxies selected from two group catalogues , those of @xcite ( northern sky ) and @xcite ( southern sky ) .",
    "38 of these systems are considered isolated .",
    "the authors call these systems `` wide triplets '' in contrast to the compact triplets ( with smaller mean projected harmonic separation ) studied by @xcite . the main assumed difference between wide and compact systems , regardless their difference in size , is that galaxies in compact triplets are supposed to have interacted many times and are probably in equilibrium within the system .",
    "in contrast , wide triplets would be dynamically young and probably far from virialization .",
    "a high - order 3d voronoi tessellation method was employed by @xcite for identifying single galaxies , pairs and triplets on a volume - limited sample of galaxies from the sloan digital sky survey data release 5 .",
    "nevertheless , a catalogue of triplet of galaxies has not been compiled for more recent sdss releases .    in this work we present a catalogue of triplets of bright galaxies ( @xmath11 ) selected from a volume limited sample extracted from sdss - dr7 in the redshift range @xmath12 .",
    "we used data with both spectroscopic redshift measurements and photometric redshifts from @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we describe the galaxy samples used in this work .",
    "section 3 describes the algorithm developed for the detection of triplet of galaxies candidates .",
    "the implementation of this algorithm at low redshifts is described in section 4 . in this section",
    "we also perform a completeness and contamination test to our algorithm and analyse the incompleteness effect due to fiber collisions .",
    "section 5 describes the extension of our results to higher redshifts . in section 6",
    "we describe the isolation criteria employed to define the final sample of triplet of galaxies .",
    "finally , section 7 summarized the results obtained in this work .    throughout this paper",
    "we adopt a cosmological model characterised by the parameters @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "the samples of galaxies used in this work were drawn from the data release 7 of sloan digital sky survey ( sdss - dr7 , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "sdss @xcite has mapped more than one - quarter of the entire sky , performing photometry and spectroscopy for galaxies , quasars and stars .",
    "sdss - dr7 is the seventh major data release , corresponding to the completion of the survey sdss - ii .",
    "it comprises @xmath16 sq .",
    "deg . of imaging data , with an increment of @xmath17 sq .",
    "deg . , over the previous data release , mostly in regions of low galactic latitude .",
    "sdss - dr7 provides imaging data for 357 million distinct objects in five bands , _ ugriz _ , as well as spectroscopy over @xmath18 steradians in the north galactic cap and @xmath19 square degrees in the south galactic cap .",
    "the average wavelengths corresponding to the five broad bands are @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24  @xcite . for details regarding the sdss camera",
    "see @xcite ; for astrometric calibrations see @xcite .",
    "the survey has spectroscopy over 9380 sq .",
    "; the spectroscopy is now complete over a large contiguous area of the northern galactic cap , closing the gap that was present in previous data releases .    in this work we employed spectroscopic and photometric data extracted from sdss - dr7 .",
    "the spectroscopic data were derived from the main galaxy sample ( mgs ; @xcite ) obtained from the ` fits ` files at the sdss home page .",
    "k - corrections for this sample were calculated using the software ` k - correct_v4.2 ` of @xcite .",
    "the photometric data were derived from the photometric catalogue constructed by @xcite .",
    "these authors compute photometric redshift and k - correction for the photometric data of the sdss - dr7 .",
    "the @xmath25 of the photometric redshift is @xmath26 0.0227 and k - corrections were obtained through joint parametrisation of redshift and reference frame ( at @xmath27 ) @xmath28 colour . for both data sets ,",
    "k - corrected absolute magnitudes were calculated from petrosian apparent magnitudes converted to the ab system .    in order to use these spectroscopic and photometric data ,",
    "it is necessary to analyse the completeness and reliability of these samples . to explore this issue",
    "we have calculated the spatial number density of galaxies brighter than @xmath0 for both spectroscopic and photometric data , taking into account the apparent magnitude limit @xmath29 and @xmath30 , respectively . in figure [ f1 ]",
    "it can be appreciated that the spatial number density of galaxy for , both , spectroscopic and photometric samples , shows a flat trend up to @xmath31 and @xmath32 respectively .",
    "the spatial number density of galaxies for the photometric data shown in figure 1 corresponds to a random sample with @xmath33 of the complete photometric sample .",
    "the first sample , hereafter s1 , comprises galaxies brighter than @xmath29 with spectroscopic redshift in the range @xmath34 .",
    "this sample was employed for the detection of triple systems of galaxies candidates at low redshift .    in order to analyse the effect of photometric errors over the radial velocity differences @xmath35 for the photometric data , we have selected a sample that comprises galaxies brighter than @xmath29 with spectroscopic measurements in the redshift range @xmath36 for which we have obtained photometric redshifts",
    ". we will refer to this sample hereafter as the s2 sample .",
    "we have also extracted a sample of galaxies brighter than @xmath29 , that comprises galaxies with spectroscopic measurements in the redshift range @xmath37 and galaxies with photometric redshifts in the range @xmath38 ( hereafter s3 ) .",
    "this sample was employed in the analysis of completeness due to fiber collision , described in section 4 .",
    "finally , for the detection of triplets of galaxies candidates at intermediate redshift we employed a sample derived  from the photometric catalogue of @xcite .",
