    "the image slices are then shifted in @xmath37 and @xmath38 with sub - pixel accuracy to align and center the star at @xmath40 in each cube ( the cubes are later padded with a 251st row and column of zeros to place the center of the star in the center pixel ) . as the radial position of reference spots and speckle noise is wavelength dependent , we can also derive a radial scaling relation , scale each image , and use cross - correlation for even finer sub - pixel image registration .",
    "this is all handled in the _ cube alignment centering and stacking _ ( cacs , r.  nilsson et al .",
    "2017 , in preparation ) pipeline module , which gives a final image registration accuracy of @xmath50.2 pixel ( 1-@xmath41 deviation ) , and saves a hypercube ( @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the number of exposures ) for our speckle suppression algorithms .",
    "aperture photometry of the reference spots also allow us to determine the @xmath39 location of two telluric water absorption bands in our spectra ( at 1100 and 1380 nm ) , which together with knowledge of the instrument filter bandpass edges can be used to derive the shift and stretch function that aligns the cubes in the wavelength dimension .",
    "the wavelength - dependent speckle noise was modeled and subtracted using both klip @xcite and s4 @xcite , to check for consistency .",
    "both algorithms employ principal component analysis ( pca ) , but with component decomposition performed in different dimensions .",
    "loeve image projection is used to decompose the speckle noise pattern into its principal components ( pcs ) by projecting companion - free regions of an image onto a karheunen ",
    "loeve basis .",
    "the algorithms then use the most prominent set of pcs to forward model speckle noise in the image to remove flux associated with the speckles but not with a putative companion .",
    "speckle reduced ( residual ) images in each channel and cube were filtered by convolving them with a model point - spread function ( psf ) core to reduce noise , producing a `` detection map '' in which we could search for companion signals @xcite .",
    "we also produced signal - to - noise ( s / n ) maps by local calculation of the noise in each area of the residual image , using two different methods : ( 1 ) noise calculation in concentric annuli around the star ( as normally done in high - contrast coronagraphic images with radially decreasing noise profiles ) , and ( 2 ) calculating the standard deviation of count levels in @xmath44 pixel boxes around each pixel , with the inner @xmath45 pixels left out . with the moving - box method",
    "we get an estimate of the increased noise along the astrometric spot trails , in regions that are cut out in the first method in order not to suppress overall s / n .",
    "the difference in calculated s / n between the two methods turns out to be less than 10% in areas outside the spot trails .",
    "significant peaks were found by @xmath41-clipping and searching for regional maxima .",
    "detected peaks were weighted by s / n and summed up for each location , producing a list of the locations with the strongest peaks . at these locations we extracted raw mean spectra to compare with a range of reasonable companion spectra , and to exclude locations with a raw spectrum dominated only by bright peaks in the noisy water absorption channels .",
    "we also excluded peaks along the radial paths of the four astrometric reference spots .      after locating the centroid pixel of a detected point - source in the residual cubes , we run s4 s spectral extraction code , which again performs speckle - suppression on the aligned and centered hypercube , but this time with local optimization in the area where the suspected companion is located . by varying the model parameters ( such as the size of test zone , @xmath46 and @xmath47 , and the number of pcs , @xmath48 , used ) , and measuring the change of the extracted candidate companion spectrum , as well as of a number of ( typically 50 ) background points and fake source insertions at the same radius , the parameters that minimize the noise and most faithfully retrieve the fake source spectrum can be determined .",
    "this ensures that the speckle noise is optimally modeled and subtracted , without attenuating the companion flux by overfitting the data .",
    "a brief justification of chosen optimal s4 spectral extraction parameters is presented in section  [ sec : pc_opt ] .",
    "the results agree with the more rigorous treatment demonstrated in a.  veicht et al .",
    "( 2017 , in preparation ) .",
    "note that in the spectral extraction we also simultaneously fit both the speckle and companion models to the observed data , and the spectrum of the companion model is being jointly estimated along with the pca coefficients of the companion model .",
    "the s / n of an extracted companion spectrum will thus in general be higher than for the original detection signal .",
    "the total gain in s / n from the full optimization procedure is about a factor of two in @xmath3 and @xmath4 compared to the initial detection image .",
