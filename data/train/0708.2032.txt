    "the transport properties of two - dimensional electron gases ( 2degs ) in spatially varying magnetic fields show a rich phenomenology , and several interesting effects have been reported recently .",
    "for example , magnetic superlattices @xcite show commensurability oscillations in the magnetotransport , while giant magnetoresistance effects have been found on one - dimensional magnetic arrays @xcite . also , a variety of single magnetic nanostructures have been investigated via their influence on the 2deg , like resistance resonances along magnetic edge states @xcite , the experimental realization of magnetic waveguides @xcite , or the demonstration of hall sensing @xcite .",
    "a magnetic nanostructure of elementary character , known as _ single magnetic barrier - mb _ , is formed by the highly localized perpendicular ( @xmath1- ) component @xmath2 of the magnetic fringe field in a 2deg below the edge of a ferromagnetic film magnetized in transport ( @xmath3- ) direction @xcite .",
    "alternatively , such a structure can be defined in a 2deg with a graded step @xcite .",
    "various aspects of mbs have been studied in the past few years .",
    "the height of the mb can be conveniently tuned by in - plane magnetic fields , while their magnetoresistance is interpreted in a semiclassical picture @xcite , within which electrons experience a deflection by @xmath2 , such that for a fixed fermi energy , the angle of incidence determines whether the electrons get transmitted or reflected @xcite .",
    "mbs in quantum wires , on the other hand , have attracted a lot of recent attention from theory .",
    "these studies have established the potential of mbs as tunable spin filters @xcite and predict the presence of fano resonances @xcite . + in all experiments reported so far , the resistance of mbs has been investigated as a function either of a magnetic field applied in x - direction , or of the carrier density @xcite .",
    "therefore , the polarity of the total magnetic field in z - direction @xmath4 is constant .",
    "a qualitatively new situation arises when @xmath4 changes its sign across the mb , since novel types of trajectories with a snake orbit character become possible .",
    "+ in the present paper , we report the experimental implementation of such a magnetic barrier structure .",
    "it is generated by superimposing a homogeneous perpendicular magnetic field @xmath5 to @xmath6 .",
    "this way , a mb of constant strength and shape is displaced along the @xmath7 - axis .",
    "the most interesting situation arises when @xmath5 partly compensates @xmath6 , such that lines of zero magnetic field along the y - direction exist , which act as guiding centers for snake orbits . in this range ,",
    "a pronounced dip of asymmetric shape in the magnetoresistance is observed .",
    "we explain this structure by an interplay of the conductance enhancement along y direction due to snake orbits with both elastic scattering as well as @xmath0 drifts at the edges of the hall bar .",
    "numerical simulations based on the kubo formalism and the landauer - bttiker model substantiate this interpretation",
    ". + the outline of the paper is as follows : section ii is dedicated to the experimental results .",
    "an interpretation of the data with the help of simulations is given in section iii , followed by a summary in section iv .",
    "the experiments have been performed on a commercially available @xmath8 - heterostructure @xcite with a 2deg @xmath9 below the surface . the sample geometry is shown in fig . [",
    "fig:1](a ) .",
    "the samples were prepared by optical lithography , followed by wet chemical etching for the definition of the hall bar , or by metallization steps , respectively .",
    "au / ge ohmic contacts were defined at source and drain contacts and at the voltage probes .",
    "a dysprosium ( dy ) platelet with a thickness of @xmath10 was deposited on the heterostructure surface by thermal evaporation at a base pressure of @xmath11 .",
    "a cr / au layer of @xmath12 thickness was deposited on top to prevent the dy from oxidizing under ambient conditions .",

    "conventional four - probe measurements as a function of perpendicular magnetic field @xmath5 were performed , from which an electron density of @xmath19 and a mobility of @xmath20 ( corresponding to a drude scattering time of @xmath21 and an elastic mean free path of @xmath22 ) were obtained at a temperature of @xmath16 .",

    "five samples were measured , all with qualitatively identical behavior . here , we focus on the sample with the strongest mb of @xmath33 for @xmath34 , corresponding to a saturation magnetization of @xmath35 .    with the mb established this way , we superimpose a homogeneous , perpendicular magnetic field @xmath5 . for this purpose ,",

    "thus , rotating the sample in this range corresponds to a displacement of @xmath6 along the @xmath7 - axis , as sketched in fig . [ fig:2](b ) .",

    "it is well known that periodic , one - dimensional superstructures ( the homogeneous direction being the y - direction ) in 2degs can increase the diffusion in y - direction , which leads to a positive magnetoresistance @xmath85 around @xmath86 @xcite .",
    "the situation in our experiments is different , since ( i ) @xmath87 , and ( ii ) @xmath6 is asymmetric about @xmath81 . while the first point causes a simple displacement of @xmath88 in the @xmath5 - direction , the second one generates asymmetries in @xmath88 . in particular ,",
    "@xmath89 which , according to eq . , increases @xmath90 as compared to @xmath91 . from this point of view , our experiments on single mbs are complementary to previous studies on periodic one - dimensional magnetic superlattices with vanishing average magnetic field , where both a positive magnetoresistance around b=0 and commensurability oscillations at higher magnetic fields have been found @xcite .",
    "apparently , the positive magnetoresistance does not require a periodic structure and the related commensurate orbits , but rather emerges already from a single unit cell of the superlattice .",
    "the quantitative differences from the measurements have several origins . in the simulated array , trajectories that are commensurate with the lattice",

    "[ fig:4 ] in comparison to the experiment .",
    "we find good agreement after a constant resistance of @xmath102 is added to the simulated trace of @xmath45 .",

    "the snake orbits , on the other hand , are present in the interval @xmath111 , in which @xmath112 changes polarity .",
    "their weights fluctuate , with an overall tendency to drop in the range where edge orbits exist .",

    "a detailed discussion of these features is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "the simulations thus confirm that the increase of @xmath30 for @xmath115 is caused by elastic scattering , an interpretation that is in tune with that one obtained within the kubo model .",
    "we note that at lower mobilities , scattering between various snake orbits smears the simulated resistance fluctuations .",
    "the resistance of a magnetic barrier as a function of superimposed , homogeneous perpendicular magnetic fields has been investigated both experimentally and theoretically .",
    "the magnetoresistance shows a characteristic asymmetric dip at a homogeneous magnetic field of opposite direction to that one of the barrier .",
    "simulations show that electrons can travel along the barrier in snake orbits as well as in cyclotron - type orbits with magnetic - field gradient induced drifting centers . at the sample edges ,",
    "edge orbits exist due to @xmath0 drifts .",
    "they effectively couple @xmath108 to @xmath109 , thereby reducing the resistance of the magnetic barrier .",
    "the observed asymmetric resistance dip is interpreted in terms of the combined effects of ( i ) enhancement of @xmath108 , ( ii ) transmission via edge orbits and ( iii ) elastic scattering in the barrier region .",
    "simulations based on the multi - terminal landauer - bttiker model without adjustable parameters result in excellent agreement with the experiment .",
