    "techniques for the measurement of risk are central to the process of managing risk in financial institutions and beyond . in banking and insurance",
    "it is standard to model risk with probability distributions and express risk in terms of scalar - valued risk measures . formally speaking , _ risk measures _ are mappings of random variables representing profits and losses ( p&l ) into real numbers representing capital amounts required as a buffer against insolvency .",
    "there is a very large literature on risk measures and their properties , and we limit our survey to key references that have had an impact on practice and the regulatory debate . in a seminal work",
    "@xcite proposed a set of desirable mathematical properties defining a _ coherent _ risk measure , important axioms being _ subadditivity _ , which is essential to measure the diversification benefits in a risky portfolio , and _ positive homogeneity _ , which requires a linear scaling of the risk measure with portfolio size .",
    "@xcite defined the larger class of _ convex _ risk measures by replacing the subadditivity and positive homogeneity axioms by the weaker requirement of convexity ; see also @xcite .",
    "the two main risk measures used in financial institutions and regulation are value - at - risk ( var ) and expected shortfall ( es ) , the latter also known as tail value - at - risk ( tvar ) .",
    "var is defined as a quantile of the p&l distribution and , despite the fact that it is neither coherent nor convex , it has been the dominant risk measure in banking regulation .",
    "it is also the risk measure used in solvency ii insurance regulation in europe , where the solvency capital requirement ( scr ) is defined to be the 99.5% var of an annual loss distribution .",
    "expected shortfall at level @xmath3 is the conditional expected loss given exceedance of var at that level and is a coherent risk measure @xcite .",
    "for this reason , and also because it is a more tail - sensitive measure of risk , it has attracted increasing regulatory attention in recent years .",
    "es at the 99% level for annual losses is the primary risk measure in the swiss solvency test ( sst ) . as a result of the fundamental review of the trading book  @xcite",
    "a 10-day es at the 97.5% level will be the main measure of risk for setting trading book capital under basel iii  @xcite .    for a given risk measure , it is vital to be able to estimate it accurately , and to validate estimates by checking whether realized losses , observed ex post , are in line with the ex ante estimates or forecasts .",
    "the statistical procedure by which we compare realizations with forecasts is known as _",
    "the literature on backtesting var estimates is large and is based on the observation that when var at level @xmath3 is consistently well estimated the _",
    "var exceptions _ , that is the occasions on which realized losses exceed var forecasts , should form a sequence of independent , identically distributed ( iid ) bernoulli variables with probability @xmath4 .    an early paper by @xcite proposed a binomial likelihood ratio test for the number of exceptions as well a test based on the fact that the spacings between violations should be geometrically distributed ; see also @xcite .",
    "the simple binomial test for the number of violations is often described as a test of _ unconditional _ coverage , while a test that also explicitly examines the independence of violations is a test of _ conditional _ coverage . @xcite",
    "proposed a test of conditional coverage in which the iid bernoulli hypothesis is tested against the alternative hypothesis that violations show dependence characterized by first - order markov behaviour ; see also the recent paper by @xcite .",
    "@xcite further developed the idea of testing the spacings between var violations using the fact that a discrete geometric distribution can be approximated by a continuous exponential distribution .",
    "the null hypothesis of exponential spacings ( constant hazard model ) is tested against a weibull alternative ( in which the hazard function may be increasing or decreasing ) . @xcite",
    "provide a comprehensive overview of tests of conditional coverage .",
    "they advocate , in particular , the geometric test and a regression test based on an idea developed by @xcite for checking the fit of the caviar model for dynamic quantiles .",
    "the literature on es backtesting is smaller .",
    "@xcite suggest a bootstrap hypothesis test based on so - called violation residuals .",
    "these measure the discrepancy between the realized losses and the expected shortfall estimates on days when var violations take place and should form a sample from a distribution with mean zero .",
    "@xcite look at similar kinds of statistics and suggest the use of monte carlo hypothesis tests .",
    "recently @xcite have proposed a z - test for a discretized version of expected shortfall which extends to other so - called spectral risk measures ; see also @xcite where the idea is extended to propose a traffic light system analogous to the basel system for var exceptions .",
    "a further strand of the backtesting literature looks at backtesting methods based on _",
    "realized @xmath5 values _ or probability - integral - transform ( pit ) values .",
    "these are estimates of the probability of observing a particular ex post loss based on the predictive density from which risk measure estimates are derived ; they should form an iid uniform sample when ex ante models are consistent with ex post losses .",
    "rather than focussing on point estimates of risk measures ,  @xcite show how realized @xmath5-values can be used to evaluate the overall quality of density forecasts . in @xcite",
    ", the authors extended the density forecast evaluation to the multivariate case .",
    "@xcite studied various issues left open , and proposed and validated mathematically a method based on pit also in situations with overlapping forecast intervals and multiple forecast horizons .",
    "@xcite proposed a test of the quality of the tail of the predictive model based on the idea of truncating realized @xmath5-values above a level @xmath3 .",
    "a backtesting procedure for expected shortfall based on realized @xmath5-values may be found in @xcite .",
    "some authors have cast doubt on the feasibility of backtesting expected shortfall .",
    "it has been shown that estimators of es generally lack robustness @xcite so stable series of es estimates are more difficult to obtain than var estimates .",
    "however ,  @xcite point our that the concept of robustness , which was introduced in statistics in the context of measurement error , may be less relevant in finance and insurance , where extreme values often occur as part of the data - generating process and not as outliers or measurement errors ; they argue that ( particularly in insurance ) large outcomes may actually be more accurately monitored than smaller ones , and their values better estimated .",
    "@xcite showed that es is not an _ elicitable _ risk measure , whereas var is ; see also @xcite and @xcite on this subject .",
    "an elicitable risk measure is a statistic of a p&l distribution that can be represented as the solution of a forecasting - error minimization problem .",
    "the concept was introduced by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "when a risk measure is elicitable we can use _ consistent _ scoring functions to compare series of forecasts obtained by different modelling approaches and obtain objective guidance on the approach that gives the best forecasting performance .",
    "although @xcite suggested that the lack of elicitability of es called into question our ability to backtest es and its use in risk management , a consensus is now emerging that the problem of _ comparing _ the forecasting performance of different estimation methods is distinct from the problem of addressing whether a single series of ex ante es estimates is consistent with a series of ex post realizations of p&l , and that there are reasonable approaches to the latter problem as mentioned above .",
    "there is a large econometrics literature on comparitive forecasting performance inlcuding  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that es satisfies more general notions of elicitability , such as _ conditional elicitability _ and _ joint elicitability_. @xcite introduced the concept of conditional elicitability .",
    "this offers a way of splitting a forecasting method into two component methods involving elicitable statistics and separately backtesting and comparing their forecast performances . since es is the expected loss conditional on exceedance of var , we can first backtest var using an appropriate consistent scoring function and then , treating var as a fixed constant , we can backtest es using the squared error scoring function for an elicitable mean .",
    "@xcite show that var and es are jointly elicitable in the sense that they jointly minimize an appropriate bi - dimensional scoring function ; this allows the comparison of different forecasting methods that give estimates of both var and es .",
    "see also  @xcite who introduce a new concept of `` backtestability '' satisfied in particular by expected shortfall . in this paper",
    "our goal is to propose a simple approach to backtesting which may be viewed in two ways : on the one hand as a natural extension to standard var backtesting that allows us to test var estimates at different @xmath3 levels _ simultaneously _ using a multinomial distribution ; on the other hand as an _ implicit _",
    "backtest for es .",
    "although the frtb has recommended that es be adopted as the main risk measure for the trading book under basel iii @xcite , it is notable that the backtesting regime will still largely be based on looking at var exceptions at the 99% level , albeit also for individual trading desks as well as the whole trading book .",
    "the basel publication does however state that banks will be required to go beyond the basic mandatory requirement to also consider more advanced backtests .",
    "they list a number of possibilities including : tests based on var at multiple levels ( they explicitly mention 97.5% and 99% ) ; tests based on both var and expected shortfall ; tests based on realized @xmath5-values .",
    "the idea that our test serves as an implicit backtest of expected shortfall comes naturally from an approximation of es proposed by @xcite . denoting the es and var of the distribution of the loss @xmath6 by @xmath7 and @xmath8",
    ", these authors suggest the following approximation of es : @xmath9\\ ] ] where @xmath10 .",
    "this suggests that an estimate of @xmath11 derived from a model for the distribution of @xmath6 could be considered reliable if estimates of the four var values @xmath12 derived from the same model are reliable .",
    "it leads to the intuitive idea of backtesting es via simultaneously backtesting multiple var estimates at different levels . in this paper",
    "we propose multinomial tests of var exceptions at multiple levels , examining the properties of the tests and answering the following main questions :    * does a multinomial test work better than a binomial one for model validation ? * which particular form of the multinomial test should we use in which situation ? * what is the optimal number of quantiles that should be used in terms of size , power and stability of results , as well as simplicity of the procedure ?    a guiding principle of our study is to provide a _",
    "simple _ test that is not much more complicated ( conceptually and computationally ) than the binomial test based on var exception counts , which dominates industry and regulatory practice .",
    "our test should be more powerful than the binomial test and better able to reject models that give poor estimates of the tail , and which would thus lead to poor estimates of expected shortfall .",
    "however , maximizing power is not the overriding concern .",
    "our proposed backtest may not necessarily attain the power of other tests based on realized @xmath5-values , but it gives impressive results nontheless and we believe it is a much easier test to interpret for practitioners and regulators .",
    "it also leads to a very intuitive traffic - light systems for model validation that extends and improves the existing basel traffic - light system .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows .",
    "the multinomial backtest is defined in section  [ sec : mtest ] and three variants are proposed : the standard pearson chi - squared test ; the nass test ; a likelihood ratio test ( lrt ) .",
    "we also show how the latter relates to a test of  @xcite based on realized @xmath5-values . a large simulation study in several parts",
    "is presented in section  [ sec : numerical ] .",
    "this contains a study of the size and power of the multinomial tests , where we look in particular at the ability of the tests to discriminate against models that underestimate the kurtosis and skewness of the loss distribution .",
    "we also conduct static ( distribution - based ) and dynamic ( time - series based ) backtests in which we show how fictitious forecasters who estimate models of greater and lesser quality would be treated by the multinomial tests .",
    "based on the results of section  [ sec : numerical ] , we give our views on the best design of a simultaneous backtest of var at several levels , or equivalently an implicit backtest of expected shortfall , in section  [ sec : proc - impl - backt ] .",
    "we show also how a traffic - light system may be designed . in section",
    "[ sec : empirical ] , we apply the method to real data , considering the standard & poor s 500 index .",
    "conclusions are found in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "suppose we have a series of ex - ante predictive models @xmath13 and a series of ex - post losses @xmath14 .",
    "at each time @xmath15 the model @xmath16 is used to produce estimates ( or forecasts ) of value - at - risk @xmath17 and expected shortfall @xmath18 at various probability levels @xmath3 .",
    "the var estimates are compared with @xmath19 to assess the adequacy of the models in describing the losses , with particular emphasis on the most extreme losses .    in view of the representation  , we consider the idea proposed in  @xcite of backtesting the es estimates indirectly by simultaneously backtesting a number of var estimates at different levels @xmath20 .",
    "we investigate different choices of the number of levels @xmath0 in the simulation study in section  [ sec : numerical ] .",
    "we generalize the idea of   by considering var probability levels @xmath20 defined by @xmath21 for some starting level @xmath3 . in this paper",
    "we generally set @xmath22 corresponding to the level used for expected shortfall calculation and the lower of the two levels used for backtesting under the basel rules for banks  @xcite ; we will also consider @xmath23 in the case when @xmath2 since this is the usual level for binomial tests of var exceptions . to complete the description of levels we set @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "we define the violation or exception indicator of the level @xmath26 at time @xmath15 by @xmath27 where @xmath28 denotes an event indicator for the event @xmath29 .",
    "it is well known  @xcite that if the losses @xmath19 have conditional distribution functions @xmath16 then , for fixed @xmath30 , the sequence @xmath31 should satisfy :    * the _ unconditional coverage _ hypothesis , @xmath32 for all @xmath15 , and * the _ independence hypothesis _ , @xmath33 is independent of @xmath34 for @xmath35 .",
    "if both are satisfied the var forecasts at level @xmath26 are said to satisfy the hypothesis of correct _ conditional coverage _ and the number of exceptions @xmath36 has a binomial distribution with success ( exception ) probability @xmath37 .",
    "testing simultaneously var estimates at @xmath0 levels leads to a multinomial distribution .",
    "if we define @xmath38 then the sequence @xmath39 counts the number of var levels that are breached .",
    "the sequence @xmath40 should satisfy the two conditions :    * the _ unconditional coverage _ hypothesis , @xmath41 for all @xmath15 , * the _ independence hypothesis _",
    ", @xmath42 is independent of @xmath43 for @xmath35 .",
    "the unconditional coverage property can also be written @xmath44 here @xmath45 denotes the multinomial distribution with @xmath46 trials , each of which may result in one of @xmath47 outcomes @xmath48 according to probabilities @xmath49 that sum to one .",
    "if we now define observed cell counts by @xmath50 then the random vector @xmath51 should follow the multinomial distribution @xmath52 more formally , let @xmath53 be an arbitrary sequence of parameters and consider the model where @xmath54 .",
    "we test null and alternative hypotheses given by @xmath55      various test statistics can be used to evaluate these hypotheses . @xcite provide a relevant numerical study of the properties of five possible tests of multinomial proportions . here",
    "we propose to use three of them : the standard pearson chi - square test ; the nass test , which performs better with small cell counts ; a likelihood ratio test ( lrt ) .",
    "more details are as follows .    1 .",
    "_ pearson chi - squared test _  @xcite .",
    "the test statistic in this case is @xmath56 and a size @xmath57 test is obtained by rejecting the null hypothesis when @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the @xmath60-quantile of the @xmath61-distribution .",
    "it is well known that the accuracy of this test increases as @xmath62 increases and decreases with increasing @xmath0 .",
    "_  @xcite .",
    "+ nass introduced an improved approximation to the distribution of the statistic @xmath63 defined in , namely @xmath64 where @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "+ the null hypothesis is rejected when @xmath67 , using the same notation as before .",
    "the nass test offers an appreciable improvement over the chi - square test when cell probabilities are small .",
    "_ lrt _ ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "+ in a lrt we calculate maximum likelihood estimates @xmath68 of the parameters @xmath69 under the alternative hypothesis h1 and we form the statistic @xmath70 under the unrestricted multinomial model @xmath54 the estimated multinomial cell probabilities are given by @xmath71 , and are thus zero when @xmath72 is zero , which leads to an undefined test statistic .",
    "+ for this reason , whenever @xmath73 , we use a different version of the lrt to the one described in  @xcite .",
    "we consider a general model in which the parameters are given by @xmath74 where @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 denotes the standard normal distribution function . in the restricted model we test the null hypothesis h0 : @xmath78 and @xmath79 against the alternative h1 : @xmath80 or @xmath81 . in this case",
    "we have @xmath82 where @xmath83 and @xmath84 are the mles under h1 , so that the problem of zero estimated cell probabilities does not arise .",
    "the test statistic @xmath85 is asymptotically chi - squared distributed with two degrees of freedom and the null is rejected if @xmath86 .      in the case",
    "where @xmath2 we carry out an augmented set of binomial tests . for the lrt in the case @xmath2 ,",
    "there is only one free parameter to determine ( @xmath87 ) and we carry out a standard two - sided asymptotic likelihood ratio test against the unrestricted alternative model ; in this case the statistic is compared to a @xmath88-distribution .",
    "it may be easily verified that , for @xmath2 , the pearson multinomial test statistic @xmath89 in   is the square of the binomial _ score _ test statistic @xmath90 which is compared with a standard normal distribution ; thus a two - sided score test will give identical results to the pearson chi - squared test in this case .",
    "in addition to the score test we also consider a _ wald _",
    "test in which the @xmath3 parameter in the denominator of   is replaced by the estimator @xmath91 .    as well as two - sided tests , we carry out one - sided variants of the lrt , score and wald tests which test @xmath92 against the alternative @xmath93 ( underestimation of var ) .",
    "one - sided score and wald tests are straightforward to carry out , being based on the asymptotic normality of @xmath94 . to derive a one - sided lrt",
    "it may be noted that the likelihood ratio statistic for testing the simple null hypothesis @xmath95 against the simple alternative that @xmath96 with @xmath97 depends on the data through the the number of var exceptions @xmath98 . in the one - sided lrt",
    "we test @xmath99 against a binomial distribution ; this test at the 99% level is the one that underlies the basel backtesting regime and traffic light system .",
    "the multinomial lrt has a natural continuous limit as the number of levels @xmath0 goes to infinity , which coincides with a test proposed by  @xcite based on _ realized @xmath5-values_. our lrt uses a multinomial model for @xmath100 in which we assume that @xmath101 and in which we test for @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "the natural limiting model as @xmath102 is based on the random variable @xmath103 . for simplicity",
    "let us assume that @xmath16 is a continuous and strictly increasing distribution function and that @xmath104 so that the event @xmath105 is identical to the event @xmath106 where @xmath107 is known as a realized @xmath5-value or a pit ( probability integral transform ) value . if the losses @xmath19 have conditional distribution functions @xmath16 then the @xmath108 values should be iid uniform by the transformation of  @xcite .",
    "it is easily verified that @xmath109 @xcite proposed a test in which @xmath110 is modelled by a truncated normal , that is a model where @xmath111 and in which we test for @xmath78 and @xmath79 to assess the uniformity of the realized @xmath5-values with emphasis on the tail ( that is above @xmath3 ) . since @xmath112 , the berkowitz model   is equivalent to a model where @xmath113 which is the natural continuous counterpart of the discrete model in  .",
    "we recall that the main questions of interest are : does a multinomial test work better than a binomial one for model validation in terms of its size and power properties ? which of the three multinomial tests should be favoured in which situations ? what is the optimal number of quantiles that should be used to obtain a good performance ?    to answer these questions , we conduct a series of experiments based on simulated data . in section  [ sec : size - power ] we carry out a comparison of the size and power of our tests .",
    "the power experiments consider misspecifications of the loss distribution using distributional forms that might be typical for the trading book ; we are particularly interested to see whether the multinomial tests can distinguish more effectively than binomial tests between distributions with different tails .    in sections  [ sec : stat - backt - exper ] and",
    "[ sec : dyn ] we carry out _ backtesting _ experiments in which we look at the ability of the tests to distinguish between the performance of different modellers who estimate quantiles with different methodologies and are subject to statistical error .",
    "the backtests of section  [ sec : stat - backt - exper ] take a static distributional view ; in other words the true data generating process is simply a distribution as in the size - power comparisons of section  [ sec : size - power ] .    in section  [ sec : dyn ]",
    "we take a dynamic view and consider a data - generating process which features a garch model of stochastic volatility with heavy - tailed innovations .",
    "we consider the ability of the multinomial tests to distinguish between good and bad forecasters , where the latter may misspecify the form of the dynamics and/or the conditional distribution of the losses .        to judge the effectiveness of the three multinomial tests ( and the additional binomial tests )",
    ", we compute their size @xmath114 ( type i error ) and power @xmath115 ( 1- type ii error ) . for a given size",
    ", regulators should clearly be interested in having the most powerful tests for exposing banks working with deficient models .    checking the size of the multinomial test requires us to simulate data from a multinomial distribution under the null hypothesis ( h0 ) .",
    "this can be done indirectly by simulating data from any continuous distribution ( such as normal ) and counting the observations between the true values of the @xmath26-quantiles .    to calculate the power",
    ", we have to simulate data from multinomial models under the alternative hypothesis ( h1 ) .",
    "we choose to simulate from models where the parameters are given by @xmath116 where @xmath117 and @xmath118 are distribution functions , @xmath119 denotes the generalized inverse of @xmath117 , and @xmath117 and @xmath118 are chosen such that @xmath120 for one or more values of @xmath30 .",
    "@xmath118 can be thought of as the true distribution and @xmath117 as the model .",

    "carrying out tests with a controlled size is important , particularly for preserving amicable relationships between regulators and banks who would not want their best models incorrectly rejected .",
    "however , high power is arguably most important for a regulator who wants a tool for exposing deficient risk models .",
    "as expected , the multinomial test at multiple var levels is superior to the standard binomial exception test in distinguishing between good and bad trading book models , particularly in longer backtests .",
    "it is able to expose methods that will underestimate tail risk and thus lead to an underestimation of capital according to the es measure .",
    "our study shows that simultaneously backtesting exceptions at @xmath149 or @xmath146 quantile levels yields a very effective test in terms of balancing simplicity and reasonable size and power properties : it addresses the deficiencies of the binomial test in discriminating between models with different tail shapes and it is clearly superior to a test at two quantile levels , an idea suggested in  @xcite .    our multinomial backtest could easily be performed as a regular routine , in the same way that the binomial backtest is currently carried out based on daily data .",
    "we have shown that it is possible to design a traffic - light system for the application of capital multipliers and the imposition of regulatory interventions that is completely analogous to the current traffic - light system based on var exceptions over a 250 day period at the 99% level .",
    "we would also suggest moving to longer backtesting periods than 250 days to obtain more powerful discrimination between good and bad backtesting results .",
    "there are of course many other possible backtesting procedures and if developing powerful statistical tests is the main priority , then methods based on realized @xmath5-values ( or pit values ) such as the tests of  @xcite and  @xcite could also be considered .",
    "there are also interesting new joint testing procedures of expected shortfall and var proposed by  @xcite relying on monte - carlo simulation .",
    "however , the multinomial tests have the considerable virtue that they are easy to understand , explain and implement as extensions of the standard binomial test .",
    "they may thus stand a better chance of gaining acceptance from banks and their regulators .",
    "finally we note that the multinomial tests may also have a role in extreme value theory ( evt ) where they could be considered as a further tool , like the mean excess plot , for distinguishing between light and heavy tails ; see  @xcite for more discussion of statistical methods for analysing extreme data .",
