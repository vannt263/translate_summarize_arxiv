    "ag@xmath0co(cn)@xmath1 has attracted a lot of attention due to its colossal positive and negative thermal expansion  @xcite , and also because of its giant negative linear compressibility  @xcite . the negative thermal expansion ( nte ) along the @xmath3-axis and the positive thermal expansion ( pte ) along the @xmath4(@xmath5 ) axes",
    "are an order of magnitude larger than that observed in many other crystalline solids .",
    "the material also shows negative linear compressibility ( nlc ) , namely along the @xmath3-axis , that is several times greater than the typical value found in crystals . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : primitive ] , the ambient - pressure phase of ag@xmath0co(cn)@xmath1 has a trigonal structure with space group @xmath6 .",
    "the structure consists of layers of kagome sheets of ag atoms in the @xmath7 crystal plane at height @xmath8 , with co ",
    "co chains along the @xmath9 lattice directions linking [ co(cn)@xmath1]@xmath11 octahedra .",
    "these chains are hinged together in a way that gives the structure a high degree of flexibility ; expansion in the trigonal @xmath7 plane is accompanied by a shrinkage in the orthogonal direction in a way that does not change the relevant bond lengths .",
    "ambient phase @xmath6 of ag@xmath0co(cn)@xmath1 : ( a ) unit cell with silver in red , cobalt in blue , carbon in black and nitrogen in white grey ; ( b ) looking down the @xmath12 $ ] direction with ag atoms ( red ) in a kagome sheet connected to the octahedra [ co(cn)@xmath1]@xmath11 anions ( blue ) above and below.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    previous _ ab initio _ density functional theory ( dft ) calculations were unable to reproduce the correct ground - state structure and the high - pressure phase of the material  @xcite . whilst these studies were able to reproduce the lengths of the co  c , c  n and n  ag bonds which characterise the structure , the predicted lattice parameters differ considerably from the experimental values .",
    "the key interatomic distance that changes as the structure flexes is the ag ",
    "ag distance , which is equal to half the value of the @xmath4 lattice parameter .",
    "the first of the dft studies  @xcite showed that a _ post hoc _ correction for dispersive interactions between the ag cations was sufficient to shift the equilibrium dft structure into good agreement with the experimental crystal structure .",
    "the same study also showed that there is no significant covalent bonding between neighbour ag atoms ; it was this factor , combined with the fact that dft calculations on the structural analogue in which hydrogen or deuterium atoms replace the ag atoms are in excellent agreement with experiment , that suggested an important role for dispersive ag@xmath2ag interactions .    on this basis , it would be useful to see if a dft calculation that explicitly includes a correction for the long - range dispersive forces will reproduce the ground state and the high - pressure phase of ag@xmath0co(cn)@xmath1 correctly .",
    "if so , it should then be possible to obtain reliable phonons via such calculation in order to better understand the exotic behaviour of this material .",
    "modern implementations of dft now include a correction for the long - range dispersive interactions  @xcite .",
    "one widely used method is called ` dft+d2 '  @xcite where a dispersive interaction that is dampened at short range to avoid double counting of energy is added to the dft energy from the generalised - gradient approximation ( gga ) calculation . semi - empirical parameters in such a dispersive interaction are provided in ref .   for most elements in the periodic table .",
    "the method has been successfully applied to various materials in which the dispersive interactions are important .",
    "one good example is the recent work on cesium halides by zhang et al .",
    "@xcite , where the dft+d2 formalism gives both an improved agreement between the optimised and experimental crystal structures and a correct prediction of the ground - state phases .    in this work ,",
    "we have carried out dft+d2 calculations for ag@xmath0co(cn)@xmath1 .",
    "this has confirmed that the inclusion of dispersive forces give the correct ground state structure , as anticipated in the first dft study of this material  @xcite .",
    "it is also shown that the dft+d2 model correctly gives the structure of the high - pressure phase ; without the dispersive interaction dft gives a structure without the interdigitation found experimentally  @xcite .",
    "on the basis of these successes it is now reasonable to investigate the lattice dynamics of ag@xmath0co(cn)@xmath1 , from which we have been able to study a number of physical and thermodynamic properties .",
    "these form the focus of this paper .",
    "the dft calculations were performed using the castep code  @xcite . for comparison , we used both local - density approximation ( lda ) and gga of perdew - burke - ernzerhof ( pbe )  @xcite for the exchange - correlation functional .",
    "optimized norm conserving pseudopotentials generated using the rrkj method  @xcite as implemented in the opium package and with parameters from the rappe and bennett library  @xcite were used in various calculations .",
    "a plane - wave basis set was used with the cut - off energy of 1800  ev .",
    "sampling of the brillouin zone was performed on a @xmath13 monkhorst - pack ( mp )  @xcite grid .",
    "the geometries of all structures were optimised using the bfgs method to achieve a convergence of less than @xmath14 ev per atom change in energy per cycle and a force residual of @xmath15  ev /  . at different pressures , tolerance for accepting convergence of the maximum stress component during unit cell optimization",

    "[ fig : cote ] is that @xmath47 , that is @xmath48 , which has a negative value , becomes less negative on compression .",

    "if @xmath53 were positive as would usually be the case , this would give the unusual property of the material becoming harder at higher temperature  @xcite , but in this case @xmath53 , as the inverse of @xmath54 is negative ( see table  [ tab : compliance ] ) , and thus @xmath53 becomes less negative on heating with @xmath54 becoming more negative .",

    "since the compliances listed in table  [ tab : compliance ] change little with pressure , any significant change of the cte with pressure must be due to the change of the overall grneisen parameters .",
    "in the temperature range of 0500 k , only contributions from the low - frequency modes ( @xmath57 thz ) ( fig .  [",

    "similarly , since @xmath61 is negative and @xmath62 is positive , @xmath55 and @xmath56 would also contribute constructively to the negative value of @xmath48 .",

    "[ fig : overallgamma ] shows that there is a significant decrease of @xmath55 and a smaller decrease of @xmath56 on compression .",
    "according to eqs  [ linearcteab ] and  [ linearctec ] , the first effect is more dominant and results in the large decrease in the magnitude of both @xmath40 and @xmath41 with pressure , corresponding to the conventional decrease of elastic moduli on heating ( @xmath63 ) and the heat enhancement of nlc ( @xmath64 ) , respectively .",
    "it is interesting to note this enhancement of nlc on heating could not happen without the hinging mechanism in the structure working efficiently , because it is this mechanism that gives almost the same magnitudes to @xmath61 and @xmath62 ( as discussed in section  [ groundstate ] ) , which in turn provide the same weighting of @xmath55 and @xmath56 in their contributions to @xmath41 .",
    "if we had the case where the hinging is not effective , a much smaller value of @xmath61 compared to @xmath62 would make the decrease of @xmath58 dominate , resulting in a decrease of @xmath41 on compression ( corresponding to @xmath65 ) ; in this case the enhancement of nlc on heating would not be observed .",

    "is due to the large decrease of @xmath55 . in particular ,",

    "the significant decrease on compression of @xmath55 is attributed to the large decrease in @xmath19 of most low - frequency modes ( @xmath71  thz ) , especially the modes with frequencies @xmath72  thz ( as those at wave vector a in fig .",

    "the scissor - like behaviour of the change of linear cte seen in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : cote ] , namely the decrease of @xmath40 accompanied by the increase of @xmath41 upon compression , makes the combined @xmath67 in eq .",
    "[ linearctev ] close to zero at high pressure .",
    "the large value of @xmath59 due to the weak interaction between ag atoms in the @xmath4@xmath5 plane makes sure that the contribution from @xmath55 to @xmath40 in eq .",
    "[ linearcteab ] dominates , so that @xmath40 would decrease largely according to the decrease of @xmath55 . on the other hand ,",
    "as discussed in the previous section , the effective hinging mechanism guarantees the similarly large increase of @xmath41 .",
    "thus , it is the dispersive interaction together with the hinging mechanism that make @xmath40 and @xmath41 change with pressure like a scissor .    according to the relation  @xcite",
    "@xmath73 the giant reduction of @xmath67 with pressure implies a giant decrease of @xmath74 on heating . from eq .",
