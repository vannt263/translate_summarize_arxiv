    "the effect of spin - orbit ( so ) coupling on the energy spectrum of quantum dots ( qds ) and metallic grains has attracted notable attention in the recent years @xcite .",
    "much experimental and theoretical effort has concentrated on the magnetization of mesoscopic samples .",
    "for example , measurements of the g - factors of nano - particles using tunneling spectroscopy @xcite have led to several theoretical studies@xcite which treated the electrons in the quantum dots as non - interacting particles .",
    "other theoretical studies have considered interactions as well , while investigating the interplay between interactions and disorder in quantum dots without so coupling .",
    "it was shown that the combination of these effects can lead to non - trivial spin polarization @xcite . in this paper",
    "we present an additional mechanism which can lead to spin polarization and non - trivial g - factor , where the role typically played by disorder is taken by the so coupling .",
    "usually the g - factor is defined through the splitting of the kramers doublets @xcite in the presence of a weak magnetic field .",
    "namely , the g - factor of the @xmath0-th single - particle level with spin @xmath1 is given by @xmath2}{\\mu_b h},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) is the corresponding energy level in the presence ( absence ) of a weak magnetic field @xmath5 and @xmath6 is the bohr magneton .",
    "the spin index @xmath7 is used to denote the two time - reversed states according to the sign of the @xmath8 component of their average magnetic moments . in the absence of a magnetic field",
    "each level is two - fold degenerate , and this degeneracy is lifted by the magnetic field , which increases the energy of one of the levels and decreases the energy of the other .",
    "therefore , @xmath9 as defined by this formula can have either sign , depending on the direction of the energy change .",
    "the ground - state energy always decreases when a magnetic field is applied , thus the g - factor of the ground - state obtained by eq .",
    "( [ eqn : g_gdef ] ) is positive .",
    "usually , the value of @xmath10 does not depend on the spin index , at least to zeroth order in @xmath5 , so that one can denote the g - factor of the @xmath0-th level as @xmath11 , with the convention that @xmath12 .    for free electrons",
    "the g - factor is constant , @xmath13 for each level @xmath0 , and this value is more or less correct also for bulk measurements in various metals @xcite .",
    "however , in experiments performed on metallic nano - particles , values which are significantly less than the free value of the g - factor were obtained@xcite .",
    "moreover , large fluctuations in the measured values were seen .",
    "these findings attracted much theoretical attention , and resulted in studies which have obtained , within the framework of the random matrix theory ( rmt ) , a description of the g - factor probability distribution in the presence of so coupling and disorder but in the absence of interactions @xcite . in a recent work",
    ", the statistical properties of these distribution functions were related to several physical observables @xcite . according to these results , the so coupling influences the probability distribution of the g - factors of the discrete energy levels .",
    "the distribution function was shown to be universal , where the width is expressed in terms of various physical parameters .",
    "the presence of strong so coupling and disorder results in sample to sample fluctuations of the g - factor .",
    "moreover , the g - factor is expected to fluctuate also between different levels of a specific sample , with a distribution function determined by rmt .",
    "indeed , recent measurements of nano - particles have obtained g - factors which seem to be consistent with rmt predictions .",
    "for example , several experimental studies of metallic three dimensional nano - particles have shown the reduction of the measured g - factor as a function of the spin - orbit coupling strength . for aluminum nano - particles ,",
    "in which the so coupling is negligible , the measured g - factor values are approximately those of free electrons @xcite ( i.e. , @xmath14 ) , while for gold nano - particles , in which the so coupling is strong , the measured g - factors were in the range of @xmath15.@xcite furthermore , by extracting several g - factors from each sample , petta and ralph have succeeded to present an impressive confirmation of the theoretical rmt distribution function @xcite .    nevertheless , according to eq .",
    "( [ eqn : g_gdef ] ) the g - factor measurement should compare the specific single - particle energy level before and after the magnetic field is applied .",
    "however , practical experiments usually differ from that approach in two points .",
    "first , measurements are usually related to the total energy of the system , and not to that of a specific level .",
    "second , the measurement of the energy is sometimes indirect , as is the case in tunneling spectroscopy .    these two points can be ignored if one neglects the interaction between particles . for a non - interacting system with an odd number of electrons , @xmath16 ,",
    "the change of the total ground - state energy due to magnetic field is equivalent to that of the highest filled level .",
    "@xmath17 electrons populate @xmath18 kramers pairs , where in each pair one level increases and the other decreases in the presence of a magnetic field , so that their total contribution vanishes .",
    "the only contribution to the g - factor comes from the single electron occupying one level of pair @xmath19 , so that if we define the g - factor of the ground - state with @xmath20 electrons by @xmath21}{\\mu_b h},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath22 represents the total ground - state energy in the presence of a magnetic field @xmath5 , then @xmath23 .",
    "in addition , when the number of electrons @xmath20 is even , the total ground - state energy is not expected to change when a magnetic field is applied , since all the filled levels divide into pairs , in which the movement of one level is compensated by the other ( to first order in @xmath5 ) .",
    "therefore , for an even number of electrons , a calculation of the g - factor using eq .",
    "( [ eqn : g_gdef2 ] ) gives @xmath24 .",
    "the second point , regarding the indirect energy measurement , requires an interpretation of the experimental results . for example , using tunneling spectroscopy one measures the gate voltage value for which a conductance peak of a qd occurs . at such an event",
    "the energies of the qd with @xmath17 and @xmath20 electrons and the gate voltage @xmath25 are related by the equation @xmath26 .",
    "when a magnetic field is applied , the position of the peak will change as a function of @xmath5 .",
    "therefore , by denoting the measured g - factor by @xmath27 , one can analyze the peak motion in order to determine the g - factor , by calculating @xmath28}{\\mu_b h }   = g(n_e ) - g(n_e-1).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since either @xmath20 or @xmath17 is even , its corresponding g - factor vanishes , and thus @xmath27 is equivalent to the other g - factor .",
    "namely , @xmath29 or @xmath30 .",
    "actually , since each peak is split in the presence of a magnetic field into two peaks having an opposite magnetic field dependence , extracting @xmath27 from successive peaks results in the set of the single - particle g - factors , i.e. @xmath31 .    as mentioned above ,",
    "measurements done using tunneling spectroscopy have indeed obtained g - factors which can be interpreted using rmt predictions . nevertheless , as we have discussed , eq .",
    "( [ eqn : g_gdef2 ] ) is equivalent to eq .",
    "( [ eqn : g_gdef ] ) only for systems of non - interacting particles .",
    "once interactions between electrons are important , it should be emphasized that eq .",
    "( [ eqn : g_gdef2 ] ) is a definition of a * many - particle g - factor * , which depends on the total magnetization of the ground - state wave - function .",
    "for example , one can obtain spin contribution to the g - factor which is larger than @xmath32 , a phenomenon that can not happen for a single - particle g - factor.@xcite indeed , by adding an interaction term to the rmt hamiltonian , an increase of the g - factor fluctuations was reported.@xcite it was shown that the interactions result in a possibility of getting non - trivial spin values in the ground - state , and accordingly in an optional enhancement of the g - factor to values greater than @xmath32 .",
    "although the theoretical studies of refs .   and were performed for an odd - electron occupation , their results suggest the possibility of a non - trivial spin polarization for the even - electron case as well .",
    "if , for any reason the g - factor of an even - electron ground - state indeed differs from zero , then _ the quantity measured in tunneling spectroscopy may not equal the single - level g - factor nor the many - particle g - factor_. in such a case it should be related to the difference between two many - particle g - factors , as shown in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : g_gdef_tot ] )    in principle , the above description of the g - factor holds for both metallic and semiconducting dots .",
    "however , in semiconducting dots the strength of the so coupling can be tuned by use of a gate voltage@xcite .",
    "furthermore , several significant implications of so effects in semiconductors , such as spin - polarized field effect transistor@xcite and spin hall effect@xcite , have recently attracted notable attention .    with this in mind , we investigate in the current paper the ground - state magnetization properties of semiconducting qds with so coupling where interactions between the electrons are considered .",
    "we show that the interplay between the so coupling and the electron - electron interactions may result in a level crossing ( lc ) between the two lowest many - body levels .",
    "when these states are close in energy , the magnetic field splits them into two polarized states with a finite magnetization . as a result , there is a possibility to have a significant g - factor in the two - particle ground - state .",
    "finally , we propose an experimental method which can be used in order to observe the predicted phenomenon .",
    "we note that we have neglected so far in the introduction the orbital effect and its influence on the magnetization of nano - particles . for three - dimensional ( 3d ) nano - particles",
    "this is reasonable@xcite . on the other hand , for two - dimensional ( 2d ) systems the orbital effect",
    "is expected to play an important role .",
    "for example , due to the orbital effect , the single - particle g - factor can exceed the value of @xmath32 .",
    "in addition , the g - factors of two levels belonging to the same kramers pair , @xmath33 and @xmath34 , might be different . as a result ,",
    "the g - factor of the doubly occupied ground state , which can be simply written , when the electrons are non - interacting , as @xmath35 , may not vanish .",
    "however , this contribution to @xmath36 which is the quantity of interest in this work , is linear in the magnetic field @xmath5 , and thus can be neglected for the weak fields used in such measurements .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we describe the model hamiltonian we use in order to incorporate , beside the magnetic field , both so coupling and interactions between electrons . in section",
    "[ sec : g_i0 ] we present results for a system with non - interacting particles , which are shown to reproduce some known ground - state properties .",
    "in addition , we find that there are specific values of the so coupling strength , in which the kramers doublet remains degenerate even when a magnetic field is applied .",
    "the effects of interplay between so and electron - electron interactions are considered in section [ sec : g_i ] .",
    "our results point out that a finite magnetization can be obtained for systems with an even - particle occupancy . in section [ sec : g_phys ] we discuss the experimental relevance of this finding , i.e. , the possibility that it might affect practical g - factor measurements .",
    "in order to model the semiconducting qd we use a tight - binding description of a finite 2d lattice with @xmath37 columns and @xmath38 rows ( the number of sites is denoted by @xmath39 ) , with open boundary conditions , which is occupied by @xmath20 electrons . as a result of a coupling between the spin degree of freedom and the orbital motion a finite probability for spin - flips during hopping processes exists . separating the interactions from the free part ,",
    "one can write the hamiltonian as @xmath40 , where the free part in the absence of disorder can be divided to a hopping term and a zeeman term , i.e. @xmath41 . the hopping part of the hamiltonian is @xmath42 where @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) is a creation ( annihilation ) operator of an electron with spin @xmath1 in the lattice site placed in row @xmath45 and column @xmath46 . the matrices @xmath47 and @xmath48 are given by the ando model@xcite , which is the discrete version for the rashba spin - orbit coupling@xcite , as @xmath49 where @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) is the hopping matrix element , for events which conserve ( flip ) the spin .",
    "the overall hopping amplitude , @xmath52 , is taken as the energy unit of the problem .",
    "in other words , all energies are expressed in terms of @xmath53 .",
    "the strength of the so coupling can be expressed by the ratio between the absolute value of the spin - flip amplitude and that of the total hopping element . using a dimensionless parameter @xmath54",
    ", we examine the entire range of @xmath55 , between very weak ( @xmath56 ) and very strong ( @xmath57 ) spin - orbit coupling .",
    "realistic values for @xmath55 are between @xmath58 and @xmath59.@xcite as mentioned above , these values can be controlled by tuning the gate voltage@xcite .",
    "we now add a perpendicular magnetic field to our 2d sample , and we choose a gauge in which the vector potential is @xmath60 .",
    "the zeeman term in the hamiltonian is thus diagonal in spin space , and can be written as @xmath61 where @xmath62 .",
    "with the gauge chosen , one has to modify the hopping elements in the @xmath63 direction , according to the peierls substitution@xcite , and write @xmath64 . in this expression @xmath45",
    "is the row number and @xmath65 is a phase , that can be written as @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the lattice constant and @xmath68 is the magnetic flux quantum .",
    "thus , @xmath65 is a dimensionless parameter , that measures the magnetic flux throughout a lattice unit cell , in units of the quantum flux @xmath69 .",
    "the zeeman energy can be related to the hopping phase @xmath65 and to the hopping amplitude @xmath53 by the following considerations .",
    "one can express the absolute value of the zeeman energy as @xmath70 . substituting the physical constants @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is the electron mass , and using the relation @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is the effective mass at the bottom of the band",
    ", one gets @xmath75 .",
    "the factor @xmath76 depends on the specific type of the qd , and in general , @xmath77 for metallic grains while @xmath78 for semiconducting ones . in the current study",
    "we use 2d geometry which is suitable for modeling typical semiconducting qds .",
    "moreover , the ando model which incorporates the spin - orbit coupling was originally proposed for surfaces of iii - v compound semiconductors @xcite .",
    "thus we set for the rest of this paper @xmath79 , as in the case of gaas .",
    "however , we have checked that tuning this value does not lead to a qualitative change of the main results .",
    "finally , since all energies are measured in units of @xmath53 , the strength of the zeeman term @xmath80 determines exactly the hopping phase .    at last , the interactions term in the hamiltonian",
    "is @xmath81 which represents a hubbard interaction with strength @xmath82 .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath83 is exactly diagonalized using the lanczos procedure , for lattices of up to @xmath84 sites , occupied by @xmath85 or @xmath32 electrons , and its lowest eigenstates are numerically found . in order to calculate the spin polarization of the qd we apply a weak magnetic field along the @xmath86 axis and calculate the expectation value of @xmath87 for the lowest levels . for the g - factor calculations",
    ", we compare the ground - state energies with and without the magnetic field for each sample , and use eq .",
    "( [ eqn : g_gdef2 ] ) .",
    "the strength of the magnetic field we apply is @xmath88 , and for an experimental system in which the mean level spacing is @xmath89 , it is equivalent to a magnetic field of @xmath90 , in correspondence with realistic measurements .",
    "we start with non - interacting particles , by taking @xmath91 . without the magnetic field , all single - particle states ( and in particular the ground - state )",
    "are doubly - degenerate ( the kramers degeneracy ) @xcite .",
    "when a magnetic field is applied , it splits this degeneracy , and one gets to zeroth order in the magnetic field , @xmath92 , where @xmath93 denotes the expectation value of the operator @xmath87 in the @xmath45-th eigenfunction ( @xmath94 being the ground - state ) . for @xmath56 , @xmath95 . when the so coupling increases , a general decrease of @xmath96 can be expected , and this trend can be seen in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : sz_n1 ] .",
    "1truecm    however , one can see that the value of @xmath97 switches abruptly between these two levels near @xmath98 .",
    "this is a sign of a level crossing ( lc ) , which can be seen by looking at the energy difference between these levels ( lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : sz_n1 ] ) .",
    "the switching of @xmath97 occurs exactly when the energy difference vanishes .",
    "we note that such crossings occur also for large values of @xmath55 .",
    "it is important to notice that the lc presented here occurs between states which belong to the same kramers pair ( i.e. , states which are the time reversal of each other ) .",
    "the energy difference between states of different pairs is much larger , and although it is reduced by the so coupling , yet it is usually much larger than the contribution of the weak magnetic field we apply to the energy ( see the dashed line in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : sz_n1 ] ) . as a result ,",
    "crossings between states which originate from different pairs are much less probable .    in the next section we study the case of doubly - occupied systems . for non - interacting electrons ,",
    "based on the results of the current section , it is clear that a lc between the lowest two doubly - occupied states is improbable , since their slater determinants contain single - particle states from different kramers pairs .",
    "nevertheless , as will be shown in the next section , the electron - electron interaction can change this picture qualitatively .",
    "we now turn to study the effect of interactions on the behavior of the g - factor in the presence of so . calculating the ground - state energies of the two lowest doubly - occupied many - body states",
    ", one finds that there is a lc between these states , at a certain value of the so coupling ( denoted in the following by @xmath99 ) , as can be seen in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : de_s2_n2 ] . in the vicinity of @xmath99 , the expectation value of @xmath100 switches smoothly between these states , as is shown in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : de_s2_n2 ] .",
    "1truecm    as noted in the previous section , such a lc does not exist for non - interacting two - electron states since it involves levels belonging to different single - particle kramers pairs .",
    "moreover , in the cases when there is a lc in the non - interacting system , i.e. , between single - particle levels belonging to the same kramers pair , the g - factor vanishes at the lc point ( to zeroth order of @xmath5 ; it has however a linear magnetic field dependence from orbital effects ) . on the other hand , in the case of interacting electrons we find that both states involved in the lc have a significant magnetization of zeroth order in @xmath5 .",
    "the magnetization properties , i.e. , @xmath101 and the g - factor , do not present a smooth switching as for @xmath102 in the vicinity of the lc . instead , when the energies of the two states become close enough to each other so that the energy associated with the magnetic field becomes important , both states develop a spin polarization as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : sz_n2_i ] .",
    "this leads to an enhancement of @xmath101 in the crossing region , and to significant values of the g - factor .",
    "1truecm    the significant values obtained for the g - factor are crucially related to the degeneracy point ( the lc ) . far from this point ,",
    "when the two lowest many - particle states are not degenerate , each of these states @xmath103 and @xmath104 is the time reversal of itself , i.e. , @xmath105 and @xmath106 , where @xmath107 is the time reversal operator .",
    "this immediately implies @xmath108 for both states , and the corresponding g - factors vanish as well .",
    "this picture changes in the vicinity of the degeneracy point , where the magnetic field breaks the degeneracy by polarizing both states .",
    "this of course results in a finite value of the g - factor .",
    "such non - vanishing g - factor values can thus be seen as long as the energy associated with the magnetic field is larger than the level separation . accordingly , as the magnetic field is enhanced , the peaks in @xmath101 and @xmath10 get wider .",
    "the dependence of the energy on the magnetic field is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : e_h_n2_i ] , with a comparison between the lc regime to an arbitrary point . in the latter , a quadratic dependence of the ground - state energy on the magnetic field",
    "is clearly seen . on the other hand , near the lc point",
    "each of these states has a significant magnetization , and the dependence of the energy on the magnetic field is linear , with a finite value of the g - factor .",
    "these phenomena can be given a simple interpretation .",
    "kinetic energy considerations make it advantageous to put the two electrons in the same orbital level , and create an unpolarized ground state .",
    "repulsive interactions , however , cause a polarized ground state to be preferred , since the pauli principle then tends to separate the electrons .",
    "usually , the kinetic energy wins .",
    "however , so coupling tends to reduce the single - particle level spacing so at some point the interactions win , and a stoner - like instability emerges@xcite . in order to support this intuitive picture ,",
    "we have calculated the energy difference between the two lowest many - body levels using first order perturbation theory in the interaction strength . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : de_dpt ] , the interaction tends to decrease the energy difference between the lowest two many - body levels .",
    "when the electrons are non - interacting , the levels approach each other with increasing so coupling , yet the minimal distance between them is much larger than the magnetic energy .",
    "the presence of interactions enhances this tendency , towards the situation in which a lc is possible .",
    "1truecm    from these results one can conclude that whereas the g - factor of a doubly - occupied system can be neglected for most values of @xmath55 , it nevertheless has a significant value near @xmath99 . as is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : de_dpt ] , when the system size increases the instability and the g - factor peak occurs for smaller values of the so coupling . in the next section",
    "we argue that such g - factor values might be significant even for realistic sample sizes and physical parameters , and thus they should not be neglected when analyzing experimental data .",
    "in order to check whether the g - factor peak presented in the previous section occurs for realistic systems , one must study how the system size modifies this behavior . when the system is enlarged , one must be careful to leave the other physical parameters unchanged .",
    "the strength of the interactions is usually described by the parameter @xmath109 , which is defined through the ratio between the potential and the kinetic energies .",
    "the kinetic energy per electron in 2d samples goes like the electron density @xmath110 . for coulomb interactions one has @xmath111 per electron , where @xmath112 is the coulomb interaction strength between sites separated by one lattice constant . since @xmath113 one gets @xmath114 and thus @xmath115 .",
    "however , for hubbard interactions @xmath116 , so that @xmath117 .",
    "therefore , in order to keep @xmath109 constant , the value of @xmath82 should stay unchanged when the system size increases .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : g_so_ucnn ] we show the dependence of the g - factor on @xmath55 , for various system sizes , ranging from @xmath118 to @xmath84 .",
    "as can be seen , the enhancement of the g - factor occurs for all of the curves , with some quantitative changes in the position and the height of the peak .",
    "although a substantial enlargement of the system is not numerically possible because of the limitations of the exact diagonalization technique , yet the trend is clearly seen .",
    "the value of @xmath99 which is found to decrease with increasing system size ( see the inset of fig .  [",
    "fig : g_so_ucnn ] ) suggests that for a sufficiently large system size the crossing occurs for a moderate value of the so coupling , which may be experimentally relevant .",
    "in addition , the modest increase of the peak height suggests that a significant peak may be observed for realistic system sizes .",
    "finally , we would like to discuss the implications of the g - factor peak on g - factor measurements .",
    "once a finite magnetization of the doubly occupied ground state is possible , it can affect experiments done by , e.g. , tunneling spectroscopy .",
    "such a measurement presents the result for the difference between two g - factors , as given by eq .",
    "( [ eqn : g_gdef_tot ] ) .",
    "if the even - electron state has a non - vanishing g - factor , like in the vicinity of the lcs we have presented , the measured quantity @xmath27 may not be equal to the g - factor of the state with an odd number of electrons , to which it is usually attributed .",
    "in such cases , a signature of the lc may be seen experimentally . in the regular case ( as opposed to the lc scenario ) , the two levels which belong to the same kramers doublet have the same g - factor up to a sign , and the dependence of the two energies on the magnetic field is symmetric .",
    "however , in the region of a lc , the two levels receive contributions from different even - particle states .",
    "explicitly , with a magnetic field , the @xmath18-th kramers pair is split to levels with different g - factors , @xmath119 and @xmath120 .",
    "thus , if @xmath121 or @xmath122 ( or both ) are not negligible , the magnetic field dependence will not be symmetric .",
    "furthermore , since the strength of the spin - orbit coupling can be tuned by using a gate - voltage@xcite , different shapes of the magnetic - field dependence may be obtained for a specific sample with different values of the gate - voltage .",
    "an example is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : e0_conc ] .",
    "as one can see , the clearest non - symmetric behavior is obtained for @xmath123 ( right panel ) , but such a dependence can be seen for a region in its vicinity as well ( middle panel ) . far enough from this region",
    "( left panel ) the symmetric dependence reappears .",
    "we have also tried to verify that the reported phenomenon occurs for states with even electron numbers larger than @xmath32 as well .",
    "however , the treatment of such cases is more difficult since the size of the hilbert space , @xmath124 , quickly passes the computational limit when @xmath20 increases .",
    "therefore , the numerical simulation is limited to much smaller lattices , and although they show features similar to lc and enhanced g - factors reported for the two electron ground state , the question whether a lc occurs for larger lattices as well needs further investigation . as a possible method for that calculation we suggest the particle - hole version of the density matrix renormalization group algorithm@xcite , which is suitable for such finite fermi systems@xcite .",
    "in addition , since as mentioned above the interplay between interactions and disorder can also result in a non - trivial spin polarization , the combination of both disorder and so coupling with interactions can enhance this finding .",
    "these two points deserve a separate investigation .    to conclude",
    ", we have shown that the combination of interactions and spin - orbit scattering can lead to a magnetization of states having an even number of electrons .",
    "this effect was explained using first order perturbation theory by the tendency of interactions to drive a stoner instability , which is enhanced by the so coupling . by studying the behavior when the system size increases",
    ", it seems that such a result may be experimentally observed even for realistic sizes of qds",
    ". therefore it might be relevant for understanding g - factor measurements . based on our explanation of the results",
    ", we believe that similar phenomena might be observed in metallic nano - particles as well .",
    "however , a numerical investigation for 3d systems is quite difficult ."
