    "the quantum numbers have fixed average values which are determined by the corresponding chemical potentials , on the other hand , in the canonical ensemble , quantum numbers have fixed values .",

    "it is thus clear that the equivalence of both descriptions in the thermodynamic limit can be strictly established only for intensive observables  @xcite .",
    "the equivalence of the gc and c descriptions in the thermodynamic limit has been established at the most basic , probability density level .",
    "it has been shown recently @xcite that different particle probability densities calculated from the c and gc ensembles coincide in the thermodynamic limit .    in some physical situations , however , the knowledge of t - limits of probability density functions is not sufficient .",
    "there is a broad class of physical quantities which are finite in the thermodynamic limit but are still different for different statistical ensembles .",
    "we call henceforth such variables _ semi  intensive quantities_. these variables have finite t - limits , like intensive variables , but those limits are governed by finite volume corrections to probability distributions for particle densities . the properties of semi  intensive quantities in the t - limit are entirely determined by the @xmath6 , subleading corrections to the probability density functions .",
