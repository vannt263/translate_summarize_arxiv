    "further generalizations were investigated by ouisloumen and sanchez @xcite and rothenstein and dagan @xcite .    a general quantum formalism due primarily to van hove @xcite expresses the ddcs of potential scattering by a bound nucleus as a fourier transform of a 2-point correlation function .",

    "the resonant ddcs becomes a fourier double - laplace transform of a 4-point correlation function .    in the case of a harmonic crystal ,",
    "the numerical computation of the multifold integral is difficult because of the highly oscillating behavior of the 4-point correlation function .",
    "a simplified multiphonon model , known as the `` uncoupled phonon approximation '' ( upa ) was proposed by naberejnev @xcite .",
    "however , the validity of this approximation is questioned especially within the short time range ( case of high temperature for instance ) .",
    "the present work suggests a new approximation that gives a correct limit at short time and provides a simple formula to compute the scattering kernel .",
    "when the scattering amplitude is independent of incident neutron energy , it is known since the work of van hove @xcite that the scattering ddcs is related to the fourier transform of a two point correlation function @xmath2 :    @xmath3    @xmath4 is the energy transfer with @xmath5 and @xmath6 the energy of the neutron before and after the scattering event .",

    "the scattering cross section includes the resonant , the potential - resonant interference and potential terms .",

    "this is the same effective temperature as lamb @xcite derived for the doppler broadening of a capture resonance in a solid in the weak binding limit .",

    "the upa model separates the phonon dynamic and the nuclear interaction and provides a rather simple way to compute ddcs .",
    "however , within the upa approximation , the 4-point correlation for small @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 becomes    @xmath55   - \\frac{kt_{eff}}{2 m } [ \\vec k_i \\vec k_f ( t^2 + t'^2 ) + \\tau^2 ( \\vec k_f - \\vec k_i ) ^2 ] \\},\\ ] ]    which differs markedly from the required equation [ eqfgm ] discussed in the previous section .",
