    "the inflationary scenario explains several cosmological problems such as the spatial flatness and homogeneity of the universe , and it predicts an almost scale - invariant power spectrum of the primordial density perturbation , which agrees with most of the wmap observation on cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropy . on the other hand , there remains some discrepancies between the standard cosmological model predictions and the wmap observations on large angular scales .",
    "one of them is the suppression of the @xmath0 quadruple mode of the cmb temperature power spectrum ( c.f . for example @xcite ) .",
    "there have been different approaches to solve this problem . in refs @xcite",
    ", it is considered that the slow - roll inflation was preceded by a fast - roll stage where the kinetic energy of the scalar field was dominant , which leads to a suppression of the quadrupole moment .",
    "such a fast - roll stage can be reached by tuning the initial condition of the inflation , for example . another way to reach an early stage of kinetic energy dominance",
    "was considered in refs .",
    "@xcite through bounces or cyclic universes where just before the bounce or the new cycle the kinetic energy density of the field dominates over its potential .",
    "other authors have considered different pre - inflationary phases of the universe to suppress the primordial power spectrum at large scales .",
    "for example in refs .",
    "@xcite , a radiation - dominated pre - inflationary era was considered and in @xcite , a pre - inflation matter era provided by primordial micro black hole remnants was introduced .    the cmb quadruple anomaly affects the lowest modes of the primordial power spectrum ; i.e.   modes with comoving wave numbers of the order of @xmath1 .",
    "therefore , these are the first modes to exit the horizon and the last ones to reenter . consequently we expect that these modes are heavily affected by the physics of the very early universe , possibly the physics prior to the slow - roll inflationary era . based on this reasoning",
    ", we propose a new cosmological period just before the slow - roll inflationary era .",
    "this period corresponds to an era described by a network of topological defects , which we will assume to be frustrated domain walls or cosmic strings @xcite , for the sake of simplicity .",
    "we expect that the production of topological defects at those scales follows the prediction of high energy physics .",
    "in addition , given that the topological defects era proceeds the slow - roll inflationary era , the topological networks will affect mainly the lower modes of the power spectrum of the scalar and tensorial perturbations .",
    "afterwards , they will soon be diluted during most of the inflationary era .",
    "there is a simple way to model the ideas previously mentioned .",
    "we consider the matter content of the early universe to be described by a kind of generalized chaplygin gas ( gcg ) @xcite , which offers a smooth transition between different eras :    * a period dominated by a network of frustrated domain walls ( nfdw ) at earlier time and a de sitter - like phase at later time .",
    "* a period dominated by a network of frustrated cosmic strings ( nfcs ) at earlier time and a de sitter - like phase at later time .",
    "the idea of an early chaplygin gas phase in the universe was first suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see also @xcite ) and later extended in refs .",
    "the energy density of a network of frustrated topological defects ( nftd ) can be described in a compact way , for example , as @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the scale factor , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are constants related to the energy scale of the nftd and the de sitter - like inflationary era , respectively , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are constants such that @xmath8 for the network of domain walls and cosmic strings , respectively .",
    "we assume that @xmath9 is positive such that the inflationary era is preceded by a topological dominance phase .",
    "let us be reminded in this regard that the energy density of nfdw and nfcs scales as @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively @xcite .",
    "it is worthy to stress that the nftd epoch preceding the slow - roll inflationary can in principle produce inflation as well ; indeed this is the case for nfdw , but this inflation is much slower , i.e.  much _ lazier _ than the slow - roll inflation .",
    "moreover , for a nfcs dominated period the universe is increasing its size at a constant speed ; i.e.  with no acceleration or deceleration . from now on whenever we refer to a pre - inflationary era , we will be referring to a pre - slow - roll inflationary era .",

    "we model this idea using the framework of matter @xmath12 la chaplygin gas during the early universe as a way of interpolating between a nftd and a slow - roll inflationary period .",
