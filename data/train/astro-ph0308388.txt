    "this paper presents the results of an interferometric survey in @xmath0co  ( @xmath1 )   of the entire  disk of m33 .",
    "observations were made with the berkeley - illinois - maryland association array .",
    "the proximity and low inclination of m33 , an sa(s)cd spiral in the local group , permits direct and detailed comparisons of molecular , atomic , and ionized hydrogen gas on the scale of individual gmcs .",
    "the angular resolution of the bima survey is @xmath2 , which corresponds to a linear resolution of 50 pc at the distance of m33 ( 0.85 mpc , * ? ? ?",
    "this resolution is adequate to separate , but not to resolve , individual giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) if they are similar in size to those in the milky way @xcite . a follow - up paper by ( * ?",
    "* paper ii ) describes a study of rotation properties , virial masses , and morphology of 36 gmcs from this survey which were reobserved at bima with 20 pc linear resolution .",
    "the bima array is well - suited for this extensive mapping project for three reasons .",
    "( 1 ) the 6-meter diameter antennas have a large ( @xmath10 fwhm ) field of view at 115 ghz ; this keeps the number of pointing centers to a manageable level .",
    "( 2 ) with 10 telescopes , the array affords good snapshot imaging capability ; visiting each field only a few times per night yields a clean synthesized beam .",
    "( 3 ) the sis receivers @xcite have excellent sensitivity ; double sideband receiver temperatures at 115 ghz are typically 40 k.    of the numerous mechanisms proposed for molecular cloud formation @xcite , it is uncertain which , if any , is responsible for most gmcs in spiral galaxies . validating any cloud formation model requires an unbiased survey of molecular clouds in a galaxy .",
    "prior to the present study of m33 , there existed no complete catalog of giant molecular clouds in an external spiral galaxy .",
    "even cloud _ catalogs _ in the milky way are incomplete because velocity blending along the line - of - sight can prevent unambiguous separation into individual clouds ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . only in the large magellenic cloud , a local group irregular ,",
    "has co been surveyed with sufficient resolution to measure accurately the gmc mass spectrum @xcite .",
    "a decade ago , @xcite undertook a pioneering survey of extragalactic gmcs in the nuclear region of m33 . with the owens valley interferometer they mapped @xmath0co  ( @xmath1 )   in 19 fields with a @xmath11 field - of - view and a @xmath12 synthesized beam .",
    "their data analysis yielded a catalog of 38 gmcs with @xmath13 and a mass distribution index similar to that of the milky way .",
    "although their observations covered a significant fraction of the central 2 kpc , they positioned most fields to include areas of high optical extinction detected in co emission with the nrao 12 m telescope , possibly biasing the cloud sample .",
    "this paper attempts to address this bias by presenting a complete survey of gmcs in m33 over most of the optical disk .",
    "observations were made with the bima array in its most compact ( `` d '' ) configuration at various times between 1999 august and 2000 october . as shown in figure  [ fig : pcenters ] ,",
    "m33 was mosaiced using a grid of 759 pointing centers , spaced by @xmath14 in a hexagonal pattern .",
    "circles indicate the fwhm primary beamwidth of the bima antennas , which is @xmath10 at 115.27  ghz . the grid spacing was chosen to cover the galaxy with as few pointing centers as possible while maintaining a point source sensitivity that varies by no more than 10% across the mosaic .",
    "the co(@xmath15 ) line was observed in the upper sideband of the sis mixers .",
    "single sideband system temperatures , scaled to the top of the atmosphere , were typically 300 to 500  k at 115.27  ghz . the correlator covered the lsr velocity range @xmath16 to @xmath17 km  s@xmath18  with 1.015  km  s@xmath18channel spacing , on each of the 45 baselines .    each night",
    "we cycled through observations of about 50 grid points , using an integration time of 25 seconds per point .",
    "the slew and settle time of the telescope between integrations was 5 seconds , so a complete loop through 50 grid points required about 25 minutes .",
    "observations of the calibrator , 0136@xmath19478 , were interleaved with complete loops . for a typical 6-hour track , each pointing center",
    "was observed 1012 times . with 45 baselines , this yields about 500 measurements of the source visibility across the @xmath20 plane , resulting in a nearly round synthesized beam with @xmath21% sidelobes .",
    "a total of 45 observing tracks was obtained , with durations of a few hours to 10 hours .",
    "the total useful integration time accumulated on m33 was 132 hours , which corresponds to an average of 10.5 minutes per pointing center .",
    "for each observing track the amplitude gain of each antenna was scaled by a constant factor to obtain the correct visibility amplitude on the calibrator , 0136@xmath19478 .",
    "the flux density of this quasar was variable over the course of the observations ( 2.3  jy in 1999 september , 3.0  jy in 2000 may , 3.7  jy in 2000 july , and 3.4  jy in 2000 oct ) .",
    "we monitored the calibrator flux density by making a brief observation of the compact region w3oh once per night .",
    "the flux density of w3oh was measured to be @xmath22 jy by comparison with primary flux calibrators mars and uranus . all comparisons with w3oh",
    "were made using the lower sideband continuum channel of the receivers at 112  ghz , since measurements at 115 ghz are contaminated by co emission from the extended molecular cloud associated with w3oh .",
    "the flux densities derived for 0136@xmath19478 were generally reproducible to @xmath23  jy from night to night . allowing for possible systematic pointing errors and decorrelation by atmospheric phase fluctuations",
    ", we estimate that the final amplitude scale is uncertain by approximately @xmath24% .",
    "after calibrating the visibility data , we generated mosaiced spectral line maps using the miriad software package .",
    "the maps were deconvolved with a clean algorithm in order to remove negative bowls around the strongest sources . the synthesized beam varies slightly across the mosaic because individual subgrids have slightly different @xmath20 coverage . to handle this",
    ", miriad creates a cube of synthesized beams , one for each pointing center , and interpolates among them when deconvolving the map .",
    "the maps were restored with a @xmath2 gaussian .",
    "most of our analysis was performed on maps with @xmath25  km  s@xmath18  velocity resolution .",
    "these were produced by hanning smoothing the ( 1.015  km  s@xmath18spacing ) visibility spectra , then generating maps of alternate channels .",
    "the resulting channel maps are expected to be nearly statistically independent .    to evaluate the noise level across the mosaic , we computed the rms fluctuations in the spectrum corresponding to each map pixel , omitting any channels with flux densities @xmath26 . from a spectrum with 222 statistically independent channels ,",
    "the noise is determined to approximately 5% accuracy .",
    "we then smoothed the map of the noise to @xmath27 resolution ( figure  [ fig : rmsmap ] ) .",
    "the white 99% gain contour denotes the effective outer boundary of the mosaic .",
    "outside this contour intensities are not fully corrected for attenuation by the primary beam .",
    "for these 2 km  s@xmath18  resolution channel maps the rms noise level over the central half of the mosaic ranges from 0.34  jy beam@xmath18 to 0.51  jy beam@xmath18 ; the average value is 0.44  jy beam@xmath18 , or 0.24  k. at the worst spots near the edge of the mapped region ( but inside the 99% gain contour ) the noise level is sometimes as high as 0.65  jy beam@xmath18 .",
    "because the sensitivity varies across the mosaic , we searched for molecular clouds by clipping the maps at a constant signal - to - noise ratio instead of a constant flux density threshold .",
    "the intensity data cube is converted to a signal - to - noise data cube by dividing through by the noise at each position : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the smoothed rms noise map ( figure  [ fig : rmsmap ] ) and @xmath30 is a frequency - dependent noise correction ( figure  [ fig : rmsvel ] ) which arises because of gain variations of @xmath31 across the instrumental passband .",
    "real co emission occupies only a few of the @xmath32 independent resolution elements in each channel map , thus having little effect on the renormalization . in the normalized , or signal - to - noise , data cube",
    "the intensity is expressed as a multiple of the rms noise at each pixel .",
    "for example , @xmath33 represents a @xmath34 detection of a negative peak .",
    "the maximum and minimum normalized fluxes in each velocity channel are plotted in figure  [ fig:4kmstat ] .",
    "co emission is obvious in the range @xmath35 km  s@xmath18 .",
    "a histogram of the normalized fluxes in this velocity range ( figure  [ fig : gstat2 ] ) is well - fitted by a normal distribution , apart from the wing of high signal - to - noise pixels attributable to co detections .",
    "clearly , one could comfortably accept as a co detection any pixel with normalized flux @xmath36 .",
    "unfortunately , such a simple strategy would miss much real molecular emission ",
    "figure  [ fig : gstat2 ] shows a clear excess in pixels with flux @xmath37 . since the velocity maps are nearly statistically independent , we can obtain a higher detection efficiency by searching for neighboring channels with unusually high normalized fluxes . the lowest mass molecular cloud which our survey is likely to detect",
    "is of order @xmath38 .",
    "a typical milky way gmc with this mass has a velocity dispersion of 1.8 km  s@xmath18  @xcite , which corresponds to a fwhm linewidth of 4.2 km  s@xmath18 .",
    "therefore , we expect that co emission from most real clouds should appear in at least two adjacent 2 km  s@xmath18velocity channels . to identify molecular cloud candidates",
    ", we wrote an idl routine to locate pairs of adjacent channels with normalized flux @xmath39 .",
    "each pair , and all contiguous pixels with normalized flux @xmath40 , are assigned to a candidate molecular cloud .",
    "these pixels are then masked to avoid double counting , and a search for another candidate cloud proceeds until all pairs of adjacent @xmath39 channels have been masked .",
    "the assignment of pixels to candidate clouds in this manner does not depend on search order but occasionally links nearby sources which could be regarded as separate clouds .",
    "although we expect from our map statistics to find real co emission only in the velocity range @xmath41 km  s@xmath18 , the search was conducted over the full 450 km  s@xmath18  range of the data cube .",
    "a total of 1600 candidate sources were identified in this way .",
    "to evaluate the likelihood that each candidate source is real , we examine the most significant spectrum through the cloud  either the one with the highest summed significance or the one with the greatest number of adjacent channels with flux @xmath40 .",
    "the calculation described in appendix  a evaluates the probability @xmath42 that this spectrum is a noise fluctuation , _ i.e. _ that the detection is spurious .",
    "as discussed in appendix  a , the likelihood that the cloud is real is then given by @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the number of statistically independent ways in which @xmath45 adjacent channels can be selected from the data cube .",
    "for the full data cube @xmath46 . note that the likelihood computation is based on a single spectrum through each cloud , not on an average over the source .",
    "this keeps the calculation simple , since adjacent spatial pixels oversample the synthesized beam and hence are not statistically independent .",
    "originally , we intended to catalog all candidate sources with @xmath47 likelihoods of being noise fluctuations . to our disappointment",
    ", however , the algorithm identified several sources which were almost certainly spurious ",
    "i.e. , well outside the plausible range for co emission  with false detection likelihoods of @xmath48",
    ". there are several possible explanations for this inconsistency .",
    "first , there may be outliers caused by a few bad visibility measurements , perhaps from observations obtained in especially poor weather or at low elevation .",
    "second , we may be underestimating the number @xmath44 of statistically independent resolution elements in the data cube .",
    "nyquist sampling the highest spatial frequency visibility data ( corresponding to antenna separations of 11.5 k@xmath49 ) requires a @xmath50 interval , which would imply there are @xmath51 independent resolution elements in the map .",
    "we believe the actual number is close to our original estimate of 20500 because the long baseline data receive little weight in the final image .",
    "third , there may be errors in normalizing the maps by the rms noise .",
    "such errors are particularly likely for the frequency dependent correction ( figure [ fig : rmsvel ] ) because there were slow changes in the passband gain over the 14 month period in which observations were made .",
    "because the likelihood calculation is imperfect , we use it only to rank the _ relative _ likelihoods of the candidate sources . for convenience",
    "we define a ` likelihood measure ' as @xmath52 .",
    "figure  [ fig : prob_vel ] plots this quantity vs. lsr velocity for the 1600 candidate sources .",
    "sources with the 60 highest likelihood measures ( @xmath53 ) fall in the velocity range @xmath54 km  s@xmath18and are apparent in multiple channel maps , i.e. they are unquestionably real . as the likelihood threshold",
    "is lowered , we begin to find a few sources that probably are spurious , since they lie well outside this velocity range . at @xmath55",
    "the number of obviously spurious sources rises sharply , indicating the noise floor of the data cube .    for our primary gmc catalog",
    ", we accept all cloud candidates in the velocity interval @xmath56 km  s@xmath18  for which @xmath57 .",
    "a total of 93 sources fit these criteria .",
    "it is straightforward to estimate the number of false detections in this catalog simply by counting the number of sources above the likelihood cutoff which lie outside the 96-channel search range .",
    "there are 3 spurious detections in the 48 channels just below the search range , and 3 spurious detections in the 48 channels just above the search range .",
    "hence , we expect that there are of order 6 spurious detections in this catalog .",
    "one can identify fainter sources by narrowing the search range to cover only velocities that lie within the emission line profile in each direction .",
    "figure  [ fig : prob_widths ] shows the cloud likelihoods from figure  [ fig : prob_vel ] plotted as a function of the co velocity difference .",
    "velocities were obtained from the westerbork map of @xcite , which has @xmath58 resolution .",
    "for the 93 clouds in the primary catalog , the velocity difference exceeds @xmath59 for only 5 sources , where @xmath59 is the velocity dispersion of the  line .",
    "the four sources with velocity differences @xmath60 may be false detections .",
    "narrowing the search range to @xmath61 km  s@xmath18  from the  velocity , we identified 55 additional clouds with likelihood measure @xmath62 .",
    "figure  [ fig : vsel ] shows these sources on a likelihood  velocity difference plot .",
    "once again , by counting the number of ( presumably ) spurious sources outside the velocity search range , we estimate that there are of order 9 false detections in this catalog extension .",
    "it is not useful to catalog individual clouds with likelihoods @xmath63 because the number of spurious sources is quite large .",
    "nevertheless , in figure  [ fig : vsel ] there is an obvious overdensity of gmc candidates with @xmath64  within @xmath65 of @xmath66 , and this may be used to gauge the number of cloud candidates which are falsely rejected .",
    "there are 145 candidate sources with @xmath67 which are presumably spurious .",
    "one expects to find an equal number of spurious sources in the range @xmath68 .",
    "since there are actually 205 candidate sources in this range , we estimate that roughly 60 clouds have been falsely rejected from our gmc catalog in this significance range .",
    "this result is not particularly sensitive to how we select boundaries for the overdensity band in figure  [ fig : vsel ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : cloudspectra ] shows the most significant co spectrum through each cloud , overplotted on the  spectrum in the same direction .",
    "table [ cloudprop ] lists the positions and properties of the 148 clouds identified in our survey , ranked by likelihood .",
    "sources 193 were chosen without regard to the co  velocity difference , and hence are suitable for statistical tests against the distribution .",
    "c     + table omitted for brevity .",
    "the table is available at + ` http://astro.berkeley.edu/~eros/m33.table.txt ` +    the position and velocity of each cloud listed in table [ cloudprop ] are intensity - weighted averages over all pixels which constitute the cloud _",
    "i.e. , _ @xmath69 .",
    "the velocity width is derived from the intensity - weighted second moment of the velocity distribution , @xmath70^{0.5}.\\ ] ] to estimate the cloud s mass , we convert the co integrated intensity for each pixel to an h@xmath71 column density @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is the channel velocity width , 2.032 km  s@xmath18 , and where we assume a conversion factor @xmath74 @xcite .",
    "the higher resolution observations presented in paper ii imply that this conversion factor is consistent with the virial masses of clouds out to radii of 4.5 kpc , despite variations in metallicity .",
    "each pixel corresponds to a physical area @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is the distance to m33 , 850 kpc ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , and @xmath77 and @xmath78 are the extent of the pixel in angle , both of which are @xmath79 .",
    "thus , the total cloud mass is @xmath80 the factor 1.36 is the mass correction for helium with a number fraction of 9% relative to hydrogen nuclei .",
    "if expressed in terms of flux density rather than brightness temperature , this is equivalent to @xmath81 this is 25% lower than the conversion factor adopted by @xcite , mostly because of our choice of a lower @xmath82-factor .",
    "to gauge the completeness of the survey , we added a regular lattice of artificial test sources to the cube of channel maps and computed the fraction of them recovered by our search algorithm .",
    "each test source was a @xmath83 gaussian , corresponding to a gmc unresolved by our synthesized beam , with a gaussian velocity profile .",
    "the velocity width was kept constant at 6 km  s@xmath18  fwhm , independent of the flux density ( mass ) of the test source .",
    "artificial sources were spaced by @xmath10 in right ascension and declination , over the entire mosaic ; and by 56.3 km  s@xmath18  in velocity , from @xmath84 to @xmath85 km  s@xmath18 .",
    "sources close to the edge of the mosaic were omitted if more than 5% of their flux lay outside the mosaic s 99% gain contour . in total",
    ", 2625 artificial sources were added to the data cube .",
    "source recovery tests were done with masses ranging from @xmath86 to @xmath87 .",
    "figure  [ fig : num_recovered ] shows the fraction of the test sources detected as a function of the local rms noise level . over the full mosaic ,",
    "the survey is complete to @xmath88 . within the central half of the mosaic , where the noise is typically @xmath89 jy beam@xmath18",
    ", we recover approximately 90% of @xmath90 clouds . outside this region",
    ", we recover 70  80% of such clouds",
    ".    figure  [ fig : frac_recovered ] shows the recovered mass versus the actual mass of the test sources .",
    "our algorithm underestimates cloud masses because it integrates the co luminosity only over pixels inside the 2@xmath91 brightness contour .",
    "the underestimates are particularly severe for low mass clouds , for which much of the emission is beneath below the 2@xmath91 noise level . for clouds at the threshold of detectability , @xmath92",
    ", we recover about half the mass , whereas for clouds more massive than @xmath93 , we recover more than 80% . the average correction factors from figure  [ fig : frac_recovered ] were applied to our catalog sources to obtain more accurate mass estimates ; these are given as @xmath94 in column ( 8) of table 1 .",
    "the completeness estimates discussed above are applicable only to sources that are unresolved by the @xmath2 synthesized beam , i.e. to gmcs @xmath95 pc in diameter . because an aperture synthesis telescope acts as a spatial filter , attenuating low spatial frequencies ,",
    "the sensitivity to larger sources is reduced . essentially , the synthesized beam consists of a narrow positive lobe surrounded by a broad negative bowl .",
    "if one convolves an extended source brightness distribution with this beam , the negative contribution from the bowl partially cancels the positive contribution from the central lobe , reducing the observed flux density . for the bima d - array , the observed flux density for a @xmath96 fwhm gaussian source is about half the true flux density .",
    "thus , our survey may not detect a group of molecular clouds with a total mass of @xmath97 spread out over a @xmath96 ( 150 pc ) region , though it is quite likely to detect a single gmc with this mass . for sources with radii comparable to the beam size",
    ", their surface brightness will be diminished relative to that of a point source by a factor of @xmath98 .",
    "fortunately , sources of this size are also significantly more massive ( @xmath99 , paper ii ) than our completeness limit and would be readily detectable .",
    "single dish observations of m33 with the university of arizona steward observatory 12-m telescope were used to estimate the total fraction of the co flux recovered by the bima survey .",
    "the single dish flux calibrations were repeatable within 6% , and agreed with bima flux measurements of planetary and spectral line calibrators within 10% ; further observational details are given in paper ii .",
    "two sets of single dish observations were made .",
    "first , 18 positions with bima catalog sources were observed . for these fields",
    "the bima d - array maps recovered approximately 60% of the single dish co flux .",
    "co was detected in just 2 of the 18 _ off - source _ spectra obtained in these position - switched observations ; the 16 non - detections may be used to set an upper limit of 0.3 m@xmath100 pc@xmath101 for the surface density of an extended ( @xmath102 kpc ) uniform molecular disk .",
    "second , we observed 15 fields to map a @xmath103 cut along the major axis of m33 . in figure",
    "[ fig : censpec ] we show a composite single dish spectrum derived by shifting the spectrum for each of the 15 fields to a common velocity and averaging .",
    "the integrated flux of the of the 12 m spectrum is 1.2  k  km  s@xmath18 corresponding to @xmath1045.2 m@xmath100 pc@xmath101 .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath105 of molecular gas in the central @xmath106 diameter of the galaxy .",
    "@xcite measure @xmath107 in the same region when converted to our @xmath82-factor , distance , and removing their correction for source - beam coupling .    for comparison between the 12  m and the interferometer",
    ", we show composite spectra made from bima data within the 12  m fields , convolved to the @xmath108 fwhm 12  m beam , sampled at the centers of the 12  m beams , and averaged together in a fashion identical to the 12  m spectra .",
    "two bima spectra were synthesized , one from the catalog source pixels only ( thick line ) , another from the data cube clipped at 2@xmath91 ( dotted line ) .",
    "the bima catalog spectrum contains 43% of the single dish flux , the clipped spectrum , 54% . in paper",
    "ii we argue that most of the missing flux is attributable to complexes of undetected low mass clouds associated with catalog sources .",
    "we can estimate the total molecular mass of m33 from the major axis cut .",
    "the integrated single dish molecular mass in this @xmath103 long strip is @xmath109 .",
    "the corresponding bima mass , considering only cataloged clouds with masses greater than @xmath110 , the completeness limit for our survey , is @xmath111  m@xmath100 , 33% of the single dish mass . in this computation we have weighted the cloud masses by the appropriate 12-m beam attenuation factors .",
    "the total ( corrected ) mass in the catalog is @xmath112 , of which 1.5@xmath113 is from clouds more massive than the completeness limit .",

    "frequently , a bima cloud corresponds to two or more ws clouds  for example , the complex ws1-ws5 at the center of the galaxy is classified as one cloud in our survey because these sources are connected by low - level emission and lower bima resolution blends these clouds together .",
    "the bima survey detects all of the ws90 clouds with masses @xmath115 .    to examine a few of our clouds more closely , and to investigate discrepancies between our catalog and the ws90 catalog",
    ", we obtained higher resolution bima observations of the three fields shown by dashed circles in figure  [ fig : ws2 ] .",
    "these fields were observed on 3 nights in 2000 july with the array in its `` c '' configuration .",

    "figure  [ fig : wsmass2 ] compares the masses of gmcs which can be clearly identified in both data sets .",
    "as indicated by the dashed line , the bima masses are expected to be systematically lower by 25% because we used a lower conversion factor from flux density to mass .",
    "generally the bima and ws90 masses are in reasonable agreement , although there is a good deal of scatter in the ratio , probably because of the difficulty in establishing the outer boundaries of clouds .",
    "small clouds detected by the c - array observations are not included in our survey catalog ( table [ cloudprop ] ) but a further analysis of these clouds is included in paper ii .",
    "histograms of the mass distribution of gmcs in our catalog are presented on a log - log scale in figure  [ fig : uspec ] .",
    "the dashed line histogram is the observed spectrum of gmc masses uncorrected for signal beneath the @xmath117 clipping level , as described in  [ 2sigma ] .",
    "the solid line histogram is the spectrum of corrected masses .",
    "a power law of the form @xmath118 was fit to the mass bins for which the catalog is complete ( @xmath119 ) .",
    "the observed and corrected mass distributions are well fit with similar indices ( @xmath120 ) but different normalization constants ( @xmath121 vs. @xmath122 ) .    for a mass spectrum with @xmath123 , most of the integrated mass resides in the most massive clouds .",
    "for a mass spectrum with @xmath124 , most of the mass is in the least massive clouds , and the total mass diverges when extended to arbitrarily small mass .",
    "hence , for m33 there must be either a lower mass limit for molecular clouds or a break in the distribution where @xmath125 changes with decreasing cloud mass to less than 2 . if the integrated mass @xmath126 is distributed according to @xmath127\\ ] ] we compute a strict lower mass limit @xmath128 of @xmath129 for @xmath130 and @xmath131 .",
    "more likely , there is a `` turnover '' mass , where the mass spectrum becomes flatter than 2 . since we can put a firm lower limit on the cutoff mass of @xmath129 and an upper limit of @xmath132 , where the measured mass distribution is nearly complete ,",
    "the turnover mass of gmcs is @xmath133 with an uncertainty of @xmath134 .",

    "in addition , there is significantly more atomic gas ( @xmath104 a factor of 5 ) in the filaments than can be associated with discrete envelopes around gmcs and @xmath189 of this mass can be attributed to photodissociation @xcite .",
    "furthermore , if gmcs formed by the collisional agglomeration of smaller _ molecular _ clouds , the growth time would be comparable to the collision time .",
    "this is roughly equal to the collision time of the catalog clouds , which is @xmath190 years based on 140 gmcs inside a radius of 4 kpc , an h@xmath71 half thickness of 100 pc and a cloud - cloud velocity dispersion of 10 km  s@xmath18 .",
    "since the number density of clouds scales roughly as @xmath191 and the geometric cross section scales as @xmath192 ( owing to gmcs having a constant surface density , see paper ii ) , this collision time is independent of mass and characterizes the growth time for all self - gravitating clouds .",

    "forming a @xmath193 @xmath194 gmc from a diffuse molecular component at this surface density would require almost 10@xmath195 yr to accumulate material from a 300 pc radius region , provided that the gas velocity dispersion could be converted into ordered motion .",
    "both times are considerably longer than the lifetimes of the gmcs ( @xmath196 yr ) based on their association with the  filaments .",

    "we consider evidence of a physical connection between gmcs and the  shells .",
    "there is , in fact , a tendency for the catalog gmcs to be spatially clustered around the ddh holes .",

    "the large separation ( 150 pc ) between hole edges and gmcs suggests , however , that expanding shells do not _ directly _ trigger formation of the gmcs . figure  [ fig : donut ] plots the gmcs ( boundaries defined by the 2@xmath91 clipping levels ) and the 150 pc annuli ( shaded ) around the ( compact ) hole edges .",
    "this figure shows that there is no significant co emission inside the ddh holes .",
    "since essentially all gmcs are on filaments but not all gmcs are at the edges of holes , we conclude that the filamentary structure is more fundamental to gmc formation than the action of expanding shells .",
    "these shells may create filamentary structure on small scales , especially in the presence of turbulence ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "this appendix provides a brief description of the calculation used to rank the likelihood of candidate molecular clouds in the data cube .",
    "as discussed in the text , the flux density @xmath232 at each pixel in the data cube is first normalized by the rms noise @xmath91 , as a function of position and velocity , to produce a signal - to - noise , or significance , image @xmath233 : @xmath234    suppose that at some location in the data cube we have identified a spectral feature , occupying @xmath45 adjacent velocity channels , which we suspect may be co emission from a molecular cloud .",
    "what is the likelihood that this is a false detection ?",
    "assume that the signal - to - noise ratios of the @xmath45 channels have been sorted in ascending order such that @xmath235 .",
    "we wish to calculate the probability of randomly drawing @xmath45 values from a normalized gaussian distribution ( with zero mean and standard deviation 1 ) , such that all @xmath45 values are @xmath236 , at least @xmath237 values are @xmath238 ,  , and at least 1 value is @xmath239  that is , the probability of selecting @xmath45 values which are at least as unlikely as the actual spectrum .",
    "suppose that one draws a single value @xmath240 from the gaussian distribution .",
    "there are @xmath241 mutually exclusive outcomes :    @xmath242    where @xmath243    then , if one draws a total of @xmath45 values from the distribution , the probability that @xmath244 have values @xmath245 , @xmath246 have values in the interval @xmath247 ,  , and that @xmath248 have values @xmath249 , is given by the multinomial distribution : @xmath250 the probability of a false detection is the sum of all the multinomial terms which fulfill the original requirement , namely that @xmath251 , @xmath252 , @xmath253 , and so on : @xmath254    the m33 data cube contains approximately 20500 independent positions , each of which corresponds to a 220-channel spectrum . for an @xmath255-channel spectrum , there are @xmath256 ways of selecting @xmath45 adjacent channels .",
    "thus , over the 94 channel range covering the velocity interval @xmath257 @xmath64@xmath258 there are of order @xmath259 ways of selecting @xmath45 adjacent channels from the data cube .",
    "if @xmath260 and @xmath261 , the probability of @xmath262 false detections is given by poisson statistics : @xmath263",
    "the probability of any given detection being real is @xmath264 for @xmath265 .",
    "if there are a given number of detections at this significance level , the probability of @xmath266 of them being false is simply @xmath267 .    as an example , suppose we detect 3 adjacent channels with @xmath268 . in this case",
    "the probability of a false detection is simply the product of the probabilities of a false detection in each of the 3 channels : @xmath269 . using the poisson formula",
    ", one finds a 60% likelihood of _ all _ sources at this significance being real .",
    "if the signal - to - noise ratios of the 3 channels are unequal , then the probability of a false detection is greater than the simple product of the 3 probabilities , essentially because one has more than one chance to draw the less likely values from the population of gaussian deviates .",
    "for example , if @xmath270 , and @xmath271 , @xmath272 whereas the simple product of the probabilities is @xmath273 .",
    "again , poisson statistics calculates about a 60% likelihood that all sources at this level are real . because of the non - gaussian nature of the noise",
    ", we ultimately use this probability as a relative measure for ranking the significance of cloud candidates (  [ cloudfind ] ) .",
    "to understand in a statistical sense how massive star formation affects gmcs , it is a matter of interest to determine how many gmcs in our catalog are physically linked with  emitting regions .",
    "the filling factors @xmath274 for   and co in the survey region are 2.4% and 0.41% , respectively , where both types of emission show strong positional correspondence with  filaments .",
    "regions are so widespread that , to some degree , observed proximity to gmcs may be random . if regions and gmcs are all randomly distributed in a survey area @xmath275 , the average separation @xmath276 between a gmc and the nearest region obeys the relation @xmath277 where @xmath278 , the average area of an optical region , is @xmath279 .",
    "if we assume an region and gmc are closely associated if they are separated by no more than @xmath280 , say , then the expectation value for the number of close associations is @xmath281 assuming that @xmath282 has approximately the same area as a resolution element of our survey , @xmath283 , and @xmath284 pc  the average projected separation of an region lying at the edge of a gmc ",
    "then @xmath285 . a comparison of our gmc catalog to the region catalogs previously referenced yields 100 regions in close association with gmcs , about a factor of three in excess of what might be expected if gmc and positions were random"
