    "recently the role of spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) in solids has attracted tremendous attention . in many cases ,",
    "soc drastically changes the electronic band structure and results in a fundamentally different material property .",
    "a class of materials , called topological insulators , is an outstanding example @xcite .",
    "soc can also play together with on - site electronic correlation , @xmath5 , as often found in @xmath6 transition - metal oxides . in iridates , for example , the cooperation of soc and @xmath5 drives materials to be a novel ` @xmath7=1/2 mott insulator ' @xcite .",
    "due to the characteristic hopping integrals caused by @xmath7=1/2 nature ( instead of @xmath8=1/2 ) , some interesting new possibilities have been proposed and still under active investigations @xcite .",
    "the basically same features can also be found in the non - oxide @xmath9 and @xmath6 transition - metal compounds @xcite .",
    "the spin - orbit hamiltonian is represented by @xmath10 .",
    "while @xmath11 is known from the atomic nature of a given species , the direct estimation of @xmath10 is not always straightforward from experiment nor by theoretical calculation . for topological insulators , the observed band structure ( _ e.g. _ , by angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) )",
    "is regarded as a strong evidence of the characteristic band dispersion caused by soc @xcite . for iridates ,",
    "the data from resonant x - ray magnetic scattering ( rxms ) and/or resonant inelastic x - ray scattering ( rixs ) have been accepted as a confirmation of the novel soc physics because the interpretation of the data seems consistent only with theoretical models that take strong soc into account @xcite .",
    "however it is noted that sometimes a different interpretation can be made and then the conclusion might be changed ( for an example of iridates , see ref .",
    "further , from the theoretical point of view , it is unsatisfactory that there is no simple and well - defined way to directly calculate soc strength and to compare with experiments . in the standard first - principles calculations",
    ", @xmath11 can be calculated when the atomic wavefunctions are constructed by solving the relativistic dirac equation .",
    "@xmath0 , however , is not just determined by atomic nature but depends on the electronic structure of solids .    in this paper , we point out that the calculation of @xmath0 can be performed in a simple and straightforward way within the standard first - principles framework and be directly compared with experiment .",
    "one possible reason that the calculation of @xmath0 has not been often made from first - principles may be partly because of no direct reference data available from the experimental side .",
    "we note that the branching ratio , typically measured in x - ray absorption spectroscopy ( xas ) , can be used to estimate the strength of soc . instead of calculating xas spectrum itself ,",
    "a simple technique can be used to directly calculate branching ratio through @xmath0 .",
    "our formalism is implemented into our localized pseudo - atomic orbital ( pao ) basis code and applied to several different iridium oxide compounds . for a @xmath7=1/2 system , sr@xmath2iro@xmath3 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : fig1](a ) ) , we considered rh doping ( namely , sr@xmath2rh@xmath12ir@xmath13o@xmath3 ) and found that the calculated soc and branching ratio are in good agreement with xas data over the wide range of doping ratio @xmath14 .",
    "the iridate double perovskites ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : fig1](b ) ) , sr@xmath2@xmath15iro@xmath4 ( @xmath15 : mg , sc , ti ) , are also calculated and the results are in good agreement with recent experiments .",
    "we emphasize the formalism and implementation are simple enough to be adoptable for any type of first - principles code and method .",
    "this technique can be a useful tool for study large soc materials by providing a direct estimation of @xmath0 and branching ratio .",
    "iro@xmath3 and ( b ) double perovskite .",
    "the green , light blue , light brown , and red spheres represent sr , @xmath15 , ir and o , respectively ( @xmath15 = mg , sc , ti ) .",
    "the @xmath15o@xmath4 and iro@xmath4 cage is shaded in blue and brown , respectively .",
    "( c ) the expectation value of spin - orbit coupling calculated in the @xmath16 atomic limit as a function of @xmath17 .",
    "the blue ( @xmath18 ) and red ( @xmath19 ) line corresponds to the result obtained by using both @xmath20 and @xmath21 orbitals and only @xmath20 orbitals , respectively . ]",
    "for the electronic structure calculations , we used openmx software package @xcite which is based on the linear combination of numerical pao and norm - conserving pseudopotential @xcite .",
    "the cutoff radii for sr , ir , rh , mg , sc , ti , and o are 10.0 , 7.0 , 7.0 , 7.0 , 7.0 , 7.0 , and 5.0 a.u . respectively .",
    "the perdew - burke - ernzerhof ( pbe ) exchange - correlation functional @xcite and 300 ry energy cutoff . @xmath22 and",
    "@xmath23 k - meshes were taken for rh - doped sr@xmath2iro@xmath3 and double perovskites , respectively . have been used .",
    "the soc was treated within a fully relativistic @xmath24-dependent pseudopotential scheme in the non - collinear methodology @xcite .",
    "the on - site electronic correlations were taken into account within dft+@xmath5 formalism .",
    "the reasonable value of @xmath5 may be about 2.0  3.0 @xmath25 as noticed by the previous studies on sr@xmath2iro@xmath3 and ba@xmath2iro@xmath3 @xcite . throughout the manuscript",
    ", we present @xmath26 ev results as our main data both for rh - doped sr@xmath2iro@xmath3 and double perovskites . after scanning the region of @xmath27 2.0  3.0 ev",
    ", we found that any of our conclusion does not change by choosing different @xmath5 values .",
    "for rh - doped iridates , the lattice constant and internal coordinates are optimized with the force criteria of 0.01 ev /  . for double perovskites , we used the experimental lattice parameters @xcite of @xmath28 ( sr@xmath2mgiro@xmath4 ) , @xmath29 ( sr@xmath2sciro@xmath4 ) and @xmath30 ( sr@xmath2tiiro@xmath4 ) .      in this section",
    ", we present our formalism to calculate @xmath0 and branching ratio from first - principles .",
    "the localized atomic orbitals are assumed to be the basis set in the below .",
    "however , it is straightforward to extend our method to any other type .",
    "we used our pseudopotential - based dft ( density functional theory ) package , openmx @xcite , which takes the linear combination of numerical pao basis @xcite .",
    "the single particle energy eigenstate is decomposed into pao ; @xmath31 where @xmath32 is khon - sham eigenstate with momentum @xmath33 , @xmath34 the band index , and @xmath35 is pao with orbital index @xmath36 at position @xmath37 .",
    "with @xmath38 , @xmath39 state as a basis set for a given ir-@xmath6 orbitals , @xmath40 now the expectation value of @xmath41 is estimated within this basis as follow : @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the eigenvalue of the @xmath45 operator for @xmath46 and @xmath47 , respectively .",
    "note that it is crucial to use the @xmath48 state as a basis and the @xmath49 is not suitable although it is often adapted to describe the low energy electronic structure of iridates .",
    "[ fig : fig1](c ) shows the calculated @xmath50 as a function of crystal field splitting @xmath17 with the basis set of total angular momentum @xmath48 eigenstates ( blue ) and @xmath49 states ( red ) . for a reasonable value of @xmath51ev for the iridates @xcite ,",
    "the two lines differ significantly due to the coupling between @xmath20 and @xmath21 states .",
    "it is noted that , even in a large @xmath17 limit , @xmath52 and @xmath53 can noticeably differ from each other . here",
    "@xmath52 is the same quantity with @xmath50 in eq.([eq : ls_dft ] ) , and @xmath54 is obtained from only @xmath20 space taken into account .",
    "the ` line strength ' @xmath55 can be expressed as the expectation value of an operator @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the dipole operator with polarization @xmath58 , @xmath24 is the total angular momentum of the core hole , and @xmath11 denotes all quantum numbers other than @xmath24 .",
    "the sum is taken over the @xmath59 for the isotropic ` line strength ' considered .    branching ratio",
    "can also be estimated without calculating the full xas spectra .",
    "we first note that the relative intensity of @xmath60 and @xmath61 edge ` white lines ' can be related to the spin - orbit coupling via @xmath62 where @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and @xmath65 refers to the orbital angular momentum of valence electron , the orbital angular momentum of core hole , and the total angular momentum of the core hole , respectively @xcite .",
    "the number of holes in valence orbitals is denoted by @xmath66 . in our case , @xmath67 this relation is expected to be exact for the dipole transition in which the core - hole interaction with the valence electrons is small enough in comparison to the spin - orbit interaction of the core hole .",
    "therefore our case of iridates is suitable for this formalism to be applied . from eq.([eq : br_ls ] ) , the branching ratio can be written as @xmath68 with @xmath69 .",
    "therefore the branching ratio can be estimated by calculating the number of holes ( which is straightforward in the electronic structure calculation ) and @xmath70 ( which can also be estimated as described above ) .",
    "due to recent progress , calculating xas spectra from first - principles becomes feasible .",
    "some codes are already available for this capability @xcite .",
    "however the calculation of the whole spectra is quite demanding in general .",
    "for example , a certain type of pseudopotential ( such as projector augmented wave ) should be prepared for describing the core holes .",
    "also , the generalization to the non - collinear spin configuration space is sometimes not well prepared while the non - collinear spin order is actually stabilized in many of large soc materials as in the case of sr@xmath2iro@xmath3 .",
    "our technique has a clear advantage in these regards .",
    "first of all , it is much simpler in the implementation and calculation , and does not require any special type of pseudopotential .",
    "one can just use the original code as it is and the only required information is the final band structure that is properly transformed into @xmath48-space . in spite of its simplicity , the quantitative comparison can still be made with experiment through the branching ratio , and the direct estimation of soc is also provided although the full xas spectra is not accessible .",
    "the calculation results of rh - doped iridates , sr@xmath2rh@xmath12ir@xmath13o@xmath3 , are summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : ls_br ] ( see the filled blue squares ; corresponding to the upper @xmath14-axis ) where xas data is also presented ( open blue squares).the good agreement between calculation and experiment is clearly noticed over the wide range of rh - doping ratio , @xmath14 . note that the error can be caused in both theoretical and experimental estimation as marked by the error bars . in calculations ,",
    "the one important source of error is the range of integration ; namely , how to deal with the small portion of ir-@xmath6 states hybridized with oxygen states while the major ir peaks are clearly identified .",
    "according to our estimation , this intrinsic ambiguity can cause the deviation of branching ratio by up to @xmath710.25 which is @xmath72% . counting the number of holes ( or electrons ) in ir-5d orbitals",
    "is another source of errors .",
    "this is related to the long - standing issue of charge decomposition in the electronic structure calculation , and the number of holes depends on the electron counting method . in this study , we used the standard mulliken charge analysis . for experimental data",
    ", we simply take the error limits presented in ref .",
    "@xcite .     and",
    "( b ) branching ratio in comparison with experiments ( open symbols ) .",
    "the upper ( corresponding to the dark blue symbols ) and lower axis ( magenta symbols ) refers to sr@xmath2rh@xmath12ir@xmath13o@xmath3 and sr@xmath2@xmath15iro@xmath4 ( @xmath15 = mg , sc , ti ) , respectively .",
    "the error bars for experimental data are taken from the original papers .",
    "the error bars in the calculation results reflect the ambiguity related to the numerical parameters and other computation details ( see the main text for more details ) .",
    "inset : the effect of oxygen vacancy has been simulated for sr@xmath2mgiro@xmath73 .",
    "the horizontal dashed lines refer to the experimental values .",
    "the filled ( blue ) symbols represent the result of rigid band shift and the half - filled ( magenta ) symbols are the result of the supercell calculation with oxygen removal ]    note that the @xmath0 and branching ratio are basically unchanged over the wide range of @xmath14 , and clearly larger than the rh value of @xmath740.8 and @xmath743 , respectively @xcite .",
    "this result is therefore in contrast to the previously suggested picture of ` soc tuning ' in which rh - doping is assumed to reduce the soc strength of ir sites @xcite .",
    "it is one example to show the importance of calculating soc from the realistic electronic structure .",
    "another system we take to test our method is iridate double perovskites , sr@xmath75iro@xmath4 ( @xmath15 : mg , sc , ti ) .",
    "this series of materials are studied recently with xas @xcite while no theoretical investigation has been reported yet . among many different double perovskite iridates , we chose @xmath15= mg , sc , and ti in which @xmath15 has @xmath76 configuration , and therefore we could avoid the additional ambiguity in determining @xmath5 values for @xmath15 sites .",
    "the nominal ir valence in these compounds are @xmath77 , @xmath78 , and @xmath79 for sr@xmath2mgiro@xmath4 , sr@xmath2sciro@xmath4 , sr@xmath2tiiro@xmath4 , respectively , serving as a good test case to check the reliability of our method .",

    "[ fig : dos ] .",
    "the so - called effective total angular momentum @xmath82-character is well identified ( @xmath7=1/2 and 3/2 is in red and blue color , respectively ) .",
    "the gradual increase of ir-@xmath6 band filling is clearly observed as we go from mg ( @xmath83-filled @xmath7=3/2 ) to sc ( fully - filled @xmath7=3/2 ) and to ti ( half - filled @xmath7=1/2 ) .",
    "the ti case has the same nominal valence with sr@xmath2iro@xmath3 . among these three compounds",
    ", sr@xmath2mgiro@xmath4 is reported first by jung and demazeau @xcite and its semiconducting behavior in the transport @xcite and antiferromagnetic ordering below @xmath84k @xcite are consistent with our results .",
    "the results of @xmath0 and branching ratio are summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : ls_br](a ) and ( b ) , respectively ( see the magenta diamond symbols corresponding to the lower axis ) .",
    "again , the overall good agreement with xas data is clearly noticed .",
    "here we also note several possible sources of deviation , when compared to the experiments , such as the material dependent @xmath5 values , long pdos tails due to the hybridization , and the electron number counting with the mulliken analysis .",
    "considering the uncertainties related to all of these factors , the agreement within the error bar is quite impressive . according to the previous studies @xcite ,",
    "it is noted that the amount of oxygen vacancy is likely non - negligible especially for @xmath15=mg sample ( sr@xmath2mgiro@xmath73 : @xmath85 0.35 at 1 bar ) .",
    "it is another factor that can cause the difference between experiment and calculation .",
    "in fact , the difference is distinguishable ( considering the error bars ) only in the @xmath15=mg case .",
    "in order to see the effect of oxygen vacancy , we performed the rigid - band shift ( @xmath86= 0 , 0.1 , 0.2 , 0.3 , 0.4 ) and the supercell calculation ( @xmath86=0.4 ) . in the former",

    "the calculated soc and branching ratio are not noticeably different .",
    "it indicates that the effect of magnetic order and structural distortion is not significant .",
    "it is also found that the @xmath5 dependence is not significant in the range we considered .",
