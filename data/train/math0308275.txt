    "noncommutative differential geometry is a growing subject centering around the exploration of a new kind of geometric spaces which do not belong to the classical geometric world .",
    "the theory is resting on large classes of examples as well as on the elaboration of new general concepts .",
    "the main sources of examples so far have been provided by :    * a general principle allowing to understand difficult quotients of classical spaces , typically spaces of leaves of foliations , as noncommutative spaces . *",
    "deformation theory which provides rich sources of examples in particular in the context of  quantization \" problems .",
    "* spaces of direct relevance in physics such as the brillouin zone in the quantum hall effect , or even space - time as in the context of the standard model with its higgs sector .",
    "we recently came across a whole class of new noncommutative spaces defined as solutions of a basic equation of @xmath8-theoretic origin .",
    "this equation was at first expected to admit only commutative ( or nearly commutative ) solutions .    whereas classical spheres provide simple solutions of arbitrary dimension @xmath9 , it turned out that when the dimension @xmath9 is @xmath10 there are very interesting new , and highly noncommutative , solutions",
    ". the first examples were given in @xcite , and in @xcite ( hereafter refered to as part i ) we began the classification of all solutions in the @xmath4-dimensional case , by giving an exhaustive list of noncommutative 3-spheres @xmath11 , and analysing the  critical \" cases .",
    "we also explained in @xcite a basic relation , for generic values of our  modulus \" @xmath12 , between the algebra of coordinates on the noncommutative @xmath13-space of which @xmath11 is the unit sphere , and the sklyanin algebras which were introduced in the context of totally integrable systems .",
    "+ in this work we analyse the structure of noncommutative @xmath4-spheres @xmath11 and of their moduli space .",
    "we started from the above relation with the sklyanin algebras and first computed basic cyclic cohomology invariants using @xmath14-functions .",
    "the invariant to be computed was depending on an elliptic curve ( with modulus @xmath15 ) and several points on the curve .",
    "it appeared as a sum of @xmath16 terms , each an integral over a period of a rational fraction of high degree ( @xmath17 ) in @xmath14-functions and their derivatives .",
    "after computing the first terms in the @xmath18-expansion of the sum , ( with the help of a computer ) , and factoring out basic elliptic functions of the above parameters , we were left with a scalar function of @xmath18 , starting as , + @xmath19 in which one recognises the @xmath20 power of the dedekind @xmath21-function .",
    "+ we then gradually simplified the result ( with @xmath22 appearing as an integration factor from the derivative of the weierstrass @xmath23-function ) and elaborated the concepts which directly explain the final form of the result .",
    "+ the main new conceptual tool which we obtained and that we develop in this paper is the notion of central quadratic form for quadratic algebras ( definition [ cent ] ) .",
    "the geometric data @xmath24 of a quadratic algebra @xmath25 is a standard notion ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) defined in such a way that the algebra maps homomorphically to a cross - product algebra obtained from sections of powers of the line bundle @xmath26 on powers of the correspondence @xmath27 . we shall prove a purely algebraic result ( lemma [ alg0 ] ) which considerably refines the above homomorphism and lands in a richer cross - product . its origin can be traced as explained above to the work of sklyanin ( @xcite ) and odesskii - feigin ( @xcite ) . + our construction is then refined to control the @xmath0-norm ( theorem [ c * ] ) and to construct the differential calculus in the desired generality ( section 8) .",
    "it also allows to show the pertinence of the general  spectral \" framework for noncommutative geometry , in spite of the rather esoteric nature of the above examples .",
    "+ we apply the general theory of central quadratic forms to show that the noncommutative 3-spheres @xmath11 admit a natural ramified covering @xmath3 by a noncommutative @xmath4-manifold @xmath28 which is ( in the even case , cf .",
    "proposition [ siginvar ] ) isomorphic to the mapping torus of an outer automorphism of the noncommutative @xmath29-torus @xmath30 .",
    "it is a noncommutative version of a nilmanifold ( corollary [ h3 ] ) with a natural action of the heisenberg lie algebra @xmath31 and an invariant trace .",
    "this covering yields the differential calculus in its  transcendental \" form .",
    "another important novel concept which plays a basic role in the present paper is the notion of jacobian for a morphism of noncommutative spaces , developed from basic ideas of noncommutative differential geometry @xcite and expressed in terms of hochschild homology ( section 7 ) .",
    "we compute the jacobian of the above ramified covering @xmath3 by pairing the direct image of the fundamental class of the noncommutative @xmath4-dimensional nilmanifold @xmath28 with the chern character of the defining unitary and obtain the answer as the product of a period ( of an elliptic integral ) by a rational function ( theorem [ vol ] and corollary [ nct0 ] ) . as explained above , we first computed these expressions in terms of elliptic functions and modular forms which led us in order to simplify the results to extend the moduli space from the real to the complex domain , and to formulate everything in geometric terms .",
    "the leaves of the scaling foliation of the real moduli space then appear as the real parts of a net of degree @xmath13 elliptic curves in @xmath32 having @xmath2 points in common .",
    "these elliptic curves turn out to play a fundamental role and to be closely related to the elliptic curves of the geometric data ( cf .",
    "section @xmath13 ) of the quadratic algebras which their elements label .",
    "in fact we first directly compared the @xmath33-invariant of the generic fibers ( of the scaling foliation ) with the @xmath33-invariant of the quadratic algebras , and found them to be equal .",
    "this equality is surprising in that it fails in the degenerate ( non - generic ) cases , where the characteristic variety can be as large as @xmath32 .",
    "moreover , even in the generic case , the two notions of  real \" points , either in the fiber or in the characteristic variety are not the same , but dual to each other .",
    "we eventually explain in theorem [ iden ] the generic coincidence between the leaves of the scaling foliation in the complexified moduli space and the characteristic varieties of the associated quadratic algebras .",
    "this theorem [ iden ] also exhibits the relation of our theory with iterations of a specific birational automorphism of @xmath32 , defined over @xmath34 , and restricting on each fiber as a translation of this elliptic curve .",
    "the generic irrationality of this translation and the nature of its diophantine approximation play an important role in sections 7 and 8 .",
    "+ another important result is the appearance of the hyperfinite factor of type ii@xmath5 as cross - product of the field @xmath6 of meromorphic functions on an elliptic curve by a subgroup of the galois group aut@xmath7 , ( theorem  [ gal ] ) and the description of the differential calculus in general ( lemma [ cyclic ] ) and in  rational \" form on @xmath11 ( theorem  [ fund ] ) .",
    "the detailed proofs together with the analysis of the spectral geometry of @xmath11 and of the @xmath0-algebra @xmath35 will appear in part ii .",
    "let us now be more specific and describe the basic @xmath8-theoretic equation defining our spheres . in the simplest case",
    "it asserts that the algebra @xmath25 of  coordinates \" on the noncommutative space is generated by a self - adjoint idempotent @xmath36 , ( @xmath37 , @xmath38 ) together with the algebra @xmath39 of two by two scalar matrices .",
    "the only relation is that the trace of @xmath36 vanishes , i.e. that the projection of @xmath36 on the commutant of @xmath39 is zero .",
    "one shows that @xmath25 is then the algebra @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the algebra of coordinates on the standard @xmath29-sphere @xmath42 .",
    "+ the general form of the equation distinguishes two cases according to the parity of the dimension @xmath9 . in the even case the algebra @xmath25 of  coordinates \" on the noncommutative space is still generated by a projection @xmath36 , ( @xmath37 , @xmath38 ) and an algebra of scalar matrices , but the dimension @xmath43 appears in requiring the vanishing not only of the trace of @xmath36 , but of all components of its chern character of degree @xmath44 .",
    "this of course involves the algebraic ( cyclic homology ) formulation of the chern character .    the chern character in cyclic homology @xcite , @xcite",
    ", @xmath45 is the noncommutative geometric analogue of the classical chern character .",
    "we describe it in the odd case which is relevant in our case @xmath46 . given a noncommutative algebra @xmath25 , an invertible element @xmath47 in @xmath48 defines a class in @xmath49 and the components of its chern character are given by , @xmath50 where @xmath51 and summation over repeated indices is understood .    by a noncommutative @xmath52-dimensional spherical manifold ( n odd ) , we mean the noncommutative space @xmath53 dual to the @xmath54-algebra @xmath25 generated by the components @xmath55 of a solution @xmath56 , @xmath57 , of the equation @xmath58 which is the noncommutative counterpart of the vanishing of the lower chern classes of the bott generator of the @xmath8-theory of classical odd spheres .",
