    "linear elasticity equation plays an important role in solid mechanics . in particular , when an elastic body is occupied by heterogeneous materials having distinct lam parameters @xmath2 and @xmath3 , the governing equation holds on each disjoint domain and certain jump conditions must be satisfied along the interface of two materials @xcite .",
    "this kind of problems involving composite materials is getting more and more attentions from both engineers and mathematicians in recent years , but efficient numerical schemes are not fully developed yet . to solve such equations numerically",
    ", one usually uses finite element methods with meshes aligned with the interface between two materials .",
    "however , such methods involve unstructured grids resulting in algebraic systems which involve more unknowns and irregular data structure .    solving linear elasticity equation with finite element methods has been studied extensively and several methods have been developed , see @xcite,@xcite,@xcite and references therein . for lower order methods , when @xmath0-conforming element method is applied , the so - called ` locking phenomena '",
    "is observed when the material is nearly incompressible ( @xcite,@xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "brenner and sung @xcite showed that the crouzeix - raviart ( cr ) @xmath0-nonconforming element @xcite does not lock on pure displacement problem .",
    "but one can not use this element to a traction - boundary problem since it does not satisfy discrete korn s inequality .",
    "a remedy was recently suggested by hansbo et al .",
    "@xcite who exploited the idea of discontinuous galerkin methods ( @xcite,@xcite,@xcite ) . by introducing a stabilizing term , they proved the convergence of a locking free @xmath0-nonconforming method for problems with traction boundary conditions .    solving problems with composite materials is more difficult .",
    "since the laplace - young condition holds along the interface , these problems exhibit a similar property as the traction boundary type problems , even if the dirichlet boundary condition is imposed on the boundary of the whole domain .",
    "thus the cr element may not work properly for such problems . in the discussion of the above methods ,",
    "meshes are assumed to be aligned with the interface .",
    "we will resolve this problem by adding stabilizing terms for unaligned grids ( see below ) . on the other hand , alternative methods which use meshes independent of interface , thus allowing the interface to cut through the elements , have been developed recently for diffusion problems .",
    "the motivations for using such meshes are : easiness of grid generations , treatment of moving grids , especially time dependent problems , simple data structure of linear system , fast solvers , and so on .",
    "there are two types of such methods in principle : one belongs to the extended finite element methods ( xfem ) ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) and another belongs to the immersed finite element methods ( ifem ) .",
    "( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite,@xcite,@xcite ) in the xfem type we need , in addition to the standard nodal basis functions , enriched basis functions obtained by truncating the shape functions along the interface cut so that three ( six for planar elasticity problems ) extra degrees of freedom are present per element .",
    "but in the ifems , we do not require extra degrees of freedom , instead modify the finite element shape functions so that they satisfy certain jump conditions along the interface .    for some xfem type of works related to the interface elasticity problems , we refer to @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , where they added enriched basis functions obtained by multiplying heaviside functions along the crack , and asymptotic basis of polar form near the tip .",
    "even so , they often use grid refinement near the interface .",
    "see hansbo et al .",
    "@xcite,@xcite,@xcite , where they used nitsche s @xcite idea of adding penalty terms along the interface of elements . for methods based on finite difference ,",
    "see @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite , for example .    in this paper",
    ", we develop a new method based on the ifem using the broken cr element for a linear elasticity problem having an interface .",
    "we modify the ( vector ) basis functions to satisfy the laplace - young condition along the interface .",
    "our method does not use any extra shape function as in xfem , hence our method yields exactly the same matrix structure as the problems of constant lam parameters , and has less degrees of freedom than xfem .",
    "furthermore , numerical results show that our method does not need a mesh refinement .    near the completion of our first version of this manuscript @xcite",
    ", we found that lin et al .",
    "@xcite have developed an ifem similar to ours based on the rotated @xmath5 nonconforming element without using stability terms to solve elasticity equations with interface , but no analysis is given .",
    "in contrast , we prove optimal error estimates of our scheme ( based on cr @xmath0 nonconforming element ) , by adding stabilizing terms along the edges of elements for the coercivity of the bilinear forms .",
    "the rest of our paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we introduce the linear elasticity problems having interior interface along which the laplace - young condition holds and state their local regularity . for simplicity",
    ", we assume the dirichlet data even though traction boundary condition on some part of boundary can be assigned . in section 3",
    ", we introduce our new scheme for solving such problems using the cr @xmath0 nonconforming finite element . for this purpose ,",
    "we modify the vector basis functions so that they satisfy the laplace - young condition along the interface . in section 4 ,",
    "we introduce various norms and function spaces related to interface problems .",
    "next we prove the approximation property of our finite element space and optimal error estimates in @xmath1 and divergence norm .",
    "finally , numerical experiments are presented in section 5 , which supports our results .",
    "let @xmath6 be a connected , convex polygonal domain in @xmath7 which is divided into two subdomains @xmath8 and @xmath9 by a @xmath10 interface @xmath11 , see figure [ fig : doma0 ] .",
    "we assume the subdomains @xmath8 and @xmath9 are occupied by two elastic materials having different lam constants . for a differentiable function @xmath12 and a tensor @xmath13 , we let",
