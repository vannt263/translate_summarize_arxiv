    "the mid - infrared ( mid - ir ) is a unique window to study the evolution of star - forming galaxies , especially at redshift @xmath2 where the cosmic star formation rate ( sfr ) peaks ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "measurements that determine the ir luminosity , , from these missions trace the energy absorbed from uv photons emitted by short - lived massive stars ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ". the most direct approach to measure  is to use multi - band mid- and far - ir photometry .",

    "the complete characterization of the spectral peak of the dust emission provides a good measurement of  and sfr .",
    "however , the inherent requirement of multi - band photometry for far - ir sed fitting compromises this approach for faint galaxies whose detection is limited by confusion noise , particularly at the longer wavelengths ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a second approach is to use a monochromatic ( single - band ) ir luminosity to trace  and sfr .",
    "locally , the rest - frame single - band 24 @xmath1 luminosity has been shown to be one of the best tracers for  and sfr @xcite .",
    "although the longer wavelengths , such as 70 @xmath1 and 160 @xmath1 , are closer to the peak of the thermal dust emission and thus reduce the size of the bolometric corrections , they are affected more by the cold dust heated by old stars , which increases scatter in the sfr calibration compared to estimates from 24 @xmath1 @xcite , particularly in less luminous ir galaxies @xcite .    beyond the local universe , however , the redshifted 24 @xmath1 band probes wavelengths containing the aromatic emissions ( e.g. , polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons , hereafter pah ) ; the strongest pah emission complexes at 6.2 , 7.7 , and 8.6 @xmath1 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) redshift into the 24 @xmath1 band by @xmath10 .",
    "although they help boost the 24 @xmath1 flux and aid detection of galaxies at high @xmath8 , pahs pose two challenges to using single - band 24 @xmath1 observations to estimate  and sfr .",
    "first , the pah emission is influenced by environment ( e.g. , uv radiation , optical depth ) , introducing a @xmath11dex scatter to the  and sfr estimates @xcite .",
    "second , the pah emission appears to strengthen intrinsically at high @xmath8 compared to that found in local galaxies with the same  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the bolometric corrections to determine  measured from local galaxies in the pah wavelength regions will not be applicable at high @xmath8 .",
    "recent studies indicate that applying the local bolometric corrections to high-@xmath8 galaxies will overestimate their  and sfr by up to an order of magnitude .",

    "we follow the convention of @xcite and adopt the definition of  of @xcite ; these studies defined  slightly differently ( i.e. , @xmath21 @xmath1 vs. @xmath22 @xmath1 ) , but the resulting  values are closely consistent .",
    "we will refer to galaxies with  in the range of @xmath23 and those with  @xmath24  as luminous infrared galaxies ( lirgs ) and ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) , respectively , or collectively as u / lirgs .",
    "in this section , we will discuss the challenges in using _ spitzer _",
    "observations at 24 @xmath1 to estimate  and sfr .",
    "major issues are to determine an overall approach for using  as an indicator of a galaxy sed ( section [ sec : sedevol_intro ] ) , and the choice of sed library ( section [ sec : sedevol_sedchoice ] ) .      until now",
    ", most estimations of the  and sfr of galaxies using single - band ir observations rely on an assumption that the sed of a star - forming galaxy does not evolve with redshift , i.e. , that bolometric corrections measured from local sed templates can be applied to high-@xmath8 galaxies .",
    "however , local ir galaxies , from which we construct the sed libraries , comprise an inhomogeneous population of both normal star - forming galaxies ( quiescent disks ) and those with nuclear star - formation induced by galaxy interactions . the contribution of interaction - induced star formation increases with ; locally",
    ", theoretical studies suggest that ulirgs must be dominated by interaction - induced starbursts to achieve their  outputs @xcite , which is consistent with observations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the application of local bolometric corrections to high-@xmath8 galaxies thus carries an implicit assumption that high-@xmath8 star - forming galaxies are likewise dominated by interaction - induced starbursts .",
    "observations have shown , however , that actively star - forming galaxies at high @xmath8 are different from their local counterparts in at least three major aspects . first , the ir seds at high @xmath8 exhibit colder far - ir dust temperatures , , than local galaxies at fixed  @xcite .",
    "these galaxies have dust temperatures similar to local galaxies with lower .",
    "second is the aforementioned evolution of the strength of the aromatic features , which grow stronger at high @xmath8 at a fixed .",
    "quantitatively , for instance , @xcite found abell 2218a , a galaxy with  of @xmath25  at @xmath26 , to exhibit aromatic emission features virtually identical to those of a local galaxy with an order of magnitude lower .",
    "third , @xcite found that the diameters of the galactic - wide star - forming regions in high-@xmath8 u / lirgs are @xmath27 larger than those of local u / lirgs at the same .",
    "the size of the star - forming regions found in high-@xmath8 u / lirgs is similar to that of local normal star - forming galaxies ( sub - lirg ) , @xmath28 kpc in diameter , but with  scaled up by a factor of @xmath29 ( figures 3 and 4 of * ? ? ?",
    "this structural similarity is a manifestation of the `` main sequence '' of star - forming galaxies , originally defined as a sequence of galaxies in stellar mass vs. sfr space @xcite , where star - formation occurs at a relatively steady rate rather than in bursts , and in disks or clumps , rather than in merger nuclei ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in its simplest form",
    ", this picture suggests that these galaxies differ among themselves ( and from local lower luminosity star - forming galaxies ) primarily in the sfr surface density , , and hence in ir luminosity surface density , .    in figure [ lir_lirsd ] , adapted from figure 4 of @xcite",
    ", we show  as a function of  along with trend lines describing the relationship in each population , one for local galaxies with  above @xmath30  and another for high-@xmath8 galaxies .",
    "the main sequence can be drawn in this figure from the local normal star - forming galaxies ( sub - lirg galaxies ) onto the high-@xmath8 star - forming galaxies .",
    "both the local and high-@xmath8 relationships agree below  @xmath31 .",
    "the trends diverge above the lirg threshold , where the local galaxy sample starts to be dominated by galaxies harboring interaction - induced star formation ( see also @xcite for the local relationship ) .",
    "@xcite estimated , defined by  @xmath32 /@xmath33 , by measuring the area , @xmath33 , of the ir - emitting region using radio continuum ( e.g. , 1.4 ghz ) , paschen-@xmath34 , and 24 @xmath1 observations . although the emission physics of these size measures is different , they trace a consistent physical extent of the star - forming regions and are similarly insensitive to contributions from old stellar populations .",
    "paschen-@xmath34 and 24 @xmath1 are the two best ir tracers of sfr and are emitted from approximately the same spatial extent .",
    "also , @xcite found that radio continuum ( e.g. , 1.4 ghz ) and far - ir size measurements are consistent within 15% .",
    "for the purpose of determining the surface area of star formation in individual galaxies , we will thus use these three size tracers interchangeably . among these indicators ,",
    "only the interferometric observation of the radio synchrotron continuum can resolve individual galaxies at high-@xmath8 .",
    "the main sample of high-@xmath8 galaxies in the figure [ lir_lirsd ] was therefore from the @xcite 1.4 ghz vla+merlin survey of the _ hubble _ deep field with angular resolution of @xmath35 .",
    "this is a blind survey that has resolved all of the 92 detected galaxies , which assures that the extended physical sizes at high @xmath8 are not due to selection bias .",
    "the muxlow et al .",
    "sample is augmented by radio observations of sub - mm galaxies from the literature with similarly high angular resolutions .",
    "the samples of galaxies with physical size measurements is tabulated in the online material accompanying this paper for interested readers .",
    "following the @xcite example , the use of  as an indicator of sed characteristics can be illustrated by envisioning a horizontal line at a fixed  in figure [ lir_lirsd ] . as an example , if we assume the @xmath26 abell 2218a with  of @xmath25 , observed by @xcite , is located on the main - sequence , we would expect it to exhibit spectral characteristics of a galaxy on the local sequence with  of @xmath36  that has the same .",
    "@xcite further demonstrate the ability of  to predict sed behavior by predicting the 24 @xmath1-to-1.4 ghz flux ratios , which are sensitive to pah features at @xmath10 , consistently with the observed ratios ( their figure 5 ) , as well as matching the average observed aromatic spectrum of high-@xmath8 ulirgs to a local sed template ( their figure 7 ) .",
    "the assumption that  is the dominant parameter controlling the average sed thus provides a tool to assign an appropriate local sed template to represent the sed of high-@xmath8 galaxies , a result we will use to construct an indicator for  and sfr in this work .",
    "the  method is physically motivated because the pah emission emerges from the outer surfaces of the photodissociation regions ( pdrs ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so the surface density of the sfr is a controlling factor for the pah - emitting surface area and thus the pah emission strength .",
    "additionally , @xcite modeled the radiative transfer in centrally heated dusty sources and found a general relation among the luminosity - to - mass ratio , the surface density , and the shape of the sed .",
    "they predict that the behavior of sed templates for local galaxies might not extend to high @xmath8 .",
    "extended sizes and colder seds were also shown to be connected through a -  relation explored by @xcite , who theoretically described the ir - emitting region of a star - forming galaxy as an isothermal cloud optically thick to optical wavelengths and optically thin in the ir .",
    "@xcite show that , , and the extent of the ir - emitting region are related by a fundamental plane ; the -  relation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is a manifestation thereof .",
    "the sed libraries commonly used to represent the spectra of star - forming galaxies are those of , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the former two libraries were based on spectra taken by _ iso _",
    ", preceding the availability of full spectral coverage at @xmath37 @xmath1 ( that the 24 @xmath1 band probes at redshift @xmath38 ) .",
    "the recent infrared spectrograph ( irs ) observations from _ spitzer _ , covering @xmath39 @xmath1 , show that the @xcite sed templates ( hereafter , ce01 ) have suppressed aromatic features at very high luminosity @xcite and do not sufficiently take into account the strong silicate absorption features at 10 @xmath1 , resulting in weaker aromatic bands but stronger net emission in the pah - region comparing to observed galaxies @xcite .",
    "the @xcite sed library is optimized to describe moderately - luminous local star - forming galaxies with  @xmath40  and hence the lack of silicate absorption in these templates becomes more significant at higher  with larger typical extinction .",
    "@xcite developed sed templates ( hereafter , r09 ) , which we adopt as the sed reference for local galaxies , separately for normal star - forming galaxies ( sub - lirg ) and u / lirgs to provide a self - consistent sed library covering  of @xmath41 to @xmath42 .",
    "the u / lirgs sed templates were constructed from a sample of 11 local lirgs and ulirgs with high quality _ spitzer _ irs spectra as well as photometric data covering optical to radio wavelengths ( see figures 1 , 2 , and 3 of @xcite ) .",
    "these u / lirgs were chosen such that their ir emission is dominated by star - forming activity .",
    "construction of the sed library is done in two steps .",
    "first , these 11 galaxies were used as a basis to assemble 11 archetypal sed templates spanning 0.4 @xmath1 to 30 cm wavelength .",
    "their irs spectra ( @xmath43 @xmath1 ) were joined to the photospheric emission and far - ir dust emission components in a series of tests to ensure both spectral continuity and appropriate flux calibration .",
    "second , these archetypal templates were combined with different weights to produce the final averaged sed templates .",
    "the template weights were optimized by matching synthesized ir colors from the combined template to the average ir colors of observed galaxies as a function of  from irac and the _ iras _ rbgs @xcite .",
    "the r09 library construction was extended to star - forming galaxies with sub - lirg  by combining the @xcite sed library with the mid - ir spectral library based on irs observations from @xcite using the same ir color fitting technique as in the u / lirg template construction .",
    "the use of ir color to help guide the combination of archetypal templates ( i.e. , fitting @xmath44 @xmath1 , @xmath45 @xmath1 , and @xmath46 @xmath1 colors simultaneously ) helps ensure that the final templates represent the average properties of real galaxies even though they are constructed from a limited sample .",
    "the r09 sed library construction is described in detail in the appendix of @xcite .",
    "we adopt these templates for this paper .",
    "the construction of a 24 @xmath1 sfr indicator has two steps : ( 1 ) construct an  estimator using 24 @xmath1 flux and redshift , and then ( 2 ) derive a relationship between  and sfr .",
    "the first step would appear to require measuring  for each galaxy to determine the appropriate sed template .",
    "however , the relatively small scatter of the high-@xmath8 galaxies around the main sequence in figure [ lir_lirsd ] suggests that adequate sed template matching can be achieved by assuming a typical surface area . in this section",
    ", we will use the sample with  measurements in figure [ lir_lirsd ] to construct a formula that can be applied to estimate sfrs in the absence of the physical size measurements .",
    "@xcite first assign a value of  to each sed template and then determine the corresponding sfr as well as the monochromatic luminosity through the desired bandpasses .",
    "for the 24 @xmath1 band , in particular , the assignment of the 24 @xmath1 luminosity of a template follows the ratio of -to-  based on the local _ iras _ data ( see fig .",
    "15 , and formula a6 of * ? ? ?",
    "once each template has an associated 24 @xmath1 luminosity , it is possible to calculate the k - corrections and subsequently the expected monochromatic flux for each template as a function of redshift . for @xmath48 , the k - correction , @xmath49 , and the flux , @xmath50 ,",
    "are related by    @xmath51    @xmath52    where @xmath53 is the luminosity distance for an object at redshift @xmath8 .",
    "the @xmath54 for this equation has the units of jy @xmath55 .",
    "the relationship between the observed monochromatic flux from each template and the template s monochromatic luminosity at a given redshift is approximately linear , which allows for a linear fit at each redshift ( i.e. , for a redshift grid ) to determine a set of coefficients that convert the observed flux at a given redshift to the luminosity or any quantity associated with the template ( e.g. ,  and sfr ) .",
    "for example , a relationship between  and the observed 24 @xmath1 flux , @xmath56 , has the form    @xmath57,\\ ] ]    where @xmath58 and @xmath59 are the intercept and the slope from the linear fit , respectively , @xmath60 is a zero - point to reduce covariance in the fit parameters , and @xmath61 refers to the  associated with each of the r09 sed templates . @xcite",
    "use this method to tabulate the coefficients to convert the monochromatic fluxes in various bands to the sfr of galaxies .",
    "this formalism successfully estimates  and sfr for local galaxies .",
    "however , a modification is needed to apply the formalism at high @xmath8 @xcite . if we assume that ir star - forming galaxies beyond the local universe are in the main sequence ( we discuss the validity and applicability of this assumption in section [ sec : discuss_sfmodes ] ) , it is possible to use the corresponding  as a guide to estimate  and sfr at high @xmath8 without the need for  measurements of individual galaxies .",
    "following @xcite , an appropriate choice of sed to use for calculations of the k - correction and bolometric correction beyond the local universe is the one corresponding to the same  locally .",
    "this is equivalent to reassigning the  associated with each of the r09 sed templates to new values determined by the ratio of luminosities with equal  on the local u / lirg trend to those on the main sequence .",
    "we will refer to this ratio as the _ stretching factor _",
    ", @xmath62 , for each sed template . from figure [ lir_lirsd ]",
    ", @xmath62 is nearly negligible at @xmath63  and reaches three orders of magnitude at @xmath64 of @xmath65 . to determine @xmath62 quantitatively , we parameterize the relationship by fitting a parabola to the local u / lirg relation ( excluding the lower limits of  from co observations ) and a linear fit to the main sequence , and then take the ratio of  on the main sequence fit to the r09 template  at the same  ( see figure [ lir_lirsd ] ; the @xmath62 values are tabulated in table [ table_si ] ) .",
    "since we effectively increase the luminosity of each template by a factor of @xmath62 , the observed flux will also be increased by the same factor .",
    "equation [ eq3 ] can thus be rewritten as @xmath66 } \\nonumber \\\\",

    "we have limited the fitting range to only encompass the `` stretched '' luminosity of log@xmath70 @xmath71 because the stretched luminosities at large @xmath62 are far greater than the luminosity range occupied by real galaxies ( the @xmath65  cut off is chosen because we expect this to be approximately at luminosity limit of star - forming galaxies ) . for a given template , the shape as a function of redshift remains the same .",
    "the effect of the @xmath62 is to change the spacing between templates .",

    "the bottom panel of figure [ compare_lir_cdfs ] and the top panel of figure [ compare_lir_hdfn ] suggest that the  values from the new indicator and from that of @xcite , which assumes compact - starburst ( i.e. , local ) sed templates without the use of , converge to within 0.25 dex of each other at all  up to @xmath185 . the agreement is better at lower , e.g. , @xmath186 dex at @xmath187  that is typical for star - forming u / lirgs at low @xmath8 .",
    "that is , for practical purposes , both indicators can be used interchangeably below @xmath188 regardless of the compactness of galaxies star - forming regions .    at intermediate @xmath8 ( @xmath189 ) ,",
    "the precise fractions of galaxies that form stars in the extended and compact modes remain a subject of controversy . @xcite",
    "discuss the various merger indicators critically to remove the discrepancies as much as possible and find that mergers are , in fact , important out to @xmath190 , with minor mergers about three times more frequent than major ones .",
    "to the first order , this result appears consistent with the tests of our  indicator in section [ sec : indicator_teststat ] , which support our initial assumption that a majority of star - forming galaxies beyond the local universe reside in the main sequence of star - forming galaxies . the main sequence picture for ir galaxies is also advocated by @xcite who find that nearly @xmath191 of ir star - forming galaxies studied by _",
    "herschel _ have the ratio of the 8 @xmath1 luminosity to  consistent with being in the extended mode of star formation .",
    "a remaining issue is the precise transition scheme from the merger - induced mode of star formation found locally to the extended mode of star formation at high @xmath8 , which is actually among the fundamental questions in galaxy evolution as it is closely tied to the mechanism of the decline of sfr since @xmath190 .",
    "a theoretical interpretation was provided by @xcite , but future observations will be required to study this transition definitively .    avid readers will have noticed that most of the individual test galaxies at redshift @xmath192 in section [ sec : indicator_testindiv ] are less luminous than @xmath187 .",
    "space density of ulirg at these redshifts is too sparse for large number of them to be present in pencil - beam surveys , such as those used in section [ sec : indicator_testindiv ] .",
    "therefore , while we have tested the new indicator thoroughly with typical star - forming galaxies at @xmath193 , the formalism may not be adequate to describe luminous ulirgs in this redshift range .",
    "but these ulirgs at the bright - end of the luminosity function are often bright enough to be within reach of the current far - ir , sub - mm , and radio facilities to provide direct measurement of the .",
    "the results from the new 24 @xmath1 indicator should therefore be cross - checked with these independent bands when possible .",
    "we must also caution that there are very few galaxies with  @xmath194  in the seven tests in section [ sec : indicator_test ] due to their rarity , even at @xmath195 .",
    "this hyperluminous regime could be dominated by merger - triggered compact starbursts even at high @xmath8 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which will result in an underestimation of  and sfr by up to 0.5 dex ( refer to color - coded lines representing compact objects as a function of @xmath8 in figures [ compare_lir_cdfs ] and [ compare_lir_hdfn ] ) .",
    "for the same reasons that prevent us from thoroughly testing this luminosity regime , we expect compact hyperluminous starbursts to be rare , and will not affect the usefulness of the new indicator within the goal of providing a tracer of sfr in typical u / lirgs ( e.g. , @xmath196 galaxies ) out to @xmath197 , where most of the stellar mass in the universe was formed .",
    "again , these most luminous galaxies will be bright enough for independent measurements of sfr using far - ir , sub - mm , and radio observations .",
    "it has been suggested that local ulirgs are optically thick to mid - ir photons and radiation pressure may play a role in limiting their maximum luminosity @xcite .",
    "if the degree of compactness is assumed to be similar for both the local and high-@xmath8 ulirgs , the ir emission of high-@xmath8 ulirgs with  commonly found far above their local counterparts might exceed the eddington luminosity .",
    "our results ease the concerns about the eddington limit of ulirgs at high @xmath8 for two reasons .",
    "first , galaxies at higher  are affected by the mid - ir excess to a greater extent .",
    "the new indicator would therefore lower the  estimates especially for high - luminosity galaxies . to test the effects of  reduction to the luminosity functions of galaxies , we construct a set of ir lfs of 24 @xmath1 sources at @xmath198 using the 24 @xmath1 observations from cosmos ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and find that the bright - ends of the lfs in all redshift bins are below  of @xmath199  ( quantitatively , galaxies with  above @xmath185  are rarer than @xmath200mpc@xmath201dex in all redshift bins ) , which suggests that the maximum  of star - forming galaxies is in general @xmath202 .",
    "second , the success of the corrections for the size evolution described in @xcite as well as this work to account for the general ir sed evolution indicate that the great majority of high-@xmath8 ir galaxies are physically extended , which lowers the optical depth of the galaxy .",
    "both the lower  and optical depth imply that high-@xmath8 ulirgs are emitting below the eddington limit and that the maximum  of these galaxies is not governed by radiation pressure .",
    "the use of single - band mid - ir indicators ( such as 24 @xmath1 observations ) to estimate  has previously been affected by the differences between the structure of local u / lirgs , upon which the sed templates were constructed , and those of the galaxies in the cosmological surveys being studied .",
    "starbursts in the local u / lirgs are interaction - induced and compact ( sub - kpc ) , while u / lirgs at high @xmath8 are typically much more extended ( @xmath137 few kpc ) , with surface areas @xmath203 larger than their local counterparts .",
    "the resulting larger surface area of the photodissociation regions harboring aromatic emission leads to stronger aromatic features at high @xmath8 that appears as an evolution in aromatic strength with @xmath8 .",
    "the ultimate implication of this morphological difference is that single - band mid - ir observations , which at @xmath204 probe the aromatic - dominated sed region , will overpredict  and sfr compared to far - ir measurements if the relationship of local sed templates to  is assumed for the calculation of the bolometric and k@xmath148corrections .    following the @xcite result that  can serve as a good predictor for the appropriate sed of star - forming galaxies , we construct a new 24 @xmath1 single - band  and sfr indicator for star - forming galaxies at redshift @xmath146 .",
    "the resulting @xmath205 dex average agreement ( 0.13 dex scatter ) between  estimates from the new single - band 24 @xmath1 indicator and those from multi - band far - ir sed fitting support the @xcite result that  is indeed the dominant factor affecting the sed shapes of star - forming galaxies .    for the purpose of estimating  and sfr , we recommend using the new indicator at @xmath146 .",
    "a step - by - step recipe is given in section [ sec : final_sfr ] .",
    "the new indicator converges with that of @xcite for local and low @xmath8 galaxies ( section [ sec : discuss_sfmodes ] ) .",
    "but unlike the @xcite indicator , the new indicator carries the extended structure assumption and could underestimate  for the minority of cases ( @xmath110 ) of high-@xmath8 starbursts that are compact ( figures [ compare_lir_cdfs ] and [ compare_lir_hdfn ] ) .",
    "thus , if an object is known _ a priori _ to be a compact starburst ( e.g. , from high - resolution optical or interferometric radio observations ) , we recommend readers to apply the bolometric correction factor given by @xcite in their equation 14 . on the other hand , where the structure of the star - forming region is not known _ a priori _ , we quote an overall scatter of 0.13 dex , when agns are identified and excluded from the sample using x - ray and @xmath4 @xmath1 ( i.e. _ spitzer_/irac ) observations .",
    "we thank daniel eisenstein for insightful discussions , and j. d. smith for the l@xmath206  data .",
    "this work is supported by contract 1255094 from caltech / jpl to the university of arizona .",
    "wr gratefully acknowledges the support from the thai government scholarship .",
    "since the _ herschel _ pacs and spire source extraction procedure is designed to yield a sample for the fiducial  estimates to test the new indicator , an emphasis is given to achieving an unbiased sample , rather than maximizing the number of detectable sources .",
    "to this end , we develop a figure of merit ( fom ) and criteria by which we exclude potentially blended objects .",
    "this is important to mitigate the cases of intervening objects contributing additional flux to the object of interest .",
    "the fom is defined in an unbiased manner based on the 24 @xmath1 prior catalog by @xmath207\\ ] ] where r@xmath208 is the ratio of the 24 @xmath1 flux of the prior object to the 24 @xmath1 fluxes of other nearby objects within the radius ( 9.1  ) of spire 250 @xmath1 beam from the prior and @xmath209 is the distance from the prior object to the corresponding nearby objects .",
    "the 250 @xmath1 beam is chosen for this criteria because it is the band at which most of our ecdfs and hdfn samples are detected .",
    "the normalizations for r@xmath208 and @xmath209 are chosen such that the fom increases rapidly if other sources that are expected to be in the beam could be in within the same spire pixel ( 6  ) or could have comparable spire fluxes to the object at the prior position .",
    "the r@xmath208 normalization value is determined by inspecting the variation of the ratios of 24 and 250 @xmath1 fluxes for sed templates in the @xcite library , which gives a @xmath1374@xmath104 variation .",
    "that is , if the 24 @xmath1 flux of a nearby object is less than @xmath210 that of the prior object , it is unlikely that its 250 @xmath1 flux will be comparable to the prior ( and hence cause a blending problem ) at redshift @xmath75 , assuming the @xcite sed shape .",
    "we emphasize that the exclusion does not depend sensitively on the normalizations in the fom , and we have adopted a conservative rejection threshold by excluding objects with fom @xmath211 from the final catalog , rejecting only the most likely blended objects .",

    "<S> herschel _ in the extended _ chandra _ deep field south ( ecdfs ) and _ hubble _ deep field north ( hdfn ) , as well as  measured from stacked far - ir observations at redshift @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> agns were excluded using x - ray and @xmath4 @xmath1 observations , which are generally available in deep cosmological survey fields . </S>",
    "<S> the gaussian fits to the distribution of the discrepancies between the  measurements from single - band 24 @xmath1 and _ herschel _ observations in the ecdfs and hdfn samples have @xmath5 dex , with @xmath6 of objects disagreeing by more than 0.2 dex . </S>",
    "<S> since the 24 @xmath1 estimates are based on seds for extended galaxies , this agreement suggests that @xmath7 of ir galaxies at high @xmath8 are indeed much more physically extended than local counterparts of similar , consistent with recent independent studies of the fractions of galaxies forming stars in the _ main - sequence _ and _ starburst _ modes , respectively . because we have not introduced empirical corrections to enhance these estimates , in principle , our method should be applicable to lower luminosity galaxies </S>",
    "<S> this will enable use of the 21 @xmath1 band of the mid - infrared instrument ( miri ) on board the _ jwst _ to provide an extremely sensitive tracer of obscured sfr in individual star - forming galaxies across the peak of the cosmic star formation history . </S>"
