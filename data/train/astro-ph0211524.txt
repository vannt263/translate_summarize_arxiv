    "recent studies ( jrgensen et  al .  2002 ; schier et  al .  2002 ; shirley et  al .  2002 ) have suggested that the inner envelopes of low - mass protostars are dense ( @xmath3@xmath4 ) and warm ( @xmath5k ) , as would be expected from scaling of high - mass protostars ( ceccarelli et  al .",

    "2000 ; schier et  al .",
    "2002 ) shows that the abundances of some molecules , e.g. h@xmath0co and ch@xmath6oh , are drastically increased in the warm and dense inner region of the circumstellar envelope .",
    "the location where this increase occurs is consistent with the radius at which ices are expected to thermally evaporate off the grains ( @xmath7k ) .",
    "however , the small spatial scale of the region of hot gas ( @xmath8au ) and the infalling nature of the envelope lead to very different chemical time scales between low mass and high mass hot cores , which may prevent production of second - generation complex molecules in low mass protostars .",
    "also , shocks are thought to be relatively more important in low mass protostars .",
    "high angular resolution observations are needed to pinpoint the origin of the abundance enhancements and possibly distinguish these two scenarios .",
    "we present here observations of h@xmath0co at 1 mm using the owens valley radio observatory ( ovro ) millimeter array at @xmath9 resolution . the line ratio of the two h@xmath0co lines observed is a measure of the gas temperature .",
    "iras 162932422 was observed using the ovro millimeter array between september 2000 and march 2002 . the continuum emission at 1.37 mm was obtained simultaneously with the h@xmath0co @xmath10 and @xmath11 line emission at 218.222 and 218.475ghz , respectively .",
    "was observed in the l and e configurations .",
    "the natural weighted continuum observations has a 1@xmath12 noise of about 20mjybeam@xmath13 with a beam size of 3@xmath149@xmath151@xmath149 .",
    "in fig .  [ h2co ] the 221.7ghz ( 1.37 mm ) continuum emission observed toward iras 162932422 is presented . as expected for this proto - binary star ,",
    "two continuum sources are detected , separated by approximately @xmath16 with faint extended emission also present .",
    "the total observed continuum flux density at 1.37 mm is about 3.5jy .",
    "this is roughly 50% of the flux obtained by walker et  al .",
    "( 1990 ) from mapping with a single dish telescope , indicating that the interferometer resolves out some of the emission .",
    "the positions of the continuum sources are consistent with the two 3 mm sources mm1 ( southeast ) and mm2 ( northwest ) found by mundy et  al .",
    "( 1992 ) . at the distance of iras 162932422 ( 160pc ) the projected separation of the sources is about @xmath17au .",
    "the sources are unresolved and the fitted sizes in the @xmath18-plane of mm1 and mm2 provide upper limits to the sizes of these disks of @xmath1au in diameter .",
    "the total fluxes estimated for the compact components mm1 and mm2 are 0.7jy and 1.1jy , respectively .",
    "the remaining 1.7jy of emission is attributed to the contribution from an extended circumbinary envelope . assuming the emission to be optically thin and adopting a dust temperature of 40k sets lower limits to the masses of 0.25 and 0.4m@xmath19 , respectively .",
    "schier et al .  (",
    "2002 ) determined the circumstellar structure of iras 162932422 from detailed modelling of the observed continuum emission .",
    "in addition to the sed , resolved images at 450 and 850@xmath20 m obtained with the scuba bolometer array at the jcmt were used to constrain the large scale envelope structure . in order to investigate",
    "if the brightness distribution at 1.37 mm from the envelope model is consistent with the flux picked up by the interferometer , the same @xmath18 sampling was applied to the model output .",
    "furthermore , the interferometer data constrain the envelope structure at smaller scales ( @xmath21 ) than the jcmt single - dish data ( @xmath22 ) . in fig .",
    "[ cont_vis ] the visibility amplitudes of the observed emission are compared to the model predictions .",
    "fitting just two compact sources underestimates the flux at small baselines , indicating additional large scale emission .",
    "addition of the best fit envelope model of schier et al .",
    "( 2002 ) produces the correct amount of flux at the smaller baselines but provides too much emission at intermediate baselines ( @xmath23 ) , i.e. , at scales of the binary separation .",
    "it is found that an envelope model that is void of material on scales smaller than the binary separation best reproduces the observed visibilities .",
    "the emission from the two unresolved components , possibly accretion disks , is estimated to contribute @xmath24% to the total flux at 1.37 mm .",
    "the observed h@xmath0co ( @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) line emission obtained at ovro is shown in fig .",
    "the emission is clearly resolved and shows a @xmath25 separation between the red ( @xmath26kms@xmath13 ) and blue ( @xmath27kms@xmath13 ) emission peaks .",
    "the direction of the red - blue asymmetry is roughly perpendicular to the large scale co outflow associated with mm1 ( walker et  al .",
    "1988 ) and is indicative of an overall rotation of the material encompassing both mm1 and mm2 .",
    "the emission from both lines peaks close to the positions of mm1 and mm2 .",
    "the ( @xmath10)/(@xmath11 ) line ratio is sensitive to the temperature of the emitting gas ( e.g. , van dishoeck et  al .",
    "1995 ) , and is @xmath28 close to the positions of mm1 and mm2 indicating hot ( @xmath29k ) gas . single - dish observations ( van dishoeck et  al .  1995 ; schier et  al .",
    "2003 , in prep . )",
    "show that the h@xmath0co line emission is extended to scales of @xmath30 .",
    "also , the large scale ( @xmath10)/(@xmath11 ) line ratio is @xmath31 , much lower than for the interferometer data , suggesting that a cold ( @xmath32k ) component dominates the single - dish flux .",
    "care has to be taken when interpreting the interferometer maps due to the low sensitivity to weak large scale emission .",
    "a direct comparison between the single - dish spectrum and that obtained from the interferometer observations restored with the single - dish beam is shown in fig .",
    "[ compare ] .",
    "the interferometer picks up only @xmath33% of the single dish flux , suggesting that the extended cold material is resolved out by the interferometer and that a hotter compact component is predominantly picked up .",
    "this is to be expected from the ` jump models ' introduced by schier et al .",
    "( 2002 ) where a steep gradient in abundance needed to be introduced , for a number of molecular species including h@xmath0co , in order to model emission lines probing a wide range of excitation conditions .",
    "simulations where the @xmath18 sampling from the observations has been applied to the best fit h@xmath0co models from schier et al .",
    "( 2002 ) with and without a jump in the abundance show that the ` hot core ' component dominates the flux as seen by the interferometer ( @xmath34% ) .",
    "interferometric continuum observations suggest that the inner parts of the circumbinary envelope around iras 162932422 is relatively void of material on scales smaller than the binary separation ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "the simultaneous h@xmath0co line observations indicate presence of hot and dense gas close to the peak positions of the continuum emission consistent with thermal evaporation of ices in ` hot core ' regions close to the protostars . based on the morphology and line widths little of the observed interferometric emission",
    "is thought to be associated with the known outflow(s ) associated with this source .",
    "additional interferometric data have been obtained for iras 162932422 in a wide range of lines including c@xmath35o , ch@xmath6oh , hcn , n@xmath0h@xmath36 and sio , that will provide additional constraints on the physical and chemical structure in the circumstellar envelope .",
    "whatever their precise origin , the molecules located in the inner envelope of can be incorporated into the growing circumstellar disk(s ) and become part of the material from which planetary bodies are formed .",
