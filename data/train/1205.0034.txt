    "the combinatorial ingredient in the cluster theory is quiver mutation , which leads to the categorification of cluster algebra via quiver representation theory due to buan - marsh - reineke - reiten - todorov in 2005 .",
    "recently , keller spotted a remarkable special case of quiver mutation by adding certain restrictions , known as the green quiver mutation ( definition  [ def : green ] ) ; using which , he obtained results concerning kontsevich - soibelman s noncommutative donaldson - thomas invariant via quantum cluster algebras . inspired by keller @xcite and nagao @xcite , king - qiu @xcite studied the exchange graphs of hearts and clusters in various categories associated to cluster categories , with applications to stability conditions and quantum dilogarithm identities in @xcite .",

    "our second focus is on c - sortable words ( c for coxeter element ) , defined by reading @xcite , who showed bijections between c - sortable words , c - clusters and noncrossing partitions in finite case ( dynkin case ) .",
    "ingalls - thomas extended reading s result in the direction of representation theory and gave bijections between many sets ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the bijection between c - sortable words and finite torsion classes was first generalized by thomas @xcite and also obtained by amiot - iyama - reiten - todorov @xcite via layers for preprojective algebras .",
