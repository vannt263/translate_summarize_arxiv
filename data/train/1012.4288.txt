    "extensive research work has been done on bifeo@xmath2 over the decades because of its magnetoelectric multiferroicity at room temperature.@xcite the linear magnetoelectric coupling originates from striction mediated interaction between polar and magnetic domains.@xcite the bulk bifeo@xmath2 is g - type antiferromagnetic with a spiral of long period (  62 nm ) .",
    "therefore , the magnetostriction is weak which , in turn , gives rise to weak coupling .",
    "the electric polarization is also small ( @xmath35 - 6 @xmath6c/@xmath7 ) in bulk.@xcite it improves ( @xmath355 @xmath6c/@xmath7 ) in thin films due to the strain between substrate and film.@xcite large polarization and magnetization will render bifeo@xmath2 quite useful as a single phase multiferroic compound . in this paper , we show that it is possible to achieve both the aspects - large polarization and magnetization - in nanoscale bifeo@xmath2 ( @xmath35 - 50 nm ) .",
    "we found that intrinsic ferromagnetism develops in nanoscale bifeo@xmath2 with rise in saturation magnetization m@xmath0 , decrease in antiferromagnetic transition point t@xmath1 , and increase in coercive field h@xmath8 .",
    "we also found that the unit - cell off - center displacements of bi and fe ions - which render bifeo@xmath2 ferroelectric - increases monotonically with the decrease in particle size .",
    "the net unit - cell polarization p@xmath0 too , is found be higher in nano - sized particles .",
    "the experiments were carried out on both bulk and nano - sized particles of bifeo@xmath2 .",
    "the nanoparticles of bifeo@xmath2 have been synthesized by sonochemical process where coprecipitation takes place from mixed aqueous solution of metal nitrates within a suitable medium in presence of ultrasonic vibration .",
    "the precipitate was washed in alcohol and dried .",
    "finally , the product was calcined at 350@xmath9 - 450@xmath9c for 2 - 6h .",
    "the sonochemical process was shown to yield nanosized particles of various oxide compounds in the past .",
    "we have separated out finer particles by a centrifuge running at different speeds - 10000 , 12000 , and 15000 rpm .",
    "the variation of heat - treatment temperature and time also yields particles of different sizes . in order to synthesize the bulk sample ,",
    "the calcined powder was compacted in the form of pellets and sintered at  830@xmath9c for 5 - 10h .",
    "the average grain size in the sintered pellet was @xmath100.1@xmath6 m .",
    "the samples have been characterized by studying the x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) patterns at room temperature and from the transmission electron microscopy ( tem ) and high resolution tem .",
    "the electrical resistivity and magnetic measurements were carried out across a temperature range 300 - 900 k. the resistivity of the particles was measured by depositing a coating of the particles on an alumina substrate with gold electrodes printed on it .",
    "the xrd patterns were refined by fullprof ( ver 2.3 ) to determine the structural parameters such as space group , lattice parameters , crystallite size , strain , atom positions , bond lengths and angles etc .",
    "the off - center displacements of bi@xmath11 ( @xmath4 ) and fe@xmath11 ( @xmath5 ) ions have also been calculated as a function of particle size .",
    "the average size of the nanoscale bifeo@xmath2 particles varies from @xmath12 to @xmath350 nm . in fig . 1",
    ", we show a representative tem photograph .",
    "the average size was estimated by image analyzer software image - j .",
    "it is compared with the crystallite size estimated from the rietveld refinement of x - ray diffraction patterns .",
    "both the results corroborate each other .",

    "2a , we show the magnetization versus temperature plot for a few representative samples .",
    "quite evident is the monotonic increase in magnetization with the decrease in particle size .",
    "this observation corroborates earlier observations by us as well as by other authors.@xcite@xmath16@xcite interestingly , the antiferromagnetic transition point t@xmath1 drops significantly with the decrease in particle size : from @xmath3653 k in bulk to @xmath3550 k in particles of average size @xmath35 nm .",
    "dc electrical resistance has also been measured across 300 - 800 k. around t@xmath1 , a distinct feature in the resistance versus temperature plot could be noticed ( data not shown here ) .",
    "t@xmath1 was thus estimated both from the magnetic and electrical measurements . in fig .",
    "2b , the t@xmath1 versus particle size plot is shown .",
    "there is a certain discrepancy between t@xmath1 estimated from magnetic and electrical measurements , especially , in finer particle regime .",
    "this could result from progressive broadening of the transition zone .",
    "we have carried out curie - weiss fitting of the magnetization data in the paramagnetic regime ( fig .",
    "2a inset ) . with the decrease in particle size",
    ", the weiss constant @xmath17 appears to be switching from negative ( signaling antiferromagnetic order ) to positive ( marking ferromagnetism ) regime .",
    "the degree of frustration @xmath18 = @xmath17/t@xmath1 increases from @xmath31.0 to @xmath31.4 with the decrease in particle size .",
    "this could be because of enhanced geometry - driven frustration in spin ordering within near neighbors in finer particles .",
    "this has been observed in nanosized ferromagnetic particles by others as well.@xcite the curie constant c yields the magnetization to be varying within @xmath30.108 - 0.452 @xmath19/fe for particle size varying within 5 - 50 nm . for the bulk system ,",
    "the magnetization is @xmath30.02 @xmath19/fe .",
    "the room temperature saturation magnetization m@xmath0 and coercivity h@xmath8 are plotted as a function of particle size in fig .",
    "2b . the intrinsic ferromagnetism in nanoscale bifeo@xmath2 results from@xcite ( i ) incomplete spiral of magnetic order in particles of size less than @xmath362 nm , and ( ii ) enhanced strain of the nano - crystals .",
    "+     +    the xrd patterns have been refined by fullprof ( ver 2.3 ) to find out the dependence of non - centrosymmetry of the crystallographic structure on particle size .",
    "in bifeo@xmath2 , the ferroelectric polarization develops primarily because of covalency in bi - o bonds resulting from bi@xmath11 6s@xmath20 lone pair and consequent off - center displacement of bi@xmath11 ions with respect to the near - neighbor oxygen network .",
    "interestingly , the fe@xmath11 ions too occupy non - centrosymmetric positions in spite of jahn - teller distortion within fe@xmath11o@xmath21 octahedra . in fig .",
    "3a , we show the experimental and refined x - ray diffraction patterns for a representative case ( @xmath322 nm particle ) .",
    "following points could be noted in the evolution of the patterns : ( i ) space group changes from r@xmath22c in bulk to lower symmetric r3c in the nanoscale samples ; ( ii ) the strain increases with the decrease in particle size ; ( iii ) the lattice parameters and volume change systematically with particle size . in table - i , we provide the list of structural parameters as a function of particle size : ( i ) lattice parameters , ( ii ) atom positions , ( iii ) bond lengths and angles within a unit cell , and ( iv ) lattice strain . the weighted reliability factor r@xmath23 which defines the goodness of fit between experimental and refined xrd patterns is also shown .",
    "we estimated the off - center displacements of fe@xmath11 and bi@xmath11 ions within a unit cell of bifeo@xmath2 from the atom position data . in bulk",
    "sintered pellet , the @xmath4 and @xmath5 are @xmath31.235 @xmath15 and @xmath30.229 @xmath15 , respectively .",
    "remarkably , both @xmath4 and @xmath5 exhibit monotonic rise as the particle size is reduced ( fig .",
    "3b).@xcite interestingly , in contrast to the results in ref .",
    "8 , we found that while @xmath5 results in polarization along [ 111]@xmath24 @xmath25 [ 001]@xmath26 axis , @xmath4 is oriented in a different direction which gives polarization along all three directions . using the @xmath5 and the component of @xmath4 along [ 111]@xmath24 @xmath25 [ 001]@xmath26 , we estimated the polarization p@xmath0 in a unit cell following the procedure described in ref . 9",
    ". p@xmath0 is plotted in fig . 3b as a function particle size .",
    "it shows that the resultant p@xmath0 of a unit cell increases substantially in nanoscale regime around @xmath328 nm .",
    "it decreases with further decrease in particle size and eventually stabilizes at a value which is much higher than what has been observed in bulk sample @xcite or even in thin films .",
    "@xcite @xmath27 .",
    "of course , the large unit cell polarization may not yield large ferroelectric polarization for the entire nanoparticle .",
    "this is because of the depolarization originated from surface effects ( dead layer ) of a nanoparticle@xcite .",
    "it is necessary to design an appropriate electrode - nanoparticle architecture to cancel out the depolarizing field and thus observe large polarization even across an entire nano - sized particle .",
    "we observe significant improvement in unit cell polarization in nanoscale bifeo@xmath2 .",
    "both the off - center displacements of bi@xmath11 and fe@xmath11 ions increase monotonically with the decrease in particle size .",
    "the nanosized particles also exhibit intrinsic ferromagnetic order .",
    "large magnetostriction resulting from ferromagnetism , possibly , gives rise to striction mediated enhanced ferroelectric polarization in a unit cell .",
    "large ferroelectric polarization and ferromagnetism in nanosized particles will render nanoscale bifeo@xmath2 even more useful than the bulk system for magnetoelectric device applications .",
