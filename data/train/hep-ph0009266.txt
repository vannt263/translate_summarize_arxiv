    "neutrino oscillations between muon and tau neutrinos , which were found recently in the super - kamiokande experiment @xcite , prove the existence of neutrino masses .",
    "this finding does not spoil the standard big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) picture because experimentally interesting neutrino masses for all three flavors @xmath8 , @xmath9 , are small @xmath10 ev , in comparison to typical bbn temperatures @xmath11 mev . as for oscillations between active flavors ,",
    "these do not play any role in bbn because all active flavors are equally populated .",
    "however , if sterile neutrinos exist , oscillations between active and sterile states could have significant consequences for bbn .",
    "one possibility is that the total energy density of the universe is changed due to excited sterile neutrinos ; together with a recent analysis of observational data @xcite , which claims that the effective number of neutrinos can not exceed @xmath12 , this effect can be used to exclude some region of the @xmath13 parameter plane e.g.  for heavy sterile neutrinos @xcite .",
    "another possible influence of sterile neutrinos on bbn arises from the fact that @xmath14-@xmath15 oscillations can create a large asymmetry between @xmath14 and @xmath16 which would have a direct impact on the @xmath2-@xmath3 reactions and thus change the light element abundances .",
    "this case is interesting for small negative @xmath17 and small @xmath18 , and the important result will be the value of the electron neutrino asymmetry at the freeze - out of the @xmath2/@xmath3 ratio at a temperature around 1 mev .",
    "actually , the magnitude of @xmath14 asymmetry at @xmath19 is just an indicator for possible consequences on bbn . for accurate calculations one would need to use exact non - equilibrium distribution functions of @xmath14 and @xmath16 in the neutron - proton reactions .",
    "a general discussion of this subject can be found in section 2.1 of @xcite , and details in case of large asymmetry in @xcite .",
    "in early works with simplified calculations it was found that the asymmetry could not reach large final values @xcite .",
    "however , later it was found that the asymmetry can increase significantly and reach values @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "this finding was confirmed by elaborate numerical calculations @xcite .",
    "a main feature of these results was that the asymmetry grows according to the power law @xmath21 .",
    "a contradictory result that the power law was @xmath22 was suggested in @xcite , but was found to be erroneous in @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we investigate the evolution of the lepton asymmetry under the assumption that all active neutrinos passing the resonance are converted to sterile neutrinos , thus forming a fermi - dirac distribution in the sterile sector .",
    "this assumption is correct in the case of pure mikheyev - smirnov - wolfenstein ( msw ) transition @xcite , i.e.  when one can neglect the collision - integral terms .",
    "although the assumption of full conversion from active to sterile states may be too strong for certain models , our result does present the maximum possible asymmetry .",
    "the advantage of our approach is that we do not solve any differential equations .",
    "thus , our approach is extremely simple and safe .",
    "furthermore , we consider the effects of various simplifications and compare our results with previous works , in particular with @xcite .",
    "finally , we investigate how the maximum amplitude of the asymmetry at the temperature 1 mev depends on initial conditions and @xmath5 , and compare it with a more detailed calculation , @xcite .",
    "we are considering neutrino oscillations in the early universe at temperatures around @xmath23 . in this epoch ,",
    "the universe is a homogeneous and isotropic plasma , and the expansion is described by the hubble parameter , h =  , where @xmath24 is the planck mass .",
    "the total energy density is _",
    "tot = g_t^4  , where @xmath25 is the number of effective degrees of freedom during the epoch of interest .",
    "we also suppose that @xmath26 , which is a good approximation for the models we are considering here .",
    "the neutrino oscillations are described by the density matrix formalism , see for instance @xcite .",
    "however , we will mainly be interested in the resonance condition , which for @xmath27 oscillations is given by @xcite = - v_eff^a = - ( c_1 g_f t^3 + c_2^a ) , [ rescond ] where @xmath28 specifies the type of active neutrino , @xmath29 is the mass squared difference , @xmath30 is the mixing angle , and @xmath31 is the effective potential .",
    "the `` @xmath32 '' signs refer to neutrinos and anti - neutrinos , respectively .",
    "furthermore , @xmath33 gev@xmath34 is the fermi coupling constant , @xmath35 is the fine structure constant , @xmath36 , @xmath37 for @xmath38-@xmath15 mixing , @xmath39 for @xmath40-@xmath15 and @xmath41 is the temperature of the plasma . sometimes we will use the notation @xmath42 . finally , the effective asymmetry is @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the neutrino asymmetry of the active species a , and @xmath45 is some small fermion asymmetry from all other fermion species . for our analysis",
    "it is only interesting that @xmath45 is of order of the baryon asymmetry , @xmath46 .",
    "because the temperature is much larger then the neutrino masses , not only neutrino momentum and energy are equal , @xmath47 , but also that a certain neutrino mode evolves with constant @xmath48 .",
    "we will therefore use this dimensionless variable instead of momentum and energy , so @xmath49 .",
    "we briefly discuss the evolution of the neutrino densities for small mixing angles , @xmath50 , looking at @xmath14 for definiteness .",
    "let us first sketch the reason why the lepton asymmetry can change at all .",
    "due to the mixing of @xmath14 with @xmath51 , the number densities of the @xmath14 and @xmath52 can alter .",
    "the sterile neutrinos that are thus created have no effect on @xmath1 . now if @xmath53 initially , the resonance condition for the @xmath14 and @xmath16 will be different .",
    "therefore their number densities will change differently , thereby changing @xmath1 . thus neutrino mixing works as a back - reaction on @xmath1 .",
    "the actual change in asymmetry and density takes place close to the resonance momentum , which is defined by eq .",
    "( [ rescond ] ) , y_res= k_1  , [ yres ] where k_1=    k_2=  .",
    "there are three different stages of lepton asymmetry evolution . during the first stage",
    "the asymmetry is so small that the @xmath54 terms can be neglected in eq .",
    "( [ yres ] ) .",
    "the neutrinos and the anti - neutrinos simultaneously pass through the resonance .",
    "furthermore , any initial asymmetry decreases due to the negative back - reaction .",
    "the second stage is the stage of exponential growth of the lepton asymmetry , which occurs when the back - reaction becomes positive . here",
    ", the resonance conditions for @xmath55 and @xmath56 are rapidly driven apart .",
    "for definiteness , we will assume that the created asymmetry is positive , @xmath57 .",
    "then @xmath58 for the @xmath55 increases to very high momenta where the fermi distribution is negligible , the resonance momentum for @xmath56 decreases to small momenta @xmath59 . at the same time",
    ", the asymmetry grows many orders of magnitude and reaches values of order of @xmath60 .    in the third stage",
    "the lepton asymmetry grows at a slower rate .",
    "there has been a lot of controversy on this subject , and it has often be proposed that the lepton asymmetry would grow according to an approximate power law , @xmath61 , where @xmath62-@xmath63 .    we will now show that any power law is only an approximation to the true asymmetry growth .",
    "our considerations start at the end of the exponential regime , which happens at temperature @xmath64 .",
    "the important variables are the asymmetry @xmath65 and the resonance momentum @xmath66 at this time . for definiteness",
    ", we will assume @xmath67 , so that we can safely neglect @xmath55 oscillations ( with @xmath68 we could neglect @xmath56 ) .",
    "the resonance momentum is governed by two effects : it decreases for increasing @xmath1 and increases for decreasing @xmath41 . at the end of the exponential regime , these two effects compensate each other , so that at first the resonance momentum changes very slowly .",
    "this plus the fact that collisional damping is small may let us assume that the momentum modes passing the resonance in the regime of slow asymmetry growth will fully excite the sterile sector . for negligible collisional damping ,",
    "this is exactly the msw effect @xcite .",
    "the full excitation of the sterile sector at resonance has also been stated in @xcite .",
    "we can now calculate the asymmetry for a given temperature @xmath69 : ( t)=_i + _ y_i^y_res(t)dy y^2 f_eq(y , )  .",
    "[ resint ] here , @xmath70 is the equilibrium fermi distribution function , given by f_eq(y,)=  , [ feq ] where @xmath71 is the dimensionless chemical potential for the active neutrinos . for @xmath72 and large temperatures @xmath73 ,",
    "the chemical potential is approximately @xmath74 .",
    "therefore , we can safely neglect it .",
    "we will discuss its influence for large @xmath1 later on .",
    "we should mention that @xmath75 has its origin in an already weakly excited sterile sector at momenta @xmath76 .",
    "however , the correction to eq .",
    "( [ resint ] ) from this excitation is negligible",
    ".    we can now insert eq .",
    "( [ yres ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ resint ] ) and solve the equation for @xmath77 .",
    "the resulting equation only depends on the input parameters @xmath75 and @xmath78 , and on the neutrino parameter @xmath5 .",
    "interestingly , the equation is independent of the mixing angle @xmath79 , a fact which stems from the full transition assumption .",
    "the result has another striking feature : even if the sterile sector is not fully excited during resonance , which happens if the resonance momentum changes too fast and/or the collisional damping is important , our result still gives the maximally possible asymmetry at temperature @xmath41 .    for small momenta , the fermi - dirac distribution can be approximated by @xmath80 . then eq .",
    "( [ resint ] ) simplifies to ( t)-_i = (y_res^3(t)-y_i^3 )  .",
    "furthermore , for large asymmetries and small temperatures , the @xmath81 term in eq .",
    "( [ yres ] ) is much smaller than the @xmath54 term , so that y_res  . [ late_res ] [ yresapp ] then ^4 + ^3 ( y_i^3- _",
    "i ) = ()^3  .",
    "[ eta4 ] this equation can be easily solved in two limits : when @xmath82 we can neglect the first term on the lhs so that we obtain a @xmath83 power law . however , when @xmath84 the solution is @xmath85 .",
    "thus the power law will slowly change in time .",
    "this is also what we expect from the following considerations : the asymmetry is created close to the resonance momentum .",
    "however , when the sterile sector is fully excited at this momentum , the asymmetry can no longer be created .",
    "naturally , when @xmath1 does not change , the resonance momentum will increase due to the decreasing temperature .",
    "thus we expect a slowly increasing resonance momentum . from eq .",
