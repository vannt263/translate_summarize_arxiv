    "quantum states which differ only by a overall phase can not be distinguished by measurements in quantum mechanics .",
    "hence phases were thought to be unimportant until berry made an important and interesting observation regarding the behavior of pure quantum systems in a slowly changing environment @xcite .",
    "the adiabatic theorem makes sure that , if a system is initially in an eigenstate of the instantaneous hamiltonian , it remains so . when the environment ( more precisely , the hamiltonian ) returns to it s initial state after undergoing slow changes , the system acquires a measurable phase , apart from the well known dynamical phase , which is purely of geometric origin @xcite .",
    "simon@xcite showed this to be a consequence of parallel transport in a curved space appropriate to the quantum system .",
    "berry s phase was reconsidered by aharanov and anandan , who shifted the emphasis from changes in the environment , to the motion of the pure quantum system itself and found that the for all the changes in the environment , the same geometric phase is obtained which is uniquely associated with the motion of the pure quantum system and hence enabled them to generalize berry s phase to non - adiabatic motions @xcite . for a spin half particle subjected to a magnetic field @xmath1 ,",
    "the non adiabatic cyclic aharanov - anandan phase is just the solid angle determined by the path in the projective hilbert space @xcite .",
    "yet another interesting discovery in the fundamentals of quantum physics was the observation that by accessing a large hilbert space spanned by the linear combination of quantum states and by intelligently manipulating them , some of the problems intractable for classical computers can be solved efficiently @xcite .",
    "this idea of quantum computation using coherent quantum mechanical systems has excited a number of research groups @xcite .",
    "various physical systems including nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) are being examined to built a suitable physical device which would perform quantum information processing and quantum simulations @xcite .",
    "also , the quantum correlation inherently present in the entangled quantum states was found to be useful for quantum computation , communication and cryptography @xcite .",
    "geometric quantum computing is a way of manipulating quantum states using quantum gates based on geometric phase shifts @xcite .",
    "this approach is particularly useful because of the built - in fault tolerance , which arises due to the fact that geometric phases depend only upon some global geometric features and it is robust against certain errors and dephasing @xcite .    in nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) ,",
    "the acquisition of geometric phase by a spin was first verified by pines et.al.@xcite in adiabatic regime by subjecting a nuclear spin to an effective magnetic field which slowly sweeps a cone .",
    "a similar approach was adopted by jones et.al . to demonstrate the construction of controlled phase shift gates in a two - qubit system using adiabatic geometric phase @xcite .",
    "pines et.al .",
    "also studied the geometric phase in non - adiabatic regime , namely the aharanov - anandan phase by nmr @xcite .",
    "they used a system of two dipolar coupled identical proton spins which form a three level system .",
    "a two level subsystem was made to undergo a cyclic evolution in the hilbert space by applying a time - dependent magnetic field , while geometric phase was observed in the modulation of the coherence of the other two - level subsystem @xcite .",
    "recently , non - adiabatic geometric phase has also been observed for mixed states by nmr using evolution in tilted hamiltonian frame @xcite . in the work reported here ,",
    "we have adopted a scheme similar to that of pines et.al .",
    "@xcite to demonstrate construction of controlled phase shift gates in a two - qubit system using non - adiabatic geometric phase by nmr .",
    "the scheme is easily scalable to higher qubit systems .",
    "the geometric controlled phase gates were used to implement deutsch - jozsa ( dj ) algorithm @xcite and grover s search algorithm @xcite in the two - qubit system . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "this is the first implementation of quantum algorithms using geometric phase .",
    "consider a two qubit system , which has four eigenstates @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the two - state subsystem of @xmath4 and @xmath5 can be taken through a circuit enclosing a solid angle @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "if the other dynamical phases are canceled during the process , these two states gain a non - adiabatic phase purely due to geometric topology .",
    "since the operation is done selectively with the states where first qubit is in state @xmath7 , this acts as a controlled phase gate where the second qubit gains a phase only when the first qubit is @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the transport of the selected states through a closed circuit can be accomplished by selective excitation .",
    "such selective excitation can be performed by pulses having a small bandwidth which excite a selected transition in the spectrum and leave the others unaffected @xcite . in the following",
    "we consider geometric phase acquired by two different paths in a bloch sphere , respectively known as slice circuit and triangular circuit @xcite .      in a slice circuit ,",
    "the state vector cuts a slice out of the bloch sphere , figure 1(a ) .",
    "the slice circuit can be achieved by two pulses a.b=@xmath8 .",

    "however , the phase it attributed only to the two states where first qubit is in state @xmath0 . since the selective excitation does not perturb the other transitions , the subsystem @xmath19 do not gain any phase , this is analogous to the controlled phase gate where the second qubit acquires a phase controlled by the state of first qubit @xcite .    to demonstrate the operation of a controlled geometric phase gate ,",
    "we have taken the two qubit system of carbon-13 labeled chloroform ( @xmath20chcl@xmath21 ) , where the two nuclear spins @xmath20c and @xmath22h forms the two - qubit system .",
    "the sample of @xmath20chcl@xmath21 was dissolved in the solvent of cdcl@xmath21 , and experiments were performed at room temperature at a magnetic field of b@xmath23=11.2 tesla . at this high - field",
    "the resonance frequency of proton is 500 mhz and that of carbon is 125 mhz .",
    "the indirect spin - spin coupling ( the j - coupling ) between the two qubits is 210 hz .",
    "starting from equilibrium , the @xmath2 pseudopure state was prepared by spatial averaging method using the pulse sequence @xcite , @xmath24 where the pulses were applied on the second qubit , denoted by @xmath25 in superscript , which in our case is the proton spin .",
    "after creation of pps , a pseudo - hadamard gate @xcite was applied on the first qubit , which in our case was @xmath20c .",
    "the pseudo - hadamard gate was implemented by a @xmath26 where the superscript denotes the qubit and the subscript denotes the phase of the pulse @xcite .",
    "this gate creates a an uniform superposition of the first qubit @xmath27 .",
    "the operation of the controlled phase gate would now transform the state into @xmath28 . for the slice circuit ,",
    "the proton dynamical phase would vanish since the applied field is always orthogonal to the polarization vector , generating parallel transport @xcite .",
    "however , the carbon coherence would undergo evolution due to the internal hamiltonian during the pulses .",
    "hence the pulse sequence of the gate was incorporated into a hahn - echo @xcite sequence of the form @xmath29 , where the pulse sequence of the gate were applied during the second @xmath30 period , as given in figure 1(b ) .",
    "the intermediate @xmath31-pulse refocuses inhomogeneity of the b@xmath23 field , the chemical shift of carbon and its j - coupling to the proton . however , to restore the state of the first qubit altered by the @xmath31-pulse , the pulse sequence of eq .",
    "[ 1 ] has to be supplemented by adding a @xmath32 pulse ( figure 1(b ) ) , yielding the sequence : @xmath33 where the selective pulses were applied on the @xmath19 transition to achieve the exact form of controlled phase gate .",
    "the selective excitation was obtained with gaussian shaped pulses of 13.2 ms duration .",
    "the non - adiabatic geometric phase was observed in the phase of @xmath34 coherence .",
    "we have observed the geometric phase for the slice circuit with various solid angles @xmath35 , each time varying the phase @xmath14 of the second selective @xmath31-pulse .",
    "the corresponding spectra are given in figure 2(c ) , where the @xmath34 shows a phase change of @xmath36 .",
    "for @xmath37 , there is no phase change and the peak is absorptive . with increase of @xmath14 , the phase of the peak changes and",
    "it becomes dispersive for @xmath38 , and subsequently , a negative absorptive for @xmath39 .",
    "the three small lines in the spectra comes from the naturally abundant @xmath20c signal of cdcl@xmath21 , which provide a reference .",
    "since all dynamical phases due to evolution under chemical shift and j - couplings were refocused , the solvent @xmath20c signal is absorptive in all the spectra .",
    "however , solute @xmath20c signal gains phase because it is coupled to the protons , one of whose transition is taken through a closed circuit .",
    "this result thus provides a graphic display of geometric phase by non - adiabatic evolution . to accurately read the phase angle of each spectrum in fig .",
    "2(c ) , a zero - order phase correction was applied to the spectra in fig .",
    "2(c ) , till the observed peak became absorptive .",
    "the change of phase of @xmath34 coherence due to geometric phase is plotted against the solid - angle ( 2@xmath14 ) , in figure 3 .",
    "the graph in figure 3 shows the high fidelity of the experimental implementation of the slice circuit in this case .      in the triangular circuit , the state vector traverses a triangular path on the bloch sphere figure 1(c ) @xcite .",
    "the solid angle enclosed by the triangular circuit of figure 1(c ) is @xmath14 .",
    "the controlled phase shift gate can be implemented by the non - adiabatic phase acquired when the appropriate sub - system goes through this circuit . the pulse sequence for the circuit and the corresponding operator",
    "can be calculated , similar to that of the sliced circuit , as @xmath40 the intermediate @xmath41 pulse can be applied by the composite z - pulse sequence @xmath42 @xcite .    in the experiments , we have chosen @xmath43 .",
    "the state of @xmath27 was prepared and then the pulse sequence of figure 1(d ) was applied .",
    "similar to the slice circuit , the sequence was incorporated in a hahn - echo and the pulses were applied on the @xmath19 transition .",
    "the operator of eq.[5 ] transforms @xmath27 to @xmath44 .",
    "the phase of the @xmath34 was observed for various @xmath14 , by changing the angle of the z - pulse and the phase of the last pulse in eq.[5 ] .",
    "the spectra are given in figure 4 .",
    "once again , the peak changes from absorptive to dispersive and then to a negative absorptive in correspondence with the change of @xmath14 .",
    "however , there are two major differences between the spectra of figure 2(c ) and 4(c ) .",
    "note that after the phase gate , the state of the system is @xmath45 for slice circuit and @xmath44 for triangular circuit .",
    "this is because the solid angle of the slice circuit if 2@xmath14 , whereas that of the triangular circuit is @xmath14 .",
    "hence , in the slice circuit the coherences become a negative absorptive for @xmath39 , whereas in the triangle circuit the same observation is obtained for @xmath46 .",
    "moreover , the phase of the pulses corresponding to the triangle circuit is chosen such that the sign of phase is opposite to that of the slice circuit .",
    "this difference is clearly reflected in the sign of the coherences between figure 2(c ) and 4(c ) . a plot of the absolute value of observed phase change against solid angle is given in figure 5 , whose high fidelity validate the use of such gates for quantum computing .",
    "deutsch - jozsa ( dj ) algorithm provides a demonstration of the advantage of quantum superpositions over classical computing @xcite .",
    "the dj algorithm determines the type of an unknown function when it is either constant or balanced . in the simplest case",
    ", @xmath47 maps a single bit to a single bit .",
    "the function is called constant if @xmath47 is independent of @xmath48 and it is balanced if @xmath47 is zero for one value of @xmath48 and unity for the other value . for n qubit system , @xmath49 is constant if it is independent of @xmath50 and balanced if it is zero for half the values of @xmath50 and unity for the other half .",
    "classically it requires ( @xmath51 ) function calls to check if @xmath49 is constant or balanced .",
