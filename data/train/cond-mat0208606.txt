    "the mean - field gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) theory @xcite has been quite successful in explaining both static and dynamic properties @xcite of bose - einstein condensates ( bec ) produced in alkali atoms @xcite .",
    "the reason for the success of the gp theory is mainly the satisfaction of dilute gas condition @xmath0 ( where @xmath1 is atomic density , @xmath2 is the s - wave scattering length of interatomic potential and the parameter @xmath3 is called the gas parameter ) in the above mentioned experiments .",
    "typically the values of gas parameter in these experiments were in the range of @xmath4 .",
    "the gas parameter can have a large value when the number of atoms @xmath5 in the condensate or the scattering length is large .",
    "thus in the later experiments reported in refs .",
    "@xcite @xmath5 was of the order of @xmath6 and the corresponding value of gas parameter was @xmath7 .",
    "on the other hand , in a very recent experiment @xcite the maximum value of the peak gas parameter was @xmath8 ( @xmath9 is the peak density of the condensate ) although the condensate contained only @xmath10 @xmath11 rb atoms . in this experiment",
    "the scattering length @xmath2 could be varied continuously from a negative to a very large positive value by exploiting the fesbach resonance .",
    "these kind of condensates , then , naturally raise the question about the validity of the mean - field gp approach .",
    "theoretical investigations of the effects of going beyond the gp ( bgp ) theory have already been reported in the literature @xcite .",
    "recently @xcite ground - state properties of bec with large values of gas parameter ( as achieved in the experiments @xcite ) have been theoretically studied to assess the accuracy of the gp theory .",
    "it has been shown that for large values of the gas parameter ( @xmath12 @xmath13 ) the total energy and the chemical potential are modified significantly by the bgp theory .",
    "it is well known that these changes are also reflected in the frequencies of collective excitations which can be measured with a greater accuracy .",
    "therefore , by measuring the frequencies of collective excitations it should be possible to observe the effect of the bgp theory . this has motivated us to calculate the corrections to the frequencies of collective oscillations due to the bgp theory .",
    "we focus our attention on the condensates with values of gas parameters , spanning a range similar to that achieved in the experiment @xcite and make an assessment of the accuracy of the gp theory in predicting the frequencies of collective oscillations of such condensates .    in the past corrections to the frequencies of collective oscillations of trapped bosons arising due to the bgp theory",
    "have been estimated @xcite within the thomas - fermi ( tf ) approximation which is valid in the large @xmath5 limit ( more precisely when @xmath14 is satisfied , where @xmath15 is the characteristic length of trapping potential and it is defined in the next section ) . in the aforesaid references corrections to the frequencies",
    "were obtained by solving the time - dependent second - order differential equation perturbatively for the density .",
    "thus the analytical expressions for the fractional change in the frequencies are correct only up to the first order in @xmath16 .",
    "it is , then , expected that these expressions for the corrections will not be accurate in the large - gas - parameter regime , as achieved in the recent experiment @xcite . in this paper",
    "we also derive an analytical expression for the correction within the tf approximation by making use of the sum - rule approach .",
    "we find that the expression for the correction obtained by us is valid for somewhat larger range of gas parameters than those of refs .",
    "as expected , for very small gas parameters the expression derived by us correctly reduces to those of refs .",
    "we will return to the question of validity of these analytical results later .",
    "it is well known that the tf approximation does not reproduce the surface region of density profile of trapped condensates accurately @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the collective oscillation frequencies characterizing the response properties of the trapped gas crucially depend on the tail or the surface region of the density profile @xcite .",
    "therefore , it becomes necessary to go beyond the tf approximation especially for the calculation of frequencies of collective oscillations @xcite . to accomplish this task",
    "we make use of well established variational method @xcite to determine the ground - state densities .",
    "the collective oscillation frequencies are then obtained by using the sum - rule approach @xcite of many - body response theory . in the sum - rule approach",
    "the calculation of frequencies requires the knowledge of the ground - state wave function ( or the ground - state density ) of the many - body system only .",
    "therefore the accuracy of frequencies determined by the sum - rule approach depends on the accuracy of the ground - state wave function ( ground - state density ) employed for the calculations .",
    "keeping this in mind our aim is also to obtain reasonably accurate ground - state densities of the trapped condensates . to this end",
    "we employ variational approach by using an energy functional of @xmath5 interacting trapped bosons within the local density approximation ( lda ) along with a judiciously chosen variational ansatz for the ground - state density @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized in the following manner . in section",
    "ii we describe the theoretical method for the calculation of the frequencies of collective oscillations .",
    "section iii contains the analytical estimate of the corrections to the frequencies within the tf approximation , and results of our variational calculation .",
    "the paper is concluded in section iv .",
    "the central quantity in the variational approach is the energy functional for a condensate of @xmath5 bosons , each with mass @xmath17 , confined in a trap potential @xmath18 : @xmath19 = \\int d{\\bf r}\\left [ - \\frac{\\hbar^{2}}{2m}\\sqrt{n({\\bf r})}{\\bf \\nabla}^{2 } \\sqrt{n({\\bf r } ) } + v_{t}({\\bf r})n({\\bf r } ) + \\epsilon(n)n({\\bf r } ) \\right ] , \\label{1}\\ ] ] where , the first , the second , and the third terms represent the kinetic energy of bosons , the energy due to the trapping potential , and the energy due to interatomic correlation within the lda , respectively . following the usual practice we use the perturbative expansion for @xmath20 in terms of the gas parameter @xmath3 , @xmath21 .",
    "\\label{2}\\ ] ] the first term in the above expansion , which corresponds to the energy of the homogenous bose gas within the mean - field theory as considered in the gp theory , was calculated by bogoliubov @xcite .",
    "the second term was obtained by lee , huang and yang ( lhy ) @xcite , while the third term was first calculated by wu @xcite using the hard - sphere model for the interatomic potential .",
    "although , it has been emphasized in the literature that the above expansion is valid only for @xmath0 , it is only recently that the range of validity of above expansion has been systematically investigated by giorgini et al .",
    "they have used diffusion monte carlo ( dmc ) method to calculate the ground - state of uniform gas of bosons interacting through different model potentials with @xmath22 .",
    "it has been found that the expansion ( [ 2 ] ) is valid as long as @xmath23 .",
    "however , for the values of the gas parameter beyond @xmath7 the inclusion of the logarithmic term leads to severe mismatch with the dmc simulation results . on the other hand , expansion ( [ 2 ] ) up to the lhy term gives an accurate representation of the dmc calculations even for the gas parameter of the order of @xmath13 .",
    "consequently , we do not consider the logarithmic term in the expansion ( [ 2 ] ) for all the calculations in this study .",
    "the trapping potential @xmath24 is taken to be axially symmetric characterized by two angular frequencies @xmath25 and @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "it is given by @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the anisotropy parameter of the trapping potential ( @xmath30 corresponds to a spherically symmetric trap ) .",
    "the ground - state properties which are needed to calculate the collective frequencies are determined by minimizing the energy functional ( [ 1 ] ) with respect to the density @xmath31@xcite satisfying the normalization condition @xmath32 to implement the variational scheme we take the ansatz for the ground - state density as @xcite : @xmath33 where @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the variational parameters which are obtained by minimizing @xmath37 $ ] with respect to these parameters . in the above equation",
    "we have used the scaled co - ordinates @xmath38 with @xmath39 .",
    "we note that @xmath40 is normalized to unity and from eq .",
    "( [ norm ] ) it can be seen that @xmath41 we make this choice of variational form for the density as it has been shown convincingly that this ansatz is capable of describing the ground state of bose gas in a trap quite accurately both within @xcite and beyond @xcite the gp theory for a wide range of particle numbers . using this variational form",
    "the physical observables can be expressed analytically in terms of three variational parameters @xcite .",
    "the total energy @xmath42 can be written as @xcite @xmath43 here @xmath44 and @xmath45 denote the average kinetic and the trapping potential energies per particle , respectively .",
    "the term e@xmath46 gives the interaction energy per particle in the mean - field approximation as considered in the gp theory while e@xmath47 gives the correction in the interaction energy due to the lhy term in the expansion ( [ 2 ] ) arising from the bgp theory .",
    "the ground - state energy components obtained from the variational calculation are employed to compute the frequencies of collective oscillations by using the sum - rule approach of many - body response theory . in the following we briefly outline the sum - rule approach and",
    "present some of the results which are relevant for the present work .    according to the basic result of the sum - rule approach @xcite the upper bound of the lowest excitation energy is given by @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the @xmath36-th order moment of the excitation energy associated with the excitation operator",
    "@xmath50 and @xmath51 is the frequency of excitation . here",
    "@xmath52 is the excitation energy of eigenstate @xmath53 of the hamiltonian @xmath54 of the system .",
    "the upper bound given by eq .",
    "( [ 6 ] ) is close to the exact lowest excited state when this state is highly collective , that is , when the oscillator strength is almost exhausted by a single mode .",
    "this condition is satisfied by the trapped bosons in most of the cases . moreover , eq .",
    "( [ 6 ] ) can be used for computation of the excitation energies by exploiting the fact that the moments @xmath55 and @xmath56 can be expressed as expectation values of the commutators between @xmath50 and @xmath54 in the ground state @xmath57 @xcite : @xmath58\\right ] |0\\rangle , \\nonumber \\\\ m_{3 } & = & \\frac{1}{2}\\langle 0|\\left [ \\left [ f^{\\dagger},h\\right ] , \\left [ \\left [ h,[h , f\\right ] \\right ] \\right ]    \\label{7}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the main advantage of the sum - rule approach is that it allows us to calculate the dynamic properties like excitation frequencies of many - body systems with the knowledge of ground state @xmath57 ( or the ground - state density ) only .",
    "thus , with the knowledge of a reasonably accurate ground - state density we calculate the expectation values given in eq.([7 ] ) to determine the frequencies of collective oscillations .",
    "it is worth mentioning that sum - rule approach has been extensively used to calculate collective frequencies of the trapped condensate @xcite .    for the purpose of calculation one needs to choose an appropriate excitation operator @xmath50 . in this paper",
    "we concentrate only on the compressional collective mode characterized by the @xmath59-component of angular momentum index , @xmath60 . for the axially symmetric trap the mode @xmath60 involves coupling of the monopole ( @xmath61 ) and the quadrupole ( @xmath62 ) modes . following kimura et al .",
    "@xcite the operator @xmath50 for the excitation of @xmath60 collective mode is written as @xmath63 where @xmath64 is a parameter characterizing the coupling of the two modes due to the axial symmetry of the trap .",
    "this parameter is obtained by making the excitation energy given by eq.([6 ] ) extremal . here",
    ", we note that @xmath50 given above can also be used to describe excitation of the monopole ( @xmath65 ) and the quadrupole ( @xmath66 ) modes separately .",
    "for spherically symmetric trap ( @xmath30 ) the two modes get decoupled and @xmath67 and @xmath68 correspond to the minimum and the maximum values of the excitation energies , respectively .    using the energy functional given by eq .",

    "\\label{11}\\ ] ] the frequency of collective oscillations is determined by substituting the values of energy components from the variational calculation and making @xmath76 extremal with respect to @xmath64 .",
    "the variation with respect to @xmath64 leads to a quadratic equation in @xmath64 and the two roots , corresponding to the maximum ( @xmath77 ) and the minimum ( @xmath78 ) values of @xmath76 , are @xmath79 with @xmath80 and @xmath81 where @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "in the next section we first apply these results to estimate analytically the correction to the collective frequency due to the lhy term within the tf approximation followed by the results of our variational calculation .",
    "before discussing the results of our variational calculation we present the analytical estimate of collective frequencies within the tf approximation .",
    "we generalize the perturbative results of ref .",
    "@xcite and also discuss the validity regime of these results . for convenience",

    "these expressions are : @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the chemical potential of trapped bosons obtained within the tf approximation @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that the expressions for @xmath95 and @xmath96 given above ( eq .",
    "( [ 15 ] ) ) are approximate in nature and neglect terms of order @xmath101 and , thus , expected to be valid in the small gas parameter regime .",
    "it has been recently shown @xcite that the expressions in eq .",
    "( [ 15 ] ) are not valid for very large gas parameters and lead to results which differ considerably from the exact results . in the large - gas - parameter regime",
    "one needs to solve the nonlinear equation of the density more accurately with the help of numerical methods .",
    "consequently , to compute the frequencies of collective oscillation ( for that matter any observable ) in the large - gas - parameter regime within the tf approximation one needs a non - iterative or non - perturbative method to solve the nonlinear equation . in this paper we take a different route to achieve this goal . instead of solving the time - dependent differential equation for the density ( or the time - dependent gp equation )",
    "we exploit the sum - rule approach of the many - body response theory along with the accurate ground - state density determined variationally to compute the frequencies of collective oscillations .",
    "we describe the results of such a calculation in the next subsection .",
    "now by substituting eq .",
    "( [ 15 ] ) in eq .",
    "( [ 14 ] ) we get following expression for the frequency of the monopole collective mode within the bgp theory : @xmath102^{1/2 } , \\label{16}\\ ] ] where @xmath103 is the angular frequency of the spherically symmetric trap . in the limit of @xmath104 above expression ( eq.([16 ] ) ) correctly reduces to the mean - field result @xmath105 within the tf approximation @xcite .",
    "it is customary to define the fractional change in the frequency as @xcite , @xmath106 by using eq .",
    "( [ 16 ] ) we get @xmath107 in the limit of @xmath108 we recover the results of refs .",
    "@xcite . fig .",
    "1 shows the fractional change @xmath109 as a function of dimensionless parameter @xmath110 ( where @xmath111 is the bohr radius of hydrogen atom ) for @xmath112 @xmath11rb atoms trapped in a spherical trap with @xmath113 , where @xmath114hz and @xmath115hz @xcite .",
    "the values of the parameter @xmath110 are chosen such that the condition for the tf approximation , that is , @xmath14 is satisfied . moreover , as discussed above eq.([15 ] ) ( and hence eq . (",
    "[ 16 ] ) ) is valid only for small gas parameter values and accordingly we have restricted ourselves to @xmath116 .",
    "it is evident from fig.1 that the correction to the monopole frequency due to inclusion of lhy term in the interatomic correlation energy obtained by us is slightly lower than the corresponding results of refs .",
    "in particular for @xmath117 we obtain @xmath118 change in the monopole frequency as compared to the correction of @xmath119 predicted in ref .",
    "it is only for very small values of @xmath120 ( less than @xmath7 ) that fractional corrections obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite match with eq .",
    "( [ 17 ] ) .      before discussing the results for the excitation frequencies obtained by variational method ,",
    "we first demonstrate that this method is capable of yielding sufficiently accurate results for the ground - state properties of bec even for large gas parameter values , as achieved in the experiment of cornish et al . @xcite .",
    "the parameters used in this calculation are similar to the ones used in the previous section .",
    "we present these results in table i and ii for the spherically symmetric and the axially symmetric traps respectively . to check the accuracy ,",
    "we compare our variational results with those of ref .",
    "@xcite ( presented in parenthesis in table i and ii ) obtained by numerically solving the modified gp equation .",
    "the results in table i and ii clearly show that the variational method gives quite accurate results for the ground - state properties as they compare very well with the numbers of ref .",
    "therefore the variational method is indeed suitable for describing the ground - state properties even in the regime of large gas parameters .",
    "the accuracy of our variational results was further checked by verifying that the generalized virial relation as given in eq .",
    "( [ virial ] ) is satisfied .",
    "in all the variational calculations the virial relation was satisfied up to the fifth decimal place or better .",
    "this indicates that not only the total energy but its different components are also obtained accurately by the variational method , which is quite crucial for the calculation of the frequencies of collective oscillations .",
    "now we focus our attention on the results for the frequencies of collective oscillations of trapped bosons",
    "2 and 3 , show the upper ( @xmath121 ) and the lower ( @xmath122 ) frequencies respectively , associated with the breathing mode as a function of the dimensionless parameter @xmath110 .",
    "the results presented in figs .",
    "2 and 3 correspond to the axially symmetric trap which is more relevant from the experimental point of view .",
    "notice that the maximum value of the parameter @xmath110 is chosen to be @xmath10 in accordance with the experimental number @xcite and the corresponding value of the peak gas parameter is @xmath123 . for comparison",
    "we also show in these figures the corresponding results obtained within the gp theory .",
    "it is important to note here that the gp results shown in figs .",
    "2 and 3 are also obtained variationally by dropping the lhy term from the expansion ( [ 2 ] ) and thus , retaining only the first term .",
    "the results corresponding to the gp case obtained by us match quite well with those already reported in the literature @xcite .",
    "it can be clearly seen from fig .",
    "2 that for small values of the gas parameter the numbers obtained within the gp and the bgp theory are quite close .",
    "the difference between these two results , however , increases with @xmath2 .",
    "for example , for @xmath124 the bgp number for @xmath121 is @xmath125 higher than the corresponding mean - field gp result .",
    "thus we conclude that the introduction of lhy term in the interatomic correlation energy results in a significant correction to the upper frequency @xmath121 of @xmath60 mode of the collective oscillations . considering the accuracy of current experiments",
    "@xcite in measuring the frequencies of the collective excitations , it should be possible to observe these corrections experimentally .",
    "it is also important to note that the frequency @xmath121 obtained within the gp theory remains almost constant with the increase in the parameter @xmath110 .",
    "in contrast , the bgp theory predicts @xmath121 growing monotonically with @xmath110 .",
    "therefore a signature of the predictions of the bgp theory can be observed by measuring @xmath110 dependence of the excitation frequency @xmath121 .",
    "next we focus our attention on the lower frequency @xmath122 of the breathing mode which is shown in fig .",
    "3 . for small values of the gas parameter",
    "the frequency of the lower branch obtained via gp theory is very close to the corresponding bgp theory result .",
    "in the same regime of the gas parameter the frequency @xmath122 decreases with the gas parameter both for the gp and the bgp cases .",
    "the decrease of the lower frequency with an increase in the gas parameter value has already been theoretically predicted @xcite and experimentally verified as well @xcite .",
    "however , in contrast to the gp case , frequency of the lower branch for the bgp case starts increasing , albeit slowly , after a critical value of @xmath126 .",
    "it is also noteworthy that the change in the frequency @xmath122 obtained from the bgp theory is considerably lower than that in the upper frequency @xmath121 .",
    "for example , for @xmath112 and @xmath124 the change in the lower frequency is just @xmath127 while that in the upper frequency is @xmath125 .",
    "we conclude this section by making a comparison of the frequencies obtained by using the analytical expression as give in eq .",
    "( [ 16 ] ) with the results obtained by the variational approach .",
    "the comparison is shown in fig .",
    "4 where we plot the frequency of the monopole mode of a condensate in a spherically symmetric trap as a function of @xmath110 obtained using eq .",
    "( [ 16 ] ) ( dashed line ) and using the variational method ( solid line ) .",
    "the range of values of @xmath110 is chosen such that the tf approximation ( i.e. @xmath14 ) is satisfied .",
    "accordingly the minimum value of @xmath110 in fig . 4",
    "is chosen to be @xmath128 which corresponds to @xmath129 .",
    "it can be seen that the results obtained using eq.([16 ] ) are systematically higher than the corresponding results from variational calculation and the difference between the two grows as the value the gas parameter is increased .",
    "moreover , we also note that the two results are reasonably close for values of @xmath110 of the order of 3500 ( @xmath130 ) .",
    "therefore , we emphasize that the correction obtained within the tf approximation as given by eq .",
    "( [ 16 ] ) is valid as long as the gas parameter is of the order of @xmath7 . as discussed earlier , for condensates with the values of the gas parameter beyond @xmath7 one needs to evaluate @xmath95 and @xmath96 in a non - perturbative manner .",
    "the variational approach employed in this paper accomplishes exactly this task .",
    "in this paper we have calculated the frequencies of collective excitation of a trapped condensates in the large - gas - parameter regime using the bgp theory . to go beyond the gp theory we have included a higher - order term ( lhy term ) in the interatomic correlation energy obtained from the ground - state energy of a uniform bose gas .",
    "the calculations of the frequencies were performed by employing the sum - rule approach of many - body response theory along with the variational method to obtain the ground - state energy components .",
    "we have also derived an analytical expression for the corrections to the frequencies of the compressional mode valid for small gas parameters within the tf approximation .",
    "the results of our variational calculations clearly show that for large gas parameter values , the frequencies of the compressional mode characterized by the index @xmath60 are significantly altered .",
    "although the change in the lower branch of @xmath60 mode , @xmath122 , is small , we observe a new qualitative feature . the frequency @xmath122 increases slowly as the gas parameter exceeds a critical value in contrast to a monotonically decrease predicted within the gp theory .",
    "it would be very interesting to verify the predictions of the bgp theory by measuring collective excitation frequencies for condensates with large gas parameter as reported in ref .",
