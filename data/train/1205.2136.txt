    "the presence of energetic particles in the universe has been know for over a century as cosmic rays ( crs ) and for a comparable time as the agents producing non - thermal electromagnetic radiation from long wave radio to gamma - rays . in spite of accumulation of considerable data on spectral and other characteristics of these particles ,",
    "the exact mechanisms of their production remain controversial . although the possible scenarios of acceleration have been narrowed down , there are many uncertainties about the details of individual mechanisms . nowadays",
    "the agents commonly used for acceleration of particles in astrophysical plasmas can be classified in three categories , namely static electric fields ( parallel to magnetic fields ) , shocks and turbulence . as we will try to show there are several lines of argument indicating that turbulence plays an important role in all these scenarios .",
    "in addition , because of the large values of ordinary and magnetic reynolds numbers , most flows in astrophysical plasmas are expected to give rise to turbulence . the generation and evolution ( cascade and damping ) of plasma turbulence in astrophysical sources is an important aspect of particle acceleration that will be dealt with in other papers of this proceedings .",
    "similarly , electric field and shock accelerations will be discussed by other authors in this proceedings as well . in this paper",
    "we discuss particle acceleration by turbulence or plasma waves which is commonly referred to as * stochastic acceleration ( sa for short)*.    fermi ( 1949 ) was the first author to propose sa as a model for production of crs , whereby charged particles of velocity @xmath2 , scattering with a rate @xmath3 in random collisions with moving magnetized clouds of average speed @xmath4 , gain energy at a rate @xmath5 mainly because energy gaining head on collisions are more numerous than energy losing trailing ones . nowadays this class of models are often called _ second order fermi _ process . soon after , several authors proposed plasma waves or magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) turbulence as the scattering agents ( see e.g. sturrock 1966 ; kulsrud & ferarrri 1971 , and references therein ) . in a later paper fermi ( 1954 )",
    "proposed acceleration of particles scattering back and forth between two ends of a contracting magnetic bottle , where the particles gain energy at every scattering so that the acceleration rate is equal to @xmath6 , that is linearly with the velocity ratio , hence the name _ first order fermi_. for particle velocities @xmath7 this is a much faster rate .",
    "it is also well known that a particle crossing a convergent flow , e.g. a shock with velocity @xmath8 , gains momentum @xmath9 . for this reason acceleration by shocks",
    "is also referred to as first order fermi acceleration .",
    "however , as described below , this a somewhat of a misnomer because the actual is proportional to the square of the velocity ratio .",
    "ever since late 1970 s when several authors ( krymsky 1977 ; axford 1978 ; bell 1978 ; blandford & ostriker 1978 ) demonstrated that a simple version of this process can reproduce the observed cr spectrum , shock acceleration has been the most commonly invoked process .",
    "however , as we will discuss below , in the last couple of decades there has been a renewed interest in sa by turbulence , specially for electrons in radiation producing astrophysical sources from solar flares to clusters of galaxies .    in the next section we review the relative merits of different acceleration model and in  3 we give the general formalism used in the sa and other models . in ",
    "4 we will describe application of the sa model to solar flares .",
    "a brief summary and conclusions are presented in  5 .",
    "we are interested in comparing the various ways of production of energetic particles_starting from a relatively  cool \" background plasma usually having a thermal or maxwellian distribution _ with density @xmath10 and temperature @xmath11 .",
    "clearly this must be the first stage of any acceleration process , where the coulomb collisions , with mean free path @xmath12 , may be an important , if not the dominant energy loss and particle scattering process .",
    "in fact a thermal spectrum requires a high rate for these collisions involving both electrons and protons ( and heavier ions ) .",
    "thus , the first hurdle that any acceleration mechanism must overcome is this loss process .",
    "particles energized at this stage may escape the acceleration region with an energy dependent escape time @xmath13 favoring escape of the higher energy particles , thus resulting in a population of nonthermal particles , which are observed directly or through the radiation they produce .",
    "the escaping particles may be re - accelerated by other mechanisms possibly in collisionless surroundings with size @xmath14 . on the other hand , in a",
    ", i.e. when @xmath15 is larger than the dynamical timescale of the system then , in general , it is difficult to produce a substantial nonthermal tail . as shown in petrosian & east ( 2008 ) irrespective of the rate or energy dependence of the acceleration process a substantial , if not the bulk , of the energy input goes into heating of the plasma rather than producing a nonthermal electron tail .",
    "the most commonly acceleration mechanisms used for analysis of astrophysical sources are the following :      static electric fields * e * parallel to magnetic fields can accelerate a particle with charge @xmath16 and velocity @xmath17 with the energy gain rate of @xmath18 .",
    "if we define the dreicer field @xmath19 v / cm for solar flare conditions ) that results in an energy gain of @xmath20 per mean free path , then the energy change over a distance @xmath21 is given by = * e*_dm_ec^2ktnl2.510 ^ 23  ^-2 .",
    "[ efield ] thus , sub - dreicer fields can accelerate electrons to relativistic energies only if they extend over large column depths or @xmath22 . since the rate of energy gain per unit length is independent of particle mass ( because as defined @xmath23 ) , for acceleration of proton to relativistic regime ( @xmath24 ) we need a column depth of @xmath25 .",
    "for example , in solar flare coronal loops , with @xmath26 and column depth @xmath27 , particles can be accelerated up to only 10 s of kev , far below the required 10 s of mev electrons or @xmath28 gev protons .",
    "column depths and temperatures in astrophysical sources ( e.g. @xmath29 and @xmath30 k for intra cluster medium ; @xmath31 and @xmath32 k in typical galactic hii regions , etc ) are also not sufficient for acceleration of electrons or protons to relativistic energies .",
    "super - dreicer fields can accelerate particles to higher energies but since now the acceleration rate is higher than coulomb energy loss rate this can lead to runaway particles and an unstable bump - in - tail distribution which will give rise to turbulence .",
    "in addition , it is difficult to sustain large scale electric fields in a highly conducting ionized plasma unless the resistivity is anomalously high ( tsuneta 1985 ; holman 1985 ) .",
    "after the pioneering work by speiser ( 1970 ) it was assumed that the electric fields induced by reconnection are the agents of acceleration ( see also litvinenko 1996 , 2003 ; la rosa et al .",
    "2006 ) but recent particle - in - cell ( pic ) and mhd simulations of reconnection ( drake et al .",
    "2006 ; see also cassak et al .",
    "2006 ; zenitani & hoshino 2005 ) present a more complicated picture and show that turbulence may be an important ingredient .",
    "_ thus , electric fields can not be the sole agent of acceleration , but they may produce turbulence , which can accelerate particles _ and possibly enhance the reconnection rate , as suggested by lazarian & vishniac ( 1999 ) .      as mentioned above there are two types of fermi acceleration , first order in a shock and second order in a turbulent plasma . as also indicated above the former",
    "has been invoked often in astrophysical situations primarily because it is believed to be a faster mechanism of acceleration and the environment surrounding a supernova shock seems well suited for production of cr protons .",
    "however , there are many shortcomings in the original elegant models developed in late 1970 s for this mechanism .",
    "since then a great deal of work has gone into the the development of this model and in addressing its shortcomings .",
    "these include injection of seed particles , losses ( specially for electrons ) , and escape and nonlinear effects ( see drury 1983 ; blandford & eichler 1987 ; jones & ellison 1991 ; malkov & drury 2001 ; diamond & markov 2007 ; beresnyak et al .",
    "more importantly , a _ shock by itself can not accelerate particles _ and requires scattering agents that can cause the repeated passages across the shock front , especially for a parallel shock with magnetic field parallel to flow velocity .",
    "the most likely agent is turbulence and the rate of acceleration is governed again by the scattering rate by turbulence , and the acceleration rate , @xmath33 ( see below ) , is no longer first order in the velocity ratio .",
    "although there are indications that magnetic field and turbulence may be generated by the upstream accelerated particles ( see e.g. bell 1978 ) , many details of the microphysics remain unsolved .",
    "two stream ( or another plasma ) instability is a possible mechanism for generation of turbulence but there are indication that this may be suppressed in a turbulent medium ( yan & lazarian 2002 ) .",
    "exact determination of the scattering rate requires knowledge of the intensity and spectrum of the turbulence which determine @xmath34 but are essentially unknown .",
    "usually bohm diffusion is assumed .",
    "second order fermi or sa process , on the other hand , occurs always at some level because turbulence in addition to scattering can also accelerate particles directly . as is well known , relativistic particles in weakly magnetized plasma ( e.g. that in a supernova shock ) are scattered at a faster rate than the rate of acceleration by turbulence , so that acceleration by a shock is deemed to be faster .",
    "this , however , is not always the case , specially for acceleration of electrons in radiating sources . as we will discuss in more detail below , pryadko & petrosian ( 1997 ; pp97 ) showed that at low energies and/or in strongly magnetized plasmas the acceleration or energy diffusion rate by turbulence exceeds the scattering rate and therefore exceeds the acceleration rate by a shock .",
    "thus , under these circumstances the main objection of slowness of sa does not apply . for example , in the case of solar flares hamilton & petrosian ( 1992 ) show that sa by a modest level of whistler waves can accelerate the background particles to high energies within the desired time ( see also miller and reames 1996 ) .",
    "_ we can conclude then that irrespective of which process of acceleration is at work , turbulence always has a major role .",
    "_ moreover , as we will see in the next section , in practice , mathematically , there is little difference between first and second order fermi acceleration ( see e.g. jones 1994 ) .    there are , of course , other acceleration processes similar to those discussed above on the microphysics level but phenomenologically different .",
    "one such process is that proposed by drake et al .",
    "( 2006 ) occurring via the interactions of particles with the `` islands '' produced in their pic simulations .",
    "another is the process proposed by fisk & glockler ( 2010 ) for acceleration in the solar wind .",
    "these will be discussed in other sections of these proceedings .",
    "interactions of particles with turbulence , which is a common ingredient of all acceleration processes , are dominated by many weak rather than few strong scattering events . in this case",
    "the fokker - planck formalism provides the best description of the particle kinetics which can have different forms depending on circumstances .",
    "the basic equations here are well known and have been described in many papers in the past . in this section",
    "we briefly review these equations and point out two important features of plasma wave - particle interactions not broadly known or acknowledged .",
    "these features have important effects on the relative importance of first and second order fermi acceleration , and on the relative acceleration rates of electrons vs protons , @xmath0he vs @xmath1he and other ions .",
    "most astrophysical plasmas are strongly magnetized so that the gyro - radius of particles ( with mass @xmath35 ) , @xmath36 , is much smaller than the scale of the spatial variation of the field . in this case particles",
    "are tied to the magnetic field lines and instead of dealing with temporal evolution of the distribution of energetic particles in six dimensions ( 3 space , 3 momentum ) one deals with the gyro - phase averaged distribution which depends only on three variables ; spatial coordinate @xmath37 along the field lines , the momentum @xmath38 , the pitch angle or its cosine @xmath39 , and of course also time . and @xmath39 , or particle energy ( in @xmath40 units ) @xmath41 and @xmath39 , instead of @xmath42 and @xmath43 . ]",
    "then , the evolution of the particle distribution , @xmath44 , can be described by the fokker - planck equation as particles undergo stochastic scattering and acceleration by interaction with plasma turbulence ( with diffusion coefficients @xmath45 and @xmath46 ) and suffer losses ( with rate @xmath47 ) due to other interactions with the plasma particles and fields .",
    "the particles may also gain energy in presence of shocks or large scale electric fields ( with the rate @xmath48 ) : @xmath49+{\\partial \\over\\partial \\mu}\\left[d_{\\mu\\mu}{\\partial f\\over\\partial \\mu } + d_{\\mu p}{\\partial f\\over\\partial p}\\right ] -{1\\over p^2}{\\partial\\over\\partial p}(p^2\\dot{p}f ) + \\dot{s}. \\label{fpeq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath50 is the net momentum change rate and @xmath51 is a source term , which could be the background thermal plasma or some injected spectrum of particles . the effect of the magnetic field convergence or divergence can be accounted for by adding @xmath52 to the right hand side . and if there are large scale flows with velocity @xmath4 and spatial gradient @xmath53 along the field lines , e.g. around a shock front , their effects can be accounted for by adding the term ( p^3f ) - usf [ flowdiv ] to the right hand side . in general , this complete equation is rarely used to determine the particle distribution @xmath54 . instead the following approximations are used to make it more tractable .",
    "_ pitch - angle isotropy : _ if the pitch angle diffusion rate is high so that the scattering time @xmath55 is shorter than all other time scales ( @xmath56 , etc , where @xmath21 is the size of the interaction region ) , then the pitch angle distribution of the particles will be nearly isotropic .",
    "if we define f(t , s , p ) _",
    "-1 ^ 1 df(t , s , p , ) ,  q(t , s , p ) _",
    "-1 ^ 1 d(t , s , p , ) , then the kinetic equation simplifies to the _ diffusion - convection equation _ ( see , e.g. kirk et al . 1988 ; dung & petrosian 1994 ) @xmath57 where @xmath58 implies pitch angle averaged values and the three transport coefficients are related to the diffusion coefficients as @xmath59 this approximation is generally valid for high energy particles interacting with alfven waves in a plasma with relatively low magnetization , i.e. alfven velocity @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the magnetic field strength and @xmath62 is the gas density , .",
    "] so that r_1d_pp/(p^2d_)=/~(v_a / v)^21 .",
    "[ r1 ] however , as mentioned above , pp97 have shown that , in certain situations ( low energies and high magnetic fields ) , the energy diffusion rate @xmath63 may exceed the pitch angel diffusion rate @xmath64 so that @xmath65 , invalidating the above approximation . in this case",
    ", the momentum diffusion is the dominant term and the kinetic equation ( [ fpeq ] ) again simplifies to @xmath66 where now one must include the @xmath39 dependence of all terms and of the distribution function",
    ". in general , there will be significant acceleration only if the energy diffusion and acceleration times are shorter than the crossing time @xmath67 .",
    "in addition , if the scattering time @xmath68 , though now longer than momentum diffusion time , is also shorter than @xmath69 , and/or if the other coefficients ( most importantly those related to acceleration ) vary slowly with @xmath39 , then the particle distribution will again be nearly isotropic can also contribute to the scattering rate , specially at low energies , and help to isotropize the pitch angle distribution . ] and we can use pitch angle averaged distribution @xmath70 and coefficients d_pp= 12_-1 ^ 1 dd_pp ( ) , [ avdpp ] and ( similarly)@xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 . as described in the caption of figure [ figr1 ] ( right ) use of these averaged quantities is justified .",
    "in addition , now the term @xmath74 should be replaced by the spatial diffusion term @xmath75 .",
    "thus , we can ignore @xmath39 dependences , in which case the two equations are almost identical : they have different spatial dependence terms ( e.g. terms involving @xmath76 ) , but more importantly , have two different momentum diffusion forms ; one for the case @xmath77 in equation ( [ kpp ] ) and the second for @xmath78 given by equation ( [ avdpp ] ) .    _",
    "spatial homogeneity : _ a second simplification , which applies to both @xmath77 and @xmath79 cases , can be used if the acceleration region is homogeneous ( i.e. @xmath80 ) , or if one deals with a spatially unresolved source where one is interested in spatially integrated equations . in this case",
    "it is convenient to define @xmath81 $ ] and replace the spatial diffusion term ( or the advection term in equation [ [ kelowe ] ] ) plus other terms involving @xmath82 by an escape term with an escape time @xmath83 defined by dv 4p^2s(_ssfs - f1p^2p(p^3_sp))= n(t , e)(e ) .",
    "[ tesc ] then we obtain the well - known equation [ homog1 ] n t = e",
    "( d_eee n ) - e ( [ a(e ) - e_l ] n ) - n t_esc + ,  with  t_esc=+^2 , [ keall ] where @xmath84 is the energy loss rate .",
    "this clearly is an approximation with the primary assumption being that the transport coefficients vary slowly spatially , e.g. @xmath85 ) , @xmath86 , etc .",
    "note that here @xmath87 and @xmath88 represent the rates of injection and escape of particles in and out of the acceleration site , and that @xmath89 as defined can account for the spatial diffusion term in equation ( [ kehighe ] ) when @xmath90 and the advection term in equation ( [ kelowe ] ) when of @xmath91 .",
    "this equation is fairly general and can handle different acceleration scenarios .",
    "for example for the sa by turbulence the energy diffusion and the direct acceleration coefficients are related as ) is written as @xmath92 in which case we need to add @xmath93 to the right hand side of the direct acceleration term @xmath94 . ] d_ee = v^2|d_pp and a(e)=(d_ee / e)[(2 ^ 2 -1)/(^2 + ) ] , where @xmath95 is equal to @xmath96 for the isotropic case ( equation [ kehighe ] ) and is equal to @xmath97 for equation ( [ kelowe ] ) . as stressed above turbulence",
    "is present in all acceleration scenarios so these energy diffusion and the direct acceleration rates are the minimum rates .",
    "however if there are other diffusion or acceleration mechanisms we should add their contribution .",
    "for example , if the acceleration volume contains a converging flow ( as in a shock ) with velocity @xmath4 , then there will be additional direct acceleration rate @xmath98 . should be added inside the large parenthesis in equation ( [ tesc ] ) . ] or , at low energies and for a high density plasma , as mentioned above , one should add the effects of pitch angle and energy diffusion due to coulomb collisions .",
    "finally , for completeness we mention that for most astrophysical situations the primary contribution to the loss rate for energetic electrons comes from coulomb collisions at low energies ( which as stated at the outset are essential in establishing a thermal distribution ) and synchrotron and inverse compton at high energies , and for protons from elastic coulomb collisions and inelastic strong interactions with background protons and other ions . in certain cases",
    "there may be catastrophic losses through which particles are taken out of the system .",
    "_ in summary then , it turns out that this most commonly used transport equation in astrophysical problems is a good approximation at all energies and all degrees of magnetization for spatially unresolved sources .",
    "_      there are two noteworthy aspects to the formalism described above .",
    "the first feature is related to the fact that the relative rates of the momentum and pitch angle diffusion , and hence the ratio @xmath99 , vary with plasma conditions and particle energy .",
    "this has two important consequences .",
    "the first is that both rates increase with decreasing energy and/or increasing level of turbulence ( see equation [ [ taup ] ] below ) . as a result sa of low energy thermal particles in magnetized plasma ,",
    "the type usually encountered in astrophysical radiating sources , is not slow as the second order name would imply . in deed , in recent years this has been recognized and sa has found application in many sources involving acceleration of low energy background electrons .    the second has to do with the change of the ratio @xmath99 . in figure [ figr1 ] ( left , from pp97 )",
    "we show contour maps of this ratio in the electron energy and degree of magnetization space represented by the parameter @xmath100 , the ratio of plasma to gyro frequency . on the middle panel",
    "we show variation of @xmath99 ( from petrosian & liu , 2004 , * pl04 * ) with energy for several values of @xmath39 for both electrons and protons interacting with parallel propagating plasma waves .",
    "these figures show the regions of the phase space where @xmath78 and where the sa by turbulence is the dominant process .",
    "let us consider a simple non relativistic hydrodynamic shock or a parallel shock with magnetic field parallel to the shock flow velocity . of the diffusion parallel and perpendicular to the field lines",
    "( see e.g. giacalone 2005a & 2005b and references therein ) . ]",
    "the sa rate is @xmath101 while the shock acceleration rate is proportional to fractional energy gain per crossing @xmath102 divided by average crossing time @xmath103 ( krymsky et al .",
    "1979 ; lagage & cesarsky 1983 ; drury 1983 ) so that the shock acceleration rate @xmath104 is no longer a first order mechanism , and the ratio @xmath105 .",
    "this means that when @xmath78 , which is the case at low energies , the sa is the more dominant of the two mechanisms .",
    "thus , the following picture seems to emerge .",
    "when a particle crosses the shock to the downstream turbulent region its interactions with plasma waves increase its energy substantially before it has a chance to cross the shock .",
    "only when its energy has increased to a sufficiently large value to make the ratio @xmath77 , then it can undergo repeated passage across the shock , only when its energy has increased to a sufficiently large value to make a @xmath77 , then it can undergo repeated passage across the shock , hence beginning a second stage of acceleration by the shock .",
    "note also that even at high energies and interactions with low frequency fast modes with phase velocity equal to alfven velocity when @xmath106 is less than one , the ratio of the sa to shock acceleration rates a_sa / a_sh~(v_a / u_sh)^2~1/(_p m^2 ) , [ saoversh ] which could be greater than one for low beta plasmas @xmath107 and for shocks with low mach number @xmath108 .",
    "thus , we can think of the acceleration as a with turbulence providing the initial rise in energy of background plasma till they become energetic enough to be accelerated also by the shock during which sa continues and may not be negligible .",
    "this sort of behavior can be seen in the recent pic simulation by sironi & spitkovsky ( 2009 ) where test particles appear to gain energy gradually in the downstream region till they cross the shock and get a jump in energy ( see their figure 8) .",
    "this hybrid scenario , in a way , also solves the long standing  injection problem \" in shock acceleration requiring injection of high energy ( i.e pre accelerated ) particles , especially for perpendicular shocks .    in the electron energy and parameter @xmath109 for @xmath110 .",

    "the second interesting feature has to do with the difference between the energy diffusion and acceleration rates in the two limiting cases ( equations [ kehighe ] and [ kelowe ] ) derived above . for a resonant interaction with plasma waves in general",
    "the three fokker - planck diffusion coefficients obey the following simple relations ( see e.g. pl04 for parallel and pryadko & petrosian 1999 , for perpendicular propagating waves ) : ( d_pp / p^2):(d_p / p):d_=[x_j^2]:[x_j(1-x_j)]:[(1-x_j)^2 ] with x_j=(v_ph , j / v)^2 [ relds ] where @xmath117 is the phase velocity of the plasma mode ( with frequency @xmath118 and wave vector @xmath119 ) in resonance with the particle of momentum @xmath38 and pitch angle cosine @xmath39 .",
    "this implies that for interaction with a single wave the acceleration rate as given in equation ( [ kpp ] ) , would be zero . )",
    "the expressions in equation ( [ relds ] ) .",
    "] however , in general interactions with many waves contribute to each coefficient so that this rate is never zero , but if the interaction with one mode is dominant then the rate becomes much smaller than normal diffusion rate @xmath120 .",
    "figure [ figr1 ] ( right ) shows the energy dependence at various values of @xmath39 of the acceleration ( and scattering ) times based on the two forms of the acceleration rate ( black vs red curves ) . as evident",
    "there is considerable difference between the two rates specially at low energies , and the differences are more pronounced for protons compared to electrons . as discussed below , this is important for the relative sa rates of different species in particular for electrons vs protons .",
    "we will also show that a similar process affects the relative acceleration of @xmath0he and @xmath1he in solar flares .",
    "over the past several decades there has been considerable discussion of first vs second order acceleration ( see e.g. drury 1983 ) and the role of turbulence in the latter ( see e.g. hall & sturrock 1967 ; kulsrud & ferarrri 1971 ) .",
    "however the success of shock acceleration in producing the observed cr spectrum has relegated sa by turbulence to be a less important process even though the importance of the role played by turbulence in scattering of the energetic particles is fully appreciated . as shown above",
    ", there are many similarities between the two processes , and in some cases sa by turbulence may be the dominant process . this fact has been recognized in more recent times and there has been renewed activity in application of the sa model to several astrophysical sources .",
    "most prominent among these is the solar flare which is the most developed and will be discussed in more detail below . but sa has been applied to nonthermal emission from accretion disks around black holes : e.g. sgr a * black hole in the center of the milky way ( liu et al , 2004 , 2006a and 2006b ) , other active galactic nuclei ( stawartz & petrosian 2008 ) , stellar size black holes ( li & miller 1997 ) , gamma - ray bursts ( lazarian et al .",
    "2003 ) , to supernovae shocks ( scott & chevalier 1975 ; cowsik & sarkar 1984 ; fan et al . 2009 ; virtanen & vainio 2005 ) , to giants radio galaxy lobes ( lacombe 1977 ; achterberg 1979 ; eilek 1979 ) , and to intra cluster medium of clusters of galaxies ( petrosian 2001 , brunetti & lazarian 2007 ) .",
    "the complete development of a solar flare involves many phases .",
    "after a complex preflare build up of magnetic fields , the first phase is the reconnection and the process of the energy release .",
    "the final consequences of this released energy are the observed radiations from radio to gamma - rays , solar energetic particles ( seps ) , and coronal mass ejections ( cmes ) .",
    "the basic scenario for these processes , as depicted by the cartoon in figure [ model ] ( left ) , can be summarized as follows : even though it is generally agreed that the flare energy comes from the annihilation of magnetic fields via reconnection , the exact mechanisms of the release and dissipation of this energy remains controversial .",
    "dissipation can occur via _ plasma heating , particle acceleration or plasma turbulence_. as stated above turbulence is a necessary ingredient for acceleration and , as we will outline below , there is considerable observational evidence favoring sa by turbulence .",
    "thus we believe that most of the magnetic energy is converted into turbulence near or above the top of a coronal loop , which we refer to as the acceleration site or the loop top ( lt ) region .",
    "the turbulence undergoes nonlinear wave - wave interactions causing a dissipationless cascade to smaller scales .",
    "the wave - particle interaction results in damping of the turbulence , heating of the plasma and acceleration of particles .",
    "the accelerated particles are somewhat trapped at the lt because of their short mean free path due to scattering by turbulence which enhances their radiation intensity there .",
    "eventually these particles escape the turbulent lt region .",
    "some escape along open field lines and may undergo further scattering and acceleration by a cme shock during their transport to the earth where they are detected as seps .",
    "most of the particles travel down the legs of the loop and produce the observed flare radiation ; microwaves via synchrotron , hard x - rays ( hxr ) via bremsstrahlung produced by electrons , and gamma - rays via nuclear line excitations and decay of pions ( primarily @xmath121 ) produced by protons , along the loop , but primarily at its foot points ( fps ) .",
    "however most of the energy of the accelerated particles is dissipated in the chromosphere and below via inelastic coulomb collisions .",
    "this deposited energy causes heating and evaporation of the plasma up into coronal loops , which then produces the bulk of the flare radiation in the forms of thermal soft x - rays and optical photons .",
    "the evaporation changes the the density and temperature in the corona which can affect the reconnection , energy release and acceleration processes .",
    "observations of solar flares are reviewed by raymond et al . and some theoretical aspects , namely those on global aspects of energy release and acceleration are reviewed by cargill et al . in this proceedings .",
    "here we discuss the confrontation between the accelerations models and observations .",

    "@xmath122 one observation which we believe provides the most compelling and direct evidence for the presence of turbulence in the lt ( acceleration ) site is the observation by _ yohkoh _ ( masuda et al . 1994 ) showing a distinct impulsive hxr emission from the lt in addition to the usual fp sources .",
    "this apparently is present in almost all _ yohkoh _ flares ( petrosian et al . 2002 ) and analysis of flares has confirmed this picture ( liu et al .",

    "this requires an enhanced scattering near the lt region .",
    "petrosian & donaghy ( 1999 ) show that coulomb scattering can not be the agent for this trapping because then the electrons will also lose most of their energy in the lt region on the same timescale and never reach the fps .",
    "the most likely scattering agent is turbulence .",
    "this turbulence can also accelerate the electrons .",
    "there may be other acceleration at work too , but as described above , at low energies and for solar flare conditions ( low @xmath124 plasma ) sa by turbulence is the most effective process .",

    "this simple picture also predicts a gradual rise of the lt source accompanied with a continuous increase in separation of the fps as the reconnection proceeds and larger closed loops are formed , a feature that has been seen at other wavelength but it is usually difficult to see in hxrs in weak flares because of low signal to noise ratio and in most strong flares because they tend to have complicated loop structures . the nov .",

    "@xmath122 another important observation by is the relative spectra of lt and fp sources .",
    "the lt source is often dominated by a very hot thermal type emission with a relatively soft tail , while the fp sources consist of harder power laws with little or no thermal part as shown by the example in figure [ ff ] ( left ) .",
    "these are exactly the kind of spectra that come out from models of sa by turbulence shown in the right panel of figure [ ff ] .",
    "figure [ ff ] ( left ) also shows a forward fit of the observed spectra to those obtained from sa model with the specified acceleration parameters .",
    "@xmath122 flares during the impulsive phase often show a soft - hard - soft temporal evolution and sometimes a slower than expected ( assuming only losses ) temperature decline in the thermal decay phase ( mctiernan et al .",

    "tylka & lee ( 2006 ) in their phenomenological study of acceleration by a shock were able to produce the observed spectra of the sep assuming a  suprathermal \" seed population , extending to higher energies for perpendicular shocks .",
    "it then seems natural to assume that the seed particles are flare accelerated ions which are then re - accelerated by the shock .",
    "the @xmath1he spectra of high fluence events shown in figure [ he ] ( right ) have this kind of characteristics making them good candidates for re - acceleration .",
    "this leads us to the following scenario .",
    "the flare site acceleration is the first and primary stage of acceleration and is common to all events .",
    "a second phase acceleration can occur in the cme shocks which could modify the spectrum of seps escaping the flare site .",
    "the possibility that there may be two acceleration mechanisms at work is not a new idea .",
    "the new aspect of this scenario is that we have a hybrid acceleration model , where the seeds of the second stage ( re)acceleration by the cme shock are the flare site particles accelerated by turbulence .",
    "mev / nucleon ) ions are  present upstream of all interplanetary shocks \" ( desai et al . 2003 ) . ] as shown above , the spectrum of particles escaping the flare site consists of two components : a low energy quasi - thermal component ( which is below the observable energy range of 0.1 to 10 mev / nucleon ) and a higher energy nonthermal component with high @xmath0he enrichment .",
    "this scenario has the attractive feature that even though the nonthermal tails may be highly enriched ( as in impulsive flares ) , the total ( quasi - thermal plus nonthermal ) number of seed particles injected into the cme shock can have essentially normal abundances and harder ( power - law ) spectra . thus , for events near the gradual end",
    "both components are re - accelerated leading to a near normal abundances .    in figure [ reacc ]",
    "we compare the sep observations of the gradual 18 jan .",
    "2000 event with small isotopic enhancement ( points ) with the re - accelerated spectra ( solid lines ) obtained using the flare accelerated spectra ( dashed lines ) as the source term @xmath155 in equation ( [ keall ] ) that are re - acceleration , with an addition of direct acceleration term @xmath156 , presumably due to a cme shock , with of @xmath157 at 0.1 mev / nucleon .",
    "the resultant spectra are harder and closer to normal abundance ratio .",
    "we hasten to add that these are preliminary explorations and the agreement , though not perfect , is very good considering that we have used a simple power law acceleration rate .",
    "a better agreement can be achieved with a more realistic form for the acceleration rate .",
    "a similar scenario can also explain the differences between the distributions of electron to proton energy flux ratio deduced from observations at the flare site and from seps shown in figure [ evspfig ] ( left ) . as discussed in  4.2.2 , in general sa at the flare site",
    "is more efficient in acceleration of electrons than protons that have energies capable of producing the observed gamma - rays .",
    "however , as also emphasized in  4.2.2 , just as is the case for @xmath1he , flare accelerated protons have a substantial low energy component which can be re - accelerated at a cme shock to yield a smaller electron to proton ratio in seps as compared to flares .      in a new and possibly far reaching work ( petrosian & chen 2010 )",
    ", we have initiated determination of some of the important parameters of the kinetic equation ( [ keall ] ) ( left ) directly from the observed data instead of the usual forward fitting method , like that shown in figure [ ff ] , where one assumes values and energy dependences for these parameters , calculates the particle distribution and its radiative spectrum , and then fits to the data ( see e.g. park et al .",

    "using the recently developed _",
    "regularized inversion _",
    "technique by piana et al .",
    "( 2003 and 2007 ) , we are able to determine the energy dependence of the escape and scattering times due to turbulence as shown in figure [ reacc ] ( right ) .",
    "an important aspect of this result is that the escape time increases with energy ( and as a result the scattering time decreases ) relatively rapidly in disagreement with the expected behavior for sa by parallel propagating plasma waves with a kolmogorov type spectrum ( see pp97 or pl04 ) .",
    "the observed behavior requires a steeper than kolmogorov spectrum so that we are dealing with wave vector values in the steep damping range .",
    "this discrepancy could also be an indication that the simple sa model used in above mentioned papers requires modification .",
    "for example , inclusion of the effects of the convergence of the magnetic fields in the lt region , as can be seen in figure [ model ] ( left ) , can produce an escape time similar to the timescale for coulomb collisions which increases with energy . or our simplified description of the escape time as defined in equation ( [ keall ] ) may require modification .",
    "another possibility is that the outflows from the reconnection region may produce standing shocks that can modify the acceleration rate relative to the scattering rate .",
    "these are interesting possibilities that eie intend be explored in future works .",

    "we have shown that at low energies and for highly magnetized plasmas sa by turbulence is the most efficient mechanism and that it can accelerate particles as rapidly as required in most astrophysical radiation sources .",
    "thus , sa is an attractive scenario for acceleration of background thermal particles .",
    "we have also pointed out that in the presence of shocks a hybrid process of initial sa acceleration by turbulence and subsequent re - acceleration by the shock is what may be operating in many situations providing an answer to the long standing question of origin of the seed particles for shock acceleration .",
    "we have shown that a closer analysis of wave - particle interactions in a turbulent plasma also leads to interesting differences between the acceleration rates of electrons and protons and among heavier ions , in particular @xmath0he and @xmath1he .",

    "we have argued that recent high spatial observations at hxrs , specially those by provide strong evidence for the presence of turbulence in the acceleration sites of flares in the corona near the top of the flaring loops .",
    "we have shown that the sa by turbulence can account for high relative efficiency of acceleration of electrons vs protons in solar flares that agrees with their relative numbers as deduced by the hxr emission by electrons and gamma - ray emission by protons .",
    "similarly , we have shown that this model can account quantitatively for the long standing puzzle of extreme enhancement of @xmath0he abundances in the low fluence impulsive sep events relative to that of @xmath1he and reproduce their observed spectra accurately .    however , there are some aspects of seps that the sa model can not account for .",
    "one is the fact that the ratio of electron to proton energy ratios in seps is smaller than in flares .",
    "another is that @xmath1he spectra resulting in from sa by turbulence in the flare region for high fluence - gradual events are too soft compared with observations .",
    "we have proposed that the hybrid model described above can resolve these discrepancies , whereby the flare accelerated particles are re - accelerated by cme shocks which are more likely to be present in bigger flares .",
