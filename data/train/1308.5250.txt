    "the hydrogen ionizing photons heat the surrounding gas that expands producing a hot , rarefied and ionized medium opposing the collapse of the denser ambient medium subject to the bh gravitational field .",
    "the rti can act as an effective mechanism for delivering high - density gas to the central gravitating source ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "thus , understanding of the rti around luminous gravitational sources such as proto - stellar cores or bhs , is of critical importance for estimating their accretion rates , which might enhance the final mass of stellar cores or the growth rate of bhs .",
    "in particular , the accretion rate on to a bh is directly related to the energy it emits but the enhanced luminosity may also suppress the gas supply to the bh . therefore , the onset of rti could be important for the mechanism of self - regulation of bh growth .    in this paper , we perform radiation - hydrodynamic simulations to examine the special case of rti in the context of radiation - regulated accretion on to bhs .",

    "d_-type i - front separates the ionized gas from the neutral higher density gas . in @xcite",
    ", we explored the role of the strmgren sphere in regulating the gas supply from large scales to the bh .",
    "we found a periodic variation of accretion luminosity and thus the size of the strmgren  sphere @xcite determined by the thermal structure of the gas inside the strmgren sphere .",
    "@xcite found that the average accretion rate is typically 1 per cent of the bondi accretion rate of the neutral gas when it is radiation - regulated . in this regime ,",
    "the average accretion rate is comparable to the bondi rate in the ionized gas that is lower than the eddington limit when @xmath0 . in general",
    ", the effect of photon momentum is found to be negligible since the accretion rate shows oscillatory behaviour due to self - regulation .",
    "the acceleration due to radiation pressure is negligible compared to the gravity by the bh in the entire range of radius for most time of the quasi - periodic oscillation .",
    "however , for the case of momentum - driven i - front in the eddington - limited regime , the photon momentum can be effective in enhancing the rti across the i - front since radiation pressure increases the effective gravity at the i - front .",
    "the strmgren sphere should be subject to rti since lower density ( i.e. , hot and ionized bubble ) gas supports higher density neutral gas against the bh s gravity .",
    "moreover , the feedback loop generates sharp bursts of the bh luminosity , that result in a rapid increase of the size of the strmgren  sphere .",
    "when the strmgren  sphere expands during the luminosity burst , the rti can grow on a shorter time - scale since the effective acceleration in the frame of reference of the i - front increases .",
    "however , our previous simulations @xcite show that the i - front is remarkably stable to rti , even for perturbations with short wavelength that should grow on time - scales shorter than the period between luminosity bursts when the strmgren  sphere is stationary .",
    "in addition , 1d and 2d simulations produce the same results in terms of accretion rate and period of the luminosity cycle .",
    "we observe a transitory development of the rti only during the periodic luminosity bursts , however the growth of rti fingers is quickly suppressed and does not fuel the bh .",

    "we assume idealized spherically symmetric accretion on to stationary bhs from non - magnetized neutral gas with zero angular momentum .",
    "in particular , we investigate the rti of i - front on the order of the bondi radius scale where the gravity becomes dominant over the thermal energy of the neutral gas , and thus the rti is effectively influenced . the present study , although idealized , illustrates the stabilizing effect of opacity to ionizing radiation to the development of rti at i - fronts .",
    "the simplifying assumptions of spherical symmetry and small gas angular momentum are rather realistic at the scale of the bondi radius in many astrophysical applications ( galactic winds or active galactic nucleus winds ) ; however , they are not critical to the development of the instability .",

    "the size of the strmgren sphere around the bh can be calculated from @xmath10 when the hydrogen number density , @xmath15 , is known : @xmath16 , where we assume hydrogen recombination coefficient @xmath17@xmath18s@xmath19 . therefore , the size of the strmgren sphere is @xmath20 the assumption of thermal pressure equilibrium across the i - front is a good approximation only if @xmath21 .",
    "instead the i - front collapses on to the bh if @xmath22 , or equivalently , when the thermal energy of the gas outside the strmgren  sphere is smaller than the gravitational potential energy at the i - front : @xmath23    20 ( solid ) , 40 ( dashed ) and 80 ( dot  dashed ) . from top to bottom , each group of lines shows the maximum , average and the minimum loci of the i - fronts . note that the average locations increase as a function of time ( by about 5 per cent at @xmath24yr ) due to the decreased density inside the h  ii  region .",
    "the difference between the maximum and minimum locations decreases for each simulation as a function of time for all values of @xmath25 .",

    "given the limited resolution of finite grids of the current study , the development of the rti can be observed only when @xmath8 is extremely low or the front is accelerating outwards , which makes the critical scale @xmath47 increase .",
