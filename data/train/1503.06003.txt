    "although asymptotically ads spacetimes ( in this paper , when we refer asymptotically ads spacetimes we mean spacetimes asymptotically goes to ads , whose boundary conditions donot have to preserve all the asymptotic ads symmetries ) have attracted remarkable interest in recent decades , our understanding of their conserved charges , like energy , is still not clear enough , especially when gravity is coupled to matter fields and the boundary conditions can not preserve all the asymptotic ads symmetries .",
    "several method have been developed to define conserved charges in asymptotically @xmath0 spacetimes : the hamiltonian definition developed by henneaux and teitelboim  @xcite , the amd s ( ashtekar - magnon - das ) conformal method  @xcite , the  counterterm subtraction method \"  @xcite .",
    "there are also other methods like the kbl method  @xcite , the spinor method  @xcite and the  pseudotensor \" method  @xcite , which we will not consider further in this paper . based on the general  covariant phase space formalism \" developed by wald et .",
    "@xcite , hollands , ishibashi and marolf developed another method  @xcite to calculate the conserved charges in asymptotically ads - spacetimes , and made a comparison between those methods mentioned above .",
    "they showed that , with boundary conditions preserving all the asymptotic ads symmetries and the matter fields decreasing fast enough when approaching the boundary , those methods are all equivalent to each other , except the energy calculated by  counterterm subtraction method \" has an additional constant term in some cases , which can be interpreted as the casmir energy of the dual cft .",
    "these methods all have strict requirements : not only the boundary conditions should preserve all the asymptotic ads symmetries , but also the stress - tensor or matter fields should decrease fast enough when approaching boundary .",
    "however , in general these requirements are not satisfied by the asymptotic behaviors of the solutions , and thus , the boundary conditions are weakened .",
    "for example , consider gravity minimally coupled to a scalar field @xmath1 with a scalar mass @xmath2 above or saturating the bf ( breitenlohner - freedman ) bound  @xcite , with the lagrangian ( note that in this paper we use the convention @xmath3 ) expressed as @xmath4 it is known that , the tachyonic ( @xmath5 ) scalars ads spacetime are stable provided their mass is above the bf bound . in these theories the asymptotic ads symmetries can not be fully preserved by the boundary conditions in general ( which we will see later ) , and also the scalar field usually decreases slower than the requirements mentioned above .",
    "one can find many examples in  @xcite , where the asymptotic behaviors of many different solutions are studied .",
    "if we consider a scalar mass slightly above the bf bound and use the static spherical metric ansatz , @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the spacetime dimension and @xmath8 is the metric on the unit @xmath9-sphere , then the asymptotic behaviour of the scalar field is given by @xmath10 the two parameter which satisfy @xmath11 , are determined by the spacetime dimentsion @xmath7 and the scalar mass @xmath12 ( see ( [ sigma ] ) and ( [ sle ] ) ) . when @xmath13 , the speed requirement for the decreasing of the scalar field can not be satisfied . and the asymptotic ads symmetries can not be fully preserved unless we impose a family of special boundary conditions between @xmath14 and @xmath15  @xcite , which are : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is an arbitrary constant with out variation .    with their requirements not satisfied , the methods mentioned above begin to give different masses .",
    "although they still give finite results in many cases ( for details one should consult  @xcite ) .",
    "we can not trust their results in these situations .    under such weakened boundary conditions ,",
    "some work  @xcite was done to calculate the conserved charges in einstein - scalar gravities using the the hamiltonian formula ( or the henneaux - teitelboim construction ) .",
    "soon after , the same results  @xcite were obtained using wald s formula  @xcite .",
    "the only requirement on boundary conditions for the hamiltonian formula and wald s formula is to generate finite conserved charges , so it seems their results can be trusted .",
    "their energy has contributions from both the gravity sector and the scalar field sector . since the scalar field doesnot decrease fast enough when approaching the boundary , both of the two contributions have divergent terms .",
    "however , when we add them together , the divergent terms cancel with each other , thus , a finite result comes out in the end . in the next section",
    "we give a brief review on the hamiltonian formula and wald s formula , and show they are equivalent to each other in einstein - scalar gravities .",
    "however , the masses calculated in these two ways are non - integrable , or in other words the variation of the mass can not be written as a total variation .",
    "this makes the energy ill - defined .",
    "we will explain why we call it ill - defined in section [ pro ] .",
    "in fact the non - integrability of mass also happens in gravities couples to other matter fields . in some cases ,",
    "this problem can be solved by some proper gauge choice , for example the rn - ads ( reissner - nordstrom ) black holes , however this does not work for the einstein - scalar gravities .",
    "we also discuss another problem of these definitions of mass , which is related to the interpretation of the entropy of some hairy solutions .",
    "the validity of wald s formula to calculate the conserved energy of scalar hairy solutions was discussed in  @xcite ; however , we do not agree with their conclusions here .",
    "we use the rn - ads black holes as an example to show that wald s formula is in fact not used properly for calculating the energy of those scalar hairy solutions .",
    "wald s formula is a very powerful method to study thermodynamics in gravities , especially when the gravities have coupled matter fields and weakened boundary conditions .",
    "based on wald s formula and with a little modification , we give a new definition of mass for these theories including einstein - scalar gravities .",
    "our definition is different from  @xcite . in order to definite the mass in our way",
    ", we need to introduce a new charge attached to the scalar field ( section [ sch ] ) , we call this a scalar charge",
    ". the existence of this charge has already been discussed before from the black hole thermodynamics point of view  @xcite .",
    "this definition gives the same results with the methods mentioned in the first paragraph when all their requirements are satisfied .",
    "and when the boundary conditions are weakened , the our results are different from the definitions given by  @xcite and do not have the problems mentioned in the previous paragraph .",
    "we generalize our definition of mass to general gravities couple to matter fields in the sec .",
    "[ generalize ] . and",
    "in the last section we further discuss the mass in gravity with boundary conditions .",
    "the hamiltonian formula directly construct the hamiltonian of the theory  @xcite , which is the usual hamiltonian supplemented by an addition of a surface integral on the boundary @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a spacelike surface and @xmath20 are the constraints . imposing the constraints @xmath21",
    "the energy is just given by the surface integral terms .",
    "these surface integral terms are defined on a variational level , and have contributions from both the gravity sector , @xmath22 , and the scalar field sector , @xmath23 .",
    "consider the lagrangian given by ( [ lag ] ) , we can calculate out these two contributions : @xmath24 where @xmath25 , @xmath26 is the deviation from the pure ads spatial metric @xmath27 and @xmath28 with @xmath29 the unit normal to @xmath19 .",
    "both @xmath22 and @xmath30 have divergent terms as the scalar field decays too slow when approaching the boundary ; however , the divergent terms cancel with each other when adding them together  @xcite .",
    "thus we get a finite variation of energy at last .",
    "consider the spherically metric @xmath31 ( [ m1 ] ) , we find the variation of mass defined by this formula @xmath32 is given by @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the volume of the unit @xmath9-sphere .",
    "the @xmath35 case is given in  @xcite .",
    "one can get the mass by integrating out @xmath36      here we write the covariant lagrangian as a @xmath7-form @xmath37 , and its variation can always be written in the form @xmath38 where @xmath39 is a @xmath40-form , @xmath41 represents all the metric functions and the scalar field .",
    "and @xmath42 represents the constraints , which will vanish when the equations of motion are satisfied .",
    "the noether current defined by wald and iyer is defined as @xmath43 which is shown  @xcite to satisfy @xmath44 this means the current @xmath45 is conserved when @xmath41 satisfies the equations of motion . hence @xmath45 is a closed form and can be written as @xmath46    it has been shown in  @xcite that when @xmath47 is a killing vector , we can get @xmath48 this indicates the @xmath9-form @xmath49 is closed .",
    "stokes theorem indicates that the integral of @xmath50 over a spherical surface is independent of the radius of the surface . in other words ,",
    "the integral on the horizon @xmath51 and on the boundary @xmath52 are the same , @xmath53 if one is familiar with wald s formula , one would know that , the equation above usually gives the thermodynamic first law of the solutions .",
    "for pure gravity , when we take @xmath54 , the right hand side of ( [ fl ] ) gives @xmath55 while the left hand side gives @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is proportional to the area @xmath58 of the event horizon .",
    "thus , ( [ fl ] ) just gives the standard thermodynamic first law @xmath59 .",
    "the walds - formula definition of mass is just given by @xmath60 where @xmath61 is considered as the conjugate charge associated to the killing vector @xmath54 .",
    "the existence of this mass require the existence of a ( @xmath62)-form @xmath63 which satisfies @xmath64 so the variation @xmath65 can be written as a total variation .",
    "this makes sure that the mass can be integrated out with the result independent from the integral path . in  @xcite , this requirement is reinterpreted as , for any variation @xmath66 and @xmath67 tangent to the space of solutions , the satisfaction of the following equation @xmath68    let us now consider the einstein - scalar gravity ( [ lag ] ) .",
    "we find the @xmath9-form @xmath69 also has contributions from both the gravity sector @xmath70 , and the scalar field sector , @xmath71 .",
    "after some calculations we get @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the levi - civita tensor . applying the static metric ansatz ( [ m1 ] ) and choosing the killing vector to be @xmath54 , we have  @xcite @xmath74    compare the two results ( [ wf ] ) and ( [ hf ] ) , we see that , the walds - formula definition of mass is equivalent with the hamiltonian - formula definition of mass in this case .",
    "although the surface integrals on the boundary in the above two formulas are finite fro einstein - scalar gravities , their definitions of mass have some fundamental problems .",
    "first the variation of their mass are actually non - integrable .",
    "we use the example in  @xcite to show this problem . consider a 4-dimensional gravity ( [ lag ] ) with a scalar potential @xmath75 where @xmath76 .",
    "it can be shown that the scalar mass @xmath77 is above the bf bound . by solving the linearized equation of motion for the scalar field , the large radius decay of the scalar field is given by @xmath78",
    "we now impose the metric ansatz ( [ m1 ] ) , and numerically solve the equations of motion . by varying the initial values of the radius of the horizon @xmath79 and the value of the scalar field on the horizon @xmath80 , we get the space of solutions on the plane of ( @xmath81 ) , which are described by two independent parameters , see fig .",
    "( [ f1 ] ) . inside this space",
    "we can choose boundary conditions @xmath82 freely .",
    "one thing we should keep in mind is that some points on ( @xmath81 ) plane may represent many different solutions . in other words , it is not a one to one match between the plane and the space of solutions .",
    "for example the origin @xmath83 represents all schwarzschild - ads solutions with no scalar hair .",
    "the energy @xmath36 of these solutions is calculated in  @xcite with the hamiltonian formula .",
    "follow ( [ hf ] ) , we get @xmath84 with @xmath85 given by the large @xmath86 bahavior of @xmath87 , @xmath88    we see that @xmath36 can not be written as a total variation , hence is non - integrable .",
    "the directest way to solve this problem is assuming a boundary condition @xmath82 thus giving an integral path .",
    "however this way will lead to controversail results .",
    "this means for a specific solution with specific metric and scalar field we can not define its mass without imposing a boundary condition ( or integral path ) @xmath82 .",
    "further more , the choice of boundary conditions in the space of solutions can be quite arbitrary and different boundary conditions will give different masses .",
    "this implies the mass of a specific solution is also arbitrary .",
    "this contradicts with the usual understanding of mass .",
    "we can also use wald s formula to calculate the mass . applying to this case",
    ", the variation of mass calculated by wald s formula ( [ mw ] ) agrees with ( [ mh ] ) .",
    "the check the validity of the calculation , the holding of eq .",
    "( [ re2 ] ) is also checked in  @xcite , provided we have assumed a boundary condition @xmath82 .",
    "here we just cite the result , which is @xmath89    this means eq .",
    "( [ re2 ] ) holds and it seems the calculation seems valid .",
    "however this does not mean the energy is independent of the integral path because when we choose a boundary condition @xmath82 , we have already chosen an integral path in the space of solutions .",
    "hence we do not agree with that the holding of eq .",
    "( [ re3 ] ) after choosing a boundary condition would make the definition of mass ( [ mw ] ) valid .",
    "_ we argue that , imposing a boundary condition to make a non - integrable mass integrable may be inappropriate_.    to further explain our arguments , we give a more convincing example , which is the calculation of the mass of four - dimensional electrically charged rn - ads black holes ( we set the magnetic charge to be zero for simplicity ) using wald s formula .",
    "the black hole metric is given by @xmath90 with two integration constants @xmath91 and @xmath92 , where @xmath91 is acknowledged as the black hole mass and @xmath92 is the electric charge .",
    "we can make a gauge choice such that the gauge field @xmath58 vanishes on the horizon . applying wald s formula",
    "we find ( for details , see  @xcite ) @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the electrical potential .",
    "wald s formula gives the standard thermodynamic first law @xmath95 . and like the case in einstein - scalar gravities , @xmath65 is also non - integrable here .",
    "if we assume a boundary condition @xmath96 again , we can integrate out @xmath61 and ( [ re2 ] ) will hold .",
    "following the logic of  @xcite , then the definition of mass ( [ mw ] ) seems valid here .",
    "however , in fact , the result is @xmath97 rather than the acknowledged mass @xmath91 .",
    "the hamiltonian formula and wald s formula definitions of mass have another problem , which is the failure to interpret the entropy of some scalar hairy solutions .",
    "there are two ways to define the entropy of a black hole .",
    "the first is the definition from the thermodynamic point of view .",
    "the variation of the charges of the black hole satisfies a relationship ( here is the wald s formula ) , and if we consider the black hole as a thermodynamic system and interpret this relationship as the thermodynamic first law of the black hole , then there is a term which can play the role of entropy in thermodynamics . and the entropy is given by a simple formula @xmath98 .",
    "this entropy is known as the bekenstein - hawking entropy .",
    "the second definition is from the statistical point of view .",
    "it is widely believed that , a black hole is actually a quantum system with discrete energy levels  @xcite , the total number of states which have the same macroscopic thermodynamic quantities is the exponential of the entropy .",
    "this definition is believed to be the microscopic origin of the first one , thus , both of them should give the same results .",
    "inspired by the principle of holography , the quantum structures of a few black holes , for example the asymptotically @xmath99 black holes  @xcite and extremal kerr black holes  @xcite , have already been studied , and the statistical entropy counted by cardy s formula  @xcite do coincide with the bekenstein - hawking entropy .",
    "however , for more general black holes , it is still extremely hard to study their quantum structures .",
    "in static einstein - scalar gravities , if we define the mass with the hamiltonian formula and wald s formula , the mass @xmath91 is the only charge in the first law .",
    "then the statistical entropy @xmath100 is a function of only @xmath91 , and counts the number of microscopic states which have a the same mass @xmath91 .",
    "however , we find some scalar hairy solutions whose bekenstein - hawking entropy and statistical entropy are not consistent with each other .",
    "this indicates that the definition of mass may be wrong .",
    "the first example is the four - dimensional static spherical soliton solutions in  @xcite ( and in sec .",
    "we set @xmath101 and give different initial values for @xmath102 , then numerically solve the equations of motion .",
    "we get a series of soliton solutions ( not black holes with @xmath101 ) which can be described by the soliton line ( the solid black line ) in fig.([f1 ] ) .",
    "if we choose this soliton line as the boundary condition and define @xmath103 as the variation along this line , we should have @xmath104 , since all the solutions on this line have no horizon .",
    "thus wald s formula ( [ fl ] ) gives @xmath105 this indicates the masses @xmath61 of all the solitons are the same . as the soliton line goes through the ( 0,0 ) point on ( @xmath81 ) plane , which is the pure vacuum @xmath106 spacetime when there is no horizon , all the solitons are massless ( if we define the @xmath106 vacuum as massless ) .",
    "on one hand , the massless solitons have no horizon , hence no bekenstein - hawking entropy .",
    "while on the other hand , the number of states ( or soliton solutions ) with zero mass is absolutely more than one , thus their statistical entropy @xmath107 should be nonzero .",
    "the inconsistence of the two entropies implies that the definition of mass given by wald s formula might be wrong .",
    "another example is given by some 3-dimensional scalar hairy solutions constructed in  @xcite .",
    "theories ( [ lag ] ) with scalar potentials    [ v1 ] @xmath108    admit massless ( according to the hamiltonian formula and wald s formula ) black hole solutions    [ sl1 ] @xmath109    with @xmath110 a positive constant which marks different theories and @xmath111 the only integration constant which describes the scalar hair . the boundary conditions , which are chosen as the asymptotic behavior of these solutions , preserve all the ads symmetries .",
    "we want to point out that solutions described by ( [ sl1 ] ) only represent a line in the space of solutions . with these boundary conditions",
    ", we can integrate ( [ mw ] ) and get the mass defined by wald s formula @xmath112 .    just like the previous soliton solutions , the two entropies are inconsistent .",
    "there is an integration constant @xmath111 which is not related to the mass , which means the massless state is degenerate ( this conclusion is also made in  @xcite ) and should have a non - zero statistical entropy . on the other hand ,",
    "these black hole solutions all have vanishing horizon , thus , have vanishing bekenstein - hawking entropy @xmath113 .    _ to solve this entropy problem , we need another quantity to determine the macroscopic thermodynamic properties of these solutions , which we call a scalar charge_. then we find that the mass depend on the scalar hair , in such a way that these solutions are not all indistinguishable massless black holes .",
    "the existence of the scalar charge has already been discussed not only in asymptotically ads spacetimes  @xcite , but also in asymptotically flat spacetimes  @xcite .",
    "the authors of these papers assume the existence of such a charge because their definitions of mass are different from the hamiltonian formula and wald s formula , and the thermodynamic analysis need the scalar field to play the role as a charge .",
    "for example , consider again the four - dimensional theory in section [ ss ] .",
    "if we define the amd mass  @xcite @xmath114 as the right mass ( as in  @xcite ) , then the variation of the non - integrable mass @xmath61 ( or @xmath115 ) can be expressed as @xmath116 with @xmath114 given by @xmath117 this looks just like the non - integrable @xmath65 ( [ mw2 ] ) of the rn black holes .",
    "it is thus natural to consider the second term of the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ ni1 ] ) as a contribution from a scalar charge @xmath118 ( we will give another definition of the scalar charge later ) .",
    "wald s formula ( [ fl ] ) , then gives the familiar first law @xmath119 this have the same formula as the first law of electrically charged rn black holes .",
    "one interesting fact is that , as mentioned in  @xcite , when the boundary conditions preserve all the ads symmetries ( see ( [ boundarycondition ] ) ) , the contribution from the scalar charge @xmath120 in ( [ sc1 ] ) vanishes .",
    "we can see this directly from ( [ ni1 ] ) and get @xmath121 .",
    "it seems that these special boundary conditions makes @xmath65 integrable and trustful , however in these cases the boundary conditions are also chosen before we calculate the mass , so @xmath61 still depends on the integration path .",
    "the non - integrability of @xmath65 not only happens in such einstein - scalar gravities and rn - black holes , but also in many other gravities coupled to other matter fields  @xcite .",
    "_ these theories clearly show that when there exist charges which are not the noether charge of any diffeomorphisms of spacetime along killing vectors , the integral ( [ mw ] ) would be non - integrable_. comparing with these theories , assuming the existence of a scalar charge is reasonable .",
    "another reason to assume the existence of the scalar charge @xmath122 is that , the full space of solutions has two independent integration constants , so it is hard to believe that energy is the only charge . if the scalar charge @xmath122 exists , the macroscopic thermodynamic properties of the solutions should be described by two parameters @xmath91 and @xmath122 , so the entropy @xmath123 would count the microscopic states which have mass @xmath91 and scalar charge @xmath122 .",
    "we will see this entropy can be consistent with the bekenstein - hawking entropy .",
    "before we give a new definition of mass , we need to define the scalar charge first .",
    "since there is no symmetry corresponding to this charge , it can not be defined as a noether charge , thus , there may be some ambiguities to define the scalar charge . here",
    "we define the scalar charge @xmath122 as the coefficient of the leading term of the large @xmath86 expansion of the scalar field @xmath124    it is quite natural to define the scalar charge in this way .",
    "first , @xmath14 is an independent integration constant which describes the scalar hair .",
    "second , when @xmath125 the scalar field vanishes everywhere , and also the contribution of the scalar field in @xmath65 vanishes . at",
    "last , unlike the definition in ( [ sc1 ] ) , when we take @xmath14 as the scalar charge , its contribution in @xmath65 has the standard form of a charge contribution @xmath126 , where we define the coefficient of @xmath127 multiplied by @xmath128 as the conjugate potential @xmath129 .",
    "as mentioned in  @xcite , this scalar charge is not conserved .",
    "we can not construct a conserved current from a scalar field the way we construct the bianchi identity from the gauge fields . in  @xcite the free energy of some exact scalar hairy black - holes has been calculated and compared with the free energy of the corresponding schwarzschild ads black holes at the same temperature .",
    "the results show that the schwarzschild ads black hole solutions are always thermodynamically preferred , which means the scalar hairy black holes will always decay into schwarzchild ads black holes at last .",
    "this is not surprising as we have mentioned that the scalar charge is not conserved .",
    "we now show a class of 3-dimensional scalar hairy soliton like solutions ( the metric is regular everywhere , while the scalar field has a @xmath130 divergence at the origin ) constructed in  @xcite .",
    "these solutions have a manifest scalar charge term in the thermodynamic first law .",
    "the lagrangian ( [ lag ] ) with a scalar potential    [ v2 ] @xmath131 - 81\\cosh[2 \\psi]-6(7+\\cosh[4 \\psi])\\big \\ } , \\\\ & \\psi=\\frac{\\phi}{2\\sqrt{6}},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    admits the following solutions    [ sl2 ] @xmath132    again , these solutions are not the whole space of solutions , and in fact on a integral path when we integrate @xmath65 . applying wald s formula",
    "we get the surface integral on the boundary @xmath133 and also the surface integral on the infinitesimal ball around the origin @xmath134 the non - vanishing of the integral ( [ s0 ] ) usually would not happen in higher dimensions , but is possible in 3-dimensions as we can see . as the solutions have no event horizon , the integral ( [ s0 ] ) can not be interpreted as @xmath56 , so we interpret it as a contribution from scalar charge @xmath120 instead .",
    "this charge term is not an integral on the boundary , so even if we can accept a non - integrable mass , it can not be absorbed by @xmath65 .",
    "hence this scalar charge term is always manifest in the first law @xmath135    it may be inappropriate to call this equation a thermo- dynamic first law , since there is no entropy , so the solution is not a thermodynamic system .",
    "it describes how the other charges change with the scalar hair .",
    "the existence of these solutions gives further evidence for the existence of the scalar charge .",
    "in section [ pro ] we discussed the problems of the masses defined by the hamiltonian formula and wald s formula .",
    "they all define the mass on a variational level , and the results are non - integrable when matter fields are included . choosing an integral path ,",
    "@xmath65 can be integrated and give a finite mass , however this mass depends on the integral path ( or the boundary condition ) we choose .",
    "the entropy problem of some solutions also indicates the masses defined in these formulas are not right .",
    "we think wald s formula is not used properly by giving the definition of mass ( [ mw ] ) . in this section ,",
    "based on wald s formula , we propose a new way to define the mass for theories including matter fields .",
    "we first need to find out why the variation of mass calculated by ( [ mw ] ) becomes non - integrable when we include matter fields with charges , which are not the noether charge of any diffeomorphism of spacetime along killing vectors .",
    "again we use the electrically charged rn - ads black holes ( [ rn ] ) as an example .",
    "_ unlike the energy @xmath91 and angular momentum @xmath136 , the electric charge @xmath92 is not a noether charge associated to a killing vector in spacetime , instead , its existence and conservation is the result of an internal @xmath137 gauge symmetry .",
    "when we calculate @xmath65 , we have chosen @xmath54 , thus other charges , for example the angular momentum @xmath136 , which generate spacetime deffeomorphisms will not arise . this chosen of @xmath47 equals to stop the rotation of the solution , however , it is not enough to stop the internal gauge transformations . as a result ,",
    "the variation of electric charge @xmath138 will arise in the integration @xmath65 , thus makes it nonintegrable_. this can be seen clearly in ( [ mw2 ] ) .",
    "the scalar charge we defined generates no transformations , so the arising of @xmath127 in @xmath65 will also happen , as we can see from the previous sectors",
    ".    the right mass should be totally independent from not only charges like @xmath136 which generate spacetime diffeomorphisms , but also charges like @xmath92 which are not attached to a spacetime killing vector .",
    "hence , when we calculate the variation of the mass , we should not only stop the other spacetime deffeomorphisms , but also the internal gauge transformations .",
    "in other words , charges like @xmath92 and @xmath122 should be considered as pure numbers without variation when we calculate the mass .    although the hamiltonian formula and wald s formula directly constructed the hamiltonian , which seems to make their definitions of mass beyond controversy .",
    "however , they both define the mass on a variational level , which means we still have room to do some modification before we ruin physical fact that the mass is the hamiltonian . following the arguments above",
    ", the modification is to remove the contributions from the variations of all other charges , which are not associate to a killing vector , by hand .",
    "this can be done by defining a variation @xmath139 which act only along the mass . by definition",
    "we have @xmath140 for the electrically charged rn - ads black holes . the contribution from @xmath138",
    "will be removed if we define the variation of the mass as @xmath141 , which is given by @xmath142 so after we confine the @xmath143 in ( [ mw ] ) to be @xmath139 , wald s formula can give the right mass @xmath91 for these rn black holes .",
    "_ we now arrive at our new definition of mass @xmath144 , @xmath145 with the variation @xmath139 only along along @xmath144 in the space of solutions_.    it is quite natural to define the mass in this way , because it uses the fact that the hamiltonian should be a totally independent charge .",
    "after we integrate @xmath146 , the result @xmath144 is in fact the real hamiltonian .    to test this new definition ,",
    "we can use it to calculate the mass of the scalar hairy black holes . for these black holes , as we do not agree with the mass defined by the hamiltonian formula and wlad s formula , we do not know what the real mass is before calculation .",

    "usually the result @xmath161 is also different from @xmath114 .",

    "although we modified the definition of mass , but the holding of wald s formula ( [ fl ] ) is always a mathematical fact for on - shell spacetimes and would give the thermodynamic first law . replacing @xmath139 with the general variation @xmath143 , the second line in ( [ deltahgen ] )",
    "is just @xmath65 .",
    "thus , wlad s formula gives @xmath167 with the conjugate potential @xmath129 given by @xmath168    the 3-dimensional massless black holes described by ( [ v1 ] ) and ( [ sl1 ] ) have a scalar mass @xmath169 which is outside ( [ md ] ) , but the solutions ( [ sl1 ] ) can still be described by ( [ sle ] ) and do not contain any logarithmic functions , so the general analysis above is still valid here .",

    "using our definition of mass ( [ nm ] ) , we see the solutions ( [ sl1 ] ) are actually massive black holes , and their masses are related to the scalar hair . as we have introduced a new macroscopic quantity for these black holes ,",
    "the statistical entropy @xmath172 now counts the number of micro states with a mass @xmath144 and a scalar charge @xmath122 .",
    "the solution ( [ sl1 ] ) with @xmath173 is now unique , and could be considered as a quantum state , thus have a vanishing statistical entropy . which is now consistent with its bekenstein - hawking entropy .",
    "this solves the entropy problem we presented in section [ pro ] .",
    "the newly defined mass @xmath144 is integrable and does not have the entropy problem mentioned above .",
    "the requirement fot the variation @xmath143 in ( [ mw ] ) to be @xmath139 is based on the fact that the mass should be an independent charge of the solution .",

    "our definition ( [ nm ] ) is in fact consistent with the spirit of wald s construction .",
    "the hamiltonian formula can also be modified in this way as it also defines the mass on a variational level .",
    "although the initial motivation of this paper is to give a well defined mass for asymptotically ads einstein - scalar gravities , our new definition of mass is valid for much more general gravities .",
    "the only requirements for the application of our definition can be conclude as : _ a ) , the solution should admit @xmath175 as a killing vector ; b ) , all the terms in wald s formula should be finite ; c ) , all the independent charges can be identified . _",
    "consider , in general , a gravity coupled to matter fields @xmath176 with charges @xmath177 which generate internal symmetry transformations and also matter fields @xmath178 with charges @xmath179 which do not generate any symmetry transformation ( for example the scalar charge we defined ) .",
    "further more , if the killing vector @xmath180 of solution have components along other directions of spacetime , there will be charges @xmath181 which generate the spacetime diffeomorphisms along those directions ( for example , the angular momentum ) .",
    "wald s formula gives a relationship between the variations of all charges , and when the black hole can be considered as thermodynamic system , wald s formula can be recognised as the thermodynamic first law .",
    "the @xmath177 and @xmath181 charges are noether charges and can be determined by the solution , while the @xmath179 charges are not .",
    "we need to give proper definitions for these @xmath179 charges the way we define the scalar charges . for a solution with all the charges mentioned above , and after some legendre - like transformations , wald s ( [ fl ] ) formula",
    "could be written in the following formula @xmath182 where the total variation @xmath183 is expected to depend on an extra integration constant which is independent from all the other charges ( for example , the parameter @xmath85 in ( [ deltahgen ] ) ) , and may also depend on the other charges .",
    "also we would find that @xmath65 becomes non - integrable and can be written as @xmath184 terms proportional to @xmath185 would not appear in @xmath65 because we have chosen @xmath54 .",
    "it should be pointed out that , if we make another gauge choice that the gauge fields @xmath176 vanishes asymptotically on the boundary , rather than on the horizon , the contributions from @xmath186 in @xmath65 will be moved to the surface integral on the horizon . for example , consider again the rn - ads black holes , the surface integrals now becomes @xmath187 this changing of gauge choice may solve the non - integral mass problem of the rn black holes in some sence ; however , this would not work for the scalar charges .    following ( [ nm ] ) we get @xmath188 where we have apply @xmath189 and @xmath190 .",
    "this means @xmath191 .",
    "these general analysis can be checked by looking at the results of some recent papers  @xcite . using wald s formula , these papers study the thermodynamic first law of gravities coupled to matter fields with both @xmath177 and @xmath179 type of charges . and the first laws they get are all consistent with ( [ fl ] ) .",
    "ads dyonic black holes in gauged supergravities are constructed in  @xcite with one pair of electric and magnetic charges , and in  @xcite with more pairs of charges .",
    "the scalar fields in their solutions are totally determined by the electric and magnetic charges .",
    "this means the solutions in both  @xcite and  @xcite are in fact not the full solutions . in our opinion ,",
    "their scalar charge have been settled down and does not present as an independent integration constant . facing a non - integrable hamiltonian",
    ", authors of  @xcite admit the existence of the scalar charge and take the amd mass as the mass . while authors of  @xcite think the mass is ill defined and does not exist , unless additional consistent boundary conditions are given by hand , which coincide with the mass defined on boundary conditions  @xcite .",
    "we do not agree with both of them , because the requirements of the amd method are not fully satisfied and the mass defined on the boundary conditions also have problems we presented in sec . [",
    "according to the ads / cft  @xcite correspondence , the @xmath40-dimensional cft generating functional of correlation functions for some operator @xmath192 is equivalent to the partition function of a gravity in @xmath193 background with some specific boundary conditions .",
    "the einstein - scalar gravities ( [ lag ] ) with a boundary condition @xmath82 is dual to a cft with some kind of multi - trace deformation  @xcite .    consider a cft with a general multi - trace deformation @xmath194 @xmath195 with @xmath196 the dual operator of the scalar field and @xmath194 a general function of @xmath196 .",
    "when the scalar mass satisfies @xmath197 , either the @xmath14 and @xmath15 mode are normalizable , thus , we can take either @xmath14 and @xmath15 as the source @xmath198 .",
    "if we take @xmath199 , then the deformed cft ( [ deformedcft ] ) is dual to the einstein - scalar gravity with the following boundary condition @xmath200    as the boundary condition is determined by the boundary cft ( [ deformedcft ] ) and is added by hand in gravity , it seems a little unnatural to impose a boundary condition when someone only look at the gravity side . a more comforting way to interpret",
    "a boundary condition is to give additional special boundary terms ( which is also determined by the boundary cft ) to the action of the gravity , thus the boundary condition is the solution of the boundary equations of motion  @xcite . from this point of view , the same gravity with different boundary conditions are actually different gravities .",
    "hence one would expect that a specific black hole would have different masses when its variation is confined by different boundary conditions , because the actions changes .",
    "following the spirit of this paper , we also propose a way to calculate the mass in a gravity with holography ( or with additional boundary conditions ) .",
    "we should start from the new gravity action with the additional special boundary terms .",
    "the additional boundary terms may change the symplectic structure of the theory , thus give a different mass if we use our definition of mass proposed in sec .",
    "[ newmass ] .",
    "we can not guarantee the validity of our definition of mass in this situation .",
    "the gravity with boundary conditions is still a subtle topic of gravity , since the boundary conditions can not be naturally generated from only the gravity side .",

    "<S> this implies the macroscopic thermodynamic properties of the scalar hairy black holes should be described by one more charge beside the mass , which we call a scalar charge . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the non - integrability of mass will always arise when the matter fields have charges which is not associate to any diffeomorphisms of spacetime . </S>",
    "<S> we find the mass becomes non - integrable just because wald s formula is used in a wrong way . </S>",
    "<S> based on wald s formula and the existence of the scalar charge , we propose a new definition for mass , with the modification that we require the variation of the hamiltonian to have no contribution from the variation of the other charges . </S>",
    "<S> this new definition is also valid for much more general gravities coupled to matter fields with other charges . </S>"
