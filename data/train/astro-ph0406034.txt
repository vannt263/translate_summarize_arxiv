    "subhaloes serve as hosts for visible galaxies within clusters , groups , or larger galaxies , and so provide a powerful and observable cosmological probe . in cases where dark matter subhaloes may have no luminous counterparts , the substructure population can be inferred from gravitational lensing studies ( e.g.  mao & schneider 1998 ; metcalf & madau 2001 ; chiba 2002 ; dalal & kochanek 2002 ; mao et al .",

    "2004 ; see however diemand , moore & stadel 2004b ) .",
    "however , observations measure roughly an order of magnitude fewer subhaloes in galactic haloes than in clusters ( klypin et al .  1999",
    "; moore et al .",
    "thus , mass is either more smoothly distributed on small scales than predicted by @xmath0cdm cosmology , or galactic dark matter subhaloes are poorly traced by stars .",
    "an element of uncertainty in the comparisons with @xmath0cdm model predictions is the possibility of significant halo to halo variation in the subhalo population that could depend on host mass , merging history , or environment .",
    "results from the handfull of high - resolution simulations on galactic scales to date suggest that such variance in substructure numbers are significant but much too small to account for the apparent discrepancy in galactic subhaloes ( e.g.  moore et al .",
    "1999 ; klypin et al .  1999 ; font et al .",

    "; however see also kazantzidis et al .",
    "2004 and willman et al .",
    "2004 ) , then the non - detection of the vast majority of small subhaloes remains an unsolved problem .",
    "however , semi - analytic work suggests that baryonic physics causes small haloes to remain starless , indicating that observations may be consistent with the @xmath0cdm model ( e.g.  bullock , kravtsov & weinberg 2000 ; benson et al .",
    "2002ab ; somerville 2002 ) .    by analysing substructure in a large number of dark matter haloes",
    ", we can measure the range of halo to halo variation , and better constrain the uncertainty in the @xmath0cdm subhalo distribution with the improved statistics . with better numerical resolution and a broad range in host halo masses ,",
    "substructure can be used to place cosmological constraints at new mass scales .",
    "furthermore , detailed dark matter simulations provide a theoretical @xmath0cdm baseline to link subhalo properties with observable galaxy characteristics",
    ". the conditional luminosity function , which describes the number of galaxies of luminosity @xmath9 in hosts of a given mass , can be combined with simulated subhalo populations in order to associate subhalo properties with observable characteristics ( yang , mo & van den bosch 2003 ; van den bosch , yang & mo 2003 ; see further vale & ostriker 2004 ) .",
    "this allows one to investigate the impact of baryonic physics on the galaxy distribution .",
    "our simulation set is more sensitive to possible dependence of the subhalo population on host halo mass or redshift than previous works .",
    "consequently , we can improve constraints on whether substructure properties are a function of @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the characteristic mass of collapsing haloes defined by the scale at which the rms linear density fluctuation equals the threshold for non - linear collapse .",
    "one might expect that because low - mass haloes were mostly assembled much earlier when the universe was more dense , are at smaller @xmath10 , and lie where the power spectrum of mass fluctuations is steeper , that they might have significantly different subhalo distributions than more massive haloes . if subhaloes within low - mass and low - redshift haloes have a higher characteristic density ( see e.g.  reed et al .",
    "2005 and references therein ) , then they should be less subject to tidal stripping and disruption . additionally ,",
    "if the infall rate on to the host halo ( i.e.  merger rate ) is different from the rate of subhalo destruction , then subhalo numbers will evolve with redshift .",
    "the angular momentum of a cosmic ( sub)halo is crucial to determine the radial distribution of its eventual stellar component ( e.g.  mo , mao & white 1998 ; verde , oh & jimenez 2002 , van den bosch et al .  2002 ) and its collapse factor compared to the parent dark matter halo ( stoehr et al .",
    "if high angular momentum material is systematically stripped from subhaloes this would further inhibit the formation of stellar discs in dense environments consistent with observations ( e.g.  goto et al .",
    "also , a high collapse factor of the baryonic component would make the velocity dispersions of the stars eventually formed lower than that associated with the parent halo .",
    "this would exacerbate the apparent difference between the observed abundance of galaxy satellites and the predicted abundance of their host haloes , as discussed in detail in stoehr et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and kazantzidis et al .",
    ".    the angular momentum of the dark matter component of a subhalo will be relevant to its stellar properties only if star formation continues after infall and tidal stripping , which requires that sufficient baryons remain in the subhalo .",
    "while one generally expects much of a subhalo s gas to be stripped upon infall , some of that gas may also be able to cool and form stars .",
    "complex processes such as starbursts after infall and redistribution of baryonic angular momentum under tidal influences may affect the final spin of the baryonic component .",
    "simulations predict starbursts will occur in gas - rich satellites as they are tidally stirred by the central potential ( e.g.  mayer et al .",
    "2001 ) , which may explain the continuing star formation in galactic satellites .",
    "however , a better understanding of post - infall star formation is needed to determine whether the angular momentum of the stellar component is correlated with that of the dark matter component .",
    "subhaloes are particularly sensitive to resolution issues ( e.g.  moore , katz & lake 1996 ) .",
    "dark matter haloes , and by extension , subhaloes , have densities that continually increase toward the halo centre , and so should be very difficult to disrupt completely unless numerical discreteness effects artificially lower the central density . a subhalo with a numerically softened cusp is more easily disrupted by the global tidal forces and interactions with other subhaloes that strip away the outer regions .",
    "poor spatial resolution and two body relaxation lowers central densities , and so may lead to subhalo destruction , especially near host halo centres .",
    "simulated clusters may generally suffer more from resolution issues than galaxies because of their later formation epoch , which means that cluster particles will have spent more time in low mass haloes ( diemand et al .",
    "also , subhaloes with highly eccentric orbits are more likely to be disrupted since they pass near to the central potential .    in this work",
    ", we present the results of substructure analyses of 16 @xmath0cdm simulated haloes covering three decades in mass , from dwarfs to clusters , each with roughly a million particles .",

    "volume - renormalized haloes are selected by mass with the only additional constraint that they not lie within close proximity ( @xmath15 ) to a halo of similar or larger mass .",
    "then , the initial conditions routine is run again to add small - scale power to a region made up of high resolution particles that end up within approximately two virial radii of the halo centre , while preserving the original large scale random waves .",

    "the flattened slope of the radial subhalo distribution of grp1 subhaloes relative to the mass profile interior to roughly 0.2@xmath46 for our highest resolution , and interior to 0.3@xmath46 for our lowest resolution implies that disruption and/or stripping of subhaloes is important in the halo central region .",

    "thus , at large @xmath10 , where the mass function is steep , the subhalo mas function should also be steep .",
