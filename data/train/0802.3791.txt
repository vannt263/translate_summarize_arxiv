    "driven by the need of gravitational wave data analysis for waveform templates , numerical relativity has focused in recent years on the modelling of astrophysical sources of gravitational waves such as the inspiral and coalescence of compact objects .",
    "such systems do not possess any symmetries and thus require a fully @xmath0 dimensional numerical code .",
    "the advantage of assuming a spacetime symmetry , on the other hand , is that it allows for a dimensional reduction of the einstein equations , which reduces the computational effort considerably so that greater numerical accuracy can be obtained . while spherical or planar symmetry yields the greatest reduction in computational cost , the intermediate case of axisymmetry is more interesting in that it permits the study of gravitational waves .    in this article",
    "we focus on vacuum axisymmetric spacetimes and assume that the killing vector is hypersurface orthogonal so that there is only one gravitational degree of freedom .",
    "the axisymmetric einstein equations can be simplified considerably by choosing suitable gauge conditions . here",
    "we consider a combination of maximal slicing and quasi - isotropic gauge @xcite .",
    "this gauge reduces the number of dependent variables to such an extent that only one pair of evolution equations corresponding to the one gravitational degree of freedom needs to be kept .",
    "all the other variables can be solved for using the constraint equations and gauge conditions .",
    "this _ fully constrained _ approach was taken in @xcite . _",
    "partially constrained _ schemes ( e.g. , @xcite ) substitute some of the constraint equations with evolution equations ; this is possible because the einstein equations are overdetermined .",
    "such ( fully or partially ) constrained schemes have proven very robust in simulations of strong gravity phenomena .",
    "examples include the collapse of vacuum axisymmetric gravitational waves , so - called brill waves @xcite , in @xcite .",
    "critical phenomena in this system were found in @xcite .",
    "critical phenomena in the collapse of massless scalar fields @xcite and complex scalar fields with angular momentum @xcite were also studied , as was the collapse of collisionless matter @xcite .    nevertheless , constrained evolution schemes have been plagued with problems .",
    "the authors of @xcite reported that their multigrid elliptic solver failed occasionally for the hamiltonian constraint equation in the strong - field regime .",
    "this problem can be circumvented by using instead the evolution equation for the conformal factor .",
    "however , it was found that this was `` not sufficient to ensure convergence in certain brill - wave dominated spacetimes '' .",
    "similar difficulties were encountered in @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this article is to determine the cause of these problems and to develop an improved constrained evolution scheme .",
    "the suspect elliptic equations belong to a class of ( nonlinear ) helmholtz - like equations , which are discussed quite generally in section [ s : ell ] .",
    "we point out that if these helmholtz equations are _ indefinite _ ( loosely speaking , they have the `` wrong sign '' ) then their solutions , should they exist , are potentially nonunique .",
    "the same criterion is found to be related to the convergence of numerical solvers based on classical relaxation methods .    in section [",
    "s : formulation ] , we review the partially constrained scheme of @xcite and the fully constrained scheme of @xcite . we show that some of the elliptic equations in these formulations are indefinite .",
    "this leads us to the construction of a modified fully constrained scheme that does not suffer from this problem .",
    "the arguments involved turn out to be closely related to questions of ( non)uniqueness in conformal approaches to the initial data problem in standard @xmath0 numerical relativity @xcite .",
    "a numerical implementation of the new fully constrained scheme is described in section [ s : nummethod ] . in section [ s :",
    "numresults ] , we apply it to a study of brill wave gravitational collapse . after performing a convergence test and comparing results for a strong wave with `` spherical '' initial data , we focus on a highly prolate configuration  one of the initial data sets examined in @xcite . by considering sufficiently prolate configurations ,",
    "the authors were able to construct initial data without an apparent horizon but apparently with arbitrarily large curvature .",
    "they conjectured that such initial data would evolve to form a naked singularity rather than a black hole .",
    "this would constitute a violation of weak cosmic censorship .",
    "a numerical evolution of one of these prolate initial data sets was carried out in @xcite . due to a lack of resolution on their compactified spatial grid",
    ", the authors could not evolve the wave for a sufficiently long time .",
    "the trends in certain quantities suggested however that an apparent horizon would eventually form .",
    "using our new constrained evolution scheme , we are able to evolve the same initial data for much longer and we confirm that an apparent horizon does form .    we conclude and discuss some open questions in section [ s : concl ] .",
    "let us first consider the _ helmholtz equation _",
    "@xmath1 where @xmath2 , @xmath3 is the flat - space laplacian , and @xmath4 and @xmath5 are smooth functions .",
    "we impose the boundary condition @xmath6 at spatial infinity .",
    "more generally , a boundary condition @xmath7 can always be transformed to this case by considering the function @xmath8 .",
    "it follows from standard elliptic theory ( see e.g.  @xcite ) that has a unique solution if @xmath9 everywhere . if @xmath10 then multiple solutions may exist or there may not be any solution at all . for @xmath10 the elliptic equation is said to be _",
    "next we consider the quasilinear equation @xmath11 where @xmath12 is a smooth ( not necessarily linear ) function . proving existence and uniqueness of solutions to this equation is nontrivial .",
    "however a necessary condition for uniqueness can easily be obtained .",
    "suppose @xmath13 is a given solution and consider a small perturbation of it , @xmath14 .",
    "approximating @xmath15 where @xmath16 , we find that for @xmath17 to be a solution of , @xmath18 must satisfy @xmath19 this is of the form with @xmath20 and @xmath21 . if @xmath22 then there is only the trivial solution @xmath23 and we call the original problem _ linearization stable_.",
    "if on the other hand @xmath24 then multiple solutions of the linearized problem and hence also of the nonlinear problem may exist .",
    "as an example relevant to the formulations of the einstein equations discussed in this article , we take @xmath25 with @xmath26 and @xmath4 a smooth function . then is linearization stable provided that @xmath27 .",
    "we say that in this case the equation has the `` right sign '' .    because of the above considerations on the uniqueness of solutions , it is clearly desirable to have an equation with the `` right sign '' if a numerical solution is attempted .",
    "there is however also a more practical reason .",
    "consider again the linear helmholtz equation in , say , @xmath28 dimensions .",
    "suppose we cover the domain with a uniform cartesian grid with spacing @xmath29 , denoting the value of @xmath17 at the grid point with indices @xmath30 by @xmath31 .",
    "a discretization of using second - order accurate centred finite differences yields @xmath32 we formally write this system of linear equations as @xmath33 large systems are commonly solved using relaxation methods , which obtain a series of successively improved numerical approximations .",
    "for example , a step of the _ gauss - seidel _ method consists in sweeping through the grid ( typically in lexicographical or in red - black order ) , at each grid point @xmath30 solving the equation for @xmath31 and replacing its value , @xmath34 the relaxation converges provided the matrix @xmath35 in is _ strictly diagonally dominant _",
    ", i.e. , in each row of the matrix the absolute value of the diagonal term is greater than the sum of the absolute values of the off - diagonal terms ( see e.g.  @xcite ) . in our example , the diagonal term is @xmath36 and the off - diagonal terms add up to @xmath37 , so that the condition for convergence is @xmath38 .",
    "( the other possibilty , @xmath4 large and positive , is not feasible because @xmath39 in the continuum limit . ) in practice , if @xmath4 is positive but sufficiently small then the relaxation will still converge but as @xmath4 is increased convergence will begin to stall and ultimately the relaxation will diverge .",
    "similar convergence criteria hold for other relaxation schemes such as the jacobi or sor methods .",
    "in particular , the multigrid method @xcite is based on these relaxation schemes and will not converge if the underlying relaxation does not .",
    "these warnings do not apply to certain versions of the conjugate gradient method @xcite or other krylov subspace iterations which ideally only require the matrix @xmath35 to be invertible . for a combination of such methods with multigrid see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "we focus on axisymmetric vacuum spacetimes .",
    "axisymmetry means that there is an everywhere spacelike killing vector field @xmath40 with closed orbits .",
    "here we restrict ourselves to the case where the killing vector is hypersurface orthogonal .",
    "we choose cylindrical polar coordinates @xmath41 such that @xmath42 . in the following , indices @xmath43 range over @xmath44 , indices @xmath45 over @xmath46 , and indices @xmath47 over @xmath48 .",
    "the line element is written in the form @xmath49      + r^2 \\rmd \\phi^2 \\}.\\ ] ] here @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the usual adm lapse function and shift vector .",
    "we have imposed as a gauge condition that the 2-metric on the @xmath52 hypersurfaces be conformally flat in our coordinates ( quasi - isotropic gauge ) : the spatial metric obeys @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "this condition must be preserved by the evolution equation for the spatial metric , @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the extrinsic curvature of the @xmath57 surfaces and @xmath58 denotes the lie derivative .",
    "we deduce that @xmath59 where @xmath60 .",
    "maximal slicing @xmath61 is imposed , so that the extrinsic curvature has three degrees of freedom , which are taken to be @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 ( this particular combination is motivated by regularity on the axis of symmetry @xcite ) .",
    "the evolution equation for the extrinsic curvature is given by @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the covariant derivative compatible with the spatial metric @xmath67 and @xmath68 is its ricci tensor .",
    "preservation of the maximal slicing condition implies @xmath69 ( using the hamiltonian constraint for the second equality ) or @xmath70 = 0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here and in the following we use the notation @xmath71    there are many different ways of constructing an evolution scheme for the axisymmetric einstein equations in the above gauge , depending on the number of constraint equations being solved .",
    "we review two schemes that have been used for numerical simulations and show that some of their elliptic equations are indefinite as discussed in the section [ s : ell ] .",
    "finally we propose a new scheme that does not suffer from this problem .",
    "garfinkle and duncan @xcite choose to solve only the hamiltonian constraint equation @xmath72 ( note that @xmath73 ) , which takes the form @xmath74 \\nonumber\\\\ + { { \\textstyle \\frac{1}{4}}}\\psi^5 \\rme^{2rs } \\left [       { { \\textstyle \\frac{1}{3}}}(u + { { \\textstyle \\frac{1}{2}}}r w)^2 + { { \\textstyle \\frac{1}{4}}}(r w)^2 + ( { { k^z{}_r}})^2      \\right ] = 0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this equation is of the type , with @xmath75 and @xmath76 ( note the second square bracket in is non - negative ) .",
    "hence it has the `` wrong sign '' and suffers from potential nonuniqueness of solutions as well as difficulties in solving it numerically using relaxation methods ( section [ s : ell ] ) .",
    "the latter is not a concern in @xcite though because the authors use a conjugate gradient method .",
    "the momentum constraints @xmath77 are not solved but only monitored during the evolution . written out",
    "explicitly they are @xmath78 the extrinsic curvature variables @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath79 are all evolved using their time evolution equations @xcite .    the slicing condition is solved in the form , and this is a helmholtz equation with the `` right sign '' ( @xmath9 in ; note the square bracket in is non - negative ) .    in order to solve for the shift vector , additional derivatives are taken of equations , which combine to two decoupled second - order equations , @xmath80 these are poisson equations ( @xmath81 in ) and do not cause any problems .",
    "a similar formulation was developed by choptuik @xcite .",
    "their definition of the variables @xmath82 and @xmath83 differs slightly from our @xmath84 and @xmath83 , @xmath85 where the subscript ch refers to @xcite .",
    "this difference does not have any consequences on the properties of the elliptic equations that we are concerned with here and so for the sake of consistency we continue to use our convention ( which agrees with the one in @xcite ) . as a result",
    "the equations displayed below differ from those in @xcite in a minor way .",
    "in the same way as garfinkle and duncan , choptuik also solve the hamiltonian constraint , which is again indefinite .",
    "unlike garfinkle and duncan , however , they also solve the momentum constraints .",
    "this is done by replacing @xmath62 and @xmath63 with first derivatives of the shift using the gauge conditions .",
    "the momentum constraints now read @xmath86 the principal part of these two coupled equations is elliptic and so far there is no need for concern .",
    "a problem arises however when equations are substituted in the slicing condition , @xmath87 \\nonumber\\\\      + { \\textstyle \\frac{2}{3 } } \\psi^4 \\rme^{2rs } \\beta_-",
    "r w - { { \\textstyle \\frac{1}{2}}}\\psi^4      \\rme^{2rs } \\alpha ( rw)^2 = 0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the term containing the square bracket has the `` wrong sign '' , @xmath88 and @xmath9 in , .",
    "we observed that in both of the above schemes , the hamiltonian constraint was indefinite , and in the second one , the slicing condition was , too .",
    "we now present a scheme in which both equations and in fact all the elliptic equations that are being solved are definite .",
    "the hamiltonian constraint can be cured by rescaling the extrinsic curvature variables with a suitable power of the conformal factor , @xmath89 in terms of the new variables , the exponent of @xmath83 multiplying the second square bracket in is @xmath90 so that the equation becomes definite for @xmath91 .",
    "there is a preferred choice : for @xmath92 the terms containing derivatives of @xmath83 in the momentum constraints all cancel under the substitution .",
    "the same rescaling of the extrinsic curvature was applied by abrahams and evans @xcite .",
    "their scheme is however not fully constrained  the extrinsic curvature variables are evolved as in @xcite .",
    "the indefiniteness of the slicing condition was caused by the substitution , more precisely by its @xmath50 dependence .",
    "the original motivation for this substitution was the desire to be able to solve the momentum constraints .",
    "however we can still do this as before if we introduce a new vector @xmath93 and set @xmath94 the momentum constraints are then solved for @xmath93 .",
    "the price we have to pay is that we still need to solve the spatial gauge conditions , where now @xmath62 and @xmath63 are expressed in terms of @xmath95 .",
    "that is , we have to solve two more elliptic equations than choptuik .",
    "let us now write out all the elliptic equations explicitly .",

    "can be regarded as a decoupled scalar elliptic equation , or elliptic system in the case of . the terms in the second lines of and now have the `` right signs '' .",
    "an exception common to all the schemes discussed in this section is the term multiplying @xmath83 in the first line of in general one expects @xmath84 to oscillate so that @xmath100 can have either sign .",
    "this is the usual difficulty one faces in conformal formulations of the initial value equations , see section [ s : cts ] .",
    "the variable @xmath84 and its `` time derivative '' @xmath101 are evolved .",
    "this pair of evolution equations corresponds to the one dynamical degree of freedom . note that if we had not restricted the killing vector to be hypersurface orthogonal then there would be a second dynamical degree of freedom .",
    "in linearized theory these two degrees of freedom can be understood as the two polarization states of a gravitational wave .",
    "there are additional evolution equations for @xmath83 , @xmath102 and @xmath103 that are not actively enforced but that can be used in order to test the accuracy of a numerical implementation .",
    "all the evolution equations are given in [ s : evolutionequations ] .",
    "here we remark that assuming a solution to the elliptic equations is given , the principal part of the evolution equations is that of a wave equation , @xmath104 ^ 2 s    \\simeq \\psi^{-4 } \\rme^{-2rs } ( s_{,rr } + s_{,zz}),\\ ] ] where @xmath105 denotes equality to principal parts .",
    "this equation is clearly hyperbolic , a necessary criterion for the well posedness of the cauchy problem .",
    "see also @xcite for a recent analysis of the hyperbolic part of a fully @xmath0 dimensional constrained evolution scheme based on the dirac gauge .",
    "our discussion of different constrained evolution schemes for the axisymmetric einstein equations is closely related to conformal approaches to solving the initial value equations in standard @xmath0 dimensional spacetime .",
    "here one seeks to find a spatial metric @xmath67 and extrinsic curvature @xmath56 satisfying the constraint equations on the initial slice , and often also a lapse @xmath50 and shift @xmath106 satisfying suitable gauge conditions .",
    "this is done by setting @xmath107 where @xmath83 is the conformal factor , and the conformal metric @xmath108 is assumed to be given . for simplicity and for analogy with the axisymmetric formulations discussed above , we impose the gauge condition @xmath109 .",

    "we also assume maximal slicing @xmath73 throughout , and we work in vacuum .    it is well known in the conformal approach that the extrinsic curvature @xmath56 can not be freely specified @xcite ; instead it has to be conformally rescaled , @xmath111 this corresponds to the proposed rescaling of the extrinsic curvature variables in the new axisymmetric scheme .",
    "the hamiltonian constraint now takes the form of the lichnerowicz equation , @xmath112 where @xmath113 is the covariant laplacian and @xmath114 the ricci scalar of the conformal metric @xmath108 .",
    "note again that the last term in has the `` right sign '' for linearization stability , cf .  .",
    "as pointed out in the previous subsection , the linear term @xmath115 can have either sign .",
    "however , @xmath116 does not _ necessarily _ imply that multiple solutions exist .",

    "any gauge conditions are solved _",
    "after _ a solution of the constraint equations has been found .",
    "for example , maximal slicing @xmath122 implies the following elliptic equation for the conformal lapse @xmath123 , @xmath124 where is substituted .",
    "this equation has the `` right sign '' , as it has in the new axisymmetric formulation and in the one by garfinkle and duncan .",
    "in contrast , the _ extended conformal thin sandwich _",
    "( xcts ) method @xcite directly expresses the extrinsic curvature in terms of the shift @xmath106 , @xmath125 instead of . as a result , the slicing condition acquires the wrong sign .",
    "this is precisely what happens in the scheme by choptuik , cf .   and .",
    "remarkably , a numerical study of the xcts equations @xcite showed that this system does admit nonunique solutions .",
    "two solutions were found for small perturbations of minkowski space , one of them even containing a black hole .",
    "the two branches meet for a certain critical amplitude of the perturbation .",
    "this parabolic branching was explained using lyapunov - schmidt theory in @xcite . because of the similarity with the xcts equations , it is conceivable that the constrained axisymmetric formulation of choptuik @xcite might show a similar branching behaviour .",
    "this is clearly undesirable for numerical evolutions because the elliptic solver might jump from one solution branch to the other during the course of an evolution .",
    "however even before this can happen the multigrid method used in @xcite will fail to converge , as explained in section [ s : ell ] .",
    "in this section we describe a numerical implementation of the new fully constrained scheme presented in section [ s : orscheme ] .",
    "the equations are discretized using second - order accurate finite differences in space .",
    "a collection of the finite difference operators we use can be found in [ s : discretization ] . similarly to @xcite , and unlike @xcite , we use a _ cell - centred _ grid to cover the spatial domain @xmath126 \\times [ 0 , z_\\mathrm{max}]$ ] : grid points are placed at coordinates @xmath127 , @xmath128 , where @xmath129 is the grid spacing and @xmath130 is the number of grid points in the @xmath131 direction .",

    "these finer grids are also surrounded by ghost points . on grid boundaries that do not coincide with a `` physical '' boundary",
    ", ghost point values are interpolated from the coarser grid @xcite .",
    "the boundary conditions at @xmath139 follow from regularity on axis ( see @xcite for a rigorous discussion ) : either a dirichlet or a neumann condition is imposed depending on whether the variable is an odd or even function of @xmath131 .",
    "all the equations being solved ( both the elliptic equations and the evolution equations ) are regular on the axis provided that these boundary conditions are satisfied .",

    "this condition is only exact for the scalar wave equation in spherical symmetry .",

    "the classic adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) algorithm by berger and oliger @xcite was designed for hyperbolic equations . including elliptic equations in this approach",
    "is rather complicated . a solution with numerical relativity applications in mind",
    "was suggested by pretorius and choptuik @xcite , and we shall use their algorithm here , with minor modifications due to the fact that our grids are cell centred rather than vertex centred .",
    "the key idea of the algorithm is that solution of the elliptic equations on coarse grids is deferred until all finer grids have reached the same time ; meanwhile the elliptic unknowns are linearly extrapolated in time and only the evolution equations are solved .",
    "we have found that this approach works well as long as no grid boundaries are placed in the highly nonlinear region . in particular",
    ", adaptive generation of finer grids in the course of the evolution causes small but noticeable reflections that from our experience make the study of problems such as brill wave critical collapse unfeasible . for this reason",
    ", the evolutions presented in this article use _ fixed _ mesh refinement ( fmr ) , i.e.  the grid hierarchy is defined at the beginning of the simulation and remains unchanged as time evolves .",
    "finally we briefly discuss how an apparent horizon is found in a @xmath57 slice .",
    "the horizon is parametrized as a curve @xmath161 in spherical polar coordinates . requiring the expansion of the outgoing null rays emanating from the horizon to vanish yields a second order ordinary differential equation , which is solved using the shooting method .",
    "the boundary conditions are @xmath162 , i.e. , the horizon has no cusps on the axes .",
    "we follow an idea of garfinkle and duncan @xcite in order to monitor the approach to apparent horizon formation .",

    "obviously @xmath168 for an apparent horizon , and the deviation from this value indicates how close we are to the formation of an apparent horizon .",
