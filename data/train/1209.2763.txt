    "we first note that @xmath10 can be constrained uniquely around the above two specific cases ( @xmath328 for @xmath57 , or @xmath329 for @xmath58 ) , since not only the wrong mass hierarchy assumption gives non - negligible local @xmath15 as given in fig .",
    "[ fig : cp - t2kn ] ( d ) and fig .",
    "[ fig : cp - t2ki ] ( b ) , but also the wrong hierarchy assumption favors the right @xmath10 , with slightly larger ( smaller ) fitted @xmath47 that compensate for the matter effect for the normal ( inverted ) hierarchy . the @xmath330 error shown by the red dotted contour is rather large , however , about @xmath331 . in all the other cases ,",
    "the presence of the wrong hierarchy solutions as shown by blue contours significantly reduce the capability of measuring @xmath10 with 2kn .",
    "more importantly , even if we can remove the wrong hierarchy by other experiments such as nova @xcite , the next generation reactor neutrino oscillation experiments @xcite , or by an atmospheric neutrino observation with a huge detector @xcite , the 2kn experiment with only one baseline length can not measure @xmath10 with high accuracy when @xmath332 , or suffers from the @xmath333 solution when @xmath334 or @xmath276 as can be seen from the separate red contour islands on the ( a ) and ( c ) plots in figs .",
    "[ fig : cp - t2kn ] and [ fig : cp - t2ki ] .    throughout the analysis of this and the previous sections we fix the oab at sk at @xmath1 in order to make the sk contributions to all the three experiments t2ko , t2kk and 2kn identical .",
    "we find that the performance of 2kn slightly improves if the @xmath335 oab is adopted instead , mainly because these fluxes are slightly wider ( harder ) than the @xmath1 oab as shown by red solid curves in figs .",

    "in this paper , we examine physics potential of a one - beam two - detectors neutrino oscillation experiment with an additional 100  kton water detector in oki island , which is located along the t2k beam line at the baseline length of @xmath70  km . together with super - kamiokande ( sk ) at @xmath0  km",
    ", we can measure neutrino oscillations at two different energies for the same oscillation phase proportional to @xmath336 .",
    "we may call this proposal as t2ko ( tokai - to - kamioka - and - oki ) , whose capability has been compared with t2kk ( tokai - to - kamioka - and - korea ) with @xmath317  km for the far detector in korea , and also with 2kn where the same 100  kton detector is placed at the sk site ( @xmath0  km ) .    as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : t2oki1 ] , since the oki island is located in the east side of the t2k beam center , just like the sk , the off - axis angle at oki island increases as that at sk increases , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : relation ] . the off - axis beam ( oab ) with @xmath3 , @xmath337 , and @xmath4 from j - parc can be observed at oki island , when the @xmath1 , @xmath72 , and @xmath2 oab reaches at sk , respectively .",
    "the neutrino energy of the first oscillation maximum for the @xmath338 and @xmath339 is between 1.0  gev and 1.5  gev , which depend on the cp phase and the mass hierarchy pattern , at @xmath340  km . since the @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) beam between @xmath4 and @xmath3 off - axis angles has significant intensity around these energies , as shown by green dashed lines in the upper six panels in fig .",
    "[ fig : profile ] , we expect that the t2ko experiment can be sensitive to the neutrino mass hierarchy and the cp phase , just like the t2kk experiment @xcite , @xcite-@xcite .    for a detector of 100  kton fiducial volume and @xmath5 pot exposure each for both @xmath6 and @xmath7 beams ,",
    "we find that the t2ko experiment can determine the mass hierarchy pattern at @xmath66 level if @xmath341 is larger than 0.09 , by observing the @xmath209-like ccqe ( charged - current quasi elastic ) events ; see fig .  [ fig : cnt - t2oki ] . this result does not strongly depend on the off - axis angle of the @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) beam at oki island , because the neutrino intensity at the first oscillation maximum does not strongly depend on the off - axis angle at oki island .",
    "the t2ko sensitivity to the mass hierarchy is about @xmath14 ( in @xmath15 ) of the t2kk experiment with the optimum oab combination of @xmath1 at sk and @xmath13 at a far detector in korea with the baseline length around 1000  km .",
    "this is because the factor of two higher sensitivity of the t2kk over the t2ko experiment as shown by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : ae_diffs ] ) and ( [ eq : be_diffs ] ) , which should give a factor of 4 in @xmath15 is partially compensated by the smaller average flux by a factor of ( 635  km/1000  km)@xmath342 at a far detector in korea .",
    "the sensitivity of the mass hierarchy pattern of the 2kn experiment , where a 100  kton detector is added at the sk location , is almost zero , except around @xmath297 ( @xmath18 ) for the normal ( inverted ) hierarchy ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : mass2 ] .    the cp phase in the mns ( maki - nakagawa - sakata ) lepton flavor mixing matrix @xcite , @xmath10 can be measured with @xmath11 error for all the four cases at @xmath29 , @xmath343 , and @xmath276 , almost independent of the @xmath47 values @xcite as long as the neutrino mass hierarchy is determined .",
    "this is because @xmath144 can be constrained by the difference between the magnitudes of the oscillation probabilities @xmath338 and @xmath339 around the oscillation maximum , whereas @xmath117 can be determined by the oscillation phase around the first oscillation maximum , or the location of the oscillation peak(s ) ; see eqs .",
    "( [ eq : aeaprox ] ) and ( [ eq : diff_ae ] ) .",
    "the sensitivity to the cp phase , @xmath10 , of the t2ko experiment is similar to that of the t2kk experiment , mainly because the smallness of the flux at t2kk is compensated by its capability to measure the second oscillation peak at @xmath344 when the sensitivity to both @xmath117 and @xmath144 is a factor of 3 higher than that around the first peak ; see eqs .",
    "( [ eq : abeapprox ] ) .",
    "the 2kn option , which may be regarded as a first step toward the hyper - kamiokande @xcite , can not generally determine @xmath10 , mainly because it can not resolve mass hierarchy by itself .",
    "only when @xmath345 for the normal hierarchy ( see , fig .",
    "[ fig : cp - t2kn ] ( d ) ) and when @xmath329 for the inverted hierarchy ( see , fig .",
    "[ fig : cp - t2ki ] ( b ) ) , the constraints for both hierarchy assumptions overlap , and the cp phase can be determined uniquely . even if the mass hierarchy is determined by other experiments @xcite ,",
    "@xcite-@xcite the sensitivity to @xmath10 is rather poor at 2kn as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : cp - t2kn ] and [ fig : cp - t2ki ] .",
