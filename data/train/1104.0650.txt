    "the latter can be extracted from the momentum distributions of the finally emitted particles .",
    "the efficiency with which the geometric deformation and fluctuating inhomogeneities in the initial density distribution are converted into final flow anisotropies is controlled by the viscosity of the expanding fluid . for a given source deformation ,",
    "ideal fluid dynamics generates the largest flow anisotropy ; it corresponds to the limit of zero mean free path and instantaneous thermalization , which allows for the largest possible collective response , via final state interactions , to irregularities in the geometric structure of the fireball @xcite .",
    "viscosity accounts for finite interaction cross sections and non - zero mean free paths which reduce the amount of flow anisotropy that can be generated from a given geometric deformation .",

    "[ f14 ] ) with @xmath39 ( solid green circles ) one sees that in mid - central to peripheral collisions the @xmath2-suppression from event - by - event hydrodynamic evolution is of the same order as or ( especially for protons ) even larger than the difference between @xmath49 and @xmath39 ( solid blue vs. solid green circles ) that arises from event - by - event flow fluctuations . as a result ,",
    "@xmath49 from event - by - event hydrodynamics lies in peripheral collisions even below @xmath38 from single - shot hydrodynamics , in spite of its fluctuation - induced enhancement .",
    "similar to eqs .",

    ".  [ f3 ] , both the gaussian and bessel - gaussian hypotheses for @xmath2-fluctuations are seen to hold quite well in mid - central ( @xmath205fm ) collisions .",
    "the bessel - gaussian hypothesis breaks down in peripheral collisions ( @xmath206fm ) . whether it holds ( as expected @xcite ) in central collisions is a question that , with our present statistics of 1000 events per @xmath101-value , we can not reliably answer , but we see no indications for the opposite .",
    "the assumption of gaussian @xmath2-fluctuations breaks down in central collisions ( @xmath207fm ) , as expected . for the mc - glauber model it also breaks down in very peripheral collisions , whereas for mc - kln initial conditions the final elliptic flow exhibits a nice gaussian distribution all the way to the largest impact parameters .",
    "overall , a comparison of figs .",
    "[ f15 ] and [ f3 ] ( as well as of figs .",
    "[ f14 ] and [ f1 ] ) shows that the statistical properties of @xmath2 fluctuations are qualitatively similar but quantitatively different from those of the initial ellipticity fluctuations .",
    "this is consistent    , but for the elliptic flow @xmath2 of pions and protons .",
    "see text for discussion . [ f15 ] ]    with the fact that the main driver for elliptic flow is the initial ellipticity , but that eccentricity coefficients of higher harmonic orders affect the evolution of @xmath2 weakly but measurably through non - linear mode - coupling effects .",
    "in this work we presented a comprehensive analysis of event - by - event shape fluctuations in the initial state and flow fluctuations in the final state of relativistic heavy - ion collisions , as quantified by the first four non - trivial harmonic eccentricity and flow coefficients , @xmath75 and @xmath4 ( @xmath208 ) . using the mc - glauber and mc - kln models to generate fluctuating initial entropy and energy density profiles , we explored the centrality dependence of a number of different variants of these anisotropy measures that are being used by practitioners in the field , and compared them with each other .",
    "although they all exhibit similar qualitative behaviour , quantitative differences exist and must be carefully taken into account in the theoretical analysis of experimental data . as far as we know , ours is the first comprehensive analysis quantifying these differences for both the glauber and color glass condensate models .",
    "we list a few key results :     the average and mean ellipticities @xmath209 and @xmath210 agree with excellent accuracy over a wide range of impact parameters , but diverge in very peripheral collisions ( @xmath211 centrality ) where @xmath212 ( both for participant - plane and reaction - plane averaged profiles ) .     the average energy and entropy density weighted eccentricities agree with excellent accuracy over a wide range of impact parameters , except for central collisions ( @xmath213fm ) where @xmath214 .",
    " whether the fluctuating entropy density distributions for individual events are first converted to energy density and then rotated by @xmath187 and averaged , or first rotated by @xmath183 and averaged and then converted to energy density has very little influence on the shape of the resulting smooth average initial energy density profile for single - shot hydrodynamics .",
    "we prefer ( and propose as standard procedure ) the conversion to energy density as the first step , since in event - by - event hydrodynamics the energy density gradients of each event generate ( through the eos ) the pressure gradients that drive the evolution of collective flow .",
    " the shortcut of using reaction - plane averaging to generate a smooth profile for single - shot hydrodynamics with ellipticity approximately equal to @xmath55 of the ensemble , in the hope of generating with a single hydrodynamic run an elliptic flow @xmath38 that can be directly compared with @xmath50 measurements , works only in the @xmath215 centrality range . for peripheral collisions",
    "this method can not be trusted .    ",
    "the assumption of bessel - gaussian fluctuations for initial source ellipticity and final elliptic flow work well for @xmath121fm but breaks down in more peripheral collisions . for more peripheral collisions",
    "the hypothesis that @xmath20 and @xmath2 are gaussian distributed works better than the bessel - gaussian assumption , but it breaks down for @xmath207fm . for mc - glauber initial conditions ,",
    "directly emitted pions and protons feature negative values of @xmath203 in very peripheral collisions .",
    "the fluctuations of initial source ellipticities and final elliptic flow values have qualitatively similar but quantitatively different statistical properties .    ",
    "except for rather central collisions , the eccentricities @xmath58 , @xmath216 and @xmath217 from the mc - kln model are all significantly larger than those from the mc - glauber model .",
    "in contrast , @xmath218 is numerically very similar for the two models over most of the impact parameter range .",
    "the viscous suppression of triangular flow @xmath96 may thus allow for a determination of the qgp shear viscosity @xmath219 that is free from the large model uncertainties that arise from the different mc - glauber and mc - kln ellipticities when using @xmath2 for such an extraction @xcite .    ",
    "the second and fourth order eccentricities @xmath20 and @xmath139 are strongly correlated by collision geometry , and @xmath151 receives strong contributions even from a purely elliptical deformation of the final flow velocity distribution .",
    "these complications make @xmath151 a poor candidate for systematic studies of viscous effects on the evolution of collective flow .",
    "similar comments apply to @xmath148 since it couples via mode - coupling to triangularity from fluctuations and to ellipticity from collision geometry .",
    "this mixture of contributions from conceptually different origins complicates a systematic analysis . in general ,",
    "flow coefficients @xmath4 of high harmonic order ( @xmath220 ) show poor correlation with the eccentricity coefficients @xmath75 of the same harmonic order , except for very central collisions where all eccentricities are driven by fluctuations alone ( and not by overlap geometry ) .",
    " in spite of non - linear mode - coupling effects , the basic response of elliptic flow @xmath2 to ellipticity @xmath20 , and of triangular flow @xmath96 to triangularity @xmath137 , is approximately linear .",
    "these two observables thus remain prime candidates for systematic studies of viscous effects on collective hydrodynamic flow .",
    " event - by - event hydrodynamics generates harder @xmath91-spectra for the emitted hadrons than single - shot hydrodynamic evolution of the corresponding averaged initial profile .",
    "this is due to additional radial flow generated by large pressure gradients arising from `` hot spots '' in the initial fluctuating density distribution .",
    "the hardening effect is particularly strong in peripheral collisions which produce small fireballs that fluctuate strongly .",
    " event - by - event hydrodynamic evolution of fluctuating initial conditions leads to smaller average elliptic flow than obtained by evolving the corresponding averaged initial condition in a single shot .",
    "this suppression depends somewhat on collision centrality , and for ideal fluids it is generically of order 4 - 5% for pions and 8 - 10% for protons .",
    "the effect is sufficiently large to lead to a significant over - estimate of the fluid s specific shear viscosity if one extracts it from elliptic flow measurements by comparing with single - shot hydrodynamic simulations . even though we expect the discrepancy between event - by - event and single - shot hydrodynamics to decrease a bit in viscous fluid dynamics",
    ", we believe that a quantitatively precise experimental determination of @xmath190 from collective flow data will require comparison with event - by - event hydrodynamical calculations .",
    "we here present a brief comparison between the @xmath7-weighted eccentricity coefficients @xmath75 ( eq .  ( [ eq15 ] ) ) and the @xmath72-weighted @xmath76 ( eq .  ( [ eq15 ] ) ) , as well as their associated angles @xmath78 and @xmath223 . fig .  [ f16 ] shows a scatter plot of @xmath76 vs. @xmath75 for @xmath224 .",
    "one observes approximate proportionality ( @xmath225 , @xmath226 , @xmath227 ) over most of the eccentricity range , with slopes that increase with @xmath32 .",
    "so where fig .",
    "[ f5 ] shows a decrease of @xmath75 with increasing @xmath32 at large impact parameters , the same is not true for the @xmath76 @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the linear relations between @xmath76 vs. @xmath75 imply that the relations between @xmath4 and @xmath76 will look qualitatively the same as those between @xmath4 and @xmath75 in fig .",
    "[ f9 ] , with appropriately rescaled horizontal axes .    at the same time",
    "the participant plane angles associated with @xmath7-weighted and @xmath72-weighted eccentricities are tightly correlated , as shown in fig .",
    "[ f17 ] . for given @xmath32 , the angles @xmath78 and @xmath223 fluctuate around each other , with a variance that increases with @xmath32 , on account of the decreasing values of @xmath75 . from a practical point of view",
