    "with the launch of _ bepposax _  and _ rxte _ , long - term monitoring of low - mass x - ray binaries became feasible .",
    "one fruit of this was the discovery of superbursts : these have a rapid rise and long decay , analogous to type i x - ray bursts , but are roughly a thousand times more energetic @xcite .",
    "the recurrence time is of order a year ; for one source , 4u  1636@xmath2 , two superbursts were observed separated by 4.7@xmath3@xmath4  @xcite .",
    "although most superbursts are observed at mass accretion rates 0.10.3@xmath3@xmath5 , @xmath6 being the eddington accretion rate , recently @xcite detected superbursts from the rapidly accreting source gx  17@xmath7 .    despite their similarities to type i x - ray bursts ,",
    "the fuel for the superbursts was not immediately apparent .",
    "@xcite had originally investigated the thermal stability of a pure @xmath8 layer and found that such a layer would unstably ignite when the accumulated mass was @xmath9 .",
    "this produces a very energetic burst , @xmath10 , with a recurrence time of @xmath11 .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that carbon flashes with greatly reduced recurrence times could occur on a neutron star ( ns ) accreting pure he at a _ locally _ super - eddington rate , such as might happen on an accreting x - ray pulsar .",
    "this explanation did not fit the observed superbursts because none of the sources showed pulsations in the persistent emission and , with the exception of 4u  1820@xmath12 , all were thought to accrete a h / he mixture that burned to matter with @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggested a resolution to this puzzle .",
    "they noted that only a small @xmath8 mass fraction @xmath14 is sufficient to produce a thermonuclear runaway , and that the reduced conductivity of a heavy element mixture ( e.g. , 0.9:0.1 @xmath15:@xmath8 ) would produce a steeper thermal gradient for a fixed flux emergent from the deeper crust .",
    "the flux from the deep crust is powered by electron captures , neutron emissions and pycnonuclear reactions @xcite that release roughly 1.4@xmath3@xmath16@xmath17  per accreted nucleon ; the outward - directed luminosity from the deep core is roughly @xmath18 , for steadily accreting nss with modified urca neutrino cooling in their cores @xcite . here",
    "@xmath19  is the mean nucleon mass . under these conditions",
    ", superbursts would ignite for an accumulated mass @xmath20 , which is consistent with the observed energetics and recurrence times .",
    "the superbursts observed from gx  17@xmath7 are consistent with this scenario @xcite .    in this letter , we calculate the thermal structure of the entire crust using a range of core neutrino emissivities and crust thermal conductivities .",
    "the flux in the carbon - enriched layer is not fixed , but increases with @xmath21 , where @xmath22  and @xmath23  are the mean nuclear mass and squared nuclear charge of the carbon - enriched layer . as a result",
    ", the temperature at which superbursts ignite is relatively insensitive to the dominant isotope formed during h / he burning .",
    "furthermore , the temperature of this layer is sensitive to the nature of the thermal conductivity and neutrino emissivity of the deep crust and core . as a result ,",
    "the superburst properties  recurrence times , energies , and cooling times  open a new view into the interior physics of nss , complementary to observations of isolated cooling neutron stars ( for a recent review , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and soft x - ray transients @xcite .",
    "in particular , the observed energetics and recurrence times agree with the scenario of @xcite only if the nuclei in the ns crust are disordered or amorphous .",
    "to calculate the crust thermal structure , we use the method outlined in @xcite with a few modifications .",
    "first , we take the core neutrino emissivity as a free parameter , rather than compute it self - consistently for a given equation of state ( eos ) .",
    "this is because our goal is to study the crust thermal structure for a given _ average _ core neutrino emissivity . to simplify our calculations",

    "* and references therein ) . with this choice for the eos , the ns s mass @xmath29 and redshift @xmath30 specify its mechanical structure .",
    "we locate the crust - core boundary by a maxwell construction using an eos for the inner crust @xcite and the core @xcite , which gives the transition density @xmath31 .    with the core mass and radius specified , we compute the structure of the crust by integrating the general relativistic equation of hydrostatic balance from @xmath32 to @xmath33 .",
    "we then solve the thermal equations @xmath34 by a relaxation method @xcite . here",
    "@xmath35 and @xmath36 denote proper values and @xmath37 .",
    "the condition at the crust / core boundary is @xmath38 : the heat conducted into the core must be re - radiated as neutrinos . at a column depth @xmath39 we set @xmath40 , in accordance with estimates for mixed h / he ignition @xcite .",
    "the crust thermal profile is controlled by the eos , the volumetric neutrino emissivity @xmath41  and nuclear heating rate @xmath42 , and the thermal conductivity @xmath43 .",
    "the crust eos has contributions from degenerate , relativistic electrons , for which we use a tabulation of the helmholtz free energy @xcite ; from ions , for which we use the free - energy fits of @xcite ; and from free neutrons , for which we use a compressible liquid - drop model @xcite .",
    "the neutrino emission in the inner crust is dominated by neutrino pair bremsstrahlung @xcite , for which we use the rate calculated by @xcite . as in @xcite",
    ", we do not resolve the reaction layers in the deep crust , but instead use a distributed @xmath42   normalized so that the total luminosity from the deep crust reactions is @xmath44 .",
    "heat is conducted by electrons , and the thermal conductivity is given by the wiedemann - franz law , with the conductivity proportional to an electron - ion relaxation time @xmath45 , for which we use the fitting formula of @xcite , in the mean - ion approximation .",
    "a substantial uncertainty in computing the transport coefficients of the crust is its composition . during the lifetime of a low - mass binary , it is possible to replace a substantial portion of the @xmath46 crust .",
    "the accreted hydrogen and helium burn via the rp - process @xcite ; both steady - state @xcite and time - dependent , one - zone @xcite calculations predict that the ashes are a broad distribution of ions peaking with @xmath47 .",
    "recent calculations of one - dimensional models of episodic accretion and unstable h / he ignition for a range of accretion rates and metallicities find that repeated bursts drive the mean weight of the ashes to @xmath48 @xcite . for definiteness",
    ", we use the compositional profile of @xcite , which presumes that the ashes of h / he burning have @xmath47 ; in the inner crust the composition is similar , however , to that of @xcite , which assumed the ashes of h / he burning are @xmath49 .    as pointed out by @xcite",
    ", the composition of the carbon - enriched layer can have a strong effect on the temperature profile . in this layer",
    "the ions are not crystallized and the conductivity scales roughly as @xmath21 . as a result , one would expect a steeper gradient for a heavier ion mixture and a given flux .",
    "the flux is not fixed , however , and must be determined self - consistently .",
    "figure  [ fig : z2ascale ] shows the luminosity emergent from the crust for different values of @xmath50 in the layer @xmath51 .",
    "the connected squares mark the results of the calculations ; the solid line indicates the slope @xmath52 .",
    "the luminosity is scaled by a fiducial value , @xmath53 , and the numbers beside each line indicate the accretion rate @xmath54 .    to understand why the thermal gradient depends weakly on the composition of the layer below the h / he burning shell ,",
    "consider a simple two - zone model of the crust , with the heating from the pycnonuclear reactions at the interface between two zones .",
    "when most of the heat generated in the crust flows into the core , the maximum temperature in the crust , and therefore the thermal gradient between the h / he burning layer and the electron capture layers , is roughly fixed .",

    "the superburst ignition temperature depends weakly on the composition of the carbon - enriched layer .",
    "_ at lower accretion rates and smaller @xmath50 , this simple argument weakens , as the luminosity in the outer layers becomes a larger fraction of @xmath56 . for use in future computations",

    "this is for a crust with low thermal conductivity . ]",
    "to explore the effects of the core and crust microphysics on the carbon ignition , we choose a core model with @xmath65 and @xmath66 , which implies that @xmath67 and @xmath68 . here",
    "@xmath69 is the fiducial nuclear density . again following @xcite",
    ", we use two cases of the core neutrino emissivity .",
    "the first case is @xmath70 throughout the core .",
    "this corresponds to a modified urca process somewhat suppressed by superfluidity . for the second case , we add an enhanced emissivity @xmath71 for @xmath72 .",
    "this models the operation of an enhanced neutrino emissivity from , e.g. , a direct urca process above a density threshold @xcite .",
    "these choices change the core temperature by an order of magnitude for a given accretion rate : the proper temperature at the base of the crust is @xmath73 for the first case and @xmath74 for the second .",
    "the core temperature is insensitive to the exact value of the density threshold .",
    "in addition to the neutrino emissivity of the core , we also choose two cases for the crust thermal conductivity .",
    "calculations of the ionic state of the crust usually presume a single - species lattice , with possible impurities .",
    "the actual crust is formed , however , from the processing of rp - process ashes , and it is not known if the ions form an ordered lattice .",
    "we therefore pick two cases for comparison .",
    "first , that the lattice is disordered ; we estimate the electron - ion relaxation time @xmath45 by setting the structure factor to unity ( see * ? ? ?",
    "in this case @xmath75 is independent of @xmath35 and proportional to @xmath50 . for the second case ,",
    "we compute @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is the frequency of electron - phonon scattering and @xmath78 is the frequency of electron - impurity scattering @xcite , for which we set @xmath79 .",
    "this is typical of the rp - process ashes , but it is larger than that of matter burned in a superburst @xcite or formed at the birth of the neutron star @xcite .",
    "the thermal profiles for these four cases are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mdot0.3 ] for @xmath80 ( approximately  eddington ) and fig .",
    "[ fig : mdot1.0 ] for @xmath81 ( approximately eddington ) .",
    "the solutions with the higher core temperatures are for modified urca processes ; the ones with lower core temperatures for direct urca processes . for each core temperature",
    "there are two profiles , one for a disordered , amorphous crust ( _ solid lines _ ) and one for an impure lattice ( _ dotted lines _ ) .",
    "the squares mark the point at which we estimate unstable ignition to occur . to define ignition",
    ", we use the criteria from @xcite and set @xmath82 , where @xmath83  is the mass - specific heating rate from the reaction @xmath84 , @xmath85 is an estimate of the cooling rate , and @xmath86 is the ratio @xmath87 .",
    "this simple approach gives us a rough estimate of where ignition occurs and is known for x - ray bursts to give results that are roughly in line with numerical simulations @xcite and linear stability analyses @xcite . for the @xmath84  rate , we use the formula of @xcite and incorporate strong screening according to @xcite .    .",
    "the squares indicate where a mixture with @xmath88 would unstably ignite .",
    "the solid lines are for the crust thermal conductivity dominated by scattering ; the dotted lines indicate a conductivity that is a mix of phonon and impurity scattering . the solutions with higher core temperatures correspond include only modified urca processes ; the solutions with a cold core temperature include in addition an enhanced neutrino emission . ]    for @xmath89 , the recurrence times for @xmath84  ignition are , from the hottest profile to the coldest , 1.4 , 3.0 , 5.1 , and 28@xmath3@xmath4  with total burst energies of @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 and @xmath93 , respectively .",
    "likewise , for @xmath94 , the recurrence times are 0.08 , 0.10 , 0.30 , and 1.4@xmath3@xmath4  and the total burst energies are @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 , and @xmath98 .",
    "_ neutron stars with enhanced neutrino cooling are not compatible with observed superburst recurrence times and energetics unless the crust is amorphous",

    "but for @xmath100 . ]",
    "using parameterized models of the ns core , we have computed ignition conditions for @xmath8 that solve for the flux emergent from the inner crust .",
    "there are two principal conclusions .",
    "first , the flux in the carbon - enriched layer scales roughly as @xmath21 , so that the superburst ignition is only weakly dependent on the composition of that layer .",
    "second , we confirm the scenario of @xcite , but only if the crust thermal conductivity is low .",
    "in particular , the calculated recurrence times are too long if there is _ both _ enhanced core neutrino emission _ and _ the crust thermal conductivity is set by phonon and impurity scattering .",
    "this is relevant not only to studies of neutron star cooling , but also to studies of the magnetic field evolution of the crust ( for a recent study , see * ? ? ?",
    "in addition to the recurrence time and burst energetics , the cooling of the ns atmosphere , as evidenced by the quenching of subsequent type i x - ray bursts , can be used to infer @xmath101 , the column depth of the superburst ignition @xcite .",
    "the ignition curve , as estimated in ",
    "[ sec : results ] , gives a unique temperature @xmath102 . using this information",
    "thus reduces the uncertainty from the poorly constrained mass accretion rate . from fig .",
    "[ fig : mdot0.3 ] , @xmath101 differs by a factor of 34 between different crust models for a core with only modified urca processes .    perhaps the most intriguing superburst source is ks  1731@xmath1 @xcite , for which there are independent estimates of the interior temperature and crust thermal conductivity .",
    "this source was observed to be persistent for @xmath103 until it suddenly went into quiescence @xcite .",
    "@xcite noted that because of its long outburst , the crust would be driven out of thermal equilibrium with the core , and therefore follow - up observations of the quiescent x - ray luminosity would measure the thermal relaxation of the crust .",
    "such observations @xcite revealed a rapid and strong decline of the x - ray luminosity .",
    "if the quiescent emission is solely powered by the cooling crust , this sharp decrease in the quiescent luminosity suggests that the crust has a high thermal conductivity , consistent with being a locally pure lattice , and that the neutrino emission from the core is stronger than modified urca .",
    "the calculations in this paper , being steady - state , are not directly applicable to ks  1731@xmath1 , but do indicate that the low quiescent emission , combined with the occurrence of a superburst , are a challenge to our understanding of accreting neutron stars ."
