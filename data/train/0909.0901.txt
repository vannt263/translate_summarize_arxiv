    "when purchasing information , one wants to be sure of the quality of the information in question .",
    "however , if one is not an expert oneself in the relevant domain , assessing the quality of information can be difficult .",
    "for the sellers of information ( which we will simply refer to as `` the consultants '' ) this provides an incentive for dishonesty .",
    "after all , gaining real expertise costs significant efforts as well as time and money .",
    "however , if the consumer of information ( which we will refer to as `` the client '' ) has difficulties assessing the quality of the provided information , then why not pretend to have a higher level of expertise than one actually has ?",
    "as long as the chance that the client detects this dishonesty is low , a consultant can charge the same price for his advice , yet spend less resources on maintaining up - to - date of the state of the art .",
    "moreover , the more consultants decide to take it easy , the less likely it is that the clients will find out about it .",
    "this is because once a critical mass of consultants gives ill - informed advice , it becomes more and more difficult for the clients to obtain the kind of well - informed advice that they need in order to detect the ill - informedness of the other advice .",
    "this implies that once a critical mass of low expertise consultants has become established , the incentive for consultants to take it easy will increase , since the chance of discovery has decreased .",
    "the issue of low quality information has been studied in @xcite . what is new , however , is that we have now developed a software simulator that is able to assess the pay - off for the consultants of either a strategy of hard work or a strategy of taking it easy when it comes to staying up to date with the state of the art .",
    "in particular , we are able to provide qualitative insight on which strategy yields the most profitable results under which circumstances .",
    "the aim of this section is to examine how argumentation can play a role to examine the concept of informedness , which can be seen as background theory for the remaining , more practical part of this paper .    in standard epistemic logic ( s5 )",
    ", informedness is basically a binary phenomenon .",
    "one either has knowledge about a proposition @xmath0 or one does not .",
    "it is , however , also possible to provide a more subtle account of the extent to which one is informed about the validity of proposition @xmath0 .",
    "suppose alex thinks that hortis bank is on the brink of bankruptcy because it has massively invested in mortgage backed securities .",
    "bob also thinks that hortis is on the brink of bankruptcy because of the mortgage backed securities .",
    "bob has also read an interview in which the finance minister promises that the state will support hortis if needed .",
    "however , bob also knows that the liabilities of hortis are so big that not even the state will be able to provide significant help to avert bankruptcy .",
    "from the perspective of formal argumentation @xcite , bob has three arguments at his disposal .",
    "+ @xmath1 : hortis bank is on the brink of bankruptcy , because of the mortgage backed securities .",
    "+ @xmath2 : the state will save hortis , because the finance minister promised so .",
    "+ @xmath3 : not even the state has the financial means to save hortis . + here , argument @xmath2 attacks @xmath1 , and argument @xmath3 attacks @xmath2 ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : reinstatement ] ) . in most approaches to formal argumentation , arguments @xmath1 and @xmath3 would be accepted and argument @xmath2 would be rejected .",
    "@xmath4 assume that alex has only argument @xmath1 to his disposal",
    ". then it seems to regard bob as more informed with respect to proposition @xmath0 ( `` hortis bank is on the brink of bankruptcy '' ) since he has a better knowledge of the facts relevant for this proposition and is also in a better position to defend it in the face of criticism .",
    "the most feasible way to determine whether someone is informed on some given issue is to evaluate whether he is up to date with the relevant arguments and is able to defend his position in the face of criticism .",
    "one can say that agent @xmath5 is more informed than agent @xmath6 if it has to its disposal a larger set of relevant arguments .",
    "we will now provide a more formal account of how the concept of informedness could be described using formal argumentation . an _ argumentation framework _",
    "@xcite is a pair @xmath7 where @xmath8 is a set of arguments and @xmath9 is a binary relation on @xmath8 .",
    "an argumentation framework can be represented as a directed graph .",
    "for instance , the argumentation framework @xmath10 is represented in eq .",
    "[ eq : reinstatement ] .",
    "arguments can be seen as defeasible derivations of a particular statement .",
    "these defeasible derivations can then be attacked by statements of other defeasible derivations , hence the attack relationship .",
    "given an argumentation framework , an interesting question is what is the set ( or sets ) of arguments that can collectively be accepted .",
    "although this question has traditionally been studied in terms of the various fixpoints of the characteristic function @xcite , it is equally well possible to use the approach of argument labelings @xcite .",
    "the idea is that each argument gets exactly one label ( accepted , rejected , or abstained ) , such that the result satisfies the following constraints .    1 .",
    "if an argument is labeled accepted then all arguments that attack it must be labeled rejected .",
    "if an argument is labeled rejected then there must be at least one argument that attacks it and is labeled accepted .",
    "3 .   if an argument is labeled abstained then it must not be the case that all arguments that attack it are labeled rejected , and it must not be the case that there is an argument that attacks it and is labeled accepted .    a labeling is called complete iff it satisfies each of the above three constraints . as an example , the argumentation framework of eq .",
    "[ eq : reinstatement ] has exactly one complete labeling , in which @xmath1 and @xmath3 are labeled accepted and @xmath2 is labeled rejected . in general ,",
    "an argumentation framework has one or more complete labelings .",
    "furthermore , the arguments labeled accepted in a complete labeling form a complete extension in the sense of @xcite . other standard argumentation concepts , like preferred",
    ", grounded and stable extensions can also be expressed in terms of labelings @xcite .",
    "in essence , one can see a complete labeling as a reasonable position one can take in the presence of the imperfect and conflicting information expressed in the argumentation framework . an interesting question is whether an argument _ can _ be accepted ( that is , whether the argument is labeled accepted in at least one complete labeling ) and whether an argument _ has to be _ accepted ( that is , whether the argument is labeled accepted in each complete labeling ) .",
    "these two questions can be answered using formal discussion games @xcite .",
    "for instance , in the argumentation framework of eq .",
    "[ eq : reinstatement ] , a possible discussion would go as follows .",
    "+ proponent : argument @xmath1 has to be accepted . + opponent : but perhaps @xmath1 s attacker @xmath2 does not have to be rejected .",
    "+ proponent : @xmath2 has to be rejected because @xmath2 s attacker @xmath3 has to be accepted .",
    "+ the precise rules which such discussions have to follow are described in @xcite .",
    "we say that argument @xmath1 can be _ defended _ iff the proponent has a winning strategy for @xmath1 .",
    "we say that argument @xmath1 can be _ denied _ iff the opponent has a winning strategy against @xmath1 .",
    "if informedness is defined as justified belief , and justified is being interpreted as defensible in a rational discussion , then formal discussion games can serve as a way to examine whether an agent is informed with respect to proposition @xmath0 , even in cases where one can not directly determine the truth or falsity of @xmath0 in the objective world .",
    "an agent is informed on @xmath0 iff it has an argument for @xmath0 that it is able to defend in the face of criticism .",
    "the dialectical approach to knowledge also allows for the distinction of various grades of informedness .",
    "that is , an agent @xmath5 can be perceived to be at least as informed as agent @xmath6 w.r.t .",
    "argument @xmath1 iff either @xmath5 and @xmath6 originally disagreed on the status of @xmath1 but combining their information the position of @xmath5 is confirmed , or @xmath5 and @xmath6 originally agreed on the status of @xmath1 and in every case where @xmath6 is able to maintain its position in the presence of criticism from agent @xmath11 , @xmath5 is also able to maintain its position in the presence of the same criticism .",
    "when @xmath12 and @xmath13 are argumentation frameworks , we write @xmath14 as a shorthand for @xmath15 , and @xmath16 as a shorthand for @xmath17 . formally , agent @xmath5 is at least as knowledgeable about argument @xmath1 as agent @xmath6 iff :    1 .",
    "@xmath1 can be defended using @xmath18 ( that is , if @xmath5 assumes the role of the proponent of @xmath1 then it has a winning strategy using the argumentation framework of @xmath5 ) , @xmath1 can be denied using @xmath19 ( that is , if @xmath6 assumes the role of the opponent than it has a winning strategy using the argumentation framework of @xmath6 ) , but @xmath1 can be defended using @xmath20 , or 2 .",
    "@xmath1 can be denied using @xmath18 , @xmath1 can be defended using @xmath19 , but @xmath1 can be denied @xmath20 , or 3 .",
    "@xmath1 can be defended using @xmath18 and can be defended using @xmath19 , and for each @xmath21 such that @xmath1 can be defended using @xmath22 it holds that @xmath1 can also be defended using @xmath23 , 4 .",

    "naturally , it follows that if @xmath24 then @xmath5 is at least as informed w.r.t . each argument in @xmath19 as @xmath6 .    in the example",
    "mentioned earlier ( eq . [ eq : reinstatement ] ) alex has access only to argument @xmath1 , and bob has access to arguments @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "suppose a third person ( charles ) has access only to arguments @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "then we say that bob is more informed than alex w.r.t .",
    "argument @xmath1 because bob can maintain his position on @xmath1 ( accepted ) while facing criticism from charles , where alex can not .",
    "@xmath1 more controversial consequence is that charles is also more informed than alex w.r.t .",
    "argument @xmath1 , even though from the global perspective , charles has the `` wrong '' position on argument @xmath1 ( rejected instead of accepted ) .",
    "this is compensated by the fact that bob , in his turn , is more informed than charles w.r.t .",
    "argument @xmath1 . as an analogy",
    ", it would be fair to consider newton as more informed than his predecessors , even though his work has later been attacked by more advanced theories .",
    "we developed a software - simulator in order to better understand the impact of a consultant s informedness on his profit .",
    "the simulator has the objective to reveal when it pays off for a consultant to be _ ill - informed _ , i.e. less well - informed as is the state of the art",
    ". if ill - informedness is more profitable for a consultant than being well - informed , the spread of outdated and possibly wrong facts or arguments is preprogrammed .",
    "of course , such a situation would be harmful to our society , and so a study of its causes seems to be important . in the following , we describe the simulator ( sect .",
    "[ sec : simulator ] ) , show results ( sect .",
    "[ sec : results ] ) and discuss these ( sect .",
    "[ sec : analysis ] ) .      in the first part of this section ,",
    "we describe the client - consultant scenario that we aim to simulate .",
    "we then detail the considered argumentation framework .",
    "two different strategies of the consultants concerning the acquisition of newly available information are defined afterwards , one representing well - informed consultants and the other representing ill - informed consultants .",
    "finally , we specify the procedure of how clients select their consultants .",
    "the scenario is basically defined by a set of clients , a set of consultants , and a finite number of rounds in each of which the clients seek advice from the consultants . in each round , consultants acquire new information , either from other sources ( researchers , analysts , etc . ) , or do investigations on their own .",
    "we model this acquisition of information simply as fixed costs per piece of information ; in our case , this information comes in the form of arguments as we will see later .",
    "the more clients request a certain consultant s advice , the lower his price for a consultation can be . note that this actually explains why the intermediary role of consultants exists .",
    "clients are free to choose their consultant , and so select in each round the consultant that they think is currently the most appropriate one . in our simulations , this selection is based on price and reputation of the consultants as it will be detailed later .",
    "we consider the following argumentation structure consisting of @xmath25 many arguments : @xmath26 here , any argument @xmath27 ( for @xmath28 ) defeats its predecessor argument @xmath29 .",
    "if @xmath25 is even , then all arguments @xmath27 where @xmath30 is even , are `` in '' , and all other arguments are `` out '' . if @xmath25 is odd , it is the other way around .    at the beginning of a simulation ,",
    "only argument @xmath31 is known to the consultants and only this argument is known in the whole society , i.e. it represents the `` state of the art '' . to model the discovery / emergence of new information , we make a certain number of new arguments available to the consultants in each round .",
    "this represents the evolution of the state of the art .",
    "the number of new arguments per round will be fixed for a simulation and is denoted by @xmath32 .",
    "we assume that the consultants extend their already known chain of arguments with new arguments always in a seamless manner , i.e. without gaps .",
    "this assumption was made in order to be in line with argument games ( such as described in @xcite ) where each uttered argument is a reaction to a previously uttered argument , thus satisfying the property of _ relevance _ @xcite .    for a better understanding ,",
    "the following shows the structure of the chain of arguments at any round of the simulation ( @xmath33 must hold ) : @xmath34    consultants generally want to provide the least amount of information needed for a consultation , because this way they can give more consultations .",
    "however , consultants generally want to give good advice at the same time , to increase their reputation .",
    "we assume that consultants believe that the latest argument they know is the most justified one , because it is closest to the current state of the art . as a consequence , in order to give good advice , they only consult arguments that are compliant to the latest argument they possess , i.e. arguments whose index has the same parity as the latest argument they know . to provide the least amount of information at the same time , a rational consultant acts as follows : he provides the client with _ two _ arguments , if the latest argument known to the client is of the same parity as the latest argument known to the consultant , and with _ one _ argument otherwise .",
    "the latest argument known to the client is updated accordingly .    to keep things simple ,",
    "the cost of an argument is set to a constant @xmath35 .",
    "so , to get the knowledge about argument @xmath36 , the consultant has an overall expense of @xmath37 ( recall that arguments can only be acquired in a row ) .",
    "we write @xmath38 to denote the total number of arguments acquired by a specific consultant ( where @xmath39 ) .",
    "thus , we model the expenses @xmath40 of a consultant as : @xmath41      we consider two types of consultants that deal differently with newly available arguments :    well - informed ( _ wi _ ) : : :    _ wi_-consultants  buy arguments as soon as these become available ,    since they want to be always up - to - date .",
    "ill - informed ( _ ii _ ) : : :    _",
    "ii_-consultants  only buy arguments as to appear knowledgeable to the    clients .",
    "that is , as soon as they notice that a client is as informed    as they are , or even better informed , they buy a number of new    arguments such that they know one argument more than this client .    clearly ,",
    "_ ii_-consultants  can offer their consultations at a lower price .",
    "however , the reputation of a consultant decreases with each consultation where the client turns out to be as informed as the consultant  and this happens more often to _ ii_-consultants .",
    "the turnover of a consultant is defined by the sum of prices the consultant was paid .",
    "let @xmath42 be the multiset enumerating all prices paid by clients up to a certain round .",
    "so , @xmath42 represents the consultations where the consultant actually was better informed than the client , and thus was paid .",
    "then the turnover @xmath43 up to this point is defined as : @xmath44    finally , the profit @xmath45 of a consultant up to a certain round is the difference between his turnover and his expenses so far : @xmath46      in our simulations , clients rate consultants according to two criteria : the consultant @xmath30 s current reputation @xmath47 and price @xmath48 .",
    "the two criteria are explained in more detail later in this section . for",
    "now , it suffices to know that they are normalized to @xmath49 $ ] . to make both parameters `` positive ''",
    ", the price @xmath48 will be expressed in the form of _ cheapness _",
    "@xmath50 , i.e. , @xmath51 . this way , both a _ high _ cheapness and a _ high _ reputation characterize a good consultant .",
    "a parameter @xmath52 $ ] defines which of the two criteria a client thinks is more important .",
    "consequently , a client chooses consultant @xmath30 with a probability proportional to : @xmath53 a high @xmath54 favors the choice of cheaper consultants , while a low @xmath54 favors the choice of more reputable consultants .",
    "[ [ price ] ] price + + + + +    let @xmath55 be the _ profit margin _ of a consultant , with @xmath56 ; then @xmath57 for example represents a typical profit margin of @xmath58 . using a certain profit margin",
    ", a consultant @xmath30 computes his current price @xmath59 : @xmath60 here , @xmath61 is a simple estimate to provide cost recovery , where @xmath40 models the expenses ( see eq . [ eq : e ] ) , and @xmath62 is the number of successful consultations so far ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : t ] ) . still , no client would choose a consultant that is more expensive than the acquisition of the information itself .",
    "hence , we limit the price to the cost of the two arguments that a consultant advises at most ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "finally , we normalize the prices of all consultants to @xmath49 $ ] : @xmath64    [ [ reputation ] ] reputation + + + + + + + + + +    in our simulator , clients use a _ reputation system _",
    "@xcite to share their experience about consultants .",
    "this allows clients to better estimate the trustworthiness of the consultants and thus to better select their future consultants .",
    "we assume perfect conditions for the reputation system , since this will make it even harder for _",
    "ii_-consultants  to hold their ground .",
    "these perfect conditions consist of :    * _ honest reporting _ of the clients , * all clients have the same idea of how to fuse the experiences with consultants , and so a global reputation score can be computed , and * _ total information sharing _",
    ", i.e. , every client shares his experience with every other client",
    ".    the reputation system should be as simple as possible , and the only requirement we have is that it measures a consultant s performance relatively to the performance of other consultants .",
    "we consider two different reputation systems . a very basic system ( r1 ) , and a more sophisticated one ( r2 ) .",
    "[ [ reputation - system - r1 ] ] reputation system r1    in the reputation system r1 , a client is satisfied with a consultation if the consultant is better informed than the client .",
    "this is motivated by the fact that clients can not question the correctness of the consultants arguments since they are less well informed .",
    "so , any consultation where the consultant is better informed than the client counts as a positive experience with that consultant .",
    "consultations where this is not the case count as negative experiences .",
    "the clients share their experience and maintain for each consultant @xmath30 a global counter @xmath65 of positive experiences , and a global counter @xmath66 of negative experiences",
    ". then an intermediate reputation score is computed as follows : @xmath67 to bring these scores into @xmath49 $ ] , we normalize the intermediate values of all consultants and get the final global reputation score @xmath47 : @xmath68 this basic reputation score has the desired property : the overall performance of a consultant is measured relatively to the performance of other consultants .    [ [ reputation - system - r2 ] ] reputation system r2    in this reputation system , a client reactively decides about positive and negative experiences .",
    "each client assumes that the latest argument he was advised on by a consultant is correct .",
    "then for all consultants @xmath30 that advised him with a conflicting argument in the past ( i.e. , where the parity of the argument s index is different ) , each client increases the global value @xmath66 , and for all consultants that advised a compatible argument , @xmath65 is increased . as in r1 , if the consultant is not more informed than the client , @xmath66 is additionally increased . given @xmath65 and @xmath66 ,",
    "the computation of @xmath47 is the same as in r1 .      on the following pages we show simulation results to compare the profit of _",
    "wi_-consultants  and _ ii_-consultants  for different parameters .",
    "we conducted the experiments by computing the mean and standard deviation of the consultants profit over @xmath69 simulation runs .",
    "each simulation consisted of @xmath70 rounds .",
    "we used @xmath71 clients and @xmath70 consultants .",
    "we varied the following parameters :    * the number of arguments becoming available each round ( @xmath72 ) , * the fraction of _ ii_-consultants  ( @xmath73 ) , * the profit margin ( @xmath74 ) , and * the factor @xmath54 that regulates the importance of price and reputation in the clients consultant selection process ( @xmath52 $ ] , shown on the x - axis ) .",

    "ii_-consultants  seem to generally benefit from a low profit margin ( @xmath55 ) .    an increasing fraction of _",
    "ii_-consultants  causes the curves of both _",
    "ii_-consultants  and _ wi_-consultants  to have a lower slope value ( have a look at the values on the y - axis to verify that ) . as a result ,",
    "the point where the two curves intersect moves to the left , i.e. the _ ii_-strategy becomes more effective .",
    "a varying @xmath32 impacts also the slope of the curves , as well as their distance .",
    "consider for instance the variation of @xmath32 for otherwise fixed parameters : r1 , @xmath84 and @xmath57 ( figures on the right side ) .",
    "for @xmath76 , the _ ii_-strategy is the better strategy for @xmath85 ; for a @xmath32 of @xmath86 or @xmath87 , the _",
    "wi_-strategy is always better  for @xmath86 very distinct , and less distinct for @xmath87 .",
    "the same observations as for r1 can also be made for r2 .",
    "the main difference lies in the shape of the curves .",
    "in particular , the shape of the lines depends on the parity of @xmath32 .",
    "this can be explained as follows .",
    "if an even number of new arguments gets available each round , _",
    "wi_-consultants  will always advice even arguments ; however , if @xmath88 is odd , they switch each round between advising even and odd arguments .",
    "since clients retrospectively judge consultants in r2 , they will find in the odd case that _ wi_-consultants  contradict each other over time , which will never be the case in the even case .",
    "so , in the even case , clients will decrease the reputation of a _",
    "wi_-consultant  only if their most recent consultant was ill - informed and consulted an odd argument .",
    "this explains also why the profit of _ wi_-consultants  is much higher and the profit of _",
    "ii_-consultants  is much lower in the even cases ( also in comparison to r1 ) .",
    "apart from these specific shapes , in the same way as for r1 we can observe that the _ ii_-strategy yields in many settings higher profits .",
    "our simulations suggest that at least four factors have an impact on the profitability of being ill - informed :    * the clients balancing act of choosing a consultant according to his reputation or his price ( @xmath54 ) , * the fraction of ill - informed consultants in the set of consultants ( @xmath89 ) , * the speed with which new information enters the system and becomes available to consultants ( @xmath32 ) , and * the profit margin of the consultants ( @xmath55 ) .    in our simulations , a high @xmath54 and",
    "a high @xmath89 made it generally less profitable for consultants to be well - informed .",
    "the observation that an increasing fractions of _",
    "ii_-consultants  increases their payoff , raises the problem of consultants that follow the crowd , even if this means to stay ill - informed .",
    "the simulated model in this work is certainly simplifying the complexity of reality .",
    "there are many ways for making it more realistic .",
    "for instance , the price computation given by eq .",
    "[ price_model ] is purely reactive ; it does not exploit the fact that a lower prices would attract more clients and so could be used in a proactive manner .",
    "still , since all consultants computed their price in the same way , it is not clear whether a more complex approach would make the _",
    "ii_-strategy less profitable .",
    "this is subject to future research . also , our consultants pursued two basic strategies ( acquiring all arguments becoming available , and acquiring only as needed ) ; this can be extended to more sophisticated strategies , e.g. to be a _",
