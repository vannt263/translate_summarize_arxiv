    "core - collapse supernovae ( ccsne ) are the signposts of recent massive star formation .",
    "since much of the massive star formation is embedded in dust , a substantial fraction of the ccsne in the universe will remain hidden in optical searches @xcite .",
    "this is particularly true in the case of star formation taking place in the dusty environments of luminous ( @xmath7)@xmath8 $ ] . ] , and ultra - luminous ( @xmath9 ) infrared ( ir ) galaxies ( lirgs and ulirgs , respectively ) , which dominates the star formation rate density at @xmath10 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in many lirgs , the bulk of star formation occurs within their circumnuclear regions ( @xmath11kpc ) , so that the need for high - resolution observations becomes crucial in the detection and study of ccsne therein .",
    "the synergy between high resolution radio and near - infrared ( nir ) _ k_-band ( where the extinction is 10 times lower than in the optical ) observations is currently being used to help build a complete picture of the supernova ( sn ) activity in dusty starbursts and lirgs .",

    "the system is composed of two interacting galaxies , whose major nuclei ( a and b1 ) and core components in the interacting region ( c@xmath17 and c ) are bright radio and nir emitters @xcite .",
    "arp299 is a very prolific sn factory as proved by the detection of several radio sne and sn remnants ( snrs ) in the innermost nuclear regions of arp299a and arp299b @xcite , and the detection within the last 20 years of seven optical / nir sne in the circumnuclear regions of the system ( see * ? ? ?",

    "the spectrum of sn2010p obtained with the gemini - north telescope revealed a deficiency of hydrogen and matched with spectra of type ib / iib sne @xcite , and the absolute magnitude and colours from optical and nir observations with the not and the gemini - north telescope yielded a likely high host galaxy extinction of @xmath19 ( kankare et al .",
