    "however , no measurable voltage or fmr absorption have been detected from these test samples and control experiments , ruling out experimental artefacts affecting the observed results .",

    "the angles @xmath55 and @xmath56 define the directions of the applied in - plane magnetic field in accordance to the geometry provided in fig.[fig : fig1](c ) .",
    "since the rashba - edelstein effect is observed in 2degs and in materials with giant rashba soc @xcite , and given that the system treated here belongs to neither of these two classes , the observed emf is attributed to the interplay between she and ishe .",
    "the experimental emf @xmath52 is a superposition of the voltage due to ishe in the @xmath1-gan : si layer @xcite and of spurious voltages originating from galvanomagnetic effects like ordinary hall effect ( ohe ) in @xmath1-gan : si , anomalous hall effect ( ahe ) , planar hall effect ( phe ) in the py layer and thermal heating effects due to microwave irradiation @xcite .",
    "the voltage originating from these spurious mechanisms can be separated from the one due to ishe by fitting the experimental data with the function @xcite@xmath14    @xmath57    where @xmath58 is the half line width of the fmr line - shape and @xmath48 is the resonance field .",
    "the symmetric part of the total voltage function , @xmath59 $ ] with an absorption line - shape is the contribution of the ishe voltage , @xmath60 , developed in @xmath1-gan : si due to the adiabatic spin pumping and to heating effects . on the other hand ,",
    "the asymmetric part of the function , @xmath61/\\left[(h - h_\\mathrm{fmr})^2+\\vargamma^2\\right]$ ] with a dysonian dispersion line - shape is a consequence of the contributions from ahe and ohe , as discussed earlier .",
    "the hall voltages @xmath62 change sign across @xmath48 , while @xmath60being proportional to the integrated microwave absorption intensity  is symmetric across @xmath48 , as expected from the fundamental spin pumping model @xcite .",
    "a fitting of the measured emf at a microwave power of 200 mw with eq . for @xmath63 yields @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "the ratio @xmath66/@xmath62@xmath76 indicates that the major contribution to the measured voltage is provided by the efficient conversion of spin - to - charge current due to an interplay of spin pumping and direct and inverse spin hall effects .",
    "the spurious heating effects from the microwave irradiation can be further eliminated by averaging the symmetric voltage for parallel and antiparallel orientation of the applied field @xmath67 according to@xmath14",
    "@xmath68    this approach to the treatment of the data is justified , since @xmath60 changes sign upon reversal of the magnetic field owing to a change of sign of the spin polarization vector @xmath69 , not occurring for the voltage due to the microwave heating effects .",
    "thus , for spin pumping experiments , the measured emf @xmath52 includes contributions from both symmetric and asymmetric voltages , and the actual ishe voltage @xmath60 is estimated by a proper treatment of the measured data .",
    "it was reported @xcite , that the symmetric voltage can also include contributions from phe and galvanomagnetic effects in the metallic fm layer due to the electric and magnetic field components of the microwave . however , the angular dependence of the emf w.r.t .",
    "the external magnetic field showed that the contribution of the ishe to the symmetric voltages at least five times greater than the ones from the phe @xcite . in the above mentioned works , the thickness of the nm layer was of the order of the spin diffusion length @xmath70 , while the thickness of @xmath1-gan : si studied here is @xmath71 , @xmath24 much greater than @xmath7280 nm in @xmath1-gan .",
    "the fact that the thickness of the nm is orders of magnitude greater than @xmath70 suppresses the backflow spin current into the metallic fm , further reducing the contributions to the emf from galvanomagnetic effects .",
    "careful identification and estimation of the various components of the generated emf in the nm layer in a spin pumping experiment is therefore essential for the estimation of the spin - to - charge conversion efficiency of a material . here , for the in - plane magnetic field , after eliminating the heating effects , a @xmath73",
    "is obtained and is exploited for the quantitative evaluation of the spin hall angle for @xmath1-gan : si .",
    "the dependence of the measured emf on the applied microwave power under fmr conditions is shown in figs.[fig : fig3](a ) and [ fig : fig3](c ) for orientations of the magnetic field @xmath53 and @xmath54 , respectively . for a microwave power of 200 mw ,",
    "the measured voltages at fmr conditions are + 2.849 @xmath74 for @xmath53 and -3.840 @xmath74 for @xmath54 .",
    "it is to be noted here that the voltages reported in figs.[fig : fig3](a ) and [ fig : fig3](c ) contain both the symmetric and asymmetric contributions . after separating the symmetric and asymmetric voltage components , the symmetric part of the voltage , @xmath66 is plotted as a function of @xmath75 and shown in figs.[fig : fig3](b ) and [ fig : fig3](d ) for @xmath53 and @xmath54 , respectively",
    "now , being @xmath60 proportional to the square of the microwave magnetic field ( @xmath76 ) , it is expected to be linearly proportional to the microwave power @xmath75 [ ] . this is validated in figs.[fig : fig3](b ) and [ fig : fig3](d ) for @xmath53 and @xmath54 , respectively .",
    "the reversal of @xmath20 causes @xmath69 to change sign , which in turn induces the change in sign of the ishe electric field @xmath77 , as evidenced in figs.[fig : fig3](a ) and [ fig : fig3](c ) .",
    "it can be concluded that the fundamental relation for the ishe , @xmath78 operates in the studied py/@xmath1-gan : si bilayer system . for an applied magnetic field perpendicular to the sample plane , @xmath24 @xmath79 , the amplitude of @xmath60",
    "is quenched even though a fmr signal for the py is detected at the resonance field of 1245 mt .",
    "this result provides the necessary and sufficient confirmation of spin pumping through she and ishe in @xmath1-gan : si .",
    "the magnetization precession described by the llg eq . drives the spin pumping in the py/@xmath1-gan : si film . within the fundamental model of spin",
    "pumping proposed by tserkovnyak @xmath4 @xcite , the dc component of the generated spin current density @xmath80 at the interface between py and @xmath1-gan : si is :    @xmath81_{z}dt\\label{eq.4}\\ ] ]    where @xmath82 and @xmath83 are the dirac constant and real part of the spin mixing conductance , while @xmath84_{z}$ ] is the @xmath85 component of @xmath84 $ ] .",

    "considering the above mentioned overestimation of the magnitude of the side jump contribution and the consequent discrepancy between the theoretical and experimental values of @xmath2 , one can infer that she in @xmath1-gan : si is dominated by skew scattering .",

    "however , the asymmetric voltages can still be seen , being independent of spin pumping . in the present case of @xmath1-gan : si",
    ", the spin diffusion length is @xmath70 @xmath7 80 nm .",
    "it was reported that for nm metal systems , the asymmetry voltage contribution for a film thickness of the order of @xmath70 is close to 100% of the total emf measured .",
    "this is due to the dominance of @xmath130 over @xmath131 [ ] . however , with a greater thickness of the nm film , the asymmetric contribution diminishes and approaches a minimum saturation value for a film thickness @xmath132 .",
    "furthermore , it was reported by flovik @xmath4 @xcite that this strong @xmath62 could be assigned to eddy current effects and it was shown that in the case of a nm layer of pt , the asymmetry decreases considerably with increasing the thickness of the nm layer . in the systems considered here , for a thin layer of @xmath1-gan : si the spin backflow is likely to be the dominant mechanism that leads to the suppression of the @xmath133 signal , since the oersted fields induce a significant distortion of the fmr lineshape , not observed for the @xmath71 thick @xmath1-gan : si sample . for the case of zno , also a wide band gap wurtzite semiconductor like gan , dambrosio @xmath4 [ ] reported the measured emf from the zno layer in a py / zno bilayer under fmr conditions , as due to phe in the py layer . in our case of @xmath1-gan : si , the control experiments  as previously mentioned did not reveal any measurable voltage due to phe in the py layer .",
    "moreover , the thickness of the zno film used in case of dambrosio @xmath4 was 200 nm , making spin backflow a likely reason for the observed dominant contribution from phe .",

    "<S> the soc is employed to create new classes of topological objects like magnetic skyrmions or dzyalonshinskii - moriya domain walls @xcite , spin - orbitronics in non - magnetic materials mostly addresses the spin - to - charge conversion through the spin hall effect ( she ) @xcite and the rashba - edelstein effect @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the concept of she is borrowed from the anomalous hall effect ( ahe ) where , due to the relativistic soc , asymmetric deflection of charge carriers takes place depending on their spin orientations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> while ahe is studied in magnetic systems , she is mostly observed in non - magnetic ones . </S>",
    "<S> based on the concept of spin dependent mott scattering @xcite , the she was predicted nearly four decades ago by dyakonov and perel @xcite and was proposed to be the effective process for producing pure spin currents in solid state systems . </S>",

    "<S> the possibility of an intrinsic mechanism was proposed by various theoretical groups @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the intrinsic she depends only on the electronic band structure of the material . </S>",
    "<S> this effect arises from the nonequilibrium dynamics of the bloch electrons as they undergo spin precession due to an induced @xmath5dependent effective magnetic field , such as the rashba field . </S>",

    "<S> the extrinsic she is classified according to two different underlying mechanisms @xmath6 the skew scattering and the side jump mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> skew scattering is the asymmetric scattering of spin , within the scattering plane , due to an effective magnetic field gradient that arises as an effect of the soc . </S>",
    "<S> the scattering plane defines the spin polarization direction of the resulting spin current . </S>",
    "<S> the side jump mechanism is the velocity integrated over time of deflection of electrons in opposite directions by the electric fields experienced when approaching or withdrawing an impurity . </S>",

    "<S> the intrinsic and extrinsic side jump mechanisms contribute mostly to the she , while for carrier mobilities greater than @xmath12 , extrinsic skew scattering is the dominant process @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , for mobilites exceeding @xmath13 , spin coulomb drag becomes the dominant mechanism @xcite and compels the spin hall conductivity towards a saturation value . </S>",

    "<S> is the precession term , while the second term represents a damping component that impels the precession of magnetization @xmath23 to spiral down to a static magnetization axis due to the gilbert damping parameter @xmath26 . in a fm / nm hybrid bilayer , @xmath26 is enhanced due to the transfer of spin angular momentum from the fm to the nm through a dynamical process of adiabatic spin pumping @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the spins pumped in the nm are scattered by the effective spin - orbit field @xmath24 the rashba field and a spin accumulation is achieved in the nm , leading to a spin current in the nm through she . </S>",

    "<S> furthermore , transition metal doped iii - nitrides have been studied extensively in the past decade as workbench magnetic semiconductors @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> another fundamental aspect , namely the presence of rashba spin orbit coupling ( rsoc ) @xcite , was recently demonstrated in degenerate wurtzite ( wz ) @xmath1-gan : si [ ] . using magnetotransport measurements it was shown that the rashba parameter , @xmath32 , linear in @xmath5 and accounting for the spin splitting of the conduction band in wz - gan , has a quantitative value measured for @xmath1-gan : si to be @xmath7 ( @xmath33)@xmath34 @xmath24 the same magnitude found for a 2-dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) formed at the algan / gan interface @xcite . in this work it was shown that in polar wz - gan , the inversion asymmetry associated with the wurtzite crystal structure dominates over the interfacial electric field in the conduction band of gan . </S>",
