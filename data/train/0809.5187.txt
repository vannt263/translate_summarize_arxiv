    "the interest in dilute magnetic semiconductors ( dms ) has been enormous during the last decade.@xcite numerous theoretical and experimental investigations focusing on their properties have been performed , motivated not least by the quest for a dms system with ferromagnetic properties at and above room temperature .",
    "one of the more frequently studied materials is the iii - v semiconductor gallium arsenide , doped with manganese ( mn - gaas ) , and it now stands clear that an ordering temperature of 170 k@xcite to 180 k @xcite can be obtained . among the achievements on the theoretical side is the success of calculations based on density functional theory , where quite generally for dms systems one should mention the following : first principles calculations result in reasonable electronic band structures@xcite as compared to experiments , the correct values of the magnetic moments are obtained@xcite , calculations of interatomic exchange interactions@xcite result in ordering temperatures in agreement with observations , and finally the recognition of percolation@xcite as an important mechanism to govern the presence or absence of long ranged magnetic ordering , so that mean field theories should be used with great caution .    whereas most authors have concentrated on the static properties in thermal equilibrium ,",
    "the scope of this article is atomistic simulations of the dynamic properties of diluted magnetic semiconductors .",
    "we have chosen to use mn doped gaas , with and without defects such as as antisites , as a representative of this group of materials and in our manuscript we argue that our findings apply to dms in a quite general way .",
    "the main reason behind this is that both iii - v and ii - vi based dms have very similar behavior as regards the exchange interaction , with an exponentially decaying behavior with distance between magnetic impurities.@xcite in addition , for both sets of systems a varying degree of ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions can be obtained , depending on vacancy concentration of the host lattice .",
    "for instance , mn doped zno has antiferromagnetic interactions which can be turned to ferromagnetic interactions in the presence of zn vacancies.@xcite in a similar way , it is known that mn doped gaas has primarily ferromagnetic interactions between the mn atoms in the absence of defects , but an increasing amount of as antisites and mn interstitials introduce antiferromagnetic interactions between the mn atoms.@xcite the main difference between the iii - v and ii - vi materials is that the solubility of transition metals is larger for the latter , but in the low concentration limit ( 2 - 10  % of transition metals doped into the host lattice ) these two sets of materials should have a similar magnetic behavior and dynamic response .",
    "many dms materials are in experiments analyzed as changing from a ferromagnetic behavior to a regime where spin - glass behavior is thought to occur .",
    "the strongest evidence for spin - glass properties can be found among the ii - vi dms systems , like @xmath3 @xcite and @xmath4 @xcite . among the iii - v dms materials spin - glass properties",
    "have been suggested for @xmath5 @xcite and te doped @xmath6@xcite . often this transition is found as a function of concentration of magnetic dopants , but the concentration of other defects have also been analyzed to drive a spin - glass behavior .",
    "a good example of this is the system of interest here , mn doped gaas , where defects like as antisites , have been argued to produce a spin - glass like behavior@xcite .",
    "spin - dynamics simulations , as presented here , are a natural way to analyse this behaviour and part of this study is devoted to analysing spin - glass behaviour in mn doped gaas .    in the present paper",
    "we give a full account of a spin - dynamics simulation of a dms material , including an analysis of short versus long ranged correlation and typical time scales of the magnetic response .",

    "the system has already reached thermal equilibrium . here",
    "the autocorrelation , starting from unity at an observation time @xmath87 , quickly settles to a value that equals the value of the magnetization the system posseses at that temperature .",
    "the individual spins fluctuate and precess around the direction of the effective magnetic field and their individual autocorrelation functions fluctuate correspondingly . averaged over the ensemble these fluctuations vanishes and the autocorrelation function , after the initial decay from unity , is constant . for short waiting times ( @xmath88  ps in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : aca0025t010axrx ] and @xmath89  ps in fig .",
    "[ fig : acbccfet100k ] ) , the autocorrelation quickly drops from unity to essentially zero .",
    "the more interesting features are to be found for intermediate waiting times ( @xmath90  ps in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : aca0025t010axrx ] and @xmath91  ps in fig .",
    "[ fig : acbccfet100k ] ) .",
    "the autocorrelation initially decays to a value equal or slightly smaller than the value for the longer waiting times . with increasing observation time",
    "the autocorrelation eventually drops from this level and starts a damped oscillation .",
    "the value around which the autocorrelation oscillates corresponds to the value the magnetization has reached for a specific waiting time . when comparing the frequencies of the oscillations in figs .",
    "[ fig : aca0025t010axrx ] and  [ fig : acbccfet100k ] ( which represent an average over all spins in the simulation cell ) with the typical frequencies of individual spin trajectories , we observe that they are of comparable magnitude .",
    "the observed oscillations can therefore be explained from the fact that each atomic spin precesses in its local exchange field and that this spin precession is faster than the rate at which the local exchange field reaches its equilibrium orientation .",
    "summing over all spins in the simulation box then gives rise to the oscillatory behaviour in figs .",
    "[ fig : aca0025t010axrx ] and  [ fig : acbccfet100k ] . the damping term in eq .",
    "1 ensures that the oscillations are damped . if one would make an average over different configurations of the mn atoms and different heatbaths , the oscillation diminish in magnitude with the number of simulations",
    "this is illustrated in the middle panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : acbccfet100k ] , where the oscillations are seen to have been strongly suppresed .    for mn doped gaas with 2.00  % as antisites ( fig .",
    "[ fig : aca0200t010a1r1 ] ) the situation is very different compared to the simulations with lower as antisite concentration , since the autocorrelation function approaches zero , for all waiting times .",
    "the reason is that the sample for @xmath78  k is paramagnetic .",
    "we note however that there are signs of slow dynamics in the simulations , since the different autocorrelation functions do not lie on top of one another , but are spread out over a time interval which covers approximately one decade in time .",
    "this is distinctly different from bcc fe in the paramagnetic phase , at temperatures well above the ordering temperature ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : acbccfet100k ] - lower panel ) , where all autocorrelation functions lie on top of one another , independent on waiting time .    for very low temperatures",
    ", one can expect a phase transition also for mn doped gaas with 2.00  % as antisites . for a pure spin - glass system",
    ", the spin dynamics will exhibit critical slowing down on approaching the transition temperature from above .",
    "below the spin - glass transition temperature , the different autocorrelation functions should not approach zero for any time t , and curves corresponding to different waiting times should never lie on top of one - another for any extended interval of time . our simulations for @xmath92  k ( data not shown ) do indeed show a very slow dynamics .",
    "for instance , starting from a ferromagnetic configuration or from a rdlm configuration we do not reach equilibrium within the time of the simulation .",
    "however , for computer simulations made with limited cell size , the system will eventually exhaust the length scales allowed by the periodic boundary conditions and the autocorrelation function will eventually go to zero . in ref .",
    "berthier _ et al .",
    "_ treats the mechanism of finite size effects in monte carlo simulations on a archetypical heisenberg spin - glass .",
    "problems connected to finite size are also present in our spin dynamics simulations , and we are left to conclude that our data on 2.00  % at @xmath92  k are not sufficient to allow for any definitive statements on the nature of the phase transition .",
    "it is meaningful to compare the results of figs .",
    "[ fig : aca0025t010axrx],[fig : aca0175t010a1r1 ] and [ fig : aca0200t010a1r1 ] , with simulations of typical , well known spin - glass systems , like mn doped cu ( fcc ) .",
    "we have undertaken simulations on mn doped cu ( data not shown ) and we find that these simulations do indeed show typical spin - glass characteristics , but details of this simulation are outside the scope of the present analysis and will not be discussed further here .",
    "nevertheless , we conclude that our simulation package results in the expected behavior for well established spin - glass systems .",
    "the fact that mn doped gaas , for several concentrations of as antisites , with varying degree of competing ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic exchange interactions , does not display spin - glass characteristics suggest that it is incorrect to label this system as a spin - glass .",

    "enables further insight into spin dynamic simulations .",
    "we have produced a set of movies that are accessible on the webpage of ref .  .",
    "these simulations were done without as antisites at a temperature of 100 k ( 200 k ) which is below ( above ) the ordering temperature .",
    "the movies reveal that also above the ordering temperature the spins are correlated on short distances .",
    "the difference occurs for longer distances , where for 100 k , the spins are still correlated , but for 200 k they are not .",
    "in conclusion we have applied atomistic spin dynamics simulations to 5  % mn doped in gaas , with and without as antisite defects . it should be noted that also other types of defects have been found experimentally for this system , e.g. mn interstitials .",
    "both types of defects introduce antiferromagnetic interactions in the lattice and for simplicity we have here only considered the as antisites .",
    "our results show ordering temperatures and a general behavior of the magnetization curve which are in agreement with monte carlo simulations and experiment .    the dynamical response has also been investigated and we find that the dynamics between nn mn atoms is , as revealed by the pair correlation function , considerably faster than the more long ranged interaction .",
    "in addition we find that short ranged order exists up to and even above the ordering temperature .",
    "we also find that starting from random configurations , the pair correlation function , for distances up to @xmath94 ( @xmath95 lattice parameter ) , reaches equilibrium on a time scale of 10 - 20 ps .",
    "the dynamical response , as revealed by the autocorrelation function , shows that mn doped gaas , does not display spin - glass behavior , for moderate ( @xmath96 ) concentrations of as antisites . for the highest defect concentration , @xmath97 , the nature of the phase transition ( ferromagnetic or spin - glass ) of the simulation cell can not be accurately determined from our data .",
    "the present article focuses on one iii - v semiconducting host , gaas , and one magnetic element , mn , in the low concentration regime . however , the general behavior of the magnetism of most doped semiconductors is basically similar , with an exchange interaction which decays exponentially with distance due to the presence of a band gap in the system , overlapped with an angular anisotropy of the interatomic exchange , and the possibility to introduce competing ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions via the defect concentration . for this reason",
    "we believe that the main results concerning the dynamics of the presently studied system should be representative for several dms materials , at least in the diluted limit of magnetic dopants , and that they should be characterized as slow magnets . a notable exception from this conclusion may be the ii - vi semiconductors , where the solubility of magnetic atoms can be considerably higher ( up to @xmath2 30  % ) than what we investigate here .",
    "for some of these materials@xcite experimental data do indeed show spin - glass behavior .",
