    "recently the e760 collaboration at fermilab @xcite have reported the first possible observation of the @xmath0 bound state of charmonium ( this resonance , which possibly needs further confirmation , has been indicated as @xmath5 in the last review of particle properties @xcite ) .",
    "the experimental study of the @xmath0 charmonium state is very interesting for testing qcd theoretical models .",
    "the position of its mass with respect to the center of gravity of the @xmath6 states provides a way to test different potential models for the @xmath7 bound state .",
    "furthermore , the branching ratios for the @xmath0 hadronic exclusive decays relate to the validity of the so - called qcd helicity selection rules ( hsr ) @xcite and of the qcd multipole expansion models ( see , e.g. , ref.@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "in particular , the @xmath8 decay is forbidden by the hsr s in massless qcd models for exclusive hadronic processes at high transfer momentum @xcite and , due to time reversal invariance , the same should hold for the exclusive formation process @xmath9 @xmath0 , in contradiction with the results of ref .",
    "@xcite , if the identification of the resonance observed at fermilab with the @xmath0 state is correct .    as a matter of fact , while massless qcd models compare reasonably well with experimental measurements in several cases , they are in disagreement with the data for a number of processes , particularly with those violating the hsr s .",
    "we must bear in mind , however , that these models and their main qualitative results , like the qcd counting rules @xcite or the hsr s , are in principle reliable at very high transfer momentum , while the available experimental results are all in a range of energies where their full validity can be at least questionable .",
    "several higher twist effects can in principle be responsible for the violation of the hsr s .",
    "if implemented in the models , they could give , at least in some cases , a way to reconcile theoretical predictions and experimental measurements .",
    "unfortunately , a consistent inclusion of all higher twist effects is far from being a trivial work . in the last years , however , a few extensions of massless qcd models have been proposed , in order to study the possible role played by some of these higher twist effects . as an example , the diquark model for baryons is one of these ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite for a general overview on this topic ) . in previous work",
    "@xcite we have instead proposed a different , phenomenological model that extends the original massless qcd models by including constituent quark mass effects for the light ( as compared to the transfer momentum scale in the process ) hadrons produced in the final state . in this model the valence quarks of the final hadrons are given a ( constituent ) mass , @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the light - cone fraction of the hadron momentum carried by the quark .",
    "in the small - intermediate @xmath12 region , in fact , one may think that the valence , constituent quarks ( the current quarks surrounded by their cloud of @xmath13 pairs and gluons ) still act as a single , effective particle . as shown by weinberg @xcite , these constituent quarks can indeed be treated as bare dirac particles , with the same coupling as for current quarks in the standard model qcd lagrangian .",
    "this model introduces spin - flip contributions in the elementary amplitudes for the hard scattering process , and as a consequence violations of the hsr s are in principle allowed .",
    "this is possibly the simplest extension of the ordinary massless models , and can be easily compared with them .",
    "it is assumed to be useful in the intermediate range of momentum transfer @xmath12 where , like in charmonium decays , the use of qcd models is reasonable but at the same time higher twist effects , of the order @xmath14 ( @xmath15 being a hadronic mass scale ) , may still play an important role . as the squared momentum transfer @xmath12 increases",
    ", the predictions of the model smoothly tend to those of the usual massless models .",
    "this model has been previously applied to several interesting processes @xcite , in order to test the role of higher twist effects at the scale of momentum transfer presently accessible by experiments .",
    "for example , it predicts a decay width for the hsr - violating process @xmath16 comparable with those relative to the hsr - allowed decays @xmath17 @xcite ( however , only a huge experimental upper limit is available for @xmath18 , so that this prediction can not be severely tested at present ) ; it also reproduces satisfactorily the experimental angular distribution of the @xmath19 pair in the decay @xmath20 , where the role of hsr - violating contributions is essential ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "however , we must stress that other nonperturbative effects than the higher twist effects implemented in the model proposed here can also be relevant for charmonium decays . in ref .",
    "@xcite , e.g. , it has been shown that constituent mass corrections to the usual perturbative qcd models are not sufficient to explain the large experimental width for the hsr - violating decay @xmath21 .",
    "in fact , the @xmath22 state seems to be very peculiar , and in order to explain its , somehow surprisingly , large decay widths into @xmath19 or vector meson pairs , nonperturbative explanations , like strong gluonic components @xcite or instanton - induced contributions @xcite , have been proposed .",
    "the so - called @xmath23 puzzle @xcite and the radiative decays of the @xmath24 @xcite offer other examples of processes where nonperturbative effects can play a substantial role .",
    "it is well possible that different higher twist or nonperturbative effects , like those quoted above , affect charmonium decays , each of them being perhaps more relevant for some specific process and less for others . a detailed comparison of different , theoretical models with all the available experimental results is then required to improve our present understanding of charmonium decays .",
    "following this line of research , in this paper we apply the model of ref .",
    "@xcite to the calculation of the decay width for the charmonium decay process @xmath25 , whose interest has been briefly recalled before .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following : in sect .",
    "ii we present the derivation of the decay width for the process @xmath8 in the framework of qcd models including constituent quark mass effects .",
    "since this can also be useful as a general example of how these kind of calculations are performed , we will give a detailed presentation of all the crucial steps of the calculation . in sect .",
    "iii we present the results in a form which possibly exploit the model at its best , minimizing whenever possible model ambiguities . finally , in sect .",
    "iv we give some final comments and remarks .",
    "the general expression of the differential decay width for the process @xmath8 is the following :    @xmath27    where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are respectively the polar and azimuthal angles defining the outgoing direction of the final proton , in the @xmath0 rest frame ; @xmath30 is the ratio between the proton mass , @xmath31 , and the @xmath0 mass , @xmath32 ; @xmath33 is the spin density matrix of the @xmath0 ; finally , @xmath34 is the rest frame helicity amplitude for the decay of the @xmath0 bound state , with @xmath35 component @xmath36 of its total angular momentum , @xmath37 , into a proton and an antiproton whose helicities are respectively @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "it is known from first principles @xcite that the amplitudes @xmath40 have the following general structure :    @xmath41    where the `` reduced '' amplitude @xmath42 is independent of @xmath36 and the angular variables and the @xmath43 are the usual spin rotation matrices .    inserting eq .",

    "first of all , amplitudes with the proton and antiproton having opposite helicities , @xmath54 , must vanish : in fact , the initial state of the process , the @xmath0 , is a @xmath55 bound state ; on the other hand , the outgoing @xmath1 pair is , for @xmath54 , in a @xmath56 state . then , in order for the pair to have charge conjugation @xmath57 , its relative angular momentum @xmath58 should be even , contradicting the requirement imposed by parity conservation , @xmath59 , that @xmath58 should be odd @xcite . the crucial point is now that in massless qcd models helicity amplitudes with the proton and the antiproton having the same helicity , @xmath60 , are also vanishing , due to the hsr s , which forbid spin - flips in the elementary quark - gluon vertices .",
    "then there is not any term contributing to the total decay width , eq .",
    "( [ g ] ) . notice that hsr s are valid to all orders in the perturbative expansion in the strong coupling constant , and as such overcoming their restrictions is not a matter of going to higher order in this expansion . on the contrary , every higher twist contribution violating the hsr s would in principle give a non vanishing contribution to @xmath60 , of the order @xmath61 , where @xmath15 is a typical hadronic scale .",
    "we now proceed considering in more details the helicity amplitudes @xmath40 which enter the calculation of the @xmath62 decay width .",
    "let us define : _",

    "in order to proceed further and evaluate the helicity amplitudes @xmath65 we resort to the previously mentioned qcd models @xcite . according to them and to factorization theorems , the amplitudes @xmath36 are given , under particular conditions that are reasonably applicable to charmonium decays , by a convolution between a hard , perturbative contribution , describing the interaction between the @xmath7 pair and the valence quarks of the final baryons , and a soft , non - perturbative contribution , which accounts for the hadronization of the valence quarks into the final hadrons .",
    "the latter contribution is described , for each final hadron , by the respective distribution amplitude ( da ) , which is in principle independent of the particular process under consideration . as is well known , the exact form of the da s is essential for the quantitative results of the model",

    "the so - called asymptotic da s , as deducible from perturbative qcd at very large values of the transfer momentum , are not guaranteed to be reliable in the range of energies experimentally accessible today and presumably also in the near future , due to the their slow , logarithmic evolution with @xmath12 .",
    "non - perturbative methods , like lattice qcd or qcd sum rules , give information on the first moments of the da s that lead to a number of models , widely used for practical calculations .",
    "we will consider several of these model da s , in order to get indications on the spread of our results due to this ingredient , without giving prominence to one model over the others .",
    "the value of the first derivative of the nonrelativistic , radial bound state wave function is another parameter to be fixed .",
    "one may use potential models to estimate this quantity or , alternatively , fix its value phenomenologically .",
    "this can be done by comparing the theoretical prediction with the experimental measurement for some other process which is better understood theoretically and more accessible experimentally .",
    "sudakov factors can also change sizably the quantitative predictions .",
    "the inclusion of these factors has been advocated in order to improve the consistency of the theoretical models for exclusive processes and answer some criticisms connected with the end - point contributions ( see ref.@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "furthermore , we do not know whether and how the da s are modified due to higher twist , mass correction effects .    in order to improve the significance of our results and , where possible , to minimize their dependence on all the abovementioned uncertainties , we choose to evaluate , rather than the absolute value of the @xmath62 decay width , its ratio with the decay width for the analogous process , @xmath145 . in other words , we write    @xmath146 \\,\\gamma(\\chi_{c2}\\to p\\,\\bar p)\\ ; , \\label{gam}\\ ] ]    where we use the theoretical prediction for @xmath147 in the denominator and the corresponding experimental measurement in the numerator of the r.h.s . of eq .",
    "( [ gam ] ) .    this way , we can neglect the dependence of the results on @xmath127 and @xmath148 .",
    "notice that @xmath127 and @xmath148 appear in the expression of @xmath3 to the 4th and 2nd power respectively , so that even small variations in their values might give relatively sizable changes in our observable .",
    "possible sudakov factor effects might also be mitigated in the ratio .",
    "we are then confident that our numerical estimates for the @xmath3 decay width , given in the form of eq .",
    "( [ gam ] ) , have the higher precision attainable with present models .",
    "the decay width @xmath147 has been evaluated previously in massless qcd models ( see ref . @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "we have done the calculation following the same procedure previously described for the @xmath3 case .",
    "our result is in agreement with that of ref.@xcite .",
    "notice that this calculation accounts only for the leading term in a ( @xmath149 ) power expansion ( in that case the @xmath150 term , since the process is not forbidden by hsr s ) . for consistency",
    ", we also keep only the leading , ( @xmath149 ) , term in the calculation of @xmath3 .",
    "it is important to notice that , this way , we avoid also possible problems connected with modifications of the da s when mass corrections are taken into account , since these modifications do not contribute at leading order .    using eq .",
    "( [ g ] ) , and eq .  ( [ appfin ] ) at leading order in @xmath30 we have :    @xmath151    where @xmath152 is the integral appearing in eq .  ( [ appfin ] ) , taken in the limit @xmath153 .",
    "notice that we have retained the mass contribution in the kinematical factor coming from phase space integration , @xmath154 .",
    "the corresponding expression for the @xmath145 decay is @xcite    @xmath155    where @xmath156 is the mass of the @xmath157 and @xmath158 . for completeness",

    "( [ ris ] ) and the available models for the da s . besides the nonrelativistic ( nr ) and asymptotic ( as ) da s @xcite , we have used model da s inspired by qcd sum rules methods : the chernyak , zhitnitsky ( cz ) model and its improved ( coz ) version , due to chernyak , ogloblin , and zhitnitsky ( see ref . @xcite and references therein ) ; the king , sachrajda ( ks ) model @xcite ; the gari , stefanis ( gs ) model @xcite ; and , finally , the heterotic ( het ) model proposed by stefanis and bergmann @xcite . a collection of the explicit expressions of these da s can be found in ref .",

    "the @xmath12 evolution of the proton da s , according to perturbative qcd , has been also taken into account .",
    "finally , we have used @xmath168 ev @xcite .",
    "it is evident from table [ tab1 ] that , in spite of our efforts in order to limit the dependence of the numerical results on the particular shape of the model da , our estimate for @xmath3 , even excluding the nr and as distribution amplitudes , still cover a range from 1 to 10 ev .",
    "this spread of the results is in part due to the different behavior of the integrals @xmath169 and @xmath170 when changing the da s .",
    "relative changes are more sensitive for @xmath169 than for @xmath170 .",
    "this can be easily understood from a qualitative point of view . in fact , the integral @xmath152 is exactly vanishing for da s @xmath171 that , like the nonrelativistic and the asymptotic ones , are completely symmetric under permutations of @xmath172 . moreover , due to the factors @xmath173 which are present in each contribution to @xmath152 , @xmath169 itself is very depressed when @xmath174 , as is the case for da s that are strongly peaked at @xmath175 .",
    "then , the magnitude of @xmath152 should give a measure of how much the corresponding da is far from the simple , intuitive equipartition of the hadron momentum among its valence constituents . in principle",
    "this could give an interesting way to discriminate at least the gross features of the proton da s .",
    "in practice , however , at this stage of the calculations , these effects are probably masked by other , less controlled , sources of uncertainty . from this point of view",
    "it should surely be of relevance to perform a full implementation of mass corrections .",
    "we have not calculated them for the @xmath176 process , while for the @xmath0 case , direct use of the full expression of @xmath137 , eq .  ( [ appfin ] ) , neglecting possible modifications in the shape of the da , gives a sizable reduction in the total width .",
    "the worst case then would be if a full account of mass corrections in the @xmath157 case should give an enhancement of the corresponding decay width , depressing our prediction for the relative @xmath3 decay width , eq .",
    "( [ gam ] ) .",
    "we must not forget , however , that the results presented in table [ tab1 ] , which are at leading order in the mass corrections , are on the contrary free from the ambiguity connected with possible changes in the shape of the da s due to higher order mass corrections , since they do not contribute to leading order .",
    "let us now compare our predictions for @xmath3 with previous estimates .",
    "assuming the resonance observed by the e760 collaboration to be the @xmath0 state of charmonium , we have the following measurement for the product of the branching ratios @xmath177 @xcite :    @xmath178    the range of values in eq .",
    "( [ bran ] ) corresponds to the plausible range of values for the @xmath0 total decay width , @xmath179 @xcite :    @xmath180    by using eq .",
    "( [ gtot ] ) and the biggest of our estimates from table i , we find correspondingly    @xmath181    unfortunately we are not able to give a reliable prediction for the decay width of the process @xmath182 in the framework of our model .",
    "then , we can not make a full comparison of our results with the experimental ones of ref.@xcite .",
    "a complementary situation is found in the case of the qcd multipole expansion models . in this framework , kuang et al .",
    "@xcite have predicted @xmath183 kev , where @xmath184 and @xmath185 are effective electric and magnetic multipole - expansion coupling constants .",
    "there is some uncertainty on the value of the ratio @xmath186 , but theoretical considerations suggest as reasonable range @xmath187 @xcite .",
    "we thus take as indicative estimate @xmath188 , which leads to the prediction @xmath189 kev . comparing this result with eqs .",
    "( [ bran]),([gtot ] ) , the following estimate for @xmath190 follows :    @xmath191    the two predictions of eqs .",
    "( [ mybra]),([kubra ] ) differ approximately of one order of magnitude ; they are closer the smaller is the total decay width for the @xmath0 state . however , both theoretical calculations are at present order of magnitude estimates , and before drawing any definite conclusion better calculations are to be expected , together with improved experimental results .",
    "let us finally remark that our prediction for the branching ratio @xmath192 , eq .",
    "( [ mybra ] ) , compares reasonably well with the experimental branching ratios for the processes @xmath193 , @xmath194 , @xmath195 @xcite .",
    "in fact , in qcd models the @xmath8 decay should be suppressed with respect to the @xmath193 ones by a factor @xmath196 , being @xmath197 gev a typical mass scale for higher twist effects .",
    "for @xmath198 this should correspond to a suppression factor of about @xmath199 , which should in turn put the expected value for @xmath192 in the range covered by our prediction .",
    "in this paper we have estimated the width for the decay process of the @xmath0 charmonium state into a proton - antiproton pair , using qcd models and including constituent quark mass corrections .",
    "in fact , massless qcd models state that this decay width is vanishing , due to the helicity selection rules .",
    "this is in possible contradiction with the recent experimental findings of the e760 collaboration .",
    "the inclusion of higher twist effects , like constituent quark mass effects , which can still play a non negligible role at the involved energies , can in principle improve considerably the situation .",
    "however , a full , consistent treatment of these effects is out of our present possibilities . we have then used a phenomenological model which extends the massless qcd ones . in order to minimize the dependence of the quantitative results of the calculation on details of the model , we have expressed the @xmath2 decay width in connection with that for the @xmath200 decay process : @xmath201^{th}\\times \\gamma^{exp}(\\chi_{c2}\\to p\\,\\bar p)$ ] .",
    "that is , we evaluate the first term in this expression in our model , at leading order in the parameter @xmath202 , while taking the available experimental measurement for the second term . this way ,",
    "not only some phenomenological parameters of the model ( the nucleon decay constant @xmath127 , the value of the first derivative of the radial , @xmath79 , nonrelativistic charmonium bound - state wave function at the origin ) cancel out from the result , but some other effects should be at least minimized .",
    "for example , the possible effect of sudakov factors should be reduced .",
    "furthermore , a possible dependence of the da s on mass effects is also irrelevant as long as only the leading term in the @xmath202 power expansion is kept into account .",
    "a consistent inclusion of non - leading terms in the @xmath203 power expansion would in fact require an estimate of mass effects on the @xmath147 decay width and on the da s .",
    "as shown in table [ tab1 ] , we estimate the @xmath3 decay width to be of the order @xmath4 ev , depending on the da considered .",
    "the corresponding branching ratio depends of course on the @xmath0 total decay width , @xmath179 , which is not known at present . using ,",
    "as suggested by the e760 collaboration , the range 500 kev @xmath204 1000 kev , and the biggest of our estimates of table i , we find @xmath205 @xmath206 @xmath207 .",
    "this result is sizably lower ( about one order of magnitude ) than the corresponding branching ratios for the @xmath208 states , as measured by the e760 collaboration .",
    "this is reasonable , since in qcd models the decay @xmath2 should be suppressed by a factor @xmath209 with respect to the decays @xmath210 .",
    "the above result is also sizably lower than that obtained by comparing the experimental results of ref.@xcite with theoretical estimates of the decay width for the process @xmath211 , obtained in the framework of qcd multipole expansion models .",
    "both our calculation and that based on qcd multiple expansion models can probably be affected by `` theoretical '' errors which can modify their quantitative predictions by a sizable factor .",
    "the two estimates , at least indicatively , can be taken as representative of two classes of different models : the first extending the usual perturbative qcd models by the inclusion of higher twist effects , like mass corrections ; the latter including effectively some different , nonperturbative effects , like those present , e.g. , in the @xmath212 decay process .",
    "as such , their results should at least suggest a definite ( albeit still large ) range of possible values for the @xmath3 decay width , ranging approximately from some ev to some hundreds of ev .",
    "we conclude observing once more that further , more precise , experimental measurements will certainly help in clarifying our understanding of the @xmath213 decay process and will be very useful to improve in general our theoretical models for the calculation of exclusive decay processes in the charmonium family .",
    "this is not the case , e.g. , for the @xmath214 decay , because the @xmath24 is a @xmath215 state .",
    "there is then no mutual exclusion between @xmath58 values required by simultaneous parity and charge conjugation conservation , and the @xmath54 can be non - vanishing ."
