    "low - energy phenomena of qcd have been studied in various effective models based on chiral symmetry .",
    "however , the relation of spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking and confinement remains an open issue .",
    "recently , color degrees of freedom were introduced in the nambu  jona - lasinio ( njl ) lagrangian  @xcite through an effective gluon potential expressed in terms of polyakov loops ( pnjl model )  @xcite .",
    "the basic ingredients of the model are constituent quarks and the polyakov loop , which is an order parameter of the @xmath0 symmetry of qcd in the heavy quark limit .",
    "the model has a non - vanishing coupling of the constituent quarks to the polyakov loop and mimics confinement in the sense that only three - quark states contribute to the thermodynamics in the low - temperature phase .",
    "hence , the pnjl model yields a better description of qcd thermodynamics near the phase transition than the njl model .",
    "furthermore , due to the symmetries of the lagrangian , the model belongs to the same universality class as that expected for qcd .",
    "thus , the model can be considered as a testing ground for the critical phenomena related to the breaking of the global @xmath0 and chiral symmetries .",
    "it has been shown that the pnjl model , formulated at finite temperature and finite quark chemical potential , well reproduces some of the thermodynamical observables computed within lattice gauge theory ( lgt ) .",
    "the properties of the equation of state  @xcite , the in - medium modification of meson masses  @xcite as well as the validity and applicability of the taylor expansion in quark chemical potential used in lgt were recently addressed within the pnjl model @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite the model was extended to a system with finite isospin chemical potential and pion condensation was studied .",
    "enhanced fluctuations are characteristic for phase transitions .",
    "thus , the exploration of fluctuations is a promising tool for probing the phase structure of a system .",
    "the phase boundaries can be identified by the response of the fluctuations to changes in the thermodynamic parameters . in this article",
    "we describe the susceptibilities of the order parameters and their properties in the pnjl model following ref .",
    "an extension of the njl lagrangian by coupling the quarks to a uniform temporal background gauge field , which manifests itself entirely in the polyakov loop , has been proposed to account for interactions with the color gauge field in effective chiral models   @xcite .",

    "we assume isospin symmetry and take @xmath7 and @xmath8 .    here",
    "we have introduced non - local interactions which are controlled by a form factor in order to deal with the ultraviolet singularities that appear in the loop integrations . in coordinate space ,",
    "the form factor @xmath9 for the non - local current - current interaction reads : @xmath10 a possible choice for the regulator is in momentum space given by  @xcite : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the fourier transform of the form factor @xmath9 and @xmath13 is the three  momentum .",
    "the njl sector is controlled by four parameters : the strength of four - fermion interaction @xmath14 , the current quark mass @xmath15 and the constants @xmath16 and @xmath17 , which characterize the range of the non - locality .",
    "these parameters are determined in vacuum , for a given @xmath16 , by requiring that the experimental values of the pion parameters and the quark condensate are reproduced .",
    "the interaction between the effective gluon field and the quarks in the pnjl lagrangian is implemented ( [ lag ] ) by means of a covariant derivative @xmath18 where we introduce the standard notation @xmath19 . here",
    "@xmath20 is the color su(3 ) gauge coupling constant and @xmath21 are the gell - mann matrices .    the effective potential @xmath22 of the gluon field in ( [ lag ] ) is expressed in terms of the traced polyakov loop @xmath23 and its conjugate @xmath24 @xmath25 where @xmath26 is a matrix in color space related to the gauge field by @xmath27\\,,\\ ] ] with @xmath28 being the path ( euclidean time ) ordering , and @xmath29 with @xmath30 . in the heavy quark mass limit , qcd has the z(3 ) center symmetry which is spontaneously broken in the high - temperature phase .",
    "the thermal expectation value of the polyakov loop @xmath31 acts as an order parameter of the z(3 ) symmetry .",
    "consequently , @xmath32 at low temperatures in the confined phase and @xmath33 at high temperatures corresponding to the deconfined phase .",
    "the effective potential @xmath34 of the gluon field is expressed in terms of the polyakov loops so as to preserve the @xmath0 symmetry of the pure gauge theory  @xcite .",
    "we adopt an effective potential of the following form  @xcite : @xmath35 with @xmath36 the coefficients @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 are fixed by requiring that the equation of state obtained in pure gauge theory on the lattice is reproduced .",
    "in particular , at @xmath40 mev the model reproduces the first order deconfinement phase transition of the pure gauge theory .",
    "in the pnjl model the constituent quarks and the polyakov loops are effective fields related with the order parameters for the chiral and @xmath0 symmetry breaking . in lgt",
    "the susceptibilities associated with these fields show clear signals of the phase transitions  @xcite .    in fig .",

    ", width=302 ]    the chiral susceptibility exhibits a very narrow divergent peak at the chiral critical temperature @xmath47 , while the peak of @xmath44 is much broader and the susceptibility remains finite at all temperatures .",
    "this is due to the explicit breaking of the @xmath0 symmetry by the presence of quark fields in the pnjl lagrangian .",
    "nevertheless , @xmath48 still exhibits a peak structure that can be considered as a signal for the deconfinement transition in this model .",

    "[ fig : sus ] : at the chiral transition , @xmath49 , there is a narrow structure in @xmath48 .",
    "we stress that this feature is not related with the deconfinement transition , but expresses the coupling of quarks to the polyakov loops .",

    "the peak positions of the @xmath41 and @xmath44 susceptibilities determine the phase boundaries in the @xmath50plane . at finite chemical potential",
    ", there is a shift of the chiral phase transition to lower temperatures . in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase ] we show the resulting phase diagram for the pnjl model .",
    "the boundary lines of deconfinement and chiral symmetry restoration do not coincide .",
    "there is only one common point in the phase diagram where the two transitions appear simultaneously .",
    ", width=302 ]    recent lgt results both at vanishing and at finite quark chemical potential show that deconfinement and chiral symmetry restoration appear in qcd along the same critical line  @xcite .",
    "in general it is possible to choose the pnjl model parameters such that the both critical temperatures coincide at @xmath51 .    from fig .",
    "[ fig : phase ] one finds that the slope of @xmath52 as a function of @xmath53 is almost flat , indicating that at low temperature the chiral phase transition should appear much earlier than deconfinement . however , there are general arguments , that the deconfinement transition should precede restoration of chiral symmetry ( see e.g.  @xcite ) . in view of this",
    ", it seems unlikely that at @xmath54 the chiral symmetry sets in at the lower baryon density than deconfinement . in the pnjl model ,",
    "the parameters of the effective gluon potential were fixed by fitting quenched lgt calculations .",
    "consequently , the parameters are taken as independent on @xmath53 . however , it is conceivable that the effect of dynamical quarks can modify the coefficients of this potential , thus resulting in @xmath53dependence of the parameters",
    ". consequently , the slope of @xmath52 as a function of @xmath53 could be steeper  - and @xmath55- dependence of @xmath37 is extracted from the running coupling constant @xmath56 , using the argument based on the renormalization group . ] .",
    "consequently , the effective polyakov loop potential ( [ eff_potential ] ) should , with @xmath53-independent coefficients , be considered as a good approximation only for @xmath57 .    while the susceptibilities @xmath41 and @xmath44 exhibit expected behaviors associated with the phase transitions , other polyakov loop susceptibilities , @xmath58 are negative in a broad temperature range above @xmath47 @xcite .",
    "this is in disagreement with recent lattice results , where @xmath59 is always positive in the presence of dynamical quarks  @xcite",
    ". a possible origin of this behavior could be the approximation to the effective polyakov loop potential used in the eq .",

    "the effective polyakov loop potential ( [ eff_imp ] ) was used.,width=302 ]    the improved potential indeed yields positive values for all the polyakov loop susceptibilities .",
    "we note that the phase diagram calculated with the improved potential is similar to that obtained with the previous choice of the polyakov loop interactions , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase ] .",
    "we introduced susceptibilities related with the three different order parameters in the pnjl model , and analyzed their properties and their behavior near the phase transitions .",
    "in particular , for the quark - antiquark and chiral density - density correlations we have discussed the interplay between the restoration of chiral symmetry and deconfinement .",
    "we observed that a coincidence of the deconfinement and chiral symmetry restoration is accidental .",
    "we found that , within the mean field approximation and with the polynomial form of an effective gluon potential the correlations of the polyakov loops in the quark  quark channel show an unphysical behavior , being negative in a broad parameter range .",
    "this behavior was traced back to the parameterization of the polyakov loop potential .",
    "we argue that the @xmath64-invariance of this potential and the fit to lattice thermodynamics in the pure gluon sector is not sufficient to provide correct description of the polyakov loop fluctuations .",
