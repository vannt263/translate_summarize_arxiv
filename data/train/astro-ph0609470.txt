    "the magellanic system composed of the lmc and the smc is believed to be an interacting one where star formation histories of the clouds have been strongly influenced by dynamical and hydrodynamical effects of galaxy interaction ( ( * ? ? ? * westerlund 1997 ) ) .",
    "it is however unclear how galaxy interaction between the clouds and the galaxy triggers star formation in the gas disks of the clouds .",
    "recent observations on spatial distributions of hi ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* staveley - smith  2003 ) ) , molecular gas ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* fukui  1999 ) ) , and young stars ( ( * ? ? ? * grebel & brandner 1998 ) ) have provided vital information on galaxy - wide triggering mechanisms of star formation in the clouds . by comparing numerical simulations of the magellanic system with these observations , we here discuss ( 1 ) how the tidal interaction changes the spatial distribution of high - density gaseous regions where new stars can be formed in the lmc , ( 2 ) whether the formation of 30 doradus is triggered by the interaction , and ( 3 ) how the interaction triggers star formation in the magellanic bridge ( mb ) .",
    "we investigate the last 0.8 gyr evolution of the clouds orbiting the galaxy based on grape chemodynamical simulations of the clouds with star formation models ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* bekki  2004 ) ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* bekki & chiba 2005 ) ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* bekki & chiba 2006 ) ) .",
    "since the details of the numerical methods and the initial conditions of the clouds have been already discussed in our previous papers , we here summarize the models briefly .",
    "the total masses of the lmc and the smc are set to be @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "gas particles are assumed to be converted into new stars according to the schmidt law with the observed threshold gas density ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* kennicutt 1998 ) ) .",
    "figure 1 shows that the pericenter distance of the smc orbit with respect to the lmc is 8 kpc about 0.2 gyr ago .",
    "the tidal force from the lmc is therefore about 20 times stronger than that from the galaxy for the smc , which means that the smc can be more strongly influenced by the lmc - smc interaction than the smc - galaxy one .",
    "this lmc - smc interaction can also significantly influence the gaseous evolution of the lmc and thus its recent star formation history .",
    "strong tidal effects of the lmc - galaxy and the smc - lmc interaction can induce the formation of asymmetric spiral arms with high densities of gas so that new stars can be formed in the arms .",
    "figure 2 demonstrates that ( 1 ) the spatial distribution of young stars is quite irregular and clumpy , ( 2 ) there is a strong concentration of young stars along the stellar bar ( composed of old stars ) , and ( 3 ) there is an interesting peak just above the eastern edge of the bar .",
    "this interesting peak of the stellar density of very young stars corresponds to the location where two asymmetric spiral arms emerge in the lmc disk .",
    "the location of the peak is very similar to the location of 30 doradus , which suggests that the formation of 30 doradus is closely associated with the formation of strong spiral arms due to the last magellanic interaction about 0.2 gyr ago .",
    "the simulated two high - density gaseous arms in eastern and southern parts of the lmc are morphologically similar to the observed gaseous arms composed of molecular clouds in the southern part of the lmc ( i.e. , `` the molecular ridge '' ) .",
    "this similarity suggests that the origin of the observed peculiar distributions of molecular clouds ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* fukui  1999 ) ) is due to the recent magellanic interaction .",
    "the mean star formation rate of the lmc is increased rapidly by a factor of 5 about 0.2 gyr ago and the rapid increase is synchronized with the enhancement of the star formation rate of the smc in our models .",
    "the tidal interaction can also significantly change the recent star formation histories not only in the central region of the smc s gas disk but also in its outer part , which finally becomes the mb after the interaction .",
    "figure 3 shows that the smc s outer gas disk is strongly compressed by the interaction so that gas densities along the forming mb can exceed the threshold gas density of star formation ( i.e. , @xmath5 pc@xmath6 ) .",
    "since the mb is formed from the outer gas , where the metallicity is significantly smaller owing to the negative metallicity gradient of the smc , the metallicity distribution of new stars in the mb shows a peak of [ fe / h ] @xmath1 @xmath2 ( i.e. , 0.2 dex smaller than the central stellar metallicity of the simulated smc ) . about 25% of the initial gas mass of the smc",
    "is finally distributed in the mb whereas only 0.1% of the gas mass is converted into new stars in the mb .",
    "the present model thus provides a physical explanation for the origin of the observed formation sites of new stars along the mb ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* mizuno  2006 ) ) .",
    "the present study has suggested that tidal interaction between the clouds and the galaxy is closely associated with the formation of 30 doradus , the southern molecular ridge of the lmc , and inter - cloud stars with low metallicities .",
    "the observed asymmetric and clumpy distributions of young stars in the lmc are demonstrated to be due to the last magellanic interaction about 0.2 gyr ago , which forms asymmetric spiral arms with high - density gas .",
    "the synchronized burst of star formation in the clouds about 0.2 gyr ago ( by tidal interaction ) can be proved by the observed age distributions of young star clusters in the clouds ( e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* girardi  1995 ) ) .",
    "the simulated distributions of star - forming regions will be compared with the latest results of the spitzer observations on young stellar objects ( ysos ) in the clouds ."
