    "the interplay of disorder and interactions lays at the heart of the behaviour of many physical systems , including superfluid helium in porous media@xcite , granular and thin - film superconductors@xcite , and light propagating in disordered media@xcite .",
    "a central aspect for ultracold bosonic systems is the competition between disorder , which tends to localize particles , and weak repulsive interactions , which instead have a delocalizing effect .",
    "wheareas disorder tends to localize non - interacting particles giving rise to anderson localization@xcite , weak repulsive interactions can counteract this localization in order to minimize the energy .",
    "eventually , interactions can screen the disorder@xcite and bring the system towards a coherent , extended ground state , i.e.  a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) .",
    "systematic experimental studies of this interplay are difficult in condensed matter systems , since interactions are strong but difficult to control@xcite , while on the other hand in photonic systems only non - linearities corresponding to attractive interactions@xcite have been explored in experiments . instead , ultracold atoms in disordered optical potentials are a promising system for such investigations@xcite due to their unprecedented control over the disorder strength and interactions .",
    "in fact , they have already enabled the observation of anderson localization for bosons in the regime of negligible interactions@xcite , and recent experiments have investigated the effect of interactions on the localization properties , both in the weakly interacting@xcite and strongly correlated@xcite regimes .",
    "many theoretical predictions have been made about the properties of the complex phases appearing in these systems@xcite .",
    "in particular , various methods to characterize these phases experimentally have been proposed , including measurements of transport properties@xcite , condensate and/or superfluid fractions@xcite , excitation spectrum@xcite , overlap function@xcite , and compressibility@xcite .",
    "recent interest has been in the correlation properties of disordered , interacting bosonic systems@xcite , in order to differentiate insulating phases such as the bose glass from the superfluid regime .    here ,",
    "we expand upon and extend our previous experimental work on bosons in a bichromatic optical lattice@xcite , with an emphasis on the correlation properties of our system .",
    "we measure the localization properties , spatial correlations and coherence properties of neighbouring states as a function of the interaction energy and study the delocalization crossover in terms of these observables .",
    "in addition , we study in detail the long - range decay of the correlation function of our system .",
    "our data provide evidence of a change of decay behaviour at the crossover between insulating and superfluid phases , in agreement with theoretical predictions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in , we give an introduction to the physics of a quasiperiodic lattice , and describe the expected effects of repulsive interactions on bosonic atoms therein . in , we detail the experimental scheme , before describing the image analysis methods employed and extracted observables in . after showing the experimental results and comparing to theoretical predictions in , we summarize and give an outlook in .",

    "can be seen in for the specific case of bosons in a quasiperiodic lattice , as considered in this paper .",
    "non - interacting bosons condense into the absolute lowest energy state of the disordered potential ( a ) .",
    "the defining characteristic of this anderson localized state is its exponential shape . adding repulsive interactions is expected to have a delocalizing effect .",
    "this can be understood in terms of a screening argument@xcite .",
    "repulsive interactions serve to smooth over the disordering potential in the occupied sites , providing a flatter energetic landscape on which more extended states can form . for",
    "very weak interactions , several low energy eigenstates of the non - interacting system can become populated ( b ) .",
    "this regime , in which several exponentially localized states coexist without phase coherence , is often identified with an anderson glass@xcite , or lifshitz glass@xcite . at larger interaction energies ,",
    "an increasing number of sites is occupied , including neighbouring wells .",
    "when these states overlap , locally coherent fragments are expected to form ( c ) . in this case , global phase coherence would not yet be restored , and the local shape of the states might be modified .",
    "some authors have called this regime a ` fragmented bec'@xcite or bose glass@xcite .",
    "the number of independent fragments should decrease for larger interaction energies , until finally , for sufficiently large interaction strengths a single , extended phase - coherent state is formed , that is , a macroscopic bec ( d ) .",
    "the centre of the crossover from localized to extended , coherent states is expected to occur when the interaction energy is comparable to the standard deviation of disorder energy .     and @xmath0 .",
    "the gray stripe shows the energy of the first band of the combined lattice , with width @xmath1 .",
    "the quasi - periodic lattice is characterized by potential wells approximately every @xmath2  lattice sites , which arise from the beating of the two lattices ( grey dashed line ) . in red ,",
    "the lowest energy eigenstates of the lattice potential are shown . where two lattice sites are nearly equal in energy in a characteristic well , the potential looks locally like a double well , and there exist symmetric ( red ) and anti - symmetric ( blue dashed ) eigenstates , with an energy splitting of @xmath3 . ]",
    "our system uses a particular kind of disorder , namely a quasiperiodic potential .",
    "this consists of two overlapping lattices with incommensurate wavelengths .",
    "the resulting potential can be seen as a strong primary lattice of periodicity @xmath4 which is perturbed by a weaker secondary lattice of periodicity @xmath5 ( @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the wavelength of the light generating the lattice ) .",
    "the lattice potential can then be written as @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the recoil energy for the primary lattice ( @xmath10 is the atomic mass ) , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 are the heights of the lattices in units of their recoil energies .",
    "the lattice spacing of such a potential is to good approximation given by that of the primary lattice @xmath13@xcite .",

    "it should be noted that this differs both from the case of a randomly disordered system , for which any non - zero amount of disorder is sufficient to localize the system in one dimension@xcite , and from the case of a speckle potential , for which effective mobility edges exist due to the correlated disorder@xcite .     for @xmath21 .",

    "a first striking feature is the appearance of minigaps in the spectrum , the lowest of which has approximately the same width for all values of @xmath22 .",
    "the appearance of minigaps can be understood from the distribution of lattice sites in the characteristic potential wells ( see ) .",
    "the absolute lowest energy eigenstates are those for which a lattice site coincides with the minimum of a potential well .",
    "in contrast , when two neighbouring lattice sites are nearly symmetric in potential energy in a well , the potential appears locally like a double well , for which the two lowest - lying eigenstates have a separation in energy of @xmath3 .",
    "in fact , the width of the lowest minigap is approximately @xmath3 throughout the range of @xmath22 shown .",
    "the lowest `` miniband '' of energies corresponds to the lowest energy eigenstates localized in the potential wells @xmath23 apart .",
    "since in the experiment , only the states in the first `` miniband '' are populated , we restrict our analysis to these energies and show their standard deviation @xmath24 and the extension @xmath25 of this band .",

    "the production of a bec of @xmath26k has been described in detail previously@xcite .",

    "is initially prepared in a crossed dipole trap .",
    "the condensate is loaded into the quasi - periodic potential while the optical trap is decompressed in about 250 ms to reduce the harmonic confinement , and a gravity - compensating magnetic field gradient is added . at the same time , the scattering length @xmath28 is changed by means of the broad feshbach resonance to values ranging from @xmath29 to about @xmath30 . at the end of this procedure ,",
    "the lattice lasers give a harmonic confinement of @xmath31  hz in the radial direction . in the vertical ( axial )",
    "direction , a weak confinement of 5  hz is given by a weak optical trap as well as by a curvature from the gravity - compensating magnetic field .",
    "the primary lattice is generated by a nd : yag laser with a wavelength @xmath32  nm and a strength @xmath21 , which is well within the tight binding regime .",
    "the secondary lattice is generated by a ti : sapphire laser of wavelength @xmath33  nm and variable strength up to @xmath34 .",
    "for these experimental parameters , the separation of neighbouring states is given on average by @xmath35 lattice sites .",
    "we estimate that around 30 lattice sites , corresponding to about 7 adjacent localized states , are populated during the loading of the lattice .",
    "we then define a mean interaction energy per particle @xmath36 , where @xmath37 and @xmath38 is a gaussian approximation to the on - site wannier function .",
    "we include coupling into the radial directions of our system , with the consequence that the interaction energy is non - linear in the scattering length .",

    ", several independent low - lying excited states are populated even when it would be energetically favourable to populate just the ground state .",
    "a loss of adiabaticity can be seen experimentally as a transfer of energy into the radial direction .",
    "we measure a radial temperature and condensed fraction by fitting the radial profiles extracted from the absorption images with a two - component fitting function . in our previous work@xcite ,",
    "a radial heating was seen to occur in a region of large disorder and weak interactions . in this work ,",
    "the disorder strength is smaller and as a consequence the radial temperature as well as the condensate fraction are approximately constant throughout the parameter range explored ( ) .",
    "the system can be characterized by analyzing its momentum distribution and derived fourier transforms .",
    "these techniques are used to extract information both about the local shape of the wavefunction , spatial correlations , and the coherence properties of neighbouring states .",

    "this time is sufficiently long in order to be in the `` far - field '' limit@xcite . at the time of release ,",
    "the scattering length is set to below @xmath42 in less than one ms and kept there until the feshbach magnetic field is switched off 10  ms before taking the image  at this point , the system has expanded a sufficient amount to neglect the effect of interactions .",
    "after such a long free expansion without interactions , the image of the atoms that is acquired is approximately the in - trap momentum distribution @xmath43 @xcite , where @xmath44 is the fourier transform of the bosonic field operator @xmath45 . in order to recover information about the in - trap wavefunction , we can therefore use an inverse fourier transform .",

    "the overall in - trap wavefunction can therefore be approximated as @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the local phase , and @xmath48 can be taken as a generalized exponential function @xmath52 . in momentum space , the magnitude of the overall wavefunction can then be written as @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is an interference term . for many envelope functions @xmath48 , such as the generalized exponentials with @xmath55 ,",
    "the fourier transform @xmath56 itself is real and non - negative@xcite , so that the inverse fourier transform of @xmath57 can be written as @xmath58 .",
    "this is simply the convolution of the envelope of a single state @xmath48 with the fourier transform of the interference term , @xmath59 , which can be approximately described as a series of sharp peaks ( approaching @xmath60-distributions ) spaced by @xmath61 , with a decreasing amplitude and phases that depend on the local phases @xmath51 and amplitudes @xmath62 .",
    "the inverse fourier transform of the square root of the momentum distribution @xmath63 therefore allows an estimate of the average local shape of the ( wave)function @xmath48 . the smallest cloud size observable with the imaging system employed is about 12  @xmath64 m , therefore there is a finite resolution also in momentum space ( about @xmath65 ) . due to this finite resolution",
    ", the fourier transform has an envelope with a width of about 10 lattice sites .",
    "this means that we can only distinguish easily up to three neighbouring states .",
    "the averaged wavefunction is analyzed by fitting to the sum of three generalized exponential functions modulated by the primary lattice @xmath66 \\cdot \\left [ 1+b\\cos(k_1 x + \\delta ) \\right ] , \\label{eq : expfit}\\ ] ] see for examples . from such a fit , the exponent @xmath67 and the local extension of the states @xmath68 can be extracted .",
    "on the other hand , the inverse fourier transform of the momentum distribution itself can be employed to find the correlation properties of neighbouring states .",
    "the momentum distribution can be related to the first order correlation function @xmath69 .",
    "we analyze the spatially averaged correlation function , which , using the wiener - khinchin theorem , can be expressed as @xmath70 experimentally , @xmath71 is recovered simply by taking the fourier transform of the momentum distribution .",

    ", the finite momentum resolution limits our analysis to three neighbouring sites , and it follows that @xmath46 ( @xmath47 ) saturates at a value around 0.6 ( 0.3 ) .    more information about the extent and decay of the spatially averaged correlation function can be gained by examining the fourier transform of the momentum distribution at larger distances . while the detailed structure there is not resolvable , making the data there unsuited for the analysis described above , we can extract information about the general shape of @xmath71 .",

    "et al_.  in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "finally , the effect of a fluctuating phase between neighbouring states is seen as a shift of the phase @xmath77 of the interference in the momentum distribution .",

    "we present measurements of the quantities described in the previous section for two cuts of the phase diagram shown in ref .",
    "this data was taken for @xmath21 , corresponding to a value of the tunneling energy of @xmath80  hz , and for two values of the disorder strength , @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "both lattice strengths were calibrated by bragg diffraction@xcite , with an estimated error on @xmath22 of around 15% .",
    "the results of the analysis of localization properties as well as correlation of nearest and next - nearest neighbouring states are shown in , where we plot the local extension of the states @xmath68 , the exponent @xmath67 , and the correlation function evaluated at @xmath23 and @xmath83 , as a function of the interaction energy @xmath41 .",
    "we find that for very small @xmath41 , the states are exponentially localized , since the exponent @xmath84 , and the local length @xmath68 is small , consistent with the anderson glass regime . increasing @xmath41 , the local length increases and the exponent increases up to @xmath85 .",
    "repulsive interactions therefore delocalize the system as expected , or alternatively , the localization crossover is shifted to higher values of the disorder strength @xmath22 when interactions are introduced into the system . in the localized regime ,",
    "the correlation is finite but small , due to the occupation of independent neighbouring localized states arising from the non - adiabatic loading .",
    "as @xmath41 is increased , the correlation features a crossover towards larger values , signalling that coherence is progressively established locally over distances of first @xmath23 and then @xmath83 .",
    "the position of this crossover is in good agreement with the prediction of the simple disorder screening argument , from which we expect the centre of the crossover to occur when @xmath41 is comparable to the standard deviation of energies in the lowest miniband . for @xmath0 ( @xmath39 ) , this is given by @xmath86 ( @xmath87 ) .",

    "the dash - dotted line gives the standard deviation for a purely random distribution .",
    "the dashed ( dotted ) lines gives the standard deviation ( full extension ) of energies in the lowest miniband.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]    information about the phase coherence of neighbouring states can be obtained by measuring the phase @xmath77 of the interference pattern in the momentum distribution for repeated runs of the experiment with the same parameters . if the states are not phase locked , @xmath77 changes almost randomly at each repetition of the experimental sequence . in",
    "we show the standard deviation of @xmath77 , estimated from a large number of repetitions of the experiment .",
    "we see a decrease of the phase fluctuations with increasing @xmath41 , that nevertheless remain relatively large in the crossover region where the correlation increases .",
    "the fluctuations finally drop to the background value only when @xmath41 is comparable to the full width of the lowest miniband of the non - interacting spectrum ( dotted lines in ) .",
    "these observations confirm that in the localized regime the states are totally independent , which together with the localization properties ( ) indicates that the system can indeed be described as an anderson glass@xcite .",
    "the system crosses a large region of only partial coherence while becoming progressively less localized as @xmath41 is increased .",
    "this is consistent with the formation of locally coherent fragments expected for a fragmented bec .",
    "an analogous fragmentation behaviour was reported in ref .  . ultimately , the features of a single extended , coherent state are seen , i.e.  a bec .    , the red squares for @xmath39 .",
    "the grey triangles are for a single lattice ( @xmath40 ) , fit to a single generalized exponential function .",
    "the dashed line denotes the average separation of states , @xmath23 .",
    "the error bars denote the standard error of the mean.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]    finally , we show the overall behaviour of the correlation function in .",
    "the correlation length @xmath76 increases at larger interaction energy to values larger than the mean separation of states ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "it saturates at values around @xmath90 , consistent with the imaging resolution , for both quasiperiodic and single lattice potentials .",
    "the increase in correlation length shows that the average size of fragments found in the fragmented bec regime increases with @xmath41 until presumably only a single fragment describes the system .",
    "the exponent @xmath75 of @xmath71 is seen to increase from values of around @xmath91 to values slightly larger than @xmath92 .",
    "while such an increase is qualitatively expected , the values of @xmath75 are not in agreement with expectations from theory . for a three - dimensional bose gas at zero temperature",
    ", we expect a transition from exponential decay ( @xmath93 ) in the insulating regime@xcite to a shape of the correlation function given by the confining potential , @xmath94 in our case . in our analysis",
    ", any finite thermal component artificially reduces the exponent by increasing the values of the fourier transform at small @xmath95 values .",
    "indeed , we observe an exponent of @xmath96 or less even in the single lattice potential , for which the system is superfluid . in the quasiperiodic lattice , the exponent approaches that of the single lattice potential for large values of the interaction energy .",
    "the decrease of @xmath76 and @xmath75 at large values of @xmath41 can presumably be explained by an imperfect removal of interaction energy from the system during the initial stage of expansion from the lattice .",
    "this would lead to a broader peak in the momentum distribution , and therefore a narrower shape at short distances in the correlation function .    in recent theoretical works on disordered bosonic systems",
    ", the change of shape of the correlation function in one dimension from exponential decay to algebraic decay was used to distinguish the bose glass from the superfluid phase@xcite .",
    "these theoretical investigations have the advantage of being able to consider large system sizes , where a jump in the first order correlation function @xmath97 is an indication that fragments form , leading to an exponential decay of @xmath71 in the bose glass regime . in the experiment , the correlation function can only be recovered for smaller distances , due to the finite imaging resolution and system size .",
    "fragments with sizes larger than approximately @xmath98 can not be distinguished from the superfluid . in this sense",
    ", the evolution of the shape of the correlation function can give information about the crossover from the anderson glass to the fragmented bec ( where the correlation length starts to increase ) , but can not quantify the crossover to the superfluid in our current system .",
    "use of a higher resolution imaging system and eventually larger system sizes could enable the observation of the shape of the correlation function at larger distances . the crossover from fragmented bec to superfluid could then be quantified .",
    "in conclusion , we have characterized the entire delocalization crossover of a disordered bosonic system caused by weak repulsive interactions through study of the spatial localization , phase coherence , and correlation properties . in particular , we have shown the first experimental determination of the shape of the correlation function in such a system .",
    "we find three different regimes , in agreement with theoretical predictions . at vanishing interaction energy ,",
    "the system can be described as an anderson glass ( or lifshitz glass ) , with exponentially localized eigenstates without phase coherence between them . as @xmath41 is increased , the local shape of the states changes , and coherence is gradually established , leading to an increase of the size of locally coherent fragments .",
    "this regime is consistent with a fragmented bec , or bose glass . finally , for sufficiently large @xmath41",
    ", the features of a single , extended coherent state are observed , and the system returns to a bec .",
    "the position of the crossover is in good agreement with the predictions of a simple disorder screening argument for the lowest `` miniband '' .",
    "the techniques shown here are quite general and might be of use for further investigations of disordered systems .",
    "in particular , the analysis of the correlation function can also be used for experimental systems utilizing speckles@xcite , for which the methods described here could easily distinguish superfluid and insulating phases . in the current experiment ,",
    "the length scale over which the correlation function could be observed was primarily limited by the imaging resolution . more generally , the finite expansion time is expected to be a more important limitation@xcite , especially when investigating larger sized systems .",
    "the required expansion time can easily be estimated by considering an in - trap wavepacket with a gaussian width of @xmath99 . in momentum space",
    ", this corresponds to a width @xmath100 . after a ballistic expansion for time @xmath101 after release of the wavepacket from the confining trap , this momentum component will move a distance @xmath102 . in order to see the features of the initial wavepacket",
    ", this distance must be larger than @xmath99 , which implies that the expansion time must be larger than @xmath103 .",
    "in reference@xcite for a coherent wavepacket . ] for our parameters , this is approximately 35  ms , less than the expansion time of 46.5  ms used .",
    "however , we must consider also our finite imaging resolution @xmath104 , which can be estimated to artificially increase the width of the initial cloud to @xmath105 . given our resolution @xmath106  @xmath64 m , this suggests a necessary expansion time of 120  ms , much longer than what is used in the experiment .",
    "however , a modest improvement of the imaging resolution to 5  @xmath64 m would be sufficient to analyze the correlation function up to distances of 30 sites .    in the future , the fourier analysis techniques might be used to explore the regime of strong correlations , @xmath107 , which can be reached by using a quasi-1d system with strong radial confinement . there",
    ", the bose glass can be attributed to the _ cooperation _ of disorder and interactions .",
    "there is however still debate on the exact shape of the phase diagram in this regime , particulary concerning the possibility of reentrant superfluidity@xcite .",
