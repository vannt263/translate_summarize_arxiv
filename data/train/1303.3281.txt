    "quantum phase transitions ( qpts ) are essential phenomena in quantum many - body correlated systems which is induced by the ground - state ( gs ) transition .",
    "this can be driven by tuning an external parameters at zero temperature , for instance , the magnetic field or the amount of disorder .",
    "traditionally , qpts are described in terms of order parameter and symmetry breaking by the landau - ginzburg paradigm .",
    "the problem in these traditional ways is that there is no general method to find the order parameter for a common system . in the last few years",
    "a big effort has been assigned to the analysis of the qpts from the perspective of quantum information @xcite .",
    "entanglement and fidelity have been accepted as new notion to characterize quantum phase transitions .",
    "entanglement , referring to quantum correlations between subsystems is a good indicator of quantum phase transitions , because the correlation length diverge at the quantum critical points @xcite .",
    "the fidelity which is a measure of distance between quantum states , could be also a nice tool to study the drastic change in the ground states in quantum phase transitions @xcite .",
    "in view of some difficulties @xcite , attention has been transferred to include other , potentially related , means of characterizing qpts @xcite .",
    "one such approach centers around the concept of geometric phase ( gp ) .",
    "geometric phases which display the curvature of the hilbert space , and especially has direct relation to the property of the degeneracy in quantum systems , were introduced in quantum mechanics by berry in 1984 @xcite .",
    "thus the gp is a powerful tool to find out the quantum phase transitions @xcite .",
    "the attention has also increased due to their applicability in quantum - information processing @xcite . in other words , gp becomes additive for product states of composite systems since the uncorrelated subsystems set independent geometric phase factors . however , due to their global properties , the gp is propitious to make fault tolerant quantum gates . in this point of view , many physical systems have been studied to realize geometric quantum computation , such as nmr ( nuclear magnetic resonance ) , josephson junction , ion trap and semiconductor quantum dots .",
    "the quantum computation scheme for the geometric phase has been proposed based on the abelian or non - abelian geometric phase , in which geometric phase has been used to be robust against faults in the presence of some kind of external noise due to the geometric nature of berry phase .",
    "it was therefore seen that interactions play an important role for the understanding of some specific operations .",
    "for the first time a. carollo _ at al_. ,",
    "show the gp connection to the quantum phase transitions , where they have been shown that the geometric phase of the spin chains diverge at the critical point @xcite .",
    "the critical exponents were evaluated from the scaling behavior of geometric phases has been obtained by s. l. zhu _ at al _ , @xcite .",
    "then the geometric phase have been considered as a topological test to manifest quantum phase transitions @xcite .    in the present work",
    ", we shall use the geometric phase and fidelity of the ground state to detect the qpts for the one - dimensional extended quantum compass model @xcite in a transverse filed to confirm the results obtained in our previous works @xcite .",

    "it is worthy to mention that not only this inhomogeneous system exhibits rich phase diagram , it would be interesting to investigate whether the geometric phase is able to determine the quantum phase transition in these more complicated systems .",
    "however , an explicit analytical expression of the ground state , which is necessary for studying the geometric phase and fidelity , has not been calculated so far .",
