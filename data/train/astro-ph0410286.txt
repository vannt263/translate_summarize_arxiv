    "hot subdwarfs were selected from the _ catalogue of spectroscopically identified hot subdwarfs _",
    "the observed sample consists of 20 single and 54 composite hot subdwarfs ( primarily classified as sdb ) that have @xmath3 .",
    "composite subdwarfs for this sample were defined to have @xmath4  @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "there are also 6 subdwarfs that have close ( @xmath610@xmath7 ) resolved companions , and 5 that show emission lines ( 4 met our composite color criterion ) .",
    "eighty - four stars ( 52 main sequence , 32 subgiant ) with parallax measurements from _ hipparcos _ were selected to provide empirical calibration .",
    "they cover the pop  i main sequence from early f to early m - type , and post - main sequence subgiants from f to k - type ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 @xmath10 , and @xmath11 ) .",
    "spectra were taken with the goldcam spectrograph on the kitt peak national observatory 2.1 m telescope .",
    "the wavelength interval 46008900   was covered at @xmath01.3   / pixel , using two spectrograph setups .",
    "this wavelength range includes h@xmath1 , h@xmath2 , h - paschen 11@xmath12limit , mg  i  b , na  i  d , ca  ii infrared triplet ( cat ) , he  i 5875 and 6678   .",
    "unfortunate observing conditions prevented accurate flux calibration on most nights , so we consider the normalized spectra only .",
    "example spectra are shown in fig .",
    "equivalent width ( ew ) indices were measured for prominent lines after fitting local continua in the regions of the lines of interest .",
    "we focus on the cat , na  i  d , and mg  i  b lines .",
    "kurucz flux distributions were matched to the cool standards based on colors , with @xmath13 used for main sequence standards and lower gravities for the subgiants .",
    "high gravity ( @xmath14 ) models with t@xmath15  = 20000 , 26000 , and 32000  k were used as proxies for hot subdwarfs .",
    "the observed ew for the measured lines of each of the standard stars were diluted by creating a composite with one of the three proxies , using the flux distributions to scale the contributions of the two stars appropriately . for a given hot subdwarf+cool companion combination ,",
    "each of the ew indices is diluted by a different amount , according to the wavelength - dependent ratio of fluxes from the two stars , assuming radii for the hot subdwarfs from ( * ? ?",
    "* zero age horizontal branch ) and main sequence radii from @xcite ( subgiants were scaled based on their _ hipparcos _",
    "m@xmath16 ) .",
    "the three ews ( cat , na  i , mg  i ) form a three dimensional space .",
    "most of the information can be shown in the 2-d subspace defined by ( [ @xmath17 @xmath18 , [ @xmath19 ) . using this projection , ews for composite hot subdwarfs",
    "are plotted in fig .",
    "[ ratio]@xmath20 with diluted and undiluted ews from main sequence standards ( upper panel ) , and subgiant standards ( lower ) .",
    "three arrows indicate the direction and magnitude of @xmath21   for cat , mg  i , and na  i.    in both panels of fig .",
    "[ ratio]@xmath20 , cooler _ undiluted _ standard stars ( star symbols ) are to the right , hotter to the left .",
    "however , in the upper panel , the cooler ( fainter ) _ diluted _ main sequence standards are at the bottom , while in the lower panel the cooler ( brighter ) _ diluted _ subgiants are to the upper right ( in both cases the 20kk hot subdwarf causes the greatest amount of dilution , while the 32kk subdwarf causes the least ) .",
    "both effects are due to the respective trends of m@xmath22 vs.  t@xmath23 .    from fig .",
    "[ ratio]@xmath20 , it is seen that the ew indices can in most cases be accounted for by composite models involving main sequence companions ; models with subgiants are less successful .",
    "diluted color indices were calculated using observed visual and 2mass magnitudes for the standards , and combining them with theoretical colors for the three hot subdwarf temperatures ( 32kk , 26kk , 20kk ) based on @xcite with 2mass color transformations taken from @xcite .",
    "the contributions from the two stars were scaled using m@xmath16 from _ hipparcos _ for the standards , @xmath24 for the hot subdwarfs from @xcite , and bolometric corrections for both standards and hot subdwarfs from @xcite .",
    "standards were matched to models based on color .",
    "the color indices ( , @xmath25 ) are shown for the observed composite hot subdwarfs , and for each standard diluted by a 32kk , a 26kk , and a 20kk hot subdwarf in fig .",
    "[ ratio]@xmath26 ; in this color space composite - colored stars are clearly separated from single - colored stars ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "as with the ews (  [ ewcompare ] ) , the color of most composite hot subdwarfs can be explained using models involving main sequence companions , while models with subgiants are less successful .",
    "treating the diluted ew measurements and diluted 2mass colors indices for each standard star as a `` model '' , the @xmath27 value can be calculated between each composite subdwarf and each `` model '' to find a best fit .",
    "preliminary results indicate that most composite hot subdwarfs in our sample favor 26kk or 32kk hot subdwarfs with _",
    "main sequence companions _ in the range of @xmath28 ( roughly late - f to mid - k spectral type ) . however , there are a few objects that favor only subgiant models , and a few that equally accept a hotter ( 26kk or 32kk ) hot subdwarf with a main sequence companion , or a cooler ( 20kk ) hot subdwarf with a subgiant companion .",
    "more work is needed to break these degeneracies ; in particular temperature estimates ( from uv spectra or galex observations ) for the hot subdwarfs would be useful .",
    "also , we will replace the sparse and noisy observational model grid with a smooth grid interpolated from the observed behaviors .",
    "we obtained spectra of composite colored hot subdwarfs and single cool standard stars with _ hipparcos _ parallaxes .",
    "preliminary analysis indicates _",
    "the majority of cool companions in composite hot subdwarf systems are consistent with the main sequence_. overall , subgiant companions do not explain the observed colors and ews for the majority of composite hot subdwarfs ; but they are not excluded in some cases if the hot subdwarf is relatively cool ( i.e. , @xmath020kk ) . further analysis of additional features in individual spectra and refinement of the model grids is needed to distinguish between main sequence and subgiant in these cases .",
    "an independent measure of the temperatures of the hot subdwarfs ( from iue spectra or galex fluxes ) would further constrain uncertain cases ."
