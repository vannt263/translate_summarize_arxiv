    "in hybrid superconductor / ferromagnet ( sc / fm ) bilayers the fm modifies quite substantially the superconducting properties of the sc layer . in particular , strong vortex pinning was reported recently for superconducting films covering arrays of ferromagnetic dots with in - plane @xcite and out - of - plane magnetization , @xcite and for continuous sc / fm bilayers .",
    "@xcite theoretical investigations showed that supercurrents and vortices can be induced in the sc by the stray field of the fm , @xcite and that the domain structure of soft fm s can be influenced by the presence of the sc .",
    "@xcite + furthermore , @xcite predicted the appearance of the so - called @xmath6-phase state in sc / fm multilayers , where the phase of the superconducting order parameter @xmath7 shifts by @xmath6 when crossing a ferromagnetic layer .",
    "@xcite recently the existence of the @xmath6-phase state was confirmed by observing sharp cusps in the temperature dependence of the critical current in sc / fm / sc junctions .",
    "@xcite earlier experiments were performed in order to find the @xmath6-phase state by measuring the predicted oscillatory dependence of the critical temperature @xmath8 of sc / fm multilayers on the fm layer thickness @xmath9 .",
    "@xcite however , the results of these experiments were not conclusive , because the nonmonotonic @xmath10 behavior could also appear due to the presence of magnetically `` dead '' layers at the sc / fm interfaces . @xcite + the theory of the anomalous @xmath10 dependence is based on the usadel equations @xcite describing the proximity effect of fm and sc layers , but neglecting a possible influence of the domains in the fm . in this manuscript we will show that an inhomogeneous stray field @xmath11 produced by the domain structure of a fm can actually also lead to a significant change in @xmath8 . to demonstrate this effect , we measure @xmath8 as a function of the perpendicularly applied magnetic field @xmath0 of a pb film on top of a co / pt multilayer with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy . in this sample",
    "the proximity effect is suppressed by an amorphous ge layer between pb and co / pt . the domain structure in the co / pt multilayer can consist of stable band or bubble domains .",
    "the fm layer can also be in a single domain state , depending on the preceding magnetization procedure , as was shown in a recent study of the vortex pinning in this system .",
    "@xcite due to field cancellation effects between @xmath0 and @xmath11 , and due to the suppression of @xmath7 by @xmath11 , @xmath12 can be controlled by changing the microscopic domain structure .",
    "the properties of the co / pt multilayer have been described before .",
    "@xcite briefly , the multilayer has a [ co(0.4  nm)/pt(1.0  nm)]@xmath13 structure on a 2.8  nm pt base layer on a si / sio@xmath14 substrate .",
    "the magnetic properties were characterized by the magneto - optical kerr effect ( moke ) and magnetic force microscopy ( mfm ) , revealing that the sample has perpendicular magnetic anisotropy .",

    "perpendicular to the sample surface .",
    "mfm images ( 5  @xmath17  5  @xmath18 ) show that the domain structure of the sample consists of band domains after out - of - plane demagnetization ( b ) , bubble domains in the @xmath19 ( c ) and @xmath20 ( d ) states . ]",
    "the loop has an almost rectangular shape with @xmath21  mt , @xmath22  mt , and @xmath23  mt , where @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the nucleation , coercive and saturation field , respectively , and @xmath27 is the permeability of the vacuum .",
    "+ using different magnetization procedures , one can produce different stable domain patterns in the sample .",
    "for instance , after out - of - plane demagnetization , band domains are observed by mfm , see fig .",
    "[ moke](b ) .",
    "stable bubble domains with local magnetic moments @xmath28 either pointing up ( @xmath29 ) or down ( @xmath30 ) perpendicular to the sample surface can be created by applying a negative field of @xmath31  t , sweeping @xmath0 to a positive value between @xmath24 and @xmath26 , and then removing @xmath0 .",
    "the parameter @xmath32 , which gives the fraction of magnetic moments that are pointing up ( @xmath29 ) to the total amount of magnetic moments , is used to describe the different remanent magnetic states obtained after this magnetization procedure .",
    "the value of @xmath32 can be found from the mfm images by dividing the dark area ( @xmath29 ) by the total area , or from measurements of @xmath15 as will be described later .",
    "+ the lateral size of the domain structures can be estimated from the mfm images .",
    "the typical diameter of the bubble domains is about @xmath33  nm .",
    "the same value is obtained for the average width of the band domains .",
    "although the magnetic moments of the co / pt multilayer are equally distributed between up- and down - directions in both the demagnetized and the @xmath34 state , there are distinct differences between these two domain states : in the demagnetized state the lateral size of the domain is larger ( because band domains are extended in one direction ) .",
    "note also that in the demagnetized state , the boundary between domains with magnetization pointing up and down is well defined , but not straight : several sharp corners of different angles can be seen .",
    "no mfm images could be obtained for the @xmath34 state , caused by the difficult magnetization procedure due to the steep slope of the @xmath35 curve , see fig .",
    "[ moke](a ) .",
    "however , from the image of the @xmath19 state , see fig .",
    "[ moke](c ) , one can observe that the domain walls are less sharp defined than in the demagnetized state .",
    "after characterizing the properties of the fm , a 10  nm ge film , a 50  nm pb film and a 30  nm ge capping layer are subsequently evaporated on the co / pt multilayer at a substrate temperature of 77  k. the amorphous ge film between pb and co / pt is insulating at low temperatures , so that the proximity effects between pb and co / pt are suppressed .",
    "+ the upper critical field @xmath36 of bulk type - ii scs is given by @xcite @xmath37 with @xmath38 = 2.068  mt  @xmath39m@xmath40 the superconducting flux quantum , @xmath41 the temperature dependent coherence length in the dirty limit , and @xmath42 the critical temperature at zero field .",
    "hence , the linear slope of @xmath36 as a function of temperature is only determined by the coherence length @xmath43 .",
    "+ @xmath44 can behave differently when the geometry of the sc is changed , e.g. for thin films with thickness @xmath45 .",
    "while eq .",

    "in fact , this formula also gives the phase boundary of a mesoscopic line in perpendicular field , because the cross section , exposed to the applied field , is the same for a film of thickness @xmath47 in parallel @xmath0 and for a mesoscopic line in perpendicular @xmath0 .",
    "@xcite for multiply connected mesoscopic lines , @xmath12 can show an even more complex behavior due to fluxoid quantization effects .",
    "@xcite + the phase boundary of the sc / fm bilayer was measured in a quantum design superconducting quantum interference device ( squid ) magnetometer with @xmath0 applied perpendicular to the surface .",
    "[ mt ] shows the data obtained in two field cooled measurements of the total magnetization @xmath48 ( @xmath49 is the magnetization of the sc ) at the applied field of @xmath50  mt , after the samples were brought in the @xmath34 and @xmath51 states .",

    "these kinds of measurements were used to determine @xmath12 as the temperature where @xmath55 starts to deviate from @xmath15 . repeating these measurements at several applied fields",
    "@xmath56  mt did not change the offset @xmath15 above @xmath8 , implying an unchanged domain state .      the phase boundary for the @xmath51 state ( all @xmath58 ) obtained by several @xmath59 measurements in varying fields is shown in fig .",

    "( b )  schematic drawing of the stray field @xmath11 when the fm is in the @xmath51 state . ]    a linear behavior of the phase boundary is observed , which can be fitted by eq .",
    "[ one ] with @xmath60  nm and @xmath61  k. this implies that in this state , the fm has no influence on the superconducting film , because both the linear behavior and the values of @xmath42 and @xmath62 are in good agreement with those of pure pb films .",
    "@xcite it is important to note that the temperature dependence of @xmath63 derived for this domain state is the same for all domain states , since we are always dealing with the same pb film .",
    "+ let us consider the magnetic stray field @xmath11 of a homogeneously magnetized film in the @xmath51 state , schematically drawn in fig .",
    "[ pbmag](b ) .",
    "@xmath11 has its largest amplitude at the sample boundary and is negligible above the center of the fm .",
    "intuitively this can be understood by considering the stray field of a single magnetic dipole in the center of the sample : the negative field above the dipole is compensated by the returning positive stray field of the surrounding magnetic dipoles .",
    "therefore , the main central part of the superconductor is only weakly influenced by @xmath11 , and the measured @xmath57 curve resembles the one of a single pb film .      the phase boundary for the demagnetized state , corresponding to the mfm image shown in fig .",

    "the difference between the phase boundaries in the demagnetized and the @xmath51 state can be attributed to the influence of the stray field @xmath11 , suppressing the order parameter in the superconductor above @xmath65  k. the coherence length at this temperature is @xmath66  nm .",
    "this means that superconductivity nucleates when the value of @xmath43 becomes smaller than approximately the width of the band domains .",
    "the nucleation first takes place in regions of the pb film where the effective field in the @xmath67-direction @xmath68 is minimum .",
    "the confinement of these superconducting nuclei leads to the different @xmath57 dependence compared to the magnetized state .",
    "_ have very recently calculated the @xmath12 phase boundary of similar systems as the one that is experimentally investigated here in the framework of the linearized ginzburg - landau equation.@xcite they found , in agreement with our experimental result , that the upper critical field of a superconducting film can have very unusual temperature dependencies when a single domain wall or periodic domain structures are present in a ferromagnetic film that is in contact with the superconductor .",
    "based on these considerations , we can conclude that the increased slope of the @xmath57 curve may be related to the specific domain pattern in the demagnetized state .",
    "+ the mfm image in fig .",
    "[ moke](b ) shows an equal contrast above all bright or dark domains , indicating that @xmath11 is rather homogeneous above the domains , and inhomogeneous above the domain walls , which define some sharp corners . from calculations of the upper critical field of mesoscopic superconducting structures , e.g. , triangles or squares",
    ", it is well known that the nucleation of superconductivity takes place first in the corners of these structures .",
    "@xcite therefore , when trying to calculate the @xmath57 phase boundary in order to explain the increased slope , one should take into account these corners formed by the domain walls .",
    "this could be done by expanding the one - dimensional model used by aladyshkin _",
    "et al_@xcite to two dimensions .",

    "moreover , both @xmath57 curves shown in fig .  [ pbbub](a ) show a non - linear behavior with bumps in the field ranges around @xmath73  mt . + to explain the asymmetric @xmath57 curves , let us assume that the sample contains bubble domains with @xmath29 in a matrix of magnetic moments with @xmath30 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ pbbub](b ) : @xmath74 is positive above the bubbles and negative between them .",

    "is that the absolute value of @xmath74 is larger above the @xmath29 regions ( bubbles ) compared to the @xmath30 regions ( between the bubbles ) . when the sample is cooled in positive @xmath0 , superconductivity can nucleate at higher temperatures in the area between the bubbles ( where @xmath75 ) , compared to cooling the sample in the corresponding negative @xmath0 , where the nucleation takes place in the areas above the bubbles .",
