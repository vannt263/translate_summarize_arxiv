    "resonant magnetic perturbations ( rmps ) are one of the promising methods of edge - localized mode ( elm ) control in future tokamak reactors  @xcite , which is necessary as already for iter it is predicted that at full plasma current uncontrolled elms can not be tolerated  @xcite . the rmps either suppress the elms completely or cause a change of the elm character towards smaller energy loss and higher frequency  @xcite . the latter effect is called elm mitigation and may be a viable option for elm control on iter if the reduction in peak heat load at the divertor is sufficient to protect the plasma - facing components .",
    "one major unknown parameter in the predictions of tolerable elm sizes is the elm wetted area , which together with the total elm loss determines the peak heat load on the plasma - facing components  @xcite .",
    "the compatibility of mitigated elms with plasma - facing components is therefore not only determined by the elm energy loss reduction achieved , but also by any changes of the wetted area accompanying the mitigation  @xcite . as an example , it was observed on mast that mitigation achieves a less significant reduction of peak elm heat load than of the total elm loss due to a concurrent reduction of the wetted area  @xcite .",
    "similar results were reported on jet with the carbon wall  @xcite . on the contrary on jet with the iter - like wall",
    "the reduction of the peak heat load during elm mitigation was partly due to an increase of the wetted area  @xcite .",
    "the study of spatial structure of elm loads and its changes due to mitigation is thus important for extrapolating elm mitigation scenarios and still an open area of research .",
    "one significant change of the spatial structure of elm loads on divertor during mitigation was observed on diii - d  @xcite , mast  @xcite and nstx  @xcite : the power is deposited predominantly in the footprint structures  @xcite formed by the magnetic perturbation . on mast it is observed only at the early stage of the elm , though .",
    "this effect may be one of the contributing factors to the wetted area changes .",
    "indeed on jet footprints of heat flux are also seen during the mitigated elm crash and were proposed as the mechanism of the wetted area increase  @xcite .",
    "it also can provide a valuable insight in the physics of elms and their mitigation .",
    "the effect suggests that the phase of the elms becomes locked to the phase of the applied rmp .",
    "the rmp has usually a low toroidal mode number though ( @xmath2 , up to @xmath3 and @xmath4 on mast ) while the elm may have a higher toroidal mode number . on mast",
    "the toroidal mode number of the elm filaments was found to be between 10 and 20 and , remarkably , was not affected by the mitigation by @xmath3 or @xmath5 rmp  @xcite . although a high-@xmath1 elm can nonlinearly couple to a low @xmath1 perturbation  @xcite , it is not a priori clear how this can lead to the elm producing a structure on the divertor which corresponds to a perturbation with a much lower @xmath1 .",
    "the goal of this paper is to present a simple mechanism which may in some cases explain the observed peaking of elm loads .",
    "it is assumed that at least a part of the elm energy loss is caused by parallel transport along open , chaotic field lines in the homoclinic tangle formed by the magnetic component of the elm  @xcite .",
    "the simplest explanation would be thus based on the analysis of the structure of the homoclinic tangle , without considering mhd interactions of the elms with the applied rmp .",
    "we will show that the structure of the homoclinic tangle itself can indeed provide such an explanation .",
    "it is then needed to demonstrate that the explanation remains valid when the mhd interaction of the elm with the rmp is taken into account . for this we will use the results of simulations of rmp - mitigated elms with the nonlinear mhd code jorek .",
    "finally we will discuss the relation of the mitigated elm features predicted by our model to the observations on mast .",
    "the homoclinic tangle is formed by two intersecting surfaces  the stable and unstable invariant manifolds of the x - point  @xcite .",
    "the manifolds themselves are formed by field lines which approach the x - point asymptotically when followed in the direction parallel or antiparallel to the field vector . in the axisymmetric case",
    "they coincide and form the separatrix . under the influence of the magnetic perturbation they split and",
    "their distance is in the first order approximation given by the melnikov integral  @xcite .",
    "the usefulness of the concept of invariant manifolds lies in the fact that they form the boundary of the region of stochastic field lines which connect the divertor plates with the plasma core .",
    "the intersection of the stochastic region with the divertor plates manifests itself as a footprint receiving high parallel heat fluxes and having long connection length .",
    "the shape of the footprints can be calculated by tracing the connection length of field lines starting at the divertor plates and representing the result in a so - called laminar plot  @xcite .",
    "alternatively the melnikov integral can be used to approximate the shape of the manifolds .",
    "the melnikov integral is a function of the field line label at or near the separatrix , which we call the homoclinic coordinate @xmath6  @xcite and define it to be equal to the toroidal angle at the outboard midplane and constant on field lines .",
    "as noted in  @xcite , a radially displaced bundle of field lines at the outboard midplane will show up as a spiralling structure on the divertor , along a line of constant @xmath6 .",
    "the displacement of the field line is caused by the magnetic perturbation and the boundary of the bundle is the invariant manifold .",
    "the melnikov integral @xmath7 quantifies the displacement in flux coordinate of the invariant manifold with respect to the original separatrix at the divertor plates .",
    "the shape of the footprint boundary in the @xmath8 space is therefore given by the equation @xmath9 .",
    "@xmath10 means that the manifold is inside the separatrix and therefore does not intersect the divertor . to know the footprint shape on the divertor we perform the transform from the @xmath11 space to the divertor coordinates",
    "@xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the radial distance along the divertor surface and @xmath14 the toroidal angle .",
    "the manifold will then take an elongated shape along a spiralling curve of constant @xmath6 .",
    "more details can be found in  @xcite .",
    "the melnikov integral can be calculated by integrating the radial component of the perturbation along field lines on the unperturbed separatrix . for our application",
    "it is crucial that the melnikov integral for a perturbation with a single dominant toroidal mode @xmath1 will also have a simple harmonic form : @xmath15 which can be characterized only by the amplitude @xmath16 , phase @xmath17 and a toroidal mode number @xmath1 .",
    "there is thus very little freedom in the form of divertor footprints in a given equilibrium magnetic field .",
    "the melnikov integral is linear : for a linear combination of perturbation fields , the resulting melnikov integral is the corresponding linear combination of their melnikov integrals .      we will use the melnikov integral formalism to calculate the footprints in the case of the elm , in the case of the applied rmp and in the case where the elm is present together with the rmp field , representing an mitigated elm .",
    "we will represent here the elm as a magnetic perturbation with a higher toroidal mode number than the rmp .",
    "for concreteness we will use @xmath18 for the elm and @xmath0 for the rmp . in the @xmath8 space",
    "the melnikov integrals are simple sinusoids : @xmath19 , @xmath20 .",
    "the footprints of the elm on the divertor ( with coordinates @xmath13  the radial distance along the plate and @xmath14  the toroidal angle ) form a similar pattern as the footprints of the rmp , only with a finer structure of spirals .",
    "figure  [ fig : footprintn8 ] shows the invariant manifold ( red ) with the curve of constant @xmath6 ( black , compare with fiures in  @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , field line tracing in a simple model of the elm magnetic perturbation indicates  @xcite and observations on asdex  upgrade confirm  @xcite that the elm create a spiral - shaped heat load footprint which lies on a curve of a constant toroidal angle when mapped to the midplane ( called @xmath6 here ) , in agreement with our picture",
    ".    for the combined rmp and elm field we start with the simplest assumption that the rmp does not have an influence on the elm and the total field is merely a linear superposition of the rmp and a natural elm : @xmath21 ( figure  [ fig : footprintn2n8 ] , left ) .",
    "the elm will then act as a carrier wave modulated by the rmp and its fine footprints will be concentrated in the areas of the footprints of the rmp ( figure  [ fig : footprintn2n8 ] , right ) .",
    "if we average over multiple elms or over time while one elm is rotating ( this can be represented by varying the phase @xmath22 ) , the average footprint pattern of heat deposition will be similar to the one formed by the rmp alone , in agreement with experimental observations .",
    "this effect relies on the elm perturbation amplitude to be comparable or smaller than the rmp amplitude : @xmath23 , otherwise the rmp structure would be obscured by the larger elm structure .    in practice",
    "we may expect the rmp to interact with the elm , in particular to decrease its amplitude ( mitigation ) .",
    "this does not significantly affect our reasoning and may help to satisfy the relation @xmath24 even in cases where it is not satisfied for unmitigated elms .",
    "in the previous sections we developed an understanding of the form of mitigated elm divertor footprints based on a very simple representation of the perturbed magnetic field .",
    "we shall now verify the model in a more realistic magnetic field and a full 3-d geometry .",
    "such calculations were already performed in  @xcite where the elm field was modelled using a source formed of a set of equidistant current filaments . here",
    "we will use an even more realistic model : mhd simulations of the elm crash with the code jorek  @xcite , including rmps .",
    "the simulations were run for a jet - like equilibrium .",
    "the jorek simulations use a fourier representation in the toroidal direction , harmonics @xmath25 were used in the present simulations .",
    "the applied rmp is here produced by the error field correction coils ( efccs ) of jet , but only the dominant @xmath0 toroidal harmonic of their field is present ( as the boundary condition for the @xmath0 toroidal harmonic of the simulated field ) , the higher @xmath1 sidebands that occur in realistic coil designs are omitted for simplicity .",
    "more details on the simulations can be found in  @xcite .",
    "the evolutions of magnetic energies of the toroidal modes are shown in figure  [ fig : modes ] , together with the time instants where the following figures are taken .    figure  [ fig : n8elmonly ] shows laminar plots on the divertor calculated for three time instants during the elm crash in a jorek simulation .",
    "the dominant toroidal mode number is @xmath18 here , corresponding to the 8 visible footprint lobes .",
    "we may see that the whole pattern is rotating .",
    "the next simulations were run with a @xmath0 rmp similar to the one produced by jet efccs .",
    "figure  [ fig : elmplusrmp ] shows the resulting laminar plot without elms ( produced by running the simulation with @xmath26 and @xmath0 harmonics only ) and with an elm crash ( using the harmonics @xmath27 with a step of 2 ) .",
    "the primary strike point is distorted into an undulating pattern due to the perturbation being non - negligible in the x - point area .",
    "the footprint pattern with an elm shows a similar @xmath0 structure as without an elm on a large scale , but its boundary has a more complex shape with multiple spirals on a smaller scale .",
    "the fine scale structures evolve over time while the large scale @xmath0 footprints remain mostly the same .",
    "it should be noted that while without the rmp the dominant toroidal mode number of the elms is @xmath18 , with the rmp the energy `` cascades '' to lower modes @xmath28 due to their nonlinear coupling  @xcite as detailed in  @xcite .",
    "we are also interested in cases where the toroidal mode number is unchanged by the rmp , corresponding to the experimental observations on mast .",
    "such a case is provided by a jorek simulation with an increased diamagnetic rotation , where the @xmath5 mode is the most unstable and is not mitigated by rmp corresponding to a current of 40  kat in the efccs  @xcite .",
    "the results for three time instants are shown in figure  [ fig : elmplusrmpn6 ] .",
    "the laminar plot has a @xmath0 pattern , split into a structure of finer footprints which evolve over time while conserving the basic @xmath0 pattern .",
    "we may observe that without the magnetic perturbation the footprints rotate in the direction of the increasing toroidal angle @xmath14 .",
    "this is the clockwise direction when viewed from top and is also the direction of the electron diamagnetic and @xmath29 drifts , in which the ballooning instability rotates  @xcite . with the magnetic perturbation ,",
    "the fine details of the boundary fluctuate , which may be due to the rotation of the higher @xmath1 modes due to the elms .",
    "the superposition with the dominant @xmath0 pattern from the rmp does not allow to distinguish the rotation clearly , though .",
    "for this reason we performed the field line tracing again in a field constructed by subtracting the @xmath0 mode from the total field , while the higher modes are being kept .",
    "the @xmath0 mode is still present in the mhd simulation and thus modifies the other modes via nonlinear coupling , it is removed only in the field line tracing step .",
    "the footprints calculated in this way are somewhat artificial  they do not correspond to power loads on the divertor in any way  but allow us to determine the rotation of the higher modes ( corresponding to elms ) .",
    "the laminar plots corresponding to figure  [ fig : elmplusrmp ] ( with one plot added at an intermediate time instant ) are shown in figure  [ fig : elmplusrmpskiprmp ] .",
    "the footprint pattern still rotates in the direction of increasing @xmath14 , albeit more slowly than in the unmitigated phase .",
    "due to the presence of multiple modes , the pattern does not only rotate , but also progressively changes its shape as the relative amplitudes of the modes vary .",
    "we may also note that the periodic distortion of the primary strike point due to the rmp has vanished .",
    "for comparison , figure  [ fig : elmplusrmpskiprmp ] shows the poloidal profiles of density at the same time instants ( in this case with all the harmonics including @xmath0 ) .",
    "the pattern rotates in the electron diamagnetic direction ( counterclockwise ) .    for the case when the rmp does not mitigate the elms ( figure  [ fig : elmplusrmpn6 ] ) the corresponding laminar plot without the @xmath0 mode",
    "is shown in figure  [ fig : elmplusrmpn6skiprmp ] .",
    "again , the footprint pattern of the elm rotates and changes its shape .",
    "we have shown that a simple linear superposition of the field of an elm and an applied rmp field leads to concentration of open field lines in the footprints of the rmp field .",
    "( remarkably , our model does not rely on any nonlinear interaction between the elm and the rmp , although such an interaction is known to occur in the mhd simulations  @xcite . ) assuming that at least a part of the elm loss is caused by parallel transport along field lines , this would lead to an apparent `` locking '' of the divertor heat flux pattern to the rmp even though the elm has a different toroidal mode number and its rotation may not actually lock .",
    "this was indeed observed on mast , where though the elm heat flux follows the rmp footprints only when averaged over the start of the elm pulse .",
    "this result can be reconciled with our model by using the fact that a part of the elm energy is carried away by filaments and only the rest may be caused by the transport in the homoclinic tangle assumed here .",
    "furthermore , the filaments arrive at the target with a delay  @xcite . if the structure of the filament losses is unaffected by the rmp , they will in a later stage of the elm crash blur the pattern caused by the stochastic transport in the beginning , explaining the observed effect .",
    "we shall note that only the structure of the stochastic losses was studied here and further research is needed to determine if the rmp has any impact on the filament losses or not .",
    "we also studied only the connection length in the jorek simulations , as a too high perpendicular diffusion needed for numerical stability reasons prevented us from extracting meaningful target power profiles .",
    "solving this problem will allow us to tackle also the filament question .",
    "while our theory predicts that the footprints will have generally the shape of the rmp footprints , the elm field causes an additional distortion of their edge , depending on the relative amplitude of the elm compared to the rmp .",
    "if the footprints due to the elm field are longer than those due to the rmp , the rmp structure may even stop being distinguishable .",
    "this may explain the nstx results where the rmp structure was seen only in smaller elms  @xcite , assuming that larger elms have longer footprints .",
    "the distortion of the footprints was seen especially in the @xmath5 jorek runs , where the elms are not mitigated .",
    "this fine distortion is moving across the static rmp pattern in the jorek simulations .",
    "the modification of the static rmp pattern was proposed in  @xcite as the explanation of mast results where the elm load follows the footprints only in some elms .",
    "if the phase of the elm is such that its melnikov integral has a constructive interference with the one of the rmp at the footprint tip , the footprint will become longer and thus better observable . on the other hand ,",
    "a destructive interference at the tip will reduce it . in  @xcite it was noted that this explanation requires that the elm phase locks ( i. e. , does not rotate ) .",
    "this is a different regime than observed in the jorek results where the phase always rotates .",
    "the rotation was observed to slow down though in our simulations , so if the change of phase is negligible during the infra - red camera exposure time ( 35  @xmath30 on mast ) , the result may be indistinguishable from complete locking of the phase . in this way",
    "the experimental observations may be reconciled with the simulations .",
    "our model relies only on the general assumption that an elm has a magnetic component which can form a homoclinic tangle , and does not depend on a particular origin of this field .",
    "we have seen that jorek simulations predict the existence of such a field during the elm crash .",
    "another suggestion was that such a field is generated by thermoelectric currents flowing through the homoclinic tangle  @xcite .",
    "we may say that this theory is not needed for a qualitative explanation of the experimental results , as jorek simulations do not include the thermoelectric currents and still show the effect .",
    "it may be the case though that a quantitative analysis will show the need for the thermoelectric currents in order to explain the data .",
    "such a claim was made in  @xcite , where it was found that the vacuum rmp footprints do not match those observed during the mitigated elms on jet .",
    "the model used in  @xcite did not apparently include the field of the elm itself , so the possibility that the vacuum rmp field superposed with the elm field will be sufficient to match the data can not be completely ruled out yet .",
    "further work shall concentrate on determining the changes of the elm wetted area due to the effect described here .",
    "an increase of the wetted area due to rmps was reported  @xcite on jet with the iter - like wall ( contrary to the carbon wall results ) and attributed to the observed footprint pattern , while on mast the wetted area was found to decrease  @xcite .",
    "the latter effect is probably not due to the footprint pattern , as it follows the same scaling as the unmitigated elms .",
    "other possible mechanisms behind the footprint pattern in mitigated elms should be investigated .",
    "for instance , if an elm has a toroidal mode number equal to the one of the rmp , it may directly lock to it , as suggested in  @xcite , and produce a large pattern due to constructive interference .",
    "the influence of rmps on the filament pattern shall be modeled , as filaments are responsible at least for a part of the elm loss .",
