    "there is growing evidence of strong links between the triggering of powerful radio sources and gravitational interactions between galaxies .",
    "many radio galaxies show signatures of tidal interactions , such as tails , bridges , shells , and double nuclei ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these tidal encounters can lead to large increases in the amount of material being fed to the central black hole , thereby triggering the strong radio emission .",
    "the same tidal event that dumps gas in the vicinity of the nuclear black hole can produce a burst of star formation , and hence a population of young stars .",
    "further , the mechanical energy associated with relativistic radio jets can have a profound effect on the formation and evolution of galaxies , by heating the interstellar gas to the point where stars can no longer form .",
    "this _ radio - mode feedback _ has been suggested as the mechanism which suppresses star formation in massive galaxies ; without such a feedback mechanism , galaxy evolution models do not match the observed properties of galaxies @xcite .",
    "so both starbursts and the growth of the nuclear black hole are intimately associated with the merger history of the galaxy .",
    "however , key questions remain unanswered .",
    "if mergers are responsible for the formation of both agn and starbursts , why do we sometimes see one without the other ?",
    "when we do see both , we usually see a young radio source together with an older starburst , suggesting that there is a delay between the starburst and the onset of agn activity .",
    "what is the reason for this delay ?    the compact steep - spectrum ( css )",
    "sources are ideal laboratories for testing these connections .",
    "css sources are powerful but compact radio sources , with sizes 120  kpc , so that the radio source lies well within its host galaxy .",
    "their radio spectra are steep , @xmath5  ( @xmath6 ) , peaking below 500  mhz .",
    "they have the same distribution in redshift as the rest of the powerful radio source population ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review ) .",
    "the weight of evidence now is that css sources are small because they are young ; if fuelling is sustained they are expected to evolve into classical large double - lobed radio sources @xcite .",
    "all css sources accessible to detailed optical investigations show evidence for recent interactions and/or mergers , and evidence for young stellar populations and galaxy - wide starbursts have been found in many of these objects ( see * ? ? ? * for a review ) .",
    "mrc  b1221@xmath0423 is a member of a sample of southern radio sources similar in power to 3c sources @xcite , with a radio power of @xmath7 .",
    "the optical emission of the host galaxy is distorted , showing clear signatures of interaction , including tidal tails and shells @xcite .",
    "multicolour images show knotty blue star - forming regions , while the likely merging galaxy to the south is also significantly bluer than the host galaxy ( johnston et al .",
    "2005 ; see also figure  [ fig : slitpos ] ) . with a redshift of @xmath1  @xcite ,",
    "mrc  b1221@xmath0423 is one of the nearest css sources ; in the 3c sample , we need to go to @xmath8  to find the first compact source as powerful as mrc  b1221@xmath0423 .",
    "the radio source has double lobes which lie well within the envelope of the host galaxy @xcite .",
    "the age of the radio source , estimated from the power of the radio jets and total stored energy in the synchrotron plasma of the lobes @xcite , is only @xmath2  yr . as a young , nearby , bright css source , mrc  b1221@xmath0423 is therefore an ideal candidate for testing the relationship between the agn and its environment .",
    "the goal of this study is to understand the relationship between the central agn , which is the observational signpost of a growing black hole , and the environment of the galaxy .",
    "mrc  b1221@xmath0423 provides a unique opportunity to measure both the age of the radio source and the star formation history of the galaxy , both of which are connected to the merger history of the galaxy .    in a previous paper ( @xcite , henceforth paper i ) we presented an analysis of multi - colour _ bvrik _ images of mrc  b1221@xmath0423 , which we used to analyse the change in stellar populations across the galaxy and its companion .",
    "we found evidence for three distinct stellar populations , with ages of about 15  gyr , 300  myr and less than 10  myr .",
    "we concluded that the interaction with the companion galaxy triggered star formation in both galaxies , and after a substantial time delay , the infalling gas triggered activity in the central supermassive black hole .    in order to better understand the connection between the radio source and its environment , we have undertaken further radio and optical observations of mrc  b1221@xmath0423 , which we present in this paper . in sections  [ sec : radio - imaging ] and  [ sec : radio - spectroscopy ] we describe the radio images and  absorption spectra of mrc  b1221@xmath0423 , and in section  [ sec : optical - observations ] we describe the optical spectra .",
    "we have assumed a flat @xmath9-cdm cosmology with @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12throughout . at the distance of the galaxy , 1",
    "arcsec corresponds to a distance of 2.876  kpc .",
    "we observed mrc  b1221@xmath0423 at 1344 , 2282 and 18880.5 @xmath13 19648.5  mhz ( 20  cm , 13  cm and 12  mm wavebands ) with the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) , and also extracted unpublished , archival data at 1384 and 2496 mhz from the atca online archive .",
    "table  [ tab : radio_obslog ] shows the details of these observations .",
    "the data were reduced using standard procedures in miriad @xcite .",
    "the effective bandwidth is either 104 mhz ( 13 channels , each of width 8 mhz ) or 56 mhz ( 14 channels , each of width 4 mhz ) .",
    "however , at both 1384 and 2282 mhz , not all of the band is usable because the atca suffers from self - generated interference at integer multiples of 128 mhz .",
    "hence , there is a slight shift of the effective frequency in both cases ( see table  [ tab : radio_obslog ] ) .",
    "pks b1934@xmath0638 was the primary calibrator at 20 and 13  cm , except for the observations from 2003 november where it was not observed . in this case ,",
    "pks b0823@xmath0500 as well as the 2280 mhz data from 2003 august were used to determine the flux density scale ; we estimate that the uncertainty in this procedure is a few per cent at most . at 18.9 and 19.6",
    "ghz , flux calibration was carried out using observations of jupiter ; we used the shortest baseline only , where jupiter is not significantly resolved out .",
    "the deconvolution and imaging procedure at each frequency consisted of a number of iterations of clean plus self - calibration . only after several rounds of phase - only self - calibration was a full amplitude and phase solution attempted . to ensure that the source model derived from the clean components was as simple as possible ( especially in the 12-mm waveband ) ,",
    "natural weighting was used while self - calibrating . when it was clear that there was no further improvement in the image quality , both naturally- and uniformly - weighted images were created from the final self - calibrated visibilities .",
    "table  [ tab : radio_obslog ] contains a summary of the angular resolution and rms noise level in the vicinity of mrc  b1221@xmath0423 in each total intensity image .",
    "the 18.9 and 19.6 ghz images were restored using the same beam size ( that of the 18.9 ghz data ) to allow these images to be averaged together for further analysis ( average frequency 19264.5 mhz ) .",
    "we estimate that the astrometry in the millimetre - wavelength images is accurate to @xmath140.1 arcsec",
