    "the erratic motion of tiny particles suspended in a fluid of lighter particles is a known phenomenon , going under the name of brownian motion , of fundamental interest in statistical mechanics  @xcite .",
    "a classical method to study this physical process is the langevin equation , where the influence of the solvent particles on the heavier particles is modeled by two force terms .",
    "one term represents a viscous force , with friction coefficient @xmath0 , the other a stochastic force , whose intensity depends on the temperature of the solvent .",
    "alternatively , the description of the dynamics of a system of brownian particles in an external field may rest upon the fokker - planck equation ( fpe ) for the probability density of the particles .",
    "the two levels of description , namely , a ) the _ klein - kramers _ equation  @xcite , which considers the evolution of the probability density of position and velocity , and b ) the _ smoluchowski _ equation  @xcite , for the probability distribution of position only , have deserved a great deal of attention . the passage from the first description to the second one is well understood for the case of ideal non - interacting particles immersed in a heat bath at constant temperature .",
    "in fact , as shown by wilemski and titulaer  @xcite , the derivation of the smoluchowski equation from the kramers - klein equation , can be performed by means of a perturbation expansion in terms of the inverse of the friction coefficient , @xmath0 . on the other side",
    ", one can derive the smoluchowski equation more directly after taking the overdamped limit @xmath1 in the langevin equation and neglecting the inertial acceleration term . physically speaking",
    ", this procedure corresponds to the fact that the velocities of the particles thermalize rapidly , so that only the probability distribution of positions of the particles matters .",
    "thermal gradients , besides causing a heat flow , can induce a mass flow in systems such as colloids .",
    "the phenomenon is termed thermodiffusion , thermophoresis or ludwig - soret effect  @xcite and is relevant because it represents a tool to manipulate and concentrate molecules in solution .",
    "thermophoresis , in fact , typically enhances the concentration in colder regions .",
    "recently , it has been employed to form two dimensional colloidal crystals using @xmath2 polystyrene beads .",
    "such a method leads to applications in microfiltration , particle accumulation and molecular detection on surfaces  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , in spite of its technological interest , not many studies provide a derivation of the governing equation for the concentration field in the presence of a temperature gradient externally imposed .",
    "a problem arises when one considers the @xmath1 limit : the resulting stochastic equation contains a multiplicative noise term ( the temperature is space - dependent ) .",
    "this in turn means that the associated fpe depends on the particular prescription used to derive it , i.e. one encounters the so called ito - stratonovich dilemma . to solve it ,",
    "matsuo and sasa  @xcite recently obtained the smoluchowski equation from a perturbation expansion in powers of the inverse of @xmath0 .",
    "two important messages arise from their work : first , the underdamped dynamics is free from the ito - stratonovich dilemma , and , second , their perturbation scheme is unbounded in time and one needs a renormalization treatment to make it convergent .",
    "the main objective of this work is to present a systematic and convergent derivation of the smoluchowski equation for a system of interacting brownian particles in a temperature gradient .",
    "the interaction is of mean - field type , so that our starting point , the kramers equation , can be written down in close form for the one - particle distribution function .",
    "we employ a multiple time - scale method which has been designed to deal with non - uniformities in systems with more than a time scale .",
    "the approach is quite appropriate for our objectives , since in the large friction limit there is a very clear time - scale separation in the system : in a very short period the velocities of the particles relax to their thermal equilibrium value , whereas on a much longer time scale also the positions of the particles assume configurations compatible with their steady state distribution . in this regard , the multiple time - scale method has been used to perform the passage from the kramers to the smoluchowski equation for an ideal gas at constant temperature as an expansion in powers of the small parameter @xmath3 , providing a uniformly valid result  @xcite .",
    "more recently , the case of interacting hard - core particles in isothermal systems has also been studied within this framework  @xcite .",
    "another important part of this work is the discussion about the ito versus stratonovich description of the system .",
    "this is based on numerical results of the langevin dynamics .",
    "the plan of this paper is the following : in section [ section : fp ] we present the full langevin equation , its overdamped limit , and the corresponding kramers and smoluchowski descriptions of the system . in section [ section : ms ]",
    "the derivation of the smoluchowski equation with the multiple time - scale method is presented . in section [ section : numerics ]",
    "we present the numerical results , with some discussion on the different ito - stratonovich prescriptions , and in section [ section : conclusions ] we give our conclusions .",
    "let us consider a system of @xmath4 interacting brownian particles of mass @xmath5 in an external force field .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , let us assume only one spatial dimension .",
    "the system is also under the influence of an external non - uniform temperature field so that the dynamics of the particles is given by :    @xmath6    for @xmath7 , and where @xmath0 is the friction coefficient , @xmath8 is a non - uniform _ heat - bath temperature _ , @xmath9 is an external force , @xmath10 is the interaction force between pair of particles , and @xmath11 is a gaussian white noise with zero average and correlation @xmath12 @xmath13 indicates the average over a statistical ensemble of realizations , and @xmath14 is the boltzmann constant . to study the dynamics of the system we consider the single particle probability distribution function , @xmath15 , of the position and velocity variables .",
    "its evolution is given by the fokker - planck equation  @xcite also known as kramers equation :    @xmath16 p(x , v , t ) = \\gamma \\partial_v\\bigr [ v p(x , v , t )    + \\frac{k_b t(x)}{m } \\partial_v p(x , v , t)\\bigr ] .",

    "it is very important to realize under what conditions on the interparticle interactions one can write down eq .",
    "( [ kramers ] ) ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "note that with no approximations the kramers - fpe for interacting particles for the one - particle distribution function , @xmath22 , depends on the two - particle distribution @xmath23 .",
    "the main hypothesis done in eq .",
    "( [ kramers ] ) is that whenever @xmath24 is a smooth function of particle separation one may assume a mean - field approximation for the two - particle distribution function @xmath25",
    ". in the following we shall define @xmath26 .    since the temperature @xmath27 in eq .",
    "( [ kramers ] ) multiplies a derivative with respect to @xmath28 , one realizes that the kramers equation is free from the so called ito - stratonovich dilemma . on the contrary , when one considers the overdamped limit , @xmath1 , in eq .",
    "( [ langevin ] ) one obtains the following langevin equation : @xmath29 which leads to different equations for the distribution of the spatial position ( the so - called smoluchowski equation ) depending on the prescription adopted to integrate the stochastic evolution .",
    "in fact , the corresponding fpe for ito and stratonovich conventions , the two rules usually applied , are respectively : @xmath30    the aim of this work is to derive a smoluchowski equation for the system using the multiple time - scale method , via an expansion in the inverse of the friction coefficient . our starting point is the kramers equation , eq .",
    "( [ kramers ] ) . at this stage",
    "it is convenient to introduce the following dimensionless variables : @xmath31    @xmath32    being @xmath33 the thermal velocity at the reference temperature @xmath34 ( which can be taken equal to @xmath35 ) , and @xmath36 is a typical length scale of the system , for example the effective radius of the particles .",
    "the non - dimensional kramers equation for @xmath37 denoting , @xmath38 , is : @xmath39    in the following we shall skip the tildes in our notation .",
    "the ( non - dimensional ) kramers equation , eq .  ( [ nondimkramers ] ) , is our definitive starting point and in the next section we proceed to present the set of eigenfunctions that will be used in the subsequent section when we make use of the multiple time - scale approach .",
