    "clusters of galaxies in the redshift range of @xmath5 often exhibit an overabundance , relative to present - day clusters , of blue galaxies ( butcher & oemler 1978 ) .",
    "this star formation activity is often called the butcher - oemler effect ( boe ) .",
    "several mechanisms responsible for the effect have been suggested .",
    "tidal compression by the cluster potential increases the velocity dispersion of clouds in a disk galaxy ( byrd & valtonen 1990 ; valluri 1993 ) .",
    "henriksen & byrd ( 1996 ) estimate the influence of tidal acceleration by the cluster potential on galaxies .",
    "they show that if the cluster potential is centrally peaked , compression of galaxy disk is significant .",
    "they find that the velocity perturbation due to the gravitational tidal forces are large enough for molecular clouds to give birth to stars .",
    "dressler & gunn ( 1983 ) suggest that a significant fraction of galaxies in a cluster undergo a rapid rise in external pressure as they plow into the hot intracluster medium . evrard ( 1991 )",
    "numerically confirms this possibility .",
    "he suggests that the high - pressure leads to star formation activity .",
    "recently , moore et al . ( 1996 ) numerically show that successive high speed encounters , `` galaxy harassment '' , cause a complete morphological transformation from disks to spheroidals .",
    "since galaxy harassment is an extremely effective mechanism for fueling central region of a galaxy , it may cause star formation activity .    however , the above studies do not derive the history of star formation rate ( sfr ) quantitatively . in this paper ,",
    "a simple method is devised to evaluate the sfr of a disk galaxy in a cluster in order to find out what mechanism drives the boe .",
    "this model is useful to predict color and spatial distributions of the blue population in boe clusters .",
    "the above three mechanisms , ( 1 ) tidal force from the potential well of the cluster , ( 2 ) increase of external pressure , and ( 3 ) high - speed encounters between galaxies are studied as candidates of the boe .",
    "these mechanisms provide pressure variations of local interstellar medium ( ism ) in a disk galaxy because of increase of kinetic or thermal pressure of ism , and gas inflow towards the galaxy center . as will be shown in detail ,",
    "the time scales of the variations are @xmath1 , which reflect the dynamical time scales of a galaxy and central region of a cluster .",
    "star formation responds this pressure variation locally .",
    "elmegreen & efremov ( 1997 ) obtain a simple relation between star formation efficiency of molecular clouds of varying mass and pressure .",
    "their results indicate that if the pressure of a cloud increases the order of a magnitude , the star formation efficiency increases and the lifetime decreases significantly .",
    "the relation does not care about the origin of the pressure .",
    "thus , it can be applied to the above three cases ( 1 ) - ( 3 ) .",
    "since the lifetime of clouds is @xmath6 yr ( elmegreen & efremov 1997 ) , the pressure variations in the cases ( 1 ) - ( 3 ) are expected to affect the evolution of all the molecular clouds and the sfr of a disk galaxy .",
    "this will be discussed in the following sections .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in ",
    "ii , a model of molecular cloud evolution is described . in  iii",
    ", the pressure evolution of a disk galaxy in a cluster is derived , and the sfr is evaluated . finally , ",
    "iv is devoted to conclusions . in that section ,",
    "observational implications are commented .",
    "molecular clouds are divided according to their _ initial _ masses , that is , @xmath7 , where the lower and upper cutoffs are @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively , and their intervals are chosen that @xmath10 . referring to the total mass of clouds",
    "whose initial masses are between @xmath11 and @xmath12 as @xmath13 , the rate of change is @xmath14 - \\frac{\\delta       \\tilde{m}_i(t)}{\\tau(m_i , p)}\\;\\,\\ ] ] where @xmath15 is the initial mass fraction of the molecular clouds whose initial masses are between @xmath11 and @xmath12 , @xmath16 is the gas ejection rate from stars , @xmath17 is the recycle rate of molecular gas , @xmath18 is the destruction time of a molecular cloud with mass @xmath11 and pressure @xmath19 , respectively .    since the mass spectra of open clusters , globular clusters , and molecular clouds follow @xmath20 , where @xmath21 ( harris & pudritz 1994 ; elmegreen & efremov 1997 ) , the initial mass function of molecular clouds is assumed to be @xmath22 . thus @xmath15 can be derived from this relation .",
    "the gas ejection rate from stars is divided into two terms , @xmath23 .",
    "the gas ejection rate from stars with small lifetime is given by @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the stellar mass , @xmath26 is the sfr , @xmath27 is the imf expressed in the form of the mass fraction , @xmath28 is the return mass fraction , and @xmath29 is the lifetime of stars with mass @xmath25 .",
    "the slope of the imf is taken to be 1.35 ( salpeter mass function ) .",
    "the upper and lower mass limits , @xmath30 and @xmath31 , are taken to be @xmath32 and @xmath33 , respectively , although the lower limit of the imf is @xmath34 .",
    "the lifetime of stars and the return mass fraction are adopted from those in mihara & takahara ( 1994 ) and maeder ( 1992 ) , respectively .",
    "note that the lifetime of a star with @xmath33 is @xmath35 yr , which is identical with the end time of calculations in the later sections .",
    "the gas ejection rate from stars with large lifetime , @xmath36 , will be specified later .",
    "the recycle rate of molecular gas is @xmath37\\frac{\\delta       \\tilde{m}_i(t)}{\\tau(m_i , p)}\\;\\,\\ ] ] where @xmath38 is the star formation efficiency of a molecular cloud with mass @xmath11 and pressure @xmath19 . under simple assumptions ,",
    "elmegreen & efremov ( 1997 ) derive @xmath38 and @xmath18 : their results are adopted in the following .",
    "note that the pressure @xmath19 includes the kinetic pressure ( elmegreen 1989 ; elmegreen & efremov 1997 ) . in our galaxy ,",
    "the kinetic pressure is larger than thermal pressure ( elmegreen 1989 ; elmegreen & efremov 1997 ) .",
    "the sfr is described by @xmath39    equation ( [ eq : rate ] ) can be solved if @xmath19 is given . in the next section",
    ", @xmath19 is determined for several cases .",
    "then the sfrs are calculated form equations ( [ eq : rate ] ) @xmath40 ( [ eq : sf ] ) .",
    "in this subsection , the evolution of pressure is treated as a parameter to find the relation between the evolution of pressure and the sfr of a disk galaxy .",
    "three cases are considered , that is , the final value of @xmath19 is @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 ( figure 1(a ) ) .",
    "the pressure is given in units of @xmath44 which is the total pressure in the solar neighborhood ( elmegreen & efremov 1997 ) . the pressure @xmath19 increases for @xmath45 .",
    "for @xmath46 , the model galaxy is assumed to be at @xmath47    the calculation starts at @xmath48 yr . at that time , the total mass of molecular clouds in the model galaxy , @xmath49 , is @xmath50 , and the mass spectrum of molecular clouds is @xmath51 . for @xmath46 , ignoring equation ( [ eq : sou ] ) , the source term @xmath52 in equation ( [ eq : rate ] ) is artificially fixed at @xmath53 which is the sfr of our galaxy ( gsten & mezger 1983 ) . after the calculation starts , the mass spectrum is modified because the destruction time of molecular clouds depends on their mass ( elmegreen & efremov 1997 ) .",
    "until @xmath54 , the destruction and formation rates of molecular clouds become identical to within 3% . at @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and",
    "the mass spectrum of molecular clouds is @xmath56 .",
    "the total mass of molecular clouds is similar to that of our galaxy ( @xmath57 , larson 1987 ) . note that for @xmath45 the sfr history normalized by @xmath58 is independent of the value of @xmath58 .",
    "the gas ejection rate from stars with large lifetime is given by @xmath59 for @xmath45 and for fixed @xmath60 .",
    "the evolution of pressure , sfr , and the total mass of molecular clouds are indicated in figure 1 . as is shown",
    ", the sfrs and the time at which it become maximum depends on @xmath61 . taking the case where @xmath62 as an example",
    ", the sfr can be explained as follows .",
    "the pressure @xmath19 reaches @xmath63 at @xmath64 yr . when @xmath65 , the mass of a molecular cloud whose destruction time is less than @xmath2 yr is @xmath66 ( see figure 4 in elmegreen & efremov 1997 ) . on the other hand , when @xmath54 , the total mass of molecular clouds whose individual mass is less than @xmath67 is @xmath68 .",
    "the ratio , @xmath69 , nearly corresponds to the peak of the sfr ( figure 1(b ) ) . in the case where @xmath70 , the sfr reaches a maximum before @xmath19 becomes @xmath71 ( @xmath72 yr )",
    "this is because all molecular clouds ( @xmath73 ) are affected by the pressure increase before @xmath72 yr , since the destruction time of a molecular cloud with @xmath74 is @xmath1 yr when @xmath75 .",
    "in fact , @xmath49 is significantly reduced when @xmath72 ( figure 1(c ) ) .",
    "therefore , the peak of the sfr is determined by the balance between the time scale of pressure increase and the destruction time of clouds",
    ". moreover , figure 1(b ) shows that the evolution of sfr is not very sensitive to @xmath76 , if it is larger than @xmath77 and if the time scale of pressure increase is @xmath1 yr .",
    "this is because almost all of the clouds are destroyed regardless of @xmath76 .",
    "in summary , when pressure increases on a time scale of @xmath2 yr , the sfr rises significantly if @xmath78 but reaches the ceiling at @xmath79 .",
    "the above arguments should be true for all of the boe mechanisms treated in the following sections , because this model does not care about the origin of pressure .",
    "a radially infalling disk galaxy is affected by tidal force from the cluster potential well .",
    "molecular clouds in the galaxy are accelerated .",
    "thus the pressure @xmath19 from random cloud motions increases .",
    "three types of mass profiles in the central region of the cluster are investigated ; @xmath80                     -\\frac{r / r_{\\rm gl}}{(1+r^2/r_{\\rm gl}^2)^{1/2}}\\right]\\:,\\ ] ] @xmath81                     -\\frac{r / r_{\\rm king } }                     { ( 1+r^2/r_{\\rm king}^2)^{1/2}}\\right]\\:,\\ ] ] @xmath82\\:.\\ ] ] equations ( [ eq : gl ] ) is the profile inferred from gravitational lensing constraints , equations ( [ eq : king ] ) is the so - called king model profile , and equations ( [ eq : nfw ] ) is the profile obtained in numerical simulations done by navarro , frenk , & white ( 1995 , 1996 ) .",
    "the characteristic radii for each are @xmath83 kpc , @xmath84 kpc , and @xmath85 kpc , respectively .",
    "the first profile is the same as that in henriksen & byrd ( 1996 ) .",
    "the mass distributions are normalized so that the mass in side 500 kpc is @xmath86 for all distributions .",
    "when the mass profile of the cluster follows equation ( [ eq : nfw ] ) , the profile of the intracluster gas can be fitted well by ( [ eq : king ] ) except for the normalization of mass . in that case",
    ", the ratio of characteristic radii , @xmath87 , is 0.22 ( makino , sasaki , & suto 1998 ) , which is the reason for taking a radius of 900 kpc in equation ( [ eq : nfw ] ) .    in order to calculate the tidal acceleration and the velocity perturbation of molecular clouds ,",
    "the impulse approximation is used as in henriksen & byrd ( 1996 ) . strictly speaking",
    ", this approximation may not be good because the rotation period of a galaxy is comparable to the time - scale in which the galaxy crosses the central region of the cluster .",
    "however , as will be noted , the results are not very sensitive to the velocity perturbations for the models considered in this subsection .    the transverse and radial tidal accelerations are @xmath88^{3/2}}\\;,\\ ] ] @xmath89\\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath90 is the gravitational constant and @xmath91 is the radius of the galaxy ( @xmath92 kpc ) .",
    "the velocity perturbation can be estimated as @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the transverse or radial tidal acceleration .",
    "the kinetic pressure is given by @xmath95 , where the average density of the galaxy disk is @xmath96 .",
    "the evolution of @xmath94 is calculated from the orbits of the galaxy in the potential well of the cluster . as an idealized case",
    ", a radially infalling galaxy is investigated .",
    "the velocity of the galaxy , @xmath97 , can be obtained by solving the equation of motion . at @xmath54 ,",
    "the position of the galaxy is 350 kpc away from the center of the cluster . from there",
    "the galaxy radially infalls towards the center .",
    "the initial velocity is @xmath98 .",
    "figure 2 shows the orbits of the galaxy",
    ".    figures 3(a ) and 4(a ) show the evolution of the pressure , @xmath99 , for the three types of potentials ( equations [ eq : gl ] , [ eq : king ] , and [ eq : nfw ] ) .",
    "the rates of pressure increase due to the radial tidal acceleration are somewhat larger than those due to the transverse tidal acceleration .",
    "since the galaxy rotates , and radial and transverse tidal acceleration cancel , the pressure of a real galaxy is less than that shown in figure 4(a ) .",
    "note that when the galaxy disk is perpendicular to the orbit , figure 3(a ) indicates the real tidal acceleration because there is no radial tidal acceleration .    using the pressure evolution , equation ( [ eq : rate ] )",
    "is solved .",
    "the evolution of a model galaxy for @xmath46 is the same as that in  [ sec : gen ] .",
    "the evolution of the sfrs is shown in figure 3(b ) and 4(b ) .",
    "the sfrs become maximum before the galaxy reaches the center of the cluster . at that time",
    ", the galaxy is located at @xmath100 kpc ( figure 2 ) . since",
    "the time scales of the pressure increase are @xmath101 yr and @xmath19 becomes larger then @xmath102 for all models , the evolution of the sfrs is similar among them ( see  [ sec : gen ] ) .",
    "thus , it is common among the models that the maximum sfr is three to four times as much as the initial sfr .",
    "the evolution of @xmath49 is shown in figure 3(c ) and 4(c ) . during the passage through the central region of a cluster",
    ", @xmath49 decreases to @xmath103 of the initial value .",
    "numerical simulations of rich cluster evolution show that the local static pressure around a significant fraction of galaxies experienced a rapid increase at high redshift ( evrard 1991 ) . thus",
    ", the change of sfr due to this pressure increase is investigated .",
    "the evolution of the pressure is shown in figure 5(a ) ; for @xmath104 yr , @xmath105 , and for @xmath106 yr , @xmath107 .",
    "this corresponds to the most rapid increase of pressure in figure 1 of evrard ( 1991 ) .",
    "the evolution of a model galaxy for @xmath46 is the same as that in  [ sec : gen ] .",
    "figure 5 also shows the evolution of sfr and @xmath49 .",
    "the sfr increases by at most 70% .",
    "thus , the increase of static pressure may not induce observable changes in color .",
    "moore et al .",
    "( 1996 ) propose that multiple high speed encounters between galaxies ( galaxy harassment ) change the structure of galaxies in clusters .",
    "therefore , the effect of high - speed encounters on the sfr of a disk galaxy is considered .",
    "in the first place , a single encounter is considered .",
    "as an extreme case , a penetrating encounter is calculated .",

    "the characteristic radius @xmath110 is 5 kpc . for @xmath111 kpc , @xmath112 .",
    "the evolution of a model galaxy for @xmath46 is also the same as that in  [ sec : gen ] . at @xmath54 , a model disk galaxy",
    "is located at @xmath113 kpc , and the relative velocity to the perturber is @xmath114 .",
    "because of the symmetry between the approach and recession phases of the model galaxy , only the transverse tidal acceleration is calculated .",
    "the results are shown in figure 5 .",
    "the model galaxy passes the center of the perturber at @xmath115 yr .",
    "since the kinetic pressure does not change significantly , the sfr rises by only 13% .    in this argument , however , the ism of the perturber is not taken into account . if it has its own ism with density @xmath116 , the ram pressure @xmath117 acts on molecular clouds in the model galaxy .",
    "for example , when @xmath118 for @xmath119 kpc and @xmath120 for @xmath121 kpc , the sfr temporarily increases more than ten times larger than the initial value .",
    "the formation of a ring or tidal arms due to a close encounter will also affect the sfr . however , moore et al .",
    "( 1996 ) indicate that such close encounters ( @xmath122 kpc ) are extremely rare in a cluster .",
    "thus , a single high speed encounter does not drive the boe .    on the other hand",
    ", galaxy harassment would induce star formation activity in many galaxies in a cluster .",
    "using the results of moore , lake , and katz ( 1998 ) and lake , katz , & moore ( 1998 ) , the change of sfr due to the harassment is calculated .",
    "galaxy harassment has a great influence on galaxies smaller than the galaxy .",
    "thus , the initial conditions of a model galaxy are different from those considered above . at @xmath54 ,",
    "the sfr is @xmath123 and @xmath124 , which correspond to those of the model galaxy in moore et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and lake et al .",
    "the initial value of pressure is taken to be @xmath125 in order to balance the cloud destruction rate with the formation rate .",
    "lake et al .",
    "( 1998 ) show that most of the gas of the harassed galaxy is driven to the region within 1 kpc of the center within 3 gyr . in the extreme case ,",
    "half of the mass is transfered in an interval of 100 - 200 myr . assuming that 60% of the gas is driven to the region within 1 kpc of the center and that the hight of the gas disk is 200 kpc",
    ", the gas density is @xmath126 . since the effective velocity is @xmath127 ( fig . 2 in moore at al . [",
    "1998 ] ) , the pressure of the central region of the harassed galaxy is @xmath128 .",
    "thus , the evolution of the model galaxy is assumed to be @xmath129 ( figure 5a ) . using this and equation ( [ eq : rate ] )",
    ", the evolution of the model galaxy can be calculated .",
    "the results are shown in figure 5(b ) and 5(c ) .",
    "the history of sfr shows that galaxy harassment can induce strong star formation activity .",
    "in this paper , the influence of environmental effects on the star formation rate ( sfr ) of disk galaxies in clusters was quantitatively estimated .",
    "the constructed model treats the response of star formation to local pressure variance .",
    "since it does not care about the origin of pressure , it can be used to investigate various candidates for the butcher - oemler effect .",
    "general analysis indicates that the sfr increases significantly when the pressure of molecular clouds rises above @xmath130 in @xmath1 yr but reaches the ceiling at @xmath131 .",
    "this is because the destruction time of most molecular clouds in the galaxy becomes @xmath6 yr .    in the analysis of a disk galaxy tidally affected by the cluster",
    ", it is found that the maximum sfr is around three or four times as much as that of a field galaxy , and does not depend greatly on the mass profiles of the cluster and the type of the tidal force .",
    "the sfr becomes maximum before the galaxy reaches the center of the cluster . at that time",
    ", the distance from the center is @xmath100 .",
    "fritze -v alvensleben & gerhard ( 1994 ) have investigated the color evolution during and after starbursts for many types of galaxy .",
    "their results show that the color of a galaxy significantly becomes bluer for @xmath1 yr after the burst if the gas mass fraction just before the burst is @xmath132 % , the duration of the burst is @xmath1 yr , and most of the gas is consumed during the burst .",
    "therefore , if the tidally affected galaxies are responsible for the butcher - oemler effect ( boe ) , the blue galaxies should be found @xmath133 kpc from the center of the cluster ( figure 2 ) .",
    "it is confirmed that even if the initial velocity of the model galaxy is 2000 @xmath134 , which is larger than the virial velocity of the model cluster , this prediction does not significantly change .",
    "however , recent observations are inconsistent with this prediction . in a2317 ,",
    "the blue population decreases remarkably inside 300 kpc ( rakos , odell , & schombert 1997 ) . since this trend is observed in other distant clusters ( abraham et al .",
    "1996 ; balogh et al .",
    "1997 ) , it appears that tidal force from the potential well of a cluster does not induce the boe .",
    "as a galaxy plows into the hot intracluster medium , the external pressure rapidly rises .",
    "however , the rise of local pressure based on numerical calculation done by evrard ( 1991 ) does not appear to induce starbursts because the maximum of the pressure is small .",
    "this is consistent with the recent observation of a merging cluster ( tomita et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "the velocity perturbation induced by a single high - speed encounter is too small to affect the sfr of a disk galaxy .",
    "however , successive high - speed encounters between galaxies ( galaxy harassment ) lead to gas inflow and strong star formation activity .",
    "thus , galaxy harassment may be a likely explanation for the star - forming galaxies observed in high - redshift clusters ( oemler , dressler , & butcher 1997 ; couch et al .",
    "1998 ; smail et al .",
    "1998 ) . in order to know whether galaxy harassment is the _",
    "main _ origin of boe , it is required to estimate the fraction of galaxies in which the gas accumulates in the center .",
    "the spatial distribution of blue galaxies predicted by the galaxy harassment model may be consistent with the observations , because galaxies in the core of clusters will be older than galaxies at the edges .",
    "on the other hand , the boe may not be excess star formation induced by the infall process or internal tides in clusters of galaxies .",
    "abraham et al . ( 1996 ) suggest that the boe is due to the increased rate of infall of bluer field galaxies at higher redshift , and that the star formation is truncated without an increase .",
    "a model including ram - pressure stripping and evolution of intracluster medium will be needed to investigate this idea .",

    "<S> a simple model is constructed to evaluate the change of star formation rate of a disk galaxy due to environmental effects in clusters of galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> three effects , ( 1 ) tidal force from the potential well of the cluster , ( 2 ) increase of external pressure when the galaxy plows into the intracluster medium , ( 3 ) high - speed encounters between galaxies , are investigated . </S>",
    "<S> general analysis indicates that the star formation rate increases significantly when the pressure of molecular clouds rises above @xmath0 in @xmath1 yr . </S>",
    "<S> this is because the pressure rise makes the destruction time of the majority of molecular clouds in the galaxy less than @xmath2 yr . the tidal force from the potential well of the cluster accelerates molecular clouds in a disk galaxy infalling towards the cluster center . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the kinetic pressure rises above @xmath3 . before the galaxy reaches the cluster center , the star formation rate reaches a maximum . </S>",
    "<S> the peak is three to four times larger than the initial value . </S>",
    "<S> if this is the main mechanism of the butcher - oemler effect , blue galaxies are expected to be located within @xmath4 kpc from the center of the cluster . </S>",
    "<S> however this prediction is inconsistent with the recent observations . </S>",
    "<S> the increase of external pressure when the galaxy plows into the intracluster medium does not change star formation rate of a disk galaxy significantly . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the increase of external pressure may not be the main mechanism of the butcher - oemler effect . </S>",
    "<S> the velocity perturbation induced by a single high - speed encounter between galaxies is too small to affect star formation rate of a disk galaxy , while successive high - speed encounters ( galaxy harassment ) trigger star formation activity because of the accumulation of gas in the galaxy center . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the galaxy harassment remains as the candidate for a mechanism of the butcher - oemler effect . </S>"
