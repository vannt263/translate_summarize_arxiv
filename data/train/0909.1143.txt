    "( color online ) schematic bifurcation diagram for a suitably chosen control parameter .",

    "the interaction between taylor vortex flow ( tvf ) , spirals ( spi ) , and a variety of different wavy solutions was investigated in numerous publications @xcite .    under periodic boundary conditions ( pbc ) ,",
    "toroidally closed tvf appears via a primary stationary bifurcation out of the rotationally symmetric , axially homogeneous basic circular couette flow ( ccf ) .",
    "also the two axially symmetry degenerated , oscillatory spi states appear via primary bifurcations out of ccf in a symmetric hopf bifurcation together with the ribbon state .",
    "the latter is typically unstable close to onset and can be seen as a non - linear superposition of the two oppositely propagating spirals to an axially standing wave .",
    "the stability of tvf and spi at onset is regulated by the order of their appearance upon increasing the inner cylinder s rotation rate : the first ( second ) solution to bifurcate out of ccf is stable ( unstable ) .",
    "however , the second unstable solution becomes stable at larger inner cylinder rotation . which state bifurcates first depends on the outer cylinder rotation rate @xcite .",
    "besides parameter regions with mono - stability of tvf and spi , one also observes regions with bistability of both states @xcite .",
    "when moving a control parameter out of this region , one solution loses its stability and the flow undergoes a transition to the remaining stable state , i.e. , from tvf to spi or vice versa @xcite .",
    "bifurcation theoretical considerations and symmetry arguments @xcite as well as amplitude expansion techniques in @xcite and numerical simulations in @xcite show that the stability is transfered from tvf to spi via secondarily bifurcating wavy taylor vortices ( wtvf ) @xcite and vice versa from spi to tvf via secondarily bifurcating wavy spirals ( wspi ) .",
    "the solution branch of stable tvf ( spi ) is connected to unstable ribbons @xcite via stable wtvf ( wspi ) .",
    "then , a jump bifurcation @xcite from the end of the stable wtvf ( wspi ) branch leads to the stable spi ( tvf ) branch .",
    "this bifurcation behavior is schematically illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig01 ] .    note that in the majority of publications , the wtvf solution branch has been seen to return to the tvf branch or to undergo higher order bifurcations @xcite at larger driving .",
    "on the other hand , rigid non - rotating lids at the axial ends ( rigid boundary conditions , rbc ) induce rotational symmetric ekman vortices even for sub - critical driving @xcite .",
    "this modifies the structure , stability and bifurcation behavior of the different states .",
    "one important difference between pbc and rbc is the absence of _ pure _ spi solutions for rbc , in particular , for moderate outer cylinder rotation , i.e. within the left part of fig .",
    "[ fig01 ] .",
    "the rotational - symmetric ekman modes interact with the spiral modes leading to wspi which bifurcate primarily out of the basic ekman state and play a similar role as the spi under pbc @xcite .",
    "furthermore , under rbc , wspi loses its stability for stronger inner cylinder rotation and we found traveling defects which trigger the transition from wspi to stable tvf .    in @xcite , we described a situation where a similar defect which separates domains of oppositely traveling spiral waves propagates through the system and trigger a transition from right - handed to left - handed spirals or vice versa .",
    "thus , the transition from wspi to tvf is a further example for a transition which is triggered by a propagating defect .",
    "this paper elucidates how tvf are transformed into spi and vice versa under the presence of ekman induced disturbances , how stability is transferred between the branches , and where and what kind of transients occur under rbc .",
    "it is roughly divided into two parts corresponding to the transition from tvf to wspi via wtvf and the transition from wspi to tvf via a propagating defect .",
    "structural dynamics , frequencies and wave number selection are discussed and a comparison of the results obtained for rbc and pbc is made .",
    "the taylor - couette system consists of a fluid of kinematic viscosity @xmath0 in the gap between two concentric , independently rotating cylinders ( inner , outer radius @xmath1 ; angular velocities @xmath2 ; fixed radius ratio @xmath3 and fixed length @xmath4 in units of the gap width @xmath5 ) and non - rotating , rigid lids at the axial ends .",

    "the reynolds numbers @xmath16 enter into the boundary conditions for @xmath8 . @xmath17 and @xmath18 are just the reduced azimuthal velocities of the fluid at the cylinder surfaces . within this paper , we hold fixed @xmath19 .    for numerical simulations , we used the g1d3 code described in @xcite , i.e. a combination of a finite differences method in radial @xmath20 and axial @xmath21 direction and a galerkin expansion in @xmath22 direction :    @xmath23    in the experimental setup , the inner cylinder ( @xmath24 mm ) is machined from stainless steel , while the outer cylinder ( @xmath25 mm ) is made from optically polished glass .",
    "as fluid thermostatically controlled silicone oil with a kinematic viscosity @xmath26 cs is used . at top and bottom the flow is confined by massive end - walls with a till better than 0.03 mm at the outer diameter .",
    "the flow is visualized by elliptical aluminum particles having a length of 80 @xmath27 m .",
    "flow visualization measurements are performed by monitoring the system with a ccd - camera in front of the cylinder recording the luminosity along a narrow axial stripe .",
    "the spatio - temporal behavior of the flow is then represented by successive stripes for each time step at a constant @xmath22 position leading to continuous space time plots .",
    "as in the periodic system @xcite , we also found transitions between the two primary bifurcating structures tvf and ( w)spi in the finite length system .",
    "the main difference between both is that we do not observe ( neither in simulations nor in experiments ) _ pure _ spirals for @xmath4 systems , i.e. helical structures with the continuous symmetry given by @xmath28 for fixed @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 ( c.f .",

    "the transition from wtvf to spi ( wspi ) includes an unstable transient ribbon state , but we did not try to stabilize this state for rbc .    generally speaking , there are three major aspects concerning the finite and the periodic system : ( i ) wspi in ( a ) play quite the same role as the pure spi in ( b )  we indicated this by the prime at the labels a , c , e , f distinguishing the different stability regions ( c.f .",

    "spi  for pbc ( d ) , spirals and ribbons grow via a primary hopf bifurcation with a common frequency out of ccf .",
    "the difference between the spiral frequencies for pbc ( d ) and rbc ( c ) is a consequence of the reynolds - stress driven ( intrinsic ) axial net flow which is directed oppositely to the spiral propagation . in finite systems ,",
    "this net flow is suppressed by impermeable lids which leads to a shift in the axial phase velocity and thereby also in the frequency @xcite .",
    "this effect can also be seen for the wspi in ( c ) and the spi in ( d ) : whereas the frequencies of both spirals ( @xmath38 and @xmath39 ) are nearly identical at e - f , the frequencies of the @xmath39 spi at e - f and the @xmath39 wspi at e-f differ .",
    "wtvf  on the other hand , the wtvf frequencies at the bifurcation thresholds e - f and e-f are almost identical . here , the intrinsic net flow of the @xmath41 mode is compensated by that of the @xmath42 mode in both cases ( c ) and ( d ) .",
    "moreover , the variation of wtvf and spi frequencies in region f differs significantly .    since wtvf is a time - periodic rotating state that does not propagate axially , all mode frequencies are either zero ( @xmath43 ) or multiples of @xmath44 .",
