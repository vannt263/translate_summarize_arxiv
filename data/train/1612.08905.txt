    "<S> however , in our system , the presence of many 1d wires resultant from the large degeneracy screens the coulomb interaction and will not suffer from a similar divergence@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , denser packing of the wires gives rise to a larger screening effect as seen when we discuss the multi - pair case .    </S>",
    "<S> in 1d , the effects of disorder and interaction are both enhanced , and the resultant localization of electrons should be much pronounced and manifest in observable quantities . </S>",
    "<S> firstly , backward scatterings without reversing the side index are permissible since we do not consider the impurity potential to alter the pseudospin state , i.e. , one has the scattering term @xmath73 . </S>",

    "<S> this is in fact starting from the delocalized phase and can not go deep into the localized phase above the scale of the localization length @xmath79 since it will flow to strong coupling . on the other hand , directly inspecting the massive localized phase , variational method should prevail . </S>",

    "<S> , we end up with an effective 1d model with only the @xmath3-independent combination @xmath90 present . </S>",
    "<S> this is not surprising because the guiding center representation we introduced is in fact used at its continuum limit ( @xmath27 ) . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , this means that , up to the leading order effect at the strong - field limit , the system behaves in a way independent to the field .    </S>",

    "<S> we use @xmath112 to count the pairs of opposite - chirality weyl points in the first brillouin zone . in the same spirit , we consider a similar bosonization problem of many quasi-1d wires with both intra - copy and inter - copy coulomb interactions included , followed by deriving the 1d model of a single wire . for the impurity effects , following the previous formalism , we can take all the intra - copy impurity scatterings into account . by minimizing the total energy excess </S>",
    "<S> , we accordingly obtain an @xmath112-dependent exponent @xmath113 that enters the temperature dependence of resistivity@xcite . on the other hand , from the action </S>",
    "<S> expressed using the replica method@xcite , we can make a wilsonian analysis to develop the first - order renormalization group equation for the impurity strength @xmath114 . </S>",
    "<S> both the intra - copy and inter - copy impurity scatterings lead to the same form @xmath115 . </S>",
    "<S> this means , taking all the impurity scatterings into account , the exponent will just be given by @xmath116 .    </S>",
    "<S> it is important to note that all the previous conclusions on green s function , localization and resistivity also hold for the trb case with any @xmath112 while an even @xmath112 is for the ib case . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , as calculation shows , when @xmath117 and @xmath112 is the same , the two cases share the same @xmath62 or @xmath83 . </S>",
    "<S> remarkabll , @xmath62 is not directly related to @xmath83 in contrast to the simple formula @xmath118 in the standard case . </S>",
    "<S> this is because , due to the inter - wire coulomb interactions , the effective action @xmath119 contains rather complex momentum - frequency dependence [ eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( s43 ) of sm@xcite ] . as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : multiexponent ] , the multi - pair @xmath120 ( @xmath116 ) decreases ( increases ) with @xmath112 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath120 increases from @xmath121 and diverges asymptotically proportional to @xmath122 while @xmath116 ranges from @xmath86 to @xmath123 upon increasing @xmath87 from @xmath88 to @xmath89 . </S>",
    "<S> this can be understood with the many - wire picture we rely on . </S>",
    "<S> when there are @xmath112 pairs , one has the freedom to place the corresponding guiding center lattices in the @xmath20-@xmath21 plane as uniform as possible to form sublattices of the original sparsest one . as aforementioned , the coulomb interaction will be screened by the wires resultant from any copy . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the denser packing of the wires entails stronger screening and weaker interaction effects . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the exponent @xmath116 , although can not exceed its noninteracting value @xmath86 , approaches @xmath86 more quickly when @xmath112 increases . and </S>",
    "<S> when the coulomb interaction is extremely strong , i.e. , @xmath124 , the deviation , @xmath125 , is exactly inversely proportional to @xmath112 .    _ _ estimation for tap.__let us estimate the exponent of the weyl semimetal tap , which , known to date , might have the simplest stucture of weyl points and is beneficial to revealing the interested physics@xcite . among all the 12 pairs of weyl </S>",
    "<S> points therein , 8 pairs well separated in momentum space off the @xmath126 plane are found to locate at the chemical potential while others lie rather lower , possibly leading to only 8 pairs determining the low - energy physics . </S>",
    "<S> we thus set @xmath127 and take the typical values of fermi velocities and relative permittivity@xcite , @xmath128 , @xmath129 and hence @xmath130 , and get @xmath131 . </S>",
    "<S> experimentally , to observe this , one should keep the temperature or frequency lower than the cyclotron gap to assure the dominance of the 1d channels .    _ </S>",
