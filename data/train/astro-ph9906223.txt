    "the dynamics of accretion close the event horizon of black holes is of considerable interest to astronomers because that is where most of the accretion energy is released and because strong - field gravitational effects may be evident there .",
    "much of the work on thin disks around black holes assumes that the disk ends at or near @xmath2 , the radius of the marginally stable circular orbit . inside @xmath3",
    ", material is assumed to nearly free - fall onto the black hole ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this implies the so - called `` no - torque '' boundary condition on the disk , and leads to a disk whose surface brightness vanishes at the inner edge ( @xcite ) .",
    "the no - torque boundary condition leads to the classical estimate for the accretion efficiency @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the `` energy at infinity '' per unit mass of a particle at the marginally stable orbit .",
    "@xmath6 ranges between @xmath7 for a nonrotating ( @xmath8 ) black hole , to @xmath9 for a prograde disk around a maximally rotating ( @xmath10 ) black hole .",
    "it was realized early on , however , that magnetic fields might alter the dynamics of the accreting material and hence the accretion efficiency ( see , e.g. , j. m. bardeen quoted in @xcite ) .",
    "more recently , it has been argued that the magnetic fields threading the accreting material should be strong enough to be dynamically important , but not so strong that the fields can be regarded as force - free ( @xcite ) .    in this letter",
    "i estimate the magnetic torque on the inner edge of a thin accretion disk in the kerr metric .",
    "i use a model for the inflow that is based on earlier work by @xcite , following @xcite and camenzind 1986a,1986b,1989 .",
    "consider a thin disk in the equatorial plane of the kerr metric . because the disk is thin , @xmath11 , so the relativistic enthalpy @xmath12 .",
    "the disk is magnetically turbulent ( @xcite ) with magnetic energy density @xmath13 ( @xcite ) , where @xmath14 is the usual dimensionless viscosity of accretion disk theory .",
    "i will assume that @xmath15 so that magnetic fields make a negligible contribution to the hydrostatic equilibrium of the disk .",
    "then the disk has an inner surface at @xmath16 , with @xmath17 , so @xmath18 . at the inner surface of the disk",
    "i imagine that magnetic field lines rise approximately radially through the disk atmosphere and force the atmosphere to corotate with the disk surface .",
    "high enough in this corotating atmosphere , the gradient of the effective potential changes sign and the gas begins to stream inward along field lines toward the black hole . as gas leaves the disk , the character of the flow changes , becoming less turbulent and more nearly laminar .",
    "this picture leads one to consider a steady , axisymmetric inflow close to the equatorial plane of the kerr metric . in what follows",
    ", i will work exclusively in boyer - lindquist coordinate @xmath19 , and follow the notational conventions of @xcite .",
    "i assume that , in the poloidal plane , the fluid velocity and magnetic field are purely radial , i.e. that @xmath20 and @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the four - velocity and @xmath23 is the electromagnetic field ( `` maxwell '' ) tensor ; recall that in the nonrelativistic limit , denoted @xmath24 , @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the magnetic field three - vector .",
    "i also assume that all flow variables are functions only of @xmath27 , i.e. , that @xmath28 .",
    "this one - dimensional flow is similar in spirit to the old @xcite model for the solar wind , turned inside - out . as in the weber - davis model",
    ", the magnetic field has a monopolar geometry .",
    "i will also assume perfect conductivity , so that the electric field vanishes in a frame comoving with the fluid : @xmath29 together with the symmetry conditions , this leaves @xmath23 with six nonzero components : @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) , @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) , and @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) , and gives the relation @xmath36 .",
    "thus the electromagnetic field has only two degrees of freedom .",
    "the flow symmetries reduce maxwell s equations to @xmath37 and @xmath38 the first equation is the relativistic `` isorotation '' law , which can be rewritten @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the rotation frequency @xmath41 at the radius where @xmath42 . the second equation is the relativistic equivalent of @xmath43 .",
    "conservation of particle number leads to a conserved `` rest mass flux '' , per unit @xmath44 , @xmath45 here @xmath46 particle number density multiplied by the rest mass per particle and @xmath47 is the three - velocity .",
    "the conserved angular momentum flux is @xmath48 ,      \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath49 is the stress - energy tensor , @xmath50 , @xmath51 .",
    "the conserved mass - energy flux is @xmath52 ,      \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and , consistent with the thin disk approximation , i have neglected the thermal energy s contribution to @xmath53 .",
    "notice that the accretion efficiency is given by @xmath54 .",
    "the final equation needed to close the system is the normalization of four - velocity , @xmath55 henceforth i will set @xmath56 . ; time : @xmath57 ; mass : @xmath58 ; @xmath34 : @xmath59 , while @xmath60 . ]    equations ( [ perfcon ] ) through ( [ fournorm ] ) describe a one dimensional inflow model with a series of algebraic relations .",
    "this model is physically identical to that developed by @xcite , although cast is somewhat different notation .",
    "also , unlike @xcite , i specialize to the case where the inflow is anchored in a thin disk at the marginally stable orbit .",
    "this sets the inflow in a specific astrophysical context and allows one to relate it to an accretion efficiency .",
    "these inflow solutions have also been explored by @xcite and , in unpublished work , by camenzind and englmaier .",
    "the inflow model has 6 dynamical variables : @xmath61 and @xmath34 , and 6 conserved quantities : @xmath62 and @xmath63 , so the equations are fully integrated . what sets the conserved quantities ?",
    "the mass flux @xmath64 has been normalized to @xmath65 , but more physically it is set by conditions in the disk at large radius .",
    "the normalization of four - velocity gives @xmath66 .",
    "@xmath34 is related to the magnetic flux emerging from the inner edge of the disk .",
    "this is presumably determined by the action of magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) turbulence in the disk and the interaction of the disk with the inflow itself .",
    "i will treat it as a parameter of the problem , and estimate reasonable values for it later .",
    "three quantities remain to be specified .",
    "it seems reasonable to require that the energy and angular momentum fluxes be continuous across the boundary between the inflow and the disk .",
    "it also seem reasonable to require that the inflow four - velocity match continuously onto the disk . happily",
    ", these requirements do not overconstrain the problem .",
    "if @xmath67 and @xmath68 , then one can show that @xmath69 at @xmath70 ; here @xmath71 .",
    "this eliminates two degrees of freedom by expressing @xmath53 in terms of @xmath72 and by fixing @xmath40 .",
    "the energy and angular momentum flux are then continuous if the viscous ( more properly , turbulent ) angular momentum flux of the disk just outside @xmath70 matches the electromagnetic angular momentum flux of the inflow just inside @xmath70 : @xmath73 this condition will be automatically satisfied once the disk relaxes to a steady state , since the disk will increase its surface density until it can carry off the entire outward electromagnetic angular momentum ( and energy ) flux from the inflow .",
    "the final degree of freedom ( @xmath72 , or equivalently , @xmath53 ) is fixed by the condition that the flow pass smoothly through the fast critical point .",
    "thus @xmath72 and @xmath53 emerge as `` eigenvalues '' of the solution .",
    "once the model parameters are fixed , the resulting set of nonlinear algebraic equations must be solved numerically .",
    "i obtain @xmath72 , and the location of the fast critical point ( @xmath74 ) via simultaneous solution of @xmath75 here i have used the fact that the critical point is a saddle point of @xmath76 .",
    "i use the multidimensional newton - raphson method of @xcite , and for simplicity i evaluate the derivatives numerically .",
    "there is one subtlety involved in the solution . in calculating @xmath77",
    "one must solve a quadratic equation for @xmath78 ( or equivalently @xmath79 ) , so one must decide which root is physical . in general",
    "this is a nontrivial matter , since the physical solution skirts a region in the @xmath80 plane where the discriminant of the quadratic vanishes ( the solution makes a smooth transition from one branch of the solution to another ) .",
    "fortunately it turns out that one branch is appropriate in the neighborhood of @xmath3 and the other in the neighborhood of the fast point , so in practice this subtlety is easily dealt with .",
    "figure 1 shows @xmath81 for a solution with @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "the dot marks the fast point at @xmath84 .",
    "this solution has @xmath85 and @xmath86 , so @xmath87 , i.e. energy is extracted from the black hole .",
    "evidently magnetic fields can significantly alter the efficiency from the classical value .",
    "figure 2 shows contours of the eigenvalue @xmath72 in a survey over the @xmath88 plane ( see also fig . 3 of @xcite ) .",
    "for strong field and large black hole spin ( up and to the right of the heavy solid line in the figure ) , @xmath89 . @xcite",
    "have shown that @xmath89 if the field rotation frequency @xmath40 is exceeded by the characteristic rotation frequency of the space time , @xmath90 ) ) , at the alfvn point .",
    "figure 3 shows contours of the accretion efficiency @xmath0 evaluated over a portion of the @xmath88 plane ( see also fig . 4 of @xcite ) .",
    "the contours in figure 3 are located at intervals of @xmath91 . for strong field and large",
    "black hole spin ( up and to the right of the heavy solid line in the figure ) , @xmath92 , that is , energy is extracted from the black hole .",
    "as @xcite have shown , this can only happen if the alfvn point lies within the ergosphere ( @xmath93 ) .",
    "the heavy dashed line corresponds to the classical efficiency of prograde disk around a maximally rotating black hole , @xmath94 .",
    "what is an astrophysically sensible value for the crucial magnetic field strength parameter @xmath34 ?",
    "i will make a purely newtonian estimate , for clarity and because the relativistic corrections are likely to be smaller than the other sources of uncertainty .",
    "suppose that the radial field leaving the disk is @xmath95 , where subscript @xmath96 denotes a quantity evaluated in the disk and @xmath97 .",
    "it is a result of numerical models of disk turbulence that @xmath98 ( e.g. @xcite ) . using the usual steady state disk equation @xmath99",
    ", i find @xmath100 if the inner edge of the disk is at @xmath101 , @xmath102 , so the region of parameter space shown in figures 2 and 3 is likely relevant to disks .",
    "the inflow model thus suggests that the presence of a modest magnetic field , and the accompanying torque on the inner edge of the disk , can significantly increase the efficiency of thin disk accretion onto black holes . for @xmath103 and @xmath104 , @xmath105 , while for @xmath106 , @xmath107 .",
    "the added luminosity manifests itself as an increase in the surface brightness of the disk due to the torque applied at its inner boundary . in the same quasi - newtonian spirit as the estimate of @xmath34 ,",
    "the surface brightness profile becomes @xmath108 ( see @xcite ) and @xmath109 in the shakura - sunyaev model . here",
    "@xmath110 .",
    "the inflow model also suggests that , because material accretes with a smaller specific angular momentum than it would in the absence of magnetic fields , it is more difficult to manufacture a rapidly spinning hole by disk accretion .",
    "an equilibrium spin is reached when @xmath111 ( e.g. @xcite , eq .",
    "10 ) . for @xmath106 this equilibrium value",
    "is reached at @xmath112 .",
    "a major limitation of this study ( which should be regarded as an instructive example rather than a source for estimating efficiencies ) , is that i have ignored the vertical structure of the inflow .",
    "crudely speaking , one might expect that field lines which do not lie in the midplane are more lightly loaded ( @xmath113 is larger ) so that specific energy and angular momentum fluxes might increase away from the midplane , until at sufficient latitude one reaches a field line which would rather inflate away than remain tied between the inflow and the disk . at high latitude , then , the outward electromagnetic energy flux might emerge in the form of a wind , and be better described by the force - free magnetosphere model of @xcite .",
    "another major limitation is the simplified , monopolar field geometry .",
    "this limitation can be overcome by direct numerical integration of the basic equations .",
    "evidently numerical models of inflow inside the marginally stable orbit would be enormously interesting .",
    "fortunately they are now practical , at least within the mhd approximation .",
    "stu shapiro s thoughtful advice has greatly improved this paper .",
    "i am also grateful to eric agol , roger blandford , jeremy goodman , john hawley , julian krolik , jochen peitz , and gordon ogilvie for their comments , and to phil myers and the radio group at the center for astrophysics for their hospitality ."
