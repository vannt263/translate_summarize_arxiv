    "the precise experimental characterization of the properties of bose - condensed gases has motivated the development of theoretical methodologies that can provide accurate and comprehensive descriptions of the condensed gas behavior .",
    "the fundamental theoretical framework is provided by many - body quantum field theory , but in general this becomes tractable only within approximation schemes , of which the most common are based around bogoliubov s idea of representing the condensed atoms by a classical mean field . in the very simplest form , this gives rise to the ubiquitous gross - pitaevskii equation , where the mean field is interpreted as the wavefunction of the condensate .",
    "the solution of the gross - pitaevskii equation has provided a useful first approximation to a wide range of equilibrium and dynamical phenomena , but the equation describes only the condensate , and neglects all spontaneous and incoherent processes .",
    "there are many situations where the condensate is accompanied by a component of thermal atoms which can have an important influence on the system properties and behavior , and the early mean - field treatments have been extended to give some level of description of the noncondensed atoms , by employing factorization approximations to the thermal component of the quantum field @xcite . such _",
    "self - consistent mean - field _ theories are built on the fictional @xcite but convenient and intuitively appealing assumption that bose condensation breaks the @xmath0 phase symmetry of the underlying quantum field hamiltonian , resulting in the appearance of _ anomalous moments _ of the field : moments of the field operator [ such as the mean field @xmath1 which are formally zero in a state of fixed particle number , but which acquire nonzero values in the symmetry - breaking approximation .",
    "these treatments have provided an improved description of a range of equilibrium or near - equilibrium phenomena , but suffer from internal consistency problems , and have had limited success in describing the dynamics of the condensate at higher temperatures ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "we note that many of the equilibrium predictions of the symmetry - breaking mean - field descriptions are regained in more careful , number - conserving approaches @xcite , however those methods have not provided a broadly tractable approach for dynamical or higher temperature systems .    in recent years",
    ", a set of techniques has been developed that provides a unified nonperturbative description of both equilibrium and dynamical behavior of bose gases for a temperature range from zero to close to the critical temperature .",
    "these so - called classical - field ( or c - field ) techniques @xcite have been used to provide a quantitative description of a number of key experimental results and regimes beyond mean - field theory ( see @xcite for a summary of the broad range of recent applications ) .",
    "while the treatment superficially resembles the zero - temperature gross - pitaevskii theory , the interpretation of the central object of the theory , the classical field @xmath2 , is very different : rather than the condensate wavefunction , it is an approximation to the bose _ field operator _ , and provides a means to evaluate quantum - mechanical correlation functions and their time development .",
    "these correlation functions can be calculated by ensemble methods @xcite , or for the case of equilibrium bose - gas thermodynamics , by ergodic hamiltonian methods @xcite .    in this paper , we demonstrate that rich information is encoded in the temporal behavior of hamiltonian classical - field trajectories .",
    "indeed in @xcite we found that the temporal correlations of a classical field revealed a strong signature of a quasicondensate - like structure in a spatially disordered ( vortex liquid ) phase .",
    "here we consider the temporal correlations of a classical field containing a true condensate .",
    "the phase of a condensate is _ by definition _ @xcite rigid across the spatial extent of the condensed mode , and the only condensate - phase fluctuations are _ global _ ones , which imply a diffusion of the phase over time ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "this diffusion restores the @xmath0 phase symmetry of the system in the ergodic ( microcanonical ) density of the field , and anomalous moments such as @xmath3 evaluated in this density therefore have vanishing values , consistent with the formal many - body theory for conserved particles .",
    "however , the time scale of this phase diffusion is typically long compared with the correlation times of thermal modes in the field @xcite , and we thus find that the condensate can be identified from the short - time average of the field in a frame phase - rotating uniformly at the underlying ( mean ) phase - rotation frequency of the condensate . in this way",
    "phase - symmetry breaking emerges naturally from the hamiltonian classical - field formalism .",
    "we demonstrate that this averaging procedure constitutes a _ general _ analog of the ` anomalous ' averaging operation of symmetry - broken theories @xcite by calculating the _ anomalous thermal density _ , which characterizes pairing correlations in the noncondensed component of the field which are induced by the interacting condensate .",
