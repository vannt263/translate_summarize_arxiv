    "strong indications of neutrino oscillations have been gathered in the atmospheric and solar neutrino experiments @xcite .",

    "there is further indication of neutrino oscillation in the , so far unconfirmed , lsnd data @xcite , which would require a very distinct mass difference : @xmath9 @xmath8 . in order to accommodate all mass squared differences ,",
    "at least four light species of neutrinos are needed , one of which must be sterile , i.e. , singlet under the standard model ( sm ) gauge group @xcite .",
    "among all neutrino spectra involving one sterile neutrino there are two somewhat preferred by the combined analysis of solar , atmospheric and lsnd experiments @xcite .",

    "( scheme a ) , the two heaviest neutrinos correspond basically to the solar neutrinos , and in the other ( scheme b ) , these are mainly the atmospheric neutrinos .",
    "the atmospheric signal is interpreted as a @xmath11 oscillation while the solar deficit is explained as a @xmath12 oscillation . in this paper",
    ", we will restrict ourselves to these scenarios .",
    "it is important to point out that when the solar neutrino problem is interpreted as @xmath13 oscillations , only the small angle msw solution ( samsw ) is allowed @xcite , yielding the fits @xmath14 and @xmath15 .    here",
    "we will consider a scenario with a @xmath16 mass matrix for the three active neutrinos plus the sterile one .",
    "we define the effective mass term for the four species of neutrinos in the flavor basis as = - ^t m _ + [ mnu ] where @xmath17 and @xmath18 is the neutrino mass matrix .",
    "this is diagonalized in the usual way = v^ * d v^where v is a unitary @xmath16 matrix relating flavor eigenstates to mass eigenstates = v and @xmath19 , with all @xmath20 .",
    "it will be useful in the analysis of the complex case to absorb the majorana phases in the maki - nakagawa - sakata ( mns ) matrix @xmath21 @xcite , defined as u = vdiag(e^-i _ 1/2,e^-i _ 2/2,e^-i _ 3/2,1 ) so that @xmath22 .",
    "we will consider just the sm fields plus one singlet fermion , to be regarded as the sterile neutrino ( the extension to the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) is straightforward ) .",
    "the majorana mass matrix for the three active neutrinos and the sterile one is formed by three kinds of terms .",
    "the active - active entries of the mass matrix come from a dimension five operator @xcite = -_ij ( hl_i)(hl_j ) + h.c .",
    ", where @xmath23 is the sm higgs , @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) are the lepton doublets and @xmath26 is a @xmath27 symmetric matricial coupling . there is also a purely majorana mass term for the sterile neutrino    = - _ s m_s _ s + h.c . , and yukawa couplings , responsible for the active - sterile mixing = y_i _ s hl_i + h.c .. after electroweak symmetry breaking , a @xmath16 mass matrix for the four species of neutrinos arises _",

    "@xmath33 and @xmath34 are the @xmath35 gauge coupling and the quartic higgs coupling respectively , and @xmath36 are the yukawa matrices for up quarks , down quarks and charged leptons .",
    "previous papers @xcite have considered the modification of the mixing angles and mass splittings due to the last term in eq.([rg1 ] ) in scenarios with three active neutrinos .",
    "the first term in eq.([rg1 ] ) , which depends on @xmath37 , produces a flavor independent modification of the active neutrino mass matrix .",
    "however , in eq.([rg2 ] ) the dependence on @xmath37 is different , while eq.([rg3 ] ) lacks a @xmath37 dependent term , thus important modifications of the mass texture are expected now .",
    "this will have important consequences on the theoretical plausibility of some kinds of neutrino spectra .",
    "the aim of this paper is to impose naturalness constraints on sterile neutrino scenarios from radiative corrections .",
    "this approach has already been employed for the three active neutrinos scenario @xcite , but now the effects are expected to be larger , as a consequence of the different nature of the sterile neutrino . furthermore , similar strong renormalization effects are expected in more general models containing sterile neutrinos .",
    "recalling that the yukawa coupling between the active and the sterile neutrinos must be small , in order to have masses of @xmath31(1 ev ) , in a first approximation we can neglect all couplings but @xmath37 in eqs.([rg1],[rg2],[rg3 ] ) . in this approximation ,",
    "the rge for the neutrino mass matrix is [ rg4 ] .",
    "it is worth noticing that the rge for the mass matrix has _ formally _ the same structure as the one considered in previous works for the three neutrino case ( see eq.(14 ) in @xcite ) with @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "therefore , we can apply the general results derived there to obtain the rges for the mass eigenvalues [ rgmass ] ( 1 - |u_si|^2 ) m_i , and the mns matrix u t , [ urg ] with @xmath40 a @xmath16 matrix defined as [ tgendef ] t_ii&&0 , + t_ij & & , ij , with @xmath41 . starting with degenerate neutrino masses at a high energy scale @xmath42",
    ", the degeneracy will be lifted at @xmath43 by terms proportional to the top yukawa coupling , in a way that depends on the last row of the mns matrix . strictly speaking , when @xmath44 , there would be a divergence in eq.([urg ] ) , but there is also an ambiguity in the definition of the mns matrix .",
    "it can be shown @xcite that , once the ambiguity is removed by the running , the mixing matrix satisfies @xmath45 , making eq.([urg ] ) finite .    for the mssm case , the relevant rges for this analysis can be found in @xcite , although there is a complete analogy with the sm case : neglecting all couplings but the top yukawa coupling , eq.([rgmass ] ) is still valid with the replacement @xmath46 .    in view of the form of the rges for the masses and mixing angles , any information about the @xmath47 elements of the mns matrix would be certainly valuable . fortunately , the remarkable agreement between the predictions of big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) and the observed abundance of primordial light elements sets stringent bounds on @xmath47 .",
    "the upper bound @xmath48 for the effective number of neutrinos implies that , for scheme a @xcite    10 ^ -4 .",
    "[ bbnb ]    these constraints will have important consequences in the analysis to follow .",
    "as explained in the introduction , radiative corrections play an important role when two mass eigenstates are almost degenerate , i.e. , @xmath49 .",
    "if this is the case , the renormalization group evolution can produce mass differences larger than the observed ones , requiring a fine tuning of the neutrino parameters at high energy to achieve a correct splitting .",
    "this fact was exploited in @xcite to impose severe constraints on the vacuum oscillation solution to the solar neutrino problem . in this paper",
    "we are going to perform a similar analysis for the experimentally favored neutrino patterns presented in the introduction .",
    "we will assume that at some high energy scale @xmath42 new physics generates a neutrino mass texture @xmath50 in which the heaviest pair of neutrinos have masses nearly degenerated and the other two are @xmath51 ( we neglect the effects of the rges on the masses of the two lightest eigenstates because a hierarchical spectrum will not be essentially modified by the running ) .",
    "after integration from @xmath42 to @xmath43 , the radiatively corrected mass eigenvalues can be obtained from eq.([rgmass ] ) , giving m_1(m_z ) ~ & 0 , + m_2(m_z ) ~ & 0 , + m_3(m_z ) & m_3 ( )   i_t   i_s3 , + m_4(m_z ) & m_4 ( )   i_t   i_s4 , [ eigensame ] where i_t(-_t_z^t _ dt^ ) ,   i_si ( _ t_z^t _ |u_si|^2(t^)dt^ ) .",

    "therefore , it is in this scheme where larger renormalization effects are expected and will be studied in detail , both the real and the complex case . on the other hand , in scheme",
    "b the heaviest pair of neutrinos has a small sterile component and the required splitting between them is larger , so in this case radiative corrections are not expected to have dramatic consequences .        throughout the analysis of the real case",
    "we will work for convenience with the @xmath60 matrix , setting all the cp violating phases in @xmath60 to @xmath61 and allowing the majorana phases to be either @xmath61 or @xmath62 , yielding positive or negative mass eigenvalues , respectively . in this case",
    "the renormalization effects are sensitive to the relative sign of the mass eigenvalues . in consequence",
    ", we will consider the two possibilities separately : @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "@xmath65 @xmath66    the solar splitting produced in scheme a by the renormalization group evolution can be obtained from eqs.([eigensame ] ) , giving m_sol^2m_0 ^ 2   i_t^2 i_s4 ^ 2 ( 1- i_s3 ^ 2 i_s4 ^ -2 ) , [ oscila1 ] where @xmath67 1 ev to account for the lsnd anomaly .",
    "the degeneracy of the mass eigenstates at @xmath42 has also an important impact on the radiative corrections of the mixing matrix .",
    "the renormalization group equation of the mns matrix , given by eq.([urg ] ) , is dominated in this case by t_43= v_s4 v_s3 .",
    "[ tdomin ] thus , the renormalization group evolution will quickly drive @xmath68 in the infrared @xcite .",
    "therefore , the bbn constraint ( [ bbna ] ) implies that @xmath69 .",
    "this value is close to the fixed point @xmath70 and will not change appreciably with the scale , hence , it can be considered constant . in this approximation , and neglecting terms of the order of @xmath71 , eq.([oscila1 ] ) reads m_sol^2m_lsnd^2 ( 1-i_t^2 v_s4 ^ 2 ) ~m_lsnd^2 ( 1-i_t^2 ) .",

    ", we get from ( [ tuning ] ) @xmath81 , i.e. the initial splitting has to be adjusted in less than one part in @xmath82 . raising the values of @xmath83 or @xmath42 , or going to the supersymmetric case ,",
    "requires a higher degree of fine tuning .",
    "this subtle conspiracy between initial masses and radiative corrections makes this scenario implausible from the point of view of naturalness .",
    "@xmath84 @xmath85    in this case , the neutrino mass eigenvalues at @xmath43 are given by eq.([eigensame ] ) , with @xmath86 , while the solar mass splitting induced by the radiative corrections is given by eq.([oscila1 ] ) .",
    "now we do not expect abrupt changes in the relevant elements of the mixing matrix for the solar splitting ( there is no ambiguity in the diagonalization of the mass matrix ) . to be more precise , the rges for these matrix elements read - v_s3 ( 1-v_s3 ^ 2-v_s4 ^ 2 ) , ( for @xmath87 the rge is similar with the interchange @xmath88 ) .",
    "the bbn bound ( [ bbna ] ) implies that these elements can be considered constant in first approximation , hence @xmath89 .",
    "it is apparent from ( [ oscila1 ] ) that the splitting will be unacceptably large unless @xmath90 .    for definiteness",
    ", we will use the simple texture for the mixing matrix given in @xcite , although our results will not change essentially if we allow for more complicated textures .",
    "this texture almost decouples the @xmath91 and the @xmath92 sectors ( as suggested by bbn bounds ) and slightly rotates the @xmath93 plane by a small angle @xmath94 to generate a small mixing between the @xmath95 and @xmath96 sectors , in order to accommodate the lsnd signal .",
    "we could also have small rotations in the @xmath97 , @xmath98 and @xmath99 planes , but , as stressed before , the main results will remain unchanged .",
    "the mixing matrix at @xmath43 is [ texv ] v(m_z ) . using this mixing matrix and eq.([oscila1 ] ) , it is easy to see that the renormalization group evolution produces a solar mass splitting given by m_sol^2m_lsnd^2 [ 1- i_t^-2 ( ^2 _ sol-^2 _ sol^2 _ lsnd ) ] it is obvious that in order to obtain a sufficiently small splitting we must require @xmath100 ( typically , to obtain a mass splitting of the solar order the condition @xmath101 must be fulfilled ) . due to the smallness of @xmath102",
    "we infer that the mixing between @xmath103 and @xmath104 must be nearly maximal , and adjusted with high accuracy .",
    "this discredits the small angle msw solution to the solar neutrino problem ( the only acceptable one ) from the point of view of naturalness .",
    "the only way out would be , as before , an extremely artificial fine tuning between the initial masses and the renormalization group effects .      in the introduction",
    "it was explained that when @xmath105 the running quickly drives the mixing matrix to a form in which @xmath106 . in this section",
    "we will assume that we end up with a phenomenologically viable mixing matrix and then we will investigate the effect of the running on the mass splitting .",
    "when @xmath106 , the rges for @xmath107 and @xmath108 can be written as    [ rgecomplex1 ] ( for @xmath108 the rge is the same with the interchange @xmath109 ) .",
    "after imposing the bbn constraint ( [ bbna ] ) we can approximate the above equation by |u_s3|^2-    four - neutrino scenarios considered here only the small angle msw solution is allowed @xcite , then @xmath107 is small and by the bbn constraint ( [ bbna ] ) , @xmath108 is close to one .",
    "hence , eq.([rgecomplex2 ] ) implies that both @xmath107 and @xmath108 are approximately constant with the scale , yielding @xmath110 and @xmath111 . under those well founded hypotheses , the solar splitting induced by the running is m_sol^2m_lsnd^2 ( 1-i_t^2 ( |u_s4|^2-|u_s3|^2 ) ) ~m_lsnd^2 ( 1-i_t^2 ) , [ oscilcomplex ] where we have neglected terms of the order of @xmath107 and @xmath112 .",
    "the numerical results are identical to those after eq.([oscila2 ] ) , again too large by 3 - 5 orders of magnitude .",
    "we conclude that it is impossible to reconcile a phenomenologically acceptable mns matrix and an experimentally allowed mass splitting without a fine tuning between initial conditions and renormalization group effects .",
    "this permits us to completely discredit the scheme a for the four neutrino spectrum from a theoretical point of view .",
    "things work quite differently in this case . for the sm ,",
    "the induced splitting between the heaviest pair , to be identified with the atmospheric oscillation , is given by m_atm^2m_0 ^ 2   i_t^2 i_s4 ^ 2(1 - i_s3 ^ 2 i_s4 ^ -2 ) , [ atmosb1 ] with @xmath113 . the bbn constraint ( [ bbnb ] )",
    "requires both @xmath107 and @xmath108 to be smaller than @xmath114 .",

    "inversely , a mass difference of the order of the atmospheric oscillation generated at a high scale @xmath42 will not be upset by the radiative corrections .    for the mssm case , due to the smallness of @xmath107 and @xmath108",
    ", the effects induced by the top yukawa coupling will also be small .",
    "however , the effects of the tau yukawa coupling can be dominant in the large @xmath116 regime @xcite , so it is worth considering them in more detail . after including this coupling , the renormalization group equations for the mass eigenvalues are m_i , where @xmath117 and @xmath118 is the tau yukawa coupling . the induced splitting , in the leading - log approximation ,",

    "it is apparent that in order to generate the atmospheric splitting radiatively , a moderately large @xmath124 is needed , or a sizeable value of the cut - off .",
    "we have shown that radiative corrections in models with sterile neutrinos are potentially dangerous in many scenarios . due to the different interactions of the sterile neutrino ,",
    "the renormalization group behavior of the mass matrix for the active and sterile neutrinos presents a strong non - universality .",
    "this leads to induced splittings proportional to the top yukawa coupling , in contrast with the three neutrino scenario , where these splittings were found to be proportional to the tau yukawa coupling .",
    "this strong scale dependence of the mass matrix texture has allowed us to make some statements concerning the viability of some neutrino spectra .",
    "more precisely , we have analyzed the two schemes favored by the oscillation data , both consisting in two pairs of nearly degenerate neutrinos separated by the lsnd gap . requiring compatibility with the measurements of the abundances of primordial elements produced in big bang nucleosynthesis",
    ", we have found that when the heaviest pair corresponds to the solar neutrinos ( mainly an admixture of @xmath125 ) the splitting is not stable under radiative corrections , and the induced one is 3 - 5 orders of magnitude larger than the observed splitting , making the scenario completely implausible from a theoretical point of view , the only way out being an extreme fine tuning in the high energy parameters .",
    "incidentally , this scenario can be tested in the near future with neutrinoless double-@xmath126 decay experiments @xcite .    on the other hand , when the heaviest pair corresponds to the atmospheric neutrinos ( mainly @xmath127 ) , the scenario is safe from radiative corrections due to the small mixing of these mass eigenstates with the sterile neutrino . for the sm ,",
    "the induced mass differences are lower than the atmospheric splitting ( although close to the lower bound for this oscillation ) while for the mssm , there are regions of the parameter space where , beginning with degenerate neutrinos , the atmospheric splitting can be generated radiatively for a moderately large @xmath124 or a sizeable cut - off .",
