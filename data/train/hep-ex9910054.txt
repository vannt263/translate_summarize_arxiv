    "the cleo iii detector is designed to study decays of @xmath1 and @xmath2 quarks , @xmath3 leptons and @xmath4 mesons produced in @xmath5 collisions near 10 gev center - of - mass energy .",
    "the new detector is an upgraded version of cleo ii @xcite .",
    "it will contain a new four - layer silicon strip vertex detector , a new wire drift chamber and a particle identification system based on the detection of cherenkov ring images .",
    "the main physics goals of cleo iii include studies of the ckm matrix , cp violation and rare decays of @xmath6 mesons .",
    "these studies require , in most cases , the separation of charged kaons from charged pions .",
    "examples include studying the rare decay @xmath7 , where the background is from @xmath8 . measuring the cp violation rate asymmetry in @xmath8 , versus @xmath9 , where only the particle identification can distinguish between the two reactions .",
    "another example is measuring the rate for @xmath10 , where the dominant reaction is @xmath11 .",
    "there are many other physics goals where the role of the particle identification is useful but not as crucial as those mentioned above . as an example , consider the measurement of the ckm element @xmath12 which is thought to be best done using the reaction @xmath13 at the kinematic point where the @xmath6 transforms to a @xmath14 at rest in the @xmath6 rest frame . here reducing the background in the @xmath15 reconstruction becomes important .",
    "cleo iii has approximate cylindrical symmetry with endcaps for some detector elements .",
    "its outer shell consists of a muon detector , a super - conducting coil and an electromagnetic calorimeter that uses csi crystals .",
    "these are the same components as used in cleo ii . in order to achieve higher luminosity ,",
    "the machine quadrupole magnets have been moved much closer to the collision point and necessitated the reconstruction of the detector inside the calorimeter .",
    "a sketch of cleo iii is shown in fig .",
    "[ cleo ] @xcite .    7.0 in    cleo",
    "ii produced many physics results , but was hampered by its limited charged - hadron identification capabilities .",
    "design choices for particle identification were limited by radial space .",
    "the csi calorimeter imposed a hard outer limit and the desire for maintaining excellent charged particle tracking imposed a lower limit , since at high momentum the error in momentum is proportional to the square of the track length .",
    "the particle identification system was allocated only 20 cm of radial space , and this limited the technology choices .",
    "the highest momentum particles from @xmath6 decays occur in the two - body decay @xmath16 . due to the small @xmath6 motion ,",
    "the pions have a box shaped momentum distribution between 2.5 and 2.8 gev / c .",
    "the goal of the particle identification system is to separate kaons from pions up to this momentum .",
    "it is useful to define the number of standard deviation separation as the difference between two measured quantities divided by the error on the measurement .",
    "for example 2@xmath17 separation in cherenkov angle would require that the difference between measured angles for pions and kaons divided by the average error on both measurement be equal to two .",
    "( in practice the errors on both measurements are nearly equal , especially when the difference in expected cherenkov angle is small . )",
    "the drift chamber incorporates a measurement of specific ionization ( de / dx ) which allows good kaon / pion separation below 800 mev / c and useful , @xmath181.8@xmath17 separation , above 2.2 gev / c to about 3 gev / c .",
    "thus an addition particle identification system should have at least 3@xmath17 separation at high momentum and at least 4@xmath17 separation down to 800 mev / c .",
    "the cleo iii rich detector consists of three components : radiator , expansion volume , and photon detector .",
    "no focusing is used ; this is called `` proximity - focusing '' @xcite . when an incident charged particle with sufficient velocity ( @xmath19 ) passes through a radiator medium , it emits photons at an angle @xmath20 via the cherenkov effect ; some photons are internally reflected due to the large refractive index @xmath21 of the radiator , and some escape .",
    "these latter photons propagate in a transparent expansion volume , sufficiently large to allow the cherenkov cone to expand in size ( as much as other spatial constraints allow ) .",
    "the position of the photoelectrons are determined by a two - dimensional array of cathode - pads , in a photosensitive multi - wire chamber .",
    "the resulting images are portions of conic sections , distorted by refraction and truncated by internal reflection at the boundaries of media with different optical densities .",
    "thus , knowing the track parameters of the charged particle and the refractive index of the radiator , one can reconstruct the cherenkov angle @xmath22 from the photoelectron positions and extract the particle mass .",
    "this elegant and compact approach was pioneered by the fast - rich group @xcite .    in order to achieve efficient particle identification with low fake rates",
    ", we set as a design goal a system capable of @xmath23 separation with 4@xmath17 significance ( @xmath24 ) at 2.65 gev/@xmath2 , the mean momentum for the pions from @xmath16 decays at a symmetric @xmath5 collider . at this momentum , the @xmath23 cherenkov angle difference @xmath25 mr , which along with @xmath26 @xmath27 identification from the central drift chamber , requires a cherenkov angle resolution @xmath28",
    "mr per track .",
    "since the estimated angular resolution per photon is 14 mr @xcite using a 10 mm thick flat lif radiator , we need approximately 12 photons to meet our goal .",
    "the 20 cm radial space limitation requires us to use a compact photon detector .",
    "this is met by the use of triethyleamine gas ( tea ) , mixed with methane .",
    "this mixture has a mean absorption length of @xmath180.5 mm , but requires the use of light in the deep ultraviolet , between 135 - 165 nm .",
    "other choices such as tmae gas or phototubes would have taken most of our allotted space , and thus were not possible .",
    "other solutions such as dirc @xcite were not feasible for several reasons including the existing detector iron and the desire to limit the detector thickness to less than 12% of a radiation length .",
    "transparent materials in this wavelength region are limited to flouride crystals .",
    "thus the radiator is lif and the chamber windows are caf@xmath29 . the components of our system are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ richscm ] .",
    "they consist of a lif radiator , in which uv photons are generated , an expansion region , and a photosensitive detector .",
    "the angle @xmath30 is the polar angle of the incident particle with respect to the radiator normal , @xmath20 is the cherenkov angle and @xmath31 specifies the azimuthal angle of the cherenkov photons .    5.0 in    an end view of 1/10 of the detector is shown in fig .",
    "[ rich2 ] .",
    "the radiators are glued to the outside of a carbon fiber cylinder of 82 cm radius .",
    "the crystals ( approximately 17.5 cm x 17 cm x 1 cm ) are arranged in 30 rows running parallel to the axis of the cylinder .",
    "each row has 14 individual crystals . the inner cylinder and 30 photon detector modules are attached to end flanges and the space between them ( the expansion volume ) is filled with ultraviolet light ( uv ) transparent n@xmath29 gas .",

    "the caf@xmath29 window joints are placed directly on top of these spacers to minimize the loss of photon acceptance .",
    "some parameters of the rich detector are given in table  [ params ] .",
    ".rich photon detector parameters[params ] [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]      the average observed photon yields for the plane and sawtooth radiators at various incident angles are given in table  [ table : ngamma ] .",

    "[ fig : ressum ] provides a summary of angular resolution results from all datasets at all incident angles .",
    "the measured cherenkov angle resolution per track from the plane radiator data ( denoted by squares ) increases as a function of the incident track angle due to the increase in emission - point error .",
    "the beam - test monte carlo simulation gives the light dashed curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : ressum ] , which represents the data well .",
    "[ hbt ]    5.500 in    the per track resolution , e.g. 4.54  mr at 30@xmath33 , is somewhat larger than the nave extrapolation from angular resolution per photon and the number of observed photons , i.e. @xmath34 .",
    "monte carlo studies indicate that the sources of the increased resolution are the mwpc tracking errors ( the principal cause , @xmath322.3  mr at 30@xmath33 ) and the beam background ( @xmath321.2  mr at 30@xmath33 ) .",
    "the tracking errors in this experiment do not change with incident angle to the radiator , since the angle is changed by rotating the rich box .",
    "however , the emission - point error is effectively increased more with larger incident angles to the radiator , due to an incorrect track impact point on the radiator face . in cleo",
    "iii the background will be much reduced , and the tracking error contribution will be smaller , though still significant .",
    "we expect that the sawtooth radiator resolution will not be degraded by the tracking errors @xcite in cleo , while the plane radiator resolution is worsened and the degradation increases with dip angle .",
    "the tracking system has its poorest resolution in the direction along the electron beam .",
    "the sawtooth images are symmetric in this direction , and thus are less sensitive to the tracking errors than the plane radiator images .",
    "the tracking errors cause poorer resolution at larger angles .",
    "the measured track resolutions for the sawtooth radiators are higher than predicted by the beam - test monte carlo as shown by the heavy dashed curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : ressum ] .",
    "our simulation shows that this discrepancy is not due to the variation in tooth angle or the actual shape of the radiator surfaces .",
    "the relatively large values of the track resolution , above 4 mr , is due to the limited acceptance , caused by having only two photon detectors .    in order to estimate the ultimate performance of this rich ,",
    "an extrapolation was made based on the beam - test monte carlo .",
    "the background and tracking errors are associated only with our beam test , so both were removed from the simulation for this study .",
    "the resulting photoelectron yield was then corrected for the geometric acceptance of the beam - test setup and scaled to `` full acceptance '' , defined as 85%  of the solid angle covered by a cylindrical rich .",
    "this correction was applied to the sawtooth data only , as the plane radiator data are already at full acceptance .",
    "the result of this extrapolation for the per track resolution for the plane radiator is shown as the light solid curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : ressum ] , which is flat in track angle and below our benchmark of 4 mr for cleo iii .    for the sawtooth a large acceptance correction needs to be made .",
    "the geometric acceptance is approximately 50%  for all track angles . by naive statistical calculation this increases the per track resolution by 35% .",
    "monte carlo studies show that tracking errors are the next largest contribution ( e.g. 1.9  mr at 0@xmath33 ) , and are exacerbated in this configuration because one of the arcs in the image is out of the detector fiducial .",
    "the beam background is approximately constant for all track angles ( e.g. 1.3  mr at 0@xmath33 ) .",
    "the full acceptance extrapolation for the per track resolution for the sawtooth radiator , is shown as the heavy solid curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : ressum ] . here",
    "the muon tracking errors and the background have been removed and the photon acceptance of the sawtooth scaled to that of the plane radiator . the expected cleo iii",
    "rich performance will fall somewhere between the beam - test monte carlo curve and the `` full acceptance '' curve .    instead of extrapolating the resolution at the larger projected photoelectron yields",
    ", we can view the resolution per track already achieved in this data as a function of photoelectron yield .",
    "[ fig : mplot ] shows the cherenkov resolution per track for the 0@xmath33 sawtooth dataset as a function of photoelectron yield . for the expected yield of 18.8 per track ,",
    "the cherenkov resolution is 3.5  mr .",
    "this number which contains all experimental effects fits nicely between the best allowable resolution of 3 mr and below the measured average 4.5 mr . since this curve is derived from the data it automatically takes into account statistical and systematic effects .    in fig .",
    "[ oct20_k_trk ] we show the expectations of the resolution in cleo iii , where we have included the cleo iii tracking errors .",
    "the largest source of error for the sawtooth radiator is the chromatic dispersion , which is even larger for the plane radiator .",
    "however , the plane radiator also has large contributions from the emission point error ( not knowing where in the radiator the photon was emitted ) and the tracking error .",
    "averaging over the solid angle the cherenkov angular resolution will be approximately 4 mr , which is adequate to separate kaons from pions in the two - body @xmath6 decays to @xmath35 or @xmath36 , which have an average difference in cherenkov angle of 14.4 mr .",
    "a beam test of the first two sectors of the cleo iii rich detector has been successfully carried out .",
    "the resolution is better at smaller incident track angles and better for sawtooth radiators .",
    "the detector operated in a robust manner and will make a useful particle identifier for cleo iii .    for plane radiators we measure a full acceptance yield of between 12 - 14 photoelectrons , and cherenkov angular resolutions of 4 - 5 mr , depending on incident angles between 20@xmath37 and 40@xmath37 .",
    "our results are consistent with monte carlo expectations taking into account tracking errors and backgrounds .    for sawtooth radiators we must extrapolate to full acceptance .",
    "we expect between 18 - 19 photoelectrons between 0@xmath37 and 20@xmath37 incident track angles .",
    "the monte carlo under estimates somewhat the measured cherenkov angular resolution .",
    "however , even including an anomalous contribution of 1.4 mr in quadrature with our monte carlo expectations of 2.8 mr gives a projected cleo iii resolution of 3.1 mr .",
    "since the difference in @xmath23 cherenkov angles is 14.4 mr in the highest momentum range of @xmath6 decays , we expect that this detector will be useful indeed .",
