    "graphical models @xcite are a class of statistical models which combine the rigour of a probabilistic approach with the intuitive representation of relationships given by graphs .",
    "they are composed by a set @xmath1 of _ random variables _ describing the quantities of interest and a _ graph _",
    "@xmath2 in which each _ node _ or _ vertex _",
    "@xmath3 is associated with one of the random variables in @xmath4 ( they are usually referred to interchangeably ) .",
    "the _ edges _ @xmath5 are used to express the dependence relationships among the variables in @xmath4 .",
    "the set of these relationships is often referred to as the _ dependence structure _ of the graph .",
    "different classes of graphs express these relationships with different semantics , which have in common the principle that graphical separation of two vertices implies the conditional independence of the corresponding random variables @xcite .",
    "the two examples most commonly found in literature are _ markov networks _ @xcite , which use undirected graphs , and _ bayesian networks",
    "_ @xcite , which use directed acyclic graphs .    in principle",
    ", there are many possible choices for the joint distribution of @xmath4 , depending on the nature of the data .",
    "however , literature have focused mostly on two cases : the _ discrete case _",
    "@xcite , in which both @xmath4 and the @xmath6 are multinomial random variables , and the _ continuous case _",
    "@xcite , in which @xmath4 is multivariate normal and the @xmath6 are univariate normal random variables . in the former ,",
    "the parameters of interest are the _ conditional probabilities _ associated with each variable , usually represented as conditional probability tables ; in the latter , the parameters of interest are the _ partial correlation coefficients _ between each variable and its neighbours ( i.e. the adjacent nodes in @xmath7 ) .",
    "the estimation of the structure of the graph @xmath7 is called _ structure learning _",
    "@xcite , and involves determining the graph structure that encodes the conditional independencies present in the data . ideally it should coincide with the dependence structure of @xmath4 , or it should at least identify a distribution as close as possible to the correct one in the probability space .",
    "several algorithms have been presented in literature for this problem , thanks to the application of many results from probability , information and optimisation theory . despite differences in theoretical backgrounds and terminology ,",
    "they can all be grouped into only three classes : _ constraint - based algorithms _ , that are based on conditional independence tests ; _ score - based algorithms _ , that are based on goodness - of - fit scores ; and _ hybrid algorithms _ , that combine the previous two approaches .",
    "for some examples see bromberg et al .",

    "on the other hand , the development of techniques for assessing the statistical robustness of network structures learned from data ( e.g. the presence of artefacts arising from noisy data ) has been limited .",
    "structure learning algorithms are commonly studied measuring differences from the true ( known ) structure of a small number of reference data sets @xcite .",
    "the usefulness of such an approach in investigating networks learned from real - world data sets is limited , since the true structure of their probability distribution is unknown .",
    "a more systematic approach to model assessment , and in particular to the problem of identifying statistically significant features in a network , has been developed by friedman et al .",
    "@xcite using bootstrap resampling @xcite and model averaging @xcite .",
    "it can be summarised as follows :    1 .   for @xmath8",
    ": 1 .   sample a new data set @xmath9 from the original data @xmath4 using either parametric or nonparametric bootstrap ; 2 .   learn the structure of the graphical model @xmath10 from @xmath9 .",
    "2 .   estimate the probability that each possible edge @xmath11 , @xmath12 is present in the true network structure @xmath13 as @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the indicator function of the event @xmath16 ( i.e. , it is equal to @xmath17 if @xmath18 and @xmath19 otherwise ) .",
    "the empirical probabilities @xmath20 are known as _ edge intensities _ or _ arc strengths _ , and can be interpreted as the degree of _ confidence _ that @xmath11 is present in the network structure @xmath21 describing the true dependence structure of @xmath4 are in fact an estimator of the expected value of the @xmath22 random vector describing the presence of each possible edge in @xmath21 . as such",
    ", they do not sum to one and are dependent on one another in a nontrivial way . ] .",
    "however , they are difficult to evaluate , because the probability distribution of the networks @xmath23 in the space of the network structures is unknown . as a result",
    ", the value of the confidence threshold ( i.e. the minimum degree of confidence for an edge to be significant and therefore accepted as an edge of @xmath21 ) is an unknown function of both the data and the structure learning algorithm .",
    "this is a serious limitation in the identification of significant edges and has led to the use of ad - hoc , pre - defined thresholds in spite of the impact on model assessment evidenced by several studies @xcite .",
    "an exception is nagarajan et al .",
    "@xcite , whose approach will be discussed below .",
    "apart from this limitation , friedman s approach is very general and can be used in a wide range of settings .",
    "first of all , it can be applied to any kind of graphical model with only minor adjustments ( for example , accounting for the direction of the edges in bayesian networks , see sec .",
    "[ sec : geneprof ] ) .",
    "no distributional assumption on the data is required in addition to the ones needed by the structure learning algorithm .",
    "no assumption is made on the latter , either , so any score - based , constraint - based or hybrid algorithm can be used .",
    "furthermore , parallel computing can easily be used to offset the additional computational complexity introduced by model averaging , because bootstrap is embarrassingly parallel .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a statistically - motivated estimator for the confidence threshold minimising the @xmath24 norm between the cumulative distribution function of the observed confidence levels and the cumulative distribution function of the confidence levels of the unknown network @xmath21 .",
    "subsequently , we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach by re - investigating two experimental data sets from nagarajan et al .",
    "@xcite and sachs et al .",
    "consider the empirical probabilities @xmath20 defined in eq .",
    "[ eq : bootconf ] , and denote them with @xmath25 . for a graph with @xmath26 nodes , @xmath27 .",
    "furthermore , consider the order statistic @xmath28 derived from @xmath29 .",
    "it is intuitively clear that the first elements of @xmath30 are more likely to be associated with non - significant edges , and that the last elements of @xmath30 are more likely to be associated with significant edges .",
    "the ideal configuration @xmath31 of @xmath30 would be @xmath32 that is the set of probabilities that characterises any edge as either significant or non - significant without any uncertainty .",
    "in other words , @xmath33 such a configuration arises from the limit case in which all the networks @xmath23 have exactly the same structure .",
    "this may happen in practise with a consistent structure learning algorithm when the sample size is large @xcite .",
    "a useful characterisation of @xmath30 and @xmath31 can be obtained through the empirical cumulative distribution functions of the respective elements , @xmath34 and @xmath35 in particular , @xmath36 corresponds to the fraction of elements of @xmath31 equal to zero and is a measure of the fraction of non - significant edges . at the same time",
    ", @xmath36 provides a threshold for separating the elements of @xmath31 , namely @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the _ quantile function _ @xcite .    more importantly , estimating @xmath36 from data provides a statistically motivated threshold for separating significant edges from non - significant ones . in practise",
    ", this amounts to approximating the ideal , asymptotic empirical cumulative distribution function @xmath39 with its finite sample estimate @xmath40 .",
    "such an approximation can be computed in many different ways , depending on the norm used to measure the distance between @xmath40 and @xmath39 as a function of @xmath36 .",
    "common choices are the @xmath41 family of norms @xcite , which includes the euclidean norm , and csiszar s @xmath42-divergences @xcite , which include kullback - leibler divergence .",

    "[ fig : ecdf ] .",

    "a simple example is illustrated below .",

    "the @xmath0 norm takes the form @xmath66 and is minimised for @xmath67 .",
    "therefore , an edge is deemed significant if its confidence is strictly greater than @xmath68 , or , equivalently , if it has confidence of at least @xmath69 ; only @xmath57 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 satisfy this condition .",
    "we tested the proposed approach on synthetic data sets using three established performance measures : _ sensitivity _ , _ specificity _ and _ accuracy_. _ sensitivity _ is given by the proportion of edges of the true network structure that have been correctly identified as significant .",

    "iamb was used to learn the markov blanket of each node as a preliminary step to reduce the number of its candidate parents and children ; a network structure satisfying these constraints is then identified as in the grow - shrink algorithm @xcite .",
    "conditional independence tests were performed using a shrinkage mutual information test @xcite with @xmath91 .",
    "such a test , unlike the more common asymptotic @xmath92 mutual information test , is valid and has been shown to work reliably even on small samples .",

    "we estimated the confidence threshold @xmath52 , and identified significant and non - significant edges in the network .",
    "note that the direction of the edges present in the network structure is effectively ignored , because the proposed approach focuses only those edges presence .",

    "when @xmath98 is at least @xmath102 ( i.e. @xmath17 observation every @xmath103 parameters ) , hc successfully recovers from about @xmath104 ( for alarm and insurance ) to @xmath105 ( for hailfinder ) of the true network structure .",

    "this difference in performance can be attributed to the sparsity - inducing effect of shrinkage tests @xcite , which increase specificity at the cost of sensitivity . for values of @xmath98 greater than @xmath17 ( i.e. more observations than parameters ) the increase in sensitivity slows down for all combinations of networks and algorithms , reaching a plateau .",

    "in addition , its variability does not appear to decrease as @xmath98 grows .",
    "this suggests that the optimal @xmath52 depends strongly on the specific sample used in the estimation of the confidence values @xmath29 , even for relatively large samples .",

    "these results are in sharp contrast with ad - hoc thresholds commonly found in literature , which are usually large ( e.g. 0.8 in * ? ? ?",
    "a large threshold can certainly be useful in excluding noisy edges , which may result from artefacts at the measurement and dynamical levels and from finite sample - size effects .",

    "]    on a related note , false negatives across ad - hoc thresholds may also be attributed to the fact that edges are considered as separate , independent entities as far the choice of the threshold is concerned ",
    "i.e. a @xmath118 threshold is expected to identify as significant about @xmath17 in @xmath71 edges in the network . however , in a biological setting the structure of the network is an abstraction for the underlying functional mechanisms ; as an example , consider the signalling pathways in a transcriptional network .",
    "in such a context , edges are clearly not independent , but appear in concert along signalling pathways .",
    "this interdependence is accounted for in the proposed approach ( that is based on the full set @xmath119 of estimated condence values ) , but it is not commonly considered in choosing ad - hoc thresholds . for instance , edges appearing with individual confidence values far below the @xmath120 $ ] range may not necessarily be identified as significant by an ad - hoc threshold . however , the proposed approach recognises their interplay and correctly identifies them as significant .",
    "this aspect , along with the strong dependence between the optimal @xmath52 and the actual sample the network is learned from , may discourage the use of an a priori or ad - hoc confidence threshold in favour of more statistically - motivated alternatives .",

    "in contrast to @xcite , using imoto et al .",
    "@xcite approach in conjunction with the proposed thresholding method we were able to identify the directions of the edges in the network .",
    "the directions correlated with the functional relationships documented in literature ( tab . 3",
    ", @xcite , supplementary information ) as well as with the directions of the edges in the network learned from both perturbed and unperturbed data ( fig .",

    "graphical models and network abstractions have enjoyed considerable attention across the biological and medical communities .",
    "such abstractions are especially useful in deciphering the interactions between the entities of interest from high - throughput observational data .",
    "classical techniques for identifying significant edges in the resulting graph rely on ad - hoc thresholding of the edge confidence estimated from across multiple independent realisations of networks learned from the given data .",
    "large ad - hoc threshold values are particularly common , and are chosen in an effort to minimise noisy edges in the resulting network . while useful in minimising false positives , such a choice can accentuate false negatives with pronounced effect on the network topology .",
    "the present study overcomes this caveat by proposing a more straightforward and statistically - motivated approach for identifying significant edges in a graphical model .",
    "the proposed estimator minimises the @xmath24 norm between the cumulative distribution function of the observed confidence levels and the cumulative distribution function of their asymptotic , ideal configuration .",
    "the effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated on three synthetic data sets @xcite and on gene expression data sets across two different studies @xcite .",
    "however , the approach is defined in a more general setting and can be applied to many classes of graphical models learned from any kind of data .",
