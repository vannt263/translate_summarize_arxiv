    "the increased activity measured at radio , optical , ultraviolet and x - ray frequencies in the days following the @xmath0ray outburst strengthens the identification of pks  1454 - 354 as a high - energy @xmath0ray source .",
    "the analysis of the sed and some order - of - magnitude calculations suggest that pks  1454 - 354 is a typical fsrq , although the large measurement errors hampered our capability to put tight constraints on the origin of the x - ray emission : the soft x - ray spectrum can be explained either in terms of ssc or of a corona above the accretion disk , while the high - energy peak is likely to be due to external compton processes .",

    "further , more precise multiwavelength observations of pks  1454 - 354 and , specifically , a spectral coverage at sub - mm , ir and optical frequencies , where the synchrotron peak is expected , will shed further light on the modeling of this source , allowing a more precise correlation between the synchrotron and @xmath232-ray inverse - compton peak in quiet and flaring states , clarifying the astrophysical mechanisms at work in this source .    the _ fermi_/lat collaboration acknowledges generous ongoing support from a number of agencies and institutes that have supported both the development and the operation of the lat as well as scientific data analysis .",
