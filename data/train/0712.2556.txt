    "in x - ray science , cross sections for x - ray absorption in matter are typically assumed to be invariants , depending only on the atomic composition of the material @xcite .",
    "however , by utilizing electromagnetic fields , it is possible to modify x - ray absorption cross sections in a controlled way .",
    "wuilleumier and meyer @xcite review combined laser / x - ray experiments performed at laser intensities that are small in comparison to an atomic unit ( @xmath0  w/@xmath1 ) , so that the laser  matter interaction may be described perturbatively .",
    "as discussed in reference  @xcite , at laser intensities above @xmath2  w/@xmath1 , interesting processes such as tunnel ionization @xcite and molecular alignment @xcite can occur . in the following ,",
    "we discuss three different scenarios for modifying x - ray absorption near an inner - shell edge .",
    "strong - field ionization at @xmath3  w/@xmath1 is the topic of section  [ sec2 ] . in section  [ sec3 ] , laser dressing at @xmath4  w/@xmath1",
    "is discussed .",
    "section  [ sec4 ] presents results of a recent joint theoretical and experimental study on x - ray absorption by laser - aligned molecules ( @xmath5  w/@xmath1 ) . for the purpose of this paper ,",
    "the x - ray regime is defined by photon energies that are sufficient to produce , via photoabsorption , inner - shell vacancies in atoms such as carbon or heavier .",
    "this definition includes both soft @xcite and hard @xcite x rays .",
    "we concentrate on a laser wavelength of @xmath6  nm . in this paper ,",
    "the laser and x - ray fields are assumed to be linearly polarized and co - propagating .",
    "reference @xcite develops an x - ray microprobe methodology that allows one to study strong - field ionized atoms or molecules using x - ray absorption spectroscopy .",
    "x rays are focused within the focal volume of a strong optical field such that the x - ray focal width is much smaller ( by a factor of @xmath7 in reference  @xcite ) than the laser focal width .",
    "x - ray absorption is monitored by measuring the x - ray fluorescence resulting from inner - shell hole formation within an interval along the laser propagation axis that is short in comparison with the rayleigh range @xcite . thus , the x - ray microprobe methodology reduces averaging effects over the spatial intensity distribution of the laser field .",
    "the species first studied in the strong - field experiments carried out at argonne s advanced photon source was krypton @xcite .",
    "experimental near-_k_-edge absorption spectra of strong - field ionized kr .",
    "data are shown for both parallel and perpendicular laser and x - ray polarizations .",
    "also depicted is the background contribution from neutral kr . ]",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows the kr _ k_@xmath8 fluorescence signal from krypton gas in a gas cell ( number density @xmath9  @xmath10 ) as a function of the energy of the absorbed x - ray photon .",
    "the signal was measured @xmath11  ns after a @xmath12-fs , @xmath13-w/@xmath1 laser pulse ionized the kr atoms .",
    "the full diamonds / red lines show the fluorescence signal for laser polarization parallel to the x - ray polarization ; the open circles / blue lines refer to perpendicular polarization directions . for the case shown , the majority of atoms are ionized .",
    "there are two prominent features in the spectrum resulting from kr@xmath14 @xmath15 and @xmath16 excitations .",
    "the contribution of fluorescence from neutral atoms in the interaction region is indicated by the green line .",
    "the ratio of ions to neutrals is about @xmath17 .",
    "it may be concluded from the spectrum shown that there is very little kr@xmath18 present , because the well - separated kr@xmath18 @xmath19 excitation line seen at higher laser intensities in reference @xcite is hardly noticeable here .",
    "there are two interesting observations we would like to point out .",
    "first , strong - field ionization modifies the structure observed in the near - edge absorption spectrum quite dramatically .",
    "for instance , when kr spectra are measured in the absence of the laser , there is very little absorption at an x - ray photon energy of @xmath20  kev . in the presence of the laser",
    ", there appears at this photon energy the strong kr@xmath14 @xmath21 absorption resonance seen in figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "( see reference  @xcite for a similar observation made in potassium . )",
    "the effect is very pronounced , but the disadvantage of this form of strong - field control of x - ray absorption is that it is not rapidly reversible : one has to wait until the laser - produced plasma has expanded @xcite and neutral atoms have filled the original plasma volume .",
    "the second observation is that the kr@xmath14 @xmath22 resonance displays a strong dependence on the relative polarization of laser and x rays . the resonant x - ray absorption cross section for parallel polarizations is two times larger than in the perpendicular case .",
    "the observed linear dichroism provides information on the alignment of the @xmath23 hole orbital produced by the strong laser pulse @xcite .",
    "the hole orbital is aligned along the laser polarization axis , which defines the quantization axis . as shown in references  @xcite , in order to understand the observations , it is necessary to take into account the effect of spin - orbit coupling .",
    "nonrelativistic tunneling or multiphoton ionization models strongly overestimate the degree of ion alignment . according to adiabatic strong - field ionization calculations that include spin - orbit coupling @xcite ,",
    "there is hardly any mixing between the @xmath24 and @xmath25 orbitals at the electric - field strength at which kr ionizes . in other words ,",
    "the laser field is not strong enough to break spin - orbit coupling .",
    "the same is true in the case of strong - field ionization of xe @xcite .",
    "therefore , if there are coherences in the density matrix of kr@xmath14 or xe@xmath14 , they are not caused by the strength of the laser electric field .",
    "llll & @xmath26  ( @xmath27 ) & @xmath28  ( @xmath27 ) & @xmath29  ( @xmath27 ) + experimental & @xmath30 & @xmath31 & @xmath32 + theoretical & @xmath33 & @xmath34 & @xmath35 +    in reference @xcite it was demonstrated for xe that inner - shell absorption spectra of laser - produced ions may be used to determine the quantum state populations @xmath36 , i.e. , the probability to find an ion with a hole in the @xmath37 orbital with projection quantum number @xmath38 ( @xmath39 is the principal quantum number of the valence shell ) . in table",
    "[ tab1 ] , we present the results of such an analysis for kr .",
    "the analysis is based on the fact that using standard angular momentum algebra , it may be shown for the @xmath21 transition in kr@xmath14 that the x - ray absorption cross sections for parallel ( @xmath40 ) and perpendicular ( @xmath41 ) polarizations are given by @xmath42 @xmath43 using _ ab initio _",
    "values for the @xmath44-averaged cross sections @xmath45 ( @xmath46 ) and @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) @xcite , equations  ( [ eq4 ] ) and ( [ eq5 ] ) may be fitted to the experimental data to determine the @xmath36 . as may be seen in table  [ tab1 ] , the adiabatic strong - field ionization model we use @xcite reproduces the general trend displayed by the experimental quantum state populations .",
    "we now turn our attention to x - ray absorption by noble - gas atoms in a laser field of intensity @xmath4",
    "w/@xmath1 or lower @xcite . in this regime ,",
    "both inner - shell and valence electrons in the electronic ground state remain essentially unperturbed ( this applies particularly to light atomic species such as neon ) .",
    "the primary effect of the laser field on x - ray absorption is to modify ( `` dress '' ) the inner - shell - excited electronic states in the vicinity of an inner - shell edge . therefore , this laser - dressing approach to strong - field control of x - ray absorption is reversible and leaves the target intact .",
    "we assume in this section that the laser and x - ray polarizations are parallel .",
    "the reason why high intensities are required in order to observe laser - dressing effects in the x - ray absorption spectrum is easy to understand .",
    "the rabi frequencies associated with laser coupling of the inner - shell - excited states must be larger than the decay widths of these states .",
    "inner - shell - excited atoms , which relax via auger decay and/or x - ray fluorescence , decay at least a thousand times faster than valence - excited atoms .",
    "thus , since the dipole coupling matrix elements between rydberg levels are similar in the valence- and inner - shell - excited cases , the laser intensity must be at least @xmath49 times higher than what is needed when all electromagnetic fields involved are in the optical regime .",

    "an _ ab initio _ theory for calculating the x - ray absorption spectrum of an atom exposed to an intense laser field is developed in ref .",
    "the method utilizes the hartree - fock - slater approximation @xcite to describe the electronic structure of the unperturbed atom .",
    "the coupling to the laser is treated nonperturbatively within the strong - field ( floquet @xcite ) limit of nonrelativistic quantum electrodynamics .",
    "the laser - dressed , inner - shell - excited states are calculated by diagonalizing a non - hermitian hamiltonian matrix .",
    "the x - ray - induced transition from the atomic ground state to the laser - dressed , inner - shell - excited states is treated using perturbation theory . at a laser intensity of @xmath4  w/@xmath1 , the application of this theory to kr near the _ k _ edge at @xmath50  kev demonstrates a @xmath51 suppression of x - ray absorption at the @xmath16 transition @xcite .",
    "the suppression is mainly due to laser coupling of @xmath52 to @xmath53 and @xmath54 . in view of the @xmath55-ev decay width of _ k_-shell - excited",
    "kr @xcite , the laser intensity it would take to induce a much stronger modification of the near-_k_-edge structure of kr is so high that kr in its ground state would be strong - field - ionized ( cf .",
    "section [ sec2 ] ) .    in neon ,",
    "the laser - dressing effect is much more dramatic @xcite .",
    "this is because the decay width of _ k_-shell - excited ne @xcite is smaller than in kr by a factor of @xmath7 .",
    "the laser intensity dependence of the x - ray absorption cross section of ne at the prominent @xmath56 transition ( @xmath57 ev ) is displayed in figure  [ fig2 ] .",
    "laser dressing at an intensity of @xmath4  w/@xmath1 is found to suppress x - ray absorption at the @xmath56 resonance by a factor of @xmath58 .",
    "this suppression of x - ray absorption is a manifestation of electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) @xcite . to describe eit one usually considers three eigenstates of the atom under consideration .",
    "to a first approximation in our case , these states are the ne ground state ( level @xmath59 ) , the excited state of ne with a _ k_-shell hole and an electron in the @xmath60 orbital ( level @xmath61 ) , and the excited state of ne with a _ k_-shell hole and an electron in the @xmath62 orbital ( level @xmath63 ) .",
    "the laser creates a coherent superposition of levels @xmath61 and @xmath63 , so - called dressed states . at the x - ray photon energy corresponding to the laser - unperturbed @xmath64 transition",
    ", the transition pathways from level @xmath59 to the two dressed states interfere destructively .",
    "hence , over a narrow x - ray energy range of @xmath65  mev , absorption of the x rays is suppressed at the photon energy corresponding to the transition from level @xmath59 to level @xmath61 .",
    "because of the high laser intensity required for eit in the x - ray domain , the three - level model provides at best a qualitatively correct picture .",
    "for instance , at @xmath4  w/@xmath1 , the laser ionizes the rydberg electron at a rate that is comparable to the auger decay rate of the _ k_-shell hole ,",
    "i.e. , there is strong laser coupling to states outside the three - level model space .",
    "the ability to control x - ray absorption in ne at the @xmath56 resonance using a strong laser field allows one to imprint pulse shapes of the optical dressing laser onto the x rays .",
    "the idea is illustrated in figure  [ fig3 ] . using a @xmath61-mm long gas cell filled with one atmosphere of neon , an x - ray pulse at the @xmath56",
    "resonance energy is practically completely absorbed in the gas cell @xcite .",
    "the typical duration of an x - ray pulse from a third - generation synchrotron is @xmath65  ps .",
    "such an x - ray pulse may be overlapped in time and space with one or several ultrashort , intense laser pulses .",
    "those portions of the x - ray pulse that overlap with the laser are transmitted through the gas cell . in the case shown in figure",
    "[ fig3 ] , where the two dressing laser pulses have a peak intensity of @xmath4  w/@xmath1 , the intensity of the two transmitted x - ray pulses is about @xmath66 of the incoming x - ray intensity .",
    "the time delay between the two x - ray pulses can be controlled by changing the time delay between the two laser pulses , opening a route to ultrafast all x - ray pump - probe experiments . with an analogous strategy , controlled shaping of short - wavelength pulses",
    "might become a reality .",
    "a disadvantage of the method is that it is applicable only at certain x - ray energies .",
    "the schemes discussed in sections  [ sec2 ] and [ sec3 ] rely on modifying the system s electronic structure . in the following ,",
    "we present a third scheme for controlling resonant x - ray absorption that is conceptually somewhat different . to motivate this scheme , recall from section  [ sec2 ] that kr@xmath14 ions produced in a strong laser field are aligned along the laser polarization axis .",
    "kr@xmath14 ions and br atoms are isoelectronic and have essentially the same electronic structure .",
    "in contrast to kr@xmath14 , br forms many molecules . if the open @xmath23 shell of br is not filled upon molecule formation , and if the effective @xmath23 hole orbital is aligned with respect to the molecular frame , then the hole orbital may be aligned in space by aligning the molecule .",

    "a mulliken population analysis @xcite we have performed on the hartree - fock ground - state wave function of cf@xmath67br indicates that the carbon atom carries a partial charge of @xmath68 , whereas the partial charge on each of the three fluorine atoms is @xmath69 .",
    "the br atom acquires essentially no charge ( partial charge of @xmath70 ) .",
    "it may therefore be expected that the br hole orbital remains at least partially unoccupied in cf@xmath67br .",

    "the highest occupied molecular orbital of cf@xmath67br is a doubly degenerate @xmath74 orbital corresponding to br @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",

    "only when the x - ray polarization vector has a component along the c - br axis can x - ray absorption at the br @xmath86 resonance take place .",
    "estimates show that the intramolecular electric field in cf@xmath67br breaks spin - orbit coupling in br , so that in contrast to the situation we discussed in connection with kr@xmath14 , spin - orbit coupling may be neglected .    the polarization dependence of resonant x - ray absorption by aligned molecules was demonstrated in studies on surface - adsorbed molecules @xcite and fixed - in - space molecules @xcite .",

    "as explained in reference  @xcite and references therein , small molecules with an anisotropic polarizability may be aligned along the laser polarization axis at laser intensities in the range @xmath87 to @xmath5  w/@xmath1 .",
    "the physics underlying laser - induced molecular alignment is easy to understand : the instantaneous laser electric field polarizes the molecule .",
    "the electric dipole moment induced depends on the molecular polarizability tensor and the laser electric field vector with respect to the molecular frame .",
    "the interaction of the induced dipole moment with the laser electric field leads to an effective potential for the rotational degrees of freedom of the molecule .",
    "the effective laser - induced potential is proportional to the cycle - averaged laser intensity .",
    "the potential - energy minimum is reached when the most polarizable molecular axis is parallel to the laser polarization axis . in the case of a symmetric rotor , the molecule - specific quantity that characterizes",
    "the effective potential is @xmath88 , which is the difference between the polarizability component of the molecule along the molecular symmetry axis and the polarizability component perpendicular to the molecular symmetry axis .",
    "an assumption typically made is that the laser photon energy is far too low to electronically excite the molecule via a one - photon transition .",
    "consequently , it is permissible to use the _ static _ polarizability components obtained in the limit of infinite wavelength .",
    "we calculated @xmath89 using coupled - cluster linear response theory @xcite and found that for cf@xmath67br the difference between @xmath89 determined in the static limit and @xmath89 determined at @xmath6  nm is indeed only about @xmath90 .",
    "for the purpose of minimizing temporal averaging effects , it is important that the duration of the molecular alignment is not substantially shorter than the x - ray pulse duration of @xmath65  ps .",
    "this means that the impulsive alignment technique @xcite , where alignment persists for only a few ps , is unsuitable . in the adiabatic regime @xcite , where the laser intensity envelope changes slowly on the characteristic rotational time scale of the molecule ,",
    "the alignment persists for as long as the laser pulse is on .",

    "( this is the characteristic time for rotation about an axis perpendicular to the c - br axis . ) in order to obtain a high laser repetition rate ( @xmath59  khz ) , the laser pulse energies were limited to about @xmath61  mj with a pulse duration of @xmath92  ps .",
    "even though this is somewhat shorter than the rotational period , we find in our calculations , which are similar to the ones reported in reference  @xcite , that at temperatures of several k or higher , the molecular response to the laser pulse is essentially adiabatic and tracks the laser pulse envelope .",

    "_ k_@xmath8 fluorescence was used to monitor @xmath77-hole formation in br .",
    "the br near-_k_-edge absorption spectrum was measured and the @xmath86 resonance at @xmath94  kev was identified .",
    "the experimental data plotted in figure  [ fig5 ] were obtained on resonance , after subtraction of a @xmath95 background from inner - shell - excited rydberg and continuum states that overlap with the resonance . the primary experimental difference from the atomic kr experiment is that a supersonic expansion of @xmath96 cf@xmath67br seeded in he was used to produce a cold jet of molecules . by applying a high backing pressure to the nozzle through which the gas mixture expands , a low rotational temperature may be achieved .",
    "this is crucial for alignment in the adiabatic regime @xcite . in the experiment at the advanced photon source ,",
    "a backing pressure of up to @xmath97 bar was applied , which by comparison with reference  @xcite suggests a rotational temperature of the order of @xmath7  k.    the central quantities we calculate for comparison with experiment are on - resonance absorption cross sections for parallel laser and x - ray polarizations ( @xmath98 ) ; perpendicular laser and x - ray polarizations ( @xmath99 ) ; and a laser - free thermal ensemble ( @xmath100 ) .",
