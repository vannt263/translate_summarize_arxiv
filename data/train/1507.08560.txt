    "long - baseline experimental searches of neutrino oscillations largely rely on the capability of pinning down the energy dependence of the oscillation probability , which is a nontrivial function of the _ true _ neutrino energy , @xmath2 . as a consequence ,",
    "the procedure employed to reconstruct the unknown incoming - neutrino energy from the measured kinematics of the interaction products is a central element of the oscillation analysis .",
    "experiments using neutrino beams peaked at @xmath3800 mev , such as t2k  @xcite and miniboone  @xcite , determine the energy distribution of charged - current ( cc ) events from the kinematics of the outgoing charged lepton ",
    "i.e . , its kinetic energy and emission angle  measured by large cherenkov detectors filled with water or mineral oil .",
    "this technique is mostly applied to quasielastic ( qe ) events  identified by the absence of pions in the final state  that provide the dominant contribution to the total cross section at these energies .",
    "however , it necessarily involves hypotheses on the reaction mechanism .",
    "the kinematic method of energy reconstruction is based on the assumptions that the beam particle interacts with a single nucleon at rest , bound with constant energy , and that no other nucleons are knocked out from the nucleus .",
    "it has been long known , however , that processes involving two - nucleon currents , final - state interactions , and nucleon - nucleon correlations give rise to the appearance of more complex final states , featuring more than one nucleon excited to the continuum .",
    "reconstruction of the neutrino energy of such events , dubbed qe - like in the mesonless case  @xcite , in general requires more complex methods , involving realistic models of nuclear dynamics .    at energies well above 1 gev , the contribution of inelastic processes  resonant pion production and deep - inelastic scattering ( dis)becomes larger and eventually dominant . as a consequence ,",
    "determination of the neutrino energy in this kinematic region requires reconstruction of events with many hadrons in the final state .    as alternative",
    "to cherenkov detectors in this regime , calorimeters measuring the visible energy associated with each event  i.e . , the energy deposited by the final - state particles  have been proposed as effective devices , allowing for an accurate neutrino - energy reconstruction .",
    "calorimeters are presently being used in the minos  @xcite and no@xmath4a  @xcite experiments . in their detectors ,",
    "the total energy deposited by all reaction products is measured without a prior reconstruction of each final - state particle s track , momentum , or energy .",
    "the energy response for potentially complex final states is calibrated using test - beam exposures .",
    "on the other hand , future appearance experiments like dune  @xcite are expected to employ detectors capable of fine - grained tracking of a large number of interaction products . in their case ,",
    "the tracking capability is the key to being able to select electron - neutrino events and distinguish them from backgrounds , even for non - qe events .    in this article",
    ", we compare the kinematic and calorimetric reconstruction methods in the oscillation analysis of a @xmath5 disappearance experiment .",
    "we also aim to explore the capabilities and limitations of a calorimetric analysis based on individually identified particle tracks and to determine what level of understanding of detector response and underlying events is required to meet certain physics goals .    for a muon - neutrino event ,",
    "it is clear that the long muon track in itself is a clear signature , and no tracking beyond the leading muon is required for backgrounds removal .",
    "however , we study the @xmath5 disappearance channel because of its simplicity in terms of oscillation physics , and as a sandbox to develop suitable analysis tools .",
    "the calorimetric technique , as defined above , obviously rests on the ability of fully reconstructing the final state , which largely depends on the detector design and performance .",
    "nuclear effects also play a role , as they may lead to a sizeable amount of _ missing _ energy , hindering the reconstruction of @xmath2 .",
    "for example , if a pion produced at the elementary interaction vertex is absorbed in the spectator system , in general , its energy is not deposited in the calorimeter .",
    "we consider an idealized setting , in which the near and far detectors are functionally identical , and a simple extrapolation between them can be performed  @xcite .",
    "to minimize the uncertainty arising from nuclear interactions , the target nucleus selected for both detectors is carbon , the cross section of which has been extensively measured in a number of different channels  @xcite .",
    "the analyzed events are generated using the simulation code genie  @xcite supplemented with the @xmath6 package of additional modules  @xcite , allowing us to describe the carbon ground state using the realistic spectral function  @xcite .    to cover different experimental configurations , we consider two options : a low - energy ( le ) setup , with a narrow - band off - axis beam , and a high - energy ( he ) setup , featuring a broadband on - axis beam . in the le option ,",
    "the neutrino flux is peaked around 600 mev , and the distance to the far detector is set to @xmath7 km , while in the he option , the flux is peaked at @xmath812 gev and @xmath9 km .",
    "event reconstruction is carried out assuming :    1 .   a _ perfect _ scenario , in which all produced particles are detected and their true energies are measured , 2 .",
    "a _ realistic _ one , in which detection efficiencies and thresholds are taken into account and the finite detector resolution leads to a smearing of the measured energies .    in both cases ,",
    "neutrons are assumed to escape detection altogether .",
    "a key element of our analysis is the migration matrices , the elements of which , @xmath10 , correspond to the probability that an event with a true neutrino energy in the @xmath11th bin ends up being reconstructed in an energy bin  @xmath12 .",
    "the event distribution representing the data is in each case generated using the realistic scenario .",
    "fitted rates , on the other hand , are obtained using a linear combination of migration matrices corresponding to the perfect and realistic scenarios .",

    ".   leads to the neutrino energy in the form @xmath34 note that while for mesons the total energies enter the sum , for nucleons only the kinetic energies contribute .",
    "this difference is a consequence of the fact that mesons are produced in the interaction process , whereas nucleons are only knocked out from the target nucleus .    assuming that multinucleon effects do not introduce strong energy dependence to the cross sections , the factor @xmath35 can be treated as a constant at neutrino energies above several hundred mev .",
    "then , reconstruction of the neutrino energy reduces to determining the energies of the particles in the final state  @xcite , @xmath36    this , so - called , calorimetric method can , in principle , be applied to any type of cc interaction .",
    "however , one needs to keep in mind that an accurate reconstruction of hadrons poses a formidable experimental challenge .",

    "an application of the above formulas requires ( i ) neglecting the unmeasured recoil momentum @xmath46 and ( ii ) approximating the energy of the residual nuclear system by a constant , which amounts to setting @xmath47 in eq .   and @xmath48 in eq .  .",
    "these simplifications lead to the expressions @xmath49 and @xmath50    owing to difficulties with an accurate determination of the invariant hadronic mass , the use of eq .",

    "however , as this method assumes specific final states , its accuracy is spoiled by any undetected hadron .",
    "for example , when a produced pion is absorbed or undetected , the energy reconstructed from eq .   under the qe hypothesis is typically lower than the true one by @xmath8300350 mev ; see figs .  6 and 7 of ref .",

    "equation   multiplied by a factor @xmath54 , @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath57 , shows that @xmath2 can be determined from the projections of the final momenta on the beam direction . neglecting the contribution of the recoil momentum ,",
    "one obtains the expression @xmath58 a special case of which has been employed in an analysis of single - nucleon knockout events by the nomad collaboration  @xcite .    performing the kinematic energy reconstruction in this article ,",

    "therefore , neutrinos are not monoenergetic , and  for a given event  the incident neutrino energy has to be reconstructed from the kinematics of the particles in the final state .",
    "systematic uncertainties of this procedure inevitably depend on the capabilities of the employed detector , as well as on the neutrino interaction channel , owing to the different detection efficiencies for the particles involved in the event .",

    "we use  although in a simplistic way  the information on that the charged lepton s kinematics also for non - qe events .",
    "we find that the kinematic reconstruction is very robust with respect to detector effects , largely because muons are the most precisely reconstructed particles in modern neutrino detectors . on the other hand ,",

    "the employed detection capabilities are not meant to represent any existing detector , but are indicative of the general level of performance which can be expected . while to translate these result into a specific experiment a detailed study of detector response  beyond the scope of this work  would be required , many of the analysis techniques developed here should turn out to be very useful .",
    "interestingly , we find that the kinematic reconstruction performs well even for pion - production events , but the independence of this observation from the underlying nuclear model is to be examined .",
    "we limit our study to the @xmath5 disappearance channel since this can be effectively treated as a two - flavor oscillation . as a consequence , the effects of energy resolution and misreconstruction",
    "are directly related to the precision of the @xmath149 determination and a shift of the value of @xmath149 , respectively .",
    "we use a phenomenological parametrization to interpolate between a perfect and realistic detector .",
    "this allows us to conclude that , overall , the detector response  in terms of efficiencies , resolutions , and thresholds for individual particles  has to be understood at a 10% level or better , to avoid a significant bias in the measurement of @xmath149 . for the kinematic analysis ,",
    "these requirements are much less stringent , but uncertainties of the nuclear model  not considered here  present a challenge , as shown previously in the literature .    in summary ,",
    "while the calorimetric reconstruction may be less sensitive to the underlying nuclear model , it is strongly affected by detector effects , typically leading to energy underestimation . on the other hand ,",
    "the kinematic method of neutrino energy reconstruction is much less challenging for the detector design , but it strongly relies on an accurate understanding of neutrino - nucleus interactions .",
    "one needs to keep in mind that the quantitative details of our conclusions may be specific to this work , owing to the underlying detector assumptions .",
    "however , their qualitative aspects can be expected to hold for a variety of experiments .    as a final remark ,",

    "<S> to be able to achieve their physics goals , future neutrino - oscillation experiments will need to reconstruct the neutrino energy with very high accuracy . in this work , </S>",
    "<S> we analyze how the energy reconstruction may be affected by realistic detection capabilities , such as energy resolutions , efficiencies , and thresholds . </S>",
    "<S> this allows us to estimate how well the detector performance needs to be determined _ a priori _ in order to avoid a sizable bias in the measurement of the relevant oscillation parameters . </S>",
    "<S> we compare the kinematic and calorimetric methods of energy reconstruction in the context of two @xmath0 disappearance experiments operating in different energy regimes . for the calorimetric reconstruction method </S>",
    "<S> , we find that the detector performance has to be estimated with an @xmath1 accuracy to avoid a significant bias in the extracted oscillation parameters . on the other hand , in the case of kinematic energy reconstruction , we observe that the results exhibit less sensitivity to an overestimation of the detector capabilities . </S>"
