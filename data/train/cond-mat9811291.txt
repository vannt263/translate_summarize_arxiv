    "the situation is different for thermally exited quasiparticles which are responsible for losses at frequencies below the pair breaking threshold .",
    "these quasiparticles behave very much like quasiparticles in the normal state once the change in the density of states and the resulting change in thermal occupation of quasiparticle states are taken into account.@xcite hence one must expect to see nonlocal effects in the surface resistance of superconductors when @xmath7 . at finite frequencies",
    "the quasiparticles contribute to the screening currents so that there are some nonlocal corrections to the penetration depth of microwave fields as well .",
    "high-@xmath8 materials are highly anisotropic . they can be viewed as stacks of weakly coupled conducting planes . in this paper",
    "we shall only consider the in - plane conductivity because it is only this component of the conductivity tensor which can be expected to show nonlocal effects .",
    "the in - plane coherence length typically is between 10  and 20  while the in - plane penetration depth is two orders of magnitude larger , so that high-@xmath8 superconductors are well into the london limit @xcite , @xmath9 . while the quasiparticle in - plane mean free path @xmath2 is comparable to @xmath10 near the transition temperature @xmath8 , so that the corresponding scattering rate @xmath11 is of the order of @xmath8 , it is now generally accepted that @xmath2 increases substantially below @xmath8 .",
    "@xcite in high quality single crystals , the disorder induced mean free path @xmath12 can exceed the london penetration depth by quite a wide margin .",
    "@xcite in contrast to the normal state where a single parameter suffices to characterize the elastic scattering , both the concentration of scattering centers and the strength of the individual scatterer or , alternatively , the normal state elastic scattering rate @xmath13 and the scattering phase shifts have to be specified in the case of superconductors with unconventional@xcite order parameters .",
    "we shall show below for the case of @xmath14-wave scattering that the scattering phase shift @xmath3 plays a very important role .",
    "it has been pointed out by chang and scalapino @xcite that nonlocal effects are absent when the conducting planes are parallel to the surface exposed to the microwave radiation ( @xmath15-axis orientation ) because the spatial variation of the fields parallel to the surface occurs on length scales much larger than the penetration depth .",
    "thus , for strictly 2d quasiparticle motion , the scalar product @xmath16 vanishes .",
    "zuccaro _ _ et al.__@xcite argued that , at least for yba@xmath17cu@xmath18o@xmath19 ( ybco ) , coherent coupling between planes is not negligible so that there exists a finite component @xmath20 of the fermi velocity parallel to the surface normal . assuming an isotropic gap , these authors calculated the nonlocal corrections to the surface impedance for parameters such that @xmath9 .",
    "these calculations show the expected increase in the surface resistance in the anomalous skin effect regime @xmath21 resulting from the direct absorption of photons by quasiparticles in an energy- and momentum - conserving process .",
    "_ et al.__@xcite also invoked finite dispersion perpendicular to the planes to argue that nonlocal effects prevent the observation of the nonlinear meiner effect predicted by yip and sauls .",
    "@xcite while this assumption of a 3d tight - binding fermi surface appears quite reasonable for ybco , one nevertheless expects @xmath22 .",
    "nonlocal effects will , therefore , be less significant for @xmath15-axis oriented samples than for samples whose surfaces contain the @xmath15-axis , like @xmath23-axis oriented films or thin needles of single crystals with the @xmath15-axis being the longest dimensions . setting aside the problem of preparing high - quality @xmath23-axis oriented films ,",
    "microwave measurements of the surface impedance of such films are not well suited to a search for nonlocal effects because the typical current and field distributions @xcite involve two vastly different components of the conductivity tensor .",
    "transmission experiments in the thz regime , using linearly polarized light , would be more feasible.@xcite for this reason we investigate the surface impedance for a rather broad range of frequencies . at very high frequencies ,",
    "though , inelastic scattering would reduce the quasiparticle mean free paths even at low temperatures to such an extent that the local limit applies .",
    "an investigation of the electromagnetic response of a needle shaped single crystal to a parallel microwave magnetic field , which would involve the in - plane conductivity only , appears to be even more promising in view of the thick single crystals that can now be grown in bazro@xmath18 crucibles .",
    "@xcite    if the pairing state in high-@xmath8 superconductors has nodes , which is at present a widely held belief , then a momentum dependent coherence length could be introduced .",
    "this would exceed the penetration depth for momentum states in the nodal region so that high-@xmath8 materials are london superconductors only in the sense that for the majority of @xmath24-states @xmath25 .",

    "this change in the temperature dependence of @xmath6 due to nonlocality is however easily masked by mean free path and finite frequency effects.@xcite    schopohl and dolgov@xcite have argued that a linear temperature dependence of the penetration depth would violate the third law of thermodynamics .",
    "the nonlocal effects discovered by kosztin and leggett @xcite could reconcile the @xmath1-wave model with this general thermodynamic argument but only for the geometry in which the @xmath15-axis is parallel to the sample surface .",

    "can usually be neglected and this is what we shall do here because we are interested in microwave losses at low but finite temperatures . for strictly 2d systems , one might wonder whether fluctuation effects would not be much more important than such very small nonlocal corrections .",
    "another consequence of @xmath1-wave pairing is the fact that pair - breaking is possible at any frequency .",
    "however , for this process to contribute to the transverse conductivity , the finite photon momentum needs to be taken into account unless the required momentum transfer is provided by some other scattering event occuring simultaneously .",

    "two contributions to the nonlocal response can be identified : absorption by quasiparticles and pair breaking .",
    "the latter contribution dominates in the thz regime , but since it is nearly frequency and temperature independent , it would be hard to identify .",
    "as in the anomalous skin effect in the normal state , the quasiparticle contribution to @xmath0 goes through a maximum as the frequency is increased when @xmath138 .",
    "the peak height increases with the number of thermally occupied quasiparticle states until the temperature is so high that inelastic scattering severely limits the quasiparticle free mean paths . in a search for this effect",
    "it is therefore , not advisable to perform the experiments at very low temperatures . for the material parameter",
    "chosen the increase in @xmath0 over the local limit is largest for frequencies near 100ghz . at the lower end of the microwave regime ,",
    "nonlocality actually reduces @xmath0 below the local limit as a consequence of the anisotropy of the energy gap .",
    "the size of nonlocal corrections to @xmath0 in the superconducting state depends sensitively on the scattering phase shift and not only on the disorder induced normal state scattering rate . if disorder were correctly described by the strong scattering limit , for nonlocal effects to be important a degree of perfection in the cuo@xmath17-planes",
    "would be required that appears to be unattainable .",
    "when one moves away from this limit , the picture changes rapidly .",
