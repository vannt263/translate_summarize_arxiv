    "the entropy of a black hole is 1/4 of the area of the event horizon of the black hole measured in planck units @xcite .",
    "this area law of entropy was generalized to more general systems , and later was taken as a general principle : the so called holographic principle @xcite .",
    "the strongest evidence of the holographic principle was provided by the ads / cft correspondence which states that all information about a gravitational system in a spatial region is encoded in its boundary @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the thermodynamic laws of black holes and de - sitter space - time suggest a deep connection between gravitation and thermodynamics @xcite . by using the area law of entropy for all local rindler horizons ,",
    "einstein field equation was derived from the first law of thermodynamics @xcite .",
    "recently , the thermodynamic relation @xmath1 @xcite between the entropy @xmath2 , active gravitational energy @xmath3 and temperature @xmath4 was reinterpreted as the equipartition law of energy @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the number of bits on the horizon @xcite . combining the equipartition law of energy and the holographic principle ,",
    "einstein field equation was derived @xcite .",
    "furthermore , gravity was explained as an entropic force caused by changes in the information associated with the positions of material bodies @xcite , and this idea was extensively discussed @xcite .",
    "motivated by bekenstein s original thought experiment about black holes , verlinde considered a small piece of a spherical holographic screen , and a particle with mass @xmath7 approaching it from the side , with the change of entropy near the screen assumed to be @xcite @xmath8 the effective force acting on the particle due to the change of entropy is @xmath9 because an observer in an accelerated frame has the unruh temperature @xmath10 so we get newton s second law @xmath11 .",
    "although it seems that we derived newton s second law for any force , actually the derivation is satisfied for gravitational force only .",
    "suppose the closed holographic screen with radius @xmath12 can be divided into @xmath13 microscopic cells , where @xmath14 ( we use units with @xmath15 throughout this paper ) is the planck length and @xmath16 is a numerical factor whose value will be determined later .",
    "if each cell has @xmath17 microscopic configurations , then the entropy of the screen is @xcite @xmath18 once @xmath19 is chosen , the standard area law , @xmath20 recovers .",
    "recently it was shown that the entropy of a holographic screen is @xmath21 of its area for static holographic screens if gravity is interpreted as an entropic force @xcite .",
    "if one assumes that each cell of area @xmath22 contributes an energy @xmath23 , according to the equipartition law , we get the total energy @xmath24 so the unruh temperature reads @xmath25 and the acceleration is @xmath26 if @xmath27 , then we get the newton s law of gravitation .",
    "so we choose @xmath27 .    by generalizing this approach to the relativistic case , einstein equation",
    "can be derived @xcite .",
    "as we discussed above , einstein field equation can also be derived from the first law of thermodynamics , and the friedmann equation for several gravity theories was derived from the first law of thermodynamics at the apparent horizon ( ah ) @xcite , a natural question raised is whether there is any connection between the first law of thermodynamics and the equipartition law of energy . in this paper",
    ", we address this problem by applying this approach to the apparent horizon in cosmology .",
    "we first show that the first law of thermodynamics at the apparent horizon is equivalent to the equipartition law of energy at the apparent horizon , then we show that friedmann equation can be derived from the equipartition law of energy and the holographic principle at the apparent horizon . finally , we make a consistency check of our derivation .",
    "it tells us that our derivation is correct only when the state parameter satisfies @xmath0 , a value matches the recent cosmological observations .",
    "this constraint opens a door for applying verlinde s scheme to the study of dark energy .",
    "generally speaking , except the above two hypotheses , i.e. , the equipartition law and the holographic principle at the apparent horizon , our derivation of the friedmann equations needs one more assumption : there is energy flux through the apparent horizon .",
    "the basic idea is that by assuming an energy flux through the apparent horizon with area @xmath28 , the energy @xmath29 which is enclosed by the apparent horizon increases with the time . according to the equipartition law , this leads to the changes of temperature and number of bits of the screen , explicitly , and temperature @xmath30 .",
    "( [ equiplaw ] ) is the first - order approximation , i.e. , @xmath31 ] @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath6 , respectively , represent the temperature and the number of bits of the holographic screen . by identifying @xmath34 with the changes of the area of the apparent horizon @xmath35 through the holographic principle",
    ", we derive the friedmann equation .",
    "this is roughly sketched in figure ( [ fig1 ] ) .     to @xmath36 .",
    ", width=432,height=240 ]    this counter - intuition picture can be well understood as following : we take the apparent horizon as a holographic screen , increase of the energy of the region enclosed by a horizon inevitably leads to the increase of the entropy of that region . holographic principle tells us that this corresponds to the increase of the horizon area . on the other hand ,",
    "the flux of fluid through the horizon implies our uncertainty about the region outside the horizon increases .",
    "this is equivalent to the increase of the entropy of the horizon , and again leads to the increase of the horizon area .    to address our derivation more explicitly ,",
    "let us focus on a ( 3 + 1)-dimensional friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) universe with the metric @xmath37 where @xmath38 and the 2-dimensional metric @xmath39 with @xmath40 corresponding to a flat , open and closed universe respectively .",
    "the apparent horizon , which is defined by the relation @xmath41 , turns out to be @xmath42 where @xmath43 denotes the hubble parameter .",
    "the apparent horizon with area @xmath44 carries @xmath45 bits of information .",
    "suppose during the infinitesimal time interval @xmath46 , the radius of the apparent horizon evolves from @xmath47 to @xmath48 , then the change of the area of the ah is @xmath49 .",
    "so the number of bit is increased by @xmath50 on the other hand , the change of the hawking temperature for locally defined ah @xcite . ] @xmath51 is @xmath52 from eq .",
    "( [ energy ] ) , we get the changes of the total energy ( similar to eq .",
    "( [ equiplaw ] ) ) @xmath53 note that the entropy of the apparent horizon is @xmath54 , so @xmath55 .",
    "this shows the equivalence between the equipartition law of energy and the first law of thermodynamics , @xmath56 . from the definition of the apparent horizon ( [ 2eq3 ] )",
    ", we get @xmath57    now we discuss the energy flow through the apparent horizon within a time interval @xmath46 . because the energy - momentum tensor of the matter in the universe is a perfect fluid , @xmath58 , where @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the energy density and pressure , respectively , the energy flow out through the horizon is @xmath61 where the ( approximate ) killing vector or the ( approximate ) generator of the horizon , the future directed ingoing null vector field @xmath62 . combining eqs .",
    "( [ de ] ) , ( [ draeq ] ) and ( [ de1 ] ) , we get the following equation @xmath63 using the energy conservation equation @xmath64 we get the friedmann equation @xmath65 in the above formulae , an integration constant , which can be regarded as a cosmological constant , has been dropped out .",
    "during our derivation of the friedmann equations , we have , as mentioned in the last section , made an assumption that the energy is flowed out through the apparent horizon .",
    "this is the only robust of our derivation , and hence it deserves further investigation . to prove or disprove this assumption",
    "one can make a consistency check of the derivation .",
    "in other words , starting from the correct friedmann equations obtained by standard way ( for example by solving the einstein field equations ) , we consider if it is possible to have an energy flux out through the apparent horizon .    for simplicity ,",
    "we only consider @xmath66 , cases with @xmath67 can be done in the same way .",
    "then from the definition of @xmath47 we obtain the expansion rate of the apparent horizon @xmath68 after combining the friedmann equations ( [ fe1 ] ) and ( [ fe2 ] ) , this can be written as @xmath69 where we have introduced a parameter @xmath70 which is associated with the equation of state @xmath71    to examine if the fluids will flow out through the horizon , we only need to consider the fluid very close to the horizon . recalling to the definition of the apparent horizon which can be defined as the boundary above which the fluid has velocities more than 1the velocity of light ,",
    "we then obtain the velocity of the fluid ( inside the horizon ) very close to the horizon ( denoted by @xmath72 ) @xmath73 where @xmath74 . comparing @xmath75 with @xmath72",
    "we are able to learn if the fluid flows out through the horizon , i.e. , @xmath76 according to our derivation of friedmann equations , two conditions should be fulfilled : the flux of energy flows out through the apparent horizon and the area of the horizon increases .",
    "this is equivalent to require that @xmath77 and @xmath78 . from eqs .",
    "( [ vofra ] ) and ( [ energyflow ] ) this can be satisfied when @xmath0 . therefore , our derivation of the friedmann equations is self - consistent if we impose a constraint on the state parameter by @xmath0 , a value matches recent cosmological observations)-([energyflow ] ) , we see that @xmath79 implies that @xmath80 . ] .",
    "motivated by the work on the origin of gravity @xcite , we derived the friedmann equation from the equipartition law of energy and the holographic principle .",
    "we also show that the equipartition law of energy can be interpreted as the first law of thermodynamics at the apparent horizon .",
    "this suggests that the equipartition law of energy plays a fundamental role .",
    "although there are many unresolved issues on verlinde s proposal , it has , at least in some extent , transmitted a message that it is possible for the gravity to have a thermodynamic origin , and our universe in this context is driven by the so - called entropic force .",
    "the consistency check shows that the derivation in our way is not always effective  it will be invalid if the state parameter is out of the region @xmath0 .",
    "this defect does not affect the correctness of our derivation , on the contrary , the `` defect '' may provide us with a natural requirement of dark energy @xcite .",
    "it also should be noted that our derivation of friedmann equations is different from jacobson s previous work@xcite in that : ( i)our derivation is not restricted to the local rindler causal horizon , and a uniformly accelerated frame is not needed ; ( ii)instead of using the first law of thermodynamics , we are using the equipartition law of energy .    * note added .",
    "* after the completion of our paper , there are two relative works @xcite on the derivation , with different methods , of friedmann equations appeared .",
