    "in paramagnetic systems the relative weakness of the dipole - dipole interaction between magnetic ions results in characteristic temperatures lying in the range of @xmath5@xmath6k . besides , the dipolar coupling usually coexists with the exchange interaction .",
    "however , for superparamagnets ( nanoscale solids or clusters whose net spin rotates thermally activated in the magnetic anisotropy potential ) , the exchange or other competing interactions can usually be discarded and the dipole - dipole interaction can be studied in pure form . in addition , the size of their typical magnetic moments ( @xmath7@xmath8 ) shifts the relevant temperatures up to the range of a few kelvin , facilitating greatly the experimental study of this interaction.@xcite    the calculation of the relevant statistical - mechanical quantities constitutes a formidable problem in most many - body systems .",
    "apart from various specific solution ansatzs , a number of systematic expansions ( in the density , coupling parameter , etc . )",
    "have been developed for weak interactions.@xcite in spin and dipole systems , the moment method of van vleck @xcite ( a high - temperature expansion of the partition function ) permits to study the equilibrium properties in the absence of cooperative phenomena .",
    "this technique is one of the few analytical tools available to handle systems coupled by the dipole - dipole interaction , due to the long - range and reduced symmetry of this interaction .",
    "an important property of superparamagnets is their magnetic anisotropy , which results in a number of spin orientations of minimum energy separated by potential barriers . for uniaxial spins @xcite the characteristic time for the thermo - activated rotation of the spin over the anisotropy barrier @xmath9",
    "can approximately be written as @xmath10 where @xmath11 is weakly temperature dependent and takes values @xmath12@xmath13s for magnetic nanoparticles .",
    "then , for a given measurement time , @xmath14 , the system exhibits its thermal - equilibrium response when the _ condition of superparamagnetism _ , @xmath15 , is obeyed , which corresponds to the temperature range ( in units of @xmath16 ) : @xmath17 in  static \" measurements ( @xmath18@xmath19s ) , due to the small value of @xmath11 , this equilibrium range extends down to very low temperatures ( @xmath20 ) , showing that the naive ascription of superparamagnetism to the range in which  the thermal energy is comparable or larger than the anisotropy energy \" ( @xmath21 ) is unduly restrictive .",
    "indeed , as @xmath22 decreases the system displays different behaviors ranging from almost isotropic ( @xmath0 ) , then moderately anisotropic ( @xmath23 ) , and eventually strongly anisotropic ( @xmath24 ) _ without leaving the equilibrium regime_. therefore , descriptions based on the assumption of isotropic behavior or the opposite discrete - orientation or plane - rotator approximations ( for easy - axis and easy - plane anisotropy ) , necessarily have a reduced range of validity in superparamagnets .    due to the mentioned characteristics of the dipole - dipole coupling and the difficulties introduced by the anisotropy ,",
    "most rigorous calculations in interacting superparamagnets have been done by numerical simulation techniques.@xcite in this article we apply thermodynamic perturbation theory @xcite to calculate analytically the linear susceptibility and the specific heat of lattices of uniaxial classical spins coupled by the dipole - dipole interaction , accounting exactly ( non - perturbatively ) for their anisotropy energy . along with the study of the dependence on the shape of the system of certain quantities ( due to the long - range of the dipole - dipole interaction @xcite ) , our treatment permits to investigate the effects of the strength and sign of the anisotropy , as well as of the orientational distribution of anisotropy axes .",
    "we find that for systems with axes _ oriented at random _ the corrections to the specific heat and the linear susceptibility become independent of the anisotropy ( at least to second order in the interaction coupling ) in certain spatial arrangements of the spins ( e.g. , cubic or completely disordered ) .",
    "the latter is a generalization to interacting systems of the well known absence of anisotropy effects on the equilibrium linear susceptibility of dipoles with random anisotropy ( discussed in ref .  ) .",
    "however , apart from the important exception of random axes , the anisotropy is an essential element in the determination of the corrections due to the interactions .",
    "this is illustrated with the response of systems with _",
    "parallel _ anisotropy axes , where an ordinary high - temperature expansion , either disregarding the anisotropy or in the discrete orientation limit , poorly describes the susceptibility curves ( computed for comparison by monte carlo simulation ) , while the thermodynamic perturbation theory describes the results with reasonable accuracy .",

    "the magnetic anisotropy energy is assumed to be uniaxial @xmath26 where @xmath9 is the anisotropy parameter ( for magnetic nanoparticles @xmath27 , where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the anisotropy constant and volume ) , and @xmath30 and @xmath31 are , respectively , unit vectors along the magnetic moment and anisotropy axis of the @xmath32th spin . the dipole - dipole interaction energy can be written as @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the magnitude of the magnetic moment , @xmath35 is an appropriate characteristic length ( see below ) , and @xmath36 here @xmath37 is the unit tensor and @xmath38 the vector joining the sites @xmath32 and @xmath39 ( measured in units of @xmath35 ) .",
    "the action of a tensor dyadic @xmath40 on a vector @xmath41 is the usual one @xmath42 , and hence the tensor @xmath43 , when multiplied with @xmath44 , gives ( except for a constant ) the field at the position of the @xmath32th dipole created by @xmath44 .    for notational simplicity",
    "we are assuming that the parameters characterizing the different dipoles are identical , but it is immediate to generalize the expressions for different anisotropy constants , magnetic moments , volumes , etc .",
    "similarly , although the assumption of uniaxial anisotropy is not necessary until the end of the calculation we made it here for definiteness .",
    "concerning the characteristic length @xmath35 , it is defined in such a way that @xmath45 is the mean volume around each spin .",
    "thus , @xmath35 is the lattice constant in a simple cubic arrangement , and for nanoparticles the volume concentration of particles is @xmath46 .",

    "the long range of the dipole - dipole interaction leads to a shape dependence of the physical quantities in an external field@xcite and hence of the linear susceptibility ( which is a field derivative ) . in the expressions",

    "the sums @xmath115 ( @xmath116 ) , @xmath118 , and @xmath120 , on the other hand , contain @xmath163 ( instead of @xmath164 or @xmath165 ) , which makes them rapidly convergent and shape - independent.@xcite    figure [ fig : shapedep ] shows the thermodynamic perturbation theory susceptibility ( thin lines ) for @xmath166 and @xmath69 in the noninteracting limit ( thick lines ) for a system with parallel axes with the form of a prolate ellipsoid , a sphere , and an oblate ellipsoid ( the symbols correspond to monte carlo simulations to be discussed below ) .",
    "for the non spherical systems @xmath167,@xcite and the corrections to the susceptibility are largely dominated by the first order term , which corresponds to the direct action discussed above .",
    "the shape dependence is easily understood by recalling the behavior of two dipoles : if their axes are aligned , they minimize their dipole - dipole energy lying parallel along the line joining them , while if this line is perpendicular to the axes , they minimize the interaction energy pointing along opposite directions . therefore , in elongated systems the aligning effect dominates and @xmath69 is larger than the noninteracting susceptibility [ fig.[fig : shapedep](a ) ] , while in oblate systems the opposite occurs with the associated decrease of @xmath69 [ fig .",
    "[ fig : shapedep](c ) ] .",
    "in the sphere the direct term exactly cancels ( @xmath168 ) , and negative second order corrections ( which incorporate indirect and reaction terms ) determine the susceptibility [ fig.[fig : shapedep](b ) ] .    concerning the specific heat , due to the presence of the rapidly convergent lattice sums @xmath115 , @xmath118 , and @xmath120 , this quantity does not depend on the shape of the system .",
    "physically , this is a consequence of the absence of linear term in eq .",

    ". then , the first corrections to the susceptibility due to the interactions become _ exactly _ independent of the anisotropy _ if _ the axes are distributed at random [ see eqs.([a0ran])([a2ran ] ) where the only anisotropy dependent term is multiplied by @xmath120 ] . therefore",
    ", the susceptibility coincides with that obtained by an ordinary high - temperature expansion for isotropic dipoles ( see ref . ; @xmath147 was implicitly used in that work ) but also with the perturbative @xmath69 for ising - like spins with randomly distributed `` ising '' axes [ fig .",
    "[ fig : rp](a ) ] .",
    "this generalizes to interacting spins the well known result , discussed in ref .",
    "( see also ref . ) , i.e. , the absence of anisotropy effects on the equilibrium linear susceptibility of systems with random anisotropy .    nevertheless ,",
    "when @xmath170 ( as occurs in tetragonal lattices ) the susceptibility will show some anisotropy dependence for random axes ( although weak , since @xmath170 is accompanied by @xmath167 and @xmath69 is then dominated by the anisotropy independent first order term ) . in any case , on inspecting eqs .",
    "( [ a0para])([a2para ] ) one would expect important differences for parallel axes between the thermodynamic perturbation theory results and those were the anisotropy is not included ( @xmath124 ) .",
    "this is what actually occurs as fig .",
    "[ fig : rp](b ) illustrates : the susceptibility is not only larger for parallel axes than for isotropic dipoles , but also the temperature dependence is stronger , owing to the extra , anisotropy - induced , temperature dependence of the coefficients @xmath111 via @xmath171 .",
    "this is clearly seen when comparing the correction terms @xmath172 themselves [ inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : rp](b ) ] .    note that the susceptibilities in the isotropic and ising cases constitute lower and upper bounds to the actual @xmath69 .",
    "the upper bound is slowly approached at low enough temperatures ( @xmath173 ) , completing in this way the crossover from isotropic behavior at high @xmath22 to the discrete - orientation behavior at low @xmath22 .",
    "note finally that the lowest temperatures displayed ( @xmath174 ) are still inside the range where an ordinary magnetization experiment yields the equilibrium response ( @xmath175 ) .    concerning the specific heat ,",
    "the part corresponding to the noninteracting system , @xmath176 , does not depend on the anisotropy axes orientations .",
    "the reason is that if the spins are independent , they can not probe the relative orientations of their axes and there is no preferential direction to compare their orientations with ( as that of the probing field in the susceptibility ) .",
    "thus , the noninteracting specific heat ( inset in fig .  [ fig : cv ] ) only reflects the individual behavior of the spins in their single - spin anisotropy potentials , and its peak ( at @xmath177 ) reflects the `` transition '' from the isotropic behavior at high @xmath22 ( with @xmath178 ) to the discrete orientation behavior at low @xmath22 .",
    "this can be considered as a sort of schottky peak , due in this case to the  depopulation \" of the high - energy `` barrier levels''.@xcite    the corrections due to the coupling depend naturally on the orientations of the axes . for a given axes",
    "distribution the specific heat increases with the interaction strength ( fig .",

    "figure  [ fig : cv ] shows that the effect of the interaction is indeed stronger in a system with aligned axes than in a system with random anisotropy .",
    "since the analytic expressions derived for @xmath69 and @xmath127 are expansions valid in principle for @xmath179 , which corresponds to @xmath180 [ eq .

    ", it would be desirable to compare the formulas with the results of some method treating the interactions without approximations .",
    "besides , as the fundamentals of the expansion are the same for the different quantities , it would suffice to estimate the range of validity for one of them .",

    "we have obtained approximate analytical expressions for the equilibrium linear susceptibility and specific heat of classical spins interacting via dipole - dipole interactions by means of thermodynamic perturbation theory .",
    "the formulas account for the interactions to second order in the coupling constant over temperature but are exact in the anisotropy .",
    "as the results are valid for any strength and sign of the anisotropy , provided only the interaction strength is weak enough ( @xmath184 ) , they include as particular cases the linear response and specific heat of isotropic as well as strongly anisotropic spins ( discrete - orientation model and plane rotators ) .",

    "the same holds for the corrections to the specific heat due to the interactions ( indeed , without restrictions on the lattice type ) . for a general axes distribution ,",
    "however , the anisotropy effects do not disappear .",
