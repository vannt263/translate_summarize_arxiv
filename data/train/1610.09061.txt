    "broad - lined type ic supernovae ( sne ic - bl ) are a subclass of core - collapse type ic sne having broad absorption troughs in their optical spectra .",
    "since their discovery , sne ic - bl are too weird to be understood within the standard sn picture .",
    "one of their peculiarities is that their astonishing kinetic energy ( @xmath6 ) is unexpected in the well - studied sn explosion mechanisms @xcite .",
    "another peculiarity of sne ic - bl is the failure of one - dimensional @xmath5ni model  which works very well for most of ordinary sne  in reproducing their light curves .",
    "what is intricate in reproducing the light curves of sne ic - bl is the fact that the fitting parameters suitable for the peak of the light curve can not give a reasonable fit to late - time linear decline @xcite . in light of this difficulty",
    ", it was found that the light curve of sne ic - bl can be reasonably reproduced by proposing that the ejecta consist of two components , i.e. one fast - moving outer component which is responsible for the early peak and the inner slow compact component which produces the late - time linear decline @xcite .",
    "such a two - component @xmath7ni model is partially supported because of the aspherity manifested in some sne ic - bl .",
    "sne ic - bl are also of great astrophysical importance because they are the only sne in association with long - duration gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "despite persistent investigation , the two types of hypothesized central engine of grbs , i.e. black holes @xcite and/or magnetars @xcite , are still in a veil of secrecy .",
    "grbs are highly collimated relativistic phenomena , while sne ic - bl are subrelativistic and nearly isotropic .",
    "therefore sne ic - bl could shed light on the still elusive central engine of grbs .",
    "there is indirect evidence that sne ic - bl are powered by millisecond magnetars because their kinetic energy has an upper limit that is close to the rotational energy of a neutron star spinning at nearly broken - up frequency @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the progenitor mass of sn 2006aj associated with grb 060218 @xcite and the light curve of sn 2011kl associated with grb 111209a @xcite are consistent with magnetar formation .",
    "nonetheless , the modeling uncertainty of stellar evolution for sn 2006aj @xcite and the short - duration data coverage ( @xmath8 ) and moderate data accuracy for sn 2011kl @xcite make such evidence inconclusive .    in developing a magnetar model for sne ic - bl ,",
    "it is found for sne 1997ef and 2007ru that the early rapid rise and decline ( @xmath9 ) in the light curves stems from the contribution of a rapidly spinning magnetar , while the later linear decline ( @xmath10 ) can be attributed to the @xmath5co radioactive decay @xcite .",
    "the successful demonstration of the magnetar model in reproducing their light curves is a positive signal for the formation of magnetars in sne ic - bl .",
    "however , we have to bear in mind that the magnetar model is only one possible choice for sne ic - bl because the two - component model is also able to reproduce reasonably well the light curves of most sne ic - bl @xcite .",
    "the motivation for this work is , on the one hand , to assess the ability of the magnetar model in reproducing the very late - phase ( @xmath11 ) light curves of sne ic - bl when the luminosity decline rate shows evidence for deviation from the linear decline ( during the phase @xmath12 ) and on the other hand to evaluate if it is superior to the two - component model in elucidating the explosion remnants .",
    "the reason for observational data for @xmath2 is as follows .",
    "if one focuses on the data within one year after explosion , the @xmath13 tail in the magnetar model easily parallels that expected from @xmath14co decay @xcite . only at very late phases",
    "can one distinguish between magnetar model and @xmath5co decay model .    to accurately determine the parameter values , a markov chain monte carlo program is developed .",
    "we search the literature and find that sne 1998bw and 2002ap have an observational coverage well beyond @xmath15 and are therefore quite suitable for our investigation . to our surprise , in section",
    "[ sec : data ] it is found that in the magnetar model , the magnetar not only contributes to the early peak of the light curve of the broad - lined sne 1998bw and 2002ap , but it can also manifest itself as a significant excess over the linear decay in late - time light curves when the @xmath5co contribution became small compared to the magnetar spin - down luminosity .",
    "the results are discussed in section [ sec : dis ] and it is argued that sne 1998bw and 2002ap provide till now strong evidence for magnetar formation in sne ic - bl . a short summary is given in section [ sec : con ] .",
    "being one of the nearest sne in the last decades , sn 2002ap triggered an observational campaign since its discovery on 2002 january 29 @xcite . thanks to its proximity ,",
    "only @xmath16 in distance , high quality observational data were acquired until @xmath17 after explosion , which is prerequisite for the identification of late excess over the linear @xmath5co decay .",
    "sn 1998bw , on the other hand , is the nearest sn associated with a grb @xcite .",
    "although at a distance greater than sn 2002ap , its brighter luminosity qualifies sn 1998bw as an ideal observational target and its light curve was measured to @xmath18 post explosion @xcite .    to accurately model the light curve of sne 1998bw and 2002ap , we develop a markov chain monte carlo approach based on the recently updated analytic magnetar model @xcite . in this model ,",
    "photospheric recession is considered so that the photospheric velocity evolution is traced .",
    "the acceleration of the sn ejecta by the magnetar energy injection is taken into account . that is , in this model the kinetic energy of the sne ic - bl is believed to originate mainly from the magnetar spin - down .",
    "nevertheless , this does not preclude the possibility of a non - zero initial explosion energy .",
    "this model also incorporates the high energy photon leakage ( @xcite , see also @xcite ) based on the fact that the energy injection emanated from the magnetar could be dominated by high energy photons @xcite .    in summary , aside from the usual parameters ,",
    "e.g. the ejecta mass @xmath19 , the @xmath5ni mass @xmath20 , the opacity in optical band @xmath21 , we also need the opacity @xmath22 to @xmath7ni ( including @xmath5co ) decay photons , the opacity @xmath23 to magnetar photons and the magnetar parameters , i.e. the dipole magnetic field @xmath24 and initial rotation period @xmath25 .",
    "the optical opacity @xmath21 is strongly degenerated with the ejecta mass @xmath26 and can not be accurately determined in this model .",
    "fortunately , @xmath21 is a parameter that characterizes the microphysics of the ejecta and therefore can be calculated in first principles based on our knowledge about the ejecta composition . in the literature a range of values , from @xmath27 to @xmath28 , is used ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "here we adopt the value @xmath29 .",
    "the opacity to @xmath5ni decay photons @xmath22 usually takes the fiducial value @xmath30 @xcite . in the actual applications it is found from case to case that this value can not fit the light curve of some sne ( e.g. , *",
    "this discrepancy may be caused by some macrophysical ignorance , e.g. a peculiar density distribution of the ejecta . in this work",
    "we leave @xmath22 as a free parameter and appreciate its deviation from the fiducial value as macrophysical uncertainties .",
    "another more uncertain parameter is the opacity to magnetar photons @xmath31 .",
    "depending on the energy spectra of the spinning magnetar , @xmath32 may vary from @xmath33 to @xmath34 @xcite . based on this fact",
    ", we set @xmath32 as a free parameter .    in the previous magnetar modeling to demonstrate that the early light curve of sne ic - bl is due to the contribution of a magnetar , we assume that the kinetic energy of sne ic - bl comes exclusively from the magnetar spin - down @xcite .",
    "this is approximately true for the sne studied by wang16b because the rapid rise in the light curve of sne 1997ef and 2007ru precludes a significant initial explosion energy . in a more general case ,",
    "however , any sn explosion should have an initial explosion energy .",

    "calls for alternative models for sne ic - bl , manifesting the investigation of magnetar plus @xmath5ni model presented in this work .",
    "the idea of combining a magnetar and @xmath5ni to reproduce the light curve of sn 1998bw was previously discussed by @xcite . by considering the luminosity of sn 1998bw at @xmath48",
    ", @xcite estimated that the magnetar would be born with a field strength in excess of @xmath49 .",
    "a magnetar with such a strong field , in woosley s estimate , will loss all of its rotational energy to explosion and none left to the light curve .",
    "however , it is shown that such an estimate is only partially correct @xcite .",
    "on the one hand , with a much strong magnetic field , the magnetar is indeed prone to losing its energy to explosion @xcite . on the other hand , however , a minor fraction of the rotational energy will be thermalized , which is enough to power the light curve @xcite .    in the magnetar ( plus @xmath5ni ) model , the intermediate - time ( @xmath50 ) linear decay , sensitive to the @xmath5ni mass @xmath51 , in the light curve is caused by @xmath5co decay , while in the two - component model this linear decay is assumed to be produced by the inner component .",
    "it is therefore desirable to compare the value @xmath20 in the magnetar model to the @xmath5ni mass of the inner component in the two - component model .",
    "comparison of table [ tbl : para ] with table 2 of maeda03 shows good agreement between @xmath20 in the magnetar model and the inner component @xmath5ni mass @xmath52 in the two - component model .",
    "we note that unusually strong nebular lines of [ fe ii ] are seen in sn 1998bw , consistent with the production of more than the usual amount of fe in the explosion @xcite . in sn",
    "1998bw @xcite , however , is a concern because sne ia , which produce copious @xmath5ni , in general show strong [ fe ii ] and [ fe iii ] emission features .",
    "in addition , the wide bump in the region between @xmath53 and @xmath54 in the nebular spectra of sn 1998bw at days until about 337 post explosion @xcite precludes a large amount of @xmath5ni because otherwise the line blanketing caused by iron group elements would significantly suppress the radiation shortwards of @xmath55 @xcite .",
    "] this is first of all in accord with the magnetar model because the inferred @xmath5ni mass of sn 1998bw is indeed larger than the @xmath5ni masses found in other sne ic - bl , e.g. sne 1997ef , 2007ru , 2002ap , within the magnetar model . on the other hand ,",
    "though , the synthetic sn spectra suffer from large modeling uncertainties and a @xmath5ni mass of @xmath56 is not inconsistent with observation .",
    "in the two - component model , the inferred total @xmath5ni mass , @xmath57 , implies a progenitor core mass @xmath58 @xcite , which is in excess of the maximum mass of a neutron star , suggesting a collapsar ( black hole ) for grb 980425 . in the magnetar model , however , the total @xmath5ni mass , @xmath56 , is consistent with the formation of a magnetar .",
    "this also serves as a self - consistent check for the magnetar model .",
    "except for the @xmath5ni mass , other parameters could be significantly different between these two models . for sn 2002ap ,",
    "the ejecta mass in the magnetar model is in reasonable agreement with the total ejecta mass given in the two - component model , while the ejecta mass of sn 1998bw in the magnetar model is significantly smaller than that given by @xcite .",
    "table [ tbl : para ] shows that , in the magnetar model , @xmath59 .",
    "this result seems hard to understand .",
    "however , when we compare the light curves of these two sne @xcite , it is immediately evident that both the early and late - time shape of the light curve of sn 2002ap is strikingly similar to that of sn 1998bw . in other words ,",
    "sn 1998bw is just a brighter cousin to sn 2002ap .",
    "these two sne have the same rise and decline rate around the peak time .",
    "the fact that sn 1998bw has a slightly heavier ejecta mass is only because , in the light curve modeling aspect , it expanded faster than sn 2002ap . , @xmath24 , @xmath25 in the magnetar model can be sensitively determined by the early peak of the light curve .",
    "it is just the early peaks ( @xmath9 ) of sne 1998bw and 2002ap that are quite similar ( see the inset of figure 4 of * ? ? ?",
    "] such a parameter difference for sn 1998bw between the two - component model and the magnetar model may imply a difference for its progenitor .",
    "the ejecta mass , @xmath60 , in the two - component model points to a massive single star , while @xmath61 in the magnetar model favors a binary origin @xcite , although a @xmath62 wolf - rayet star ( here a remnant magnetar with typical mass @xmath63 is assumed ) evolved from a single @xmath64 main sequence star is also possible @xcite .",
    "the initial kinetic energy in the magnetar model is @xmath65 and @xmath66 for sne 2002ap and 1998bw , respectively .",
    "these values are significantly smaller than that given by the two - component model @xcite and in expectation from neutrino heating @xcite .",
    "the magnetic dipole field strength @xmath67 for sn 2002ap is similar to the value determined for sn 1997ef , while the value @xmath68 for sn 1998bw is significantly smaller .",
    "the weaker magnetic field for sn 1998bw is required because of its brighter luminosity @xcite .",
    "usually a magnetar can have dipole field in the range @xmath69 @xcite .",
    "however , it is suggested that a dipole field as strong as @xmath70 is possible in theoretical aspects @xcite .    in this fitting a value @xmath71",
    "is favoured for sn 2002ap .",
    "but in practice it is found that @xmath72 and @xmath73 result in essentially the same light curve .",
    "this fact can also be appreciated by inspecting figure [ fig:2002ap - corner ] . from table",
    "[ tbl : para ] we see a large difference of @xmath32 between sne 1998bw and 2002ap .",
    "inspection of figure 8 of @xcite indicates that this could imply average magnetar photon energies @xmath74 , in agreement with observation @xcite .",
    "theoretically , magnetar radiation depends on several parameters , e.g. , magnetic field , rotation period , angle between rotation axis and magnetic axis , and theorists are still struggling to unequivocally predict its spectrum energy distribution @xcite .    it can be seen that the two values of @xmath22 are also different and larger than the fiducial value @xmath75 .",
    "we think of this as macrophysical uncertainties , e.g. , a clumpy density distribution .",
    "radiation hydrodynamic calculations show that the magnetar - driven ejecta pile up at some radius , rather than homogeneously distributed , as assumed in this work @xcite .    as stated above , the validity of the fitting program",
    "can also be appreciated by comparing the determined value of explosion time @xmath36 with the actual explosion time . for sn 1998bw",
    "whose explosion time is known , the best - fit result gives @xmath76 , in excellent agreement with observations .",
    "such a consistency also confirms the association of sn 1998bw with grb 980425 .",
    "inspection of figures [ fig:1998bw ] and [ fig:2002ap ] shows that the monte carlo program sensitively captures the shape changes in the light curve . the decline rate of the light curve of sn 2002ap changes from @xmath77 between days 130 and 230 to @xmath78 between days 270 and 580 @xcite . there is a similar change in the light curve of sn 1998bw between phase ranges",
    "40 - 330 and 300 - 490 ( see table 4 of * ? ? ?",
    "the flattening in the phase range 500 - 1200 of sn 1998bw ( see figure [ fig:1998bw ] ) is actually a prediction \" of the magnetar model because we do not fit these data .",
    "a number of effects were discussed that may contribute to this flattening , including light echoes @xcite , interaction with circumstellar medium @xcite , emission from surviving binary star companion @xcite , radioactive isotopes @xcite , clumping @xcite , positron escape @xcite , freeze - out of the steady state approximation @xcite , radiation transport for late sne ia @xcite , contribution from an h ii region or individual stars @xcite , aspherical geometry @xcite , gamma - ray trapping @xcite , magnetar field decay @xcite , or contributions from collisions or a grb afterglow @xcite .    among all of the above possibilities , @xcite considered a simple but plausible case of @xmath79co and @xmath80ti radioactive contributions to the flattening , although with a ratio of @xmath79ni/@xmath5ni three times larger than the ratio observed in sn 1987a .",
    "indeed , these radioactive flattening resembles a magnetar powering at @xmath81 because of the progressive contributions from @xmath5co , @xmath79co and @xmath82ti at later phases @xcite .    in comparison to the above models",
    ", it was recently shown that in the magnetar model @xmath24 and @xmath25 can be accurately determined by the early peak for those sne whose peak is caused by a spinning - down magnetar @xcite .",
    "the advantage of the magnetar model over the two - component model is the fact that the magnetar parameters , @xmath24 and @xmath25 , determined by the early peak can naturally account for the late - time slow decline in the light curves of sne 1998bw and 2002ap .",
    "the magnetar initial rotation periods @xmath3 for sne 1998bw and 2002ap are longer than that of sn 1997ef @xcite .",
    "this longer @xmath25 of the magnetar is required for a relatively slow rise ( compared to sne 1997ef and 2007ru ) of the peak in the light curve .",
    "this @xmath25 is also essential for its contribution to the late - time observable excess relative to the @xmath5co linear decay . in other words ,",
    "the magnetar model predicts that the rise rate in early - time light curve should be relatively slow if the sn has a long lasting flattening .",
    "this intrinsic connection between the early peak and late - time flattening is not expected in alternative models and therefore provides a strong evidence in favor of the magnetar model .",
    "it may be argued that the magnetar model presented here can give a better account for these two sne because there are more free parameters in this model .",
    "this is not simply true at its first glance .",
    "there are 8 free parameters in the magnetar model ( see table [ tbl : para ] ) . in the two - component model ,",
    "the free parameters include @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath36 . to account for the late flattening , provided that it is attributed to @xmath79co and @xmath80ti ,",
    "another two parameters , @xmath89 and @xmath90 are needed .",
    "it is 9 parameters in total .",
    "the identification of the central engine of grbs has long been a challenge in high - energy astrophysics . instead of investigating the prompt emission and afterglows of grbs",

    "stimulated by frequent hinds of magnetar formation in grbs and sne ic - bl , we present a magnetar ( plus @xmath5ni ) model for sne ic - bl and find evidence that sne ic - bl 1998bw and 2002ap were powered by magnetars .    in more than one decade",
    "the picture of @xmath5ni heating to power the light curves of sne ic - bl was developed , with two - component model the most outstanding .",
    "here we present evidence that magnetars could be a more natural alternative .",

    "to bring the magnetar model for sne ic - bl onto a more solid ground , additional information is necessary .",
