    "the possibility of measuring parity non - conservation ( pnc ) in atoms was first considered by zeldovich in 1959@xcite",
    ". however , atomic pnc experiments begun only after bouchiat and bouchiat showed that parity mixing of atomic states scales as @xmath3 and measurable signals could be obtained for high - z atoms@xcite . for high-@xmath4 ,",
    "the degree of @xmath5-@xmath6 parity mixing in some atomic states , is of order @xmath7 .",
    "the precise measurement of this atomic pnc can provide a stringent low - energy test of the standard model@xcite , of inter - nucleon weak interactions , and of nuclear structure@xcite .",
    "+ there are several methods in which the parity mixing can be measured , and for each method the optimal atomic candidates are usually different . for example , the stark interference technique has been used to measure pnc in cs@xcite , yb@xcite , and dy@xcite , and proposed for fr@xcite and rb@xcite ; the optical rotation technique has been used successfully for tl@xcite , bi@xcite , and pb@xcite ; the ac - stark shift method is proposed for ba@xmath8@xcite and ra@xmath8@xcite ions ; and the hyperfine transition method is proposed for k@xcite , rb@xcite , and fr@xcite . to date , the most successful atomic pnc measurement has been the 0.35% precision measurement of nuclear - spin - independent pnc in cs@xcite . as the precision in the atomic theory of other pnc candidates",
    "is not expected to significantly surpass the theoretical precision of cs , current experiments are aiming at other important goals that are not dependent on extremely precise atomic theory calculations .",
    "examples include the measurement of atomic pnc on a chain of isotopes@xcite , and the measurement of nuclear spin - dependent effects@xcite . therefore , along these lines , pnc experiments are in progress as mentioned above@xcite",
    ". + due to the difficulty of controlling all the relevant parameters to the required precision , there have been only a handful of successful atomic pnc measurements , and even the few successful experiments have typically required 10 - 20 years to yield precise results @xcite .",
    "in addition , some of the current atomic pnc experiments are no longer tabletop , as they are performed on radioactive isotopes with short half lives of a few minutes , such as on fr at triumf@xcite and ra@xmath8 at kvi @xcite .",
    "+ recently , our group has proposed an extension of the optical rotation technique , with the use of a novel bow - tie optical cavity@xcite .",
    "we show in detail that the proposed cavity - enhanced technique produces large experimental optical rotation signals and robust experimental checks , and allows new atomic candidates to be considered .",
    "specifically , our proposal has several potential advantages , which solve some of the problems of past pnc optical rotation experiments .",
    "these advantages include the following : + ( a ) the effective optical - rotation pathlength is enhanced using a high - finesse cavity , by @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the finesse of the cavity ( for high - finesse cavities , @xmath11 ) , allowing the study of pnc in atomic systems for which single - pass optical rotation from available column densities is otherwise too small .",
    "we focus on metastable states in hg and xe@xcite , and ground - statei atoms@xcite , for which the single - pass optical rotation from available column densities require enhancement of between @xmath12-@xmath13 cavity passes to produce measurable signals .",
    "in addition , the proposed atomic systems are compatible with a high - finesse optical cavity , as high atomic densities can be produced at around room temperature ( for the case of tl , bi , and pb , temperatures in excess of 1000k were required , which is difficult to combine with high - transmission windows and a stable optical cavity ) .",
    "+ ( b ) two novel signal reversals are introduced .",
    "the main limitation in the original optical rotation experiments was the lack of rapid subtraction procedures or signal reversals .",
    "the proposed signal reversals are effected either by inverting the longitudinal magnetic field in the cavity , or by shifting the cavity resonance to an opposite polarization mode .",
    "these signal reversals can be performed at a high repetition rate , and allow the absolute optical rotation to be measured , without needing to remove the gas sample from the cavity .",
    "in addition , as metastable hg and xe and ground - state i can be produced by optical pumping , photodissociation or electrical discharge , the concentration of these species can be varied very quickly , giving an additional rapid subtraction procedure .",
    "+ ( c ) of the proposed pnc candidates , both hg and xe have several , commercially available , stable isotopes .",
    "in addition , hg and xe each have two isotopes with an odd - neutron nucleus ( @xmath1hg , @xmath14hg , and @xmath0xe , @xmath15xe ) .",
    "moreover , iodine has a radioactive isotope , @xmath0i , which can be commercially obtained .",
    "both i isotopes have an odd - proton nucleus .",
    "therefore , nuclear spin - dependent effects can be measured for both odd - neutron and odd - proton nuclei , as well as pnc measurements along a chain of isotopes@xcite .",
    "+ the aim of this paper is to explain the main features of the cavity - enhanced pnc optical rotation scheme in depth and to present simulated experimental signals for hg , xe , and i. in section[sec : ii ] we describe in brief the origin of the pnc optical rotation . in section[sec : atomicsystems ] we introduce the atomic systems considered for future pnc investigations using the optical rotation technique .",
    "in addition , we examine the experimental feasibility of pnc measurements in these atomic systems . in section[sec : iii ] we describe the properties of the cavity - enhanced scheme and derive the eigenmodes of a bow - tie cavity with circular birefringence ( faraday rotation and pnc optical rotation ) and linear birefringence , and discuss how the signal reversals are implemented . in section[sec : iv ] we simulate the pnc lineshapes for several transitions in hg , xe , and i , for a range of experimental conditions , and discuss the results .",

    "<S> we present the theoretical basis of a cavity - enhanced polarimetric scheme for the measurement of parity - nonconserving ( pnc ) optical rotation . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the possibility of detecting pnc optical rotation in accessible transitions in metastable xe and hg , and ground state i. in particular , the physics of the pnc optical rotation is presented , and we explore the lineshape effects on the expected pnc optical rotation signals . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we present an analysis of the eigenpolarizations of the cavity - enhanced polarimeter , which is necessary for understanding the measurement procedure and the ability of employing robust background subtraction procedures using two novel signal reversals . using recent atomic structure theoretical calculations , we present simulations of the pnc optical rotation signals for all proposed transitions , assuming a range of experimentally feasible parameters . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the possibility of performing sensitive measurements of the nuclear - spin - dependent pnc effects is investigated , for the odd - neutron nuclei @xmath0xe and @xmath1hg , and the odd - proton nucleus @xmath2i . </S>"
