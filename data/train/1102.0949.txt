    "in this paper , we construct solutions for a thin film type equation with a destabilizing singular integral term .",
    "this term models the effects of an electric field ( see @xcite ) . from the analytical point of view",
    ", this paper belongs to the large body of literature devoted to the thin film equation with destabilizing terms such as long - wave unstable thin film problems @xcite or the kuramato - sivashinsky equation in combustion and solidification @xcite .",
    "more precisely , we are considering the following equation , which is introduced by tseluiko and papageorgiou in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) : @xmath0 , \\quad t>0 \\end{array}\\ ] ] ( in @xcite , ( [ eq : pp ] ) is supplemented with periodic boundary conditions ) .",
    "this equation models the evolution of a liquid thin film ( of height @xmath1 ) wetting a horizontal solid substrate which is subject to a gravity field and an electric field normal to the substrate .",
    "the term @xmath2 models the effects of the electric field on the thin film .",
    "the operator @xmath3 is a nonlocal elliptic operator of order @xmath4 which will be defined precisely later on ( for now , we can think of it as being the half - laplace operator : @xmath5 ) .",
    "when @xmath6 , it has a destabilizing effect ( it has the `` wrong '' sign ) .",
    "the term @xmath7 accounts for the effects of gravity , and it is also destabilizing when @xmath8 ( `` hanging film '' ) . in @xcite , it is proved that despite these destabilizing terms , positive smooth solutions of ( [ eq : pp ] ) do not blow up and remain bounded in @xmath9 for all time .    as mentioned above",
    ", there are many papers devoted to the study of thin film equations with destabilizing terms . in its simplest form ,",
    "the thin film equation reads : @xmath10 the existence of non - negative weak solutions for ( [ eq : tf ] ) was first established by f.  bernis and a.  friedman @xcite for @xmath11 , @xmath12 .",
    "further results ( existence for @xmath13 and further regularity results ) were later obtained , by similar technics , in particular by e. beretta , m. bertsch and r. dal passo @xcite and a. bertozzi and m. pugh @xcite .",
    "results in higher dimension were obtained in particular by grn in @xcite . the thin film equation with lower order destabilizing terms",
    "has also received a lot of interest . in particular in @xcite , the following equation @xmath14 is considered . such a destabilizing term ( which , unlike that of ( [ eq : pp ] ) , is a local term of order @xmath15 ) models , for instance , the effects of gravity for a hanging thin film , or van der waals type interactions with the solid substrate . in @xcite , the nonlinearities @xmath11 and @xmath16 are considered and it is proved ( among other things ) that there is no blow - up for @xmath17 . in @xcite , for @xmath18 and @xmath19 , it is proved that there is blow - up for @xmath20 and initial data in @xmath21 with negative `` energy '' .",
    "the reader is referred to @xcite for a precise statement .    in our equation ( [ eq : pp ] ) , the nonlinearities in front of the stabilizing and destabilizing terms are the same ( @xmath22 ) , but the destabilizing term is elliptic of order @xmath23 and is nonlocal in space .",
    "it is known ( see @xcite ) that positive smooth solutions of ( [ eq : pp ] ) do not blow up .",
    "the goal of the present paper is to prove the existence of global in time weak solutions for ( [ eq : pp ] ) .",
    "note that besides the existence of solutions , many important properties of the thin film equation ( [ eq : tf ] ) have been investigated ( finite speed of propagation of the support , waiting time phenomenon , existence of source - type solutions _ etc .",
    "the key tools in many of these studies are various delicate integral inequalities ( in particular the so - called @xmath24-entropy inequalities and local entropy and energy inequalities",
    ". see @xcite ) .",
    "it is not clear that similar functional inequalities holds for ( [ eq : pp ] ) .",
    "one reason is that the algebra involving the operator @xmath3 is considerably more difficult than that of the laplace operator .",
    "another reason , is the obvious difficulty in deriving local estimates ( due to the nonlocal nature of the operator @xmath3 ) .",
    "for that reason , we only address the existence issue in this paper .    as in @xcite , the main difficulty in proving the existence of solutions for ( [ eq : pp ] ) comes from the fact that the energy ( see ( [ eq : energy00 ] ) below ) can take negative values . in order to obtain @xmath9 a priori estimate ,",
    "one thus has to use the conservation of mass which , for non - negative solutions , gives a global in time @xmath25 bound for the solution ( see lemma [ lem : h1 ] ) .",
    "with such an estimate in hand , the existence of global in time solutions should follow from the construction of approximated solutions satisfying the right functional inequalities .",
    "typically , one needs to regularize the mobility coefficient @xmath26 .",
    "one way to proceed is to replace the coefficient @xmath26 with @xmath27 so that the equation becomes strictly parabolic .",
    "however , for such a regularized equation one can not show the existence of non - negative solutions ( the maximum principle does not hold for fourth order parabolic equations ) and lemma  [ lem : h1 ] is of no use .",
    "an alternative regularization is to replace the mobility coefficient @xmath26 with a function @xmath28 which satisfies in particular @xmath29 . for such ( more degenerate ) mobility coefficient",
    ", solutions are expected to be strictly positive and therefore smooth .",
    "this second regularization procedure was first suggested by bernis and friedman @xcite and is used in particular by bertozzi and pugh @xcite .",
    "however , the local in time existence for such a degenerate equation is not clear to us , since the corresponding proofs in @xcite rely on schauder estimates which are not classical ( and perhaps tedious ) with our non - local singular term @xmath3 . for this reason",
    ", we choose the first regularization approach ; this requires us to pay attention to the lack of positivity of the approximated solutions .",
    "in particular , the @xmath25 norm is not controlled , and the @xmath9 norm will be controlled by combining the energy inequality with the entropy inequality .",
    "the idea of combining the energy together with the entropy in order to get a lyapunov functional appeared previously in @xcite where a thin film equation with a nonlinear drift term is thouroughly studied in all dimensions .",
    "the main contribution of this paper is thus to introduce the precise functional analysis framework to be used to treat the term @xmath3 and to provide a method for constructing weak solutions satisfying the proper a priori estimates .    rather than working in the periodic setting",
    ", we will consider equation ( [ eq : pp ] ) on a bounded domain with neumann boundary conditions ( these neumann conditions can be interpreted as the usual contact angle conditions and seem physically more relevant - the periodic framework could be treated as well with minor modifications ) .",
    "further details about the derivation of ( [ eq : pp ] ) will be given in section [ sec : phys ] .",
    "since the gravity term is of lower order than the electric field term , it is of limited interest in the mathematical theory developed in this paper .",
    "we will thus take @xmath30 we thus consider the following problem : @xmath31 u_x=0 , \\ ; f(u ) ( u_{xx}-i(u))_x=0   & \\mbox { for } x\\in{\\partial}\\omega,\\quad t>0\\\\[3pt ] u(x,0)=u_0(x ) & \\mbox { for } x\\in\\omega .",

    "the operator @xmath40 is a non - local elliptic operator of order @xmath4 which will be defined precisely in section [ sec : pre ] as the square root of the laplace operator with neumann boundary conditions ( we have to be very careful with the definition of @xmath40 in a bounded domain ) .",

    ", we will see that the solution @xmath1 of satisfies two important integral inequalities : we define the energy @xmath41 and the entropy @xmath42 by @xmath43 where @xmath44 is a non - negative convex function such that @xmath45 .",

    "however , we see here the destabilizing effect of the nonlocal term @xmath3 : first , we note that as in @xcite the energy @xmath47 can be written as the difference of two non - negative quantities : @xmath48 and may thus take negative values . similarly , the entropy dissipation can be written as @xmath49 so the entropy may not be decreasing .",
    "nevertheless , it is reasonable to expect ( [ eq:0 ] ) to have solutions that exist for all times . indeed , as shown in @xcite , the conservation of mass , the inequality ( [ eq : nrj - intro ] ) and the following functional inequality ( see lemma  [ lem : h1 ] ) @xmath50 implies that non - negative solution remains bounded in @xmath51 for all time @xmath52 .",

    "the reason has to do with the proofs ; indeed , in contrast with @xcite , weak solutions given by theorem  [ thm : second ] are constructed as limits of the solutions given by theorem  [ thm : main ] .",
    "this is because the entropy is needed in order to construct the non - negative solutions .",
