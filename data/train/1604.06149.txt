    "the presence of the rashba soc results in beatings of the sdh oscillations even without any tilting of the magnetic field @xcite .",

    "the non - abelian theory is consistent with experiment while the abelian theory is not consistent .",
    "since the conclusions are based on our fits , a natural question which arises is ` how sensitive is the number of coincidences with respect to variation in our fitting parameters ? ' in fig.[s1 ] we show the response of the non - abelian prediction , eq.(7 ) , as the fitting parameters are varied .",
    "the layout and colour scheme are similar to fig.3 : the top panels show the theoretical phase and the experimental coincidence points for orientations of the external field @xmath227 ( red ) and @xmath228 ( green ) .",

    "the presented deviations are larger than those accepted in fig.3 .",
    "the curves corresponding to the lower boundaries of the parameters ( dotted lines ) are too far away from the experimental points . on the other hand the curves corresponding to the upper boundaries of the parameters ( dashed lines )",
    "demonstrate an additional coincidence point ( panels b , d , f ) which is not observed experimentally .",
    "this shows that the selected parameters , @xmath232 , provide the best fit to the data .",
    "the curves in fig.[s1 ] do not account for the dresselhaus interaction .",
    "there is no point to account for the interaction for purposes of the present analysis , since it hardly effects the red and green curves which are used to determine the fit parameters , and it does not change the number of coincidences .",
    "dresselhaus only deforms the blue curves in panels b , d , and f exactly in the same way as in the panel b of fig .",
    "3 . + a similar comparison for the abelian theory , eq.(8 ) , is presented in fig.[s2 ] , where once again the parameters @xmath233 are varied .",
    "the top panels show the theoretical phase @xmath85 and the experimental coincidence angles for orientations of the external field @xmath234 ( red ) and @xmath228 ( green ) .",
    "the bottom panels show the phase and the experimental coincidence points for the field orientation @xmath235 ( blue ) .",
    "solid lines in fig.[s2 ] are identical to that in fig.3c and 3d .",
    "[ h ! ]    in fig.[s2 ] panels a and b correspond to @xmath231 variation of @xmath230 , panels c and d correspond to @xmath231 variation of @xmath88 , and panels e and f correspond to @xmath229 variation of @xmath34 . despite the significant amount of variation in these parameters , the abelian theory always predicts three concidence angles for @xmath236 ( blue ) , whilst experimentally only one angle is observed .",
    "this discrepancy illustrates that the experimental data can not be reconciled with the paradigm of berry phases alone and renders our evidence for the non - abelian gauge field unambiguous .",
    "dresselhaus spin - orbit interaction arises due to the lack of inversion symmetry in the bulk gaas crystal .",
    "the interaction is cubic in the momentum @xmath35 and linear in the angular momentum @xmath237 , see ref .",
    "@xcite . in the coordinate system defined in fig.[fig2]a",
    "the leading term of the dresselhaus hamiltonian is @xmath238 where @xmath239ev@xmath240 , see ref.@xcite .",
    "we neglect the subleading terms cubic in @xmath241 . the transformation ( [ b1 ] ) to the co - rotating frame does not change ( [ dh3 ] ) .",
    "hence , in the co - rotating frame the dresselhaus interaction works as a weak periodic `` magnetic field '' superimposed on the constant `` magnetic field '' defined by eq.([po ] ) .",
    "the projection of the periodic `` field '' on the direction perpendicular to the direction of the constant `` field '' , @xmath242 generates spin flips . accounting for the resonant part of the periodic perturbation one finds that @xmath66 given by eq.([prefactor ] ) is replaced by @xmath243 , @xmath244 where @xmath245 without tilting , @xmath214 , the dresselhaus perturbation ( [ dh2 ] ) is zero , @xmath246 .",
    "hence , our back - gate tuning performed at @xmath214 does not compensate the dresselhaus interaction .",
    "the interaction becomes important at intermediate values of @xmath98 .",
    "the dashed curves in figs .",
    "3a , b display eq.([prefactor1 ] ) calculated with @xmath247 .",
    "we chose this value of @xmath248 to shift the coincidence angle in fig.3b from @xmath126 to @xmath249 .",
    "this is an additional fitting parameter . because of weakness of the dresselhaus interaction the dashed and the solid curves in fig.3a are practically indistinguishable . on the other hand , because of the resonance",
    ", the effect of the dresselhaus interaction in fig.3b is significant .",
    "we stress again the point made in the main text , the correct value of @xmath248 necessarily leads to the extended range of @xmath98 over which the phase of the sdh oscillation inverts , clearly seen in the blue traces in fig 2c .",
    "the value of @xmath248 can be also calculated using eq.([d0 ] ) . with @xmath250tesla and with parameters of the system discussed in the paper , eq.([d0 ] )",
    "gives @xmath251 .",
    "so , the dresselhaus interaction is weak and insignificant compared to the dominating magnetic field controlled spin orbit effects that drive the non - abelian berry phase .",
    "the strength of the dresselhaus interaction measured in our experiment is slightly smaller but comparable with theoretical estimates presented in refs.@xcite .",

    "<S> gauge theories , while describing fundamental interactions in nature , also emerge in a wide variety of physical systems . </S>",

    "<S> however , the non - abelian gauge field , while playing the most fundamental role in particle physics , up to now has remained a purely theoretical construction in many - body physics . in the present paper </S>",
    "<S> we report the first observation of a non - abelian gauge field in a spin - orbit coupled quantum system . </S>",
    "<S> the gauge field manifests itself in quantum magnetic oscillations of a hole doped two - dimensional ( 2d ) gaas heterostructure . </S>",
    "<S> transport measurements were performed in tilted magnetic fields , where the effect of the emergent non - abelian gauge field was controlled by the components of the magnetic field in the 2d plane .    </S>",
    "<S> gauge theories were originally conceived to describe elementary particles and their interactions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the concept of the emergent gauge field is relevant to a wide class of quantum systems whose initial formulation has no apparent relationship to gauge fields . </S>",
    "<S> such emergent gauge fields arise naturally in many geometrical contexts and the idea that physical systems can be classified according to their geometrical properties has become an overarching paradigm of modern physics . </S>",
    "<S> one example of an abelian gauge theory in this context is the berry phase @xcite , which is associated with the adiabatic evolution of a nondegenerate quantum state . </S>",
    "<S> the emergence of non - abelian gauge fields in degenerate quantum systems was first theoretically proposed by wilczek and zee @xcite shortly after the work of berry .    </S>",
    "<S> while abelian gauge fields have been observed in systems ranging from optical fibers @xcite and semiconductor rings @xcite to bose condensates of ultracold atoms @xcite , signs of non - abelian effects have so far only been observed in the nuclear quadrupole resonance of @xmath0cl in a single crystal of sodium chlorate @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> non - abelian gauge fields have been theoretically predicted in a number of many - body systems including fractional quantum hall liquids  @xcite , spin - orbit coupled systems  @xcite , cuprate superconductors  @xcite and ensembles of ultracold atoms  @xcite . in spite of the theoretical excitement and great interest all previous attempts to observe these fields were unsuccessful . </S>",
    "<S> this demonstrates the challenge involved in the experimental realization of emergent non - abelian gauge fields .    </S>",
    "<S> the idea of our experiment is partially based on previous theoretical work by arovas and lyanda - geller @xcite as well as murakami , nagaosa and zhang @xcite who proposed that effects relating to non - abelian gauge fields must be pronounced in hole - doped zinc blende semiconductors due to the strong spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) . in this context the gauge fields </S>",
    "<S> are closely associated with spin dynamics along curved trajectories : ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite proposed the use of mesoscopic rings to bend the trajectory , whilst ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite suggested use of an external electric field for the same purpose . in this work </S>",
    "<S> we use a 2d gaas hole - doped heterostructure in a relatively small ( fraction of a tesla ) magnetic field applied perpendicular to the 2d plane to curve the hole trajectories . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we apply an in - plane magnetic field ( @xmath1 several tesla ) , which allows us to control the magnitude of the spin - orbit coupling . </S>",
    "<S> the combination of the soc and curved trajectories makes the non - abelian gauge field observable . </S>",
    "<S> the perpendicular magnetic field gives rise to quantum magnetic oscillations which are influenced by non - abelian spin dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> we measure the oscillations via the shubnikov - de haas ( sdh ) effect . </S>",
    "<S> the sdh effect has been measured previously in numerous experiments with 2d systems with strong spin - orbit interaction , see e.g. refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite however in all previous studies , effects related to the non - abelian berry phase are negligible , and what is measured is simply the densities of the spin - split subbands . </S>",
    "<S> one needs very special conditions to distinguish between the abelian and the non - abelian berry phases , it is necessary to tune independently the spin precession , the orbital dynamics , and the spin - orbit interaction . </S>",
    "<S> to do so in our experiment we use the following crucial points . </S>",
    "<S> ( i ) we can tune the spin - orbit coupling over a wide range using the in - plane field @xmath2 while keeping the orbital dynamics fixed . ( ii ) </S>",
    "<S> we use a low symmetry crystal with highly anisotropic coupling to @xmath2 , which allows us to control independently the larmor and the spin precession frequencies . </S>",
    "<S> this is key to proving that the effects we observe can not be due to abelian physics , nor due to differences between datasets taken at different carrier densities , gate biases , or even from different samples . </S>",
    "<S> ( iii ) we use a device where we can minimise the undesirable rashba interaction , allowing a simple analytic theory to explain the data . </S>",
    "<S> these three factors allow us to report the first observation of the non - abelian gauge phase which was elusive for 30 years since its theoretical prediction .     </S>",
    "<S> c c c & & + & &    the spin dynamics of a particle moving around a circle in momentum space used in onsager quantization @xcite is illustrated in fig.[fig1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the three panels in this figure correspond to three qualitatively different situations : ( a ) spin dynamics being absent , ( b ) abelian spin dynamics and ( c ) non - abelian spin dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> the spin ( red arrows ) is driven by a local effective magnetic field @xmath3 ( blue arrows ) , which is the sum of the external magnetic field @xmath4 and the momentum - dependent spin - orbit field @xmath5 . panel ( a ) depicts the trajectory of a non - relativistic electron in the absence of spin - orbit . in this case @xmath6 and the spin is simply aligned with the external field . </S>",

    "<S> e.g. _ an electron in graphene or on the surface of a topological insulator . in this case , although spin is precessing , it remains aligned with the driving field which itself is parallel to the momentum , @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> the precession of spin around the orbit generates a geometric berry phase ( abelian gauge field ) which appears as the @xmath8-phase shift observed in magnetic oscillations @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> , the driving field @xmath3 is not collinear with spin and the noncollinearity is proportional to the non - abelian gauge field . due to the non - abelian spin dynamics , the particle acquires a matrix - valued phase equal to the circulation of the gauge field around the trajectory in momentum space . </S>",

    "<S> 3b , which completely removes the small disagreement between experimental and theoretical values of the coincidence angle .    </S>",
    "<S> of course , the inclusion of the dresselhaus interaction does not influence the number of coincidence angles , which is a very robust number . </S>",
    "<S> moreover the inclusion of the dresselhaus term explains why the single coincidence for @xmath135 is not sharp , but occurs over a much wider range of angles than for @xmath136 or @xmath137 ( seen as the slow phase inversion and small amplitude of the sdh oscillations in the range @xmath138 for blue traces in fig . </S>",

    "<S> overall , our data on the number of coincidences , supported by the slow phase flip of the sdh oscillations for @xmath135 , provide unambiguous evidence for the non - abelian gauge field .    </S>",
