    "this tendency , known as mass segregation , can be of different origin : initial mass segregation is sometimes considered ( e.g. murray & lin  1996 , bonnell & bate  2006 ) as a consequence of the formation of massive stars preferably in the densest regions ( i.e. the cores ) of the parent gas clouds . on the other hand ,",
    "the process of mass segregation is also known to be one of the most robust features of the two - body relaxation driven evolution of self - gravitating star clusters ( chandrasekhar  1942 , spitzer  1969 ) .",

    ". a multimass models of star cluster with exact energy equipartition in the core , which also leads to mass segregation , was introduced by miocchi  ( 2006 ) .",
    "another approach used e.g. by mcmillan & vesperini  ( 2007 ) relies on segregation produced by n - body integration of initially unsegregated systems towards the segregated state , i.e. it is equivalent to a simple redefinition of time @xmath1 .    in this paper",
    "we describe a new class of models of star clusters with continuous stellar mass distributions and a parametrised degree of mass segregation .",
    "the models are motivated by a study of the process of mass segregation during dynamical evolution of a self - gravitating cluster , which is briefly described in the following section .",
    "we show that mass segregation strongly manifests itself in the energy space . in section  [ sec : model ]",
    "we introduce convenient characteristics of a statistically described ensemble and derive their form for the unsegregated state .",
    "we further introduce in a heuristic manner an alternative , single - parameter form of these quantities that gives constraints on the distribution function of a mass segregated system .",
    "afterwards , we describe an algorithm for construction of the corresponding star cluster . in section  [ sec : tests ] we demonstrate the stability of the models by means of @xmath0-body integrations .",
    "finally , section  [ sec : conclusions ] contains our conclusions .",
    "the standard scenario of the dynamical evolution of an isolated cluster is shown in figure  [ fig : motivation ] .",
    "the cluster in this example is initiated as an unsegregated plummer model which is then integrated numerically with the nbody6 code ( aarseth 2003 ) .",
    "we consider 20000 stars with masses in the range @xmath2 following a power - law mass function with salpeter index @xmath3 .",
    "the stars are treated as point - mass particles interacting solely by means of gravity and , therefore , there is no intrinsic length - scale within the model .",
    "hence , we introduce a characteristic length- and time - scale : @xmath4{and } t_0 \\equiv r_0^{3/2 } / \\sqrt{gm_c } \\label{eq : scales}\\ ] ] by means of the cluster total mass , @xmath5 , and the integral of the equations of motion , the total energy , @xmath6 .",
    "the results can be scaled to any length scale , provided the identities ( [ eq : scales ] ) between @xmath7 and @xmath6 are fulfilled . for a plummer sphere , i.e. the initial state of the example model , the half - mass radius of the cluster is @xmath8 and @xmath9 corresponds to the crossing time . in the following",

    "this process is visible either in terms of the contraction of the inner lagrange radii , or in terms of a decrease of the specific potential energy of massive stars , @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the potential energy of the @xmath25-th star .",
    "compared to the latter quantity , the specific kinetic energy , @xmath26 , of the same subset of stars shows a less pronounced evolution . at time",
    "@xmath27 the cluster reaches the state of core collapse . from that point onward ,",
    "strong few - body interactions between the core stars occur , leading to the formation of massive binaries carrying a considerable fraction of the cluster potential energy and , at the same time , to high velocity ejections of massive stars .",
    "this process stops further contraction of the lagrange radii .",
    "however , the potential energy of the subset of massive stars continues to decrease .",
    "both the potential and the kinetic energy show large variations due to the dynamical formation and destruction of binaries during the post - core collapse phase ; the average kinetic energy of the massive stars starts to increase systematically due to the ejections .",

    "[ fig : motivation2 ] . as time proceeds ,",
    "the slope of the curve gets shallower , i.e. massive stars hold an increasing fraction of the potential energy . at core collapse , the dependence can be approximated by another power - law function .",
    "the apparent monotonical evolution of the potential energy of stars of different masses during the _ whole _ course of the cluster evolution motivates us to parametrise the mass segregation in energy rather than in configuration space .",
    "we consider an ensemble of @xmath0 particles of masses @xmath33 ; we further denote with @xmath34 the total mass of the cluster .",
    "the state of the system is determined by specifying @xmath0 positions , @xmath35 , and conjugate momenta , @xmath36 , which altogether form a vector in a @xmath37-dimensional phase space . for large @xmath0 such a ` clean ' state of the system",
    "is usually either not known or is not of particular interest .",
    "the system is then in a statistical sense conveniently characterised by means of a distribution function , @xmath38 , i.e. a probability density to find it in a particular state . for definiteness ,",
    "we assume @xmath39 to be normalised to unity .",
    "the mean value of an arbitrary physical quantity related to the system is obtained by integration over the whole phase space , @xmath40 with @xmath41 representing the phase space volume element .    specifying mean values of certain physical quantities",

    "we assume the mean total energy @xmath42 is given . restricting ourselves to systems in virial equilibrium",
    ", it follows that mean values of the total kinetic and potential energies are in balance , @xmath43 .",
    "we further assume that the system is characterised by the mean potential energy between each two particles ( @xmath44 ) , @xmath45 this quantity implies that the mean potential energy of the @xmath25-th particle is @xmath46 and the mean ` internal ' potential energy of a subset of particles is @xmath47 the latter quantity will play an important role in the algorithm described below . in order to be unique , definition ( [ eq : u_sub_i ] )",
    "requires specification of the order of the particles in the set .",
    "hence , we recall that we assume @xmath48 .    in order to take advantage of integral calculus",
    ", we will use replacements of summations : @xmath49 here , we use greek symbols to denote `` continuous summation index '' .",
    "the equivalence in ( [ eq : integral_trick ] ) can be understood as an analogy to the discrete increment @xmath50 , where @xmath51 .",
    "this trick introduces some error , in particular for small values of @xmath52 and @xmath53 and steep mass functions . nevertheless , it is useful to provide rather robust relations between individual quantities .",
    "a commonly used scheme for construction of a cluster in a completely mixed ( unsegregated ) state is based on uncorrelated drawing of positions , @xmath35 , and velocities , @xmath54 , of individual stars according to a mass - independent single - particle distribution function @xmath55 .",
    "this corresponds to the distribution function @xmath39 in the form @xmath56 with normalisation @xmath57 .",

    ", @xmath61 represents the characteristic radius of the plummer sphere and @xmath62 is the specific energy of an individual particle .",
    "regardless of the particular form of @xmath55 , from symmetries of the distribution function ( [ eq : d_plummer ] ) it directly comes out that the mean potential energy between two particles has to be a bilinear function of ( and only of ) their masses , @xmath63 the integral in ( [ eq : uij_plummer ] ) is an unknown constant @xmath64 which is independent of indices @xmath25 and @xmath65 .",
    "its value can be easily obtained by evaluation of @xmath66 , defined in  ( [ eq : u_sub_i ] ) , with the help of ( [ eq : integral_trick ] ) : @xmath67 for @xmath68 , i.e. @xmath69 , we require @xmath70 , which implies : @xmath71 for completeness , the mean potential energy of the @xmath25-th particle , defined by formula  ( [ eq : ui_def ] ) is @xmath72      from @xmath0-body models ( fig .",
    "[ fig : motivation ] ) we see that it is predominantly the _ potential _ energy which is transferred between the light and massive stars , while their average kinetic energy remains nearly unchanged during the course of the cluster evolution .",
    "hence , we will attempt to determine mass segregation in terms of mean potentials . in particular ,",
    "we assume the mean inter - particle potential in the form : @xmath73 and consider several limitations to the term @xmath74 :    it has to be symmetric with respect to the indices @xmath25 and @xmath65 .",
    "only then will the total potential energy of the cluster be independent of the order of summation ;    it has to be positive and decreasing with increasing values of indices @xmath25 and @xmath65 , so that massive stars ( with lower indices ) have lower specific potential energy ;    it should not depend explicitely on masses @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "otherwise , core collapse could not be obtained for a cluster of equal mass stars .",
    "one of the simplest forms that fulfils these requirements is : @xmath77 with @xmath78 being the _ index of mass segregation_. in analogy to ( [ eq : usub_plummer ] ) , formula ( [ eq : uij_msseg ] ) implies @xmath79 and @xmath80 clearly , @xmath81 corresponds to an unsegregated cluster while @xmath82 would lead to a sign inconsistency of the potential energy of individual particles and @xmath83 .",
    "hence , only @xmath84 should be considered as a reasonable value .",
    "the power - law form of @xmath85 is in accord with our motivation by the pre - core collapse evolutionary stages as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : motivation2 ] .      formula ( [ eq : uij_msseg ] ) gives constraints on the distribution function of the cluster , although it does not determine it explicitely .",
    "the constraints expressed in terms of @xmath66 can , however , be used to construct a corresponding star cluster by adding one by one the individual stars from the ordered set .",
    "the position of each added star is generated randomly ( with isotropically distributed orientation ) according to some ` underlying ' distribution function @xmath86 .",
    "the potential energy of the ( sub)cluster , @xmath31 , is calculated and compared with the desired mean value determined by eq .",
    "( [ eq : uij_msseg ] ) and ( [ eq : u_sub_i ] ) .",

    ", then we proceed to the next star in the set .",
    "otherwise , we generate another position of the @xmath25-th star , until the match is adequate .",
    "the method for construction of the cluster described here has to be considered as a way how to find _ some _ state conforming to the given @xmath0 constraints .",
    "hence , it is natural that the solutions do depend on the form of the underlying function used for generation of trial positions of added stars .",
    "the fewer trials are needed to find a matching position , the more likely is the final state close to a maximum of the distribution function @xmath39 . by estimating contributions to the potential energy by individual particles ( see appendix  [ sec : rp ] ) , we have found that a good underlying function ( that needs on average less than @xmath88 trials per particle ) is given by : @xmath89 with @xmath90 for @xmath91 corresponds to the density of a plummer model .",
    "notice , however , that only for @xmath81 , the underlying distribution function is equivalent to the radial density profile of the cluster .",
    "the relation between the underlying distribution and the density profile of the obtained cluster is nontrivial due to the selection mechanism based on the check of @xmath31 vs. @xmath66 in each step .      at the end of the above procedure",

    "we assign velocities to the stars such that the system is in a quasi - equilibrium state . as we assume the mean specific kinetic energy to be independent of the mass of the star , the distribution function of velocities has to be such that @xmath92 .",
    "furthermore , the velocity has to be corelated to the local gravitational potential , @xmath93 , e.g. it has to fulfil @xmath94 in order to get a gravitationally bound system .",
    "we are motivated by the standard construction of the velocity distribution of a plummer cluster ( e.g. aarseth , hnon & wielen  1974 ) , @xmath95 where @xmath96 is a random number drawn from the distribution function @xmath97 with mean square value , @xmath98 . in the case of our models ,",
