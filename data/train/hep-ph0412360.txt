    "up to now , cp violation is only found in the @xmath5-@xcite and @xmath6-system@xcite , which can be well explained within the standard model ( sm ) of electroweak interaction .",
    "as is well known , electric dipole moment ( edm ) of an elementary particle is a clear signature of cp violation .",
    "however , edm of a fermion does not appear up to two - loop order , and the three - loop contributions partially chancel among each others in the sm .",
    "therefore , observation of sizable edm of an elementary fermion would definitely be a signal of existence of new physics beyond the sm with extra cp phases .",
    "supersymmetry ( susy ) is now believed to be the most attractive scenario for new physics . beside the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) mechanism ,",
    "the soft breaking terms provide a new source of @xmath7 and flavor violation in the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model ( mssm ) .",
    "those @xmath7 violating phases can affect some important observables in the mixing of higgs bosons @xcite , the lepton and neutron electric dipole moments ( edms ) @xcite , lepton polarization asymmetries in the semi - leptonic decays @xcite , the production of @xmath8-wave charmonium and bottomonium @xcite , and @xmath7 violation in rare @xmath6-decays and @xmath9 mixing @xcite . at present , the strictest constraints on those @xmath7 violation phases originate from the lepton and neutron edms .",
    "since the lepton and neutron edms have not been measured so far , there are several suggestions to keep the theoretical estimate of the neutron and electron edms below the experimental limits , they are ( i ) choosing small cp phases @xmath10@xcite , ( ii ) finding appropriate parameter domain where various contributions cancel with each other@xcite , or ( iii ) making the first two generations of scalar fermions heavy enough ( heavier than 20 tev ) while keeping the soft masses of the third generation below tev to keep the higgs boson naturally light@xcite .    in this work",
    "we calculate the charm quark edm in the @xmath7 violating mssm . as pointed out in @xcite , the quark chromoelectric dipole moment ( cedm )",
    "makes important contributions to the quark edm at a low energy scale .",
    "in addition , there is a parameter space where some two - loop gluino diagrams provide important contributions to the quark edm . in our analysis",
    ", we include all the contributions from those pieces .",
    "we first work in the simplest model , neglecting the new possible flavor violation sources except the ckm mechanism , and avoiding any assumptions about unification of the soft breaking parameters .",
    "we find that the charm edm can reach about @xmath11 .",
    "then we also calculate the charm quark edm in the effective supersymmetry scenario@xcite where the scenario ( iii ) mentioned above is accommodated .",
    "since the first two - generation sfermions are very heavy , the charm quark edm is greatly suppressed in this scenario . however , while considering large mixing between the second and the third generation sfermions we find that the charm quark edm can be greatly enhanced to as large as about @xmath12 .",
    "the reason is that , since the effective operator which determines the charm quark edm induces a chiral flip , the large mixing between the scharm and stop can enhance the charm quark edm due to the top quark mass .    the analysis in refs .",
    "@xcite shows that the edm of heavy quark plays an important role in the direct production of singlet p - wave quarkonia , thus with upgraded bepc@xcite and cleo - c programs@xcite , it might be possible to produce the @xmath13p@xmath14 charmonium state , @xmath3 , directly .",
    "conversely , if no @xmath3 meson is observed , an upper bound on the charm quark edm would be set .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in the next section , we give the analytic expressions of the charm quark edm and cedm in @xmath7 violating mssm . in section iii we present the numerical results .",

    "the corresponding loop diagrams induce the charm edms .",
    "since quarks also take part in the strong interaction , the chromoelectric dipole moment ( cedm ) operator is @xmath17 where @xmath18 denote the generators of the strong @xmath19 gauge group and @xmath20 is the chromo - electromagnetic field strength .",

    "@xmath156 collected ) if no @xmath3 is observed , a rigorous constraint on the charm quark edm would be set , as @xmath157 . on the contrary",
    ", any signal of @xmath3 production will indicate large edm of the charm quark and becomes a clear evidence of new physics beyond the sm .",
    "the bepc - ii and cleo - c will provide excellent opportunities to probe many important theoretical objects . among them , the charm quark edm is a prominent one because it is a clear signal of cp violation and an evidence for new physics beyond the sm@xcite .",
    "our numerical results indicate that the direct production rate of @xmath3 at the vicinity of @xmath158@xcite may be dominated by the charm quark edm as long as new physics such as the mssm is involved .",
    "observation of @xmath3 thus produced would clearly indicate new physics beyond the sm , conversely , a negative result would set a rigorous constraint to the parameter space for the new physics .",
    "therefore we are looking forward to the new data of bepc - ii and cleo - c to help us gaining insight to the new physics beyond the sm .",
