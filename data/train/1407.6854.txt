    ", @xmath0 can depend upon system size and preparation protocols .",
    "for example , upon ordinary cooling to near or below its limit of stability , @xmath1k , liquid water will coarsen to ice on time scales as short as @xmath2s , while hyper quenching to temperatures well below @xmath3 at rates comparable to @xmath4k / s can produce long - lived glassy states.@xcite further , because no experiment can control all aspects of a nonequilibrium system , @xmath0 has a distribution of values for any one experimental protocol .",
    "recent experiments studying ice coarsening in droplets of cold water illustrate this fact.@xcite    dynamics of deeply supercooled water is heterogeneous , with domain sizes and time scales of growing as temperature , @xmath5 , decreases .",
    "viewed on small enough length scales and short enough time scales , at the coldest conditions of metastability ( i.e. , near @xmath3 ) , these fluctuations are large enough and slow enough to give the illusion of two distinct liquids.@xcite not surprisingly , all estimates of the imagined liquid - liquid critical temperature are close to @xmath3,@xcite but the fluctuations at this temperature are mesoscopic transients characteristic of ice coarsening , not criticality .",
    "the relevant relaxation time of the liquid , @xmath6 , is the time to equilibrate the liquid on length scale @xmath7 , where @xmath8 or 0.3 nm is the characteristic microscopic length of the liquid .",
    "this relaxation time is closely related to the metastable lifetime .",
    "specifically , for @xmath9 , the average and variance of @xmath6 and @xmath0 grow with decreasing temperature , but the ratio is @xmath10 throughout this regime.@xcite near presumed criticality , the time to equilibrate on length scale @xmath11 would be of order @xmath12 , where @xmath13.@xcite but as binder notes,@xcite @xmath14 because the liquid can not resist crystallization for times longer than @xmath0 .",

    "thus , for a three - dimensional system grown proportionally in each direction , the interfacial free energy , @xmath19 , must grow as @xmath18 where @xmath17 is the number of molecules in the simulation box .",
    "s conclusion that their model exhibits a stable interface is based entirely upon showing that four data points as a function of @xmath18 fall on a straight line to a good approximation .",
    "but the system sizes they consider extend over only a factor of three .",
    "such a small range is inadequate , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] by least - square fitting the four data points with two different lines .",
    "both a linear function of @xmath17 and a linear function of @xmath18 appear to provide satisfactory fits of the data .",
    "thus , it is impossible from the data provided to discern whether or not there is a stable interface .",
    "other phenomena could be equally or more consistent with the data .",
    "for example , finite transient domains could produce a @xmath19 that is initially linear in @xmath17 and becomes independent of @xmath17 at large @xmath17 .    in cases where a first - order phase transition is for certain ( e.g. , between liquid water and ice ) ,",
    "surface scaling can be safely presumed and used to estimate surface tension .",
    "see , for example , ref .  .",
    "but such a presumption is inappropriate for cases where the transition itself is in question .",
    "the free energy @xmath19 is the reversible work to prepare an interface at conditions of coexistence .",
    "it is essentially the height of the barrier in a bistable free energy as a function of order parameter , which in this case would be the density @xmath20 .",

    "[ fig : fig2]b , if the interface were stable , there would be little free energy difference between the pictured configuration and a similar configuration with somewhat thicker red ( or blue ) regions .",
    "the only curvature at the barrier top should be due to the effects of finite size on fluctuations of the interface , and the barrier top should become flatter as the system size grows.@xcite    the implication of these features is that the stated error bar largely underestimates the uncertainty and likely error in @xmath19 . to the extent curvature at the barrier top",
    "is nonzero , there must be deviations from @xmath18 scaling of the surface energy .",
    "the unusual shape of the reported low - density basin suggests that the simulation is trapped in an irreversible state , possibly a glassy configuration .",

    "either symptom of irreversibility would then be addressed by further sampling .",

    "this method is provided by a standard software package for implementing free energy calculations.@xcite it is a reliable error - estimate method provided sampling can be demonstrated to be reversible , which is most easily accomplished if there are no slow variables other than those being controlled in the free energy calculation .",
    "otherwise , `` bootstrap '' estimates can be misleading .",
    "the fact that supercooled water can be trapped into nonequilibrium glassy states implies that there are many slow degrees of freedom beyond density , @xmath20 , and global order parameter , @xmath24 .",

    "kinetics enters the picture only to the extent that irreversible dynamics persists in affecting the computed work functions .",
    "there is an infinity of ways by which irreversibility can poison a free energy calculation .",
    "reference   by limmer and chandler offers the proposition that apparent bistability often detected by several groups studying supercooled water is the result of slow equilibration of @xmath24 .",

    "red and blue lines are , respectively , the @xmath20 and @xmath24 autocorrelation functions in different windows sampled during free energy calculations of ref .  .",
    "the functions for two specific windows are shown in the upper two panels , where @xmath26 and @xmath27 values specify the averages of the density and global order parameter in the specific window .",

    "yields the black solid and dashed lines in the bottom panel .",
    "the averaged functions are distinct from equilibrium time - correlation functions , but rather illustrate the typical differences between relaxation of @xmath20 and @xmath24 that must be accounted for to obtain the reversible work surface in @xmath20-@xmath24 space.,width=336 ]    this idea is explored by computing the conditional probability distribution for @xmath20 given a specific value of @xmath24 , @xmath28 . averaging this distribution with the equilibrium distribution for @xmath24 yields the correct equilibrium free energy ,",

    "palmer _ _ et al.__@xcite disagree with this explanation of their earlier results , saying that a time - scale separation between @xmath20 and @xmath24 does not exist .",

    "first , the limmer - chandler analysis@xcite is based upon a time - scale separation in the normal high - density region of supercooled water while ref",

    "second , it seems that ref .",
    "incorrectly estimates pertinent relaxation times .",

    "claims to compute free energy functions by sampling over time scales that are hundreds of times longer than the relaxation time scale for @xmath24 , and it further reports that unconstrained trajectories running for such times show no hint of crystallization .",
    "such claims contradict findings from 1 @xmath31s molecular dynamics trajectories that exhibit ice coarsening.@xcite the structural relaxation time for a high - density st2 liquid at the conditions examined is about @xmath32ps , and the relaxation time for @xmath24 is about @xmath33ps.@xcite one - hundred times longer would reach @xmath4ps , where completed coarsening of the supercooled st2 model is both observed@xcite and predicted to be observable.@xcite    it can be difficult to identify absolute physical time scales from a monte carlo calculation , such as those carried out for ref .  , but correlation functions can be studied as functions of computation time or monte carlo steps .",

    "in actuality , the predictions from the st2 calculations in ref .",
    "are in reasonable accord with what can be deduced from experiment , assuming weber and stillinger s estimate of the low - pressure melting temperature is correct .",
    "in particular , because it is presumed to be 300k , the temperature scale for the st2 model can be imagined to be shifted by about 27k from experiment . with that shift , the experimentally determined phase coexistence line between liquid water and ice i provides an estimate of that for the st2 model .",
    "the high - pressure portion of that line , @xmath47kbar , is an extrapolation into a regime where ice i is metastable with respect to other ice phases .",
    "the equation of state of feistela and wagner is used to make that extrapolation , assuming that equation of state remains reliable beyond the regime for which it was derived . by comparing the extrapolated experimental line with the st2 estimates in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5]b , it appears that that both ref .   and ref .",
    "do equally well ( or poorly ) in locating coexistence points for the st2 model of water .",

    "predict a value of 66j / mol , whereas the correct value is an order of magnitude larger .",
    "in actual fact , the best estimate from the numerical data of ref .   is about 400j / mol .",
    "this estimate uses the st2a variant and the assumption that all variants will give about the same chemical potential differences .",

    "have presented in their new publication.@xcite lack of evidence for @xmath18 scaling in surface free energy is demonstrated .",
    "signatures of poor equilibration are identified , the most likely explanation being that palmer _ et al .",
    "_ s low - density amorphous basin reflects not a low - density liquid , but rather one or more of the low - density states that can contribute to the non - equilibrium glassy states of water .",
    "finally , criticisms of ref .",
    "are shown to be erroneous .    the main result in contention  whether a small enough simulation cell of st2 water exhibits bistability at supercooled conditions  is not an issue of possible errors in force - field evaluation or algorithm implementation .",
    "such sources of confusion have been checked against years ago , as has been noted in ref .  .",
    "rather , disagreement about two - liquid - like bistability is based upon the issue of equilibration or reversibility . indeed ,",
