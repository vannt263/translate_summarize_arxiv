    "in a system of classical charges the interactions are mediated through the electromagnetic field . in the case when the velocities of the particles are small with respect to the speed of light , it is possible , loosely speaking , to expand their dynamics in powers of @xmath8 .    the qualitative picture which emerges has three main features . up to terms of order",
    "@xmath9 , the dynamics of the particles are still of hamiltonian form .",
    "moreover ,    * at leading order , @xmath10 , the retardation effects can be neglected and the particles interact through an instantaneous pair potential ; * at order @xmath6 , the particles acquire an effective mass , due to the contribution of the electromagnetic mass and , to take into account the retardation effects , one has to add to the potential a velocity - dependent term ( the so - called darwin term ) .    including the terms of order @xmath9 , the dynamics are not hamiltonian anymore , instead    * there is dissipation of energy through radiation . in the dipole approximation ,",
    "the rate of emitted energy is proportional to the acceleration of a particle squared .",
    "a formal derivation of this picture , which does not consider the problem of mass renormalization , can be found in @xcite .",
    "a mathematical analysis in the framework of the abraham model , i.  e. , for charges which have a rigid charge distribution , is given in @xcite @xcite .",
    "the above description is expected to remain true also for nonrelativistic quantum electrodynamics , where , neglecting the possibility of pair creation , one considers a system of @xmath0 nonrelativistic particles interacting with the quantized maxwell field . in physical terms , the particles carry now a cloud of virtual photons , which makes them heavier , and interact exchanging them or dissipate energy through photons travelling freely to infinity .",
    "however , in quantum mechanics one describes the interaction of charged particles in good approximation by introducing instantaneous pair potentials and without treating the field as dynamical variable .",
    "if the particles move sufficiently slowly this is known to be a very good approximation .",
    "one goal of our paper is the mathematical derivation of quantum mechanics from a model of particles that are coupled to a quantized field , but do not interact directly .    instead of nonrelativistic qed",
    "we consider the massless nelson model , which describes @xmath0 spinless particles ( which will be called `` electrons '' ) coupled to a scalar bose field of zero mass ( whose excitations will be called `` photons '' ) . in spite of the simplifications introduced",
    ", this model is expected to retain the main physical features of the original one .",
    "therefore , since its introduction by nelson @xcite , who analyzed its ultraviolet behavior , it has been extensively studied to get information about the spectral and scattering features of qed , mostly concerning its infrared behavior ( not pretending to be exhaustive , some papers related to this aspect are @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the recent monograph by spohn @xcite contains detailed descriptions of the classical and the quantum mechanical models and results .",
    "in this paper we define and analyze the dynamics of dressed electron states in the nelson model in the limit of small particle velocities . loosely speaking",
    "a dressed electron is a bare electron dragging with it a cloud of `` virtual '' photons .",
    "we show that the dynamics of dressed electrons have the features discussed above : an instantaneous pair interaction at leading order @xmath5 and a renormalized mass together with the velocity - dependent darwin interaction at order @xmath11 .",
    "we also provide an analogue to the classical larmor formula for the radiated energy , i.e.  for the energy carried away by `` real '' photons travelling freely to infinity ( the heuristic concept of `` real '' and `` virtual '' photons will be made precise below ) .",
    "it is important to note that we consider the massless nelson model with an ultraviolet cutoff but _ no infrared cutoff_. indeed , the leading order effective dynamics were already analyzed in @xcite assuming an infrared regularization .",
    "one expects , and we will show it in this paper , that the dynamics of the dressed electrons even at higher orders are essentially independent of an infrared regularization , but the radiation is instead very sensitive to it , which makes the mathematical analysis much more delicate .    to explain in more detail the kind of scaling we are interested in it is convenient to look first at the classical case .",
    "the classical equations of motion for @xmath0 particles with positions @xmath12 , mass @xmath13 and a rigid `` charge '' distribution @xmath14 coupled to a scalar field @xmath15 with propagation speed @xmath2 are @xmath16    we assume for simplicity that @xmath17 where the form factor @xmath18 gives rise to a sharp ultraviolet cutoff , @xmath19    taking formally the limit @xmath20 in , we get the poisson equation for the field , and so , eliminating the field from , we obtain equations of motion describing @xmath0 particles interacting through smeared coulomb potentials .",
    "mass renormalization does not appear at the leading order .    instead of taking @xmath20",
    ", we regard as more natural to explore the regime of particle properties which gives rise to effective equations . indeed ,",
    "if we look at _ heavy particles _ for _ long times _ , i.  e. , if we substitute @xmath21 and @xmath22 in and , we find that , up to rescaling , the limit @xmath23 is equivalent to the limit @xmath20 .",
    "after quantization however , the two limiting procedures are not equivalent anymore .",
    "the case @xmath20 was analyzed by davies @xcite and by hiroshima @xcite , who at the same time removed the ultraviolet cutoff , applying methods from the theory of the weak coupling limit . in this paper",
    "we analyze the limit @xmath23 .",
    "we define now briefly the massless nelson model ( whose presentation will be completed in section [ nelsonmodel ] ) , we state our main results and the principal ideas of the proof and then compare them to the above mentioned weak coupling limit .",

    "the state space of the combined system particles @xmath44 field is @xmath45 and its time evolution is generated by the hamiltonian @xmath46 with domain @xmath47 which is a hilbert space with the graph norm associated to @xmath48 .",
    "note that there are no direct forces acting between the particles , all the interactions are mediated through the field .",
    "our goal is to understand the dynamics of the particles for times of order @xmath49 .",
    "it is necessary to look at long times in order to see nontrivial dynamics of the particles , because , since their mass is of order @xmath50 and we consider states of finite kinetic energy , their velocity is of order @xmath51 .",
    "however , since the coupling between the electrons and the field is _ not _ small , standard perturbation theory is of no use initially .",
    "indeed , since the charge of the particles is of order one , the local deformation of the field , i.  e.  the `` cloud of virtual photons '' , is of order one .",
    "however , the influence of real photons with finite energy and momentum on the dynamics of the heavy electrons , whose mass is of order @xmath52 , is small .",
    "hence one expects that the coupling between properly defined dressed electron states and real photons is small . to make this precise ,",
    "we construct a dressing transformation @xmath53 , which allows us to define the dressed particle states as follows . in the new representation",
    "the vacuum sector @xmath54 of @xmath55 corresponds to states of dressed electrons without real photons , while in the original hilbert space a state of dressed electrons with @xmath33 real photons would be a linear combination of states of the form @xmath56 recall that @xmath35 denotes the projector on the @xmath33-particles subspace of fock space , then the projector on the subspace corresponding to dressed electrons with @xmath33 real photons is @xmath57 in a nutshell , the main results we prove are the following : the subspaces @xmath58 are approximately invariant under the dynamics generated by @xmath59 for times of order @xmath49 . for states inside such a subspace the dynamics of the particles can be described by an effective hamiltonian for the particles alone on the above time scale and with errors of order @xmath60 .",
    "finally we can compute the leading order part of the state which leaves the subspace @xmath61 under the time evolution , which corresponds to emission of real photons . the formula for the energy of the real photons traveling to infinity , i.e.  the radiated energy , yields a quantum mechanical analogue of the classical larmor formula for the radiation of accelerated charges .    before we can state our results in detail ,",
    "we need to explain the adiabatic structure of the problem in some detail .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath59 is the perturbation of a fibered hamiltonian , because , since @xmath62 depends only on the configuration @xmath63 of the @xmath41th particle , the operator @xmath64 acts on @xmath36 for every fixed @xmath65 .",
    "this means that @xmath66    note the structural similarity with the born - oppenheimer approximation .",

    "@xmath71 becomes an eigenvalue of @xmath67 if the total charge of the @xmath0 particles system is equal to zero , as it happens for example in presence of an infrared cutoff . in this case , it is possible to build for every @xmath79 a unitary operator , @xmath80 , called the _ dressing operator _ , which diagonalizes @xmath67 in the sense that @xmath81    exploiting this remark , we approximate the time evolution generated by @xmath59 in two steps . first we define an infrared regular hamiltonian , @xmath82 , where the form factor @xmath83 ( equation ) is replaced by @xmath84    ( see proposition [ approxsigma ] ) let @xmath85 be the space of bounded linear operators from @xmath86 to @xmath55 equipped with the operator norm .",
    "it holds then that @xmath87 where @xmath88 with the corresponding graph norm .    choosing @xmath89 as a power of @xmath90 we",
    "can then replace the original dynamics with infrared regular ones .",
    "the latter contain however two parameters , @xmath90 and @xmath89 , therefore it is necessary to control the behavior of all the quantities that appear with respect to both .",
    "the advantage is that for @xmath82 we can build an approximate dressing operator @xmath91 , acting on the whole hilbert space @xmath55 , which is defined for every positive @xmath89 , but whose limit when @xmath92 does not exist if the system has a total charge different from zero .",
    "@xmath91 is unitary and can be expanded in a series of powers of @xmath90 , with coefficients which are _ at most logarithmically divergent _ in @xmath89 .",
    "moreover , the zero order coefficient is given by @xmath93 , the dressing operator associated to the infrared regular fibered hamiltonian , which has therefore the property that @xmath94    using @xmath91 , we define the transformed hamiltonian @xmath95 which can be expanded in a series of powers of @xmath90 in @xmath96 , with coefficients which are also at most logarithmically divergent in @xmath89 . thus the gain in switching to the representation defined by @xmath91 is twofold .",
    "first we can easily separate dressed electrons from real photons and second we can expand the hamiltonian in powers of the small parameter @xmath90 and thereby separate different physical effects according to their order of magnitude .",
    "the first result we find is that , even though the fibered hamiltonian has no eigenvalues and no spectral gap , there are _ approximate @xmath33-photons dressed subspaces _ which are almost invariant for the dynamics .",

    "it is a well - known fact however , that the decoupling becomes poorer and poorer when the kinetic energies and thus the velocities of the heavy particles grow .",
    "the quadratic dispersion relation for the electrons allows them to become arbitrarily fast , therefore the decoupling holds uniformly just on states of bounded kinetic energy .",
    "this is the reason why we introduce a uniform bound on the total energy of the system through the function @xmath102 , which obviously implies a bound on the kinetic energy of the electrons .    for the following we fix the function @xmath98 in some way compatible with , say @xmath103 .",

    "an adiabatic theorem without gap for the liouvillian ( the generator of the dynamics of the states in a suitable representation of the von neumann algebra associated to the system ) is discussed in @xcite , while in @xcite a general time - adiabatic theorem for resonances is proved .",
    "all these results are of the first order type , i.  e. , they describe the leading order adiabatic evolution and give upper bounds for the transitions .    in our case instead , we build adiabatic dynamics including terms of the second order , and give an explicit expression for the non - adiabatic transitions , which allows us to give also a lower bound for them . in the time - dependent case , lower bounds for the transitions were calculated by avron and elgart @xcite for the friedrichs model , which describes a `` small system '' , whose hilbert space is one - dimensional , interacting with a `` reservoir '' , whose hilbert space is @xmath142 , with a suitable spectral density @xmath143 .    finally let us compare our results with those obtained by davies @xcite .",
