    "the study of one - particle motion in spheroidal potentials , which is the basis for the understanding of deformed nuclei , started in the fifties @xcite . in particular , the work by s. g. nilsson @xcite played an important role for years in providing the basis for the classification of experimental data on the spectra of stable odd - a deformed nuclei @xcite .",
    "since the nucleon separation energy in stable nuclei is 7 - 10 mev , the spectroscopic analysis around the ground state of those nuclei has been successfully performed in terms of harmonic - oscillator wave - functions .",
    "in contrast , the recent study of nuclear structure close to the neutron drip line points out the unique role of weakly - bound neutrons with small angular momentum @xmath0 and the importance of coupling to the nearby continuum of unbound states . due to the absence of the coulomb barrier ,",
    "weakly - bound neutrons with small @xmath0 have an appreciable probability to be outside the core nucleus .",
    "thus , those neutrons are insensitive to the strength of the potential provided by the well - bound nucleons in the system . in particular",
    ", the behavior of s@xmath4 neutrons is an extreme example due to the absence of the centrifugal barrier for the @xmath0=0 orbit , compared with weakly - bound large @xmath0 neutrons , of which wave functions stay mostly inside the potential .",
    "the @xmath7 dependence of the height of the centrifugal barrier affects sharply the presence ( or absence ) of one - particle resonant levels at a given positive energy . taking spheroidal woods - saxon potentials ,",
    "the properties of both weakly - bound neutron orbits and one - neutron resonant levels are studied in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "there have been a number of self - consistent hartree - fock ( hf ) calculations of light neutron - rich nuclei , in many of which deformed hf solutions are indeed obtained .",
    "( as a classic work we may mention ref . @xcite . ) however , almost all those calculations are done either using the expansion in terms of harmonic oscillator bases or confining the system in a finite box . to our knowledge",
    ", no deformed hf calculation is yet available , which is carried out by integrating in mesh of space coordinate with proper asymptotic behavior for @xmath8 , at which the nuclear potential is negligible .",
    "if deformed hf calculations are carried out in the latter way , the numerical results are totally independent of the values of @xmath9 and , furthermore , it becomes possible to estimate one - particle resonant levels without any ambiguity .",
    "the effective interactions to be used in hf calculations of nuclei far away from the stability line are not yet properly fixed .",
    "thus , if the interaction chosen is not appropriate for those nuclei away from the stability line , the answer is not reliable .",
    "moreover , one hf solution gives one self - consistent deformation , which is determined by the two - body interaction selected , assuming that all technical problems in obtaining hf solutions are solved .",
    "thus , it is not easy either to pin down the origin of the deformation obtained or to evaluate the ambiguity coming from the choice of the two - body interaction .    in the analysis of observed spectroscopic properties of light neutron - rich nuclei with weakly - bound neutrons",
    "the shell model is so far used in most cases .",
    "the shell model should be applicable to those nuclei , if the configuration space is sufficiently large and the weakly - bound particles are properly treated .",
    "the latter condition is usually not satisfied , since harmonic - oscillator wave - functions in a limited space are used in most cases .",
    "the work summarized in ref .",
    "@xcite is an exception among the calculations that can be systematically compared with experiments , however , the complicated calculations have so far been carried out only for the helium and oxygen isotopes . in any case",
    ", some physically interesting quantities such as one - particle energies ( or shell structure ) or nuclear shape ( or deformation ) are not directly obtained from shell - model calculations .    recognizing how useful it was to have nilsson diagrams in the study of stable deformed nuclei @xcite , which are constructed using modified oscillator potentials , in this paper we present some `` nilsson diagrams '' that are relevant especially to some light neutron - rich nuclei towards the neutron - drip - line .",
    "taking the woods - saxon potentials with the parameters adjusted to some particular nuclei , both bound and resonant one - neutron levels are calculated as a function of quadrupole deformation .",
    "the change of nuclear shell - structure for neutrons is seen in both negative and positive one - particle energies of the nilsson diagrams .",
    "the change comes from the unique behavior of neutron orbits with small @xmath0 values , in particular @xmath0=0 and 1 .",
    "the modified shell - structure has direct relevance to the ground and low - lying states of neutron - drip - line nuclei , in which weakly - bound neutrons are present .",
    "considering the possible absence of many - body pair - field in light nuclei , the study of the present type of nilsson diagrams can definitely help us to understand the origin of possible deformation and the related spectroscopic properties of light neutron - drip - line nuclei .    in sect .",
    "ii some points of our model are summarized , while numerical results are presented in sect .",
    "iii . conclusions and discussions are given in sect .",
    "the occupancy of weakly - bound one - particle levels has a contribution especially to the tail of the self - consistent potentials .",
    "however , even for light nuclei presently considered the number of weakly - bound neutron(s ) is much smaller than that of well - bound core nucleons .",
    "namely , the major part of the nuclear potential is provided by well - bound nucleons .",
    "thus , for simplicity , the parameters of woods - saxon potentials are taken from the standard ones @xcite for stable nuclei except for the depth , @xmath10 .",
    "namely , the diffuseness , the strength of spin - orbit potentials and the radius parameter are taken from those on p.239 of ref .",
    "the depth is adjusted so that a particular one - neutron level obtains a given desirable binding - energy in respective examples .    the way in which bound one - particle levels are calculated is described in ref .",
    "@xcite , while the eigenphase formalism that is used to estimate one - particle resonant levels for a deformed potential is given in refs .",
    "the essential point is : the coupled equations obtained from the schrdinger equation are solved in coordinate space with the correct asymptotic behavior of wave functions for @xmath11 .",
    "the solution obtained in this way is totally independent of the upper limit of radial integration , @xmath9 , if both the potential and the coupling term are already negligible at @xmath8 .",
    "one - particle resonant energy for @xmath12 is defined as the energy , at which one of eigenphases increases through @xmath13 as energy increases . in the limit of @xmath14",
    "this definition in the eigenphase formalism is in agreement with the definition of one - particle resonance in spherical potentials described in text books @xcite ; the phase shift increases through @xmath15/2 as energy increases .",
    "one - particle resonance is not obtained if none of calculated eigenphases do not increase through @xmath13 as energy increases .",
    "for example , we have no corresponding resonance in the case that a calculated eigenphase starts to decrease before reaching @xmath13 as energy increases . even if one fails to obtain one - particle resonance defined in terms of eigenphase , for a certain small region of energy just after the disappearance of resonance the concentration of the wave functions inside the potential",
    "may still be found .",
    "however , the concentration will easily disappear after a short time if a resonance is no longer obtained in the eigenphase formalism .",
    "this situation is analogous to the case of the spherical potential , in which the phase shift starts to decrease before reaching @xmath15/2 as energy increases @xcite .",
    "compared with the nilsson diagram based on modified oscillator potentials , the striking difference of the level scheme obtained in the present work comes from the behavior of levels with low @xmath0 values ( in particular , @xmath0=0 and 1 ) for @xmath16=0 and those with small @xmath17 values ( mainly @xmath18 = 1/2@xmath19 , 1/2@xmath20 and 3/2@xmath20 ) for @xmath12 , in both the weakly - bound and positive - energy region .",
    "note that the minimum @xmath0 value of possible components of @xmath21 = 1/2@xmath22 , 1/2@xmath23 and 3/2@xmath23 levels is equal to 0 , 1 and 1 , respectively .",
    "the absence of the centrifugal barrier for the @xmath0=0 channel produces the unique behavior of weakly - bound and positive - energy @xmath21 = 1/2@xmath22 orbits .",
    "however , we find that some @xmath24 resonant levels survive in a higher - energy region ( see , for example , the [ 200 1/2 ] level in fig .",
    "1 ) , if the relative probability of s@xmath4 component inside the potential is smaller than a certain critical value @xcite .",
    "since the height of the centrifugal barrier becomes lower for a larger nuclear radius , the unique behavior of @xmath0=1 components will be more easily seen in nuclei with larger mass .",
    "taking @xmath2540.0 mev and the radius parameter for a=17 , at @xmath26 in fig .",
    "1 we obtain @xmath27 kev and @xmath28(2s@xmath4 ) = @xmath29 kev .",
    "the resonant energy of the 1d@xmath6 level is 5.60 mev .",
    "the near degeneracy of the 1d@xmath3 and 2s@xmath4 levels compared to the high - lying 1d@xmath6 level exhibits that for the spherical shape the neutron number n=16 may behave like a magic number . for @xmath12 the s@xmath4 , d@xmath6 , d@xmath3 , g@xmath5 and g@xmath30 channels are included in the calculation of positive - parity levels , while the p@xmath4 , p@xmath6 , f@xmath3 and f@xmath5 channels for negative - parity levels .",
    "the parameters are chosen approximately for neutrons in the nucleus @xmath31c@xmath32 , since the observed neutron separation energy of @xmath33c is @xmath34730 kev and the nucleus is presumably prolately deformed . examining the nilsson diagram in fig .",
    "1 , it is easily imagined that a few neutrons occupying the weakly - bound almost - degenerate 1d@xmath3 - 2s@xmath4 shells at @xmath26 may prefer to being deformed in order to gain the total energy ( jahn - teller effect ) .",
    "this may be the case of neutrons in @xmath35c , of which the neutron separation energy is small .",
    "it is also noticed that the observed ground states of @xmath31c@xmath32 and @xmath36c@xmath37 with @xmath38 3/2@xmath19 and 1/2@xmath19 , respectively , may be in a natural way interpreted as the band - heads of the intrinsic [ 211 3/2 ] and [ 211 1/2 ] configurations for prolate deformation , when the level scheme in the nilsson diagram is applied to those nuclei .",
    "for some experimental evidence for the deformation of those c - isotopes , see for example @xcite .    the [ 220 1/2 ] resonant level",
    "is not obtained for @xmath39 and @xmath40 mev , because the predominant component of the [ 220 1/2 ] wave function inside the nuclear radius is s@xmath4 and thus decays very quickly @xcite . due to the same reason , the continuation of the [ 200 1/2 ] resonant level can not be found for @xmath41 and @xmath42 mev , while for smaller @xmath16 values the predominant component of the [ 200 1/2 ] level inside the nuclear radius is d@xmath6 and thus the resonant level is sufficiently well defined .    in order to illustrate the near degeneracy of the 2s@xmath4 and 1d@xmath3 levels at @xmath16=0 in fig . 1 , in fig .",
    "2 the energy eigenvalues of woods - saxon potentials are shown , which are obtained by varying the depth while keeping other parameters the same as in fig .",
    "1 . the 2s@xmath4 level crosses with the 1d@xmath3 level for @xmath43 slightly smaller than 40 mev . for reference , the value of @xmath10 that is obtained by applying eq .",
    "( 2 - 182 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite to @xmath31c@xmath32 is @xmath3441.3 mev .    if a larger diffuseness , @xmath44 fm , is used in fig .",
    "1 keeping other parameters of the woods - saxon potential unchanged , for @xmath16=0 the 2s@xmath4 level appears lower than the 1d@xmath3 level .",
    "nevertheless , in the region of an appreciable size of deformation the structure of the nilsson diagram coming from the 2s@xmath4 and 1d@xmath3 levels remains approximately the same .",
    "taking @xmath2540.0 mev , in fig .",
    "3 the nilsson diagram for neutrons is plotted for the radius appropriate for a=31 .",
    "for the parameters of fig .",
    "3 the 2s@xmath4 level for @xmath16=0 is well - bound and , therefore , it lies approximately in the middle of the 2d@xmath3 and 2d@xmath6 levels , just as obtained from the level scheme in the modified oscillator potential @xcite , but in contrast to the near degeneracy of the 2s@xmath4 - 1d@xmath3 levels shown in fig .",
    "1 . for @xmath12 the s@xmath4 , d@xmath6 , d@xmath3 , g@xmath5 and g@xmath30 channels",
    "are included in the calculation of positive - parity levels , while the p@xmath4 , p@xmath6 , f@xmath3 , f@xmath5 , h@xmath30 and h@xmath45 channels for negative - parity levels .",
    "the value of @xmath10 is chosen so that the spin - parities of the ground state of nuclei @xmath46mg@xmath47 and @xmath48mg@xmath49 , 1/2@xmath19 @xcite and 3/2@xmath20 @xcite , respectively , are obtained for @xmath50 @xcite , which may be identified as the band - heads of the [ 200 1/2 ] and [ 321 3/2 ] configurations with observed energies of about @xmath342 mev .",
    "the 1f@xmath5 resonant level at @xmath16=0 is obtained at @xmath51=1.59 mev .",
    "in contrast , the 2p@xmath6 and 2p@xmath4 resonant levels are not obtained , while the trace of the 2p@xmath6 resonant level is expected to lie below the 1f@xmath5 resonant level ( see fig .",
    "nevertheless , the energy is too high for the existence of a resonance with @xmath0=1 .",
    "the complicated behavior of the energies of the @xmath21 = 1/2@xmath20 and 3/2@xmath20 levels for @xmath52 and below 2 mev in fig .",
    "3 indicates the influence of the 2p@xmath6 and 2p@xmath4 levels which do not appear as resonant states around @xmath16=0 . or , more exactly speaking , taking the @xmath53 level expressed by the dotted curve as an example , the slope in the region of @xmath540.3 indicates the 2p@xmath6 level at @xmath16=0 lying lower than the 1f@xmath5 level , while the slope for @xmath55 suggests the 2p@xmath4 level at @xmath16=0 lying higher than the 1f@xmath5 level .    in order to locate the trace of the 2p@xmath6 and 2p@xmath4 levels for @xmath2540 mev in fig .",
    "3 , in fig .",
    "4 the energy eigenvalues of woods - saxon potentials are shown as a function of @xmath10 while keeping other parameters the same as in fig .",
    "the 2p@xmath6 and 2p@xmath4 resonant levels are not obtained for @xmath56 mev and @xmath57 mev , respectively , while the @xmath0=3 one - particle resonant levels continue to be well defined above @xmath58=2 mev . from fig .",
    "4 it is seen that the 2p@xmath6 resonant level crosses with the 1f@xmath5 resonant level around @xmath2542 mev . since in the present parameterization of woods - saxon potential",
    "the strength of the spin - orbit potential is proportional to @xmath10 , it is somewhat misleading to draw the figure like fig . 4 for a large variation of @xmath10 .",
    "nevertheless , using fig .",
    "4 it is easy to locate the trace of the 2p@xmath6 resonant level for @xmath2540 mev , which is the depth used in fig .",
    "3 .    the fact that the trace of the 2p@xmath6 resonant level is expected to lie below the 1f@xmath5 level in the positive energy region of fig .",
    "3 indicates that n=28 is not a magic number in the example .",
    "the near degeneracy of the 1f@xmath5 and 2p@xmath6 levels in the positive - energy region is indeed similar to the level scheme of almost degenerate 1d@xmath3 and 2s@xmath4 bound levels in fig .",
    "this near degeneracy gives certainly the origin of possible deformation when a few weakly - bound neutrons occupy the 1f@xmath5 - 2p@xmath6 shell .",
    "namely , the degeneracy can be used to take a particular combination of the components so as to lower some level energy as deformation sets in ( jahn - teller effect ) .",
    "this situation may correspond to neutron - rich mg isotopes .    in fig .",
    "3 the level coming from the 2p@xmath4 level is totally missing since it does not exist as a resonant level .",
    "the level denoted as [ 321 1/2 ] is obtained as a resonant level only for @xmath59 and @xmath60 mev . for @xmath61 the energy of the level becomes larger than 1.67 mev , and the width becomes extremely large because @xmath0=1 is the predominant component of the wave function inside the nuclear radius .",
    "therefore , the level can not be identified as a resonance .",
    "the one - particle resonant level obtained for @xmath16=0 , which lies next lowest to 1f@xmath5 , is the 1f@xmath3 level found at 8.96 mev that lies outside the range of fig .",
    "3 .    taking @xmath2540.0 mev , in fig .",
    "5 the nilsson diagram is plotted for the radius appropriate for a=37 .",
    "the 1f@xmath3 and 2p@xmath6 resonances at @xmath16=0 are found at 5.22 and 0.018 mev with the widths 2.08 and 0.005 mev , respectively . since @xmath28(1f@xmath5 ) = @xmath340.66 mev , the distance between the 1f@xmath5 and 2p@xmath6 levels is 680 kev , which is again very small compared with the distance obtained in the case that both levels are well - bound .",
    "this near degeneracy of the 1f@xmath5 and 2p@xmath6 levels at @xmath16=0 suggests that weakly - bound neutrons in nuclei with n=21 - 26 may prefer to being deformed . in the calculation of fig . 5 for @xmath12 the s@xmath4 , d@xmath6 , d@xmath3 , g@xmath5 and g@xmath30 channels",
    "are included in the calculation of positive - parity levels , while the p@xmath4 , p@xmath6 , f@xmath3 , f@xmath5 , h@xmath30 and h@xmath45 channels for negative - parity levels .",
    "the value of @xmath10 is chosen so as to simulate the possible neutron - drip - line nucleus @xmath62mg@xmath63 , which may have a neutron separation energy of a few hundreds kev .",
    "the 2p@xmath4 resonant level is not obtained at @xmath16=0 , while for @xmath12 no @xmath21 = 1/2@xmath23 one - particle level connected to the possible 2p@xmath4 level can survive as a resonant level . the @xmath18 = 3/2@xmath23 resonant level ( denoted by the dashed curve in fig .",
    "5 ) connected to the 2p@xmath6 level at @xmath16=0 can not survive for @xmath64 and @xmath65 mev , because the predominant component of the wave function inside the nuclear radius is @xmath0=1 and the level decays out quickly due to the low centrifugal barrier .",
    "the @xmath18 = 1/2@xmath20 resonant level ( denoted by the dotted curve in fig .",
    "5 ) coming from the 1f@xmath3 level can not survive as a resonance for @xmath66 due to the increasing @xmath0=1 component inside the nuclear radius .    in the region of a few mev excitation - energy of fig . 5 , for both spherical and prolate shape we find no well - defined one - neutron resonant levels except the [ 303 7/2 ] level , since nilsson levels expected in the region have either @xmath18 = 1/2@xmath20 or 3/2@xmath20",
    "it is noted that the energy distance between the 1f@xmath5 and 2p@xmath6 levels at @xmath16=0 in the woods - saxon potential becomes as large as several mev when both levels are well bound , as known from the presence of the magic number n=28 in stable nuclei .",
    "a few examples of nilsson diagrams with both bound and resonant levels are given , the parameters of which are chosen to be appropriate for some light neutron - rich nuclei with weakly - bound neutrons , using woods - saxon potentials .",
    "the absence of centrifugal barrier ( very low centrifugal barrier ) for @xmath0=0 ( @xmath0=1 ) neutrons produces the 2s@xmath4 ( 2p@xmath6 ) level close to the 1d@xmath3 ( 1f@xmath5 ) level , for both weakly - bound and low - lying resonant neutrons .",
    "this near degeneracy of the 2s@xmath4 - 1d@xmath3 and 2p@xmath6 - 1f@xmath5 levels at @xmath16=0 is recognized as the basic element of producing deformation for some neutron - rich c - mg isotopes , in the case that the proton configuration allows the deformation .",
    "one - neutron resonant levels for @xmath12 are estimated using the eigenphase formalism .",
    "the @xmath21 = 1/2@xmath19 resonant level can hardly survive when the predominant component of the wave function inside the potential is s@xmath4 , while the @xmath21 = 1/2@xmath23 and 3/2@xmath23 resonant levels are not obtained if the predominant component has @xmath0=1 and the energy is higher than 2 mev in nuclei with a@xmath6716 . in some nuclei",
    "the absence of those @xmath21 = 1/2@xmath22 , 1/2@xmath23 and 3/2@xmath23 resonant levels produces a low density of one - neutron resonant levels in the region of several mev .",
    "how much the low density affects the many - body correlation such as pair correlation in nuclei towards the neutron drip line is a future problem to be studied and may be properly studied , only when the many - body correlation is studied treating the nearby continuum in a reasonable manner without discretizing the spectra .",
    "it is noted that the neutron one - particle levels obtained from nilsson diagrams for @xmath680 are those counted for band - head states of odd - n nuclei .",
    "thus , rotational states , which are constructed based on those band - head states , should be in principle observed using a proper experimental method though high - spin states will have very narrow widths in the low - energy region .",
    "if one fails to treat properly weakly - bound neutrons or low - energy neutron resonant levels with small @xmath0 , the hf 2p@xmath6 ( 2s@xmath4 ) level will not come down close to the 1f@xmath5 ( 1d@xmath3 ) level . in any case , if the 1f@xmath5 or 1d@xmath3 level is appreciably isolated , in the absence of pair correlation it may be possible to obtain an oblate shape as the deformation of the system with a few neutrons in the 1f@xmath5 or 1d@xmath3 shell .",
    "this is because a preferred deformation is oblate at the beginning of the shell filling if a single j - shell is isolated ( for example , see @xcite ) , while it is prolate if shells with different j values are nearly degenerate as in the harmonic - oscillator potential @xcite .",
    "it is an interesting question whether any oblate shape is observed around the ground state of light neutron - drip - line nuclei of c - mg isotopes .",

    "<S> using woods - saxon potentials and the eigenphase formalism for one - particle resonances , one - particle bound and resonant levels for neutrons as a function of quadrupole deformation are presented , which are supposed to be useful for the interpretation of spectroscopic properties of some light neutron - rich nuclei with weakly - bound neutrons . compared with nilsson diagrams in text books which are constructed using modified oscillator potentials , we point out a systematic change of the shell structure in connection with both weakly - bound and resonant one - particle levels related to small orbital angular momenta @xmath0 . then , it is seen that weakly - bound neutrons in nuclei such as @xmath1c and @xmath2 mg may prefer to being deformed as a result of jahn - teller effect , due to the near degeneracy of the 1d@xmath3 - 2s@xmath4 levels and the 1f@xmath5 - 2p@xmath6 levels in the spherical potential , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the absence of some one - particle resonant levels compared with the nilsson diagrams in text books is illustrated . </S>"
