    "polar interfaces have commanded considerable interest recently because extra electrons may migrate to the interface to  heal \" the polar catastrophe and these interfacial electrons may exhibit unusual two - dimensional properties .",
    "a polar interface of current interest is laalo@xmath0/srtio@xmath0 ( lao / sto)@xcite , which shows a variety of phenomena such as the kondo resistance minimum , superconductivity , magnetism , and metallic or insulating behavior under varying circumstances.@xcite    this paper is devoted to a theoretical study of the interface between lamno@xmath0 and srmno@xmath0 , which is a polar interface ( fig .",

    "in fact , in a similar system , viz . , a single @xmath4-doped lmo layer in a smo matrix , where an extra electron per cell becomes introduced at the @xmath4-doped layer , the formation of a spin - polarized two - dimensional electron gas was predicted due to the zener double exchange between the itinerant electrons and the localized mn moments.@xcite on the experimental front , it has been demonstrated that high - quality superlattices of the manganites can be grown by mbe and the magnetic properties can be controlled by the superlattice period as well as by substrate - induced strain.@xcite various experimental and theoretical studies have found diverse magnetic phases for these superlattices.@xcite     on the lmo side leading to the unrestricted growth of the coulomb potential ( dashed line ) and the scenario where it is healed by accumulating 0.5 electrons per cell on the interfacial mno@xmath5 layer ( solid line ) .",

    "we note that unlike the latter case , where different layer termination produces two different n and p type interfaces , for the lmo / smo interface , the mno@xmath5 layers being common to both , we just have a single type of interface , which by simple electron counting , is expected to be n type , with extra electrons coming to the interface region as illustrated in fig . [ schema ] .",
    "we study the issues of polar catastrophe , charge leakage , and magnetism at the interface by using a tight - binding model hamiltonian that includes all the relevant interactions in the system , complementing the study with the _ ab initio _ density - functional calculations .",
    "the main results that emerge from our work are the following : ( i ) half an electron per unit cell accumulates at the interface to avoid the polar catastrophe much like the case of lao / sto , although now the electrons are much more confined to the interface ( fig .",
