    "superconducting transition occurring on the depairing field @xmath3 from the conventional second order into a first order one @xcite and induces an additional spatial modulation @xcite as a reflection of a fulde - ferrell - larkin - ovchinnikov ( fflo ) state in the pauli limit .",
    "further , such a spatial variation of the pair - field , i.e. , superconducting order parameter , due to the vortices and the fflo modulation can also induce a parity mixing @xcite in the vortex state . in the ordinary superconductors with inversion symmetry , however , these effects are quite weak , and , in particular , it is not expected that the field - induced parity mixing @xcite changes the vortex phase diagram qualitatively . besides this , effects of the paramagnetic depairing on the vortex lattice structure have not been discussed until recently . it has been found @xcite that , in systems where the paramagnetic effect is strong enough , it weakens an anisotropy in the vortex lattice structure reflecting the pairing symmetry or the band structure and stabilizes the isotropic triangular lattice structure .    in this paper , we study possible relations between the pairing symmetry and the vortex lattice structure in _ noncentrosymmetric _ superconductors with spin - orbit coupling of rashba type in magnetic fields parallel to the basal plane ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "it is found that , in contrast to the above - mentioned consequences in centrosymmetric superconductors with inversion symmetry , spatial modulations induced by the paramagnetic depairing and a field - induced parity mixing occur even for relatively lower values of the maki parameter @xcite @xmath4 , and that the vortex lattice structure in rashba superconductors strongly depends upon the details of the orbital component of the cooper pairing state , where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the orbital and pauli limiting fields at zero temperature , respectively .",
    "the main origin of these intriguing effects is an anisotropic zeeman energy for quasiparticles stemming from the antisymmetric spin - orbit coupling ( asoc ) peculiar to noncentrosymmetric superconductors .",
    "this asoc is expressed as an additional term @xmath7 in the electronic hamiltonian , where @xmath8 is the energy scale measuring the magnitude of asoc , and @xmath9 is the annihilation operator of conduction electron with momentum @xmath10 and spin projection @xmath11 .",
    "the type of asoc is defined by the vector @xmath12 corresponding to the fourier transform of the asoc , and , in rashba superconductors , it can be expressed as @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the fermi wavenumber , and the @xmath15-axis corresponds to the @xmath16-direction . due to this term ,",
    "the quasiparticle band of our interest in the normal state is split into two pieces @xcite .",
    "the strength of asoc is measured by the dimensionless quantity @xmath17 expressing a normalized difference between the density of states on the split two bands , @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "hereafter , each fermi surface ( fs ) or band will be specified by the indices @xmath20 and @xmath21 . through the present paper , the ideal limit @xmath22 corresponding to the limit of large band width ( @xmath23 )",
    "is often considered in order to understand physical origins of structural changes of the vortex lattice . as",
    "a result of the coupling in the spin space between the asoc and the original zeeman terms , the quasiparticle zeeman energy on the split fss becomes @xmath10-dependent .",
    "further , we focus in this article on noncentrosymmetric superconductors satisfying the condition @xcite @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the zeeman energy in centrosymmetric case . under this condition",
    ", the zeeman energy in noncentrosymmetric materials becomes highly anisotropic in the momentum space so that the paramagnetic depairing is ineffective in @xmath26 @xcite , where other high order corrections in @xmath27 were neglected .",
    "this asoc - induced anisotropy in the zeeman energy makes emergence of modulated vortex states in rashba superconductors easier compared with that in centrosymmetric systems .",
    "[ 1.8 ] ) , each cooper pair is formed on the same fs , and the paramagnetic depairing is effective only through the _ relative _ displacement of the two fss of which the magnitude is @xmath28 ( see sec.i ) . in the limit in which one of the two fss is irrelevant to superconductivity , such an fs - displacement induced by the zeeman effect is trivial and reduces to the orbital - limited case.,title=\"fig : \" ]    before proceeding further , we introduce two key parameters for determining the type of modulations in vortex states in rashba superconductors . one is @xmath29 defined in eq.([eq : deltan ] ) .",
    "however , we note that , as indicated in fig.1(b ) , a modulation induced by the paramagnetic depairing is expected even in @xmath30 limit .",
    "the other is a parameter measuring closeness between the most attractive singlet and triplet pairing states and will be expressed in the form @xmath31 where @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) is the strength of attractive interaction in the most attractive pairing state in singlet ( triplet ) channels . in the limiting case with just a single pairing state ,",
    "@xmath34 vanishes , while it is divergent when both of the two pairing channels equally contribute to superconductivity . in the latter case",
    ", only one of two fss contributes to the pairing .",
    "then , the pure orbital - limiting case is reached , because a field - induced displacement of _ the only _ fs participating in superconductivity does _ not _ affect the pairing itself ( see fig.1(b ) ) .    to clarify why a state modulating in the plane perpendicular to @xmath1 tends to occur _ more easily _ compared with in the centrosymmetric case ,",
    "the @xmath35-@xmath36 phase diagrams ( a ) in the _ centrosymmetric _ case and ( b ) in rashba case in @xmath22 limit are compared with each other in fig.2 , where @xmath37 , and the normalized field @xmath35 will be defined in the ensuing sections . for simplicity , the possibility @xcite of the first order @xmath38-transition and of a modulation _ parallel _ to @xmath1 in fig.2(a ) is neglected here . between the figures",
    "( a ) and ( b ) , the only difference in the used hamiltonian is the zeeman energy term : in ( a ) , the ordinary isotropic zeeman energy @xmath39 is used , where @xmath40 denotes the spin projection , and the modulated state , ( a ) and ( b ) , corresponding to the fflo state in the pauli limit appears in higher fields and is separated by a first order transition occurring on the red curve from the conventional triangular lattice ( c ) . on the other hand , in ( b ) , the zeeman energy is influenced by @xmath41 and takes the form @xmath42 . due to this anisotropy in the momentum space of the zeeman effect , the overall effect of the paramagnetic depairing is weakened in the noncentrosymmetric case , as can be seen from the relative enhancement of @xmath38 and the narrower fflo region with the structure ( a ) in ( b ) .",
    "however , novel modulated vortex states , the intermediate states ( b ) and ( c ) , tend to occur in ( b ) due to the momentum dependent zeeman energy term .",
    "that is , contrary to the centrosymmetric case with isotropic zeeman energy , a novel modulated vortex state can be expected to occur in rashba superconductors even if the paramagnetic depairing effect is so weak that the conventional fflo - like modulated state ( a ) does not appear . in fact , this is the basic reason why , as will be shown below , various spatially - modulated states can occur dependent on the pairing symmetry in rashba superconductors .",
    "it should be stressed that the novel spatially - modulated states , ( b ) and ( c ) in ( b ) in intermediated fields , appear irrespective of @xmath29 and hence , is not relevant to the helical _ phase _ modulation @xcite argued to occur in the vortex _ free _ situation in rashba superconductors .",
    "the phase modulation is hidden in the vortex states in rashba case and merely appears as an anisotropy orienting the direction of the novel modulated structure . however",
    ", the helical phase modulation is observable in noncentrosymmetric superconductors of cubic type and should be detected as a local and _ transverse _ magnetization @xcite .    in sec.ii , the microscopic basis of our calculation is explained . after deriving the ginzburg - landau ( gl ) free energy functional , results on phase diagrams in the pure singlet or pure triplet case",
    "are shown and discussed separately for a couple of pairing states in sec.iii . in the next section ,",
    "the analysis is extended to the case with a singlet and triplet mixing , and discussions on relevance of the present results to real systems are given in sec.v .",

    "thus , the intermediate states in fig.2(b ) can occur even in rashba superconductors with smaller maki parameters where the high field state ( a ) of larkin - ovchinnikov ( lo ) type does not appear .",
    "further , the states ( b ) and ( c ) in fig.2(b ) and the continuous crossover between them are also seen in the singlet - triplet ( @xmath46-@xmath36 ) mixed case to be discussed later .    in fig.3",

    "the crossover expressed as ( b ) and ( c ) in fig.2(b ) , this crossover between ( b ) and ( c ) in fig.3(b ) also appears in the more general case with @xmath46-@xmath36 mixing of pairing channels .    here , the difference in the orientation of the low field triangular lattice between fig.3(a ) and other figures in fig.2 and 3 will be commented on .",
    "first , in fig.3 , we find that even a small but nonvanishing @xmath207 changes the orientation of the triangular lattice , and that , at a fixed ( and nonvanishing ) @xmath29 , there is no indication of an orientational transition in the triangular lattice region . below the dashed line in fig.3(a ) , however , the orientation is found to be the same as in fig.3(c ) .",
    "this feature is commonly seen in the cases of other pairing states to be given below . on the other hand ,",
    "the difference in the orientation between fig.2(b ) and fig.3(a ) can be attributed to the difference in the @xmath103-value used in calculations , or equivalently , to the strength of the paramagnetic depairing : as the paramagnetic depairing is enhanced , higher ll modes with _ even _ indices in the pair - field become more effective and change the orientation .",
    "this statement was justified by separately performing a calculation taking account only of the lowest ll . besides",
    ", the absence of such an orientational change in the case with a nonvanishing @xmath29 is also consistent with the effective reduction of the paramagnetic depairing due to a nonzero @xmath29 mentioned in the preceding paragraph .",
    "therefore , as far as the uniaxial anisotropy measured by @xmath57 is not so large , the orientation of the low field triangular lattice in real systems with nonvanishing @xmath207 is expected to keep that of fig.3(c ) .",
    "hereafter , we will not discuss this possibility of an orientational transition any longer .",
    "quantitatively , there are some differences between the present fig.3 following from the @xmath145-optimization and fig.3 in ref.@xcite where @xmath212 was assumed . for instance , in the latter for @xmath213 , the lo - like state , ( a ) in the present fig.3(a ) and ( b ) , survives over a broader field range compared with that in the corresponding one in the former .",
    "however , except such quantitatively subtle differences , there were no notable differences due to the @xmath145-value in the phase diagrams and their @xmath29 dependences .",
    "this evidently shows that the analysis in ref.@xcite trying to take care of the approximation on the @xmath145-value by including the eight lls is justified .",
    "further , judging from this fact that the vortex structure is not sensitive to the @xmath145-value , our neglect of the @xmath214-dependence accompanying @xmath102 in eq.(20 ) is also believed to be safely valid .    here ,",
    "based on the figures in fig.3 , our replacement of the original quartic term @xmath161 with the conventional local expression @xmath189 will be discussed .",
    "this replacement is safely valid in centrosymmetric superconductors with a large paramagnetic effect @xcite . even in the present rashba case",
    ", the same thing should hold . for smaller @xmath207 ,",
    "the paramagnetic effect is stronger , and intriguing modulated vortex structures tend to appear .",
    "although there might be possibility that the validity of this local approximation is subtle in intermediate fields , the structural changes in the case with nonzero @xmath29 are smooth so that most of fosts in @xmath209 case are changed into crossovers . in such a crossover regime , a large deviation between the results of @xmath161 and of @xmath189 is not expected .",
    "for this reason , we believe that the use of the local approximation for @xmath161 is qualitatively valid and does not lead to a significant error in our results on the vortex lattice structure .      here , phase diagrams in the case of a superconducting gap with horizontal line nodes will be briefly explained .",
    "recently , such a nodal gap has been proposed as a model of cerhsi@xmath2 and ceirsi@xmath2 @xcite , and , following ref.@xcite , we choose the gap function @xmath215 .",
    "figure 4 includes the resulting phase diagrams in this case . clearly , the obtained phase diagrams are essentially the same as those in the full gap case .",
    "this is due to the fact that , in the angular average over each fs , the @xmath216 dependence of the gap function does not directly couple to the @xmath217 dependence in the zeeman energy .",
    "thus , the same thing should hold for any gap function dependent only on @xmath216 .",
    "therefore , it appears that , when the @xmath46-@xmath36 mixing is negligible , the presence of a horizontal line node in the superconducting gap can not be judged from the resulting vortex lattice structure .",
    "in contrast to the preceding case , the momentum dependence in the gap function directly couples to that of the zeeman term when the gap nodes consist of vertical lines , leading to a drastic change of vortex lattice structure .",
    "this will be explained here in the @xmath95-pairing case where @xmath218 .    in this @xmath95-pairing case ,",
    "situation changes depending on whether the applied field @xmath1 is along the nodal direction or antinodal one .",
    "differences between these two cases already appear in the @xmath38-curves shown in fig.5 . in @xmath1",
    "parallel to an antinode , the @xmath3 value is slightly enhanced compared with that in the full gap case obtained in terms of the same set of parameter values .",
    "in contrast , @xmath3 in @xmath1 parallel to a gap node is remarkably depressed compared with the full gap curve .",
    "this strong anisotropy in @xmath38 is a consequence of the coupling in the momentum dependence between @xmath68 and the anisotropic zeeman term .",
    "a more remarkable difference is seen in the resulting vortex lattice structures in the two field configurations . in @xmath1",
    "parallel to an antinode , the vortex lattice structure is qualitatively the same as in the preceding two cases , while , in @xmath1 parallel to a gap node , there are no intermediate states in @xmath209 limit , and the high field state is of the lo - type with an unidirectional modulation parallel to @xmath219 , i.e. , the @xmath15-axis . in this case ,",
    "the direction of the modulation in the lo - like state is pinned by the vertical line nodes .",
    "the resulting vortex lattices always have reflection symmetry in the plane perpendicular to @xmath1 in contrast to the intermediate phases in fig.3(a ) and fig.4(a ) .",
    "this fact may have crucial consequences in the cases with a significant mixing of a @xmath53-wave component with vertical line nodes and the corresponding @xmath77-wave one ( see sec.v ) .    to understand whether this _ vertical _ lo state survives for realistic @xmath29 values , we have also examined the corresponding phase diagrams for nonzero @xmath29 values and have found that , for @xmath220 , the vertical lo state is absent even close to @xmath221 .",
    "as fig.6 shows , however , the novel striped state with modulation perpendicular to the @xmath15-axis , corresponding to ( b ) in fig.3(b ) , occupies a much narrower region compared with that in fig.3(b ) in the full gap case , because the lo - like state competing with this novel intermediate state is supported in this case by the vertical line nodes .",
    "thus , we expect that the region in which the novel modulated state replaces the vertical lo - like state is narrower even for more realistic @xmath29 values , and thus that the lo - like state may be observable as a high field state in this case in contrast to that in the preceding two cases . for these reasons",
    ", we believe that the presence of vertical line gap - nodes can be anticipated by investigating vortex lattice structures .",
    "in the preceding section , the singlet ( @xmath46)-triplet ( @xmath36 ) mixing , which is usually present in noncentrosymetric superconductors with nonzero @xmath29 , has been neglected by assuming one of the two channels to be dominantly attractive . this approximation is valid for a vanishingly small @xmath34 , i.e. , as far as one of @xmath32 and @xmath33 is small enough ( see eq.([eq : deltaw ] ) ) .",
    "however , when the ratio @xmath222 is of order unity , this @xmath46-@xmath36 mixing drastically changes the @xmath143-@xmath100 phase diagram even if @xmath207 is vanishingly small .",
    "that is , the @xmath46-@xmath36 mixing is measured by a finite @xmath222 , i.e. , eq.([eq : deltaw ] ) , in nonzero fields rather than a nonzero @xmath29 @xcite in zero field case , as a result of the fact that the pair - field in nonzero fields is intrinsically spatially varying .    in this section , roles of the @xmath46-@xmath36-mixing will be first examined in details for quasi two - dimensional ( q2d ) systems with a large @xmath57 . for simplicity",
    ", we focus on the case of a mixing of @xmath46-wave and @xmath223-wave pairings . in this q2d case ,",
    "the momentum dependence of @xmath224 appearing in some places may be neglected to simplify our evaluation of the free energy . to clarify the details of this treatment ,",
    "let us first start from introducing the pair - field on each of the split fss in the @xmath46-@xmath36 mixed case . as the expressions of pair - field operators @xmath225 ( @xmath74 and @xmath36 ) suggest , the ( spatially varying ) energy gap on the fs @xmath83 is generally given by @xmath226{\\mathstrut 2 } } \\quad ( a=1,2)\\ ] ] which is accompanied by the momentum dependence @xmath12 of the spin - orbit coupling even after having been separated from @xmath68-dependence , where @xmath159 ( @xmath227 ) is the singlet ( triplet ) gap corresponding to @xmath228 ( @xmath229 ) . in q2d case ,",
    "the factor @xmath224 in @xmath230 is replaced by unity , and @xmath231 will be used in this section .",
    "derivation of the quadratic gl term @xmath232 is almost the same as in the preceding section once @xmath233 ( @xmath74 and @xmath36 ) are expressed via @xmath234 through eq.([eq : q2ddelta ] ) , and we obtain @xmath235 |\\delta_a^{(0)}|^2 - 2 ( \\delta_a^{(0)})^\\ast k_2^{(a)}({\\bf \\pi } ) \\delta_a^{(0 ) } \\biggr )   \\nonumber \\\\    & & + \\biggl [ \\frac{(w^{-1})_{ss}-(w^{-1})_{tt}}{2 } \\biggr ] \\bigl [ \\delta_1^\\ast \\delta_2 + ( { \\rm c.c . } ) \\bigr ] \\biggr].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] according to the expression ( [ eq : defrks ] ) of @xmath236 , it is natural in this case to choose the gauge in the manner depending on each fs and to represent the pair - field in the form @xmath237 with @xmath238 .",
    "note that the gauge - invariant gradient corresponding to @xmath239 is @xmath240 using the formula ( [ eq : hiasaikeform ] ) , the term including the @xmath241-integral in eq.([eq : defrf2 ] ) becomes @xmath242    to calculate the off - diagonal ( last ) term in eq.([eq : defrf2 ] ) , we will directly use the formula ( [ eq : fombilinear ] ) , and consequently , @xmath243{\\mathstrut 2\\gamma}q_0 r_h ) , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the property ( [ eq : fomll1 ] ) was used .",
    "therefore , eq.([eq : defrf2 ] ) takes the form @xmath244",
    "\\nonumber \\\\    & & - n ( \\delta w)^{-1 } \\sum_{n_1,n_2 } \\left ( y^\\ast _ { 1,n_1}y_{2,n_2 } e^{-\\gamma q^2r_h^2 }    { \\cal l}_{n_2,n_1}(\\ \\sqrt{\\mathstrut 2\\gamma}qr_h ) + ( { \\rm c.c . } ) \\right ) .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , it is important to note that the paramagnetic effect appears through the fflo wavenumber @xmath102 only in the last term , i.e. , the cross term between different fss .",
    "thus , in @xmath245 limit , i.e. , when @xmath246 ( see eq.([eq : deltaw ] ) ) , the paramagnetic effect is lost irrespective of the @xmath247-value , and the orbitally - limited situation is realized .",
    "the parameter @xmath34 measures the magnitude of the @xmath46-@xmath36 mixing in _",
    "_ fields . in the present q2d model , the energy gap on the fs with a smaller density of states vanishes ( see , for instance , fig.8 shown below ) in @xmath245 limit .",
    "the single - pairing case , that is , the pure singlet or pure triplet case corresponds to the case with vanishing @xmath248 , while the single and triplet channels equally contribute and are competitive with each other when @xmath245 .",
    "the zero field transition temperature @xmath140 is given by @xmath249 through the expression @xmath250{\\mathstrut ( \\delta w)^{-2 } + \\left ( \\delta n \\int_{\\rho_c}^\\infty d\\rho f(\\rho)|_{t = t_c }    + \\frac{(w^{-1})_{st}}{n } \\right)^2}.\\ ] ] it is not difficult to verify that the above expression is equivalent to eqs.(28 ) and ( 31 ) in the impurity - free case in ref.@xcite .    regarding the quartic term , the method in the single pairing case will be directly used .",
    "the quartic term @xmath251 is given by eq.([eq : defrf4 ] ) with @xmath159 replaced by @xmath234 , and , for a similar reason to that in the single pairing case , it will be replaced by its local expression @xmath252 and the gl free energy in equilibrium is given by @xmath253    we show , in figs.7 and 8 , examples of the resulting phase diagrams and vortex lattice structures in the case with a mixing of @xmath46-wave and @xmath223-wave components _ and _ with a q2d ( cylindrical ) fs . in those figures ,",
    "the vortex lattice structures at several selected points in each @xmath35-@xmath36 phase diagram are represented as real space patterns of @xmath254 on fs1 , @xmath255 on fs2 , @xmath256 , and @xmath257 . in general ,",
    "when @xmath207 is essentially zero so that both of the two fss contribute equally to superconductivity , as shown in fig.7 , the vortex positions in @xmath258 do not coincide with those in @xmath259 , reflecting the fact that the spatial pattern of @xmath256 tends to become quite opposite to that of @xmath257 . in this case , when @xmath159 consists of even lls , @xmath227 is expressed only by the odd lls , and vice versa . on the other hand , with increasing @xmath207 , one of the two fss dominantly contributes to superconductivity , and , according to eq.([eq : q2ddelta ] ) , the ( nearly ) zero points of @xmath256 coincide with those of @xmath257 ( see fig.8 ) .",
    "when one of the two fss primarily determines superconductivity , the paramagnetic depairing is significantly reduced , because the paramagnetic effect on _ a single _ fs is trivially gauged away @xcite ( see also fig.1(b ) ) . as in the case with a single pairing component , an increase of @xmath207 results in a significant mixing between the even and odd lls , and , as in fig.8 , @xmath256 tends to show similar spatial patterns to @xmath257 .",
    "figure 7 corresponds to a phase diagram of the case with a slight inclusion of a @xmath223-wave pairing component in the pure @xmath46-wave case . here ,",
    "@xmath29 is set to be zero , and hence , this figure is comparable with fig.3 ( a ) and ( b ) .",
    "similarly to the difference between fig.3(a ) and fig.3(b ) induced by a slight increase of @xmath207 , the intermediate state ( c ) in fig.7 with no reflection symmetry are limited to a narrow region and dominated by the stripe - like modulated lattice ( a ) and ( b ) .",
    "however , the structure at ( b ) in fig.7 is not a square lattice appearing as a crossover from the striped structure ( a ) but rather a triangular lattice which can be obtained by rotating another triangular lattice appearing in lower fields just below fost4 .",
    "the triangular lattice in intermediate fields is also present even for larger @xmath34 , i.e. , even when the @xmath46 and @xmath223-wave components are more significantly mixed , while it is lost as @xmath207 is larger , as can be seen in fig.8 where a more @xmath46-@xmath36 mixing and a larger @xmath207 than in fig.7 were assumed . a typical @xmath29 dependence of @xmath3-curve including that of fig.8 has been given in ref.@xcite . in the @xmath209 limit ,",
    "the @xmath35-value corresponding to @xmath221 is close to @xmath260 .",
    "such a much larger @xmath221 than that of fig.3(a ) is due to the @xmath46-@xmath36 mixing , which clearly plays more dominant roles than a nonzero @xmath29 for enhancing @xmath38 .",
    "nevertheless , fig.8 has similar features to those of fig.3(c ) .",
    "for instance , in both fig.3(c ) and fig.8 , the triangular lattice near @xmath140 shows an anisotropic structure compressed along the @xmath15-axis , while the vortex structure in higher fields is an anisotropic square lattice created from the novel striped lattice ( b ) in fig.3(b ) .",
    "therefore , in the present case with a cylindrical fs with a negligibly small corrugation , an increase of a @xmath46-@xmath36 mixing plays qualitatively similar roles to an increase of the magnitude of the spin - orbit coupling @xmath207 in the @xmath35-@xmath36 phase diagram , and , in a realistic situation where both @xmath248 and @xmath207 are nonvanishing , vortex lattice structures with no reflection symmetry such as ( b ) in fig.3(a ) are expected not to occur .    in ( c ) of fig.8",
    ", the image of @xmath256 is much brighter than that of @xmath257 , while both of them in ( a ) are almost the same as each other .",
    "the former feature in lower fields is a reflection of the fact that , in zero field , the singlet component is the dominant pairing state , and a small @xmath207 induces the triplet componet , while , with increasing field , the role of inducing a @xmath46-@xmath36 mixing is played not by @xmath207 but rather by the nonvanishing @xmath248 . in particular , at high enough fields and in low temperature limit , the vortex structure is an anisotropic square lattice oriented along the @xmath15 axis for any @xmath29 , implying that the phase diagram there is sensitive not to @xmath29 but to @xmath34 . in the next subsection , however , these conclusions in q2d case are found to be changed for more three dimension(3d)-like fss .",
    "for instance , the @xmath35-@xmath36 phase diagram for a more 3d - like fs seems to have a much stronger @xmath29 dependence than that seen above .    in obtaining fig.8 ,",
    "we have assumed @xmath261 and @xmath262 .",
    "since @xmath247 generally depends on the higher energy cutoff , the results following from diagonalization of @xmath263 are quantitatively affected by the details of @xmath247 .",
    "in fact , if @xmath247 is zero or negative , @xmath264 rather than @xmath265 should be larger .",
    "the opposite result to this , seen in fig.8 , is a consequence of a positive @xmath247 .",
    "however , we have reexamined fig.8 by changing the sign of @xmath247 and have found that the field induced changes of the vortex lattice structure remain qualitatively the same as those in fig.8 .",
    "based on this fact , we shall assume hereafter the vortex lattice structure to be qualitatively insensitive to the sign of @xmath247 .      in this subsection ,",
    "the q2d approximation in the last section is relaxed , and effects of the corrugation parallel to the @xmath15-axis of the q2d fermi surface will be incorporated .",
    "then , the @xmath214-dependence in @xmath230 neglected in the last section needs to be included .",
    "in contrast to the weak @xmath214 dependence accompanying the parameter @xmath102 , neglected for simplicity in eq.(20 ) , this @xmath214 dependence may lead to a change of the degree of mixing of even and odd lls which affects the vortex lattice structure . to simplify our treatment , the factor @xmath224 in @xmath230 will be approximated by @xmath266{\\mathstrut 1-\\tilde{j}(1-{\\rm cos}k_z ) }   \\\\    & \\simeq & \\sqrt[]{\\mathstrut 1-\\tilde{j } } + \\frac{\\tilde{j } { \\rm cos}k_z}{2\\ \\sqrt[]{\\mathstrut 1-\\tilde{j}}}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] then , using @xmath267{\\mathstrut 1-\\tilde{j } } \\delta_t}{\\sqrt[]{\\mathstrut 2}},\\ ] ] @xmath230 is expressed as @xmath268{\\mathstrut 2(1-\\tilde{j } ) } } \\delta_t   \\nonumber \\\\    & = & ( 1+\\varsigma){\\tilde \\delta}^{(0)}_a-\\varsigma { \\tilde \\delta}^{(0)}_b,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath83 and @xmath269 or @xmath21 , @xmath270 , and @xmath271    first , let us start from rewriting terms dependent on @xmath249 in the gl quadratic terms ( see eq.([eq : defrf2 ] ) ) into the form @xmath272",

    "further , just like in figs.7 and 8 in q2d case , we will present not only the resulting phase diagram but also the spatial variations of @xmath297 , @xmath256 , and @xmath257 at some selected points in an @xmath35-@xmath36 phase diagram . according to the expressions given so far ,",
    "they are given by @xmath298    a typical example of @xmath29-dependences of the @xmath35-@xmath36 phase diagram at the same @xmath299-value is shown in fig.9 .",
    "the value @xmath300 is estimated by assuming @xmath301 to roughly correspond to @xmath302 , where @xmath303 is the higher energy cutoff for the pairing .",
    "for this reason , the @xmath38-value suggested in fig.9(a ) is comparable with those in fig.2 and is much smaller than the corresponding one in q2d case with @xmath304 . in spite of this , the @xmath29 dependence in fig.9 with a more 3d - like fs is dramatic compared with that in q2d case : even a small @xmath207 leads to an @xmath3 curve close to the orbital limit , although we have checked that the @xmath3 curve in fig.9(b ) lies slightly below that in the orbital - limited case .",
    "more important differences from those in q2d case are seen in the resulting vortex lattice structures . according to the results in q2d case ,",
    "a slight inclusion of a finite @xmath248 has similar roles to those of a finite @xmath29 , and the scenario suggested by fig.3 was that the states of lo type with no reflection symmetry are destabilized .",
    "however , the corrugation of the cylindrical fs , or a 3d - like fs seems to destabilize rather the novel striped modulation induced by the finite @xmath29 and appeared as ( b ) and ( c ) in fig.3(b ) .",
    "in fact , it seems based on some phase diagrams we have numerically obtained that the structures ( b ) and ( c ) in fig.3(b ) with reflection symmetry are close in energy to another structures in intermediate fields , ( b ) and ( c ) in fig.3(a ) with no reflection symmetry and thus that the crossover between the former structures competes with the corresponding one between the latter structures .",
    "the former is supported in part by the nearly straight cylindrical fs , while the corrugation of the cylindrical fs or a 3d - like fs favors the latter .",
    "we stress that such a competition is absent in the single pairing case in sec.iii because it is the momentum dependence in eq.([eq : deltaa ] ) which induces such a competition between two kinds of modulated states .",
    "in fact , fig.9(a ) should be compared with fig.7 : for instance , the square lattice near @xmath221 in fig.7 is replaced in fig.9(a ) by that of lo type , and the roles of the two kinds of structures ( one with reflection symmetry and the other of lo type with no reflection symmetry ) in intermediate fields in fig.7 are precisely exchanged in fig.9(a ) .",
    "further , fig.9(b ) shows that , with increasing @xmath207 , the region of the triangular lattice in intermediate fields shrinks in contrast to the strongly anisotropic triangular lattice near @xmath140 , and that the high field region above fost1 in fig.9(a ) disappears .",
    "consequently , far from @xmath140 , the only stable structure in fig.9(b ) is a strongy anisotropic and _ tilted _ vortex lattice with no reflection symmetry . as fig.10",
    "show , the vortices in fig.9(b ) have cores compressed along the @xmath15-axis .",
    "with decreasing the field , the tilt angle of the stripes in fig.9(b ) , which is a vestige of the fflo modulation in ( a ) of fig.9(a ) , decreases . since the lattice structure there is close to the square symmetry rather than the hexagonal one , however , an fost , just like fost2 in fig.3(a ) , inevitably occurs to transform into the triangular lattice ( c ) .",
    "this example also indicates a similar role of @xmath285 to that of @xmath29 .",
    "we also note that phase diagrams similar to fig.9(b ) have been obtained quite often in our numerical calculations .",
    "for instance , even for @xmath305 which seems to be a value closer to the orbital limiting , we have obtained the results similar to fig.9(b ) irrespective of the used @xmath29-value .",
    "we have not examined a phase diagram for quite a small @xmath207 interpolating fig.9 ( a ) and ( b ) .",
    "based on the above - mentioned similar roles of @xmath285 and @xmath29 , however , it is valuable to examine the @xmath209 case with a larger @xmath46-@xmath36 mixing than that in fig.9(a ) . for this reason ,",
    "we show such an example in fig.11 .",
    "it seems , except the presence of fost4 and fost5 there , that fig.11 interpolates between fig.9(a ) and ( b ) .",
    "in fact , these two fosts are expected to change into crossovers once @xmath29 becomes nonzero , because the roles of even and odd lls are exchanged through fost4 and fost5 , and an even - odd ll mixing due to a nonzero @xmath29 , as in fig.3 , tends to change an fost into a crossover .",
    "therefore , it is natural to expect that , in the situations interpolating fig.9(a ) and ( b ) , the _ intermediate _ triangular lattices are simply lost with increasing @xmath207 .",
    "in this paper , possible vortex lattice structures in noncentrosymmetric rashba superconductors have been studied , and , as a result of the anisotropic zeeman effect peculiar to rashba superconductors , the vortex structure was found to change depending on the pairing symmetry . through our calculations for several model pairing states , three types of sequences of field - induced structural crossovers have been found to appear in superconductors with the asoc of pure rashba type in intermediate fields depending on the value of a normalized asoc and on the pairing state : 1 ) lo - like structure with _ no _ reflection symmetry and a field - induced rotation of its orientation , 2 ) novel striped lattice modulating along the @xmath306-direction and its crossover to a compressed square lattice , and 3 ) intermediate triangular lattices _ differing _ from the familiar one near @xmath140 and in lower fields .",
    "however , the lo structure occurring in the @xmath95-pairing case under a field parallel to the gap nodes is exceptional and has a modulation parallel to the @xmath15-axis and reflection symmetry .    to obtain close correlations between the vortex structure and pairing symmetry",
    ", a detailed analysis taking account of a more realistic band structure will be neccesary .",
    "nevertheless , based on the numerical study we have performed so far , the following two conclusions are expected to be unaffected by refining the starting microscopic model .",
    "below , we focus on realistic cases with nonvanishing @xmath307 .    in the case where the @xmath46-@xmath36 mixing is negligible , a modulated state with weak stripes parallel to the @xmath15-axis or an anisotropic square vortex lattice is realized in the intermediate and high field ranges , depending on the situation , and is expected to have reflection symmetry . in the presence of vertical line gap - nodes parallel to the @xmath15-axis ,",
    "the resulting high field state is affected by the gap nodes and may be the lo - like vortex lattice with stripes perpendicular to the @xmath15-axis if the field is parallel to a gap node .    in the case with a significant amount of @xmath46-@xmath36 mixing",
    ", the paramagnetic depairing effect is reduced irrespective of the pairing state , leading to an enhancement of @xmath38 , while the vortex lattice structure seems to depend on the dimensionality of the fermi surface : for the 2d - like case in which fs takes the form of a nearly straight cylinder , the resulting vortex lattices seem to always have reflection symmetry and to yield the structural crossover 2 ) indicated above . in the case with a more realistic fs such as a corrugated cylinder , however , the resulting vortex lattice in higher fields has no reflection symmetry reflecting the crossover 1 ) suggesting the presence of the lo - like state in @xmath22 limit .",
    "these scenarios are not satisfied in superconductors with the vertical line gap - nodes ( @xmath308-axis ) and under a field parallel to a gap - node , where the tilted structures with no reflection symmetry do not appear , reflecting a pinning of the striped structure via the gap nodes .",
    "experimentally , an imaging of a vortex lattice can be seen , for instance , through neutron scattering measurements .",
    "in such an experiment , however , the structure is detected as a flux density distribution which , in turn , is determined by a spatial distribution of the supercurrent . although we have not calculated the supercurrent density in the present work ,",
    "the resulting flux density is , roughly speaking , proportional to the summation @xmath309 so that the spatial patterns shown in the figures in the preceding sections are essentially detectable .    among the existing noncentrosymmetric superconductors , cerhsi@xmath2 @xcite and ceirsi@xmath2 @xcite",
    "seem to correspond to the case with a negligibly small @xmath46-@xmath36 mixing because they show significantly reduced @xmath3 in @xmath0 compared with that in @xmath26 . if , as in the pairing model proposed recently @xcite , the pairing state has no vertical line gap - nodes , the present results imply that the resulting vortex lattices should keep reflection symmetry , and that no unusual vortex dynamics is expected to appear in these materials ( see below ) .",
    "by contrast , in cept@xmath2si , nearly isotropic @xmath38-curves @xcite have been previously determined experimentally which suggest that the paramagnetic depairing is weak in this material .",
    "based on the present results , this implies that its pairing state has a significant @xmath46-@xmath36 mixing , or that the bare paramagnetic effect is negligibly weak .",
    "if the latter possibility is correct , a natural guess is that the vortex state will be a _ conventional _",
    "orbital - limited one , which can not explain the recent interesting observation of an extremely small magnetic decay rate in cept@xmath2si in @xmath310 @xcite without extrinsically assuming the presence of twin boundaries . on the contrary , if the former case is valid , and the pairing state has no vertical line gap - nodes , the resulting vortex lattice has no reflection symmetry ( see fig.9(b ) ) .",
    "this suggests the presence of two domains of vortex lattices in real cept@xmath2si @xcite , although the pairing state of this material is expected to have time reversal symmetry , and it is possible that the observation in ref.@xcite is intrinsically explained without invoking @xcite extrinsic twin boundaries . to clarify this point ,",
