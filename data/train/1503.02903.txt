    "a brain - computer interface ( bci ) is a technology that uses brainwaves only to control a computer , or a machine , without any body muscle movements  @xcite .",
    "this technology could allow disabled people , such as those suffering from locked  in syndrome ( lis ) , to regain communication skills or to manage daily life support related functions . in our research ,",
    "we focus on an auditory and non  invasive bci modality , since it allows for an application without any training even for the naive user .    among the state",
    " of  the  art bcis , the visual modality is the most successful because the evoked p300 responses usually have the largest amplitudes allowing for the easiest classification  @xcite .",
    "however , it is known that some lis users ( e.g. advanced stage amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients ) can not rely on visual modalities because they gradually lose intentional muscle control , including eye movements , focusing or intentional blinking .",
    "our research hypothesis is that the spatial auditory bci ( sabci )  @xcite modality shall be a more suitable solution for establishing communication with lis users and for creating the japanese speller requiring at minimum the @xmath0 characters out for @xmath1 available for a smooth communication . in order to do so",
    ", we propose to utilize the two  step input procedure to create an easy  to  use speller interface with a limited number of choices ( commands ) in each step .",
    "we also test various auditory stimulus scenarios using different combinations of female and male voices in the two  step input protocol .",
    "we report results from a series of experiments in which the users were asked to spell short japanese words using the two  step input scenarios .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we describe the online bci experiment set  up , eeg acquisition , filtering and classification procedures , as well as the two  step input japanese _",
    "characters speller paradigm .",
    "then the results of the online bci experiments are discussed together with the p300 response latencies .",
    "finally , conclusions are drawn and future research directions outlined .",
    "in the experiments reported in this paper , the japanese _ kana _ character set  based bci  speller paradigm was investigated .",
    "the paradigm was designed to extend our previously reported pilot study  @xcite . in order to improve the previous @xmath2 characters  based paradigm ,",
    "we designed the new interface as follows : the sound stimuli of male and the female voices were introduced in various input steps ; `` a step  back '' command was added in the second step input using a tone of @xmath3  hz in order to let the user to retreat from a possible error in the first step ; in the first step the number of choices was increased from five to ten ( see figure  [ fig.kana ] ) . in order to create the spatial sound images with stimuli coming from distinct locations known to the user , we tested the following combinations .",
    "we used the sound stimulus patterns as follows : only the female voice modality with the same vocalization presented in the both input steps ; male  @xmath4  female voices modality in the first and second steps , respectively ; female  @xmath4  male voices modality with an opposite set  up to the previous one .",
    "the speech occurrences were adopted from a sound dataset constructed of male and female natural voice recordings available for research purposed from  @xcite .",
    "we used the sound stimuli of @xmath0  japanese _ kana _ characters .",
    "the auditory stimuli were delivered from the ten distinct spatial locations using loudspeakers positioned in two horizontal lines in front of the user s head .",
    "the five loudspeakers were at the user ears level and the remaining five in a line one meter above . in order to manage the spatial sounds distributions and precise presentations to evoke the time aligned p300 responses an in  house multimedia application was developed in _",

    "the max application communicated with the in  house extended eeg acquisition , filtering and classification environment bci2000  @xcite using an udp network protocol .",
    "we conducted the online eeg experiments in order to verify a possibility to input the set of japanese _ kana _ characters of the proposed spatial auditory bci ( sabci ) speller paradigm .",
    "we tested whether there were significant differences in accuracies among the proposed spatial sound stimulus patterns . in the experiments",

    "each user first conducted a short psychophysical test with a button press behavioral response to confirm understanding of the experimental set  up .",
    "next , the eeg online bci protocol experiments were conducted . in the eeg experiments ,",
    "each user was instructed to spell a sequence of japanese _ kana _ characters presented in random order as in the classical p300 response based oddball paradigm  @xcite .",
    "the following two types of experimental sessions were performed for each user in the eeg experiments : training session - using only the five japanese vowels ( _ a , i , u , e , _ and _ o _ ) in a simple single  step  spelling set  up in order to train a stepwise linear discriminant analysis ( swlda ) classifier  @xcite to discriminate the @xmath7 responses ( a binary classification mode of _ target _ versus _ non  target _ brainwave evoked responses ) ; a copy spelling test session - to test online the two  step  input japanese _ kana _ characters speller paradigm . as a task in the test experiment four japanese words ( _ ho  ta  ru ,",
    "na  ma  e , fu  ne  o  mo  tu _ and _ shi  ra  yu  ki  hi  me _ ) were spelled by the users . during the online bci experiments ,",
