    "one basic property of the nucleus is its geometric shape .",
    "therefore , the nuclear shape , whether it is spherical , prolate , oblate , axially symmetric , or triaxial , is a key property of the ground state , as well as of excited states of the nucleus .",
    "quantifying the nuclear shape , one usually turns to the well known geometric deformation parameters @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "these are deduced from a comparison of data with , _",
    "e.g. _ , the davydov - fillipov model of a rigid triaxial rotor @xcite .",
    "this approach incorporates a major problem .",
    "a rigid rotor model can not account for vibrations of the nuclear shape , which is a strong limitation .",
    "but , even if a model is able to describe also vibrations in the deformation parameters as , _ e.g. _ , by the bohr hamiltonian @xcite , the geometric interpretation of the interacting boson model @xcite , or the gcm @xcite , a second problem arises . in general the shape parameters",
    "@xmath2 and @xmath3 do not have fixed values , because the nuclei have in general not a rigid shape but they are vibrating .",
    "thus it is useful to consider alternative parameters related to the shape of a nucleus , namely quadrupole shape invariants @xcite , which are model independent , and which are direct observables . in this paper",
    "we will discuss mainly the quadratic and cubic shape parameters @xmath4 and @xmath0 .",
    "we will focus on the relative cubic shape parameter @xmath5 , which is independent of the nuclear radius @xmath6 and the charge @xmath7 .",
    "we will show that it is possible to obtain @xmath4 , @xmath0 and @xmath1 with good accuracy from only few data .",
    "the cubic shape parameter @xmath1 is related to triaxiality and will be given for a variety of nuclei .",
    "its connection to the geometrical deformation parameters will be discussed .",
    "quadrupole shape invariants were introduced by kumar @xcite and widely used by cline and co - workers , _",
    "e.g. _ @xcite .",
    "they are expectation values in a given nuclear eigenstate of higher order moments of the e2 transition operator , which is usually taken to be the quadrupole operator . considering the ground state they are defined as @xmath8^{(0)}|0^+_1\\rangle \\ ,",
    "\\\\ \\label{eq : q4def } q_4 = & & e^4 \\langle 0^+_1|(q\\cdot q ) \\ ( q\\cdot q)|0^+_1\\rangle \\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the dot denotes a scalar product and brackets denote tensorial coupling , @xmath9 is the quadrupole operator and @xmath7 the elementary electric charge .",
    "higher order moments can also be defined and are related to fluctuations in @xmath0 , but will not be discussed here .",
    "the moments @xmath4 and @xmath0 can be written in terms of averages of geometrical deformation parameters as @xmath10 with @xmath11 these quadrupole shape invariants can be renormalized to the second order invariant @xmath4 by @xcite @xmath12 omitting the nuclear radius or the electric charge in this form .",
    "these quantities can in principle be obtained directly from data , but this is difficult in praxis because a large number of e2 matrix elements including signs is involved in expressions ( [ eq : q2def]-[eq : q4def ] ) .",
    "this can be seen expanding the invariants @xmath13 into sums over e2 matrix elements , which is shown here for @xmath4 and @xmath0 : @xmath14 an evaluation of @xmath4 and @xmath0 using extensive sets of experimental quadrupole matrix elements from multiple coulomb excitation has been done for some nuclei by d. cline and co - workers , _",
    "e.g. _ in @xcite .",
    "of course , the existence of such extensive data sets is the favorable , but it is not the general case .",
    "thus , there is great interest to obtain the shape invariants from more restricted sets of data .",
    "the basic idea is to invoke the @xmath9-phonon scheme as has been discussed in @xcite .",
    "this scheme was suggested by t. otsuka @xcite , and was developed by a kln - tokyo collaboration , _",
    "e.g. _ @xcite .",
    "the @xmath9-phonon scheme implies that the wave functions of low - lying states are exhausted by only a few multiple @xmath9-phonon configurations , where a @xmath9-phonon itself is an excitation by the quadrupole operator .",
    "the @xmath15 state in an even - even nucleus is dominantly a one-@xmath9-phonon state .",
    "it was shown @xcite that the @xmath9-phonon scheme holds with good accuracy for the lowest levels of collective nuclei . here , as we will consider only the very lowest states , we keep within the non - orthogonalized @xmath9-phonon scheme @xcite , which will be shown to be sufficient for our purpose .",
    "the @xmath9-phonon scheme gives a simple selection rule , namely , that an e2 transition between two states may change the number of @xmath9-phonons in first order only by one , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath16 . neglecting all @xmath9-forbidden transition matrix elements with @xmath17",
    "gives the first order approximation .",
    "we will denote quantities given in this first order approximation by a superscript @xmath18 .",
    "this leads to a drastic truncation in the matrix elements needed in the expansions in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : q2sum],[eq : q3sum ] ) , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xmath4 as given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : q2sum ] ) is approximated by @xmath19 because transitions from the two - phonon @xmath20 state or even higher - lying @xmath21 states to the ground state are @xmath9-forbidden in first order .",
    "( [ eq : q2appr ] ) reflects the well - known fact that in most even - even nuclei the largest part of the e2 excitation strength is concentrated in the first excited @xmath21 state . in the rigid rotor this b(e2 ) value",
    "is known to be directly proportional to the squared @xmath2-deformation by eq .",
    "( [ eq : q23geo ] ) . in the case of non - rigid @xmath2-deformation eq .",
    "( [ eq : q23geo ] ) defines an effective deformation parameter @xmath22 or , making use of the approximation ( [ eq : q2appr ] ) , an approximate @xmath23 .    using the @xmath9-phonon scheme in first order for @xmath0",
    "one obtains @xmath24 then , approximating the @xmath1-parameter following its definition in eq .",
    "( [ eq : kndef ] ) ( @xmath25 ) results in @xmath26 which is calculated from the ratio of the quadrupole moment of the @xmath15 state and its e2 matrix element to the ground state .",
    "it turns out , _",
    "e.g. _ , checking this approximation within the rigid triaxial rotor model or the ibm-1 , that such a rude truncation of the sum given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : q3sum ] ) is not sufficient for a good approximation to @xmath1 , as we will show in sections [ rotor ] and [ ibm ] .",
    "therefore , we used a second order approximation , allowing in each term of the sum _ only one _ @xmath9-forbidden matrix element with @xmath27 .",
    "doing so , we derive a second order approximation for @xmath0 as @xmath28 \\ , \\ ] ] which still includes only few e2 matrix elements . in the following",
    "we will always denote the second order approximation with the superscript @xmath29 instead of @xmath30 , as it is the only one we use .",
    "note that the approximation to @xmath4 in second order approximation is the same as in first order , as a @xmath9-forbidden matrix element would always appear squared and such terms are not included in this approximation , and we get @xmath31 dividing @xmath32 from eq .",
    "( [ eq : q3app ] ) by @xmath33 , we get a second order approximation for @xmath1 that includes only four different e2 matrix elements , involving the lowest two excited @xmath21 states and the ground state .",
    "a problem that appears is that the signs of the e2 matrix elements are needed , which are not known in most cases .",
    "usually we know only the b(e2 ) values which are @xmath34 this ambiguity in the signs can be avoided by using a relation between the signs of four matrix elements , suggested by jolos and von brentano @xcite : @xmath35 this relation gives the relative phase of the two terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq : q3app ] ) .",
    "there is still an overall sign of @xmath1 , which is the sign of the quadrupole moment of the @xmath15 state , deciding between prolate and oblate deformation .",
    "then , the second order approximation for @xmath36 is @xmath37 \\ , \\ ] ] where we use an alternative but elegant definition of the squared quadrupole moment following eq .",
    "( [ eq : be2 ] ) , @xmath38    the approximation formula for @xmath1 given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : k3appsig ] ) is the key result of this work .",
    "it allows to measure this observable directly and in a model independent way from only few data .",
    "these are four absolute b(e2 ) values , namely @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 , and the sign of the quadrupole moment of the @xmath15 state , which we consider as a fifth observable .",
    "this new method to determine @xmath1 is of particular importance because @xmath1 is closely connected to the triaxiality of nuclei , _",
    "i.e. _ to @xmath3-deformation . for axial symmetry @xmath43 for prolate ( @xmath44 ) and @xmath45 for oblate ( @xmath46 ) nuclei , while @xmath1 drops to zero at a maximum triaxiality of @xmath47 .",
    "this holds for geometrical models like the davydov - fillipov triaxial rotor model , as well as for the dynamical symmetries of the ibm .",
    "one major difference between these two models is that the ibm describes non - rigid @xmath2- and @xmath3-deformation , _",
    "e.g. _ , in the u(5 ) vibrational limit and the o(6 ) limit of @xmath3-soft nuclei , in both of which @xmath1 vanishes . in the su(3 ) and @xmath48 dynamical symmetries of the ibm , which correspond to the prolate and oblate axially symmetric rigid rotors , respectively , the same values for @xmath1 are derived as in the geometrical model . in the following we will check to which extent @xmath49 holds , using as a test the rigid triaxial rotor model of davydov and fillipov and the ibm-1 .",
    "the hamiltonian of the davydov - fillipov rotor model is @xmath50 where @xmath51 are the projections of the spin @xmath52 on the three symmetry axes , and where the parameters @xmath53 are connected to the moments of inertia @xmath54 by @xmath55 the moments of inertia can further be written in terms of the geometrical deformation parameters @xmath2 and @xmath3 , @xmath56 the e2 transition operator is given by @xmath57 \\ , \\ ] ] where the @xmath58 are the wigner-@xmath59-matrices and @xmath60 is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : q0 ] ) .",
    "we stress that this model with rigid @xmath2- and @xmath3-deformations is applicable to only a limited number of nuclei .",
    "nevertheless , apart from our discussion of the ground state deformation , the model is often applied to highly excited and strongly and also super - deformed bands as well , for which , in principle , our approach of @xmath61-parameters may also apply .    in our calculations",
    "we vary the parameter @xmath3 over the range ( @xmath62 $ ] ) , covering the range of prolate axially symmetric and triaxial structures inherent to the model .",
    "the results for @xmath63 $ ] are fully symmetric to those given and thus omitted .",
    "the choice of @xmath2 is arbitrary , as in the rigid case @xmath1 is independent of @xmath2 and is given by @xmath64 in a similar way one defines an approximate deformation @xmath65 from @xmath36 by @xmath66 in order to avoid the division by zero , we use the ratio @xmath67 as a measure of the quality of the approximation ( [ eq : k3k3app ] ) .",
    "the solid curve in the left panel of figure [ fig : k3geo ] shows the quantity @xmath68 versus the deformation parameter @xmath3 , calculated numerically using the code davidov @xcite . in the axially symmetric limit at @xmath44",
    "the approximation is exact .",
    "this also holds for the case of maximum triaxiality at @xmath47 , while @xmath68 is small for all intermediate cases with a deviation from one of 8@xmath69 in maximum .",
    "the dashed curve represents the same calculation , but using the first order approximation @xmath70 from eq .",
    "( [ eq : k3app ] ) .",
    "the deviation of the first order approximation is clearly much larger with a maximum of about 30@xmath69 , showing that the use of a second order approximation is unavoidable for transitional nuclei . on the right hand side of figure",
    "[ fig : k3geo ] the corresponding absolute deviation of @xmath65 derived from eq .",
    "( [ eq : gapp ] ) from the real @xmath3-values in the model is shown as a solid curve .",
    "the maximum deviation is below 3.5@xmath71 at @xmath72 .",
    "again , the deviation is much larger using only the first approximation , given as a dashed curve ..",
    "now , we check the quality of @xmath36 in the ibm-1 , within the extended consistent q formalism ( ecqf ) @xcite and the hamiltonian @xcite @xmath73 depending on only two structural parameters , @xmath74 and @xmath75 , and omitting an overall energy scale . the e2 transition operator in the ecqf is chosen to be proportional to the quadrupole operator in the hamiltonian , @xmath76 \\ , \\ ] ] with an effective boson charge @xmath77 , and @xmath78 is the boson number operator .",
    "varying the values of @xmath74 and @xmath75 over the full range of symmetries ( @xmath79 , \\chi\\in[-\\sqrt{7}/2,\\sqrt{7}/2]$ ] ) , one covers the dynamical symmetry limits of the ibm , namely u(5 ) ( @xmath80 ) , the prolate ( oblate ) su(3 ) ( @xmath81 ) ( @xmath82 ) , and o(6 ) ( @xmath83 ) , as well as the transitional structures in between . in analogy to eq .",
    "( [ eq : rgeo ] ) , we define the ratio @xmath84 which has been calculated over the full parameter space using the code phint @xcite .",

    "( [ eq : k3appsig ] ) .",
    "the results are shown in the top part of figure [ fig : k3ibm ] for @xmath85 bosons .",
    "they are given for @xmath86 , because the results for @xmath87 are fully symmetric , as the change in sign is equivalent to the symmetry transformation @xmath88 ( keeping @xmath89 ) .",
    "the use of positive @xmath75 values corresponds to the choice of @xmath90 in the geometrical model .",
    "deviations of @xmath36 from the exact @xmath1 values are small in all cases , the deviation of @xmath91 from 1 is below 7@xmath69 . for comparison ,",
    "figure [ fig : k3ibmbad ] shows @xmath92 , which is defined analog to eq . ( [ eq : ribm ] ) , but where the first order approximation , _",
    "i.e. _ eq . ( [ eq : k3app ] ) , is used .",
    "like in the geometrical model it is seen , that the deviations from the exact value of @xmath1 are much larger in the first order approximation .",
    "thus , in general it is necessary to use @xmath36 from eq .",
    "( [ eq : k3appsig ] ) .    the deviation @xmath91 peaks in a region around su(3 ) . a reason for this behavior",
    "is found by a close look at this region .",
    "the middle part of figure [ fig : k3ibm ] shows the values of @xmath1 and @xmath36 on the u(5)su(3 ) ( left ) and o(6)su(3 ) ( right ) transition legs .",
    "it is obvious that the maximum deviation of @xmath91 from unity appears in those regions , in which @xmath1 changes most rapidly .",
    "these are exactly those regions that are connected to the shape / phase transition between spherical and axially symmetric nuclei , or between prolate and oblate deformations , as discussed , _",
    "e.g. _ , in @xcite .",
    "this means that in the ibm the approximation @xmath36 misses the exact value of @xmath1 somewhat when leaving the rotational limit .",
    "however , overall deviations of @xmath91 from unity are small and the approximation ( [ eq : k3k3app ] ) is well fulfilled .    from comparison with the geometrical model an effective @xmath3-deformation",

    "the deviation of @xmath94 from @xmath96 is always smaller than 2.5@xmath71 .",
    "these effective @xmath3-values are not and can not be equivalent to those given by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : k3geo],[eq : gapp ] ) , because @xmath1 is not generally independent of @xmath2-deformation and fluctuations in @xmath2 occur , especially for vibrational nuclei .",
    "moreover , in case of rigid @xmath2 ( on the su(3)o(6 ) transitional line ) @xmath1 is a measure of @xmath97 , while in case of rigid @xmath3 it is a measure of @xmath98 .",
    "the effect of a @xmath2-vibration is only effectively taken out in the translation to the geometric model by eq .",
    "( [ eq : geff ] ) .",
    "however , if fluctuations in @xmath2 are small , which is the case past the phase transition towards deformed nuclei ( typically for @xmath99 ) , a factorization of the averages over @xmath2 and @xmath100 should work , and we can assume @xmath101 making @xmath96 comparable to the geometrical @xmath3-deformation .",
    "for the two considered models we have shown that @xmath36 is a good approximation to the value of the cubic shape parameter @xmath1 . thus we assume this to hold also in other collective models such as the gcm or the bohr hamiltonian .",
    "only few observables have to be obtained in order to derive @xmath36 , namely the lifetime of the @xmath15 state , the lifetime and the branching ratio of the @xmath20 state , and the quadrupole moment of the @xmath15 state . besides the modulus of @xmath1 also its sign is interesting , which is obtained from the sign of the quadrupole moment of the @xmath15 state .",
    "this quadrupole moment itself is not easy to obtain , therefore it is a challenge to measure triaxiality . especially for vibrational or @xmath3-soft nuclei , where the quadrupole moment is small ,",
    "high quality data is needed .",
    "thus , an approximate value of @xmath1 is so far known for a number of nuclei in or near the valley of stability only . for a set of nuclei that belong to various symmetry regions",
    "the @xmath36-parameter has been calculated from tabulated data .",
    "the results are given in table [ tab : k3nuc ] , together with effective @xmath3-deformation parameters derived from eq .",
    "( [ eq : geff ] ) , and effective @xmath2-deformations from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : q23geo],[eq : q2appr ] ) .    typical rotational nuclei like the heavier gd or dy isotopes show @xmath1 values around -1 as it is expected for prolate deformed axially symmetric shapes .",
    "also @xmath102sm and @xmath103gd , which are attributed @xcite to be close to the critical point symmetry x(5 ) proposed by f. iachello @xcite , show this value .",
    "the @xmath104-parameter obtained from @xmath105 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : q4def ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eq : kndef ] ) , which can be approximated in a similar way @xcite , gives a direct measure for @xmath2-softness .",
    "one finds that @xmath106 for @xmath2-rigid nuclei and @xmath107 for vibrators . for @xmath102sm and @xmath103gd",
    "one finds @xmath108 values of 1.02(3 ) @xcite and 1.088(26 ) @xcite , respectively , which , in combination with @xmath36 , meets the expectations for the vibrator to well - deformed rotor transition , more on the rotational side of the phase transition .",
    "especially @xmath102sm seems to be on the rotor side ( where @xmath109 and @xmath106 ) of the phase transition , which seemingly conflicts with the interpretation of this nucleus as being close to the phase transitional point .",
    "this may be related to the systematical error made in the approximations for @xmath1 , which maximizes exactly in the transitional region in the ibm , which may be reflected also in data .",
    "however , the systematical error made in the determination of @xmath104 should be smaller in that region @xcite and a problem remains .",
    "the @xmath1 values of the os isotopes show an evolution from the axially symmetric rotor towards o(6 ) symmetry with a maximum effective triaxiality of @xmath110 .",
    "note , that here one talks of _ effective _ @xmath3-deformation , as the nucleus does not have a rigid triaxiality .",
    "the more vibrational pd and cd isotopes show moderate values of @xmath1 with relatively large errors due to the quadrupole moments .",
    "non - zero values are not a contradiction to a more u(5 ) like structure as they may emanate from finite n effects ( see @xcite ) .",
    "an surprising conflict appears for @xmath111pt , which is usually taken as a prime example of o(6 ) symmetry @xcite , as well as for the neighboring @xmath112pt .",
    "both nuclei show rather large , positive quadrupole moments @xcite and thus have quite large values of @xmath36 .",
    "this shows that they are on the side of oblate deformation , with a considerable deviation of @xmath36 from the expectation value , @xmath113 .",
    "other observables like the branching ratio of the @xmath20 state or energies agree much better with the o(6 ) predictions .",
    "therefore , values of @xmath1 derived from an ibm fit ( see below ) agree much better with @xmath114 .",
    "one can not argue that this deviation is due to the dependence on @xmath2-fluctuations ( compare eq .",
    "( [ eq : geff ] ) ) . on the su(3)o(6 ) transition line , no @xmath2-fluctuations are allowed , and indeed , the shape invariant @xmath104 approximately equals 1 ( see @xcite ) for both nuclei , which pinpoints @xmath2-rigidity .",
    "again , this may be related to the maximal systematical error close to o(6 ) seen from figure [ fig : k3ibm ] .",
    "but , even if the value of @xmath1 is overpredicted from the approximation , a deviation from o(6 ) remains .",
    "however , we want to stress that these values , _",
    "e.g. _ @xmath115 instead of @xmath110 for @xmath116 , still indicate a strong triaxiality .",
    "it is only the quantitative value of @xmath96 which is in doubt .",
    "we stress that if one uses only the first order approximation , the value of @xmath1 is missed for transitional nuclei like the os isotopes , for which the transition @xmath117 is sizeable , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xmath118 for @xmath119os in the first order approximation , underestimating triaxiality , while the second order approximation gives @xmath120 .",
    "note , that for the electric quadrupole moment of the @xmath15 state , @xmath121 , is usually not easy to access experimentally .",
    "a new relation was found @xcite , however , which gives a new way to approximately determine @xmath121 or @xmath42 , respectively : @xmath122 this relation may be used to obtain the quadrupole moment as an input for @xmath1 , but it will give a large uncertainty especially for vibrational or @xmath3-soft nuclei , which have a small quadrupole moment .",
    "so far the relation ( [ eq : be2rel ] ) was only checked in the ibm @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : be2dav ] shows the deviation @xmath123 from the real value calculated within the rigid triaxial rotor model . also in the geometrical model the agreement is good .      in cases where not all of the needed data are present",
    ", one may follow another procedure , fitting parameters of a model to the available data for one nucleus , and calculating @xmath1 from the model .",
    "here we used the simple two parameter hamiltonian of the ibm given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hecqf ] ) .",
    "the two parameters were fitted to the energy ratio @xmath124 and the b(e2 ) ratio @xmath125 that are sensitive to changes in structure over wide parameter regions . for the reproduction of the energy ratio an error of 2@xmath69",
    "was allowed , while for the b(e2 ) ratio the experimental errors were taken into account , resulting in an allowed parameter range of @xmath74 and @xmath75 , in which @xmath1 takes various values within a certain range , with an upper a lower limit . in table",
    "[ tab : k3nuc ] we denote values of @xmath1 obtained from the fit as @xmath126 , and give the upper and lower limits allowed from the experimental errors .",
    "these values can be compared with the measured @xmath36 .",
    "the values agree reasonably well in most cases , considering the simplicity of the hamiltonian and the arbitrary choice of the two observables used in the fit .",
    "note , that other observables can be used for the fit .",
    "but in some cases the simple hamiltonian used can not describe all features of a given nucleus , as , _ e.g. _ , for the pt nuclei .",
    "therefore , the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hecqf ] ) may be extended or another model used .",
    "to conclude , we discussed measures of triaxiality . in this respect we considered in particular",
    "the absolute and relative cubic shape parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the approximative @xmath36 was introduced as a direct , model independent observable , which is , if @xmath2 is rigid , a measure of triaxiality , while @xmath36 is more general an observable in all structural limits and the regions between them .",
    "@xmath36 was shown to be a good approximation to the exact value of @xmath1 , and can with good accuracy be obtained from only four matrix elements , or from four b(e2 ) values , one of them equivalent to the modulus of the quadrupole moment @xmath121 , and the sign of @xmath121 .",
    "this , manifested in eq .",
    "( [ eq : k3appsig ] ) , is the key result of this work .",
    "this accuracy of the approximation was checked for the ibm and the rigid triaxial rotor model , and the need of the second order approximation within the @xmath9-phonon scheme was shown in both models , especially in transitional regions .",
