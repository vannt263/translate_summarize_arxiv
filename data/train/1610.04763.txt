    "in high intensity accelerators , the nonlinear space - charge effect from charged particle interactions inside the beam has significant impact on beam dynamics through the accelerator .",

    "multi - particle tracking has been employed to dynamically follow those charged particles through the accelerator . in the accelerator community ,",
    "most of those multi - particle tracking codes use particle - in - cell ( pic ) method to include the space - charge effect self - consistently in the simulation  @xcite .",
    "the particle - in - cell method is an efficient method in handling the space - charge effect self - consistently .",
    "it uses a computational grid to obtain the charge density distribution from a finite number of macroparticles and solves the poisson equation on the grid at each time step .",
    "the computational cost is linearly proportional to the number of macroparticles , which makes the simulation fast for many applications .",
    "however , those grid based , momentum conserved , pic codes do not satisfy the symplectic condition of classic multi - particle dynamics . violating the symplectic condition in multi - particle tracking",
    "might not be an issue in a single pass system such as a linear accelerator . in a circular accelerator , violating the symplectic condition may result in undesired numerical errors in the long - term tracking simulation .",
    "this issue together with the numerical grid heating was brought up during the 2015 space - charge workshop at oxford  @xcite .",
    "a gridless spectral based macroparticle model was suggested by the author at the workshop to mitigate the numerical grid heating and to satisfy the symplectic condition of particle tracking .",

    "is used to contain all charged particles through the accelerator .",
    "the poisson equation is solved in the beam frame to obtain electric coulomb fields from the charged particles .",
    "these electric fields are transformed to the laboratory frame through the lorentz transformation .",
    "the space - charge forces acting on each individual particle include both the electric fields and the magnetic fields , which is different from the electrostatic model that includes only electric fields . to the best of our knowledge , at present",
    ", there is no symplectic self - consistent space - charge model available in the accelerator community . in this paper ,",
    "following the idea suggested at the oxford workshop , we present a two - dimensional and a three - dimensional symplectic quasi - static multi - particle tracking model for space - charge simulations .",
    "the model presented here starts from the multi - particle hamiltonian directly and uses a gridless spectral method to calculate the space - charge forces .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows : after the introduction , we present the symplectic multi - particle tracking model including the space - charge effect in section ii ; we present a symplectic space - charge transfer map for a 2d coasting beam in section iii and a symplectic space - charge map for a 3d bunched beam in section iv ; we discuss computational complexity of the proposed model in section v and draw conclusions in section vi .",

    "a more detailed study of the numerical emittance growth associated with this new method is under way and will be reported in future publication .",

    "figure  [ 6demt ] shows the six - dimensional rms emittance growth ( @xmath142)% evolution through the periodic focusing channel from the above symplectic gridless spectral model and from the standard pic method with the spectral - finite difference poisson solver .",
    "it is seen that the symplectic spectral model gives much less numerical emittance growth than the standard pic method in the simulation using @xmath143 macroparticles .",
    "the gridless symplectic multi - particle spectral model can be used for long - term tracking study including space - charge effects .",

    "one can distribute all macroparticles uniformly across processors to achieve a perfect load balance . by using a spectral method with exponentially decreasing errors , the number of modes @xmath145 can be kept within a relatively small number , which significantly improves the computing speed .",

    "it is seen that the speedup increases almost linearly for both models .",
    "this is because both models have perfect load balance among all processors .",
    "the only communication involved in these models is a global reduction operation to obtain the density distribution in the frequency domain .",
    "the decrease of the speedup in the 2d case might be due to the specific computer architecture used in this timing study , which has @xmath150 shared memory computing cores inside a node . outside the node",
    ", the communication among processors ( cores ) is slowed down due to the across node communication .",
    "the above scaling results show that the symplectic multi - particle spectral space - charge tracking model can have a good scalability on multi - processor parallel computers and is especially suitable for tracking simulations on large scale supercomputers or gpu computers .",
    "in this paper , we proposed a new symplectic multi - particle tracking model for self - consistent space - charge simulation .",
    "this model uses a gridless spectral method to calculate the space - charge potential and while avoiding the error associated with numerical grid in the standard pic model .",
    "it also shows much less numerical noise driven emittance growth than the pic method for long term simulation . even though the computational cost of the symplectic spectral model is higher than the pic method on a single processor computer , the proposed model scales well on multi - processor parallel computers .",
    "it has a perfect load balance and uniform data structure , which is suitable for gpu parallel implementation .",
    "the new symplectic multi - particle spectral model enables researchers to carry out long term tracking studies including space - charge effects .",
    "the symplectic space - charge transfer map presented in this paper assumes a rectangular perfect conducting pipe .",
    "a transverse open boundary condition might be approximated using this model by moving the conducting wall away from the beam . for a general boundary condition ,",
    "it is quite difficult to obtain an analytical expression of the electric potential from an arbitrary density distribution . for a round perfect conducting pipe , a fourier mode and a bessel mode",
    "might be used to approximate the particle density distribution and the electric potential of the poisson equation in a cylindric coordinate system  @xcite .",
    "however , it takes more time to compute the bessel function expansion than the simple sine function expansion .",
    "the symplectic space - charge model presented here also assumes a straight conducting pipe .",
    "a study of the solution of the poisson equation in a bended conducting pipe using the frenet - serret coordinate was done in reference  @xcite and shows that for a large normalized bending radius ( bending radius / transverse aperture size ) , e.g. 100 , there is barely any difference between the straight pipe solution and the bended pipe solution .",
    "this condition ( large normalized bending radius ) can be satisfied in most circular accelerators .",
