    "with the recent discoveries of a few magnetars @xcite , the study of dense neutron star matter in presence of strong quantizing magnetic field has gained a new life .",
    "these strange stellar objects are supposed to be strongly magnetized , relatively young ( age @xmath5yrs . )",
    "neutron stars and are also believed to be the possible sources of anomalous x - ray pulses and soft gamma ray emissions ( axp and sgr ) . as surface magnetic fields of these high magnetically - powered neutron stars are observed to be @xmath6 g ,",
    "then a theoretical estimation from virial theorem predicts that the field at the core region may be @xmath7 g .",
    "now , if the magnetic fields are really so strong , particularly at the central region , they must affect most of the physical properties of those strange stellar objects .",
    "also , different physical processes taking place at the core region should get modified significantly .",
    "the strong magnetic field at the core region affects the equation of state of the neutron star matter and as a consequence , some of the gross properties , e.g. mass - radius relation , moment of inertia , rotational frequency etc . of neutron stars should change to a great extent @xcite .    in the case of compact neutron stars , the possibility of first order phase transition to quark matter at the core region is found to be completely forbidden if the magnetic field strength exceeds @xmath8 g . however , a second order phase transition is allowed , provided the field strength is @xmath9 g @xcite .",
    "we have noticed that the elementary processes , e.g. weak and electromagnetic reactions and decays are also strongly influenced by such intense magnetic field . as the cooling of neutron stars are mainly controlled by neutrino emissions through weak processes ( urca or modified urca ) , the presence of strong quantizing magnetic field should significantly affect the thermal evolution of neutron stars .",
    "further , the rates of the electromagnetic processes in presence of strong quantizing magnetic field should modify significantly the transport properties of dense stellar matter , in particular for electron gas present at the core region of the neutron stars @xcite .",
    "we have noticed that the electron gas behaves like a neutral super fluid if the magnetic field strength exceeds @xmath10",
    "g @xcite .",
    "it has also been observed that chiral symmetry gets violated in presence of strong magnetic field .",
    "the strong quantizing magnetic field acts like a catalyst to generate the mass dynamically .",
    "a lot of investigations have already been done in this field @xcite .    in the general relativistic model some investigations",
    "have also been done to study the stability of neutron stars in presence of strong magnetic field .",
    "it is found that there are possibilities of geometrical deformations from the usual spherical shapes and in the extreme case of ultra strong magnetic field , they become either black disks or black strings @xcite .",
    "in one of our recent studies , we have developed a relativistic formalism of landau theory of fermi liquid for dense neutron star matter in presence of strong quantizing magnetic field with @xmath0 meson exchange @xcite . in the present article",
    "we shall re - formulate our previous work as cited above , incorporating @xmath1-meson ( both charged and neutral components ) exchange interactions . to obtain the self - energies for both neutron and proton components from the landau quasi - particle interaction functions considering nucleonic interactions via the exchange of @xmath11 mesons",
    ", we have also included the effect of strong quantizing magnetic field on charged meson propagators .    to evaluate the self - energy of landau quasi - particles , we have considered a typical many body fermionic system ( in this case it is neutron star matter ) in presence of strong quantizing magnetic field at zero temperature , interacting via scalar , vector and iso - vector meson fields ( as mentioned above ) .",
    "this formalism is also useful to obtain the quasi - particle energy of other fermionic many body system , e.g. , electron gas or even for exotic quark matter in presence of strong magnetic field .",
    "the formalism is also applicable to study the magnetic properties and the non - equilibrium properties ( e.g. , the transport properties ) of dense stellar plasma of fermions .",
    "now similar to the conventional non - relativistic model of landau theory of fermi liquid , this modified version also deals with normal fermi liquid and is applicable for the low - lying excited states of the system , which consists of a superposition of quasi - particle excitation close to the fermi surface .",
    "the formalism we have developed in this article is basically a re - formulation of our previous work @xcite and an extension of a very old paper by baym and chin @xcite .",
    "of course , in the present investigation , we have found a new and interesting result , the complex nature of nucleonic self energies in the mean field approximation .",
    "the paper is arranged in the following manner . in the next section",
    "we are giving a general overview of the behavior of a fermionic system in a strong quantizing magnetic field .",
    "in section 2 , we shall consider a typical dense neutron star matter in presence of strong quantizing magnetic field interacting via @xmath12 mesons exchange and develop a formalism to obtain the equation of state for dense neutron star matter in presence of strong quantizing magnetic fields . in the case of @xmath13 and @xmath14 ( or @xmath11 , the positive and negative components respectively ) exchange interactions",
    ", we shall incorporate the effect of strong quantizing magnetic field on their propagators . in section 3 , we have concluded the results and discussed the future perspective of this work .",
    "in the case of a typical many body fermionic system , let us consider the @xmath15th type fermion of charge @xmath16 and mass @xmath17 ( of course , in the case of neutron component of neutron star matter , since @xmath18 , then one has to use the original work by baym and chin and the same formalism is also applicable if the magnetic field strength is less than the quantum critical value ) .",
    "we assume the gauge @xmath19 , so that the constant magnetic field b@xmath20 is along @xmath21-axis . if the magnetic field strength @xmath22 exceeds the quantum critical value @xmath23 , the landau levels for the @xmath15th charged component will be populated and the matter is called the landau diamagnetic system . in the relativistic region",
    "the charged matter shows landau diamagnetic behavior , if the cyclotron quantum of the charged components exceeds the corresponding rest mass energy or equivalently the de broglie wave length exceeds the larmor radius of the charged particle . under such circumstances",
    "the phase space integral will get modified and is given by @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the degeneracy , @xmath26 is the landau quantum number and @xmath27 is a function of particle momentum . at zero temperature ,",
    "the above modified form reduces to @xmath28 } ( 2-\\delta_{\\nu_0})\\int_{-p_{f_i}}^{+p_{f_i}}dp_{z}f(p_z,\\nu)\\ ] ] where @xmath29=\\frac{(\\mu_{i}^{2}-m_{i}^{2})}{2q_{i}b_{m}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] is an integer but less than the actual value of right hand side , @xmath30 is the chemical potential of the @xmath15th charged component and @xmath31 is the corresponding fermi momentum .",
    "now it can very easily be shown from the solution of dirac equation in presence of such strong magnetic field that the zeroth landau level is singly degenerate , whereas all other levels are doubly degenerate ( which is incorporated in eqn.(1 ) by introducing the factor @xmath32 ) .",
    "further , the energy eigen value is given by @xmath33 and therefore the chemical potential is simply given by @xmath34 with @xmath35 the orthogonal component of charged particle momentum ( in the @xmath36 plane ) , which varies in a discrete manner , hence the name , landau quantization .",
    "in presence of strong quantizing magnetic field as discussed above , it can very easily be shown that in standard notation , the modified form of dirac spinors for the charged components are given by @xmath37 where @xmath38^{1/2 } } \\left ( \\begin{array}{c } ( e_{\\nu}+m)i_{\\nu;p_y}(x)\\\\0\\\\p_zi_{\\nu;p_y}(x)\\\\ -i(2\\nu q_ib_m)^{1/2}i_{\\nu-1;p_y}(x ) \\end{array } \\right)\\ ] ] and @xmath39^{1/2 } } \\left ( \\begin{array}{c } 0\\\\(e_{\\nu}+m)i_{\\nu-1;p_y}(x)\\\\i(2\\nu q_ib_m)^{1/2}i_{\\nu;p_y}(x)\\\\ -p_zi_{\\nu -1;p_y}(x ) \\end{array } \\right ) \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the symbols @xmath40 and @xmath41 indicate the up and the down spin states respectively and @xmath42\\nonumber \\\\ h_\\nu \\left [ ( qb_m)^{1/2}\\left ( x-\\frac{p_y}{qb_m } \\right ) \\right ] \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath43 the well - known hermite polynomial of order @xmath44 and @xmath45 are length scales along @xmath46 and @xmath21 directions respectively .",
    "now for a dense relativistic many body system of fermions interacting via scalar , vector and iso - vector fields , represented by @xmath47 with masses @xmath48 respectively , the basic lagrangian density is given by @xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the coupling constants corresponding to vector , scalar and iso - vector interactions ; @xmath52 are the free lagrangian densities for vector , scalar and iso - vector field respectively and @xmath53 is the lagrangian density electromagnetic part corresponding to constant external magnetic field @xmath22 along @xmath21-axis . here",
    "the iso - vector fields behaves like a four vector in configuration space ( represented by @xmath54 ) but like a three vector in iso - spin space ( represented by the symbol @xmath55 ) .",
    "now in the landau theory of fermi liquid , to evaluate various physical quantities of the system , it is a common practise to switch on the interactions adiabatically .",
    "the normal fermi liquid system will then evolve from non - interacting states to interacting states and there will be a one - to - one correspondence between the dressed or quasi - particle states of the interacting system to the bare non interacting states . to obtain @xmath56 , the landau fermi liquid interaction function ,",
    "also known as the quasi - particle interaction function , we have considered both direct and exchange type interactions .",
    "the exchanged bosons are either scalar or vector or iso - vector type .",
    "the quasi - particle interaction functions are related to the two - particle forward scattering via the exchange of any one of these bosons .",
    "we further assume that the external magnetic field acts as a constant background and is present everywhere . in the next subsection",
    "we consider the processes with scalar boson exchange .",
    "to compute the landau - fermi liquid interaction function @xmath56 from two particle forward scattering matrix with scalar boson ( @xmath2 ) exchange , we start with the definition of transition matrix element , given by @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the scalar density and @xmath59 is the scalar field satisfies the the well known klein - gordan equation @xmath60 the solution of this equation can be obtained by green s function technique and is given by @xmath61}{q^2-\\zeta^2 } \\rho_{s}(x^\\prime)d^4x^\\prime\\ ] ] where @xmath62 is the exchanged four momentum .",
    "now to evaluate @xmath63 , we substitute the green s function solution ( eqn.14 ) into eqn.(12 ) to obtain @xmath64 and finally putting it into eqn.(11 ) .",
    "we consider the following strong interaction processes : @xmath65 the basic diagrams are as follows :    we evaluate @xmath63 for both direct and exchange type interactions for all these processes .",
    "we first consider the scattering process represented by @xmath66 .",

    "further , these results play key roles in all kinds of calculation related to the electromagnetic and weak interactions in presence of strong quantizing magnetic field . in a recently completed work",

    "although the structural forms of both eqns.(40 ) and ( 31 ) are identical , the appearance of proton energy in the denominator of eqn.(40 ) makes it qualitatively different from eqn.(31 ) .",

    "we have evaluated numerically the total self energy density for nucleons ( both protons and neutrons separately ) then plotted the average proton self energy as a function of proton density and are shown in the following two figures . to draw these figures ,",

    "we further assume the charge neutrality condition , given by @xmath258 and assuming that the baryon number density @xmath259 remains constant . to solve for the chemical potentials @xmath30 , where @xmath260 and @xmath261 , we use @xmath262 @xmath263 }",

    "as one can see from these two figures that the real part always increases with the increase of matter density but the matter becomes more stable if the magnetic field is stronger . which is also true in all other cases , e.g. , atoms , quark matter etc .",
    "@xcite in strong quantizing magnetic fields . whereas the imaginary part decreases with the increase of matter density and at very high density",
    "the imaginary part is almost negligibly small with respect to the corresponding real part .",
    "the reason is that at very high density , the effect of landau levels become insignificant , in other ward , at high enough density the magnetic field no longer has quantum mechanical effect . on the other hand at low density ,",
    "it is significant and the effect is more as the magnetic field becomes stronger .    for the sake of completeness",
    "we have also plotted the life time of nucleons ( both neutron and proton ) as a function of proton density , for three different magnetic field strengths .",
    "the life times are in the strong interaction time scale within a broad density range . because of such small time scale we belive that the bulk neutron star matter remains stable against strong decay , just like a nucleus is a stable object although strong interaction processes are going on inside",
    ". the other extreme could be that the magnetic field strength at the core region of magnetars are much smaller than the quantum critical value and the observed strong magnetic fields are concentrated at the crustal region .",
    "we therefore conclude that in the relativistic version of landau theory of fermi liquid in presence of strong quantizing magnetic field , although the self - energies for both neutron and proton become complex in nature , the bulk neutron star matter still remain stable against strong decay .",
    "we have noticed from the complex nature of self - energies for both the dressed protons and neutrons , that the life time is within the strong interaction scale and we belive that just like a stable nucleus , the bulk neutron star matter will also remain stable in presence of strong quantizing magnetic field .    the other explanation , which is of course not so convincing is that , we can have a stable dense neutron matter at the central region of a magnetar with a very low magnetic field strength .",
    "the observed strong magnetic field in such objects are concentrated at the crustal region .",
    "however , in our opinion , the best explanation to have a magnetic field of strength @xmath265 g at the surface and several orders of magnitude large field at the core is that the conducting ( and possibly not superconducting because the field strength is @xmath266 the critical value ) neutron star matter does not allow the magnetic flux lines to move from the core region to the crust . since the density of neutron star matter at the core region is high enough , a large number of landau levels will be populated , even if the field strength is extremely high . which further means , that the quantum mechanical effect of strong magnetic field will be extremely weak .    finally , we would like to add a few words to compare the results , in particular the complex nature of nucleon self energies we obtained in this work with some of the well known phenomena already discussed in the literature .",
    "about sixty years ago l.d .",
    "landau had shown the possibility of some kind of damping or dissipation in collisionless plasmas and this phenomenon is known as _",
    "landau damping _ @xcite . being independent of collisions , it is fundamentally different from dissipation in ordinary absorbing media ; the collisionless dissipation does not involve an increase of entropy and is therefore a thermodynamically reversible process . in this phenomenon",
    ", there is a continuous exchange of energy between plasma waves ( produced by some external perturbation ) and plasma particles . as a consequence",
    "the self energy of plasma particles become complex and they loose energy to plasma wave reversibly and in the very next step again gain energy from the plasma waves and the process of loss and gain continues , but does not decay to other particles .",
    "this phenomenon makes the system mechanically stable .",
    "the evaluation of nucleon self energy @xmath267 in relativistic approaches has been restricted mainly to the real part of @xmath267 in either the _ mean field theory _ or the _ relativistic hartree approximation_. in these approximations the self - energy is real , local and energy independent .",
    "it is completely determined once the constant effective mass and the mean constant value of vector potential is know @xcite .    however , the imaginary part of the self - energy , which in reality the imaginary part of optical potential has been studied to lowest order by horowitz @xcite . here , only the on - shell properties of @xmath268 is important and is restricted to a limited energy range .",
    "he obtained a quantity similar to the imaginary part of optical potential by the cancellations of large contributions coming from the exchange of scalar and vector mesons ; between scalar , time - like and three - vector contributions which are also independently very large .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , real and imaginary parts of nucleon self - energy was obtained with _",
    "relativistic dirac - bruckner _ approach assuming @xmath0 meson exchange . in this paper fourth order meson - nucleon coupling was considered and studied the off - shell behaviour of imaginary part of the nucleon self energy .    in the reference @xcite dyson equation",
    "is used to obtain the nucleon self energy @xmath269 . in this paper",
    "the irreducible self energy is calculated by summing over the dyson expansion to all order .",
    "it is shown that in the lowest order diagrams the irreducible self - energy contains mean field part and the hartree - fock contribution .",
    "both of them are real in nature .",
    "the dynamic part of the self energy is expressed in terms of the four point vertex function .",
    "however , the complex nature of nucleon self - energy as we have obtained in this article , arises because of some kind of mixing in the iso - spin space ( the modified form of _ projection operators _ e.g. , @xmath149 and @xmath148 are actually responsible for such strange phenomena .",
    "these modified form of projection operators are again coming because in presence strong quantizing magnetic field , the landau levels of protons are only populated , whereas neutrons behave classically ) and it is at present very difficult to predict what will happen to these nucleons with complex energy .",

    "<S> using the relativistic version of landau theory of fermi liquid with @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons exchange , we have obtained an equation state for dense neutron star matter in presence of strong quantizing magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that in this scenario the self - energies of both neutron and proton components of dense neutron star matter become complex under certain physical conditions . to be more specific </S>",
    "<S> , it is observed that in the exchange diagrams of @xmath2 , @xmath3 and neutral @xmath1 transfer processes and in the direct interaction diagram with @xmath4 transfer reactions , the nucleon self - energies become complex in nature . </S>"
