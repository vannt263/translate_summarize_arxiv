    "photonic and optoelectronic applications heavily rely on materials with high nonlinear optical responses , and the development of new and more efficient materials for nonlinear optics ( nlo ) is a key issue in present days research . in this context , organic materials play an important role in view of their large and fast nlo responses and of the tunability of their properties via chemical synthesis.@xcite in order to trace guide - lines to organic synthesis , much effort is devoted to understand the origin of nonlinearity in these systems and to relate nlo responses to electronic structure and molecular geometry.@xcite mobile electrons are required for large nonlinearity and conjugated molecules and/or polymers are materials of choice for nlo applications.@xcite vibrations are strongly coupled to conjugated electrons:@xcite the effect of electron - phonon ( e - ph ) coupling in nlo responses at optical frequencies is not fully understood yet@xcite , but general agreement has emerged on the importance of e - ph coupling in static nlo responses.@xcite    static susceptibilities are the opposite of the successive derivatives of the ground state ( gs ) energy with respect to a static electric field ( @xmath0 ) : @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the gs energy at zero field , @xmath3 is the permanent dipole moment , @xmath4 is the linear polarizability , and @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the first and second hyperpolarizabilities , respectively . as it is always the case for energy derivatives , two different methods can be adopted to evaluate susceptibilities.@xcite the first method , the so - called finite - field ( ff ) approach , basically relies on direct numerical derivation techniques .",
    "the relevant system is the molecule in the presence of an external static electric field.@xcite the corresponding hamiltonian is diagonalized to calculate the gs energy ( or dipole moment ) at different @xmath0 values , and ( hyper)polarizabilities are calculated as numerical derivatives of the energy ( or dipole moment ) with respect to the electric field .",
    "the second approach treats @xmath0 as a perturbation on the molecular states , leading to the well - known sum over states ( sos ) formulas.@xcite the main advantage of sos over ff is that only unperturbed ( @xmath7 ) eigenstates are required .",
    "the main disadvantage is that all eigenstates and transition dipole moments are required , whereas ff only requires the gs energy ( or dipole moment ) .",
    "of course the two approaches are perfectly equivalent if exact energies and eigenstates , including vibrational contributions , are inserted into equations .",
    "but for molecules and , more generally , for molecular materials , exact vibronic eigenstates are hardly accessible , and several approximations are introduced .",
    "approximated calculations based on ff or sos approaches are clearly different and it is important to investigate the merit and reliability of the various approximation schemes .    the first approximation usually introduced is the adiabatic ( born - oppennheimer , bo ) approximation .",
    "this is an almost ubiquitous approximation in molecular and condensed matter physics : accounting for the different masses of electrons and nuclei ( and then for the different time scales of their motions ) , bo approximation separates electronic and vibrational degrees of freedom , so that each state is factorized into a product of an electronic and a vibrational wavefunction .",
    "this approximation is fairly safe : deviations from the adiabatic regime are expected only for degenerate or quasi - degenerate states , for narrow - band solids,@xcite or near to phase transitions.@xcite    in sos approaches bo factorization is used to separate electronic and vibrational contributions to susceptibilities .",
    "electronic contributions are those where all summations run on vibronic states in the excited electronic manifolds , whereas vibrational contributions have at least one of the indices in the summation running over excited vibrational states within the gs manifold.@xcite in the same spirit as bo , clamped nucleus ( cn ) approximation has been proposed to calculate sos expressions for susceptibilities in a two - step procedure.@xcite in the first step the electronic ( hyper)polarizabilities are calculated with nuclei clamped at their equilibrium positions .",
    "the resulting electronic contributions to ( hyper)polarizabilities only contain sums over purely electronic states . in the second step the nuclear motion on the gs potential energy surface ( pes )",
    "is accounted for , and vibrational contributions to susceptibilities are obtained . the adiabatic approximation , as directly applied to sos or within the cn formalism , makes the calculation of susceptibilities possible , provided that electronic and vibrational eigenstates are known .",
    "however , in view of the anharmonicity of the relevant pes , calculating the vibrational states in all electronic manifolds ( as required in bo - sos formalism ) or just in the gs manifold ( as required in cn - sos ) is not easy .",
    "often sos calculations of static ( hyper)polarizabilities of molecules and/or polymers are carried out in the harmonic approximation,@xcite where the solution of the vibrational problem can be written in closed form .",
    "harmonic schemes work in the hypothesis that the electronic system responds linearly to the nuclear motion : harmonic approximation is bound to fail in systems where vibrations are coupled to mobile electrons , i.e. to electrons characterized by large nonlinear responses.@xcite in fact large anharmonic corrections to nlo responses have been recognized in recent _ ab initio _",
    "calculations on conjugated molecules and polymers.@xcite    when applied to ff approaches , bo quite naturally leads to a two - step procedure .",
    "first of all the adiabatic electronic hamiltonian ( i.e. the total hamiltonian minus the nuclear kinetic energy , ke , term ) is solved to get the gs electronic energy , that represents the potential energy ( pe ) for the nuclear motion .",
    "its derivatives on @xmath0 measure the pe contributions to susceptibilities .",
    "the calculation of the pe contribution is easy since only the gs electronic energy is required .",
    "moreover , if nuclei are allowed to relax in response to @xmath0 , susceptibilities calculated as pe derivatives naturally include vibrational contributions , and fully account for anharmonicity . the second step accounts for ke contribution : this is a more difficult step because the energy of the lowest vibrational state has to be calculated as a function of @xmath0 , a non - trivial task due to anharmonicity .",
    "moreover , in systems with large e - ph coupling , like conjugated polymers and/or oligomers , it can be difficult to get reliable calculations of @xmath0-dependent geometries , and numerical instabilities of the energy derivatives are sometimes observed.@xcite    in this paper we critically review the different approximation schemes for the calculation of static nlo responses , when applied to molecules of interest for nlo applications . in these molecules , in fact , electron - phonon coupling has particularly large and non - trivial effects , shedding doubts on the reliability of approximations that work well in more conventional systems .",
    "in particular we will focus on an interesting toy - model for mobile electrons coupled to vibrations : the holstein @xmath8 dimer .",
    "the so - called @xmath8 dimer is a two - state model originally proposed by mulliken to describe electron donor - acceptor charge transfer ( ct ) complexes in solution.@xcite later on it was applied by oudar and chemla@xcite to describe push - pull chromophores where the donor and acceptor moieties are linked by a @xmath9-conjugated bridge to form a molecule .",
    "the extension of the model to include holstein coupling to vibrations was first suggested by person et al.@xcite to describe vibrational spectra of ct complexes , and was extensively discussed in the 80 s to describe many properties ( ranging from vibrational spectra to structural instabilities ) of ct salts.@xcite holstein coupling in the @xmath8 dimer has also been adopted to describe vibrations and/or polar solvation effects in push - pull chromophores@xcite : an extensive comparison with spectral data for several key molecules proved that this model contains the main ingredients to understand nonlinearity in these systems.@xcite in spite of its richness , the model is very simple and in the next section we will describe its exact , non - adiabatic eigenstates , as well as its bo solution .",
    "sections iii and iv discuss the approximations usually introduced in sos and ff approaches , respectively ; section v summarizes main results .",
    "the @xmath8 dimer describes two electronic states , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , linearly coupled to a harmonic phonon , as depicted in fig .  1 . the relevant hamiltonian is ( @xmath12 ) : @xmath13 the first two terms in the above equation describe the electronic hamiltonian , where @xmath14 is the ionicity operator , and @xmath15 , @xmath16 represent the pauli spin operators .",
    "the third and fourth terms describe a harmonic vibration of frequency @xmath17 ( @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the corresponding coordinate and momentum ) , coupled to the electronic system .",
    "the strength of the coupling is measured by @xmath20 , the relaxation energy of @xmath11 ( see fig .",
    "the last term accounts for a static electric field , @xmath0 , interacting with the dipole moment operator , defined , by @xmath21 , with @xmath22.@xcite in the following , energies are expressed in @xmath23 units .",
    "we underline that the single - mode hamiltonian in the above equation captures the essential physics of e - ph coupling , at least if one is not interested in the detailed description of vibrational spectra.@xcite the extension to the multimode case , possible in principle , is very demanding if the non - adiabatic solution is required .",
    "the above hamiltonian can be numerically diagonalized on the basis of the direct product of the two electronic states @xmath10 and @xmath11 and of the reference vibrational states ( i.e. the eigenstates of the harmonic oscillator in the third term of eq .",
    "( [ hamiltonian])).@xcite the basis is truncated by fixing a maximum number of phonon states , @xmath24 ; the corresponding @xmath25 matrix can be diagonalized up to fairly large @xmath24 values , yielding numerically exact non - adiabatic eigenstates .",
    "the minimum @xmath24 required to get convergence depends on the model parameters and on the properties of interest .",
    "all results presented in the following have been obtained with @xmath26 .",
    "the exact non - adiabatic eigenstates at @xmath7 are inserted into standard sos expressions for static susceptibilities@xcite to get the exact nlo responses reported as continuous lines in fig .  2 for @xmath27 and a few @xmath17 values .",
    "by the way , exactly the same results are obtained , within ff approach , from the successive derivatives of the exact non - adiabatic gs energy vs the applied field . in the same figure",
    ", dot - dashed lines correspond to the bare electronic susceptibilities , @xmath28 , i.e. to the response of the two - state model with no e - ph coupling .",
    "the deviations of the continuous lines from the dot - dashed lines measure the vibrational contribution to static responses .",
    "dashed lines show the pe contribution to susceptibilities .",
    "analytical expressions for these curves have already been reported in ref .",
    "@xcite : pe - susceptibilities are independent of @xmath17 . fig .",
    "2 clearly shows the evolution of static susceptibilities with phonon frequency : in the low-@xmath17 limit , ke contributions vanish , and the exact curves tend to the limiting pe results .",
    "vibrational contributions to static susceptibilities are very large in this limit , and increase with the order of nonlinearity .",
    "with increasing @xmath17 , the vibrational contributions to static nlo responses decrease : in the antiadiabatic limit ( @xmath29 ) the vibrational contributions to static hyperpolarizabilities vanishes , and the exact curves tend to the bare electronic responses .    for real molecules or complexes",
    ", the large number of electronic states makes non - adiabatic calculations very demanding , and bo approximation is usually invoked . in bo approximation the effective electronic hamiltonian , @xmath30 , is defined by subtracting the nuclear ke term from the total hamiltonian . in our case",
    "@xmath31 describes two electronic states separated by an energy gap that linearly depends on @xmath18 , according to @xmath32.@xcite by diagonalizing the electronic @xmath33 matrix one gets analytical expressions for the @xmath18-dependent ground and excited state energies , as shown in fig .",
    "it is important to recognize that , even if the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ hamiltonian ] ) is defined in terms of harmonic reference states ( fig .",
    "1a ) , as a consequence of e - ph coupling , the ground and excited state pes are anharmonic ( fig .",
    "the anharmonicity of the potential prevents the analytical solution of the vibrational problem on either the ground or excited state ; however numerically exact vibrational states can be calculated in both manifolds .",
    "in particular , the eigenstates of the harmonic oscillator with frequency @xmath17 , centered at the relevant equilibrium position , are a good basis for the vibrational problem on either pes .",
    "the corresponding vibrational hamiltonian is the sum of a ke term , whose matrix elements are trivial in the adopted basis , plus a pe term , whose matrix elements are calculated via numerical integration .",
    "of course the vibrational matrix is diagonalized on a basis truncated to a large enough number of phonon states as to get convergence .",
    "results presented in this paper have typically been obtained with 20 phonon states .",
    "once bo eigenstates are obtained , the ( transition ) dipole moments entering sos expressions can be calculated via numerical integration .",
    "static susceptibilities calculated within bo approximation are indistinguishable ( in the scale of fig .",
    "2 ) from the exact ones , as long as @xmath34 .",
    "3 compares non - adiabatic ( continuous lines ) and bo ( dashed lines ) static susceptibilities for @xmath35 , where deviations appear .",
    "of course bo approximation becomes worst with increasing @xmath17 and is totally untenable for @xmath36 .",
    "the adopted value of the small polaron binding energy , @xmath37 applies to both push - pull chromophores@xcite and to ct complexes and salts.@xcite in push - pull chromophores the typical value of @xmath38  ev is much larger than typical vibrational frequencies ( @xmath39  @xmath40)@xcite and the dimensionless @xmath41 is safely in the bo regime . in ct salts , instead",
    ", @xmath42 is much smaller ( @xmath43  ev)@xcite and the corresponding dimensionless @xmath44 suggests seizable non - adiabatic effects in nlo responses of these ( narrow - band ) systems .",
    "the separation of electronic and vibrational degrees of freedom in bo approximation not only leads to simpler calculations , but also allows for additional insight .",
    "when applied to sos expressions , bo quite immediately leads to a separation of electronic and vibrational contributions .",
    "if @xmath45 indicates a bo vibronic state , i.e. the product between an electronic state @xmath46 and a vibrational state @xmath47 in the @xmath48 manifold , the sos expressions for static susceptibilities read:@xcite @xmath49 where the gs , @xmath50 , is excluded from the summations , @xmath51 is the frequency of the @xmath52 transition , and @xmath53 . in the two - state model",
    ", the summations on @xmath48 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 only run on the two electronic states @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "then , according to the standard definition@xcite , the electronic contribution to susceptibilities is given by terms in eq .",
    "( [ sos ] ) with @xmath58 , and the vibrational contribution is described by terms where at least one of @xmath48 , @xmath54 or @xmath55 states coincides with @xmath56 .",
    "we underline that electronic contributions to bo - sos susceptibilities do not coincide with the responses of the bare electronic system ( dot - dashed lines in fig .  2 ) .",
    "in fact summations in eq .",
    "( [ sos ] ) run on vibronic states and not on pure electronic states . in the reliability range of bo approximation , closure on vibrational states in the excited state manifold works fine in reducing sums on intermediate vibronic states into sums on pure electronic states , but the property is evaluated for the true vibronic gs ( @xmath50 ) and not as a pure electronic property ( mediated over @xmath56 ) : the electronic contribution to bo - sos susceptibilities partly include zero - point vibrational average ( zpva ) corrections , as defined in ref.@xcite .",
    "the cn approximation@xcite introduces a different way of partitioning electronic and vibrational degrees of freedom . in this approach the electronic contribution to the @xmath59-th order susceptibility is calculated as the @xmath59-th order bare electron susceptibility , @xmath60 .",
    "two more contributions are then added to get the total response : ( a ) zpva corrections , that account for the difference between the electronic susceptibility calculated at the bottom of the gs pes ( i.e. at the equilibrium geometry ) and that relevant to the ground vibronic state ( due to anharmonicity the relevant geometry does not coincide with the equilibrium one ) .",
    "these corrections are usually calculated via an expansion of electronic susceptibilities on @xmath18;@xcite ( b ) vibrational contributions , that are calculated in terms of summations running on the vibrational states in the gs manifold only , as detailed in ref.@xcite .",
    "bo - sos and cn - sos are based on the same adiabatic approximation and lead to basically identical results at least as long as the adiabatic approximation itself is reliable ( approximately @xmath61 )",
    ". however , the partitioning of the susceptibilities is different and there is not a one - to - one correspondence between terms appearing in the two schemes : cn - sos kills a few terms appearing in bo - sos , and , at the same time , some of the terms , that are usually considered as corresponding,@xcite do not have exactly the same meaning in the two approaches . as a matter of fact , differences between cn and bo results amount to @xmath62 and @xmath63 in the electronic @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively , and @xmath64 and @xmath65 in the vibrational contributions to @xmath5 and @xmath6 ( these estimates refer to the parameters @xmath66 , @xmath67 ; for @xmath68 deviations are even smaller ) .",
    "these small differences compensate each other , leading to negligible ( @xmath69 1% ) differences in the total ( electronic+vibrational ) responses",
    ".    our numerical solution of the adiabatic problem for the two - state model allowed us to test bo and cn approximations without introducing additional approximations .",
    "however getting exact vibrational eigenstates is hardly possible for complex ( molecular ) structures .",
    "for this reason cn - sos calculations are often implemented by invoking the harmonic approximation for the vibrational problem.@xcite as already stressed in the introduction , the harmonic approximation fails in systems where vibrations are coupled to electrons with large nonlinear responses .",
    "the relation between anharmonicity and nonlinearity is very well apparent in the adopted model , where both @xmath18 and @xmath0 variables are coupled to the same electronic operator , @xmath70 ( cf eq .",
    "( [ hamiltonian ] ) ) .",
    "successive @xmath18-derivatives of the ground and excited state pe ( @xmath71 and @xmath72 , respectively ) are therefore directly related to @xmath0-derivatives , i.e. to the bare electronic susceptibilities , @xmath28 , as follows : @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the kronecker-@xmath75 , equal to 1 if @xmath76 , zero otherwise . from this equation",
    "it turns out that systems with large _",
    "hyper_polarizabilities , i.e. with large @xmath28 , for @xmath77 , are characterized by largely anharmonic ground and excited state pes . as it has been discussed in ref.@xcite ,",
    "the anharmonicity of vibrations coupled to delocalized electrons is hardly detected in coherent spectral measurements ( e.g. electronic and vibrational absorption and/or raman spectra ) , where experimental data can be satisfactorily reproduced in terms of parabolic pes with effective curvatures , but it shows up with large effects in incoherent spectral measurements ( e.g. steady - state and/or time - resolved emission).@xcite large anharmonic corrections are also expected in static nonlinear optical responses,@xcite as it is confirmed by extensive _ ab initio _ results on conjugated materials.@xcite    the dotted lines in fig .  2 show the ( @xmath17-independent ) susceptibilities calculated in the best harmonic approximation ( bha)@xcite . in this approach the ground and excited state pes are approximated by the two parabolas that best fit the two anharmonic pes at the gs equilibrium position ( i.e. at the minimum of the gs pes ) : the relevant curvatures are then defined by eq .",
    "( [ deriv1 ] ) in terms of the bare electronic linear polarizability evaluated at the equilibrium geometry .",
    "moreover , all electronic properties appearing in cn - sos expressions are truncated to the linear term in @xmath18.@xcite we defer a detailed comparison of bha and exact curves to the next section , here we only underline that , as far as @xmath4 is concerned , bha and pe estimate exactly coincide , confirming that in the @xmath78 regime anharmonic corrections to the linear polarizability tend to vanish@xcite . in the same limit , nonlinear susceptibilities ( @xmath5 and @xmath6 ) are largely amplified by the anharmonicity of the gs pes , as demonstrated in panels ( a ) and ( b ) of fig .  2 , by the large deviations of bha results ( dotted lines ) from pe curves ( dashed lines ) .",
    "in sos approaches , susceptibilities are naturally partitioned into electronic and vibrational contributions . within ff approach , on the opposite , pe contributions to the susceptibilities are naturally separated from contributions due to the nuclear ke . as already discussed in the introduction , the lowest eigenstate of the electronic hamiltonian as defined in the adiabatic approximation , is the pe for the motion of nuclei ( in the gs manifold , of course ) .",
    "the total gs energy is obtained by summing the nuclear ke to the pe .",
    "then , as long as bo applies , susceptibilities , i.e. the successive derivatives of the gs energy with respect to an applied electric field , can be calculated as sums of pe and ke @xmath0-derivatives . as a matter of fact , one can further separate the pe contribution to susceptibilities into an electronic and a vibrational part by simply comparing derivatives calculated at fixed nuclear geometry with those taken by allowing nuclei to relax following the application of the electric field.@xcite this separation is however fairly artificial and does not add so much to our understanding .",
    "the nuclear ke vanishes in the @xmath79 limit , and the ( @xmath17-independent ) pe susceptibilities , reported as dashed lines in fig .  2 ,",
    "represent the zero - frequency limit of the exact susceptibilities .",
    "analytical expressions for the pe - susceptibilities of the holstein da dimer were already reported in ref . @xcite .",
    "more generally , the calculation of pe - susceptibilities is easily implemented in quantum chemistry calculations , in fact it only requires the gs energy calculated at the relaxed geometry for different values of an externally applied field .",
    "of course , geometry optimization is a crucial step in ff approach to hyperpolarizabilities and it is extremely important to fully relax the geometry for the chosen molecule in order to avoid spurious ` strain ' or ` instability ' contributions to hyperpolarizabilities.@xcite    the calculation of ke contributions is more difficult , since the @xmath0-dependence of the lowest vibrational state in the anharmonic gs pes is needed . in the adopted model , however , the calculation is feasible and , as long as bo applies , leads to basically exact results .",
    "specifically , much as it occurs for bo - sos and cn - sos , for @xmath80 exact ( continuous ) curves in fig .",
    "2 are indistinguishable from bo - ff results .",
    "the nuclear ke contributes to susceptibilities in two different ways .",
    "first of all , due to anharmonicity , the molecular geometry in the vibronic gs is different from the equilibrium geometry ( corresponding to the minimum of the gs pes ) .",
    "the pe susceptibilities have , in principle , to be corrected to account for this effect .",
    "the correction is however very small , and we found it always negligible in the investigated parameter range .",
    "the second contribution stems from the @xmath0-dependence of the nuclear ke itself : it is this contribution that indeed accounts for the deviations of the exact curves form the ( dashed ) pe curve ( at least in the bo regime , @xmath81 , where non - adiabatic corrections are negligible ) .",
    "ke contributions are of course very small for low @xmath17 , but they increase with increasing @xmath17 , leading to an overall decrease of the vibrational amplification of the static nlo responses .",
    "this is by no means accidental : in the antiadiabatic limit ( @xmath82 ) phonons can not contribute to static susceptibilities and , with increasing @xmath17 , ke contributions progressively increase to counterbalance pe contributions .",
    "ke contributions to susceptibilities exactly vanish in the harmonic approximation .",
    "in fact , the equilibrium position in any harmonic vibrational state coincides with the bottom of the pes ; moreover the nuclear ke is proportional to the harmonic frequency , i.e. to the curvature of the pes . for a parabolic pes ,",
    "this quantity is obviously independent of @xmath18 , and hence of @xmath0 ( cf eq .",
    "( [ deriv1 ] ) ) .",
    "we are then in the position to prove that the harmonic approximation is totally uncontrolled for the calculation of _ hyper_polarizabilities in any frequency regime . at low @xmath17 , where pe contributions dominate",
    ", the harmonic approximation can not account for anharmonic pes : this has no effect on the linear response , and the bha estimate of @xmath4 coincides with the exact curve in the @xmath83 limit.@xcite anharmonic contributions to pe-_hyper_polarizabilities are instead large , as demonstrated by the large deviations of bha curves from the @xmath83 limiting curves .",
    "at the same time , not accounting for ke corrections , harmonic results do not represent a reliable approximation in the large @xmath17 regime either .",
    "it is possible that in a given parameter range bha gives good estimates of a specific response , but this is due to an accidental compensation of two large errors .",
    "the harmonic approximation is unreliable in the calculation of _ hyper_polarizabilities , and , as it turns out clearly from fig .",
    "2 , it is not possible to devise any parameter range where harmonic results represent a good approximation for all static susceptibilities .",
    "the mulliken @xmath8 dimer model , extended to account for the holstein coupling to vibrations ( or equivalently to other slow degrees of freedom , including the orientational solvation coordinate ) , contains the essential physics to understand the subtle interplay between electrons , vibrations and external perturbations ( namely an electric field ) governing nlo responses of molecular materials.@xcite this simple toy - model is then very useful to test the reliability of several approximation schemes usually introduced in more refined quantum chemical description of these materials .",
    "it is important to recognize that some very well - known and very widely applied approximations can fail when applied to model the properties of materials with strongly nonlinear behavior .",
    "perturbation theory , and particularly linear perturbation theory , is clearly inadequate in this context , and we already proved its inadequacy in reproducing spectral properties of push - pull chromophores@xcite as well as their static susceptibilities.@xcite more subtle effects have been demonstrated in two - photon absorption ( tpa ) spectra , where the standard condon approximation badly fails even when it properly reproduces one - photon absorption spectra.@xcite even more interestingly , an important vibrational channel is found to contribute to tpa spectra , in addition to standard electronic channels , leading to large effects in observed spectra.@xcite the harmonic approximations works fine in tpa spectra and more generally in vertical ( coherent ) processes , but it is inadequate to describe incoherent processes.@xcite    in this paper we have addressed the approximations usually introduced in the calculation of static nlo responses .",
    "the adiabatic approximation is fairly safe , at least as long as phonon frequencies are not too high ( approximately @xmath84 , cf fig .",
    "it can be applied in different ways , bo or cn , in sos approaches leading to a slightly different partition of electronic and vibrational contributions to susceptibilities , but to the same overall result . in ff",
    "it leads to a partitioning of potential and kinetic energy contributions to susceptibilities , but otherwise leads to the same result as in sos .",
    "closure over vibrational states is also a very good approximation , as long as the adiabatic approximation applies .",
    "potential energy contributions are clearly dominant over kinetic energy contributions in the low - vibrational frequency regime .",
    "the anharmonicity of the gs pes therefore gives very large corrections to _ hyper_polarizabilities : the harmonic approximation is untenable in this regime . with increasing phonon frequency ,",
    "kinetic energy contributions globally reduce vibrational corrections until , in the antiadiabatic limit ( @xmath85 ) only electrons respond to static fields to regain purely electronic susceptibilities .",
    "kinetic energy corrections vanish in the harmonic approximation and this approximation fails in the high frequency regime too .",
    "both ff and sos approaches can be easily implemented in quantum chemistry calculations : the former has the advantage of only requiring knowledge about the lowest eigenstate , whereas all eigenstates are required in sos .",
    "however only @xmath7 eigenstates are needed in sos , whereas the @xmath0-dependence of the gs energy ( or dipole moment ) is required in ff .",
    "anharmonicity is important and must be accounted for : in the low - vibrational frequency limit , where kinetic energy contributions are negligible , ff calculation is very convenient and fully accounts for anharmonicity . in the intermediate frequency regime",
    "the pe - ff calculation overestimates the vibrational amplification of nlo responses : either ke corrections have to be introduced in the ff scheme , or one has to make resort to sos calculations , but in any case anharmonicity has to be accounted in order to get reliable estimates of _ hyper_polarizabilities .      work supported by the italian national research council ( cnr ) within its `` progetto finalizzato materiali speciali per tecnologie avanzate ii '' and by the ministry of university of scientific and technological research ( murst ) .",
