    "the maximum luminosity of sn 2007ru is comparable to sn 1998bw .",
    "the light curve reaches a peak in only @xmath82 days , which is remarkably faster than in sn 1998bw ( @xmath0 20 days ) .",
    "the mass of @xmath5ni  ejected in sn 2007ru is estimated as @xmath83 , which is similar to that estimated for sne 1998bw and 2003jd , slightly larger than that for sn 2004aw , and much larger than that for the broad - line sne 2002ap and 2006aj and the normal sn ic 1994i ( table [ tab : parameters ] ) .    from the rise time of the light curve ( @xmath84 ) and the expansion velocity ( @xmath85 ) , we estimate mass of sn ejecta ( @xmath86 ) and the kinetic energy of the ejecta ( @xmath87 ) .",
    "if the optical opacity is assumed to be constant , the timescale of the light curve is expressed as @xmath88 ( arnett 1982 ) .",
    "the expansion velocity is given by @xmath89 .",
    "the rise time of sn 2007ru ( @xmath90 days ) is comparable to that of the well studied sn 1994i , while the expansion velocity ( @xmath91 @xmath19 at maximum ) is about twice .",
    "assuming @xmath92 and @xmath93 ergs for sn 1994i ( see table [ tab : parameters ] ) , and the observed expansion velocity of sn 2007ru , we estimate @xmath94 and @xmath95 ergs for sn 2007ru . a similar analysis for sn 1998bw , assuming the rise time and the velocity of sn 1998bw to be twice that of sn 1994i , leads to @xmath96 and @xmath97ergs , qualitatively consistent with the results of detailed modelling ( iwamoto et al . 1998 ; nakamura et al .",
    "ratio ( @xmath98 ) , the higher end of the ejecta mass may be preferred ( @xmath99 , and @xmath100 erg ) .",
    "since the explosion with a larger kinetic energy can produce a larger amount of @xmath5ni , the large @xmath5ni  mass in sn 2007ru may also support this . ]",
    "if we take sn 2003jd as a reference ( valenti et al . 2008 ) , @xmath101 and @xmath102 ergs are derived for sn 2007ru .",
    "it should however be noted , that a detailed modelling is required to derive accurate values of @xmath103 and @xmath87 . and kinetic energy @xmath87 using the width of the light curve .",
    "the width is defined as the time from peak of the bolometric light curve to the time when the luminosity is equal to the 1/_e _ times the peak luminosity , which is equivalent to a decline of 1.1 mag from peak .",
    "the derived width is @xmath0  18 days for sn 2007ru . with this value",
    ", we have estimated @xmath103 and @xmath87 in the same manner and derived larger values of @xmath103 and @xmath87 ( @xmath104 and @xmath105 erg ) .",
    "our conclusion of large e / m is thus not affected . ]",
    "sn 2007ru has a large kinetic energy while the ejecta mass is close to that of normal sne ic .",
    "studies of sne ic ( e.g. , nomoto et al . 2007 ) have shown a trend , although weak , wherein sne having massive ejecta tend to have a larger kinetic energy and eject more @xmath5ni , connecting normal sne to grb - associated sne .",
    "in contrast to this trend , sn 2007ru which resides at the higher energy end has a lower mass ejecta , leading to a higher @xmath106 .",
    "sn 2007ru thus adds to the diversity of sne ic .",
    "the spectroscopic properties of sn 2007ru at early phases are most similar to sn 2003jd .",
    "also if we take the higher end of @xmath103 , the ejecta properties of sn 2007ru are also close to those of sn 2003jd ( although the estimated @xmath106 is higher for sn 2007ru ) .",
    "however , the [ oi ] line profiles in the nebular spectra are dissimilar .",
    "sn 2007ru shows a single peaked profile while sn 2003jd shows a double - peaked profile . in aspherical explosions , we would expect a single - peaked [ oi ] profile for the polar - viewed case , and a double - peaked profile for the side - viewed case ( mazzali et al .",
    "2005 ; maeda et al . 2008 ; modjaz et al .",
    "also , the polar - viewed aspherical explosion tends to show a brighter peak ( maeda et al .",
    "2006 ) and faster velocity ( tanaka et al .",
    "this matches with the properties of sn 2007ru .",
    "thus , we suggest that sn 2007ru could be an aspherical explosion viewed from the polar direction . detailed multidimensional modelling is required to answer if the high @xmath106 derived for sn 2007ru results from the effect of asphericity .",
    "the nebular spectrum of sn 2007ru shows narrow emission lines due to h@xmath53 , [ nii ] , [ sii ] and [ siii ] , arising from the underlying / neighbouring host galaxy hii region .",
    "the flux ratios indicate an oxygen abundance of @xmath0 8.8 in the region of the supernova .",
    "the nearly solar oxygen abundance at the location of the supernova matches well with earlier abundance studies for supernova host galaxies .",
    "the nuclear spectrum of the host galaxy of sn 2007ru shows broad hydrogen balmer lines , with an asymmetric blue wing .",
    "emission lines due to feii are also fairly prominent .",
    "low ionization emission lines are also present . it appears that the galaxy hosts a mild agn with nuclear hii region .",
