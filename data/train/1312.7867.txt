    "the proposed model that we are developing takes into consideration individual contributions and interactions along with higher order contributions if applicable . in developing the statistical model ,",
    "the response variable is the co@xmath0 in the atmosphere and is given in parts per million by volume ( ppmv ) . in the present analysis , we used real yearly data that has been collected from 1959 to 2008 at mauna loa observatory , hawaii .",
    "the co@xmath0 emission data for the eu countries ( list given below ) was obtained from carbon dioxide information analysis center ( cdiac ) during the same period .",
    "the analysis presented here consists of two steps : first , we partially replicate the comprehensive study performed in @xcite in order to select the relevant variables and their interactions , and then we validate and analyze the best second - order model . based on this result",
    ", we will perform the surface - response analysis ( curvature effects ) of the model in a forthcoming publication @xcite .",

    "emissions , in thousands of metric tons @xcite.,width=472 ]    the aim of this study is two - fold : in the current paper we focus on the determination of the optimal second - order model ( including interactions as well as quadratic terms ) which provides the best fit for the data and features robust validation ; in a forthcoming publication , we will use the model derived here in order to determine multi - variables confidence regions and obtain estimates for the allowed fluctuations in attributable variables , given a maximal range of change in the response variable .",
    "the second - order model we will obtain in the current study provides us with a list of relevant variables , ranked according to their statistical significance ( quantified by the respective contribution to the total variability ) , which we employ in order to compare with the similar result obtained in the case of the u.s .",

    "one of the underlying assumptions to construct the model is that the response variable should follow gaussian distribution .",
    "it is known @xcite that the co@xmath0 in the atmosphere does not follow the gaussian distribution .",
    "therefore , the box - cox transformation is applied to the co@xmath0 atmosphere data to filter the data to be normally distributed .",
    "after the box - cox filter , we retest the data and it shows our data will follow normal distribution ; thus , we proceed to estimate the coefficients of the contributable variables for the transformed co@xmath0 atmosphere data .",
    "the parameter of the transformation is the same as the one used in the two previous studies @xcite",
    ".    we can proceed to estimate the approximate coefficients of the contributable variables for transformed co@xmath0 in the atmosphere and obtain the coefficients of all possible interactions , using the multivariate regression procedure and corresponding goodness - of - fit measures .",
    "we begin with seven attributable variables and apply the sas stepwise forward selection procedure to a model with six relevant variables and 21 second - order interactions between each pair and self - interactions . introducing the notation",
    "@xmath1 liquid fuels ( li ) , @xmath2 gas fuels ( ga ) , @xmath3 gas flares ( fl ) , @xmath4 bunker ( bu ) for the relevant attributable variables , we find that only three of the variables ( liquid fuels ( @xmath5 ) , gas fuels ( @xmath6 ) , and gas flares ( @xmath5 ) ) and only 3 interactions ( ga : bu , li : fl , li : bu ) and two quadratic terms ( li@xmath7 , bu@xmath7 ) are statistically relevant at @xmath8 level .    the result of estimation becomes the quadratic model with interactions : @xmath9^{-2.376 } &   = & 0.00000123 + ( 710.85 fl -30.64ga -3.4501 li )   \\times 10^{-13 } + \\\\ & + & ( 37.34ga\\cdot bu + 1.35 li \\cdot li -65.12 bu \\cdot bu - \\\\ & - &   133.05 li \\cdot fl -5.35 li \\cdot bu)\\times 10^{-18}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the quality of the fit for this quadratic model is evidenced by high value of both @xmath10 and @xmath11 which are the key criteria to evaluate the model fitting . in terms of the total ( @xmath12 ) , regression ( @xmath13 and error ( @xmath14 ) sums of squares , we have the standard formulas @xmath15 with @xmath16 the degrees of freedom for the chi - squared distributions for error and total , respectively @xcite",
    ". we also employ the prediction of residual error sum of squares ( @xmath17 ) statistics which will evaluate how good the estimation will be if each time we remove one data point .",
    "if the index @xmath18 covers all the observations and @xmath19 is the predicted value when the observation is omitted , then @xcite @xmath20        one relevant variable for the us market ( cement , together with its interactions to liquid and bunker ) is completely absent in the case of the eu data .",
    "together with the fact that , at the same level of statistical significance , the us model requires five variables while the eu data leads to a model with four , this shows that the two models are fundamentally different , in the sense that production , dynamics , and global interactions of the man - made factors responsible for atmospheric co@xmath0 , are essentially different in the case of eu and ue .",
    "this indicates that , when developing specific guidelines for industry regulations and accountability criteria , translating regulations and policies between the eu and us markets must be done with considerable caution .",
    "the differences found here mandate , in fact , that a specific approach must be developed in the eu case , and that adopting us - based policy directly may be unwarranted and outright misguided .",
    "we will quantify this aspect of the comparison in a forthcoming publication @xcite , aimed at comparing the possible carbon - production management in the case of the us versus the eu markets ."
