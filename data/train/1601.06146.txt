    "the  a  posteriori bounds , e.g. ,  presented in @xcite , are based on easily computable singular values of residual matrices .",
    "our bounds in this work use both pabs and the singular values of the residual matrices , thus called _ mixed bounds _ , following @xcite .",
    "different vectors / subspaces may have the same rq / ritz values , but if the values are different , the vectors / subspaces can not be the same , evidently .",
    "a priori and mixed bounds can be used to differentiate vectors / subspaces , providing guaranteed lower bounds for the angles . in @xcite , this idea is illustrated for graph matching , by comparing spectra of graph laplacians of the graphs to be matched .",
    "our bounds can be similarly applied for signal distinction in signal processing , where the ritz values serve as a harmonic signature of the subspace ; cf . _",
