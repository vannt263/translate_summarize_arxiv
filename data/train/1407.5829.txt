    "m dwarf stars are the largest stellar group in the solar neighborhood . also , because of their small masses , the lifetimes of m dwarfs are longer than the age of the universe , and m dwarfs",
    "are composed of the samples of all the populations including very old ones .",
    "unfortunately our understanding on this large and rich stellar group is rather poor compared to other stellar groups .",
    "this should largely be due to difficulty of observing m dwarfs because of their faintness , and the difficulty is most severe for the m dwarfs of the old population in the distant halo .",
    "recent progress , however , overcame the observational barriers to some extent , especially in the field of stellar interferometry , infrared spectroscopy using new infrared detectors , astrometry and photometry from space , etc .",
    "in addition to the faintness of m dwarfs , spectroscopic analysis of m dwarfs has also been hampered by the heavy blending of many atomic and molecular lines , especially in the optical region .",
    "this difficulty can be reduced somewhat in the infrared region , as has been shown by @xcite who has carried out abundance analysis based on the near infrared spectra of six m dwarfs observed with the fourier transform spectrometer ( fts ) at kpno .",
    "after this promising attempt in the 1970 s , however , infrared spectroscopy of m dwarfs at high resolution could not be pursued further , because infrared detectors were not yet sensitive enough for faint m dwarfs .",
    "recent progress of the infrared two - dimensional detectors finally made it possible to pursue spectroscopic analysis of m dwarfs further , as has already been demonstrated by @xcite who have analyzed the infrared high resolution spectra in the @xmath5 band region of about a dozen of m dwarfs .",
    "although spectroscopic analysis of the m dwarf star has been deemed difficult in general , we have some reasons why we study such a difficult case . for example ,",
    "carbon and oxygen abundances in late - type stars are generally difficult to determine and their abundances are still controversial even for the sun .",
    "this is because the abundance indicators of carbon such as the high excitation lines of neutral carbon and molecular lines such as of c@xmath4 and ch ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) , for example , are mostly pretty model sensitive .",
    "in contrast , such a difficulty can be reduced in m dwarfs for which numerous lines of stable molecules such as co and h@xmath4o can be used as abundance indicators of carbon and oxygen , respectively .",
    "such an advantage in the spectroscopic analysis of m dwarfs has not necessarily been well recognized so far and we hope to explore such a possibility in some detail in this paper .    also , recent interests in m dwarfs come from possibilities to detect earth - type planets around m dwarfs and to know the nature of such m dwarfs that host planets . until the present , it has been suggested that metallicity of the planet hosting m dwarfs may be high ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "also habitability of the planets may depend largely on their chemical environment and accurate abundance determination of the parent m dwarfs should be an important issue in investigating habitable planets themselves .",
    "however , direct abundance determinations in m dwarfs based on detailed spectroscopic analysis are still limited , and most estimations of metallicity were based on indirect methods based on low resolution spectroscopic or photometric indexes ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .    for extending detailed spectroscopic analysis to m dwarfs , however , another difficulty is the heavy veiling of the spectra by molecular bands , which obscures the true continuum needed to measure accurate line strengths ( or equivalent widths ) .",
    "if we apply the spectral synthesis ( ss ) method , which has been more popular in recent years , the situation is the same , since the synthetic spectrum has usually been evaluated by referring to the true - continuum . given that the problem of the continuum is a common feature that can not be avoided in cool stars , we think that it is useful to examine the nature of the veil opacities in some details and reconsider such an analysis carried out by referring to the true - continuum .",
    "in fact , it is now possible to evaluate the pseudo - continuum level fairly accurately by virtue of the recent progress in molecular line database such as hitemp2010 ( @xcite ) and many references cited therein ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "then , we may abandon to refer to the true - continuum and reformulate the spectroscopic analysis in such a way as to proceed by referring to the pseudo - continuum defined by the molecular veil opacities .",
    "the basic principle of the spectroscopic analysis should be the same whether the true- or pseudo - continuum is referred to .",
    "now , the observational barriers are being overcome to some extent and the method of analysis can hopefully be improved somewhat as outlined above , we hope to pursue the possibility of determining accurate abundances directly from the observed spectra of m dwarfs .    in this paper , we first introduce our observed data ( section2 ) and then examine the necessary data and tools for spectroscopic analysis such as fundamental stellar parameters , model photospheres , and molecular data ( section3 ) .",
    "we then carry out a preliminary analysis based on the conventional method disregarding the background opacity due to numerous h@xmath4o lines ( section4 ) , and consider the effect of h@xmath4o contamination consistently in the analysis referring to the pseudo - continuum ( section5 ) .",
    "finally , we discuss some topics including method of analysis , carbon abundances in m dwarfs , accuracy of abundance analysis , and hr diagram at the end of the main sequence ( section6 ) .",
    "we observed 42 m dwarfs listed in the table 1 , which were selected based on at least one of the following three criteria .",
    "the distance of the target ( @xmath6 30 pc ) is known by parallax measurements mostly by hipparcos @xcite .",
    "all the target stars satisfy this criterion .",
    "the radius of the target star was obtained by interferometry ( @xcite , references therein ) .",
    "16 stars whose names are marked by @xmath7 in table1 belong to this case .",
    "the target star hosts a planet ( or planets ) ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "ten stars whose names are marked by @xmath8 in table1 belong to this case .",
    "observations were carried out at the subaru telescope on 2013 may 9 and november 16 ut using the echelle mode of the infrared camera and spectrograph ( ircs ; @xcite ) with natural guide star adaptive optics .",
    "the slit width of 0.14@xmath9 was sampled at 55 mas pixel@xmath10 , and the resolution was about 20000 at @xmath11 .",
    "the echelle setting was `` @xmath12 '' , which covered about a half of the @xmath11 window with the orders , wavelength segments and pixel - wise dispersions given in table 2 .",
    "the targets were nodded along the slit , and observations were taken in abba sequence , where a and b stand for the first and second positions on the slit .",
    "total exposure time ranged from 24 seconds ( gj 820 a ) to 54 minutes ( gj 3348 b ) .",
    "the night in may was photometric , while that in november was spectroscopic .",
    "signal - to - noise ratios of reduced spectra at around 23000 given in the fifth column of table1 , were typically higher for the run in may . at the beginning of the night in",
    "the may run and at the ending of the night in the november run , a rapidly rotating b8 star regulus ( @xmath13 leo ) was observed as the calibrator of telluric transmission .    during the target acquisition by @xmath11 band imaging , gj 797 b",
    "was spatially resolved into an equal binary with a separation of 0.3@xmath9 with ne and sw components . by placing",
    "the slit perpendicularly to the separation , each component was observed .",
    "data reduction was carried out using the standard iraf routines in the ` imred ` and ` echelle ` packages .",
    "after extraction of one dimensional spectra , wavelength calibrations were calculated using telluric absorption lines in the spectra of regulus . after wavelength calibrations of one dimensional spectra of a and b positions , they were coadded to produce combined spectra .",
    "the combined spectra were normalized by the pseudo - continuum levels and then calibrated for telluric absorption using the spectra of regulus .    ",
    "table1 : target stars ( p.24 ) .",
    "table2 : echelle setting ( p.25 ) .    ",
    "the basic parameters that characterize stellar spectra are effective temperature , surface gravity , chemical composition , and micro - turbulent velocity .",
    "however , it is difficult to determine all these parameters from the observed spectra , and it is helpful to obtain some of these parameters from other sources .",
    "we survey such a possibility especially in the recent stellar interferometry and in the databases based on space observations ( subsection 3.1 ) . with the basic parameters at hand , we generate model photospheres needed to compute theoretical spectra by which to analyze the observed spectra , and we briefly discuss our models ( subsection 3.2 ) . in the computation of the theoretical spectra ,",
    "accurate molecular data are indispensable and we discuss the molecular data we are to use ( subsection 3.3 ) .      thanks to the recent interferometric measurements of the angular diameters of m dwarfs , effective temperatures of dozens of m dwarfs are now known with sufficient accuracy ( e.g. , @xcite ) and about a third of our sample belong to this case .",
    "the problem is how to estimate effective temperatures of m dwarfs for which angular diameters are not known .. one possibility may be to apply photometric data , and the best way for this purpose may be to apply the infrared flux method @xcite .",
    "we applied this method by the use of the @xmath14 band flux but only to a limited number of m dwarfs @xcite .",
    "for extending this method to our m dwarfs , we looked for the @xmath14 band data in the literature , but we could not find them in the ground - based photometry for most of our sample .",
    "but we noticed that the @xmath15 band flux centered at 3.4@xmath2 m @xcite can be used for this purpose .",
    "meanwhile , however , we find it possible to use the @xmath16 data not in the infrared flux method but in another way : namely , for m dwarfs for which interferometric @xmath0 values are available , we convert the @xmath17 flux to the absolute magnitude at 3.4@xmath2 m , @xmath1 , by the use of the hipparcos parallax @xcite",
    ". then we use the resulting @xmath18 relation to infer @xmath0 from @xmath19 which is available for all the m dwarfs we are to analyze .",
    "there are 33 k and m dwarfs for which interferometrically determined @xmath0 are known with precision to better than 5% in table 6 of @xcite .",
    "however , the @xmath16 fluxes were not resolved for the binary components gj338a , gj338b , gj702a , gj702b , gj820a , and gj820b , and we use the remaining 27 stars . to include later m dwarfs , we also consider nine m dwarfs whose @xmath0 values are determined by the infrared flux method @xcite .",
    "these 27 and 9 data are summarized in tables3 and 4 , respectively .",
    "for these 36 objects with known @xmath0 , @xmath1 values are plotted against log@xmath0 values in figure 1 . except for a few cases ,",
    "@xmath1 and log@xmath0 follow reasonably tight correlation and we draw a mean curve shown by the dashed line in figure 1 .",
    "the resulting @xmath1 - log@xmath0 relation is used to estimate @xmath0 of m dwarfs for which @xmath0 values are not known .",
    "the resulting @xmath0 values together with @xmath1 values are given in table5 for 25 m dwarfs .",
    "for two objects , gj273 and gj725b , which deviate from the mean relation in figure1 , we also estimate their @xmath0 values by using the @xmath1 - log@xmath0 relation and the results are included in table5 .",
    "the resulting @xmath0 = 3415k by the @xmath1-method is higher compared with @xmath0 = 3150k ( table 4 ) by the infrared flux method for gj273 , while @xmath0 = 3337k by the @xmath1-method is higher compared with the @xmath0 = 3104k ( table 3 ) by the interferometry for gj725b .",
    "we should in principle respect the results by the direct observations , but the consistency among all the data should be considered at the same time .",
    "we analyze the spectra of these two m dwarfs by the two different @xmath0 values - the high and low , and examine the overall consistency at the end ( subsection6.2 ) .",
    "we attach h and l to the star names to discriminate the cases of high and low @xmath0 , e.g. , gj273-h and gj273-l .",
    "in applying the @xmath1-method , the accuracy of the input data , especially of the @xmath16 photometry is most crucial .",
    "generally , the major problem in the photometry of relatively bright objects is the possible saturation of the detectors . in this regard ,",
    "the @xmath16 data quality has been examined in detail by @xcite who showed that the @xmath17 band flux centered at 3.4@xmath2 m is of high quality and quite reliable .",
    "this is in marked contrast to the @xmath20 band flux centered at 4.6@xmath2 m , which was showed to be not free from saturation effect and will result in significant errors for bright stars . by the way , @xcite showed that there is no mid - infrared excess in about a hundred m dwarfs by the analysis of the @xmath16 data and concluded that there is no clear evidence for a debris disk around m dwarfs .",
    "this result implies that the visibilities measured by the interferometers are not likely to be disturbed by emission and/or scattering by the circumstellar dust .",
    "however , detailed analysis should be needed on deviating stars in figure1 to see if such a conclusion can be applied to them .",
    "we also plot @xmath0 values by different methods against the spectral types in figure2 . for this purpose , we find that 29 m dwarfs in our sample are included in 426 m dwarfs classified on a uniform system by @xcite who used the strengths of tio bands in the blue . as for remaining 13 m dwarfs , we apply the spectral types found in simbad .",
    "although these types due to different authors are naturally not on a uniform system , we confirm in our sample of 29 m dwarfs noted above that the simbad types agree with those by @xcite within 1 subtype for the 28 out of 29 m dwarfs and within 1.5 subtype for a remaining object gj205 .",
    "inspection of figure2 reveals that the spectral type - @xmath0 relation is not defined very well , but most stars follow a mean relation ( dashed line ) with dispersion of @xmath21 1 subtype ( dotted lines ) .",
    "gj611b is metal poor and may be classified to be too early for its @xmath0 .",
    "but we have no explanation for gj273-l , gj686 , and gj725b - l . ] .",
    "it is to be noted that there is little systematic effect among the @xmath0 values determined by the interferometry ( filled circles ) , the infrared flux method ( open circles ) , and the @xmath1-method ( filled triangles ) .",
    "the radii based on the angular diameters and masses mostly based on the mass - luminosity relations are also reproduced in 8- and 9-th columns , respectively , in table3 from @xcite .",
    "the log@xmath22 values based on these radii and masses are given in the 10-th column of table3 , but only for those objects which are analyzed in the present paper . for the objects for which @xmath0 values are determined by the infrared flux method and by the @xmath1 - method , radii and masses are estimated by applying the empirical equations ( 8) and ( 10 ) , respectively , given by @xcite .",
    "the resulting values of @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and log@xmath22 are given in the last three columns in tables4 and 5 ( but in table4 , only for objects which are analyzed in the present paper ) .",
    "now , @xmath0 and log@xmath22 values are ready for the 42 objects we are to analyze in this paper , and these data are plotted in figure3 together with the result from the evolutionary models by @xcite . note that gj273 and gj725b appear twice for the different sources of @xmath0 values noted above .",
    "also , gj273-l and , especially gj725b - l , show large deviations from other objects in figure 3 .    -",

    "our present m dwarf sample is not so cool as to form dust clouds in their photospheres and we apply our dust free models for two abundance cases : _ case a _ ( ca - series ) with the high c & o abundances ( log@xmath26 & log@xmath27 and @xmath28 are the number densities of carbon and oxygen , respectively , relative to hydrogen .",

    "however , inspection of tables 3 @xmath33 5 reveals that log@xmath22 s of most m dwarfs are somewhere between log@xmath22 = 4.5 and 5.0 .",
    "for this reason , we generate an additional series of models with log@xmath22 = 4.75 ( @xmath34 k ) in our ucm grid , and this series of models are used in the first iteration of our preliminary analysis ( section4 ) .    however , we find that the abundance analysis is sensitive to the fundamental parameters , especially to log@xmath22 ( subsection4.3 ) .",
    "then we finally decide not to use the models from our grid but to generate a specified model for @xmath32 and log@xmath22 of each m dwarf , and use it in and after the second iterations . if the carbon abundance by our first iteration of the preliminary analysis appears to be closer to the classical solar abundance ( or to the recent solar abundance ) , we apply the _ case a _ ( or _ case c _ )",
    "abundance as the input c & o abundances for our models./ log@xmath22 .",
    "for example , a model of no dust cloud ( or clear model ) with _ case a _ abundance , @xmath0 = 3360k , and log@xmath22 = 4.85 is referred to as ca3360c485 . as for details about our models of m ,",

    "the spectroscopic data of co are relatively well known .",
    "our co data are based on the line position data @xcite and intensity data ( @xcite ) . under the high density of the photospheres of m dwarfs ,",
    "another important issue is the collision broadening , which depends on the physical properties of the interacting atoms or molecules .",
    "the collision half - width @xmath35 is relatively well studied for the collision partners in the air ( n@xmath4 , o@xmath4 ... ) at room temperature , but unfortunately not for collision partners in stellar photospheres ( h , he , h@xmath4 ... ) at elevated temperatures .",
    "usually , collision half - width @xmath36 is represented by @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the collision half - width measured at a reference temperature @xmath39 ( e.g. 296k ) and gas pressure @xmath40 .",
    "the co air - broadened values of @xmath38 can be found in the co database included in hitemp2010 ( @xcite ) , but those by molecular hydrogen appropriate for temperatures as high as 3000k are available only for co pure rotation transitions ( @xcite ) so far as we are aware . as an example of the effect of the collision partner , we compare the h@xmath4 broadening half - widths ( converting from mhz / torr to cm@xmath10/atm unit from @xcite ) and air - broadening ones ( @xcite ) for the case of co pure rotation transitions in table6 .",
    "inspection of table6 reveals that the effect of collision partners is rather small in the low @xmath5 transitions but quite appreciable in the high @xmath5 transitions .",
    "the values of @xmath38 for the air - broadening of co 2 - 0 vibration - rotation transitions which we analyze in this paper are rather similar ( @xcite ) to the case of the pure rotation transitions shown in table6 .",
    "although it is possible that the h@xmath4-broadening is about 50 % larger than the air - broadening , we apply the medium value of @xmath42cm@xmath10/atm for the air - broadening data @xcite to all the co 2 - 0 lines we study in this paper ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "we hope that measurements of the h@xmath4-broadening at high temperatures can be extended to the vibration - rotation transitions of co in the near future .    for the reason to be noted in subsection4.1",
    ", we decide to concentrate to the co lines near the ( 2,0 ) bandhead region and select co blends listed in table7 in which the spectroscopic data of co lines are given .",
    "we hoped that this spectral region may be relatively free from other molecular bands .",
    "in fact , our line - list includes some lines of cn red system , ro - vibrational lines of oh , hf , h@xmath4 etc . , but none of these molecular lines is prominent in the region we are to study .",
    "however , we notice that the wings of h@xmath4o @xmath44 and @xmath45 bands centered at 2.7@xmath2 m and @xmath46 band centered at 1.87@xmath2 m extend to the region of the co 2 - 0 band and numerous weak h@xmath4o lines produce appreciable effect on the continuum level . also some co lines are blended with the h@xmath4o lines in such a way that their equivalent widths are modified by the blends .",
    "we first examine the effect of h@xmath4o lines with the use of the line - list by @xcite on a model of cc3500c50 and @xmath47 = 1kmsec@xmath10 .",
    "the result is shown in figure4a in which the predicted spectrum with the resolution of about @xmath48 is shown by the thin line and that convolved with the slit - function ( gaussian ) with fwhm = 16 km sec@xmath10 ( the resolution of our observed spectra ) by thick line .",
    "next , we do the same but with the use of a new water line - list in hitemp2010 ( @xcite ) which has extensively used the bt2 database by @xcite ( figure4b ) . although the general patterns of the h@xmath4o spectra in figures4a and 4b are not very different , the depressions of the continua are much larger in figure4b ( more than 3% ) than in figure4a ( less than 1% ) . for comparison ,",
    "the predicted spectrum of co alone shows the continuum clearly ( figure4c ) .",
    "although the collision half - widths of h@xmath4o lines span the larger range compared with those of co , we apply the same mean value as for co for h@xmath4o lines in which the damping wings are not yet developed .",

    "the number of lines in the original bt2-hitemp2010 database is still several times larger .",
    "this large increase is due to inclusion of many weak lines in bt2-hitemp2010 , and it is such numerous weak lines that play important role in depressing the continuum level noted in figure4b .",
    "also , with such a high line density of about 350 lines per 1 interval for the cut - off noted above , the h@xmath4o opacity should be smeared out and the pseudo - continuum can be well defined at nearly constant level as shown in figure4b . for this reason , spectral analysis can be carried out by referring to the pseudo - continuum instead of the true - continuum , as will be discussed in section5 .    -",

    "we first examine the co spectra ( subsection 4.1 ) and apply a usual method of abundance analysis to the co lines without considering the possible effect of the blending of the h@xmath4o lines ( subsection4.2 ) .",
    "the external errors due to the uncertainties in the fundamental parameters including the overall metallicity are discussed ( subsection4.3 ) .      in this paper , we focus our attention to the lines of the co first - overtone band . although co lines are clearly observed in the spectral region observed , most lines are blends of two or more co lines in our medium resolution spectra of @xmath51 ( figure4c ) . also , we notice that h@xmath4o lines are already disturbing the region of the co first overtone band .",
    "as can be inferred from figure4b , numerous weak h@xmath4o lines depress the continuum level on one hand and some relatively strong h@xmath4o lines disturb the individual co lines as blends on the other .",
    "all these facts make it difficult to measure equivalent widths accurately and , in particular , it is very difficult to measure weak lines .",
    "we first hoped to measure as many co lines as possible recorded in our echelle spectra since it is essential to include weak unsaturated lines and saturated stronger lines together to determine micro - turbulent velocity , which is the important parameter next to the effective temperature and gravity in the interpretation of stellar spectra .",
    "however , the situation noted above , namely blending of co lines themselves , blending of h@xmath4o lines disturbing both continuum level and co line strength , and difficulty to measure weak co lines , makes it difficult to determine micro - turbulent velocity spectroscopically . on the other hand ,",
    "the micro - turbulent velocity in the photosphere of m dwarfs may be less than 1 km sec@xmath10 ( e.g. , @xcite ) while the thermal velocity of co is 1.33 km sec@xmath10 for @xmath52k .",
    "then the role of the micro - turbulence in the line - broadening in the photospheres of m dwarfs may not be so important as in m giant stars in which the micro - turbulent velocity is larger than 1 km sec@xmath10 .",
    "for this reason , we give up to determine the micro - turbulent velocity spectroscopically in our m dwarfs and assume it to be 1 km sec@xmath10 throughout this paper .",
    "once we give up to determine the micro - turbulent velocity , it is almost useless to measure many co lines which are more or less disturbed by various noises , and we focus our attention to the co ( 2 - 0 ) bandhead region shown in figure4c . in this region , the effects of h@xmath4o @xmath44 and @xmath45 bands are relatively small compared to the longer wavelength region and there is no overlapping of various co bands .",
    "we then concentrate to determine carbon abundance from the restricted co features listed in table7 .",
    "all the co lines we are to analyze are blends of two co lines on our medium resolution spectra ( figure4c ) .",
    "in such a case , the usual curve - of - growth method can not be applied . instead",
    ", spectral synthesis ( ss ) method may be considered , since it is possible to treat the blended features easily by this method .",
    "however , ss method has been applied so far only when the true - continuum could have been defined and , for this reason , it may be difficult to apply to m dwarfs for which the true - continuum can not be defined in general .",
    "although we hope to relax this difficulty as will be detailed in section5 , we here extend the line - by - line ( ll ) method extensively applied to the unblended lines in red giant stars ( e.g. , @xcite ) to the case of blended lines in m dwarfs and now the method should better be referred to as the blend - by - blend ( bb ) method .",
    "we measure the equivalent widths ( ews ) of the blends composed of two co lines listed in table7 , and the results are given in table14 . now",
    "the problem is to determine the carbon abundance from these ews .",
    "since almost all the carbon atoms are in co molecules in the photosphere of m dwarfs , the carbon abundance is almost the same as the co abundance .",
    "however , it is not possible to obtain co and hence carbon abundances directly from the measured ews .",
    "but the reverse is possible ; i.e. , determine directly the ew of a co blend for a given carbon abundance .",
    "then , we start from the carbon abundance log@xmath53 of the model photosphere used ( i.e. , log@xmath54 for our models of cc - series ) and compute the ew of a co blend .",
    "if the resulting ew is smaller than the observed ew , the assumed carbon abundance should be too small .",
    "we then compute ews , @xmath55 , for the logarithmic abundance corrections of @xmath56 = + 0.3 and + 0.6 , and we have so to speak a mini curve - of - growth for the co blends defined by log@xmath57 vs. @xmath58 ( @xmath58 = 0.0 , 0.3 , and 0.6 ) . with this mini curve - of - growth",
    ", the abundance correction to the initial value of log@xmath54 can be obtained from the observed ew of the co blend .",
    "this process is repeated to all the co blends listed in table7 except for the lines of ref .",

    "we proceed as in our preliminary analysis ( subsection4.2 ) but the predicted equivalent widths ( ews ) are calculated by including the effect of h@xmath4o contamination and by referring to the pseudo - continuum instead of the true - continuum .",

    "instead we can proceed more easily by measuring the ews on the synthetic spectrum in the same way as we measure the ews on the observed spectrum . in this way",
    ", the effect of the h@xmath4o contamination can be taken into account automatically and the pseudo - continua can also be defined consistently for the predicted and observed spectra .",
    "actually , we calculate the synthetic spectra for log@xmath91 in 9-th column of table8 and log@xmath92 ( some examples for the case of @xmath93 is shown in figures8a and 8b ) , and we measure the predicted ews , @xmath55 , for the co blends listed in table7 .",
    "we now include the lines of ref .",
    "13 and 14 , since the effect of the h@xmath4o blending can be corrected for , but we exclude the line of ref . no.1 which appears to be too close to the bandhead .",
    "then we have mini curves - of - growth defined by @xmath57 vs. @xmath58 ( e.g. @xmath58 = -0.3 , 0.0 , and + 0.3 ) , by which the logarithmic abundance corrections to log@xmath91 required to explain the observed ews can be obtained .",

    "inspection of figures5 @xmath33 7 reveals that the abundance corrections by the bb analysis always increase with the observed ews . normally , the variations of the abundance corrections plotted against the ews used provide important information on the physical parameters relating to the line formation such as the micro - turbulent velocity ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in the present case ,",

    "especially , the micro - turbulent velocity could not be determined well since its effect could not be separated from those of macro - turbulence and rotation on the synthetic spectrum .",
    "for example , the ss method was applied to several m dwarfs and micro- and macro - turbulent velocities were determined by @xcite , but it is not very clear how these two velocities could have been separated .",
    "also , many groups used the ss method in a comparative study of the spectra of cool giant stars but the turbulent velocities were not determined well in many cases by the ss method @xcite .",
    "the important discovery of the micro - turbulent velocity was done from the analysis of the equivalent widths by the curve - of - growth method @xcite , and it is the ews that are directly influenced by the micro - turbulent velocity . on the other hand , other line broadenings such as due to the macro - turbulence and rotation",
    "give no effect on ews and they are recognized only on the synthetic spectrum . for this reason , the micro - turbulent velocity can be determined accurately and easily from the analysis of ews , as has been shown for the case of cool giant stars ( e.g. , @xcite ; ) .",
    "once the micro - turbulent velocity is determined , then the ss method can be used to infer the effect of the additional broadenings such as the macro - turbulence and rotation .",
    "certainly , ss method is not useful as a means by which to determine all the parameters but it can be useful to check the overall consistency at the end .    at the beginning of this study , we hoped to determine the micro - turbulent velocity first from the analysis of ews by the ll method , but this attempt could not be realized with the medium resolution spectra at hand ( subsection4.1 ) .",
    "even with the higher resolution , the effect of the blending makes the ll method difficult . for this purpose",
    ", we propose to analyze the ews measured on the synthetic spectra in subsection5.2 and this method , referred to as bs method , works well in determining the abundance . by this method ,",
    "analysis of ews is not necessarily limited to single lines but can be extended to blended lines found in the region of depressed continua .",
    "we hope to apply this method to determining the micro - turbulent velocity with the higher resolution spectra .",
    "this is certainly a more challenging problem , but this should be almost unique way to determine the micro - turbulent velocity in the m dwarf photospheres .      determination of carbon abundances in late - type stars has been difficult in general and we do not yet have a result generally accepted even for the sun .",
    "this is because the spectral lines used as indicators of carbon abundance are highly sensitive not only to the thermal structure of the photosphere but also to the inhomogeneity and non - lte effects etc . in contrast , such difficulties can be avoided in m dwarfs for which co molecule can be used as the abundance indicator . in the cool and dense photospheres of m dwarfs , almost all",
    "the carbon is in co and hence its abundance shows little change for the changes of the physical condition .",
    "this advantage can not be applied to hotter stars such as the sun , in which co formation is not yet complete but changes its abundance drastically for a minor change of temperaturek at log@xmath116 , co formation is complete and the partial pressure of co , @xmath117 , is almost independent of @xmath118 . in the region where co formation is incomplete ( i.e. , @xmath119 ) , the partial pressures of free c and o are @xmath120 and @xmath121 , respectively . then , @xmath122 where @xmath123 is the equilibrium constant defined in @xcite and , with the large dissociation energy of co , @xmath124ev , @xmath125 shows a drastic change with @xmath118 . ] .",
    "for this reason , co can not be a good abundance indicator of carbon for the sun @xcite .",
    "despite such a difficulty , however , an extensive analysis on the solar model photoshpere with the use of co spectrum itself has been done and the solar carbon , oxygen , and their isotopic abundances have been determined from the co ro - vibrational spectrum @xcite .    given that the difficulty due to the depressed continuum could be overcome by referring to the pseudo - continuum , the advantage of co as the abundance indicator of carbon for m dwarfs outlined above can fully be realized .",
    "in fact , we have determined the carbon abundances from co in 42 m dwarfs rather easily after correcting for the effect of the contamination of numerous weak h@xmath4o lines ( section 5 ) .",
    "so far , determinations of the elemental abundances in m dwarfs by a direct spectroscopic analysis are rather scarce , and our result for carbon abundances in 42 m dwarfs may be the largest sample of a directly determined elemental abundance or metallicity in m dwarfs at present .",
    "an unsettled problem is that we have two cases of different @xmath0 values for gj273 and gj725b . as for gj725b",
    ", the resulting carbon abundance of gj725b - h ( log@xmath126 ) agrees rather well with that of gj725a ( log@xmath127 ) while that of gj725b - l ( log@xmath128 ) does not ( see table10 ) .",
    "although such a test by binary can not be applied to gj273 , the result of the binary test for gj725b suggests that the @xmath0 by the @xmath1-method should be preferable for gj725b and hence possibly for gj273 . also , the deviations from the mean relations in figures 1 @xmath33 3 are rather large for gj273-l as well as for gj725b - l .",
    "for these reasons , we adopt the results for gj273-h and gj725b - h in the following discussion .",

    ", the log@xmath29 - [ fe / h ] correlation suggests that the c / fe ratios in m dwarfs are nearly constant at about the solar c / fe ratio based on the high carbon abundance @xcite rather than on the downward revised carbon abundance @xcite .",
    "this conclusion applies to the majority of m dwarfs shown in figure15a as well .",
    "given that the determination of carbon abundances is rather difficult in late type stars as exemplified by the solar case and that it is rather easy in m dwarfs by the use of co as noted above , our result on the carbon abundances in m dwarfs provides a strong constraint on the carbon abundances of the disk population in the solar neighborhood .",
    "presently known data shown in figure15 suggest a possibility of bifurcation in c / fe ratio in m dwarfs .",
    "the majority of m dwarfs belong to the group of c / fe ratio with the high solar carbon abundance and the minority belong to another group of c / fe ratio with the low solar carbon abundance .",
    "it may probably not be a serious problem if few m dwarfs belong to the minority group .",
    "however , it should be a problem if the sun belongs to the minority group or the solar c / fe ratio is atypical for [ fe / h]=0 .",
    "this problem if the sun is a typical star with respect to the relative abundances of the elements at [ fe / h]=0 was examined in detail by the analysis of 189 nearby unevolved stars by @xcite , who concluded that the sun is a quite typical star with respect to the relative abundances of about a dozen of the elements for its metallicity , age , and galactic orbit , although carbon itself was not included in their analysis .",
    "we point out that the recent downward revised solar carbon abundance is apparently contradicting with this result .    finally , the distribution of 42 m dwarfs against the carbon abundances is shown in figure16 , and most m dwarfs are confined to the range of log@xmath29 between -3.7 and -3.2 except for few cases outside of this range .",
    "also , our sample includes ten planet hosting m dwarfs ( those marked by @xmath8 in table1 ) as illustrated in figure16 .",
    "it appears that the planet hosting m dwarfs are biased towards carbon rich side while m dwarfs as a whole towards carbon poor side . as a result ,",
    "the fraction of the planet hosting m dwarfs is larger in m dwarfs of higher carbon abundances for our present sample .",
    "this result is in agreement with a tendency of metallicity in g , f , k , and m stars ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , our sample can not be regarded as an unbiased sample yet and we defer a detailed discussion on this matter to a future paper hopefully on an extended sample of m dwarfs .    ",
    "figure15a , b : carbon abundances and metallicities in m dwarfs ( p.22 ) .",
    "figure16 : distribution of carbon abundances in 42 m dwarfs ( p.23 ) .",
    "table11 : carbon abundances and metallicities in m dwarfs ( p.32 ) .",
    "table12 : carbon and iron abundances in m dwarfs ( p.32 ) .          the major problem in the spectral analysis of cool stars",
    "is generally thought to be due to the difficulty to locate the continuum level .",
    "we have examined the effect of depressed continuum due to the h@xmath4o veil opacity by our bs analysis and compared with the bb analysis disregarding the effect of h@xmath4o contamination .",
    "we have found that the neglect of the h@xmath4o blending results in an error of about 0.1dex at the largest in the derived abundance ( see @xmath98 in table10 ) .",
    "the probable errors of the bb analysis are 0.05 - 0.1dex ( table8 ) and those of the bs analysis are slightly larger ( table10 ) .",
    "thus , the effect of the depressed continuum may not be very large in the case we have studied in this paper .",
    "we estimate the external errors due to the uncertainties in the fundamental stellar parameters by the bb analysis ( subsection4.3 ) , and the results may be the same for the bs analysis , since the effects of the fundamental parameters should not be different for the two analyses .",
    "the uncertainties in log@xmath22 and in @xmath47 result in rather large external errors in general . however , we used the specified model for the log@xmath22 of each m dwarf and we hope that the effect of uncertainty in log@xmath22 can be minimized .",
    "the problem is the uncertainty in @xmath47 : if the results of @xmath129kmsec@xmath10 @xcite are typical values for m dwarfs , the uncertainty may not be so large as assumed in subsection4.3 .",
    "anyhow , this is the largest problem in our present analysis and we hope to determine @xmath47 by higher resolution spectra in future .",
    "we assume simple one - dimensional lte models throughout this paper .",
    "certainly , this is an over - simplification to the real photospheres of m dwarfs .",
    "for example , convection penetrates to the line forming region even in the classical convective models based on the mixing - length theory ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , even if inhomogeneity due to convection appears , the co abundance suffers little change since co is well stabilized in the photospheres of m dwarfs .",
    "for this reason , the inhomogeneity will not have such a drastic effect as in the sun ( e.g. , @xcite ) , at least for the analysis of co lines in m dwarfs .",
    "also , line formation in the dense photospheres of m dwarfs can be treated within the framework of lte , especially for the ro - vibration transitions @xcite .",
    "finally , we first wondered if abundance analysis could be done with the resolution as low as 20000 .",
    "we have found , however , that the abundance analysis is rather simple at such a medium resolution , as can be known from the fact that the synthetic spectra can be matched rather easily without specifying any velocity parameters to the observed spectra in which all the details are smeared out by the slit function of fwhm = 16 km sec@xmath10 .",
    "such a fitting does not provide any new information except for confirming the abundance determined by the analysis of the ews , but such a simplicity of analysis will be useful if we are to analyze a large sample of stars .",
    "we are convinced that the abundance analysis can be carried out by an analysis of ews with the spectra of medium resolution , even though a high accuracy as realized by the higher resolution ( e.g. @xmath130 ) can not be achieved . however , even if the highest accuracy can not be attained , the chemical composition is the prime fundamental data in astronomy and should best be determined by the direct analysis of the spectra .",
    "we believe that the spectroscopic analysis of m dwarfs can provide unique contribution to the problem of the cosmic chemical abundances and we hope more efforts will be directed to this field .      the @xmath131 diagram shown in figure 1 reveals a characteristic feature in that it shows bendings at @xmath132 and @xmath133 .",
    "such features should reflect the intrinsic properties of the stellar evolutionary models and , to clarify such a relationship , we generate an @xmath134 diagram or hr diagram by the use of the data given in tables 3 and 4 .",
    "the result is shown in figure17 where data based on the interferometry ( filled circles ) are extended to the lower temperatures by the data based on the infrared flux method ( open circles ) .",
    "for comparison , the theoretical hr diagram based on the evolutionary models by @xcite is shown by the solid line , on which stellar masses ( in unit of @xmath135 ) of the models are indicated .",
    "their models assumed the solar metallicity and covered the range between 0.075 and 1.0 @xmath135 , thus reaching the very end of the main sequence .",
    "although the number of data points is rather small , observations also cover the same range .",
    "the agreement between the theory and observations is fine especially in the regime of m dwarfs including the coolest ones .",
    "the bendings noted on figure1 are clearly transformed from those in figure17 .",
    "the changes of the slopes in figures1 and 17 correspond nicely to those in the central temperature - effective temperature relation given in fig.1 of @xcite .",
    "these changes of the slope have been explained as due to the onset of convection induced by the h@xmath4 formation in the photospheres of @xmath136 dwarfs ( @xmath137k ) and increased importance of the electron degeneracy in the interior of @xmath138 dwarfs ( @xmath139k ) @xcite .",
    "these points roughly correspond to the bendings at log@xmath140 and at log@xmath141 in figures17 as well as in figure1 .",
    "thus , recent observational hr diagram reaching the bottom of the main sequence finally provides fine confirmation on the detailed structures of the sophisticated evolutionary models of low mass stars , which had been accomplished long time ago .    ",
    "figure17 : observed and theoretical hr diagrams for low mass stars ( p.23 ) .    ",
    "in this paper , we have shown that the pseudo - continuum can be evaluated accurately on the theoretical spectrum of the m dwarf and use it as a reference in comparison with the observed spectrum for which only the pseudo - continuum can be known",
    ". then quantitative analysis of the spectra badly depressed by the molecular veil opacities can be carried out to some extent . such an analysis could be made possible by the recent progress in molecular physics which provided extensive line - lists with high precision ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) , and the importance of the molecular databases should be emphasized again .",
    "given that the difficulty due to depressed continuum has been overcome , abundance analysis of m dwarf stars offers unique opportunity which is not realized in other spectral types . in particular , we are now convinced that at least the carbon abundances in late - type stars could best be determined in m dwarfs rather than in solar type stars by the use of co as the abundance indicator",
    ". this result may be somewhat unexpected , but this is due to a favorable circumstance that carbon atoms in m dwarfs are mostly in stable co molecules which remains almost unchanged for the changes of physical condition in the photospheres of m dwarfs .",
    "the similar favorable condition is realized in the determination of oxygen abundance by the analysis of h@xmath4o consuming most oxygen left after co formation and hence stable in the photospheres of m dwarfs .",
    "the accurate determination of carbon and oxygen abundances in m dwarf stars , representing those of the stellar components of the galactic disk , has a special interest in connection with the yet unsettled problem of the solar carbon and oxygen abundances .    in this work ,",
    "we mainly observed m dwarfs earlier than dm5 except for dm6.5 dwarf gj406 , since we thought that it might be difficult to analyze later m dwarfs .",
    "however , we find that the dm6.5 dwarf gj406 could be analyzed in the same way as in the earlier m dwarfs without any additional problem .",
    "thus we are now convinced that the late m dwarfs can also be analyzed similarly only if the pseudo - continuum level can be defined . in the coolest",
    "m dwarfs of @xmath142k , a new problem is that dust should form in their photospheres ( e.g. , @xcite : @xcite ) .",
    "we are prepared to extend our analysis to such a case with our unified cloudy models ( ucms ) accommodating the dust clouds formed in their photospheres ( @xcite ; ) .",
    "we hope that such an extension to the coolest m dwarfs will be a pilot study for future works on more dusty objects including the exoplanets themselves .",
    "finally , we regret that our analysis is not yet satisfactory in that the spectral resolution ( @xmath143 or velocity resolution of 16kmsec@xmath10 ) is not high enough to extract the basic information coded in the spectra of m dwarfs ( e.g. , turbulent velocities ) and we hope further progress in high resolution infrared spectroscopy in the near future .",
    "the scientific justification for such a quest is obvious .",
    "in fact , there are large fields unexplored by high resolution in low luminosity objects including m subdwarfs , dwarf carbon stars , l , t , and y dwarfs , and exoplanets of various kinds , even if we confine our attention to the objects somewhat related to m dwarfs .",
    "the high resolution spectroscopy on these objects will be within the capability of the large telescopes both on ground and in space under planning ( or already in construction ) only if efficient spectrographs can be developed .",
    "we thank y. takeda and the staff of the subaru telescope for their help in observations .",
    "we also thank y. takeda for his help in data reduction of the echelle spectra .",
    "we thank an anonymous referee for careful reading of the text and for helpful suggestions , especially for suggesting to comment on the reason for the bendings in the plot of figure1 .",
    "this research makes use of data products from the wide - field infrared survey explorer which is a joint project of the university of california , los angeles , and the jet propulsion laboratory / california institute of technology , funded by nasa .",
    "this research has made use of the vizier catalogue access tool and the simbad database , both operated at cds , strasbourg , france , and of the recons database in www.recons.org .",
    "computations are carried out on common use data analysis computer system at the astronomy data center , adc , of the national astronomical observatory of japan .",
    "during the preparation of this manuscript , we notice a paper by @xcite who reported new measurements of stellar diameters by interferometry , and we find that the effective temperatures of three m dwarfs included in our sample have been determined anew by their work .",
    "we compare their results with ours based on the @xmath1 - log@xmath0 relation in table13 .",
    "we are a bit shocked to find a large discrepancy for gj876 , but we are also worried to find that the @xmath0 of this object by the interferometry deviates from the mean relation in figure1 as the case of gj725b .",
    "in fact , the situation of gj876 is very similar to the case of gj725b for which interferometry gave @xmath144k while the @xmath1-method suggests @xmath145k , and we finally decide to adopt the higher value based on the @xmath1-method by considering the result of a binary test ( see subsection6.2 ) .",
    "presently , we have no solution for gj876 and we leave this problem open .",
