    "extreme waves have the same statistics of ocean rogue waves but , to date , no evidence of a universality in the underlying dynamics has been reported .",
    "universal traits in the dynamics are especially important since they would indicate a common predictability of the extreme events . in most optical cases ,",
    "the formation of rogue events is accompanied by the onset of noise - seeded instabilities and turbulent dynamics @xcite",

    "open to debate is the role of nonlinearity .",
    "extreme spatio - temporal events have been observed in linear optical cavities for random fields presenting spectral inhomogeneity @xcite as well as in highly - nonlinear regimes in optical crystals , as in kerr and photorefractive feedback systems @xcite . in spite of the variety of these observations , the universality between ocean and optical rogue waves remains based only on their anomalous probability distribution and on their qualitative waveforms .",

    "@xcite have recently shown through nonlinear time series analysis how the dynamical features , such as the chaotic nature and the predictability of the process , are generally different .",
    "the inspected optical systems are shown to support rogue waves through a time process that appear either completely stochastic or completely deterministic , whereas the ocean dynamics presents small - scale predictable traits and large - scale unpredictability @xcite .    in this work",
    "we provide the first evidence of optical rogue waves with the same dynamics and predictability of ocean rogue waves .",
    "we examine extreme events that occur in photorefractive beam propagation in turbulent ferroelectrics @xcite . through the application of the grassberger - procaccia embedding method in the spatial domain @xcite",
    ", we find spatial chaos and significant predictability on scales up to the series autocorrelation length and we identify the complexity of such chaotic dynamics as a key ingredient in determining the observed large - scale unpredictability .",
    "in our analysis we consider the data series shown in fig .",
    "1(a ) , the output intensity distribution of light propagating in an out - of - equilibrium photorefractive ferroelectric in conditions leading to spatial rogue waves .",
    "this occurs when a kerr - saturated highly - nonlinear propagation is also affected by instabilities and a disordered response @xcite .",

    "1(a ) ) we consider all the subseries @xmath8 of dimension @xmath9 ( embedding dimension ) .",
    "the statistical distance @xmath10 that quantifies the difference between values assumed in two generic subseries , is evaluated for all @xmath11 and @xmath12 to compute the correlation integral @xmath13 as : @xmath14 the behavior of @xmath13 at small @xmath15 reflects the possible appearance of specific subseries with high ( non - random ) frequency , i.e. , it is sensitive to possible `` deja - vu '' phenomena when the series are sampled with a given scale @xmath9 .",
    "more specifically , a @xmath16 behavior at small @xmath15 is predicted , with an exponent @xmath17 that , for large embedding dimensions @xmath9 , characterizes the fractal correlation dimension of the attractor @xmath18 describing the possible chaotic dynamics @xcite . to extract the predictable or stochastic features in our series , we improve the embedding analysis with the method of surrogates , that , as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite for temporal ocean and optical rogue events , allows the comparison of the detected dynamics with the corresponding dynamics that would emerge from a pure random process .",
    "starting from physical random data , we compile surrogate data sets identical to the original series as regards for the linear statistical properties .",
    "these surrogates have the same probability distribution function ( long - tail statistics ) , autocorrelation functions and fourier spectrum of our original series , and appear as reordered copies of the observed spatial sequence @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "evaluating @xmath13 with surrogate data sets and comparing it with results for the original series we expect small differences if our data comes from a stochastic process .",
    "in contrast , as shown in fig .",
    "2(a ) for @xmath20 , large deviations are observed at low @xmath15 , with the rogue series that leads to enhanced recurrence frequencies compared to the average ones in the surrogates .",
    "the observed intensities with extreme events are therefore in principle predictable , meaning that the optical field in a point of space is directly related to that existing at least at distances smaller than @xmath9 .",
    "we quantify this predictability giving the significance of the discrepancy between @xmath13 for original and surrogate data ; this is reported in fig .",
    "2(b ) ( blue line ) in units of surrogate standard deviations @xmath21 and has been evaluated as an average difference at low @xmath15 .",
    "large predictability characterizes the series on small and intermediate scales @xmath9 , then it vanishes as the autocorrelation length @xmath3 is reached , in proximity of @xmath22 ( corresponding to @xmath23 ) . in other words , on larger scales the spatial dynamics of photorefractive rogue waves lose traces of determinism and appear indistinguishable from a re - ordered random series in which the same values of intensity appears .",
    "this scale - dependent behavior is at odds with other reported optical data in the temporal domain , that is either wholly predictable for rogue events in optical filamentation or wholly random for those observed in optical fibers @xcite . in turn",
    ", it remarkably mimics the features of the temporal dynamics of ocean rogue waves . to see this we extract from ref .",
    "@xcite the corresponding predictability for ocean data ( draupner data sets , 1995 @xcite ) and we plot their behavior in fig .",
    "2(b ) ( red lines ) .",
    "as observed in our spatial series , ocean rogue events have a chaotic and predictable dynamics for scales up to the autocorrelation time @xmath24 that turn unpredictable for long time - scales .",
    "in other words , we find that photorefractive spatial rogue waves and oceanic rogue waves share the same dynamical process , that is , they share a common universal predictability .     at @xmath20 for photorefractive extreme events , showing a large deviation of the rogue waves data ( blue line ) from the average of surrogates ( green line ) ,",
    "whose spread is indicated by the standard deviation over fifty independent realizations of surrogates ( green - dotted lines ) .",
    "( b ) significance of deviations from surrogates as a function of @xmath9 for optical data ( blue line ) and for the temporal dynamics of ocean rogue waves ( red and red - dotted lines stays respectively for draupner2 and draupner1 data , as reported in ref .",
    "the horizontal black line indicates the minimum confidences of @xmath25 separating predictable and unpredictable dynamics ; @xmath3 and @xmath24 are respectively the autocorrelation length and time for the optical and ocean series expressed in term of the embedding dimension @xmath9 . ]",
    "[ figure2 ]        [ figure3 ]",
    "a fundamental question arising from the universal behavior shown in fig .",
    "2(b ) is the long - scale unpredictability .",
    "in fact , it may be due to an intrinsic property , that is , rogue data are actually stochastic on these scales and turbulence rules only locally the spatial dynamics .",
    "on the other hand , it may be a `` practical '' unpredictability related to the use of the embedding method for such dynamics . to address the issue we consider @xmath13 for photorefractive rogue waves that , as reported in log - scale in fig .",
    "3(a ) , show a linear behavior at low @xmath15 with a slope that increases with the embedding dimensions @xmath9 .",
    "the extracted exponent @xmath17 as a function of @xmath9 is reported in fig .",
    "the behavior is characterized by a well - defined linear growth at low @xmath9 , as typically occurs in dynamical processes both of chaotic and stochastic origin @xcite , since , basically , similarities in subseries are much less likely increasing the subseries size . in general ,",
    "chaos is highlighted by a saturation of @xmath17 at large @xmath9 and the approached value corresponds to the fractal correlation dimension of the attractor @xmath18 .",
    "we observe that starting from @xmath26 the linear behavior is damped and seems to saturate to a constant value in proximity of @xmath27 .",
    "however , a careful analysis is needed in deducing the chaotic dynamics from fig .",
    "noise in experimental data , emerging from the physical realization of the process and from its detection , affects especially the estimate of @xmath17 for long subseries , that consequently present a larger uncertainty .",
    "more importantly , a crucial role is played by the amount of available data @xmath2 @xcite . because the number of independent subseries @xmath28 used in the embedding method scales as @xmath29 ,",
    "the information that can be extracted is limited when considering long scales . for a series of @xmath2 points",
    ", numerical criteria set the maximum observable value of @xmath17 approximately at @xmath30 @xcite ( horizontal line in fig .",
    "3(b ) ) , implying that only values sufficiently below this threshold are reliable . from this point of view",
    ", the reported saturation of @xmath17 can not be used to demonstrate the presence of a low - dimensional attractor .",
    "however , it implies at least the presence of a high - dimensional attractor that underlies the complexity of the chaotic dynamics .",
    "we analyze the scale dependence of the this dynamics using the generalized entropies @xmath31,\\ ] ] in which a plateau to a constant value indicates the chaotic origin of the signal @xcite . as shown in fig .",
    "3(c ) flat entropies characterize the series for @xmath32 , confirming that the signal is revealed as deterministic on these scales . for @xmath33 ,",
    "@xmath34 exhibits a noisy and non - monotonic behavior , consistent with the absence of predictable traits , as previously pointed out in fig .",
    "2(b ) , and with a complex and non - random dynamics . in fact",
    ", stochastic series generally presents a linear decreasing of @xmath34 as a function of @xmath15 . following these results and the above criterion limiting the detection of @xmath17",
    ", we estimate that only results for @xmath35 ( green area in fig . 3(b ) ) are meaningful to the correlation features shown by the series and , here , only signs of a saturation in @xmath17 are present . above this `` transition '' , to resolve the long - range dynamics up to @xmath9 , the grassberger - procaccia method needs an amount of data @xmath2 that grows exponentially with @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "therefore the large - scale unpredictability for photorefractive rogue waves has roots in the complex behavior of the dynamical process and the same fact is expected to hold for the ocean ones .",
    "we note that in adressing universality we are here comparing different dynamics in space and time , where the role of nonlinearity is also expected to be greatly different .",
    "specifically , in the emergence of such universal dynamics a basic tassel may be provided by the generalized nonlinear schrdinger model that is involved in the description of both cases @xcite . however , for water waves it is not established if deterministic solitonic solutions of this model @xcite can describe the observed ocean statistics and dynamics , or if linear interacting random waves can also play a key rule in these properties @xcite . for propagation in photorefractive media ,",
    "optical long - tail statistics emerge in highly - nonlinear and randomic conditions dominated by inelastic soliton interaction @xcite .",
    "this suggests that chaotic traits may lie at the heart of extreme events independently of the strength of the nonlinear mechanism .",
    "it has long been speculated that the emergence of rogue waves is characterized by universal properties that can be found across different fields of physics . studying the experimental spatial distribution of photorefractive rogue waves and mapping the detected intensity distribution into a dynamical system , using embedding methods to analyze recurrences in the series , we have found a chaotic and predictable behavior on scales up to the autocorrelation length , a physical dynamic that turns out to be the same as that exhibited by ocean rogue waves .",
    "this universality is quantitative and completes the analogy between ocean and optical extreme events previously based qualitatively on the probability distribution function and on the waveforms .",
    "it opens the key possibility to address the puzzle of ocean rogue wave predictability using light .",
    "indeed , the unpredictability on large scales appears for optical events as a property not related to a stochastic process but to the complexity of this dynamics , that , given the finite size of the sample , can not be resolved to arbitrary distances with the embedding method .",
    "our results shed light on the universality of extreme events in optics and ocean dynamics and point out chaos and complexity as fundamental physical ingredients for rogue waves and their predictability in different spatially - extended systems .",
