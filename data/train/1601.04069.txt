    "measurements of the masses and radii of the component stars in detached eclipsing binaries ( deb ) can be used to precisely determine the age of the stars if at least one of the eclipsing stars has begun to evolve away from the main sequence .",
    "the use of mass and radius ( @xmath10 ) measurements of eclipsing stars avoids or minimizes systematic uncertainties introduced by factors such as distance , interstellar reddening , and color - temperature conversions that can affect age measurements @xcite . when eclipsing binaries occur in star clusters , their utility increases dramatically because they place constraints on the age of _ all _ the stars in the cluster .",
    "multiple debs in a cluster can provide @xmath10 measurements for stars having a range in mass , and can constrain the age even more tightly . with a well - determined age for a cluster , the color - magnitude diagram ( cmd )",
    "can be used to test the effects of evolution on an even larger number of stars .",
    "comparisons of the masses and radii of eclipsing stars and the cmd with theoretical stellar models can also lead to deeper inferences about chemical composition variables such as helium abundance @xcite .",
    "this study focuses on the rich open cluster ngc 6819 , which has been observed thoroughly from the ground and with the _ kepler _ spacecraft .",
    "ngc 6819 is a well - studied cluster : its cmd @xcite as well as stellar variability @xcite have been examined in multiple studies .",
    "in addition , the cluster has been part of the wiyn open cluster survey ( wocs ; @xcite ) with comprehensive long - term radial - velocity studies presented by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "thanks to the nearly continuous monitoring and high precision photometry by _ kepler _ , studies of stellar ages using multiple techniques have been kickstarted .",
    "because several techniques can be applied within the same cluster , a comparison of results should ultimately improve our understanding of each .",
    "@xcite used asteroseismic data from _ kepler _ to constrain basic properties of red giant stars and to place constraints on the cluster distance [ @xmath11 and age ( between 2.1 and 2.5 gyr ) .",
    "stellar rotation measurements have been used to examine the gyrochronological ages of two of the four open clusters in the _ kepler _ field : ngc 6811 @xcite and ngc 6819 @xcite .",
    "@xcite describes how the age of ngc 6819 can be found using the faint end of the white dwarf cooling sequence , and @xcite present an age of @xmath12 gyr using that technique . for our part",
    ", we have so far analyzed two eclipsing systems in ngc 6819 ( wocs 23009 / kic 5024447 , @xcite ; wocs 40007 / kic 5113053 , @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    "we present the triple - lined system wocs 24009 ( also known as kic 5023948 / auner 665 ; @xmath13 , @xmath14 ) to add to the grid of cluster stars with precisely - determined masses and to further constrain the age of ngc 6819 .",
    "we identify the three stars as follows : component a is the brightest contributor to spectra and is on a wide orbit around the short - period detached eclipsing binary made up of components b and c , where b is slightly brighter and more massive than c and is the star being eclipsed during primary eclipse , as we will discuss in the analysis sections .",
    "this system is promising because all three stars are bright enough to be studied spectroscopically , the three can be shown to be physically associated , and it contains one of the most evolved stars in the cluster whose mass can be directly determined from radial - velocity measurements .    in  2",
    ", we describe the observations we employed , and describe the improved spectroscopic analysis techniques that allowed us to minimize the mass and radius measurement uncertainties in the the face of three sets of blended lines .",
    "we also used these techniques to improve our previously presented measurements of wocs 23009 and wocs 40007 . in  3 , we discuss the membership of the system , and describe the modeling of the eclipsing binary and the orbit of the bright non - eclipsing star . in  4",
    ", we discuss the photometry of the stars , and use all three eclipsing systems in a combined analysis to derive the cluster distance modulus and age .",
    "our datasets include ground - based and space - based _ kepler _ photometric observations along with long - term radial - velocity observations .",
    "in addition to the work on the wocs 24009 system , we also discuss improvements to the dataset for wocs 40007 @xcite below .",

    "other evidence that supports cluster membership are the physical similarities between wocs 24009 eclipsing binary stars and the well - measured stars in wocs 40007 @xcite , for which the membership information is more complete . based on the evidence available to date ,",

    "three stellar components were identifiable in spectra taken of wocs 24009 even before the _ kepler _ mission began .",
    "however , due to the similar characteristics of the fainter two stars and significant blending with the brightest component in many spectra , an orbital solution had not been determined .",
    "the _ kepler _ photometry not only made it possible to differentiate between the two eclipses of very similar depth , but the eclipse timings also showed clear evidence of a light travel time ( ltt ) effect resulting from the gravitational influence of a third star on a wide orbit .",
    "it also became clear that scatter in the rvs of the eclipsing stars was being introduced by reflex motion of the binary in response to the motion of component a. the eclipse timings are given in table [ etimes ] with the earliest eclipse observed from the ground in july 2001 @xcite .",
    "we therefore sought a consistent solution assuming that the system is hierarchical : the eclipsing stars in the binary follow keplerian orbits , and component a and the barycenter of the binary also follow much larger keplerian orbits .",
    "the modeling of the stars was therefore separated into two parts : characterization of the radial velocity curve of the eclipsing binary and the wide orbit of the component a using the rvs and eclipse timings , and characterization of the light curves to derive final masses and radii for the eclipsing stars .",

    "@xcite found some indication that the radius of wocs 40007 b is larger than expected from models with the spectroscopic composition @xcite and preferred age of 2.5 gyr , but at the time the precision of the mass measurement prevented this from being a strong statement .",
    "they considered the possibility that perhaps the adopted metallicity or some other composition variable ( most importantly , helium ) was offset from the cluster value .",
    "they examined models with decreased metallicity that produced a slightly better consistency between the ages implied by both eclipsing stars in wocs 40007 .",
    "ages implied by the lower metallicity were lower by about @xmath0 0.2 gyr and were more consistent with ages derived from the cmd fits .",
    "however , with the improvement of the mass measurements for wocs 40007 , the differences between observations and models are considerably more significant , and radius inflation may be necessary to explain the characteristics of component b , and possibly both stars .",
    "the eclipsing stars of wocs 24009 provide an empirical basis for judging the radius of wocs 40007 b  the masses of the stars are similar ( so they should have comparable internal stellar structure ) , and they were formed in the same cluster ( so that their initial chemical compositions should be identical ) . however , wocs 24009 has a longer period , and should show somewhat weaker evidence of rotationally - induced activity .",
    "indeed , we find that the radii of wocs 40007 b and wocs 24009 b and c are very similar even though wocs 40007 b is @xmath215 smaller in mass .",
    "so there is some indication that the radius of wocs 40007 b is inflated by a few percent .",
    "results for other close binaries provide additional perspective . detached systems with solar - type stars and periods shorter than 3 d ( e.g. ef aqr ; @xcite )",

    "on the other hand , binaries with periods as short as 6.94 d ( ew ori , @xcite ) show good agreement with standard models of solar - type stars .",
    "one other system with a period between 3 and 7 d contains a lower - mass star with significant radius inflation ( v636 cen : @xmath217 d , @xmath218 ; @xcite ) , but the orbits in that system are significantly eccentric ( @xmath219 ) and the stars rotate pseudosynchronously with the orbit",
    ".    the larger period of wocs 24009 compared to wocs 40007 probably has a relatively small effect itself  it probably means that the rotational velocities of the stars in wocs 24009 are lower by about 15% .",
    "if the wocs 24009 stars are rotating synchronously with their orbit , the equatorial rotation speed should be about 15 km s@xmath35 .",
    "probably more important is the larger mass of the wocs 24009 stars .",

    "* ) between wocs 40007 b and wocs 23009 a , and the radial extent of the convective zones are reduced by an even greater factor .",
    "these differences might be expected to reduce the effects of magnetic activity more drastically .",
    "the photometry of wocs 40007 b can be decomposed accurately from the other two stars thanks to the total eclipses . using the eclipse depths we derived in @xmath220 ,",
    "we can put component b in different cmds , as seen in figure [ cmda259 ] .",
    "when @xmath80 color is used , component b falls slightly to the blue of the main sequence , but in @xmath221 and @xmath222 colors , component b falls significantly to the red of the main sequence .",
    "this also holds true for a comparison with the wocs 24009 eclipsing stars as well .",
    "checking the dates of the calibrating observations for the sources ( @xcite for @xmath80 , @xcite for @xmath221 , and @xcite for @xmath222 ) , we see no reason to believe that the cmd photometry for wocs 40007 was affected by eclipses . according to the reddening map from @xcite ,",
    "wocs 40007 is in a slightly more heavily reddened portion of the cluster field .",
    "this can partly explain the red positions of wocs 40007 b in @xmath221 and @xmath222 , but we do not have an explanation for the bluer position in @xmath80 .",
    "a remaining question is whether the even more massive star wocs 40007 a has had its radius affected .",
    "when the more massive star in a short period detached binary is expected to have a very low mass convective envelope , the radius generally agrees better with standard stellar models ( e.g. fl lyr , @xcite ; v1061 cyg , @xcite ) .",
    "however , in field binaries , modest increases in radius can be disguised as larger ages if the age is not otherwise constrained , as it is in clusters ( see v375 cep in the cluster ngc 7142 ; @xcite ) . the convective envelope of wocs 40007 a",
    "is theoretically expected to be less massive than those in the wocs 24009 stars by another factor of more than 2 .",
    "a combination of somewhat larger than average reddening for wocs 40007 and a correction for the contribution of the faint third star is able to shift the brighter eclipsing star into the middle of the main sequence band .",
    "because the three stars appear to share the same mass - radius isochrone , we will treat wocs 40007 a as probably unaffected by the interaction with its companion .",
    "to further study the connection between chromospheric activity and stellar size , more examples of well - studied binaries in the suggested mass range with accurately measured mass , radius , and temperature will be needed to map out the dependence of radius inflation on orbital period / rotational velocity and stellar mass / convection zone depth . in the sample of eclipsing stars in ngc 6819 ,",
    "component b in wocs 40007 shows the strongest evidence of tidal inflation as a result of the interaction with its companion component a , but additional work on the eclipsing binaries will be needed to improve the significance of the comparison .",
    "part of the effort in this paper has been to incorporate all of our results for the eclipsing binaries of ngc 6819 into a better overall constraint on the characteristics of the star cluster . because the photometry of individual stars ( in conjunction with their masses ) contains precision information that can contribute to age determination , we discuss our procedure for decomposing the light of the different multiple star systems into each component .      the total eclipse of wocs 40007 b gives us a precise means of separating the light of component b. we remeasured the eclipse depths after the re - reduction of the ground - based photometry described in ",
    "we only included nights for which we could measure both the eclipse minimum and out - of - eclipse levels .",
    "the results are shown in table [ a259depths ] , and the resulting magnitudes for component b are shown in table [ summary ] .",
    "the light of component a and the faint third star can not be as precisely disentangled .",
    "we drew magnitudes for the third star from an isochrone fitting the cluster s cmd and found a value that put the brightest eclipsing star near the isochrone",
    ". this assumption might not be correct if tidal interactions with component b result in significant changes to the star s temperature .",
    "however , based on the results from other close binaries , we expect stars with less massive surface convection zones ( like wocs 40007 a ) to be less affected , as discussed in  [ inflate ] .      on the face of it , we might seem to have limited constraints on the distribution of light among the three stars in wocs 24009 .",
    "the eclipses of almost equal depth corroborate the idea that the eclipsing stars are nearly identical . however , the precision of the photometry of component a is limited by our ability to disentangle its light from that of the eclipsing binary . component a s photometry was initially estimated using photometry taken from a theoretical isochrone that fits the cluster cmd , where we assumed that the system was composed of a bright , bluer third star and two fainter , redder stars with identical characteristics . however , realistic solutions for component a and the eclipsing stars cover large ranges ( 0.9 mag in @xmath16 for wocs 24009 a , and 1.5 mag for the eclipsing stars ) , showing this to be a weak constraint .",

    "this would be an important constraint if the stars only underwent partial eclipses .",
    "closer examination of the light curves indicates that the stars must at least come close to totally eclipsing because the eclipse depths ( @xmath228 mag ) are consistent with the amount of light contributed by the eclipsing stars in the broadening functions .",
    "indeed , for the best resolved eclipses , there is a brief period of totality , as could occur for stars that differ in radius by less than 4% .",
    "the light curve fits also indicate that the inclination of the eclipsing binary is within a degree of being edge - on .",
    "this news means that the system photometry can be precisely decomposed : the light from component c in the eclipsing binary is directly measurable from the secondary eclipse depth , the similarity of component b along with light curve fits can then constrain its contribution , and the bright component a is the remainder .",
    "because the period of totality is so brief and the contribution of component a is so large , it is not as feasible to use a direct measurement of the secondary eclipse depth in the same way as we did for wocs 40007 above .",
    "we therefore derived light ratios from our light curve analysis and used them to decompose the system s photometry .",
    "although we did use the broadening function light constraints in our models , the final light ratios are driven by the existence of the total eclipse and the near identical characteristics of the eclipsing stars .. this underscores that the broadening function values from section [ bf ] were systematically in error as a result of the significant temperature difference between component a and the eclipsing stars .",
    "however , the light curve fit overrode the constraint value we used . ] the decomposed photometry of wocs 24009 is given in table [ summary ] .",
    "the color of the bright a component is consistent with the spectroscopic temperature for our preferred reddening , and all three stars fall within the band of the main sequence in the cmd .",
    "the decomposed photometry of wocs 24009 can be found in figure [ decomp_cmd ] along with the other measured cluster members .",
    "although we can find isochrones that fit the masses and photometry of the eclipsing stars of each binary ( wocs 40007 and wocs 24009 ) separately to within @xmath106 , there are no solutions that simultaneously fit all four stars that precisely .",
    "a distance modulus of @xmath229 threads through the error ellipses for all of the stars at a little more than @xmath106 away , but we must consider the possibility of systematic errors .",
    "the relative brightnesses of the stars in each binary are consistent with their masses for models with a wide range of ages and compositions . however , the components of wocs 40007 imply a smaller distance modulus than wocs 24009 by about 0.1 mag .",
    "differential reddening is a natural place to seek an explanation for this discrepancy because the @xcite map appears to be over - correcting wocs 40007 : both components appear to be bluer than the corrected main sequence , and wocs 40007 b is significantly brighter than wocs 24009 c in spite of a smaller measured mass .",
    "however , to bring the wocs 40007 stars back to the cluster main sequence , the reddening correction would need to be well outside of the distribution of corrections for nearby stars ( within about an arcmin ) .",
    "proper - motion and radial - velocity information argues against the idea that wocs 40007 is a foreground nonmember system .",
    "our current best explanation is that the wocs 40007 star characteristics have been affected by star - star interactions in the case of component b , and by imperfectly determined corrections for the faint third star star in the case of component a.          the simplest case is the long period binary wocs 23009 . the small amplitude of the total secondary eclipse in the _ kepler _ photometry ( 0.002 mag ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) indicates that we can treat the system photometry as essentially identical to that of the brightest eclipsing star  any corrections would be less than the uncertainty in the system magnitude . in all of the measured debs in ngc 6819 , wocs 23009 a is potentially the best indicator of age for the cluster , as it is the most evolved star with a measured radius .        we have updated our estimate of the mass of wocs 23009 a using the photometry and masses of our eclipsing binary star measurements .",
    "@xcite determined the mass of wocs 23009 a to be @xmath230 using an isochrone - based extrapolation from the masses and photometry of the components of the binary wocs 40007 .",
    "it is almost certainly more massive than wocs 24009 a , but it is part of a single - lined binary and so its mass could only be estimated from its cmd position relative to other cluster stars of known mass .",

    "fits for a choice of isochrone ( from a particular research group with specific composition and age ) give uncertainties of about @xmath231 for the mass of wocs 23009 a , with an additional @xmath232 coming from uncertainty in the @xmath16 magnitude of wocs 23009 .",

    "when varying the metal content along with the helium content ( assuming , like most stellar modelers , that there is a constant @xmath238 ) , there are smaller systematic changes because of the compensating effects of @xmath239 and @xmath208 : reducing the metal content from @xmath211 to @xmath240 reduces the mass of wocs 23009 a by about @xmath232 . based on these considerations , we estimate the systematic uncertainty due to model differences to be @xmath241 .    our new estimate of the mass of wocs 23009 a is @xmath242 , where the two uncertainties are estimates of the random and systematic effects , and we have taken the central value to be between the parsec and dsep / vr values using @xmath240 and 0.015 .",
    "this is consistent with our original estimate ( @xmath243 , @xcite ) .",

    "regardless of that choice , these uncertainties together lead to an uncertainty of about 0.1 gyr in the age implied by wocs 23009 a. based on the comparison with @xmath254 models , the implied ages are 2.12 gyr for vr , 2.15 gyr for y@xmath248 , 2.21 gyr for dsep , and 2.31 gyr for parsec . based on the scatter in these values ,",

    "our derived age is in agreement with asteroseismic @xcite and white dwarf cooling @xcite ages for the cluster .",
    "stellar model differences remain one of the biggest contributors to the uncertainty in the age .",
    "to reduce this source of error , it is helpful to review the systematic differences between model sets even if we can not be completely certain of the causes . in the @xmath10 comparisons made at the same metal content @xmath208 , vr isochrones gave the youngest ages of the model sets we tested , and y@xmath248 returned the largest ages . in cmd comparisons , vr , y@xmath248 , and dsep models gave similar ages , with parsec models returning the oldest age .",
    "the dependencies of these comparisons on different model inputs ( chemical composition mix , the treatment of core convection and diffusion , and color - temperature transformations , among others ) should continue to help drive us toward more accurate models .",

    "<S> as part of our study of the old ( @xmath02.5 gyr ) open cluster ngc 6819 in the _ kepler _ field , we present photometric ( _ kepler _ and ground - based @xmath1 ) and spectroscopic observations of the detached eclipsing binary wocs 24009 ( auner 665 ; kic 5023948 ) with a short orbital period of 3.6 days . </S>",
    "<S> wocs 24009 is a triple - lined system , and we verify that the brightest star is physically orbiting the eclipsing binary using radial velocities and eclipse timing variations . </S>",
    "<S> the eclipsing binary components have masses @xmath2 and @xmath3 , and radii @xmath4 and @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the bright non - eclipsing star resides at the cluster turnoff , and ultimately its mass will directly constrain the turnoff mass : our preliminary determination is @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> a careful examination of the light curves indicates that the fainter star in the eclipsing binary undergoes a very brief period of total eclipse , which enables us to precisely decompose the light of the three stars and place them in the color - magnitude diagram .    </S>",
    "<S> we also present improved analysis of two previously discussed detached eclipsing stars in ngc 6819 ( wocs 40007 and wocs 23009 ) en route to a combined determination of the cluster s distance modulus @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> because this paper significantly increases the number of measured stars in the cluster , we can better constrain the age of the color - magnitude diagram to be @xmath8 gyr . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , using all measured eclipsing binary star masses and radii , we constrain the age to @xmath9 gyr . </S>",
    "<S> the quoted uncertainties are estimates of measurement and systematic uncertainties ( due to model physics differences and metal content ) , respectively . </S>"
