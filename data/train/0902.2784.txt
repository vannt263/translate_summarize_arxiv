    "elucidating the physical processes that regulate global star formation is one of the keys to understanding galaxy evolution .",
    "the power - law relation , over several orders of magnitude , between the warm hi and cold molecular gas surface density and star formation intensity ( `` schmidt - kennicutt law '' ) is telling us that there must be underlying physical processes that control and regulate star formation ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "however , with a myriad of possible mechanisms for regulating star formation over large scales  cloud formation and destruction , mechanical energy output from stars and agn , spiral density waves , turbulence induced by gravity and mechanical energy , magnetic fields , mixing layers , and many others  it is challenging to distill a unifying explanation over many orders of magnitudes in gas density .",
    "one possible way of advancing our understanding of the processes that regulate global star formation is by studying the most extreme star - forming galaxies locally and at cosmological distances ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "thanks to recent technological improvements , we are now able to study the basic physical processes driving galaxy assembly directly and over large ranges of cosmic time .",
    "in particular , the number of galaxies at redshifts of 2@xmath33 with detailed integral - field spectroscopic studies in the rest - frame optical is still small , less than a few dozen , but growing rapidly .",
    "these observations allow us to trace spatially resolved emission - line properties , and to investigate galaxy kinematics and the physical conditions of the ionized gas . up to now",
    ", most studies have focused on the kinematic properties of the galaxies and less so on the properties of the emission lines themselves beyond their relative velocities and widths .",
    "recombination line fluxes were used to estimate star - formation rates using simple prescriptions developed for low - redshift galaxies @xcite .    with these estimates and assumptions , far - reaching conclusions",
    "have been made regarding the modes of galaxy assembly and the drivers of star formation in the early universe .",
    "many of these studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) favor a scenario where high - redshift galaxies exhibit gaseous disks of @xmath010 - 20 kpc in size , which , unlike galaxies at low redshift , are dynamically hot with large gas velocity dispersions , @xmath4 , relative to their bulk velocities , @xmath5 ( see also * ? ? ? * ) . the ratios of random to large scale velocity shear at high redshift are of order v/@xmath6few , compared to v@xmath7 at low redshift .",
    "to explain these observations , @xcite proposed a scenario where galaxies at z@xmath8 accrete significant amounts of cold gas , which after accumulating and forming gaseous disks , will become gravitationally unstable and lead to the observed high star formation rates @xcite . in this picture ,",
    "mergers and hydrodynamic processes like feedback from star formation and agn play only a minor role in assembling early galaxies , beginning to play a significant role only as a consequence of the build - up of the bulk of the stellar mass in bulges and disks .",
    "given the faintness of the targets and the often low number of diagnostic optical emission lines , usually only studying h@xmath1 or [ oiii]@xmath95007 , many of these results must rely on the assumption that the gas conditions in the interstellar medium will overall be largely similar to those in galaxies at low redshift .",
    "this assumption has not been tested directly on the observed properties of high - redshift galaxies .",
    "we already know of ( or may plausibly expect ) several major differences between galaxies at high and at low redshift , which may strongly influence the state of their interstellar medium and thus , their rest - frame optical line emission .",
    "first , many galaxies at high redshift are less evolved , with higher fractions @xcite of lower - metallicity gas @xcite .",
    "this may have rather subtle observational consequences .",
    "for example , @xcite discuss the expected morphology of an advanced ( or mostly relaxed ) merger of two gas - rich disk galaxies as would be observed using state - of - the - art integral - field units ( ifus ) .",
    "they find that their model reproduces the observed properties of high redshift galaxies as well as pure ( and isolated ) disk models , which are often favored by observers in contrast to on - going or advanced mergers @xcite .",
    "second , virtually all high - redshift galaxies studied in detail with ifus have very high surface brightnesses of the recombination lines .",
    "given the impact of cosmological surface brightness dimming , which is a strong function of redshift ( @xmath10 for bolometric luminosities and spectral lines , @xmath11 for broadband photometry due to the additional stretching of the continuum ; see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and current observational limits , all observations at high redshift will naturally be biased towards the most luminous emission - line regions , and the most luminous galaxies . as a result ,",
    "all galaxies so far studied with ifus have star - formation rates of several 10s of m@xmath12 yr@xmath13 or more , and typical star - formation intensities , @xmath14 , well above the critical threshold of sfi@xmath15 0.1 m@xmath12 yr@xmath13 kpc@xmath16@xcite necessary to drive vigorous outflows in local galaxies .",
    "galaxies with @xmath17 are observed to create and maintain strongly over - pressurized bubbles of hot gas from the thermalized ejecta of supernovae and massive young stars , which expand perpendicular to the disk plane and produce galactic - scale outflows @xcite .",
    "these outflows may play an important role in rendering a starburst `` self - regulating '' @xcite .",
    "the observational signatures of starburst - driven winds , such as characteristic velocity offsets between the rest - frame uv absorption lines and the systemic velocity @xcite , or blue wings in rest - frame optical emission lines ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , are commonly observed at high redshift . in a detailed study of a massive , z@xmath18 starburst and the related outflow of a submillimeter - selected galaxy at z@xmath18 , @xcite found that overall , the physical properties of maximal starbursts at z@xmath02@xmath33 appear very similar to local starbursts .",
    "the starburst appears to be self - regulating , and characteristic , density - sensitive line ratios suggest that the pressures in the starburst region , which are ultimately driving the observed outflow , are very similar to those in low - redshift starbursts .",
    "this may have a non - negligible impact on our interpretation of the physical processes in high - redshift galaxies , because much of our well - established low - redshift emission line diagnostics relies on the physical gas conditions in rather subtle ways .",
    "for example , when relating the ratios of strong , low - ionization nebular emission lines with h@xmath1 , like , /h@xmath1 , /h@xmath1 , or /h@xmath1 with the /h@xmath19 ratios , starburst galaxies will fall onto a characteristic curve @xcite , whereas agn will fall into a different part of the diagram . for high - redshift galaxies , however , the same relationship may not be strictly valid .",
    "@xcite observed that , although uv selected galaxies at z@xmath8 follow the overall shape of the starburst - curve in the /h@xmath1 versus /h@xmath19 diagram , as a whole , they are offset towards larger  fluxes .",
    "@xcite collected a comparison sample of low - redshift sdss galaxies with similar offsets , and found that these galaxies also had statistically higher h@xmath1 equivalent widths .",
    "they argue that the most likely explanation may be higher ionization parameters and densities in high - redshift star - forming regions compared to local galaxies .",
    "we will further develop these arguments and illustrate that pressures induced by the starbursts may very naturally explain some of the kinematic properties of high - redshift galaxies as well .",
    "however , the line ratios indicative of excitation by an agn may also shift at high redshift @xcite . since most luminous agn at low redshift",
    "preferentially reside in massive galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and because gas metallicity correlates with galaxy mass ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , most agn hosts at low redshift will have narrow - line regions with high metallicities . @xcite modeled the diagnostic line ratios for agn in relatively low - metallicity host galaxies .",
    "they showed that star - formation plus agn in relatively low metallicity host galaxies could explain the offset observed for example by @xcite .",
    "we will show that many z@xmath20 galaxies fall very close to these regions , which may make it difficult to robustly quantify the role of agn and starbursts in exciting the optical emission line gas .",
    "we will in the following present an analysis of 11 galaxies with particularly deep near - infrared integral - field spectroscopy obtained at the vlt .",
    "these data allow in particular to trace intrinsically fainter nebular emission lines such as @xmath96300 and @xmath216716,6731 which being close in wavelength to h@xmath1 often fall into the same band .",
    "a subset of 5 galaxies also have measurements of the @xmath94959,5007 and h@xmath19 lines , which fall into the near - infrared h band , and which have not been discussed previously in the literature .",
    "many of the arguments in previous papers are based on the implicit assumption that most of the emission originates from `` ordinary ''  regions similar to low - redshift disk galaxies and thus , that observations of the warm ionized gas are representative of all of the kinematics and other properties of the phases of the ism .",
    "in contrast , our analysis is aimed at quantifying the physical conditions in the interstellar medium of these galaxies principally by investigating the surface brightnesses of the recombination lines , various optical emission line ratios , and line widths to test this underlying assumption .    throughout the paper",
    "we adopt a flat h@xmath2270 km s@xmath13 mpc@xmath23 concordance cosmology with @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "for our analysis of the physical conditions in the interstellar medium of strongly star - forming , high - redshift galaxies , we collected a sample of 11 galaxies at z@xmath01.5@xmath32.5 from the sins program @xcite with rest - frame optical integral - field spectroscopy ( table  [ table : properties ] ) .",
    "data were taken with the near - infrared integral - field spectrograph sinfoni on the eso very large telescope in several runs between 2004 and 2006 .",
    "observations have been presented elsewhere @xcite .",
    "we reduced these data independently from any other previous work , using the iraf @xcite standard tools for the reduction of longslit spectra , modified to meet the special requirements of integral - field spectroscopy , and complemented by a dedicated set of idl routines .",
    "data are dark - frame subtracted and flat - fielded .",
    "the position of each slitlet is measured from a set of standard sinfoni calibration data , measuring the position of an artificial point source .",
    "rectification along the spectral dimension and wavelength calibration are done before night sky subtraction to account for some spectral flexure between the frames .",
    "curvature is measured and removed using an arc lamp , before shifting the spectra to an absolute ( vacuum ) wavelength scale with reference to the oh lines in the data . to account for variations in the night sky emission , we normalize the sky frame to the average of the object frame separately for each wavelength before sky subtraction , correcting for residuals of the background subtraction and uncertainties in the flux calibration by subsequently subtracting the ( empty sky ) background separately from each wavelength plane .",
    "these data reduction procedures have fewer interpolations and are optimized for faint , extended , low surface brightness objects compared to the sinfoni pipeline which obviously must be capable of reducing a much wider variety of objects .",
    "overall , we expect that these differences lead to more robust data compared to previous reductions but overall the results are largely consistent .",
    "the three - dimensional data are then reconstructed and spatially aligned using the telescope offsets as recorded in the header within the same sequence of dithered exposures ( about one hour of exposure ) , and by cross - correlating the line images from the combined data in each sequence , to eliminate relative offsets between different sequences .",
    "telluric correction is applied to each final cube .",
    "flux scales are obtained from standard star observations taken every hour at similar position and air mass as the source .",
    "we also used the standard stars to monitor the seeing during observations , and we find an effective seeing in the combined cubes of typically fwhm @xmath26@xmath3@xmath27 .",
    "the spectral resolution was measured from night - sky lines and is fwhm@xmath0 115 and 150 km s@xmath13 in the k and h - bands , respectively , for the 250 mas pixel scale ( `` mas '' is milli - arcseconds ) .",

    "in this section , we will discuss the emission line properties of our sample of galaxies such as surface brightnesses , the relationship between the velocity dispersion and surface brightness , and the impact of `` beam smearing '' .",

    "we refer the reader to @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite for a discussion of the overall kinematic properties of the galaxies in our sample .",
    "one of the most remarkable , but so far little discussed , observational findings of z@xmath20 galaxies studied with ifus are their high emission line surface brightnesses . in our sample",
    "we measure h@xmath1 surface brightnesses of @xmath010@xmath29 erg cm@xmath16 s@xmath13 arcsec@xmath16 ( fig .  [",
    "fig : sbharadius ] ) .",
    "the data were smoothed by 3@xmath313 pixels , i.e. , averaged in areas of size @xmath32@xmath31@xmath32 , which is appropriate since the spatial resolution is typically @xmath0 @xmath26-@xmath33 or @xmath04@xmath35 pixels . correcting for cosmological surface brightness dimming",
    ", this corresponds to a typical rest - frame surface brightness of 10@xmath34 erg cm@xmath16 s@xmath13@xmath35 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : hasbsigma ] ) .",
    "this represents a lower limit to the highest intensity regions , due to the `` beam smearing '' effect of the low spatial resolution of our data .",
    "in fact , for two of the galaxies , we can further quantify the effect of beam smearing on both the surface brightness distribution and line widths .",
    "for bzk-15504 and zc782941 , where we have both adaptive optics assisted and seeing limited observations , we find that the offset in surface brightness between both sets of observations is typically more than a factor of 3 ( fig .  [ fig : aohasbsigma ] ) .",
    "this factor is similar to the ratio of the area of the point spread function in both sets ( the full width half maximum of the seeing disk is typically about @xmath26 for the seeing limited data versus about @xmath36 in the ao assisted data ) , suggesting that the star - forming clumps are at best marginally resolved in either data set .",
    "much of the structure must be smaller than about 2 kpc , the physical resolution of our highest resolution data .",
    "moreover , this implies that all of the measured surface brightnesses of the most intense h@xmath1 emission regions are under - estimated , even in the ao - assisted observations .",
    "an h@xmath1 surface brightness comparison between galaxies in the local and distant universe illustrates the exceptional nature of the galaxies in our sample .",
    "galaxies that reach the highest surface brightnesses we observe and over similar physical scales do not exist at low redshift . in a study of 84 virgo cluster and isolated spiral galaxies ,",
    "many galaxies reach surface brightness levels at the low end of what we have observed at high redshift ( @xmath37 erg cm@xmath16 arcsec@xmath16 ) but only in their nuclei and on scales about or less than 1  kpc @xcite .",
    "local starburst galaxies can reach higher surface brightnesses ( but not as high as our peak surface brightnesses , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) but again only in regions that are nuclear or circum - nuclear with sizes @xmath38 1 kpc ( and well within the  turn - over  radius of the rotation curve ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . even in the more extreme starburst sample of @xcite ,",
    "only a handful of galaxies reach surface brightnesses sufficient to be observed at z@xmath02 ( such as m82 ) . at high redshift , h@xmath1",
    "surface brightnesses as extreme as those found only in the nuclei of nearby galaxies on small scales are found over significantly larger isophotal radii of order 10 - 20 kpc and are generally more extreme .",
    "although our comparison includes some of the most powerful and intense starbursts in the local universe , they generally do not reach sufficiently high surface brightnesses over large enough areas to correspond to any of the galaxies in our distant galaxy sample .",
    "moreover , at the 4@xmath35 kpc resolution of our seeing limited high - redshift data , none of the local starbursts would reach these maxima in the surface brightnesses that are observed due to the heavy spatial smoothing and dilution by regions with lower surface brightness .",
    "this lack of correspondence renders any simple analogy between `` ordinary '' quiescently star - forming spiral galaxies in the local universe and galaxies at z@xmath02 questionable .",
    "possible significant differences include the distribution of mass in various phases of the ism , of density , of star - formation intensity , of gas fraction , and many more .",
    "moreover , this lack implies that we can not only study the kinematics of z@xmath02 galaxies without investigating the nature of the physical processes that power their high surface brightness line emission , and the impact such a finding has on their kinematics and overall gas physics .      to elucidate the underlying physical cause of the high h@xmath1 surface brightness of our galaxies , we searched for correlations with other parameters .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sbharadius ] , [ fig : hasbsigma ] , and [ fig : aohasbsigma ] , we find that both the h@xmath1 surface brightness and h@xmath1 velocity dispersion decline with radius .",
    "we generally do not find a substantial increase in line widths when comparing the seeing - limited data with data taken with the adaptive optics system , although as expected , we observe higher h@xmath1 surface brightness in some regions ( fig .  [",
    "fig : aohasbsigma ] ) . thus beam smearing does have a tendency to lower the observed surface brightness suggesting that most of the structure within these galaxies is not resolved .",
    "however , beam smearing is worrying in that the trends we observe will obviously be influenced by our poor resolution .",
    "we must take care in determining what the true impact of our poor resolution might actually be on the distribution and kinematics of the emission line gas .",
    "we observe the trends with h@xmath1 surface brightness over physical scales that are @xmath06@xmath31 larger than the spatial resolution of our data . to investigate explicitly whether this may be an artifact due to low spatial resolution we constructed several simple models that have bright central point sources with broad lines .",
    "such models would correspond to a bright agn or concentration of mass increasing the velocity dispersion in the centers of these galaxies .",
    "although this may appear unphysical , since we do not see bright point sources , it will help to investigate , for example , the effects of a narrow - line agn .",
    "our toy models ( not shown ) do not reproduce the observed trends , which implies it is very difficult to contrive a realistic situation where only the poor resolution of our data would lead to the trends we observe between surface brightness and radius .    could beam smearing induce an apparent relationship between line width and surface brightness ?",
    "could this trend be related to distant galaxies having more complex light profiles ? to understand the impact of beam smearing and complex light profiles of these galaxies on our analysis , we constructed simulated data cubes using the light distributions observed in nicmos h - band images of five galaxies in our sample ( fig .",
    "[ fig : nicmosimages ] ) .",
    "we assumed that the line emission follows the distribution of the h - band flux , that the velocity dispersion is 25 km s@xmath13 independent of position or radius @xcite , and that the rotation curves and peak velocities are those from @xcite .",
    "we did not include noise in this display as it results in a scatter plot about the assumed constant velocity dispersion , masking the trend of some pixels to reach high dispersions ( which we think is extremely important to make obvious ) .",
    "thus for clarity , we do not show a plot of our analysis with noise .    as we can see in fig .",
    "[ fig : toyhasbsigma ] , assuming typical velocity dispersions seen in local disk galaxies and light distributions of distant galaxies and smoothing them to our resolutions does not reproduce the data ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we do see that there are some regions of high dispersion , but this makes up a small number of pixels whereas a great majority of the regions , regardless of their relative surface brightness have dispersions similar to what we initially assumed ( i.e. , 25 km s@xmath13 ) .",
    "this , coupled with the lack of increase in the dispersions when comparing our seeing limited data with that taken using adaptive optics , suggests that beam smearing , while obviously playing a role in these trends , does not cause these trends .",
    "given the high star - formation rates @xcite and emission line surface brightnesses in these galaxies , we hypothesize that the high surface brightnesses and relationship between velocity dispersion and surface brightness in h@xmath1 , may be explained by postulating that the intense star formation is pressure - driven by mechanical energy input from the starburst itself and self - gravity of gas at high surface densities . in this sense , the star formation will be self - regulated .",
    "we will argue that these systems may be analogous to nearby starburst galaxies , such as m82 , except that at high redshift , the intense star formation and strong mechanical energy injection must act over significantly larger areas ( 10 - 20 kpc compared to a few kpc , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but with a similar local surface brightness and similarly high pressures . however , this is not the only possibility and we will explicitly address different scenarios to investigate whether these relationship may be generated by cosmological gas accretion or gravitationally unstable disks .",
    "some of our main arguments will rely on the detection of nebular emission lines like [ nii]@xmath96583 , [ sii]@xmath9@xmath96716,6731 or [ oi]@xmath96300 , which are relatively faint in high - redshift galaxies .",
    "we detected all of these lines in only one galaxy , while we detect all but [ oi]@xmath96300 in 5 others .",
    "where one of the lines is undetected or severely affected by a telluric night sky line , we give upper limits , provided that they are physically meaningful . for a subsample of 5 targets , our data include h@xmath19 and [ oiii]@xmath214959,5007 , which fall into the near - infrared h - band for redshifts z@xmath392 .",
    "these data sets have not been discussed previously in the literature .",
    "we list the integrated emission line properties of these galaxies in table 1 .",
    "as the h - band data are rather shallow relative to the k - band , we typically detect only the highest surface brightness regions ( and likely also regions of relatively low extinction ) .",
    "we extracted emission line ratios from matched apertures in the h and k band data sets , covering the areas where line emission is detected in the h band .",
    "we use the measured , and not the extinction corrected line fluxes for the emission line diagnostics .",
    "this adds only a minor uncertainty , given the relatively low signal - to - noise ratio of our data , low luminosities of the low - ionization lines , and the fact that we will only use ratios of lines with very similar rest - frame wavelengths .",
    "we estimated extinctions for the four objects with measured h@xmath1 and h@xmath19 fluxes ( table 2 ) .",
    "h@xmath19 in q2346-bx482 , which would have been a fifth galaxy with a h@xmath19 flux and extinction estimate , and the emission in the north of q2343-bx389 are severely affected by night sky lines ( so the measurement is only for the southern part of the galaxy ) , and for three other galaxies we identified the areas with reasonably bright h@xmath19 emission , and extracted h@xmath1 from the same aperture ( table 2 ) . for a galactic extinction law , and an intrinsic balmer ratio of f@xmath40 /f@xmath41 @xmath22.86 , we find extinctions in the range of a@xmath42 1@xmath32 magnitudes .",
    "this corresponds to correction factors of about 2@xmath35 between observed and intrinsic h@xmath1 luminosities .",
    "we will neglect extinction in much of our subsequent discussion , but caution that intrinsic values are strict lower limits and may have been underestimated by factors of a few .",
    "the line ratio of the  doublet , @xmath96716/@xmath96731 , is density - sensitive in the range of @xmath43 cm@xmath23 .",
    "these lines are relatively faint , but we have robustly detected and spectrally resolved this doublet in six galaxies in our sample , at signal - to - noise ratios @xmath45 .",
    "we are thus able to measure electron densities directly , and to estimate the pressure in the partially ionized zones within the interstellar medium .",
    "densities listed in table  [ table : sii ] are in the range @xmath0 100@xmath31000 cm@xmath23 .",
    "such values are typical , if not higher , than densities in the starburst regions of galaxies in the local universe ( such as m82 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and suggest thermal pressures of about 10@xmath46 dyne cm@xmath16 , i.e. , several orders of magnitude higher than in the interstellar medium in normal nearby galaxies .",
    "similar pressures are found for the z@xmath22.6 submillimeter galaxy smmj14011 + 0252 @xcite .",
    "we will argue below that the ambient medium of our galaxies is highly pressurized , and show that these estimates are also consistent with pressures derived directly from photoionization models .",
    "the high pressures may also explain another remarkable feature of our galaxies , namely their overall low ratios of low - ionization lines like @xmath216716,6731 and @xmath96583 compared to the high h@xmath1 luminosities . while the recombination lines increase linearly with increasing density and ionization parameter , the ratio of @xmath216716,6731 will decline with increasing ionization parameter ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "since the gas with the highest surface brightness also has a declining ratio , measuring the density from the  lines becomes more difficult as the surface brightness increases .",
    "thus , it may not be surprising that we obtained measurements at sufficiently high signal - to - noise only for parts of our sample .",
    "this may also affect other diagnostic line ratios .",
    "larger samples of high - redshift galaxies with deep spectroscopy of a comprehensive set of faint , diagnostic lines will help to secure these findings .",

    "it should be noted that all of these diagnostics are to a large degree empirical and developed for galaxies at low redshift , and that different evolutionary stages may influence the emission line diagnostics in a rather subtle way . as already stated by @xcite ,",
    "many z@xmath20 galaxies are shifted towards higher low - ionization line ratios relative to the low - redshift relationships .",
    "@xcite argued by analogy with a subsample of local galaxies from the sdss that this may be a result of higher pressures and higher ionization in high redshift galaxies .    however , this is not the only effect we may expect to take place . at low redshift ,",
    "luminous agns reside predominantly in relatively massive galaxies which have comparably high ( @xmath47solar ) metallicities . at high redshift ,",
    "this is not necessarily the case .",

    "they find that the metallicity - sensitive /h@xmath1 ratio will be shifted towards lower values for agn with low - metallicity narrow line regions .",
    "seyfert galaxies and qsos have ratios of [ oiii]/h@xmath19 that are higher than those of hii regions and star - forming galaxies in such diagrams .",
    "since the ratio of , for example , [ oiii]/h@xmath19 is not strongly affected by lower the metallicity , the position of low - metallicity agn in ionization diagrams may lie above the locus occupied by hii regions .",
    "we illustrate this effect by showing the position of the low - redshift , low - metallicity agn of @xcite in the same diagram .",
    "interestingly , most optically or uv - selected starbursts fall very close to the region spanned by the @xcite sample .",
    "this is not to say that these will be low - metallicity agn , in particular , since the observed strong starbursts will create high - ionization , high - pressure environments , which will shift the galaxies towards the agn part of the diagram @xcite .",

    "it is also important to note that bzk-15504 also has one of the highest h@xmath1 surface brightnesses in our sample .",

    "the h@xmath19 luminosity of bzk-15504 would suggest a narrow line region size of a few to 10 kpc ( this is without extinction correction ) .",
    "interestingly , this is approximately the size of the emission line nebulae observed in h@xmath1 and [ oiii ] .",
    "thus , in agreement with other arguments , there is evidence that the extended emission line region is nothing more than a narrow line region around a powerful qso with line widths that are , by analogy with local agn , influenced , perhaps dominated , by other processes .",
    "the surface brightness in our sample is both very high , and a function of radius , velocity dispersion , and low ionization line emission ratio ( i.e. , /h@xmath1 ) .",
    "this is in sharp contrast to what is observed for spiral galaxies in the local universe where the velocity dispersion is roughly constant as the surface brightness declines exponentially . with the local trends in mind , we hypothesize that the trends seen in the distant galaxy data can be explained by self - regulated star formation whereby the intense star formation is pressure driven by the gas motions induced by the star formation itself .",
    "we attempt to show that essentially , these systems are analogous to the nearby starburst galaxies , such as m82 ( and regulated perhaps in the same way as the ism of the milky way ) with an overall similar surface brightness and similarly high pressure , but with their star formation occurring over a much larger area .      in fig .",
    "[ fig : niihasbha ] , we show the relationship between the emission line ratio /h@xmath1 and the surface brightness of h@xmath1 .",
    "an obvious way to understand such a relationship , in addition to the high h@xmath1 intensity , is through the gas pressure in the cloud or cloud interfaces that gives rise to the recombination line emission .    to test this hypothesis we ran some simple photoionization models using the code cloudy .",

    "* ) . however , the exact age is not very important as long as it is sufficiently long for the spectral energy distribution , especially in the uv , to reach an equilibrium shape .",
    "it is thus appropriate for ages greater than about a few 10s myrs and constant star - formation rate .",
    "we assumed a constant density slab with ionization parameters ranging from about log u=@xmath35 to @xmath31 , initial densities log n=1 , 2 , and 3 , and ism metallicities and grain depletion which are kept constant for all calculations .",
    "these attempts at modeling are not intended to be exhaustive but illustrative . to gauge the impact of the ionization of the modeled cloud , we ran these calculations for two total column densities , 10@xmath70 and 10@xmath71 cm@xmath16 .",

    "[ fig : niihasbha ] .",
    "we can see that the range of /h@xmath1 and surface brightness can be explained by a combination of column density , volume densities , and moderately diffuse radiation fields .",
    "obviously , such simple assumptions are not going to `` fit '' the data in any sense of the word , but show that the area of line ratio - surface brightness space covered by the data can be explained by a combination of these parameters , with each galaxy exhibiting some range in each of these .",
    "surface brightness is linearly proportional to the density and ionization parameter , while the line ratio depends on roughly one over the square root of the ionization parameter for the range of ionization necessary to explain the line ratios .",

    "@xcite suggest that the most likely explanation for this is higher density ( pressure ) and that the escape fraction may be higher in the star - forming regions implying that the nebulae are at least partially density bounded .",

    "the photoionization models would predict @xmath95007/h@xmath19 of about 0.5 - 2.0 . indeed , not considering bzk-15504 , which is powered by a qso , the other galaxies show ratios consistent with the high ionization line ratios and again amplifying the idea that these nebula have increased density compared to nearby galaxies as observed by @xcite .",
    "we have argued that the ism of these distant galaxies is under high pressure and that this high pressure could be induced by the intense star formation within these systems .",

    "such a hypothesis nicely explains some of the unusual features in these distant star - forming galaxies such as their high surface brightnesses in the recombination line(s ) ( which makes them observable in the first place ) , the low ionization line ratios , the ratio of the  lines ( suggestive of high densities ) , and the trend for more intense star formation to lead to broader lines .",
    "we observe low ratios ( @xmath02 - 4 ) of v/@xmath4 in the extended line emitting regions of our objects , much lower than the ratio of @xmath010 generally observed in local and intermediate redshift disk galaxies , and this appears to be driven mainly by unusually high velocity dispersions , not low velocity shears .    in principle , the high velocity dispersions observed in the ionized gas lines are likely not representative of the turbulence in the whole star - forming ism .",
    "nevertheless , the energy injection necessary to sustain the high velocity dispersions observed in the ionized gas should affect the atomic and molecular phases ( although if it is a turbulent cascade , with energy injection on large scales , the velocity dispersion will likely be lower in denser gas but the @xmath80 will be the same ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . indeed , high dispersions in the gas out of which stars form is suggested by the large sizes and masses of high - redshift star - forming regions ( giant clumps equaling the jeans mass , * ? ? ? * ) .",

    "what is the power source of the high velocity dispersions that are observed , and that should affect the whole ism of high - redshift galaxies ?",

    "our low spatial resolution in the rest - frame of the galaxies does not allow us to cleanly separate these possible sources of the observed broad line emission .",
    "in fact , @xcite as well as our astrophysical reasoning below imply that bulk motion and turbulence are intricately related in some of the scenarios , in the sense that bulk motion will inject kinetic energy into the system which will then be dissipated through turbulence .",
    "however , carefully examining the total energy contained within the emission line gas may help us constrain the mechanism responsible for its characteristics .",
    "we first consider the energy dissipated within the turbulence and whether or not it is consistent with cosmological accretion of gas .",
    "the violent motions observed in these distant galaxies are highly supersonic given the densities derived previously for the optical emission line gas and the turbulence generated , compressible . to estimate",

    "although , the validity of this energy dissipation estimate on galaxy scales has yet to be verified , it is useful to give an order - of - magnitude estimate of the energy injection rate necessary to sustain the motions we observe .",
    "the parameters necessary to estimate the energy dissipation rate of compressible turbulence span a wide range of values .",
    "for example , the velocity dispersions observed in the galaxies range from about @xmath8840 km s@xmath13 , in the outer regions , to about 250 km s@xmath13 in the inner , circum - nuclear regions ( fig .",
    "[ fig : hasbsigma ] ) .",
    "the typical velocity dispersion is of - order @xmath0100 - 150 km s@xmath13 .",
    "the driving scale is particularly difficult to estimate since the driving mechanisms likely operate over a wide range of scales ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "for example , if the largest scale driving mechanism was the cosmological accretion of gas , we would expect this scale to be large @xcite approximately that of the thickness of the disk .",
    "alternatively , if the driving mechanism is star - formation , the size of the largest star - forming regions or associations in the galaxies might be the appropriate scale .",
    "the clumps seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : nicmosimages ] are approximately 100s of parsecs to kpc in diameter . since the driving wavenumber is inversely proportional to the driving length , assuming a small scale for the driving length would tend to increase the energy dissipated through turbulence .",

    "we argued above that self - gravity may be an important source of turbulence at high redshift , but does not seem sufficient to generate the observed velocity dispersions ( see also fig .",

    "this and the relationship between h@xmath1 surface brightness and velocity dispersion suggests that the star formation within the galaxies is powering the dynamics of the emission line gas .",
    "if the star formation is indeed inducing the high pressures , then this is what would be expected . on purely dimensional grounds ,",
    "if the energy output from young stars is controlling the dynamics of the emission line gas , we would expect , that @xmath4 , the velocity dispersion , would be proportional to the square root of the energy injection rate , de@xmath107/dt , due to stars . if the coupling efficiency of the mechanical energy output of the star formation does not depend on radius ,",
    "then the energy injection rate is simply proportional to the star - formation rate . in this case of course , the energy injection per unit area is proportional to the star - formation intensity .",
    "this hypothesis is equivalent to conserving ( with some efficiency ) the mechanical energy output of the star - formation within the ism of the galaxy and that the velocities of the warm ionized gas trace this energy injection rate .    in fig .",

    "this comes from modeling the ism with a coupling efficiency of 25% to the supernova energy from disk star formation .",
    "using these two values for the scaling relation yields the bottom two curves in fig .",

    "we emphasize that the axis of abscissa is a simple scaling between h@xmath1 surface brightness and the star - formation rate which was made assuming a relationship between star - formation rate and h@xmath1 luminosity @xcite .",
    "we have not taken into account the effect of extinction in making this scaling .",
    "if the galaxies for which we have h@xmath19 measurements for are representative of our entire sample .",
    "this would increase the star - formation intensities by a factor of a few ( table 2 ) .",
    "while such a toy model is not a particularly good fit , especially at the highest star - formation intensities , it has the virtue of having no free parameters .",
    "it is just a simple scaling based on the mw and other nearby galaxies .",
    "although we put this in context of the modeling done by @xcite , we could as well have simply used the mw scaling of star - formation intensity and velocity dispersion .",
    "obviously , the true nature of the interstellar media of these distant galaxies can not be so simple as the energy injection argument presented here .",
    "this argument simply shows that the star formation in the galaxies themselves is likely controlling the dynamics of the emission line gas .",

    "since the numbers are similar , we suggest that the star - formation is powerful enough to maintain the turbulent and bulk motions observed .",
    "having now argued that the star formation is injecting energy into the ism of these galaxies and is sufficient to explain the overall dynamics of the gas and to support dissipation through turbulence , can we make a plausible model for how the clouds might be accelerated ?",
    "@xcite and @xcite have developed both analytic models and simulations for clouds accelerated in a blast wave .",
    "such a blast wave is expected to be generated by the intense star formation observed in our sample of galaxies . as the blast wave passes it shock heats the cloud and eventually destroys it through kelvin - helmholtz and rayleigh - taylor instabilities .    in this scenario ,",
    "the turbulence is driven by large scale bulk motions induced by energy injection ",
    "blast waves generated by intense star - formation and other processes  over a wide range of scales , which then cascades into the denser gas and redistributes the energy over all scales in the medium finally dissipating mainly on the smallest scales ( * ? ? ?",

    "the nature of turbulence emphasizes the importance of both bulk and random motions and estimating energy dissipation rates based on turbulence arguments while estimating velocities based on bulk motion arguments are thus appropriate .",
    "@xcite have found relatively simple analytic approximations that can capture the destruction time of clouds with a range of properties like contrast with the inter - cloud material , mach number of the blast wave , etc . although there is a problem with simply using these formulae with the parameters from the photoionization calculations",
    "because those are aimed at providing the emission lines without consideration of the shock heating in the first place , we envision a scenario where shock heating , despite the intense energy input from the supernova and stellar winds , is only a small fraction of the total energy output of the star formation . for our zeroth order model of star formation proceeding for 10@xmath68 years , we find that this condition is clearly satisfied @xcite .",
    "thus we expect the emission lines to be dominated by the ionizing energy output from massive stars and not by the shock heating .",
    "the clouds could therefore be thought of as the ones that have yet to be destroyed or are simply the surfaces of sheets and filaments that will get eventually or are now being run over by the blast waves into the ism .",

    "does the star formation actually generate blast waves of sufficient energy to accelerate the clouds to the observed velocities ?",
    "the total mass ejected by supernovae and stellar winds in the star formation process , @xmath124 can be scaled as @xmath125 , where @xmath19 is the fraction of the total ejected mass that is entrained or mass loaded in the winds .",
    "simple conservation arguments suggest the terminal velocity of the outflow is v@xmath126=@xmath127 km s@xmath13 , where @xmath110 is the thermalization efficiency of the starburst mechanical energy ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "if we assume mass loading rates of 1 - 10 , then the blast wave speed is about 1000 - 2000 km s@xmath13 .",
    "similarly , to first order the density of the blast wave is proportional to @xmath128 , which would suggest densities of - order 10@xmath23 cm@xmath23 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "such low densities and high velocities meet the general criteria of being a blast wave , which is highly supersonic for all of the densities in the ism and should be very efficient in destroying clouds as it passes through the ism .",
    "the modeling of the emission line gas in these galaxies suggest parameters for the clouds like density and column density , and assuming the ism surrounding the pre - blast is like that typical of the ism in local galaxies , implies log @xmath129=@xmath33 to 0 , log @xmath130=1 to 3 cm@xmath23 , r@xmath131=0.1 - 10 pc . using these values for the clouds , the initial conditions for the ism , and the blast wave formulation argued for previously as input to the simple cloud acceleration models ,",
    "we find that the clouds could be accelerated up to 100 to a few 100 km s@xmath13 before being destroyed .",
    "thus it appears that at least in principle , the velocities of the outflows generated by intense star formation appear able to induce velocities like those observed .",
    "ultimately , following the above reasoning , star formation may give rise to the observed line widths through a combination of bulk and turbulent motion .",
    "this would also help resolve an apparent inconsistency in our above arguments .",
    "if turbulent motions dominate the observed velocity dispersions , we may expect the relationship between the dispersion and star - formation intensity of the form , @xmath4=(@xmath132)@xmath133 ( ignoring the relationship between star - formation intensity and gas surface density which would tend to flatten this relationship ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : sfisigma ] , we show this relationship based on eqn .",

    "we have ignored the increase in the gas surface density with star - formation ( the schmidt - kennicutt relation ) . while this relationship does explain the overall trend in the data , data for individual galaxies are steeper than @xmath4=(@xmath108)@xmath133 and in better agreement with @xmath4=(@xmath108)@xmath109 .",

    "of course this requires efficient conversion of bulk motions into turbulent energy which is apparently the case @xcite .",
    "the complexity of the processes that control the dynamics and distribution of its various phases suggest that no simple scaling like @xmath4=(@xmath108)@xmath109 can provide an ultimate understanding of the ism .",
    "however , it does suggest that the ism of these distant galaxies is controlled by the intense energy output of the star - formation within them .",
    "not surprising , but something that needed to be investigated and certainly needs further study .",
    "it appears that it is the intense star formation ( or perhaps to some extent and in some cases the agn ) that is controlling the properties of the emission line gas within these galaxies .",
    "given that we have found that the star formation has sufficient mechanical energy output in its own right to explain the characteristics of the emission line gas , it is unclear whether the gas is telling us much about the underlying mass distribution of these galaxies or their origins .",
    "for example , @xcite have argued that high central velocity dispersions require mass concentrations that are consistent with bulges .",
    "we can now explain this using the intense mechanical energy output of massive stars ( with a non - negligable contribution from agn in some cases like bzk-15504 ) and thus the velocity dispersions do not appear to be a unique tracer of the underlying gravitational potential .",
    "similarly , it is plausible that variations in the physical conditions of the gas will lead to variation in the line ratios ( see discussion in   [ subsec : sbniioverha ] and fig .  [",

    "although these variations do not appear sufficient to significantly affect the metallicity estimates based on integrated spectra ( as argued by * ? ? ?",

    "we do not as yet have a comprehensive theory of star formation or a complete understanding of all the processes that may limit both the efficiency and the rate at which stars can form .",
    "global star - formation laws or thresholds are those that describe the gross characteristics of star formation on large scales and over dynamical times of galaxies .",
    "several possibilities for explaining the global characteristics of star formation have been suggested : cloud - cloud collisions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "models such as cloud - cloud collisions and pressure and turbulence regulated ism seem particularly appropriate in understanding the role of self - regulation in intense star - formation .",
    "however , of particular interest in distant galaxies , and something that we can directly comment on given our results , are the questions of the star - formation efficiency and how does intense star - formation affect the structural properties of distant galaxies .",
    "recently , @xcite investigated whether or not cosmological gas accretion can sustain the star - formation rate of distant galaxies .",
    "galaxies with high star formation rates as observed here require the star - formation rate to be close to the accretion rate of gas in this type of model .",
    "this , on the face of it , requires the gas infall time scale and the star - formation time scale to be close to equal which then implies that the star - formation efficiency is high .",
    "our results suggest that the star - formation intensity , gas pressure , and velocity dispersions in @xmath136 star - forming galaxies are similar or higher than those in the most intense starbursting regions at @xmath137 .",
    "the efficiency of star - formation in local spirals is about a few percent , but can reach @xmath138% in starburst regions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    ", we would infer efficiencies of at least 10% in our z@xmath02 galaxies .",
    "as mentioned previously , we do not have a comprehensive theory of star formation .",
    "however , it has been suggested that there is a power - law dependence of the star formation rate on the total column density @xcite .",
    "such a relationship implies that star - formation occurs on a dynamical time scale averaged over a large area .",
    "@xcite used this dependency to argue that this would lead to a star - formation law of the form , @xmath139 , where @xmath140 is the star - formation efficiency and @xmath141 is a dynamical rate for the conversion of gas into dense , star - forming cloud cores .",
    "interestingly , @xcite argue that this does not imply that gravitational forces are directly involved but that this dynamical rate of conversion is about equal to the turbulence crossing rate ( which is also argued to be the inverse of the collapse time with modest over - pressures ) . comparing the inverse of the relative crossing times of turbulence of our sample and local galaxies , @xmath1422@xmath35 for @xmath143=100@xmath3200 km s@xmath13 and",
    "l@xmath01 kpc @xcite in the distant galaxies and @xmath143=20@xmath325 km s@xmath13 and l@xmath0500 pc in local disks @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the conversion efficiency of gas into dense star - forming cloud cores is higher in our sample of galaxies than for local disks .",
    "thus the apparent efficiency of star - formation in our z@xmath02 galaxies should be higher than in nearby disk galaxies , where by `` apparent '' we mean the product , @xmath144 .",
    "but it is important to note that the star - formation efficiency itself , @xmath140 , can remain constant . on the other hand",
    "the efficiency can hardly exceed , say , 30% , since the star formation efficiency at the scale of individual cores is about 50% @xcite and the efficiency in molecular clouds is necessarily somewhat lower @xcite .",
    "our observations thus suggest `` apparent '' star - formation efficiencies between 10 and 30% , not just in a nuclear region but over the whole disk , which is globally starbursting and highly turbulent .",
    "an increase in the apparent efficiency of star - formation can be understood with relation to the likely high surface density of gas in these galaxies .",
    "a high gas surface density is supported by both the intense star - formation ( through the schmidt - kennicutt relation ) and by the high pressures inferred from the optical emission line gas . if this efficiency is related to the inverse of the gas consumption time and the schmidt - kennicutt relation , then the gas suface density divided by the star - formation intensity , the gas consumption time would be , @xmath145  a decreasing function of the gas density . thus finding a high apparent efficiency of star - formation is a natural consequence of having faster dynamical processes such as faster collapse of gas due to high pressures , faster and greater turbulent compression , and stronger influence of self - gravity . within this framework , it is easy to understand how the galaxies could be clumpy and highly unstable against rapid and intense star - formation .",
    "our results also have implications for the `` clumpy disk hypothesis '' @xcite , whereby galaxy evolution is hypothesized to be driven by internal clump formation @xcite .",
    "our results suggest that the clumpy disk model alone can not explain the high dispersions observed and that an additional energy source is needed . gravity can play a crucial role , generating the high masses observed in the clumps @xcite , but we have argued that star - formation must be an important source of energy too .",
    "the intense star - formation is a mechanism whereby further clump formation may be stimulated by maintaining the high dispersions .",
    "@xcite conclude that the observations of the `` skywalker '' in the udf ( udf6462 ) and that the peculiar velocities observed are consistent with a clumpy disk .",
    "peculiar clump motions , typically around 50 km  s@xmath13 @xcite , are likely masked by the turbulence and bulk velocities generated in the optical emission line gas by the intense star - formation .",
    "this implies that clump masses are difficult to infer from the dispersions of their optical emission line gas .",
    "furthermore , while the clumpy disk model is certainly viable for a subset of the observed galaxies , it is also likely that the mechanical output from the intense star - formation within the clumps should not be ignored either and may have a profound influence on the evolution of the clumps .",
    "@xcite suggested that the bulges in local spiral galaxies form through the dynamical evolution of massive clumps of stars in high redshift galaxies .",
    "this model was further investigated by @xcite : large massive clumps migrate towards the disk center , and coalesce into a slowly - rotating bulge .",
    "the limited observations available may support this picture @xcite .",
    "could the high efficiency of star formation in our observations of z@xmath02 clumpy galaxies question this model ?",
    "vigorous energy injection from intense star formation may disrupt the clumps just like this process disrupts the star - forming clouds in low redshift galaxies . actually , if the stars are forming in a higher density medium , which our observations may suggest , the clumps may be more tightly bound and more difficult to destroy with the mechanical energy output from massive stars ( even with strong feedback from intense star formation , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ". therefore , it is likely that the energy output affects mainly the lower - density , inter - clump gas , but not the most massive clumps .",
    "@xcite have independently argued that star - formation feedback could regulate the bulge growth , but does not prevent this bulge - forming mechanism from taking place in high redshift galaxies .",
    "finally , we have argued that the emission line ratios for bzk-15504 are consistent with it harboring an agn , and that this agn is likely growing very rapidly . in this situation ,",

    "<S> we analyze the physical conditions in the interstellar gas of 11 actively star - forming galaxies at z@xmath02 , based on integral - field spectroscopy from the eso - vlt and hst / nicmos imaging . </S>",
    "<S> we concentrate on the high h@xmath1 surface brightnesses , large line widths , line ratios and the clumpy nature of these galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> we show that photoionization calculations and emission line diagnostics imply gas pressures and densities that are similar to the most intense nearby star - forming regions at z=0 but over much larger scales ( 10 - 20 kpc ) . a relationship between surface brightness and velocity dispersion </S>",
    "<S> can be explained through simple energy injection arguments and a scaling set by nearby galaxies with no free parameters . </S>",
    "<S> the high velocity dispersions are a natural consequence of intense star formation thus regions of high velocity dispersion are not evidence for mass concentrations such as bulges or rings . </S>",
    "<S> external mechanisms like cosmological gas accretion generally do not have enough energy to sustain the high velocity dispersions . in some cases </S>",
    "<S> , the high pressures and low gas metallicites may make it difficult to robustly distinguish between agn ionization cones and star formation , as we show for bzk-15504 at z@xmath22.38 . </S>",
    "<S> we construct a picture where the early stages of galaxy evolution are driven by self - gravity which powers strong turbulence until the velocity dispersion is high . then massive , dense , gas - rich clumps collapse , triggering star formation with high efficiencies and intensities as observed . at this stage , </S>",
    "<S> the intense star formation is likely self - regulated by the mechanical energy output of massive stars . </S>"
