    "@xmath1 emission is the main tracer of the molecular gas in our galaxy as well as in external galaxies  ( see _ e.g. _ * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "yet , this co emission is ambiguous .",
    "indeed , this co emission is usually associated to cold ( 10 - 20@xmath2 ) , dense ( @xmath3 ) , strongly uv - shielded , molecular gas ( carbon atoms are mostly locked in co ) . however , it became more and more obvious over the last decade  @xcite that a large fraction of the co emission in our galaxy comes from warm ( 50 - 100@xmath2 ) , low density ( 100 - 500@xmath4 ) , weakly uv - shielded , diffuse gas ( carbon atoms are mostly locked in @xmath5 ) .",
    "moreover , at the beginning of the history of the @xmath0 factor , @xcite noted that diffuse and dense gas have similar factor .",
    "for instance , @xmath6 , @xmath7 toward @xmath8oph , a prototypical diffuse line of sight , and @xmath9 , @xmath10 toward ori a , a prototypical dense gas line of sight .",
    "this triggers the question of the mean value of the @xmath0 factor in diffuse gas  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* for details see ) .",
    "optical depth from @xcite and this work versus the total line of sight reddening from @xcite . * middle , bottom : * total hydrogen column density versus integrated @xmath11 optical depth for the sources studied by @xcite . *",
    "right : * co luminosity versus the total line of sight reddening from @xcite . ]",
    "we quantify the @xmath0 conversion factor in diffuse gas from a sample acquired over the last 20 years .",
    "it is made from the study of whole galactic lines of sight measured in absorption against extragalactic continuum background sources .",
    "there are two different groups of lines : either they have a low visual extinction @xmath13 when they are observed at high galactic latitude @xmath14 or when they lie in the galactic plane , their large total visual extinction @xmath15 can be divided in well separated velocity components , each one having @xmath16 ( see the left column of fig .  [",
    "fig : pety:1 ] for an example ) .",
    "hence , all the gas studied here is diffuse .",
    "indeed , the co column density per velocity component on any line of sight is low , typically @xmath17 , which implies that less than 7% of the carbon is locked in co.    the computation is then made in three steps .",
    "first , the total hydrogen column density is deduced from the @xmath18 reddening maps of  @xcite , using the standard relation  @xcite @xmath19 second , we estimate the atomic gas fraction via the @xmath11 absorption measurements by writing it as the product of two terms @xmath20 where the left term is directly measured from the data ( middle , top panel of fig .  [",
    "fig : pety:1 ] ) while the right term is calibrated from the careful measurements of @xcite ( middle , bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : pety:1 ] ) .",
    "this gives @xmath21 or @xmath22 , which implies a 30% overall uncertainty on the method . ] .",
    "the third step consists in the measures of the co emission luminosity , @xmath23 , along the line of sight ( right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : pety:1 ] ) .",
    "we note here that the high @xmath23 values @xmath24 arise from the accumulation of several low-@xmath25 components along the same galactic line of sight .",
    "moreover , co is not reliably detected at low @xmath18 @xmath26 .",
    "the corresponding lines of sight are not used in our estimation because the @xmath0 factor is used to estimate the molecular column density only from the co gas which is detected . in summary , we obtain @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 , which give @xmath30 , the same _ mean _ co luminosity per @xmath31 in diffuse and dense gas !",
    "to understand this result , we write @xmath32 where the @xmath33 ratio comes from the co chemistry while the @xmath34 comes from the radiative transfer through the cloud structure .    in diffuse gas , more than 90% of the carbon is locked in @xmath5 , which implies that @xmath35  @xcite . in addition , the gas is subthermally excited .",
    "large velocity gradient radiative transfer methods  @xcite thus show that 1 ) @xmath36 is large because of weak co excitation in warm gas ( 60 - 100@xmath2 ) , and 2 ) @xmath37 until the opacity is so large that the transition approaches thermalization .",
    "we thus obtain @xmath38  ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in dense gas ,",
    "all the carbon is locked in co , @xmath39 . as a consequence , @xmath12 = cst and @xmath37 .",
    "a constant @xmath0 factor thus implies that @xmath37 .",
    "we interpret this as a bulk effect in a turbulent medium , the medium is macroscopically optically thin because of the large velocity gradients due to turbulence .    in summary ,",
    "the change of chemistry from diffuse to dense gas is compensated by the inverse change of the radiative transfer , giving the same @xmath0 factor .",
    "as @xmath1 alone can not be used to discriminate between diffuse and dense gas , other tracers as molecules with higher dipole moments ( _ e.g. _ @xmath40 , cs , hcn ) are tried .",
    "however , they often are difficult to detect .",
    "we thus propose to use the co isotopologues , the ratio of the @xmath1 over the @xmath41 emission . indeed , @xmath42 in diffuse , warm gas because of the @xmath5 fractionation  ( _ e.g. _ * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while @xmath43 in dense , cold gas  ( _ e.g. _ * ? ? ?",
    "we here aim at estimating the co luminosity of the diffuse molecular gas perpendicular to the galactic plane from our absorption data for which the mean luminosity is @xmath44 .",
    "we assume that the gas is simply ordered in plane - parallel , stratified layers .",
    "the mean number of galactic half - width along integration path is then @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the latitude of each line of sight of our sample .",
    "we thus obtain @xmath47 .",
    "the co emission galactic survey of  @xcite gives a mean co brightness per kpc of @xmath48 at @xmath49 .",
    "assuming a single gaussian vertical distribution of dispersion 60@xmath50 , we obtain @xmath51 .",
    "this is a lower limit because we see large amount of co emission outside area mapped by the galactic surveys of the co emission ( mainly limited to the galactic plane ) .",
    "hence , a large fraction of the co luminosity measured in galactic surveys could come from diffuse gas .",
    "the coincidence between the values of the @xmath0 factor in diffuse and dense gas implies that the mass estimates computed with the standard value are correct .",
    "however , the underlying physical interpretation of the detected gas is very different .",
    "if the gas is dense : it will fill a small fraction of the interstellar volume ; it will be confined by ram or turbulent pressure ( if not gravitationally bound ) ; and it is on the verge of forming stars . if the gas is diffuse : it is a warmer , low pressure medium filling a large fraction of the interstellar volume ; it contributes more the mid - ir or pah emission ; and it is probably not gravitionally bound or about to form stars .",
