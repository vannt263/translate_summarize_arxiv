    "the non - linear inertial effects in the flows of conducting liquids may become negligible not only at low velocities but also in strong enough magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "numerical computation of such flows is still complicated by the fine and intricate meshing required to resolve the thin boundary and free shear layers that develop in complex geometries .",
    "owing to the linearity such flows can also be computed using the boundary integral equation ( bie ) techniques , which requires only the surface but no volume meshing .",
    "this is approach is well developed for stokes flows in classical hydrodynamics @xcite but not so in magnetohydrodynamics @xcite .",
    "the problem is the so - called fundamental solution , which is essential for the bie formulation and describes the flow due to a concentrated point - force .",
    "such a fundamental solution , which plays the same role as the coulomb s law in the electrostatics and is known as a stokeslet in the hydrodynamics @xcite , is still missing in the mhd .",
    "the aim of the present study is to fill in this gap .",
    "consider an unbounded flow of a viscous electrically conducting liquid in a homogeneous magnetic field @xmath0 the flow is due a body which may be either dragged through the liquid by a constant force @xmath1 or discharging a direct current @xmath2 which then interacts with the externally applied magnetic field .",
    "the interaction of the current with its own magnetic field is supposed to be negligible . sufficiently far away from the body",
    ", the flow is expected to be independent of the body size and shape , and determined only by the total force and the current .",
    "thus , @xmath1 and @xmath3 are assumed to be concentrated at the body location @xmath4 and the dirac delta function @xmath5 is used for their density distributions .",
    "the origin of the coordinate system is set at the body location so that @xmath6 and a simplified notation @xmath7 introduced . neglecting the non - linear inertial forces , which supposes either a creeping flow or a sufficiently strong magnetic field , the flow is governed by the linearised navier  stokes equation with the electromagnetic body term @xmath8 where the velocity @xmath9 is subject to the incompressibility constraint @xmath10",
    "the current obeys both the ohm s law for a moving medium @xmath11 and the charge conservation @xmath12 the latter results in poisson s equation for the electric potential @xmath13 @xmath14 the resulting flow represents a superposition of mechanically and electrically driven flows , which owing to the linearity of the problem are mutually independent and , thus , are considered separately .",
    "subsequently , these two flow components are denoted by the indices @xmath15 and @xmath16 henceforth , we change to the dimensionless variables by using the hartmann layer thickness @xmath17 as the length scale and @xmath18 and @xmath19 as characteristic velocities for the flows driven mechanically and electrically .",
    "other quantities are scaled , respectively , by @xmath20 @xmath21 and @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 the directions of the magnetic field and force are specified by the unit vectors @xmath25 and @xmath26 governing equations ( [ eq : ns ] ) and ( [ eq : phi ] ) can be written in dimensionless form as @xmath27\\vec{f};\\qquad\\vec{\\nabla}^{2}\\phi-\\vec{\\beta}\\cdot\\vec{\\nabla}\\times\\vec{v}=-\\left[\\begin{array}{l } 0\\\\ \\delta \\end{array}\\right],\\label{eq : vl}\\ ] ] where the upper and lower cases on the r.h.s correspond to mechanically and electrically driven flows .",

    "for the sake of simplicity we further assume the @xmath35-axis to be directed along the magnetic field so that @xmath36 and @xmath37 firstly , it is important to note that ( [ eq : g ] ) can be factorised in two ways as @xmath38g\\ , & = & -g_{\\pm},\\label{eq : g - fct}\\\\ \\left[\\vec{\\nabla}^{2}\\mp\\partial_{z}\\right]g_{\\pm}\\!\\!\\ ! & = & -\\delta.\\label{eq : g - pm}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] secondly , the substitution @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the spherical radius , reduces ( [ eq : g - pm ] ) to @xmath41 whose fundamental solution is the well - known coulomb potential @xmath42 adding and subtracting ( [ eq : g - fct ] ) with different signs , results in @xmath43 equation ( [ sol : dzg ] ) can be integrated as @xmath44+q(r),\\label{sol : g}\\ ] ] where @xmath45 is the exponential integral and @xmath46 is a ` constant ' of integration .",
    "the latter is a function of the cylindrical radius @xmath47 and satisfies the homogeneous counterpart of ( [ eq : g ] ) .",
    "it is determined as @xmath48 by removing the logarithmic singularity @xmath49 which appears in ( [ sol : g ] ) at the symmetry axis because @xmath50 when @xmath51 the laplacian and the @xmath35-component of the gradient of @xmath34 , which are required in ( [ sol : vpf ] ) , are given by ( [ sol : d2 g ] ) and ( [ sol : dzg ] ) , respectively .",
    "the missing @xmath52-component of the gradient can be obtained by differentiating ( [ sol : g ] ) and expressed in terms of the previous two quantities and ( [ sol : g0 ] ) as @xmath53 for the following , it is important to note that the first term on the r.h.s depends only on the cylindrical radius @xmath52 and decreases inversely with @xmath52 , whereas the second term similar to ( [ sol : d2 g ] ) and ( [ sol : dzg ] ) depends also on the axial coordinate @xmath35 and falls off exponentially at large @xmath54        owing to the linearity of the problem , the mechanically induced flow can be represented as a superposition of particular solutions due to the force components parallel and perpendicular to the magnetic field . in the following , these solutions are referred to as axial and transverse ones .",
    "the former is obtained by taking @xmath55 in ( [ eq : vpf ] ) , which results in @xmath56 where @xmath57 axisymmetric poloidal velocity ( [ sol : v - axi ] ) is defined by the azimuthal component of the stream function @xmath58 the instantaneous streamlines of this flow , which are represented by the isolines of @xmath59 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:](_a _ ) together with the pressure distribution @xmath60 note that no electric potential is induced because the e.m.f generated by such an axisymmetric poloidal flow is purely azimuthal and , thus , solenoidal .",
    "as seen , the flow is confined in the regions where the argument of the exponential functions in ( [ sol : d2g],[sol : dzg ] ) is not too small , i.e. @xmath61 for the large axial distances @xmath62 , these regions correspond to two parabolic wakes @xmath63 which extend along the magnetic field in both directions from the origin . in the mid - plane",

    "however , as seen in fig .",
    "( [ fig:])(_b _ ) @xmath95 , the circulation in the plane of the magnetic field and force is directed oppositely to the latter with the associated transverse velocity varying as @xmath96 which at large distances drops off as @xmath97 this decrease is faster than @xmath98 for the total transverse velocity ( [ sol : v - trn - z ] ) , which includes also the circulation transversely to the magnetic field in the plane @xmath80-plane .",
    "thus , the latter obviously dominates at large axial distances .    the solutions for @xmath99 and @xmath100 which according to ( [ sol : v - trn ] ) differ from each other only by the sign , are substantially different from the solutions considered so far .",
    "the difference is due to the first term in ( [ sol : drg ] ) , which as noted above falls off at large cylindrical radii algebraically as @xmath101 in particular , for the mid - plane @xmath102 the expressions in ( [ sol : v - trn ] ) reduce to @xmath103 where @xmath104 thus , in contrast the other variables considered above , @xmath99 and @xmath105 fall off outside the wakes as @xmath106 rather than exponentially , and thus , as seen in fig .",
