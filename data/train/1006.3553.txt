    "the profiles of the broad emission lines in the spectrum of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) are the main source of information about the motion of the high density gas in the broad line region ( blr ) .",

    "the conclusion is that , in many agns , the mean column density of the blr clouds exceeds @xmath27 . in a later work , marconi",
    "et al ( 2009 ; hereafter m09 ) argued that firm conclusions regarding the role of radiation pressure force are difficult to obtain since the column density in some blrs can be different than in others and there is no simple way to evaluate the overall effect of such a column density distribution .",

    "in this work we focus on the `` cloud model '' of the blr . the general framework of this model is explained in netzer ( 1990 ) and in kaspi and netzer ( 1999 ) and a major empirical justification is obtained from the recent x - ray detected single blobs , or clouds , moving in a region which is typical , in terms of velocity and dimension , of the blr ( risaliti et al .",

    "the dynamics of the blr gas in this model has never been treated and is far more complicated than the one considered here .",
    "another possibility that has been discussed , extensively , is that wind from the inner disk plays an important role in feeding and driving the blr gas .",
    "possible evidence for this scenario comes from radio observations ( e.g. vestergaard , wilkes , & barthel 2000 ; jarvis & mclure 2006 ) and spectropolarimetry ( smith et al .",

    "the calculations of real orbits , and the conditions for cloud escape , require their integration and will thus include the standard constants of motion ( energy and angular momentum ) .",

    "the confining mechanism is not known but high temperature gas and magnetic confinement have been proposed .",
    "the approach chosen here is consistent with the idea of magnetic confinement and some justifications for it are given in rees , netzer and ferland ( 1989 ) .",
    "we adopt a simple model of numerous individual clouds that are moving under the combined influence of the bh gravity and radiation pressure force .",
    "following netzer ( 1990 ) , and kaspi and netzer ( 1999 ) , we assume that clouds retain their mass as they move in or out and the gas density changes with radius in a way that depends on the radial changes of the confining pressure .",
    "assume the external pressure and hence the gas density in individual clouds are proportional to the radial coordinate , @xmath45 .",
    "a reasonable guess that agrees with observations is @xmath46 ( rees , netzer and ferland 1989 ) .",
    "this results in a radial dependence of the ionization parameter ( the ratio of ionizing photon density to gas density ) , @xmath47 . for spherical clouds , @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the cloud radius and",
    "@xmath52 its geometrical cross section .",
    "the line intensity contributed by a single cloud , @xmath53 , depends on its covering factor and the line emissivity @xmath54 which depends on the conditions in the gas , @xmath55 in the real calculations we ignore factors of order unity relating the mean cloud `` size '' and its mean column density since this is not known and require different type of calculations .",
    "the above considerations suggest that the importance of radiation pressure increases with distance because of the dependence of @xmath34 on @xmath56 , i.e. @xmath57 since @xmath40 depends on the global accretion rate which has little to do with cloud properties , the more physical approach is to consider the case of a certain @xmath40 and follow the cloud motion .",
    "the examples discussed below follow this approach .    in this work we consider three types of clouds :    1 .",
    "very large column density clouds where radiation pressure force is negligible at all distances . here",
    "virial cloud motion is a good approximation ( the ferland et al 2009 infalling clouds belong to this category ) .",
    "2 .   cloud for which radiation pressure is very important somewhere inside the `` classical blr '' ( e.g. inside the rm radius ) .",
    "such clouds will escape the system on dynamical time scales and their contribution to the line profiles is small except for times immediately after a large increase in .",
    "clouds for which radiation pressure is non - negligible but is not strong enough to allow escape .",

    "the critical radius should not be confused with the point of escape from the system .",
    "non - radial velocity components ( @xmath41 ) , that reflect the energy and angular momentum of the system will act to reduce this radius ( see examples below ) .",

    "the profiles given below are only those for a line of sight which is perpendicular to the central plane of motion ( if such a plane exists ) .",
    "all calculations assume a large enough number of clouds such that the predicted profiles are smooth ( see bottorff and ferland 2000 for discussion and earlier references on this issue ) .",
    "physical properties that _ are not _ included in the present calculations are non - isotropic central radiation field , non - isotropic line emission , the photoionization of gas with a range of density and metallicity , different inclinations of the line of sight to the central plane of motion , large cloud covering factors in a specific direction , and central obscuration , e.g. by the accretion disk .",

    "the observed fwhms are , indeed , smaller than the ones that would have been observed if all clouds had extremely large column densities .",

    "for example , if we use the first part of the table and assume a source with a certain  and @xmath82 , we find that the mass of a similar  source with @xmath114 will be under - estimated by a factor of 1.11/0.75 .    regarding the second case , it is important to note that under - estimates and over - estimates of @xmath1  are equally likely .",
    "consider again an rm sample where , for most sources , @xmath82 .",
    "this results in a certain value of @xmath15 which takes into account the effect of radiation pressure force in _ some _ of these sources ( see bottom part of table  1 ) .",
    "assume a second , randomly selected agn sample with a similar bh mass distribution but a typical @xmath40 which is much smaller than 0.1 .",
    "most measured fwhms in this sample are _ broader _ than those in the rm sample because radiation pressure force is not as effective in reducing the cloud velocity . using the value of @xmath15 derived for the rm sample will result in _ over estimating _",
    "@xmath1  in the second sample .",
    "the lower part of table  1 gives some idea about the magnitude of this effect , e.g. an over estimate by a factor of 1.01/0.76 .",
    "the third case is similar to the first one except that large luminosity variations , on time scales that are not too different from the blr dynamical time , are occurring in most sources , including those selected for rm monitoring .",
    "table  1 shows that , like the first case , the deduced @xmath15 represents well the population because @xmath92 follows the variations in .",
    "the mean @xmath1  in such a sample is recovered albeit with a larger uncertainty .",
    "given the above considerations , we now investigate an alternative method to calculate @xmath1 .",
    "the method takes into account the effect of radiation pressure force on the cloud motion and the results will be compared to those obtained by the old method ( eqn .",
    "[ eq : old_mbh ] ) and by the m08 method .",
    "our new calculations indicate that the emissivity weighted depends both on the ( large ) range in @xmath3 across the entire agn population , as well as on short time scale changes in in individual sources .",
    "the first of those depends roughly on @xmath4 and is a manifestation of the observational fact that the ionization parameter , @xmath115 , and the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) , are not changing much with source luminosity .",
    "the second reflects changes in the blr structure due to the reaction of various column density clouds to the ( changing ) radiation pressure force .",
    "this depends on both  and @xmath1 .",
    "this is seen for example in eqn .",
    "[ eq : r_min ] for the critical radius where clouds can escape the system and also in the calculations of table  1 .",
    "it is therefore reasonable to assume that  is given by an expression of the form , @xmath116 where @xmath117 and @xmath118 are constants and @xmath3 is a measure of the source luminosity , e.g. if = ( ) . obviously , the above approximation is not unique and one can assume other dependences that are consistent with the line profile calculations , e.g. a dependence of fwhm on @xmath2 .",
    "the idea of introducing a second , luminosity dependent term into the calculation of @xmath1  is not new . in particular",
    ", m08 suggested an expression for @xmath1  which depends on both @xmath4 and @xmath119 ( eqn .",
    "[ eq : m08_mbh ] ) . assuming all agns obey the same relationship , and",
    "is the same in all , the m08 expression leads to extremely large values of @xmath1  for the most luminous agns .",
    "the reason is the linear dependence of @xmath1  on @xmath3 at very high luminosities combined with the calibration of the relationship at small @xmath3 , typical of the @xmath5  sample of onken et al .",
    "the additional consequence of this approach is an upper limit of @xmath112 in many high luminosity , large bh mass sources . in their later work",
    ", m09 considered the possibility that  can differ from one source to another but is still constant for all clouds in a given blr .",
    "this would result in smaller @xmath1  and larger @xmath40 in some high luminosity sources since in some blrs ,  can exceed @xmath17  by a large factor thus reducing the importance of radiation pressure force .",
    "the limitation of the m08 mass estimate is the detachment of @xmath3 from @xmath1 . as shown here , this is not the case in more realistic blrs , especially those where the masses of the clouds are conserved . in such cases ,",
    "the location of the outer clouds that still contribute to the line profiles depends on @xmath2 and the 3d - velocities of the marginally bound clouds are such that the product @xmath120 is not very different from what is found in pure gravity dominated systems .",
    "moreover , for pressure confined clouds , the dependence on  is likely to be different in different parts of the blr .",
    "thus , we are looking for an expression that will reflect , properly , all these effects and will allow for the possibility of a range of column densities in _ every source_. we also want to avoid biasing in the derivation of @xmath1   in the limits of very large or very small @xmath3 and to retain the experimental results that @xmath121 with @xmath9 .",
    "all the above can be achieved by assuming that  is given by eqn .",
    "[ eq : new_rblr ] and requiring that @xmath122 . for the sake of simplicity",
    ", we assume @xmath123 and @xmath124 and substitute eqn .",
    "[ eq : new_rblr ] into the mass expression .",
    "this leads to a simple quadratic equation in @xmath1  with the following solution , @xmath125 \\,\\ , , \\label{eq : new_mbh}\\ ] ] where @xmath117 and @xmath118 are the same ones used in eqn .",
    "[ eq : new_rblr ] except for a common multiplicative constant which depends on the units of , 5100  and @xmath1 .",

    "we used eqn .",
    "[ eq : new_mbh ] and the woo et al .",

    "the list is an extension of the one used by onken et al .",

    "we have supplemented the data in woo et al . by data from bentz et al .",
    "( 2009 ) on  and 5100where this information was missing .",
    "first , we performed a @xmath131 analysis on @xmath1(rm ) vs. @xmath5  using the parameters recommended by gltekin et al .",
    "this gave @xmath132 which is consistent with the values found by onken et al .",
    "( 2004 ) and woo et al .",
    "( 2010 ) by a factor of about @xmath133 .",
    "all these numbers are sensitive to the error estimate in @xmath130 and in the virial product . ]",
    "next we carried out a @xmath131 minimization to solve for @xmath117 and @xmath118 in eqn .",
    "[ eq : new_mbh ] .",
    "since the minimization involves the error estimate on 5100 , and since this error is not very well defined given the combination of observational uncertainly and the intrinsic scatter in 5100  over several long rm campaigns , we decided to adopt a uniform value of @xmath134 .",
    "we also assume a minimum of 0.1 to @xmath135 and a minimum of 0.05 on @xmath136 .",
    "our results depend slightly on these assumptions .",
    "the best values obtained in this procedure are @xmath137 , @xmath138 and @xmath139 .",
    "extensive tests show that the @xmath131 changes very little if @xmath117 or @xmath118 are changing by up to 10% .",
    "this is the result of some degeneracy between @xmath117 and @xmath118 ( see eqn .",
    "[ eq : new_mbh ] ) .",
    "the average deviation between the new mass estimates and those obtained by the @xmath140 method is 0.31 dex .",
    "there is a weak dependence of the deviation on the line width ( larger deviation for larger fwhm ( ) ) which is marginal given the small number of sources in the sample .",
    "the corresponding number for the deviation of masses obtained directly from the rm measurements and the above value of @xmath15 is 0.36 dex . thus the new method is , indeed , superior in this respect .",
    "obviously it is not surprising to find such an improvement when adding a new free parameter to the model .    to compare the various mass estimates more thoroughly , we calculated @xmath1  in three different ways : the old method ( eqn .",
    "[ eq : old_mbh ] ) with @xmath132 , the m08 method ( eqn .",
    "[ eq : m08_mbh ] ) with @xmath141 and @xmath142 ( as in m08 ) , and the new method ( eqn .",
    "[ eq : new_mbh ] ) with the above @xmath117 and @xmath118 . for the m08 method",
    ", we followed the m09 recommendation and assumed a log normal distribution of  with a mean of @xmath17  and a large standard deviation of 0.5 dex .",
    "we also calculated  in the old ( eqn .",
    "[ eq : old_rblr ] ) and new ( eqn .",
    "[ eq : new_rblr ] ) ways .",
    "[ fig : simulation ] compares two mass ratios , @xmath1(new)/@xmath1(old ) ( red points ) and @xmath1(new)/@xmath1(m08 ) ( black points ) , in a large simulated agn sample .",
    "the sample covers , uniformly , the luminosity range = @xmath143 ^-1 ergs s@xmath129and the simulations assume a gaussian , luminosity independent distribution of fwhm ( ) with a mean of 4,500 ^-1 kms@xmath129  and a variance of 1,500 ^-1 kms@xmath129 .",
    "the diagram shows that the new and old estimates are similar at all  but @xmath1(m08 ) deviates from both , by a large factor , at both low and high luminosities .",
    "moreover , the slight deviation between the new and old methods at the very high luminosity end , by up to about 0.2 dex in @xmath1 , is most likely due to the fact that the procedure used to obtain @xmath117 and @xmath118 is based on a sample of 29 mostly low - to - intermediate luminosity agns while the simulations reach a much larger value of .",
    "a comparison of the estimated  ( eq .",
    "[ eq : old_rblr ] and [ eq : new_rblr ] ) leads to similar conclusions .",
    "we also made a similar test on the netzer and trakhtenbrot ( 2007 ) sample using all three methods .",
    "the luminosity range in this case is smaller but the fwhm ( ) distribution more typical of observed agns .",
    "the results ( not shown here ) are very similar to those of the simulated sample .    in conclusion , the new method for estimating @xmath1  gives results that do not deviate much from the old method which is based on a single constant @xmath15 .",
    "this is true at both high and low luminosities and over a large range in fwhm . obviously , the range of parameters tested here ( @xmath72 , orbit eccentricity , several types of cloud distributions , etc . )",
    "is rather limited and more extensive modeling is required to confirm these results .",
    "however , it is our opinion that the main limitation of the @xmath1  determination methods remains observational and is related to the fact that the present agn @xmath5  sample is small ( 29 sources ) and can not possibly represent the entire range of properties , mostly @xmath40 , observed in agns .",
    "we have investigated the motion of blr clouds with time - independent mass under a range of conditions defined by a radial - dependent confining pressure .",
    "these conditions enforce a range of  in every blr , even if the intrinsic mass distribution of the cloud is narrow .",
    "we calculated cloud orbits under a central potential that includes a radiation pressure term .",
    "the orbits were then combined to predict emission line profiles in several simple situations .",
    "we only considered uniformly emitted emission lines and the preliminary comparison with with actual observations used realistic emissivity and column density distributions but was limited to the  and  lines and at most two different cloud distributions .",
    "we found significant changes in cloud locations and velocities for those cases where the column densities are small enough to allow a significant contribution due to radiation pressure .",
    "this can be important in both high and low @xmath40 sources .",
    "however , while cloud orbits are strongly influenced by the radiation pressure force , there is a relatively small change in the mean @xmath120 and hence no large underestimation or overestimation of @xmath1 .",
    "we illustrate this behavior in several cases but note that other cloud distributions , with different mass , location and velocity distributions , may lead to somewhat different conclusions .",
    "we used the new results to suggest a novel method for calculating  and @xmath1  by applying two new constants that were calculated by a comparison of the  and 5100  observations and the @xmath140 agn sample of woo et al .",
    "we applied the method to several large observed and simulated agn samples and demonstrated good agreement between the new and the old , pure gravity based methods .",
