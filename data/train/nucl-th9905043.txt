    "the pion nucleon - nucleon vertex function is needed in many different places in hadron physics , such as the nucleon - nucleon interaction @xcite , pion - nucleon scattering and pion photoproduction @xcite , deep - inelastic scattering @xcite , and as a possible explanation of the goldberger - treiman discrepancy @xcite .",
    "commonly , one represents the vertex function by a phenomenological form factor .",
    "the cut - off parameters employed in the various calculations range from @xmath6 mev in pion photoproduction to @xmath7 mev in some one - boson exchange models of the nucleon - nucleon interaction , assuming a monopole representation ( i.e. @xmath8 in eq .",

    "it is an off - shell quantity which is inherently model - dependent . for a given model , the form factor  besides being a parametrization of the vertex function  summarizes those processes which are not calculated explicitly .    the simplest class of meson - theoretical models of the nucleon - nucleon interaction includes the exchange of one meson only .",
    "in these models , one needs `` hard '' form factors for the following reason . in one - boson exchange potentials ,",
    "the tensor force is generated by one - pion and one - rho exchange . a cut - off below 1.3 gev",
    "would reduce the tensor force too strongly and make a description of the quadrupole moment of the deuteron impossible @xcite .",
    "this situation changes when the exchange of two correlated bosons between nucleons is handled explicitly .",
    "the exchange of an interacting @xmath1 pair generates additional tensor strength at large momentum transfers .",
    "this implies softer cut - offs for the genuine one - pion exchange @xcite .",
    "meson theory allows to undress the phenomenological form factors at least partly by calculating those processes which contribute most strongly to the long range part of the vertex functions @xcite .",
    "a physically very transparent way to include the most important processes is given by dispersion theory .",
    "the imaginary part of the form factor in the time - like region is given by the unitarity cuts . in principle",
    ", one should consider the full three - pion continuum .",
    "a reasonable approximation is to reduce the three - body problem to an effective two - body problem by representing the two - pion subsystems by effective mesons @xcite .",
    "an explicit calculation of the selfenergy of the effective meson incorporates the effects of three - body unitarity . in the case of the pion - nucleon form factor , one expects that @xmath1 and @xmath2 intermediate states are particularly relevant . here",
    ", `` @xmath3 '' is understood as an abbreviation for the isoscalar two - pion subsystem . in many early calculations @xcite , the effect of the @xmath2 intermediate states",
    "was found to be negligible . in these calculations ,",
    "a scalar @xmath11 coupling has been used .",

    "the meson - meson scattering matrix @xmath12 is an essential building block of our model .",
    "formally , the scattering matrix is obtained by solving the bethe - salpeter equation , @xmath13 starting from a pseudopotential @xmath14 . given the well - known difficulties in solving the four - dimensional bethe salpeter equation , one rather solves three - dimensional equations , such as the blankenbecler - sugar equation ( bbs ) @xcite or related ones @xcite .",
    "the two - body propagator @xmath15 is chosen to reproduce the two - particle unitarity cuts in the physical region .",

    "the energies of the interacting particles are well - defined for on - shell scattering only . for off - shell scattering",
    ", there is an ambiguity .",
    "different choices of the energy components may affect the off - shell behaviour of the matrix elements . as long as one is exclusively interested in the scattering of one kind of particles , e.g. only pions",
    ", one can compensate the modifications of the off - shell behaviour by readjusting the coupling constants .",
    "this gets more difficult as soon as one aims for a consistent model of many different reactions .",
    "moreover , in the calculation of the form factor , the scattering kernel @xmath14 may have singularities which do not agree with the physical singularities due to e.g. three - pion intermediate states @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the blankenbecler - sugar reduction , time - ordered perturbation theory ( topt)determines the off - shell behaviour uniquely .",
    "moreover , only physical singularities corresponding to the decay into multi - meson intermediate states can occur @xcite . for the present purpose , we therefore will employ time - ordered perturbation theory .",
