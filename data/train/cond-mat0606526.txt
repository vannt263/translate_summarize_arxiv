    "non - equilibrium systems are at the center of old but still very lively research in physics , due to the great importance that out of equilibrium phenomena have in the natural world  @xcite . since the seminal studies by carnot , clausius and kelvin , who made clear the relevance of the lack of equilibrium in the extraction of work from heat",
    ", systems out of thermodynamic equilibrium are investigated in the vastest set of applications , ranging from mechanical engineering to the study of chemical reactions , molecular ratchets and all the biophysical processes of growth , differentiation , movement and evolution .    on the theoretical side ,",
    "the study of fluctuations in non - equilibrium systems has been marked by a series of fundamental breakthroughs , such as einstein s work  @xcite on brownian motion and the first statement of a fluctuation - response theory , through its celebrated relation between diffusivity and mobility ; the onsager s works on the reciprocity of transport coefficients and on the regression hypothesis of large fluctuations  @xcite ; and the works of green and kubo on the general linear response formalism and the fluctuation - dissipation relation ( fdr ) in its full dynamical form  @xcite .",
    "all these works have resulted in the construction of the so - called non - equilibrium thermodynamics  @xcite , that studies non - equilibrium states of smoothly varying locally equilibrated regions , i.e.  of systems in local thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "the fdr links the mean response to a perturbation with a suitable correlation function computed for the unperturbed system , and was originally developed in the context of ( equilibrium ) statistical mechanics of hamiltonian systems .",
    "this fact was misunderstood by some authors .",
    "for instance , it was claimed ( with qualitative arguments ) that in fully developed turbulence ( which is a non hamiltonian and non equilibrium system ) there is no relation between fluctuations and relaxation to the statistical steady state  @xcite . in reality ,",
    "a generalized fdr holds under rather general hypothesis , independently from the hamiltonian nature of the systems  @xcite .",
    "if the system is mixing and the invariant measure is `` smooth '' enough , there exists a connection between the `` non equilibrium '' properties ( response to external perturbations ) and the `` equilibrium '' properties ( correlation functions computed according to the equilibrium measure of the unperturbed system ) .",
    "the validity of the fdr does not depend on the deterministic or stochastic nature of the system neither on the `` equilibrium '' or `` non equilibrium '' character of its statistical steady state .    in the last decade",
    "a series of important results have been obtained , all related to a seemingly very general fluctuation relation ( fr ) , that constrains without any fitting parameter the pdf of the fluctuations of entropy production or , more generally , of dissipated energy . the main steps , in historical order , are : the proposal and the observation of fr in numerical simulations , by evans , cohen and morris in 1993  @xcite , a derivation of the same relation in transient states in 1994 , by evans and searles  @xcite , and the derivation of a theorem for asymptotic states by gallavotti and cohen in 1995  @xcite .",
    "if the chaotic hypothesis of the gallavotti - cohen theorem holds , the deterministic dynamics can be mapped onto a mixing markovian stochastic process : this observation stimulated the derivation of a stochastic version of the fr , first obtained by lebowitz and spohn  @xcite and , more rigorously ( and under more restrictive hypothesis ) by maes  @xcite .",
    "the case of langevin equations has been discussed by kurchan  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we will work in the stochastic framework , where one can directly speak of the probability , @xmath0 say , of observing a given trajectory segment @xmath1 of temporal length @xmath2 . to begin with",
    ", we restrict our discussion to the simpler case of discrete states and , therefore , discrete trajectories . then , in the presence of an appropriate form of reversibility , for each trajectory @xmath1 one can define the quantity @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the reversal of @xmath1   will be contrasted with a different quantity denoted simply by @xmath5 . ] . when detailed balance is satisfied one has @xmath6 . in the following",
    "we will refer to such a case as to `` equilibrium '' . equation ( [ generic ] )",
    "implies @xmath7 and , straightforwardly , @xmath8 the symmetry @xmath9 is the simplest form of a fr .",
    "this relation is the basis of a variety of fr s discussed in the recent literature  @xcite .    in the treatment of gallavotti and cohen for deterministic systems ,",
    "the time @xmath2 must be large , the role of @xmath10 is played by the time - integrated phase space contraction rate and the following large deviation function of @xmath10 is considered : @xmath11 the fr for @xmath10 can then be written as @xmath12    the idea underlying definition  ( [ generic ] ) is to identify heuristically the contribution of a single trajectory to the entropy production , so that @xmath10 physically represents an integrated flux ( e.g. heat flux ) divided by a temperature ( or a sum of fluxes divided by the temperatures of the different reservoirs involved ) , i.e. @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the applied non - conservative field , @xmath15 is its conjugated observable and @xmath16 is an energy . for small gaussian fluctuations , the fr yields directly @xmath17 , because of the parabolic shape of the large deviation function .",
    "then the classical fdr emerges as a particular case near equilibrium ( i.e. near @xmath18 ) .",
    "in fact , the previous physical identification of @xmath10 implies @xmath19 .",
    "therefore , assuming that @xmath20 where @xmath21 is given by its equilibrium value ( as it is true to first order in @xmath14 ) and @xmath22 ( linear response ) , one obtains @xmath23 which is the celebrated einstein relation between mobility @xmath24 and diffusivity @xmath21 . in a similarly straightforward fashion",
    ", the onsager reciprocal relations can be derived from the fr , recalling the time reversibility of the evolution .    in deterministic dynamics",
    ", the gallavotti - cohen theorem is based on the hypothesis that the system is anosov , hence that its phase space is bounded . in some systems ( for example in presence of singular potentials ) this hypothesis is not well controlled , because non - conservative forces let @xmath10 fluctuate without bounds . in the stochastic framework , this problem can be cast into simple mathematical terms .",
    "in particular , ref .",
    "@xcite considers a markov chain , in the stationary state , with probability of each trajectory @xmath1 given by @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the invariant probability of the state @xmath27 and @xmath28 is the transition probability associated with the jump @xmath29 between two possible states of the chain .",
    "therefore , the functional @xmath10 can be divided in two pieces : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is @xmath32 . in this paper",
    "we will argue that the fluctuations of @xmath31 , which has to be considered as a `` border '' term , are of practical importance ( i.e. in numerical and , presumably , also in real experiments ) in the measurements of @xmath5 .",
    "the relevance of border terms for finite and infinite times has been discussed recently in other contexts : farago  @xcite was the first , to the best of our knowledge , to show with exact results the difference of the large deviations of work done by the thermostat and energy dissipated by the system , in stochastic models described by a langevin equation .",
    "border terms had been dealt with also in deterministic dynamics , in the paper  @xcite by evans and searles , where the `` dissipation function '' @xmath33 , analogous to our @xmath10 , was introduced as a physically relevant quantity . in a time",
    "dependent langevin equation , van zon and cohen  @xcite and more recently baiesi and co - workers  @xcite have studied the difference between work done and heat transferred to the thermostat ; the effect of a border term making the difference between two heat fluxes in a non - equilibrium langevin model has been studied with exact analytical results in a more recent paper by visco  @xcite .",
    "simulations of deterministic system  @xcite have revealed the importance of border terms also at finite times . in ref .",
    "@xcite the necessity of the inclusion of border terms was recognized , and the example of a bernoulli process has been discussed . in the lebowitz - spohn formulation , the problem of borders at finite times has been treated in  @xcite , considering simulations of a tracer particle in a granular gas .",
    "the necessity of including border terms has also been recognized in  @xcite .",
    "the term @xmath31 can contribute to the large deviations of @xmath5 , even if all time - rescaled cumulants of its fluctutations vanish .",
    "van zon and cohen  @xcite first made a general observation : if one has a time - extensive variable @xmath34 ( an observable whose cumulants all grow linearly in time   and therefore of @xmath35 : this amounts to say that the probability of @xmath5 obeys a large deviation scaling , being time the `` large parameter '' , or in other words that it is characterized by an exponential decay when the time length of the trajectory is linearly increased . ] ) and a non extensive variable @xmath36 with unbounded fluctuations whose probability has exponential tails , or slower , then there is no guarantee that the extensive variable @xmath37 has the same large deviations of @xmath34 .",
    "heuristically , this observation may descend from the existence and finiteness of the large deviation function for @xmath36 , @xmath38    on practical grounds , we will show that the `` memory '' of initial and final conditions , i.e. the relevance of @xmath31 , lasts much longer ( @xmath39 times longer and more ) than the typical time defined in terms of the probability evolution of the markov process toward the invariant probability , making the fr for @xmath5 practically impossible to verify in almost all our examples .",
    "recent theoretical studies  @xcite predict that the form of the violation of the fr for w should have given character in general , so that the resulting fr would take the form of the heat fr of van zon and cohen . these studies concern a given class of systems and observables , hence it is interesting to see which other systems verify the same predictions and which systems do not .",
    "for instance , ref .",
    "@xcite shows models in which the violation of the fr takes on a different form .",
    "therefore , we investigate also this question .    in section ii we will pose the problem in a general form .",
    "our two stochastic examples , a markov chain with a large number of states and a continuous time markov process exactly defined by the dynamics of a tracer in a granular gas  @xcite , will be discussed respectively in section iii and iv .",
    "concluding remarks will be given in section v.",
    "consider a markov chain with @xmath40 ( possibily infinite ) states with invariant probability measure @xmath41 and transition rates @xmath42 which denote the conditional probability of going from state @xmath43 to state @xmath44 , we are interested in the fluctuations of the following two `` action functionals '' : @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the state of the system at time @xmath47 .",
    "both functionals have been defined by lebowitz and spohn , in  @xcite , who focused on the properties of @xmath5 , neglecting the importance of the difference @xmath48 .",
    "for this reason , we call @xmath5 as the `` lebowitz - spohn functional '' , while we refer to @xmath49 as to the `` corrected '' or `` adjusted '' functional . both @xmath5 and @xmath49",
    "associate a real number to any finite trajectory ( any realization of the markov chain ) , and have the following properties :    * * zero at equilibrium * : by equilibrium we mean a stationary state which verifies the detailed balance condition @xmath50 , being @xmath51 the invariant measure .",
    "then , one has @xmath52 if @xmath53 , even during transient states represented by measures other than the microcanical one .",
    "however , @xmath54 even at equilibrium except for isolated ( microcanonical ) systems .",
    "differently , @xmath55 at any equilibrium state , but not in transient states . *",
    "* ergodicity * : for @xmath56 large enough , for almost all the trajectories @xmath57 ; here ( assuming an ergodic and stationary system ) @xmath58 indicates an average over many independent segments from a single very long trajectory . * * entropy production * : let @xmath59 be the entropy of the system at time @xmath56 , where @xmath60 is the probability to be in the state @xmath47 at time @xmath56 ; then + @xmath61 + where @xmath62 is always non - negative , @xmath63 is a linear function with respect to @xmath64 , and @xmath65 . in  @xcite",
    "this has been shown for continuous time markov processes , but the proof is valid also in the discrete time case ( see for example  @xcite ) .",
    "this leads to consider @xmath66 and @xmath67 equivalent to the contribution of a single trajectory to the total entropy flux . in a stationary state @xmath68 and",
    "therefore the flux is equivalent to the production . * * positivity of the average * : for large enough @xmath56 : 1 ) at equilibrium ( i.e. when there is detailed balance ) @xmath69 ; 2 ) out of equilibrium those two averages are positive .",
    "let us now introduce our objects of study :    * * @xmath70 * : @xmath71 where @xmath72 and @xmath73 is the probability of finding @xmath74 at time @xmath56 .",
    "note that , in principle @xmath75 at any finite time ; a derivation of this property has been obtained in  @xcite , while a rigorous proof with more restrictive hypothesis is in  @xcite ; the discussion for the case of a langevin equation is in  @xcite . * * @xmath76 * : @xmath77 where @xmath78 and @xmath79 is the probability density function of finding @xmath80 at time @xmath56 .",
    "we first define an extended probability vector @xmath81 where each component @xmath82 is the probability of finding the system at time @xmath56 in the state @xmath47 with the value @xmath5 for the lebowitz and spohn functional .",
    "this means that @xmath83 is the probability density function at time @xmath56 for the functional @xmath5 , while @xmath84 is the probability of finding the system in state @xmath47 at time t and @xmath85 .",
    "we will use the simple notation @xmath86 to denote the invariant measure , i.e. @xmath87 . the evolution of @xmath81 is given by the following equation :    @xmath88    where @xmath89 is the previously defined transition matrix and @xmath90 is the variation of @xmath5 due to a jump from the state @xmath47 to the state @xmath91 .",
    "this reads @xmath92 for the original lebowitz - spohn functional .",
    "then define the function @xmath93 and obtain , for its evolution @xmath94 in a compact form we can write @xmath95 @xmath96 being the matrix defined by @xmath97 and , therefore , @xmath98 with @xmath99 .    note that the @xmath100-term of the evolution matrix @xmath101_{ij}$ ] is a function of @xmath102 that represents the characteristic function of the distribution of @xmath5 at time @xmath56 constrained by the conditions @xmath103 and @xmath104 ( i.e. the system is in state @xmath91 at time @xmath105 and in state @xmath47 at time @xmath56 ) . in turn , the characteristic function of the distribution of @xmath5 is obtained summing over all the states : @xmath106_{ij}\\nu_j(0)=\\sum_j \\nu_j(0 ) \\sum_i [ a(\\lambda)^t]_{ij}.\\ ] ]    in principle ( under suitable analiticity assumptions ) one recovers the distribution of @xmath5 at time @xmath56 by inverting the transform : @xmath107 the knowledge of the characteristic function suffices to generate the moments or the cumulants of @xmath5 :    @xmath108      at large times , the evolution operator @xmath109 is dominated by the largest eigenvalue @xmath110 of @xmath96 .",
    "defining @xmath111 it follows that @xmath112 \\mathbf{x}^{(1)}(\\lambda)\\\\ \\tilde{f}(t,\\lambda)=\\sum_i { { \\tilde{p}}}_i(t,\\lambda ) & \\sim & \\exp(\\zeta(\\lambda)t ) \\left[\\sum_j x_j^{(1)}(\\lambda ) \\nu_j(0)\\right ] \\sum_i x^{(1)}_i(\\lambda ) , \\ ] ] where @xmath113 is the eigenvector of @xmath96 associated to the largest eigenvalue @xmath110 .",
    "one expects , from the above large times behavior , an analogous large time behavior for the density distribution of @xmath5 , i.e.    @xmath114_{ij } \\nonumber \\\\",
    "\\sim \\exp\\left[t \\max_\\lambda\\left(\\lambda \\frac{w}{t}+\\zeta(\\lambda)\\right)\\right]=\\exp[t \\pi(w / t)]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where we have defined @xmath115 , the large deviation function associated with @xmath116 , which ( under the validity of the last chain of equalities ) is obtained as a legendre transform of @xmath117 , i.e. @xmath118 with @xmath119    the @xmath70 symmetry appears at this stage .",
    "in fact , it is evident that @xmath120 being @xmath121 the transposed of @xmath122 .",
    "this implies that @xmath123 which suffices to get @xmath124 , i.e. @xmath125 at large times .",
    "clearly the validity of the expansion in  ( [ saddle ] ) is crucial for the validity of the @xmath70 symmetry , but it is not guaranteed when the integrand presents non - analiticities in the @xmath102 complex plane .",
    "such a catastrophe can happen , for example , when the number of states @xmath40 becomes infinite and the initial ( final ) probability @xmath126 has some unbounded form ( see below ) .",
    "the physical meaning of such a catastrophe is that the large fluctuations in the initial and final state can not be neglected , because they contribute to the tails ( i.e. the large deviations ) of @xmath116 at any time and , therefore , they prevent the @xmath70 symmetry .",
    "the problem , now , is to find a condition sufficient to trigger the analyticity breaking , in terms of initial / final state distribution .",
    "note that the breaking of analiticity of @xmath127 is associated with large fluctuations of invariant probabilities , but here `` large '' has a very generic meaning and does not require the presence of any power law tail .",
    "apparently ( from many studies including numerical simulations  @xcite , analytical calculations  @xcite and heuristic arguments , cf .  for example  @xcite ) , the initial and final configurations can be a problem when the distribution of the boundary term @xmath128 has exponential , or higher , tails in the stationary state .",
    "but the problem may occur _ even if @xmath86 has gaussian tails _ !",
    "let us see what happens to the `` adjusted '' functional @xmath49 . here",
    "the prime will always denote quantities which involve this second functional .",
    "for example we have the extended measure vector @xmath129 and the probability density function at time @xmath56 , @xmath130 , the characteristic function @xmath131 , etc . the increment for the functional at each jump reads @xmath132 , recalling that @xmath86 is the invariant measure for the state @xmath47 .",
    "the evolution matrix therefore reads @xmath133 and the evolution equation reads @xmath134 the fundamental difference between @xmath49 and the original @xmath5 function appears now . since @xmath135 , if one takes @xmath136 ( the system is in the stationary regime from the beginning ) , it happens that @xmath137 i.e. @xmath138 . by recursivity , one realizes that this is the case for all times @xmath56 , i.e.@xmath139 in general , which leads immediately to a finite - time symmetry relation @xmath140 valid for any @xmath56 .",
    "the second functional contains a term that absorbs all the effects of the fluctuations of the steady state measure , leading to a conservation of the symmetry @xmath141 all along the evolution .",
    "such a conservation prevents bad surprises at large times also in presence of large fluctuations of the initial measure .",
    "when discussing the asymptotic validity of a fluctuation relation in a finite time simulation an immediate question arises : what are the characteristic times of the evolution and how large with respect to them is the chosen time @xmath2 ?",
    "the correct answer , here , is that one is really probing the asymptotic behavior , i.e. really measuring the large deviations of functionals @xmath5 and @xmath49 , if and only if the fluctuations satisfy the following time scaling : @xmath142.\\ ] ] actually , this is equivalent to observe stationary values for the time - dependent cumulants rescaled with the time @xmath143 and @xmath144 .",
    "verifying the stationarity of the rescaled cumulants sometimes proves to be advantageous with respect to the scaling  ( [ scaling ] ) : a cumulant is in fact a simple number containing information on @xmath116 in an integrated form . on the other hand ,",
    "the stationarity of a cumulant is a necessary but not sufficient condition for the validity of the scaling  ( [ scaling ] ) ( all cumulants must be stationary ) and its measure may eventually be very noisy .",
    "the large time dominance of the maximum eigenvalue allows the direct calculation of the asymptotic cumulants of @xmath5 and @xmath49 , i.e. @xmath145 these formulae are valid provided that @xmath117 and @xmath146 are analytic in zero .",
    "numerical observations in the following example suggest a coincidence between @xmath147 and @xmath148 .",
    "this is consistent with direct calculations of @xmath117 and @xmath146 , which appear to coincide , in markov chains with a small number of states .",
    "we have not been able to address analytically the case of a markov chain with an infinite number of states .",
    "the other evidence which will appear from the simulations ( already noticed in the granular tracer model  @xcite ) is that the cumulants of @xmath5 are much slower than those of @xmath49 to converge to a stationary value .",
    "the time of convergence to the perfect large deviation scaling  ( [ scaling ] ) is determined in a complex manner by the other eigenvalues ( from the second one ) of the operator @xmath96 ( or @xmath149 ) .",
    "it will be interesting to compare this convergence time ( estimated for example from the convergence time of the rescaled cumulants ) with the characteristic time of the markov chain itself @xmath150 .",
    "we will use , for @xmath150 , the time obtained with the following standard recipe .",
    "an initial vector @xmath151 evolves under the action of the transpose of the transition matrix : @xmath152 for a generic @xmath151 one has @xmath153 where the characteristic time @xmath150 is given by the second eigenvalue @xmath154 of @xmath155 , i.e. the closest one to the unitary circle : @xmath156 one can easily compute @xmath150 from the area @xmath157 of the parallelogram identified by @xmath41 and @xmath158 : @xmath159",
    "we discuss a simple markov chain which does not correspond to any particular physical system , but turns out to be useful in illustrating the relevance of the boundary term @xmath31 in the fluctuations of the two action functionals .",
    "such a model has been inspired by a work by gaspard and wang  @xcite .",
    "we consider a markov chain with @xmath160 states , labelled @xmath122 , @xmath31 and @xmath161 with @xmath162 .",
    "the transition matrix @xmath89 is given by    @xmath163    with @xmath164 , under the constraint that for every jump with nonzero transition probability , the reversed jump is also possible .",
    "the invariant probability @xmath165 for @xmath166 is given by @xmath167 with @xmath168 .",
    "it can be easily seen that the invariant measure for @xmath169 is the same as in the case @xmath166 with a decomposition of the measure of state @xmath170 into the measures of @xmath161 proportional to the values @xmath171 :    @xmath172        we measure the functionals @xmath173 and @xmath174 along independent non - overlapping segments of time - length @xmath2 extracted from a unique trajectory after the stationary regime has been achieved .",
    "in particular we probe the validity of a relation like @xmath175 where @xmath176 is the probability density function of finding one of the two functionals @xmath5 or @xmath49 after a time @xmath56 equal to @xmath36 ( i.e. @xmath176 corresponds to @xmath116 or to @xmath177 depending on the cases ) .",

    "the numerical results confirm what is expected : in the detailed balance ( equilibrium ) case , @xmath174 is identically zero and does not fluctuate ( its pdf is a delta in zero ) and therefore @xmath173 coincides with the opposite of the boundary term @xmath182 : they both have symmetric fluctuations around zero with exponential tails , and @xmath183 .",

    "it has been shown that the prototypical model of granular gas , the gas of inelastic hard spheres , can not be used without some care as a benchmark for the validity of the fluctuation relation : each single collision violates time reversibility , so that for any trajectory in the phase space of the whole system , its reversed trajectory _ does not exist_. this implies that the large deviations of entropic functionals are defined only for positive valuess , and that the fluctuation relation can not be verified . however , focussing on the markovian dynamics of a single tracer particle immersed in a gas , one may circumvent the problem of strong irreversibility and probe the validity of the fr in granular gases  @xcite .",
    "we consider the dynamics of a tracer granular particle in a homogeneous and dilute gas of grains which is driven by an unspecified energy source .",

    "we display in each figure the value of @xmath263 .",
    "again the idea that this quantity measures the distance from equilibrium of our system is well supported by the results of the simulations : @xmath264 is zero when @xmath265 and increases as @xmath194 is decreased and @xmath248 is increased .",
    "we recall that @xmath266 , since the difference between the two functionals has zero average at large times @xmath2 .",
    "we also remark that the distribution of both quantities @xmath5 and @xmath49 are symmetric at equilibrium ( i.e. when @xmath265 ) .",
    "we first discuss the results concerning the fluctuations of @xmath173 , identified in figures  [ fig : pdf ] and  [ fig : gc ] by squared symbols .",
    "they are strongly non - gaussian , with almost exponential tails , at low values of @xmath2 for any choice of the parameters . at large values of @xmath2 ( many hundreds of mean free times ) , the situation changes with how far from equilibrium the system is . at low values of @xmath264 the tails of the distribution are very similar to the ones observed at small times . at higher values of @xmath264 the distribution changes with time and tends to become more and more gaussian .",
    "we have not been able to measure negative deviations larger than the ones shown in the figures .",
    "distributions obtained at higher values of @xmath2 yielded a smaller statistics and very few negative events . with these numerical observations",

    "we conclude this paper with the following observations . in the first place",
    ", it seems important to point out the remarkable similarity of the results obtained for a rather abstract markov chain and the granular tracer . because the observables considered in this paper are subtle",
    ", one may expect that the similarity between the abstract and the concrete models concerns other observables as well , which is worth further investigation .    we have observed a failure of the fluctuation relation for @xmath5 ( @xmath70 ) , at all times that we could consider .",
    "this does not exclude that the relation holds at much larger times , which are of no practical interest , although they can be of theoretical interest .",
    "the failure is due to the boundary terms , which become more and more important as the steady state draws closer and closer to equilibrium .",
    "this suggests that the difference between physically relevant times , and the times at which the @xmath70 might be verified , grows as the steady state approaches an equilibrium state , possibly diverging in the equilibrium limit .",
    "the ( practical ) failure of the @xmath70 reported here does agree in a quantitative fashion with the one predicted by van zon and cohen , which was thought to be at work also in some deterministic systems  @xcite .",
    "however , a different conclusion is afforded by the results of  @xcite , which indicates that the possible failures of the @xmath70 do not have a universal character , and that further investigations are desirable .",
    "the general conclusion that we can draw from the above observations is that large deviations are particularly subtle objects , whose peculiarities are not so obvious in the physics of equilibrium systems , but become evident as soon as a slight perturbation away from equilibrium sets in .",
    "this should not sound paradoxical : steady states are achieved asymptotically in time ; this allows phenomena , such as long range correlations , which are extraneous to the physics of most equilibrium systems , but are well known in the physics of nonequilibrium steady states .",
    "furthemore , to keep a system on a nonequilibrium steady state , an unlimited amount of work may be done on the system or extracted from it , and this is bound to have observable ( and perhaps exploitable ) consequences on the behaviour of the system .    _",
