    "several works can be found discussing the application of periodic boundary conditions to representative regions , e.g. @xcite . for periodic structures ,",
    "the unit cell ( uc ) is used as the representative region , and the analysis is performed by applying periodic displacement boundary conditions .",
    "the topological complexity of many ucs found in practice , such as in typical woven composites , often leads to unpractical modelling and analysis times .",
    "for this reason , internal symmetries of the ucs must whenever possible be exploited to reduce the analysis domain further ( provided the appropriate boundary conditions are applied ) , thus reducing both modelling and analysis time .    a comprehensive study on the determination of reduced unit cells ( rucs ) for ud and particle reinforced composites was performed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "different rucs , loading cases and correspondent boundary conditions were determined and presented in detail .",
    "applied to textile composites , @xcite proposed a general framework for determining rucs .    in the first part of the present work , the derivation of the framework proposed in @xcite revisited and",
    "some of its building blocks redefined , resulting in a different , formally defined and more concise formulation .",
    "the framework proposed by @xcite requires the distinction of two different cases of equivalence between subcells : ( i ) equivalence is obtained by a symmetry operation or a translation , and ( ii ) equivalence is obtained by the combination of a symmetry operation and a translation . in the second case an additional vector of constants @xmath0 ( see @xcite ) needs to be considered when applying the boundary conditions .",
    "the non - zero components of this vector are tabulated for different cases and are determined by the fem as part of the solution .",
    "the formulation derived in the present work is more generic , in that no cases need to be treated separately , and mathematically complete in that no vector @xmath0 needs to be determined from tabulated data .",
    "all terms in the equation that assigns the periodic boundary conditions for a ruc are fully defined , simplifying the formulation and consequently their use .    in the second part of this paper ,",
    "the application of the formulation developed and its potential is illustrated through two practical examples : 3d woven composites and honeycombs .",
    "additionally , particular attention is given to offset - reduced unit cells as they allow the domain reduction without load restrictions .",
    "in this section , the equivalence framework is formally defined .",
    "it is based on four concepts : physical equivalence , load equivalence , periodicity and load admissibility . in the following sections each of these concepts is detailed .",

    "a domain @xmath18 is periodic if it can be reconstructed by tessellation of , non - overlapping , physically equivalent sub - domains @xmath19 with parallel lcs , i.e. if for all @xmath20:@xmath21 the smallest sub - domain verifying the periodicity definition is designated as an unit cell .",
    "the concept of load equivalence ( see @xcite ) provides a relation between physically - equivalent sub - domains , once the structure they are part of is loaded .",
    "let us consider a periodic structure as defined in the previous section .",
