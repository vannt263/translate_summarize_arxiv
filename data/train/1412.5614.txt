    "we note that the longitudinal resistance obtained from the boltzmann equation at a @xmath149 perpendicular field is likely to be an overestimate , because at large perpendicular fields additional `` skipping''-orbit channels appear from that are missing in the boltzmann approach .",
    "these would cause an increase of the hall conductivity @xmath150 and a decrease in the longitudinal resistance .      when the wave functions of the conducting electrons have a non - trivial orbital and spin character , like in multiband spin - orbit coupled materials , new intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms that are absent in simpler systems show up in determining the transport properties of complex materials .",
    "three different mechanisms that are well known studied in the framework of the anomalous hall effect can be discussed and systematically included in the boltzmann transport description@xcite .    the first correction to eqs .   and",
    "is not dependent on the scattering process , because it follows from an intrinsic property of the band structure . the non - trivial berry curvature @xmath151 of the bands in presence of spin - orbit coupling acts as a magnetic field in the momentum space and couples to the electric field to give an additional velocity @xmath152 to the quasi - particle in the state @xmath153 . as said before the topological correction does not depend on the details of the scattering .",
    "so it can be dominant or subdominant ( with respect to the mechanisms we discuss below ) depending on the strength of the disorder and the density of impurities . however , its contribution to the ( transversal ) conductivity always remains of the order of the conductance quantum .",
    "we find that both measured and calculated longitudinal conductivities are much larger than @xmath154 . in comparison with the longitudinal magnetoresistance which is of the order of the total resistance it can",
    "thus only give rise to small corrections .",
    "we do not consider these here .",
    "the two mechanisms that we discuss below instead explicitly depend on the scattering processes .",
    "the first correction originates from asymmetric ( _ skew _ ) scattering of polarized electrons accelerated by an electric field . as we do in the main text impurity scattering",
    "is commonly treated in the lowest born approximation , where the transition rate is given by the fermi golden rule @xmath155 .",
    "one of the limitations of this approximation is that it does not take into account the skew scattering , because @xmath156 is clearly symmetric upon exchange of the initial and final states . in order to include antisymmetric corrections ,",
    "the rate must be computed including higher orders in the perturbative expansion of the full scattering @xmath22-matrix .",
    "the first skew term is proportional to @xmath157 . at this order ,",
    "the semiclassical equation is still fully consistent compared to a rigorous quantum mechanical calculation . in the weak disorder limit ( to linear order in the impurity density @xmath80 ) the antisymmetric component of the transition probability",
    "is @xmath158,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath159 where the disorder average has been introduced .",
    "notice that naturally @xmath160 violates the detailed - balance condition , but still an important sum - rule is satisfied .",
    "@xmath161 we do not consider further contributions on the order @xmath162 , here .",
    "in addition to skew - scattering , the electronic wave packet accelerated by an electric field is subjected to the shift @xmath163 ( _ side - jump _ ) of its center of mass during a scattering event .",
    "the gauge - invariant expression for the coordinate shift can be expressed in terms of the pancharatnam - berry phase @xmath164 @xcite , @xmath165 @xmath166 the presence of the side - jump has two effects on the transport .",
    "first , the accumulation of coordinate shifts after many scattering events gives ( in the lowest born approximation ) a correction to the velocity @xmath167 .",
    "second , a particle scattered by an impurity under side - jump acquires a kinetic energy @xmath168 in order to compensate the change in the potential energy induced by the electric field . as a consequence ,",
    "the equilibrium distribution @xmath69 experiences an additional shift : @xmath169 including all the terms , the conductivity tensor is given by @xmath170 where @xmath171 is the two - dimensional antisymmetric tensor and @xmath172 solves the modified boltzmann equation @xcite      discarding the intrinsic berry - curvature correction , we numerically solve equation for scattering from correlated impurities where the amplitude of the disorder potential is uniformly distributed in the asymmetric range @xmath174 $ ] ( notice that for a symmetric distribution the gaussian correlator @xmath175 appearing in the skew - scattering term automatically vanishes ) .",
    "however , we find that the product of the three overlaps @xmath176 is strictly real for arbitrary momenta and band indices when the magnetic field is applied in the plane of the 2des . hence both the skew - scattering and the side - jump terms turn out to be zero for in - plane field .",
    "although here we computed the pancharatnam - berry phase numerically , it is easy to analytically show the same result but for the simpler case of the rashba hamiltonian . in momentum space ,",
    "the rashba hamiltonian has a 2x2 matrix structure .",
    "hence the relevant product of wavefunction overlaps , or more precisely , the argument of this quantity ( the pancharatnam - berry phase ) is equivalent to half the solid angle the bloch states @xmath177 , @xmath178 , and @xmath179 span on the bloch sphere . since for an in - plane zeeman term the rashba hamiltonian may be expanded solely in terms of the pauli matrices @xmath49 , @xmath180 , and @xmath181 , this solid angle vanishes identically .",
    "the same phenomenon leads to the vanishing of the side - jump .",
    "if an out - of - plane magnetic field is switched on , all the contributions become finite , but we find them to remain small throughout our simulations . more explicitly , for the same choice of parameters of the calculations in the main text we observe numerically that both skew - scattering and side - jump contributions yield corrections less than 1% of the calculated total magnetoresistance resistance for out - of - plane fields up to @xmath149 and distributions as asymmetric as @xmath182 .",
    "we do not show these results here as they are almost invisible on the scale of fig .",

    "<S> this is accompanied by a quasi - particle lifetime which can be significantly smaller for the inner band ( smaller average @xmath95 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the imbalance of band mobilities promotes the importance of inter - band scattering when transport is dominated by quasi - particles in the outer bands which have a larger fermi velocity and a small intra - band back - scattering rate . in comparison </S>",

    "<S> our theoretical curves show a smooth dependence on temperature , with the negative magnetoresistance persisting beyond 20  k , and they show a striking correspondence between the temperature dependence of the magnetoresistance for a fixed density and the density dependence for a fixed temperature . </S>",
    "<S> this correspondence , a hallmark of our experimental data , can be understood as a consequence of the renormalization of the chemical potential as a function of temperature , see fig .  </S>",

    "<S> these are the two key arguments in favor of a single - particle spin - orbit - coupling based mechanism for the giant negative magnetoresistance : firstly , the persistence of the effect to elevated temperatures , and secondly the corresponding effect of temperature - increase and density - decrease . </S>",
    "<S> it seems difficult to incorporate these features of the data in the correlated - electron mechanism @xcite , based on kondo - screening of magnetic moments . </S>",
    "<S> there is a third noteworthy feature of the data that is not well reproduced by our calculation , and has been interpreted as evidence for a transition into a low - field kondo phase @xcite : a rescaling of the magnetic field @xmath100 by a density - dependent value @xmath98 collapses the measured magnetoresistance at different densities onto a single curve , see fig .  </S>",

    "<S> the boltzman transport equation with spin - orbit coupling , in combination with anisotropy of fermi surface and scattering rates , suffices to produce a large resistance drop upon application of a magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> the characteristic temperature and carrier - density dependence agree quite well with what is observed experimentally , but the @xmath97 scaling will likely require an extension of the simplest three - band model .    </S>",
    "<S> our explanation of the sudden onset of the magnetoresistance when the carrier density approaches a `` sweet spot '' of amplified spin - orbit coupling has addressed the normal - state transport above the superconducting transition temperature . </S>",
    "<S> since superconductivity happens in the vicinity of the same `` sweet spot '' , it would be interesting to investigate whether spin - orbit coupling plays a dominant role in that transition as well .    </S>",
