    "anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) are thought to be magnetars , which are strongly magnetized ( @xmath3  @xmath1 g ) neutron stars with emissions powered by the dissipation of the magnetic energy ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "the spectra of the axp had been modelled well by the compound of a blackbody and a power - law function below @xmath4 kev region .",
    "besides , two temperature blackbody spectrum was also fit well for some axps @xcite . on the other hand , separate hard x - ray emission was discovered for some axps above @xmath4 kev @xcite .",
    "axp 1e 1841 - 045 is located on the center of the supernova remnant ( snr ) kes 73 ( g 27.4 + 0.0 ) with diameter of about 4@xmath5 .",
    "the kinematic distance toward the snr was estimated to be between 6 and 7.5 kpc @xcite .",
    "the pulse period of 1e 1841 - 045 was 11.8 s @xcite .",
    "morii et al .",
    "( 2003 ) @xcite reported that the spectrum was fitted well with the model consisting of the blackbody ( @xmath6 kev ) and the power - law function with the hardest photon index among axp ( @xmath7 ) , using chandra data ( 0.6  7.0 kev ) . in this analysis",
    ", they also showed two blackbody model fits well .",
    "kuiper , hermsen , & mendez ( 2004 ) @xcite discovered hard x - ray emission up to @xmath8 kev by using rxte .",
    "1e 1841@xmath9045 and kes 73 were observed by suzaku on 2006 april 1922 , as a target of ao-1 ( pi and co - pi were i.  harrus and m.  morii ) .",
    "suzaku @xcite has two types of x - ray detectors in operation : the x - ray imaging spectrometer ( xis ; @xcite ) and the hard x - ray detector ( hxd ; @xcite ) .",
    "we chose the `` 1/8 window mode '' for xis to obtain the timing resolution of 1 s , which corresponds to 0.08 period interval of this axp s pulsation .",
    "hxd is composed of the pin photodiode and gso scintillators mounted in the well of the collimator shield , whose parts cover 10@xmath970 kev and 40@xmath9600 kev , respectively .",
    "this observation was pointed at ( r.a .",
    ", dec . ) @xmath10 in the hxd nominal pointing mode .",
    "total exposure time requested was 100 ks .",
    "we used cleaned events made by the standard pipeline processing of rev-1.2 .",
    "we selected the source and background regions as the concentric circle and annulus whose central positions were at the peak position of the axp .",
    "the source circular radius was set to be 4.33@xmath5 , and the radii of the inner and outer boundaries of the background annulus were set to be 4.33@xmath5 and 6.00@xmath5 . for the pin analysis , we used background file made by lcfit ( bgd_d ) method of version 1.2ver0611 .",
    "we also applied the additional gti ( good time interval ) selection as well as ordinary gti made by event and background files .",
    "the net exposures for xiss and pin were 95.3 ks and 57.8 ks .",
    "we checked light curves of all xiss and pin binned by 300 , 10 and 1 s. we found no special characteristics due to background variation , instrumental troubles and activities in the axp .",
    "we corrected the photon arrival times into those at the solar barycenter by using ` aebarycen ` ( ver . 2006 - 08 - 02 ) .",
    "we searched periodicity for this light curve by using the ` xronos / powspec ` , and we determined the pulse period precisely by using the ` xronos / efsearch ` .",
    "the obtained pulse period was 11.7830(2 ) s at the epoch of 13845 ( tjd ) plus 68704.31 s. we made the pulse profiles for some energy ranges ( 0.6  3.0 kev , 3.0  10.0 kev , and 12.0  30.0 kev ) ( figure [ fig : prof+hr.ps ] ) .",
    "kev , @xmath11 kev , and @xmath12 kev were shown in the 1st , 2nd and 3rd panels .",
    "pulse profiles of the 1st and 2nd band were double peaked , while the 3rd was single peaked .",
    "the 4th and 5th panels show the hardness ratios of 2nd/1st and 3rd/2nd , respectively .",
    ", width=207 ]",
    "due to point spread function ( psf ) of xrts ( hpd = 2@xmath5 ) @xcite , axp s spectrum could not be spatially separated from snr kes 73 .",
    "then at first we determined the snr spectral model by using chandra archival data .",
    "it was modeled well by a vsedov model .",
    "we used this model as the snr model in the followings .",
    "we then fit the spectrum by @xmath13 .    where @xmath14 was normalization of detectors .",
    "@xmath15 was normalization of snr .",
    "cxb and grxe mean components from the cosmic x - ray background and galactic ridge x - ray emission . cxb + grxe was taken into consideration only for hxd / pin .",
    "cxb + grxe was estimated by using another suzaku data of grxe observation near this field ( @xmath16 , @xmath17 ) . for axp component",
    ", we tried to fit by a power - law function ( pow ) , a blackbody ( bb ) , and bb + bb .",
    "these models were denied .",
    "bb + pow model fit better , but wavy residuals remained . of cause , addition of another component like pow or",
    "bb could improve the fit .",
    "but for bb + pow + bb model , parameters were physically unacceptable .",
    "bb + pow + pow showed possible solution(table [ tab : a ] ) .",
    "alternatively , we noticed that the npex model could give good solution ( table [ tab : a ] ) .",
    "npex is following function : @xmath18 this model was originally developed to explain the spectra of accretion - powered pulsars by makishima et al .",
    "( 1999 ) @xcite .",
    "it approximates spectrum for an unsaturated thermal comptonization .",
    ".results of phase - averaged spectral fits [ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < , < \" , ]              when fit by bb+pow or bb+pow+pow , the variation of parameters in phases was not clear .",
    "all parameters varied . on the other hand , when fit by npex model , photon indices were consistent with constant ( figure [ fig : specvar_phase_1sigma_07080605.ps ] , 2nd and 4th panels ) , while normalizations of power - law ( figure [ fig : specvar_phase_1sigma_07080605.ps ] , 3rd and 5th panels ) and folding energy ( figure [ fig : specvar_phase_1sigma_07080605.ps ] , 1st panel ) varied significantly .",
    "the first peak was dominant by the soft power - law component , while the second peak was dominant by the hard one .",
    "this result was consistent with pulse profile ( figure [ fig : prof+hr.ps ] ) .",
    "the folding energy also varied in the same way as the pulse profile .",
    "it is interesting to compare the npex parameters between this axp and accretion - powered pulsars . @xmath19 and @xmath20 were @xmath21 and @xmath22 for accretion - powered pulsars , while those are @xmath23 and @xmath24 for this axp ( table [ tab : a ] )",
    ". both of this axp are larger than those of accretion powered pulsars by about three . for accretion powered pulsars , power - law component with @xmath25 supplies seed photons for comptonization .",
    "on the other hand , for this axp , the soft power - law component with @xmath26 would supply seed photons .",
    "this steep power - law may be a modified blackbody , which is originated from magnetar s surface and deformed by strong magnetic field of magnetar @xcite .",
    "the @xmath27 parameters can be interpreted as follows .",
    "the comptonization is parameterized by @xmath28 parameter @xcite . for @xmath29 ,",
    "@xmath27 becomes 2 , meaning that the spectrum becomes saturated . for accretion - powered pulsars ,",
    "the emission comes from the accretion column where the plasma density is large , so @xmath28 become large . on the other hand ,",
    "the plasma density of this axp is smaller than those of accretion - powered pulsars .",
    "the @xmath28 parameter become small , then @xmath27 becomes small .",
    "the @xmath28 must be @xmath30 in this axp , so that comptonization process can be effective .",
