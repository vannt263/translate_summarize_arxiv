    "the recent discovery of the possibility to observe the magnetic circular dichroism in the transmission electron microscope@xcite opened a new route to atom - specific magnetic studies with an unprecedented spatial resolution .",
    "this technique was named electron magnetic circular dichroism ( emcd ) .",
    "although principle of this technique shares many common points with x - ray magnetic circular dichroism ( xmcd ) , dynamical electron diffraction has a pronounced effect on the observed spectra .",
    "this brings many subtleties for the interpretation of experiments and the extraction of physical quantities .",
    "in order to turn the technique into a quantitative probe of magnetic properties , it is thus necessary to analyse possible sources of inaccuracies connected with dynamical diffraction .",
    "we will deal with so far the only viable emcd approach , in which the crystal itself is used as beamsplitter@xcite and the emcd signal is obtained as a difference of spectra measured at two detector positions .",
    "we concentrate here on the role of symmetry of the experimental setup geometry , i.e. , relative orientation of incoming beam vs sample orientation vs detector positions .",
    "note that yet before the emcd was discovered , signals of odd and even symmetries were separated in an electron energy loss experiment@xcite , though relation between the signal of odd symmetry and magnetism were not yet noticed .    in a recent publication@xcite",
    "we have described simulations of electron energy - loss near edge structures ( elnes ) .",
    "this theory is based on the bloch wave approach@xcite to the dynamical diffraction effects , including higher - order laue zones .",
    "matrix elements of inelastic transitions are evaluated from first - principles electronic structure .",
    "this method was applied to study emcd in the experimental geometry proposed in the original paper@xcite .",
    "those simulations were done within the systematic row approximation .",
    "inclusion of high order laue zones provides more complete , richer description leading to qualitatively new observations presented in this work .    an important theoretical development for quantitative use of the emcd technique was the derivation of sum rules@xcite , which relate the measured spectra to spin ( @xmath0 ) and orbital ( @xmath1 ) magnetic moments of a studied atom in the sample . among the first quantitative measurements of the @xmath2 ratio are refs .   and , particularly , ref .  , where a method of data treatment and statistical analysis was described .",
    "the sum rules require two measurements in symmetrical conditions for determination of the orbital to spin moments ratio .",
    "when the symmetry condition is fulfilled , sum rules revealed a flexibility of the emcd technique allowing to measure the dichroic signal in the whole diffraction plane .",

    "we refer the reader to the above - mentioned paper@xcite for more details on the simulations .",
    "and @xmath16 is a set of detector positions , for which the two momentum transfer vectors @xmath17 and @xmath18 are perpendicular .",

    "this geometry is based on exciting a systematic row of reflections ( determined by the reciprocal lattice vector @xmath16 ) by tilting the incoming beam @xmath23 a few degrees from some highly symmetric direction , such as @xmath24 , within a plane perpendicular to the selected @xmath16 .",
    "then the incoming beam is tilted a few miliradians further along the systematic row in order to produce a two beam case ( see fig .  3 of ref .  ) .",
    "this is achieved by setting the laue circle center of the incoming beam to @xmath25 .",
    "we define momentum transfer vectors @xmath26 and @xmath27 , with respect to the transmitted and bragg scattered beams , respectively . by taking the excitations @xmath28 and @xmath16 as the diameter of a thales circle ,",
    "then for all detector positions @xmath29 lying on this circle , the projections of @xmath17 and @xmath18 on the diffraction plane are perpendicular .",

    "[ fig : thales ] . in a simple two - beam approximation ,",
    "measuring at these detector positions is formally in the closest analogy to xmcd experiments.@xcite the archetype emcd experiment thus amounts to acquiring two spectra at these two detector positions .",
    "the difference of these spectra is attributed to the magnetic circular dichroism , because in the presence of inversion symmetry the mdff changes sign of its imaginary part , @xmath31,@xcite when moving from detector position ( a ) to ( b ) , see fig .",
    "[ fig : thales ] .",
    "the real part is assumed to stay unchanged and cancel out in the difference .",
    "then the difference spectra would depend only on _ imaginary _ parts of contributing mdffs .",
    "energy integral of the imaginary part of mdff was shown to be proportional to magnetic moments of the studied atom@xcite .",
    "now we will demonstrate , that actually the ( a ) and ( b ) detector positions are , strictly speaking , not symmetric and therefore the signal measured at these two positions differs more than solely by reversing the sign of imaginary parts of contributing mdffs .    the assymetry itself appears due to the tilt of the crystal ( usually approx .",
    "5 to 10 degrees ) .",
    "the situation is schematically drawn in fig .",
    "[ fig : assym2bc ] .",
    "note that 1 ) the outgoing beam wave vectors @xmath20 for the two detector positions have different relative orienation with respect to the crystal lattice ; 2 ) the same is valid for the momentum transfer vectors @xmath32 drawn inside the sample .",
    "these two facts are reflected in two sources of asymmetries : 1 ) different reciprocal wave bloch fields at detector position ( a ) vs detector position ( b ) , and , 2 ) difference in calculated mdffs , which goes beyond the mere change of the sign of the imaginary part .",
    "the difference in outgoing bloch wave fields appears because of the different relative orientations of the ewald spheres for observed outgoing beams with respect to the reciprocal lattice .",
    "note though , that in the systematic row approximation ( sra ) , i.e. , when we take into account only bragg reflections along the @xmath33-axis ( perpendicular to the fig .",
    "[ fig : assym2bc ] plane ) , then the two eigensystems become equal . in such case , from the whole reciprocal lattice",
    "we consider only the systematic row and such simplified geometry acquires a mirror symmetry plane defined by @xmath33 and @xmath23 .",
    "nonetheless , this is an approximation and it is necessary to analyse its validity and appropriateness . of bloch - wave vectors",
    "@xmath34 will differ slightly , see eq .",
    "( 7 ) in ref .  .",
    "this causes a weak asymmetry in scattering cross - sections even within systematic row approximation .",
    "its influence depends on sample thickness and can be seen in 2bc maps of the @xmath2 ratio , fig .",
    "[ fig : ls23 ] . ]",
    "edge calculated in 2bc as a function of thickness within ( top row ) systematic row approximation , and ( bottom row ) including holz .",
    "the @xmath33-axis coincides with the systematic row and the origin of the coordinate system is at the position of the transmitted beam ( in the middle ) .",
    "tick labels of axes are multiples of the bragg - reflection @xmath35 .",
    "the same area of the diffraction plane is used in all subsequent figures .",
    "[ fig:2bcsraholz],width=321 ]    strength of the latter effect depends on the anisotropy of the electron distribution surrounding the excited atoms .",
    "note that this error also increases with larger energy losses , since larger energy loss shortens the @xmath20 more and the angle between related momentum transfer vectors increases . the effect itself introduces differences between the real parts of mdffs , which were expected to be symmetry - related . as a consequence , the difference signal from positions ( a ) and ( b ) will contain not only the imaginary parts ( the magnetic signal ) but also the real parts of mdffs .",
    "figure  [ fig:2bcsraholz ] compares `` up - down '' difference maps calculated within the sra with calculation including higher order laue zones ( holz calculation ) , sec .",
    "[ sec : calc ] .",
    "they display the _ antisymmetric part _ of the signal with respect to the systematic row axis - i.e. , the difference of the diffraction pattern and its mirror image with respect to the systematic row .",
    "we will call them simply _ difference maps _",
    ", contrary to names ` dichroic maps ' or ` dichroic signal ' used in recent literature .",
    "the reason is that in the majority of the experimental geometries this difference signal is only an approximation to the magnetic component .",
    "due to asymmetries these maps contain also a fraction of non - magnetic signal , which can introduce a systematic error into the @xmath2 evaluation .",
    "_ relative difference maps _ are difference maps nomalized by the symmetric part of the signal , i.e. , the difference divided by the sum .",
    "there are several local maxima and minima in the diffraction plane , fig .",
    "[ fig:2bcsraholz ] .",
    "their positions and strengths depend on thickness and , in general , none of them is on the thales circle . remembering that the sum rules allow @xmath2 extraction at any place in diffraction plane , it is obvious that thales circle positions are not the optimal detector position for measurement , when it comes to optimizing signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) . actually , there is no general ` optimal detector position ' .",
    "the optimal detector position is material , thickness and orientation dependent ( see also appendix  [ sec : dichmaps ] ) .",
    "this problem was studied in detail in ref .   from the snr point of view .",
    "the main features of holz calculation are reproduced by the sra , see fig .",
    "[ fig:2bcsraholz ] . however , there are some qualitative changes in the holz simulation , which are not present within sra and the deviations increase with thickness .",
    "two pronounced features appear in the holz maps , which are not present in the sra maps : kikuchi lines and weakly excited bragg spots away from the systematic row .",
    "a kikuchi line and its mirror image can be best seen at thicknesses 40  nm and 50  nm  the skew lines in the upper left and lower left corners of holz maps .",
    "the weakly excited bragg spots are almost invisible in diffraction patterns , but the relative difference maps enhance their visibility .",
    "presence of both these effects in relative maps is a sign of the asymmetry .",
    "ratio maps in the 2bc geometry as a function of thickness calculated within two models : systematic row approximation ( sra , top row ) and full calculation ( bottom row).[fig : ls23],width=321 ]    if these maps would originate solely from imaginary parts of mdffs ( a pure magnetic signal ) , it should be possible to obtain @xmath2 ratio at any position in the diffraction plane .",
    "this follows from the form of spin and orbital sum rules expressions , according to which the dynamical diffraction effects cancel out in the @xmath2 ratio .",
    "we tested this by evaluating the sum - rules expression@xcite @xmath36 throughout the diffraction plane ( here @xmath37 is the difference signal integrated over @xmath38 or @xmath39 edge , respectively ) . on top of the usual sum rules",
    "approximations,@xcite by writing this expression we assume that i ) both spin and orbital momentum vectors are parallel and ii ) the magnetic dipole term is negligible compared to the spin moment .",
    "the results of these simulations are in the fig .",
    "[ fig : ls23 ] , where we compare such evaluation within sra and holz calculation .",
    "the `` @xmath2 ratio '' is by no means constant in the diffraction plane , not even in sra .",
    "therefore , in the following text , we will refer to values in these maps as _",
    "apparent @xmath2 ratio _ to distinguish them from the @xmath2 ratio obtained by electronic structure calculations , which is 0.045 for the energy integration range used in our simulations ( @xmath40ev above the fermi level , see appendix [ sec : eint ] ) .",
    "there are several factors that affect the @xmath2 ratio : 1 ) the assumption of equal radial wavefunctions for both @xmath41 and @xmath42 initial states made in derivation of sum rules , 2 ) slight difference in the direction of the spin and orbital moments due to magneto - crystalline anisotropy , 3 ) magnetism of @xmath43-states and related @xmath44 transitions and @xmath45 cross - terms in inelastic transition matrix elements , and , 4 ) the asymmetry discussed above .",
    "the first effect can be easily quantified by performing a test calculation with equal initial - state radial wavefunctions for both edges .",
    "the fact that @xmath46 and @xmath47 radial wavefunctions are slightly different was observed to decrease the apparent @xmath2 ratio by @xmath48 in the areas weakly affected by other sources of deviations .",
    "this explains the mean value of 0.035 within regions close to the systematic row .",
    "the second effect depends on the strength of magneto - crystalline anisotropy , i.e. , to what extent the @xmath49 and @xmath50 follow the external magnetic field and , particularly , what is the angle between @xmath49 and @xmath50 . considering the vector nature of sum rules@xcite , prefactor of the spin and orbital magnetic moments is actually a vector ( @xmath51 ) and thus the ratio of type @xmath52 may vary with varying @xmath51 if @xmath53 .",
    "this is a tiny effect in bcc - fe , which has extremely low magnetocrystalline anisotropy . as a result , at @xmath54",
    "the angle between spin and orbital moments is below @xmath55 and therefore the error thus introduced is of no practical importance . for systems with strong magnetocrystalline anisotropy this effect might become visible .",
    "that might , in principle , allow to determine the angle between spin and orbital magnetic moment by following the changes of the @xmath2 ratio throughout the diffraction plane .",
    "however , detailed study of this effect goes beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "the asymmetry effect is the most crucial one .",
    "it can lead to a quite large systematic error , when the @xmath2 value is extracted directly from 2bc maps further from the systematic row .",
    "the asymmetry within the sra has a form of quasi - periodic pattern of vertical stripes .",
    "these modulations have a long period and low amplitude at low sample thicknesses , but as the thickness increases , the period shortens and amplitude increases .",
    "this effect can be traced doen to differences of elongations @xmath56 of outgoing beam bloch waves in upper and lower half - planes , which is caused by difference of projections of the outgoing wave vectors @xmath57 and @xmath58 to the sample surface normal ( see also footnote in discussion of asymmetry under fig .  [",
    "fig : assym2bc ] ) .",
    "thickness enters the differential scattering cross - section through factors@xcite @xmath59 , which suggests that at larger thickness the scattering cross - section will be more sensitive to differences in elongations @xmath60 .",
    "the asymmetry within the full holz calculation is stronger and more complex .",
    "notice , for example , that at the position of kikuchi lines the apparent @xmath2 ratio is estimated to be off by an order of magnitude .",
    "deviations are stronger at detector positions , where the magnetic signal becomes weaker .",
    "also , the deviations increase with increasing thickness , which puts an upper limit on sample thicknesses for emcd measurements .",
    "to summarize , it is the asymmetry originating in the complete treatment of the dynamical diffraction , which has the strongest influence on observed @xmath2 ratios in the 2bc .",
    "a more detailed computational study of the asymmetry in the 2bc can be found in ref .  .",
    "still , there is a quite large area in the diffraction plane , where the 2bc geometry allows accurate @xmath2 ratio measurement , fig .",
    "[ fig : ls23 ] .",
    "though , due to dynamical diffraction effects , the shape and position of this area is thickness dependent . therefore it would be of advantage to accompany experiments in 2bc setup with simulations .",
    "eventually , one can perform experiments at varying sample thicknesses to identify regions with biased @xmath2 values .",
    "if a suitable thickness and detector position in diffraction plane is identified , this geometry might be preferred for spectroscopic measurements of emcd , because the two - beam orientation concentrates the magnetic signal to the area inside and close to the thales circle ( compare with three - beam orientation , sec .

    "the calculation is performed on a grid of @xmath64 outgoing beam directions for @xmath65 and @xmath66 in the two - beam orientation .",
    "note that the @xmath67 only marginally influences the total computing time , since it only scales the final summation , which is typically the fastest part of the calculation .",

    "generation of octuple products and @xmath69 lists is @xmath67 independent and only marginally @xmath68 dependent ( it only influences the output of @xmath69 list ) .",
    "note that the diffaction pattern appears to be reasonably converged already for @xmath70 .",
    "an attentive reader might spot slightly fuzziness , but nevertheless , the difference between all five diffraction patterns are visually negligible .",
    "the relative difference map requires better convergence , at least @xmath71 , or better @xmath72 .",
    "note the numerical noise at @xmath71 , particularly along the vertical line going through the transmitted beam .",
    "although a slight fuzziness remains at @xmath71 , but the accuracy is already satisfactory . the most sensitive quantity presented here is the apparent @xmath2 ratio . since the orbital momentum in iron is small , the nominator in the sum rule expression is a difference of two ( typically small ) differences of spectra , integrated over @xmath38 or @xmath39 edge , respectivelly .",
    "it requires high accuracy to obtain well converged maps .",
    "calculation with @xmath72 seems to produce reasonably converged results .",
    "the only visible difference at @xmath73 , when compared to @xmath72 , appears around @xmath74 positions .",
    "the results of calculation with @xmath75 are visually indistinguishable from @xmath73 .",
    "so we can conclude that for purposes of this paper the convergence criterion @xmath73 provides highly converged data - particularly when we consider a region of sizable difference signal , where an appreciable the magnetic signal to noise ratio can be expected .",
    "the table  [ tab : conv ] summarizes somewhat more technical information about the computational complexity .",
    "we show the average lengths of lists of bloch - coefficient products , which scale moreless inverse - proportionally to the convergence parameter .",
    "the computing time apparently grows slowlier , but one should take into account a constant everhead in these calculations connected with two diagonalizations of complex matrices of dimension ca .  630 and the start - up and initialization costs of mdff calculation , which are both repeated @xmath64 times .",
    "these overheads are estimated to be roughly around 2 hours .",
    "after subtraction of that a moreless linear scaling of the computation time with inverse @xmath63 is observed .",
    "we note that the computing time is typically by factor 10 - 15 longer for zone axis calculations .",
    "the whole algorithm is trivial to parallelize , since each pixel in the diffraction plane is calculated independently .",
    "therefore practically a linear scaling with number of processors is achieved . for applications , where only the diffraction pattern is needed",
    ", the method delivers accurate results at affordable computing time .",
    "an important corollary of the sum - rules is , that the imaginary part of energy integrated mdff does contain the magnetic information regardless of the relative orientation of @xmath17 and @xmath18 momentum transfer vectors .",
    "the only exceptions are parallel or antiparallel orientations , respectively , when the imaginary part is zero ( within dipole approximation ) .",
    "this implies , that the detector placement is by no means limited to the thales circle positions ( fig .",
    "[ fig : assym ] ) .",
    "in other words , the thales circle positions have no special importance .",
    "we have presented a set of simulations varying the detector position to scan a part of the diffraction plane , which lead to difference maps related to magnetic signal .",
    "these maps provided several findings : i ) the maximum of the dichroic signal is , as anticipated , at places other than at the thales circle positions ; ii ) there can be several local maxima and minima in the diffraction plane ; iii ) the pattern of the dichroic signal sensitively depends on the sample thickness and orientation .",
    "this means , that the question of the optimal detector positions actually does not have a unique general answer .",
    "there are orientations and thicknesses , when the optimal detector positions are quite different from thales circle positions .",
    "all this is also sample dependent .",
    "therefore in actual experiments it would be advantageous to have access to such maps of the dichroic signal .",
    "such experiments actually have been already done.@xcite    another application of the above - mentioned corollary of sum - rules is the possibility to integrate the dichroic signal over some part of the diffraction plane . because the prefactors in spin and orbital sum - rules are the same , the signal from a range of detector positions can be collected .",
    "this can be done either by numerically integrating within the map of dichroic signal@xcite or by having a suitable collection aperture .",
    "this observation is related to the question of optimizing the snr - selection of the optimal size , shape and placement of the spectrometer entrance aperture.@xcite [ alternative approach of improving snr of a measured physical quantity - @xmath2 ratio - was developed in ref .  , where a statistical analysis was performed within @xmath2 maps .",

    "there is one exception though , which is the energy integration range in @xmath2 evaluation",
    ". this should be in principle infinite , @xmath76 .",
    "since the mdff evaluation is the most time - consuming step of calculations , the energy integration range was reduced to a small interval @xmath77 with 11 equally spaced energy values .",

    "these values would converge to ground state spin and orbital moments of @xmath79-states , which are represented by horizontal lines .",
    "the evolution of both spin and orbital momentum as a function of energy is different , therefore also the ` apparent ' @xmath2 ratio will depend on the energy range .",

    "they are simply absorbed into the beam tilt  and one only has to deal with deviations along @xmath86 ( the @xmath33 axis is along the systematic row ) . ]",
    "it was demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : lsdd ] that double difference correction significantly extends the area , where an accurate @xmath2 ratio extraction is possible . here",
    "we will briefly discuss , why this correction works .    by slightly tilting the beam towards positive @xmath86 , the intensity throughout the diffraction pattern increases in the right half - plane at all energy levels .",
    "particularly , this happens for the nonmagnetic component of the intensity .",
    "we assume that the increase is similar in upper and lower half - planes , i.e. , @xmath87 , while @xmath88 is of different sign .",
    "then the left - right difference will contain an error proportional to @xmath89 , which increases the magnitude of magnetic signal on one edge and decreases it on the other edge ( assuming that they are of different sign ) .",
    "this biases the observed @xmath2 value .",
    "additionally , this error influences the upper and lower half - plane in opposite ways and thus the extracted @xmath2 ratio differs in upper and lower half - planes .",
    "if we perform a ` left - right ' difference , the nonmagnetic components from the exact 3bc orientation cancel out and only the `` error '' superimposed on magnetic signal remains .",
    "subsequent ` up - down ' difference enhances the magnetic signal and , simultaneously , reduces the error thanks to its approximate up / down symmetry mentioned above : @xmath87 .",
    "remaining error , @xmath90-[\\delta i(-k_x , k_y)-\\delta i(-k_x ,- k_y)]$ ] , is considerably smaller than asymmetry in pure ` up - down ' or ` left - right ' differences , respectively . to verify these assumptions quantitatively we calculated separately the magnetic and nonmagnetic contribution to the scattering cross - section for the slightly misoriented 3bc with @xmath82 .",
    "this amounts to two separate calculations considering either only real parts ( non - magnetic component ) or imaginary parts ( magnetic contribution ) of mdffs , respectively .",
    "the difference maps of the non - magnetic part of the signal ( @xmath91 ; not shown ) are directly related to the error introduced by asymmetries . very instructive is to show a ratio @xmath92 , i.e. , the difference of non - magnetic signal divided by the corresponding difference of the magnetic signal .",
    "such maps describe the relative enhancement of the apparent magnetic signal due to non - magnetic contribution .",

    "[ fig : re23bc ] for ` left - right ' , ` up - down ' and double difference , respectively .",
