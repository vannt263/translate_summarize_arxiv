    "lepton flavor violating ( lfv ) interactions are rich to analyze since they exist in the loop level and they are sensitive the physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "on the other hand they are clean theoretically because they are free from the nonperturbative effects .",
    "the experimental work done and the numerical results obtained stimulate the theoretical studies on these decays .",
    "the @xmath2 and @xmath3 processes are among the lfv decays and the experimental the current limits for their branching ratios ( br ) have been predicted as @xmath4 @xcite and @xmath5 @xcite , respectively .",
    "there is an extensive theoretical work done on the lfv decays in the literature .",
    "such interactions are studied in a model independent way in @xcite , in the seesaw model @xcite , in the framework of the two higgs doublet model ( 2hdm ) @xcite , in supersymmetric models @xcite .    in the present work we study @xmath6 , @xmath1 decay in the model version of the 2hdm with the inclusion of the non - universal extra dimensions .",
    "this process exists at least at one loop level in the model iii .",
    "the lepton flavor violation is driven by the internal scalar bosons @xmath7 and @xmath8 and the transition @xmath9 is obtained .",
    "furthermore the internal z boson connects this transition to the @xmath10 output ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1ver ] ) .",
    "notice that we respect the assumption of the non - existence of cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) type matrix in the leptonic sector and vanishing charged flavor changing ( fc ) interactions",
    ".    with the inclusion of additional dimensions there may be an enhancement in the br of the decay under consideration .",
    "the extra dimensions have been studied in the literature extensively @xcite-@xcite .",
    "these new dimensions could not be detected at present and the most favorable description is their compactification on a surface with small radii . from the 4d point of view",
    "this compactification results in kaluza - klein ( kk ) modes of the particles with masses regulated by the parameter @xmath11 , which is a typical size of the extra dimension . if all the fields are accessible to the extra dimensions , the extra dimensional momentum , and therefore , the kk number at each vertex is conserved .",
    "such extra dimensions are called universal extra dimensions ( ued ) and they are studied in various works @xcite in the literature . if the extra dimensions are accessible to some fields but not all in the theory , such type of extra dimensions are called non - universal extra dimensions ( nued ) ( see for example @xcite ) . in this case the kk number at each vertex is not conserved and tree level interaction of kk modes with the ordinary particles can exist .    in our work we take the extra dimensions as non - universal and assume that the first higgs doublet and the gauge fields are accessible to the extra dimensions , however the leptons , the quarks and the second higgs doublet , which contains new higgs particles , live in the 4d brane . in this case the contributions due to the additional dimensions comes from the internal z boson kk modes after the compactification of the external dimensions on orbifold @xmath12 ( ( @xmath13 ) for a single ( two ) extra dimensions .",
    "we observe that there is almost two orders larger enhancement on the br of the process we study in the case of two nued .",
    "this enhancement is obviously due to the abundance of @xmath14 boson kk modes .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , we present the theoretical expression for the decay width of the lfv decay @xmath0 , @xmath1 , in the framework of the model iii , with the inclusion of one and two nueds .",
    "section 3 is devoted to discussion and our conclusions . in the appendix section ,",
    "we give explicit expressions of the functions appearing in the general effective vertex for the interaction of off - shell z - boson with a fermionic current .",
    "the lfv @xmath15 decay exists at least in the one loop level and , therefore , the physical quantities like the br contains rich information about the model used and the free parameters existing .",
    "the extension of the higgs sector in the sm makes the flavor violation ( fv ) possible with the help of the new yukawa interactions coming from the new higgs scalars . in the multi higgs doublet models , the flavor changing neutral current ( fcnc ) at tree level , which induces the fv interactions , can appear and the general 2hdm , so called model iii , is one of the candidate .",
    "the additional yukawa interactions arising from new higgs doublet are responsible for the non vanishing theoretical values of the physical quantities like the br .",
    "the inclusion of extra dimensions may bring further contributions to these physical quantities . in the present work",
    "we assume that the first higgs doublet and the gauge fields feel the extra dimensions , however , the leptons , the quarks and the second higgs doublet , which contains new higgs particles , live in the 4d brane . with the addition of single ( double ) extra dimension , the yukawa interaction , including the lfv part in the model iii , reads @xmath16 where @xmath17 are family indices of leptons , @xmath18 and @xmath11 denote chiral projections @xmath19 , @xmath20 for @xmath21 , are the two scalar doublets , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are lepton doublets and singlets respectively . here @xmath24 are @xmath25-dimensional dimensionful , @xmath26 are dimensionless yukawa couplings and @xmath27 can be rescaled to the ones in 4-dimension as @xmath28 , @xmath11 is the compactification radius and @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) is the coordinate represents the @xmath25th dimension .",
    "the coupling @xmath26 , which has complex entries in general , is responsible for the fcnc at tree level . with @xmath31",
    "where `` n '' denotes the word `` neutral '' . ] at this stage we take two higgs doublets @xmath32 and @xmath33 as @xmath34\\ , ; \\phi_{2}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left(\\begin{array}{c c } \\sqrt{2 } h^{+}\\\\ h_1+i h_2 \\end{array}\\right ) \\,\\ , , \\label{choice}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] respecting that only the first one has a vacuum expectation value but not the second , namely , @xmath35 therefore the cp even neutral higgs particles @xmath36 and @xmath37 do not mix in the tree level and they are obtained as the mass eigenstates @xmath7 and @xmath37 respectively . the neutral higgs particle @xmath38 is the well known cp odd @xmath8 . in this case , the sm particles lie in the first doublet and the new particles in the second one .",
    "the lfv @xmath15 decay is induced by @xmath39 transition and @xmath40 process ( see fig . [ fig1ver ] ) .",
    "the @xmath41 transition , which needs the fcnc at tree level , is driven by the internal new neutral higgs bosons @xmath7 and @xmath8 , which are living in the 4d brane . since the gauge fields are accessible to the extra dimensions , the internal @xmath14 boson has kk modes , which have additional contribution to the physical quantities related to the decay studied .",
    "the kk modes of gauge fields appear after the compactification of the external dimensions on the orbifold @xmath12 ( ( @xmath13 ) for a single ( two ) extra dimensions and , for two extra dimensions , the gauge fields can be expanded to the kk modes as : @xmath42 where @xmath43 , @xmath44 , the indices @xmath45 and @xmath46 are positive integers including zero , but both are not zero at the same time .",
    "the kk modes of the gauge field @xmath14 have the masses @xmath47 , where @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "notice that the gauge boson mass matrix is diagonal since the higgs field , which has the non - zero vacuum expectation value , is in the bulk ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "here , we take the compactification radius @xmath11 as the same for both new dimensions . in the case of a single extra dimension , one should set @xmath50 , take @xmath51 , and drop the summation over @xmath46 in eq .",
    "( [ gauge1 ] ) .",
    "now , we present the general effective vertex for the interaction of off - shell z - boson with a fermionic current @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the momentum transfer , @xmath54 , @xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) is the four momentum vector of incoming ( outgoing ) lepton and the explicit expressions for the functions @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 are given in the appendix section .",
    "the matrix element @xmath61 of the @xmath62 process is obtained with the internal @xmath14 boson connection between the @xmath63 transition and the @xmath64 pair . since the gauge fields are accessible to the extra dimensions , the kk modes of the internal @xmath14 boson have additional contributions to the process ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1ver ] ) .",
    "notice that the kk number need not to be conserved in the vertices where @xmath14 boson appears since the the extra dimensions in this case are so called nued . using the matrix element",
    "@xmath61 the decay width @xmath65 of the decay under consideration can be obtained in the @xmath66 lepton rest frame with the help of the well known expression @xmath67 where @xmath55 ( @xmath68 , i=1,2,3 ) is four momentum vector of @xmath66 lepton ( @xmath69 lepton , incoming @xmath70 , outgoing @xmath70 ) .",

    "@xmath73 ; @xmath74 and they need to be restricted by using the present and forthcoming experiments . in our work , we take only the @xmath66 lepton as an internal lepton and , therefore , we choose the couplings @xmath75 and @xmath76 as non - zero . here",
    "we expect that the couplings which contain at least one @xmath66 index are dominant similar to the cheng - sher scenario @xcite .",
    "the upper limit of the coupling @xmath77 has been estimated as @xmath78 ( see @xcite and references therein ) by assuming that the new physics effects can not exceed experimental uncertainty @xmath79 in the measurement of the muon anomalous magnetic moment . in our numerical calculation we choose @xmath80 by respecting this upper limit . since there is no restriction for the yukawa coupling @xmath81 , the numerical values we use are greater than @xmath77 .",
    "this work is devoted to the a single and two nued effects on the br of the lfv processes @xmath82 , in the type iii 2hdm . in the case of two extra dimensions ,",
    "we observe that the contribution of kk modes enhances the br considerably , due to the crowd of z boson kk modes .",

    "the crowd of z boson kk modes cause to enhance the br of the decay analyzed and these effects can be observable .",
