    "narrow - line seyfert  1 galaxies ( nls1s ; ) are usually found as radio - quiet objects @xcite .",
    "various properties observed through optical and x - ray bands suggest that nls1s are active galactic nuclei  ( agns ) of highly accreting  ( @xmath0 , where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are bolometric and eddington luminosities , respectively ) systems  ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "the radio - quietness of nls1s may be related to the suppression of radio jets emanated from accretion disks with high accretion rates @xcite , as well as the disks of x - ray binaries in the _ high / soft _ state ( see , e.g. ,   for a review ) .    on the other hand , radio - loud nls1s",
    "do exist , although they are very rare @xcite .",
    "there is no significant difference between radio - quiet and radio - loud nls1s in optical and x - ray properties ( sdss  j094857.3 + 002225 ,  @xcite ; rx  j0134.2@xmath34258 ,  @xcite ; rgb  j0044 + 193 ,  @xcite ; pks  2004@xmath3447 ,  @xcite ; pks  0558@xmath3504 ,  @xcite ) .",
    "the origin of the radio excess of the radio - loud nls1s has been unknown .",
    "hardening of x - ray spectra during rapid x - ray flares of the radio - loud nls1 pks  0558@xmath3504 in a few minutes could arise from transient spectral dominance of synchrotron emission from relativistically boosted jets @xcite similar to radio - loud quasars ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "however , properties of radio jets in nls1s are slightly known .",
    "their linear sizes are @xmath4  pc @xcite , which correspond to @xmath5  arcsec resolutions of connected interferometries ; there are only a few images that have been obtained by very - long - baseline interferometry  ( vlbi ) observations  @xcite .    [ cols=\"<,^,>,^,^,^ \" , ]      col .",

    "we estimated the total error from the root sum square of the uncertainty of amplitude calibration and the error in gaussian fitting ( including thermal noise ) .",
    "the total spectra of observed vlba flux densities were slightly inverted ( @xmath6 , @xmath7 ) , which is consistent with past observations .",
    "non - simultaneous observations from 111.5  mjy at 1.4  ghz by the first survey  @xcite and 234  mjy at 8.4  ghz by the jodrell bank vla astrometric survey  @xcite showed an inverted spectrum .",
    "simultaneous observations at 2.7 , 5 , and 10.7  ghz  @xcite showed a spectral index , @xmath8 .",
    "our vla flux densities were consistent with or less than those of the vlba ; this suggests that there is no missing flux in the vlba images of this object .    the vlba flux density at 1.7  ghz decreased to 50% in 19  months .",
    "the flux density at 15  ghz also decreased to 69% in 46  days between the vlba and vla observations .",
    "we believe that these were intrinsic decreases of flux density rather than losses of high - frequency coherence on the vla data .",
    "the vla observations were made in good weather conditions .",
    "the coherence loss should be inhibited to the same level as that of the vlba , since a sufficiently short solution interval , 10  s , was adopted for phase self - calibration to both the vlba and vla data ( section  [ section : observation ] ) .",
    "we can derive brightness temperatures from both the vlba image and the flux variability . using imaging analysis , brightness temperature in the rest frame",
    "is calculated using ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the speed of light , @xmath11 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath12 is the flux density at frequency @xmath13 , @xmath14 is the angular diameter of a source , and suffixes of `` obs '' and `` rest '' denote quantities in the observer frame and the rest frame , respectively .",
    "the doppler factor is defined as @xmath15 , where @xmath16 ( @xmath17 is the source speed ) , and @xmath18 is the `` viewing angle '' between the direction of the source velocity and our line of sight . given an apparent diameter of @xmath190.10  mas for c0 in the 15-ghz vlba data ( section  [ section : resultvlba ] ) , @xmath20  k.    alternatively , with flux variation , a brightness temperature in the rest frame can be calculated independently using ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the comoving distance , @xmath23 is a change of observed flux density in a period , of @xmath24 . in this equation , we assume exponential decay as seen in radio outbursts in blazars @xcite .",
    "we found that the flux density decreases by 31% in 46  days at 15  ghz , and by 50% in 19 months at 1.7  ghz ( section  [ section : resultflux ] ) , which implies that @xmath25  k and @xmath26  k , respectively .",
    "a very high brightness temperature in this source has also been suggested by @xcite from 1.4-ghz flux variation in @xmath27years time scale .",
    "these very high brightness temperatures form clear evidence for a nonthermal process in the central engine of this nls1 .      based on near equipartition of energies between radiating particles and a magnetic field",
    ", the brightness temperature of nonthermal radio emission should be within a physically realistic upper limit of @xmath28  k in the rest frame @xcite .",
    "therefore , the doppler factor should be @xmath295.5 for the observed brightness temperatures",
    "( section  [ section : brightnesstemperature ] ) .",
    "the observed radio emissions are presumably from highly relativistic jets and are enhanced by doppler boosting .",
    "the jets should approach us with a viewing angle of @xmath30 and a speed of @xmath31 for @xmath29 ( section  [ section : brightnesstemperature ] ) .",
    "c1 , spatially resolved in the vlba data ( section  [ section : resultvlba ] ) , may be one of the expanding jet components .",
    "because of the very high brightness temperature , synchrotron self - absorption could be a possible explanation for the inverted spectrum as observed .",
    "we show an example of spectral model fitting to the observed vlba total fluxes using power - law spectra with a low - frequency cut - off due to synchrotron self - absorption : @xmath32 $ ] , where @xmath33 is a scaling constant , @xmath34 is the optical depth , and @xmath35 is the intrinsic ( not absorbed ) spectral index .",
    "spectral model fitting was performed on the assumptions that the observed spectrum of c0 is caused by a superposition of self - absorbed synchrotron spectra of two components , and that the observed spectrum of c1 can be represented by a single power - law spectrum . as a result ,",
    "c0 consists of two convex spectra with peak frequencies at @xmath2716  ghz  ( `` c0a '' ) and @xmath273  ghz  ( `` c0b '' ) , as shown in fig .  [ figure2 ] .",
    "the doppler boosting can be responsible for such high frequencies of the spectral peaks , since @xmath36 \\nu_\\mathrm{rest}$ ] .",
    "the intrinsic peak frequencies could be at several hundreds of mhz .",
    "such high - frequency peaked spectra are reminiscent of those of the seyfert galaxy iii  zw  2 with two compact radio components and an inverted high - frequency spectrum in total flux @xcite . these components in iii",
    "zw  2 are also highly relativistic jets @xcite .     and one simple power - law spectrum ( c1 as a dashed line ) .",
    "the spatially single component c0 was divided into two spectrally separate components , c0a and c0b with peak frequencies of @xmath2716 and 3  ghz , respectively .",
    "see section  [ section : relativisticjet ] for details . ]",
    "our observations showed a slightly inverted spectrum at @xmath275  ghz and @xmath37 , which is derived from @xmath38  mag @xcite and the vlba total flux density at 5  ghz .",
    "given @xmath39 ( section  [ section : brightnesstemperature ] ) , the peak frequency of c0a , @xmath2716  ghz , should be @xmath192.9  ghz before doppler beaming . in the case where @xmath40 , a flux density should be amplified by a factor of @xmath41462 from an intrinsic spectrum at the same frequency .",
    "therefore , there is a possibility that sdss  j094857.3 + 002225 is a radio - quiet object with a steep spectrum in the rest frame , like typical nls1s @xcite .",
    "flat or inverted radio spectra have also been found in the other radio - loud nls1s , e.g. , rgb  0044 + 193 @xcite , 2e  1640 + 5345 , rxs  j16290 + 4007 , and rx  j16446 + 2619 @xcite .",
    "doppler boosting may be responsible for their spectra and radio loudness as well as those of sdss  j094857.3 + 002225 .",
    "the observed optical and x - ray properties and black - hole masses of radio - loud nls1s are not significantly different from those of radio - quiet ones ( e.g. , @xcite ) . from our observations",
    ", we suggest that the doppler factor is a crucial parameter determining the radio loudness of nls1s : at least some of nls1s could possess the ability to generate highly relativistic jets .",
    "analogies have been drawn between x - ray binaries and agns ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "nls1s are thought to be agns with high accretion rates .",
    "although x - ray binaries in the _ high / soft _ state with accretion rates of @xmath420.1 have no relevance to jets , strong radio flares have been seen during the _ very high _ state , which is thought to be a disk in @xmath43 , such as grs  1915 + 105 , with highly relativistic jets ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "sdss  j094857.3 + 002225 has the potential to be compatible with the _ very high _ state , rather than the _",
    "high / soft _ state .",
    "radio - loud nls1s will be appropriate targets to investigate for the _ very high _ state on super - massive black hole systems .",
    "our vlba and vla observations have revealed that sdss  j094857.3 + 002225 , which shows the highest known radio loudness for an nls1 , has ( 1 )  significant variability on time scales of 46  days and 19  months , ( 2 )  an inverted spectrum , and ( 3 )  multiple components with a size @xmath190.10  mas .",
    "the derived brightness temperatures were significantly higher than the intrinsic limit , implying doppler - beaming with a doppler factor @xmath295.5 and , therefore , relativistic jets .",
    "at least some nls1s could be able to generate highly relativistic jets .",
    "we suggest that the doppler factor is a crucial parameter determining the radio loudness of nls1s . on the analogy of x - ray binaries , sdss  j094857.3 + 002225",
    "is probably equivalent to an agn in the _ very high _ state rather than the _",
    "high / soft _ state , because of the highly relativistic jets .",
