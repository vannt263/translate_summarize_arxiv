    "pulsating stars on the upper main sequence , and particularly @xmath7 scuti and @xmath0 cephei stars , are rapid rotators as well as being multimode pulsators . the ratio @xmath8 of the rotation rate @xmath9 to the typical frequency of oscillations @xmath10 seen in these stars is no longer a small quantity as it is for e.g. the sun .",
    "these stars have typically equatorial velocities @xmath11 , and oscillation periods from half to a few hours which implies @xmath12 , whereas for the sun @xmath13 . in order to achieve the full potential of asteroseismology for testing of models for upper main sequence stars a more careful treatment of the effect of rotation on oscillation frequencies",
