    "recently , the observations of high redshift type ia supernovae and the surveys of clusters of galaxies @xcite@xcite reveal the universe accelerating expansion and that the density of matter is very much less than the critical density .",
    "also the observations of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies indicate that the universe is flat and the total energy density is very close to the critical one @xcite .",
    "the above observational data properly complete each other and point out that the dark energy ( de ) is the dominant component of the present universe which occupies about @xmath0 of the energy of our universe , while dark matter ( dm ) occupies @xmath1 , and the usual baryonic matter about @xmath2 .",
    "there are prominent candidates for de such as the cosmological constant @xcite , a dynamically evolving scalar field ( like quintessence ) @xcite or phantom ( field with negative energy ) @xcite that explain the cosmic accelerating expansion .",
    "meanwhile , the accelerating expansion of universe can also be obtained through modified gravity @xcite , brane cosmology and so on @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite @xcite @xcite .",
    "two of the most serious issues with regards to the de models , in particular with cosmological constant as a candidate , are the fine tuning problem and cosmic coincidence problem .",
    "the absence of a fundamental mechanism which sets the cosmological constant to zero or very small value is the cosmological constant `` fine - tuning '' problem and a good model should limit the fine tuning as much as possible . the problem of comparability of the de density and the dm energy density at the recent epoch known as the coincidence problem and one of the most frequently used approach to moderate the cosmological coincidence problem is the tracker field de scenario @xcite .",
    "the de can track the evolution of the background matter in the early stage , and only recently , it has negative pressure , and becomes dominant .",
    "thus , its current condition is nearly independent of the initial conditions @xcite@xcite .    on the other hand , to explain the early and late time acceleration of the universe .",
    "it is most often the case that such fields interact with matter ; directly due to a matter lagrangian coupling , indirectly through a coupling to the ricci scalar or as the result of quantum loop corrections @xcite@xcite .",
    "if the scalar field self - interactions are negligible , then the experimental bounds on such a field are very strong ; requiring it to either couple to matter much more weakly than gravity does , or to be very heavy @xcite@xcite .",
    "unfortunately , such scalar field is usually very light and its coupling to matter should be tuned to extremely to small values in order not to be conflict with the equivalence principal @xcite .    an alternative attempt to overcome the problem with light scalar fields",
    "has been suggested in chameleon cosmology @xcite@xcite . in the proposed model , a scalar field couples to matter with gravitational strength , in harmony with general expectations from string theory",
    "whilst at the same time remaining very light on cosmological scales .",
    "the scalar field which is very light on cosmological scales is permitted to couple to matter much more strongly than gravity does , and yet still satisfies the current experimental and observational constraints .",
    "the cosmological value of such a field evolves over hubble time - scales and could potentially cause the late - time acceleration of our universe @xcite .",
    "the crucial feature that these models possess are that the mass of the scalar field depends on the local background matter density . while the idea of a density - dependent mass term is not new @xcite@xcite , the work presented in @xcite @xcite is novel in that the scalar field can couple directly to matter with gravitational strength .    considering the possible interaction between de and background matter @xcite ,",
    "the whole system ( including the background matter and de ) may be eventually attracted into the scaling attractor , a balance achieved , thanks to the interaction . in the scaling attractor ,",
    "the effective densities of de and background matter decrease in the same manner with the expansion of our universe , and the ratio of de and background matter becomes a constant .",
    "so , it is not strange that we are living in an epoch when the densities of de and dm are comparable . in this sense , the cosmological coincidence problem is moderated .",
    "the dynamical attractor of the cosmological system has been employed to make the late time behaviors of the model insensitive to the initial condition of the field and thus moderates the fine tuning problem .    in this paper",
    ", we assign two important roles to the chameleon scalar field to describe the late time acceleration of the universe and possibly predict the fate of the universe .",
    "its first role as already expressed is that the chameleon field which is very light on cosmological scales and its mass strongly depend on the local background matter density satisfies the current experimental and observational constraints .",
    "its second role is that since the field mimics the background ( radiation / matter ) matter field , subdominant for most of the evolution history except at late times when it becomes dominant , it may be regarded as a cosmological tracker field .",
    "tracker models are independent of initial conditions used for field evolution but do require the tuning of the slope of the scalar field potential . during the scaling regime",
    "the field energy density is of the same order of magnitude as the background energy density .",
    "this work is different from that of ref .",
    "@xcite in which we assume that the coupling function to the matter is exponential while in there a linear coupling to the matter is assumed .",
    "our work also differs from that of ref .",
    "@xcite in that the potential function for the chameleon field in there is in exponential form that in its series expansion is a constant plus corrections in terms of a stability parameter .",
    "in this section we consider the chameleon gravity with the action , @xmath3\\sqrt{-g}dx^{4},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath4 is ricci scalar , @xmath5 is the newtonian constant gravity and @xmath6 is the chameleon scalar field with a potential @xmath7 .",
    "the modified matter is @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is an analytic function of @xmath6 and describe the nonminimal interaction between the matter and chameleon field . in a spatially flat frw cosmology , the variation of action",
    "( [ action ] ) with respect to the metric tensor components leads to the field equations , @xmath10 where we put @xmath11 and @xmath12 with @xmath13 the scale factor . we assume a perfect fluid with @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the contribution from the matter to the energy density . in the following we assumed that the matter in the universe is cold dark matter ( cdm ) with @xmath16 .",
    "variation of the action ( [ action ] ) with respect to scalar field @xmath6 gives the wave equation for chameleon field as , @xmath17 where prime indicated differentiation with respect to @xmath6 . from equations ( [ fried1 ] ) , ( [ fried2 ] ) and ( [ phiequation ] )",

    ", we introduced @xmath23 and call it `` chameleon energy density '' .",

    "shows the dynamic of the eos parameter , @xmath47 , the interaction term @xmath25 and @xmath48 .",
    "as illustrated , the phantom crossing occurs at two different situations , for @xmath49 at @xmath50 when @xmath51 . or alternatively for @xmath52 , the phantom crossing does not occur",

    "the phantom crossing occurs at @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
