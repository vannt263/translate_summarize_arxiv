    "it is widely believed that one needs to construct a quantum theory of gravity . in two of the leading approaches , string theory @xcite and lqg @xcite , the marriage of quantum theory and gravity needs some new essential input(s ) . in the ambitious string theory ,",
    "one such input is extra dimensions still retaining framework of continuum space - time geometry . in lqg ,",
    "the new feature that emerges is the discrete nature of the spatial _ geometry _ ( as distinct from manifold structure ) .",
    "it is also a fact that for most purposes , classical continuum geometry and the einstein equations suffice to an excellent approximation .",
    "it is thus a natural question : how much deviations from classical general relativity ( gr ) are predicted from the more refined quantum versions ?    in order to address such a question in some quantitative manner , it is necessary to be able to identify physical contexts in which the more refined theory can be computed in sufficiently explicit terms .",
    "a natural context is that of homogeneous cosmologies or even simpler , that of homogeneous and isotropic cosmologies . in this context",
    "the geometry is described in terms of a single variable of a single coordinate  the scale factor",
    " while matter can be effectively restricted to scalar field(s ) with possibly non - minimal couplings ( eg dilaton ) . even within the cosmological context",
    ", there are regimes of small volume ( closer to the classical singularity ) and regimes of large volume where classical gr is expected to be an excellent approximation . in this work ,",
    "we obtain deviations from gr in the large volume regime , as implied by loop quantum cosmology @xcite , as a function of the barbero - immirzi parameter @xmath0 ( and another order 1 dimensionless parameter @xmath2 ) .    in the previous works on obtaining an effective hamiltonian @xcite ,",
    "a two step approach was taken , namely , a continuum approximation wherein the fundamental difference equation is replaced by a _",
    "second order _ differential equation ( wheeler - dewitt equation ) followed by a wkb approximation of the differential equation .",
    "we will refer to the first step as the _ pre - classical approximation _",
    "the second order differential equation is independent of the barbero - immirzi parameter and the planck constant .",
    "one could go beyond the pre - classical approximation and obtain higher order ( in @xmath0 ) corrections to the effective hamiltonian following the same two step approach . in this work , however , we derive an effective hamiltonian as an explicit closed form expression involving @xmath0 , by - passing the pre - classical approximation .    in section [ lqcsummarysection ]",
    ", we recall the relevant aspects of isotropic lqc namely , the fundamental difference equation , the form of generic solutions , the pre - classical approximation and the wkb route to obtaining an effective hamiltonian constraint . in section [ mainsectioni ]",
    ", we make the wkb approximation directly at the level of the fundamental equation to arrive at the effective hamiltonian as well as the conditions for validity of the wkb approximation .",
    "the effective hamiltonian is obtained as a close form expressions in @xmath3 , where @xmath2 is a dimensionless parameter of order 1 . in section [ solnsection ]",
    "we discuss some illustrative solutions of the effective dynamics for minimally coupled single scalar field .",
    "we also discuss , how the solutions of the @xmath4dependent equations differ if phenomenological matter ( dust , radiation and cosmological constant ) are incorporated somewhat naively . in the limit @xmath5 these equations and solutions go over to the usual einsteinian classical solutions .",
    "these solutions exhibit the situations wherein , the discreteness corrections ( codified by @xmath6 ) appear as perturbative corrections as well as when the discreteness corrections have qualitatively different implications .",
    "finally in [ discussionsection ] , we clarify the nature of approximations and domains of validity and summarize our results .",
    "we work within the lqc framework as detailed in @xcite . for our purposes , it may be summarized as follows .",
    "classically , we have a phase space with coordinates @xmath7 and the poisson bracket given by @xmath8 , where @xmath9 and @xmath0 is the barbero - immirzi parameter whose precise value does not concern us here .",
    "the coordinate @xmath10 denotes the only invariant part of the gravitational gauge connection while @xmath11 denotes the only invariant part of the densitized triad .",
    "the _ loop _",
    "quantization leads to a kinematical ( i.e. before imposition of the only surviving hamiltonian constraint ) hilbert space conveniently described in terms of the eigenstates of the densitized triad operator ( @xmath12 ) , @xmath13    note that the eigenstates of the densitized triad operator are properly normalized even though the eigen values span the real line .",
    "this is a reflection of the fact that in loop quantization , only holonomies of connections are well defined operators and _ not _ the connections themselves .    as in lqg ,",
    "the classical hamiltonian constraint is promoted to a quantum hamiltonian operator using the volume operator whose action on the triad basis states is given by @xmath14    in the isotropic context we have two classes to consider , namely spatially flat and closed models .",
    "the quantization of the corresponding hamiltonian operators is given in @xcite . by introducing a parameter @xmath15",
    "we can deal both classes together .",
    "the values @xmath16 and @xmath17 will give the flat and the closed models respectively .    in loop quantization of the classical gravitational hamiltonian ( in connection formulation )",
    ", one has to express the connections ( and their curvatures ) in terms of appropriate holonomies of the connection .",
    "this introduces a dimensionless , real parameter @xmath2 through a fiducial length of the loops used in defining the holonomies .",
    "this parameter is to be determined relating this symmetry reduced model to the full theory @xcite . for the purposes of this paper ,",
    "it is simply treated as a parameter of order 1 .",
    "the action of the gravitational hamiltonian on the triad basis states is then given by @xmath18    notice that the hamiltonian connects states differing in their labels by @xmath19 .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the necessity of using holonomy operators in the quantization of the hamiltonian operator and is responsible for leading to a difference equation below .",
    "general kinematical states @xmath20 , in the triad basis have the form @xmath21 where @xmath22 run over some _ countable _ subset of @xmath23 .",
    "the hamiltonian constraint of the classical theory is promoted as a condition to define physical states , i.e. , @xmath24    in terms of @xmath25 and the hamiltonian constraint ( [ hamcons ] ) translates into a difference equation , @xmath26",
    "@xmath27 is a symbolic eigen value and we have assumed that the matter couples to the gravity via the metric component and _ not _ through the curvature component . in particular , @xmath28 . a couple of points are note worthy .",
    "although @xmath22 takes all possible real values , the equation connects the @xmath29 coefficients only in steps of @xmath30 making it a difference equation for the coefficients . by putting @xmath31",
    ", one can see that one has a continuous infinity of independent solutions of the difference equation , labeled by @xmath32 . for each @xmath33",
    "an infinity of coefficients , @xmath34 , are determined by 2 ` initial conditions ' since the order of the difference equation in terms of these coefficients is 2 .",
    "coefficients belonging to different @xmath33 are mutually decoupled . denoting any two ( fixed ) independent solutions of the difference equation by @xmath35 and @xmath36 , a general solution of the second order difference equation , for _ each @xmath37",
    "_ can be expressed as @xmath38 where @xmath39 are arbitrary complex numbers .",
    "linearity of the equation implies that only their ratio is relevant and for @xmath40 , this ratio is fixed @xcite .",
    "a _ general solution _ of the fundamental equation ( [ differenceeqn ] ) is given by a sum of the @xmath41 solutions for a countable set of values of @xmath42 .",
    "note that there are infinitely many ways of selecting the countable subsets of values of @xmath33 . since the coefficients @xmath43 and the symbolic eigenvalues @xmath27 , both vanish for @xmath44 , the coefficient @xmath45 _ decouples _ from all other coefficients ( @xmath45 of course occurs in the @xmath40 sector @xcite ) . as the @xmath29 are defined for all @xmath46 ,",
    "there is no break down of the dynamics at zero volume and in this sense , the lqc dynamics is singularity free @xcite .    for large values of @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) , which correspond to large volume ,",
    "the coefficients @xmath43 become almost constant ( up to a common factor of @xmath49 ) and the matter contribution is also expected similarly to be almost constant .",
    "one then expects the coefficients to vary slowly as @xmath50 is varied which in turn implies that @xmath41 also vary slowly with @xmath50 .",
    "this suggests interpolating these slowly varying _ sequences _ of coefficients by slowly varying , sufficiently differentiable , _ functions _ of the continuous variable @xmath51 @xcite .",
    "using taylor expansion of the interpolating function , the difference equation for @xmath41 then implies a _ differential _ equation for the interpolating function .",
    "this is referred to as a _ continuum approximation_. the terms up to ( and including ) second order derivatives , turn out to be _ independent _ of @xmath0 and the differential equation , truncated to keep only these terms , matches with the usual wheeler ",
    "dewitt equation of quantum cosmology .",
    "this will be referred to as a _ pre - classical approximation _",
    "@xcite .    in the second step ,",
    "one makes a wkb ansatz for solutions of the differential equation . to the leading order in @xmath1 , one obtains a hamilton - jacobi equation for the phase from which the effective hamiltonian is read - off . in @xcite",
    ", such an effective classical hamiltonian was obtained from the pre - classical approximation and it was shown that the classical dynamics implied by the effective hamiltonian is also singularity free due to a generic occurrence of a bounce @xcite .",
    "the derivation of the effective hamiltonian was based on a wkb approximation for the second order differential equation .",
    "it is natural to seek to improve the pre - classical approximation by including higher derivative terms in the differential equation .    in this work , however , we will follow a different route .",
    "we will make the wkb ansatz at the level of the difference equation itself .",
    "the slowly varying property of the interpolating function will be applied to the amplitude and the phase of the interpolating function .",
    "it is then very easy to obtain an effective hamiltonian with nontrivial dependence on the barbero - immirzi parameter @xmath0 and also the domain of validity of wkb approximation . in the limit @xmath52",
    ", one will recover the earlier results of @xcite .",
    "in anticipation of making contact with a classical description , introduce the dimensionful variable @xmath53 as the continuous variable and an interpolating function @xmath54 via @xmath55 . correspondingly , define @xmath56 which provides a convenient _ scale _ to demarcate different regimes in @xmath11 .    defining @xmath57 and replacing @xmath29 by the interpolating function @xmath54 , the fundamental equation ( [ differenceeqn ] ) becomes , @xmath58    at this stage one could use @xmath59 , with @xmath60 denoting the @xmath61 derivative of the function with respect to @xmath11 , derive an infinite order differential equation , consider wkb approximation to extract the @xmath62 terms which gives a hamilton - jacobi equation and read - off the effective hamiltonian .",
    "indeed , this is how we first arrived at the effective hamiltonian , but a much shorter route is available .",
    "the equation ( [ functionaleqn ] ) can be thought of as a _ functional equation _",
    "determining @xmath54 .",
    "and of course it has infinitely many solutions , corresponding to @xmath63 .",
    "so far there has been no approximation , we have only used @xmath64 instead of @xmath22 and @xmath54 instead of @xmath29 .    one can always write the complex function @xmath65 . in the spirit of a continuum description , we assume that the amplitude and the phase are taylor expandable and write , @xmath66    we have just separated the even and odd number of derivative terms for later convenience .",
    "substitution of @xmath67 in ( [ functionaleqn ] ) leads to , @xmath68 \\nonumber \\\\ b_{\\pm}(p , q ) & : = & a(p + q ) \\pm a(p - q ) \\ ] ]    thus , one has _",
    "two equations _ for the _ four combinations _ , @xmath69 .",
    "now we assume that the amplitude and the phase are _ slowly varying _ functions of @xmath11 over a range @xmath70 i.e. when compared over a range @xmath71 , successive terms of a taylor expansion about @xmath11 are smaller than the preceeding terms .",
    "for example , @xmath72 etc . and similarly for the phase .    for such slowly varying solutions of ( [ functionaleqn ] ) , we can approximate the equation by keeping only the first non - trivial derivatives i.e. @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "to arrive at a hamilton - jacobi equation , we identify @xmath75 which implies that @xmath76 , where we have used the definitions @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "this combination of the first derivative of the phase thus has no explicit dependence on @xmath1 .",
    "the terms in the real and imaginary equations can be organized according to powers of @xmath1 . for sine and cosine of @xmath79 , we have to use the power series expansions and keep only the leading powers of @xmath1 . for sine and cosine of @xmath80 , no expansion",
    "is needed since there is no @xmath1 dependence .",
    "the real and imaginary equations can then be written as , @xmath81 \\label{realeqn}\\\\ 0 & = & \\left(\\frac{q^2 \\phi''(p)}{2 \\hbar \\epsilon k } \\right)\\left\\{1 + \\frac{b_-(p , q)}{b_+(p , q)}\\frac{q c'}{c}\\right\\ } + \\left(\\frac{b_-(p , q)}{b_+(p , q ) } + \\frac{q c'}{c } \\right ) \\",
    "\\frac{\\mathrm{tan}\\left(\\epsilon k \\right)}{\\epsilon k } \\label{imeqn}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    on physical grounds , one expects a classical approximation ( @xmath82 terms ) , to be valid only for scales larger than the quantum geometry scale set by @xmath70 and therefore we limit to the regime @xmath83 . in this regime ,",
    "the coefficients @xmath84 behave as @xcite , @xmath85    noting that @xmath86 and keeping only the leading powers of @xmath87 ( or @xmath1 ) , the real and imaginary equations become ( wkb approximation ) , @xmath88 \\label{correcthamjac}\\\\ 0 & = & \\left(\\frac{q^2 \\phi''(p)}{2 \\hbar \\epsilon k } \\right ) + \\left(\\frac{b_-(p , q)}{b_+(p , q ) } + \\frac{q c'}{c } \\right ) \\",
    "\\frac{\\mathrm{tan}\\left(\\epsilon k \\right)}{\\epsilon k } \\label{wkbcondition } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the real equation , ( [ correcthamjac ] ) is of @xmath89 and is a hamilton - jacobi equation for the phase . the right hand side , viewed as a function of @xmath90 , it is the _ effective hamiltonian constraint_. the imaginary equation , ( [ wkbcondition ] ) is of @xmath62 and is a differential equation for the amplitude , given the phase determined by the real equation .",
    "the equations for the phase and the amplitude are decoupled . for self consistency of the wkb approximation ,",
    "the solutions have to be slowly varying . in general",
    ", the solutions will be slowly varying only over some intervals along the @xmath11-axis and such interval(s ) will be the domain of validity of the wkb approximation .",
    "one can infer the domain of validity as follows .",
    "consider the eqn .",
    "( [ wkbcondition ] ) .",
    "by definition of slowly varying phase , the absolute value of the first term must be much smaller than 1 .",
    "since smallest value of @xmath91 is 1 , ( the absolute value of ) the bracket in the second term must be smaller than 1 .",
    "since @xmath92 is also small by definition of slowly varying amplitude , we must have @xmath93 .",
    "this immediately requires @xmath94 and is obviously true in the regime under consideration . evidently , for _ smaller volumes _ , @xmath95 , where @xmath96 is larger , we must have @xmath97 i.e. @xmath98 . by contrast , for _ larger volumes _ , @xmath99 , larger values of @xmath100 are permitted .",
    "thus , the equation ( [ wkbcondition ] ) serves to identify a region of the classical _ phase space _ where the effective classical description is valid .",
    "the domain of validity of effective hamiltonian and its relation to the usual general relativity ( gr ) hamiltonian is discussed further in the remarks below .",
    "it is convenient to write the real equation in the form , @xmath101 \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\frac{1}{\\kappa } \\left[\\left(\\frac{6}{\\epsilon^3{\\ell_{\\mathrm",
    "p}}^2}\\right ) \\left\\{b_+(p , q ) - 2 a(p)\\right\\ } \\right ] ~ + ~ h_m \\label{hamjaceqn}\\ ] ]    the second square bracket in eq.([hamjaceqn ] ) is precisely the _ quantum geometry potential _ , @xmath102 , @xcite .",
    "it is unaffected by the implicit inclusion of all terms of the taylor expansion of @xmath54 . since the leading terms in @xmath103 vanish , the quantum geometry potential term is independent of @xmath6 .",
    "but it is also higher order in @xmath1 . from now on ,",
    "this term is suppressed .",
    "it is obvious that in the limit @xmath104 , one gets back the expression for the effective hamiltonian constraint obtained from the pre - classical approximation in @xcite .",
    "let us focus on the effective hamiltonian constraint in the large volume regime .",
    "as mentioned earlier , the matter is assumed to couple only through metric components and thus the matter hamiltonian has dependence on @xmath11 but not on @xmath105 .",
    "for the moment , we will not be explicit about the matter hamiltonian and simply view it to be a function @xmath11 and matter degrees of freedom symbolically denoted by @xmath106 . in the next section",
    "we will be more explicit about it .",
    "the relevant hamiltonian constraint then becomes ( suppressing the quantum geometry potential ) : @xmath107   + ~ h_m(p , \\phi , p_{\\phi } ) \\ ] ]    to see what the modified hamiltonian constraint implies for cosmological space - times , we have to obtain and solve the hamilton s equations . to this end , we identify @xmath108 and choose the synchronous time as the evolution parameter ( lapse = 1 ) .",
    "it is straight forward to obtain the hamilton s equations of motion as : @xmath109 \\label{kdoteqn}\\\\ \\frac{d \\phi}{d t } & = & \\frac{\\partial h_m(p , \\phi , p_{\\phi } ) } { \\partial p_{\\phi } } \\label{phidoteqn } \\\\",
    "\\frac{d p_{\\phi}}{d t } & = &   - \\frac{\\partial h_m(p , \\phi , p_{\\phi } ) } { \\partial \\phi } \\label{pphidoteqn } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the equation ( [ hamconstraint ] ) is the modification of the friedmann equation while ( [ pdoteqn ] , [ kdoteqn ] ) lead to modified raychoudhuri equation _ after eliminating @xmath110 in favour of the scale factor and its time derivatives . _ in particular , ( [ pdoteqn ] ) gives @xmath111 and leads to @xmath112 ( @xmath5 limit fixes the sign of the square root ) . thus the hamiltonian constraint can be expressed in terms of @xmath113 .",
    "furthermore , since the constraint is obviously preserved along the solutions of the hamilton s equations , we can obtain @xmath114 in terms of @xmath115 .",
    "now is it is straightforward to construct left hand sides of the friedmann and the raychoudhuri equation and comparing with usual einstein equations , read - off the effective density and pressure .",
    "one gets , @xmath116 \\label{friedmanneqn } \\\\ - \\frac{\\kappa}{4}\\left ( \\rho_{\\text{eff } } + 3 p_{\\text{eff}}\\right ) ~:=~ 3 \\frac{\\ddot{a}}{a } & = & - \\frac{\\kappa}{4 } \\left [ 8 a^{-3 } ( h_m - a \\frac{\\partial h_m}{\\partial a } ) \\left\\ { 1 - \\frac{\\epsilon^2}{2}\\left ( \\frac{4 \\kappa}{3 a } h_m   - \\eta \\right)\\right\\ } \\right ] \\label{raychoudhurieqn } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for future reference , we note that the effective density and pressure can be expressed as to the triad variable for the isotropic specialization @xmath117 which equals @xmath118 .",
    "the bianchi normalized volume thus equals @xmath119 .",
    "a hamiltonian is thus @xmath119 times the hamiltonian density @xcite . ]",
    "@xmath120    as @xmath121 , the right hand sides of the above equations go over to the equations of @xcite and so do the effective density and effective pressure , with the quantum geometry potential terms suppressed .",
    "the advantage now is that the raychoudhuri equation is automatically satisfied once the hamilton s equations for the matter hold and the friedmann equation holds .",
    "thus we have the @xmath6-corrected , three coupled ( for a single matter degree of freedom ) , first order ordinary differential equations which go over to the classical equations when @xmath5 .",
    "it is now a simple task to compare the solutions with / without @xmath6 corrections , for the same initial conditions consistent with small @xmath113 and large @xmath122 .",
    "some solutions are discussed in the next section .",
    "several remarks are in order :    \\(1 ) it is somewhat surprising that the parameters related to quantum geometry , @xmath2 and @xmath0 ( which have to be non - zero ) , appear in the effective hamiltonian which is _ independent _ of @xmath1 i.e. , in a _ classical _ description .    to trace how this happens , recall that the basic phase space variables in isotropic lqc ( in the connection formulation ) are @xmath7 and the conjugate momentum variable @xmath105",
    "is related to the connection variable @xmath10 by @xmath123 ( for spatially flat model for definiteness ) . in loop",
    "quantizing the hamiltonian constraint , the classical constraint is to be expressed in terms of the holonomies of the connection ( equation ( 34 ) of @xcite ) . in this process",
    ", the parameter @xmath2 enters . the classical constraint",
    "so obtained , precisely contains the @xmath124 which is the same as @xmath125 .",
    "the parameter @xmath6 is thus present already at the classical level ( @xmath82 ) . within a strictly classical context",
    ", one can view it as a  regulator \" and remove it at will , by taking @xmath126 to recover the classical einstein hamiltonian . within a strictly wkb context",
    "also one can remove it since the corrections to wkb are positive powers of @xmath127 .",
    "however , from the perspective of the exact loop quantization , we _ can not _",
    "take @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "while viewing the wkb solutions as an approximation to the exact lqc solutions , we retain the link to the exact solutions by keeping @xmath128 .",
    "\\(2 ) the classical _ gr hamiltonian _ is the expression obtained from the effective hamiltonian in the limit @xmath129 ( and large volume ) .",
    "this could be achieved by _ either _ taking @xmath130 fixed , which is a natural classical gr perspective since the classical gr has no @xmath6 _ or _ by taking @xmath131 fixed which is the appropriate quantum perspective in lqc .",
    "this opens up the possibility that there could be modifications of _ classical _ gr especially when the conjugate momentum ( @xmath105 ) gets somewhat larger .",
    "as noted already , for smaller volumes , the domain of wkb approximation restricted by equation ( [ wkbcondition ] ) , requires @xmath105 to be small and the effective hamiltonian reduces to the gr hamiltonian . for small @xmath105 , @xmath132 and corresponds to the extrinsic curvature ( a geometrical quantity ) . for larger values of @xmath105 ,",
    "the relation between @xmath105 and the extrinsic curvature is given by equation ( [ pdoteqn ] ) .",
    "\\(3 ) since for smaller volumes , the effective hamiltonian goes over to the gr hamiltonian , the effective density and pressure defined in ( [ friedmanneqn ] , [ raychoudhurieqn ] ) go over to those defined in @xcite . consequently , the genericness of inflation @xcite is insensitive to the @xmath6 parameter .",
    "furthermore , since the quantum geometry potential is unaffected , the genericness of bounce also continues to hold ( in this regime , the quantum geometry potential must be retained in equation ( [ hamjaceqn ] ) ) @xcite .",
    "\\(4 ) the occurrence of the trigonometric function of @xmath105 immediately implies two bounds .",
    "the effective hamiltonian constraint , ( [ hamconstraint ] ) , implies that is that the matter hamiltonian is necessarily bounded : @xmath133 or equivalently , @xmath134 .",
    "equation ( [ pdoteqn ] ) on the other hand implies a bound on the expansion rate : @xmath135 .    consider the bound on the matter hamiltonian . momentarily , let us write @xmath136 where the ` density ' @xmath137 may include modifications from inverse triad operator @xcite .",
    "we have the two regimes of large and small volumes , two possibilities for spatial curvature , @xmath15 and two bounds on the matter hamiltonian to consider . for _ large volumes _",
    ", we may identify @xmath137 with the usual energy densities for dust and radiation ( late time dominant matter ) or with a positive cosmological constant . for dust and radiation ,",
    "the upper bound is satisfied for both flat and closed models but the lower bound will be violated for closed models ( @xmath17 ) and hence a re - collapse must commence .",
    "if @xmath137 is identified with a positive cosmological constant , then the lower bound will be satisfied but the upper bound _ will _ be violated for _ large _ enough volumes irrespective of @xmath15 , resulting in re - collapse . for _ smaller volumes _ , cosmological constant will satisfy the upper bound but will violate the lower bound for a close model implying a bounce . in this regime , the dust / radiation will potentially violate the upper bound . however , for smaller volumes , @xmath137 has modifications from the inverse volume operator which imply that @xmath137 goes to a constant ensuring that the upper bound is indeed satisfied .",
    "in the small volume regime , one also has a contribution from the quantum geometry potential which implies that irrespective of @xmath15 , the lower bound will be violated implying a bounce @xcite . since the effective constraint excludes evolutions which violate either of the bounds , a violation in the large volume regime must encounter a re - collapse while a violation in the small volume regime indicates a bounce .",
    "the solutions discussed in the next section illustrate these implications .",
    "consider now the bound on the expansion rate , @xmath138 .",
    "let us trace a possible scenario beginning with a bounce for a spatially flat model .",
    "let us set @xmath139 at the bounce time and @xmath140 .",
    "near this time , we must include the quantum geometry potential i.e. @xmath141 in the equation ( [ friedmanneqn ] ) and @xmath142 , where @xmath143 is a constant @xcite .",
    "the bounce is determined by @xmath144 and gives @xmath145 @xcite .",
    "close to @xmath146 , the scale factor will behave as , @xmath147 and @xmath148 is a positive constant . since @xmath149 , the bound _",
    "will _ be violated in a finite time .",
    "the bounce phase will go over to an exponentially expanding phase when the quantum geometry potential becomes negligible .",
    "this will happen well before saturating the bound on @xmath113 , even if @xmath150 is just a few times @xmath151 .",
    "suppose the bounce phase ends at time @xmath152 and the universe enters a phase of exponential expansion , @xmath153 .",
    "the exponent is determined by the parameters @xmath154 and the duration @xmath152 of the preceeding bounce phase .",
    "now @xmath155 which increases monotonically",
    ". this phase must again end in a finite time ( at @xmath156 say ) to satisfy the bound . since @xmath157 and @xmath158 , the maximum expansion is effectively controlled by @xmath159 .",
    "once again , the exponential inflation can end before saturating the bound and these details will depend on the precise matter dynamics ( eg the form of scalar field potential ) .",
    "one can repeat the scenario for power law accelerated expansion and have a similar finite duration phase .",
    "if the bound gets saturated at any stage , the acceleration must go over to deceleration possibly reaching a re - collapse , contraction and another bounce and so on .",
    "if however the inflationary phase ends prior to saturating the bound and the universe enters a decelerated phase such as radiation domination followed by matter domination , the bound will continue to hold .",
    "note that such a scenario is also conceivable without a bound on @xmath113 , however with a bounded @xmath113 the scenario becomes more plausible .",
    "the bound is also specified in terms of the discreteness parameter , @xmath6 , which is expected to be constrained by the full ( inhomogeneous ) loop quantum gravity .",
    "\\(5 ) finally , let us note that @xmath113 is the extrinsic curvature of the symmetry adapted hypersurface ( and is also the rate of change of the physical volume of the universe ) and is gauge invariant . the modifications to gr due to the non - zero parameter @xmath6 are manifested in the modified coupling ( quadratic in matter hamiltonian ) between matter and geometry .",
    "the gr domain , contained within the domain of validity of wkb , can also be given as : @xmath160 translates into @xmath161 while @xmath162 translates into @xmath163 .",
    "the effective hamiltonian and subsequent analysis being @xmath89 , is insensitive to factor ordering in the hamiltonian constraint .",
    "let us consider a few solutions of the modified equations .",
    "these are not meant to be phenomenologically realistic solutions , but are to be viewed as indicating modification to gr solutions .",
    "in particular we consider the cases of a minimally coupled homogeneous scalar field , phenomenological matter with a constant equation of state and positive cosmological constant viewed as a special case of phenomenological matter",
    ".      for simplicity , let us take the matter sector consisting of a scalar field , @xmath164 , minimally coupled to gravity .",
    "then its usual classical hamiltonian is given by @xmath165 .",
    "its quantization involves two parts  ( a ) quantization of @xmath166 operator and ( b ) bohr quantization of the scalar field itself . for large volume",
    ", the inverse volume operator in the triad representation just goes over to the classical expression .",
    "its correction terms involve higher powers of @xmath1 ( the terms suppressed by inverse powers of @xmath11 in the coefficients @xmath167 , likewise involve higher powers of @xmath1 ) .",
    "thus , to @xmath89 , these modifications are irrelevant in the large volume regime .",
    "the bohr quantization appears not to introduce @xmath168corrections to the usual classical matter hamiltonian . in this paper",
    "we will pretend that the matter is quantized in the usual schrodinger quantization .",
    "loop quantization of matter with or without non - minimal coupling ( to mimic a dilaton ) will be presented elsewhere .",
    "the solutions are obtained numerically with @xmath169 and with initial conditions chosen to indicate different types of behaviours .",
    "we use geometrized units ( @xmath170 and speed of light equal to 1 ) . introducing an arbitrary length scale @xmath171 , various quantities",
    "has following dimensions .",
    "@xmath172    scaling the quantities by the appropriate power of @xmath171 all equations are rendered dimensionless and integrated numerically . since we use the usual classical form of the matter hamiltonian without the corrections from the inverse volume , the length scale @xmath171 is suitably large ( eg @xmath173 ) .    for the plots shown below in figure([onephi ] ) , figure([tenphi ] ) and",
    "figure([fiftyphi ] ) , the dimensionless scale factor assumed to be 100 and the dimensionless mass is taken to be 0.001 .",
    "three different values of the discreteness parameter are chosen : @xmath174 .",
    "three different initial conditions for the scalar field and its momentum are taken namely @xmath175 . as can be expected , the initial value of the scalar field has stronger effect on the evolution . for smaller value of the scalar field ,",
    "the effect of non - zero @xmath6 is virtually absent while for larger values one sees the multiple re - collapse / bounce possibilities .",
    "for the plots , spatially flat model is considered ( @xmath176 ) .",
    "only the evolution of the scale factor is shown in the figures .",
    "the scalar field typically increases first and then decreases to smaller values .",
    "both the increase and the decrease of the scalar field are steeper for larger values of @xmath6 .",
    "the scalar field momentum also shows similar behaviour .",
    "the decrease however is much sharper and occurs at _ later _",
    "times for larger values of @xmath6 .    .",
    "the discreteness corrections are very small.,width=566 ]    . for late times , deviations due to non - zero @xmath6 are clearly visible.,width=566 ]    . for late times",
    "the evolutions show multiple bounces and re - collapses for non - zero @xmath6.,width=566 ]      in fact , it is rather easy to consider more general case of phenomenological matter if one proceeds somewhat naively . by this",
    "we mean the following .    in the current treatment , the matter",
    "is also supposed to be described by a hamiltonian .",
    "however , for the usual ` dust ' and ` radiation ' which are supposed to represent non - relativistic and relativistic matter respectively , one does not write a hamiltonian . the underlying matter dynamics ( with time scale shorter than that of expansion of the universe ) is supposed to ensure a thermal equilibrium .",
    "such matter is then thermodynamically described in terms of an energy density , @xmath177 and pressure , @xmath178 , with the equilibrium property implying an equation of state , @xmath179 .",
    "the first law of thermodynamics in conjunction with adiabatic expansion implies the ` continuity equation ' @xmath180 which can be integrated to give , @xmath181    the equilibrium property also implies that the density and pressure are homogeneous .",
    "such matter in ( approximate ) equilibrium is coupled to gravity via a stress tensor of the form of the stress tensor of a prefect fluid ( and the matter is correspondingly referred to as a perfect fluid ) which is of course the most general form of stress tensor in the context of homogeneity and isotropy .",
    "this stress tensor is conserved by virtue of the continuity equation implied by adiabatic expansion and the first law of thermodynamics .",
    "this way of coupling matter to gravity is thus consistent with the einstein equation .",
    "it is conceivable that some of the mechanisms ( eg microscopic matter dynamics ) involved in establishing thermal equilibrium may be modified , especially if the expansion time scale becomes comparable to that of the matter processes responsible for establishing thermal equilibrium .",
    "however , for the large volume regime we are considering , one may justifiably assume that the microscopic matter dynamics are unchanged and lead to thermal equilibrium with the usual equations of states .",
    "if this assumption is granted then such sources can be incorporated by taking @xmath182 , with the scale factor dependence of matter hamiltonian explicitly specified via that of the thermodynamical energy density , @xmath183 . in view of the expressions in ( [ hbardef ] ) , this is equivalent to putting @xmath184 . the assumption made above amounts to viewing the effective equation of state , @xmath185 being determined from the usual equation of state , @xmath186 .",
    "the effective density and pressure are thus not ascribed any thermodynamic origin , but are viewed as prescribing a modified coupling of the matter to gravity .",
    "the evolution of the scale factor is now obtained by solving just the ( modified ) friedmann equation ( [ friedmanneqn ] ) for various choices of @xmath187 .",
    "for example , for constant equation of state , @xmath186 , and for expanding universe , @xmath188   ^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\ ] ]    introducing dimensionless quantities , @xmath189 the friedmann equation can be written as , @xmath190    it is convenient to parameterize the equation of state variable as , @xmath191 so that @xmath192 corresponds to the cosmological constant , @xmath193 corresponds to the radiation while @xmath194 corresponds to the dust .",
    "for the flat models , the substitution @xmath195 , leads to , @xmath196(\\tau - \\tau_0 ) & = &   \\int ( \\text{cosh } \\lambda)^n d \\lambda \\nonumber \\\\ & = & 2^{-n } \\sum_{r = 0}^n \\ ^n c_r \\left(\\frac{\\text{sinh}(2 r - n)\\lambda}{2 r - n}\\right ) \\ ] ]    for even integer @xmath50 , the parenthesis in the @xmath197 term in the summation , is to be replaced by @xmath198 .",
    "we have thus obtained the solution of the friedmann equation ( [ flatmodel ] ) in a parametric form , in particular for the cases of interest namely @xmath199 .    to recover the @xmath5 solutions",
    ", one has only to note that for _ non - zero _ @xmath50 , the left hand side of ( [ flatparametric ] ) diverges for @xmath200 ( say ) , and implies that one must have @xmath198 very large .",
    "the leading term on the right hand side is then @xmath201 .",
    "likewise , for large @xmath198 , @xmath202 .",
    "one can now eliminate @xmath203 to get @xmath204 . clearly ,",
    "these match with the usual ( @xmath205 ) solutions .",
    "the case of the cosmological constant ( @xmath192 ) is discussed in the next subsection .    for the closed models ,",
    "again one can obtain parametric form of the solutions which involves an integration .",
    "however the qualitative behavior can be seen easily .",
    "now a different substitution is convenient . putting @xmath206",
    "one obtains , @xmath207    clearly , @xmath198 must be bounded to ensure @xmath208 .",
    "one can also check that the integrand is integrable at the maximum value of @xmath198 .",
    "taking @xmath209 and @xmath210 for the upper limit of integration to be @xmath211 ( defined by @xmath212 ) , one obtains an oscillatory universe with a finite period given by @xmath213 for all the three cases of interest .",
    "the @xmath5 limit is simpler in this case since @xmath214 does not depend explicitly on @xmath6 .",
    "also @xmath211 diverges and therefore for any finite @xmath198 we can simply take @xmath205 in the integrand . for @xmath215 , then one recovers the usual ( parametric ) form of the solutions .    for dust and radiation ,",
    "the corrections due to non - zero @xmath6 are extremely small .",
    "this is to be expected since the densities decrease with the scale factor , making the @xmath216 term very small .",
    "this is obtained by taking @xmath217 and as mentioned before , mathematically it corresponds to @xmath218 . in the equation ( [ dimlessdefns ] ) , we replace @xmath219 by @xmath220 .    for @xmath205 , one has the well known solutions : @xmath221 for @xmath16 and @xmath222 for @xmath17 .    for @xmath128 ,",
    "the solutions are qualitatively different . for the spatially flat case , @xmath16 , one has a re - collapsing solution given explicitly as",
    ", @xmath223    the scale factor vanishes only for @xmath224 and the solution is non - singular . as @xmath5 ,",
    "the maximum value for scale factor diverges and one is either in the expanding or contracting phase .",
    "one can obtain the @xmath205 solution by taking the limit @xmath225 with @xmath226 held constant .    for the closed model , @xmath17 , the scale factor is bounded from both above and below as @xmath227 and",
    "the universe keeps oscillating between these values in _ finite _ time , with the period of oscillation given by , @xmath228    as @xmath5 , the maximum value of @xmath214 diverges , the period diverges .",
    "the usual de sitter solution is recovered by just taking @xmath205 in the integrand of equation ( [ closedparametric ] ) which gives @xmath229 and eliminating @xmath198 . in both the cases above",
    ", one can check from the raychoudhuri equation that smaller scale factor is indeed a local minimum while the larger one is a local maximum ( as a function of @xmath230 ) .    for the cosmological constant as the only source , for @xmath205 , the equation of state ,",
    "@xmath231 remains independent of the scale factor and the raychoudhuri equation then implies an always accelerating universe , precluding the possibility of re - collapse . with the @xmath6 corrections incorporated ,",
    "the effective density and pressure is modified and the modified equation of state acquires a scale factor dependence which is such that there is always a decelerating phase before re - collapse .",
    "had we taken @xmath5 , we would have got the classical gr hamiltonian leading to the usual exponentially expanding universe without a re - collapse ( @xmath16 ) . the difference equation on the other hand shows that discrete wave function , in any _ one sector _ begins to oscillate over the quantum geometry scale @xmath232 for large values of the triad , implying a breakdown of pre - classicality ( no small scale variations ) of the exact solutions . while deviations from pre - classicality are expected in the small volume regime due to quantum effects , deviations in the very large volume regime have no such physical reasons and are viewed as an ` infra - red problem ' @xcite .",
    "a typical example of such large volume deviations is that of cosmological constant ( and non - zero spatial curvature ) .",
    "no quantity which has a local interpretation such as energy density ( @xmath220 ) is ill - behaved and the integrated quantity diverges due to integration over infinite volume . in such cases , the homogeneous idealization ( integrand being a constant )",
    "is thought to become in - applicable beyond a finite volume .",
    "noting that the wave function has an oscillation length of @xmath233 @xcite , one can obtain a bound on the largest scale factor , @xmath234 , by requiring the oscillation length to be larger than the scale of slow variation , @xmath235 .",
    "this gives , @xmath236 .    in the effective picture",
    ", we have a maximum value , @xmath237 of the scale factor due to re - collapse and for @xmath16 it is given by @xmath238 in equation ( [ flatsoln ] ) . demanding that @xmath239 gives a bound on the cosmological constant : @xmath240 .",
    "for such a cosmological constant , the effective picture can be consistent with pre - classical behaviour of exact solutions .",
    "incidentally , for the currently favored value of the cosmological constant , one has @xmath241 .",
    "we would also like to note that in @xcite re - collapse of a @xmath242dominated universe has been obtained from a different perspective .",
    "these authors note that the discrete wave functions cease to show oscillatory behaviour beyond a critical volume .",
    "the value of the critical volume matches exactly with the @xmath237 above thus corroborating the wkb intuition .    in the above discussion",
    ", we have used the large scale factor expressions for the equations , mainly because we were interested in seeing the re - collapse possibility .",
    "secondly we also used the effective classical picture right close to the wkb turning point . for inferring qualitative implications as done above ,",
    "this is okay .",
    "the full effective classical equations together with the domain of validity of the wkb approximation have been given in the previous section .",
    "the main lesson is that the corrections due to discreteness can change some of the solutions qualitatively while for others these are perturbative in nature .",
    "let us recapitulate the key steps in the derivation of the effective hamiltonian and clarify the role of wkb approximation and its interpretation .",
    "we began from the quantum hamiltonian constraint ( [ functionaleqn ] ) .",
    "while it has a variety of solutions , we assumed that there exist a class of solutions which are taylor expandable , at least over some bounded interval(s ) of the triad eigenvalues .",
    "this allowed us to introduce the @xmath243 in equations ( [ taylorexpanssion ] , [ deltaamplitude ] , [ deltaphase ] ) .",
    "next , we made the further assumption of slowly varying amplitude and phase to _ truncate _ the @xmath243 to first derivative of the amplitude and second derivative of the phase .",
    "now the wkb approximation is made to arrange the expansions of the trigonometric functions according to powers of @xmath1 to arrive at a hamilton - jacobi equation ( [ realeqn ] ) for the phase , from the ( @xmath89 ) terms as well as an equation for the amplitude ( [ imeqn ] ) from the ( @xmath62 ) terms .",
    "the self - consistency of the slow variation of the amplitude and the phase can be used to infer the conditions for validity of wkb approximation .",
    "these were further simplified to equations ( [ correcthamjac ] , [ wkbcondition ] ) in the region of interest ( @xmath244 ) .",
    "the effective hamiltonian is read - off from the simplified hamilton - jacobi equation ( [ correcthamjac ] ) .",
    "we also note that the usual , second order wheeler - dewitt differential equation has been by - passed .    since the higher derivatives of the amplitude and phase are also higher orders in @xmath1 , the wkb approximation ( keeping leading powers of @xmath1 ) is correlated with the assumption of slow variation .",
    "as is well known , the wkb approximation fails near the ` turning points ' at which the first derivative of the phase vanishes . for definiteness ,",
    "let us assume that these occur at some @xmath245 .",
    "the domain of validity of the effective hamiltonian is necessarily within these values .",
    "since the wkb solutions themselves are only approximate solutions of the fundamental difference equation , it is possible that these solutions fail to be a good approximation to the exact solutions .",
    "this can happen , for example , when _ all _",
    "the exact solutions fail to be slowly varying ( while wkb solutions are slowly varying ) .",
    "let us assume that some particular exact solution is well approximated by the wkb solution in an interval @xmath246 .",
    "the domain of relevance of the effective hamiltonian is then the intersection of these two intervals",
    ". the intersection must be non - empty since there do exist exact solutions which are slowly varying exhibiting classical behavior .",
    "clearly , the largest possible domain for effective hamiltonian is the interval between the two turning points : @xmath247 .",
    "since , as explained in the section ( [ lqcsummarysection ] ) , exact solutions are countable sums of independent solutions of the difference equation , it should be possible to choose linear combinations which approximate any given wkb solution over the wkb domain , for example as a least square fit .",
    "precise and useful quantification of a wkb solution approximating an exact solution however needs a separate work .    to construct wkb solutions , one appeals to the connection of hamilton - jacobi equation with an associated ( classical ) hamiltonian dynamics",
    "it is well known ( in a general context ) that any given solution , @xmath248 , of a hamilton - jacobi equation selects a sub - class of hamiltonian trajectories in the phase space , namely , those with initial conditions @xmath249 .",
    "conversely , a _ local _ solution , in a neighbourhood of a point ( @xmath250 ) , is constructed as @xmath251 . here",
    ", @xmath252 denotes a family of solutions of the euler - lagrange equation ( obtained from the solutions of the hamilton s equations of motion ) , with initial conditions @xmath253 .",
    "thus , the solutions of the effective hamiltonian equations of motion can be used to construct corresponding ( local ) solutions of the hamilton - jacobi equation and hence the amplitude and the phase . in this manner",
    ", the effective hamiltonian can be used to construct solutions which are to be approximated by exact solutions of the fundamental equation ( [ differenceeqn ] ) .    in summary , at least in the context of isotropic lqc , the discreteness corrections are manifested at the level of the effective hamiltonian .",
    "these corrections arise due to a discrete geometry underlying the continuous one and are controlled by the parameter @xmath2 and the barbero - immirzi parameter @xmath0 . for",
    "the cases where @xmath254 grows with the scale factor , the corrections alter the qualitative behaviour while in other cases the corrections are perturbative in nature .",
