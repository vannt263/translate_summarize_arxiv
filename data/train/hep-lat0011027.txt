    "let us start by recalling why the lattice formulation of vector - like gauge theories such as qcd is so successful .",
    "lattice qcd is manifestly gauge invariant , and this implies that gauge degrees of freedom decouple in the regulated theory , _",
    "i.e. _  at any momentum scale .",
    "it is because of this that it is possible to find lattice formulations of qcd for which a hermitian , positive definite transfer matrix can be constructed , implying unitarity of the regulated theory .",
    "in addition , we have weak - coupling perturbation theory ( wcpt ) , which tells us how to take the continuum limit , and what the scaling behavior of the theory looks like . in particular , because of wcpt and asymptotic freedom , the number of quarks in the theory is determined by the free quark action . if , for instance , we use wilson fermions , the fermion spectrum is undoubled , with the doubler modes all having energies of order @xmath0 .",
    "in contrast , the lattice formulation of chiral gauge theories ( chgts ) is more complicated .",
    "the fundamental reason is the chiral anomaly , which implies that there is no exact chiral ( @xmath1 ) invariance on the lattice @xcite .",
    "the converse of this is the well - known nielsen ",
    "ninomiya theorem , which says that a local lattice theory with exact @xmath1 invariance is in fact vector - like @xcite : the theory has fermion doublers , and the fermions that emerge in the continuum limit transform in a vector - like representation of the ( would - be ) chiral symmetry group .",
    "( non - local theories , such as those using slac @xcite or rebbi @xcite derivatives , have even more severe problems @xcite . )",
    "this implies that in order to  keep a symmetry chiral , \" ( and have each fermion produce its contribution to the chiral anomaly ) , chiral symmetry has to be broken on the lattice .",
    "if the chiral symmetry is to be gauged , as in chgts , this means breaking gauge invariance , and we have to worry about the gauge degrees of freedom ( _ gdofs _ )",
    ".    an example will illustrate the importance of this issue . throughout this talk",
    ", i will assume that all fermions coupling to the gauge fields are left handed ( lh ) .",
    "( all rh fermions can be written as lh through charge conjugation in four dimensions . )",
    "remove the doublers with a momentum - dependent wilson mass term @xcite @xmath2 where @xmath3 is a gauge - neutral spectator fermion introduced solely in order to give the doublers of the charged lh fermion field @xmath4 a mass .",
    "this term breaks gauge invariance , whether we make the laplacian covariant or not , and hence , for simplicity , i will not do so . after a gauge transformation @xmath5 , this becomes @xmath6 at this point @xmath7 is a random field , and , for @xmath8 not too large , we expect that @xmath9 ; hence @xmath10 @xmath7 represents the _ gdofs _ , and we see that it couples to the fermions because the wilson term breaks gauge invariance .",
    "( indeed , the wilson term leads to the correct expression for the triangle diagram for smooth gauge fields @xcite . )",
    "the dynamics of this coupling has drastic consequences for the fermion spectrum : the doublers come back , and the gauge theory is vector - like ! ( see _ e.g. _  ref .",
    "@xcite for large @xmath8 . )",
    "if we supply dynamics for @xmath7 to give it a vacuum expectation value @xmath11 , we get @xmath12 and the theory is still not really chiral , because @xmath13 sets the scale of both the doubler and gauge - field masses .",
    "( this is essentially the idea behind mirror fermions @xcite . ) clearly , we need more sophisticated dynamics for @xmath7 if an approach like this is to work .",
    "we have in principle two options : + a. use ordinary chiral symmetry .",
    "if this is gauged , gauge invariance has to be broken on the lattice , and the _ gdofs _   couple to the fermions .",
    "therefore the dynamics of the _ gdofs_has to be controlled such that disasters as in our example above do not happen .",
    "clearly , it is _ not _ enough to give a prescription for the fermion determinant : we need the ",
    "back reaction \" _ on _ the fermions in order to find out whether or not the fermion spectrum remains chiral .",
    "realizations of this approach will be reviewed in sect .",
    "+ b. change chiral symmetry on the lattice to make it compatible with exact gauge invariance _ and _ doubler masses .    that the latter option can be realized was actually discovered rather recently , and came somewhat as a surprise .",
    "modify the axial transformation rule of @xmath14 , but not @xmath15 , by a term of order @xmath16 @xcite : @xmath17 where @xmath18 are the generators of some lie group , and @xmath19 is an operator of mass dimension one .",

    "first , we wish the symmetry group to be the same as that of the continuum theory .",

    "wilson ( gw ) relation @xcite @xmath27 second , we need a fermion action invariant under this symmetry .",

    "( [ ginswils ] ) , and invariance under eq .",
    "( [ modaxial ] ) then follows . in this talk",
    ", i will choose @xmath29 to be the overlap operator of ref .",
    "the application of this idea to chgts is the topic of the next section .",
    "note that the transformation rules of @xmath14 and @xmath15 are not related .",
    "this is no problem in the euclidean formulation , but raises the question how this would carry over to a canonical formalism .",
    "with a dirac operator obeying the gw relation , chiral projections of the fermion fields can be consistently defined as @xcite @xmath30 and the action for a chgt is then latticized as @xmath31 , which is consistent because @xmath32 .",

    "in fact , such a relation can be established for any @xmath29 satisfying the gw relation @xcite , but @xmath29 as defined in eq .",
    "( [ overlapdirac ] ) is local if the gauge field is restricted to satisfy @xmath55 with @xmath56 @xcite .",
    "this definition of the fermion determinant is not complete .",
    "there is an arbitrariness in the choice of basis @xmath35 , which depends on the background gauge field @xmath57 , because @xmath58 depends on @xmath57 .",
    "this leads to a phase ambiguity in the determinant , which , in the overlap formulation , corresponds to the phase ambiguity in the choice of @xmath51 .",
    "the choice of phase has to break gauge invariance , so that each fermion in a complex irreducible representation will contribute its share of the chiral anomaly ( even if the complete fermion representation is anomaly free ) .",
    "the question is whether this phase can be chosen such that gauge invariance is preserved for anomaly - free theories .      in the original overlap formulation ,",
    "the phase was determined _  la _ wigner",
    " brillouin by choosing @xmath59 real and positive ( so that only a @xmath57-independent ambiguity remains ) @xcite .",
    "this phase choice breaks gauge invariance also for an anomaly - free fermion spectrum .",
    "therefore , the key question is whether the resulting unphysical interactions between fermions and _ gdofs _  alter the fermion spectrum , as explained in section 1 .",
    "the issue of gauge invariance has been studied in detail in a two - dimensional @xmath60 model with four lh fermions of charge @xmath61 and one rh fermion of charge @xmath62 ( which is anomaly free in @xmath63 ) @xcite .",
    "the most complete investigation in this context is that of ref .",
    "@xcite , and i will highlight here some of the conclusions of this work . starting from some smooth gauge field @xmath64 in a finite volume @xmath65 ,",
    "consider the singular gauge field @xmath66 with @xmath67 arbitrary constants , for some @xmath68 .",
    "this gauge field is gauge equivalent to the smooth field @xmath69 therefore , in this anomaly - free theory , the fermion determinant should be the same for both configurations if it were to be gauge invariant , for all @xmath67 .",
    "however , ref .",
    "@xcite found that the imaginary part , @xmath70 , changes by @xmath71 for @xmath72 , @xmath73 in the continuum limit , @xmath74 .",
    "an equilibrium ensemble of lattice gauge fields contains mostly fields with many singularities such as the one described above . while no systematic classification exists",
    ", i expect that this lack of gauge invariance is a generic property of lattice gauge fields , and not a  set - of - measure - zero \" problem .",
    "( note that ref .",
    "@xcite only considered gauge fields with singularities on the boundary . ) in fact , the class of gauge fields considered above includes fields with vanishing field strength , but non - trivial polyakov loops . on the @xmath60 trivial orbit ( with trivial polyakov loops )",
    "it was proven that the determinant is gauge invariant in two dimensions @xcite , but this is a very special case , and only valid in two dimensions .",
    "it was shown that even on the trivial orbit the overlap definition with wb phase choice is equivalent to a theory with domain - wall fermions in a waveguide , with both doublers and ghosts appearing dynamically on the waveguide boundaries @xcite . while the doubler- and ghost - contributions to the determinant may cancel in two dimensions on the @xmath60 trivial orbit ,",
    "this is certainly not the case for general gauge fields in four dimensions .    in summary , the wb phase choice is not gauge invariant even for anomaly - free theories , and there is good reason to expect that this damages the chiral nature of the fermion spectrum .",
    "note again that , in order to probe this issue , the back reaction of the gauge field ( in particular the _ gdofs _ ) has to be considered .",
    "a different way of choosing the phase of the determinant was proposed by lscher @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) . under an infinitesimal deformation of the gauge field @xmath75",
    "we have @xmath76 where the first term comes from the variation of the action . the second term , equal to @xmath77 and defining the current @xmath78 , comes from the measure ( @xmath79 with @xmath80 the gauge - group generators ) . specializing to a gauge variation @xmath81 , with @xmath82 the gauge - covariant forward difference operator , this yields @xmath83\\ , , \\nonumber\\\\ { \\cal a}^a&\\!\\!=\\!\\!&-i\\,{{\\rm tr}}({{\\hat\\gamma}_5}t^a)\\,,\\label{transform}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath84 the covariant backward difference operator .",

    "this constraint is independent from , but implied by , the constraint eq .",
    "( [ locality ] ) , which guarantees locality of the overlap - dirac operator .",
    "obviously , this constraint will have to be taken into account in numerical simulations of an abelian chgt using this approach .    in any numerical simulation of a chgt",
    ", the most severe problem will be the fact that a euclidean chiral determinant has a complex phase .",
    "this is a property inherent to chgts , and thus can not be avoided , irrespective of the details of the lattice formulation .",
    "a problem more specific to the gauge - invariant approach is the need for a very accurate approximation to @xmath124 . since the properties of @xmath58 play a crucial role in the proof of gauge invariance , the situation is unlike that in qcd with overlap fermions , where an approximate @xmath58 ( or , equivalently , an operator @xmath29 satisfying gw only approximately ) breaks chiral symmetry , but not gauge invariance . here , an approximate @xmath58 breaks gauge invariance , and in such a situation the _ gdofs _",

    "one expects that for a very good approximation of @xmath58 the phase of the determinant should be very close to its exact value for any lattice gauge field . on the other hand , in terms of a phase diagram ,",
    "breaking gauge invariance implies moving away from the gauge - invariant subspace ( in particular from the gauge - invariant critical point ) , and it would be interesting to understand how the decoupling of _ gdofs _  takes place with successively better approximations to @xmath58 .    one systematic way of approximating the overlap - dirac operator",
    "@xmath29 , and hence @xmath58 , is through domain - wall fermions in the limit of infinite fifth dimension @xcite .",

    "invariant was established in ref .",
    "] however , at present this approach has not yet led to a gauge - invariant definition of the determinant through domain - wall fermions .      while the program of defining a gauge - invariant chiral fermion determinant on the lattice starting from the symmetry eq .",
    "( [ modaxial ] ) is not complete , and numerical simulations are certainly difficult , this approach has led to some interesting theoretical developments .",
    "first , as i have mentioned already above , the program was completed in perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "this means that , to all orders in perturbation theory , an anomaly - free chgt can be put on the lattice without violating gauge invariance . in perturbation theory , the locality constraint eq .",
    "( [ locality ] ) is automatically satisfied , and therefore the theory is also local .",
    "this lattice formulation of anomaly - free chgts thus provides a manifestly gauge - invariant four - dimensional perturbative regulator for chgts . as such",
    ", it should be of practical interest for instance in the calculation of perturbative corrections in the electro - weak sector of the standard model and for electro - weak hadronic matrix elements . a property which is not manifest in this lattice formulation",
    "is unitarity . with the program being complete in perturbation theory ,",
    "it should be possible to establish unitarity of anomaly - free gauge theories at least to all orders perturbatively .",
    "another interesting application of the construction of abelian chgts is that it can be extended to include the full electro - weak ( @xmath130 ) sector of the standard model @xcite .",
    "the essential ingredient is that the gauge - fermion sector of the standard model is chiral only because of the presence of @xmath131 ( all representations of @xmath132 are pseudo - real ) .",

    "( [ intcond ] ) in its integral form .",
    "even if this condition is satisfied in its local ( differential ) form , it may still be that the rhs of eq .",

    "hence , such a theory has a global anomaly .",

    "@xcite showed that this obstruction of the integrability condition is precisely the way in which the witten anomaly @xcite manifests itself in this regularization of an @xmath132 chgt , and also considered other @xmath132 representations .",
    "while this is a very nice result , it is not the same as a complete classification of all global obstructions in ( this definition of ) chgts .",
    "a complete classification would be necessary in order to construct lattice chgts in a finite volume , and would entail a study of _ all _ possible closed paths in the relevant gauge - field space .",
    "such an endeavor is obviously much more ambitious .",
    "it should be said in this respect that the other proposals discussed in this talk do not lend themselves to a systematic analytic study of global obstructions .    to close this section ,",
    "i mention some work on the family - index theorem for the overlap operator @xcite . while potentially interesting , thus far only the necessary requirement that @xmath96 in a lattice definition of a chgt has been recovered .",
    "i now return to  option a \" in the introduction , the construction of lattice chgts using ordinary chiral symmetry , which leads us to consider gauge non - invariant approaches .",
    "as we have seen in the introduction , great care has to be taken with respect to the dynamics of the _ gdofs _  in any approach which is not gauge invariant on the lattice .",

    "therefore , for any given proposal , we need to find singularities in the charged fermion propagator , and understand their nature",

    "this can be done in many different ways . here",
    "i will discuss the implementation in which the gauge fields live on a lattice with spacing @xmath140 , and the fermions on a lattice with spacing @xmath141 @xcite .",

    ", the field @xmath181 is interpolated smoothly to a field @xmath182 with @xmath183 on the fermion lattice , and this interaction has the form @xmath184 this wilson ",
    "yukawa coupling is of the form @xmath185 with @xmath186 the fermion momenta , and @xmath187 the scalar momentum .",
    "because the scalar field lives on the coarse lattice , and is smoothly interpolated to the fine lattice , it contains only momenta less than or of order @xmath188 , and the @xmath189 function sets @xmath190 .",
    "this leads one to expect that for @xmath186 small this coupling is irrelevant , so that this interaction will not affect the physical modes , while it will be strong for large @xmath186 , so that it could potentially provide the doublers with a mass .",
    "this is not unlike a scenario envisaged long ago @xcite , which back then did not work @xcite because all fields lived on the same lattice , leading to strong couplings between the physical and doubler modes through wilson  yukawa - like interactions .",
    "the scalar and fermion spectrum of this model was studied numerically on lattices of size up to @xmath191 , with lattice - spacing ratios up to @xmath192 in the quenched approximation , with no further @xmath7-dependent terms in the action ( no hopping term ) , _ i.e. _  @xmath7 was taken to be a random @xmath60 phase .",
    "note that also in this case the smooth , covariant interpolation is non - local , in the sense described above . to date , there have been no analytic studies of this model .",
    "first , one expects @xmath193 to vanish ( @xmath7 is a random field ) , and this is indeed what was found , within errors .",
    "then , it was found that the @xmath194 two - point function could be fitted satisfactorily to a free scalar lattice propagator for momenta @xmath195 , with a scalar mass @xmath196 .",
    "this means that the unphysical degrees of freedom represented by @xmath194 are removed from the long - distance physics of the model by acquiring a mass of order the cutoff .",
    "note that the correlations leading to this mass are entirely due to the non - local nature of the interpolation , because the field @xmath194 would otherwise be a random field on the scale of the coarse lattice !",
    "fermion propagators were investigated in great detail , and here i will only be able to discuss part of the results . as we have seen , one important probe is the charged fermion propagator ( [ chprop ] ) , for which numerical results are shown in fig . 1 ( a very similar plot was obtained for the neutral fermion propagator ) .",
    "the data shown in the figure are obtained by first projecting @xmath197 _ etc_. , and then plotting the inverse of that , as a function of @xmath198 .",
    "the apparent poles at @xmath199 show up as a consequence of this way of representing the data .",
    "in fact , at least qualitatively , the data is well described by the _",

    "this implies that the rh part of the inverse charged propagator is singular near @xmath210 , the necessary condition for avoiding the nielsen  ninomiya theorem .",
    "however , this singularity , if our _ ansatz _ is correct , represents a _ pole _ in the inverse propagator . through the ward identities for the symmetry ( [ extgauge ] ) ( with @xmath211 constant ) ,",
    "this implies the existence of a pole in the vertex function , because the charged rh channel couples to the gauge field .",
    "such poles may in general lead to unphysical contributions to the @xmath212-function of the full theory @xcite .",
    "i believe that the puzzle about the nature of this singularity which apparently is present in the data should be resolved in order to assess the viability of this approach to putting chgts on the lattice . while it does look that the model reviewed here contains an undoubled lh charged fermion , it is not clear that there are no other light or massless unphysical modes .",
    "it should be noted that it is quite possible that the behavior sketched here is specific to two dimensions .",
    "an analytic study , or a more detailed numerical study , if feasible , would obviously be helpful in interpreting the data appropriately .",
    "i will return to this approach toward the end of this section .",
    "an alternative gauge non - invariant approach keeps the fermions and the gauge fields on the same lattice , but employs gauge fixing in order to control the _ gdofs _  @xcite .",
    "the central observation is that gauge fixing gives us the possibility to control both the transverse _ and _ longitudinal gauge fields in lattice perturbation theory , provided a suitable lattice action is chosen @xcite ( see below ) .",
    "in particular , gauge fixing suppresses fluctuations of the longitudinal components ( the _ gdofs _ ) , and we will see that this makes it possible to keep the fermions chiral , unlike _",
    "e.g. _  the example discussed in the introduction .",
    "however , as we will see , in order to turn lattice perturbation theory into a valid , systematic expansion scheme , non - perturbative considerations are important .",
    "again , i will consider wilson fermions , with a momentum - dependent mass term as in eq .",
    "( [ wilson ] ) in order to remove doublers . in the gauge - fixing approach one adds to the naively discretized theory with charged lh fermions and neutral rh fermions the terms @xmath213 where @xmath214 is the gauge parameter , and @xmath215 is a mass counter term .",
    "note that the parameter @xmath216 controls the longitudinal fluctuations just like @xmath217 controls the transverse fluctuations . because the wilson mass term breaks gauge invariance",
    ", there is no brst invariance on the lattice , and counter terms will be needed in order to recover the slavnov ",
    "taylor identities in the continuum limit @xcite .",
    "i will limit myself to the abelian case , for which no ghost fields are needed @xcite .",
    "addition of the covariant gauge - fixing term in eq .",
    "( [ gfappr ] ) makes the theory perturbatively renormalizable , and this determines the form of the counter terms : one simply has to add all possible terms up to mass dimension 4 consistent with the exact symmetries of the regulated theory .",
    "the most important of these is the gauge - field mass term ; all others are of dimension 4 ( because of shift symmetries @xcite ) . to this point",
    ", we are just describing what happens if one uses a gauge non - invariant perturbative regulator .",
    "of course , for this to work non - perturbatively , the lattice version of the gauge - fixing term proportional to @xmath218 has to be chosen such that the ( non - perturbative ) phase diagram of the lattice theory has a critical point which is described by this perturbative expansion .",
    "one has to choose the lattice gauge - fixing action such that the perturbative vacuum @xmath219 ( or , on the lattice , @xmath220 ) gives the dominant contribution in a saddle - point approximation to the lattice theory . that this can be done was shown in ref .",
    "the idea is to choose a gauge - fixing term on the lattice roughly of the form @xmath221 $ ] , with the irrelevant @xmath222 term stabilizing the perturbative vacuum @xmath219 , without otherwise affecting the long - distance behavior .",
    "( this shape can be maintained to all orders in perturbation theory by adjusting the counter terms . ) the phase diagram which emerges is shown in fig .",
    "2 , where only the @xmath223-@xmath216 plane is shown @xcite ( see these refs . for other counter terms ) .    consider first the theory without fermions . in a bounded region around the origin ,",
    "_ i.e. _  for small @xmath223 and @xmath216 , the gauge - fixing and mass terms do not change the critical behavior of the theory : this region of the phase diagram is filled by a coulomb phase @xcite . since @xmath216 is small",
    ", wcpt does not apply in this region . for large @xmath216 ,",
    "wcpt is applicable , and one finds a critical line where the gauge field is massless by tuning the counter term @xmath223 to a critical value @xmath224 . for @xmath223",
    "too large , @xmath225 is positive , and the gauge field acquires a mass . for @xmath223 too small , @xmath226 , which signals symmetry breaking . since in this case",
    "@xmath162 acquires an expectation value @xmath227 , the broken symmetry is hypercubic invariance !",
    "sketch of the relevant part of the phase diagram for the gauge - fixing approach . for full details on the complete diagram ,",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "moreover , with our choice of irrelevant terms ( @xmath222 ) , this transition is continuous .",
    "to lowest order in wcpt , the classical potential for the gauge field is ( roughly ) @xmath228 without the @xmath222 term , we would find a first order phase transition going from @xmath229 to @xmath230 ( where at tree level @xmath231 ) , but with the @xmath222 term , the transition is continuous .",
    "we see that the usual adjustment of the gauge - field mass counter term corresponds , as desired , to a continuous phase transition between two distinct phases above and below the critical line @xmath232 . for details ,",
    "see refs .",
    "@xcite ( for an earlier informal account , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . a naive discretization of @xmath233 without the @xmath222-like term leads to a very different phase diagram , without the desired critical behavior @xcite .",
    "we thus recover maxwell theory ( without fermions , thus far ) in two different ways : inside the coulomb phase , and for large @xmath216 near the critical line @xmath232 .",
    "the difference is that lattice perturbation theory only applies in the latter case , and this will be essential to our goal of obtaining undoubled chiral fermions . inside the coulomb phase , the situation would be similar to the example in the introduction ; the gauge - fixing term would not be strong enough to control the longitudinal gauge field , _ i.e. _  the _",
    "gdofs_.    we now turn to the fermions .",
    "first , since they are coupled to the gauge field through the gauge coupling @xmath115 , which is small , one expects no qualitative change in the nature of the phase diagram .",
    "the issue is whether the  back reaction \" of the gauge fields , in particular the _ gdofs _ , is small as well .",
    "since this is now also governed by wcpt , one expects that the fermion spectrum does not differ from that of the classical continuum limit .",
    "this is precisely what we find .",
    "because the danger resides in the dynamics of the _ gdofs _ , it is enough to consider ( again , as we did in the two - cutoff approach ) only the interactions between the fermions and the _ gdofs_. as in eq .",
    "( [ wilsongauged ] ) , we rotate @xmath234 , and we set @xmath235 , under which eq .",
    "( [ gfappr ] ) goes over into @xmath236 where @xmath237 stand for the various @xmath128 self interactions coming from the lattice versions of the gauge - fixing , mass , and other counter terms .",
    "this model can be studied in wcpt in @xmath238 by rescaling @xmath239 @xcite .",
    "the following heuristic arguments describe what happens .",
    "first , near @xmath240 the @xmath241 propagator goes like @xmath242 , _",
    "i.e. _  the @xmath241 field has mass dimension zero .",
    "moreover , one finds that @xcite @xmath243 this is analogous to the behavior of a near massless scalar in two dimensions @xcite .",
    "this means that at @xmath240 the lh and rh symmetries ( @xmath211 and @xmath244 in eq .",
    "( [ extgauge ] ) ) are unbroken .",
    "this is an important result : we are after a chgt with unbroken gauge symmetry , wherein the _ gdofs",
    "_  @xmath7 are to decouple completely !",
    "second , we may now expand the wilson term in eq .",
    "( [ gfgauged ] ) , obtaining @xmath245 the first term is the standard wilson term , removing the fermion doublers .",
    "in addition , we see that the interaction terms between the fermions and the field @xmath241 are all of dimension 5 , and hence irrelevant ! they may lead to contact terms in fermionic correlation functions , but they do not change the long - distance behavior of the fermion fields .    of course , a more rigorous argument is needed to confirm this picture in the presence of the unusual infrared singular behavior of the @xmath241 field .",
    "a study in one - loop resummed wcpt was performed in ref .",
    "@xcite , and detailed ( quenched ) numerical computations were done in ref .",
    "the numerical and analytic calculations are in good quantitative agreement with each other , and confirm the analysis described above .",
    "we conclude that this theory contains undoubled chiral fermions , with the lh charged fermion coupling to the gauge field , and the rh neutral fermion decoupling in the continuum limit .",
    "the _ gdofs _",
    "( @xmath241 ) decouple in the continuum limit as well , as they should .",
    "the gauge - fixing action gives the _ gdofs _  the sophisticated dynamics alluded to in the introduction . since the transverse gauge field couples weakly to the fermions , one does not expect any drastic change from our conclusions in the full theory containing _ both _ dynamical fermions and the full gauge field .",
    "the central idea in this approach is to secure renormalizability even in the absence of gauge invariance .",
    "the key ingredient is gauge fixing , and one would therefore expect universality with respect to the choice of lattice fermions .",
    "this was indeed confirmed by a combined perturbative and numerical study using domain - wall fermions instead of wilson fermions @xcite .",
    "the main issue in extending this method to non - abelian chgts is the existence of gribov copies .",
    "little work has been done in this direction at present , and therefore i will not devote much space to it here .",
    "a promising approach appears to be to use the non - perturbative gauge - fixing method proposed by jona - lasinio and parrinello and by zwanziger @xcite . for speculative thoughts on how to apply this method to chgts ,",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "as in subsection 3.1 , we may again ask what happens to the charged fermion propagator in the gauge - fixing approach .",
    "the charged rh fermion field is , as before , @xmath246 but now with @xmath241 describing the modes of the scalar field @xmath7 .",
    "since this scalar field decouples from the fermions for @xmath94 , this composite operator describes exactly what it shows : a multiparticle state composed of rh neutral fermions and ( higher - derivative ) scalars in the continuum limit .",
    "the lh charged fermion itself is a free field in the model of eq .",
    "( [ gfgauged ] ) , and one finds for the lh , resp .",
    "rh components of the charged fermion propagator @xcite @xmath247 with @xmath125 given in eq .",
    "( [ vev ] ) .",
    "we see that , also in the gauge - fixing approach , the inverse charged propagator does not have a continuous derivative at @xmath21 .",
    "but now this singularity takes the form of a cut occurring in the rh channel , as one would expect if @xmath138 creates a multiparticle state .",
    "because all these excitations ( @xmath3 and @xmath241 ) are massless , the cut has a branch point at @xmath21 .",
    "it is interesting to compare this with our interpretation of what happens in the two - cutoff approach . in both approaches",
    "the unphysical scalars decouple , but in different ways . in the two - cutoff study ,",
    "the _ gdofs _  get a mass of order the cutoff @xmath188 , while in the gauge - fixing case , they are massless at the relevant critical point , but have no interactions with the physical sector .",
    "one would expect that these two different ways of decoupling the _ gdofs _  lead to different singularities in the charged fermion propagator .",
    "it is possible that the pole - like singularity exhibited in fig . 1 is a finite - volume artifact , and",
    "would turn into a branch point in infinite volume .",
    "however , the existence of a branch point at @xmath21 is difficult to reconcile with scalar fields with a mass of order the cutoff .",
    "clearly , a better understanding is needed for the two - cutoff method .",
    "in this talk , i have covered what i consider the most important developments since the last general review of this field @xcite .",
    "there has been a tremendous amount of progress , and we appear to be much closer to satisfactory constructions of lattice chgts . however , the job is not done yet .    around the time of shamir s 1995 review , the fundamental problem with regard to maintaining the chiral fermion spectrum in the presence of interactions with _ gdofs",
    "_  had been well understood , and both the gauge - fixing and the two - cutoff or interpolation methods have been proposed in order to specifically address this issue .",
    "more recently , lscher has realized that it may even be possible to formulate chgts on the lattice in a manifestly gauge - invariant way , provided that ( at least ) the fermion representation is anomaly free . in this approach ,",
    "the nielsen  ninomiya theorem is circumvented by modifying chiral symmetry on the lattice such that it yields the usual chiral ward identities in the continuum limit , and yet does not lead to species doubling . in order to define chgts , the phase of the chiral determinant has to be chosen so as to not violate gauge invariance .",
    "obviously , the advantage of a manifestly gauge - invariant construction is that the _ gdofs _  decouple already from the physical excitations at finite lattice spacing .",
    "in order to show that chgts can be put on the lattice in a gauge - invariant way , a complete classification of all anomalies , both local and global , is necessary .",
    "such a classification was accomplished for the case of abelian chgts .",
    "a crucial element is the admissibility constraint eq .",
    "( [ adm ] ) .",
    "it is interesting to observe that , while this constraint is not expected to change the universality class in the weak - coupling limit @xcite , it does change the strong - coupling behavior of this lattice version of chgts relative to that of vector - like theories . for the non - abelian case",
    ", there is a conjecture that the standard anomaly - cancellation condition @xmath96 is sufficient for removing all local anomalies .",
    "little is known at present about a classification of global obstructions and their possible dependence on boundary conditions .",
    "it is interesting to compare this state of affairs with the gauge - fixing approach .",
    "the latter approach also has succeeded in formulating abelian chgts on the lattice , while it is presently unknown whether it can be extended to the non - abelian case .",
    "both methods admit weak - coupling perturbation theory , and both are perturbatively renormalizable . in both cases",
    "unitarity is _ not _ manifest , but could in principle be established perturbatively to all orders .    of course , in principle , there is a theoretical advantage in having a manifestly gauge - invariant formulation on the lattice .",
    "however , even in the abelian case , where progress has been sufficient to compare the two methods , this advantage comes at a price .",
    "it is clear that the gauge - invariant approach is more difficult to implement numerically , because it is numerically very expensive to compute the overlap - dirac operator , or equivalently , @xmath58 .",
    "other approaches , such as gauge fixing , may be technically simpler , even if they lack exact gauge invariance at the regularized level .",
    "it is important to remember that what is required is only the recovery of gauge invariance in the continuum limit , _",
    "i.e. _  at scales much below the cutoff @xmath0 .",
    "an assumption here is , of course , that the various different ways of putting chgts on the lattice all describe the same universality class .    at present , there exists two types of gauge non - invariant methods , the one based on gauge fixing discussed above , and the two - cutoff or interpolation approach .",
    "the way in which the gauge - fixing methods avoids the nielsen  ninomiya theorem is well understood , and it has been demonstrated both analytically and numerically that chiral fermions can be put on the lattice .",
    "the main problem lies in the extension of this approach to non - abelian chgts , because of the issue of gribov copies .",
    "this can not be said of the two - cutoff approach , in which the behavior of the fermion spectrum is not fully understood beyond perturbation theory . the work of ref .",
    "@xcite has contributed significantly to a clarification of what the important open problems are in this respect .",
    "i believe that it is important to gain more analytic insight in this case in order to assess its viability .",
    "an issue which i did not touch on in this review is that of fermion - number violation . in my view , this issue is _ not _ central to the problem of constructing lattice chgts . if an approach is successful , this particular problem  will take care of itself . \"",
    "this does not imply that it is not interesting to understand in detail how this works out for a given approach . for general discussions of the problem within the context of lattice chgts , see refs .",
    "@xcite . in the gauge invariant",
    "approach , fermion number is violated just as it is in the continuum , through the measure of the fermionic path integral @xcite .",
    "for the two - cutoff approach , see refs .",
    "@xcite , and for the gauge - fixing approach , see ref .",
    "@xcite .    finally , there is the question whether it will ever be possible to investigate chgts dynamically on the lattice .",
    "after all , while it is interesting to learn how chgts may be put on the lattice , one would like to learn more about issues such as dynamical symmetry breaking in chgts , for which also analytic methods have contributed relatively little insight .",
    "while full - fledged numerical simulations are clearly not within reach yet ( the hardest problem being that of a complex measure @xcite ) , it may be possible to probe , within a given approach , the phase of the fermion determinant , for instance on an ensemble of quenched configurations .",
    "the behavior of the fluctuations of the phase of the determinant should tell us something about how different chgts are dynamically from vector - like gauge theories .",
    "of course , we are not there yet , since non - abelian chgts are more interesting than abelian chgts , and the task of putting non - abelian chgts on the lattice has not yet been completed .",
