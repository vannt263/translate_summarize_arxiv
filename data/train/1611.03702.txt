    "<S> floquet states can be realized in quantum systems driven by continuous time - periodic perturbations . </S>",
    "<S> it is known that a state known as the floquet weyl semimetal can be realized when free dirac fermions are placed in a rotating electric field . </S>",
    "<S> what will happen if strong interaction is introduced to this system ? </S>",
    "<S> will the interaction wash out the characteristic features of weyl semimetals such as the hall response ? </S>",

    "<S> we answer these questions using ads / cft correspondence in the @xmath0 supersymmetric massless qcd in a rotating electric field in the large @xmath1 limit realizing the first example of a `` holographic floquet state '' . in this limit , </S>",
    "<S> gluons not only mediate interaction , but also act as an energy reservoir and stabilize the nonequilibrium steady state ( ness ) . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain the electric current induced by a rotating electric field : in the high frequency region , the ohm s law is satisfied , while we recover the dc nonlinear conductivity at low frequency , which was obtained holographically in a previous work . </S>",
    "<S> the thermodynamic properties of the ness , e.g. , fluctuation - dissipation relation , is characterized by the effective hawking temperature that is defined from the effective horizon giving a holographic meaning to the `` periodic thermodynamic '' concept . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the strong ( pump ) rotating electric field , we apply an additional weak ( probe ) electric field in the spirit of the pump - probe experiments done in condensed matter experiments . </S>",
    "<S> weak dc and ac probe analysis in the background rotating electric field shows hall currents as a linear response , therefore the hall response of floquet weyl semimetals survives at the strong coupling limit . </S>",
    "<S> we also find frequency mixed response currents , i.e. , a heterodyning effect , characteristic to periodically driven floquet systems .     </S>",
