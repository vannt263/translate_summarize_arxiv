    "one of the most important prediction of general relativity is gravitational radiation . coalescing neutron star binaries",
    "are considered among the strongest and most likely sources of gravitational waves to be seen by virgo / ligo interferometers @xcite . due to the emission of gravitational radiation",
    ", binary neutron stars decrease their orbital separation and finally merge .",
    "gravitational waves emitted during the last few orbits of inspiral could yield important informations about the equation of state ( eos ) of dense matter @xcite . with accurate templates of gravitational waves from coalescing binary compact stars",
    ", it may be possible to extract information about physics of neutron stars from signals observed by the interferometers and to solve one of the central but also most complex problem of physics  the problem of the absolute ground state of matter at high densities .",
    "it is still an open question whether the core of a neutron star consists mainly of superfluid neutrons or exotic matter like strange quark matter , pions or kaons condensates ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "the possibility of the existence of quark matter dates back to the early seventies .",
    "bodmer @xcite remarked that matter consisting of deconfined up , down and strange quarks could be the absolute ground state of matter at zero pressure and temperature . if this is true then objects made of such matter , the so - called _ strange stars _ , could exist @xcite .",
    "strange quark stars are currently considered as a possible alternative to neutron stars as compact objects ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the evolution of a binary system of compact objects is entirely driven by gravitational radiation and can be roughly divided into three phases : point - like inspiral , hydrodynamical inspiral and merger .",
    "the first phase corresponds to large orbital separation ( much larger than the neutron star radius ) and can be treated analytically using the post - newtonian ( pn ) approximation to general relativity ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) . in the second phase",
    "the orbital separation becomes only a few times larger than the radius of the star , so the effects of tidal deformation , finite size and hydrodynamics play an important role . in this phase , since the shrinking time of the orbital radius due to the emission of gravitational waves is still larger than the orbital period , it is possible to approximate the state as quasi - equilibrium @xcite .",
    "the final phase of the evolution is the merger of the two objects , which occur dynamically @xcite .",
    "note that quasi - equilibrium computations from the second phase provide valuable initial data for the merger @xcite .",
    "almost all studies of the final phase of the inspiral of close binary neutron star systems employ a simplified eos of dense matter , namely a polytropic eos @xcite .",
    "there are only two exceptions : ( i ) oechslin et al .",
    "have used a pure nuclear matter eos , based on a relativistic mean field model and a ` hybrid ' eos with a phase transition to quark matter at high density @xcite ; ( ii ) bejger et al .",
    "have computed quasi - equilibrium sequences based on three nuclear matter eos @xcite . in this article",
    "we present results on the hydrodynamical phase of inspiraling binary strange quark stars described by mit bag model .",
    "the calculations are performed in the framework of _ isenberg - wilson - mathews _ approximation to general relativity ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) .",
    "we consider binary systems consisting of two identical stars .",
    "we choose the gravitational mass of each star to be @xmath3 in infinite separation in order to be consistent with recent population synthesis calculations @xcite and with the current set of well - measured neutron star masses in relativistic binary radio pulsars @xcite .",
    "we compare the evolution of a strange star binary system with a neutron star binary in order to find any characteristic features in the gravitational waveform that will help to distinguish between strange stars and neutron stars .",
    "we consider two limiting cases of velocity flow in stellar interior : the irrotational and the synchronized case in order to exhibit the differences between these two extreme states .",
    "the irrotational case is more realistic since the viscosity of neutron star matter ( or strange star matter ) is far too low to ensure synchronization during the late stage of the inspiral @xcite . due to the finite density at the surface of bare strange stars",
    ", we had to introduce a treatment of the boundary condition for the velocity potential ( in the irrotational case ) different from that of neutron stars , where the density vanishes at the stellar surface .",
    "the paper is organized in the following way : sec .",
    "ii is a brief summary of the assumptions upon which this work is based , sec .",
    "iii is devoted to the description of the eos used to describe strange stars and neutron stars . in sec .",
    "iv we briefly describe the basic equations for quasi - equilibrium and derive the boundary condition required for solving the fluid equation of irrotational flow with finite surface density , which is relevant for strange stars . in sec .",
    "v we present the numerical results for corotating and irrotational strange stars binaries and compare their quasistationary evolution with that of neutron stars , as well as with that of post - newtonian point - masses .",
    "section vi contains the final discussion . throughout the paper",
    ", we use geometrized units , for which @xmath4 , where @xmath5 and @xmath6 denote the gravitational constant and speed of light respectively .",
    "the first assumption regards the matter stress - energy tensor @xmath7 , which we assume to have the * perfect fluid * form : = ( e+p ) + p , where @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are respectively the fluid proper energy density , the fluid pressure , the fluid 4-velocity , and the spacetime metric .",
    "this is a very good approximation for neutron star matter or strange star matter .",
    "the last orbits of inspiraling binary compact stars can be studied in the * quasi - equilibrium * approximation . under this assumption",
    "the evolution of a system is approximated by a sequence of exactly circular orbits .",
    "this assumption results from the fact that the time evolution of an orbit is still much larger than the orbital period and that the gravitational radiation circularizes an orbit of a binary system .",
    "this implies a continuous spacetime symmetry , called _ helical symmetry _",
    "@xcite represented by the killing vector : = t + , where @xmath12 is the orbital angular velocity and @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the natural frame vectors associated with the time coordinate @xmath15 and the azimuthal coordinate @xmath16 of an asymptotic inertial observer .",
    "one can then introduce the _ shift vector _",
    "@xmath17 of co - orbiting coordinates by means of the orthogonal decomposition of @xmath18 with respect to the @xmath19 foliation of the standard 3 + 1 formalism : [ e : helicoidal_n ] = n - , where @xmath20 is the unit future directed vector normal to @xmath19 , @xmath21 is called the _ lapse function _ and @xmath22 .",
    "we also assume that the spatial part of the metric ( i.e. the metric induced by @xmath11 on each hypersurface @xmath19 ) is conformally flat , which corresponds to the * isenberg - wilson - mathews * ( iwm ) approximation to general relativity @xcite ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a discussion ) .",
    "thanks to this approximation we have to solve only five of the ten einstein equations . in the iwm approximation ,",
    "the spacetime metric takes the form : ds^2 = -(n^2 -b_i b^i ) dt^2 -2b_i dt dx^i + a^2 f_ij dx^i dx^j , [ eq : metric ] where @xmath23 is some conformal factor , @xmath24 the flat spatial metric and latin indices run in @xmath25 ( spatial indices ) . the comparison between the iwm results presented here and the non - conformally flat ones will be performed in a future article @xcite .",
    "the fourth assumption concerns the fluid motion inside each star .",
    "we consider two limiting cases : * synchronized * ( also called corotating ) motion and * irrotational * flow ( assuming that the fluid has zero vorticity in the inertial frame ) . the latter state is more realistic .",
    "we consider only * equal - mass * binaries consisting of identical stars with gravitational masses @xmath26 measured in infinite separation .",
    "the main reason for choosing these particular masses is that five out of six observed binary radio pulsars have mass ratio close to unity and gravitational masses of each star @xmath27 @xcite . in addition population synthesis calculations",
    "@xcite have shown that a significant fraction of the observed binary neutron stars in gravitational waves will contain stars with equal masses @xmath28 and systems consisting of a low and a high mass neutron star .",
    "0.8 cm   versus areal radius @xmath29 for sequences of static strange quark stars described by the simplest mit bag model ( solid line ) and neutron stars described by polytropic eos with @xmath30 and @xmath31 ( dashed line ) .",

    "it is therefore interesting to check if the properties of inspiraling strange stars can be predicted by studying binaries consisting of polytropic neutron stars having the same mass and the same compactness parameter .",
    "therefore we perform calculations for two different equations of state of dense matter : a strange quark matter eos and a polytropic eos .    typically , strange stars are modeled @xcite with an equation of state based on the mit - bag model of quark matter , in which quark confinement is described by an energy term proportional to the volume @xcite .",
    "the equation of state is given by the simple formula [ e : sseos ] p = a(-_0 ) , [ sseosn ] n(p ) = n_0 ^ 1/(1+a ) , where @xmath36 is the baryon density and @xmath37 are some constants depending on the 3 parameters of the model ( the bag constant @xmath38 , the mass of the strange quarks @xmath39 and the strenght of the qcd coupling constant @xmath40 ) .",
    "in general this equation corresponds to a self - bound matter with mass density @xmath41 and baryon density @xmath42 at zero pressure and with a fixed sound velocity ( @xmath43 ) at all pressures .",
    "it was shown that different strange quark models can be approximated very well by eqs ( [ e : sseos ] ) and ( [ sseosn ] ) @xcite .    in the numerical calculations reported in the present paper we describe strange quark matter using the simplest mit bag model ( with massless and non - interacting quarks ) , for which the formula ( [ e : sseos ] ) is exact .",
