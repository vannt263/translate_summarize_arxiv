    "network users may face critical events where life or livelihood is at risk .",
    "examples include a fire in a building , a natural disaster in a region , a heart attack of a patient , and a military attack by an enemy .",
    "when a network user detects a critical event , it is important for the user to inform relevant rescue parties of the event as early as possible so that they can take necessary measures to mitigate the risk or help affected parties recover .",
    "the goal of this paper is to devise a medium access control ( mac ) protocol that achieves a small delay in transmitting information about critical events , or critical traffic , in a distributed wireless communication network . since critical events do not occur frequently , especially when the network size is small , it is also important to maintain good performance in terms of throughput and fairness when there is no critical traffic in the network .    in a network with critical traffic ,",
    "a mac protocol needs to achieve two kinds of coordination : ( i ) coordination between a user with critical traffic and other users in the case of a critical event and ( ii ) coordination among users when there is no critical traffic .",
    "these two kinds of coordination can be easily achieved if message passing is allowed . in the case of a critical event",
    ", the user with critical traffic can be given priority by broadcasting its traffic type to induce other users to wait while critical traffic is transmitted .",
    "also , when there is no critical traffic , users can share the communication medium in a contention - free manner by using coordination messages from a central controller as in time division multiple access ( tdma ) .",
    "however , explicit message passing is costly and often impractical in a distributed network environment , which makes achieving coordination a challenging task .    in this paper",
    ", we aim to achieve coordination without explicit message passing by using an extension of mac protocols with memory , formulated in @xcite .",
    "@xcite considers a stationary setting without critical events and investigates how utilizing memory can help users achieve coordination of the second kind in a distributed environment . with a protocol with memory , users determine their transmission probabilities based on the finite - length history of their own observations ( transmission actions and feedback information ) .",
    "as users take transmission actions in a probabilistic manner , the history of users evolves differently across users as time passes . using the variations in the history of users as a coordination device",
    ", we can obtain some degree of coordination without relying on explicit message passing .",
    "the setting considered in this paper is stochastic in that the traffic types of users are determined by an exogenous event . in order to achieve a small delay in transmitting critical traffic ( i.e. , coordination of the first kind ) , we need to treat users with different traffic types in a different way .",
    "thus , we extend protocols with memory so that transmission probabilities adjust not only to the history of observations but also to the history of traffic types .",
    "the proposed protocols are adaptive because users can change the modes of operation based on their traffic types .",
    "adaptive protocols with memory proposed in this paper have the following properties :    1 .",
    "( coordination in a critical phase ) when a critical event occurs , the user with critical traffic captures the channel after a small delay while other users wait until critical traffic is completely transmitted .",
    "furthermore , a delay constraint can be imposed to guarantee the average delay below a certain threshold level .",
    "2 .   ( coordination in a normal phase ) when there is no critical traffic , a success period and a contention period are alternated .",
    "a success period contains consecutive successes by a single user while a contention period selects a successful user for the following success period equally likely among all users .",
    "the average duration of a success period can be made arbitrarily large ( at the expense of reduced short - term fairness ) without affecting the average duration of a contention period .",
    "( no explicit message passing ) the proposed protocols can be implemented without explicit message passing between users or between a central controller and a user .",
    "4 .   ( short memory ) the proposed protocols utilize finite memory of a short length ( 1-slot memory at minimum ) , thus exhibiting low complexity .",
    "the proposed adaptive protocols have advantages over existing mac protocols in dealing with critical traffic .",
    "distributed coordination function ( dcf ) , which is widely deployed in the ieee 802.11a / b / g wireless local area network ( wlan ) @xcite , does not differentiate users , and thus it is unable to give priority to a user with critical traffic . slotted aloha @xcite has the same limitation .",
    "users can be given different priorities depending on their access categories in enhanced distributed channel access ( edca ) , which is deployed in ieee 802.11e @xcite .",
    "edca specifies different contention window sizes and arbitration interframe spaces ( aifs ) to different access categories , yielding a smaller medium access delay and more bandwidth for the higher - priority traffic categories @xcite .",
    "however , edca is designed to support applications requiring quality - of - service , and a user having highest - priority data shares the channel with other users .",
    "thus , edca is not directly applicable to networks with critical traffic , where it is desirable to allocate the entire resource to a user with critical traffic .",
    "p - mac @xcite also differentiates users with different traffic classes by specifying different contention window sizes .",
    "however , p - mac does not use aifs , which creates a problem when applied to a network with critical traffic because even a user with the highest priority has a positive probability of collision at each transmission attempt .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we describe the system model . in section iii",
    ", we provide a formal representation of adaptive protocols , define three performance metrics , and formulate a protocol design problem . in section iv",
    ", we provide analytical results on how to compute the performance metrics for a given adaptive protocol . in section",
    "v , we solve the protocol design problem using numerical methods . in section",
    "vi , we discuss how adaptive protocols can be enhanced by utilizing longer memory .",
    "in section vii , we provide simulation results . in section viii",
    ", we conclude the paper .",
    "we consider a communication channel shared by @xmath0 contending users , or transmitter - receiver pairs .",
    "we assume that the number of users is fixed over time and known to users .",
    "time is divided into slots of equal length , and users maintain synchronized time slots .",
    "a user always has packets to transmit and can attempt to transmit one packet in each slot . due to interference , only one user can transmit successfully in a slot , and simultaneous transmission by more than one user results in a collision .",
    "after a user makes a transmission attempt , it learns whether the transmission is successful or not using an acknowledgement ( ack ) response .",
    "we assume that there is no error in sending and receiving ack signals .",
    "while a user waits , it senses the channel to learn whether the channel is accessed or not .",
    "given this feedback structure , the set of the observations of a user in a slot can be defined as @xmath1 , as in @xcite .",
    "the observation of user @xmath2 , denoted by @xmath3 , is _ idle _ if no user transmits , _ busy _ if user @xmath2 does not transmit but at least one other user transmits , _ success _ if user @xmath2 transmits and succeeds , and _ failure _ if user @xmath2 transmits but fails .",
    "users are subject to critical events such as emergencies and crises .",
    "if a critical event occurs to a user , the user is required to send critical traffic such as a rescue message describing the critical event .",
    "we assume that the length of critical traffic , measured by the number of packets needed to transmit it , is determined randomly .",
    "we say that a user s traffic is normal if its traffic is not critical . we use critical and normal users to refer to users with critical and normal traffic , respectively .",
    "we denote the type of user @xmath2 s traffic by @xmath4 and the set of the types by @xmath5 so that @xmath6 .",
    "we assume that the observation and traffic type of a user are its local information .",
    "that is , users do not know the observations and the types of other users .",
    "lastly , we assume that critical events occur infrequently so that there is at most one critical user at a time in the system .",
    "we restrict our attention to distributed protocols with which no control or coordination messages are exchanged between a central controller and a user or between users .",
    "we label slots by @xmath7 and use superscript @xmath8 to denote variables pertinent to slot @xmath8 .",
    "the history of user @xmath2 in slot @xmath8 contains all the information it has obtained before making a transmission decision in slot @xmath8 and can be written as @xmath9 for @xmath10 , and @xmath11 .",
    "let @xmath12 be the set of all possible histories for a user in slot @xmath8 .",
    "then the set of all possible histories for a user can be defined by @xmath13 . a decision rule for a user",
    "can be formally represented by a mapping from @xmath14 to @xmath15 $ ] , prescribing a transmission probability following each possible history .",
    "a protocol is defined to be a collection of decision rules , one for each user .    in this paper",
    ", we restrict our attention to a simple class of protocols with the following two properties .",
    "first , we require that protocols be symmetric in the sense that it assigns the same decision rule to every user .",
    "the symmetry requirement can be justified by noting that symmetric protocols are easy to implement and that users in our model are _ ex ante _ identical .",
    "moreover , it simplifies our analysis significantly .",
    "second , we require that protocols use only the most recent observation and the current traffic type in a stationary way ( i.e. , independent of slot label @xmath8 ) .",
    "this requirement is motivated by a presumption that a protocol using short memory is easy to program and validate .",
    "we call a protocol satisfying the above two requirements an adaptive mac protocol with 1-slot memory , or more simply , an adaptive protocol",
    ". it can be represented by a mapping @xmath16 $ ] , which determines the transmission probability of user @xmath2 in slot @xmath8 as @xmath17 for @xmath7 , where we set @xmath18 as initialization .",
    "note that adaptive protocols can be regarded as an extension of protocols with 1-slot memory @xcite in that adaptive protocols allow transmission parameters to adjust to an exogenous state variable ( the traffic type in this paper ) .",
    "in other words , with an adaptive protocol a user can change its modes of operation depending on its state .",
    "we define a critical phase as a period that begins with an occurrence of a critical event and ends with the completion of critical traffic associated with the critical event .",
    "let @xmath19 be the random variable of the length of critical traffic , measured in slots .",
    "a protocol determines the average number of slots that a critical phase lasts , denoted by @xmath20 .",
    "the delay in a critical phase is defined as the average number of non - success slots during a critical phase , @xmath21.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]      we define a normal phase as a period without critical traffic , between two critical phases . the channel utilization ( or throughput ) of users in a normal phase",
    "is defined as the proportion of time slots in which a successful transmission occurs during a normal phase and can be expressed as @xmath22      given an adaptive protocol @xmath23 , in a normal phase a successful user has another success in the next slot with probability @xmath24 .",
    "the average number of consecutive successes by a user starting from an initial success in a normal phase is denoted by @xmath25 and is given by @xmath26 a protocol with a large value of @xmath25 can be considered as unfair in the short term because it suppresses the transmission opportunities of other waiting users once a success occurs .",
    "hence , we define the fairness level in a normal phase as the inverse of the average number of consecutive successes in a normal phase , @xmath27    _ remark . _ @xcite defines that a protocol is @xmath28-short - term fair if @xmath29 .",
    "@xcite captures short - term fairness by considering average delay , which is defined as the average waiting time of a user until its next success starting from an arbitrary point of time .",
    "although the concept of average delay is more comprehensive than the average number of consecutive successes ( as delay can be created by other reasons than consecutive successes ) , we use the latter in this paper because it is much simpler to compute and is a good proxy for the former in the case of protocols with 1-slot memory .      suppose that the protocol designer has preferences on the three performance metrics , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 , and that his preferences are represented by a utility function @xmath33 . noting that a protocol determines the three performance metrics , we can express the protocol design problem as @xmath34 where @xmath35 denotes the set of all adaptive protocols .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that the protocol designer prefers protocols that yield a small delay in a critical phase as well as a high channel utilization and a high fairness level in a normal phase .",
    "thus , we assume that @xmath33 is decreasing in the first argument and increasing in the second and third arguments . since the solution to the protocol design problem depends highly on the specification of the utility function , we impose the following structure on the protocol and the utility function in order to reduce the problem into a simpler one that is readily solvable .    first , in order to achieve a small value of @xmath30 , we focus on adaptive protocols satisfying @xmath36 for all @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "we call such a protocol non - intrusive . a non - intrusive protocol guarantees that once a critical user has a successful transmission , its transmission is not interrupted by other users ( with normal traffic ) until it completes the transmission of its critical traffic .",
    "second , we assume that the protocol designer has the most preferred fairness level in a normal phase , denoted by @xmath39 $ ] , regardless of the other two performance metrics . then setting @xmath40 together with @xmath38 implies @xmath41 .",
    "now it remains to specify @xmath42 and @xmath43 , which we denote by @xmath44 and @xmath45 , respectively , for notational simplicity .",
    "the class of adaptive protocols we consider can be written as @xmath46 and we call a protocol in this class a @xmath47-fair non - intrusive adaptive protocol .",
    "lastly , we assume that the protocol designer has a threshold level @xmath48 for the delay in a critical phase such that his preferences on @xmath30 is expressed entirely with a delay constraint of the form @xmath49 .",
    "that is , only protocols with @xmath30 no larger than @xmath50 are acceptable to the protocol designer while he does not care about the exact value of @xmath30 as long as the delay constraint is satisfied . under the three restrictions ,",
    "the protocol design problem is reduced to finding a @xmath47-fair non - intrusive adaptive protocol that solves @xmath51 ^ 2 } c_{norm } \\textrm { subject to } d_{crit } \\leq \\eta.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in section iv we explain how to compute @xmath31 and @xmath30 analytically given a @xmath47-fair non - intrusive adaptive protocol , whereas in section v we investigate the solution to using numerical illustrations .",
    "_ the operation of a @xmath47-fair non - intrusive adaptive protocol in a normal phase is analogous to @xmath52-persistent csma @xcite .",
    "users wait when the channel is sensed busy and transmit with probability @xmath44 and @xmath45 following an idle slot and a collision , respectively .",
    "since we consider saturated arrivals where each user always has packets to transmit , we introduce @xmath47 as a stopping probability in order to prevent a single user from using the channel exclusively .",
    "consider a slot @xmath8 in which a normal phase begins . since slot",
    "@xmath53 is the last slot of a critical phase , there exists a user @xmath2 that completed the transmission of its critical traffic in slot @xmath53 .",
    "since user @xmath2 had a successful transmission in slot @xmath53 , we have @xmath54 and @xmath55 for all @xmath56 , and thus in slot @xmath8 user @xmath2 transmits with probability @xmath57 while other users wait .",
    "hence , a normal phase begins with a success by the user that had critical traffic in the previous critical phase with probability @xmath57 and with an idle slot with probability @xmath47 . , we can set @xmath58 if @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "then all users including the user that had critical traffic wait in the first slot of a normal phase , which makes users contend with an equal transmission probability in the second slot . ]    to compute the channel utilization in a normal phase @xmath31 , we construct a markov chain whose state space is @xmath61 , where state @xmath62 represents transmission outcomes in which exactly @xmath62 users transmit . the transition probability from state @xmath62 to state @xmath63 in a normal phase , @xmath64 , under a @xmath47-fair non - intrusive adaptive protocol",

    "the average number of consecutive successes in a normal phase , @xmath25 , is determined by the fairness level @xmath47 , where the relationship is given by @xmath67 .",
    "a series of consecutive successes by a user ends with an idle slot , when the successful user waits .",
    "let @xmath68 be the average number of non - success slots until the first success starting from an idle slot during a normal phase .",
    "a normal phase can be considered as the alternation of a success period and a contention period , which is continued until a critical event occurs .",
    "a success period is characterized by consecutive successes by a user , whereas a contention period begins with an idle slot and lasts until a user succeeds .",
    "since all users transmit with the same transmission probability following an idle slot , each user has an equal chance of becoming a successful user for the following success period at the point when a contention period starts .",
    "in other words , a contention period selects the next successful user in a nondiscriminatory way .",
    "let @xmath69 be the @xmath0-by-@xmath0 matrix in the upper - left corner of @xmath70 .",
    "suppose that @xmath71 so that all the entries of @xmath70 marked with an asterisk are nonzero .",
    "then @xmath72 exists and is called the fundamental matrix for @xmath70 , when state 1 is absorbing ( i.e. , @xmath73 ) @xcite .",
    "the average number of slots in state @xmath74 starting from state 0 ( an idle slot ) is given by the @xmath75-entry of @xmath72 .",
    "hence , the average number of slots to hit state 1 ( a success slot ) for the first time starting from an idle slot is given by the first entry of @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is a column vector of length @xmath0 all of whose entries are 1 .",
    "hence , we obtain @xmath78_1 $ ] .",
    "note that @xmath68 is independent of @xmath47 .",

    "an alternative method to compute the channel utilization in a normal phase is to use a stationary distribution . since @xmath39 $ ] ,",
    "all states communicate with each other under the transition matrix @xmath70 for all @xmath80 .",
    "hence , the markov chain is irreducible , and there exists a unique stationary distribution @xmath81 , which satisfies @xmath82 let @xmath83 be the entry of @xmath81 corresponding to state @xmath62 , for @xmath84 .",
    "then @xmath83 gives the probability of state @xmath62 during a normal phase .",
    "in particular , the channel utilization in a normal phase is given by @xmath85 . since success and contention periods alternate from the beginning of a normal phase ,",
    "the stationary distribution yields the probabilities of states for any duration of a normal phase ( assuming that a normal phase lasts sufficiently longer than @xmath86 ) , not just the limiting probabilities as a normal phase lasts infinitely long . by manipulating",
    ", we can derive that @xmath87 , whose expression is given in .",
    "consider a slot @xmath8 in which a critical phase begins . since",
    "a critical user always transmits under a non - intrusive protocol , we consider a markov chain whose state space is @xmath88 , where state @xmath62 represents transmission outcomes in which exactly @xmath62 normal users transmit . the transition probability from state @xmath62 to state @xmath63 in a critical phase , @xmath89 , under a @xmath47-fair",

    "note that state 0 , which corresponds to a success by the critical user , is absorbing because once the critical user has a successful transmission , its transmissions in the following slots are not interrupted by other users with normal traffic .",
    "hence , the delay in a critical phase under a @xmath47-fair non - intrusive adaptive protocol is independent of the length of critical traffic and is measured by the average number of collisions that the critical user experiences before obtaining a successful transmission .",

    "an estimation procedure can be designed based on the approach of @xcite , whose details are left for future work .",
    "in this section , we discuss improvements on adaptive protocols by utilizing longer memory .",
    "the main idea is the inference of the traffic types of other users based on the patterns of observations .",
    "some patterns of observations reveal information about the types of other users , and users can adjust their transmission parameters to these patterns . as users maintain longer memory , there are more recognizable patterns , and exploiting them can achieve performance improvement .      returning to the discussion in section iv.b ,",
    "suppose that the transmission outcome of the last slot of a normal phase is represented by @xmath201 so that there is a successful user different from the critical user in the following critical phase .",
    "when users follow a @xmath47-fair non - intrusive adaptive protocol , the successful user transmits with probability @xmath57 in the first slot of the following critical phase .",
    "if the successful user transmits in the first slot , it collides with the critical user and then transmits with probability @xmath45 in the next slot .",
    "however , a collision can not follow a success when all users have normal traffic , and thus after a collision in the first slot of the critical phase , the successful user can infer the existence of a critical user . if the protocol is modified so that it requires normal users to wait after a pattern of @xmath202 followed by @xmath203 , then the average number of collisions experienced by a critical user after a transmission outcome represented by @xmath201 , @xmath204 , is reduced from @xmath205_1 $ ] to @xmath57 . when @xmath47 is small , a success period lasts long in a normal phase , leading to a large weight on @xmath201 , @xmath206 .",
    "thus , requiring normal users to wait after @xmath207 reduces the delay in a critical phase significantly . for example , with @xmath133 , @xmath134 , and @xmath208 , we have @xmath204 reduced from @xmath209 to @xmath210 , which decreases @xmath30 from @xmath168 to @xmath211 .      in the range of parameter values considered in section",
    "v , the delay in a critical phase is reasonably small , not exceeding 2 slots .",
    "however , the realized number of collisions that a critical user experiences can be arbitrarily large with positive probability .",
    "that is , the worst - case delay in a critical phase is unbounded .",
    "we can bound the maximum delay by modifying the protocol so that it requires normal users to wait after experiencing @xmath212 consecutive collisions .",
    "since non - colliding normal users wait after a collision , colliding normal users must have the same number of consecutive collisions in any slot .",
    "thus , normal users experiencing @xmath212 consecutive collisions back off simultaneously , yielding a room for a critical user , if there is one .",
    "therefore , a critical user can not experience more than @xmath212 collisions in a critical phase . when @xmath212 is chosen moderately large",
    ", @xmath212 consecutive collisions rarely occur in a normal phase , and thus the proposed modification has a negligible impact on the channel utilization in a normal phase , @xmath31 .",

    "we now consider a scenario where the system can have two critical users at the same time .",
    "we describe how the enhanced adaptive protocols can be extended to accommodate two critical users .",
    "depending on the timing of the two arrivals of critical traffic , we analyze three cases where two critical users coexist .",
    "first , suppose that a second critical event occurs to user @xmath217 in slot @xmath8 while a critical user @xmath2 is having successful transmissions in a critical phase . since the traffic type of a user is its local information , user @xmath217 does not know whether or not there is another critical user in slot @xmath8 .",
    "we propose a protocol with which a user transmits when its traffic type changes from normal to critical so that user @xmath217 transmits in slot @xmath8 . as in section vi.a",
    ", the transmission by user @xmath217 informs user @xmath2 that there exists another critical user in the system .",
    "if user @xmath2 had normal traffic , it would respond by waiting in slot @xmath218 according to the enhanced adaptive protocol so that user @xmath217 could capture the channel . however , since user @xmath2 has critical traffic , we propose a protocol that makes user @xmath2 respond by transmitting in slot @xmath218 to inform user @xmath217 of its critical traffic . then after the implicit `` information exchange '' in slots @xmath8 and @xmath219 , both user @xmath2 and user @xmath217 know that there are two critical users . from slot @xmath220 on , both users use the following decision rule @xmath221 with initialization @xmath222 to share the channel between them .",
    "@xmath223 in slot @xmath220 , they collide , and after a collision , they transmit with probability @xmath146 .",
    "once one of the two users succeeds , they alternate between @xmath224 and @xmath225 until one of the users completes the transmission of its critical traffic .",
    "after one of the users completes the transmission of its critical traffic , an idle slot occurs , and the situation becomes the same as the one where a critical event arrives following an idle slot .",
    "we can decrease the delay by requiring the user that completed the transmission of its critical traffic earlier than the other to wait in the slot following the idle slot .",
    "suppose now that two critical events occur simultaneously .",
    "two critical users , without knowing the existence of another critical user , transmit with probability 1 .",
    "after experiencing @xmath226 consecutive collisions , they realize that another critical user exists because the maximum number of consecutive collisions is bounded by @xmath212 when there is no or only one critical user given the enhancement discussed in section vi.b .",
    "then after @xmath226 consecutive collisions , the two critical users switch to the decision rule @xmath221 as above in order to share the channel between them .",
    "lastly , suppose that a second critical event occurs to user @xmath217 in slot @xmath8 while a critical user @xmath2 is experiencing collisions in a critical phase .",
    "user @xmath2 realizes the existence of another critical user after @xmath226 consecutive collisions , but at that point user @xmath217 has experienced less than @xmath226 consecutive collisions . after experiencing @xmath226 consecutive collisions , user @xmath2 switches to the decision rule @xmath221 while user @xmath217 still transmits with probability 1 . from that point , there are only two possible transmission outcomes .",
    "either user @xmath217 succeeds , or users @xmath2 and @xmath217 collide .",
    "if user @xmath217 experiences @xmath226 consecutive collisions before obtaining a success , it switches to @xmath221 and the two users can share the channel from that point on .",
    "suppose that user @xmath217 obtains a success before experiencing @xmath226 consecutive collisions .",
    "then it must be followed by a collision because user @xmath2 uses @xmath221 . recognizing that the pattern @xmath207 can not occur when all other users have normal traffic",
    ", user @xmath217 also learns the existence of another critical user and switches to @xmath221 .    to summarize , when two critical users coexist",
    ", they can infer the existence of another critical user within a finite number of slots , recognizing the patterns that are not possible otherwise .",
    "once the inference is made , they switch to another mode of operation that enables them to share the channel equally .",
