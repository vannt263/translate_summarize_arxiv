    "on the side of the nuclear target , coherent neutrino scattering has been proposed to probe the neutron density distribution @xcite as a complement to the use of pv electron scattering .",
    "we propose in the next section the study of the axial structure of odd nuclei for which elastic neutrino scattering offers a unique sensitivity .",
