    "( [ zetaj ] ) with an expansion of @xmath55 in @xmath64 is that it reduces @xmath68 , which depends on the choice of @xmath69 , to two more universal nonperturbative functions @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "thus , the number of unknowns decreases in global analyses involving different light mesons @xmath69 , and processes like @xmath72 and @xmath73  @xcite can be used to provide additional nonperturbative information .",
    "this is true both at tree level in @xmath4 and at one - loop in @xmath4 .",
    "there were two main critiques raised in  @xcite .",
    "first , it was argued that there is no point in working to all orders in @xmath74 since perturbation theory in this quantity is reasonably well behaved , and second that if one works to all orders in @xmath66 then the factorization theorem looses all predictive power beyond tree - level in @xmath4 .",
    "regarding the first point , it is always better to use less theoretical assumptions if predictions at the level of precision currently achievable actually do not rely on making this expansion .",
    "the perturbative expansion at the scale @xmath75 may in fact converge ( recent evidence has been given by the one - loop calculation in  @xcite and also relations between @xmath76 and @xmath77 decays  @xcite ) , however if a prediction is independent of this expansion then there is no need to rely on it .",
    "regarding the second point , it is true that beyond lo in @xmath4 the functional dependence of @xmath38 is required , instead of just the number @xmath78 .",

    "note that when @xmath19 corrections are included in eq .",
    "( [ apipiqcdf ] ) the functional form of the @xmath1 meson wave function @xmath17 is required .",
    "so in either case one has moments of one unknown function .",
    "we believe that the most important advantage of the @xmath79 expansion is the universality of the nonperturbative functions mentioned above , rather than the change in how @xmath4 corrections are included .",
    "the size of charm loop contributions to @xmath27 are important .",
    "certain charm loop contributions are from hard ( @xmath81 ) momenta and there is broad agreement  @xcite that these effects can be computed in perturbation theory . in eq .",

    "( [ apipi ] ) .    for the parametric scaling two useful limits are @xmath82 in  @xcite this corresponds to the limits @xmath83 with",
    "@xmath5 fixed and @xmath84 with @xmath85 fixed respectively , however we believe the description in eq .",
    "( [ limits ] ) makes aspects of the expansion more clear .",
    "for example , the charm quark power counting will not be identical to that for light quarks unless @xmath86 , which is not realized in nature .    in ref .",

    "] here @xmath8 is a place holder for a nonperturbative matrix element which is parametrically of this size . in charmonium @xmath88 and @xmath89  @xcite , so if we identify one of these scales with @xmath90 the @xmath8 suppression becomes either a @xmath91 or a @xmath92 suppression .",
    "we do not think that the case @xmath93 is physically relevant for charm quarks in qcd . in either case _ if we expand _ in @xmath94 these nonperturbative contributions do not enter the lo @xmath9 factorization theorem . however , in practice @xmath95 so these corrections are numerically large compared to @xmath96 power corrections , and can spoil the power expansion .    in refs .",
    "@xcite it was argued that the nrqcd @xmath7 region does not require special treatment due to quark - hadron duality , with smearing from the @xmath97 of the gluon which the charm annihilate into ( @xmath98 ) .",
    "using duality in this sense requires an inclusive hadronic final state , to make it possible for there to be a cancellation of infrared divergences between the virtual and real diagrams to all orders in @xmath19 . for exclusive decays like @xmath27 one",
    "must instead prove a factorization theorem to separate hard and infrared contributions . in these proofs",
    "one must consider the contributions from all possible momentum regions .",
    "the arguments in  @xcite assume that the size of the nonperturbative @xmath7 terms can be estimated based on regions of phase space in @xmath99 , taking limits based on a factorization formula analogous to ( [ apipiqcdf ] ) .",
    "to the best of our knowledge it has never been proven that the nrqcd @xmath7 contributions factor in this way .",
    "intuitively we expect that they will not .",
    "the gluons whose wavelength is @xmath100 do not decouple from the charm pair which are created and annihilated in the octet state .",
    "since the @xmath7 production and annihilation occur over a distance scale @xmath101 , the soft gluons radiated from energetic quarks produced from the annihilation may not cancel .",
    "this can lead to two types of wilson lines , @xmath102 $ ] and @xmath103 $ ] in the soft @xmath1-matrix element . in this case",
    "the amplitude will involve a new nonperturbative function which has a strong phase from the mechanism found in  @xcite , since the soft function carries information about the final state through @xmath104 and @xmath105 .    even in the absence of a proof of factorization for @xmath43",
    ", it should however still be possible to determine its parametric dependence on @xmath85 , @xmath8 , and @xmath14 using operators in effective field theories .",

    "the factor of @xmath8 gives the remaining suppression for the charm quarks to be non - perturbative in the nrqcd region .",

    "<S> we give a detailed description of the differences between the factorization and results derived from scet and qcdf for decays @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> this serves as a reply to the comment about our work _ </S>",
    "<S> @xmath0 : factorization , charming penguins , strong phases , and polarization _  @xcite made by the authors in  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we disagree with their criticisms .    in  @xcite we derived a factorization formula for exclusive </S>",
    "<S> @xmath1 decays to two light mesons using the soft collinear effective theory ( scet )  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recently , beneke , buchalla , neubert and sachrajda posted a comment about our work  @xcite , and compared it with their qcdf ( qcd factorization ) approach  @xcite . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we compare results and reply to their comments  @xcite .    for easy reference , we summarize a few points made in ref .  @xcite that disagree with ref .  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we found that : i ) a proper separation of scales @xmath2 in the factorization theorem are different in scet and qcdf , and can be regarded as a formal disagreement if desired ( @xmath3 ) ; ii ) only a subset of @xmath4 corrections are currently known , so results for these corrections are formally incomplete ; iii ) certain amplitudes are sensitive to the treatment of @xmath5 , with parametrically large @xmath6 contributions from @xmath7 in the nrqcd region where @xmath8 is the velocity power counting parameter ; iv ) current @xmath9 data analyzed at lo in scet supports values for the parameters @xmath10 , in disagreement with numerical inputs adopted in qcdf . </S>",
    "<S> we also emphasized that @xmath11 power corrections need to be of natural size to support model independent phenomenology and verify that the expansion converges , concepts which are sometimes relaxed in qcdf phenomenological analyses . if power corrections change the lo values of @xmath12 and @xmath13 substantially then </S>",
    "<S> this would indicate that the power expansion is not converging and a different expansion would be needed if model independent results are desired .    </S>",
    "<S> we take this opportunity to also comment on results from ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite where we found agreement with points made in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the original starting idea is the same , that factorization theorems for these decays should be derived by making a systematic expansion of qcd in @xmath14 , where the terms in this expansion are model independent and unique . </S>",
    "<S> earlier discussion of qcd based factorization methods for nonleptonic decays can be found in  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we agree on the scaling in @xmath11 for the lo amplitudes . </S>",
    "<S> there is agreement that input on non - perturbative functions can be obtained from @xmath15 form factors and lo light - cone meson distribution functions @xmath16 and @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> we also agree that at lo factorization occurs for amplitudes from light quark penguin loops , as well as tree , and color - suppressed diagrams . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the set of the one - loop hard corrections computed in ref .  @xcite determine the wilson coefficients of the @xmath18 operators  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> it is also worth emphasizing that the scope of our two works was different . in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite factorization theorems were proposed based on the study of the ir singularities of lowest order diagrams in perturbation theory . </S>",
    "<S> input parameters are taken from qcd sum rules . </S>",
    "<S> certain power suppressed contributions were also included , although the factorization was not extended to this order ; as a result , some of these corrections are ir divergent , and cutoffs were used for numerical estimates . in this way the authors of refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite were able to make predictions for many modes , which however depend on model dependent input . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , in  @xcite we used operators in scet to separate the long and short distance physics to all orders in @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> the decay amplitudes factor , with the long distance physics given by a few universal hadronic parameters . </S>",
    "<S> predictive power was shown to be retained even when @xmath20 effects are summed to all orders . </S>",
    "<S> we then used data to determine these lo hadronic parameters and obtained a prediction for the heavy to light form factor @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> the factorization theorem also gives a model independent determination of the weak phase @xmath22 ( or @xmath23 ) using @xmath24 as input , but not @xmath25  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we organize the remainder of this paper by the four points raised in  @xcite which we disagree with : 1 ) that the scet result  @xcite is formally equivalent to the qcdf result  @xcite in all respects , 2 ) that there is little benefit to avoiding the perturbative expansion at the scale @xmath26 , 3 ) that operators containing a charm quark pair are perturbatively calculable , with corrections suppressed by @xmath11 regardless of how the scale @xmath5 is treated , and 4 ) that our phenomenological analysis of recent @xmath27 data , which disfavors certain qcdf input parameters , is flawed because it omits `` known '' perturbative and power suppressed contributions . </S>",
    "<S> a section is devoted to each of these topics . </S>"
