    "# 1[*todo : # 1 ] *    studies of cosmic star formation history over the past decade have been an integral part of the development of our knowledge of galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "these studies have found that star formation rates rise significantly from z = 0 to z = 1 , peak between 1 @xmath7 z @xmath7 2 , and flatten or decline ( depending on the role of dust obscuration on ultraviolet measures ) beyond z = 2 @xcite .",
    "star formation rates ( sfr ) are usually determined by measuring the luminosity densities of galaxies , either from emission lines or from the continuum spectrum of a wavelength range .",
    "highly luminous stars live very short lifetimes , and can be used as a proxy for instantaneous star formation rates in galaxies .",
    "these stars easily ionize the gases surrounding them , and the strength of the recombination lines of various elements gives the number of ionizing photons , which can be converted into star formation rates @xcite .",
    "they also give rise to broad - band ultraviolet emission which can also be used as a measure of star - formation rate accessible at high - redshift @xcite , but this should be used with caution as the ultraviolet is much more subject to dust extinction than the optical re - combination lines and high - redshift sfrs can be seriously underestimated @xcite .    in the intermediate redshift @xmath8 regime",
    "the most commonly studied emission lines for measuring the cosmological sfr are h@xmath6 @xcite , and the 3727oii line @xcite .",
    "h@xmath6 , when corrected for extinction is directly proportional to the number of ionizing photons from massive stars @xcite .",
    "since such stars are short - lived ( @xmath9 20 myr ) their abundance traces the instantaneous sfr .",
    "h@xmath5 can also be used this way but the extinction and stellar absorption corrections are larger .",
    "the [ oii ] emission line ( 3727 ) has a more complex dependence on metallicity @xcite and is less straight - forward to use as a sfr tracer .",
    "most studies use broad band filters to select a magnitude and/or color - limited samples which gives rise to selection effect issues when computing the total sfr .",
    "for example populations of strong - lined high equivalent width objects may contribute significantly to the sfr while having weak continuum emission and hence lying below typical broad - band magnitude limits .",
    "an alternative approach is to use a narrow - band filter to directly select emission line objects down to an emission line flux limit .",
    "so far as the line luminosity is in proportion to the sfr then this is equivalent to a sfr - selected sample and if the line s redshifted wavelength matches that of the narrow filter s one obtains a higher signal : noise on lower luminosity objects in a given integration time . also , this technique produces a volume - limited sample , since the narrow observed bands correspond to small windows in redshift space with approximately constant luminosity limits .",
    "previous narrow - band filter surveys have almost universally relied on using special interference filters .",
    "some of the deepest , most recent work includes : @xcite who surveyed 684 arcmin@xmath10 to a flux limit of about 5 @xmath11 10@xmath12 erg s@xmath4 @xmath3 , finding 16 objects at @xmath13 and @xcite surveyed 100 arcmin@xmath10 in the near - infrared to a flux limit of 5 - 12 @xmath11 10@xmath14 erg s@xmath4 @xmath3 , finding 6 objects at @xmath15 .",
    "a recent target of these searches has been high-@xmath16 lyman-@xmath6 emission : @xcite surveyed 94 arcmin@xmath17 in a deep keck exposure reaching fluxes of @xmath1810@xmath14 erg s@xmath4 @xmath3 ; @xcite extending earlier work @xcite surveyed 0.25 deg@xmath17 to a depth of @xmath1910@xmath14 erg s@xmath4 @xmath3 and @xcite reached the same flux limit over 0.72 deg@xmath17 ; however spectroscopic follow - up of these surveys has been limited to @xmath20 objects ( winnowed by either broad - band color and/or high - equivalent width selection ) .    a novel approach to selecting line emitters at high - redshift is to use a _ tunable _ filter , of which the most practical technology to realise this is based on the fabry - perot etalon @xcite .",
    "tunable filters have unique advantages starting with the fact that a contiguous scan can be made in wavelength / redshift space allowing a line to be unambiguously identified via a peak in flux without reference to any broad - band image",
    ". they also offer much higher resolution ( @xmath21 ) than interference filters ( @xmath22 ) which better match the typical line widths of galaxies with consequent signal : noise gains .",
    "the scan through the line also permits any continuum to be precisely removed in the analysis allowing accurate integration through the line profile to measure the flux .",
    "this flux can also be integrated over the entire galaxy ( essentially 3d aperture photometry ) meaning total line fluxes can easily be measured without the dubious aperture corrections required for narrow slit spectra .",
    "there have been few surveys using this technique .",
    "@xcite using the taurus tunable filter on the anglo - australian telescope surveyed 972 arcmin@xmath10 to a flux limit of 510 @xmath11 10@xmath14 erg s@xmath4 @xmath3 , finding 696 objects in six bands from @xmath23 to @xmath24 .",
    "@xcite surveyed 400 arcmin@xmath10 to a flux limit of 3 @xmath11 10@xmath14 erg s@xmath4 @xmath3 , finding 438 objects at @xmath25 .",
    "neither survey has extensive spectroscopic follow - up to give unambiguous identification .",
    "@xcite argued based on model luminosity functions that at their bright flux limits h@xmath6 emitters would dominate the counts ; there was a small amount of overlap ( 18 of the brighter objects ) with the autofib redshift survey @xcite which backed up their conclusion .",
    "@xcite had additional observations in a set of 15 medium and broad band filters which allowed the redshifts to be constrained using fits to the spectral energy distributions .",
    "spectroscopic followup of @xmath26 objects with @xmath27 showed this was reliable for @xmath28 80% of galaxies ; other emission line objects without continuum detections amount to @xmath29 7% of this sample ( hippelein 2004 , private communication ) .    in this work",
    "we report on a small area ( 20 arcmin@xmath17 ) but extremely deep ( 1.7  2.4 @xmath11 10@xmath14 erg s@xmath4 @xmath3 ) survey carried out with the taurus tunable filter on the william herschel telescope in the hubble deep field north ( hdf - n ) @xcite .",
    "this field has the advantage of extensive spectroscopy @xcite ; so while the resulting sample is small it is unique in being almost completely spectroscopically identified .",
    "the goal was to explore the possibility that additional star formation , which could contribute strongly to the cosmological sfr density , could be occurring in galaxies with strong emission lines but little or no continuum emission .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows : in section 2 we review the details of the observation , data reduction , object identification and catalog making . in section 3",
    "we discuss our process for calculating galaxies sfrs and correcting for extinction . in section 4",
    "we describe the methodology we followed for determining the luminosity density based on the narrow band line fluxes we observed , and calculate the corresponding star formation rates . in section 5",
    "we present a cosmic star formation history , calculated from our sample to z=1 , and discuss the implications . throughout this paper",
    "we use a cosmology : h@xmath30 = 70 km sec@xmath4 mpc@xmath4 , @xmath31=0.3 , and @xmath32 = 0.7 motivated by @xcite .",
    "the observations were carried out on 1997 march 11 - 14 at the 4.2 m william herschel telescope ( wht ) in the canary islands using the taurus tunable filter @xcite on loan from the anglo - australian observatory .",
    "the taurus2 instrument @xcite on the wht was identical to the one on the anglo - australian telescope .",
    "operating at @xmath33 the instrument delivered a pixel scale of 0.29 arcsecs with the 1024@xmath111024 tektronix ccd .",
    "conditions were photometric for most of the run with seeing of @xmath34arcsec .",
    "the field centre was ra 12@xmath35 36@xmath36 46.8@xmath37 dec + 62@xmath38 14@xmath39 46@xmath40 ( j2000 ) and the wht images including the whole of the hubble deep field north together with its surrounding environs . by choosing a ttf etalon gap and broad - band blocking filter",
    "one generates a slice in wavelength ( which we call a ` channel ' ) to observe .",
    "we scanned the etalon in 3 contiguous wavelength regions , each a subset of the wavelength range defined by 3 blocking filters : i1 ( 7070  center/260  wide ) , i5 ( 8140/330 ) and i8 ( 9090/400 ) .",
    "these are chosen to lie in the darkest regions of the night sky spectrum between 7000  and 10000 .",
    "the wavelength step for the scan was chosen to match , approximately , the full - width half - max of the etalon resolution . for etalon lorentzian profiles this provides adequate sampling .",
    "we scanned ( i.e. changing the etalon gap to produce different filter wavelengths ) through 10 channels in the i1 and i8 filters and through 5 channels in the i5 filter .",
    "the full wavelength scanning parameters together with the exposure times per position are given in table  [ tab : filters ] .",
    "longer exposure times were used in the redder filters , which correspond to higher redshifts for a given line , to partially counteract cosmological dimming , the deepest scans were in the i8 filter where we exposed for 1.5 hours in each channel .",
    "the reduction and analysis of tunable filter images is discussed in detail in @xcite .",
    "the goal in our case was to produce flux calibrated , background - subtracted data _ cubes _",
    "( i.e. ra , dec , @xmath41 ) .",
    "the raw ccd frames we de - biased and flat - fielded using dome flats .",
    "frames taken at the same wavelength were stacked with a cosmic - ray rejection filter .",
    "the overall wavelength calibration of the etalon gap was determined by taking a fast scan of an argon arc lamp using just the central part of the ccd windowed . in the full frame data",
    "images the jacquinot spot is approximately centered on the ccd ; the etalon phase shifts as one goes off - axis causing the tuned wavelength for a given channel to vary bluewards up to an additional 10 .",
    "this effect also gives rise to a broad ring - shaped structures in the ccd background ; the rings correspond to the position of night - sky lines in the blocking filter band - pass .",
    "this was removed by fitting for the centre of the ring pattern and then subtracting the median count in annular bins . the remaining background after this",
    "step still has structure due to ccd fringing ; this is more random but had structure on @xmath4230 pixel scales .",
    "we attempted to remove this by subtracting a local median , in a matching box , from each pixel .",
    "this procedure worked , essentially perfectly , in the i1 and i5 filters but was imperfect in the i8 filter due to the much greater fringing at 9100 .",
    "this gives rise extra non - poisson noise which must be considered carefully when doing object detection ( see section  [ sec : det ] ) .",
    "the overall flux calibration was established by taking a fast windowed scan of a spectroscopic standard star and a bright reference star in the hdf - n field during photometric conditions .",
    "this was then referenced to the counts of the same reference star in the final data cube ( which included some slightly non - photometric data ) in order to establish the final calibration of counts into flux versus wavelength .",
    "our goal was to construct a true three - dimensional catalog so we did not wish to require that an object have detectable flux in _ every _ wavelength channel . rather if an object was detected in _",
    "one channel _ we wanted to have reliable flux limits in all other channels based on the aperture defined by the detection channel . to achieve this we ran the sextractor object detection software @xcite on each 2d channel _ separately _ using a threshold of at least 5 pixels @xmath43 1.2 @xmath44 above the background using pre - smoothing with a gaussian kernel matched to the seeing .",
    "the noise @xmath44 was set by the ccd readnoise and gain parameters .",
    "certain parts of the 2d images ( @xmath45 ) had residual contamination features due to optical ghosts and bad columns , these were masked off by a binary sextractor mask to avoid object detection in these areas .",
    "the effective area searched for objects was then 20.35 arcmin@xmath17 .    from each individual channel catalog objects",
    "were photometered in all other channels using the same sextractor aperture parameters ( i.e. two - image mode for all other channels as the second image ) .",
    "this process was then repeated for each channel .",
    "what we end up with is a large set of catalogs , one for each channel , containing the _ spectra _",
    "( i.e. aperture flux versus channel ) of each object based on it s detection in each channel .",
    "the next step was to merge these catalogs to remove duplicates where bright objects were detected in many channels .",
    "to detect duplicates a centroid proximity test of @xmath46 pixels was used . to remove duplicates we kept only the spectrum based on the channel with the strongest detection .",
    "some additional cosmic - ray filtering was performed at this step ; essentially removing any source too sharp to be a real object .",
    "the result of the merging procedure was a master catalog of all possible objects ( 351 total ) in all possible channels with associated spectra and noise vectors .",
    "this 3d approach is very similar to that of @xcite but differs from @xcite who used the sum of the channel images for object detection . for objects which only appear as a line in one channel the latter approach is less sensitive .",
    "the final step is to search for emission lines in the final spectra .",
    "choosing the right signal : noise cut is critical to avoid contamination by spurious objects .",
    "one test we performed was to compare the actual variance in the spectra with that calculated based on ccd gain and readnoise .",
    "( the majority of objects will not have a spectral feature in the observed wavelength range as it is so short and so the variance is dominated by noise ) .",
    "we found these agreed well in the i1 and i5 channels but fell short by a factor of 2 in the i8 channel .",
    "this was because i8 had additional channel - to - channel fluctuations due to significant residual fringing . to compensate for this we forced a match by doubling the calculated noise in the i8 channel .",
    "we estimate the final 1-@xmath44 noise in each channel to be @xmath47 ergs @xmath3 s@xmath4 for i1 , i5 and i8 respectively .    for emission line detection we smoothed the spectra with a 3 pixel kernel ( values @xmath48)$ ] in order to approximately match the lorentz profile of unresolved lines ) .",
    "the continuum , if present , was defined by the median flux value in each filter .",
    "a line was ` detected ' if any pixel had flux @xmath49 above the continuum , this threshold being equivalent to 3@xmath44 in the unsmoothed data .",
    "this gave a ` 3@xmath44 ' emission line catalog of 41 ` objects ' .",
    "inspection of the images showed that many of these objects looked more like artifacts than real objects ; the effect of the fringing being to impart a non - gaussian characteristic to the noise.we decided to calibrate the  believability threshold  empirically by searching for emission line in 1000 randomized sky positions ( constrained to be distant from all known objects in the field ) .",
    "this let us estimate how often by pure chance , given the skew noise distribution in our images , we would incorrectly detect an emission line when photometering our data .",
    "spectra were extracted in 3 arcsec diameter apertures and the same detection algorithm applied to measure the false - positive rate . at 3@xmath44",
    "the contamination due to non - gaussian artifacts is severe : in our master catalog we calculated a rate of 40 false positives for every 351 random positions in our synthetic catalog . since the actual catalog of 351 objects had 41 emission line detections this led us to conclude that at this @xmath50 threshold we are overwhelmingly dominated by false objects . using these simulations as a guide we raised the threshold to make a ` 5@xmath44 ' catalog of 8 objects",
    " the random catalog showed in this we expect on average only 0.7 objects to be false .",
    "this rapid drop - off in the number of ` objects ' in the random catalog when moving from 3@xmath44 to 5@xmath44 ( only a factor of 1.66 in flux ) is consistent with the objects in the former catalog being noise artefacts and not serendipitous galaxies .",
    "visual inspection confirmed that these 8 objects were very likely genuine galaxy images .",
    "we show images and spectra of all 8 objects in figure  [ fig : data ] and tabulate them in table  [ tab : objects ] .",
    "redshifts were confirmed by cross - matching the sky - coordinates with published hdf spectroscopy from @xcite . in 7 out of the 8 cases",
    "there was a clear , positive , unique identification where a known emission line galaxy at the correct ra , dec had the correct redshift to put a strong line in the right filter .",
    "( the probability of the last happening by chance is of order 1% ) . out of these 7 objects",
    "one is in the hdf itself ( # 8 ) and the other 6 are in the flanking fields .",
    "the 8th object is also in the flanking fields and is blended with a neighboring object in ground - based images of @xcite .",
    "its identification remains a mystery but we note the object is detected in the @xmath51-band so it is unlikely to be @xmath52 ly@xmath6 .",
    "we further note the peak flux is at the red end of the i8 scan so it could correspond to a continuum break instead of an emission line .",
    "the final redshifts and line identifications are given in table  [ tab : objects ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : data ] shows both the data cube images of each object in the vicinity of the line and resulting channel spectra .",
    "the emission lines are clearly evident in both .",
    "continuum was also significantly detected in these objects and the flux levels agree with the published @xmath53-band hdf - n photometry of the same objects .",
    "the magnitude range of the objects is @xmath54 .",
    "since the number of objects was small and the magnitudes were relatively bright our main result  no surprises  is presaged here .",
    "however the line flux limits reached are quite faint ( see above and table  [ tab : sfr ] ) : in these redshift windows probed this sample represents all the objects down to a small fraction of the schechter luminosity @xmath55 .",

    "the resulting sfr densities are given in table  [ tab : sfr ] and in figure  [ fig : sfrd ] are compared with others in the literature from both broad - band uv estimates and narrow line estimates ( for the latter we go back to the original data and consistently use our conversions / extinctions for line luminosity densities to sfr densities ) . in general our results fall within the scatter of previous measurements given the large error bars from the small number statistics of our sample .",
    "our h@xmath6 , h@xmath5 points agree with the range of balmer line estimates at @xmath109 from the literature , at @xmath110 our [ oii ] estimate is a little low ( even given the large one object error bars ) especially compared to other [ oii ] estimates .",
    "it is possible that our measure is underestimated due to an incorrect choice of [ oii]@xmath68h@xmath6 ratio , for example if we adopt the ` unbiassed ' [ oii]@xmath68sfr conversion of @xcite we can raise our [ oii ] point by 0.35 dex .",
    "it is also possible that our assumed extinction value is incorrect .",
    "the effect of increasing the extinction , for example to @xmath111 mags would be greatest on our @xmath112 sfr density raising the estimate by 0.5 dex while the other estimates would be raised by 0.3 dex .",
    "this would make [ oii ] agree better but then the h@xmath5 point would be highly discrepant .",
    "similarly the effect of assuming zero extinction would be to lower the points by the same amounts .",
    "clearly then our sfr density measurements would still be inconsistent : [ oii ] would be highly discrepant .",
    "internal consistency gives us good reason to think our choices of [ oii]@xmath68h@xmath6 line ratio and extinction are reasonable , though the allowed range is large .",
    "the formal error bars also do not include the effect of large scale structure which are significant .",
    "our small volume is equivalent to a sphere of radis 56 mpc which is @xmath28 the local blue galaxy correlation length .",
    "( @xcite finds @xmath1135.9 mpc for star - forming galaxies . ) for the volumes ( @xmath9 5001000 mpc@xmath0 ) and number densities ( 0.0020.02 mpc@xmath97 ) considered here we expect fluctuations of 100130% relative to the mean using the results of @xcite .",
    "the deviations of the points from the line in figure  [ fig : sfrd ] are of this order and so large scale structure would represent an equally reasonable explanation of our scatter .",
    "this work demonstrates we can select galaxies purely by line emission in a three - dimensional survey , producing a pure narrow - band sample limited by line luminosity to constrain the cosmological sfr .",
    "one can see from table 3 that our observable luminosity limit for @xmath76 is almost two orders of magnitude lower than @xmath55 , indicating a small completeness correction .",
    "the luminosity densities calculated from this data are therefore very complete and provide a strong bound on the cosmological total .",
    "our study also finds no evidence for any new population of low - luminosity objects with strong emission lines which could have caused previous estimates of the sfr density to be seriously underestimated . searching for such unexpected populations",
    "was a primary goal of our observations , we are reporting a null result for this search .",
    "rather we find a sfr density history consistent ( albeit with large errors from small number / volume statistics ) with earlier estimates from broad - band selected samples .",
    "more specifically our measured sfr density agrees with the previous emission line determinations ( both broad - band and narrow - band selected ) but are higher than previous ultraviolet determinations which is in accord with earlier findings .",
    "our low sub-@xmath55 line luminosity limits corresponds to seeing @xmath28 8090% of the integrated sfr density at @xmath114 ; even at @xmath1 our flux limit corresponds to @xmath28 4060% of the total star - forming light .",
    "this indicates that previous completeness estimates to broad - band surveys were correct and that we now have a reasonable census of the total star - formation rate density in the universe out to @xmath1 .",
    "the success of narrow - band tunable filter surveys ( both this work and those of @xcite and @xcite ) augurs well for the next generation of tunable filter 3d instrumentation .",
    "galaxies can be located in data cubes purely from their line emission _ flux _",
    "( i.e. not equivalent width ) and recovered aperture - extracted spectra of general objects agree well with those taken using classical dispersive spectrographs . for line emitting objects",
    "modest exposures on 4 m telescopes allow one to survey substantially below @xmath55 in volume - limited samples at high redshift .",
    "our survey suffers from a limited volume surveyed using an instrument with a 5 arcmin fov ; future wider field instrumentation should allow much bigger surveys . in the near - future",
    "we also expect such instrumentation techniques to be extended beyond the ccd cutoff to the near - ir and especially the @xmath115-band . here",
    "the gain by observing in narrow wavelength slices is even greater than in the optical because the airglow lines are even stronger",
    ". here tunable filter techniques @xcite on 8 m class telescopes would allow astronomers to find ly-@xmath6 emitters at @xmath116 for even very modest ly-@xmath6 @xmath68 sfr assumptions and thus allow us to experimentally probe the very first galaxies and the epoch of re - ionization .",
