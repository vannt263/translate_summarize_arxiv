    "financial market analysis has become one of the most significative examples about application of concepts associated with physics to systems that are usually studied by other sciences  @xcite . in this sense ,",
    "ideas like _ scale invariance _ and _ cooperative phenomena _ have also found significance in systems that are not described neither by some hamiltonian nor some other kind of equation usually associated with physics ( _ e.g. _ , a master equation ) .",
    "although plenty of work has been made on the analysis and mimicry of price fluctuations , less attention has been paid to an important observable intimately related to changes in price , the _ traded volume _ , @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "in fact , traded volume has been coupled to price fluctuations both on an empirical or analytical way for some time  @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , a consistent analysis of intrinsic statistical properties of traded volume appears to be first presented in reference  @xcite .",
    "thereafter , it has been enlarged or revisited by different authors  @xcite . in this article",
    ", we apply a generalisation of the traditional linear self - correlation function in order to study how small , large , and about average ( frequent ) values of @xmath0 relate between them in time .",
    "furthermore , we analyse non - linear dependence using a generalised measure based on kulback - leibler mutual information . our data set is made up of 1 minute traded volume time series , running from the @xmath6 july 2004 to the @xmath7 december 2004 , for the @xmath1 equities that make the dow jones industrial average index .",
    "aiming to avoid the well - known intraday profile , traded volume time series were previously treated according to a standard procedure ( see _ e.g. _",
    "the ( normalised ) correlation function , generally , @xmath8represents a useful analytical form to evaluate how much two random variables depend , linearly , on each other . leaving out spatial dependence , when @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the same observable , eq .  ( [ selfcor ] ) represents the straightforwardest way to appraise memory in the evolution of @xmath9 . in any case",
    ", it does not give us any information about the role of magnitudes .",
    "inspired by multi - fractal analysis  @xcite , a simple way to quantify this type of correlation can be defined by introducing a _ generalised self - correlation function _ , @xmath11 , where @xmath12 , @xmath13 ( with @xmath14 @xmath15 ) , and @xmath16   is assumed to be a stationary time series .",

    "let us assume @xmath18 .",
    "for values of @xmath2 greater than @xmath19 , small values of @xmath9 become even smaller and their weight in the value of @xmath20 , due to @xmath21 , approaches negligibility ( _ e.g. _ , when @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 ) . otherwise ,",
    "when @xmath2 is negative , we highlight values around zero ( _ e.g. _ , when @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 ) . in the end , after summing over all pairs @xmath28 , we verify that the main contribution for @xmath29 comes from large values of @xmath30 when @xmath31 and from small values of @xmath30 when @xmath32 . accordingly , for @xmath33 , we estimate how values of the same order of magnitude are related in time , when @xmath34 we analyse the relation between values with different magnitudes .    in fig .",

    "our choice is justified by the fact they are both able to evaluate the influence of small and large values of @xmath0 , and to preserve a reliable statistics .    from the analysis of figures in table  [ tabela ]",
    ", we observe that small values , @xmath39 , are always anti - correlated with both frequent ( @xmath40 ) , and large ( @xmath41 ) values of traded volume .",
    "we verify that there is temporal symmetry , which can be checked if we change @xmath42 . when @xmath2(@xmath3 ) equal @xmath43 , the second scale of relaxation is consistently much larger than the observed when both exponents are positive .",
    "in addition , the values for coefficients @xmath44 and @xmath45 ( in modulus ) are smaller when at least one of the exponents is @xmath37 .",
    "this indicates that , besides presenting a negative influence over frequent and large values of @xmath0 , such an influence is restrictable . on the other side ,",
    "we have observed a very fast first decay of the correlation function for @xmath46 and @xmath47 followed by a slower decay , though faster when compared with @xmath48 .",

    ", we have further analysed this data by performing this calculation on the same lines as in section selfcor , _",
    "i.e. _ , we have defined our random variables by modifying the ( normalised detrended ) traded volume @xmath0 through exponents @xmath2 and @xmath3 , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "then , we have computed @xmath79 with the same exponents as in the section  [ correlation ] .",
    "our procedure can be summarised as follows : we have first derived the probability distributions for each component time series @xmath87 and its lagged counterpart with lag @xmath88 . to construct the pdfs ,",
    "we have set the bin size ( or , in physics terms , the coarse - graining ) to be @xmath89 .",
    "we then have calculated @xmath90 as a function of the index @xmath71 . from this , we have extracted an optimal index @xmath91 for each component @xmath87 .",

    "i.e. _ @xmath92  .    in fig .",
    "[ all ] we present our results for different values of @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "firstly we plot , for comparison purposes , the unmodified case @xmath93 ( panel @xmath44 ) .",
    "there is a clear logarithmic dependence of @xmath94 as a function of the lag @xmath88 . in the same panel",
    "we plot our results for @xmath95 , and its symmetric case @xmath96 .",
    "we obtain again a logarithmic behaviour , but both additive and multiplicative fitting parameters change .",
    "the rate of change is higher indicating that this particular choice of @xmath2 and @xmath3 accelerates the loss of dependence in time . for @xmath96 ,",
    "the multiplicative parameter is very close to @xmath95 case ( see caption ) , reflecting the same kind of symmetry observed in the section  correlation . in panel",
    "@xmath97 we present results where @xmath98 or @xmath99 .",
    "our results show that , in this case , @xmath81 diminishes as a function of the lag , but the rate of change is not as high as in the @xmath100 case ( see caption ) . note that this result occurs for the same exponents where anti - correlated behaviour is found ( section  [ correlation ] ) suggesting that anti - correlation might imply on negative slope in the logarithmic behaviour .",
    "this possibility will be verified in future work , namely on the analysis of the dependence between volatility and traded volume  @xcite .",
    "to further analyse the meaning of these results , we have performed the same calculations on a shuffled version of the same time series , _",
    "i.e. _ applying a random reordering ( in time ) on each component time series .",
    "we show our results in fig .",
    "[ all ] , panels @xmath45 and @xmath101 , where we have use the same exponents as in panels @xmath44 and @xmath97 respectively .",
    "this shuffling procedure destroys causality and in every case @xmath81 looses its dependence with @xmath102 . in all cases , the curves obtained from the unshuffled data evolve towards the shuffled ones , probably reaching them for high values of @xmath102 .",
    "thus , one can consider that @xmath81 obtained from the shuffled time series act as saturation values of the unshuffled case , when all dependence is lost .",
    "to conclude , we have applied a generalised form of correlation function , @xmath103 , in order to evaluate how values having different magnitudes influence each other .",
    "the results obtained point out that small values of traded volume are consistently anti - correlated with frequent and large values . moreover , frequent and large values are positively correlated .",
    "these results are in accordance with the strong asymmetry of the multi - fractal spectrum , which has supported our dynamical scenario for the observable  @xcite .",
    "we also have investigated the effect of modifying our data through @xmath2 and @xmath3 on the kullback - leibler generalised mutual information , and its associated optimal index @xmath81 .",
    "our results show that there is a logarithmic dependence of @xmath81 with lag in the positive exponents case ( @xmath104 ) , with different fitting parameters depending on these exponents . in the case of negative @xmath2 or @xmath3 ,",
    "we have observed that @xmath81 diminishes with lag .",
