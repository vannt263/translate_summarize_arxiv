    "the synthetic stellar spectrum of a galaxy is a well established theoretical tool for investigating the properties of the integrated light from distant galaxies where individual stars can not be resolved .",
    "since the late 60 s several groups have developed different grids of synthetic stellar population models using a variety of stellar interior tracks and observed or theoretical stellar spectra ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the idea is very simple : stars are born with a given initial mass function ( imf ) and they evolve in time according to stellar evolution . at any time",
    "one can compute the integrated spectrum by summing up the individual spectra of the stars in the population at that instant .",
    "two major approaches have been used to compute the integrated light of a stellar population : the fuel consumption theorem @xcite and the isochrone technique , first developed by @xcite and later used by @xcite .",
    "the fuel consumption theorem simply uses the fact that the contribution of stars in any post main  sequence evolutionary stage is proportional to the amount of nuclear fuel they burn at that stage , and approximates the post main  sequence evolution of the stars in the integrated population by the stellar track of the most massive star alive at the main sequence turn  off ( msto ) .",
    "in contrast , the isochrone technique uses a continuous distribution of stellar masses , and hence tracks , to compute the locus in luminosity and @xmath2 at a given time for any mass . from this",
    ", a smooth isochrone can be computed .",
    "the fuel consumption theorem remains an elegant method of studying the fastest stages in the evolution of any population . on the other hand , with the new generation of fast computers ,",
    "the isochrone technique is clearly the most accurate and precise method of computing the integrated light of any stellar population .",
    "regardless of the computational technique used to calculate the integrated spectrum of a stellar population , the most important ingredient remains the stellar input : both stellar interior and stellar atmospheric models .",
    "disagreement over stellar interior models ( convection , mass loss , opacities ) , the modelling of post main sequence evolutionary stages and the modelling of stellar atmospheres ( opacities , nlte effects , bolometric correction , mass loss , etc . ) , combine to make the derived age of even a simple ( i.e. , no dust , no agn contamination ) stellar population vary by about 10% ( for a fixed mass and metallicity ) , depending on which of the currently available synthetic stellar population codes ( e.g. @xcite ) is used to interpret the data ( see section 4 ) .",
    "a similar problem occurs when trying to date globular clusters in the galaxy , the age of which is currently uncertain by about 10% @xcite .",
    "we have been motivated to attempt to improve this situation by the fact that the new generation of large 8 - 10 m telescopes can now deliver spectra of galaxies at @xmath3 of sufficient quality to merit accurate age dating .",
    "the accurate determination of the ages of high - redshift galaxies can yield important constraints not only on models of galaxy formation , but also on the age of the universe . in particular , in a series of papers @xcite",
    "we have addressed the issue of determining the ages of the reddest known elliptical galaxies at @xmath4 . to aid in the interpretation of our data and others , we have developed a set of simple synthetic stellar population models ( ssp ) that overcomes some of the problems described above .",
    "most of the disagreement between the existing synthetic stellar evolution codes stems from the difficulty of modelling accurately the post main - sequence evolution , both because the physics involved in these stages is not completely known ( opacities , convection , nuclear rates ) and because mass loss strongly controls the final fate of the evolution of the star in these phases .",
    "ideally , one would like to have a robust set of stellar models that are computed self - consistently ( i.e. interior , photosphere and chromosphere computed at the same time ) and that include the effects of mass loss and dust grain formation .",
    "however this is not yet possible , and in any case it is important to realise that mass loss _ can not _ be incorporated as a _ fixed quantity _ for all stars in the population since it varies from star to star .    in the new synthetic stellar population models presented here we have endeavoured to improve the ability of the modelling to accurately reproduce the post - main sequence evolution of real stellar populations by incorporating an algorithm which has been previously applied with success to a number of other stellar evolution problems ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this algorithm accurately simulates the evolution of all post main - sequence evolution stages , and includes a proper modelling of the hb along with an accurate account of the formation of carbon stars on the agb .",
    "furthermore , the mixing length parameter and the mass loss are properly calibrated using the position of the rgb and the morphology of the hb in real star clusters , respectively .",
    "the other main new feature of our spectral synthesis models is the incorporation of new stellar evolutionary tracks , with sufficient resolution in mass to sample rapid stages of stellar evolution . as a result of these improvements ( which we describe in detail in this paper ) , unlike several existing population codes , our models yield consistent ages when used to date a coeval population from a wide range of spectral features and colour indexes .",
    "our new ssp code has been applied successfully to a variety of different populations .",
    "it has been used to determine the ages of high redshift galaxies @xcite , the ages of low surface brightness galaxies @xcite , the role of star formation and the tully - fisher law @xcite and the age of the galactic disc @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to present the new library of synthetic stellar population spectra and discuss in more detail the physics and assumptions in our ssp modelling procedure .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : in  2 we present the new set of stellar interior tracks and discuss their accuracy when confronted with individual stellar observations .",
    "the synthesis models are presented in  3 .",
    "the degeneracies in the age - metallicity plane are discussed in  4 while systematic errors are considered in  5 .",

    "our conclusions are presented in  8 .",
    "an appendix provides fitting formulas for computing broad band colors of ssps .",
    "we have computed a new interior stellar library with the stellar evolution code jmstar developed by one of us ( jm ) from the code of @xcite .        in this code , the whole star is evolved by a relaxation method without use of separate envelope calculations .",
    "some of the advantages of this approach are that ( 1 ) gravothermal energy generation terms are automatically included for the stellar envelope , ( 2 ) mass loss occurs at the stellar surface rather than an interior point of the star , and ( 3 ) the occurrence of convective dredge - up of elements produced by nucleosynthesis in the interior to the photosphere is clearly identifiable .",
    "the code uses an adaptive mesh technique similar to that of @xcite .",
    "advection terms are approximated by second - order upwind finite differences .",
    "convective energy transport is modeled by using the mixing - length theory described by @xcite .",
    "composition equations for h , @xmath5he , @xmath6he , @xmath7c , @xmath8n , @xmath9o , and @xmath10 mg are solved simultaneously with the structure equations .",
    "composition changes due to convective mixing are modeled in the same way as @xcite by adding diffusion terms to the composition equations .",
    "however , the prescription for the diffusion coefficient differs from that of @xcite .",
    "the diffusion coefficient is consistent with mixing - length theory @xcite , @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the convective velocity , @xmath13 is the mixing length , and @xmath14 is a dimensionless convective mixing efficiency parameter .",
    "opal radiative opacities @xcite are used for temperatures ( in kelvins ) above @xmath15 . for temperature below @xmath16 ,",

    "electron degeneracy is included by the method of @xcite .",
    "coulomb and quantum corrections to the equation of state follow the prescription of @xcite , with the coulomb free energy updated to use the results of @xcite . pressure ionization is included in a thermodynamically consistent manner by use of a hard - sphere free - energy term .    mass loss is included by using a scaled @xcite mass - loss law ,    @xmath18    for cool stars ( t@xmath19 k ) and an approximation to the theoretical result of @xcite ,    @xmath20    for hot stars ( @xmath21 k ) . for agb stars we also include additional mass loss at a rate obtained by fitting the observed mass loss rates for mira variables @xcite .    @xmath22    the surface boundary condition is treated as follows .",
    "we assume that the atmosphere is plane - parallel and thin .",
    "a small value of optical depth ( typically @xmath23 ) is assigned to the center of the outermost zone of the stellar model .",

    "the dashed line is the red giant branch while the solid line is the asymptotic giant branch .",
    "the difference in luminosity , for the termination of the agb , between the two cases is quite apparent ( almost an order of magnitude ) .",
    "the diamond shows when a carbon star will be produced . by not including mass loss in stellar tracks one can seriously overestimate the luminosity of the giants in stellar populations.,width=302,height=226 ]    we have used the evolution code to create a grid of interior models with the following parameters .",
    "we computed stellar tracks for five different ( solar scaled ) metallicities : @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "we fixed the helium content for the solar model ( @xmath31 ) as to reproduce the luminosity of the sun at the present age and adopted @xmath32 , consistent with the findings of @xcite .",
    "we show some representative stellar tracks in fig  [ fig : plotiso ] for different metallicities .",
    "the tracks were evolved from an initial hayashi phase to the very late stages in a _ continuous _ run .",
    "thus it was possible to deal with the different flashes along the evolution during the giant phases .",
    "the evolution of low mass stars ( @xmath33 ) is ended after they settle onto the white dwarf cooling sequence .",
    "the evolution of massive stars ( @xmath34 ) is stopped at the end of carbon burning or if the central temperature exceeds @xmath35 . for the intermediate mass stars ,",

    "in the previous section we have shown that given moderate @xmath0 and wavelength spectral coverage , the parameters of a ssp can be accurately recovered .",
    "what is the impact of systematics in this parameter determination ?    to answer this question and also to assess how our models compare to previous work , we have done the following : first we have compared our models to those by bruzual & charlot ( 2000 models ; @xcite ) and worthey @xcite .",
    "[ fig : comp_ssp ] shows the spectral energy distributions as a function of wavelength for 3 different ages .",
    "the 3 models differ among each other over the whole spectral range .",
    "the models are more similar at older ages than at ages of 1 gyr .",
    "the typical rms variation between our models and those of bc is of @xmath36% in intensity .",
    "how important is this difference ? to address this question we have performed the following test : we pick a spectrum from our models ( with a fixed age and metallicity ) developed in this paper and add gaussian noise with @xmath37 per resolution element of 20  . we then attempt to recover the age using bruzual & charlot models .",
    "results are presented in table  [ table : models ] . as can be seen the systematic error in the _ absolute _",
    "age is about 10% while the _",
    "relative _ age difference is only of a @xmath38% .",
    "we therefore conclude that although systematic differences remain between different models , their impact on parameter recovery is at the same level as the difference in the intensity of the models",
    ".    we can also investigate the impact that mass loss can have in , for example , the colours of integrated single stellar populations . in table",
    "[ table : massloss ] we show the change in the integrated colours that different prescritions for mass loss , which translates mostly in the morphology of the hb and termination of the agb , produce .",
    "the impact can be significant in the colors if mass loss is ignored ( as much as @xmath39 magnitudes in the infrared ) , thus careful attention must be payed to this source of systematics .",
    "at @xmath40 , traditional optical bands ( @xmath41 ) fall below the rest frame wavelength that corresponds to the lyman break spectral feature ( 1216  ) , where most of the stellar radiation is extinguished either by interstellar or intergalactic hydrogen .",
    "because of this , galaxies at @xmath40 are practically invisible at those photometric bands , and even if they were detected , their colors would provide very little information about their stellar population .",
    "new detectors and space telescopes , such as sirtf ( http://sirtf.caltech.edu ) , and in particular the jwst ( http://www.stsci.edu/jwst ) , will offer the possibility of detecting very distant galaxies at ir wavelengths , and of using photometric redshifts also with far ",
    "ir colors , as proposed by @xcite .",
    "nearby star forming galaxies are known to contain a considerable amount of dust , that extinguishes a large fraction of their stellar uv light and boosts , even by orders of magnitude , their ir luminosity .",
    "the effect of dust must be taken into account in the computation of colors involving photometric bands that span a large wavelength interval .",
    "however , the search for very young proto  galaxies , perhaps the first significant star forming systems in the universe , might be pursued without having to model the effects of dust .",
    "the first stars to form in proto ",
    "galaxies must have primordial chemical composition , or at least very low metallicity ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "although it is difficult to model the formation and disruption of dust grains on a galactic scale , it is likely that the dust content of a galaxy grows together with its metallicity , and that a proto  galaxy with primordial chemical composition or very low metallicity ( @xmath42 ) has practically no dust ( e.g. @xcite ) . in this work",
    "we refer to young protogalaxies with metallicity @xmath42 as primordial protogalaxies , or ppgs .",
    "we show that , because of their very blue colour , ppgs do not suffer from very strong cosmological dimming , a feature which should aid their detectability in deep infrared surveys with the jwst .       and a salpeter ( @xmath43 ) imf with four different lower mass cutoffs : 0.1 , 2.0 , 5.0 and 10.0 m@xmath44 ( solid lines ) , from top to bottom .",
    "starbursts with no low mass stars ( @xmath45 m@xmath44 ) are about a factor of 2 fainter than starbursts with low mass stars ( @xmath46 m@xmath44 ) , at 3 @xmath47 m .",
    "note that for cutoff masses larger than 5 m@xmath44 , the spectral energy distribution changes very little , making our predictions almost independent of the exact value of the cutoff mass .",
    "the models have been normalised at 1000  . also shown is a solar metallicity starburst from @xcite ( dashed line ) .",

    "in particular , ppgs are modelled using a constant star formation rate and @xmath49 metallicity .",
    "as noted above , we expect ( and therefore assume ) that no photometrically significant quantity of dust has already been formed in ppgs .",
    "we also assume that ppgs are young objects ( age less or equal than 100 million years ) . furthermore , and in order to test the shape of the primordial imf",
    ", we have adopted a salpeter imf ( @xmath43 ) with four different low mass cutoff values : 0.1 , 2 , 5 and 10 m@xmath44 ( i.e. the imf does not contain any stars with masses below the cut - off values ) .",

    "as expected , the lack of low mass stars translates into a deficit of flux at ir wavelengths .",
    "furthermore , for a low mass cutoff larger than 5 m@xmath44 the seds do not differ much since stars with masses larger than 5 m@xmath44 have similar spectral energy distributions in the ir .",

    "although the idealized starburst model with no dust is unlikely to describe any galaxy observed nearby , it can be used as an approximate model for the uv sed of quasars , due to its rather flat sed in the far ultra violet wavelengths .    we have computed ab magnitudes ( @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is expressed in erg s@xmath55 hz@xmath55 ) for 3 different wavelengths : 1.2 , 3.6 and 8 @xmath47 m .",

    "the lower panel of fig  [ fig : imf4 ] shows that a ppg with a massive imf can be about 0.5  mag bluer in @xmath65m@xmath59m@xmath66 than a ppg with a standard imf .",
    "m@xmath44 cutoff ( dashed line ) , and @xmath93  m@xmath44 cutoff ( solid line ) . as expected from figure  11 , the biggest difference occurs for colours that sample both the near - ir ( rest  frame uv ) and the far - ir .",
    "the difference between the salpeter and the massive imf is about 0.5 mag in @xmath65m@xmath59m@xmath66 .",
    "once ppgs have been found at high @xmath96 using the broad band color ",
    "color selection from figure  12 , and their redshift has been determined with narrow band photometry , the @xmath65m@xmath59m@xmath66 color can be used to discriminate among objects with a standard salpeter imf or a @xmath93  m@xmath44 cutoff imf.,width=302,height=302 ]      in this work we propose to select ppgs as the bluest objects in deep ir surveys , on the basis of the color  color plot shown in fig .  2 .",
    "we now address the question of how a broad band photometric selection of ppgs performs , compared with searches of emission lines , such as lyman-@xmath95 and h@xmath95 .",
    "the rest frame equivalent widths of lyman-@xmath95 and h@xmath95 can be very roughly estimated by assuming that each photon below 1251 and 1025  will originate a lyman-@xmath95 and h@xmath95 photon respectively .",
    "the equivalent widths estimated in this way are of course upper limit to the true equivalent widths .",
    "we find that the equivalent width of lyman-@xmath95 is 380  while the equivalent width of h@xmath97 is 4400   the latter is so high due to the fact that the continuum at 6563   is rather faint in ppgs ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : imf1 ] ) . assuming that the lines have intrinsic widths at rest ",
    "frame typical of the virial velocity of a galaxy ( for example a line width of 300  km / s corresponds to 2 and 13   respectively ) , one finds that they will only be about 30 times brighter than the continuum at @xmath98 .",
    "since one would need to shift the narrow filter for about 500 steps , or more , to search for all possible emitters in the redshift range @xmath99 , the advantage of the lines being brighter than the continuum is offset by the number of steps needed to find all ppgs between @xmath100 and 10 .",
    "it seems therefore that ir broad band photometry is an easier way to both detect and select ppg candidates than the emission line technique , because only one deep exposure is needed to find _ all _ ppgs in the redshift range @xmath99 .",
    "note that the equivalent width of lyman-@xmath95 and h@xmath95 has been over  estimated here .",
    "moreover , the advantage of deep broad band photometry is that , together with detecting and selecting ppgs , it provides at the same time important information about their stellar populations .",
    "however , it is important that the emission line technique ( or a lyman break technique ) is available aboard the ngst , since photometric redshifts measured with narrow filters will probably be the best ( or the only ) way to further constrain the redshift of ppg broad band photometric candidates , which is necessary to extract information about their stellar population from the broad band colors ( fig .",
    "4)m detectors . ] .",
    "a star formation rate of @xmath73  m@xmath68yr over a few million years is necessary for detecting a ppg with the jwst . with such sfr , after @xmath101 years @xmath78  m@xmath44 of gas is turned into stars . in order to still have a metallicity of @xmath42 , these stars must be formed in a system with baryonic mass of at least @xmath102  m@xmath44 , that is a very large galaxy , or a small group of galaxies .",
    "such massive systems are inside large dark matter halos that are not collapsing yet at redshift @xmath99 .",
    "it is possible that ppgs that can be detected with the jwst are the progenitors of very large galaxies , in a phase when their dark matter halo has not turned around yet .",
    "if ppgs are discovered , their spectro  photometric properties could give very important clues for the problem of star formation in galaxies ( such as the origin of the stellar imf ) and their luminosity , abundance , and redshift distribution would trace the complete history of the very first star formation sites in the universe .",
    "in this paper we have presented new stellar interior tracks and single stellar population models of arbitrary age , metallicity and imf .",
    "our main findings are :    1 .",
    "a new set of stellar interior models has been presented .",
    "the models cover _ all _ stages of stellar evolution and we have built isochrones out of them for ages between @xmath103 .",
    "it is possible to construct stellar evolution models that accurately reproduce the properties of individual stars for a wide range of ages and metallicities .",
    "we have presented a new algorithm to compute the evolution of stars in the rgb , hb and agb .",
    "this algorithm makes it possible to explore the effect of variations in some of unknown parameters of stellar evolution like mass loss , mixing length etc .",
    "we have developed a new and fast algorithm to build synthetic stellar evolution spectra and colour  magnitude diagrams of arbitrary metallicity and age .",
    "we have shown that changes in the values of the stellar parameters like mass loss and mixing length can change the predicted colours of a population by as much as 0.4 mag .",
    "we have studied degeneracies in the parameter space ( age and metallicity ) and shown that these parameters are only degenerated if the wavelength range of the spectrum is very small or only a few spectral features are chosen .",
    "addition of light bluewards of the @xmath104  ( @xmath105  ) significantly reduces this degeneracies and , in fact , lifts them .",
    "it has been shown that systematic errors among different models are at the level of 10 - 20% , despite using completely different stellar input physics .",
    "it should be possible to reduce these errors even further .",
    "we have studied the photometric properties of very young proto ",
    "galaxies with primordial or very low ( @xmath51 ) metallicity and no significant effect of dust in their sed . we have named these galaxies `` primordial protogalaxies '' , or ppgs . using the methods of synthetic stellar populations , we predict that ppgs are the bluest stellar systems in the universe . they can therefore be selected in color ",
    "color diagrams obtained with deep broad band ir surveys , and can be detected with the jwst , if they have a sfr of at least @xmath73  m@xmath68yr , over a few million years .",
    "we have discussed the possibility of using the ir colours of ppgs to constrain their stellar imf , and investigated the possibility that the stellar imf arising from gas of primordial chemical composition is more `` massive '' than the standard salpeter imf .",
    "finally we have argued that broad band photometry can be more efficient than emission line searches , to detect and select ppgs .",
    "the models are available on the world wide web ( www.roe.ac.uk/@xmath106jsd and www.physics.upenn.edu/@xmath106raulj ) .",
    "we provide the stellar interior tracks presented in this paper and the single stellar population models and tools to compute photometry and synthetic stellar populations with arbitrary star formation histories .",
