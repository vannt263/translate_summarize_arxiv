    "many complex real - world systems  from chemical reactions inside cells @xcite to technological systems such as the world wide web @xcite  may be represented as networks .",
    "understanding the topological structure of these networks helps understanding the behaviour of the system on which they are based .",
    "thus , there is considerable interest in elucidating the origin and form of common structural features of networks @xcite .",
    "previous reports have identified a variety of features which are common to a range of disparate networks including : the power - law distribution of vertex degrees @xcite ; the ` small - world ' property @xcite ; and network construction from motifs @xcite amongst others .",
    "many common network features derive from common ways in which real - world networks are formed and evolve .",
    "so , for instance , growth with preferential attachment naturally leads to a power - law vertex degree distribution @xcite .",
    "as another example , common replicative growth processes , such as growth with duplication @xcite , naturally endow networks with a certain degree of structural redundancy .",
    "thus , structural redundancy  in which multiple vertices play an identical topological role  is common in real - world empirical networks @xcite . in terms of system behaviour ,",
    "structural redundancy can be beneficial since it naturally reinforces against attack by providing structural ` backups ' should network elements fail @xcite . thus , network redundancy is related to system robustness @xcite .    intuitively , two vertices are topologically equivalent if they may be permuted without altering network structure .",
    "a permutation of the vertices of a network which does not affect network adjacency is known as an _ automorphism _ and the set of network automorphisms forms a group under composition of permutations .",
    "thus , our intuitive notion of structural equivalence may be formally investigated using the mathematical language of permutation groups .",
    "crucially , symmetric networks ( those with a nontrivial automorphism group ) necessarily contain a certain amount of structural redundancy . in accordance with the observation that common growth processes",
    "naturally lead to structural redundancy , many empirical networks have richly structured automorphism groups @xcite . in this paper",
    "we shall use the automorphism group to investigate the effect of redundancy on network eigenvalue spectra .",
    "since graph eigenvalues are well - known to be related to a multitude of graph properties @xcite there has been considerable recent interest in studying the spectra of real - world complex networks and their associated models @xcite .",
    "these studies have highlighted the fact that the spectral densities of real - world networks commonly differ significantly from those of the classical ensembles of random matrix theory @xcite .",
    "for example , in @xcite the spectral density of barabsi - albert ` scale - free ' networks @xcite and watts - strogatz ` small - world ' networks @xcite are considered .",
    "barabsi - albert networks are found to have a spectral density which consists of a ` triangle - like ' bulk with power - law tails ; while watts - strogatz small world networks are found to have multiple strong local maxima in their spectral densities which are related to the blurring of singularities in the spectral density of the highly ordered @xmath0-ring structure upon which the watts - strogatz model is based .",
    "similarly , although they are not usually highly ordered , the spectral densities of real - world networks also often contain singularities .",
    "for instance singularities at the 0 and @xmath1 eigenvalues are common .",
    "previous discussions have related the singularity at @xmath2 to local multiplicities in vertices of degree @xmath3 ( stars ) , and the singularity at @xmath1 to complete subgraphs ( cliques ) @xcite although these explanations are not exhaustive .",
    "for example , the graphs in fig .",
    "[ examplegraphs ] have high multiplicity @xmath2 and @xmath1 eigenvalues which are not due to the presence of stars or cliques respectively . in general , since the relationship between a network and its spectrum is nontrivial , determining general conditions for the presence and strength of singularities in the spectral density is an open analytic problem @xcite .    based upon the observation that high - multiplicity eigenvalues commonly associate with graph symmetries @xcite we examined the relationship between network symmetry and spectral singularities .",
    "since symmetry can take many forms  cliques , stars and rings are all symmetric , for example  symmetry provides a flexible framework for interpreting the effect of a wide variety of redundant network structures on eigenvalue spectra .",
    "the structure of the remainder of the paper is as follows : in section [ sec : background ] we introduce some necessary background material on network symmetry . in particular",
    ", we examine the relationship between network topology and automorphism group structure and show how certain subgroups of the automorphism group can be related to specific network motifs . in section [ sec : spec ]",
    "we consider how a network s automorphism group interacts with its spectrum , and discuss how specific eigenvalues and eigenvectors associate with these motifs .",
    "we study in detail the most frequent of these motifs and their contribution to the network s spectrum .",
    "finally , we close with some general conclusions .",
    "a network may be thought of as a graph , @xmath4 , with vertex set , @xmath5 ( of size @xmath6 ) , and edge set , @xmath7 ( of size @xmath8 ) where vertices are said to be _ adjacent _ if there is an edge between them .",
    "an _ automorphism _ is a permutation of the vertices of the network which preserves adjacency .",
    "the set of automorphisms under composition forms a group , @xmath9 , of size @xmath10 @xcite  see fig .",
    "[ basicexample ] for an example .",
    "we say that a network is _ symmetric _",
    "( respectively _ asymmetric _ ) if it has a nontrivial ( respectively trivial ) automorphism group . since automorphisms permute vertices without altering network structure , a network s automorphims group compactly quantifies the degree and nature of the structural redundancy it carries .",
    "this correspondence between network symmetry and redundancy forms the basis of the analysis we present in this discussion .",
    "the _ support _ of an automorphism @xmath11 is the set of vertices which @xmath11 moves , @xmath12 .",
    "two sets of automorphisms @xmath13 and @xmath14 are _ support - disjoint _ if every pair of automorphisms @xmath15 and @xmath16 have disjoint supports .",
    "additionally , we say that the automorphism subgroups @xmath17 and @xmath18 generated by @xmath13 and @xmath14 are _ support - disjoint _ if @xmath13 and @xmath14 are . if this is the case , @xmath19 for all @xmath15 and @xmath16 and hence @xmath20 for all @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "thus , if @xmath17 and @xmath18 are support - disjoint then we may think of them as acting independently on the network .",
    "this notion of independent action gives us a useful means to factorize the automorphism groups of complex networks into ` irreducible building blocks ' @xcite .",
    "in particular , let @xmath23 be a network with automorphism group @xmath9 generated by a set @xmath24 of generators .",
    "partition @xmath24 into support - disjoint subsets @xmath25 such that each @xmath26 can not itself be decomposed into support - disjoint subsets .",
    "call @xmath27 the subgroup generated by @xmath26 .",
    "since each @xmath27 commutes with all others , we can construct a direct product decomposition of @xmath28 from these subgroups : @xmath29 this decomposition splits the automorphism group into smaller pieces , each of which acts independently on the network @xmath23 .",
    "if the set of generators @xmath24 satisfies two simple conditions , the decomposition of eq .",
    "[ decomp ] is unique ( up to permutation of the factors ) and irreducible @xcite . in this case",
    ", we call each factor @xmath27 a _ geometric factor _ and the direct product factorization given in eq .",
    "[ decomp ] the _ geometric decomposition _ of @xmath9 .",
    "the motivation for this naming is that this factorization relates strongly to network geometry : each factor @xmath27 may be related to a subgraph of @xmath23 , as follows .",
    "the _ induced subgraph _ on a set of vertices @xmath30 is the graph obtained by taking @xmath31 and any edges whose end points are both in @xmath31 .",
    "we call the induced subgraph on the support of a geometric factor @xmath32 a _ symmetric motif _ , denoted @xmath33 .",
    "thus @xmath32 moves the vertices of @xmath33 while fixing the rest of the vertices of @xmath23 , and @xmath33 is the smallest subgraph with this property .    fig .",
    "[ example ] shows an example network constructed from a variety of symmetric motifs commonly found in real - world networks , and its associated geometric decomposition .",
    "table [ auttable ] shows how the factors in the geometric decomposition of this network s automorphism group relate to distinct symmetric motifs in the network .",
    "examples of geometric decompositions of real - world networks can be found elsewhere @xcite .",
    "note that for simplicity we consider networks as undirected graphs ; a directed version of this decomposition is straightforward .",
    "since large ( erds - rnyi ) random graphs are expected to be asymmetric @xcite , symmetric motifs are commonly over - represented in real - world networks by comparison with random counterparts .",

    "however , our definition is much more restrictive than that of milo and co - workers since we single out motifs preserved by any ( global ) symmetry of the network .",

    "the presence of singularities in the eigenvalue spectra of real - world networks has been previously observed and reasons for certain of these peaks has been discussed @xcite . in this section",
    "we aim to extend these previous results by outlining a formal framework in which to consider general spectral characteristics of redundancy .",
    "we do so by considering interactions between a network s automorphism group and the eigenvalues of its adjacency matrix .",
    "the _ adjacency matrix _ of a simple network @xmath23 is the @xmath43 symmetric matrix @xmath44 the eigenvalues of @xmath23 are the eigenvalues of its adjacency matrix , and the set of eigenvalues is the _ network s",
    "spectrum_. for undirected networks , the matrix @xmath45 is symmetric and therefore all eigenvalues are real and there is an orthonormal basis of eigenvectors . for the remainder of this discussion we shall focus on simple undirected networks .",
    "the spectral density of a simple network @xmath23 is the density of its eigenvalues , which can be written as a sum of dirac delta - functions @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the @xmath48th largest eigenvalue of @xmath23 .",
    "consider @xmath11 , a permutation of the vertices of @xmath23 , which can be represented by a permutation matrix @xmath49 where @xmath50 the relationship between network symmetry and eigenvalue spectra depends centrally upon the fact that @xmath51 if and only if @xmath52 and @xmath49 commute @xcite .",
    "thus , if @xmath53 is an eigenvector of @xmath52 corresponding to the eigenvalue @xmath54 then @xmath55 is also an eigenvector of @xmath52 corresponding to @xmath54 .",
    "since @xmath56 and @xmath53 are generally linearly independent , this means that network symmetry ( and thus redundancy ) naturally gives rise to eigenvalues with high multiplicity and therefore singularities in the spectral density . in the following sections we shall develop this result a little further and",
    "show how certain network eigenvalues may be associated directly with symmetric motifs .",
    "first we need to recall the notion of quotient graph .      since automorphisms permute vertices without altering network structure , a network s automorphism group may be used to partition its vertex set @xmath5 into disjoint strutural equivalence classes called _ orbits _ ( see fig .",
    "[ basicexample ] ) . for every vertex @xmath57 , the set of vertices to which @xmath58 maps under the action of the automorphism group @xmath59",
    "is called the @xmath28-orbit of @xmath58 , written @xmath60 or simply @xmath61 .",
    "more formally , @xmath62 similarly , if @xmath32 is a subgroup of @xmath28 , the @xmath32-orbit of a vertex @xmath58 is the set @xmath63 since vertices in the same orbit may be permuted without altering network structure , they are structurally indistinguishable from each other ( that is , they play precisely the same topological role in the network ) .",
    "thus , a network s orbit structure efficiently quantifies the degree of structural redundancy the network carries .",
    "for example , the vertices in fig .",
    "[ example ] are coloured by orbit .    since",
    "the vertices in each orbit are structurally equivalent , they may be associated with each other to form the basis of a network coarse - graining known in the context of algebraic graph theory as the _ quotient graph_. more specifically , let @xmath64 be the system of orbits which the vertices of @xmath23 are partitioned into under the action of @xmath28 .",
    "let @xmath65 ( @xmath66 ) be the number of edges starting from a vertex in @xmath67 and ending in vertices in @xmath68 .",
    "since the orbits partition the vertex set into disjoint equivalence classes , @xmath65 depends on @xmath48 and @xmath69 alone .",
    "the _ quotient _ @xmath70 of @xmath23 under the action of @xmath28 is the multi - digraph with vertex set @xmath71 and adjacency matrix @xmath72 .",
    "we refer to the network @xmath23 as the _ parent _ of @xmath70 .",
    "crucially , the quotient of @xmath23 retains the unique structural elements of @xmath23 yet , by associating structurally equivalent elements , factors out all redundancy .",
    "previous reports have shown that quotients of many empirical networks can be as small as 20% the size of their parent networks yet preserve precisely key network properties which determine system function @xcite .",
    "note that we can similarly define the quotient of @xmath23 under the action of any subgroup @xmath32 of @xmath28 ( hence factoring out just a fraction of the redundancy ) .    a key result for the present discussion is that , for any given graph @xmath23 , set of eigenvalues of its quotient are a subset of those of @xmath23 @xcite . given a graph @xmath23 with orbits @xmath73 and an eigenpair @xmath74 of the quotient graph @xmath70 ,",
    "then @xmath54 is also an eigenvalue of the parent network @xmath23 with an eigenvector consisting on an identical value @xmath75 on all the vertices of @xmath67 .",
    "thus , a network s automorphism group may be used to construct a factorization of its characteristic polynomial , via its quotient . additionally ,",
    "since quotients carry less repetition than their parent networks , we find that quotient spectra generally contain less degeneracy than their parent networks .",
    "[ spectra ] illustrates this point by giving the spectral densities of 6 representative ( biological , social and technological ) networks and their quotients .",
    "as expected , in each case the spectral density of the parent network contains peaks which are significantly reduced in the spectral density of its quotient . in the following section we will make this relation more explicit by associating specific network eigenvalues with specific symmetric motifs .",
    "these , together with the eigenvalues coming from the quotient , describe the entire spectrum of the network .",
    "( color online ) . in all cases ,",
    "the spectral density of the parent is in dark grey ( blue online ) while that of the quotient is in light grey ( red online ) . _",

    "note that the y - axis is on a logarithmic scale : in each case , the differences in redundant eigenvalue multiplicities between the parent network and its quotient are significant ( see table [ spectratable]).,scaledwidth=50.0% ]      there have been some previous attempts to spot the eigenvalues of key subgraphs in network spectra @xcite .",
    "however subgraph eigenvalues are not usually contained in network spectra , and in general they only interlace those of the network @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , certain eigenvalues associated with symmetric motifs are retained in network spectra .",
    "we call them _ redundant _ eigenvalues , and they are described as follows .",
    "recall the physical meaning of a eigenvalue - eigenvector pair of an undirected graph .",
    "consider a vector @xmath76 on the vertex set of a graph , and write @xmath75 for the value at a vertex @xmath48 .",
    "write on each vertex the sum of the numbers found on the neighbours of that vertex .",
    "if the new vector is a multiple of @xmath76 , say @xmath77 , then @xmath76 is an eigenvector with eigenvalue @xmath54 .",
    "we shall say that an eigenvalue - eigenvector pair @xmath78 of a symmetric motif @xmath79 ( considered as an induced subgraph ) is _ redundant _ if , for each @xmath32-orbit @xmath80 , the sum @xmath81 . for example , in table [ starstable ] the redundant eigenvectors are starred : the coordinates are separeted by orbits and the sum over each orbit is zero .",
    "indeed , it can be shown that if @xmath82 has @xmath83 vertices and @xmath84",
    "@xmath32-orbits , there is an orthonormal basis of eigenvectors of @xmath82 such that @xmath85 of them are redundant , and the remaining @xmath84 are constant on each orbit ( see appendix [ appendixa ] ) .",
    ".[starstable ] [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we say that an eigenvalue @xmath54 is _ redundant with multiplicity @xmath84 _ if there are up to @xmath84 linearly independent eigenvectors @xmath86 such that all the pairs @xmath87 are redundant .",
    "for example , the eigenvalue @xmath2 in the fourth motif of table [ auttable ] has multiplicity 4 but redundant multiplicity 3 .",
    "the crucial property is that redundant eigenvalues are retained , with their _ redundant _ multiplicity , in the network spectrum : if @xmath88 is a redundant eigenvalue - eigenvector pair of a symmetric motif @xmath82 then @xmath89 is an eigenvalue - eigenvector pair for the whole network , where @xmath90 is formed by setting @xmath91 for all @xmath92 and setting @xmath93 for all @xmath94 .",
    "is adjacent to either all or none of the vertices of each @xmath32-orbit @xmath95 , since the action of @xmath32 permutes transitively the vertices of @xmath95 while fixing @xmath69 , hence the value at @xmath69 remains zero and satisfies the eigenvector - eigenvalue relation @xmath96 .",
    "] we call such an eigenvector _ @xmath82-local _ : it is constructed from a redundant eigenvector of a symmetric motif @xmath82 by setting entries to zero on the vertices outside @xmath82 .",
    "the non - redundant eigenvalues of @xmath82 will not , in general , be retained in the network spectrum but rather will change depending on how the motif is embedded in the network ( more precisely , on the topology of the quotient graph )  for instance , see the examples in tables [ auttable ] and [ starstable ] .",
    "_ remark : _ the argument above applies naturally to symmetric motifs but not necessarily to single orbits : a redundant eigenvector of an orbit will not necessarily give an eigenvector of the whole network ( see for instance the closing remark on table [ bsm2 ] ) .",
    "the reason is that it may not be possible to treat one orbit on its own if the action is not ` independent ' on this orbit . the smallest independent actions ( and their associated subgraphs ) are precisely given by the geometric factorization of eq .",
    "[ decomp ] .",
    "the symmetric motifs are the smallest subgraphs whose redundant eigenvalues survive to the spectrum of the whole network .",
    "on the other hand , consider the quotient graph of a network @xmath23 . recall that if @xmath88 is an eigenpair of the quotient then @xmath97 is an eigenpair of @xmath23 , where @xmath98 is obtained setting the identical value @xmath75 on all the vertices of the @xmath48th orbit .",
    "we say that the eigenvector of the parent network @xmath98 is _ lifted _ from the eigenvector @xmath76 of the quotient .",
    "the key result is that these two procedures explain completely the whole spectrum of @xmath23 : if @xmath23 has @xmath83 vertices and @xmath84 orbits , we can find a basis of eigenvectors @xmath99 such that the first @xmath84 are lifted from a basis of eigenvectors of the quotient @xmath100 and the remaining come from the redundant eigenvectors of the symmetric motifs of @xmath23 .",
    "see appendix [ appendixb ] for full details and table [ starstable ] for examples .",
    "finally , note that the @xmath101 s are constant on each orbit and the @xmath102 s are redundant on each orbit ( the sum of the coordinates is zero ) .",
    "recall that the spectrum of the quotient graph is a subset of the spectrum of the parent network .",
    "the redundant eigenvalues are exactly the ones ` lost ' in the spectrum of the quotient graph ( appendix [ appendixa ] ) .",
    "hence the proportion of a network s spectrum due to redundancy is obtained by comparing the size of the parent graph to the size of its quotient .",
    "this varies from network to network but can be as small as 20% @xcite .",
    "thus this phenomena is non - trivial and can account for up to 80% of the network spectrum .    until now we have been counting repeated eigenvalues",
    "separately ( that is , we have considered eigenpairs after fixing an appropriate basis of eigenvectors ) .",
    "what can we say about the multiplicity of these redundant eigenvalues ?",
    "there is no general principle beyond the general rule of thumb that the multiplicity is directly correlated to the size of the automorphism group .",
    "for example , if a network has an orbit of @xmath83 vertices such that all the permutations of these vertices are allowed ( ie .",
    "@xmath103 acts naturally on the orbit ) then there will be a redundant @xmath82-local eigenvalue with multiplicity at least @xmath104 , ( see appendix [ appendixc ] ) .",
    "conversely , a graph with only simple eigenvalues has an automorphism which is a subgroup of @xmath105 @xcite .",
    "one obvious question remains : what are the possible redundant eigenvalues associated with symmetric motifs ? in principle , there is no restriction so we should rephrase the question as : what are the most commonly ocurring redundant eigenvalues in ` real - world ' networks ?",
    "we now address this question by focussing on the most commonly ocurring symmetric motifs .",
    "most symmetric motifs ( typically more than 90% ) found in real - world networks conform to the following pattern @xcite : they consist of one or more orbits of @xmath83 vertices ( @xmath106 ) with a natural symmetric action , that is , the geometric factor @xmath32 ( the subgroup of symmetries permuting only vertices of the motif ) consists of _ all _ the permutations of the @xmath83 vertices of each orbit and hence @xmath107 .",
    "therefore , each @xmath32-orbit is either the empty graph @xmath108 , or the complete graph @xmath109 , on @xmath83 vertices .",
    "every vertex not in the motif is a fixed point with respect to @xmath32 and hence is joined to either all or none of the vertices of each orbit .",
    "moreover , two orbits may be joined in one of only four possible ways shown in table [ tablejoints ] ( for a proof see @xcite ) . for example , the graphs in table [ auttable ] would be , in this notation , @xmath110 , @xmath111 , @xmath112 , @xmath113 and @xmath110 , while the last graph does not follow this pattern .",

    "( bsm ) , while all others which do not conform to this pattern we call _ complex_. complex motifs are rare @xcite and their spectrum can be studied separately . however , since they have a constrained shape , it is possible to systematically analyze all the possible contributions that bsms make to the spectra of the whole network .",
    "in particular , specific network eigenvalues may be directly associated with bsms .",
    "we have carried this analysis out for bsms up to 3 orbits . in all cases ,",
    "each redundant eigenvalue of a bsm will have multiplicity a multiple of @xmath104 ( appendix [ appendixc ] ) .",
    "there are two symmetric motifs with one orbit , @xmath109 and @xmath108 , and they are both basic . their spectrum is shown in table [ bsm1 ] .",
    "we use the notation @xmath118 for the ( redundant ) vector with non - zero entries 1 in the first position and @xmath1 on the @xmath48th position ( @xmath119 ) , and * 1 * for the vector with constant entries 1 .",
    "as predicted , each motif has a redundant eigenvalue of multiplicity @xmath104 , which survives as an eigenvalue of the same multiplicity in the spectrum of _ any _ network containing such a subgraph as a symmetric motif .",
