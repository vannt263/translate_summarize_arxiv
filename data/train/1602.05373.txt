    "the model theory oriented formalisation by goguen and burstall @xcite of the notion of a logical system as an _ institution _ has started a line of important developments of adequately abstract and general approaches to the foundations of software specifications and formal system development ( see @xcite ) as well as a modern version of very abstract model theory ( see @xcite ) .",
    "one of the main original motivations for introducing institution theory was to respond to the explosion in the population of logics in use in computing about three decades ago , a situation that continues today perhaps at an accelerated pace . among the logics with relevance in various areas of informatics",
    "there is of course the family of modal logics , with its great multiplicity of flavours .",
    "the recent works on ` modalizations ' of institutions @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , in which only the modalities ( and eventually nominals and @xmath0 ) and kripke semantics are kept explicit , while the other ingredients ( e.g. sorts , functions , predicates , constraints , etc . ) are abstracted away , has intensified the quest for a fully abstract institution theoretic approach that has the potential to address adequately the specificities of modality and kripke semantics while leaving none of these explicit .",
    "our paper proposes stratified institutions of @xcite as a general framework for a fully abstract approach to the semantics of modal logic .",
    "in particular this means no explicit modalities , no explicit kripke structures , while still retaining the essence of kripke semantics .",
    "consequently a very general form of model theory uniformly applicable to a wide range of concrete modal logic systems , either conventional or more eccentric , can be developed .",
    "results can be developed in a top - down manner with hypotheses kept as general as possible and introduced on a by - need basis , the whole development process being guided by structurally clean causality . from the perspective of institution theory ,",
    "our proposal yields an institution theoretic structure fully capable of addressing modality .",
    "the conventional definition of institution @xcite may lack enough structure to capture various specificities of modal logics , hence our work can be regarded as a minimal but sufficient refinement of the concept of institution towards modal logics .",
    "we illustrate the power of our concepts with the development of very general modal - oriented ultraproducts method .",
    "this provides rather automatically o - style theorems @xcite for a wide range of concrete modal systems , as a puzzle of preservation results in the style of @xcite . in conventional model theory",
    "the method of ultraproducts is renowned as extremely powerful and pervading a lot of deep results ( see @xcite , for example ) , many of these been lifted to the level of abstract institutions ( see @xcite ) .",
    "our developments may represent the beginning of a similar journey in the realm of modality and kripke semantics . from the many consequences of ultraproducts , here we focus only on compactness results .",
    "hence we derive a series of modal compactness results for our benchmark examples , this process having a generic nature .      1 .",
    "we recall briefly some category and institution theoretic concepts and notations that are necessary for our paper .",
    "2 .   we from @xcite the concept of stratified institution and slightly upgrade it .",
    "ordinary institutions arise as stratified institutions with a trivial stratification ; in this way stratified institutions can be seen as more general than ordinary institutions .",
    "the move in the other direction is given by two general interpretations of stratified institutions as ordinary institutions .",
    "they represent high abstractions of the concepts of _ local _ and _ global satisfaction _ from modal logic , respectively .",
    "we provide a series of examples of stratified institutions that include both conventional and eccentric modal logic systems .",
    "the former category includes propositional and first order modal logic , possibly with hybrid and polyadic modalities features , while the latter includes the double hybridization of @xcite and a first order valuation semantics for first order modal logic that is based upon the ` internal stratification ' example introduced in @xcite .",
    "these are to be used as benchmark examples for the further developments in the paper .",
    "4 .   we give a straightforward extension of the well known institution theoretic semantics of the boolean connectives @xmath1 , @xmath2 , etc . and of the quantifiers @xmath3 , @xmath4 to the more refined level of stratified institutions and establish the relationship with their correspondents from the local and the global institutions associated to the stratified institution . 5 .",
    "we introduce a semantics for modalities and for hybrid features in abstract stratified institutions .",
    "this is one of the crucial contributions of this paper .",
    "we extend the institution theoretic method of ultraproducts @xcite to stratified institutions .",
    "the core contributions here consist of a series of general preservation results across the abstract semantics for boolean connectives , quantifiers , modalities , nominals , @xmath0 . these cover related previous developments from @xcite ( also to be found in @xcite ) , but with significant differences in generality : ( 1 ) stratified institutions with their lack of commitment to explicit modalities and kripke structures are much more general than the ` modalized ' institutions of @xcite ; ( 2 ) the results of our paper cover polyadic modalities and hybrid features while @xcite considers only the unary @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "the above mentioned differences reflect very much in the way the preservation results are actually obtained .",

    "this property holds both in the simpler case when the @xmath57-models are @xmath93-models but also in the case when they are kripke models ; in the latter situation , in the case of the first order variables the uniqueness of @xmath730 relies upon the fact that interpretations of the underlying carriers and of the first order constants are shared across the possible worlds .",

    "it remains to show that @xmath744 is a homomorphism of @xmath149-models .",
