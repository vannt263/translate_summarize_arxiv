    "since the discovery of @xmath3 as a ferromagnetic semiconductor by tsubokawa @xcite this narrow class of materials has attracted increasing interest . to some part this is for fundamental reasons , since these compounds serve as ideal candidates for the heisenberg model .",
    "however , the prospect of using ferromagnetic semiconductors in spin electronics has motivated an even greater amount of research activities in the last years .",
    "only recently , @xmath4 has been shown to exhibit long - range ferromagnetic order below @xmath5k with a magnetization of 5@xmath6 per formula unit @xcite and an optical band gap of about 0.6ev as determined by electronic structure calculations @xcite .",
    "rubidium tetrachlorochromide , @xmath0 , also belongs to this class of non - metallic ferromagnets albeit with a much lower ordering temperature of @xmath7k @xcite .",
    "according to neutron scattering measurements of the spin - wave dispersion this compound behaves as a two - dimensional , @xmath8 , easy - plane ferromagnet with an in - plane exchange constant of @xmath9k @xcite .",
    "since the interlayer coupling was estimated to be about four orders of magnitude smaller than the intralayer interaction , three - dimensional long - range order was also attributed to the weak uniaxial anisotropy .",
    "the latter , in addition , leads to a small energy gap of about 0.1mev in the spin wave dispersion at the center of the brillouin zone , which precludes true xy - type behaviour @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the anisotropy causes a canting of the ordered spins of @xmath10 away from the @xmath11 direction @xcite . from susceptibility measurements and neutron scattering investigations of the static critical properties a crossover from an ideal two - dimensional xy - like behaviour to a narrow three - dimensional region on approaching @xmath12 from either side of the transition",
    "was inferred @xcite .    the crystal structure of @xmath0",
    "is closely related to the body - centered tetragonal structure of @xmath2 with space group @xmath13 ( i4/mmm ) . in this structure",
    "the magnetic ions are arranged on a square planar lattice and coupled via the anions located midway between them .",
    "however , the cr @xmath14 electronic configuration in @xmath0 with triply occupied @xmath15 states and an orbital degeneracy in the singly occupied @xmath16 states is susceptible to a jahn - teller instability .",
    "indeed , the situation is not unlike that found for @xmath17 , which has a cu @xmath18 configuration .",
    "while for the copper compound early experiments were interpreted in favour of the @xmath2 structure with octahedra compressed parallel to the @xmath19-axis , khomskii and kugel argued on the basis of theoretical considerations that this structure was incompatible with the observed ferromagnetic order @xcite . subsequently performed neutron and x - ray diffraction studies confirmed these ideas and gave evidence for a side - centered orthorhombic lattice with space group @xmath20 ( cmca ) and two formula units per cell @xcite . in this structure",
    ", the octahedra are elongated with the long axis lying in the plane and pointing alternatively parallel to the @xmath21- and @xmath22-axis of the parent @xmath2 unit cell . for @xmath0 , first evidence for",
    "the orthorhombic structure came from nmr experiments , which revealed that the local environments of the chromium sites are elongated chlorine octahedra having almost tetragonal symmetry @xcite .",
    "lateron , the space group @xmath20 ( cmca ) was also confirmed for @xmath0 @xcite .    in this space group",
    "the rb atoms occupy the wyckoff positions ( 8d ) , @xmath23 , with @xmath24 and the cr atoms are located at the ( 4a ) sites at @xmath25 .",
    "the apical cl atoms are found at the wyckoff positions ( 8d ) with @xmath26 , whereas the equatorial cl atoms occupy the ( 8f ) positions at @xmath27 . here",
    ", the distortion parameter @xmath28 characterizes the deviation from the ideal @xmath2-structure ; the experimental value of @xmath29 corresponds to a @xmath30  shift of the cl ions off the central positions between two neighbouring cr sites @xcite . as a consequence , the in - plane cr - cl bond distances amount to 2.70 and 2.39 , whereas the apical distance is 2.37 .    despite their analogous crystal structures",
    "there is one important difference distinguishing @xmath0 from @xmath17 . in the latter compound",
    ", the single unpaired electron in the @xmath18 configuration of the cu@xmath31 ion occupies the @xmath32 or @xmath33 orbital , depending on the orientation of the local octahedron . due to the peculiarities of the crystal structure the local axes of neighbouring cu sites",
    "are orthogonal and so are the orbitals . hence , according to the goodenough - kanamori - anderson ( gka ) rules ferromagnetic order results . in contrast , the @xmath14 configuration of the cr@xmath31 ions is characterized by a single @xmath16 electron in a @xmath34 or @xmath35 orbital .",
    "yet , despite their @xmath36 rotation , orbitals of this kind placed at neighbouring sites are not orthogonal and the gka rules would be in favour of an antiferromagnetic coupling .    in order to resolve this issue in a more systematic manner , feldkemper and",
    "weber started from a multiband hubbard model , which included both the metal @xmath37 and the ligand @xmath38 orbitals @xcite . using a rayleigh - schrdinger perturbation expansion to map this model onto an effective heisenberg hamiltonian they were able to describe the superexchange coupling between magnetic sites . due to the inclusion of various interaction paths",
    "their calculations extended the basic gka rules and resulted in a net ferromagnetic interplanar coupling in agreement with the experimental findings .    in this letter , we take account of the obvious lack of first principles studies for @xmath0 and complement the model approaches by electronic structure calculations , thereby continuing previous work on ferromagnetic semiconductors @xcite . in doing so , we aim especially at extending the current understanding of the interplay between the jahn - teller distortion and the optical band gap as well as the magnetic ordering .",
    "previous electronic structure calculations for @xmath17 , which confirmed the non - metallic ferromagnetic ground state , demonstrated , that neither the lattice distortion due to the jahn - teller instability nor the magnetic order alone are sufficient to produce the optical band gap @xcite .",
    "since ferromagnetic ordering was also found for the ideal @xmath2 structure ( @xmath39 ) , it is the semiconducting ground state , which requires the jahn - teller effect , and not the magnetic order .",
    "our results for @xmath0 are in line with this interpretation .",
    "the calculations are based on density functional theory and the local density approximation as implemented in the scalar - relativistic augmented spherical wave method @xcite . in order to represent the correct shape of the crystal potential in the large voids of the open crystal structure , additional augmentation spheres were inserted .",
    "optimal augmentation sphere positions as well as radii of all spheres were automatically generated by the sphere geometry optimization ( sgo ) algorithm @xcite .",
    "self - consistency was achieved by an efficient algorithm for convergence acceleration @xcite .",
    "brillouin zone sampling was done using an increasing number of @xmath40-points ranging up to 576 points within the irreducible wedge .",
    "partial densities of states as grown out of both spin - degenerate and spin - polarized calculations are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .    of the three groups of bands the first one extending from about @xmath41ev to @xmath42ev originates predominantly from the cl @xmath43 states .",
    "in contrast , the second and third group as found at and above the fermi level trace back mainly to the cr @xmath1 @xmath15 and @xmath16 states .",
    "@xmath37-@xmath38 hybridization , leading to admixtures of these states in the energy region , where the respective other partner dominates , is much reduced .",
    "finally , taking into account spin - polarization by allowing for long - range ferromagnetic order , we observe an almost rigid exchange splitting of the @xmath37 states of @xmath44ev going along with a total energy lowering of about 0.3ryd per unit cell .",
    "the calculated magnetic moment of @xmath45 per chromium site agrees perfectly well with the value of @xmath46 as deduced from neutron diffraction data @xcite .",
    "concentrating on the small energy region of the cr @xmath1 states we display in figs .",
    "[ fig2 ]    and [ fig3 ]    the electronic band structure and the partial cr @xmath1 densities of states . for the former we use the brillouin zone of the side - centered orthorhombic lattice with the high - symmetry points @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50",
    "( see figs .   4 and 5 of ref .",
    "@xcite for more details on the relation between the brillouin zones of @xmath2 and @xmath17/@xmath0 ) .",
    "the almost vanishing dispersion along the line @xmath51-@xmath52 reflects the two - dimensional nature of the crystal structure . in the representation of the partial densities of states we use the local coordinate system with the @xmath53 axis pointing parallel to the elongated distance of the local @xmath54 octahedron .",
    "we distinguish the narrow cr @xmath1 @xmath15 states from the @xmath55 and @xmath56 contributions . due to the elongation of the octahedra the @xmath55 states",
    "are shifted to lower energies as compared to the @xmath56 states . as a consequence ,",
    "we observe energetical overlap of the @xmath55 states with the @xmath15 bands and a gap of about @xmath57ev between the @xmath16 states .    while the spin - degenerate calculations lead to metallic behaviour , the exchange splitting places the fermi energy between the spin - majority @xmath55 and @xmath56 states , leaving an optical band gap of @xmath58ev .",
    "our results thus clearly confirm the orbital ordering as deduced from the polarized neutron diffraction data by mnninghoff _",
    "et al . _  with all five @xmath37 orbitals singly occupied except for the @xmath56 orbital , which is empty @xcite .",
    "in addition to the above calculations we have considered an antiferromagnetic order with antiparallel spin alignment of the two cr sites inside the side - centered orthorhombic unit cell .",
    "again , the bands experience an almost rigid spin splitting , which gives room for an optical gap of @xmath59ev .",
    "the magnetic moments per chromium site amount to @xmath60 .",
    "yet , the energy of the antiferromagnetic solution is by @xmath61mev higher than that found for the ferromagnetic situation .",
    "all calculations presented so far were based on the experimental crystal structure , i.e.  for @xmath29 . in order to study the effect of the distortion on the electronic and magnetic properties we performed additional calculations for several values of @xmath28 varying from zero to 1.5 times the experimental value .",
    "the results are summarized in table [ tab1 ] ,    .total energies ( in ryd per 2 cr ) , magnetic moments ( in @xmath6 ) , and optical band gap ( in ev ) for different distortion parameters @xmath28 .",
    "the experimental crystal structure corresponds to @xmath62 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     which comprises spin - polarized calculations with both ferro- and antiferromagnetic order .",
    "obviously , the total energies for both situations assume a minimum for the experimental value of @xmath28",
    ". however , for the antiferromagnetic solutions total energies are by @xmath63mev above those for the ferromagnetic case .",
    "in contrast , the optical band gap for both kinds of spin - polarized calculations assumes a maximum value at @xmath62 ; it vanishes for ferromagnetic order in the ideal @xmath2 structure as has been also observed in our previous work on @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "surprisingly , the magnetic moments at the cr sites are almost independent of the distortion parameter @xmath28 , i.e.  of the cr - cl bond lengths .",
    "this is due to the localized nature of these moments , which forms the basis for the treatment within the heisenberg model , and reflects the finding of feldkemper and weber that a reasonable variation of hopping parameters changes the magnetic coupling only slightly @xcite",
    ".    finally , we aim at understanding the role of the jahn - teller effect for the changes of the electronic states . to this end",
    ", we display band structures calculated for hypothetical crystal structures with zero distortion parameter @xmath28 in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] .    on comparing these results to fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we recognize as the main effect of the jahn - teller distortion the splitting of the bands in the middle of the line p-@xmath51 as well as near the x- and n - points .",
    "while in the spin - degenerate case this splitting occurs at about 1ev above the fermi energy , it opens the optical band gap for the ferromagnetically ordered state .",
    "surprisingly , the spin - majority bands for @xmath64 and finite distortion as displayed in these figures look very similar to the spin - degenerate bands of @xmath2 , where the band degeneracies occur exactly at the x- and n - points and thus give rise to perfect fermi - surface nesting @xcite . while the nesting is not complete here , one would nevertheless be tempted to interpret the jahn - teller effect as resulting from a fermi - surface instability of the spin - majority bands .",
    "however , we point out that , due to the comparatively low curie temperature of @xmath0 , we can not use the spin - polarized calculation as a starting point but would rather need the band structure of a paramagnetic system , which is not available .",
    "in conclusion , we have reported on the first density functional based electronic structure calculation for the ferromagnetic semiconductor @xmath0 . in agreement with the available experimental data we obtain a two - dimensional disperion of the electronic bands and a non - metallic ferromagnetically ordered ground state .",
    "the well localized magnetic moments of @xmath65 are carried by the cr @xmath1 @xmath15 and @xmath55 orbitals , in perfect agreement with the magnetic moments and orbital occupations deduced from neutron diffraction experiments .",
    "studying the influence of the jahn - teller distortion we find only minor influence on the size and ferromagnetic order of the magnetic moments , thus confirming the model approach by feldkemper and weber .",
    "in contrast , the electronic band structure experiences drastic changes on switching on the jahn - teller distortion turning , in particular , from metallic to semiconducting ."
