    "there has been active studies on diluted magnetic semiconductors ( dms s ) for the last two decades because of their unique magneto - optical and magneto - transport properties such as giant negative magnetoresistance , extremely large electronic @xmath5 factor , large faraday rotation , etc.@xcite recently the interest has surged again because of their possible applications to `` spintronics '' based on the semiconductor technology.@xcite dms s , which are made by substitution of small amount of late 3@xmath0 magnetic transition - metal ( tm ) atoms such as mn , fe , and co ions into cation sites in the ii - vi or iii - v compound semiconductors , involve both semiconductor physics and magnetism .",
    "the band gap energy turns out to change with the doping concentration.@xcite moreover , in some dms s , the variation of the doping concentration was found to induce magnetic phase transitions , such as paramagnetic to spin glass phase and spin glass to antiferromagnetic phase,@xcite and even ferromagnetism can also be induced by injecting carriers or photon irradiation.@xcite    here our studies are mainly focused on the electronic structure of ii - vi based dms s .",
    "the ii - vi compounds such as znse and znte have a zinc - blende crystal structure , in which the cation zn@xmath6 ions are under the tetrahedral @xmath7 site symmetry .",
    "the tm doping induces merely small changes of the lattice - constants within the crystal structure .",
    "the @xmath8 electrons of the tm atoms , which act like the zn @xmath8 electrons , participate in the ligand @xmath4-zn @xmath9 bonding - antibonding states .",
    "these states , which correspond to the respective valence band and conduction band of the host semiconductor , are hardly affected by the doping@xcite . meanwhile , the tm 3@xmath0 electrons provide rather localized additional band states , which is expected to be located energetically in the wide band gap of the bonding - antibonding states .",
    "optical absorption studies of dms s showed the intra - atomic @xmath0-@xmath0 transitions which can be understood by the 3@xmath0 coulomb multiplets excited from the corresponding ionic high - spin ground state.@xcite in spite of the ionic characteristics , the tm 3@xmath0 electrons are known to make strong covalent bonding with ligand @xmath4 electrons .",
    "furthermore , this covalent bonding , which is often represented by `` @xmath4-@xmath0 '' hybridization , is expected to play an important role in the interesting magneto - transport and magneto - optical properties such as giant faraday rotation and zeeman splitting.@xcite    in order to understand the electronic structure of these dms s , several photoemission spectroscopy measurements have been performed , mostly utilizing @xmath10 resonance phenomena near the tm 3@xmath4 absorption edge.@xcite this technique enables us to separate out the tm 3@xmath0 contribution to the electronic structure , and one can extract a sort of the 3@xmath0 partial spectral weight . the resulting 3@xmath0 spectral weight",
    "was found to be distributed in a very wide range of the valence band , no matter what the doping concentration is , indicating the strong @xmath11 hybridization of ligand @xmath4 band and the tm 3@xmath0 orbitals .",
    "meanwhile , the 3@xmath0 spectral line shape does not agree with the band structure calculations.@xcite for such reasons , the tm 3@xmath0 partial spectral weights have been tried to be interpreted in terms of a many - body approach like a cluster model calculation with configuration interaction@xcite ( ci ) or an anderson impurity model calculation.@xcite these model calculations , which are characterized by phenomenological physical quantities such as tm 3@xmath0 on - site coulomb energy , @xmath11 hybridization , and the ligand @xmath4 to tm 3@xmath0 charge transfer energy , have been very successful in describing the electronic structure of tm compounds.@xcite    soft x - ray absorption spectroscopy ( xas ) is another powerful high - energy probe to investigate the electronic structure of transition metal compounds.@xcite especially in diluted systems , xas has big advantages over the photoemission measurements .",
    "figure 1 shows xas spectra at tm @xmath3-edges of zn@xmath1mn@xmath2se  ( @xmath12 ) , zn@xmath1fe@xmath2se  ( @xmath13 ) , and zn@xmath1co@xmath2se   ( @xmath14 ) , which result from tm 2@xmath4 @xmath15 3@xmath0 dipole transitions .",
    "the spectra are dominated by the large 2@xmath4 core hole spin - orbit coupling energy , which divides them into roughly the @xmath16 and @xmath17 regions at low and high photon energy , respectively .",
    "the absorption process is a local process and its energy is determined by the characteristic core - hole energy . despite the fact that the systems contain relatively small concentration of tm atoms , all the spectra nicely reveal the complex spectral structure , which is originated from the 2@xmath4 core - hole-3@xmath0 coulomb multiplets , and one can determine important physical quantities to understand the electronic structure by analysing them .",
    "the photoemission spectroscopy is known to directly probe the electronic structure and the tm 3@xmath4-edge resonant photoemission spectroscopy enables us to extract the tm 3@xmath0 partial spectrum .",
    "however , the extracted spectrum somehow differs from the true tm 3@xmath0 electronic structure because of the different transition matrix elements in the resonant process from those in the direct photoemission process .",
    "hence it is worthwhile to verify the physical quantities determined from the tm 3@xmath4-edge resonant photoemission studies by analysing the xas results .",
    "furthermore , in a view of the experimental technique , the xas is rather bulk - sensitive , different from the resonant photoemission spectroscopy , and the results are much less sensitive to the surface condition of samples .",
    "only a few xas studies , however , have been performed for dms s so far.@xcite further , the reported studies were mostly focused on xas spectra of the ligand atoms such as s @xmath18-edge@xcite and te @xmath19-edge and @xmath16-edge.@xcite the studies concluded qualitatively that the @xmath4-@xmath0 hybridization is strong and the @xmath4-@xmath0 hybridization strength depends on the ligand ions.@xcite however , quantitative analysis for the electronic structure has not been carried out .    in this paper , we report high - resolution xas studies to investigate the electronic structure of various ii - vi dms s .",
    "the xas spectra at the tm @xmath3 edges are analysed by using a tetrahedral cluster model calculation including ci as well as the full ionic multiplets .",
    "previously , the model calculations for tm @xmath20-edge xas spectra were performed only for condensed systems such as divalent ni compounds,@xcite ti@xmath21o@xmath22,@xcite coo,@xcite and livo@xmath21.@xcite , and showed that the ci considerably affects the xas spectrum .",
    "thus it is also important to elucidate how the effects of ci appear in the xas spectra of diluted systems like dms s .",
    "the samples used in this study were zn@xmath1mn@xmath2se  ( @xmath12 ) , zn@xmath1fe@xmath2se   ( @xmath23 ) , and zn@xmath1co@xmath2se  ( @xmath24 ) thin films grown by molecular beam epitaxy on the gaas ( 001 ) substrate and a zn@xmath1mn@xmath2te  ( @xmath25 ) single crystal with ( 110 ) surface .",
    "the details of the sample growth and characterization were reported elsewhere.@xcite all the samples preserve the zinc - blende crystal structure .",
    "the xas measurements were carried out at the dragon high - resolution soft - x - ray beam line@xcite at the national synchrotron light source , brookhaven national laboratory .",
    "the energy resolution of incoming photon was set to be about 0.5  ev in the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) . before the measurements ,",
    "the single - crystalline sample was cleaved _ in situ _ and the thin - film samples , which had been pre - etched using 1:3 mixture of nh@xmath26oh ( 29  % ) : methanol,@xcite were annealed _ in situ _ at @xmath27c by radiation heating for about three hours.@xcite the measurements were performed at room temperature and the base pressure was maintained below 2@xmath28  torr .",
    "a tetrahedral cluster model calculation , which we have employed to analyse the xas spectra , includes not only the full multiplets of tm 3@xmath0 electrons but also configuration interaction .",
    "the model is characterized by the on - site 3@xmath0 coulomb energy , @xmath29 , the ligand - to-3@xmath0 charge - transfer energy , @xmath30 , and the cation-@xmath0-ligand-@xmath4 hybridization strength @xmath31 .",
    "the initial configuration states are spanned over the ionic ground state @xmath32 and the charge - transferred states , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , where @xmath36 denotes a ligand-@xmath4 hole .",
    "the multiplets of the @xmath37 electron configurations in the charge transferred states are taken into account explicitly while the total symmetry is preserved to be the same as the ionic ground state symmetry .",
    "the 3@xmath0 coulomb exchange interactions are represented by racah parameters , @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "although the racah parameters can vary slightly in different configurations , we imported the values from ref .   and fixed them in all configurations for the sake of simplicity .",
    "the on - site coulomb @xmath40 and the charge transfer energy @xmath41 are treated as control parameters in the calculation and defined with the lowest - energy @xmath37 multiplet states of the corresponding configurations .",
    "similarly , the final states are also spanned over @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath34 , @xmath44 configuration states .",
    "the coulomb energies between the 2@xmath4 core - hole and a 3@xmath0 electron are represented by the 2@xmath4 - 3@xmath0 slater integrals , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 , and the spin - orbit coupling of the @xmath48 core - hole is taken into account with ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "the involved parameter values are borrowed from ref .   and fixed for all configurations .",
    "the slater integrals were scaled down by a reduction factor @xmath50 in order to account for the solid state screenings.@xcite the average coulomb interaction @xmath51 between a tm 2@xmath4 hole and a 3@xmath0 electron is set to be an empirical value of @xmath52 as widely adopted in the core - level spectroscopy studies .",
    "the hybridization interactions are expressed in terms of the slater - koster parameters @xmath53 and @xmath54 : @xmath55 and @xmath56(@xmath57 ) and @xmath58 ( @xmath59 ) are tm-@xmath37 and ligand-@xmath4 orbitals with @xmath60 ( @xmath61 ) symmetry orbitals under @xmath7 tetrahedral point group symmetry , respectively . for simplicity",
    ", we apply the empirical relation @xmath62.@xcite the crystal - field interaction 10@xmath63 is fixed to be 0.25  ev in all the calculations , and the reason will be explained later . here",
    "tm 3@xmath0 spin - orbit coupling is neglected .",
    "it is known that the 3@xmath0 spin - orbit coupling can be quenched when the ground - state orbital symmetry is either @xmath64 or @xmath65@xcite , and indeed , the ground state symmetries of mn@xmath6 , fe@xmath6 , and co@xmath6 ions are @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 under the @xmath7 symmetry , respectively .",
    "the initial ground state is obtained in the modified lanczos method .",
    "then the xas spectra are calculated by the continued fraction expansion.@xcite the calculated spectrum is broadened with a lorentzian function , which accounts for the core - hole lifetime , and finally with a gaussian function for the experimental resolution ( 0.5  ev ) .",
    "the lorentzian broadenings , @xmath69 for @xmath17-edge and @xmath70 for @xmath16-edge spectra are presented in table i.",
    "the calculated tm @xmath3-edge xas spectra for mn@xmath6 , fe@xmath6 , and co@xmath6 ions , which are in a tetrahedral cluster , are presented in figure  2 in comparison with the corresponding experimental xas spectra of zn@xmath1mn@xmath2se  ( @xmath12 ) , zn@xmath1fe@xmath2se  ( @xmath23 ) , and zn@xmath1co@xmath2se  ( @xmath71 ) , respectively .",
    "now the photon energy is presented relative to that of the corresponding main @xmath16 multiplet peak with the highest intensity . in order to investigate the role of configuration interaction ,",
    "the calculation has been performed for the orders of the charge transferred states .    in the zero - th order calculations , which are denoted by @xmath72 , the charge transferred states",
    "are neglected , @xmath73 the ionic calculations .",
    "meanwhile in the @xmath74-th order calculations , denoted by @xmath75 , the charge transferred states are included up to the configuration states with @xmath74 ligand holes , @xmath73 the calculations with the configuration states of @xmath32 , @xmath76 , @xmath34 , @xmath77 for the initial states and the configuration states of @xmath42 , @xmath78 , @xmath34 , @xmath79 for the final states .",
    "the spectra are normalized by the intensity of the @xmath16 main peak . for a given tm ion ,",
    "the same parameter set is employed for the @xmath72 , @xmath34 , the @xmath75 calculations .",
    "when we take into account only the @xmath80 charge transferred states , we find that the calculated spectrum changes considerably from the @xmath72 spectra , especially in the cases of fe@xmath6 and co@xmath6 ions.@xcite but the @xmath81 spectra are nearly the same as the @xmath80 spectra , indicating that the ci effects on the spectrum converge very rapidly .",
    "it is because the energies of the @xmath82 and @xmath83 configuration states already become much higher than those of @xmath76 and the @xmath78 states , due to the strong on - site coulomb interaction .",
    "thus we will consider , from now on , only the result of calculations which include configurations up to @xmath84 and @xmath85 . here",
    "the parameter values are chosen to give the @xmath81 spectra , which agree well with the corresponding experimental ones .    as can be seen in fig .  2 ,",
    "the spectrum is strongly disturbed by ci , especially in high energy region of the main @xmath16 multiplet peak .",
    "the peak separation becomes reduced and the sharp peak structure is smeared out with ci .",
    "although similar trend might be reproduced just by increasing the crystal field splitting 10@xmath63 value without including ci,@xcite we believe ci is essential for proper interpretation of the xas spectra for the following reason .",
    "when we increase the value of 10@xmath63 without including ci , the pre - edge structure is well separated from the main peak and grows rapidly .",
    "at the same time the @xmath17-edge spectrum becomes very complicated except for a co@xmath6 ion,@xcite neither of which is observed in the experimental spectra .",
    "hence , 10@xmath63 value should be small for mn@xmath6 and fe@xmath6 ions but large for a co@xmath6 ion if one fits the experimental spectra without ci .",
    "it is , however , hard to believe that the 10@xmath63 value , which reflects the hybridization strength in the calculation , changes abruptly along this series.@xcite    in the comparison of the calculated spectra with the experimental ones , the agreement is rather good in overall .",
    "but one can still recognize some minor disagreement , which is expected to arise from the uncertainties in slater integrals and spin - orbit coupling parameters and the solid state effects which have been left out in the cluster model .",
    "each final state multiplet may have different lifetime , and thus for the better fit , one should apply an appropriate core - hole - lifetime broadening for each multiplet state .",
    "the solid state effects seem to be rather severe in the spectrum of a co@xmath6 ion , and thus we employed the reduction factor @xmath50 smaller than other tm ions .",
    "the parameter values for the best fit are tabulated in table  1 .",
    "the ligand - to-3@xmath0 charge transfer energy @xmath41 of mn , fe , and co dms s are 5.0 , 3.0 , and 2.5  ev , respectively . here",
    "@xmath41 is defined with respect to the center of the multiplet .",
    "the decreasing behavior of @xmath41 value along the series agrees with the decrease of the difference in the electro - negativity between tm and ligand atoms .",
    "these values are similar to them obtained from the @xmath0-@xmath0 optical - absorption study.@xcite the hybridization parameter @xmath53 are determined to be 1.0 , 0.9 , and 0.8  ev for mn , fe , and co dms s , respectively .",
    "the small decrease of @xmath53 with the increasing atomic number is also consistent with the expected contraction of the 3@xmath0 electron wave function , but these values are somewhat smaller than those obtained from the analysis of photoemssion spectra.@xcite this is probably due to the small reduction of the effective hybridization strength in the xas final states induced by the strong coulomb potential by the localized core orbitals as pointed by gunnarsson and jepsen.@xcite similar behavior is also observed in the analysis of the ni compounds using the anderson impurity model.@xcite      in order to study the details of the hybridization effect , we compared the xas spectra of zn@xmath1mn@xmath2se  and zn@xmath1mn@xmath2te   where different ligands will give variations in the charge - transfer energy @xmath41 and the hybridization interaction @xmath53 .",
    "as can be seen in fig .  1 , the mn @xmath16-edge xas spectrum shows a simple and distinguishable multiplet structure , and thus is very appropriate to study the variation of the hybridization effect .",
    "figure  3 shows the experimental xas spectra of zn@xmath86mn@xmath87se and zn@xmath88mn@xmath89te at the mn @xmath16-edge together with the corresponding calculated ones.@xcite the experimental spectra show four peak structure , a highest intensity peak ( denoted by @xmath64 ) , two high energy peaks at about 1  ev ( denoted by @xmath38 ) and 3.5  ev ( denoted by @xmath39 ) above , and a small pre - edge structure ( denoted by @xmath90 ) , for both compounds .",
    "this structure is mainly originated from the mn 2@xmath913@xmath92 xas final state multiplets of the mn@xmath6 ion .",
    "the spectra display the common multiplet structure , but one can still recognize considerable difference in the relative peak energies and intensities for different ligand - ions . for examples , the relative energy of the peak b is lower for te - ligand ions , while the width of the peak c is narrower for the se - ligand ions . the best fits for the multiplet of these two compounds were obtained with the parameter values of @xmath41 = 5.0  ev and @xmath53 = 1.00  ev for zn@xmath86mn@xmath87se and @xmath41 = 3.8  ev and @xmath53 = 0.90  ev for zn@xmath88mn@xmath89te .",
    "other parameters such as the on - site coulomb interaction @xmath40 and the crystal - field interaction 10@xmath63 are fixed to be 8.0  ev and 0.25  ev , respectively , since they are expected to be hardly affected by the variation of the ligand ions . in the picture ,",
    "@xmath41 and @xmath53 mainly determine the hybridization strength between tm-@xmath0 and ligand-@xmath4 orbitals .    as can be seen in the figure , the calculated spectra show good over all agreement with the experimental ones .",
    "chemical trends of the parameter values are consistent with the electro - negativity of ligand ions and also with the nearest neighbor distances between mn and ligand ions . according to the harrison s scheme,@xcite",
    "the bond - length ( @xmath0 ) dependence of @xmath53 is @xmath93 , but the obtained values yield @xmath94 dependence using a simple central - force model@xcite for the mn - anion bond length .",
    "such a disagreement , which was also observed by larson _",
    "_ , may be attributed to the chemical difference between te and se ions.@xcite the agreement in the region of the second satellite is not as good as the first satellite , especially in zn@xmath88mn@xmath89te .",
    "we suspect that this is probably due to the magnetic interaction between mn@xmath6 ions in this mn - rich compound , which can affect the spectral shape considerably.@xcite    it is worthwhile to understand how the xas spectrum is affected by the parameters @xmath41 and @xmath53 .",
    "4 shows the xas spectra as a function of @xmath41 for a fixed @xmath53 = 1.0  ev in the left panel and the spectra as a function of @xmath53 for a fixed @xmath41 = 4.0  ev in the right panel .",
    "first , the calculation results show that the position of the peak @xmath38 is closer to the peak @xmath64 and its intensity becomes smaller when the hybridization effect increases by decrease of @xmath41 or increase of @xmath53 .",
    "second , the structure @xmath39 in the experimental spectrum seems to be a single peak structure .",
    "however , it turns out to consist of several multiplet states .",
    "third , the pre - edge structure @xmath90 is mainly induced by the crystal - field splitting 10@xmath63 .",
    "this structure is absent at 10@xmath95 but becomes distinguishable for large 10@xmath63-value.@xcite in our parameter set with small 10@xmath63 , the structure @xmath90 is barely recognized as in the experimental results . in practice , it is difficult to determine the exact value of 10@xmath63 from the fitting of xas spectra , and we simply fixed 10@xmath63 = 0.25  ev just enough to show the structure @xmath90 .",
    "xas spectra of various dms s at the tm atom @xmath3 edges are presented and described by a tetrahedral cluster model including full multiplet structure and configuration interaction . due to the strong hybridization between the tm-3@xmath0 and ligand-@xmath4 orbitals , inclusion of ci with reasonable physical parameters",
    "gives much better results than the model without ci .",
    "thus it is important to incorporate ci for understanding of the xas spectra of dms s .",
    "hybridization effects on xas spectra are also investigated varying ligand ions of mn dms s , and the change of the spectral shape is well explained by the cluster model with ci .",

    "<S> the results show that ci is essential to describe the experimental spectra adequately , indicating the strong hybridization between the transition metal 3@xmath0 and the ligand @xmath4 orbitals . in the study of zn@xmath1mn@xmath2y ( y = se , te ) </S>",
    "<S> , we also found considerable spectral change in the mn @xmath3-edge xas spectra for different ligands , confirming the importance of the hybridization effects in these materials . </S>"
