    "since the discovery of pulsars in 1968 @xcite and their interpretation as a rapidly rotating magnetized neutron stars in the same year @xcite , these compact objects are under discussion as powerful accelerators of ultra high energy cosmic ray particles .    from the very beginning of neutron star physics , work on the dynamics of electrically charged particles accelerated in the corresponding electromagnetic fields proceeded on two stages : ( 1 ) test particle dynamics in the vacuum fields of rotating magnets , e.g.  @xcite , demonstrating fundamental mechanisms and ( 2 ) self consistent plasma dynamics , e.g.  @xcite , reproducing certain aspects of the structure and evolution of neutron star magnetospheres .",
    "since then , numerous papers have been published , investigating these matters in great detail , which we will not be able to discuss or even just to mention in this introduction to our present paper .",
    "here we shall concentrate on stage ( 2 ) , on relativistic plasma dynamics in a regime governed by the force ",
    "free surface of a homogeneously magnetized , rapidly rotating sphere with parameters typical for neutron stars .",
    "the notation of a force  free surface ( ffs ) refers to the dynamic of an electrically charged ( test ) particle within given electromagnetic fields . by definition",
    "the ffs is generated by those points of configuration space at which the lorentz  force acting on that particle through given electromagnetic fields vanishes .",
    "while in published literature a particle that happens to be at such a point often referred to as force - free ( ff ) , we prefer  in view of the presence of other types of electromagnetic forces ( radiation reaction forces )  to speak of a lorentz  force  free ( lff ) particle in that situation . if @xmath1 and @xmath2 , denotes the scalar product , @xmath3 $ ] the vector product ] as is the case in fields considered here , a particle is lff for @xmath4 = 0 $ ] , i.e. , for ( i ) @xmath5 and ( ii ) @xmath6 and ( iii ) @xmath7 , { \\mbox{\\boldmath$\\beta$ } } ) = |\\bf{e}^2|$ ] .",
    "@xmath8 is the electric field vector , @xmath9 the vector of the magnetic induction and @xmath10 is the velocity in units of the velocity of light . for @xmath11 , as is the case under premises adopted here , one may expect the second and the third conditions to be inherently fulfilled to some approximation so that the ffs then is caracterized solely by the first condition , @xmath5 .    from the early works of @xcite magnets rotating in the vacuum with the vector of magnetic dipole moment inclined against their respective rotation axis are known to create such ffs , of which some segments can act as particle traps and thus may have strong bearings on the formation of a neutron star magnetosphere , at least within a certain range of distance from its surface .    in what follow",
    ", it will be useful to distinguish the special case of _ aligned rotators _",
    ", i.e.  rotating magnets with the magnetic axis parallel to the rotation axis ( _ parallel rotators _ ) or antiparallel to the rotation axis ( _ antiparallel rotators _ ) , from the general case of _ inclined rotators _ and from rotating magnets with the magnetic axis orthogonal to the rotation axis ( _ orthogonal rotators _ ) . on stage",
    "( 2 ) , a considerable number of investigations has been published on aligned rotators .",
    "some of these papers will be mentioned below .",
    "but only few are devoted to inclined or orthogonal rotators . in the latter case , obviously , considerable formal and numerical complications arise from the lack of rotational symmetry .",
    "analytical approaches were used , for example , by @xcite .    in the special case of aligned rotators , due to axial symmetry",
    ", theoretical results are achieved much easier , even on stage ( 2 ) .",
    "analytical methods have been applied to the structure of the magnetosphere of aligned rotators for example by @xcite .",
    "also , numerical studies on that matter have been performed by @xcite .    on stage ( 1 ) in an earlier work of our group @xcite",
    "the authors have integrated numerically the equation of motion for individual test particles within the regime of the ffs and with no restrictions on the relative orientation of the rotational towards the magnetic axis .",
    "results confirm that velocity components orthogonal to the magnetic field vector are efficiently damped by radiation reaction .",
    "thus , test particles tend to follow magnetic field lines , as suggested earlier by @xcite . in a certain class of orbits",
    "they oscillate about the ffs , while moving along magnetic field lines .",
    "the amplitude of these oscillations decreases through radiation losses .",
    "ultimately , in the subsequent regime of lower energy ( and on a much larger time scale ) particles become subject to drift in azimuthal direction .    on stage ( 2 ) in a second paper of our group @xcite the authors have introduced a numerical iterative approach to reproduce sequences of quasi stable plasma configurations forming under the influence of the ffs . in iterative steps",
    "charged particles were allowed to be ejected from surface elements of the rotating sphere in quantities locally proportional to the magnitude of the electric vector component normal to the respective surface element .",
    "these particles were then allowed to move freely along the appropriate magnetic field lines and to settle down where the projection of the electric onto the magnetic vector vanishes .",
    "thus , _ without making use of the equation of motion _ , co - rotating , quasi stable , charge separated clouds were reproduced , in consistency with earlier results mentioned above .    in our present work",
    "we proceed one step further taking into account in a selfconsistent way virtually _ all effects of relativistic particle dynamics _ , including radiation reaction and effects of special relativity as , for example , retardation .",
    "our numerial approach is designed to describe the evolution of locally averaged particle densities , since velocity dispersion is not taken into account .",
    "again , a magnetosphere is allowed to build up from the initial vacuum through particle ejection from the spherical surface , similar to the procedure described above . here",
    "particles are allowed to be ejected from surface elements , given an appropriate direction of the electric vector , in quantities locally proportional to the magnitude of the electric vector component projected onto the magnetic field line .",
    "thereby , we intend to clearify , on stage ( 2 ) , the evolution , selfconsistent structure and stability properties of plasma configurations forming within the regime of the ffs of a rotating cosmic magnet with no restrictions on the relative orientation of the rotational towards the magnetic axis . also , we want to evaluate mean energy values locally achieved by particles in that regime .    as in earlier works of our group , e.g.  @xcite",
    ", we apply a model represented by a rotating , ideally conducting , homogeneously magnetized sphere with arbitrary inclination of the magnetic against the rotation axis . a standard set of parameters representing well - known properties of typical neutron stars",
    "is attributed to this model : the stellar mass which is taken equal to the solar mass @xmath12 , the stellar radius @xmath13 cm , the angular velocity @xmath14 , and the magnetic dipole moment @xmath15 g @xmath16 .. for the standard set of parameters , the magnetic field strength is about @xmath17 g and the electricic field strength is approximately @xmath18 in the polar region . under given parameter values , the radius of the light ",
    "cylinder ( often referred to as light radius ) @xmath19 , outside of which corotation can not exist , is @xmath20 km , corresponding to almost the radius of the earth , for comparison . ]    in order to investigate the regime of the ffs with an appropriate resolution we concentrate on the near zone of the neutron star up to @xmath21 .    from preceeding estimates as well as from subsequent simulations gravitational forces exerted by the rotating neutron star and by the magnetosphere itself onto individual particles , as well as effects of general relativity",
    "were found to be negligible for the standard set of parameters .",
    "contributions to the lorentz  force originating from magnetic fields created by magnetospheric particle currents can also be neglected , in agreement with earlier conclusions of @xcite .",
    "spontaneous pair creation still turns out to be insignificant , even within the very strong electromagnetic fields of polar regions .",
    "in chapter 2 of what follows , we rediscuss force ",
    "free surfaces associated with rotating magnets .",
    "thereafter , in chapter 3 , we display equations of _ individual _ as well as of _ collective particle motion _ in terms of a non - neutral two - component fluid description , and we then proceed to a description of appropriate tools for numerical treatment in chapter 4 .",
    "results will be given in chapter 5 and subsequently discussed in chapter 6 .",
