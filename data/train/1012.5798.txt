    "donnachie and landshoff ( dl )  @xcite showed that the energy dependence of all hadron - hadron total cross sections can be described by a simple regge motivated form , @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are process - dependent constants , @xmath2 is the hadron - hadron center - of - mass energy , and @xmath11 and @xmath12 are effective powers related to pomeron and reggeon exchange , respectively ( @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) is the pomeron ( reggeon ) trajectory intercept ) .",
    "the @xmath15 dependence on @xmath2 is particularly interesting because of the nature of the photon , which is known to exhibit properties of both a point - like particle ( direct photon ) and a hadron - like state ( resolved photon ) . at the @xmath16 collider hera",
    ", @xmath15 can be extracted from @xmath16 scattering at very low squared momentum transferred at the electron vertex , @xmath17  gev@xmath18 .",
    "the measurements of the total @xmath3 cross section at hera for @xmath19  gev  @xcite combined with measurements at low @xmath2 confirmed that the total photoproduction cross section has a @xmath2 dependence similar to that of hadron - hadron reactions .",
    "however , the hera measurements systematic uncertainties were too large for a precise determination of the @xmath2 dependence of the cross section .",
    "the original fits of dl gave @xmath20 and no uncertainties were determined .",
    "cudell et al .",
    "@xcite determined @xmath6 to be @xmath21 .",
    "however , only very few points were present for the highest center - of - mass energies .",
    "the data were from different experiments and had a large spread .",
    "furthermore , the value of the pomeron intercept comes out strongly correlated with that of the reggeon trajectories . in another evaluation",
    "@xcite , the authors give the range of 0.070.10 as acceptable values for @xmath6 .    in the final months of operation",
    ", the hera collider was run with constant nominal positron energy , and switched to two additional proton energies , 460 gev and 575 gev , lower than the nominal value of 920 gev .",
    "this opened up the possibility to determine precisely the power of the @xmath2 dependence of @xmath15 from zeus data alone , in the range 194296 gev by measuring the ratios of cross sections , thus having many of the systematic uncertainties canceling out .",
    "the difficulty in measuring total cross section , @xmath22 , in a collider environment originates from the limited acceptance of collider detectors for certain class of processes , in particular for elastic and diffractive scattering , where the final state particles are likely to disappear down the beam - pipe .",
    "the determination of the acceptance relies on monte carlo simulation of the physics and of the detector .",
    "the simulation of the physics is subject to many uncertainties which then impact on the systematic uncertainty of the cross section measurement . for the energy dependence of @xmath22",
    ", the impact of these uncertainties as well as of the geometrical uncertainties can be minimized by studying the ratio @xmath23 of cross sections probed at different @xmath2 values .    assuming @xmath24  @xcite , @xmath25 experimentally , @xmath26 where @xmath9 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the acceptance , luminosity and number of measured events , respectively , and therefore @xmath29 where the index 1(2 ) denotes measurements performed at @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "the acceptance for @xmath3 events at hera depends mainly on the detector infrastructure in the positron ( rear ) direction . if the change in the @xmath2 value results from changing the proton energy , the acceptance is likely to remain the same , independently of @xmath2 , and the ratio of acceptances will drop out of formula  ( [ acc ] ) .",
    "the photon - proton total cross section can be measured in the process @xmath32 , where the interacting photon is almost real . the event kinematics may be described in terms of lorentz - invariant variables : the photon virtuality , @xmath33 , the event inelasticity , @xmath34 , and the square of the photon - proton center - of - mass energy , @xmath2 , defined by @xmath35 where @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the four - momenta of the incoming positron , scattered positron and incident proton , respectively , and @xmath39 .",
    "these variables can be expressed in terms of the experimentally measured quantities @xmath40 where @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the energies of the incoming positron , scattered positron and incident proton , respectively , @xmath45 is the positron scattering angle with respect to the initial positron direction and @xmath46 is the positron mass .",
    "the scattered positron was detected in a positron tagger close to the beam line , restricting @xmath45 ( and hence @xmath33 ) to small values .",
    "the photon virtuality ranged from the kinematic minimum , @xmath47  gev@xmath18 , up to @xmath48  gev@xmath18 , determined by the acceptance of the positron tagger .    the @xmath3 cross - section can be determined from the measured number of @xmath1 events using the following formula :    @xmath49\\sigma^{\\gamma p}_{\\rm tot}(y)\\ , , \\label{gammapxsec}\\ ] ]    where @xmath50 is the electromagnetic coupling constant .",
    "the term multiplying the @xmath3 cross - section in known as the flux factor .    for each of the incident proton energies",
    ", @xmath51 has a small variation as a function of @xmath34 over the range of the measurement and may be taken to be a constant , @xmath52 .",
    "thus , the flux may be integrated over the range of measurement to give a total flux @xmath53 , which , when multiplied by the total @xmath3 cross section gives @xmath54 , the ep cross section integrated over the measured range , @xmath55",
    "in the final days of hera running , 27.5 gev positrons were colliding with protons of energy set at the nominal value of 920 gev ( high energy run , her ) and lowered to 575 ( medium energy run , mer ) and 460 gev ( low energy run , ler ) .",
    "the zeus detector components used in this analysis are the main calorimeter ( cal ) that consisted of three parts : the forward ( fcal ) , the barrel ( bcal ) and the rear ( rcal ) calorimeters , the central tracking detector ( ctd ) , the microvertex detector ( mvd ) , the six meter tagger ( tag6 ) and the luminosity monitoring system .",
    "the tag6 was a spaghetti type calorimeter located 5.7  m from the interaction point in the backward direction and was used for tagging photoproduction events .",
    "scattered positrons were bent into it by the first hera dipole and quadrupole magnets after the interaction region , with full acceptance for positrons with zero transverse momentum in the approximate energy range 3.87.1 gev with a @xmath34 range of 0.740.86 .",
    "the luminosity collected in the zeus detector was determined by two independent systems , the photon calorimeter ( pcal ) and the spectrometer ( spec ) , that measured the rate of the bethe - heitler ( bh ) process ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "the pcal was shielded from primary synchrotron radiation by two carbon filters , each approximately two radiation lengths deep .",
    "each filter was followed by an aerogel cherenkov detector ( aero ) to measure the energy of showers starting in the filters .",
    "the two components ( pcal and spec ) enabled the measurement of the luminosity in two independent ways with 1@xmath57 relative uncertainty . a schematic layout of the detector is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lumiline ] .",
    "a special photoproduction trigger was implemented , requiring a low - angle scattered positron candidate detected in the tag6 and some activity in rcal . to reduce the background from events with energy in rcal and a tag6 hit caused by a random coincidence with a bh event in the same hera bunch , the energy in the pcal , @xmath58 ,",
    "was restricted to @xmath59 14 gev .",
    "the pythia 6.416  @xcite generator , coupled to the heracles 4.6  @xcite program ( to simulate electromagnetic radiative effects ) , was used to simulate the photoproduction processes in the proper weight to describe the cal energy distributions in the total - cross - section data .",
    "the acceptance for @xmath3 events is determined by the acceptance of the tag6 and that of the main detector , which are independent .",
    "the above mentioned simulation was used to calculate the acceptance of the rcal for photoproduction processes .",
    "clean positron hits in the tag6 were selected by requiring that the highest - energy cell was not at the edge of the detector .",
    "showers from inactive material in front of the tagger were rejected by a cut on the energy sharing among towers surrounding the tower with highest energy .",
    "the position of the positron was reconstructed by a neural network trained on an mc simulation of the tag6  @xcite .",
    "the neural - network method was also used to correct the energy of the positrons for a small number of noisy cells , which were excluded .",
    "events from the bh process , selected by requiring a positron in the tag6 in coincidence with a photon in the spec , were used to calibrate the tag6 with positrons with very small transverse momentum .",
    "the energy , @xmath60 , was determined as a function of the horizontal position , @xmath61 , and the correlation between @xmath61 and the vertical position , @xmath62 , was also measured .",
    "cuts were placed on @xmath63 and @xmath64 for the photoproduction events to reject positrons with transverse momentum @xmath65 mev , off - momentum beam positrons , and background from beam - gas interactions  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath66 distribution of positrons from a sample of bh events from the mer , and the @xmath64 cuts , are shown in the inset in fig .",
    "[ fig : lumiline ] .    in rcal , the towers immediately horizontally adjacent to the beam - pipe hole had a large rate from off - momentum beam positrons and debris from beam - gas interactions which satisfied the trigger conditions . in events in which the rcal cell with highest energy was in one of these towers ,",
    "the fraction of total rcal energy , @xmath67 , in that tower was required to be below an @xmath67-dependent threshold  @xcite .",
    "this eliminated most of the background and resulted in only about 2.9% loss of signal events .",
    "background from positron beam - gas interactions passing the trigger requirement was determined from non - colliding hera positron bunches .",
    "this sample was subtracted statistically from the colliding hera bunches by the ratio of currents of @xmath16 bunches to @xmath68-only bunches .",
    "photoproduction events associated with the tag6 hit could have a random coincidence with an event in the same hera bunch from the bh process , with the bh photon depositing more than 14 gev in the pcal and therefore vetoing the event . to account for this loss , accepted events",
    "were weighted by a factor determined from the rate of overlaps at the time the event was accepted .",
    "the fraction of overlaps is proportional to the instantaneous luminosity , which was higher during the her relative to the ler and mer .",
    "the correction for this effect was @xmath69% for the her and @xmath70% for the ler and mer data samples .",
    "another background came from photoproduction events outside the @xmath2 range of the tag6 but satisfying the rcal trigger , with a random coincidence from bh hitting the tag6 .",
    "the photon from the bh event may not have been vetoed by the @xmath71 gev requirement due to the limited acceptance and resolution of the pcal .",
    "such overlaps were studied using the distribution of the energy of the pcal+aero ; this offered greatly improved photon energy resolution over the pcal alone .",
    "in addition to the bh events which produced a tag6 hit , this spectrum also contained photoproduction events associated with the tag6 hit overlapping in the same hera bunch with a photon from a random bh event whose positron did not hit the tag6 .",
    "the number of overlaps seen in the pcal , corrected for the pcal acceptance , was the number of bh overlaps to subtract from the selected photoproduction sample .",
    "the total photon - proton cross section for one proton energy is given by @xmath72 where @xmath28 is the measured number of events , @xmath73 is the integrated luminosity , @xmath74 is the fraction of the photon flux tagged by the tag6 , and @xmath75 is the acceptance of the hadronic final state for tagged events .",
    "the acceptance of the detector for all three energy settings was found to be equal within errors and thus their ratio cancels .",
    "the data taken correspond to a luminosity of 567 nb@xmath76 in the her , 949 nb@xmath76 in the mer and 912 nb@xmath76 in the ler .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : wdep ] the measured relative values of @xmath52 are shown as a function of @xmath2 , where the cross section for her is normalized to unity .",
    "a fit of the form @xmath77 was performed to the relative cross sections using only the statistical uncertainties , and separately with all the uncorrelated systematic uncertainties added in quadrature .",
    "the correlated shifts were then applied to the data and the fit repeated ; the change in @xmath6 was negligible .",
    "the result for the logarithmic derivative in @xmath78 of the energy dependence is @xmath79      in the picture in which the photoproduction cross section is @xmath80 as required by the froissart bound  @xcite , @xmath81 is expected , in agreement with the present measurement .",
    "the interpretation of this result in terms of the pomeron intercept is subject to assumptions on the reggeon contribution in the relevant @xmath2 range .",
    "the most recent analysis of all hadronic cross sections using a fit taking into account pomeron and reggeon terms  @xcite yielded a pomeron intercept of 0.0959 @xmath7 0.0021 .",
    "this is in agreement with the result presented here .",
    "dependence of the total photon - proton cross section , normalized to the value for the her .",
