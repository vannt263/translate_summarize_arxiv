    "estimation of corporate default probability is of central importance in credit risk management and pricing .",
    "while bankruptcy forecasting has been the subject of active research for decades @xcite , the relationship between observed corporate default data and the stochastic dynamics of firm value remains indirectly explored .",
    "this is due , in part , to the historical development of the two major research programs in this area .",
    "one program can be characterized as originating with the z - score of altman @xcite and zeta model of altman and colleages @xcite where a credit score is developed as a linear function of explanatory accounting variables .",
    "while this approach has been successful in predicting bankruptcy and is not inconsistent with what one might expect given the focus of rating agencies on such financial ratios @xcite , its linear deterministic structure provides limited insight into the stochastic dynamics of the corporate default behavior .",
    "the other major research program began with the work of merton @xcite who applied a contingent - claims approach @xcite to the calculation of corporate bond spreads .",
    "although this approach is explicitly stochastic , it fails to predict some key features of corporate bond spreads - the magnitude of the observed spread in general and the finite value of the observed spread in the zero - tenor limit of the yield curve in particular - indicating that corporate bond spread dynamics are driven only partially by corporate default dynamics @xcite .",
    "thus , while extensions of merton s model ( e.g.  @xcite ) that typically involve multiple stochastic processes can reproduce bond spreads , they provide limited direct information regarding the stochastic dynamics of firm value . nevertheless , the success these models and of commercial products based on proprietary stochastic models of default such as kmv s creditmonitor@xmath1 @xcite , j.p .",
    "creditmetrics@xmath1 @xcite , and moody s public firm risk model @xcite provide compelling evidence in support of the usefulness of a stochastic approach to explaining default dynamics .",
    "the purpose of our paper is to show that a simple stochastic model of corporate default dynamics implicit in the bond indenture work of black and cox @xcite yields a straightforward analytic expression for the cumulative default probability that provides a remarkably good description of the cumulative default rates published by standard and poor s .",
    "the empirical analysis of corporate default dynamics is complicated by the comparatively rare nature of the corporate default event .",
    "fortunately , a variety of financial institutions including rating agencies monitor and collect default data and have compiled cumulative default probabilities .",
    "the challenge posed to an analytic description of corporate default is illustrated in figure  [ fig : abc ] where we present the cumulative default probability as a function of time for aaa , bbb , and ccc rated companies published by standard and poor s @xcite .",
    "the aaa data denoted by the diamonds is roughly convex for all time less than 10 years . beyond 10 years",
    "there are no observed defaults and the cumulative default probability is constant .",
    "the ccc data denoted by the triangles are quite different with a concave function for all time .",
    "the bbb data show characteristics of both aaa and ccc : convex for short times and concave for long times .",
    "furthermore we see that in passing from aaa to ccc the cumulative default probabilities change by an order of magnitude .",
    "to describe this default behavior we develop an analytic expression based on the structural model of black and cox @xcite in sec .",
    "[ sec : theory ] and apply it to the observed default data published by standard and poor s @xcite in sec .  [",
    "sec : application ] .",
    "our analysis will demonstrate that a single variable in the analytic formula provides effective discrimination between various credit ratings and that this variable is similar to the initial  distance to default \" discussed by crosbie @xcite .",
    "we conclude this paper in sec .",
    "[ sec : summary ] .",
    "the basis of a simple stochastic model of time - dependent and credit - rating - dependent default probability appeared years ago in the work of black and cox @xcite where they presented a theoretical analysis of bond indenture provisions that , among other things , examined the effect of safety covenants on the value and behavior of corporate securities .",
    "they proposed a simple model of corporate capital structure where the value of the firm @xmath2 would vary through time until it hit a prescribed level .",
    "once @xmath2 reached the prescribed level indenture agreements would specify that the firm be reorganized .",
    "such indenture agreements clearly impact the value of bonds and other corporate securities as demonstrated by black and cox .",
    "their work also , however , contains the basis for a stochastic model of bankruptcy .",
    "the model begins with the now common assumption that a corporation is represented as an asset with a market value , @xmath2 , and that , while the return of the asset is uncertain because of various risks associated with the business , it is lognormally distributed , namely , @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the constant drift and volatility of the asset value , @xmath6 denotes time , and @xmath7 is a standard brownian motion . following black and cox @xcite we also assume that when the asset value falls to a prescribed level denoted by @xmath8 the company defaults . transforming to the normalized variable @xmath9 , defined by @xmath10 and , using ito s lemma , we have that @xmath11 where @xmath12 .",
    "the default level now becomes @xmath13 . since @xmath9 is a measure of",
    "how far the firm is from the default level , it has a natural interpretation as the distance to default discussed by crosbie @xcite . given the initial value @xmath14 , we can calculate the expected cumulative default probability @xmath15 from the first - passage time probability @xcite @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the cumulative normal distribution function . and their eq .",
    ". there is , indeed a direct correspondence that can be derived by taking their reorganization boundary to be independent of time and noting that their eq .",
    "7 is for the probability that the firm has not defaulted while our eq .",
    "[ eq : cd ] is for the probability that the firm has defaulted . ]",
    "the model for ratings - based default embodied by this expression can be interpreted as follows . when a firm is initially rated ( @xmath18 )",
    "it will be @xmath14 standard deviations away from default .",
    "as time passes ( @xmath19 ) the company s credit state , buffeted by the vaguaries of the economic environment , diffuses with drift @xmath20 and unit volatility .",
    "should the firm s fortunes evolve such that @xmath9 becomes zero , it encounters the absorbing boundary of default .",
    "we now consider whether this model can describe observed default behavior .",
    "there are two parameters in eq .",
    "[ eq : cd ] , @xmath14 and @xmath20 , that can be varied to fit the observed default probabilities for each rating . as an example of how this expression can be used to represent observed default behavior we consider the published static pool average cumulative default probabilities for each credit rating given by standard & poor s @xcite shown in table [ tab : obs ] .",
    "these values represent the probability of default as a function of time following the _ initial _ rating of the company .",
    "for example , while a company that was initially rated bbb may undergo any number of rating changes over time , once it defaults it is treated in this analysis as being a bbb default .",
    "it can be seen that for each rating the change in the cumulative default probability slows ( and in some cases ceases ) around 10 years , reflecting the fact that few defaults ( and in some cases no defaults ) have been observed beyond 10 years .",
    "this , as discussed below , is most likely due to the limitation of the sample sizes available .",
    "consequently , we used data from the first 8 years for each rating to fit eq .",
    "[ eq : cd ] .",
    "the parameters @xmath14 and @xmath20 were obtained by minimizing the sum of the squared difference between the observed default behavior shown in table [ tab : obs ] and the calculated values obtained from eq .",
    "[ eq : cd ] subject to the constraint that the long - time cumulative default probability , @xmath21 $ ] , be ordered as expected ( i.e. @xmath22 ) .",
    "this multidimensional minimization was effected using the generalized reduced gradient ( grg2 ) nonlinear optimization solver in microsoft excel@xmath23 .",
    "the fitted default probabilities using eq .",
    "[ eq : cd ] and the parameters @xmath14 and @xmath20 resulting from the fitting procedure just described are shown in table 2 .",
    "the result of this fit for non - investment grade credits is shown in table [ tab : calc ] and figure [ fig : nig ] .",
    "the fit to the ccc credit data illustrates the rather good ability of this 2-parameter model to describe the default behavior over the entire 15 year horizon based on a fit to only the first 8 years of data .",
    "the concave nature of the data is well reproduced by eq .",
    "[ eq : cd ] as is the substantial slowing of default probability accumulation beyond 10 years .",
    "a similarly good description of b credits is seen in this figure .",
    "we see also that bb behavior is more linear with respect to time than that of b or ccc for horizons less than 5 years and that the model is able to follow this as well as the more concave behavior between 5 and 13 years . beyond 13 years",
    "there are no observed defaults and",
    "the cumulative default probability is that same from year 13 to year 15 because of this .",
    "the model , however , continues to rise gradually indicating that the lack of observed defaults is , likely , due to a limited sample size and that , in time , we can expect to see more defaults in this area .",
    "financially , there is nothing special about the 13@xmath24 year after a bb rating that would account for the observed sudden lack of defaults .",
    "the result of our fit for investment grade credits is shown in table [ tab : calc ] and figure [ fig : ig ] .",
    "the bbb credits shown in this figure illustrate an interesting qualitative change in default behavior : the short horizon data are _ convex _ in time .",
    "the intermediate horizon data are linear in time and the longer horizon data are concave .",
    "we see that our simple 2-parameter model provides a very reasonable description of the data .",
    "the cumulative default behavior a credits is a challenge to the model .",
    "the model clearly tracks the observed data well between 1 and 8 from years and 11 to 15 years , but an accumulation of defaults in the 8 to 11 year time frame results in a substantial offset between the observed and the calculated data in the 11 to 15 year region .",
    "one solution is to fit over the 1@xmath25 10 years . while this is perfectly reasonable and most people using such a model to fit their data",
    "would likely do so , we felt it useful to see how far we could get using a uniform time range for fitting purposes . for aa and",
    "aaa credit default behavior we see good fits to observations over the 1@xmath25 8 years and reasonable extrapolations with significant deviations coinciding with the point at which the cumulative default data stop changing due to lack of observed defaults .",
    "the coefficients of eq  [ eq : cd ] , @xmath14 and @xmath26 , that resulted from the fitting procedure that generated figures [ fig : nig ] and [ fig : ig ] are shown as a function of credit rating in figure [ fig : coeff ] .",
    "the squares correspond to the fitted values of @xmath14 and the circles correspond to the fitted values of @xmath20 .",
    "this graph demonstrates the intuitively expected result that the better the credit rating the larger the initial distance to default . recalling from our earlier discussion that the distance to default is measured in standard deviations",
    ", we see that the average aaa company is initially about 5.5 standard deviations from default , the average bbb company is initially about 4 standard deviations from default , and the average ccc company is initially about 1 standard deviation from default .",
    "the normalized drift , @xmath20 , resulting from the fitting procedure that generated figures [ fig : nig ] and [ fig : ig ] is remarkable in that , while each credit was fit individually , the normalized drifts are quite similar",
    ". this similarity prompted us to explore the results that would follow if @xmath20 was assumed _ a priori _ to be the same for all credits .",
    "the results of a global fit with this restriction are shown as diamonds in figure [ fig : coeff ] where we see the initial distance - to - default @xmath14 as a function of credit .",
    "this analysis also found that @xmath27 : shown as a horizontal line in figure [ fig : coeff ] . comparing the @xmath14 for constant and variable drift we see that setting @xmath20 constant across credits has essentially no impact on @xmath14 for the lower credits and has a minor impact on the higher credits . that the default dynamics of all credits can be represented by a single value of @xmath20 implies that differences in cumulative default behavior among various ratings are driven almost exclusively by the initial distance to default @xmath14 .",
    "modeling the default process as a first - passage time yields a simple expression for the mean time to default : @xmath28 . comparing the results of this expression with those reported by standard and poor s in table [ tab : mtd ] .",
    "the deviation between the calculated and observed results reflects the lack of observed default at longer tenors .",
    "however , for the same reason that we would expect the longer - tenor cumulative default probability for the aa and aaa credits to increase over time , so too do we expect the mean time to default to increase over time for investment - grade credits .",
    "comparing observed corporate cumulative default probabilities to those calculated using a stochastic model based on an extension of the work of black and cox @xcite , we find that corporations default as if via diffusive dynamics .",
    "the model , based on a contingent - claims analysis of corporate capital structure , yields a single analytic expression for corporate default behavior that is calibrated easily with historical default probabilities .",
    "we used this model to analyze the observed default data published by standard and poor s @xcite and found that a single variable in the analytic formula provides effective discrimination between various credit ratings .",
    "this variable is quite similar to the  distance to default \" described by crosbie @xcite and provides an attractive interpretation of the default process in terms of the bond indenture provision analysis of black and cox @xcite . despite its simple underpinnings , the model is remarkably successful in describing the cumulative default rates published by standard and poor s @xcite .",
    "this implies that the capital structure of corporations , despite their differences , map onto the simple  effective \" capital structure given in the merton model .",
    "the ability to represent observed default behavior by a single analytic expression and to differentiate credit - rating - dependent default behavior with a single variable recommends this model for a variety of risk management applications including the mapping of bank default experience to public credit ratings .",
