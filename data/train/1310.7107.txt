    "the nuclear shell model , a sophisticated theory based on the configuration interaction method , has been one of the central theoretical tools for understanding a wealth of data from nuclear structure experiments . due to the rapid growth in the dimensionality of the hilbert space with increasing degrees of freedom , we have to work within a reduced hilbert space , the so - called model space .",
    "accordingly , we use an effective interaction which is tailored to the chosen model space .",
    "this effective interaction forms an essential input to all shell - model studies .",
    "equipped with modern sophisticated effective interactions , the shell model has successfully described many properties of nuclei .",
    "there are two main approaches to determine effective interactions for the nuclear shell model .",
    "one is based on fitting two - body matrix elements to reproduce observed experimental data .",
    "this approach is widely used in nuclear structure studies , and has been rather successful in reproducing properties of known nuclei and in predicting not yet measured properties of nuclei .",
    "the other approach is to _ derive _ the effective interaction using many - body theories , starting from bare nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) interactions .",
    "although the first approach has been widely used with great success  @xcite , the main goal of effective interaction theory is to construct and understand such sophisticated effective interactions starting from the underlying nuclear forces and so - called _ ab initio _ or first principle many - body methods .",
    "most microscopic effective interactions , except for those used in no - core shell - model studies  @xcite , are based on many - body perturbation theory ( see for example ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "the situation , however , is far from being satisfactory . in spite of several developments in many - body perturbation theory ,",
    "many properties of nuclei are still awaiting a proper microscopic description and understanding .",
    "a standard approach to derive a microscopic effective interactions for the shell model , is provided by many - body perturbation theory and the so - called folded diagrams  @xcite approach .",
    "two widely used approaches are the kuo - krenciglowa ( kk )  @xcite and the lee - suzuki ( ls )  @xcite schemes .",
    "these approaches , however , are feasible only with degenerate perturbation theory and are thereby constrained to a model space consisting of typically one major oscillator shell .",
    "this poses a strong limitation on the applicability of the theory .",
    "many unstable nuclei require at least two or more major oscillator shells for a proper theoretical description .",
    "for example , the physics of nuclei in the so - called island of inversion is currently explained with empirical effective interactions , see for example ref .",
    "@xcite , defined for a model space consisting of the @xmath0-shell and the @xmath1-shell .",
    "it is therefore absolutely necessary to establish a microscopic theory that allows us to construct an effective interaction for the model spaces composed of several oscillator shells , starting from realistic nuclear forces .",
    "recently , the kk and the ls methods have been extended to the non - degenerate model spaces  @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we present the extended kk ( ekk ) method in many - body systems , which allows us to construct a microscopic effective interaction for several shells .",
    "we shall see that our theory is a natural extension of the well - known folded - diagram theory of kuo and his collaborators ( see for example refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "this article is structured as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : theory ] , we briefly explain the concept of the effective interaction in a given model space . in secs .",
    "[ sec : formal ] and [ sec : mb ] , we explain our ekk theory for effective interactions .",
    "we discuss in some detail the difference between the ekk method and the conventional kk approach which applies to degenerate model spaces only . in sec .",
    "[ sec : test ] we present test calculations and discussions .",
    "here we construct effective interactions for the nuclear shell model in a single - major shell ( @xmath0-shell , @xmath1-shell ) and also in two major shells ( @xmath2-shell , @xmath3-shell ) .",
    "we then calculate energy levels of several nuclei that have two valence nucleons on top of a closed - shell core . we demonstrate that our method establishes one possible way to reliably compute microscopic effective interactions for model spaces composed of several major oscillator shells . in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] we give a brief conclusion and a summary .",
    "in this section we review briefly the formalism for deriving an effective interaction using many - body perturbation theory .",
    "suppose we describe a quantum system by the following hamiltonian @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the unperturbed hamiltonian and @xmath6 is the perturbation . in a hilbert space of dimension @xmath7",
    ", we can write down the many - body schrdinger equation as @xmath8 in shell - model calculations , however , the dimension @xmath7 of the hamiltonian matrix increases exponentially with the particle number , limiting thereby the applicability of direct diagonalization procedures to the solution to eq .  .    in this situation , we introduce a @xmath9-space ( model space ) of a tractable dimension @xmath10 that is a subspace of the large hilbert space of dimension @xmath7 .",
    "correspondingly , we define the projection operator @xmath9 onto the @xmath9-space , and @xmath11 onto its complement .",
    "we require that the projection operators @xmath9 and @xmath12 commute with the unperturbed hamiltonian @xmath5 , @xmath13=[q , h_0]=0.\\ ] ]      we start our explanation by introducing an energy - dependent effective hamiltonian . by use of the projection operators @xmath9 and @xmath12 , we can express eq .   in the following partitioned form @xmath14",
    ": @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the projection of the true eigenstate @xmath17 onto the @xmath9-space",

    "for @xmath18 as @xmath19 where we have introduced the following bloch - horowitz effective hamiltonian @xmath20 defined purely in the @xmath9-space @xmath21 note that eq .   requires a self - consistent solution , because @xmath22 depends on the eigenenergy @xmath23 .",
    "this is not a desirable property for the shell - model calculation , and therefore we adopt the energy - independent approach below .",
    "next we introduce the energy - independent effective hamiltonian in the @xmath9-space .",
    "we first choose @xmath24 eigenstates @xmath25 among @xmath7 solutions of eq .  , with @xmath10 .",
    "then we require that @xmath26 , the @xmath9-space component of the chosen @xmath24 eigenstates , be described by the @xmath24-dimensional effective hamiltonian @xmath27 as @xmath28    the energy - independent effective hamiltonian @xmath27 can be obtained by considering the following similarity transformation of the hamiltonian @xmath29 : @xmath30 by construction , the transformed hamiltonian , @xmath31 , gives the same eigenenergies as the original hamiltonian @xmath29 .",
    "the corresponding eigenstates @xmath32 , however , are transformed into @xmath33 .",
    "we require therefore that the second relation in eq .  ,",
    "@xmath34 , satisfies @xmath35 , that is , the transformation does not change the @xmath9-space component @xmath36 of the eigenstates .",
    "our next step includes the determination of @xmath37 . the most convenient way to determine",
    "@xmath37 is by using the following equation @xmath38 which decouples the @xmath9-space part in the transformed schrdinger equation .",
    "this means that the @xmath9-space part of the transformed hamiltonian , @xmath39 , is nothing but @xmath27 in eq .  .",
    "then the effective hamiltonian and the effective interaction can be written as @xmath40 we note here that @xmath27 is energy - independent .",
    "furthermore , the derivation of @xmath27 requires the determination of @xmath37 in order to satisfy eq .  .",
    "the decoupling equation , being nonlinear , can be solved by iterative methods , to give @xmath27 and @xmath41 of eq .  .",
    "we first explain the kk method  @xcite for the degenerate model space , and then turn to the ekk method  @xcite for the non - degenerate model space .",
    "both methods eliminate the energy - dependence of @xmath42 of eq .   by introducing the so - called @xmath43-box and its energy derivatives , resulting in an energy - independent effective interaction @xmath27 .      in the kk method",
    ", we assume a degenerate model space , @xmath44 .",
    ".   reads @xmath45 one way to solve this non - linear equation is to write it in the following iterative form : @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 stand for @xmath49 and @xmath41 in the @xmath50-th step , respectively .",
    "then we immediately arrive at the following iterative formula for @xmath51 : @xmath52 where we have defined @xmath43-box and its derivatives as follows : @xmath53 in the limit of @xmath54 , eq .",
    "gives @xmath55 , if the iteration converges .",
    "we stress here that the above kk method can only be applied , by construction , to a system with a degenerate unperturbed model space that satisfies @xmath44 .",
    "it can not be applied , for instance , to obtain the effective interaction for the model space composed of the @xmath0-shell and the @xmath1-shell .",
    "the extended kuo - krenciglowa ( ekk ) method is designed to construct an effective hamiltonian @xmath27 for non - degenerate model spaces  @xcite .",
    "we first rewrite eq .   as @xmath56 where @xmath57 is a shifted hamiltonian obtained by the introduction of the energy parameter @xmath58 .",
    "equation   plays the same role in the ekk method as eq .",
    "does in the kk method . by solving eq .",
    "iteratively as in the kk method , we obtain the following iterative scheme to calculate the effective hamiltonian @xmath27 , @xmath59 where @xmath60 and @xmath61 stands for @xmath62 at the @xmath50-th step . the effective hamiltonian @xmath27 is obtained as @xmath63 , and satisfies @xmath64 the effective interaction , @xmath41 , is then calculated by eq .",
    "( [ eq : def_veff ] ) as @xmath65 .",
    "let us now compare the ekk and the kk methods .",
    "first , and most importantly , the above ekk method does not require that the model space be degenerate .",
    "it can , therefore , be applied naturally to a valence space composed of several shells .",

    "equation   is interpreted as the taylor series expansion of @xmath62 around @xmath68 , and changing @xmath58 corresponds to shifting the origin of the expansion , and therefore to a re - summation of the series .",
    "this explains why the left hand side of eq .",
    "is independent of @xmath58 , while each term on the right hand side depends on @xmath58 .",
    "this in turn means that we can tune the parameter @xmath58 in eq .   to accelerate the convergence of the series on the right hand side , a feature which we will exploit in actual calculations",
    "[ sec : mb ] for the purpose of obtaining the effective interaction for the shell model , we need to apply the formal theory of the effective interaction in sec .  [ sec : formal ] to nuclear many - body systems . in sec .",
    "[ sec : kk_mb ] , we explain the standard kuo - krenciglowa ( kk ) theory in a many - body system . its diagrammatic expression can be established both in time - dependent  @xcite and time - independent  @xcite perturbation theory , and is conveniently summarized by the @xmath43-box expansion in terms of the so - called folded diagrams  @xcite . in sec .",
    "[ sec : ekk_mb ] , we show that @xmath27 in the ekk method has a similar expansion which can also be expressed by folded diagrams  @xcite .      [",
    "sec : model_mb ] our quantum many - body system is described by @xmath69 where @xmath5 is the unperturbed hamiltonian and @xmath6 is the two - body interaction .",
    "we limit ourselves , for the sake of simplicity , to two - body interactions only , although the theory can be extended to include three - body or more complicated nuclear forces .    in specifying single - particle states , we use indices @xmath70 for valence single - particle states ( active single - particle states ) , and @xmath71 and @xmath72 for passive particle and hole single - particle states , respectively . in a generic case",
    ", we use greek indices .    in a many - body system , the @xmath9-space is defined using the valence single - particle states that make up the @xmath9-space .",
    "let us take as an example the nucleus @xmath73 , where we treat @xmath74 as a closed - shell core .",
    "in this case we can define the @xmath9-space by specifying the valence states to be determined by the single - particle states of the @xmath0-shell .",
    "the @xmath9-space is then composed by the @xmath74 closed - shell core plus two neutrons in the @xmath0-shell .    in the following , we derive @xmath27 ( and @xmath41 ) in eq .",
    "( [ eq : def_veff ] ) with the above hamiltonian eq .  , which gives @xmath75 for the many - body system .",
    "[ sec : kk_mb ] here we briefly explain the kk method in a degenerate @xmath9-space . many body perturbation theory ( mbpt )",
    "shows that the effective interaction , @xmath41 , is conveniently written in terms of the so - called folded diagrams as  @xcite @xmath76 where the integral sign represents the folding procedure , and @xmath77 represents @xmath43-box contributions which have at least two nucleon - nucleon interaction vertices .",
    "note that , in order to have a degenerate @xmath9-space energy , @xmath67 , the single - particle energies in eq .   for valence single - particle states ,",
    "@xmath78 are completely degenerate .",
    "equation   is the basis of the perturbative expansion of @xmath41 in the folded diagram theory ( see for example ref .",
    "@xcite for more details ) .",
    "there are two points to be noted here .",
    "first , because we can not evaluate the @xmath43-box defined in eq .   exactly ( which implies including all terms to infinite order ) , we use the following perturbative expansion @xmath79 which we can currently evaluate up to the third order in the nucleon - nucleon interaction .",
    "second , the valence - linked diagram theorem states that we need to retain only the valence - linked part ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : diagram ] ) , i.e. , unlinked parts can be proved to cancel among themselves  @xcite . at the same time , the eigenvalue @xmath80 in eq .",
    "changes its meaning ; it is no longer the total energy of the system , but is now the total energy measured from the true ground state energy of the core .    in actual calculations , however , we do not calculate @xmath41 order by order using eq .  .",
    "since the contribution of folded diagrams can be calculated by energy derivatives when the model space is degenerate  @xcite , we can translate eq .   into the following equation @xmath81",
    "the above expression clearly shows that the iterative solution of eq .",
    "converges @xmath41 in the limit of @xmath54 .    we can summarize the kk method as follows",
    "; we calculate the valence - linked @xmath43-box diagrams ( usually up to second or third order ) and the corresponding energy derivatives at the degenerate @xmath9-space energy @xmath67 , and carry out the iteration of eq .   starting from @xmath82 .",
    "this procedure ultimately gives @xmath55 .",
    "-box diagrams up to second order in @xmath6.,width=188 ]    at the end , we stress again that the above kk method can yield @xmath41 only for a degenerate model space .",
    "suppose we are working with the harmonic oscillator shell model of @xmath73 , treating @xmath74 as the core .",
    "if we take the @xmath9-space composed only of the degenerate @xmath0-shell , the above kk method works well as shown by many applications ( see for example ref .",
    "@xcite ) . if , on the other hand , we take an enlarged @xmath9-space defined by the non - degenerate @xmath2-shell , the kk method breaks down",
    ". a naive calculation of @xmath41 by eq",
    ".   easily leads to divergences of the @xmath43-box , as we shall see later .      here",
    "we derive the effective hamiltonian @xmath27 of the extended kuo - krenciglowa ( ekk ) method , with an emphasis on its similarity with the kk method discussed above .",
    "we consider first the general situation where the energies of the valence single - particle states in @xmath83 are not necessarily degenerate . in this case",
    ", we have to apply the ekk formula eq .   to our many - body systems .",
    "we can easily confirm that , in order to derive eq .  , we need to change the decomposition eq .   of the hamiltonian in the kk method .",
    "suppose we decompose the total hamiltonian into the following unperturbed hamiltonian @xmath84 and the perturbation @xmath85 @xmath86 or in the matrix form , @xmath87 where @xmath88 , and @xmath89 . with the above unperturbed hamiltonian @xmath84 in eq .  , we can treat the @xmath9-space as being degenerate at the energy @xmath58 , and therefore we can follow the derivation of eq .",
    "in the kk method , to achieve @xmath90 which is then converted into @xmath91 note that eqs .   and",
    "are the ekk counterparts of eqs .   and of the kk method .",
    "we can solve eq .",
    "iteratively as done for eq .  .",
    "note that the above derivation of the ekk method is the same as that of the kk method apart from the decomposition of the hamiltonian .",
    "therefore , we need to retain only the valence - linked @xmath43-box diagrams in eqs .   and , as we do for the kk method .",
    "to summarize , all that we have to know is , as in the kk method , the @xmath43-box and its energy derivatives , except that now it is defined at the parameter @xmath58 .",
    "we discuss here how one can accommodate the perturbative expansion of the @xmath43-box in the ekk formalism . for the sake of simplicity",
    ", we will focus on a simple system composed of two particles on top of a closed - shell core in what follows , although the discussion is not restricted to this specific case .",
    "the projection operators @xmath9 and @xmath12 are then given by @xmath92 where @xmath93 stands for the closed - shell core .",
    "to become familiar with our new unperturbed hamiltonian , @xmath84 , we consider some selected examples ; we show first the results from the operation of the new unperturbed hamiltonian , @xmath94 , on some selected many - particle states : @xmath95 the first line is an example of a @xmath9-space state with two single - particle states on top of the closed - shell core , @xmath96 , while the second and third lines result in @xmath12-space examples .",
    "the unperturbed energy of the @xmath9-space state @xmath97 is @xmath58 , while that of a @xmath12-space state @xmath98 results in @xmath99 , a sum of unperturbed single - particle energies .",
    "it is important to get convinced that @xmath100 appears only in the @xmath12-space energy , while @xmath101 appears in all of the above three states .    in the perturbative expansion of @xmath102 in eq .",

    "the general structure of @xmath102 can then be given schematically by @xmath103 where the subscript @xmath104 indicates intermediate states between two interaction vertices .",
    "note that the parameter @xmath58 appears in all the denominators in the ekk method .",
    "let us consider the @xmath43-box diagram shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cp ] as an example .",
    "the diagram is a contribution from the second - order term in eq .  , and gives the following contribution to @xmath102 @xmath105 if we on the other hand employ the kk method in order to calculate the contribution to @xmath106 from fig .",

    "this is a direct consequence of the fact that the ekk formula contains the kk formula as a special case .",
    "second , we can see the problem of divergence of the kk formula applied naively to a non - degenerate model space .",
    "consider the case of @xmath73 as an example , and let the @xmath9-space consist of two major shells ( @xmath111 and @xmath112-shells ) .",
    "then , the denominator of the first line in eq .",
    "vanishes for @xmath113-shell , @xmath114-shell , and @xmath115-shell , leading thereby to a divergence .",
    "the above mechanism is just one of many examples which show that we really need to use the ekk formalism in order to derive effective interactions for model spaces consisting of several shells .",

    "let us start with discussions on the convergence issue ( i ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : ca42 ] shows that the magnitude of the third - order contribution is approximately 30% as large as that of the second - order contribution .",

    "we observe similar patterns to those seen in the neutron - neutron channel of fig .",

    "the agreement with experimental data is rather nice for the @xmath178 states , but we observe a slight overbinding for the @xmath179 state . from the convergence property of the @xmath179 state ,",
    "it is unlikely that fourth - order contributions to the @xmath43-box could play an important role .",
    "several explanations for this discrepancy are possible .",
    "one possibility for this overbinding is that the single particle energies presently used are not fully adequate .",
    "as mentioned above , we have employed the single - particle energies determined from the gxpf1  @xcite interaction .",
    "these energies are the results of a fit together with the two - body interaction to reproduce experimental data .",
    "the experimental data that enter the fitting procedure consist of selected observables from @xmath1-shell nuclei .",
    "since the gxpf1 interaction differs from those derived here , other sets of single - particle energies could have been more appropriate .",
    "another possibility is that our @xmath12-space and order in perturbation theory may not be large enough .",

    "three - body forces @xcite are examples of many - body contributions not studied here .",
    "however , the aim of this work has been to study the recently developed ekk formalism for deriving effective interactions for more than one major shell .",
    "the role of more complicated many - body correlations are the scope of future works .",
    "we have presented a novel many - body theory ( the so - called ekk method ) to calculate the effective interaction @xmath41 for the shell - model calculation that is applicable not only to degenerate model spaces , but also to non - degenerate model spaces .",
    "the method is based on a re - interpretation of the unperturbed hamiltonian and the interacting part .",
    "the final expressions for the effective interactions can be understood as a taylor series expansion of the bloch - horowitz hamiltonian around a newly introduced parameter @xmath58 .",
    "since the change in @xmath58 should not affect the effective interactions @xmath41 , the @xmath58-independence of the numerical results provides us with a sensible test of our framework and the approximations we make in the actual calculations .    in this work ,",
    "we have presented numerical results for the effective two - body nucleon - nucleon interactions @xmath41 , with applications to shell - model calculations of selected nuclei , with and without the contribution from the folded diagrams .",

    "this in turn suggests that the perturbative expansion of the @xmath43-box through third order gives almost converged results .",
    "third , the difference between the ekk method and the kk method with an _ ad hoc _ modification of the unperturbed hamiltonian is significant , especially for inter - shell interactions .",
    "this can have a large impact , for example , on the investigation of neutron - rich nuclei where the degrees of freedom defined by two or more major oscillator shells are important .",
    "finally , we stress that our method has established a robust way to calculate microscopically the effective interaction in non - degenerate model spaces .",
    "these spaces involve typically more than one major oscillator shell .",
