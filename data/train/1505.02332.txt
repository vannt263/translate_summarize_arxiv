    "this paper is devoted to the convergence analysis of the adini element scheme for the fourth order problem in any dimension . the adini element , ( c.f .",
    "@xcite for 2d , @xcite for higher dimension ) is among the earliest finite elements for elliptic problems .",
    "it uses the rectangles ( 2d ) and generalised rectangles ( higher dimensions ) as geometry shapes , and the evaluation and the derivatives of first order on the vertices as nodal parameters .",
    "the generation of stiffness matrix is easy and friendly , and this element has become a popular one during the past half century , and stimulated various works , ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . in this present paper , we discuss the capacity of the adini element scheme for fourth order problems , and present a sharp analysis of the upper and lower bound of the convergence rate in energy and integral norms in arbitrary dimensions .",
    "when used for second order problems , the adini element scheme is a conforming one , and the error analysis is straightforward by the fundamental ca lemma and standard arguments . when used for fourth order problems , however , the adini element is a nonconforming one , and the convergence analysis is more subtle . in wang ,",
    "shi and xu @xcite where they generalised the adini element from 2d to arbitrary dimension , the @xmath3 convergence rate of adini element in any dimension has been proved for fourth order problem . meanwhile",
    ", a higher accuracy of the scheme is still expected and numerically observed . in 2d , it has been proved by lascaux and lesaint @xcite that the finite element solution converges to the exact solution with @xmath1 order in the energy norm , provided the rectangular cells in the grid are all the same . then in 2004 ,",
    "lin and luo @xcite showed the @xmath1 convergence of the adini element without assuming the congruence of the cells of the grid .",
    "later in 2006 , mao and chen @xcite showed further the @xmath1 convergence rate for anisotropic grids .",
    "so far to our knowledge , the sharp analysis of the convergence rate of adini element for fourth order problems in higher dimensions is still absent .    in this paper , we study the convergence rate of the adini element scheme for fourth order problems in higher dimensions . technically , without making a crucial use of the nodal interpolation which was done by ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) and which will bring extra regularity assumption on the exact solution in higher dimension , our analysis relies on the structure of adini element space only .",
    "we figure out the intrinsic symmetry property of the adini element space , and show the @xmath1 energy norm convergence rate in a unified way with respect to the dimensions provided the exact solution belongs to @xmath0 .",
    "there have been works that study high accuracy nonconforming finite element methods for fourth order problems .",
    "several @xmath1 nonconforming finite elements have been constructed in , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "in contrast to these elements , the adini element space does not possess such moment continuities ; the average of the normal derivatives of adini element function is not continuous across the internal faces .",
    "this hints us to make use of a different way by using the symmetric property inside one cell , and moreover , this unusual property makes it hardly possible to make use of the dual argument to obtain higher order convergence rate in @xmath4 or @xmath2 norm . indeed , in the paper",
    ", we further show that the convergence rate in @xmath2 norm can not be non - trivially higher than @xmath1 order .",
    "the analysis of the lower bound of the convergence rate of the adini element scheme in @xmath2 norm is a generalization of hu - shi s work @xcite , which solved an open problem whether the convergent order in @xmath2 norm can always be higher than that in the energy norm .",
    "technically , a decomposition of the residual @xmath5 to a leading term and other higher order terms works crucially , and we estimate the lower bound of the leading term sufficiently .",
    "again , a sharp analysis of the interpolation operator will play a key role .",
    "therefore , by the discrete poincar inequality , we obtain that the convergence rate of the adini element scheme for fourth order problem in energy norm , @xmath4 norm and the integral norm are all of @xmath1 order , and these estimates are all sharp .",
    "the remaining of the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : preliminaries ] , we present some preliminaries of the adini element . in section [ sec : model problem ] , we present the model problem and the adini finite element discretization . in section [ sec : energynorm ]",
    ", we show the @xmath1 order convergence rate in energy norm in any dimension . in section [ sec : l2norm ] , we further show the @xmath1 order convergence in @xmath2 norm in any dimension . in section [ sec : numerical ] , some numerical examples are presented to demonstrate our theoretical results .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : conclusion ] , some conclusions are given .",
    "let @xmath6 be a @xmath7-rectangle , @xmath8 be the barycentre of @xmath9 , and @xmath10 the half length of @xmath9 in @xmath11 direction , @xmath12 .",
    "then the @xmath7-rectangle can be denoted by @xmath13 particularly , the vertices @xmath14 of @xmath9 are denoted by @xmath15 moreover , denote by @xmath16 and @xmath17 the two @xmath18-dimensional faces of @xmath9 without the edges parallel to the @xmath11 axe ; see figure 1 .",
