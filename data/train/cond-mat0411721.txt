    "one of the simplest lattice models for strongly correlated electron systems , the falicov - kimball model ( fkm ) @xcite , consists of two types of spinless electrons , delocalized band ( @xmath3- ) electrons , localized @xmath4-electrons and a local coulomb ( hubbard ) interaction between @xmath3- and @xmath4-electron at the same site .",
    "the fkm hamiltonian reads @xmath5 where @xmath6 denotes the one - particle energy of the @xmath4-electrons , @xmath7 the band center of the @xmath3-electrons , @xmath8 the c - electron hopping between site @xmath9 and @xmath10 and u the coulomb ( hubbard ) correlation .",
    "this model can be interpreted as a simplified version of the one - band hubbard model @xcite where @xmath3 and @xmath4 translates to the label of the different spin orientations , and the hopping term for the @xmath4-spin type is set to zero .",
    "the fkm was originally introduced as a model for metal - insulator and valence transitions @xcite .",
    "it can also be interpreted as a model for crystallization ( identifying the  heavy  @xmath4-particles with the nuclei , the @xmath3-particles with the electrons and for @xmath11 ) @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the fkm is of interest for academic reasons , because it is the simplest , non - trivial lattice model for correlated electron systems , for which certain exact results are available ; for a recent review see ref . .",
    "therefore , the fkm may serve as a test case and benchmark for any many - body method and approximation , because such a method can also be applied to the fkm and comparisons of the approximate and the available exact results may help to judge the value and possible limitations of such many - body techniques .    brandt and mielsch",
    "@xcite solved the fkm exactly in the limit of infinite spatial dimensions , @xmath12 @xcite , by mapping the problem onto an effective single site subject to a complex bath .",
    "thereby , the complex bath field mimics the dynamics of the surrounding electrons on the lattice .",
    "since the local @xmath4-electron number is conserved , @xmath13=0 $ ] , the @xmath3-electron problem is solved independently from the dynamics of the @xmath4-electrons which are static .",
    "however , the presence or absence of an @xmath4-electron on the effective site induces a significant change for the conduction electrons : the presence of an @xmath4-electron switches on an additional scattering potential @xmath14 for the conduction electrons .",
    "brandt and mielsch@xcite were able to derive an exact , explicit expression for the self - energy of the @xmath3-electrons @xmath15 , which is a functional of the local @xmath3-electron green function and the ( fixed ) local @xmath4-electron occupation numbers .",
    "this functional is essentially equivalent to that obtained in the hubbard - iii - approximation of the hubbard model@xcite , i.e. this approximation becomes exact for the @xmath3-electron self - energy of the fkm in the limit @xmath12 .    but",
    "despite the conservation of the @xmath4-electron occupation , the @xmath4-electrons have a highly non - trivial dynamics . for @xmath16",
    "the f - electron spectral function is simply a delta - function , but for finite @xmath14 the spectral function broadens due to the interaction with the fluctuating @xmath3-electrons .",
    "the @xmath4-electron green function @xmath17 of the fkm is much more involved and less trivial than the @xmath3-electron green function @xmath18 , in particular a hubbard - iii - type self - energy functional does not become exact for the @xmath4-electrons . even for large dimensions , where the mapping on an effective impurity problem holds , it is not possible to derive an explicit analytical expression for the @xmath4-electron self - energy functional @xmath19 . on the contrary , the evaluation of @xmath19 is nearly as complicated as the self - energy of the full hubbard model . for @xmath12 , the first explicit numerical evaluation of @xmath20 ( or the @xmath4-electron spectral function @xmath21 , respectively )",
    "was performed by brandt and urbanek@xcite .",
    "they started from a nonequilibrium , keldysh based many - body formalism using a discretization along the kadanoff - baym contour and a subtle analytical continuation to obtain the dependence on real frequency numerically .",
    "only relatively few explicit results were presented in ref . .",
    "therefore , this keldysh based analysis was repeated very recently by freericks et al.@xcite presenting much more explicit results and investigating also the accuracy of the results by checking sum rules and the dependence on the numerical discretization and the cutoff in the time integrals .    on the other hand ,",
    "it is clear that the problem to calculate the @xmath4-electron green function @xmath22 must be related to the x - ray threshold problem , because the creation of a core hole , with which the conduction electrons then interact , is related to the creation of an f - electron at a certain time as pointed out by si _",

    "however , though the relation to the x - ray problem is known , no observations of the characteristic x - ray singularities were made in previous studies of @xmath20 for the fkm .",

    "the spectral function of @xmath20 exhibits a power law @xmath24 divergence for the half - filled homogeneous solution at the chemical potential when @xmath25 .",

    "the imaginary part of the f - electron self - energy vanishes for @xmath166 for small @xmath167 , but it does not follow the standard fermi liquid @xmath141-law , but it vanishes non - analytically , i.e.  one obtains non fermi liquid behavior @xcite , which leads to the power law singularity in @xmath21 . above the metal - insulator transition , @xmath168 and the threshhold @xmath169 being a function of @xmath170",
    "is shifted to a finite energy . at finite temperatures , precursors of the algebraic signularities",
    "are found which are cut of by thermal fluctuations below @xmath171 .",
    "furthermore , the present investigation demonstrates the strength and accuracy of the dmft / nrg method .",
    "it is not only able to resolve low frequency or temperature features with unprecedented accuracy , it is also very efficient numerically requiring only minimal resources and computation time ; typical run - times have been around 2 minutes on a pentium m laptop .",
    "one of us ( g.c . ) thanks jim freericks , veljko zlatic and romek lemanski for numerous , very useful discussions on the fkm and for informations on their recent work on that model , and we thank jim freericks and veljko zlatic for usefull comments on a first preprint version of this manuscript .",
    "we used a slight modification of the algorithm for finite temperature green functions by bulla et .",
    "our algorithm has originally been developed for multi - band models . in this case , collecting all matrix elements which contribute to @xmath172 ( [ eqn_fermionic - lehmann ] ) at each nrg iteration and patching them together as described in fig .",
    "2 of ref .   is not practical in the two - band model : the number of matrix elements exceeds rather rapidly even the memory of modern supercomputers for accurate calculations .",
    "the patching of information from different iterations , however , is a very useful concept since ( i ) it increases the accuracy in combination with ( ii ) producing additional pole positions by shifting the eigenenergies slightly through iteration .",
    "latter helps to mimic a continuum of states .    instead of averaging individual matrix elements for different iterations , we average different @xmath173 for fixed frequency @xmath174 but different iterations @xmath175 .",
    "the basic idea is to combine the method of costi et .",
    "al.@xcite with the algorithm of bulla et .",
    "the eigenstates of iteration @xmath175 represent excitations on an energy scale @xmath176 @xmath177 for each iteration @xmath175 , we define a logarithmic grid interval @xmath178 for @xmath179 frequencies      and evaluate @xmath181 via ( [ eqn_fermionic - lehmann ] ) for a fixed iteration @xmath175 .",
    "since the information between even and odd iterations are collected separately , @xmath178 overlaps with the @xmath182 , i.e.  @xmath183 $ ] and @xmath184 $ ] . only the @xmath173 evaluated at the frequencies",
    "@xmath185 $ ] provide accurate information . at each iteration , we add the new data points @xmath186 at @xmath187 , @xmath188 $ ] to the previously obtained set of spectral information by      we do the same for the spectral information at the negative frequencies @xmath190 . with this recursion relation",
    ", we mimic the patching of the residua since residua far away from the frequency @xmath191 will only contribute marginal through the broadening procedure .",
    "it turned out that @xmath192 is a good choice , and for this work , we used @xmath193 .",
    "since the spectral information @xmath194 for @xmath195 is not very reliable for the last nrg iteration @xmath72 , we drop these @xmath196 frequencies .",
    "the major advantage of this new algorithm is that any temperature dependent spectral function can be calculated on the fly .",
    "there is no need for storage of information of previous iterations other than the spectral function @xmath197 itself .",
    "we also use two different broadening functions      depending whether the pole position @xmath199 is larger than a multiple of the temperature @xmath200 , @xmath201 or @xmath202 .",
    "@xmath203 is a constant of the order of @xmath204 as suggested in the literature @xcite .",
    "the parameter @xmath205 controls the width of the lorentzian on an energy scale of @xmath200 . here , we used @xmath206 and @xmath207 .",
    "since the iteration @xmath175 also represents a characteristic temperature scale @xcite , we only include spectral information up to iterations @xcite for which @xmath208 , where we chose @xmath209 ."
