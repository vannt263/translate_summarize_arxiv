    "the international celestial reference frame ( icrf ) is the realization , at radio wavelengths , of the international celestial reference system ( icrs ) , the solar - barycentric , quasi - inertial fundamental reference system adopted by the international astronomical union @xcite .",
    "the second realization , icrf2 , consists of 3,414 compact radio objects ( i.e. , qsos ) , of which 295 are `` defining sources '' @xcite .",
    "these qsos can be nearly ideal reference frame objects , as they present no significant parallax or proper motion and , when properly selected , they have minimal spatial structure or variability .",
    "using very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) techniques , icrf2 defining source position errors have an estimated noise floor of 40  @xmath9as .",
    "plans for the third realization of the icrf ( icrf3 ) , to be released in the 2018 timeframe , focus on further densifying the source catalog and improving spatial uniformity ( especially at negative declinations ) , improving the astrometric accuracy of the non - defining sources to bring them close to the accuracy of the defining sources , and extending of the icrf to higher frequencies to reduce the effects of source structure on position @xcite .",
    "much of the motivation for this improvement to the radio reference frame is driven by the european space agency s ( esa ) _ gaia _ mission , launched in 2013 .",
    "_ gaia _ is a space - based , astrometric , photometric and radial velocity all - sky survey at optical wavelengths . over the next few years",
    ", _ gaia _ will deliver astrometric catalogs that are expected to be adopted as the next optical instantiation of the fundamental reference frame . unlike its predecessor , _ hipparcos _ , which was limited to observing stars only , _ gaia _",
    ", with its limiting magnitude of @xmath10 , will directly observe hundreds of thousands of extragalactic objects . by tying together the positions of reference objects ( i.e. , qsos ) observed in both radio and optical , the _ gaia _",
    "reference frame will be brought into alignment and rotationally stabilized with respect to the radio reference frame .",
    "one critical limitation in aligning optical and radio reference frames is the problem of discrepancies ( or `` offsets '' ) in position between radio and optical measurements .",
    "offsets can be due to a variety of underlying physical differences between the emission mechanisms of agns in the optical and in the radio .",
    "first , for agn - dominated galaxies , optical emission is thought to originate from the compact accretion disk surrounding the supermassive black hole ( smbh ) , while radio emission can be either compact or extended , depending on the orientation of the jet with respect to the observer .",
    "second , for non agn - dominated galaxies , an optical centroid can be shifted relative to the radio position because of contamination by the host galaxy .",
    "depending on the distance to the source , the optical position can be significantly different from the position of a compact radio core .",
    "third , variability in either the jet or the accretion disk can cause apparent changes in the overall position of the agn in the optical or the radio over time , making the agn an unreliable tie source for use in defining the reference frame .",
    "position offsets as a function of wavelength in this class of sources have been extensively studied , beginning with  @xcite on the correlation between offsets and x - band ( 8.4  ghz ) structure in icrf sources , and extending to large systematic analyses of radio sources overlapping with the _ sloan digital sky survey _  ( sdss )  @xcite .",
    "recent optical observations of icrf sources found offsets between optical and radio positions at the 10  mas level , leaving the authors to conclude that unknown effects , most likely having to do with underlying astrophysical phenomena , induce this real offset between radio and optical positions .",
    "such an offset would introduce a fundamental limit of about 0.5 mas to the accuracy of the alignment between gaia and the icrf @xcite , and would be exacerbated should the sources be time varying in nature .",
    "these offsets can potentially be minimized by selecting reference frame objects that minimize problematic features , such as photometric variability or optical / radio structure .",
    "it is thus crucial to identify and characterize as many agns / qsos as possible in order to maximize the number of reference frame tie objects . until recently ,",
    "the number of known qsos was quite limited , of order a few tens of thousands over the entire sky .",
    "the sdss - dr12 quasar catalog ( dr12q ) , using data from the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey  ( boss ; * ? ? ? * ) and photometrically - selected qso candidates from sdss , contains 297,301 spectroscopically confirmed qsos over approximately 9,200 deg@xmath11 ( @xmath12 of the sky ; isabelle pris 2015 , private communication ) .",

    "a comparison with icrf sources shows that allwise catalog sources between @xmath25  mag have positional accuracies to within 50  mas , and half of these sources have positional accuracies to within 20  mas . for more details on",

    "there are numerous mid - ir color selection criteria in the literature , such as the _ spitzer _ two - color criteria in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ; the _ wise _ two - color criteria in @xcite , the _ wise _ one - color criteria of @xcite and @xcite , and the _ wise _ two - color criteria of @xcite .",
    "all of these color criteria , while defined using different agn subsamples , are in general agreement with each other , and rely on the fact that agns separate cleanly from stars and star - forming galaxies in mid - ir color space  ( for a recent empirical discussion of how objects differentiate in _ wise _ color space , see * ? ? ?",
    "the reason for this separation is because a ) stars have nearly blackbody seds with flux densities dropping at wavelengths longer than a few microns , and b ) while reprocessed photons from dust heating around star formation peaks around a few tens of microns , the hard radiation field from an agn accretion disk heats dust in the surrounding torus up to the dust sublimation temperature ( 1,000 - 1,500  k ) , leading to a relatively flat power - law spectrum that is easily distinguishable from the aforementioned non - agn seds . importantly , because the mid - ir is insensitive to extinction , mid - ir color selection can pick out heavily - obscured or even compton - thick ( @xmath26  @xmath27 ) agns @xcite that are optically indistinguishable from star - forming galaxies ( see , for example , figure 1 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , especially at higher agn luminosities  @xcite .",
    "this eliminates optical selection effects and can yield much larger and more statistically complete samples of agns .    in choosing a mid - ir color selection criteria",

    "magnitudes into _ wise _ magnitudes .",
    "this criteria also rules out the sdss-_wise _ color criteria of  @xcite , which would limit our sample to the sdss footprint .",
    "we further required that the criteria be defined directly from a clean , highly reliable sample of agns and qsos not defined empirically from _ wise _ data ; this rules out the criteria of @xcite .",
    "finally , we required that the criteria be a two - color selection , involving @xmath17-@xmath18 , which excludes the @xcite and @xcite criteria .",
    "this is because we are not restricting our sample to high galactic latitudes , so contamination by brown dwarfs may occur if we only use @xmath16-@xmath17 .",
    "we do not know _ a priori _ that our sources are extragalactic , and some brown dwarfs can share the first color axis @xmath16-@xmath17 with agns due to methane absorption at @xmath28 reducing emission in the @xmath16 band ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in developing an all - sky catalog of mid - infrared zero - proper motion , zero - parallax objects , it is key to minimize brown dwarf contamination , as many brown dwarfs are within a few pc and therefore have very high proper motions , as high as @xmath29  yr@xmath30 @xcite . for picking out _",
    "irac - selected agns down to a limiting magnitude of @xmath31 , the _ wise _ one - color agn selection criteria of @xcite and @xcite are both very reliable , with 95% and and @xmath32 reliability , respectively . however these two - color cuts also overlap significantly with the mid - ir color space occupied by brown dwarfs . for example , using the representative sample of the allwise catalog described in  [ subsec : stellarcontamination ] , out of 1,056 sources identified as agns using the @xcite criterion , 62 ( 5.9% ) also qualify as brown dwarfs according to the combined empirical criterion for dwarfs with spectral type @xmath33t5 and nearby l and t - type dwarfs of @xcite .",
    "similarly , of the 1,892 sources identified as agns using the `` r90 '' criterion of @xcite , 59 ( 3.1% ) fall within the combined @xcite criterion .    with these considerations , we chose the two - color selection criterion of @xcite , who use the bright ultrahard _ xmm - newton _ survey ( buxs ) , one of the largest , flux - limited samples of ` ultra hard ' ( 4.5 - 10 kev ) x - ray selected sources , to define a _ wise _ agn selection criterion .",
    "this reduces bias against heavily absorbed agns , and the buxs is comprised mostly ( 56.2% ) of type  1 agns ( emission line widths @xmath34  km  s@xmath30 ) ; the remainder are almost entirely type  2 agns .",
