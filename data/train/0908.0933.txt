    "the mass loss in massive stars is thought to take place via supersonic inhomogeneous winds .",
    "considerable observational evidence supports the idea that the wind structure is clumpy ( e.g. owocki & cohen 2006 ) , although the properties of clumps are not well - known as a cosequense of the high spatial resolution necessary for the clumps detection .",
    "some massive stars are accompanied by a compact object and present transfer of matter to it forming an accretion disk and , in high - mass microquasars ( hmmqs ) , bipolar relativistic outflows .",
    "non - thermal emission has been observed in microquasar jets from radio to x - rays , and it is thought that @xmath0-rays could be also produced in jets .",
    "recently , a tev flare has been detected from the hmmq cygnus  x-1 ( albert et al . 2007 ) .",
    "transient @xmath0-ray events could have been detected as well from the high - mass x - ray binaries ls  5039 ( aharonian et al .",
    "2005 ) , ls  i+61  303 ( albert et al .",
    "2006 ) and perhaps from the hmmq cygnus x-3 ( atels 1492 , 1547 and 1585 ) .",
    "some authors have been suggested that this strongly variable @xmath0-ray emission can be produced by the interaction between the jet and the stellar wind of the companion star ( e.g. owocki et al .",
    "2009 , araudo et al .",
    "2009 ) .    in the present contribution we propose a model to explain these @xmath0-ray flares based on the interaction between the jets of a hmmq with wind inhomogeneities .",
    "the clumps can eventually penetrate in the jet , leading to transient non - thermal activity that may release a significant fraction of the jet kinetic luminosity in the form of synchrotron , inverse compton ( ic ) , and proton - proton ( @xmath4 ) emission .",
    "to study the interaction between a clump of the stellar wind and a jet in a hmmq , we adopt a scenario with similar characteristics to cygnus  x-1 .",
    "we fix the separation between the compact object and the massive star to @xmath5  cm .",
    "the stellar mass loss rate is adopted to be @xmath6  yr@xmath2 , with a terminal wind velocity @xmath7  cm  s@xmath2 .",
    "a sketch of the scenario is presented in figure [ sketch ] .",
    "the clump is taken to be spherical and we consider two values of it radius : @xmath8 and @xmath9  cm .",
    "we have assumed that the velocity of the clumps is equal to the velocity of the wind , i.e @xmath10 . in order to obtain a large density contrast between the clump and the jet we assume dense and homogeneous clumps with @xmath11  @xmath12 , which corresponds to a clumpy wind filling factor of @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the mass of the proton .",
    "we consider a jet dynamically dominated by cold protons with a bulk velocity @xmath15 and a kinetic luminosity @xmath16 ( e.g. gallo et al . 2005 ) .",
    "we assume here that the jet radius is one tenth of the jet height , i.e. @xmath17 , and the jet - clump interaction is taken to occur at @xmath18 .",
    "the density of the jet material at @xmath19 results @xmath20  @xmath12 and then , the ratio between the clump and the jet densities is @xmath21 .",
    "this parameter will be very relevant for the jet - clump interaction estimates .      in order to study the physical processes of the jet - clump interaction , we consider the collision of a single clump with the jet .",
    "the huge density contrast @xmath22 allows the clump to cross the boundary of the jet and fully penetrate into it . in the context of this work , thermal conduction , clump expansion , magnetic fields and gravitational forces",
    "are not dynamically relevant for the jet - clump interaction and will be neglected .    in the laboratory reference frame ( lrf ) , the clump will take a time @xmath23 to fully enter the jet and a time @xmath24 to cross it roughly at the wind velocity :    @xmath25    @xmath26    when the clump interacts with the jet , a shock is formed in the clump and propagates in the direction of the jet motion with a velocity @xmath27 .",
    "the clump - crossing time , which is the characteristic timescale of the jet - clump interaction , can be defined as : @xmath28    a shock ( the bow shock ) is also formed in the jet when its material collides with the clump .",
    "we assume the clump / bow - shock separation distance as @xmath29 ( van dyke & gordon 1959 ) , and thus the time required to reach the steady state regime results : @xmath30 once the clump is inside the jet , the latter accelerates the clump up to the background velocity , @xmath31 , with an acceleration @xmath32 ( e.g. fragile et al .",
    "2004 ) in a time @xmath33 when one fluid exerts a force against another fluid of different density , the hydrodynamical rayleigh - taylor ( rt ) instability eventually develops , leading to the perturbation and potential disruption of the clump .",
    "on the other hand , after the bow shock is formed , the jet material surrounds the clump and we have two fluids with a large relative velocity ( in our case @xmath34 ) .",
    "this situation leads to kelvin - helmholtz ( kh ) instabilities .",
    "the timescale for these instabilities , considering that the length of the perturbed region is @xmath35 , are : @xmath36    we assume that for a @xmath37 we can treat the jet - clump interaction as the clump were fully inside the jet . at this stage",
    "we do not consider the penetration of the clump into the jet , and assume in our treatment that the former is completely inside the latter ( i.e. the system has cylindrical symmetry ; see fig .",
    "[ sketch ] ) .",
    "we notice that the clump might not escape the jet if @xmath38 due to disruption through instabilities , although numerical simulations show that the instability timescales are actually longer than the clump crossing time by a factor of a few ( e.g. klein , mckee & colella 1994 ) .",
    "given the characteristics of our scenario , the shock in the clump is radiative , and the bow shock is adiabatic . for these reasons , the shocked and heated material of the clump will radiate ( by thermal bremsstrahlung ) a non - negligible part of the energy tranferred by the jet , whereas in the bow shock non - thermal processes take place .",
    "we focus here in the non - thermal emission .      assuming that non - relativistic diffusive ( fermi i ) shock acceleration takes place in the bow - shock",
    ", electrons and protons with a charge @xmath39 will be accelerated up to an energy @xmath40 in a time @xmath41 in the bohm limit and for perpendicular shocks ( protheroe 1999 ) .",
    "the magnetic field in the acceleration region is @xmath42 , and we will consider two values for it .",
    "first , we consider a value obtained assuming that the magnetic energy density is a @xmath43 of the plasma internal energy density downstream and we obtain @xmath44  g. we adopt a sub - equipartition value to make @xmath42 dynamically negligible with respect to matter .",
    "in addition , we adopt @xmath45  g to check the impact on our results of a magnetic field much smaller than in the sub - equipartition case .    in the scenario presented in this work ,",
    "relativistic leptons lose their energy mainly by synchrotron radiation and ic scattering .",
    "the former have the following cooling time @xmath46 at @xmath19 , the energy density of the photons from the star is @xmath47  erg @xmath12 , being the typical photon energy @xmath48  ev . for @xmath49",
    "the ic interaction takes place in the klein - nishina ( kn ) regime .",
    "a formula for the ic cooling time valid in both thompson ( th ) and kn regime under a photon field with a narrow energy distribution is ( e.g. bosch - ramon & khangulyan 2009 ) : @xmath50    regarding hadronic emission , @xmath0-rays are produced if relativistic protons interact with nuclei through inelastic @xmath4 collisions , beeing the proton cooling time @xmath51 in the bow - shock region , this process is negligible .",
    "otherwise , if relativistic protons accelerated in the bow shock penetrate into the clump , @xmath4 interactions can become an efficient process to generate @xmath0-rays because @xmath52 .    besides radiative cooling , the escape of particles from the acceleration region is another kind of energy losses .",
    "the corresponding timescale , @xmath53 , takes into account the advection of relativistic particles by downstream bow - shock material ( @xmath54 ) and the diffusion of particles ( @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the bohm diffusion coefficient ) , being @xmath57 . equating energy gains and losses , the maximum energy achieved by electrons ( @xmath58 ) accelerated in the bow shock",
    "is estimated ( see fig . [ losses ] ) .",
    "on the other hand , the maximum energy for protons ( @xmath59 ) is constrained by the size of the acceleration region . in table",

    ".maximum energies achieved by acelerated particles in the bow shock and the energy break of electrons .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      in this section we calculate the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the emission produced by the most relevant non - thermal radiative processes : synchrotron and ic radiation in the bow - shock region and @xmath4 in the clump .",
    "we assume an injected population of relativistic particles in the bow - shock region that follows a power - law energy distribution of the form : @xmath60 typical for fermi i acceleration .",
    "the normalization constant @xmath61 is determined assuming that the ( non - thermal ) luminosity of accelerated particles is @xmath62 ( note that the predicted fluxes scale linearly with the adopted non - thermal fraction @xmath63 ) . to estimate the particle energy distribution @xmath64 , we solve the kinetic equation in the one - zone model approximation for the bow - shock region ( e.g. ginzburg & syrovatskii 1964 ) :    @xmath65    the relativistic leptons reach the steady state well before the shock has crossed the clump .",
    "particles downstream with low energies escape advected in the shocked material of the jet before cooling radiatively , producing a break in the energy spectrum of particles . from @xmath66 and @xmath67",
    "we determine the electron break energies @xmath68 .",
    "the values are shown in table [ table_energies ] .",
    "the most energetic electrons can diffuse up to the clump ( @xmath45  g ) or lose their energy inside the bow - shock region by synchrotron and ic radiation ( @xmath44  g ) .",
    "we note that the electrons with energies @xmath69 can reach the clump and radiate inside it . in this work",
    ", we do not estimate the lepton emission in the clump .    as noted in sect .",
    "[ part_accel ] , relativistic protons do not suffer significant @xmath4 losses in the bow - shock region ( @xmath70 ) .",
    "these protons can also reach the clump if they are not advected by the shocked material of the jet . imposing that @xmath71 , the minimum energy necessary to reach",
    "the clump is @xmath72 , and the maximum energies of these protons are shown in table [ table_energies ] . on the other hand , to confine relativistic protons in the clump requires a very large magnetic field and we assume that protons will cross the whole clump in a time @xmath73 .",
    "then , the distribution of relativistic protons in the clump is @xmath74 .    with the steady distributions of relativistic electrons in the bow shock , @xmath75 , and protons in the clump , @xmath76",
    ", we calculate the seds .",
    "we estimate the specific luminosity as @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the emissivity of the process and @xmath79 is the photon energy .",
    "synchrotron and ic emissivities are computed using the standard formulae given in blumenthal & gould ( 1970 ) . for the later process",
    "we consider the parametrized differential cross section valid in both th and kn regimes and @xmath80-decay emissivity is calculated following kelner et al .",
    "the synchrotron emission is computed in the optically thin case , neglecting the impact of synchrotron self - absorption , but at high energies ( ic and @xmath4 ) @xmath81 absorption is taken into account .",
    "synchrotron emission is dominant at x - rays for @xmath82  g , with @xmath83  erg  s@xmath2 .",
    "inverse compton scattering produces @xmath0-rays up to very high energies , dominating the radiation output in the cases with @xmath84  g. in our calculations , the highest luminosity achieved is @xmath85  erg  s@xmath2 for @xmath86  cm , although @xmath81 absorption can reduce substantially the emission above 100  gev .",
    "proton - proton collisions in the clump can also produce @xmath0-rays at energies that may be as high as @xmath87  ev ( @xmath82  g ) .",
    "the maximum luminosity obtained by @xmath4 is nevertheless quite modest , @xmath88  erg  s@xmath2 for @xmath86  cm , although denser and/or bigger clumps , and more powerful jets may yield detectable amounts of photons outside the @xmath81 absorption range ( 0.1 - 10  tev ) .",
    "the computed seds are shown in fig .",
    "[ seds ] , only for the cases with @xmath44  g.",
    "in general , many clumps can interact with the jet and is possible to have several clumps inside it simultaneously ( see owocki et al . 2009 ) .",
    "however , at @xmath89  cm the destruction time @xmath90 is less than the penetration one ( @xmath23 ) and the clump will be destroyed before completely entering into the jet .",
    "then , the model presented here is not valid at @xmath91 ( neither if @xmath92 ) .    considering a canonical geometry for the jet and a filling factor of the wind @xmath93 , we estimate the number of clumps -@xmath94- inside the jet , from @xmath95 up to @xmath96 .",
    "we obtain @xmath97 and @xmath98 for @xmath99 and @xmath9  cm , respectively . as a consecuence , flares produced by jet - clump interactions",
    "could be a sporadic phenomenon , for a low @xmath94 ( @xmath86  cm ) , or may appear as a modulated steady activity , for a high @xmath94 ( @xmath99  cm ) . in the latter case , the resulting sed will be similar than the obtained in the previous section , but multiplied by @xmath94 .",
    "nevertheless , we note that the jet may be disrupted in those cases when too many clumps are simultaneously present inside the jet ( araudo et al .",
    ". however , more detailed calculations of the dynamics of the jet - clump interaction are required to clarify this issue .",
    "in the present work , we study the main physical processes and the radiative outcomes from the interaction between the jet of a hmmq with a clump of the companion stellar wind . this interaction produces a bow - shock in the jet where particles are accelerated up to very - high energies .",
    "the relativistic electrons are cooled efficiently by synchrotron and ic radiation in the bow shock , and protons by @xmath80-decay from @xmath4 interactions in the clump .    due to characteristics of the interaction ,",
    "the expected emission can be transient if @xmath94 is low . given the typical dynamical timescales , the flare duration may last from minutes to a few hours .",
    "the flares of jet - clump interactions would have associated lower ( synchrotron ) and higher energy components ( ic , @xmath4 emission ) . the total level of emission",
    ", the importance of the different components , and the duration of the flares , can give information on the jet power and size , clump size and density , and magnetic fields in the interaction regions .",
    "therefore , besides the jet itself , the clump properties can be probed by observations at high energies of transient activity in hmmqs , being a new tool to study the winds of massive stars .",
