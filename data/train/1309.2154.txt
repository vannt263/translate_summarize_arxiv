    "the debate between the power - law behavior @xcite and the activated scaling @xcite is still going on . finally for spin - glasses , the same controversy exists between power - law dynamics @xcite and logarithmic dynamics @xcite , as well as in the interpretation of experimental data @xcite .",

    "it is also often called the ergodic time , since it represents the time needed to visit the whole phase space of configurations .",
    "for instance for the pure ferromagnet in dimension @xmath23 , the largest relaxation time @xmath24 for a finite system containing @xmath25 spins corresponds near zero temperature to the time needed to go from one ground state ( where all spins take the value @xmath26 ) to the opposite ground state ( where all spins take the value @xmath27 ) . as a consequence",

    "the random initial condition is a configuration of very high energy containing a large density of domain - walls , so that the relaxational dynamics is dominated by the diffusion ( hence the diffusion value @xmath16 for the dynamical exponent ) and annihilation of the domain - walls . on the contrary , for the equilibrium time of eq .",
    "[ ferropur ] , one may consider that the initial condition is one of the ground state , and one is interested into the time needed to reach the opposite ground state by thermal activation  : so here the system has to _ create a system - size domain - wall _ as an intermediate step .",
    "for the mean - field sherrington - kirkpatrick spin - glass model @xcite , which is the basis of the replica - symmetry - breaking scenario @xcite , there exists a consensus both theoretically @xcite and numerically @xcite that the largest relaxation time follows the activated scaling @xmath31 with the barrier exponent @xmath32 again , this largest relaxation time corresponds near zero temperature to the time needed to go from one ground - state to the opposite ground state .",
