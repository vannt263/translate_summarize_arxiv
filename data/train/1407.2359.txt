    "blazars constitute the most extreme sub - class of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .",
    "the observed broad - band radiation from blazars is characterized by non - thermal emission extending from radio to very high energy ( vhe ) @xmath1-rays .",
    "the detection of energetic @xmath1rays and rapid variability observed in many blazars suggest , the emission to arise from a relativistic jet oriented very close to the line of sight of the observer [ 1 ] . under the current picture of agn ,",
    "the jet is powered by a super massive black hole at the center of host galaxy and accreting matter from it .",
    "blazars are further classified into flat spectrum radio quasars ( fsrq ) and bl lacs depending upon the presence / absence of emission / absorption line features . due to relativistic doppler boosting , the non thermal emission from the jet dominates the entire spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of blazars .",
    "the radiation from blazars , over entire electromagnetic spectrum , is extremely variable at different time scales ranging from few minutes to years .",
    "the variability timescale of blazars can be used to constrain the emission region size through light travel time effects and also in understanding the underlying particle acceleration mechanisms [ 2,3 ] .",
    "the broad band sed of blazars consists of two peaks with the first one at ir / optical / x  ray energies and the second at gamma  ray energies [ 4 ] .",
    "the low energy component is commonly attributed to the synchrotron emission from the ultra - relativistic leptons in the jet . on the other hand ,",
    "the physical mechanisms proposed to model the high energy ( he ) component include : synchrotron self compton emission ( ssc models ) [ 5 ] , compton up scattering of external photons ( ec models ) from accretion disk [ 6 ] , broad line region ( blr ) [ 7 ] , or cascades produced by high energy protons [ 8,9,10 ]",
    ". therefore , @xmath1ray observations of blazars in flaring state along with simultaneous multi - wavelength data are important tools to validate the emission models .",

    "an intense @xmath2 flaring activity of mrk 421 was observed with @xmath0 during february 2010 . after performing data quality checks [ 27 ]",
    ", we obtained 48.4 hours of clean data spanning over 12 nights of observation .",
    "the standard data quality checks for @xmath0 involve @xmath32 conformity of the expected prompt coincidence rate ( pcr ) trend with zenith angle , @xmath33 compatibility of the arrival time of cosmic - ray events with the poissonian statistics and @xmath34 steady behaviour of chance coincidence rate ( ccr ) with time .",
    "the data recorded with @xmath0 were analysed using standard hillas parameterization technique [ 28 ] .",
    "each cherenkov image is characterized by various image parameters like length ( l ) , width ( w ) , distance ( d ) , alpha ( @xmath35 ) , size ( s ) and frac2 ( f2 ) using moment analysis methodology .",
    "while the shapes of roughly elliptical images are described by l and w parameters , their location and orientation in the telescope field of view are specified by d and @xmath35 parameters respectively .",
    "parameter f2 is defined as the ratio of sum of the two highest amplitude pixels to the total image size .",
    "the standard dynamic supercut procedure [ 29 , 30 ] is used to segregate @xmath1- like images from background images of cosmic  rays .",
    "the @xmath1ray selection criteria obtained on the basis of monte carlo simulations carried out for @xmath0 telescope are given in table 1 .",
    "the @xmath1ray signal is extracted from cosmic  ray background using frequency distribution of @xmath35parameter after applying the set of image parameter cuts presented in table 1 .",
    "the distribution of @xmath35parameter is expected to be flat for cosmic  ray background due to its isotropic behaviour , whereas for @xmath1ray events coming from a point source , the distribution is expected to show a peak at smaller @xmath35 values . the present analysis of @xmath0 data from mrk 421 direction during february 1023 , 2010 resulted in an excess of 737@xmath3687 @xmath1ray like events corresponding to a statistical significance of 8.46@xmath8 in nearly 48 hours .",
    "observation of flaring activity on february 16 , 2010 ( mjd 55243 ) alone yields 172@xmath3630 @xmath1-like events corresponding to a statistical significance of 5.92@xmath8 in @xmath26 4.9 hours .",

    "the energy of each @xmath1-like event is reconstructed using an artificial neural network ( ann ) based methodology on the basis of its zenith angle , size and distance .",
    "the procedure followed by us uses 3:30:1 ( i.e. 3 nodes in the input layer , 30 nodes in the hidden layer and 1 node in the output layer ) configuration of the ann and yields an energy resolution of @xmath2626@xmath37 [ 31 ]",

    "in the present work we have used tev observations with @xmath0 together with other mw data on mrk 421 , to study the variability and spectral properties of the source during its high state of activity . apart from analyzing the @xmath0,_fermi_lat and _ swift_xrt data during febraury 1023 , 2010 ( mjd 5523755250 ) , we have also used simultaneous archival data for _ swift_bat , maxi , optical ( v - band ) and radio ( 15 ghz ) observations for our study .",
    "the highest flaring activity from the source in tev energy band , as measured by @xmath0 was detected on february 16 , 2010 ( mjd 55243 ) and an enhanced activity was also observed in he @xmath1rays from _ fermi_/lat and x  rays .",
    "the varaiability studies in various energy bands ( fig.3 ) suggest the emission to arise from the jet .",
    "similar features observed in x - ray and tev flare also support synchrotron and ssc origin of these emissions .",
    "the data statistics are not good enough to assert these interpretations strongly .",
    "especially , the double flare seen in x  ray energy band , reflect the amount of complexity involved in these emission processes .",
    "modelling such features may demand detailed study involving various acceleration mechanisms driving blazar flares ; however , this is beyond the scope of the present study .",
    "recently , dahai yan et al . (",
    "2013 ) have investigated the electron energy distributions and the acceleration mechanisms in the jet of mrk 421 by fitting the sed in different active states under the framework of single - zone ssc model [ 50 ] .",
    "they conclude that the shock acceleration is dominant in low activity state , while stochastic turbulence acceleration is dominant in flaring state .",
    "whereas , mastichiadis et al .",
    "( 2013 ) have studied the origin of @xmath1ray emission in blazars within the context of the lepto - hadronic single zone model [ 51 ] .",
    "they find that @xmath1ray emission can be attributed to synchrotron radiation either from protons or from secondary leptons produced via photohadronic process .",
    "these possibilities imply differences in the x  ray and @xmath1ray variability signatures .",
    "the time averaged broad band sed of mrk 421 during the flare can be well reproduced under the framework of simple one zone ssc model .",
    "the resulting parameters from the sed modeling are consistent with the source parameters used in ssc model reported in the literature [ 48,49 ] . from these parameters we estimate the kinetic power of the jet ( @xmath38 ) by assuming that the emission region is also populated with cold protons equal in number as that of the non thermal electrons .",
    "the power of the jet can then be approximated as [ 52 ] @xmath39 where @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 are cold proton energy density , magnetic field energy density and electron energy density in the rest frame of emission region respectively .",
    "the obtained jet power ( @xmath38=@xmath43 erg / s ) is consistent with the one generally assumed for blazars and is much larger than the power released in the form of radiation ( @xmath44=@xmath45 erg / s ) .",
    "hence at blazar zone only a small fraction of the jet kinetic energy is utilized in radiation and most of the energy is spent in driving the jet upto @xmath46 scale .",
    "eventhough , the obtained model parameters are consistent with the general accepted values for mrk 421 , they differ considerably from the one reported by [ 20 ] during the same flaring episode .",
    "we note that the primary reason for this difference is due to the constraint introduced through equi - partition condition ( equation 8) .",
    "since equi - partition assures that the system is under minimum energy state ( stable ) [ 53 ] , the parameters obtained in the present work may be the more probable ones .",
    "however , it is also to be noted that many blazars do not satisfy the equi - partition condition during a flare [ 54 ] .",
    "most of these uncertanties regarding the emission models and underlying parameters can be resolved by detailed modelling of blazar light curves using complex algorithms .",
    "however such work would involve large number of parameters and future simultaneous mw observations of blazars during flare can be used to estimate / constrain these parameters .",
