    "then , in order to account for the double - logs of both @xmath0 and @xmath35 , we need to construct a kind of two - dimensional evolution equations that would combine both the @xmath0- and @xmath35- evolutions .",

    "when the factorization depicted in fig .  1 is assumed , the calculation of @xmath1 ( for semplicity we will omit the superscript `` s '' for@xmath1 singlet , though we use the notation @xmath24 for the non - singlet @xmath1 ) is reduced to calculating the feynman graphs contributing the partonic tensor @xmath67 depicted as the upper blobs in fig .  1 . both cases , ( a ) , when the virtual photon scatters off the nearly on - shell polarized quark , and ( b ) , when the quark is replaced by the polarized gluon , should be taken into account .",
