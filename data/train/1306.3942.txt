    "let @xmath0 be a one - dimensional time - homogeneous diffusion , and let @xmath4 be a probability measure on @xmath5 .",
    "the skorokhod embedding problem ( sep ) for @xmath1 in @xmath0 is to find a stopping time @xmath2 such that @xmath6 .",
    "our main goals in this article are firstly to construct a solution of the skorokhod embedding problem , and secondly to discuss when does there exist a solution which is finite , integrable or bounded in time , and when does our construction have these properties .",
    "our construction is based on the observation that we can remove the drift of the time - homogeneous diffusion by changing the space variable via a _ scale function_. we can thus simplify the embedding problem to the case where @xmath0 is a local martingale diffusion .",
    "we then consider a random variable that has the distribution we want to embed and that can be represented as a brownian martingale @xmath7 on the time interval @xmath8 $ ] .",
    "further , we set up an ode that uniquely determines a time - change along every path of @xmath0 .",
    "we then show , by drawing on a result of uniqueness in law for weak solutions of sdes , that the time - changed diffusion has the same distribution as the martingale @xmath7 .",
    "thus the time - change provides a solution of the sep .",
    "our solution is a generalization of bass s solution of the sep for _ brownian motion _ ( see @xcite ) .",
    "bass also starts with the martingale representation of a random variable with the given distribution . by changing the martingale s clock , he obtains a brownian motion and an associated embedding stopping time .",
    "the time - change is governed by an ode , a special case of our ode , which establishes an analytic link between brownian paths and the embedding stopping time .",
    "this link yields embedding stopping times for _ arbitrary _ brownian motions .",
    "now consider properties of solutions of the sep . as is well known from the literature , whether a distribution is embeddable into the diffusion @xmath0 depends on the relation between the support of the distribution and the state space of @xmath0 and the relation between the initial value @xmath9 and the first moment of the distribution .",
    "we include in our analysis a general discussion of sufficient and necessary conditions for the existence of _ finite _ embedding stopping times , with particular reference to our proposed construction .",
    "next , we fully determine the collection of distributions that can be embedded in @xmath0 with _ integrable _ stopping times .",
    "the associated conditions involve an integrability condition on the target distribution which makes use of a function that also appears in feller s test for explosions ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "finally , we address the question of whether a distribution can be embedded in _ bounded _ time .",
    "recall that the root solution ( @xcite ) of the sep has the property that it minimises @xmath10 $ ] uniformly in @xmath11 .",
    "the root solution @xmath12 is of the form @xmath13 where @xmath14 is a ` barrier ' ; in particular @xmath15 for some suitably regular function @xmath16 depending on the target law .",
    "hence , a necessary and sufficient condition for there to be an embedding @xmath2 with @xmath17 is that @xmath18 .",
    "however , the root barrier is non - constructive and difficult to analyse ( though for some recent progress in this direction see cox and wang @xcite and oberhauser and dos reis @xcite ) . for this reason , instead of searching for a single set of necessary _ and _ sufficient conditions we limit ourselves to finding separate sets of necessary conditions and sufficient conditions .",
    "our original motivation in developing a solution of the sep for diffusions was to study bounded stopping times with the aim of providing simple sufficient conditions for the existence of a bounded embedding .",
    "the boundedness ( finiteness ) of an embedding is an important property of the embedding used to solve the gambling in contests problem of seel and strack @xcite , and is also relevant in the model - independent pricing of variance swaps , see carr and lee @xcite , hobson @xcite and cox and wang @xcite .",
    "consider for a moment the case where @xmath0 is a real - valued brownian motion , null at 0 .",
    "then it is possible to embed any target probability measure @xmath4 in @xmath0 .",
    "moreover , @xmath1 can be embedded in integrable time if and only if @xmath1 is centred and in @xmath19 , and then @xmath20 = \\int x^2 \\rho(\\mathrm{d}x)$ ] .",
    "the case of embeddings in bounded time is more subtle .",
    "clearly a necessary condition for there to exist an embedding @xmath2 of @xmath1 in @xmath0 such that @xmath21 is that @xmath1 is smaller that @xmath22 in convex order , where @xmath22 is the law of a standard gaussian .",
    "but this is not sufficient .",
    "let @xmath23 be the uniform measure on @xmath24",
    ". then @xmath23 is smaller than @xmath22 in convex order if and only if @xmath25 . but",
    "any embedding @xmath2 of @xmath23 has @xmath26 , and thus does not satisfy @xmath17 for any @xmath27 .",
    "hence , we would like to find sufficient conditions on @xmath1 such that there exists @xmath17 with @xmath6 .",
    "the case where @xmath0 is brownian motion , possibly with drift , was considered in ankirchner and strack @xcite .",
    "here we consider general time - homogeneous diffusions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : mg ] , we describe our solution method of the sep for a diffusion _ without _ drift . in this section , we assume that the initial value of the diffusion coincides with the first moment of the distribution to embed ( the centred case ) . in the following section  [ non - c case ] ,",
    "we briefly explain how to construct solutions if the first moment does _ not _ match the initial value ( the non - centred case ) . in section  [ sec finite e ] , we collect some general conditions which guarantee that a distribution can be embedded into @xmath0 in finite time .",
    "we then consider integrable embeddings in section  [ sec int emb ] .",
    "distinguishing between the centred and non - centred case , we provide sufficient and necessary conditions for the existence of integrable solutions of the sep .",
    "section  [ sec : bte ] discusses bounded embeddings . in section  [ sec",
    ": diff ] , we explain how one can reduce the sep for diffusions with drift to the case without drift . finally , in section  [ sec",
    ": eg ] we illustrate our results with some examples .",
    "we will argue in section  [ sec : diff ] below that the problem of interest can be reduced to the case in which the process is a continuous local martingale . in this section",
    ", we describe a generalisation of the bass @xcite solution of the sep .",
    "the bass solution is an embedding of @xmath28 in brownian motion : we consider embeddings in a local martingale diffusion which may be thought of as time - changed brownian motion .",
    "consider the time - homogeneous local martingale diffusion @xmath29 , where @xmath29 solves @xmath30 here @xmath31 and @xmath32 is borel - measurable .",
    "we assume that the set of points @xmath33 with @xmath34 coincides with the set of points where @xmath35 is _ not _ locally square integrable .",
    "then a result by engelbert and schmidt implies that the sde ( [ sde ] ) possesses a weak solution that is unique in law ( see , e.g. , theorem  5.5.4 in @xcite ) .",
    "we define @xmath36 and @xmath37 so that @xmath38 ( to exclude trivialities we assume @xmath39 ) and for @xmath40 , @xmath41 by our assumption on @xmath42 , @xmath43 is infinite on @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
