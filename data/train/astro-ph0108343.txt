    "millisecond pulsars ( msps ) are formed in binary systems containing a neutron star ( ns ) which is eventually spun up through mass accretion from the evolving companion @xcite . despite the large difference in total mass between the disk of the galaxy and the globular cluster ( gc ) system , about",
    "50% of the entire msp population has been found in the latter .",
    "this is not surprising because , apart from the evolution of primordial binaries , another formation channel for the msps is available in these stellar systems : exchange interactions in the ultra - dense stellar environment of the cluster core can sustain the formation of various kinds of binaries suitable for recycling neutron stars @xcite .",
    "many authors ( e.g. @xcite ) have discussed the importance of the discovery of gc - msps as diagnostic tools for studying the dynamics of the clusters , the evolution of the binaries , the interstellar medium and the intracluster ionized gas @xcite but , except for the significant case of 47  tuc @xcite , the discovery rate of these objects strongly declined in the second half of the 1990s : in the 7 years from 1987 ( when b1821@xmath024 was discovered in m28 at jodrell bank @xcite ) to 1994 @xcite 32 gc - msps entered the catalog , whereas no new source was published in the following 5 years .    passing reasons ( e.g. the upgrade of the arecibo telescope ) may have contributed to this trend , but a more meaningful explanation is that _ searches for gc - msps are difficult because they are often distant pulsars in close binary systems_. their large distances _ ( i ) _ make their fluxes typically very small and _ ( ii ) _ strongly distort their signals due to the dispersive effects of propagation through the interstellar medium . their inclusion in tight binaries _ ( iii ) _ causes doppler - shift changes of the apparent spin period and sometimes _ ( iv ) _ makes the radio signal periodically obscured by eclipses .    in the last couple of years a new search still in progress at the parkes radio telescope has broken the hiatus in discoveries . in the following",
    "we review the current status of this experiment , including the preliminary announcement of two new clusters with which an msp has now been associated @xcite .",
    "the availability of a new highly sensitive 20-cm receiver at parkes together with a modern data acquisition system impelled us to undertake a new search of gcs for msps .",
    "this receiver has a system temperature of @xmath1  k and a bandwidth of @xmath2 300 mhz : performing long integrations ( @xmath3 hr ) we have been able to reach a very good nominal sensitivity ( at signal - to - noise ratio s / n=8 ) of @xmath4jy for a typical 3 ms pulsar with dispersion measure dm @xmath5 @xmath6 pc .    with the aim of improving our capability for probing distant clusters ,",
    "we have designed and assembled at jodrell bank and bologna a high resolution filterbank system consisting of @xmath7 mhz adjacent channels per polarization .",
    "this enables us to minimize the deleterious effects of dispersion in the interstellar medium sufficiently to maintain significant sensitivity to msps with dm @xmath8 @xmath6pc .",
    "we have selected about 60 clusters among the ones visible at parkes according to their optical central density and satisfying the requirement dm@xmath9 @xmath6pc ( where dm@xmath10 is the dm expected for the cluster according to a model for the galactic distribution of the ionized gas @xcite ) : only a few of them contain already known msps . in order to reduce the probability of missing strong signals temporarily obscured by eclipse events we have performed multiple observations of each target cluster .    after adding the outputs of 1024 channels in polarization pairs ,",
    "the resulting 512 data streams are each integrated and 1-bit digitized every 125 @xmath11s : thus each observation produces a huge array , typically of @xmath12 gbytes , requiring significant cpu resources for offline processing . in bologna , we use a local cluster of 10 alpha-500mhz cpus and on occasion the cray - t3e 256-processor system at the cineca supercomputing center .    in the offline processing , each data stream is split into non - overlapping segments of 2100 , 4200 or 8400 sec and these are processed separately .",
    "when no pulsar is known in a gc ( and so the dm is unknown ) the data are first de - dispersed over a wide range of @xmath13 trial dms , spanning the interval dm@xmath1440% .",
    "each de - dispersed series is then transformed using a fast fourier transform . in the subsequent step ,",
    "time - domain data are folded in sub - integrations using constant periods , each corresponding to a large number of spectral features above a given threshold .",
    "the resulting `` sub - integration arrays '' are searched both for a linear and for a parabolic shift in pulse phase .",
    "the linear correction is a consequence of having folded the data at an approximate spin period , whereas the parabolic correction is a signature of the acceleration of the source due to its orbital motion .",
    "parameters for final pulse profiles with significant s / n are displayed for visual inspection .",
    "this processing scheme gives some sensitivity for msps belonging to binary systems and most of our discoveries have been obtained using it .",
    "however , once a pulsar is detected and confirmed in a cluster , we usually reprocess the data de - dispersing them at the single dm value of the newly discovered pulsar ; then the resulting time series undergoes a fully coherent search for `` accelerated '' signals over a large range of acceleration values .",
    "being extremely cpu time - consuming , this kind of coherent search is not used when a dm value ( or a narrow dm range ) is not available .",
    "finally , in the case of two clusters ( liller  1 and terzan  5 , the latter containing 2 already known msps ) , we have established a collaboration with scott ransom , whose code @xcite looks promising for detecting msps orbiting in ultra - close binaries , whose orbital period is shorter than the typical duration of an observation .",
    "so far we have discovered 12 new pulsars in 6 globular clusters , none of which had previously known pulsars associated with them .",
    "seven of these pulsars are members of binary systems , and 6 of them have relatively high dm values .",
    "one pulsar follows a highly eccentric orbit and another one is eclipsed for a large fraction of the orbital period .",
    "their preliminary parameters are reported in table  1 .",

    "rubenstein & bailyn @xcite estimated a binary fraction for main sequence stars in the range 15%@xmath038% inside the inner core radius ( @xmath23 ) , decreasing to less than 16% beyond that .",
    "at least 6 dim x - ray sources have been identified on the basis of rosat pointings @xcite .",
    "this is one of the clusters with the more precise distance measurement : @xmath24 , obtained fitting the white dwarf ( wd ) sequence @xcite .    in this cluster",
    "we first discovered a 3.26 ms binary pulsar , psr  j1910@xmath059a @xcite .",
    "this pulsar has a relatively low dm = 34 @xmath6pc , and scintillates markedly , similar to the pulsars in 47  tuc .",
    "the orbital solution gives @xmath25 hr and a minimum mass for the companion of @xmath26 ( assuming , as everywhere in this paper , that the pulsar mass is @xmath27 ) . according to these parameters",
    ", it resembles a msp@xmath28he - wd binary similar to those discovered in 47  tuc @xcite .",
    "amplification due to scintillation helped in the detection of four additional msps in the same cluster ( table  1 ) .",
    "all of them are isolated with spin periods in the range @xmath29 ms .",
    "another gc in which we have detected more than one msp is ngc 6266 .",
    "its distance is estimated with the fitting of horizontal branch ( hb ) stars ( @xmath30 kpc @xcite ) , but the high level of reddening makes this measurement largely uncertain .",
    "it is classified as core - collapsed but with ambiguities @xcite .",
    "re - examining all the rosat pointings , verbunt recently found a weak x - ray source , possibly interpreted as a quiescent soft x - ray transient@xcite .",
    "the first msp discovered here was psr  j1701@xmath030a @xcite , with a spin period of 5.24 ms , an orbital period of 3.8 days , and a mass function indicating a minimum companion mass of 0.19 m@xmath31 .",
    "apart from the longer @xmath32 this binary is similar to psr  1910@xmath059a , whereas the two other new systems , psrs  j1701@xmath030b and j1701@xmath030c , belong to the class of short - binaries with orbital periods of 3.8 hr and 5.2 hr ( table  1 ) .",
    "the close orbit of psr  j1701@xmath030b and the relatively high minimum companion mass cause significant variations of the acceleration term @xmath33 during an observation . in this case , only the use of code developed at bologna for searching both @xmath33 and the derivative of the acceleration , @xmath34 , allowed the recovery of enough signal from this weak source at the confirmation stage ( see figure  1 ) .",
    "ngc 6544 is one of the smallest gcs known : half of its mass is confined within @xmath35 pc ( at a distance of @xmath36 kpc , measured by hb - star - fitting @xcite ) .",
    "it displays the highest central luminosity density ( @xmath37 in logarithm of solar luminosities per cubic pc ) among the gcs having an associated pulsar ( it ranks second among the entire gc population @xcite ) .",
    "the pulsar discovered , psr  j1807@xmath02459 @xcite , has a fairly high flux density and was not detected in previous searches because of the relatively high dm = 134 @xmath6pc .",
    "timing performed at jodrell bank shows that it is part of an extremely compact binary , with an orbital period of only 1.7 hours ( the second shortest known ) and a projected semi - major axis of only @xmath38 .",
    "the corresponding minimum companion mass is only 0.009 m@xmath31 or about 10 jupiter masses ( the second smallest known ) and the orbital separation is @xmath39 if the orbital inclination angle @xmath40 is small , this system could be similar to the close systems ( msp+wd or msp+light not degenerate companion ) seen in 47  tuc @xcite , while if @xmath41 ( the a priori median of the possible inclinations ) the companion could be a sub - stellar object : a brown dwarf or a planet .",
    "0.3truecm      ngc 6397 is one of the most promising targets for searching msps in gcs : in fact , it is one of the closest clusters , at a distance of @xmath42 @xcite , and probably has a collapsed core with hints of mass segregation @xcite .",
    "it lies in fourth place in the list of gcs ranked according to central luminosity @xcite .",
    "moreover , it contains @xmath43 x - ray sources detected with _",
    "chandra _ within @xmath44 of the cluster center ,",
    "8 of which probably identified with cvs @xcite .",
    "0.3truecm    in this cluster we have discovered psr  j1740@xmath05340 , a binary msp with a spin period of 3.65 ms @xcite .",
    "it displays eclipses at 1.4 ghz for more than 40% of the orbital phase .",
    "this phenomenon is not uncommon ( 10 eclipsing systems containing a msp are known @xcite ) and in the case of psr  b1744@xmath024a@xcite the eclipses show duration and irregularities similar to those of psr  j1740@xmath05340 however this new system is @xmath45 times wider ( with an orbital separation of @xmath46 ) than any other known eclipsing pulsar binary , and has a heavier minimum mass for the companion ( @xmath47 0.19 m@xmath31 ) than any known eclipsing system . in addition , the radio signal exhibits striking irregularities ( delays and intensity variations ) over a wide range of orbital phases ( see figure  2 ) , indicating that the msp is orbiting within a large envelope of matter released from the companion with a high mass loss rate .",
    "these characteristics challenge the evaporation models from a degenerate companion , suggesting more likely that the companion is a bloated main - sequence star or the remnant of the star that spun up the msp@xcite .",
    "no millisecond pulsar with such peculiar companion is known to date .",
    "the detection of the pulsar in the x - ray band@xcite and the probable optical identification of the companion@xcite open also the possibility of extended follow - up observations which will probe the eclipse mechanism and the true nature of the companion in this very interesting system .      at a distance of @xmath48 @xcite and with galactic coordinates",
    "@xmath49 and @xmath50 , ngc 6522 is one of the gcs located near the bulge of the galaxy , only @xmath51 away from the center .",
    "it is classified as core - collapsed @xcite , but the most interesting dynamical feature resides in its orbit , which recently ( @xmath52 yr ago ) experienced a close encounter ( at @xmath53 pc ) with the milky way center .",
    "hence , ngc 6522 could have experienced dynamical shocks due to the time - variable gravitational potential of both the bulge and the inner disk of the galaxy @xcite .",
    "so far in this survey , this is the only gc for which the only pulsar detected has been an isolated msp , with a spin period of 7.1 ms@xcite .",
    "psr  j1803@xmath030 is in fact relatively strong and the previous surveys probably missed it due to its high dm = 192 @xmath6pc .",
    "the most recent discovery occurred in the cluster ngc 6441 .",
    "its large distance ( 11.2 kpc ) has been determined using rr lyrae as calibrators @xcite .",
    "it has a high central luminosity density but it is not classified as core - collapsed @xcite .",
    "it hosts a bright low mass x - ray binary , xb  1746@xmath0371 , whose optical companion has been likely identified at @xmath54 from the cluster center @xcite .",
    "it also contains one of the rare gc planetary nebulae , jafu 2 @xcite .",
    "here we have found a binary pulsar , psr  j1750@xmath037 , which has the second largest dm ( 233 @xmath6pc ) and the longest spin period , 111.6 ms , among all the known gc pulsars ( psr  b1718@xmath019 has an even longer period , but its inclusion in ngc 6342 is unlikely@xcite ) .",
    "after some months of timing , we have obtained an orbital solution ( see table  1 ) indicating that the system is large ( @xmath55 days ) , and in a highly eccentric orbit with @xmath56@xcite .",
    "the minimum companion mass ( @xmath57 ) suggests it could be a binary comprising a massive wd or a second ns .",
    "after two years of observations and processing of data , we have discovered 12 new pulsars in 6 gcs , increasing the total sample of such pulsars by about 25% : there are now 54 .",
    "we are timing all the new sources and within a few months will derive precise celestial coordinates for most of them . with these discoveries ,",
    "we have also increased by about 50% the number of clusters ( now 18 ) having at least one associated pulsar , and for which we have therefore also a good estimate of the dm .",
    "the consequent reduction in the number of unknown search parameters will make computationally feasible a future even deeper investigation of the pulsar content of these stellar systems , allowing a more reliable study of its dependence on other gc parameters such as mass , concentration , central stellar density , dynamic state and orbit in the galaxy .    to date",
    "we have not obtained any pulsar detection in about 30 observed gcs .",
    "our plan is to re - observe all of them .",
    "indeed , the present experiment suggests that , besides sensitivity and powerful search algorithms , a key strategy in a search for gc - msps is to devote a large amount of observing time to each target .",
    "scintillation in low dm clusters , long eclipses , and unfavorable orbital phases in the case of ultra - short binaries , might easily prevent detection during a single observation .",
    "for a subset of promising gcs we will also start a massive multidimensional coherent search in acceleration for a very large number of dm trials , exploiting the computing facilities available at the cineca supercomputing center near bologna .",
