    "a number of limits on variation of @xmath7 have been obtained recently from consideration of big bang nucleosynthesis , quasar absorption spectra and the oklo natural nuclear reactor which was active about 1.8 billion years ago @xcite .    below we consider the limits which follow from laboratory atomic clock comparisons .",

    "the increase in precision is very fast .",
    "as pointed out by @xcite , measurements of the ratio of hyperfine structure intervals in different atoms are sensitive to variation of nuclear magnetic moments .",
    "the first rough estimates of the dependence of nuclear magnetic moments on @xmath99 and limits on time variation of this ratio were obtained in @xcite . using h , cs and hg@xmath8 measurements @xcite ,",

    "if we neglect the spin - orbit interaction , the total spin of nucleons is conserved .",
    "the magnetic moment of the nucleus changes due to the spin - spin interaction because the valence proton transfers part of its spin , @xmath141 , to core neutrons ( transfer of spin from the valence proton to core protons does not change the magnetic moment ) .",
    "in this approximation , @xmath142 for the valence proton ( or @xmath143 for the valence neutron ) .",

    "note also that it follows from ( [ 09gp],[09gn ] ) that @xmath147 .",
    "this produces an additional suppression of the mixing s effect , indicating that the actual accuracy of the single - particle approximation for the effect of the spin @xmath37-factor variation may be as good as 10% .",
