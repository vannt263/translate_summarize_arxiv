    "the combination of gaia astrometric data with the spectroscopic follow - up will allow us to improve our knowledge on exoplanets : astrometry and spectroscopy are complementary and the synergy of these two methods is really useful to study exoplanets ( e.g.@xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "because of the nature of the spectroscopic ( radial velocity ) method , only a lower limit on the planet mass is known from specroscopic measurements alone .",
    "instead , the astrometry determines the inclination of the orbital plane with respect to the plane of the sky which is unresolved in radial velocity . for this reason , combining radial velocity with astrometry we could calculate the mass of the planet and hence with gaia we expect to improve the current landscape by adding thousands of new planets ( @xcite ) . + but not only !",
    "astrometry searches for long@xmath0period planets around nearby stars of all spectral types .",
    "the spectral type , metallicity , and the rotational velocity of the star do not strongly condition the astromeric precision ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , astrometry can detect giant planets around active young stars , while for the rv , in principle , is more difficult due to the noise in the spectrum ( @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , the sensitivity of astrometry and rv to planetary signals is highly complementary .",
    "the first one is more sensitive to planets far from the star ( signal scales linearly with the semimajor axis @xmath1 , while the second one is more sensitive to planets close to the star signal scales with @xmath2 ) . on the contrary , the radial velocity method is more sensitive than astrometry in detecting low - mass planets , particularly thanks to the new generation of high - precision instruments , such as harps and harps - n ( @xcite , @xcite ) . in preparation for gaia , a recent study gauged the combinatory power of hipparcos astrometry and precision rvs on a sample of metal - poor binaries ( @xcite ) + spectroscopy is a powerful tool which can be used not only to detect a planet ( via rv measurements ) , but also to characterize the host stars .",
    "in addition to a precise characterization of the planets , it is very important to collect information on their parent stars and having new several thousand of giant planets detections , thanks to gaia , and knowing well the properties of the parent stars from the spectroscopy and astrometry , we will be able to investigate their characteristics as a function of stellar mass , metallicity , age , etc .. it is for instance known that the stellar properties influence both the frequency and properties of the known planets , a fact that has important consequences for the models of planet formation and evolution ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "note that here the role of gaia will be huge too .",
    "for instance , gaia parallaxes will allow to calculate precise surface gravities for the stars ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "waiting for gaia data , we studied giant stars screened for planets in rv surveys in the context of the coralie ( @xcite ) extrasolar planet search program analyzing the stellar parameters ( effective temperature , microturbolence , surface gravity and metallicity ) and also chemical abundances for 12 elements ( na , mg , al , si , ca , ti , cr , ni , co , sc , mn and v ) in their atmospheres . since the sample is part of a planet search program using radial velocities , the goal of this study is to explore the star - planet connection ( frequency , properties ) for planets orbiting giant stars . in the meanwhile , the sample allows us to study the chemical evolution of the galaxy .",
    "the stars in the sample have effective temperatures 4700 @xmath3 teff @xmath3 5600 k , surface gravities 2.2 @xmath3 log@xmath4 @xmath3 3.7 dex , microturbulence 1 @xmath3 @xmath5 @xmath3 3.2 km s@xmath6 and they lie in the metallicity range of @xmath7 @xmath3 [ fe / h ] @xmath3 0.3 dex ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "[ fig : c4_14 ] we present the dependence of [ x / fe ] on metallicity for our sample of giant stars and for fgk dwarf stars from @xcite to study the galactic chemical evolution .",
    "as one can see , for all the elements the general behavior of [ x / fe ] with the metallicity is similar for giant and dwarf stars , and reflects the galactic chemical evolution in the solar neighborhood .",
    "the largest offset is seen for na and mn , and a bit less in si and al .",
    "the mn abundance was obtained by using only one line and it should be considered with caution . moreover ,",
    "the scatter in [ mn / fe ] is very high , indicating unrealistic abundances for some fraction of the stars .",
    "+ to separate galactic stellar populations we applied both a kinematic and chemical approach . for the kinematic approach",
    ", the selection of the thin disk , thick disk and halo stars was found using the method described in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we found that most of our stars belong to the thin disk ( 96@xmath8 and 97@xmath8 ) .",
    "for the chemical approach we use the abundances of @xmath9-element since the thin and thick disk stars are also different in their @xmath9-element content at a given metallicity .",
    "the [ @xmath9/fe ] versus [ fe / h ] plot ( not shown ) for the sample stars confirms that most of our stars belong to the thin disk .    [ cols=\"^ \" , ]",
    "in summary , we found that for all the elements studied galactic chemical evolution trends are similar for giant and dwarf stars , while for some species [ x / fe ] values are shifted towards higher values at a fixed metallicity .",
    "our analyis confirms the overabundance of na ( also al and si to a lesser degree ) in giant stars compared to the field fgk dwarf stars from @xcite .",
    "our sample is manly composed by stars belonging to the thin disk and the analyzed sample includes still only one star with detected planetary companion . before a significant number of planets",
    "are detected , this sample can be used as a homogeneous comparison sample to study planet occurrence around giant stars .",
