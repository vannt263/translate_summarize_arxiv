    "entangled paired photons or biphotons provide an unprecedented tools for research in fundamental physics such as quantum information processing @xcite and tests of fundamentals of quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "biphotons produced from either spontaneous parametric down conversion ( spdc ) @xcite or atomic cascade transitions have already been used in optical experimental tests of fundamentals of quantum theory , and have demonstrated violations of bell s inequalities @xcite .",
    "most of experimental tests of the inequalities have involved the polarization entanglement .",
    "rarity and tapster @xcite have reported experiments with momentum entanglement of the beams .",
    "the experiment proposed by franson @xcite concerning a bell inequality for nonpolarization variables , relies on the entanglement of a continuous variable , energy .",
    "there are number of experimental realizations @xcite of the franson interferometer .",
    "et al_. @xcite have achieved sinusoidal fringes of the two - photon interference with visibility greater than @xmath1 .",
    "such high visibility is required to confirm violation of a bell - type inequality . in this paper",
    ", we propose a new type of two - photon beating experiment by using biphotons generated from a two - level system operating in the resonant - pumping case @xcite .",
    "recently , the coincidence counting rate of paired photons generated from a two - level atomic system exhibits a damped rabi oscillation and photon anti - bunching - like effect @xcite .",
    "these features are caused by the destructive interference between two types of biphoton generation [ or four - wave mixings ( fwms ) ]  sideband - sideband and central - central in the",
    "_ mollow triplet_. the two - photon state is therefore a coherent superposition of these two fwms .",
    "we have also emphasized that the coupling coefficients in the coupled field operators equations for paired - photon generation are different from those in the classical fwm equations in a two - level system @xcite .",
    "the two - photon wavepacket created in such a two - level system is generally a convolution of the phase matching and the third - order nonlinear susceptibility , as in the three - level @xcite and four - level @xcite double-@xmath2 systems .",
    "a further analysis shows that these two kinds of biphotons created in a two - level system are associated with different refractive indices @xcite .",
    "the linear optical response of the paired photons from two sidebands in the mollow triplet @xcite implies that these biphotons propagate with tunable refractive indices and vanishing absorption , while biphotons from the central component propagate with unity refraction of index .",
    "these different refractive indices induce a relative phase difference between the twin - photon propagation through the two - level medium , and play the same role as the pathway - length difference between the short - short ( s - s ) and long - long ( l - l ) in the original franson s experiment .",
    "it should be noted that two - photon interference disappears , if the detection system can spectrally distinguish these two fwm processes .",
    "such a filtering would destroy the biphoton generated by the sidebands ( or central components ) . on the other hand , the proposed experiment may be an interesting way of probing the quantum nature of the detection process .",
    "the interference should disappear when the separation of the mollow peaks approaches the fundamental timescales for photon absorption in the detector .",
    "the proposed two - photon beating experiment depends on the interference between the probability amplitudes of two types of biphotons emitted at various time from a two - level system . in the counter - propagating geometry",
    ", the two - photon interference has a symmetrically damped rabi oscillation with the oscillation period inversely proportional to the effective rabi frequency .",
    "moreover , due to the relative phase difference caused by the refractive indices of two types of biphotons , the visibility of the center part of the two - photon coincidence pattern can be altered from 0 to @xmath3 in the ideal case , by subtracting the linear rayleigh scattering of the input pump beam .",
    "this change indicates a switch between photon anti - bunching - like and photon bunching - like effects .",
    "alternatively , the interference between two types of fwms can be switched from destructive to constructive by changing the pump rabi frequency ( or the pump power ) , the length of the medium , and the atomic density .",
    "furthermore , because the proposed beating experiment has direct similarity with the franson interferometer , such a high visibility ( ideally , 100@xmath4 ) of the center part in the two - photon beating pattern , greater than 70.7@xmath4 as predicted by quantum mechanics , implies a violation of bell s inequality .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we describe the linear and nonlinear optical responses for different photon pairs generated in the mollow triplet . in sec .",
    "iii , we present the detailed analysis of the two - photon beatings using biphotons created from a two - level system .",
    "we emphasize that the two - photon state is a coherent superposition of two fwm processes , and paired photons produced from these processes experience different phases .",
    "the analog between the proposed experiment and the franson interferometer is built by analyzing the two - photon state .",
    "finally , we give our conclusions in sec .  iv .",
    "consider a medium of identical two - level _ atoms _ ( or _ molecules _ ) initially prepared in their ground level @xmath5 .",
    "we configure our system with presence of a retro - reflected pump beam . in this configuration , the generated paired photons",
    "are spontaneously emitted in opposite directions and are detected by two photodetectors d@xmath6 and d@xmath7 , as illustrated in fig .",
    "the strong pump field with angular frequency @xmath8 and rabi frequency @xmath9 is applied to the quantum transition @xmath10 with a detuning @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the atomic transition frequency .",
    "the atomic oscillators are driven into the nonlinear regime where the absorbed two counter - propagating pump photons are re - radiated at frequencies @xmath13 and @xmath14 as seen in fig .",

    "( [ eq : linear ] ) and ( [ eq : nonlinearity ] ) .",
    "it is imperative to examine the linear optical response of paired photons generated from the central or two sidebands in the mollow triplet and ascertain their propagation properties . in fig .",
    "1(d ) , we plot real ( red ) and imaginary ( blue ) parts of the linear susceptibility of the @xmath15 field [ eq .  ( [ eq : linear ] ) ] for the resonant pumping case .",
    "the slopes of the real part of @xmath29 directly govern the group velocities of paired photons crossing the medium while the imaginary part dictates types of spectral transmission windows .    as shown in fig .",
    "1(d ) , biphotons originating from the central component experience an anomalous dispersion inside the medium .",
    "consequently , photons generated from the central component undergo a superluminal propagation ( group velocity greater than @xmath30 , the speed of light in vacuum ) .",
    "this can be understood from the gain - assisted superluminal light propagation mechanism @xcite where the anomalous dispersion plays the dominant role .",
    "also shown in fig .",
    "1(d ) , near the region of the sideband frequencies @xmath31 the indices of refraction reach a maximum ( or minimum ) value and the absorption of the medium vanishes .",
    "in other words , paired photons originating from the two sidebands propagate with tunable refractive indices accompanied by vanishing absorption ( of the medium ) . for the photons originating from the central component",
    ", they propagate with unity index of refraction accompanied by ( strong ) absorption .",
    "this difference in refractive indices between the two types of biphotons generated from either central or sidebands serves as the pathway - length difference in the franson s experiment .",
    "in the case of spontaneous emission , the two - photon amplitude at the two photodetectors can in general be represented as @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the timing difference between two detectors , @xmath34 is the effective rabi frequency ( in the resonant pumping case as discussed in this paper , it is only determined by the pump rabi frequency ) , and @xmath35 is the annihilation operator of the free - space propagating electric field at detector d@xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) , respectively . in the second line of eq .",
    "( [ eq : state ] ) , the first term in the bracket implies that biphotons are produced from the central component @xmath38 ( which have the same frequency as the pump ) , and the second term stands for biphotons generated from two correlated sidebands @xmath39 ( whose central frequencies are peaked away from the pump frequency by @xmath40 and @xmath41 ) , respectively .",

    "the dispersion within the medium is @xmath50 , and the refractive index @xmath51 where @xmath52 represents the real part of the linear susceptibility @xmath53 . in the resonant pumping case ,",
    "@xmath52 at two sideband frequencies is opposite in sign : positive at @xmath54 but negative at @xmath55 [ fig .",
    "this property sets a useful region of the refractive index for two sidebands , i.e. , @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "we note that @xmath58 can be enhanced without absorption @xcite . if @xmath59 , however , @xmath60 becomes imaginary , indicating an evanescent exponentially decreasing field and destroying the efficiency of biphoton generation .",
    "( [ eq : state ] ) also shows that the two types of biphotons have different spectral widths @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",

    "( [ eq : state ] ) is physically different from that required in the franson experiment , the similarity between these two states offers another way to look at the path - entangled problem .",
    "one consequence is to examine the violation of bell - type inequality by studying the two - photon beatings .",

    "( [ eq : definition ] ) @xmath67 and @xmath68 are the quantum detection efficiencies of two detectors , and @xmath69 is the two - photon amplitude given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : state ] ) , respectively .",
    "now we concentrate on the experimental setup shown in fig .",

    "( [ eq : state ] ) give @xmath71.\\label{eq : coin1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the physics of eq .",
    "( [ eq : coin1 ] ) is easy to be understood as follows : the first term corresponds to the correlation of biphotons from the central component in the mollow triplet , the second term to the correlation of biphotons from two sidebands , and the third term to an interference between two previous correlations .",
    "considering the beating experiment proposed here , an alternative explanation of eq .",
    "( [ eq : coin1 ] ) can therefore be visualized as the first term gives the intensity of the biphotons following the short - short pathway in the franson experiment , the second term gives the intensity of the biphotons following the long - long pathway , and the third term is the interference between the two biphotons .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : coin1 ] ) shows that the pattern of the two - photon interference is a damped rabi oscillation where the oscillation frequency is the effective rabi frequency @xmath40 and the damping rate is determined by the linewidths in the mollow triplet . by subtracting accidental coincidences from the pump",
    ", the visibility in the center part of @xmath72 can be changed between 0 and 1 by manipulating @xmath44 .",
    "this change indicates a switch occurrence from photon anti - bunching - like effect to bunching - like effect .",
    "alternatively , the interference occurring between two types of fwm processes can be switched from destructive to constructive , similar as the discussions presented in the case of a three - level double-@xmath2 system @xcite .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : coin1 ] ) can be also written as @xmath73-\\cos(\\omega_e\\tau-\\phi)\\}e^{-(\\gamma_g+\\gamma_2)\\tau},\\label{eq : coin2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath74 is a hyperbolic function . if @xmath75 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : coin2 ] ) reduces to a simple form @xmath76e^{-2\\gamma\\tau}.\\label{eq : coin3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    without the background noise , the two - photon temporal correlation is shown in fig .  2 .",
    "by adjusting the pump rabi frequency , the atomic density , and the length of the medium , one can manipulate the center part in the two - photon interference ( or beating ) pattern .",
    "the ( red ) dotted line represents result using a weaker pump while the ( blue ) solid line represents a stronger pump case .",
    "the oscillation period using a weaker pump power is slower than that with a stronger pump power . the central parts ( which are highlighted by a green rectangular ) of the beating interference patterns are different : the ( red ) dotted curve almost goes to zero , indicating that the relative phase difference @xmath44 in this case is negligible ; while the ( blue ) solid line is above zero , indicating that @xmath44 plays a major role in such a case .",
    "hence , by changing the pump power , the range of the visibility in the center part is ranged from one to zero . as discussed in many papers @xcite",
    ", 50@xmath4 is the maximum visibility possible in a classical field approach to this sort of experiment .        before proceeding the discussion , we note that a narrower filter would destroy the interference effect here .",
    "however , since the mollow triplet separation is tunable , this experiment may provide an interesting way of probing the quantum nature of the detection process .",
    "the interference will disappear when the separation of the mollow peaks approaches the fundamental timescales for photon absorption in the detector .",
    "to realize this beating experiment , the natural bandwidth of biphotons from the phase matching conditions should be made larger than the linewidths of the mollow triplet so that the intrinsic mechanism of biphoton generation is not erased by the phase matching .",
    "experimentally , the optical depth of the medium should be small such that the two - photon wavepacket is determined by @xmath77 and not by the phase matching @xcite .",
    "realistically , two potential candidate configurations may be chosen as candidates for this type of experiment : ( 1 ) the system of cavity enhanced quantum dots , and ( 2 ) the laser cooled and trapped atomic ensemble .",
    "however , when operating in the resonant pumping case , ( 2 ) imposes a tougher challenge because atoms are often  kicked out \" of the trapping volume and this leads to the absorption dominant in the process . to avoid such problems",
    ", it may be advantageous to work with blue - detuned and red - detuned pumping arrangements .",
    "in summary , a new beating experiment is proposed by using paired photons generated from a two - level system in the resonant pumping configuration .",
    "the mollow triplet in the third - order nonlinear susceptibility indicates that two types of biphotons are created in the parametric interaction .",
    "the linear response to two types of biphotons allows tunable refractive indices with vanishing absorption to two sidebands in the mollow triplet while as a unity index of refraction to the central component .",
    "the relative phase difference caused by different refractive indices is analogous to the interferometer proposed by franson . by manipulating the pump power , the length of the material , and the atomic density , the visibility of the center part in the two - photon beating interference can be changed for 0 to 1 by subtracting background coincidences from the linear rayleigh scattering of the pump beam .",
    "the observed interference pattern shows a switch from the destructive interference to the constructive in the fwm processes .",
    "although the experiment is difficult , it is definitely possible to observe the nonzero effect in the center part of the beating pattern in the current labs .",
    "in addition , the experiment may be a way of probing the quantum nature of the detection process , since the interference will disappear when the separation of the mollow peaks approaches the fundamental timescales for photon absorption in the detector .",
