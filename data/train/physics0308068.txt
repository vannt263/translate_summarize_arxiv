    "the diffusion of classical particles in the presence of traps have been studied by various authors @xcite .",
    "the idea of imperfect traps was introduced in @xcite and elaborated further by others @xcite which study , especially , the nearest neighbours distance in the presence of a single imperfect trap .",
    "we note that the imperfect trap may represent a model for many real physical situations that are not easy to tackle directly . among these",
    "one may enumerate all the reactions , including the chemical ones , in which the results for the reacting particles can not be predicted beforehand .",
    "that is , these reactions may result in either the elimination of some of the reacting particles or changing the values of some physical parameters that are associated with them . among these parameters",
    "one may mention , for example , the transmission and absorption coefficients of the diffusing particles , their energy and the other variables derived from it such as the specific heat , the entropy etc . in @xcite the transmission properties of these particles in the presence of @xmath1 imperfect traps , without any external field ,",
    "were intensively discussed for both cases of large and small @xmath1 . it was found @xcite that the larger is @xmath1 the higher is the transmission so that for @xmath2 the probability that all the particles diffuse through all the traps tends to unity .    in this work",
    "we include an external field to each trap and find the effect of it upon the diffusing particles .",
    "we note that the case of a bias field in the presence of a single imperfect trap at the origin was discussed by condat _",
    "et al _ in @xcite which studied among other things the effect of a uniform field on the distribution of nearest neighbours distances . in this work",
    "we introduce the bounded multitrap system and discuss not only the trasmission that results from including an external field to each trap but also the energy associated with the diffusing particles .",
    "this energy is discussed for both cases of the existence and absence of a field and we show that it is highly sensitive to the presence of it so that increasing its intensity by a small amount may result in a disproportionally large change in the energies of the diffusing particles .",
    "we note that although the physical situation is not strictly of the equilibrium kind we follow the tendency of many authors @xcite to discuss phase transition and specific heat even at situations which are far from equilibrium . in this context",
    "we note that it is well known that diffusion on a lattice can be mapped onto an equilibrium polymer problem @xcite .",
    "note that the imperfect traps , which introduces the diffusivity in the multitrap system , are characterized here by a rather small constant trapping rate ( denoted by @xmath3 ) as may be seen from the numerical work in which we assume @xmath4 compared to the value of @xmath5 for the ideal traps .",
    "thus , the bounded multitrap array deviates only slightly from equilibrium . also , the fields added to this equations are entirely _ uniform _ as realized from the numerical part of this work .",
    "we may , therefore , discuss the specific heat and other thermodynamical variables .",
    "we show in the following that the mentioned large changes in the energy entail , for certain values of the parameters associated with the multitrap system , corresponding large and even discontinuous changes in the specific heat @xmath0 derived from it .",
    "that is , the specific heat actually goes through phase transition which is demonstrated not only through the conventional undifferentiable single peak but also through double peaks @xcite .",
    "we note that double peak phase transitions were found @xcite in the analogous quantum one - dimensional bounded multibarrier potential .",
    "lieung and neda @xcite and also kim _ et al _ @xcite have found double peaks in the form of the responsive curves which are apparently associated with dynamically induced phase transitions .",
    "et al _ @xcite have found such double peaks in antiferromagnetic materials corresponding to magnetic phases where the external magnetic field has a corresponding role to the parameter @xmath6 here .",
    "ko and asakawa @xcite have found also double peaks with regards to the phases of the quark - gluon plasma which may be thought of as a large number of interactions in a bounded region .    in section 2 we represent the appropriate terminology and terms associated with the one - dimensional bounded imperfect multitrap system as in @xcite .",
    "we then show , using the @xmath1 @xmath7 transfer matrices method @xcite , that for certain values of the parameters associated with the multitrap system the transmission probability through all the traps tends to unity in the presence of an external field .",
    "this was shown @xcite , for the absence of field , by applying the same method . using the results of section 2 we calculate in section 3 the energy associated with the diffusing particles for both cases of the presence and absence of a bias field .",
    "for this we use the single @xmath8 transfer matrix ( as done in @xcite ) for calculating the coefficients of the density of the diffusing particles . in section 4",
    "we calculate the relevant specific heat @xmath0 and show that for certain values of the variables associated with the bounded system it behaves in a manner which is suggestive of phase transition .",
    "this is demonstrated in the presence of an undifferentiable discontinuous peaks in the curves of @xmath0 as function of the temperature .",
    "moreover , as noted , we find for some values of the relevant variables that this phase transition is demonstrated in the form of double peaks .",
    "we then calculate the relevant critical exponents associated with these phase transitions . in section 5",
    "we conclude with a brief summary .",
    "we assume that the imperfect traps , through which the particles diffuse , are all characterized by the same width that depends upon their number @xmath1 and the length @xmath9 of the system . that is , denoting the total width of the @xmath1 traps by @xmath10 and the total interval among them by @xmath11 we can see that the width of each is @xmath12 and the interval between any two neighbours is @xmath13 .",
    "we define as in @xcite the ratio @xmath14 and express @xmath10 and @xmath11 in terms of @xmath6 and the total length @xmath15 as @xmath16 .",
    "the one - dimensional imperfect multibarrier system is assumed to be arrayed along the positive @xmath17 axis so that it begins from the point @xmath18 and ends at @xmath19 .",
    "we also assume that at @xmath20 the particles are concentrated , except for an initial configuration @xmath21 , at the left hand faces of the @xmath1 traps .",
    "the locations of these faces , according to the mentioned arrangement of the multitrap system , is given by @xmath22 it is assumed that each trap have the same field associated with it so that any particle that approach it may be , depending on the direction of the field , either attracted or repelled by it .",
    "the corresponding initial and boundary balue problem associated with the one - dimensional bounded imperfect @xmath1 trap system is @xcite @xmath23 where @xmath24 denotes the left hand face of the @xmath25-th trap ( see eq ( [ e1 ] ) ) .",
    "@xmath26 is the density of the diffusing particles and @xmath27 is the diffusion constant which is considered to have two values ; @xmath28 inside the traps and @xmath29 outside them @xcite .",
    "we note that one may generally find in the literature values of @xmath27 in the range @xmath30 ( see , for example , p. 337 in @xcite",
    "where it is noted that @xmath31 is the order of magnitude of @xmath27 at room temperature and atmospheric pressure ) .",
    "we have assigned here for @xmath29 and @xmath28 the respective values of @xmath32 and @xmath33 . @xmath34 and @xmath35 are respectively the first time derivative and the second spatial derivative .",
    "the parameter @xmath36 is the diffusion velocity that results from the presence of the field and its magnitude and sign represent respectively the intensity and direction of the field .",
    "the second equation of the set ( [ e2 ] ) is the initial condition at @xmath20 the first term of it signifies , through the @xmath37 , that there is an initial concentration of the particles at the left hand face of the trap located at @xmath38 .",
    "the second term at the right hand side denotes an additional initial configuration of the density that depends upon @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "the third equation is the boundary value condition which introduces the velocity @xmath36 that results from the field .",
    "the parameter @xmath3 denotes the degree of imperfection of the traps ( in @xcite it is termed the trapping rate ) so that in the limit @xmath41 the trap becomes ideal in which case any particle that approaches it is absorbed .",
    "we follow the procedure in @xcite for @xmath42 and decompose the set ( [ e2 ] ) into two secondary sets as follows @xmath43    @xmath44    the set ( [ e4 ] ) is the ideal trap problem in which no external field is present as may be realized from the absence of @xmath3 and @xmath36 .",
    "the set ( [ e3 ] ) is the imperfect trap problem which includes the external field and its initial condition contains only the first term of the corresponding condition of the general set ( [ e2 ] ) .",
    "the solution of ( [ e2 ] ) may be written as in @xcite ( see eq ( 4 ) there ) , @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the solution of the initial and boundary value problem of the set ( [ e3 ] ) and @xmath47 is that of ( [ e4 ] ) .",
    "the ideal trap problem of ( [ e4 ] ) is the same as that discussed in @xcite so , following the discussion there , we write for @xmath48 @xmath49 regarding @xmath46 we may follow condat _",
    "et al _ in @xcite , which discuss the problem ( [ e3 ] ) for the single trap at the origin , and write the solution for the multitrap case as @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the complementary error function defined as @xcite @xmath52 .",
    "in order to adapt the general solution ( [ e5 ] ) to the bounded @xmath1 multitrap system we may use , as in @xcite , either the @xmath1 @xmath7 transfer matrices method @xcite or the equivalent single @xmath8 transfer matrix formalism .",
    "we use in this section the @xmath1 @xmath7 transfer matrices method for @xmath53 and write the general matrix equation @xcite @xmath54 where the @xmath55 s and @xmath56 s are respectively the coefficients of the imperfect and ideal trap components from eq ( [ e5 ] ) .",
    "the @xmath1 @xmath57 s in eq ( [ e8 ] ) are all two - dimensional transfer matrices that differ from each other by the value of @xmath17 only @xcite .",
    "thus , a representative one which relates the two faces of the same trap that are located , for example , at @xmath58 and @xmath59 , where @xmath60 , may be written as @xcite @xmath61,\\ ] ] where @xcite @xmath62 @xmath63 @xmath64 @xmath65 the parameters @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 are given by ( compare with the @xmath42 case in @xcite ) @xmath69 @xmath70 @xmath71    in order to find the density @xmath72 from eq ( [ e5 ] ) at each point @xmath17 in the multitrap system we have to determine the coefficients @xmath55 and @xmath56 of the imperfect and ideal trap components at this point .",
    "if , for example , this point happens to fall at the @xmath25-th trap then one have to multiply @xmath25 transfer matrices each of the kind given by eqs ( [ e10])-([e13 ] ) .",
    "we denote the components of the two - dimensional matrix that results from such a product by @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 and those of any one of the multiplied @xmath25 matrices by @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 where @xmath81 .",
    "thus , as realized from eqs ( [ e10])-([e13 ] ) ( and from @xcite for @xmath42 ) , the components @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 may be expressed recursively as @xmath86    it is found that the component @xmath82 tends to unity for growing values of the variables @xmath1 or ( and ) @xmath6 .",
    "that is , the larger is either the number of traps or the intervals among them ( or both ) the higher is the tendency of the component @xmath82 to unity .",
    "note that the same result have been found also in @xcite for @xmath42 with respect to the same variables @xmath1 and @xmath6 ( see the discussion there after eq ( 30 ) ) .",
    "we also find regarding the variable @xmath36 that the lower its value is the smaller becomes @xmath82 .",
    "the same result of small @xmath82 is obtained also for negative @xmath36 .",
    "we also find that @xmath87 for growing values of the total length @xmath9 and tends to unity for small values of it . also , @xmath82 increases for larger values of either the time @xmath88 or @xmath24 .",
    "regarding the component @xmath89 we find that it does not assume values outside the range @xmath90 . also , its factors @xmath91 satisfy @xmath92 for @xmath93 and @xmath94 for @xmath95 ( see in @xcite eq ( 26 ) and the unnumbered equation after eq ( 27 ) ) .",
    "thus , at large @xmath1 , the product @xmath89 also tends to either unity or 0 .",
    "we also find for small @xmath6 that the larger is either the number of traps @xmath1 or the time @xmath88 the more apparently @xmath85 tends to zero and this holds also for small values of @xmath9 .",
    "when , however , @xmath6 increases @xmath85 clearly tends to unity .",
    "note that @xmath89 does not depend upon the variable @xmath36 as seen from eqs ( [ e13 ] ) and ( [ e16 ] ) .",
    "the component @xmath84 may generally have any value from @xmath96 but there are specific ranges of @xmath1 , @xmath9 , @xmath6 , @xmath36 , @xmath3 and @xmath88 for which @xmath84 tends to zero .",
    "thus , it is found for growing @xmath6 that @xmath84 decreases fastly to zero if the increasing values of @xmath6 are small and slowly if these values are large .",
    "for example , increasing @xmath6 in the range @xmath97 causes @xmath84 to decrease so slowly that it may be regarded as almost constant over this range .",
    "we find that @xmath84 assumes very high values for either large @xmath1 or small @xmath9 but when @xmath9 grows to a value which is comparable to that of @xmath1 the component @xmath84 may even decrease to zero .",
    "it is also found that the larger is @xmath36 the smaller become the corresponding values of @xmath84 .",
    "for example , for @xmath98 @xmath84 assumes very small values of the order of @xmath99 but when @xmath36 decreases below 20 the value of @xmath84 becomes very large .",
    "negative values of @xmath36 have similar effect on @xmath84 as the corresponding positive ones .",
    "also , @xmath84 increases for larger values of the time @xmath88 and decreases for small @xmath24 .",
    "we , thus , find that there are ranges of @xmath1 , @xmath9 , @xmath6 , @xmath36 , @xmath3 and @xmath88 for which the components of the total matrix @xmath100 , that result from the @xmath1 products at the right hand side of eq ( [ e8 ] ) , assume the values of @xmath101 , @xmath102 and @xmath103 . in this case",
    "all the diffusing particles pass through all the traps in which case the transmission is maximal .",
    "that is , the ideal and imperfect trap components of the initial density do not change by the presence of either the traps or the fields ( or both ) in which case the product of the @xmath1 transfer matrices at the right hand side of eq ( [ e8 ] ) results in the two - dimensional unity matrix .",
    "this is seen in figure 1 which is composed of the three panels @xmath104 which respectively show three - dimensional surfaces of the components @xmath82 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 as functions of @xmath6 and @xmath1 .",
    "all the three panels are drawn for @xmath105 , @xmath4 , @xmath106 , @xmath107 , @xmath108 and @xmath109 and for the same ranges of @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "panel @xmath55 shows the component @xmath82 and one may see that for large values of @xmath6 and @xmath1 @xmath112 .",
    "the same result is obtained also in panel @xmath113 for the component @xmath89 whereas in panel @xmath56 we see that for large values of @xmath6 and @xmath1 the component @xmath84 tends to zero .",
    "thus , subtituting these values in eq ( [ e8 ] ) and using the fact that one always have @xcite @xmath114 we obtain @xmath115 that is , all the particles that approach the multitrap system pass through it without any decrease in either the ideal or the imperfect trap components of the density .",
    "note that for @xmath42 we have shown in @xcite this unity value of the transmission for the imperfect trap component of the density ( see eq ( 28 ) there ) and the same result is obtained in @xcite for the ideal trap component .",
    "we , now , discuss the energy associated with the diffusing particles in the presence of an external field .",
    "we do this by following the conventional discussion one may find in the literature regarding diffusive systems in the absence of external fields ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "the presence of the field introduces an additional source of energy ( besides that related to the diffusion through the traps ) which must be taken care of by adding an extra term ( to the kinetic energy ) that depends upon the velocity @xmath36 .",
    "we , thus , assume that the total energy is composed of two parts ; kinetic and potential where the former results from the diffusive motion and the external field and the later from the presence of the traps . in the absence of any external field the particles diffuse with an average diffusion velocity @xmath116 given , for the one - dimensional case , by @xcite @xmath117 where @xmath27 is the diffusion constant .",
    "note that since the two densities inside and outside the traps satisfy @xmath118 then also the diffusion velocity @xmath116 and the general density @xmath119 from eq ( [ e5 ] ) satisfy @xmath120 and @xmath121 .",
    "as remarked , the natural diffusive motion for @xmath42 is towards the positive @xmath17 axis so when a field is present and points in that direction it accelerates the motion of the particles or decelerates it if it is oppositely directed .",
    "thus , we may write the kinetic energy of the diffusing particles as @xmath122 where @xmath123 and @xmath124 are given by eqs ( [ e6])-([e7 ] ) . @xmath36 is , as remarked , the velocity that results from the external field and the plus and minus signs in front of @xmath125 denote respectively that the kinetic energy due to the field is either added for @xmath126 or subtracted when @xmath127 from that due to @xmath116 .",
    "note that for large @xmath88 the kinetic energy from the last equation becomes zero since in this case both @xmath128 and @xmath129 vanishes as realized from eqs ( [ e6])-([e7 ] ) .    by following the conventional discussion of the energy in classical diffusive systems @xcite we may conclude that the force that acts on the particles is related to the potential energy which originates from the presence of the traps .",
    "this force is assumed to be proportional to the trapping rate @xmath3 so for very large @xmath3 ( ideal traps ) it assumes maximal values and for @xmath130 ( absence of traps ) it vanishes . also , since we have always assigned throughout this work a rather small value of unity for @xmath3 which means that the imperfect traps have weak influence upon the particles we correspondingly assume an inverse proportionality of the force to the * squared * distance of the particles from the traps .",
    "this means , as remarked , that the particles feel the effect of the traps only at small distances from the traps .",
    "thus , one may write the force on any particle that results from the trap as @xmath131 , where @xmath132 is the proportionality constant and the minus sign indicates an attractive force . thus , assuming that each trap serves as a central force source one may find the potential energy from @xmath133 where we assume that the reference point @xmath134 is at infinity . thus , we may write the total energy of the diffusing particles in the presence of field as @xmath135 where @xmath136 and @xmath137 are given respectively by eqs ( [ e19 ] ) and ( [ e20 ] ) . in the absence of an external field",
    "the total energy is @xmath138 where @xmath139 is the imperfect trap component of the density for @xmath42 and is given as @xmath140 ( see eq ( 6 ) in @xcite ) . @xmath141 and @xmath142",
    "are given respectively by eqs ( [ e6 ] ) and ( [ e20 ] ) .",
    "the coefficients @xmath55 and @xmath56 in the last two equations are numerically determined in this section from the single @xmath8 matrix method ( see the discussion after eq ( 29 ) in @xcite ) .",
    "we now show that increasing @xmath143 by even a small amount may change the energy in such an unexpected manner that it results , as seen in the following section , in a phase transition of the corresponding specific heat @xmath0 .",
    "this may realized form panels @xmath55-@xmath27 of figure 2 which all show three dimensional surfaces of the energy @xmath144 as function of @xmath17 and @xmath6 .",
    "panels @xmath55 and @xmath56 are both drawn for @xmath145 , @xmath146 , @xmath147 , @xmath148 , @xmath106 , @xmath107 , @xmath149 , @xmath150 and differ by the value of @xmath36 which is 2 for panel @xmath55 and 5 for @xmath56 .",
    "thus , by comparing between them one may realize that increasing @xmath36 by only 3 units causes to a disproportionally large increase of @xmath144 from @xmath151 in panel @xmath55 to @xmath152 in @xmath56 .",
    "this large jump of the energy entails a corresponding discontinuous change in the values of the specific heat @xmath0 which implies , as will be shown , that it goes through a phase transition .",
    "the same result is obtained also for negative @xmath36 but compared to @xmath126 the changes obtained are larger and found at smaller values of negative @xmath36 .",
    "this may be seen in panels @xmath113 and @xmath27 of figure 2 which are both drawn for @xmath153 , @xmath154 , @xmath155 , @xmath148 , @xmath106 , @xmath107 , @xmath149 , @xmath150 and differ by @xmath36 which is @xmath156 for panel @xmath113 and @xmath157 for @xmath27 .",
    "thus , by comparing these two panels one may realize that decreasing @xmath36 by only three tenths from @xmath156 to @xmath157 results in a giant change of the energy from @xmath158 in panel @xmath113 to @xmath159 in @xmath27 .",
    "this entails , as will be shown in the following section , a corresponding phase transition of the specific heat @xmath0 .",
    "one may explain these large changes of the energy by reasoning that increasing the intensity of the field @xmath143 beyond some limit causes the particles to overcome any resistance related to the diffusion in the presence of traps .",
    "thus , their energy increases disproportionally to the change of @xmath143 that causes it .",
    "a similar behaviour is encountered in laser tubes @xcite when the pumping energy ( field ) attains a limit value which causes the intensity of the produced light to increase in a phase transitsional manner .",
    "it is expected , regarding the dependence of the energy upon the trapping rate @xmath3 , that the larger @xmath3 becomes the more controlled will be the diffusing particles by the traps in which case the kinetic ( and the total ) energy of these particles decrease .",
    "this is shown from recalling that for @xmath160 , @xmath161 and @xmath150 we have obtained that the larger values of the energy are @xmath152 .",
    "now , it have been , numerically , found ( not shown ) that if @xmath3 is raised from @xmath4 to @xmath162 , keeping the values of all the other parameters as before , the larger values of the energy are decreased to @xmath163 . when @xmath164 we find that @xmath165 and for @xmath166 the larger @xmath144 further decrease to @xmath167 .",
    "a similar behaviour of decreasing energies for larger @xmath3 is found also for negative @xmath36 .",
    "the average energy from which one may derive most of the statistical mechanics variables such as the specific heat @xmath0 , the free energy @xmath168 , the entropy @xmath169 etc may be written as @xmath170 where @xmath171 , @xmath172 is the boltzman constant and @xmath173 is the temperature in kelvin units . substituting in the former equation the appropriate expression for @xmath174 from eq ( [ e21 ] ) or ( [ e23 ] ) yields respectively the average energy for the presence or absence of an external field . from the expression of the average energy @xmath175",
    "we obtain the specific heat @xmath0 @xmath176 figure 3 shows a three dimensional surface of @xmath0 from eq ( [ e23 ] ) as function of the ratio @xmath6 and the temperature @xmath173 where no external field is present in which case the appropriate energy to be substituted in the last equation is that from eq ( [ e22 ] ) .",
    "figure 3 is drawn for @xmath145 , @xmath4 , @xmath148 , @xmath108 , @xmath177 , @xmath146 , @xmath149 and @xmath178 . as seen , the height of the surface for @xmath0 increases with growing values of the ratio @xmath6 untill some maximum ( not shown in the figure ) .",
    "one may also realize that at small values of @xmath6 and @xmath173 the surface of @xmath0 jumps upward to its local maximal values from which it descends in a similar manner to zero .",
    "these local maxima are seen to be arrayed along horizontal lines which form , in relation to their neighbouring lines , a sharp edge which becomes widened and flattened as @xmath6 grows .",
    "the epecific heat @xmath0 is certainly undifferentiable at the sharp edge so it goes through phase transition at these points @xcite .",
    "we calculate at the following the critical exponents @xmath179 @xcite associated with this and other discontinuities of @xmath0 .",
    "we find that increasing @xmath1 or @xmath3 or @xmath132 , while keeping the values of the other parameters constant , does not cause to any change in the form of @xmath0 shown in figure 3 except to its translation from its position along the @xmath6 axis to a one that tends to be aligned along the @xmath173 axis .",
    "that is , the same surface of @xmath0 is rotated in the @xmath180 plane for growing values of @xmath1 or @xmath3 or @xmath132 .",
    "if , on the other hand , the value of the total length @xmath9 is simultaneously increased with that of @xmath1 then the remarked rotation of the surface of @xmath0 , obtained for large values of @xmath1 , is avoided and this surface remain in its form and place . unlike the case of @xmath53 , to be discussed in the following , we find for @xmath42 that except for the remarked points of discontinuity associated with smaller values of @xmath6 and @xmath173 there are no other points at which @xmath0 becomes discontinuous .",
    "we discuss now the specific heat @xmath0 obtained when an external field is included with each trap .",
    "it is found , as for the @xmath42 case , that the corresponding curves of the specific heat @xmath0 jumps abruptly from zero for small @xmath6 and @xmath173 to their maximal values from which they similarly descend to zero .",
    "also , as for figure 3 , these maximal values are arranged along lines which form a sharp edge for small @xmath6 and @xmath173 which become widened and flattened as @xmath6 increases .",
    "the specific heat function is clearly undifferentiable along the sharp edge which implies , as for the @xmath42 case , that it goes through phase transition @xcite at these points .",
    "but , in contrast to the former case , there exist other points , not at small values of @xmath6 , for which the specific heat goes through phase transition .",
    "this is demonstrated in figure 4 which is drawn for @xmath181 , @xmath145 , @xmath155 , @xmath148 , @xmath146 and which is related not only to the more obvious discontinuity of the two spiky columns at small @xmath6 and @xmath173 but also to that of the apparently continuous surface at large @xmath6 s .",
    "this is clearly shown in figure 5 in which we isolate from the surface of figure 4 four curves of the specific heat @xmath0 as function of the temerature @xmath173 for @xmath182 .",
    "one can see that each curve of the four shown assumes the form of two inverted and indented tooth which are clearly undifferentiable and so they constitute a double - peak phase transition .",
    "we thus see , as remarked , that the unexpected large change in the values of the energy in panel @xmath56 of figure 2 , which is drawn for the same values of @xmath36 , @xmath1 , @xmath3 , @xmath9 , @xmath132 , @xmath88 , and @xmath24 as those of figures 4 - 5 , is affected through the double peak phase transition of the corresponding specific heat of figure 5 .",
    "this depends , as noted , upon the value of @xmath146 , so we expect that changing its value may result in finding double peaks phase transitions at other values of @xmath6 and @xmath1 .",
    "this is indeed the case as we find ( not shown here ) , for example , for @xmath183 , @xmath184 and @xmath154 , which is the location of the left hand face of the second trap .    from the former discussion",
    "we see that for positive values of @xmath36 there is associated a single peak for the smaller values of @xmath6 and a double peak for some higher values of it . when we consider , however , negative values of @xmath36 we find that the double peaks generally emerge for the smaller values of @xmath6 .",
    "this is demonstrated in the right hand panel of figure 6 which shows 2 curves of the specific heat @xmath0 as function of the temperature @xmath173 for @xmath185 , @xmath186 , @xmath148 , @xmath106 , @xmath107 , @xmath146 and for the two values of @xmath187 . in this case",
    "the first peaks of the two curves are small compared to the seconds .",
    "the left hand panel shows 8 double peaks curves of the specific heat as function of @xmath173 for @xmath154 , @xmath153 , @xmath188 , @xmath186 and @xmath189 .",
    "these phase transitions of @xmath0 correspond to the unexpected large change of the energy which is shown in panels @xmath113-@xmath27 of figure 2 for exactly these values of @xmath190 and in the neighbourhoud of @xmath191 .",
    "these panels demonstrate , as remarked , that slightly changing the value of @xmath36 in the neighbourhoud of @xmath191 by only three tenths changes the larger values of the energy from @xmath192 to @xmath193 .",
    "this change in the energy is demonstrated in the double peak phase transition shown in the left hand panel of figure 6 .",
    "note that all the eight first peaks , as well as all the second peaks , touch each other and seem as one curve .",
    "the appropriate energy to be associated with negative @xmath36 is that of the expression ( [ e21 ] ) in which one should take , as remarked , the minus sign in front of @xmath125 .",
    "we may suggest an explanation for the occurence of the mentioned large changes in the energy which entail the corresponding discontinuous peaks in the specific heat @xmath0 . we confine our attention to the discussed examples of @xmath145 and @xmath153 when one respectively changes from @xmath194 to @xmath181 and from @xmath191 to @xmath195 . as remarked",
    ", the change of @xmath36 for @xmath145 entails a change in the larger values of the energy from @xmath196 to @xmath152 .",
    "looking at the expression ( [ e19 ] ) for @xmath144 one may realize that the large increase in @xmath144 results from a corresponding increase of the imperfect density @xmath128 from eq ( [ e7 ] ) ( the ideal density @xmath129 does not depend upon @xmath36 and so it does not change with @xmath36 ( see eq ( [ e6 ] ) ) ) . as seen from eq ( [ e7 ] ) the dependence of @xmath128 upon @xmath36 is mainly exponential .",
    "thus , when @xmath36 changes from 2 to 5 we find for the ratio @xmath197 the value of @xmath198 where we use the same values used for all the other parameters that lead to panels @xmath55 and @xmath56 of figure 2 .",
    "that is , the density for @xmath181 has enormously grows in relation to that for @xmath194 .",
    "this is to be compared , for example , to water when one lower its temperature from the gaseous state to the liquid one in which case the density of the water molecules grows in a phase transitional manner .",
    "this behaviour is repeated when one continues to decrease the temperature to @xmath199 from the liquid state to the solid one in which case the density of the water molecules increases again in a phase transition manner .",
    "we have mentioned in the previous section the example of laser tubes for which the intensity of light increases greatly when the pumping energy ( corresponding to @xmath36 here ) attains a specific value .",
    "this occurs because a macroscopic aggregate of atoms have been transferred by the pumping energy into the appropriate laser state @xcite .",
    "a similar grow of the density occurs , as remarked , also here when one increases for @xmath145 the velocity @xmath36 from 2 to 5 .",
    "the double peaks shown in figure 6 which are associated with small negative @xmath36 may be explained by noting that the external diffusion constant employed here is @xmath29 is 0.8 ( the internal diffusion constant is even lower @xmath107 ) .",
    "that is , when one turns on an external field which is directed opposite to the diffusive motion then when the value of this field becomes @xmath195 it actually neutralizes and cancels the influence of the traps on the particles so that their energy becomes very large .",
    "the appearance of the double peaks for these values of @xmath36 demonstrates further ( more than the single peak ) the large change that the density and the energy have passed through when @xmath36 changes as described .",
    "we must , however , note that these peaks depend not only upon @xmath36 but also upon the other parameters , such as @xmath1 , @xmath200 , @xmath88 etc , that control the behaviour of @xmath144 .",
    "one may calculate the related critical exponents @xmath179 @xcite associated with these phase transitions by using the following equation in the neighbourhood of the critical temperature @xmath201 @xcite @xmath202 where @xmath203 and @xmath55 , @xmath56 are constant .",
    "the first order derivative of @xmath204 diverges at @xmath205 so the critical exponent @xmath179 may be obtained from @xcite @xmath206 where the unity term denotes the first order derivative @xmath207 of the specific heat with respect to @xmath208 .",
    "the value of @xmath179 may be obtained by plotting the curve of @xmath209 in the close neighbourhood of @xmath205 and one can see from figures 3 - 6 that @xmath179 assumes different values .",
    "thus , assigning to the constants @xmath55 , @xmath56 the respective values of 0 and 1 and plotting , as remarked , the graphs of @xmath209 in the immediate neighbourhoud of the single peaks in figure 3 , which are located at small @xmath6 and @xmath173 , one may calculate @xmath179 , using eqs ( [ e24])-([e25 ] ) , as @xmath210 .",
    "this value changes with respect to the single peaks of figure 4 which are also located at small @xmath6 and @xmath173 . that is , repeating the same procedure one may obtain the value of @xmath211 .",
    "for the eight first and second peaks in the left hand panel of figure 6 we find the respective values of @xmath212 and @xmath210 .",
    "the @xmath179 of the double peaks of figure 5 and also of the first peaks in the right hand panel of figure 6 is @xmath213 .    comparing the phase transition behaviour of the bounded one - dimensional multitrap system to that of the corresponding quantum array of the bounded one - dimensional multibarrier potential @xcite",
    "one may notice the following similarities and differences ; the specific heats of both systems exhibit the same discontinuous jump at small values of @xmath173 and @xmath6 but whereas in the multitrap system @xmath0 decreases , for growing values of @xmath173 , to zero the corresponding quantum @xmath0 does not vanish but tends , for large @xmath173 , to a finite value ( see figures 1 - 7 in @xcite ) . also , the phenomenon of the double peaks at which the specific heat @xmath0 is undifferentiable are discernable in both systems .",
    "the variation of the critical exponent @xmath179 may be explained by noticing from figures 3 - 6 that the different peaks shown in these figures correspond to different values of @xmath1 and @xmath6 .",
    "remembering that @xmath1 and @xmath6 respectively denote the number of traps and the ratio of their total interval to their total width one may realize that they , actually , control the shape and form of the multitrap system .",
    "that is , figures 3 - 6 with the different values of @xmath1 and @xmath6 actually correspond to * different systems * through which the particles pass and not to different parameters of the same system .",
    "thus , one may expect different values of the critical exponent to be associated with these different systems .",
    "we note , however , that the difference between these values is not large .    using the expressions ( [ e21])-([e22 ] ) for",
    "the energy one may obtain the other variables of statistical mechanics .",
    "for example , the free energy @xmath168 is calculated , for either the presence or absence of the external field , from @xcite @xmath214 .",
    "using the last equation one may write the entropy @xmath169 for the multitrap system @xcite @xmath215 as for the specific heat @xmath0 one may draw @xmath169 for different values of the parameters @xmath1 , @xmath3 , @xmath132 , @xmath24 , @xmath88 , @xmath9 and @xmath6 . if , for example , we draw the surface of @xmath169 for exactly the same values of the mentioned parameters as those of figure 4 one may see ( not shown here ) two separate lobes for small @xmath6 and @xmath173 which correspond to the two spiky columns of figure 4 .",
    "we have discussed the diffusion limited problem related to the bounded one - dimensional imperfect multitrap system in the presence of external field @xmath36 .",
    "the analytical methods previously used @xcite to discuss the transmission of the particles through this system in the absence of an external field were also used here in the presence of it .",
    "thus , the @xmath1 @xmath7 transfer matrices were used , as in @xcite , for discussing the transmission through the multitrap system for @xmath53 and the single @xmath8 transfer matrix for studying the energy and the corresponding specific heat @xmath0 .",
    "it has been found , as for the @xmath42 case in @xcite , that for certain values of the parameters associated with the system the transmission coefficient @xcite of the diffusing particles tends to unity when @xmath1 and @xmath6 become large in which case all the particles diffuse through all the traps .",
    "this has been shown not only for positive @xmath36 which pushes the particles towards the traps but also for negative values of it that repell the particles towards the negative direction of the @xmath17 axis .",
    "the unique characteristics of the mutitrap system become more unexpected regarding the energy of the diffusing particles in the presence of an external field .",
    "thus , it has been found that increasing @xmath36 , for either positive or negative values of it , by even a small amount results in a disproportionally large increase in the energy of the diffusing particles so that trying to calculate the related specific heat @xmath0 we find that it goes through phase transition .",
    "moreover , for certain values of the parameters associated with the multitrap system , such as its total length @xmath9 , the number of traps @xmath1 , the ratio @xmath6 , the time @xmath88 , the location @xmath24 at which the particles are initially concentrated and the field @xmath36 , one may find that the mentioned phase transition is demonstrated in the form of a double peak .",
    "the value of the related critical exponents associated with these phase transitions were found to vary between @xmath216 and @xmath217 .",
