    "over the past decades , astronomers have suspected that there might be a population of intermediate - mass black holes ( imbhs ) , which connect the stellar - mass black holes and the supermassive black holes . on the observational side , accretion of imbhs",
    "could be the energy source of some hyper - luminous x - ray sources ( hlxs ) , e.g. , the well - known hlx-1 @xcite .",
    "on the theoretical side , imbhs are expected to be formed in centers of globular clusters ( gcs ) ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) . some of these imbhs can be perfect candidates of first black hole seeds which eventually grow up to be smbhs via merge or accretion @xcite .",
    "others , however , may survive today .",
    "it is meaningful to search imbhs in gcs .",
    "one way to search imbhs in gcs is to apply a dynamical modeling : model kinematic data of gcs .",
    "many works have been done with this method ( for the results of some gcs , see table  1 ) .",
    "these works suggested that gcs harbor imbhs ( @xmath1 ) in their centers .",
    "another way to test the existence of imbhs in gcs is to detect the unique signatures emitted by surrounding accretion flows .",
    "unfortunately , the accretion rates to imbhs ( if imbhs do exist ) are expected to be extremely low since gcs have few gases .",
    "therefore , it is quite difficult to directly detect x - ray emission .",
    "@xcite suggested that radio observation could be a promising tool to probe imbhs in gcs .",
    "the idea is based on the scenario that there exists a universal correlation among the x - ray luminosity ( @xmath2 ) , the radio luminosity ( @xmath3 ) , and the mass of black hole ( @xmath4 ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* see also in section  2.1 ) .",
    "basically , this so - called fundamental plane relation suggests that the radio / x - ray ratio increases with @xmath4 .",
    "one can constrain the mass of an imbh by using the fundamental plane relation , radio observations and the accretion theory ( for the details , see section 2 ) .",
    "also , the upper mass limits of imbhs in gcs can be settled if radio observations do not detect any structures within the sensitivity of radio telescopes .",
    "recently , @xcite obtained the @xmath5 upper limits of radio luminosity in three gcs ( m15 , m19 , m22 ) with jvla observations .",
    "based on these data , they found that the corresponding upper limits of @xmath4 are too small for these gcs to harbor any imbhs .",
    "moreover , radio observations for other sources ( see table  1 ) also showed conflicts between the resulting upper limits of @xmath4 and the mass constrained via dynamical modelings ( for details , see discussions in * ? ? ? * and our figure  1 ) .",
    "this discrepancy indicates that either imbhs do not exist in gcs or the accretion onto imbhs is significantly weaker than that predicted by the theory .    in this work ,",
    "we take the role of outflows into consideration . as a consequence",
    ", the accretion rate onto imbhs ( and @xmath6 ) will be significantly lower than what previously predicted .",
    "on the other hand , all sources in table  1 seem to be in the quiescent state .",
    "the fundamental plane relation , as argued by @xcite , should steepen into a new relation which differs from the one suggested by , for example , @xcite .",
    "moreover , the fundamental plane relation , as mentioned by @xcite , seems to indicate that the x - ray emission should originate from the jet rather than the adaf . considering that the x - ray luminosity in this work and some previous works is estimated by the adaf solution",
    ", we therefore explore the validity of using the fundamental plane relation and the robustness of these results .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  2 , we briefly summarize previous works on this issue . in section  3 ,",
    "we compare our results with radio observations .",
    "summary and discussion are given in section  4 .",
    "in this section , we will discuss physics of constraining mass of imbhs from radio observations in a detailed way ( see also , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the first step is on the calculation of @xmath7 .",
    "previous works usually assume that the accretion rate is a fraction of bondi accretion rate , i.e. , @xmath8 ( e.g. , in * ? ? ?",
    "* @xmath9 ) .",
    "the bondi accretion is the spherical accretion starting from the bondi radius @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the speed of sound , and @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the ratio of specific heats , the boltzmann constant , the temperature of gases and the mass per particle , respectively . since the typical temperature of gases in gcs is around @xmath16 , we have @xmath17 , where @xmath18 , and @xmath19 is the schwarzschild radius .",
    "the corresponding bondi accretion rate is @xcite @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the mass density of gases ( in this work , we adopt @xmath22 @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 ) .    by knowing the accretion rate",
    ", one can now estimate @xmath2 according to the accretion theory .",
    "the eddington ratio of accretion rates is @xmath26 , where the eddington rate is defined as @xmath27 , and @xmath28 .",
    "therefore , the flow should be an advection - dominated accretion flow ( so - called `` adaf '' ) .",
    "the corresponding radiative efficiency @xmath29 usually ( although very roughly ) scales as @xmath30 , where near the imbh @xmath31 is the critical accretion rate of adafs .",
    "the bolometric luminosity is calculated by @xmath32 previous works usually use @xmath33",
    ". clearly , both of them are a function of the mass of imbhs .",
    "since @xmath2 scales as a function of @xmath4 , one can obtain a one - to - one relation between @xmath4 and @xmath6 by adopting the fundamental plane relation , @xmath34 where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are both in units of @xmath35 , and @xmath36 is in units of the solar mass .",
    "the parameters @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 are constrained by observations .",
    "equations  ( [ mb])-([fp ] ) reveal that the non - detection of radio signals in gcs provide an upper limit of @xmath36 .",
    "however , attentions should be paid on this method .",
    "the first thing is about @xmath7 near imbhs , where most of energy is released . on one hand , since @xmath40 at @xmath41 ( @xmath42 scales as @xmath43 , see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* where @xmath44 ) and the angular momentum of gases in gcs is low , adafs are likely to extend to @xmath41 .",
    "when the angular momentum of gases in adafs is considered , the actual accretion rate at @xmath45 is only a fraction of @xmath46 , i.e. , @xmath47 @xcite , where @xmath48 is the viscosity parameter . on the other hand ,",
    "adafs are likely to suffer significant outflows ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "following @xcite , outflows can be described by the following assumption : @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the outer radius of the adaf . in this work",
    "we assume @xmath51 .",
    "the parameter @xmath52 , which determines the strength of outflows in adafs , can not be self - determined by theoretical considerations .",
    "however , as pointed out by @xcite , some simulations ( both hydrodynamical and magnetic - hydrodynamical ) indicate @xmath53 ( observations of ngc 3115 also suggest @xmath54 , see * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , the accretion rate near the imbh is @xmath55 , which is smaller than that of @xcite ( who assumed that @xmath56 are accreted onto imbhs ) .",
    "another thing is on the estimation of @xmath29 , especially when adafs suffer outflows .",
    "recently , @xcite have done a detailed calculation on @xmath29 , which included the effects of outflows and found @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the accretion rate near the horizon of the black hole .",
    "the parameters @xmath59 and @xmath60 depend on the fraction of energy that directly heats electrons ( denoted by @xmath61 ) . for @xmath62 less than @xmath63 and @xmath64",
    ", @xcite shows @xmath65 and @xmath66 .    as seen from equation  ( [ fp ] ) , @xmath3 is sensitive to @xmath2 .",
    "the usually adopted @xmath2 in fitting the fundamental plane relation is in the range of @xmath67  kev ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which is only a fraction of the bolometric luminosity .",
    "this is because adaf is optically thin and the spectrum is not a blackbody type but roughly a flat spectrum over @xmath68 orders of magnitude ( from radio to hard x - ray ) in the @xmath69 diagram ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "it is therefore reasonable to assume @xmath70 with @xmath71 . in our opinion , @xmath2 in some previous works is overestimated .",
    "so far , we have argued that some modifications are required in determining mass of imbhs by radio observations . in the following section , we will apply these modifications and present our results .",
    "applying all the modifications discussed in section  2 , we can derive a new relation between @xmath3 and @xmath36 with equations  ( [ fp])-([lx ] ) and the definition of @xmath46 ( equation  [ mb ] ) , @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the ratio between @xmath58 and @xmath46 , and @xmath74 is the inner radius of outflows . following @xcite , we adopt @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "we assume @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "for the fundamental plane relation , we adopt the one fitted by @xcite , i.e. , @xmath79 , @xmath80 , and @xmath81 ( we choose this version of fundamental plane relation due to the following two reasons .",
    "first , the sample corresponding to this relation consists of sources with flat / inverted radio spectrum .",
    "when considering the radio observations of globular clusters , we usually assume a flat radio spectrum .",
    "second , this sample , as pointed out by * ? ? ?",
    "* minimizes the systematical bias of synchrotron cooling and thus can be considered as the most robust relation . ) . as for @xmath61",
    ", we choose two typical values @xmath82 and @xmath83 . note that with @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 , and @xmath87 , equation  ( [ re ] ) can recover the results of @xcite .",
    "now , we can use equation  ( [ re ] ) to testify whether the recent radio non - detection results can rule out the existence of imbhs in gcs or not .",
    "table  1 lists the information of some gcs which may harbor imbhs .",
    "@xmath3 listed in table  1 is the @xmath5 upper limit of radio luminosity constrained by radio observations .",
    "we calculate the predicted @xmath3 for each source by using equation  ( [ re ] ) and mass listed in table  1 , and compare them with radio observations .",
    "the mass of imbhs in table  1 was obtained by dynamical modelings .",
    "figure  1 plots @xmath6 as a function of @xmath4 .",
    "as shown by figure  1 , @xmath3 in our results are significantly lower than that of @xcite .",
    "the major reason is relevant to outflows .",
    "the actual accretion rates near imbhs are lower than that of @xcite .",
    "more importantly , for most sources @xmath3 in our results are obviously smaller than the @xmath5 upper limit of @xmath3 given by radio observations .",
    "thus , our results indicate that the current radio observations seem not to conflict with the dynamical modelings . in other words",
    ", imbhs may still exist in gcs .",
    "an interesting exception is @xmath88 cen . as seen from figure  1 , even in the presence of outflows ,",
    "the predicted @xmath3 is close to the @xmath5 upper limit of @xmath3 .",
    "therefore , @xmath88 cen is unlikely to harbor a @xmath89 imbh ( see the last section for more details ) .",
    "in addition , the thin solid line and the dotted line in figure  1 represents @xmath6 estimated by the @xmath90 relation instead of the fundamental plane relation .",
    "we will interpret these results in the following subsection .",
    "there are two issues we have to mention .",
    "the first issue is about the relatively large scatter in the fundamental plane relation .",
    "we will discuss this problem in the last section .",
    "the second one is the consistency of the assumptions that adopted in such an issue and previous works .",
    "the fundamental plane relation have been explored by many works .",
    "for instance , @xcite suggested that this relation can be explained in the framework that x - ray emission is predominantly from adafs whereas the radio emission is from jets .",
    "moreover , they argued that in the extremely low luminosity region this relation should break into a new one .",
    "the argument is that , below a critical x - ray luminosity , @xmath91 , the x - ray emission from the jet ( radiatively cooled ) should dominate over that from adafs ( so - called  quiescent state \" ) . in this spirit",
    ", all the sources in table  1 should locate in this quiescent state .",
    "it seems more appropriate to use the fundamental plane relation obtained by @xcite .",
    "note that there are two galactic black hole x - ray binaries ( bhxrbs ) , a0620 - 00 @xcite and v404 cyg @xcite , whose x - ray luminosity is well below the critical x - ray luminosity proposed by @xcite .",
    "the corresponding radio / x - ray correlation analyses are , however , inconsistent with the fundamental plane relation of @xcite . in our opinion , there are two possibilities for these inconsistent results . the first one may be related to a large scatter in determining @xmath92 ( at least for v404 ) , since @xmath92 was constrained by assuming that there is a smooth transition of the fundamental plane relation from the type of @xcite to that of @xcite at @xmath92 .",
    "actually , if the fundamental plane relation of @xcite and that of @xcite are used to constrain @xmath92 , one will find @xmath93 .",
    "the second possibility is related to the cooling of the jet .",
    "as mentioned by @xcite , their fundamental plane relation is based on the assumption that the jet should be radiatively cooled in the x - ray bands .",
    "however , for the above two sources , such an assumption may be invalid due to the following reason . according to the synchrotron cooling frequency ( under such circumstance ,",
    "the compton scattering can be neglected ) @xmath94 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , for low mass black holes and low accretion rates , the jet of the bhxrb may be uncooled .    on the other hand , at higher x - ray luminosity",
    ", the fundamental plane relation of @xcite indicates that the x - ray emission should be dominated by the synchrotron emission of the uncooled jet rather than the adaf ( see figure  5 of * ? ? ?",
    "thus , both the arguments of @xcite and @xcite imply that the results of section  [ lrsb ] ( and the results of some previous works , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) would be suspicious according to the fact that the x - ray emission we considered in section  [ lrsb ] is from adafs rather than jets .",
    "we will address this issue in the following subsection .",
    "as stated in section 3.1 , there exists inconsistency between the fundamental plane relation we adopted and the radiative processes of x - ray emission we assumed .",
    "then , it is natural to ask whether the results obtained in section  [ lrsb ] will change significantly if we instead calculate the x - ray emission of the radiatively cooled jet and use the fundamental plane relation of @xcite , or obtain the x - ray emission of the uncooled jet and use the fundamental plane relation of @xcite .",
    "however , it is not easy to constrain the x - ray emission of the jet ( whether cooled or uncooled ) due to our poor knowledge of the jet physics",
    ". therefore , we will investigate the issue in a different way , which is based on the idea that there may exist a correlation between @xmath7 and the radio luminosity for flat spectrum radio cores ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the key point is whether this @xmath95 relation , as first quantitatively obtained by @xcite for low luminosity bhxrbs , depend on the origin of x - ray emission .",
    "if the sources whose x - ray emission is dominated by adafs share the similar relation with the sources whose x - ray emission mainly comes from jets , then one can expect that the results of section  [ lrsb ] is robust .",
    "the physical reason is as follows . in section  [ pw ] , @xmath2 is obtained by @xmath96 ( see equation  [ lx ] ) rather than via x - ray observations .",
    "this equation and the fundamental plane relation actually reveal a direct relation between @xmath7 and @xmath3 . in other words ,",
    "equation  ( [ re ] ) is identical to an @xmath95 relation .",
    "below , we will explore the @xmath95 relation of both adaf - dominated and jet - dominated sources .    to answer this question",
    ", we search the literature for published information on @xmath7 and @xmath3 . our sample is collected from @xcite(seven fr i galaxies ) , @xcite(xte j1118 + 480 ) , @xcite(14 llagn is obtained ; m87 ( jet - dominated according to * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is also excluded because currently the origin of the x - ray emission is still under debate , especially the numerical simulation of @xcite suggests that the adaf can account for the x - ray emission . ] ) and @xcite(three bhxbs ) ( see table  2 ) .",
    "accretion rates of these sources are obtained by fitting the coupled adaf - jet model ( for readers who are interested in details of this model , we recommend * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to the overall spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of each source .",
    "below we will try to summarize the main assumption of the coupled adaf - jet model .",
    "the accretion flow is described by an adaf with outflows ( i.e. , equation  [ adaf ] ) . to fully account for the global solution of the adaf , one should specify @xmath97 , @xmath50 , @xmath52 , the viscosity parameter @xmath48 , and the magnetic parameter @xmath60 .",
    "the sed of the flow can be obtained after the global solution is solved ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "on the other hand , the jet model is quantified based on the internal shock scenario used in gamma - ray burst models . in this model , a fixed fraction of material of the flow",
    "is lost into form a jet ( @xmath98 ) .",
    "other two parameters that quantify the geometry and motion of the jet are the half - opening angle @xmath99 and bulk lorentz factor @xmath100 .",
    "according to the internal shock scenario , shocks occur as shells with different velocity colliding with each other . as a consequence",
    ", a few fraction of electrons in the jet is accelerated into a power - law distribution ( i.e. , @xmath101 , typically , @xmath102 ) .",
    "the remaining parameters are the fraction of accelerated electrons @xmath103 and magnetic field in the shock front @xmath104 . with these parameters ,",
    "one can calculate the sed of the jet by considering the synchrotron emission and/or compton scattering .",
    "note that the radiative cooling of the non - thermal electrons is also taken into consideration for the x - ray emission of the jet . comparing the sed of coupled adaf - jet model with observations , one can , in principle , constrain @xmath97 ( or @xmath98 if x - ray emission is dominated by the jet ) , @xmath50 ( for an interesting discussion of the robustness of the obtained parameters , see figures  4 - 6 of * ? ? ?",
    "* which indicate that the calculated sed is inconsistent with data if @xmath7 varies a little from the best fitting value ) .",
    "besides , the origin of the x - ray emission can be found ( indicated in table  2 ) .",
    "we also include the data of bhxrbs used in @xcite .",
    "these bhxrbs are under the state transition from the soft state to the hard state ( except for grs  1915 + 105 , which is in a so - called  plateau state \" ) .",
    "@xmath7 can be calculated as @xmath105 , where @xmath106 is the speed of light .",
    "therefore , as shown by table  2 , we have 22 sources with x - ray emission dominated by the adaf and nine sources with x - ray emission dominated by the jet . for the former 22 sources , we perform the ols regression between @xmath7 and @xmath6 . for the latter nine sources , however , both the x - ray emission and the radio emission",
    "are dominated by the jet , so the obtained @xmath97 is not reliable .",
    "we instead performed the ols regression between @xmath98 and @xmath6 .",
    "our ols regression results are presented in table  3 .    as shown in table  3 ,",
    "the slope of jet - dominated sources and adaf - dominated sources are consistent with each other under @xmath107 uncertainties .",
    "however , it is inappropriate to directly compare the normalization of jet - dominated sources with that of adaf - dominated ones because @xmath98 is only a small fraction of @xmath7 .",
    "we assume @xmath108 and choose a typical value @xmath109 to address this issue . by doing this",
    ", one can obtain an @xmath90 relation for the nine jet - dominated sources .",
    "we compare it with the one obtained from the adaf - dominated ones .",
    "figure  2 plots the results .",
    "as seen from this figure , the @xmath90 relation of jet - dominated sources is consistent with that of adaf - dominated sources under @xmath110 uncertainties ( filled regions in the plot ) . in order to further confirm our results ,",
    "we have also tried to take the black hole mass into consideration , that is , we perform the ols multivariate regression among @xmath6 , @xmath7 ( @xmath98 ) , and @xmath4 .",
    "we find that the requirement of the parameter @xmath4 is statistically rejected under the @xmath111 value is 0.01 .",
    "thus , we can conclude that black holes in low activity state share a similar @xmath95 relation , regardless of @xmath112 or the origin of the x - ray emission .",
    "since the @xmath95 relation does not depend on the origin of the x - ray emission , the results obtained in section  [ lrsb ] are robust even if the x - ray emission may come from the synchrotron emission of the cooled @xcite or uncooled @xcite jet .",
    "other evidence that may confirm our conclusion is the thin solid line and the dotted line in figure  1 , which show @xmath3 estimated by the @xmath95 relation ( that is , the @xmath95 relation of the jet - dominated sources with , roughly , @xmath113 and @xmath114 , since x - ray emission of the sources in table  1 may mainly come from the jet rather than the adaf ) . for the case of @xcite ( @xmath115 ,",
    "dotted line ) , the radio luminosity estimated from the @xmath90 is close to ( within one order of magnitude ) the radio luminosity obtained by assuming that the x - ray emission is dominated by the adaf and using the fundamental plane relation ( i.e. , section  [ lrsb ] ) .",
    "the same conclusion holds ( again within one order of magnitude ) for our case ( thin solid line ) .",
    "the radio observation is , as first demonstrated by @xcite , useful in probing imbhs in gcs .",
    "however , the upper mass limits of imbhs constrained by radio observations are significantly smaller than that of dynamical modelings . in this work",
    ", we showed that this inconsistency can be solved if adafs suffer outflows and imbhs may exist in gcs .",
    "we also concluded that the results of section  [ lrsb ] and previous works do not strongly depend on the physical processes of the x - ray emission and the type of fundamental plane relation , if @xmath112 is obtained via the accretion theory .",
    "the remaining question is about the scatter in the estimation .",
    "the fundamental plane relation of @xcite with @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 has a scatter of @xmath116 . in this work",
    ", we have adopted this version of fundamental plane relation ( for reasons , see section  [ lrsb ] ) .",
    "the uncertainty in estimating of @xmath2 from @xmath7 also contribute to the scatter .",
    "however , for almost all sources ( except for @xmath88 cen ) , the @xmath5 upper limits of radio luminosity are at least two orders of magnitude higher than that of our estimations .",
    "therefore , the robustness of our conclusion that current radio observations can not rule out the existence of imbhs in gcs will not be affected by the above scatter .",
    "@xmath88 cen has long been considered as a promising source that may harbor an imbh in its center .",
    "for example , the early work of @xcite analyzed the hst acs image and the gemini gmos - ifu kinematic data and concluded that @xmath88 cen hosts an imbh with @xmath117 .",
    "however , @xcite explored a new dataset of hst proper motion and star count and given an upper limit of the mass of the imbh in @xmath88 cen : @xmath118 at @xmath107 confidence ( which is the value we adopted in this work ) .",
    "they also found that data can be well fitted with a @xmath119 model and the @xmath4 proposed by @xcite is firmly ruled out , although the cluster center of @xcite is @xmath120 away from that of @xcite .",
    "interestingly , @xcite used the vlt - flames to obtain the new data and found again that there should be an imbh with @xmath121 in the center of @xmath88 cen ( note that even for the center of * ? ? ?",
    "* they also concluded an imbh with @xmath122 ) .",
    "a recent work of @xcite confirmed the conclusion of @xcite . in this work ,",
    "@xmath88 cen is the only one whose @xmath5 upper limit of @xmath6 is close to the predicted radio luminosity even the outflows have been taken into consideration . to make the @xmath123 imbh compatible with the radio observations of @xmath88 cen , one has to assume that the mass loss effect of outflows is larger than the one with @xmath75 .",
    "such an assumption challenges recent numerical simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and observations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this leads us to conclude that the imbh in @xmath88 cen , if exists , is likely to be much lighter than @xmath124 , which is in agreement with @xcite .",
    "more deep radio observations are required to draw robust conclusions .",
