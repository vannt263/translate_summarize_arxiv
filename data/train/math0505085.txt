    "one also wonders what the limits of applicability are for each of the methods of section  [ sec : coxeter - inv ] , and how their outputs compare if more than one of them works .",
    "examples  [ example : euler - n=3 ] , [ example : symmetry - n=3 ] , [ example : recip - n=3 ] , and [ example : k3-m(g ) ] illustrate the methods in the @xmath416 case , and provide the first example in which all of them break down : when @xmath417 , the denominator in the formula for @xmath2 vanishes .",

    "this is a straightforward verification , omitted here .",
    "( note that each connected induced subgraph of  @xmath386 is of type  @xmath438 . )",
    "the recurrences that determine the fake invariants of type @xmath439 are different from the type-@xmath131 recurrences , so the coincidence of the final answers is somewhat mysterious . on the other hand ,",
    "the fact that the @xmath13-cycle is combinatorially related to the type-@xmath131 cluster complex ( the @xmath13-dimensional cyclohedron ) is well known : there is a _ different _ generalization of associahedra @xcite which produces the cyclohedron in case of an @xmath13-cycle .",
    "it would be interesting to clarify the relationship between the two constructions , and provide a conceptual explanation for proposition  [ prop : affinea - fake ] .",
    "our computations suggest that the complete list of connected coxeter diagrams for which all methods described in sections  [ sec : euler - char - method][sec : reciprocity - based ] produce _ positive integer _",

    "so whenever the general reciprocity method produces a fake coxeter number @xmath2 that is a non - constant rational function in  @xmath0 , the specializations of this rational function at @xmath391 and @xmath1 should be viewed with suspicion .",
    "still , it is tempting to mention some instances of coxeter diagrams of affine type where the general reciprocity method fails whereas the @xmath385-based method of section  [ sec : m(g ) ] gives a positive integer value of  @xmath2 .",
    "they are :    * type  @xmath442 , with  @xmath443 and @xmath444 ( in type  @xmath445 , @xmath2 is a fraction ) ; * type  @xmath446 , with @xmath447 and @xmath448 ( but irrational exponents ) ; * type  @xmath449 , with @xmath450 and @xmath451 .",
    "the fake coxeter number , if defined , is always a rational number ( by design ) , and sometimes even an integer . on the other hand , in most cases , some of the fake exponents are irrational , as the generalized fuss - catalan invariant @xmath452 would not factor into linear polynomials in  @xmath0 ( over  @xmath453 ) .",
