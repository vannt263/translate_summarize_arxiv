    "the statistical model has been , for a long time , successfully applied to fit experimental data on mean hadron multiplicities in heavy ion collision experiments over a wide range of beam energies and system sizes . for recent reviews",
    "see @xcite .",
    "so naturally the question arises whether the statistical model is able to describe event - by - event fluctuations of these observables as well . and",
    "indeed , a first comparison suggests that this might be possible for the sample of most central events .",
    "global conservation laws , imposed on a statistical system , lead , even in the large volume limit , to suppressed fluctuations .",
    "the multiplicity distributions of charged hadrons recently reported @xcite by the na49 sps experiment are systematically narrower than a poissonian reference distribution .",
    "this could be interpreted @xcite as effects due to energy and charge conservation in a relativistic hadronic gas .",
    "multiplicity fluctuations are usually quantified by the ratio of the variance of a multiplicity distribution to its mean value , the so - called scaled variance . in statistical models there is a qualitative difference in the properties of mean value and scaled variance . in the case of the mean multiplicity results obtained within the grand canonical ensemble ( gce ) , canonical ensemble ( ce ) , and micro - canonical ensemble ( mce ) approach each other in the large volume limit .",
    "one refers here to as the thermodynamic equivalence of these ensembles .",
    "it was recently found @xcite that corresponding results for the scaled variance are different in different ensembles , and thus this observable is sensitive to conservation laws obeyed by a statistical system .",
    "the growing interest in the experimental and theoretical study of fluctuations in strong interactions ( see e.g. , reviews @xcite ) is motivated by expectations of anomalies in the vicinity of the onset of deconfinement @xcite and in the case when the expanding system goes through the transition line between a quark - gluon plasma and a hadron gas phase @xcite .",
    "in particular , a critical point of strongly interacting matter may be accompanied by a characteristic power - law pattern in fluctuations @xcite .",
    "a non - monotonic dependence of event - by - event fluctuations on system size and/or center of mass energy in heavy ion collisions would therefore give valuable insight into the phase diagram of strongly interacting matter .",
    "provided the signal survives the subsequent evolution and hadronization of the system ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , in order to asses the discriminating power of proposed measures , for a recent review see @xcite , one should firstly study properties of equilibrated sources @xcite and quantify  baseline  ( or thermal / statistical ) fluctuations .",
    "apart from being an important tool in an effort to study a possible critical behavior , the study of fluctuations within the statistical model constitutes also a further test of its validity .    in this paper",
    "we make detailed predictions for the momentum space dependence of multiplicity fluctuations .",
    "we show that energy and momentum conservation lead to a non - trivial dependence of the scaled variance on the location and magnitude of the observed fraction of momentum space .",
    "these predictions can be tested against existing and future data from the heavy ion collision experiments at the cern sps and bnl rhic facilities .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ model ] we briefly introduce our model . in section [ gcece ] we consider multiplicity distributions in a limited region of momentum space in gce and ce .",
    "for the mce we follow , in section [ mce ] , the procedure of ref.@xcite and show how to calculate the width of the corresponding distributions in the large volume limit .",
    "we revisit the so - called  acceptance scaling  previously suggested as an approximate implementation of experimental acceptance in section [ results ] .",
    "technical details of the calculations are presented in the appendix .",
    "concluding remarks and a summary in sections [ remarks ] and [ summary ] close the paper .",
    "the ideal boltzmann @xmath0 @xmath1 @xmath2 gas serves as the standard example throughout this paper , while the main subject of investigation is the multiplicity distribution @xmath3 of particles with momenta inside a certain segment @xmath4 of momentum space .",
    "calculations are done for the three standard ensembles gce , ce , and mce . for the sake of argument",
    "we will assume that we only want to measure @xmath5 , i.e. the probability distribution of negatively charged pions in a limited segment @xmath4 of momentum space .",
    "hence @xmath1 with momenta inside @xmath4 are observed , while @xmath1 inside the complementary segment @xmath6 are not observed . @xmath0 and @xmath2 are never detected . in gce and ce the presence of @xmath2 as a degree of freedom is of no relevance , while in mce it constitutes a heat bath for the remaining system . for consistency",
    "we use the same system throughout this discussion .    in order to keep the model simple , we assume a static homogenous fireball .",
    "our considerations therefore exclude collective motion , i.e. flow , and resulting momentum spectra are purely thermal .",
    "we also omit resonance decay contributions in this work .",
    "the spectra presented in fig .",
    "[ spectra ] are normalized to the total @xmath1 yield in gce and ce .",
    "thus they are the same in both ensembles . in mce one",
    "expects in the large volume limit only small deviations from boltzmann spectra .",
    "none of the forthcoming arguments are affected by this .    in the following",
    "we will use the transverse momentum and rapidity spectra presented in fig .",
    "[ spectra ] to construct bins @xmath7 $ ] ( left ) , or @xmath8 $ ] ( right ) , as indicates by the drop - lines .    in section [ gcece ]",
    "we calculate the multiplicity distributions @xmath3 for arbitrary segments @xmath4 for the ideal boltzmann gce and ce . to characterize the distribution",
    "one can calculate its ( raw ) moments @xmath9 from : @xmath10 a convenient measure for the width of a distribution is the scaled variance : @xmath11 in order to remove simple scaling effects , the bin sizes or segments are chosen such that each bin or segment contains the same fraction @xmath12 of the total yield ( compare eq.([scaledvar ] ) ) . here",
    "@xmath13 denotes the average particle number in the momentum space segment @xmath4 , and @xmath14 denotes the average total ( @xmath15 integrated ) multiplicity .",
    "the effect of finite acceptance can approximately be taken into account by @xcite : @xmath16 where @xmath17 assumes the ideal situation when all particles are detected , while @xmath18 assumes that particles are detected with probability @xmath19 regardless of their momentum . hence eq.([accscaling ] ) holds when particles are assumed to be uncorrelated in momentum space . in the limit @xmath20 one",
    "observes a random distribution with @xmath21 , i.e. a poissonian , while when @xmath22 one sees the real distribution with width @xmath23 . in this work",
    "we take explicitely correlations due to globally conserved charge ( ce ) , and energy - momentum ( mce ) into account and compare the results to eq.([accscaling ] ) .",
    "in the gce , both , heat and charge bath are assumed to be infinite . and thus neither charge ,",
    "energy nor momentum are conserved exactly .",
    "temperature @xmath24 and charge chemical potential @xmath25 regulate average energy and charge density in a system of volume @xmath26 .",
    "usually it is said that charge , energy and momentum are conserved in the average sense and fluctuations about an equilibrium value are allowed . apart",
    "form bose and fermi effects @xcite particles are therefore uncorrelated in momentum space .",
    "however this example serves as an illustration for the following ce and mce calculations .",
    "we start by decomposing the boltzmann single particle partition function @xmath27 of @xmath1 into two parts , @xmath28 where the single particle energy @xmath29 , and @xmath30 , and @xmath31 are mass and degeneracy factor of @xmath1 respectively . only for momentum states inside the momentum space region",
    "@xmath4 we introduce additionally a wick - rotated fugacity @xmath32 . for the positive and neutral pion ( which we do not want to detect in our example )",
    "we write : @xmath33 the value of the single particle partition function , for instance of the neutral pion , is given by : @xmath34 for the sake of simplicity we assume equal masses for all pions . to obtain the gce multiplicity distribution for @xmath35 in a momentum space segment",
    "@xmath4 we use the fourier integral over the generalized gce partition function @xmath36 $ ] , normalized by the gce partition function : @xmath37~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the system partition function is given by @xmath38 , and @xmath39 .",
    "independent of the shape or size of @xmath4 we find a poissonian for the multiplicity distribution eq.([gcepdf ] ) .",
    "thus , using eq.([scaledvar ] ) , one finds for the scaled variance @xmath40 , since @xmath41 , and @xmath42 .    for bose and fermi statistics one",
    "does not expect a poisson distribution and ( in particular when the chemical potential is large ) deviations from a poissonian can be large .",
    "thus one expects also deviations from eq.([accscaling ] ) when considering only finite acceptance .      in",
    "the ce the heat bath is still assumed to be infinite , while we remove the charge bath and drop the chemical potential .",
    "thus , we introduce a further wick - rotated fugacity @xmath43 into the single particle partition functions to account for global ( however not in the momentum space segment @xmath4 ) conservation of electric charge @xmath44 .",
    "particles in @xmath4 are therefore correlated , due to the condition of fixed net - charge , with a finite charge bath composed of @xmath0 and unobserved @xmath1 .",
    "we again split the single particle partition function for @xmath1 into an observed , @xmath45 , and an unobserved part , @xmath46 , @xmath47 while we do not want to measure @xmath0 and @xmath2 , and thus : @xmath48 the normalization of the ce multiplicity distribution is given by the ce system partition function @xmath49 , i.e. the number of all micro states with fixed charge q , @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the modified bessel function .",
    "the multiplicity distribution of @xmath35 in a momentum space segment @xmath4 , while charge @xmath44 is globally conserved , can be obtained from fourier integration of the generalized gce partition function @xmath52 $ ] , over both angles @xmath53 and @xmath54 : @xmath55 where in ce @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 . for the respective first two moments one finds from eq.([moments ] ) : @xmath59 thus , we obtain the well known canonical suppression of yields @xcite and fluctuations @xcite .",
    "the result , however , is completely independent of the position of the segment @xmath4 . and therefore the scaled variance , eq.([scaledvar ] ) , takes the form : @xmath60~ , \\qquad \\textrm{and } \\qquad \\omega^{ce}_{4\\pi } =   1 +   z ~ \\left [ \\frac{i_{q+2 }    \\left(2z\\right)}{i_{q+1 }    \\left(2z \\right ) }   -\\frac{i_{q+1 }    \\left(2z\\right)}{i_q    \\left(2z \\right ) }   \\right]~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath61 is the width of @xmath62 , i.e. the multiplicity distribution of @xmath1 with momenta inside @xmath4 , while @xmath17 is the width of the corresponding distribution when @xmath4 is extended to the full momentum space .",
    "it can immediately be seen that this formula is consistent with acceptance scaling , eq.([accscaling ] ) , @xmath63 , if @xmath64 .",
    "generally we find @xmath65 . in the limit of @xmath66",
    "we approach the poisson limit of a  random ",
    "distribution with @xmath67 , i.e. the observed part of the system is embedded into a much larger charge bath and the gce is a valid description .",
    "for the mce an analytical solution seems to be out of reach presently , so we use instead the asymptotic solution , applicable to large systems , derived in @xcite . in order to avoid unnecessary repetition of calculations",
    ", we will only give a general outline here , and refer the reader for a detailed discussion to ref.@xcite .",
    "it should be mentioned that this method be would be also applicable to systems of finite spatial extention , provided the average particle number in a given momentum space bin exceeds roughly @xmath68 . in this work we confine ourselves to large systems and try to asses the general trends .",
    "the basic idea is to define the mce multiplicity distribution in terms of a joint gce distribution of multiplicity , charge , energy , momentum , etc .",
    "the mce multiplicity distribution is then given by the ( normalized ) conditional probability in the gce to find a number @xmath35 of particles in a segment @xmath4 of momentum space , while electric charge @xmath44 , energy @xmath69 , and three momentum @xmath70 are fixed .",
    "therefore we will keep temperature and chemical potentials as parameters to describe our system .",
    "effective temperature and effective chemical potential , i.e. lagrange multipliers , can be determined by demanding that the gce partition function is maximized for a certain equilibrium state @xmath71 .",
    "this requirement is entirely consistent @xcite with the usual textbook definitions of @xmath24 and @xmath25 in mce and ce through differentiation of entropy and helmholtz free energy with respect to conserved quantities . in principle",
    "we would have to treat all conservation laws on equal footing @xcite , and thus introduce lagrange multipliers for momentum conservation as well .",
    "however here we are only interested in a static source , thus @xmath72 , and the relevant parameters are equal to zero",
    ".    in the large volume limit energy , charge , and particle density in the mce will correspond to gce values .",
    "this is required by the thermodynamic equivalence of ensembles for mean quantities .",
    "mce and ce partition functions are generally obtained from their gce counterpart by multiplication with delta - functions , which pick out a set of micro states consistent with a particular conservation law . here",
    "it will be of considerable advantage to use fourier representations of delta - functions , similar to the treatment in section [ gcece ] .",
    "this method could be considered to be a fourier spectral analysis of the generalized gce partition function @xcite .",
    "the normalized conditional probability distribution of multiplicity @xmath35 can be defined by the ratio of the values of two partition functions : @xmath73 the real mce partition function and our modified version are connected as @xmath74 . in either case the normalization in eq.([mceprob ] ) is given by the partition functions with fixed values of @xmath75 , but arbitrary particle number @xmath35 , hence @xmath76 , or @xmath77 .",
    "however when taking the ratio ( [ mceprob ] ) auxiliary parameters chemical potential and temperature drop out : @xmath78 the main difference between the two versions of partition functions is that for @xmath79 one is confronted with a heavily oscillating ( or even irregular ) integrant , while for @xmath80 the integrant becomes ( @xmath24,@xmath25 correctly chosen ) very smooth .",
    "thus , introduction of @xmath24 and @xmath25 allows to derive ( and use ) the asymptotic solution of ref.@xcite .",
    "we have a total number of 6 conserved ",
    "charges  , and hence we need to solve the 6-dimensional fourier integral for the numerator in eq.([mceprob2 ] ) to simplify the notation . ] : @xmath81.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the summation in ( [ mceint ] ) should be taken over the single particle partitions @xmath82 of all considered particle species @xmath83 .",
    "the wick - rotated fugacities @xmath84 , etc .",
    "are related to the individual conservation laws .",
    "the distinction between the kronecker delta - function ( limits of integration @xmath85 $ ] ) for discrete quantities and the dirac delta - function ( limits of integration @xmath86 $ ] ) for continuous quantities is important here , however for deriving an asymptotic solution it will not be . to simplify ( [ mceint ] ) we change to shorthand notation for @xmath87 and the conserved ",
    "charge  vector @xmath88 .",
    "we again split the single particle partition functions in two parts .",
    "the first part counts the number of momentum states observable to our detector , while the second part counts momentum states invisible to our detector : @xmath89 for the  charge  vector of all measured particle species @xmath83 we write @xmath90 for momenta inside @xmath4 , and @xmath91 for momenta outside of @xmath4 . for all unobserved particle species we write @xmath92 . here",
    "@xmath93 is the electrical charge of particle species @xmath83 , and @xmath94 and @xmath95 are its energy and momentum vector . in ref.@xcite , where only multiplicity distributions in the full momentum space were considered ,",
    "the general  charge  vector took the form @xmath96 , where @xmath97 is the multiplicity of this particle . for stable particles",
    "@xmath98 in case they are observed , and @xmath99 if they are not measured , while for unstable particles @xmath97 could also denote the number of measurable decay products .    for large system volume",
    "the main contribution to the integral ( [ mceint ] ) comes from a small region around the origin @xcite .",
    "thus we proceed by taylor expansion of the integrant of ( [ mceint ] ) around @xmath100 . in this context @xmath101",
    "would be called the cumulant generating function ( cgf ) . cumulants ( expansion terms ) are defined by differentiation of the cgf at the origin : @xmath102 generally are cumulants tensors of rank @xmath103 and dimension defined by the number of conserved quantities . here",
    "@xmath104 is a 6 component vector , while @xmath105 is a @xmath106 matrix , etc .",
    "the parts of the integrant related to discrete quantities , i.e. @xmath35 and @xmath44 , are now not @xmath107 periodic anymore ( while in eq.([mceint ] ) they are ) , but superpositions of oscillating and decaying parts",
    ". thus we extent the limits of integration to @xmath108 , what introduces a negligible error .",
    "eq.([mceint ] ) therefore simplifies to : @xmath109 ~\\exp \\big [   -iq^j\\phi_j ~+~v \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty } \\frac{i^n}{n ! } \\ ; \\kappa_n^{j_1,j_2,\\dots , j_n } \\ ;",
    "\\phi_{j_1 } \\phi_{j_2 } \\dots \\phi_{j_n } \\big ] ~.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] summation over repeated indices is implied .",
    "existence and finiteness of the first three cumulants provided , any such integral can be shown to converge to a multivariate normal distribution in the large volume limit : @xmath110 where @xmath111 $ ] is the gce partition function , @xmath112 is the cumulant of @xmath113 order , @xmath114 is a measure for the distance of a particular macro state @xmath115 to the peak @xmath116 of the joint distribution , and @xmath117 is the square root of the second rank tensor @xmath105 , see @xcite for details .",
    "the normalization in eq.([mceprob2 ] ) can essentially be found in two ways",
    ". the first way would be to integrate the distribution ( [ mce_multnormal ] ) over all possible values of multiplicity @xmath35 , while all other variables are set to their peak values , e.g. @xmath118 , @xmath119 , @xmath72 .",
    "the second and more practical way is to use an approximation similar to eq.([mce_multnormal ] ) to describe the macro state @xmath120 .",
    "the normalization in eq.([mceprob2 ] ) , @xmath121 , is then given by the 5-dimensional integral , similar to eq.([mceint ] ) , without the integration over @xmath54 .",
    "the 1-dimensional slice along @xmath35 , i.e. the conditional distribution of particle number @xmath35 , while charge , energy and momentum are fixed to @xmath122 , can then be shown @xcite to converge to a gaussian in the large volume limit : @xmath123 the scaled variance @xmath124 is given by the ratio of the two determinants of the two relevant second rank cumulants , @xmath105 and @xmath125 , of the two partition functions @xmath126 and @xmath121 , hence : @xmath127 the asymptotic ( @xmath128 ) scaled variance can therefore be written in the form of eq.(28 ) in @xcite .",
    "considering only the asymptotic solution we need to investigate only the first two cumulants ( @xmath129 ) in detail .",
    "we will first discuss the structure of @xmath104 and @xmath105 , and then deduce a few properties of eq.([simpleomega ] ) .",
    "the first order cumulant @xmath104 of @xmath130 gives gce expectation values for particle density @xmath131 , charge density @xmath132 , energy density @xmath133 , and expectation values of momentum @xmath134 , etc .",
    "since we are only interested in a static source we find due to the antisymmetric momentum integral ( see appendix [ calc ] ) @xmath135 .",
    "the general form of the first cumulant @xmath104 is then : @xmath136    the second cumulant @xmath105 of @xmath130 contains information about correlations due to different conserved quantities .",
    "a detailed discussion of correlation terms only involving abelian charges and/or energy , e.g. @xmath137 , @xmath138 , and @xmath139 , can be found in @xcite .",
    "again , due to the antisymmetric nature of the momentum integral , all cumulant entries involving an odd order in one of the momenta , e.g. @xmath140 , @xmath141 , or @xmath142 are equal to zero .",
    "the general second order cumulant @xmath105 thus reads : @xmath143 please note that by construction , eq.([kappa_n ] ) , the matrix ( [ matrix ] ) is symmetric , hence @xmath144 , etc .",
    "the second matrix @xmath145 , now related to the partition function @xmath146 , is obtained from @xmath105 , eq.([matrix ] ) , by crossing out the first row and first column . in the following we are going to make use of the fact that one can express the determinant of a matrix @xmath147 by : @xmath148 where @xmath149 is the matrix element @xmath150 of a general non - singular @xmath151 matrix @xmath147 , and",
    "@xmath152 is its complementary minor .",
    "a simple consequence of eq.([calcdet ] ) is : @xmath153 ~=~ \\left (   \\kappa_2^{p_x , p_x }   \\right)^3 \\det |\\hat \\kappa_2|,\\ ] ] where @xmath154 , due to spherical symmetry in momentum space , and @xmath155 is just a @xmath156 matrix involving only terms containing @xmath69 and @xmath44 . in case correlations between particle number and conserved",
    "momenta are vanishing , i.e. @xmath157 , or @xmath158 , then , similarly to eq.([normdet ] ) , the determinant of @xmath105 factorizes into a product of correlation terms @xmath159 and the determinant of a @xmath160 sub - matrix involving only terms containing @xmath69 , @xmath44 , and @xmath161 . hence in taking the ratio eq.([simpleomega ] ) one notes , that in this case momentum conservation will not affect multiplicity fluctuations in the large volume limit @xcite . in this work , however we do not necessarily find @xmath162 , as we only integrate over a limited segment @xmath4 of momentum space , and taking momentum conservation into account may affect the result .",
    "finally it should be stressed that this procedure can be easily generalized to account for bose or fermi statistics . also phenomenological phase space suppression ( enhancement )",
    "factors @xmath163 @xcite or @xmath164 @xcite could be straightforwardly included .",
    "however , without proper implementation of the effect of additional correlations due to resonance decay and collective motion , i.e. flow , it seems of little value to do too strict calculations for experimentally measurable distributions .",
    "we thus return to the pion gas example from section [ gcece ] and restrict the discussion to simple momentum space cuts in rapidity , transverse momentum , and azimuthal angle , see also the appendix for details .",
    "let us firstly recall basic properties of multiplicity fluctuations of negative particles in the full momentum space ( @xmath15 fluctuations ) in the three standard ensembles , of the boltzmann pion gas considered here .",
    "multiplicity fluctuations in the ce are suppressed due to exact charge conservation . for a neutral ( @xmath165 ) system one",
    "finds in the large volume limit @xmath166 @xcite .",
    "further suppression of fluctuations arise from additionally enforcing exact energy conservation in the mce . here",
    "one finds @xmath167 for a boltzmann pion gas at @xmath168 . in the gce , since no conservation laws are enforced , we always find a poisson distribution with width @xmath169 .",
    "since charge conservation in ce links the distributions of negatively charged particles to the one of their positive counterparts , i.e. @xmath170 , the relative width of @xmath171 increases ( decreases ) as we move the electric charge density to positive ( negative ) values @xcite",
    ". this can be easily be seen from eq.([matrix ] ) by crossing out all rows and columns containing energy and momentum and calculating the asymptotic scaled variance of negatively charged particles , @xmath172 , from eq.([simpleomega ] ) , @xmath173 the same effect is present in the mce , however the calculation is slightly longer .",
    "results for @xmath15 multiplicity fluctuations of negatively charged particles in a boltzmann pion gas at @xmath174 and different charge densities are summarized in table [ table ] . additionally estimates , based on our previously employed  uncorrelated particle  approach , eq([accscaling ] ) , for multiplicity fluctuations with limited acceptance are given .",
    ".multiplicity fluctuation of @xmath1 in a classical pion gas in the large volume limit in the three standard ensembles at @xmath174 for different charge densities .",
    "the index ",
    "@xmath15  denotes fluctuations in the full momentum space , while the index ",
    "@xmath175  assumes acceptance scaling , eq.([accscaling ] ) .",
    "the ratio @xmath176 equals to @xmath177 for @xmath178 , @xmath179 for @xmath180 , and @xmath181 for @xmath182 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     despite the fact that @xmath17 is very different in gce , ce , or mce and also rather sensitive to the charge density , the estimates for limited acceptance ( @xmath175 ) based on eq.([accscaling ] ) vary only by a few % . in order to decisively distinguish predictions for different ensembles a large value of @xmath19",
    "would be needed .",
    "in section [ gcece ] we have seen that in the boltzmann ce multiplicity fluctuations observed in a limited segment of phase space are insensitive to the position of this segment .",
    "the dependence on the size of the segment can thus be taken into account by use of acceptance scaling eq.([accscaling ] ) . to balance charge",
    "a particle can be produced or annihilated anywhere in momentum space . and due to a infinitely large heat and momentum bath in the ce",
    "no momentum state is essentially preferred .    in the mce",
    "this dependence is qualitatively different .",
    "when using the mce formulation particles are correlated due to the constraints of exactly conserved energy and momentum , even in the large volume limit .",
    "fluctuations in a macroscopic subsystem are strongly affected by correlations with the remainder of the system .    in fig .",
    "[ dodp ] we show the scaled variance of multiplicity fluctuations for negatively charges particles in finite bins in transverse momentum ( left ) , and rapidity ( right ) .",
    "the bins are constructed such that each bin contains on average the same fraction @xmath19 of the total average yield .",
    "the width of each bin is indicated by the bars .",
    "calculations are done for two values of acceptance ( @xmath183 , and @xmath175 ) .",
    "the dashed and dotted lines correspond to acceptance scaling eq.([accscaling ] ) , while the markers are calculated from eq.([simpleomega ] ) .",
    "one finds that multiplicity fluctuations in bins with high transverse momentum and high values of rapidity are , due to energy and momentum conservation , essentially suppressed with respect to bins where individual particles carry less energy and momentum .",
    "a intuitive explanation would probably look like this : let us consider an event with an unusually large ( small ) number of particles at the most forward rapidity bin . in this bin",
    "we would find therefore a macroscopic state with unusually large ( small ) observed longitudinal momentum @xmath184 and energy @xmath185 .",
    "the remainder of the system therefore has to have rather large ( small ) momentum @xmath186 and rather small ( large ) energy @xmath187 . since both probability distributions ,",
    "for the observed and the unobserved subsystems , do not factorize into independent probability distributions , but are correlated , this macro state would be rather unlikely .",
    "fluctuations about the mean @xmath188 at forward ( backward ) rapidities should therefore be suppressed .",
    "on the other hand can modest multiplicity fluctuations in a high @xmath189 bin induce stronger fluctuations in the lower @xmath189 bins , and fluctuations about @xmath190 in a low @xmath189 bin are enhanced .",
    "even when detecting only a fraction of about 10% of the total system these correlations can have a sizeable effect .",
    "it seems worthwhile to consider individual conservation laws and their impact on multiplicity fluctuations in more detail . on of the main advantages of the analytical procedure presented here , is certainly that one can easily ",
    "switch on  or ",
    "switch off  a particular conservation law .",
    "for illustrative purposes we show the result of @xmath191 for mce without longitudinal momentum conservation in fig.[dodywopz ] .    in comparing fig.[dodp ] ,",
    "right , to fig.[dodywopz ] it becomes obvious that energy conservation alone can not account for the strong suppression of multiplicity fluctuations at forward rapidities , but has to be explained by combined energy and longitudinal momentum conservation .",
    "the relevant cumulants elements , which give information about the strenght of correlations between particle number and a particular conserved quantity , are @xmath192 , @xmath193 , @xmath194 , etc . whenever a element is vanishig , then the corresponding conservation law has no impact on multiplicity fluctuations",
    ". for details of the calculations please see the appendix .",
    "since for fluctuations of charged particles @xmath192 and @xmath193 are generally non - zero , we will focus only on the effects of momentum conservation .    for multiplicity fluctuations in bins in transverse momentum momentum conservation",
    "does not affect the result , see appendix [ app_pt ] , and the suppression effect is a result of energy conservation alone .",
    "when considering cuts in rapidity one finds in general @xmath195 , but @xmath196 , and only longitudinal momentum conservation needs to be taken into account , see appendix [ app_y ] . in considering the third idealized case , where our detector observes only a segment in azimuthal angle @xmath197 , but all rapidities @xmath198 and transverse momenta @xmath189 , both global @xmath199 , and @xmath200 conservation lead to non - trivial modifications of eq.([accscaling ] ) , see appendix [ app_phi ] .    to understand the difference between the strong suppression of fluctuations at high transverse momentum and the rather modest suppression at high rapidity when momentum conservation is not enforced , one should compare the elements @xmath201 in eq.([omega_pt ] ) , and @xmath202 in eq.([omega_y ] ) , which measure in boltzmann approximation the average energy density carried by particles in a bin @xmath203 or @xmath204 , to the total average energy density @xmath205 carried by @xmath1 .",
    "( all other elements in eqs.([omega_pt ] ) and ( [ omega_y ] ) do not depend on the location of the segment . ) in case of kinematical cuts in @xmath203 the fraction @xmath206 rises from about @xmath207 in the lowest to roughly @xmath208 in the highest @xmath189-bin . in contrast to that for the central @xmath198-bin this ratio is about @xmath209 , while the most forward or backward bins it is roughly @xmath210 .",
    "however in both cases the bins contain on average @xmath211 of the total average @xmath1 yield .",
    "the effect of energy conservation is thus weaker for cuts in rapidity than for cut in transverse momentum , see also appendices [ app_pt ] and [ app_y ] .      in figs .",
    "[ dodp_chr ] the transverse momentum ( left ) and rapidity ( right ) dependence of the scaled variance is presented for two different values of charge density .",
    "similar to the ce , in mce the effective size of the heat and charge bath matters .",
    "we find that in general mce effects for negatively charged particles are stronger ( weaker ) when the electric charge density is negative ( positive ) . in the limit of a strongly positively charged system",
    ", the @xmath1 subsystem could be considered as embedded in a large heat , charge , and momentum bath ( provided by @xmath0 and @xmath2 particles ) and mce effects would cease",
    ". the gce would here be the appropriate limit . in the opposite limit of a strongly negatively charged system ,",
    "charge conservation essentially becomes equivalent to particle number conservation .",
    "this scenario might be more familiar from textbooks , where the ce is usually understood as the ensemble with fixed particle number .",
    "however here also the same arguments as above apply , except the effect would be much stronger , and @xmath212 .",
    "in general one would expect that suppression effects in bins of high transverse momentum or high values of rapidity are stronger the more abundant the analyzed particle species is . in the context of heavy ion collision",
    "this implies that mce effects should be stronger for positively charged particles than for negatively charged particles , due to the fact that the created system carries positive net - charge .",
    "previous work suggests that the asymptotic values for the scaled variance are indeed reached rather quickly @xcite and above results are certainly applicable to large systems expected to be created in relativistic heavy ion collisions .",
    "some concluding remarks seems to be in order .",
    "although it might seem inappropriate to use the mce formulation of a hadron resonance gas model for calculation of multiplicity fluctuations in heavy ion collisions , as energy and volume can not be assumed to be the same in all events , it should be stressed that gce and ce still imply a very particular type of heat ( and momentum ) bath , namely an infinite ( and ideal ) one .",
    "this assumption seems to us even less appropriate .",
    "also the mce is often understood as the ensemble with energy ( and charge ) , however not momentum conservation .",
    "it is usually assumed that taking momentum conservation into account will not affect fluctuations in the large volume limit .",
    "we have shown @xcite in a recent paper that this is indeed the case , when one assumes information about all produced particles .",
    "however for calculations of multiplicity fluctuations in arbitrary finite subsystems in momentum space all kinematic conservation laws need to be taken into account .    in a realistic heavy ion experiment it seems impossible to measure the entire final state of each collision .",
    "the observed subsystem could therefore be seen as effectively embedded into a ( possibly much larger ) heat , charge , and momentum bath .",
    "sometimes it is therefore argued that , when investigating only a small part of a statistical system ( canonical or micro - canonical ) , one can ignore correlations of the subsystem under investigation with the remaining system .",
    "this argument is often applied when considering yields and/or fluctuations in a limited segment of momentum space .",
    "more precisely , usually the gce is thought to be the appropriate ensemble to model fluctuations of particle multiplicity or particle ratios found in some mid - rapidity interval @xcite . in this work",
    "we have argued that this assumption should be checked carefully .",
    "the gce is only the correct ensemble to choose , if heat and charge bath are assumed to be infinite , while the observed subsystem remains finite .",
    "based on our previous line of arguments , one would also expect that strong collective longitudinal and transverse flow would lead to a strong correlation of macroscopic subsystems .",
    "longitudinal momentum conservation implies that when  observing  in an event a final state with a certain small ( large ) number of produced particles at very forward rapidity , a similarly small ( large ) number of particles should exist at backward rapidities .",
    "particles in these bins carry substantial longitudinal momenta , and hence energy .",
    "modest fluctuations in their numbers should therefore induce stronger fluctuations in the central rapidity region .",
    "the same line of arguments is applicable to the transverse momentum dependence .",
    "one would therefore expect a similar momentum space dependence of experimentally measured charged particle multiplicity fluctuations as shown in figs .",
    "[ dodp ] .",
    "this argument is additionally supported by urqmd simulations @xcite . in transport calculations the produced systems",
    "stay far away from global or local equilibrium @xcite and other ( dynamical ) mechanisms might lead to similar effects . on the other hand",
    "could one also infer from @xcite that even in non - equilibrium systems correlations due to exactly enforced conservation laws determine the general trend , although transport simulations show , for instance , a very different dependence of multiplicity fluctuations on beam energy @xcite than statistical equilibrium models .",
    "this should be subject of further investigation .",
    "finally , and most importantly , we want to stress that recently presented preliminary na49 analysis of multiplicity fluctuations in certain rapidity and transverse momentum windows @xcite shows qualitatively the very same trends as they are suggested by the mce formulation of the statistical model .",
    "data , urqmd simulations , and the statistical model exhibit suppressed multiplicity fluctuations when bins with high transverse momentum ( or high values of rapidity ) are compared to bins of same mean multiplicity at lower transverse momentum ( or lower values of rapidity ) .",
    "we are certainly tempted to interpret this rather unexpected common behavior as a manifestation of energy and momentum conservation effects .",
    "we have discussed the effect of momentum space cuts on multiplicity fluctuations in the framework of an ideal classical pion gas in the three standard ensembles , gce , ce , and mce . only in the mce",
    "we expect a momentum space dependence of multiplicity fluctuations , when comparing intervals of same average multiplicity . we have shown that even in the thermodynamic limit energy - momentum conservation can leave a sizable effect in the fluctuation pattern .    in a previous publication",
    "we have argued that despite the fact one may expect event - by - event fluctuations of the thermal energy , i.e. the part of the total energy which goes into thermal particle production rather than collective expansion , these event - by - event fluctuations remain small compared to energy fluctuations one would expect from grand canonical and canonical ensembles . in this work",
    "we have shown that energy and momentum conservation lead to a non - trivial momentum space dependence of the fluctuation pattern .",
    "this argument seems to be strongly supported by data .    above results",
    "become all the more interesting when compared to models which seek to describe effects beyond our considerations . in fact",
    "our calculations suggest a similar strength of respective suppression or enhancement as they were predicted as signals for the critical point of strongly interacting matter , the onset of deconfinement , or generally a possible phase transition .",
    "one might also be tempted to argue , that enhanced fluctuations around mid - rapidity , when compared to a more forward rapidity slice , should be interpreted as a signal of a phase transition from a quark gluon plasma to a hadron gas phase , expected to be first realized in the presumably hotter and denser central rapidity region .",
    "however in this case there should be a non - monotonic variation as center of mass energy of colliding nuclei is changed .",
    "this seems not to be supported by preliminary na49 data .    in summary , above results should be treated as a prediction for general trends of multiplicity fluctuations in limited segments of momentum space .",
    "the existence of this general behavior should be further tested by current experiments .",
