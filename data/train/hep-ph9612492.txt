    "in the past decade the effort invested in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions ( urhic ) has grown considerably @xcite .",
    "the general hope is , that at some time in the near future one may be able to observe an excursion of strongly interacting matter from the state of hadrons before the collision into the phase of a quark ",
    "gluon plasma ( qgp ) .",
    "consequently , the discussion of possible signals from such a shortlived state is quite vivid : weakly interacting probes like photons or lepton pairs , as well as strongly interacting signals like those presented by quark flavors of higher mass have been proposed .",
    "similar to most of these investigations is the assumption of a _",
    "thermalized _ plasma phase , followed by the calculation of the time evolution along one or the other line of physical reasoning .    with the present paper",
    "we address the question , whether such a thermalized phase is reached at all .",
    "we limit ourselves to the physical scenario that one may reach in future urhic : a sea of gluons , initially at low temperature , is heated to a very high temperature over a short time . in this _ hot glue _ , quark - antiquark pairs are popping up  until at the very end a thermal equilibrium in the sense of a degenerate plasma is reached . of great interest also for the future experiments is the time scale for this equilibration .",
    "if one considers quarks and gluons in a standard ( boltzmann - like ) transport theory , this time scale is obtained as @xmath0 1 fm / c  short enough to reach a pseudo - equilibrium in the time span available in heavy ion collisions .",
    "however , we have serious doubts that the requirements for the applicability of kinetic gas theory are fulfilled in a qgp : the thermal scattering of constituents occurs so frequently , that subsequent collisions overlap quantum mechanically .    in other words",
    ", we expect that in a qgp the _ off - shell _ propagation of particles plays an important role and therefore the quasi - particle approximation is not applicable .",
    "formally , we describe this by including a nontrivial spectral function of the constituents , i.e. , in the description we go beyond the quasi - particle approximation .",
    "however , the spectral broadening of particles in a hot plasma , although described on the same footing as a gas of resonances , does not imply that our particles may decay .",
    "their continuous mass spectrum merely represents the thermal scattering by the other components of the system .    for the limited purpose of the present paper",
    ", we furthermore make some physically motivated assumptions :    1 .   we assume , that the self energy function for the quarks is dominated by gluonic contributions .",
    "this is justified because the quark - quark scattering cross section is much smaller than the quark - gluon cross section .",
    "the gluon background is dominated by external conditions , i.e. , we neglect the back - reaction of quarks on the gluon distribution .",
    "the external conditions determining the gluon field are changing in a short time interval , and the system is translationally invariant in 3-dimensional coordinate space .    for these assumptions , we also have a practical reason : they allow for a clean separation of various aspects of the quantum transport problem , whereas this separation is difficult ( if not impossible ) when considering more realistic systems . while our primary motivation to go beyond the quasi - particle picture therefore is a physical one , we may also adopt a mathematically rigorous stance .",
    "the narnhofer - thirring theorem @xcite states , that interacting systems at finite temperature _ can not _ be described by particles with a sharp dispersion law . ignoring this mathematical fact one finds as an echo serious infrared divergences in high temperature quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) . consequently , these unphysical singularities are naturally removed within the approach of finite temperature field theory with continuous mass spectrum @xcite .",
    "the effect of off - shell propagation on relaxation processes was first investigated by danielewicz @xcite .",
    "he found a substantial slowdown of the equilibration , when solving the full quantum transport equation as compared to the solution of its kinetic approximation .",
    "in later years several attempts were made to unify transport theory with concepts going beyond the quasi - particle picture @xcite .",
    "the connection between transport theory and quantum field theory with continuous mass spectrum was established in refs .",
    "@xcite . a first application of these principles to the qgp relaxation problem @xcite points into the same direction as the results of danielewicz .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in the next section we give a brief introduction into the formalism necessary for non - equilibrium quantum fields . in section iii",
    "we discuss our approximate spectral function , followed by a solution of the quantum transport equation in section iv . in section v we show , how one may derive a transport equation beyond the boltzmann - like quasi - particle approximation from the equations in section iii , and we solve it in section vi .",
    "conclusions are drawn in the final section of the present work .",
    "as has been pointed out by various authors , the description of dynamical ( time dependent ) quantum phenomena in a statistical ensemble necessitates a formalism with a doubled hilbert space @xcite . for our purpose the relevant content of this formalism",
    "is that its two - point green functions are 2@xmath12 matrix - valued .",
    "we leave it to the reader to chose either the conventional schwinger - keldysh , or closed - time path ( ctp ) green function formalism @xcite , or the technically simpler method of thermo field dynamics ( tfd ) @xcite .    within this matrix formulation",
    ", we consider the schwinger - dyson equation for the full quark propagator @xmath2 here @xmath3 is the free and @xmath4 the full two - point green function of the quark field , @xmath5 is the full self energy and the generalized product of these is to be understood as a matrix product ( thermal and spinor indices ) and an integration ( each of the matrices is a function of two space coordinates ) : @xmath6 throughout this paper we use the convention to write space - time and momentum variables also as lower indices , e.g. @xmath7",
    ".    for the purpose of treating transport equations , we switch to the mixed ( or wigner ) representation of functions depending on two space - time coordinates : @xmath8 the @xmath9-sign will be dropped henceforth .",
    "the wigner transform of the convolution @xmath10 as defined in ( [ ovu ] ) is a nontrivial step : formally it may be expressed as a gradient expansion @xmath11 @xmath12 is a 2nd order differential operator acting to the left and to the right side , @xmath13 the arrows on the derivatives display the directions in which they act .",
    "explicitly , the first - order term is @xmath14 i.e. , this is the poisson bracket of the two quantities @xmath15 and @xmath5 .    in the ctp formulation as well as in the @xmath16 parameterization of tfd @xcite , the matrix elements of @xmath4 , the time - ordered propagator @xmath17 , the anti - time - ordered propagator @xmath18 and the 1p - correlations @xmath19 and @xmath20 , are not linearly independent @xmath21 a similar relation holds for the free propagator @xmath3 and with different signs for the components of the self energy : @xmath22 these relations lead to different representations of the retarded and advanced propagators and self - energies @xmath23 due to the above linear relations , the four components of the schwinger - dyson equation are not independent , the matrix equation can be simplified by a linear transformation .",
    "this linear transformation , which one may conveniently express as a matrix transformation @xcite , has a physical interpretation only in the tfd formalism , see ref .",
    "the transformation matrices @xmath24 are @xmath25 depending on one parameter only .",
    "due to the linear relations ( [ sme ] ) and ( [ sse ] ) , we obtain for _ any _ value of this parameter @xmath26 with @xmath27 .    for equilibrium systems the off - diagonal elements of the original matrix valued propagator fulfill the kubo - martin - schwinger ( kms ) condition @xcite @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the fermi - dirac equilibrium distribution function at temperature @xmath30 , @xmath31 it is obvious , that therefore in equilibrium systems the transformation ( [ qptp ] ) with @xmath32 results in complete diagonalization of the matrix @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the same distribution function may also be used to diagonalize the matrix valued self energy function , because it fulfills a relation similar to ( [ kmf ] ) .    in the next step",
    "the above condition is generalized to @xmath33 which _ defines _ the non - equilibrium distribution function @xmath34 depending on coordinates and momenta .",
    "in other words , we choose as non - equilibrium distribution function the parameter which diagonalizes the non - equilibrium propagator under the transformation ( [ qptp ] ) : @xmath35 generally however , this parameter @xmath34 does _ not _ diagonalize the non - equilibrium self energy function . for this purpose",
    "one has to introduce another parameter @xmath36 , and the transformation of the matrix valued self energy function then yields @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the ( common ) imaginary part of retarded and advanced self energy . from this splitting",
    "follows that the off - diagonal element in eq .",
    "( [ sigdia ] ) vanishes for equilibrium states , because then @xmath39 .",
    "this we may use as an indication that the off - diagonal term of ( [ sigdia ] ) is the `` collision term '' of a non - equilibrium system .    the splitting into real and imaginary part",
    "is useful for self energy as well as propagator , @xmath40 each of these functions is assumed to be real , and they are spinor - valued .",
    "the part of the self energy function which is local in space and time , is in our notation included in @xmath41 . for a relativistic model",
    "this is the hartree part of @xmath5 .    from eqns .",
    "( [ sdia ] ) and ( [ sigdia ] ) follows , that the diagonal elements of the matrix transformed schwinger - dyson equation are _ retarded _ and _ advanced _ schwinger - dyson equation .",
    "the off - diagonal element is a _ transport equation _ , because it determines the non - equilibrium distribution function .",
    "as said above , the driving force of the transport part is the deviation of the non - equilibrium distribution function from the corresponding equilibrium distribution function to which the whole system tends .",
    "a special virtue of this formulation is the fact , that with the kms condition ( [ kmf ] ) we have already shown that this non - equilibrium distribution function reaches a fermi - dirac distribution in case we are considering an equilibrium system .",
    "we now consider the equations obtained by action of dirac differential operators (= _ inverse free propagators _ ) on the matrix - transformed schwinger - dyson equation .",
    "they act on the free retarded and advanced propagator as @xmath42 acting with the inverse free propagator on the full schwinger - dyson equation , we obtain @xmath43 adding and subtracting the equations for the retarded and advanced propagators , we obtain equations of motion for the spectral function and the real part of the retarded and advanced propagator @xmath44 for the diagonal components of the transformed schwinger - dyson equation .",
    "the solution in zero order @xmath12 leads to the solution for a equilibrium system .",
    "the equations in first order of the gradient approxiamtion give a transport equation for the spectral function which is in equilibrium solved by the solution in zero order @xmath12 .",
    "a very important fact about these equations has to be emphasized @xcite : in general , they do not admit a @xmath45-function solution for the spectral function @xmath46 even in zero order of the gradient expansion .",
    "this has led to much confusion in papers deriving transport equations from the schwinger - dyson equation .",
    "we therefore state very clearly what is obvious for mathematical as well as physical reasons : there is not such thing as a mass shell constraint in quantum transport theory ! to insert such a constraint into any model by hand must be considered dangerous unless it is tested against the full calculation .",
    "the off - diagonal component of the transformed schwinger - dyson equation reads , after acting on it with the inverse free propagator , @xmath47 ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "a similar equation holds for the propagator @xmath19 @xmath48 using the equation for the spectral function ( eq .",
    "( [ eqsp ] ) ) and @xmath49 , we obtain a differential equation for @xmath34 @xmath50 the transport equations are usually derived by the terms up to first order @xmath12 , but it is visible that transport equations contain in principle arbitrary orders of the operator @xmath12 .",
    "below for a certain approximation the transport equation will be solved up to all orders in the gradient expansion .",
    "as we have seen above , the matrix valued propagator has only three independent components , two of which are furthermore complex conjugate .",
    "we have also shown how one may use the kms condition to eliminate the off - diagonal component of this propagator in favor of the distribution function parameter .",
    "we now tackle the remaining two pieces , i.e. , we deal with retarded and advanced propagator . in coordinate space",
    "they are zero in the forward resp .",
    "backward lightcone ( outside , both are identically zero ) , @xmath51 consequently , their wigner representations are analytical functions in the upper resp . lower complex energy halfplane . hence , even for non - equilibrium states we may write in the mixed ( or wigner ) representation @xmath52 without elaboration at this point we emphasize , that one may _ not _ calculate the real part of the quark propagator by a method different from eq .",
    "( [ rapf ] ) , e.g. perturbatively . in a relativistic system ,",
    "doing so may lead to unphysical poles in the retarded propagator , on the wrong side of the real energy axis ",
    "the retarded propagator then does _ not _ fulfill eq .",
    "( [ raff2 ] ) .",
    "the principal difference between equilibrium and non - equilibrium states at this point are the properties of the function @xmath53 in equilibrium states it has _",
    "spectral _ properties , i.e. , it is normalized and _ positive semidefinite_. in non - equilibrium states positivity is not guaranteed , we can only use the term `` spectral function '' in a generalized fashion .",
    "normalization of the @xmath54-component of @xmath55 according to @xmath56   = 2 \\;\\ ] ] is guaranteed also in non - equilibrium states : it is a consequence of the canonical anti - commutation relations for the fields .    for equilibrium states we may now combine the facts into a very compact notation for the matrix valued propagator , using the bogoliubov matrix defined in ( [ lc ] )",
    "@xcite @xmath57 for free fermions of mass @xmath58 the spectral function is @xmath59 instead of attempting a fully self - consistent numerical calculation of the spectral function for non - equilibrium states , we make another approximation .",
    "it is assumed , that the spectral function of the interacting system does not differ too much from the spectral function of quasi - particles . in particular",
    ", we make the ansatz : @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the effective mass @xmath62 , see below .",
    "hence , we approximate the quark spectral function by two time - dependent parameters @xmath63 and @xmath64 , which we may interpret as effective quasi - particle energy and effective spectral width and describe the energy pole as a function of time . one may argue about the validity of this approach , in particular whether not a momentum dependent spectral width is an absolute necessity for a realistic calculation .",
    "let us discuss this in three steps .",
    "first of all , in ref.@xcite the same approximation was used to obtain numerical results for photon radiation rates from a hot qgp .",
    "it was found , that in the proper temperature and energy regions these results agree very well with the hard thermal loop approximation scheme of qcd .",
    "secondly , we may safely assume that the quarks appearing in the hot medium are slow  hence the properties of the quark distribution may be safely approximated by those of quarks at rest .",
    "third , and more important from the aspect of model consistency is the fact that the expectation value of the anti - commutator of two quark fields is @xmath65 with our ansatz for the spectral function it is easy to show , that this commutator vanishes for spacelike distances @xmath66 _ also _ in case @xmath63 and @xmath64 are time - dependent @xcite .",
    "conversely , for a general momentum dependence of the parameters @xmath67 and @xmath68 this can not be guaranteed .",
    "by inspection of eqs .",
    "( [ diae ] ) and ( [ trae ] ) we find , that beyond this only a quark self energy function is needed for a full determination of the function @xmath46 . this self energy function is in general a functional of @xmath46 again  which then leads to a complicated set of integro - differential equations for the self consistent determination of the retarded and advanced propagator . however , for the limited purpose of the present paper we have formulated simple approximations in the introductory part of the present paper .    in our equations",
    "these ideas are introduced through replacing the @xmath69 dependence of the self energy completely by a dependence on @xmath70 , @xmath71 in other terms , we take as the physically most important pieces of the self energy function the dirac scalar real part , and the dirac  vector",
    " imaginary part .",
    "the parameters @xmath72 , @xmath73 , denote the constant quark mass shift before and after time @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 denote the corresponding temperatures .",
    "@xmath77 is some numerical factor given below .",
    "this ansatz corresponds to instantaneous heating of the gluon background and describes quarks in the corresponding complex external field .",
    "it is different from a previous treatment off the relaxation problem @xcite , where only the imaginary part of the self energy function was used as input .",
    "in the following we discuss the solutions for the time - dependent functions @xmath63 and @xmath64 from our ansatz for the spectral function , which are obtained when inserting the ansatz for the self - energy . indeed , using this self energy it is possible to solve the r.h.s . of the equation of motions of the retarded and advanced functions to all orders in the gradient expansion ,",

    "thus , only the zeroth order terms in the gradient expansion remain on the l.h.s .. taking the unphysical limit of vanishing spectral width , the above equations lead to the mass shell constraint . the other two , possible combinations pick out the drift term contributions and lead to transport equations for the real and imaginary part of @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",

    "3 , the quantum delay time decreases with increasing temeprature .",
    "however , the highly nonlinear nature of our coupled equations leads to a non - analytical dependence of this delay time on the temperature .    for our model calculation ,",
    "this behaviour is examined in more detail in fig .",
    "4 , where we plotted values of the time @xmath129 needed to reach 90 % of the final occupation number for quarks at rest . the curve parameter is the critical temperature in the range from 150 to 250 mev , marking the boundaries of the range of currently accepted phase transition temperature from nuclear to quark matter .",
    "values for @xmath129 are given only for @xmath130 .",
    "to draw conclusions from the present paper , we work backwards starting from fig . 4 and 5 .",
    "the most prominent fact inferred from these figures is the lenghtening of the relaxation time for a qgp by a factor @xmath01.5 due to quantum effects .",
    "this result is qualitatively as well as quantitatively similar to the results obtained for different systems , cf .",
    "@xcite . also , the absolute value of the relaxation time is comparable to thermalization times generally accepted for quark matter @xcite , but systematically higher than 1 fm / c .    in particular :",
    "using a phase transition temperature of 160 mev as obtained in various realistic calculations , together with a final temperature only moderately higher than this @xmath131 , the time @xmath129 to reach a 90 % thermalized qgp is @xmath0 3.6 fm / c . in our view",
    ", this time scale is much too long to sustain the constant  hot glue  scenario .",
    "the natural conclusion therefore would be , that with a moderately ultrarelativistic heavy - ion collison one might probably see a phase transition to quark matter  but most ceratainly not a _",
    "thermalized _ plasma phase .",
    "the quantum effects we find have a straightforward physical interpretation :  collisions  need a certain time to build up .",
    "however , in our view this straightforward interpretation is very misleading .",
    "we have shown , that the `` quantum delay '' is due to the spectral width of the quarks in the hot medium .",
    "this spectral width is a manifestly non - classical effect , to attribute it to `` collisions '' is sneaking the mechanistic quasi - particle picture back into the physical description .    that this picture is in profound contradiction to our results is obvious from the quantum oscillations in fig . 2 and 3 .",
    "such quantum oscillations must be taken rather serious , because in a completely different area of physics they are even established experimentally : they seem to play an important role in four wave mixing of ultrashort laser pulses @xcite . consequently ,",
    "neither the effective mass , nor the spectral width parameter are monotonous functions .    to our knowledge",
    "there is no principle which would forbid such oscillations also in the occupation number parameter @xmath132 .",
    "indeed , a close look at the results reveals such oscillations in the derivative of our solution , albeit not strong enough in the present model to lead to a piecewise diminishing @xmath132 .    with the present paper ,",
    "we have taken the non - equilibrium character of our quantum system more serious than a realistic description of the interaction .",
    "in particular , we made a physically motivated ansatz for all three independent elements of the @xmath133 matrix valued self energy function .",
    "one might argue , that in a  real  plasma of gluons and , eventually , quarks this interaction is much more complicated .",
    "this is true in principle , buth it is not clear to what consequence : the highly nonlinear nature of the quantum transport problem might well lead to an enhancement of the effects we observe .",
    "a calculation within another scheme , where the real part of the self energy function was treated differently @xcite , indeed indicates _ more _ quantum oscillations than obtained here .    a final remark of the present paper concerns the use of old - style classical transport equations for strongly interacting systems like colliding nuclei :",
    "as we have shown , it is not justified a priori , i.e. , without checking against a solution of the matrix valued schwinger - dyson equation .",
    "in this appendix we present some derivations used above to obtain @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath132 .",
    "the real and imaginary part of the self - energy can be splitted into a constant part and a part being only proportional to a @xmath134-distribution in time . @xmath135",
    "the contributions of the constant parts of the self - energy can be evaluated trivially , when inserting the ansatz for the spectral function .",
