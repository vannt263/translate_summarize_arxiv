    "the sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) effect @xcite constitutes a unique and powerful cosmological tool ( for reviews , see rephaeli 1995a , birkinshaw 1999 , carlstrom , holder , & reese 2002 ) .",
    "many tens of high quality images of the effect have already been obtained with interferometric arrays operating at low frequencies on the rayleigh - jeans side of the spectrum .",
    "multifrequency sz measurements were made of only very few clusters , so the potential power of spectral diagnostics has not yet been sufficiently exploited to reduce signal confusion and other errors .",
    "systematic uncertainties are the main hindrance to the use of the effect as a precise cosmological probe",
    ". these can be most optimally reduced when high spatial resolution x - ray and spectral sz measurements of a large sample of _ nearby _ clusters are available in the near future .",
    "the multifrequency capability of many upcoming ground - based bolometric array projects is crucially important for the separation of the sz signal from the large confusing atmospheric signals .",
    "the sz effect was measured in the coma cluster with the ground - based owens valley radio observatory ( ovro ; herbig , lawrence , & readhead 1995 ) and millimeter and ir testa grigia observatory ( mito ; de petris 2002 ) telescopes .",
    "wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe _",
    "( _ wmap _ ) team has recently reported measurement of the effect in coma at 61 and 94 ghz @xcite ; this is the first measurement of the sz effect from a satellite .",
    "together , these measurements yield the first sz spectrum with six spectral bands . the relatively wide spectral coverage obtained with ground- and space - based telescopes",
    "allows a much - needed gauge of the impact of atmospheric emission on high - frequency ground - based observations of the sz effect .",
    "the quality of the spectral results allows a meaningful determination of the hubble constant , @xmath4 . even though this important parameter is thought to have been determined quite precisely from the _ wmap _ first - year sky survey ( bennett 2003a ) , it is , of course , very much of interest to measure it independently by various methods .",
    "the determination of @xmath4 from cluster sz and x - ray measurements yields additional insight beyond what is offered by an all - sky cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropy survey : in principle , the cluster sz & x - ray ( sz - x ) method provides a test of both the isotropy of the cosmological expansion and its temporal character . in this letter",
    "we briefly discuss the qualitative deductions that can be drawn from the general agreement between the ground - based and _ wmap _ results , and use the full database on coma to determine @xmath4 .",
    "the rich nearby coma cluster has long been a prime target of sz observations ( birkinshaw , gull , & northover 1981 , silverberg 1997 ) ; the effect was detected towards coma with the 5.5 m ovro telescope , with a 7.3 beam , operating at 32 ghz .",
    "a long series of drift scans with the mito 2.6 m telescope , which had a 16 beam , led to the detection of the effect at three spectral bands centered on 143 , 214 , and 272 ghz .",
    "even though the _ wmap _ telescope is not optimized for sz observations , the effect was detected with the w- and v - band radiometers at 61 and 94 ghz , with beam sizes of 20 and 13 , respectively @xcite",
    ". the predicted sz size of coma is more than @xmath5 , so these measurements were not substantially affected by beam dilution .",
    "results of the measurements are listed in table [ tab : data ] ; these reflect a slight revision of our previously reported sz signals as result of an improved calibration of the the mito measurements @xcite .",
    "the sz spectrum of coma is shown in figure [ fig : sz ] .",
    "note that the mito error bars are about a factor 3 smaller than those of the _ wmap _ data ; this is mainly due to the difference in observing time . given the low signal - to - noise ratios ( s / ns ) of the two _ wmap _ data , the main advantage of these satellite observations lies in the capability of relatively precise calibration through measurements of the modulation of the cmb dipole anisotropy .",
    "this is estimated to be @xmath6 by the _",
    "team , as compared with @xmath7 for mito and from @xmath8 to @xmath7 for ovro .",
    "it is interesting that the relative calibration of mito and _ wmap _ are in agreement to within @xmath7 .",
    "this result provides further support for ground - based sz observations , which are susceptible of substantial uncertainties because of atmospheric emission and use of planetary emission for signal calibration .",
    "however , because of the poor s / n of the _ wmap _ data , the situation with regard to this calibration method is still far from being satisfactory .",
    "we also note that an attempt to explain the ( small ) discrepancy between the mito and ovro measurements as due to confusing cmb anisotropy signal ( de petris _ et al .",
    "_ 2002 ) seems less likely in light of the _ wmap _ results which imply that such a signal is relatively insignificant .    in the relativistically accurate calculation of @xmath9 , the intensity change in compton scattering , its dependence on the gas temperature is no longer linear ( rephaeli 1995b ) , and",
    "can be written in the form ( battistelli 2002 ) i = 2 k^3 t^3 _",
    "t h^2c^2 x^4e^x ( e^x -1)^2 n_e dl , where @xmath10 is the cmb temperature , @xmath11 is the thomson cross section , @xmath12 is the nondimensional frequency , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the electron density and temperature , @xmath15 is the line of sight ( los ) component of the cluster ( peculiar ) velocity in the cmb frame , and @xmath16 .",
    "the integral is over the los through the cluster .",
    "both the thermal and kinematic components of the effect are included in equation ( 1 ) , separately in the first two terms , and jointly in the function @xmath17 .",
    "analytic approximations to the results of the relativistic calculations have been derived to various degrees of accuracy by expansion in powers of @xmath18 and @xmath19 ( , , itoh 1998 ; nozawa , itoh , & kohyama 1998 ; shimon & rephaeli 2003 ; colafrancesco , marchegiani , & palladino 2003 ) .",
    "if the gas is isothermal and the cluster velocity is sufficiently small so that the velocity - dependent terms are negligible ( at the relevant frequencies ) , then @xmath20 , and a one parameter fit can be performed to the spectral sz measurements in order to determine the value of @xmath21 . since the cluster velocity is unknown , the contribution of the kinematic terms can then be treated as a source of systematic error .",
    "the coma cluster was observed by all x - ray experiments ; we use values of the gas parameters as deduced by mohr , mathiesen , & evrard ( 1999 ) from _ rosat _ observations .",
    "the emission - weighted gas temperature is @xmath22 , and the gas core radius , index of the @xmath1-model density profile , @xmath23 ( where @xmath24 is the angular radial variable ) , and central surface brightness are @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 , respectively .",
    "these values are consistent with the results from more recent _ xmm _ measurements .",
    "best fitting the six data points in figure [ fig : sz ] by the calculated spectrum ( taking @xmath22 ) we obtain the central value of the thomson optical depth , @xmath28 , where the error reflects a 68% confidence level uncertainty associated with the @xmath29 minimization procedure and the uncertainty due to the error in the observed electron temperature which contributes @xmath30 .",
    "as is well known , the combination of sz and x - ray measurements yields a determination of the cluster angular diameter distance , @xmath31 , from which @xmath4 can then be deduced by a comparison with the theoretical expression for @xmath31 .",
    "the equation used to determine @xmath31 is obtained by combining the formulae for @xmath32 and the x - ray surface brightness , @xmath33 , through the elimination of the dependence of these quantities on the central electron density .",
    "this procedure has been discussed in detail in numerous works ( holzapfel _ et al .",
    "_ 1997 , hughes & birkinshaw 1998 , furuzawa _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 , reese _",
    "_ 2000 , mason , myers , & readhead 2001 ) and has by now become standard .",
    "here we employ this method to determine @xmath4 for the first time from multispectral measurements of the coma cluster .",
    "assuming an isothermal gas with a @xmath1-model density profile ( cavaliere & fusco - femiano 1976 ) , the intensity change is @xmath34 , and its explicit dependence on @xmath35 and @xmath14 is determined by the form of the analytic approximation to the exact relativistic calculation .",
    "the x - ray surface brightness is s_x= _",
    "jn_e n_j z_j^2 _ bj d = s_x,0 [ 1 + ( / _ c)^2]^(1/2 - 3 ) , [ eq : sx ] where @xmath36 is the cluster redshift , and @xmath37 is the cluster path length along the los in terms of the angular diameter distance .",
    "the sum is over the various ionic species ( j ) , with densities @xmath38 and charges @xmath39 .",
    "the thermal bremmstrahlung emissivity in units of @xmath40 is _",
    "bj= 1.426 10 ^ -27 t_e^1/2 _ _ 1^_2 e^- g_z_j(t_e , ) d , [ eq : la ]",
    "where @xmath41 , @xmath42 is the emitted x - ray photon energy , and @xmath43 is the gaunt factor .",
    "we have used the accurate analytic formula for the gaunt factor given by itoh _",
    "_ ( 2000 , 2002 ) .",
    "a comparison of the deduced value of @xmath31 with the theoretical expression in a cosmological model with a cosmological constant then yields the value of @xmath4 when the values of the cosmological density parameters @xmath44 and @xmath45 are specified .",
    "the final expression for @xmath46 is h_0= 4 c ( 1+z)^4 g(z,_m , _ ) , [ eq : h ] where the integrals over the los have been performed up to a maximal radius of @xmath47 , by defining @xmath48 where @xmath49 . the function @xmath50 is defined as g(z,_m , _ ) = _ 0^z .",
    "the values @xmath51 and @xmath52 have been adopted in the computation .",
    "doing so we obtain h_0 = 84 26 km/(s mpc ) , where the error is determined combining the observed sz ( @xmath3 ) uncertainty and the uncertainties in the x - ray data .",
    "these errors contribute comparably to the overall observational uncertainty in the deduced value of @xmath46 .    to account for the possibility of a nonisothermal profile , we consider a polytropic gas model such that the temperature spatial distribution is @xmath53^{-3\\beta(\\gamma-1)/2}$ ] , with the ( polytropic ) index @xmath54 considered as a free parameter to be determined ( mostly ) from x - ray measurements . ideally , when spatially resolved measurements are available of the x - ray spectrum and surface brightness profile , it is possible to determine values of the central temperature , central density , core radius , and the indices of the @xmath1 and polytropic profiles by direct fits to the data .",
    "this complete procedure will be feasible when the full _ xmm _ data set on coma becomes available .",
    "for now , we use the previously determined _ rosat _ parameters to estimate the implied change in the value of @xmath46 for an _ assumed _ range of values of @xmath54 . for a given value of @xmath54",
    "we determine the central temperature by keeping the emissivity - weighted temperature at its observed value ( which was deduced by assuming an isothermal model ) .",
    "since the observed surface brightness profile is still fitted by a @xmath1-model , but now with the value @xmath55 identified as @xmath56 ( corresponding to the isothermal case , @xmath57 ) , it follows that the @xmath54-dependent value of @xmath1 is @xmath58 we have considered values of @xmath54 in the range @xmath59 - @xmath60 . repeating the above procedure for the determination of @xmath46 for values of @xmath54 in this range , we find that @xmath46 changes by at most 5% with respect to the value computed with @xmath57 .",
    "this variation is well within the observational error quoted above , and the overall estimated level of known systematic uncertainties stemming from additional simplification in the modeling of the gas , such as spherical symmetry , unclumped gas distribution , negligible impact of cmb anisotropy , and the kinematic sz component , as well as other confusing signals .",
    "the additional level of systematic uncertainties in the value of @xmath4 ( deduced from sz - x measurements ) is estimated to be @xmath61 ( rephaeli 1995a , holzapfel _ et al .",
    "_ 1997 , birkinshaw 1999 ) .",
    "our deduced value for @xmath4 is about @xmath61 higher than the current mean value from 33 individual results from the full data set currently available @xcite . given the ( relatively ) large error , it is fully consistent with the recent value derived by spergel _",
    "( 2003 ) from the first year _",
    "wmap _ measurements . clearly , the interest in using the sz - x method to determine @xmath4 is not diminished by the high quality _ wmap _ result .",
    "in addition to the need for alternative independent methods to cmb sky maps , measurement of this basic parameter at many redshifts and directions on the sky yields important additional information on its variation over cosmological time , and test of its predicted isotropy .    the full potential of the sz - x method to determine @xmath4 has not yet been realized .",
    "as has often been stated by rephaeli ( rephaeli 1999 ) , results from this method will be optimized when a large sample of _ nearby _ clusters will be measured by multi - frequency bolometric arrays , and with the availability of high quality x - ray results from the _ xmm _ and _ chandra _ satellites .",
    "many ground - based  and stratospheric ( such as olimpo ; masi _ et al .",
    "_ 2003 )  sz projects will collect sensitive data on a large number of clusters .",
    "the overall impact of these projects is likely to be larger than a single  even if multiyear  satellite project : the main advantages offered by space observations are the very low atmospheric background and a more precise calibration based on the modulation of the cmb dipole ( when compared to calibration by planetary emission ) .",
    "on the other hand , the advantages of ground - based observations ( from dry sites ) are longer observation times , the use of much larger telescopes ( capable of attaining higher angular resolution ) , and overall better control of systematics that can be obtained with dedicated telescopes .",
    "thus , even though future sz all - sky surveys from space experiments will sample a large quantity of clusters , best results on individual clusters are expected from ground - based telescopes .",
    "when the sensitivity of space observations will reach @xmath62 , it will be possible to calibrate ground - based observations with the same precision as with space instruments .",
    "the uncertainty in determining @xmath4 will then be comparable to that reached by _",
    "wmap _ and optical measurements with the _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( key project ) .",
