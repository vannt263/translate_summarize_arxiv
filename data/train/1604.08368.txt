    "in the last decade , intense research activities in topological insulator ( ti ) and topological superconductor @xcite have induced the investigation of topological phenomena in other areas of research .",
    "topological photonics @xcite , acoustics @xcite , magnonics @xcite , phononics @xcite , are such categories . in photonics , various two - dimensional ( 2d ) topological phenomena have been predicted theoretically and confirmed experimentally @xcite .",
    "they yield unidirectional flows of light , being robust against disorder .",
    "they also give a positive feedback to ti physics , because different setups and viewpoints are provided by topological photonics .",
    "in contrast to 2d topological phenomena , it is still embryonic to investigate three - dimensional ( 3d ) topological phenomena in photons . so far",
    ", limited works such as photonic topological crystalline insulators @xcite and photonic dirac or weyl semimetals @xcite have been reported .",
    "this is partly because they require sophisticated designs of complex 3d photonic architectures .",
    "recently , wang et al .",
    "proposed a novel construction of 3d topological phases in a 3d waveguide network @xcite , having its optical realization in mind .",
    "the proposed system can be regarded as a floquet - bloch one , although no periodic drive is introduced .",
    "it has floquet - weyl ( fw ) and floquet - topological - insulator ( fti ) phases , hosting topologically gapless and gapped band structures , respectively .",
    "if such a system is realized experimentally in optics , many interesting physics can be examined .",
    "anderson localization , synthetic gauge fields , and possible interaction effects ( via cavity quantum electrodynamics ) in the fw and fti phases can be investigated in an optical ( bosonic ) platform .    to accelerate this program , here , we present a simple alternative of the 3d waveguide network , namely , a stacked 2d ring network .",
    "it consists of 2d ring network layers stacked in the third direction with interlayer scattering channels .",
    "the 2d ring network has shown its potential for various 2d topological phenomena and can be realized in silicon photonics technologies @xcite . as shown in this paper , the stacked 2d ring network has a similar topological phase structure as in the 3d waveguide network .",
    "this construction seems to be simpler than in the waveguide network , and various interesting phenomena of the monolayer 2d ring network can be integrated .",
    "the network - model description is physically more fruitful than the tight - binding - model description , which is often employed in various contexts . moreover , the ring - network model has a high fidelity in corresponding ring - resonator lattices realized by silicon photonics .",
    "the network model includes a tight - binding - model picture in its weak - coupling regime @xcite , and can describe topological phenomena in a strong - coupling regime , which are not available in the tight - binding model . therefore , the network model is a good starting point to study topological phases in photonics .",
    "our construction of the fw and fti phases are reminiscent of the layered 2d tis @xcite and layered chern insulators @xcite . there , weyl - semimetal and 3d ti phases emerge . in our system , the quasienergy winding inherent in floquet systems plays a crucial role as in the 3d waveguide network . moreover , our system is completely bosonic , having its optical realization in mind .",
    "these properties show a striking contrast to the layered electronic systems .",
    "related 3d network models have been investigated so far , mainly focusing on the anderson localization in layered 2d quantum - hall and quantum - spin - hall systems @xcite .",
    "a different design of 3d network models was introduced by the present author , toward a photonic counterpart of topological crystalline insulator with time - reversal symmetry @xcite . here",
    ", we deal with a system without disorder and time - reversal symmetry and focus on its spectrum as a floquet - bloch system .",
    "our system can be viewed as a floquet system without a periodic drive .",
    "conventional floquet systems are laser - driven ones , in which nontrivial topology can emerge by irradiating electronic systems with a continuous - wave light @xcite . there , the problem is reduced formally to the diagonalization of the time - translation unitary operator for one period .",
    "however , it is often the case that the operator is not easily obtained . in our case ,",
    "the time - translation operator is replaced by a certain unitary matrix to be diagonalized .",
    "the matrix is analytically available in a simple form .",
    "a similar setting as ours takes place in the discrete - time quantum walk , where various topological phases can emerge @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we show theoretically that the stacked 2d ring network layers exhibits both the fw and fti phases .",
    "a detailed analysis on the phase structure is given .",
    "the analysis indicates that the system has robust fw phases bounded by line - node phases . through a collapse of weyl points into line nodes",
    ", the system can exhibit fti phases with gapless surface states .",
    "a topological characterization of the fti phases is made , based on the winding numbers of relevant s - matrices .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we present our model and analytically solve the eigenvalue equation of the bloch modes in the bulk . by studying the possible degeneracy of the eigenvalues ,",

    "the propagation phase of the mode for every 1/8 propagation of the ring is denoted as @xmath3.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=23.0% ]    the layer - by - layer stacking is made in such a way that the adjacent layer has the lateral shift of ( 1/2,1/2 ) and vertical shift of 1/2 in units of the lattice spacing .",
    "the rings are connected in plane at nodes a , b , c , and d , and upward and downward at nodes e and f , respectively . in each ring",
    ", we introduce a counter - clockwise propagating mode whose propagation phase is denoted as @xmath3 for every 1/8 propagation in the rings .",
    "this phase is self - consistently determined in the periodic system where the bloch theorem is applied .",
    "the mode is scattered at the nodes .",
    "hence , we introduce the mode amplitudes @xmath1 at each node .    the scattering at the nodes is described by the hopping s - matrices with @xmath4 where @xmath5 being @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) the unit vector pointing @xmath8 direction .",
    "we will discuss in sec .",
    "iv , how such a scattering can be realized in optical systems .",
    "the scattering is inversion symmetric , because in each scattering element , there is the inversion symmetry with respect to the center of two adjacent nodes .",
    "the s - matrices thus satisfy @xmath9 being @xmath10 the pauli matrix .",
    "therefore , they are written by @xmath11    assuming the perfect 3d periodicity of the structure , the eigenvalue equation for the bulk modes is derived with the aid of the bloch theorem .",
    "it becomes a floquet - bloch form , namely , a diagonalization of the unitary matrix @xmath12 as @xmath13 where @xmath14 here , the propagation phase @xmath3 acts as the quasienergy in the floquet system .",

    "therefore , the quasienergy spectrum satisfies @xmath16 .",
    "the time - reversal symmetry is broken , because solely the counter - clockwise mode is considered .",
    "the broken time - reversal symmetry can be implemented in optical ring - resonator systems as explained in sec .",
    "we can analytically solve the eigenvalue equation .",
    "in doing so , we put @xmath17 , because these parameters merely shift the quasienergy in the bulk band structure .",
    "the two eigenvalues are given by @xmath18 possible degeneracy in the quasienergy spectrum takes place only at @xmath19 .",
    "the degeneracy is , most possibly , point - like .",
    "namely , the degeneracy takes place at certain points in the 3d brillouin zone .",
    "let us study in detail how this happens .",
    "the degenerate point corresponds to @xmath20 , the minimum and maximum values of @xmath21 under real @xmath22 , and @xmath23 s . since @xmath21 is invariant under the exchange of @xmath24 and @xmath25 ,",
    "the minimum and maximum should appear on the plane of @xmath26 in the brillouin zone .",
    "the minimum and maximum require @xmath27 on this plane , so that the degeneracy takes place most probably at certain points there .",
    "moreover , this point - like degeneracy takes place simultaneously at four points in the brillouin zone .",
    "this is because @xmath21 satisfies the following relation : @xmath28 together with the inversion symmetry , the degeneracy takes place simultaneously at @xmath29    we can show that the point - like degeneracy is of the weyl type . to confirm this fact , let us consider the derivative of @xmath30 with respect to @xmath31 around the degenerate point @xmath32 .",
