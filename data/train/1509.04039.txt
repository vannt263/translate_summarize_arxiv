    "conformal field theory ( cft ) is an indispensable framework in deepening our understanding on the universality class of the critical phenomena which goes beyond the renormalization group ( rg ) . despite its incomparable success in 2d , the clues for 3d cft",
    "has been scarce until recently .",
    "the recent breakthrough came from numerical determination for the 3d ising exponents @xcite using the crossing - symmetry sum rule for the @xmath6-symmetric intermediate states in the four - point function @xmath7 of the same scalar field ( the fundamental field @xmath8 in the @xmath9-theory ) .",
    "the key empirical observation , which becomes a cornerstone in this so - called conformal bootstrap approach , was that the scaling dimensions of the spin and energy operator in the ising model corresponds to a  kink \" that emerges along the unitarity upper - bound curve for the dimension @xmath10 of the leading non - trivial @xmath6 symmetric operator @xmath11 as a function of the dimension @xmath12 of the fundamental field .",
    "this singular shape , the kink in the unitarity bound , is shared also in the case of the sum rule for the @xmath0-symmetry , which can be used to map the critical @xmath0 model with @xmath13 on the @xmath12-@xmath14 plane @xcite , where @xmath15 and @xmath14 respectively stand for the dimension of the fundamental field @xmath16 (  @xmath17 \" is an @xmath0 label ) and the dimension of the energy operator @xmath18 , which is the leading non - trivial operator in the @xmath0 singlet sector @xmath19 .    towards an analytic understanding on the consequence of the 3d conformal symmetry , it would be important to aim at a representation theory of the spectrum generating algebra analogous to the degenerate representation in the virasoro algebra @xcite .",
    "another outstanding direction would be to generalize the ideas in the stochastic loewner evolution ( sle ) @xcite so as to describe _ critical geometry _ in 3d .",
    "in this respect , the importance of the continuous family of the critical @xmath0 models below @xmath20 could be emphasized more since in 2d they precisely represent the continuous family of the models described by the sle@xmath21 with @xmath22 via the trigonometric relation @xmath23 mathematicians proved that the hausdorff dimension of sle@xmath21 curves is given by @xmath24 ( beffara s theorem @xcite ) . in physics , the same fractal dimension can be computed from the dimension of the 2-leg operator ( a special case of the watermelon operator for an arbitrary number of legs @xcite ) represented by an @xmath0 symmetric tensor operator @xmath25 , which behaves as a scalar under the spatial @xmath26 rotations . in this paper , we study the 3d @xmath0 model below @xmath20 with a focus on the fractal dimension of the loops in the high - temperature expansion . the fractal dimension may be given by @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the scaling dimension - sector is denoted by @xmath28 following the convention in @xcite .",
    "@xmath29 \" should not be confused with the stress - energy tensor @xmath30 , which has spin @xmath31 with @xmath32 and the fixed scaling dimension @xmath33 .",
    "] of the most relevant operator @xmath25 in the @xmath0 symmetric tensor sector @xmath29 .",
    "apart from the models with @xmath34 , where @xmath28 has been estimated @xcite , there are several important physical cases in 3d , where understanding based on the conformal symmetry , in particular , the determination of the fractal dimensions may be interesting .",
    "the @xmath35 limit of the @xmath0 symmetry , where the degeneracy of @xmath28 and @xmath14 occurs , describes polymer chains under the excluded volume limit ( a self avoiding walk ) as shown in the celebrated work by de gennes @xcite .",
    "a direct approach to this polymer limit makes various ope coefficients singular and makes the current bootstrap method , which hinges on the positivity of the squared ope coefficients ( a main part of the unitarity ) , difficult .",
    "for instance , the square of the ope coefficient @xmath36 for the stress - energy tensor may have a simple pole at @xmath2 since the ward identity tells us that it is inverse proportional to the central charge @xmath37 , which is essentially proportional to the number of components @xmath3 . practically , as @xmath3 tends to zero , this pole seems to result in an effective slowdown of the convergence to the optimal unitarity bound , meaning that the number of derivatives necessary to attain a given precision increases more rapidly .",
    "accordingly , the detection of the kink at @xmath38 within a limited computational cost becomes much more difficult compared with the case of finite @xmath3 ( e.g. @xmath20 ) .",
    "we circumvent this difficulty by assuming that a clear change of the slope @xmath39 for current central charge @xmath4 defined through the conserved current @xmath40 @xcite may correspond to the dimension @xmath15 of the cft .",
    "this analysis leads to the estimate for the fractal dimensions @xmath41 .",
    "the operator content of the @xmath0 model at @xmath1 contains that of the ising model as its singlet sub - sector and its thermodynamical exponents can be determined from the well - studied dimensions @xmath15 for the spin operator and @xmath42 for the energy operator .",
    "since the @xmath43 model contains only one component scalar , it is less noticeable that the dimension @xmath28 of the symmetric  tensor \" @xmath25 may carry important information on the critical exponents .",
    "it is , however , natural to consider that @xmath28 is one of the geometric exponents that determines the fractal dimension @xmath44 for the high - temperture graphs also measured by a monte carlo ( mc ) simulation for the 3d ising model @xcite . as a natural extension of this analysis",
    ", we also give the fractal dimension which would possibly be realized by the magnetic flux loops in an effective gauge theory , which appears , for instance , in the kitaev model plus the local exchange interaction of the ising type @xcite .",
    "an interesting possibility is that the phase diagram of this model ,  magnetic three - state of matter \" ( or its slight extension ) , may contain the fixed point of the 3d @xmath5 superconformal field theory ( scft ) , whose 2d counterpart is a well - established scft @xcite , which may explain the majorana fermion nature of the 2d ising model as the nambu - goldstone fermions associated with a spontaneous breaking of the supersymmetry . unlike in 2d , where the @xmath5 scft corresponds to the universality class of the ising tricritical point @xcite , our view is that the scft and the ising tricritical point are distinct fixed points in 3d .",
    "this 3d scft is also proposed as a boundary effective theory for the topological superconductor @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 model at @xmath45 may be considered as an endpoint of the continuous family of the @xmath0 model in the sense that the dimension for the fundamental field and energy operator reduce to the mean field values - vertex : @xmath46 , which vanishes at @xmath45 , regardless of the space dimension @xmath33 @xcite . ]",
    "@xmath47=@xmath48 and may be paired with the other end point @xmath49 , where the mean field value of @xmath50 and the spherical model value of @xmath51 are realized . among these operators in @xmath45 and @xmath49 ,",
    "the only nontrivial dimension is @xmath52 ; as in 2d @xcite , it would be natural to conjecture that @xmath53 is the fractal dimension of the loop - erased random walk .",
    "apart from the mc simluations already mentioned , there are still vast works of related simulations , among which some notable are certain sophisticated tests of the conformal invariance in the 3d self - avoiding walk ( @xmath35 ) @xcite , the worm algorithm that can be applied for continuous values of @xmath54 @xcite , and certain clever algorithms with analysis that get rid of the correction - to - scaling to attain ever improving precision on the self - avoiding @xcite and loop - erased @xcite random walks .",
    "our emphasis is not on the precision for the critical exponents , though some of them including perhaps the anomalous dimensions slightly above @xmath2 and the fractal dimension for the ising model may already be more accurate than existing mc simulations @xcite . instead , it is our purpose here to consider how the conformal invariance may be used to determine the fractal dimension , without any use of machine generated random numbers , and to help opening a way to understand more theoretical aspects ( such as the kink formation , the representation theory , the 3d sle , and so on ) in the 3d @xmath0 cft in general .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we consider the @xmath0 model for a global range of @xmath55 in section [ section : onglobal ] , and show that the fractal dimension @xmath56 can be regarded as a geometric rg eigenvalue given by the dimension @xmath28 of the traceless symmetric tensor @xmath25 .",
    "section [ section : degeneracy ] is a quantitative discussion on how the gap between @xmath28 and @xmath14 closes in the polymer limit @xmath35 using a simple 6-loop rg analysis leaving the details in appendix . in section [ section : sumrule ] , the intermediate states in the four point function is classified into three sectors ( s : singlet , t : traceless symmetric tensor , a : antisymmetric tensor ) using the operator product expansion ( ope ) @xmath57 of the fundamental fields . the key equation in the @xmath0 conformal bootstrap , namely , the crossing symmetry sum rule is reviewed with a brief discussion of the solution manifold with regard to the unitarity bound . in section [ section : ctcj ] , the definitions and useful @xmath58-expansions of the current central charge @xmath4 as well as those of the standard central charge @xmath37 are given .",
    "the implication of the unitarity and corresponding implementation of the bootstrap , though being standard , are given in section [ section : bootstrap ] .",
    "we present our main results in section [ section : singularshape ] .",
    "we give a qualitative description on how an effective smoothing of the kink in @xmath28 occurs in the polymer limit @xmath35 ( we idenfify it as _ a severe unitarity wall _ , across which the continuation of the unitarity - saturating solution is interrupted ) and discussions on how certain level - degeneracies in the @xmath0 cft would be related to various singular shapes ( the kinks in @xmath28 , @xmath37 , and in particular , @xmath4 ) of the unitarity bounds in section [ section : kink ] and section [ section : slopechange ] , respectively .",
    "we determine the fractal dimensions by the conformal bootstrap for the polymers ( @xmath35 ) in section [ section : n=0 ] and for the 3d ising high - temperature graphs ( @xmath1 ) in section [ section : n=1 ] .",
    "we compute the fractal dimension for @xmath45 in rg and conjecture that it corresponds to that of the loop erased random walk in section [ section : n=-2 ] . in section [ section : susy ]",
    ", we estimate the set of the scaling dimensions @xmath59 for the @xmath5 scft and discuss the relation to the critical exponent @xmath60 as well as the fractal dimension @xmath61 for the corresponding excitation .",
    "we conclude with selected future directions in section [ section : conclusion ] .",
    "we start with the discussion on the two relevant operators @xmath63 and @xmath25 in the @xmath0 model , which respectively belong to the @xmath0-singlet sector ( @xmath19 ) and the @xmath0-symmetric tensor sector ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "these operators are formed as a bilinear of the fundamental field @xmath16 with the scaling dimension @xmath15 , which transforms as a fundamental representation of the @xmath0 group : @xmath64 the energy operator @xmath63 is already in the single component model and plays an essential role in the initial formulation of the conformal bootstrap for the ising model , which has the @xmath65 symmetry @xcite . the most relevant operator @xmath25 in @xmath29 sector is responsible for the crossover phenomena with respect to the symmetry breaking @xmath66 with an arbitrary @xmath67 . as in the general statistical model , the two - point function @xmath68 can be expressed as a sum over self - interacting random walks between @xmath69 and @xmath70 @xcite ( also @xcite ) .",
    "the hausdorff dimension of this random walk is given by @xmath71 @xcite , where @xmath60 and @xmath72 are respectively the correlation length exponent and the crossover exponent @xcite of the @xmath0 model .",
    "since these two independent exponents are related to the scaling dimensions @xmath14 of @xmath63 and @xmath28 of @xmath25 by @xmath73 one has a simpler expression for the hausdorff dimension @xmath74 which may be viewed as a geometric rg eigenvalue @xmath75 in the light of the fact @xcite that the magnetic ( thermal ) rg eigenvalues can be determined by the relation @xmath76 ( @xmath77 ) .    in the range",
    "@xmath78 , this dimension @xmath28 decreases monotonically from a certain value @xmath52 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ndelta ] and below for the meaning ) to the trivial value @xmath79 and at @xmath2 crosses the dimension @xmath14 of the energy operator @xmath63 ( in the @xmath0 singlet sector @xmath19 , as mentioned ) , which in turn increases monotonically from @xmath80 to @xmath81 in the same range of @xmath3 ( one may also notice the asymptotic slopes computed in @xmath58-expansions are symmetric in 3d : @xmath82 ) .",
    "actually , this somewhat dual behavior of @xmath28 and @xmath14 in the global range of @xmath3 is almost shared in the 2d @xmath0 model though the range @xmath83 $ ] should be replaced by @xmath84 $ ] , where the model has a critical point and exact results are available from the coulomb gas @xcite , sle @xcite , and cft torus partition funtion ( as described just below ) for continuous values of @xmath3 ; it is also likely to be a generic feature of the @xmath0 cft in @xmath85 from the rg point of view .",
    "the operator content of the 2d @xmath0 model with @xmath86 can be studied exactly by the torus partition function @xcite . using the coulomb gas coupling @xmath87 ( @xmath88 ) determined by the relation @xmath89 , the central charge ( which is a 2d counterpart of @xmath37 in section [ section : ctcj ] ) and",

    "it is , however , instructive to note that the dimension @xmath97 in the @xmath1 model ( @xmath98 ) is of physical relevance .",
    "namely , it corresponds via to the fractal dimension @xmath99 of the ising interfaces , which are the sle@xmath100 curves .",

    "the 3d curve is obtained as the @xmath108$]-pad approximant for @xmath109 $ ] continued by the curve from the pseudo @xmath107-series ( appendix ) for @xmath110 and should be regarded as schematic as the anomalous dimension tends to be smaller than the genuine value .",
    "the @xmath111 asymptotics ( dotted ) are shown for both scaling dimensions .",

    "besides such physical relevance , the limit @xmath112 is theoretically special for the following two reasons .",
    "first , some of squared ope coefficients may become negative for @xmath113 due to single poles at @xmath2 , which makes it difficult to take the approaches based on the unitarity , on which most of the present conformal bootstrap schemes depend .",
    "second , as mentined above , @xmath2 is the precisely the point where the degeneracy of the two scaling dimensions @xmath14 and @xmath28 take place . as a quick example using in 2d , @xmath114 ( @xmath115 ) coincides with the flory value @xcite @xmath116 . ]",
    "follows from @xmath117 for @xmath2 and the gap opens with the following asymmetric @xmath3-derivatives , @xmath118 it would be notable that this derivative for @xmath28 for 2d is somehow almost unchanged in magnitude for 3d as we will see below . the leading term in the @xmath107-expansion may be compared with as @xmath119 where each contribution of the derivative for @xmath120 is @xmath121 . in appendix , we compute a pseudo @xmath107 series using the input of the 6-loops @xmath102 rg calculations @xcite and present reasonable estimates by a simple pad analysis together with the best - known results of the @xmath107-expansion up to @xmath122 . as a simple estimate , we take the average of the six and five - loops and the maximum deviation as an error .",
    "this gives , @xmath123 the same analysis for the derivatives at @xmath1 ( the ising point ) yields @xmath124 the derivatives for @xmath28 , which are useful in this paper , increases only slightly ( @xmath125 ) in the interval @xmath126 $ ] .",
    "nevertheless , in order to get better estimates , one may found it more useful to keep both and than to choose one of these two .",
    "more concretely , the variation @xmath127 with @xmath128 can be better approximated by @xmath129 times the derivative at the midpoint @xmath130 obtained as a linear interpolation between and .",
    "for instance , a roughest estimate for the variation between @xmath1 and @xmath2 may be obtained as @xmath131 , where the errors in and are assumed to be independent .",
    "although we do not use the last example , which would maximize the uncertainty , one may check through @xmath28 .",
    "however , some crudest benchmark for the singlet dimension is possible using @xmath132 obtained for the ising model @xcite as follows : @xmath133 , which is consistent with @xmath134 in section [ section : n=0 ] as expected . ]",
    "this estimate may reasonably connect the results obtained independently by conformal bootstrap in section [ section : n=0 ] ( @xmath2 ) and in section [ section : n=1 ] ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "the crossing symmetry sum rule used in this paper is the most basic one ( in the sense it does not involve the mixed correlators @xcite ) in the conformal bootstrap for the cft with a global @xmath0 symmetry @xcite as described briefly below .",
    "the fundamental field in this theory is a scalar operator @xmath16 , which transforms as an @xmath0-vector , with dimension @xmath12 .",
    "crucially , the ope of @xmath16 with itself may be decomposed into three sectors : @xmath135}^{a , \\delta , \\ell},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath19 , @xmath29 , and @xmath136 denote the @xmath0 singlets sector of even spin , the @xmath0 symmetric tensor sector of even spin , and the @xmath0 anti - symmetric tensor sector of odd spin , respectively .",
    "note that there is an infinite tower of the scaling dimensions @xmath137 for the states with fixed @xmath138 in each sector .",
    "the dependence on @xmath69 is omitted on the right hand side .",
    "the sets of the ope coefficients @xmath139 ( with @xmath140 and the tensor labels are omitted ) encode important dynamical information in the @xmath0 cft and satisfy highly nontrivial constraints due to the associativity of the operator algebra .",
    "these constraints can be expressed as a sum rule that follows from the equivalence ( the crossing symmetry ) of the two different expansions of a single four point function @xmath141 from the two distinct degeneration limits ( @xmath142 and @xmath143 ) , where the contribution from the identity operator , which belongs to the singlet ( @xmath19 ) sector , becomes dominant .",
    "let us write the contribution from each sector in the ope in the channel @xmath142 as follows : @xmath144 here in the first sum , the set @xmath145 includes all the operator in @xmath19-sector except the the identity operator @xmath146 , for which the contribution for the four - point function is simply @xmath147 , which is usualy the dominant contribution in the limit @xmath142 .",
    "for concreteness , we note that the conformal partial wave ( global conformal blocks ) @xmath148 in @xmath33-dimensions is a function of the two cross - ratios given as @xmath149 and has the following form @xcite in terms of the radial coordinates @xmath150 @xmath151 where the coefficients @xmath152 with @xmath153 can be iteratively fixed by the casimir differential equation for the @xmath33-dimensional conformal group , and @xmath154 with @xmath155 is the gegenbauer polynomial .",

    "an important one - parameter - family solution , which is conveniently parametrized by @xmath15 , can be singled out along the boundary of the unitarity ( dictated by the lower bounds and the positivity ) , whose projection onto @xmath15-@xmath28 plane is shown for each @xmath3 in fig .",
    "[ fig : kink ] .",
    "as is well - known , the search for this unitarity saturating solution can be formulated as a linear optimization problem ( see section [ section : bootstrap ] for more details ) and can be solved with the aid of knowledge on the global conformal blocks @xmath176 such as that in .    in order to clear up a common source of confusion ,",
    "it is worth to make a careful distinction between the spectrum of the @xmath43 model ( @xmath1 ) and that of the ising model in our formulation .",
    "the ising ( @xmath6 ) sum rule , which is used in @xcite for instance , follows from the crossing symmetry of the four - point function for a single scalar @xmath177 . since only the singlet fields appear in the ising ope @xmath178 , the whole contribution in @xmath142 except that from the identity operator may be denoted as @xmath179 .",
    "then the crossing symmetry leads to @xmath180 , which further simplifies to , @xmath181 now the logic is as follows .",
    "a proper subset and of the @xmath0 sum rule for @xmath1 implies the ising sum rule , which , along with the requirements of saturating unitarity ( and ) , is sufficient for a given @xmath15 to single out a unique solution for @xmath179 .",

    ", width=453 ]      the first is on the convergence of the bound to the optimal shape with respect to the truncation of the derivative orders @xmath262 on the conformal block @xmath237 , which is currently unavoidable in numerics .",
    "although the upper - bound obtained in a finite truncation is rigorous , a larger number @xmath241 of derivatives leads to more restrictive bound ( i.e. a lower upper - bound ) and actually makes the kink more sharp , where the convergence to the optimal bound tends to be faster than that in the rest . in addition to this , the convergence becomes much slower in the polymer limit @xmath35 .",
    "thus a bruteforce approach to the limit is taking @xmath241 large enough with respect to a given small @xmath3 . in practice",
    ", the unitarity bound for @xmath28 looks smooth for @xmath263 , which makes the detection of the kink ( a discontinuity in the slope ) becomes very hard within a reasonablely large number of derivatives ( @xmath245 ) . here",
    "it would be also worth noting the present guess on the optimal shape ( @xmath264 ) for the limit @xmath35 .",
    "on the right of the kink , the convergence of the slope @xmath208 to a almost constant , as in the cuves for @xmath257 , seems to be plausible . on the left , finite-@xmath241 curves",
    "are convex upward as in fig .",
    "[ fig : kink ] .",
    "it seems , however , there are no strong indications that excludes the possiblity that the optimal shape on the left is also almost straight in 3d , while there is a 2d example where the bound is likely to be convex downward @xcite . in general , it would be interesting to consider if there is a principle that forbids the optimal unitiarity bound for these scaling dimensions be convex upward with some reasonable assumptions",
    ". we will give a qualitative argument in section [ section : slopechange ] on the enhanced slope @xmath265 on the left of the kink in view of the level dynamics .",
    "the slowdown of the convergence is probably related to the degeneracy of two levels @xmath266 and _ the severe unitarity wall _ at @xmath2 , where some squared ope coefficients may be @xmath267 for three energy operators , which would play a role in the mixed correlator bootstrap @xcite .",
    "the physical origin of the divergence of @xmath267 can be traced back to the strong repulsion between the loop segments @xmath63 in the @xmath268 loop model @xcite . ] including @xmath269 for the stress - energy tensor has a pole , which can be seen by the relation from the ward identity and by our observation that the ratio @xmath270 remains finite @xmath271 . the detailed analysis on this",
    "special limit @xmath35 and quantitative knowledge on the order of convergence in the conformal bootstrap in general might be useful and would deserve further investigation .",
    "the second remark is especially relevant if one tries to find the upper bound for @xmath210 by the @xmath210-bisection in the case @xmath272 . in @xcite",
    ", it was found useful to complement the unitarity lower bounds by an extra gap assumption that scalar fields ( @xmath215 ) in the right hand side of the ope be bounded below by the rg canonical dimension : @xmath273 this has previously been used in order just to improve numerical stability @xcite ; in particular , the condition @xmath274 in @xmath102 was not supposed to change the resulting solution of - through the @xmath210-bisection .",

    "this phenomenon may remind us of a level repulsion between @xmath28 and @xmath14 in the solution space that becomes stronger as @xmath35 .",
    "accordingly , if one sticks to keep the extra condition @xmath274 , the @xmath210-bisection yields another unphysical solution the saturation of may not be so serious as the kink in @xmath210 appears around the expected ising position , which should be consistent with our observation that the ope coefficient @xmath277 of the ( unphysical ) level @xmath278 is negligible compared to those for other operators .",
    "however , below @xmath1 this makes much difference : for instance , a kink in @xmath14 emerges even in @xmath38 , which was smoothed in the solution with the pure unitarity conditions .",
    "again , it is obvious that this solution with @xmath278 can not represent a physical spectrum . ] which contains @xmath279 and thus saturates the extra gap assumption set by hand .",

    "as we have just seen , besides the direct role of determining the fractal dimension , the property that @xmath28 has the lowest dimensions ( like a ground state in quantum mechanics ) in the right hand side of the ope adds the study of @xmath28 a special importance .",
    "the singular shape is not restricted to the unitarity bound for scaling dimensions ; it may also appear in the unitariy bound for the ope coefficients of the conserved currents such as @xmath30 and @xmath187 , which are via the ward identities reflected on sudden changes of the slopes in the central charge @xmath37 and the current central charge @xmath4 defined in .",
    "we show @xmath282 and @xmath4 for @xmath283 in fig .",

    "this corresponds to the asymptotics of these central charges given by ; for a finite @xmath3 , not too small , these slopes are actually shared as the initial slopes for small @xmath286 , where the effective interaction may be weak . in the case of our interest ( @xmath35 ) , a change of the slope @xmath39 is enhanced and an effective minimum is formed for @xmath287 . the effective minimum is used to estimate the dimension @xmath15 of the fundamental field in @xmath35 in section [ section : n=0 ] . before this application , we present some preliminary analysis on the mechanism ( _ a level dynamics _ along the unitarity saturating solution that connects the free field theory and the @xmath0 cft , where the levels are essentially eigenvalues of the infinite dimensional matrix obtained by linearizing the rg flow around the fixed point in the theory space ) behind the formation of these kinks .    as @xmath288 corresponds to the free field theory , the effective anomalous dimension @xmath289 may be considered as an effective interaction parameter . if one traces the spectrum of scaling dimensions along the unitarity bound , one will meet a reorganization of the spectrum when @xmath15 crosses the value at the kink @xmath290 , which is expected to be @xmath291 of the @xmath0 cft as a similar phenomenon has been observed in the ising model @xcite . along the unitarity - saturating solution for the crossing symmetry of the @xmath0 sum rule",

    "although the nearest levels in this case ( e.g. @xmath307 and @xmath308 ) never touch with each other within a finite numerical bootstrap , it is also suggested that the recombination transition becomes shaper and eventually the nearest levels would be connected in the limit of the infinite number of derivatives ( @xmath309 ) . in this regard ,",
    "the connection between both sides for a large , but finite @xmath241 would also seem to be , @xmath310 where the levels on the right bifurcate ( or possibly multifurcate ) to the left as represented by the symbol  @xmath311 \" . here in the connection @xmath312 ,",

    "it is also worth to mention that if the decoupling operator @xmath306 on the left indeed disappears in the ideal limit @xmath317 , the connection is then more like @xmath318 where all the connections of the levels may be continuous ( with no gap left ) and may have smoother ( or even no ) kinks compared with that of the lowest one ( @xmath319 ) . in the scalar ( @xmath215 in @xmath19- )",
