    "ergodicity plays a fundamental role in the formulation of statistical physics .",
    "this property is usually stated by saying that ensemble average and time average of observables are equals , the last one being taken in the long time ( infinite ) limit .",
    "in contrast with thermodynamical systems , where the lack or ergodicity is induced by a spontaneous symmetry breaking goldenfeld , the disparity between ensemble and time averages may also be found as an emergent property of complex systems . named as weak ergodicity breaking ( eb ) @xcite ,",
    "this feature is induced by the power - law nature of the statistical distributions associated to the observables and their dynamics @xcite .",
    "time averages in presence of weak eb remain random even in the long time limit .",
    "their statistics , termed as weakly non - ergodic statistical physics @xcite , define a still very active line of research .",
    "continuous time random walk characterized by divergent trapping times is a natural frame where weak eb was studied @xcite .",
    "in addition , diverse kinds of complex anomalous diffusion processes are a natural partner of weak eb .",
    "analysis were performed for particles embedded in heterogenous media @xcite , periodic potentials @xcite , and in homogeneous disordered media @xcite .",
    "geometric @xcite , escaled @xcite  and ultraslow @xcite brownian motions , as well as diffusion induced by the combined action of different driven noises @xcite , convoluted memory processes @xcite  and langevin dynamics @xcite also were characterized from a similar perspective .",
    "in addition to its theoretical interest , weak eb was also found in different physical systems such as deterministic dynamics golan , albers , filho , akimoto and blinking nanocrystals nanocrystal , margolin ; also in molecular transport @xcite and tracking of biological single molecules @xcite  such as lipid granules @xcite , and diffusion in the plasma membrane of living cells @xcite .",
    "weak eb also arises in complex networks geneston , west , fluid turbulence @xcite and brain dynamics ross .",
    "weak eb can be studied in systems that have associated a stationary state , such as for example random walks on finite domains , and also in non - stationary systems such as unbounded diffusive ones ( see for example refs . @xcite and @xcite respectively ) .",
    "independently of the dimensionality , weak eb is in general associated or related to some underlying self - similiar ( effective ) mechanism characterized by power - law distributions .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to demonstrate that systems whose dynamics involves global memory effects may also develop eb .",
    "furthermore , we establishes that the lack of ergodicity may happens even in absence of statistical properties ( residence times ) characterized by dominant power - law distributions .",
    "global memory ( or correlation ) effects refer to systems whose stochastic dynamics at a given time depends on its whole previous temporal history ( trajectory ) .",
    "these kinds of dynamics has been studied previously gunter , gandi , kenkre , katja , boyer , kursten , kim , esguerra , hanel , mainly as a mechanism that induces superdiffusion .",
    "in contrast , here we study random walk processes defined over a finite set of states where the persistence in a given state or the transition to another one depends on the previous system trajectory .",
    "the random times between consecutive steps is defined by a set of waiting time distributions with finite average times .",
    "in addition , our main results rely on alternative memory mechanisms .",
    "they are related to a plya urn dynamics @xcite , which is one of the simplest models of contagion process , being of interest in various disciplines @xcite .",
    "in contrast to other global correlation mechanisms , the urn - like dynamics is able to induce weak eb .",
    "interestingly , the departure from ergodicity arises even when the ( average ) residence times in each state are finite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we introduce the globally correlated random walk model .",
    "the probability density of time - averaged observables is obtained in general . in sec .",
    "iii , we study three different global memory mechanisms : the elephant random walk model , a random walk driven by an urn - like dynamics , and an imperfect case of the last one . in sec .",
    "iv , for all models , we obtain the probability density of the residence times . sec .",
    "v is devoted to the conclusions .",
    "analytical calculations that support the main results are presented in the appendixes .",
    "in this section we introduce the globally correlated random walk model and study its properties . the probability density of time - averaged observables is also obtained .",
    "the system is characterized by a finite set of states @xmath0 to each state @xmath1 we assign a waiting time distribution @xmath2 which gives the statistics of times between consecutive steps of the stochastic dynamics .",
    "we assume that all average times@xmath3are finite , @xmath4    the stochastic dynamics is as follows . at the beginning ( initial time )",
    ", each state is selected in agreement with a set of probabilities @xmath5 @xmath6 normalized as @xmath7 given that a state @xmath1 is selected , the system remains in it during a random time selected in agreement with the waiting time distribution @xmath8 after this step , the system may remain in the same state or jump to another one .",
    "hence , it may _ persists _ in the same state , remaining an extra time interval chosen in agreement with the same waiting time distribution , or _ jump _ to a different state with a different waiting time distribution .",
    "this dynamic repeats itself in time after each step , where step refers to the process of selecting the next state .",
    "the state corresponding to the next step is chosen in agreement with a conditional probability @xmath9 [ denoted as @xmath10.$ ] here , @xmath11 indicates the number of steps performed up to the present time , while @xmath12 gives the number of times that each state @xmath13 was chosen previously .",
    "then , @xmath14  the dependence of the process on the whole previous trajectory ( global correlation ) is given by the dependence of @xmath15 on the set @xmath16 the previous definitions completely characterize the stochastic dynamics in terms of the initial probabilities @xmath17 the waiting time distributions @xmath18 and the conditional ( or transition ) probabilities @xmath19    for the studied models [ see eqs .",
