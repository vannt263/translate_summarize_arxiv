    "in this paper we will discuss the spectral decomposition of an affine hecke algebra @xmath0 defined over @xmath8 or , more precisely , of a natural positive trace @xmath9 defined on @xmath0 . in the standard basis of @xmath0 ,",
    "@xmath9 is simply defined by @xmath10 and @xmath11 if @xmath12 .",
    "in addition , @xmath0 comes equipped with the natural @xmath13-operator @xmath14 .",
    "this defines a pre - hilbert structure on @xmath0 by @xmath15 .",
    "the regular representation @xmath16 extends to the hilbert completion @xmath17 of @xmath0 , and by the spectral decomposition of @xmath9 we mean the decomposition of @xmath17 in irreducible @xmath13-representations of @xmath18 . by classical results on the decomposition of traces on @xmath19-algebras of type i",
    "( see for example @xcite ) , this is equivalent to the problem of decomposing the trace @xmath9 as a superposition of irreducible characters of @xmath13-representations of @xmath0 .",
    "we will call this decomposition the plancherel decomposition of @xmath0 , and the associated positive measure on the spectrum @xmath20 will be called the plancherel measure .    in the case of a hecke algebra of finite type",
    "we have the well known decomposition formula @xmath21 where @xmath22 denotes the poincar polynomial of @xmath0 ( we assume that @xmath23 ) , @xmath24 runs over the finite set of irreducible representations of @xmath0 , @xmath25 denotes the corresponding character of @xmath24 , and @xmath26 is the generic degree of @xmath24 .",
    "the formula we are going to discuss in the present paper is the affine analog of equation ( [ eq : finite ] ) .",
    "this paper is the sequel to @xcite , where we made a basic study of the eisenstein functionals of an affine hecke algebra @xmath0 .",
    "these eisenstein functionals are holomorphic functions of a spectral parameter @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is a complex @xmath5-dimensional algebraic torus naturally associated to @xmath0 . in @xcite",
    ", we derived a representation of @xmath9 as the integral of the normalized eisenstein functional times the holomorphic extension of the haar measure of the compact form of @xmath28 , against a certain `` global @xmath5-cycle '' ( a coset of the compact form of @xmath28 ) in @xmath28 .",
    "the kernel of this integral is a meromorphic @xmath29-form on @xmath28 .",
    "the present paper takes off from that starting point , and refines step - by - step the above basic complex function theoretic representation formula for @xmath9 until we reach the level of the spectral decomposition of @xmath9 , extended to a tracial state on the @xmath19-algebra hull @xmath30 of the regular representation of @xmath0 ( main theorem [ thm : mainp ] ) . on the simpler level of the spherical or the anti - spherical subalgebra ,",
    "a similar approach can be found in @xcite and @xcite . in the case of the spherical algebra one",
    "should of course also mention the classical work @xcite , although the point of view is different there , and based on analysis on a reductive @xmath31-adic group .",
    "there are various motivations for the study of the spectral resolution of @xmath9 .",
    "a natural application of such a decomposition is the p - adic analog of the howlett - lehrer theory for finite reductive groups , see for instance @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "here one considers an affine hecke algebra which arises as the centralizer algebra of a certain induced representation of a p - adic reductive group @xmath32 .",
    "the plancherel measure of @xmath0 can be interpreted as the plancherel measure of @xmath32 on a part of @xmath33 in this situation . in view of this application",
    "it is important that we obtain an ( almost ) explicit product formula for the plancherel measure ( see main theorem [ thm : mainp ] ) .",
    "in addition we characterize exactly which characters @xmath34 of the spectrum of the center @xmath4 of @xmath0 support a discrete series representation of @xmath0 ( see theorem [ thm : support ] ) .",
    "these are the so - called `` residual points '' ( see appendix [ sub : defn ] ) .",
    "this result was recently applied to the representation theory of reductive p - adic groups , see @xcite .",
    "another motivation for this approach is that it sets the stage for the definition of a schwartz - completion @xmath35 of @xmath0 ( see subsection [ sub : normunif ] ) , and for the subsequent study of the fourier transform and its inversion on the level of this frchet algebra ( joint work with patrick delorme , to appear ) .",
    "this is related to the study of the k - theory and the cyclic homology of @xmath0 and its reduced @xmath19-algebra @xmath30 , in the spirit of @xcite , @xcite .",
    "this point of view is particularly interesting for non - simply laced cases , since it is natural to expect that the k - theory does not depend on the parameters @xmath36 of the hecke algebra . on the other hand , in the `` generic case '' these matters seem to be considerably easier to understand than in the `` natural cases '' , where the logarithms of the parameters have rational relations . in view of this",
    ", it is important that we allow the parameters @xmath36 of the affine hecke algebra to assume any real value @xmath37",
    ".      it may be helpful to give the reader a rough outline of this paper , and an indication of the guiding principles in the various stages .",
    "we also refer the reader to subsection [ sub : out ] for a more detailed outline and formulation of the main results ( see in particular [ sl2 ] , [ sl3 ] for the results on the plancherel measure ) .",
    "the starting point of the present paper is the definition of the eisenstein functional of the affine hecke algebra , in @xcite .",
    "these functionals are matrix coefficients of minimal principal series modules .",
    "the study of their intertwining operators led to a representation of the trace @xmath9 of @xmath0 , as an integral of a certain rational kernel over a `` global '' cycle ( see formula ( [ eq : basic ] ) ) .",
    "( 1 ) . in section",
    "[ sect : pre ] we recall the definition and first properties of ( extended ) affine hecke algebras , we collect some basic facts from the theory of @xmath19-algebras , and we adapt certain classical results from the representation theory of reductive groups to our context .",
    "we conclude this section with a discussion of the properties of the natural map @xmath38 , the spectrum of the center @xmath4 of @xmath0 , in view of the main results of this paper .",
    "the study of the residues of the rational kernel for @xmath9 as in formula ( [ eq : basic ] ) , in section [ sec : loctau ] .",
    "this involves a general ( but basic ) scheme for the calculation of multivariable residues .",
    "after symmetrization over the weyl group , the result is a decomposition of @xmath9 as an integral of local tracial states against an explicit probability measure on the spectrum @xmath39 .",
    "the main tools in this process are the _ positivity _ of @xmath9 , and the geometric properties of the collection of residual cosets ( appendix [ sub : defn ] ) .",
    "this step is called the `` localization of the trace @xmath9 '' .",
    "the local trace ( as was mentioned in ( 2 ) ) defined at an orbit @xmath40 , arises as an integral of the eisenstein kernel over a `` local cycle '' which is defined in an arbitrarily small neighborhood of the orbit @xmath41 .",
    "this gives a natural extension of the local trace to localizations of the hecke algebra itself ( localization as a module over the sheaf of analytic functions on @xmath7 ) .",
    "the analytic localization of the hecke algebra has a remarkable structure discovered by lusztig in @xcite .",
    "this part of the paper is not self - contained , but draws heavily on the paper @xcite . by lusztig",
    "s wonderful structure theorem we can now investigate the local traces . we find in this way that everything is organized in accordance with harish - chandra parabolic induction ( the philosophy of cusp forms ) .",
    "the local traces at residual cosets give rise to finite dimensional hilbert algebras which we call `` residual algebras '' . their generic structure reduces ( via parabolic induction ) to the case of the residual algebras at `` residual points '' of certain semisimple subquotients of the hecke algebra ( see subsection [ sub : gene ] ) .",
    "these matters concerning the localization of @xmath0 are studied in section [ sect : loc ] , leading to the main result theorem [ thm : mainp ] .",
    "the support of the plancherel measure and the plancherel density are expressed in terms of the discrete series of levi subquotient algebras of @xmath0 , and their plancherel masses ( formal dimensions ) .",
    "( 4 ) . at this point ,",
    "two essential problems remain : the classification of the discrete series representations , and the determination of their formal dimensions .",
    "regarding the first problem , we have determined the orbits @xmath34 which arise as the central character of a discrete series representation of @xmath0 in theorem [ thm : support ] .",
    "we have no further information to offer on this problem in this paper .    section [ sec : inv ] is devoted to the second of these problems . in order to explain our approach ,",
    "let @xmath42 denote the plancherel mass of the central character @xmath43 with respect to the restriction of the tracial state @xmath9 to the center @xmath4 of @xmath0 . in subsection [ sub :",
    "chia ] we find that the formal dimension of an irreducible discrete series representation @xmath44 whose central character is a certain residual point @xmath43 , is equal to the product of @xmath42 and a certain positive real number @xmath45 ( called `` the residual degree '' of @xmath44 ) depending on @xmath44 ( see corollary [ cor : fdim ] and theorem [ thm : nu ] ) .",
    "( these residual degrees are normalized such that @xmath46 , where the sum runs over all square integrable @xmath44 whose central character is @xmath43 ) .    _",
    "the factor @xmath42 is a certain explicit product ( explicit up to a nonzero rational multiple ) of rational functions evaluated at the central character @xmath43 . _",
    "the problem that arises here is that we have not much information about the behaviour of the individual `` residual degrees '' @xmath47 as functions of the parameters @xmath36 .    in section [ sec : inv ]",
    "we resolve this matter .",
    "if we write the labels @xmath48 in the form @xmath49 for certain real numbers @xmath50 and @xmath51 , we prove that the residual hilbert algebras are _ independent _ of the base @xmath51 . in other words ,",
    "the constants @xmath45 are independent of @xmath51 .",
    "this proves that _ all irreducible discrete series representations of @xmath0 associated with a central character @xmath43 , have a formal dimension which is proportional to the mass @xmath42 , with a positive real ratio of proportionality which is independent of @xmath51_.    in addition we conjecture that the positive reals @xmath47 are actually rational numbers ( cf . conjecture [ rem : ell ] ) .",
    "this conjecture is subject of joint work in progress with mark reeder and antony wasserman .",
    "( 5 ) . in appendix",
    "[ sub : defn ] we study the geometry of the set of singularities with maximal pole order of the rational @xmath5-form @xmath52 on @xmath28 .",
    "this leads to the notion `` residual coset '' , which is crucially important for the understanding of the residues of the kernel for @xmath9 in ( [ eq : basic ] ) .",
    "it is analogous to the notion of residual subspace which was introduced in @xcite",
    ". the collection of these cosets can be classified , and from this classification we verify certain important geometric properties of this collection .",
    "these geometric facts are used in section [ sec : loctau ] ( especially in subsection [ sub : chia ] ) to establish regularity properties of the residues to be considered in this paper .",
    "let us make some remarks about the `` residue calculus '' on which much of this paper is ultimately based",
    ". at the heart of it lies the elementary lemma [ thm : resbasic ] , which is an adapted version of lemma 3.1 of @xcite .",
    "this lemma roughly states that on a complex torus @xmath28 , any linear functional @xmath9 on the ring of laurent polynomials @xmath53 $ ] of the form @xmath54 where @xmath55 is a rational @xmath29-form whose pole set is a union of cosets of codimension @xmath56 subtori of @xmath28 , can be represented by a unique collection of `` local distributions '' living on certain cosets of the compact form @xmath57 of @xmath28 , and satisfying certain support conditions .    in the context of the representation theory of @xmath0 ,",
    "this lemma becomes remarkably efficient .",
    "we apply the lemma to linear functionals of the form @xmath58 , where @xmath59 and @xmath60 , a maximal abelian subalgebra of @xmath0 , using formula ( [ eq : basic ] ) . at this stage",
    "we symmetrize the `` local distributions '' for the action of @xmath61 . using the elementary notion of `` approximating sequence ''",
    "( see lemma [ lem : approx ] ) it is not hard to show that the symmetrized local distributions inherit the positivity of @xmath9 .",
    "this implies easily that these symmetrized distributions are in fact compactly supported measures on the spectrum @xmath7 of the center @xmath62 of @xmath0 , with values in the positive traces on @xmath0 ( see corollary [ cor : exten ] ) .",
    "this means that all higher order terms in the local distributions cancel out by the symmetrization by @xmath61 .",
    "in addition it follows by positivity that all measures are absolutely continuous with respect to a scalar measure @xmath63 , the plancherel measure of the center @xmath4 of @xmath0 .",
    "in fact @xmath63 is obtained by evaluation of the symmetrized local distributions at @xmath64 .",
    "fortunately the poles of formula ( [ eq : basic ] ) simplify to the poles of expression ( [ eq : simple ] ) by this evaluation .",
    "in this way we see that the contributions at non - residual , quasi - residual cosets must cancel .",
    "we can bring into play the geometric properties of the residual subspaces now , established in appendix [ sub : defn ] , to prove that the plancherel measure is smooth on its support , that the local traces are tempered , and that the local traces at discrete mass points of @xmath63 are finite linear combinations of discrete series characters .",
    "we get in this way a decomposition of @xmath9 as a superposition of positive `` local traces '' , which is an important step towards the plancherel decomposition of @xmath0 .    at the time of the writing of the paper @xcite ,",
    "working on the quantum theory of a certain exactly solvable @xmath5-particle systems , we were not aware of the already existing results in the spirit of the above lemma on existence and uniqueness of residue distributions .",
    "but we should certainly mention here the basic work of langlands @xcite , where residues of eisenstein series are studied in the theory of automorphic forms for reductive groupes .",
    "we also mention the work of arthur @xcite , @xcite in this direction .",
    "langlands work @xcite was elucidated by moeglin and waldspurger in @xcite .",
    "langlands result on existence of `` residue data '' can be found in theorem v.2.2 , and on uniqueness of `` residue data '' in the formulation of theorem v.3.13(i ) of @xcite .",
    "it should be pointed out however that these results are of a different nature than our basic lemma [ thm : resbasic ] .",
    "lemma [ thm : resbasic ] is a ( very elementary ) general result in distribution theory , which has nothing to do with group theory . on the other hand ,",
    "the above results in @xcite are formulated with already symmetrized `` residue data '' , using intertwining operators . in order to even formulate a uniqueness property in this setting ,",
    "one first needs to show rather deep statements on the holomorphic continuation of certain residue sums of eisenstein series ( see v.3.2 of @xcite ) .",
    "more recently , inspired by the approach in @xcite , van den ban and schlichtkrull @xcite extended the method by allowing for so - called residue weights . in this generality",
    "they applied the residue calculus in their proof of the plancherel formula for semisimple symmetric spaces .",
    "the algebraic background for our analysis was discussed in the paper @xcite .",
    "the main result of that paper is an inversion formula ( see equation ( [ eq : basic ] ) ) which will be the starting point in this paper .",
    "the purpose of this section is to define the affine hecke algebra @xmath0 and to review the relevant notations and concepts involved in the above result .",
    "moreover we introduce a @xmath19-algebra hull @xmath30 of @xmath0 , which will be the main object of study in this paper .",
    "finally we will give a more precise outline of the results in the paper .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite and @xcite for a more systematic introduction of the basic algebraic notions .",
    "a reduced root datum is a 5-tuple @xmath65 , where @xmath66 and @xmath67 are free abelian groups with perfect pairing over @xmath68 , @xmath69 is a reduced integral root system , @xmath70 is the dual root system of coroots of @xmath71 , and @xmath72 is a basis of simple roots .",
    "each element @xmath73 determines a reflection @xmath74 by @xmath75 the group @xmath61 in @xmath76 generated by the @xmath77 is called the weyl group .",
    "as is well known , this group is in fact generated by the set @xmath78 consisting of the reflections @xmath77 with @xmath79 .",
    "the set @xmath78 is called the set of simple reflections in @xmath61 .    by definition",
    "the affine weyl group @xmath80 associated with a reduced root datum @xmath81 is the group @xmath82 .",
    "this group @xmath80 naturally acts on the set @xmath66 .",
    "we choose once and for all a rational , symmetric , positive definite , @xmath61-invariant pairing @xmath83 on @xmath84 .",
    "this defines a @xmath61 pairing on the euclidean spaces @xmath85 and its dual @xmath86 .",
    "the action of @xmath80 on @xmath66 extends to an action of @xmath80 on @xmath87 by means of isometries .",
    "we can identify the set of integral affine linear functions on @xmath66 with @xmath88 via @xmath89 .",
    "it is clear that @xmath90 defines an action of @xmath80 on @xmath91 .",
    "the affine root system is by definition the subset @xmath92 .",
    "notice that @xmath93 is a @xmath80-invariant set in @xmath91 containing the set of coroots @xmath94 .",
    "every element @xmath95 defines an affine reflection @xmath96 , acting on @xmath66 by @xmath97 the reflections @xmath98 with @xmath99 generate a normal subgroup @xmath100 of @xmath80 , where @xmath101 denotes the root lattice @xmath102 .",
    "we can choose a basis of simple affine roots @xmath103 by @xmath104 where @xmath105 consists of the set of minimal coroots with respect to the dominance ordering on @xmath67 .",
    "it is easy to see that every affine root is an integral linear combination of elements from @xmath103 with either all nonnegative or all nonpositive coefficients .",
    "the set @xmath93 of affine roots is thus a disjoint union of the set of positive affine roots @xmath106 and the set of negative affine roots @xmath107 .",
    "the set @xmath108 of simple reflections in @xmath80 is by definition the set of reflections in @xmath80 associated with the fundamental affine roots .",
    "they constitute a set of coxeter generators for the normal subgroup @xmath109 .",
    "there exists an abelian complement to @xmath110 in @xmath80 .",
    "this is best understood by introducing the important length function @xmath111 on @xmath80 .",
    "the splitting @xmath112 described above implies that @xmath113 when @xmath114 .",

    "this shows that the set @xmath122 of elements of length @xmath123 is a subgroup of @xmath80 which is complementary to the normal subgroup @xmath110 , so that we have the decomposition @xmath124 hence @xmath125 is a finitely generated abelian group .",
    "let @xmath126 ( where @xmath22 denotes the weight lattice ) denote the homomorphism that is adjoint to the inclusion @xmath127 . if we write @xmath128 for its kernel ,",

    "we have @xmath130 where @xmath131 is free and @xmath132 is finite .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath131 is the subgroup of elements in @xmath66 that are central in @xmath80 .",
    "the finite group @xmath133 acts faithfully on @xmath108 by diagram automorphisms .",
    "the dual cone @xmath134 of the cone @xmath135 spanned by the positive roots is called the cone of dominant elements of @xmath66 .",
    "thus @xmath136 belongs to @xmath134 if and only if @xmath137 for all positive roots @xmath138 .",
    "notice that @xmath139 equals the sublattice @xmath128 of translations of length @xmath123 .",
