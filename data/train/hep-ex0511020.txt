    "since the lhc kinematic region is much broader than currently explored , we will have the unique opportunity to test qcd at very @xmath9 , where predictions are extremely important for precise measurements and new physics searches at the lhc : at the electro - weak ( _ ew _ ) scale the theoretical predictions are dominated by _",

    "studies  @xcite show that the pdf uncertainty on the standard model ( _ sm _ ) higgs cross section prediction is @xmath10 and that in some extra dimensions scenarios the high-@xmath4 gluon uncertainty can decrease the discovery reach in di - jet cross section measurements from @xmath11 to @xmath12 .",
    "the high-@xmath4 quark uncertainty dominates the drell - yan cross section increasingly with the di - lepton invariant mass scale : @xmath13 at @xmath14 .",

    "the photon and jet @xmath19 distributions are extremely sensitive to pdf differences : the discrepancy between different pdf sets can be of the order of @xmath20 . this measurement could constrain the gluon distribution at mid - to - high-@xmath4 .",
    "the challenge for the atlas detector is to reliably discriminate between photons and jets with a high @xmath0 selection efficiency , currently estimated to be greater than @xmath21  @xcite .",
    "the inclusive jet cross section is particularly sensitive to new physics , but experimental and theoretical errors can distort the measurements and predictions creating false signals of new physics .",
    "the experimental uncertainty is dominated by the jet energy scale , the main sources of theoretical uncertainties are the renormalisation , factorisation scales and the pdf uncertainty .",

    "however , this requires controlling the systematic errors such as the jet energy scale .",
    "the uncertainties on @xmath1 and @xmath2 boson production cross sections are dominated by the pdf uncertainty : the @xmath1 and @xmath2 rapidity distributions are theoretically known to nnlo  @xcite , with residual scale dependence @xmath27 , whereas the total pdf uncertainty at @xmath28 , corresponding to @xmath29 , is @xmath30  @xcite ( see fig .
