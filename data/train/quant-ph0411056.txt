    ".5 cm since its introduction by schrdinger @xcite , coherent states ( css ) have attracted considerable attention in the literature @xcite .",
    "a variety of coherent states , e.g. , minimum uncertainty coherent state ( mucs ) , annihilation operator coherent state ( aocs ) , displacement operator coherent state ( docs ) and recently klauder type cs @xcite , possessing temporal stability , have been constructed and applied to diverse physical phenomena @xcite .",
    "coherent states of systems possessing nonlinear energy spectra are of particular interest as their temporal evolution can lead to revival and fractional revival , leading to the formation of schrdinger cat and cat - like states @xcite . a celebrated example in quantum optics of the aforementioned phenomenon",
    "is the coherent state in a kerr type nonlinear medium @xcite . in quantum mechanical potential problems , hamiltonians for potentials like , pschl - teller ,",
    "morse and rosen - morse ( rm ) lead to nonlinear spectra .",
    "time evolution of the css for these potentials , a subject of considerable current interest @xcite , can produce the above type of states .",
    "the simplest way to construct css is a symmetry based approach @xcite .",
    "it is well - known that making use of the heisenberg algebra @xmath0=1 $ ] , one can construct all the above type of css for the harmonic oscillator , which are identical to each other . in many physical problems , groups like su(2 ) and",
    "su(1,1 ) manifest naturally , enabling a straightforward construction of css . for the identification of the symmetry structure of quantum mechanical potential problems ,",
    "recourse has been taken to a number of approaches , starting from the factorization property of the corresponding differential equations .",
    "for the so called shape invariant potentials , super symmetric ( susy ) quantum mechanics @xcite based raising and lowering operators have found significant application .",
    "a klauder type cs , using a matrix realization of the ladder operators , has also been constructed @xcite .",
    "the fact that , susy ladder operators act on the hilbert space of different hamiltonians , has led to difficulties @xcite in proper operator identification of the symmetry generators .",
    "the ladder operators have been taken to be functions of quantum numbers , which makes the corresponding algebraic structure ambiguous .",
    "this , in turn , creates difficulty in establishing a precise connection between the complete set of states describing the cs and the symmetry of the potential under consideration . in a number of approaches",
    "an additional angular variable have been employed @xcite to identify su(1,1 ) type algebras for describing the infinite number of states of some of these potentials . taking advantage of the shape invariance property , quantum group type algebras",
    "have also been used for describing the hilbert spaces @xcite .",
    "recently , a general procedure for constructing css for potential problems have been developed by some of the present authors @xcite .",
    "the approach makes use of novel exponential forms of the solutions of the differential equations associated with these potentials for identifying the symmetry generators @xcite .",
    "no additional variables are introduced and unlike susy based approaches one stays in the hilbert space of a given quantum problem while unravelling its symmetry structure .",
    "the present paper makes use of this approach to study the docs of the pschl - teller potential .",
    "the primary motivation for considering the pschl - teller potential is two - fold .",
    "first of all , it has a quadratic spectrum leading to a rich revival structure for its cs , which can lead to the formation of cat - like states .",
    "secondly , many other potentials can be obtained from the pschl - teller potential by appropriate limiting procedure and point canonical transformations .",
    "hence , the css obtained in this case may have relevance to other potentials .",
    "the temporal evolution , auto - correlation and quantum carpet structures @xcite of the css are carefully analyzed for delineating their structure and various time scales present in this problem .",
    "these properties are then contrasted with the corresponding ones of the aocs @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the following section",
    ", we briefly outline the procedure to identify the symmetry generators for quantum mechanical potential problems , based on hypergeometric and confluent hypergeometric equations .",
    "these symmetry generators are then used for constructing the docs for general quantum mechanical potential problems .",
    "dual nature of the docs with the aocs is algebraically established . in section 3 ,",
    "the docs for the pschl - teller potential is constructed and its properties studied .",
    "we identify and analyze the various time scales of the system in section 4 and compare the quantum evolution of the cs with the classical motion .",
    "we conclude in section 5 , after pointing out various directions for further work .",
    ".5 cm as is well - known , the schrdinger equation for a number of solvable potentials can be connected with the hypergeometric ( hg ) and confluent hypergeometric ( chg ) differential equations ( des ) .",
    "for example , harmonic oscillator , coulomb and morse potentials belong to the chg class , whereas pschl - teller and rosen - morse belong to the hg class .",
    "below , we briefly outline the steps of a novel procedure for solving des which connects the solution of a de with the space of monomials @xcite .",
    "this is subsequently used for identifying the symmetry generators underlying quantum mechanical potential problems",
    ".    a single variable linear differential equation can be easily cast in the form , @xmath1y(x)=0   \\label{mainequation}\\ ] ] where the first part @xmath2 is a function of the euler operator @xmath3 , possibly including a constant term and @xmath4 contains all other operators present in the de under study .",
    "the solution can be written in the form , @xmath5^n x^\\lambda\\ ; , \\label{solution}\\ ] ] with the constraint @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "using eq .",
    "( [ solution ] ) the polynomial solutions of the hg and chg can be written in closed form exponential forms @xcite : @xmath7 and @xmath8 the exponential forms of these solutions are ideal for identifying algebraic structures of the solution spaces . for that purpose ,",
    "one first identifies raising and lowering operators in the space of monomials .",
    "the operators at the level of polynomials can be obtained through similarity transformations .",
    "the simplest lowering operators at the level of monomial for chg and hg functions can be taken @xcite as    @xmath9    respectively .",
    "the only criterion in choosing these operators at the monomial level is that , these do not lead to divergent expressions after the similarity transformation .",
    "it can be easily shown that , for the chg case , the following generator form a su(1,1 ) algebra at the monomial level : @xmath10 similarly , for the hg case , the su(1,1 ) generators are given as , @xmath11    modulo a normalization , the docs for the hg type de can be written , at the monomial level , as @xmath12 here , @xmath13 is the fiducial state satisfying , @xmath14    to find the cs @xmath15 at the level of the polynomial , we make use of the exponential form of the solution in eq .",
    "( [ hyper ] ) .",
    "the docs , @xmath15 , can then be written as , @xmath16^{n } x^0\\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}\\frac{\\beta^{n}}{n ! } \\frac{\\gamma{(b+n)}}{\\gamma{(b)}}e^{-k_{-}}x^n\\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}\\frac{\\beta^{n}}{n ! } ( -1)^n\\frac{\\gamma{(c+n)}}{\\gamma{(c)}}\\;_2f_1(-n , b , c , x)\\;.\\nonumber\\\\ \\label{generalcoherentstate}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is worth noting that , since the similarity transformation does not affect the algebraic structure , the su(1,1 ) algebras remain intact at the polynomial level , albeit with different expressions for the generators .",
    "it is interesting to note that , at the monomial level , the docs found above is nothing but the aocs of @xmath17 , i.e. @xmath18 , where @xmath19    one notices that @xmath20=1 $ ] .",
    "hence , the above procedure is akin to the oscillator construction of aocs .",
    "we can also identify a @xmath21 , which leads to the oscillator algebra @xmath22=1 $ ] : @xmath23 the aocs considered earlier @xcite , is the eigen state of @xmath24 and is of the form @xmath25 .",
    "this relationship between docs and aocs has been referred earlier as duality of these two type of css @xcite .",
    "thus far , the specific nature of the potential has not been invoked .",
    "now , we shall use this form to find out the cs for pschl - teller ( pt ) potentials .",
    ".5 cm the trigonometric pschl - teller potential belongs to the hg class having an infinite number of bound states .",
    "hence it is natural to expect an underlying su(1,1 ) algebra as its spectrum generating algebra . in reference",
    "@xcite aocs of the pschl - teller potential has been constructed , making use of a novel exponential form of the solution of the hypergeometric differential equation .",
    "below we will concentrate on the construction of docs , following the same procedure and study its properties .",

    "[ sptdn2 ] , we compare the nature of the distributions of the eigen states for aocs and docs . for the purpose of comparison , we have taken the coherence parameters such that , the distributions are comparable . it is found that , both the eigen state distributions , peaked at @xmath42 , involve the same eigen states ( from n=0 to n=30 ) for the same potential ( @xmath38 ) . for aocs , the distribution resembles a gaussian distribution and is more sharply peaked , as compared to the docs .",
    "larger @xmath43 value makes the distribution flatter for docs , as seen in the dashed curve in fig .",
    "[ sptdn2 ] .",
    "we now proceed to study the spatio - temporal dynamics of these wave packets .",

    "all graphs are plotted in time , scaled by the revival time @xmath47 , .    in order to throw more light on the structure of the revival pattern ,",
