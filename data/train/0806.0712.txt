    "we consider a tetragonal lattice , appropriate for doped @xmath2 . since our primary interest is in the sc state , we will not consider the translational symmetry broken state such as the spin density wave state observed in the parent compound of @xmath2 .",

    ", we recall that in the single orbital case , the spin - orbit coupling of the cooper pair plays an important role to the non s - wave superconductors , and the symmetry of the gap function is determined by the crystal point group of the lattice and the spin part of the gap function . in the two - orbital system , the orbital degree of freedom is usually coupled to the crystal momentum , hence to the spin via the spin - orbit coupling .",
    "therefore , the spin , spatial , and the orbital parts are generally all related in the gap function .",

    "it is more convenient to use @xmath74 and @xmath75 instead of @xmath66 to classify the pairing states .    due to the fermionic anti - symmetric nature",
    ", the gap function must be anti - symmetric under the two particle interchange , or under a combined operations of space inversion , interchange of the spin indices and interchange of the orbital indices of the two particles .",
    "let @xmath76 be the two particle interchange operator , and @xmath77 be the interchange operator acting on the space , spin , and orbital , respectively , then the fermion statistics requires @xmath78since the system is of inversion symmetry , the pairing states must have either even parity @xmath79 or odd parity @xmath80 .",
    "furthermore , the total spin @xmath81 of the cooper pair is a good number , and this is so even in the presence of @xmath15 , which breaks spin rotational symmetry but keeps inversion symmetry , so that it does not mix the @xmath70 with @xmath68 states .",
