    "quantum dot devices provide a well  controlled object for studying quantum many - body physics . in many respects ,",
    "such a device resembles an atom imbedded into a fermi sea of itinerant electrons .",
    "these electrons are provided by the leads attached to the dot .",
    "the orbital mixing in the case of quantum dot corresponds to the electron tunneling through the junctions connecting the dot with leads .",
    "voltage @xmath0 applied to a gate ",
    "an electrode coupled to the dot capacitively  allows one to control the number of electons @xmath1 on the dot . almost at any gate voltage",
    "an electron must have a finite energy in order to overcome the on - dot coulomb repulsion and tunnel into the dot .",
    "therefore , the conductance of the device is suppressed at low temperatures ( coulomb blockade phenomenon@xcite ) .",
    "the exceptions are the points of charge degeneracy . at these points , two charge states of the dot",
    "have the same energy , and an electron can hop on and off the dot without paying an energy penalty .",
    "this results in a periodic peak structure in the dependence of the conductance @xmath2 on @xmath0 .",
    "away from the peaks , in the coulomb blockade valleys , the charge fluctuations are negligible , and the number of electrons @xmath1 is integer .    every time @xmath1 is tuned to an odd integer , the dot must carry a half - integer spin . in the simplest case ,",
    "the spin is @xmath3 , and is due to a single electron residing on the last occupied discrete level of the dot .",
    "thus , the quantum dot behaves as @xmath3 magnetic impurity imbedded into a tunneling barrier between two massive conductors .",
    "it is known@xcite since mid-60 s that the presence of such impurities leads to zero - bias anomalies in tunneling conductance@xcite , which are adequately explained@xcite in the context of the kondo effect@xcite .",
    "the advantage of the new experiments@xcite is in full control over the `` magnetic impurity '' responsible for the effect .",
    "for example , by varying the gate voltage , @xmath1 can be changed .",
    "kondo effect results in the increased low ",
    "temperature conductance only in the odd@xmath1 valleys .",
    "the even@xmath1 valleys nominally correspond to the @xmath4 spin state ( non - magnetic impurity ) , and the conductance decreases with lowering the temperature .    unlike the real atoms , the energy separation between the discrete states in a quantum dot is fairly small .",
    "therefore , the @xmath4 state of a dot with even number of electrons is much less robust than the corresponding ground state of a real atom .",
    "application of a magnetic field in a few  tesla range may result in a transition to a higher - spin state .",
    "in such a transition , one of the electrons residing on the last doubly  occupied level is promoted to the next ( empty ) orbital state .",
    "the increase in the orbital energy accompanying the transition is compensated by the decrease of zeeman and exchange energies . at the transition point , the ground state of the dot is degenerate .",
    "electron tunneling between the dot and leads results in mixing of the components of the ground state .",
    "remarkably , the mixing involves spin as well as orbital degrees of freedom . in this paper",
    "we demonstrate that the mixing yields an enhancement of the low  temperature conductance through the dot .",
    "this enhancement can be viewed as the magnetic  field  induced kondo effect .",
    "we present the model and theory of electron transport in the conditions of the field - induced kondo effect in section  [ model ] .",
    "the experimental manifestations of the transition observed on gaas vertical quantum dots and carbon nanotubes are described in section  [ exp ] .",
    "we will be considering a confined electron system which does not have special symmetries , and therefore the single - particle levels in it are non - degenerate .",
    "in addition , we assume the electron - electron interaction to be relatively weak ( the gas parameter @xmath5 ) .",
    "therefore , discussing the ground state , we concentrate on the transitions which involve only the lowest - spin states . in the case of even number of electrons , these are states with @xmath4 or @xmath6 . at a sufficiently large level spacing @xmath7 between the last occupied ( @xmath8 ) and the first empty orbital level ( @xmath9 ) , the ground state is a singlet at @xmath10 .",
    "finite magnetic field affects the orbital energies ; if it reduces the difference between the energies of the said orbital levels , a transition to a state with @xmath6 may occur , see fig .",
    "[ crossings ] .",
    "such a transition involves rearrangement of two electrons between the levels @xmath11 . out of the six states involved ,",
    "three belong to a triplet @xmath6 , and three others are singlets ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "the degeneracy of the triplet states is removed only by zeeman energy .",
    "the singlet states , in general , are not degenerate with each other . to describe the transition between a singlet and the triplet in the ground state",
    ", it is sufficient to consider the following hamiltonian : @xmath12 here , @xmath13 is the total number of electrons occupying the levels @xmath11 , operator @xmath14 is the corresponding total spin ( @xmath15 are the pauli matrices ) , and the parameters @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 are the exchange , zeeman , and charging energies respectively @xcite .",
    "we restrict our attention to the very middle of a coulomb blockade valley with an even number of electrons in the dot ( that is modelled by setting the dimensionless gate voltage @xmath19 to @xmath20 ) .",
    "we assume that the level spacing @xmath21 is tunable , _",
    "e.g. _ , by means of a magnetic field @xmath22 : @xmath23 , and that @xmath24 ( which ensures that the dot is non - magnetic for @xmath10 ) .",
    "the lowest  energy singlet state and the three components of the competing triplet state can be labeled as @xmath25 in terms of the total spin @xmath26 and its @xmath27projection @xmath28 , @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the state with the two levels empty . according to ( [ hdot ] ) , the energies of these states satisfy @xmath31 where @xmath32 . since @xmath33 ,",
    "the ground state of the dot at @xmath10 is a singlet @xmath34 .",
    "finite field shifts the singlet and triplet states due to the orbital effect , and also leads to zeeman splitting of the components of the triplet .",
    "as @xmath22 is varied , the level crossings occur ( see fig .",
    "[ crossings ] ) .",
    "the first such crossing takes place at @xmath35 , satisfying the equation @xmath36 at this point , the two states , @xmath34 and @xmath37 , form a doubly degenerate ground state , see fig .",
    "[ crossings ] .",
    "= 5.5 cm    if leads are attached to the dot , the dot - lead tunneling results in the hybridization of the degenerate ( singlet and triplet ) states .",
    "the characteristic energy scale @xmath38 associated with the hybridization can be in different relations with the zeeman splitting at field @xmath39 .",
    "if @xmath40 , then the zeeman splitting between the triplet states can be neglected , and at the @xmath35 point all _ four _ states ( [ basis ] ) can be considered as degenerate .",
    "theory for this case is presented below in section  [ transition ] .",
    "this limit adequately describes a quantum dot formed in a two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) at the gaas - algaas interface , subject to a magnetic field , see section  [ dots ] .",
    "energy @xmath41 can be neglected due to the smallness of the electron @xmath42-factor in gaas .",
    "alternatively , the orbital effect of the magnetic field ( @xmath22-dependence of @xmath21 ) may be very weak due to the reduced dimensionality of the system , while the @xmath42-factor is not suppressed , yielding an appreciable zeeman effect even in a magnetic field of a moderate strength .",
    "this limit of the theory , see section  [ zeeman ] , corresponds to single - wall carbon nanotubes , which have very small widths of about @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "measurements with carbon nanotubes are presented in section  [ nanotubes ] .    in order to study the transport problem",
    ", we need to introduce into the model the hamiltonian of the leads and a term that describes the tunneling .",
    "we choose them in the following form : @xmath45 here @xmath46 for the right / left lead , and @xmath11 for the two orbitals participating in the singlet - triplet transition ; @xmath47 labels states of the continuum spectrum in the leads , and @xmath48 is the spin index . in writing ( [ leads])-([ht ] ) , we had in mind the vertical dot device , where the potential creating lateral confinement of electrons most probably does not vary much over the thickness of the dot@xcite .",
    "therefore we have assumed that the electron orbital motion perpendicular to the axis of the device can be characterised by the same quantum number @xmath49 inside the dot and in the leads .",
    "presence of two orbital channels @xmath11 is important for the description of the kondo effect at the singlet - triplet transition , that is , when the orbital effect of the magnetic field dominates . in the opposite case of large zeeman splitting ,",
    "the problem is reduced straightforwadly to the single - channel one , as we will see in section  [ zeeman ] below .",
    "we will demonstrate the derivation of the effective low - energy hamiltonian under the simplifying assumption @xcite,@xcite @xmath50 this assumption , on one hand , greatly simplifies the calculations , and , on the other hand , is still general enough to capture the most important physical properties @xcite .",
    "it is convenient to begin the derivation by performing a rotation@xcite in the r - l space @xmath51 after which the @xmath52 field decouples : @xmath53 the differential conductance at zero bias @xmath2 can be related , using eq .",
    "( [ rotation ] ) , to the amplitudes of scattering @xmath54 of the @xmath55particles @xmath56    the next step is to integrate out the virtual transitions to the states with @xmath57 electrons by means of the schrieffer - wolff transformation or , equivalently , by the brillouin ",
    "wigner perturbation theory .",
    "this procedure results in the effective low - energy hamiltonian in which the transitions between the states ( [ basis ] ) are described by of the operators @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the projection operator onto the system of states ( [ basis ] ) .",
    "the operators @xmath60 may be conveniently written in terms of two fictitious @xmath61-spins @xmath62 .",
    "the idea of mapping comes from the one - to - one correspondence between the set of states ( [ basis ] ) and the states of a two - spin system : @xmath63 we found the following relations : @xmath64 = \\sqrt{2}{\\bf t}.    \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in terms of @xmath65 , the effective hamiltonian takes the form : @xmath66 .",

    "however , this difference is not important , since it only affects the value of the control parameter at which the singlet - triplet transition occurs , but not the nature of the transition",
    ".    we did not include into ( [ model])-([hn ] ) the free - electron hamiltonian of the @xmath52-particles [ see eq .",
    "( [ rotation ] ) ] , as well as some other terms , that are irrelevant for the low energy renormalization .",
    "the contribution of these terms to the conductance is featureless at the energy scale of the order of @xmath38 ( see the next section ) , where the kondo resonance develops .    at this point , it is necessary to discuss some approximations tacitly made in the derivation of ( [ model])-([hn ] ) .",
    "first of all , we entirely ignored the presence of many energy levels in the dot , and took into account the low - energy multiplet ( [ basis ] ) only .",
    "the multi - level structure of the dot is important at the energies above @xmath21 , while the kondo effect physics emerges at the energy scale well below the single - particle level spacing @xcite .",
    "the high - energy states result merely in a renormalization of the parameters of the effective low - energy hamiltonian .",
    "one only needs to consider this renormalization for deriving the relation between the parameters @xmath73 and @xmath74 of the low - energy hamiltonian ( [ hdot ] ) , ( [ leads ] ) and ( [ ht ] ) and the `` bare '' constants of the model defined in a wide bandwidth @xmath75 . on the other hand , using the effective low - energy hamiltonian , one can calculate , in principle , the observable quantities such as conductance @xmath76 and other susceptibilities of the system at low temperatures ( @xmath77 ) , and establish the relations between them , which is our main goal .",
    "note that the hamiltonian ( [ model])-([hn ] ) resembles that of the two - impurity kondo model , for which @xmath78 and the parameter @xmath71 characterizes the strength of the rkky interaction @xcite .",
    "it is known that the two - impurity kondo model may undergo a phase transition at some special value of @xmath71 @xcite . at this point ,",
    "the system may exhibit non - fermi liquid properties .",
    "however , one can show @xcite , using general arguments put forward in @xcite , that the model ( [ model])-([hn ] ) does not have the symmetry that warrants the existence of the non fermi liquid state .",
    "this allows one to apply the local fermi liquid description @xcite to study the properties of the system at @xmath79 . in the next section ,",
    "we will concentrate on the experimentally relevant perturbative regime .      to calculate the differential conductance in the leading logarithmic approximation",
