    "a possible candidate responsible for this evolution is the usual vacuum energy represented by a cosmological constant , @xmath1 , providing a negative pressure @xcite .",

    "moreover , it is a special `` cosmic coincidence '' that the energy density associated with the cosmological constant has a value near to the density of other matter types exactly today .",
    "a plausible alternative is to consider a dynamical vacuum energy ( also called `` quintessence '' ) @xcite , involving one or two scalar fields , where some scenarios are associated with potentials justified from supergravity theories @xcite . nevertheless , when quintessence models confront the cosmic coincidence issue , they face fine - tuning problems and no satisfactory solution has yet been found .",

    "it is curious to mention that the chaplygin gas was originally introduced in aerodynamics @xcite .",
    "quite a few publications devoted to chaplygin gas cosmological models have already appeared in the literature @xcite .",

    "@xcite .    within",
    "the physical context herein described , the main purpose of this paper is to investigate if a quantum mechanical analysis would provide complementary information regarding frw cosmologies with a chaplygin gas content .",
    "in particular , assuming that after the universe reached a stage where dust matter was dominant , the subsequent evolution towards an exponentially expanding epoch involved a quantum mechanical transition associated with some remnant component of the original wave function of the universe . in other words , underlying the classically observed universe on large scales there is a quantum mechanical background , where the cosmological influence of a wave function vestige ( i.e. , a rapidly oscillating state with a particularly small amplitude ) would emerge during the dust dominace epoch .",

    "the reason that the physical model in ref .",

    "born - infeld cosmological solutions could assist us in the understanding of some brane - world dynamics regarding the universe evolution .",
    "the above context regarding brane - worlds can be further specified .",
    "in fact , frw models with a chaplygin gas may constitute a phenomelogical tool to study some brane - world models : another physical situation with two lorentzian sectors separated by a classically forbidden euclidean region can be found in the hamiltonian treatment of a desitter @xmath103brane imbedded in a @xmath104minkowski background @xcite .",
    "the presence of a classically disconnected epoch ( as in fig .",
    "1 for @xmath67 ) has been identified as a property of brane - world quantum cosmology @xcite .",

    ". of course the range of models herein considered is yet restricted , but it may direct to potential insights regarding a quantum mechanical description of brane - worlds together with the creation of corresponding cosmological models .",
    "as a summary , let us point the main results conveyed in this paper . our purpose was twofold .",
    "first , it was our aim to present a quantum mechanical description of a closed frw model with a positive cosmological constant and a generalized chaplygin gas .",
    "the physical scenario we are contemplating is that , underlying a classical universe , there was a wave function vestige ( i.e. , a rapidly oscillating state with a particularly small amplitude ) whose physical implications would emerge within the epoch of cosmological dust dominance . such specific remnant component of the original wave function of the universe had been present during that period of the universe evolution .",
    "it can be interpreted as a robust component ( with respect to decoherence ) in the sense introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite . in other words , after the universe reached a dust stage , the transition towards an accelerating expansion would be associated to a quantum mechanical transition for that specific wave function remnant component of the original state . in this context",
    ", we obtained the hamiltonian and the corresponding wheeler - dewitt equation associated with such transition .",
    "in particular , we established a range for the variables and parameters of the model where a linear approximation for the effective minisuperspace potential could be used .",
    "the quantum mechanical amplitudes for the transitions from a dust stage towards an expanding accelerating phase were obtained either in the form of a hartle - hawking or vilenkin wave function .",
    "we established how these transition amplitudes vary according to the allowed values for @xmath55 and @xmath9 : when either @xmath55 or @xmath232 increase , the vilenkin state ( generally , see sec .",
    "iii ) allowed the probability for the universe to tunnel towards the accelerated stage to increase , while the opposite situation occurred for the hartle - hawking wave function .",
    "subsequently , we investigated whether this quantum mechanical formulation for the transition from a dust stage towards an exponentially accelerated phase determined any physical consequences regarding the chaplygin gas cosmological scenario .",
    "we then found that the hartle - hawking and vilenkin wave functions could imply that the parameters @xmath55 and @xmath9 would be related and restricted to a quantization condition characterized by the presence of an integer @xmath0 .",
    "this result is obtained as we impose the condition @xmath169 corresponding to the presence of a divergence in the curvature .",
    "the divergence is generic , i.e. , it is not a consequence of our linear approximation .",
    "the presence of such divergence in a classically allowed region can be dealt following , e.g. , the approach suggest in ref .",
    "@xcite ( also designated as dewitt s argument ) : the divergence is not replaced by an euclidean conic - singulatity - free pole , being neutralized by making it quantum mechanically inaccessible .",
    "let us remember that , e.g. , the tunneling ( vilenkin ) boundary condition was thought of for a problem of ( semi - classical ) creation of the universe , in analogy with the tunneling process in quantum mechanics .",
    "note , however , that the singularity in our model is located in a classical region , before tunneling .",
    "we can consider waves proceeding from a classical region , with a probability to exit from it towards the other classical region ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "nevertheless , it is only a sufficient but not necessary that the wave function vanishes at the origin in order to avoid singularities . on the one hand , both the hartle - hawking and vilenkin wave functions can be taken generally as non - zero at @xmath74 ( being a minimum ( hartle - hawking ) or a green s function ( vilenkin ) ) , increasing or decreasing through the barrier . the singularity could be smoothed by means of some non - trivial measure in the inner product . on the other hand , quantum mechanical situations with singularities",
    "occur and are dealt with , as with the solution of the dirac equation for the ground state of the hydrogen atom which is singular when @xmath233 .",
    "we have , however , herein chosen to follow the approach presented in ref .",
    "@xcite to address the transition from a dust phase towards an accelerating expansion stage by means of a quantum mechanical tunneling mediating the evolution from an initial lorentzian ( classically allowed ) region to the current accelerating epoch .",
    "second , it was also our objective to introduce a discussion ( and promote subsequent research ) on the interesting similarities between the quantum cosmology of a specific brane - world models @xcite and frw quantum cosmologies with a chaplygin gas content .",
    "this was based on the feature that frw models with a chaplygin gas may constitute a phenomelogical tool to investigate brane - world models : both frameworks share a physical minisuperspace where two lorentzian sectors are separated by a classically forbidden euclidean region @xcite .",
    "this suggests a view that frw models with a generalized chaplygin gas content may enable us to investigate specific aspects within brane - worlds .",
    "e.g. , the quantum cosmological creation of the universe , by means of an hamiltonian formulation , taking into account the presence of potential symmetries and conserved charges that could be related with physical quantitites in brane - world physics @xcite .",
    "this association between frw cosmologies with a generalized chaplygin gas and some brane - world cosmologies is strengthen when considering the next order of approximation in eq .",
    "( [ cg2 ] ) and ( [ cg10 ] ) ( i.e. , going beyond the hamilton - jacobi equation ( [ cg7 ] ) ) : see eq .",
    "( [ cgn17 ] ) - ( [ cgn22 ] ) .",
    "this order of approximation was described through of a perturbative expansion in the parameter @xmath5 present in the chaplygin gas energy density .",
    "let us remind that a connection between the chaplygin gas ( @xmath7 ) and brane - world models is that the brane tension is @xmath229 @xcite . for the case of a generalized chaplygin gas the `` generalized '' tension would be @xmath230 .",
    "a subsequent quantization condition involving @xmath5 as well as @xmath55 and @xmath9 would be retrieved , depending on the boundary condition ( hartle - hawking or vilenkin ) chosen .",
    "let us now discuss the presence of the positive cosmological constant , @xmath2 , in our minisuperspace scenario .",
    "it may seem that its purpose is merely to induce the tunnelling towards a desitter classical stage , as eq .",
    "( [ cg10 ] ) suggests .",
    "nevertheless , it is worthy to point the following . if we take @xmath170 in eq .",
    "( [ cg3 ] ) and depict @xmath34 for different values of @xmath55 and with @xmath171 , we get a physical situation as described in fig .",
    "[ potenciales ] ( see fig .  [ comparison ] for a comparison ) ,    , when the cosmological constant , @xmath234 , is zero and the constant @xmath5 is very small .",
    "the physical situation described in this case is similar to the one in fig .",
    "[ potenciales ] , i.e. two classically allowed regions disconnected and a euclidean one.,width=188 ]    where the behavior of an effective cosmological constant is induced through the parameter @xmath5 . however , the analytical quantum treatment of a minisuperspace with @xmath34 in eq .",
    "( [ cg3 ] ) with generic values of @xmath235 and @xmath55 is rather complex .",
    "the minisuperspace model described within this paper with positive cosmological constant , @xmath2 , is analytically feasible , providing a similar minisuperspace dynamics through eq .",
    "( [ cg10 ] ) .",
    "the presence of @xmath234 ( pertinent for larger values of @xmath29 ) may be interpreted as the lowest order effect of the effective cosmological constant behavior induced in the generalized chaplygin gas scenario .",
    "this provides explicit analytical expressions for the transition amplitudes ( from an initial lorentzian ( classically allowed ) region to the current accelerating epoch through a tunneling process ) to be computed .",
    "improved expressions could be considered by taking next orders of approximation , beyond the hamilton - jacobi eq .",
    "( [ cg7 ] ) , as indicated in sec .",
    "v.    another issue that is important to mention is the following . in eq .",
    "( [ cg5 ] ) we have a superposition of states , that may be considered from the point of view of decoherence ( see ref .  @xcite for an extensive and thorough review ) . in generic quantum cosmology",
    ", a full wave function could take the form @xmath236 where the @xmath237 are solutions to the hamilton - jacobi equation ( treating the gravitational part ) and the states @xmath238 are matter states obeying @xmath239 , where @xmath240 is the corresponding matter hamiltonian ( see ref .",
    "such expansion for @xmath241 has some relevant non - classical features . on the one hand , it is a superposition of many wkb states .",
    "only if those different branches are dynamically independent of each other we recover a background spacetime without quantum mechanical interferences .",
    "on the other hand , restricting to a single component in @xmath241 may not yet mean a classical space - time as the wkb function may spread over all configuration space .",
    "a decoherence process is needed thus prior to identify a classical behavior .",
    "concerning our case study , we focused our attention in the transition amplitudes for the universe to proceed from a classical initial region , through a quantum mechanical tunneling sector , towards another classical region where an accelerating stage takes place .",
    "we are taking that different wkb components will decohere as discussed in @xcite and considering solely a robust component ( with respect to decoherence , in the sense introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite ) of the original wave function . this component would induce a transition from a dust dominating stage towards an accelerated epoch as described in sections i and ii",
    ". a discussion on decoherence issues in our model ( or other models where the euclidean ( classically forbidden ) region contour is generically a closed curve ) may be the subject of future research work .    finally , it may be of interest to indicate additional possible subsequent directions of research to explore .",
    "an interesting option is to investigate whether other brane - world models ( see , e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) can admit a phenomenological description in terms of a generalized chaplygin gas minisuperspace cosmology .",
    "this could be investigated by means of suitable canonical transformations at the hamiltonian formulation .",
    "another possibility is to pursue the analysis of the next orders of approximation ( beyond the hamilton - jacobi equation as in section v ) in a broader perspective @xcite .",
    "this would mean extracting the corresponding functional schrodinger equation from the wheeler - dewitt equation , together with quantum gravitational corrections to it ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for more details ) .",
    "moreover , the quantum cosmology of frw models with a generalized chaplygin gas could be investigated from the following perspective : taking into account the chaplygin gas influence not as as additional term in the superpotential depending on @xmath29 , but as a couple of independent conjugate dynamical variables , which would imply a modification of the wheeler - dewitt equation .",
    "the guidelines of ref .",
    "@xcite could be of importance towards such hamiltonian formulation .",
    "this will bring changes as the dimension of the configuration space will increase and the hyperbolic nature of the kinetic term has to be considered .",
    "let us write @xmath60 as @xmath243 with @xmath244 where @xmath245 , @xmath246 , @xmath247 . using ref .",
    "@xcite , we define @xmath248 and then obtain for the case @xmath249 , i.e. , @xmath250 , the following roots for @xmath78 : @xmath251 in the last expression @xmath252 and @xmath253 . moreover , we have that @xmath254 , together with @xmath255 therefore , @xmath60 has three real roots determining two lorentzian regions and one classically forbidden region for the range of @xmath256 .",
