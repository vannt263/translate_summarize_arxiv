    "density functional theory ( dft ) was developed to characterize quantum systems in an external potential @xcite and since the 1970 s has been fruitfully brought to bear on classical fluids @xcite . indeed , here too it serves as an excellent tool to study the microscopic structure of fluids under the influence of external potentials , such as confining walls , and can serve as the sole prerequisite to map out complete phase diagrams that encompass various fluid and crystalline structures . moreover , besides yielding a sound theoretical understanding of findings from colloidal physics and computer simulations , dft calculations can be extremely efficient computationally , especially if the systems under consideration allow for dimensional reduction , and hence in consequence largely outperform monte carlo ( mc ) simulations .",
    "in particular , dft is especially convenient when phase diagrams or solvation free energies are calculated because it makes direct use of the grand potential @xmath1 .",
    "the basic formalism of dft expresses @xmath1 as a functional of the density profiles @xmath2 of the different fluid components @xmath3 as @xmath4   = \\mathcal{f}_{\\text{id}}[\\{\\rho_i({{\\bf\\stringr } } ) \\ } ] + \\mathcal{f}_{\\text{ex}}[\\{\\rho_i({{\\bf\\stringr } } ) \\ } ]   + \\sum_{i=1}^{\\nu } \\int { \\mathrm{d}}{{\\bf\\stringr } } \\rho_i({{\\bf\\stringr } } ) [ v_i^{\\text{ext}}({{\\bf\\stringr } } ) - \\mu_i ] \\",

    "the ideal gas part of the free energy is @xmath8 = \\sum_{i=1}^{\\nu } \\int { \\mathrm{d}}{{\\bf\\stringr } } \\rho_i({{\\bf\\stringr } } ) ( \\ln [ \\lambda_i^3\\rho_i({{\\bf\\stringr } } ) ] - 1 ) \\",
    ", , \\ ] ] where @xmath9 is the thermal wavelength of species @xmath6 and @xmath10 .",
    "the excess part of the free energy @xmath11 $ ] depends on the interactions between the particles and on temperature . for the given external potentials ,",
    "the equilibrium density profiles are obtained by solving the system of coupled equations @xmath12 ,",
    "@xmath3 .",
    "the above formalism is exact subject to the limitations of knowledge regarding @xmath13 for which we have only approximate descriptions for 3d fluids with non - trivial interactions . among these approximations ,",
    "rosenfeld s fundamental measure theory ( fmt ) for the hard - sphere ( hs ) fluid @xcite provides an excellent framework that uses only exact results for certain limiting cases which are generalized using dimensional analysis of a set of weighted densities .",
    "the theory applies equally to mixtures and , in part thanks to subsequent incorporations of highly accurate equations of state @xcite , compares extremely well with computer simulations .",
    "the theory can be extended to treat crystallization of the hs fluid @xcite as well as the isotropic - nematic transition of non - spherical hard particles @xcite .",
    "all of these developments make fmt a central and powerful tool for the study of entropy - governed hard - body fluids .",
    "hard - body systems are an important test bed for theories which make use of a weeks - chandler - andersen @xcite type decomposition of the interaction potential into a repulsive core and an attractive long - ranged tail .",
    "moreover , they can often be considered as an accurate approximation to an entropy - dominated system .",
    "however , indeed many realistic fluids that occur in biological applications or colloidal science invariably exhibit attractive particle - particle interactions in addition to the hard - core repulsion . a simple model fluid with an attractive potential that has been extensively studied by theorists @xcite is the square - well ( sw ) fluid defined by an interaction potential @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the particle hard - core diameter , @xmath16 is the range of the attraction and @xmath17 is the well depth .",
    "the radial distribution function ( rdf ) @xmath18 and the direct correlation function ( dcf ) @xmath19 are related through the ornstein - zernike ( oz ) integral equation @xcite @xmath20 however , the oz equation can only be solved numerically within the percus - yevick ( py ) closure for the potential @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "alternatively , @xmath18 can be determined in computer simulations @xcite from which @xmath19 and thermodynamic properties of the sw fluid can be derived . however ,",
    "these results cover only a limited selection of specific parameter choices for the model simulations and the results are clearly not in a convenient form for analysis .",
    "hence , it is reasonable to seek a model with attractive interactions that would be solvable within the usual closure relations for the oz equation . in the limiting case of surface adhesion where @xmath22 baxter s so - called sticky limit , with @xmath23 characterizing the strength of the attraction , allows the oz equation to be solved within the py closure @xcite .",
    "the results are convenient in a closed analytical form and compare well with computer simulations for various attraction strengths @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "essential features of the sticky hard sphere ( shs ) fluid , such as the existence of a critical point associated with a liquid - gas transition , are captured by the py results @xcite .",
    "subsequently , the model has been generalized for shs mixtures where the py closure leads to a set of coupled quadratic equations that can be solved analytically only in special cases @xcite .",
    "far from being just a somewhat artificial theoretical construct , the shs fluid has been demonstrated to provide an accurate description of colloidal systems with very short ranged attractions @xcite and has been applied successfully to phenomena such as structural arrest in a micellar system @xcite , competitive protein adsorption @xcite , and even skim milk acidification @xcite .",
    "that said , the use of the shs fluid to model experimental systems has been aimed at mapping out phase diagrams and calculating equations of state while the inhomogeneous fluid has been studied less thoroughly .",
    "firstly , this has to do with the difficulty of measuring structural properties such as density profiles and higher order correlation functions .",
    "secondly , we lack a reliable tool to compute these quantities based on the analytical py results . existing dfts for baxter s shs fluid are all based on an expansion of the one - particle dcf in powers of the deviation of the density profile from the bulk density .",
    "this expansion can only be performed systematically to linear order where it involves the dcf for which the py results can be used @xcite .",
    "moreover , the quality of the resulting dft is rather poor , especially close to contact with a hard wall @xcite .",
    "expanding the one - particle dcf to quadratic order requires a formula for the unknown three - particle dcf @xmath24 of the shs fluid .",
    "the functional form of @xmath24 has been estimated by different authors based on assumptions regarding its range @xcite or its factorization in terms of @xmath19 @xcite . in order to yield reasonable agreement with computer simulations all these extensions of the dft by choudhury and ghosh",
    "@xcite require an additional , density dependent , fitting parameter which is chosen such that the correct contact value of the density profile or the correct bulk pressure is guaranteed .    here",
    "we develop a dft for the shs fluid that is distinct from the above perturbative approaches . in the spirit of fmt we use a set of weighted densities that can be identified from a systematic inspection of the hs fluid in the low density limit . in order to construct a functional which yields the py dcf for the shs fluid",
    ", we supplement this with an exact relation from scaled particle theory ( spt ) @xcite .",
    "the main result is a unique construction for a broad class of closure schemes of which the py closure is but one .",

    "depending on the choice of the function @xmath29 , when applied to the shs fluid the gpy reduces to different familiar closure relations such as the mean spherical approximation ( msa ) , the modified mean spherical approximation ( mmsa ) , and the py closure @xcite .",

    "gazzillo and giacometti @xcite showed that in baxter s sticky limit the gpy approximation allows for a general analytical solution of the oz equation where the underlying closure relation enters solely through its approximation to the cavity function @xmath35 at contact .",

    "the py result for @xmath35 [ eq .  ] is exact up to linear order in @xmath40 , with a small deviation occurring at quadratic and higher orders .",
    "it turns out that the msa leads to @xmath41 and hence does not capture the effect of surface adhesion in the shs fluid and thus the results coincide with those for the hs fluid .",
    "the mmsa has @xmath42 which is the exact result in the low density limit ; @xmath43 .",
    "gazzillo and giacometti @xcite also introduce a c1 approximation wherein @xmath44 , and hence it corresponds to the exact expression for @xmath35 truncated after the linear term in @xmath40 .",
    "presently , fmt provides the most accurate free energy model for inhomogeneous hs fluids .",
    "additionally , fmt gives an excellent description of hs mixtures @xcite as well as fluids containing non - spherical hard particles @xcite .",
    "the theory originated with rosenfeld s seminal paper @xcite and has been continuously modified by improving the underlying equation of state @xcite and the ability to capture the formation of hs crystals @xcite .",
    "there is an equivalent fmt formulation due to kierlik and rosinberg @xcite , which , in the case of the shs fluid proves to be more useful than rosenfeld s fmt ( cf .",
    "[ sec_conclusion ] ) . in order to make",
    "this development reasonably self - contained , we summarize kr s version of fmt here .",
    "fundamental measure theory provides an expression for the excess free energy @xmath13 which can be used in the framework of classical dft to obtain the structural properties ( density profiles and correlation functions ) of fluids that are subject to external potentials , i.e. , inhomogeneous fluids .",
    "as discussed above , we consider a fluid with @xmath45 different components which have the corresponding density profiles @xmath2 , @xmath46 .",
    "the fmt approach is based on weighted densities @xmath47 written as @xmath48 in terms of the weight functions @xmath49 of which there are four in kr s approach corresponding to four @xmath50 .",

    "the fmt excess free energy density @xmath55 obeys the spt differential equation @xmath57 which insures that the reversible work of adding a sphere to the fluid , in the limit of infinite sphere size , equals the volume of the sphere multiplied by the pressure of the bulk fluid @xcite .",
    "while this exact relation must hold for spheres with surface adhesion , there is no straightforward generalization of the principle for fluids with a finite range of interaction ( in addition to the hard body repulsion ) such as in the case of a sw fluid . for these fluids the question arises as to how the range of the interaction should scale as the size of the added sphere goes to infinity .",
    "however , for the shs fluid the surface attraction is subdominant with respect to the sphere volume in the large sphere limit .",

    "we have constructed a dft for the shs fluid which , in the spirit of rosenfeld s fmt for the hs fluid @xcite , is based on a set of weighted densities which can be identified from a careful inspection of the dilute hs fluid .",
    "the main finding of this work is that using the fmt set of weighted densities ( from the version of kierlik and rosinberg @xcite ) , in combination with an exact relation from spt @xcite , a density functional can be constructed which yields the py dcf @xcite or the dcf resulting from any other closure of the broader gpy class @xcite .",
    "the construction is uniquely determined by the set of weighted densities [ eq .   with eqs .    ] the spt differential equation [ eq .  ] and the given closure from the gpy class .",
    "we tested the performance of the new fmt functional for the shs fluid by comparison with simulation data for the rdf and for density profiles of the confined fluid between two planar walls .",
    "the agreement is very good with the most significant improvement over previous theories such as the singlet py results @xcite or the dft by choudhury and ghosh @xcite occurring in the density profiles close to contact with the wall .",
    "this reflects the property that the fmt complies with the contact theorem @xcite , while other dfts need an adjustable parameter to obtain the correct contact value @xcite .",
    "the results for the solvation force between two planar plates are also significantly better than the ones obtained with previous theories @xcite .    besides the obvious advantage of providing a very accurate description of the structure of the inhomogeneous shs fluid , the existence of an fmt formulation for the shs fluid has several important implications for future developments .",
    "one aspect is the extension of the theory to shs mixtures .",
    "given that fmt provides a simple and accurate theory for hs mixtures , this new functional provides a starting point for the study of shs mixtures .",
    "in particular , the weighted densities are the key to the simplicity of the hs mixture fmt . however , unlike this situation , the new functional depends on the particle radius @xmath58 and the baxter parameter @xmath59 .",
    "hence , a straightforward generalization of the functional with the help of weighted densities becomes impossible for mixtures in which @xmath58 or @xmath59 or both @xmath58 and @xmath59 are different .",
    "a future challenge resides in seeking an appropriate set of weighted densities for the shs fluid which shifts the @xmath58 and @xmath59 dependence from the functional to the weighted densities , thereby opening the door for broad applicability to shs mixtures .",
    "the complexion of such a set might be explored through incremental extension to simple binary mixtures some of which allow for an analytical solution within the py closure @xcite .",
    "ultimately , one might be able to treat non - spherical sticky particles as was the case for hard particles @xcite .",
    "an additional future development includes extending the present dft formulation to fluids with an attraction that has non - vanishing range such as the square - well fluid .",
    "given that the py closure can not be solved analytically for these systems , it seems most likely that a successful road to an fmt would include the creation of new weighted densities which average the density profiles over a region that corresponds to the range of the attractive potential . in this context",
    ", studies of sw fluids with a very short but finite range of attraction @xcite might provide a good starting point .    finally , there is the question whether the present fmt is suited for the study of shs crystals .",
    "problems such as spurious divergences for peaked density distributions for hs systems lead us to believe that the shs fmt in its present form can not properly describe a shs crystal . however , these shortcomings have been successfully cured using different approaches @xcite within rosenfeld s formulation of fmt @xcite . nonetheless , these approaches have not yet been translated to the kr framework @xcite which constitutes the basis of the shs fmt .",
    "the alternative approach of formulating the present shs fmt using rosenfeld s set of weighted densities appears to be challenging .",
    "this follows from the observation that the @xmath125 function in the dcf [ eq .",
    "] can only be generated using kr s weighted density @xmath63 .",
    "if the vectorial @xmath126 in rosenfeld s fmt , supplemented by @xmath127 and @xmath128 , was used to construct @xmath68 the dcf in fourier space would acquire a term proportional to @xmath129 [ see ref .   for the definition of @xmath130 .",
    "such a formulation is unable to yield the term proportional to @xmath131 originating from the @xmath125-function in the dcf .",
    "this term can only be matched if the product @xmath132 , with kr s @xmath133 from eq .",
    ", is used .",
    "therefore , the extension of fmt to the shs fluid provides an example where the equivalence of the kr and rosenfeld formulations is no longer valid .",
    "this is an interesting and unexpected finding that illustrates the advantage of one formulation over the other depending on the task at hand .",
