    "in qcd the fermion determinant is complex for chemical potential , @xmath1 non - zero , therefore generating an ensemble at @xmath2 is impracticable . the fermion number density , @xmath3 , measures the excess of quarks relative to anti - quarks and is expected to start to rise from zero at some value , @xmath4 .",
    "the _ onset _ , @xmath4 corresponds to the point where the phase of nuclear matter is more energetically favourable than the vacuum state ( for which @xmath5 ) .",
    "chiral symmetry restoration occurs at @xmath6 and we expect @xcite that @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the proton mass .",
    "quenched simulations , on the other hand , predict @xmath9 suggesting that in the limit where the bare quark mass , @xmath10 chiral symmetry is restored for any @xmath11 .",
    "this result is unphysical because the pion should not couple to the baryon chemical potential .",
    "first attempts to simulate full qcd using the glasgow method @xcite also produced perplexing results @xcite . on an @xmath12 lattice with bare quark mass @xmath13 at @xmath14 we found @xmath15 which differs considerably from the strong coupling analysis @xcite prediction @xmath16 for @xmath17 .",
    "furthermore the scaling of @xmath4 with @xmath18 was consistent with a goldstone boson controlling the onset .",
    "this result has motivated an assessment of the effectiveness of the glasgow method via its implementation in a simpler model .",
    "the method involves expansion of the grand canonical partition function ( gcpf ) as a polynomial in the fugacity variable ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "consider the conventional expression for the gcpf in lattice qcd @xmath20\\,\\det\\left(m(u,\\mu_{meas},m_q)\\right)\\,e^{-s_g(u)}\\ ] ] the gcpf ( for fixed @xmath18 ) can be rescaled and expressed as an ensemble average of @xmath21 at @xmath22 : @xmath23 \\ ,   { { \\det m(\\mu_{meas})}\\over{\\det m(\\mu_{upd}=0 ) } }   \\det m(\\mu_{upd}=0)\\,e^{-s_g[u ] } } \\over   { \\int { [ du]\\,\\det { m(\\mu_{upd}=0)\\,e^{-s_g[u ] } } } } } \\nonumber   = \\left < { { \\det m(\\mu_{meas } ) } \\over { \\det m(\\mu_{upd}=0 ) } }   \\right > { \\biggr\\vert}_{\\mu_{upd}=0 }   \\label{eqn : reweight}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 is the chemical potential at which the statistical ensemble is updated and is distinct from @xmath25 which appears in the functional measure for the exact hybrid monte carlo ( hmc ) simulations and in @xmath26 below .",
    "note that generating the ensemble at @xmath27 allows us to circumvent the problem of the complex action in the hmc algorithm . for optimum efficiency of the glasgow method",
    "we require a large overlap between the ensemble generated using @xmath28 and the exact ensemble generated using @xmath29 .",
    "let us define a reweighting factor @xmath30 .",
    "the relative magnitude of the factor @xmath26 configuration by configuration gives a measure of the overlap .",
    "if there is poor overlap between the simulated ensemble and the true ensemble it is conceivable that only a small fraction of the configurations will contribute significantly to @xmath31 ( those where @xmath26 is large in magnitude ) in which case very high statistics would be required to extract realistic observables .",
    "the relevant features of the 3d gross - neveu ( gn ) model for @xmath32 studies are that it has a chiral transition with a massless pion in the broken phase and it can be formulated such that the fermion determinant is positive definite for @xmath2 .    mirroring the glasgow reweighting technique implemented in full qcd ( @xmath2 )",
    "simulations we performed an expansion of the grand canonical partition function ( gcpf ) for the 3d gn action in the fugacity variable @xmath33 .    the full lattice action for the bosonized gn model with u(1 )",
    "chiral symmetry is given in @xcite .",
    "the functional measure used in the hmc algorithm is @xmath34 .",
    "the dirac fermion matrices , @xmath35 and @xmath36 , can be conveniently expressed in terms of matrices @xmath37 and @xmath38 where @xmath37 contains all the spacelike links while @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) contains the forward(backward ) timelike links @xmath40 and the term describing the yukawa couplings of scalars to fermions is given ( in terms of the auxiliary fields @xmath41 and @xmath42 on dual lattice sites @xmath43 ) by @xmath44 the determinants of these fermion matrices are related to that of the propagator matrix p ( following gibbs @xcite ) : @xmath45 by @xmath46 since @xmath21 has been expressed in terms of the determinant of a matrix which is diagonal in @xmath47 we can expand @xmath21 as a polynomial in @xmath48 .",
    "we can measure the averaged characteristic polynomial over the ensemble generated at @xmath22 and provided that the coefficients are sufficiently well determined , we can use this to provide an analytic continuation to any non - zero @xmath1 . consider a lattice with @xmath49 spatial and @xmath50 temporal dimensions .",
    "determination of the eigenvalues of @xmath51 allows us to construct the complete fugacity expansion for the gcpf : @xmath52      the simulated 3d gn @xmath0 model has a positive definite functional measure so we can choose @xmath55 to investigate the influence of this choice on the observables .",
    "exact hybrid monte carlo ( hmc ) simulations @xcite showed a clear separation of the scales @xmath56 and @xmath6 indicating that the existence of a goldstone mode in the spectrum of a theory need not precipitate chiral symmetry restoration for @xmath57 in qcd .",
    "we will compare exact hmc and glasgow method simulations on a @xmath59 lattice at a four - fermi coupling of @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "we simulated the @xmath62 ( n=3 staggered ) model .",
    "in the exact simulations for this parameter set there was a clear discontinuity ( at @xmath63 ) in fermion number density as a function of the chemical potential .",
    "there was no evidence of an onset in the number density at @xmath64 .",
    "in fact @xmath65 for the exact hmc simulation .",
    "it is clear that the chemical potential @xmath24 at which the statistical ensemble is generated has a strong influence on the thermodynamic observables of the simulation .",
    "[ fig : all_updates ] shows the number density for the exact hmc simulation ( discussed above ) and for three simulations with the glasgow method : one for @xmath66 another for @xmath67 and finally with @xmath68 the discontinuity at @xmath6 associated with the fermion losing dynamical mass , which is clearly evident in the exact hmc data is not consistently reproduced by the glasgow algorithm .",
    "in fact the chiral transition is seen only when @xmath69 . for @xmath70 ,",
    "@xmath3 reflects only the chirally symmetric phase ( where @xmath71 ) of the exact hmc data while for @xmath27 , @xmath3 reflects only the phase of broken chiral symmetry ( where @xmath72 ) .",
    "this suggests that there is insufficient overlap .",
    "the lee - yang zeros @xcite in the complex @xmath1 plane are the zeros of eqn .",
    "[ eqn : gcpf ] and their distribution should reflect @xmath6 .",
    "we expect the zero with the smallest imaginary part to approach the real axis as the lattice volume is increased .",
    "a phase transition occurs whenever a root approaches the real axis in the infinite volume limit .",
    "the zeros for the @xmath73 are plotted in fig.[fig : zeros_0.0_0.7 ] . for @xmath27 notice the two zeros emerging from the body of the distribution .",
    "these two isolated zeros are located at a chemical potential @xmath74 .",
    "there was no evidence for @xmath6 in @xmath3 for @xmath27 so it is more likely these two zeros are associated with @xmath4 rather than @xmath6 .",
    "for @xmath75 we * did * see a discontinuity in @xmath3 at @xmath6 and in this case we see an arc of zeros forming which intersects the real @xmath1-axis at @xmath74 .",
    "the pion susceptibility eqn.([eqn : ward ] ) consists of a connected channel and a disconnected channel .",
    "in qcd the pion has a * dominant connected contribution * therefore we can identify the pion mass in qcd with a pole in the pseudoscalar propagator , @xmath78 , defined by ( with @xmath79 ) : @xmath80    gibbs @xcite derived a relation between the eigenvalues of @xmath81 and @xmath82 in qcd . if @xmath83 is an eigenvalue of p associated with the mass pole in @xmath78 and assuming the pion susceptibility has a dominant connected contribution it follows that @xmath84",
    "let us consider how the existence of this mass pole could affect @xmath85 .",
    "notice that @xmath21 can be simply expressed in terms of the eigenvalues of @xmath81 and @xmath31 can be similarly expressed in terms of its zeros @xmath86 in the @xmath48 plane : @xmath87      the number density on a single configuration @xmath91 whereas the ensemble average is given by @xmath92 .",
    "presumably the unphysical singularity at @xmath93 in @xmath3 associated with the pole in @xmath78 at @xmath56 could disappear if we achieved the @xmath86 appropriate to the correct statistical ensemble and we envisage that @xmath4 would cancel in the large ensemble limit .",
    "the mass pole at @xmath94 should disappear if we have a confining theory .",
    "it will be shown that in the 3d gn @xmath0 model the goldstone pole forms in the disconnected channel therefore the state described by @xmath78 no longer corresponds to the goldstone pion .",
    "instead we find : @xmath95 since @xmath96 will now correspond to the dynamical fermion mass @xmath97 rather than @xmath94 we have no reason to expect an early onset associated with the goldstone pole in the 3d gn @xmath0 model .",
    "[ fig : mu0discon_pisq ] shows the disconnected contribution to the ward identity for a simulation at zero chemical potential . for this simulation we found @xmath98 ,",
    "therefore we require that the sum of the connected and disconnected diagrams be of similar order so that eqn .",
    "[ eqn : ward ] is satisfied .",
    "the connected contribution was stable at a value of around 0.5 therefore the dominant contribution must come from the disconnected diagram .",
    "we found that the disconnected contribution was very noisy with large downward peaks .",
    "the data suggests that considering the connected contribution alone will never be sufficient to satisfy eqn .",
    "[ eqn : ward ] .",
    "we repeated our measurements for a non - zero chemical potential .",
    "we chose @xmath99 thus ensuring that we were still in the phase of broken chiral symmetry .",
    "the results were consistent with those at zero chemical potential as one would expect .",
    "the disconnected contribution to the pion susceptibility gives a very noisy signal which suggests that a very long run would be required to equilibrate sufficiently to satisfy the lattice ward identity .",
    "in qcd the pseudoscalar channel pole is formed from * connected * diagrams corresponding to @xmath101 .",
    "a * baryonic pion * forms from a quark and a conjugate quark and condenses in this channel which explains why we find @xmath102 @xcite .",
    "this induces the unphysical early onset of chiral symmetry restoration in the quenched theory and will persist in the glasgow algorithm unless either large statistics or sufficient overlap is achieved so that the phase of the determinant eliminates the conjugate quarks .    in 3d gn",
    "@xmath0 the goldstone mechanism is realised by a pseudoscalar channel pole formed from * disconnected * diagrams and the state @xmath101 yields a bound state of mass @xmath103 which is considerably heavier than the pion . even on individual configurations in this model",
    "we expect @xmath104 because no baryonic pion condenses in the connected channel",
