    "the sliding contact between non - conforming elastic bodies is a classical problem in contact mechanics ( @xcite ) .",
    "knowledge of the surface and subsurface stress field in such systems is central to solid friction , seismology , biomechanics or mechanical engineering .",
    "typical applications include hard disk drives ( e.g. @xcite ) , tribological coatings ( e.g. @xcite ) , train wheels on rails ( e.g. @xcite ) , human joints ( e.g. @xcite ) and tactile perception ( e.g. @xcite ) .    theoretically , calculations of the contact stress field in the quasi - static steady sliding regime have been performed for both homogeneous ( @xcite ) and layered elastic half - spaces ( @xcite ) , for cylindrical ( @xcite ) , circular ( @xcite ) or elliptical ( @xcite ) contacts .",
    "these calculations assume a locally valid amontons friction law , stating that everywhere within the sliding contact region , the interfacial tangential stress @xmath2 with @xmath3 being the interfacial normal stress and @xmath0 the dynamic friction coefficient . up to now , no quantitative comparison between such calculations and experimental stress fields has been performed .",
    "the present work first aims at at filling this lack , by taking advantage of a recently proposed experimental method ( @xcite ) , which allows for direct measurements of the stress field at the rigid base of a frictional elastomer film .",
    "for such a layered system , no exact stress calculation in a steady sliding contact has been provided up to now neither .",
    "all previous works indeed rely on the classical goodman s assumption which states that the normal displacements at the interface due to tangential stress are negligible ( @xcite ) .",
    "this implies in particular that the interfacial pressure field is unaltered when a macroscopic tangential load is applied . for a contact between elastic half - spaces ,",
    "such a normal / tangential decoupling occurs only if ( i ) both materials are identical , ( ii ) both are incompressible or ( iii ) one of both is perfectly rigid while the other is incompressible ( @xcite ) . for layered systems ,",
    "goodman s assumption is never strictly true .",
    "however , it is expected to be increasingly valid ( i ) the higher the poisson s ratio ( @xcite ) , ( ii ) the lower the ratio of the contact size @xmath4 over the film thickness @xmath5 or ( iii ) the lower the friction coefficient .",
    "rigorously , one has to keep in mind that goodman s assumption does not have any physical ground since it does not impose the continuity of the normal displacements between the two solids in contact .",
    "the present work presents an exact stress analysis which , for a single linear elastic incompressible layer ( film ) under plane strain conditions , goes beyond the classical description by relaxing goodman s assumption .    in section [ set - up ]",

    "the resulting ( small ) deformations of the membrane are measured via four couples of piezo - resistive gauges embedded in it and forming a wheatstone bridge ( see inset of fig .",

    "the mems thus allows to measure simultaneously the applied stress along three orthogonal directions , averaged over the mems s millimetric extension , in a way that will be determined through calibration .    in the present experiments ,",
    "the mems sensor is located at the rigid base of a rough , nominally flat elastomer film of uniform thickness @xmath5=2 mm ( @xmath15 times larger than the post s diameter ) and lateral dimensions 50@xmath650 mm .",
    "the elastomer is a cross - linked poly(dimethylsiloxane ) ( pdms , sylgard 184 , dow corning ) of young s modulus @xmath16=2.2@xmath120.1mpa and poisson s ratio @xmath17=0.5 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the ratio of its loss over storage moduli , measured in a parallel plate rheometer , remains lower than @xmath18 for frequencies smaller than 1khz ( @xcite ) . in this range",
    "the pdms elastomer can thus be considered as purely elastic .",
    "the film is obtained by pouring the cross - linker / pdms liquid mix directly on the sensitive part of the mems ( cylindrical post and membrane ) so that the resulting elastic film is in intimate contact with the mems sensitive part . the parallelepipedic mold used in this process",
    "is topped with a poly(methylmethacrylate ) plate roughened by abrasion with an aqueous solution of silicon carbide powder ( mean diameter of the grains 37@xmath14 m ) .",
    "after curing at room temperature for at least 48 hours and demolding , the resulting @xmath19 surface roughness is measured with an interferential optical profilometer ( m3d , fogale nanotech ) to be 1.82@xmath120.10@xmath14 m .",
    "this roughness is sufficient to avoid any measurable pull - off force against smooth glass indentors , as discussed in @xcite .",

    "are constructed point by point .",
    "these profiles are then compared to the results of finite elements calculations ( software castem 2007 ) for the stress @xmath9 and @xmath10 at the base of a smooth axi - symmetrical elastic film ( with the same elastic moduli and thickness as in the experiment ) perfectly adhering to its rigid base and submitted to a prescribed normal displacement over a central circular area of diameter 500@xmath14 m . for frictionless conditions",
    ", these numerical results could have been obtained semi - analytically by using the model developed in @xcite but finite elements calculations have been preferred because they allowed for variable boundary conditions .",
    "as expected for contact regions of dimensions smaller than the film thickness , the stress calculated at the base of the film are found to be insensitive to the frictional boundary conditions .",
    "the vertical dimensions of the mems being smaller than the thickness of the elastomer film , one can ignore the stress field modifications induced by the mems 3d structure and consider that the base of the film is a plane .",

    "[ convolalphaz ] implicitly assume decoupling between the mems outputs .",
    "this has been checked to be true for the bare sensor by submitting it to either a uniform pressure or a pure tangential load applied directly on the silicon cylindrical post . when the mems is embedded in the elastomer film , this remains true for the normal output , as checked by applying a uniform pressure at the surface of the film .",
    "the analogous check for the tangential output is not possible because any tangential stress applied on the film surface results in tangential stress as well as normal stress gradients at its base , which can not be measured separately since they induce the same deformation mode of the mems silicon membrane .",
    "one can still use eqs .",
    "[ convolalphaz ] in the limit of contact configurations involving small pressure gradients .",

    "the two calculations predict profiles in reasonable agreement with the experimental ones .",
    "in particular , they account for both the negative part of @xmath51 and the dip of @xmath52 at negative @xmath20 . in order to quantify the deviations between the experimental and calculated profiles ,",
    "we compute the quantity @xmath142 , where @xmath143 are the experimental data points and @xmath144 are the calculated ones .",

    "@xmath145 increases with the load , between 12 and 28@xmath1 , indicating a decreasingly good fit to the experimental data with increasing @xmath7 .",
    "the exact model is therefore the one that follows most closely the evolution of the experimental profiles with increasing normal load ( fig .",
    "[ compa ] ) , which is consistent with the fact that goodman s assumption is expected to fail as the ratio of contact size @xmath4 to film thickness @xmath5 becomes large .",
    "although the exact model accounts for the data better , non - negligible robust deviations are observed for which we do not have any definitive explanation .",
    "two central assumptions used in both models are however amenable to refinement and may explain the observed deviations . first , the interface is assumed to be molecularly smooth whereas the surface of the elastomer exhibits a micrometric roughness .",
    "the resulting multicontact interface is thus expected to exhibit finite compressive and shear compliances .",
    "this feature has been shown to modify , with respect to smooth contacts , both the stress ( @xcite ) and displacement ( @xcite ) fields .",
    "these effects are expected to induce vanishing corrections at increasingly high loads .",
    "the second questionable assumption is the existence of a single pressure - independent friction coefficient .",
    "this is clearly at odds with the observed decrease of @xmath146 as a function of @xmath7 .",
    "such a behavior is usually attributed to the finite adhesion energy of the interface ( e.g. @xcite ) , and is sensitive to the geometrical properties of the film roughness .",
    "this work provides the first spatially resolved direct measurement of the stress field at a sliding contact .",
    "the choice of a cylinder - on - plane geometry has allowed us to quantitatively compare the profiles measured at the center line of the contact with bidimensional calculations .",
    "an exact model was developed to predict the stress field at the sliding contact assuming linear elasticity and a locally valid amontons friction law , but without the classical goodman s assumption on the normal displacements .",
    "this model correctly captures the measured stress profiles with typical deviations of less than 14@xmath1 . in the range of loads explored experimentally ,",
    "this calculation does not differ drastically from the classical calculation involving goodman s assumption .",
    "however , the present model is expected to provide significant improvements over goodman s model as the thickness of the film is further reduced or as the load is further increased . in these cases , goodman s assumption becomes increasingly inaccurate .",
    "robust deviations between the experiments and the model have been briefly discussed along two lines , namely the finite compliance of the multicontact interface and the pressure - dependence of the friction coefficient .",
    "however , the cylinder - on - plane experiment described here , which was specifically designed to allow for a comparison with bidimensional models , is not best suited to study such fine effects . as discussed",
    ", the resulting edge effects do not allow one to use well - controlled or measured macroscopic quantities , e.g. @xmath7 and @xmath11 , as input parameters in the models .",
    "this could be done for instance with a sphere - on - plane geometry , but it would require for comparison a more complex 3d stress analysis .",
