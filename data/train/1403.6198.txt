    "knowledge of the physical properties  such as stellar masses , star - formation rates ( sfrs ) , and stellar population ages  of galaxies is indispensable for understanding the evolution and formation of galaxies .",
    "thanks to the last decade s boom in the panchromatic observation of remote galaxies , which has benefited from the development of powerful facilities , including the @xmath3 @xmath4 @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) , a great advance has been made in the study of high - redshift galaxies as well as in our understanding of galaxy evolution . this advance in multi - wavelength studies of high - redshift galaxies",
    "is expected to accelerate in near future with the arrival of powerful space telescopes , such as @xmath7 @xmath8 @xmath4 @xmath5 , as well as large ground facilities , including the giant magellan telescope and the thirty meter telescope .    however , constraining the star - formation histories ( sfhs ) of galaxies from observation is not an easy task , even with these panchromatic data over a wide wavelength range .",
    "the difficulty comes from several factors : for example , the degenerate effects between sfhs and other properties of galaxies  such as dust extinction , metallicity , and redshift  on the overall spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of galaxies , and the fact that the observed seds can be easily dominated by the light from massive , young stars , readily concealing the old stellar populations .    one way to derive physical inferences from the multi - band photometry is to compare the distribution of galaxy colors and magnitudes to the predictions of theoretical models of galaxy formation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "another way is to derive physical parameters , such as stellar masses , sfrs , metallicities , and constraints on sfhs , by fitting the sed of each individual galaxy .",
    "this method is very useful in studying galaxies physical parameters or stellar population properties of unresolved galaxies , and has been used in analyzing various galaxy populations over a wide redshift range ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "? * just to name a few ) .    in this sed - fitting analysis",
    ", we should inevitably make assumptions on several properties of galaxies  including their stellar initial mass function ( imf ) , chemical composition and its evolution , dust - attenuation law , and sfhs of galaxies .",
    "the assumption on each of these properties can affect the sed - fitting results , and has been studied by several authors  for example , the effects of imf are studied by @xcite and @xcite , the effects of stellar evolution model are investigated by @xcite , and the effects of metallicity evolution are studied by @xcite .",
    "detailed review on this issue can be found in @xcite    among these assumptions , the effects of assumed ( forms of ) sfhs have been studied by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter l10 ) . in l10 , comparing with the results from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter l09 ) , we have extensively analyzed the effects of assumed sfhs on the sed - fitting results of @xmath9 lyman - break galaxies ( lbgs ) by analyzing mock lbgs from semi - analytic models ( sams ) of galaxy formation .",
    "this analysis has revealed that the assumptions about sfhs can significantly bias the inferences about stellar - population parameters : particularly ages and sfrs .",
    "also , the results of l09 and l10  combined with the prediction from sams of galaxy formation ( represented in l10 )  suggest that the sfhs of star - forming galaxies at this redshift range ( @xmath9 ) increase with time  in contrast to the assumption of declining sfhs as done in some previous works .    for observed galaxies , @xcite",
    "show that the seds of @xmath10 ( @xmath11-selected ) star - forming galaxies are fitted better with the exponentially increasing sfhs rather than exponentially decreasing sfhs .",
    "@xcite have analyzed the evolution of average sfrs of high - redshift galaxies , by studying the high - redshift galaxy samples with constant comoving number density , n=@xmath12 mpc@xmath13 , from @xmath14 to @xmath15 . by following the galaxy samples with same comoving number density , they can study the evolution of sfrs and stellar masses of galaxies , which may be connected as the predecessors and their descendants . from this study",
    ", they show that the average sfr of high - redshift galaxies increases as a power law with decreasing redshift ( with best - fit power @xmath16 ) .    motivated by the evidence favouring increasing sfhs , we analyze the seds of @xmath1 lbgs observed in the southern field of the great observatories origins deep survey ( goods - s ) .",
    "specifically , we focus on the sfhs of these observed galaxies , and examine if assuming the increasing sfhs would be more appropriate , providing better constraints on the stellar population properties of the observed high - redshift galaxies than assuming the declining sfhs in sed - fitting analysis .",
    "the relatively tight correlation between stellar masses and sfrs for star - forming galaxies at redshifts up to @xmath10 has come to be known as the star - forming main sequence @xcite . over a wide redshift range ,",
    "this correlation remains tight with near unity slope while the normalization evolves quickly with redshift .",
    "this tight correlation of galaxies star - formation activities with their already - formed stellar masses , the nearly invariant slope of this correlation , and the evolution of its normalization in a broad redshift range must impose important constraints on the formation histories of these star - forming galaxies ( for example , see @xcite and @xcite ) . in this work",
    ", we investigate this correlation and its evolution in the redshift range between @xmath17 and @xmath18 , and derive meaningful constraints on the formation histories of the star - forming galaxies at this redshift range .",
    "regarding the sfhs of high - redshift galaxies , another interesting issue is the significant disagreement regarding the evolution of the specific sfr ( ssfr ; defined as sfr/@xmath19 ) at @xmath20 between the observational results and the prediction from galaxy formation models .",
    "sams of galaxy formation predict that the ssfr increases with redshift beyond @xmath20 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while observational results show a plateau over a wide range of redshift , @xmath21 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "recently , there have been several works trying to resolve this tension . for examples ,",
    "@xcite have re - calculated the ssfrs based on their new estimation of uv spectral slope ( @xmath22 ) and dust attenuation , reporting higher values of ssfrs than previously estimated .",
    "another improvement comes from the realization of the fact that the estimation of stellar mass can be affected by the contribution from the nebular emission ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "even though the derived ssfr values show some discrepancies with each other , the results of these works commonly indicate that the stellar masses can be overestimated ( thus ssfrs can be underestimated ) without taking into account this effect . in this work",
    ", we explore this sharp contrast between model and observation , which imposes a challenge for our understanding of galaxy evolution .",
    "our investigation of ssfr evolution is based on the consistent estimation of stellar masses and sfrs ( thus , ssfrs also ) from same sed - fitting ( instead of estimating stellar mass and sfr separately , applying different assumptions ) , especially powered by more realistic assumption about sfhs of galaxies .    in section 2 , we describe the observational data and sample selection .",
    "the details of sed - fitting procedure and the results of this sed - fitting are explained in section 3 . in section 4",
    ", we analyze the results in more detail , especially focusing on the sfhs of high - redshift galaxies and the ssfr evolution at high redshift , and we analyze the ages of these galaxies in section 5 . we summarize our results in section 6 . throughout the paper ,",
    "we adopt a flat @xmath23cdm cosmology , with ( @xmath24 ) = ( 0.3,0.7 ) , and @xmath25 = 70 @xmath26 @xmath27 @xmath28 .",
    "all magnitudes are given in ab magnitude system @xcite",
    "to understand the sfhs of high - redshift star - forming galaxies , we analyze the seds of high - redshift ( @xmath29 ) lbgs observed in the candels / goods - s field .",
    "the goods is a deep sky survey covering a combined area of @xmath30 320 arcmin@xmath31 in two fields  the goods - n centered on the hubble deep field - north ( hdf - n ) and the goods - s centered on the chandra deep field - south ( cdf - s ) .",
    "it carries an extensive wavelength coverage of the panchromatic photometric data from various facilities , including the @xmath6/acs ( advanced camera for surveys ) and @xmath32/irac ( infrared array camera ) , supplemented with extensive spectroscopic follow - ups @xcite .",

    "the deep and extensive multi - band photometric data of the goods / candels provide a unique and useful data set in the study of physical or stellar - population properties of high - redshift galaxies .    in our study , we use the photometric information from observed frame ultraviolet ( uv ) to mid - infrared ( mir ) in fifteen broad bands  @xmath33-band from the ctio ( cerro tololo inter - american observatory ) and the vlt / vimos ( visible multi - object spectrograph ) , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37-bands from @xmath6/acs , f098 m , f105w ( @xmath38 ) , f125w ( @xmath39 ) , and f160w ( @xmath40 ) from @xmath6/wfc3 , @xmath41-bands from vlt / isaac ( infrared spectrometer and array camera ) , and @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 from spitzer / irac . in selecting the high - redshift galaxies based on their color(s ) or in analyzing their observed seds ,",

    "is performed using the tfit @xcite photometric software by the candels team .",
    "tfit is a photometric package for matched photometry with the template - fitting technique .",
    "it uses the positional as well as the morphological information of high - resolution image ( @xmath40-band of @xmath6/wfc3 in our case ) as prior information to measure the corresponding fluxes at other bands with lower resolutions .",

    "the main aim of this experiment is to examine what form of sfh is more appropriate for the analysis of the seds of high - redshift lbgs  in other words , to see which form of sfh is more representative to the actual sfhs of our observed lbgs .    as our first test on the sfhs of candels/ goods - s lbgs",

    "for example , galaxies with similar masses of @xmath173 span almost the entire range of stellar population ages allowed by the sed fitting .",
    "this broad scatter in this correlation , while can be an effect of photometric scatter or fitting anomaly , indicates that the formation or assembly histories of these galaxies are governed not only by their mass but also by other factors ( like minor mergers or interactions ) .",
    "in the right panel of figure [ msage ] , we show the @xmath19age correlation of sam lbgs .",
    "the stellar masses and ages of the sam lbgs also show a positive correlation with large scatter  in a good agreement with the observed goods - s lbgs . besides the difference in the stellar mass range , mentioned in the section 4.1 , the ages of the observed lbgs spans a wider range ( toward old ages ) than the sam lbgs .",
    "to have an insight what can affect the age - spread for the galaxies with similar stellar mass , we check how the mean ages vary depending on various galaxy properties for the sam lbgs with stellar masses in the range of @xmath174 . through this investigation ,",
    "it has turned out that , among various properties , quantities related to the merger event show certain amount of correlation with the stellar population ages of galaxies .",
    "the upper panels of figure [ samagedep ] show that there are positive correlations between the mean age of lbgs and the burst mass fraction  defined as the ratio of the stellar mass built during the merger - driven burst event ( @xmath175 ) to the total stellar mass ( @xmath19 ) ( left panel ) , as well as between the age and the black hole mass ( @xmath176 )  which grows through the merger event ( right panel ) . in lower panels ,",
    "we show the dependence of the galaxies mean age on the time since the latest merger ( @xmath177 , lower right panel ) and since the latest major merger ( @xmath178 , lower left panel ) . here , only the galaxies which experienced merger(s ) are shown , and in the lower left panel , we only show the galaxies which experienced a major merger . among 6851 mock lbgs within this mass range , 79 @xmath179 of galaxies experienced merger event(s ) ( @xmath180 for a major merger ) .",
    "when we compare the stellar population ages of mock lbgs with and without merger experience , they show clearer difference .",
    "the median value of the ages of galaxies which experienced merger events is 360 myr , while it is 290 myr for the galaxies without merger experience .",
    "this indicates that mergers or accretion of small galaxies have certain effects in shaping the galaxies sfhs , thus on the observed age - spread among galaxies with similar stellar mass .",
    "in this work , we analyze the broadband photometric seds of observed goods - s star - forming galaxies , selected by their rest - frame uv colors . through the detailed analysis of the sed - fitting results of these observed galaxies with two different assumptions about their sfhs  the exponentially declining sfhs and the increasing sfhs",

    "the stellar masses and the sfrs of observed goods - s lbgs show a tight correlation , which is in good agreement with the predictions from sam of galaxy formation as well as with the observational results at lower redshift , when we derive these quantities through the sed - fitting with increasing sfhs .",

    "3 .   from the observed tight correlation between galaxies stellar masses and sfrs in the redshift range of @xmath1",
    ", we can also deduce the average sfh of these continuously star - forming galaxies in the given redshift range . from the evolution of the mean ssfr values",

    "our measured ssfr values show an increase with redshift from @xmath18 to @xmath17 , indicating continuous increase from @xmath10 . while contrary to the previous results , this increasing trend is well consistent with recent results , such as @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the ssfr values , which are estimated in a consistent manner from sed - fitting , as well as its increasing trend are in good agreement with the prediction from the sam .",
    "while many of our observed lbgs lie on the upper envelope in the redshift-@xmath169 relation ( i.e. , have the largest possible @xmath169 at given redshift ) , there is a non - negligible fraction of galaxies whose @xmath169 values are much lower than the values at the envelope , especially , at redshifts @xmath172 .",
    "this spread in @xmath169 implies that not all star - forming galaxies caught at redshifts @xmath92 were formed coevally .",
    "our sample of continuously star - forming galaxies follows a positive correlation between their masses and stellar population ages , in a sense that more massive galaxies are , on average older , but with significant scatter  similar with the prediction from the sam . while this positive correlation implies that the formation histories of these star - forming galaxies vary depending on their masses , the broad scatter in this @xmath19age correlation might be an indication that mass is not the only property which affects the formation histories of galaxies .",
    "the correlations between the ages and other properties of mock lbgs from the sam suggest that mergers have certain effects on the age - spread among galaxies with given stellar mass .    from this sed - fitting analysis of the broadband seds of goods - s lbgs",
    ", we can confirm the important speculations of l09 and l10 , which are drawn from the analysis of mock galaxies from sams : namely , ( 1 ) the assumed form of sfhs affect the estimation of stellar population parameters of galaxies from broadband seds , and ( 2 ) we should assume the increasing sfhs , not the exponentially declining ones , in the analysis of uv - selected , star - forming galaxies within the redshift range of @xmath87 .",
    "any bias arising in the fitting procedure due to incorrect assumption on the sfhs would propagate to the inferences on galaxy evolution drawn from the sed - fitting analysis .",
    "the increasing sfhs inferred here from these sed - fitting arguments are qualitatively consistent with the prediction from hierarchical models of galaxy formation in @xmath93cdm ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this smooth increase of sfr at high redshift is expected if the gas accretion rate closely traces the growth rate of halos , which grow as @xmath182 , and the sfr traces gas accretion rate .",
    "semi - analytic models and hydrodynamic simulations generically predict fairly smoothly rising sfhs at these redshifts @xcite .",
    "the generic rising form of the sfh is primarily due to the growth of structure @xcite , but the _ slope _ of the sfh may be modulated by the overall efficiency of converting accreted gas into stars , which depends on the physics of star formation and stellar feedback , and may not be invariant with cosmic time .",
    "also , this continuously rising sfh provides a natural explanation for the tight correlation between the stellar masses and the sfrs of star - forming galaxies over a wide range of redshift , at least up to @xmath183 , as shown in this work  spanning more than 12 billion years , because galaxies would move along this relation as they grow in time .",
    "however , if high - redshift galaxies form their stars with decreasing sfrs with time , this @xmath19sfr correlation should become too broad with decreasing redshift , unless all the lbgs were formed coevally  which is not physically reasonable and is also disfavored from the results in section 5 . on the other hand , if the majority of star - forming galaxies form their stars in a bursty way with short duty cycles , it is very hard to explain the formation of this tight correlation .",
    "in other words , why should the bursty star - formation activity care about the stellar mass of host galaxy , which is mainly the result of past star - formation activity ( see also @xcite and @xcite for the supporting evidence for the continuous sfhs of high - redshift galaxies ) ?    accurate determination of the shape of the sf main sequence and its intrinsic scatter will be very valuable to constrain the efficiency of star formation in different galaxies and environment .",
    "in fact , @xcite suggested that the rising slope of the sfh and the subsequent evolution are related  the more gentle the rise , the more prolonged the overall sf activity .",
    "we speculate that if this is indeed the case , then the best predictor of the future evolution of sf of a galaxy is its position in the main sequence relative to other galaxies , assuming that the main sequence is accurately measured .",
    "the results of section 5  broad distribution of formation times , and the positive correlation between stellar masses and stellar population ages with large scatter  are broadly consistent with the expectations from the sams . however , because the parameter @xmath79 or stellar population age is one of the most poorly constrained parameters in sed - fitting ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it is still premature to draw firm conclusions .",
    "while it is not easy to provide better constraints on the ages of these high - redshift lbgs , more samples from the possible future surveys which are as deep as and wider than the goods would be helpful by providing better statistics and enabling us to study the dependence on interaction or environment .",

    "<S> we investigate the star formation histories ( sfhs ) of high redshift ( @xmath0 ) star - forming galaxies selected based on their rest - frame ultraviolet ( uv ) colors in the candels / goods - s field . by comparing the results from the spectral - energy - distribution - fitting analysis with two different assumptions about the sfhs  i.e. , exponentially declining sfhs as well as increasing ones , we conclude that the sfhs of high - redshift star - forming galaxies increase with time rather than exponentially decline . </S>",
    "<S> we also examine the correlations between the star formation rates ( sfrs ) and the stellar masses . </S>",
    "<S> when the galaxies are fit with rising sfrs , we find that the trend seen in the data qualitatively matches the expectations from a semi - analytic model of galaxy formation . </S>",
    "<S> the mean specific sfr is shown to increase with redshift , also in agreement with the theoretical prediction . from the derived tight correlation between stellar masses and sfrs , we derive the mean sfh of star - forming galaxies in the redshift range of @xmath1 , which shows a steep power - law ( with power @xmath2 ) increase with time . </S>",
    "<S> we also investigate the formation timescales and the mean stellar population ages of these star - forming galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis reveals that uv - selected star - forming galaxies have a broad range of the formation redshift . </S>",
    "<S> the derived stellar masses and the stellar population ages show positive correlation in a sense that more massive galaxies are on average older , but with significant scatter . </S>",
    "<S> this large scatter implies that the galaxies mass is not the only factor which affects the growth or star formation of high - redshift galaxies . </S>"
