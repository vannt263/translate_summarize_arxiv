    "1997 ) enables us to study the plasma structure of the loop .",
    "the origin of the is thought to be a cavity explosion @xcite .",
    "the progenitor is presumed to be a b0 , 15@xmath3  star @xcite and some x - ray studies also estimated the progenitor mass to be 12 - 15@xmath3  ( _ e.g. _ , tsunemi et al .",
    "2007 ) . from the morphological point of view , the is a typical shell - like snr and it is almost circular in shape .",
    "however , a large break is seen in the south , known as `` blowout '' region @xcite .",
    "the origin of the `` blowout '' is not well understood .",
    "@xcite explained this extended structure as a breakout into a lower density ism . on the other hand , based on a radio observation",
    ", @xcite suggested the existence of a secondary snr in the south .",
    "some other radio observations support this conclusion @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite observed this region with the _ xmm - newton _ observatory and found that the x - ray spectra of this region consist of two plasma components with different electron temperatures .",
    "judging from the plasma structures and the metal distributions , they concluded that the x - ray emission is consistent with a origin and that each plasma component is derived from the ejecta and the cavity material , respectively .",
    "they also showed that the x - ray shell is thin in their fields of view ( fov ) and concluded that the origin of the blowout can be explained as a breakout into a lower density ism as proposed by @xcite .",
    "it is natural to consider that such a breakout may also exist along the line of sight .",
    "@xcite observed the along the diameter with _ xmm - newton _ and argued about it .",
    "they divided their fov into a north path and a south path and found the thin shell region to be 5  in the south path and 20  in the north path .",
    "they estimated this thin shell region to have a diameter of 1 , centering on @xmath4 , @xmath5 .",
    "@xcite expanded their observation northward with _",
    "suzaku _ and found that the flux of the swept - up matter in southwest is about a third of that in northeast .",

    "@xcite presumed that there is a blowout region in the direction of our line of sight in the middle west of the loop .    in this paper",
    ", we used 41 observation data obtained by the _ suzaku _ and the _ xmm - newton _ observatories .",
    "we reanalyzed all the data to conduct a comprehensive study on the shell structure of the .",
    "we summarized the 41 observations in table [ tab : sum ] .",
    "all the data were taken between 2002 and 2008 .",
    "the observing regions are shown in figure [ fig : hri ] top .",
    "the circles and rectangles represent the fov of the _ xmm - newton _ mos and the _ suzaku _ xis , respectively .",
    "all of the _ suzaku _ data were analyzed with version 6.5 of the heasoft tools .",
    "for reduction of the _ suzaku _ data , we used version 9 of the suzaku software .",
    "the calibration database ( caldb ) used was updated in july 2008 .",
    "we used revision 2.2 of the cleaned event data and combined 3@xmath23 and 5@xmath25 event files .",
    "we applied the spaced row charge injection ( sci ) method @xcite to p1 , p2 , p3 , p4 , p5 , p6 , p7 , p9 , p10 , p11 , p18 , p19 , p20 , p21 , p22 , p23 , p24 and p25 data .",
    "this method reduces the effect of radiation damage of the xis and recovers the energy resolution , for example , from 205@xmath7ev to 157@xmath8ev at 5.9 kev . in order to exclude the background flare events",
    ", we obtained good time intervals ( gtis ) including only times at which the count rates were within @xmath9 of the mean count rates .    since the is a large diffuse source and our fov",
    "are filled with the snr s emission , we could not obtain background spectra from our fov .",
    "we also had no background data from the neighborhood of the .",
    "we therefore applied the lockman hole data for background subtraction .",
    "we reviewed the effect of the galactic ridge x - ray emission ( grxe ) .",
    "the flux of the grxe at @xmath10 , @xmath11 is @xmath12erg @xmath13s@xmath14deg@xmath15 ( 0.7 - 2.0 kev ) @xcite .",
    "although the ( @xmath16 , @xmath17 ) is located outside the fov of @xcite , this value gives us an upper limit of the grxe at the .",
    "meanwhile , the flux of the is estimated to be @xmath18erg @xmath13s@xmath14deg@xmath15 ( 0.7 - 2.0 kev ) , assuming that the is a circle with a diameter of @xmath19 . therefore , we concluded that the effect of the grxe on the is vanishingly small . the solar wind charge exchange ( swcx ) is also considered to correlate with the soft x - ray background below 1 kev @xcite .",
    "however , in terms of the , we consider that the swcx is negligible because of the prominent surface brightness of the loop .",
    "thus , the lockman hole data obtained in 2006 , 2007 and 2008 were applied for background subtraction .",
    "we selected data whose observation dates were close to those of the observations . since there were no photons above 3.0 kev after background subtraction , the energy ranges of 0.2 - 3.0 kev and 0.4 - 3.0 kev",
    "were used for xis1 ( back - illuminated ccd ; bi ccd ) and xis0,2,3 ( front - illuminated ccd ; fi ccd ) , respectively @xcite .    all the _ xmm - newton _ data were processed with version 7.1.0 of the _ xmm _ science analysis system ( sas ) .",
    "the current calibration files ( ccfs ) used were updated on 2008 june .",
    "we used data obtained with the epic mos and pn cameras .",
    "these data were taken by using the medium filters and the prime full - window mode .",
    "we selected x - ray events corresponding to patterns 0 - 12 and flag = 0 for mos 1 and 2 , patterns 0 - 4 and flag = 0 for pn , respectively . in order to exclude background flare events , we determined the gtis in the same way as those of the _ suzaku _ data .",
    "after filtering the data , they were vignetting - corrected by using the sas task * evigweight*. for background subtraction , we employed blank - sky observations prepared by @xcite for a similar reason with the _ suzaku _ case .",
    "after the background subtraction , the energy range of 0.3 - 3.0 kev was used for each instrument .",
    "to investigate the plasma structure of the , we divided the entire fov into small box regions . in order to equalize the statistics ,",
    "we initially divided all images of xis1 or mos2 into two parts ; if each divided region had more than 10,000 photons , it was once again divided . in this way",
    ", we obtained 1042 box regions .",
    "each region contained 5,000 - 10,000 photons for xis1 and mos2 .",
    "the side length of each box ranges from 2.2  to 14",
    ". therefore box sizes are not smaller than the angular resolution capability of the _ suzaku _ xis .",
    "we grouped 1042 spectra into bins with a minimum of 20 counts such that @xmath20 statistics are appropriate . in order to generate a response matrix file ( rmf ) and",
    "an ancillary response file ( arf ) , we employed xisrmfgen @xcite and xissimarfgen for the _ suzaku _ data , rmfgen and arfgen for the xmm - newton data .",
    "firstly , we fitted all the spectra by a single - component variable abundance non - equilibrium ionization ( vnei ) model .",
    "we employed * tbabs * ( tbingen - boulder ism absorption model ; wilms et al .",
    "2000 ) and * vnei * ( nei ver.2.0 ; borkowski et al .",
    "2001 ) in xspec version 12.5.0 @xcite . in this model , the abundances for c , n , o , ne , mg , si and fe were free , while we set the relative abundances for s to the solar value equal to that of si , ni equal to fe .",
    "the other elements were fixed to their solar values .",
    "other parameters were all free such as the electron temperature , @xmath21 , the ionization timescale , @xmath22 ( a product of the electron density and the elapsed time after the shock heating ) , and the emission measure , em ( @xmath23 , where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the number densities of electron and hydrogen and @xmath26 is the plasma depth ) .",
    "we also set the absorption column density , @xmath27 , to be free .",
    "as a result , the spectra from the limb regions are well fitted by the single - component vnei model . as shown by earlier observations of the northeast and the southeast limb @xcite , the spectra obtained from the limb regions of the cygnus loop",
    "are typically described by a single - component vnei model .    on the other hand , the spectra from the inner regions",
    "are generally not fitted by the single - component vnei model . from earlier observations of the northeast to the southwest regions along the diameter , @xcite found that the spectra from the inner regions of the consist of a two - component vnei plasma .",
    "they concluded the plasma structure of the as follows : the high-@xmath21 ejecta component is surrounded by a low-@xmath21 ism component .",
    "@xcite showed that the two - component vnei model is wholly applicable to the inner regions of the .",
    "therefore , we next intended to give an additional high-@xmath21 vnei component to the single - component vnei model . in this model , we fixed the metal abundances of the low-@xmath21 component to the values obtained from the result of @xcite , since the model whose abundances set all free could not obtain the physically meaningful results .",
    "@xcite showed the relative abundances to the solar values of the ism component as follows : c=0.27 , n=0.10 , o=0.11 , ne=0.21 , mg=0.17 , si=0.34 , s=0.17 , fe(=ni)=0.20 .",
    "in addition , they fixed other elements to the solar values @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , in the high-@xmath21 component , the abundances for o , ne , mg , si , and fe were free , while we set the abundances for c and n equal to o , s equal to si , ni equal to fe .",
    "other elements were fixed to their solar values .",
    "the other parameters such as @xmath21 , @xmath22 , em , and @xmath27 were all free .",
    "we applied both single - component vnei model and two - component vnei model to all the spectra and determined which model is acceptable by using the f - test with a significance level of 99% . as a result ,",
    "roughly @xmath28 of the northeast region and @xmath29 of the southwest region need an additional component , where @xmath30 is a shock radius . here",
    ", we define the `` limb observations '' as the regions where the single - component vnei model is acceptable and the `` inside observations '' as the remaining regions .",
    "figure [ fig : spec ] shows two example xis1 spectra . the spectral extracted regions are shown in figure [ fig : hri ] .",
    "both regions are located at the inside observations and the two - component vnei model is applicable .",
    "the bottom two panels show the best - fit results of the two - component vnei model .",
    "blue and red lines represent the high-@xmath21 and the low-@xmath21 component .",
    "we also show the result with the single - component vnei model at the top two panels for comparison .",
    "the best - fit parameters are shown in table [ tab : spec ] .",
    "these results show that the reduced @xmath20 values are significantly improved with the two - component vnei models .",
    "all the spectra are well fitted by either the single - component vnei model or the two - component vnei model . from the best - fit parameters of the inside observations",
    ", we found that the electron temperature of the low-@xmath21 component is almost uniform .",
    "the averaged value is 0.23 kev ( @xmath31 kev ) and it is sufficiently lower than that of the high-@xmath21 component ( 0.52 kev , @xmath32 kev ) . the temperature of the low-@xmath21 component is close to that of the limb observations ( 0.29 kev , @xmath33 kev ) .",
    "therefore we collectively call these components `` low-@xmath21 component '' hereafter",
    ".    figure [ fig : kte ] shows our fov and the electron temperature distribution of the low-@xmath21 component overlaid with the white contour from the _ rosat _ hri image .",
    "the averaged value is @xmath34 kev and it ranges from 0.12 kev to 0.35 kev .",
    "meanwhile , the temperature of the high-@xmath21 component ranges from 0.4 kev to 0.9 kev , which is consistent with the previous observations @xcite .",
    "then , we confirmed that the temperature of each component is clearly separated .",
    "@xcite also showed that the temperature distribution of the high-@xmath21 component is not uniform and that it is lower in the southwest part than that in the northeast part . on the other hand ,",
    "the temperature of the low-@xmath21 component is relatively uniform ( see figure [ fig : kte ] ) .",
    "the detailed distribution shows the temperature near the center is lower than that of the surroundings .",
    "we also found that the temperature distribution is seamless at the boundary between the limb observations and the inside observations .",
    "therefore , the low-@xmath21 components of these regions must have the same origin .",
    "the spectra from the limb observations are obviously swept - up ism origin , and thus , we concluded that any low-@xmath21 component originates from the ism component .",
    "taking into account the age of the the reverse shocks should have already reached its center .",
    "therefore , on the assumption that the density of the ejecta - origin plasma is homogeneous , the x - ray flux depends exclusively on its plasma depth . in figure",
    "[ fig : spec ] , the blue line represents the high-@xmath21 component of the two - component vnei model . since the region - a and the region - b are located at the same radial distance from the center ( @xmath35 , where we define @xmath36 as a distance from the `` geometric center '' determined by levenson et al .",
    "1998 ) , they should have almost the same plasma depths .",
    "accordingly , the fluxes of the high-@xmath21 components are actually not so different , while the spectral extracted regions are separated . meanwhile , the contributions of the low-@xmath21 components are quite different as shown with the red lines in figure [ fig : spec ] . from the bottom left panel of figure [ fig : spec ] , the flux of the low-@xmath21 component in the region - a overwhelms that of the high-@xmath21 component at 0.2 - 1.0 kev . on the other hand ,",
    "the contribution of the low-@xmath21 component in the region - b is clearly smaller than that in the region - a .",
    "such a difference should be attributed to the difference of the surrounding shell of each region .",
    "the value of the flux is proportional to em ( @xmath37 ) , which means that the surface brightness is sensitive to the change of the density and the plasma depth there .    in order to estimate the ambient density of the",
    ", we calculated the fluxes of the low-@xmath21 component from all regions .",
    "figure [ fig : flux ] left shows the 0.2 - 3.0 kev flux distribution of the low-@xmath21 component .",
    "we also show that of the high-@xmath21 component at the right panel .",
    "the flux distribution of the high-@xmath21 component is relatively uniform compared with that of the low-@xmath21 component .",
    "it reflects that the ejecta component uniformly filled inside the loop .",
    "in contrast , from the left panel , we clearly see the `` limb - brightening '' which reflects the spherical shell structure .",
    "therefore , we confirmed that the low-@xmath21 component comes from the surrounding ism .",
    "we also found that the northeast flux is higher than that in the southwest .",
    "it suggests that the density is higher in the direction of the northeast than that of the southwest .",
    "the detailed shell structures are also seen from the left panel , for example , the `` v - shape '' knot at the southwest @xcite .    from the left panel of figure [ fig : flux ] , we found the flux distribution inside the loop is far from what we expect in the uniform shell structure .",
    "this suggests the ambient density and the shell thickness varies considerably from region to region .",
    "thus , we can study the line - of - sight shell structure of the loop . considering the relation between the surface brightness and the plasma density , the flux of the low-@xmath21 component reflects the local density of the ism .",
    "for example , the bright region in the northeast part is considered that the blast waves are expanding into the dense ism there .",
    "in contrast , there is a low - flux region at the south of the loop ( see figure [ fig : flux ] ) .",
    "it suggests the ambient density there is extremely low compared with other areas of the loop .",
    "as shown by @xcite , we noticed that there is a large break in the south where the ism density is very thin .",
    "in general , the velocity of the blast wave toward such tenuous ism should become higher than other region .",
    "therefore , it forms a blowout where the shell thickness must be thin .    from figure",
    "[ fig : flux ] , we also found a large low - flux region at slightly west of the center . although our fov does not cover the whole region , the structure is close to a circular form , and we estimated the diameter to be @xmath38 .",
    "the size is comparable to that of the south blowout .",
    "the existence of such large low - flux region suggests that it has a blowout structure along the line of sight like the south blowout .",
    "this result confirms the prediction by @xcite and @xcite . from figure",
    "[ fig : flux ] , the northeast of the center also has lower flux than that of the surrounding region .",
    "it strongly indicates that the line - of - sight ambient density there is locally low as well as that in the south blowout .",
    "this region has a c - shape structure which could be explained by the superposition of the circular low - flux region and the bright region where the blast wave interacts with a small cloud .",
    "we estimate the diameter of this low - flux region to be @xmath39 .",
    "these results show the ambient density of the is quite different from region to region .      to put our result into perspective",
    ", we plotted the flux of each component as a function of radius @xmath36 as shown in figure [ fig : flux_plot ] . from this figure",
    ", we found the flux of the high-@xmath21 component ( shown as crosses ) decreases from the center to the outside , which reflects the spherical structure of the ejecta filled inside the . on the other hand ,",
    "the flux of the low-@xmath21 component ( circles ) has a limb - brightening structure , as mentioned in the previous section .",
    "furthermore the low-@xmath21 flux at the southwest ( @xmath40 ) is totally lower than that at the northeast .",
    "while the high-@xmath21 flux distribution is approximately symmetric , the low-@xmath21 flux is a few times higher at the northeast than that at the southwest . in addition , looking at the inner region of the loop , the flux distribution of the low-@xmath21 component is declining from @xmath41 to @xmath42 .",
    "this fact suggests the ambient density of the globally decreases from the northeast to the southwest .    in order to estimate the ambient density more quantitatively , we calculated the em of the low-@xmath21 component and plotted it as a function of @xmath36 .",
    "figure [ fig : em_region ] shows the em distribution of the low-@xmath21 component . we plotted the em profiles from six rectangular regions with different azimuthal angles as shown in figure [ fig : em_region ] ( ne - a to ne - e and sw )",
    "that are shown in figure [ fig : em_plots ] .",
    "we simulated the em profile of the shell component derived from the sedov solution with different ambient density @xmath43 and estimated @xmath43 by comparing our observations with the em models . in this model , we assume the shock radius of the to be 13 pc and the ejecta is filled in 90@xmath44 of it .",
    "the results are shown in figure [ fig : em_plots ] with red lines .",
    "we also show the best - fit models using the data only in the limb - brightening regions with green lines . as for the northeast regions , the em profiles inside the loop are close to the models of @xmath43=0.3 - 0.4 @xmath45 ( red ) while the em values at the limb - brightening regions are higher than these models . on the other hand , applying the data only in the limb - brightening regions ( green ) , @xmath43 increases to 0.7 - 0.9 @xmath45 . in any case",
    ", there are no sedov models which agree with the em profiles of the northeast part of the .",
    "the result is the same as the case of the southwest region while the ambient density @xmath43 is less than half of the northeast results .",
    "these results clearly show the can not be explained by a simple sedov evolution model .",
    "@xcite proposed that the s sn explosion had occurred in a preexisting cavity and some other studies also supported it @xcite . considering their results ,",
    "it is natural that the em distribution disagrees with a simple sedov model , and thus , we concluded that our result also supports the cavity explosion as the origin of the from the standpoint of the x - ray spectral analysis .",
    "it should be noted that the cygnus loop is almost perfect circular in shape , although the em ( or flux ) is globally higher in the northeast than that in the southwest .",
    "this fact strongly suggests that the northeast and the southwest blast waves should have hit the cavity wall very recently , and that the cavity - wall density is higher in the northeast than that in the southwest .",
    "by analyzing the x - ray spectra , we clearly distinguished the ism component from the ejecta component , and established a method to investigate the line - of - sight shell structure . from the flux distribution of the ism component",
    ", we found three low - flux regions in the fov ; one is a well - known southwest blowout which is evidence of the cavity - wall break , and we also found other low - flux regions at the west and the northeast of the center . from the em distribution of the ism component , we support that the is originated from a cavity explosion .",
    "then , the ism component , or cavity wall does not have an uniform structure but has a lot of breaks or tenuous regions .",
    "we also found that the condition of the surrounding cavity wall is not uniform ; the density of it is globally higher in the northeast than that in the southwest .",
