    "modern experiments using low - energy neutrons address issues of importance in nuclear , particle , and astrophysics  @xcite . in particular ,",
    "precision measurements of neutron decay parameters such as the decay rate and angular correlation coefficients of the decay products are of fundamental importance . in combination with a separate measurement of the neutron decay rate , for example",
    ", a measurement of the electron asymmetry coefficient in polarized neutron decay ( the @xmath2 coefficient ) can be used to determine the weak polar vector - axial vector coupling ratio @xmath3 and , by comparison with muon decay , the kobayashi - maskawa ( km ) matrix element @xmath4 , one of the parameters of the standard model of elementary particle interactions  @xcite .    the hypothesis that the km matrix is unitary implies that the sum of the squares of each row are unity .",
    "the uncertainty of the unitarity test is dominated by the accuracy of the large diagonal elements @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 . while at present , the best limits on the unitarity of the km matrix are extracted from measurements of superallowed beta decay , in the long run study of neutron beta decay",
    "promises to provide even better limits  @xcite . while it is difficult to measure @xmath4 to @xmath7 ,",
    "there is no hope of measuring @xmath5 or @xmath6 to this accuracy in the foreseeable future .",
    "it is important to note that present measurements in the neutron sector are marginally inconsistent with the unitarity of the km matrix  @xcite : the value of @xmath4 inferred from the @xmath2 measurements of comparable accuracy corresponds to a violation of the unitarity of the km matrix by about @xmath8 .",
    "also , measurements of the neutrino asymmetry @xmath9 in polarized neutron decay can be used to place interesting constraints on possible deviations from the standard model in the charged current sector of the weak interaction , such as the possible existence of right - handed weak currents  @xcite .",
    "it is therefore important to improve the accuracy of these measurements .",
    "unfortunately , both of the most accurate measurements of the @xmath2 and @xmath9 coefficients in neutron decay suffer from a common limitation : the absolute accuracy of the neutron beam polarization measurement . to significantly improve the measurements alternative",
    "techniques are needed .",
    "one approach is to conduct the measurement with very low energy neutrons ( known as ultracold neutrons , see  @xcite for an introduction ) .",
    "ultracold neutrons ( ucns ) can be prepared in a definite state of polarization relative to an external magnetic field by passing them through a region in which the @xmath10 interaction is larger than the kinetic energy for one of the spin states .",
    "ucn production rates are currently limited .",
    "another strategy , and the one pursued in this work , is to develop more accurate methods of measuring the polarization of neutron beams . in order to make significant progress , a method of absolute neutron beam polarization measurement with an accuracy better than 0.1%",
    "is required .",
    "past techniques for absolute neutron beam polarization measurement in the cold , thermal , and epithermal neutron energy ranges fall into two main classes : ( 1 ) relative intensity measurements of the spin components in a polarized beam after spatial separation using a magnetic field gradient ( the stern - gerlach effect )  @xcite and ( 2 ) transmission measurements using a second polarizing device ( an analyzer ) in combination with spin flippers  @xcite . in principle , both techniques can be implemented in a manner which is free of systematic errors for monoenergetic , divergence - free neutron beams . in practice , however , there are limitations to both of these techniques that are associated with the phase space density of realistic neutron beams .",
    "a detailed discussion of some of the difficulties that are encountered with these techniques has appeared recently  @xcite .",
    "the use of polarized @xmath1he gas targets as neutron polarizers makes possible a promising technique for absolute neutron beam polarization measurement . for neutrons of a given energy , there is a simple ( and essentially exact ) relation between the neutron polarization @xmath11 produced by transmission through a polarized target and the relative transmission of neutrons through the polarized ( @xmath12 ) and unpolarized ( @xmath13 ) target : @xmath14 @xmath1he is an attractive target for the development of this technique .",
    "low energy ( thermal ) neutrons interact with @xmath0he primarily by the absorption reaction @xmath15  +  @xmath16  @xmath17  @xmath18  +  @xmath19 with a cross section @xmath20 barns at 25.3 mev  @xcite .",
    "all other channels have comparatively small cross sections at thermal energies .",
    "a @xmath0he target that is thick for absorption is thin for the other reaction channels and the equation above holds to a high degree of accuracy under realistic beam conditions and detector geometries .",
    "since this relation requires only relative neutron transmission measurements , it promises to form the basis of a new and reliable way to measure and monitor on - line the absolute polarization of a neutron beam @xcite .",
    "the realization of this method of neutron beam polarization measurement has been made possible by recent advancements in techniques to polarize @xmath1he gas by optical pumping .",
    "two methods have been developed to polarize ground state @xmath1he gas atoms : spin exchange with optically polarized rb  @xcite , and optical pumping of metastable @xmath1he followed by metastability exchange collisions .",
    "both techniques have been applied at the ill in grenoble and at nist to polarize neutron beams  @xcite .",
    "the rb spin exchange method has been used to produce polarized @xmath1he targets for several particle and nuclear physics experiments  @xcite . the first experiment using a @xmath1he spin filter to polarize an epithermal neutron beam",
    "was performed at los alamos by coulter _",
    "et al . _ in 1989  @xcite .",
    "the neutron beam polarization was determined in this initial experiment with an uncertainty of 10% .",
    "they used a dye laser to polarize rb atoms .",
    "recent progress in the rb spin exchange technique has been aided largely by the commercial availability of high power laser diode arrays  @xcite .",
    "the technique described in ref .",
    "@xcite assumed that the neutron beams to be polarized were from a cw source with a broad energy spectrum , and thus required a set of transmission measurements through a reference cell to effectively measure the energy spectrum . at a short pulsed spallation neutron source",
    "the energy of the neutrons can be determined very accurately using time - of - flight ( tof ) techniques .",
    "in addition , the pulsed nature of the source has other advantages in the determination of detector backgrounds and _ in situ _ control of systematic errors ( as discussed further in section 4 ) .    in this paper , we describe the first accurate absolute measurement of neutron beam polarization using this technique .",
    "our measurement , performed at the lansce pulsed neutron source at los alamos , has achieved an absolute accuracy of 0.3% in the neutron energy range of 40 mev to 10 ev .",
    "this accuracy is comparable to the best previous measurements using supermirror neutron polarizers at energies of a few mev , and to our knowledge represents the most accurate absolute measurement of neutron beam polarization made in this energy range .",
    "we argue that the absolute accuracy can be improved by about an order of magnitude and that the technique can be extended to lower neutron energies .",
    "this development therefore promises to remove one of the obstacles to the goal of improving the accuracy of measurements of the @xmath2 and @xmath9 coefficients in neutron beta decay .",
    "in addition , the result is important for the use of polarized @xmath1he spin filters as neutron polarizers and polarization analyzers .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "transmission of unpolarized neutrons through polarized gas is discussed in section 2 .",
    "section 3 discusses the lansce pulsed neutron source and experimental setup with the @xmath1he spin filter .",
    "data analysis and results are presented in section 4 and discussed in section 5 .",
    "finally , we note that another approach which exploits the properties of polarized @xmath1he is being pursued in which @xmath1he is used as an ideal neutron polarization analyzer  @xcite .",
    "polarized @xmath1he can be used as a nearly perfect neutron - spin filter because of its very large , spin - dependent neutron reaction cross section . in this section",
    "we review what is known regarding the interactions of low energy neutrons with @xmath0he and describe the operation of a neutron spin filter .",
    "we begin by separating the interaction of low energy neutrons with @xmath0he into elastic and inelastic channels .",
    "we first identify the following contributions to the elastic cross section : ( 1 ) potential scattering of the neutron from the @xmath0he nucleus due to the strong interaction , ( 2 ) the electromagnetic spin - orbit interaction of the magnetic moment of the moving neutron with the magnetic fields originating from the electric charge of the nucleus and bound electrons , ( 3 ) the electromagnetic interaction of the internal charge distribution of the neutron with the bound electrons and nucleus of the @xmath0he atom , and ( 4 ) the electromagnetic interaction of the induced electric dipole moment of the neutron with the electric field of the nucleus . in the energy range of these measurements ,",
    "the relative sizes of the scattering lengths for these processes are approximately @xmath21",
    ". clearly ( 1 ) dominates .",
    "the potential scattering @xmath22 is independent of neutron energy in this energy range and can be spin dependent in principle .",
    "however , the elastic cross section is small compared to the inelastic cross section in our energy range and we will not need to know anything about the possible spin dependence of this cross section . the electromagnetic spin - orbit scattering , which is spin dependent , vanishes for forward scattering and is therefore also negligible .",
    "in addition to elastic scattering , there are two inelastic channels available for neutrons on @xmath0he . @xmath23",
    "the energy dependence of both cross sections obeys the well known @xmath24 law : @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the spin averaged cross section for neutrons moving at a speed of @xmath27 = 2200 m / s , which corresponds to a neutron energy of 25.3 mev  @xcite .",
    "the reaction @xmath28 has a cross section of 54 @xmath29barns at 25.3 mev  @xcite and will be ignored in the remaining discussion . due to the presence of a broad ( 400 kev ) @xmath30 excited state of the @xmath31he compound nucleus , located 650 kev below the @xmath32 threshold , the reaction @xmath33 has a very large cross section @xmath26 of 5333@xmath347 barns at this energy  @xcite .",
    "since this resonance is only open in the @xmath35 channel , the absorption cross section is quite spin dependent .",
    "the energy dependence of this reaction has been measured to high accuracy in this energy range , and has been shown to obey the @xmath24 law  @xcite .    to understand the spin dependence of this reaction",
    ", we consider the following formalism .",
    "we consider the low energy regime where only @xmath36 partial waves contribute ( the @xmath37 contribution to the cross section at neutron energies @xmath38 10  ev is at the @xmath39 level ) . for incident neutrons on a spin 1/2 target ,",
    "we define @xmath40 and @xmath41 as the cross sections for the singlet and triplet compound states , respectively .",
    "the spin independent cross section is then : @xmath42 and the cross section for a particular spin state ( the polarized cross section ) is : @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the target spin .",
    "the `` experimental '' cross sections for neutron and target spins parallel ( + ) or antiparallel (  ) can be defined : @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the target polarization . for @xmath47 and",
    "@xmath46 = 100% : @xmath48 @xmath49 @xmath50 @xmath51 for the case of @xmath1he , passell and schermer  @xcite have measured @xmath52 = 1.010(32 ) , making : @xmath53 @xmath54 polarized @xmath1he targets with 100% polarization are therefore ideal neutron polarizers .    the transmission for unpolarized neutrons with spins parallel and antiparallel to the @xmath1he spin , on an ensemble of polarized @xmath1he nuclei with polarization @xmath55 is given by @xmath56 , \\label{eq : trans1}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 is the number density and @xmath57 is the length of the sample .",
    "polarization of the transmitted beam is then @xmath58 and the transmission through the filter is given by @xmath59 here @xmath60 is the transmission through the @xmath1he cell when the @xmath1he polarization is zero . because the absorption cross section is inversely proportional to the neutron velocity , and the scattering cross section is nearly constant over the energy range of interest , this relation has a simple energy dependence which we exploit in the data analysis .    for the beam polarization",
    "we obtain equation  [ eq : polvratio ] from equations [ eq : pol1 ] and [ eq : trans2 ] @xmath61 according to this result , we need only measure the transmission ratio @xmath62 as a function of neutron energy @xmath63 caused by @xmath1he polarization to determine the neutron beam polarization at @xmath64",
    ". we do not need to know the areal density of the @xmath1he , the cross sections , or the @xmath1he polarization .",
    "only an accurate relative transmission measurement is required .",
    "if the polarized @xmath1he cell is used to analyze the neutron spin then the analyzing power is @xmath65 figure  [ fig : char ] shows characteristics of a @xmath1he spin filter for a cell with @xmath1he thickness of 30 bar - cm ( corresponding to an areal density of @xmath66 @xmath67 ) and @xmath1he polarization of 55% . in this figure ,",
    "the neutron beam polarization , transmission and figure - of - merit ( fom)=@xmath68 are plotted as a function of neutron energy .",
    "the fom is inversely proportional to the running time of experiments whose error is dominated by the counting statistics of a signal depending on neutron polarization @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : char ] demonstrates the useful energy range of a spin filter with a fixed @xmath1he thickness . to date",
    "the reported @xmath1he polarizations with the rubidium spin - exchange method in large - volume cells are in the range of 40%70% @xcite .",
    "it is then possible to build practical @xmath1he neutron spin filters for neutron energies up to tens of ev , limited ultimately by the @xmath24 velocity dependence of the neutron absorption cross section .",
    "the energy range of supermirror polarizers @xcite extends from cold to thermal neutron energies , but at epithermal energies the @xmath1he spin filter competes only with the cryogenic polarized proton spin filter @xcite , which operates by spin - dependent scattering as opposed to spin - dependent absorption .",
    "in this section we describe in detail the aspects of the neutron beamline and experimental apparatus which are important for understanding the measurements described in section 4 .      at the manuel lujan neutron scattering center ( mlnsc ) at lansce , neutrons are produced by spallation .",
    "first , 500  @xmath29s - wide , 800-mev proton pulses are injected into the los alamos proton storage ring ( psr ) . inside the psr ,",
    "the pulses are compressed into triangular pulses 250  ns wide at the base before delivery to the spallation target at a rate of 20  hz , producing unpolarized neutrons in the mev energy range .",
    "the spallation target consists of two tungsten cylinders of 20  cm diameter .",
    "the cylinders are located one above the other along the vertical proton beam axis .",
    "the upper cylinder has a length of 7  cm , while the lower one is 27  cm long .",
    "the gap between them is 14  cm and is surrounded by moderation and reflector material .",
    "the horizontal flight paths are located at the level of the gap to minimize contamination of the beam from gamma - rays and high - energy neutrons .",
    "the experiment described here was performed on a flight path with a gadolinium - poisoned water moderator and a cadmium / boron liner .",
    "a more detailed description of the spallation source and the associated beamline is given in @xcite .",
    "the neutron yield from the water moderator surface has an approximately maxwell - boltzmann distribution at the effective temperature of the moderator , with a high - energy tail that falls off approximately like @xmath69 .",
    "this is shown in figure  [ fig : beamflux ] , which displays the neutron flux on the surface of the moderator calculated for an average proton current of @xmath70a .",
    "the peak of the neutron flux for the water moderator used in this experiment , @xmath71 neutrons/(ev@xmath72s@xmath72sr ) , is at about 40  mev  @xcite .",
    "@xmath73 , the number of neutrons per second in the epithermal energy range with energies between @xmath74 and @xmath75 in the beam , is approximately given by @xmath76 here @xmath77 , @xmath78 is the fraction of the @xmath79  @xmath80 moderator surface the detector views through the collimation , and @xmath81 is the detector solid angle ( @xmath82  sr ) .",
    "the accuracy of the time - of - flight measurement depends on the length of the flight path ( which in this experiment was about 60  m ) and the width of the proton pulse .",
    "further time broadening of the neutron pulse is introduced by the neutron moderation processes and the fact that the normal of the moderator surface is at a @xmath83 degree angle with respect to the flight path , leading to a distribution of lengths of the flight path of the neutrons across the beam profile .",
    "when the neutrons interact with the moderator , the neutron time spread can be described by the sum of two convolutions between a gaussian and a pair of exponential tails as discussed in ref .",
    "these time broadenings have an energy dependence .",
    "all of these effects are taken into account by the code fitxs @xcite used to fit the energy calibration data .",
    "the goal of the experiment was to study polarized @xmath1he as a neutron spin filter , determine the accuracy of the beam polarization measurement technique , and discover the important sources of systematic error .",
    "figure [ fig : beamscheme ] shows schematically the main components of our experimental set up in flight path 2 at mlnsc .",
    "a thin @xmath1he/@xmath31he ion chamber combination was used to normalize the beam flux , with a statistical accuracy of @xmath39 per neutron pulse  @xcite .",
    "after the beam monitor , the neutrons were collimated to a beam of 1.1 cm in diameter .",
    "then the neutrons interacted with a cell of @xmath1he , located 9 m from the source .",
    "the @xmath1he apparatus was mounted on a movable table so that two @xmath1he cells , one polarized and one unpolarized , could be alternated in and out of the beam .",
    "in addition to neutrons the beam contains a tof - dependent gamma ray background .",
    "detector backgrounds were determined by a modification of the absorber techniques described in ref .",
    "a 0.13 mm thick in foil and a 2.6 mm thick ta foil were both present in the beam during the experiment .",
    "the resonance absorption in these nuclei was used to determine the gamma background on - line  at energies corresponding to compound nuclear resonances in these nuclei , the neutron absorption cross section is large enough that , for these thicknesses , essentially no neutrons pass through the absorbers .    because of the maxwellian energy distribution of neutrons from the moderator ,",
    "a few very low - energy neutrons are present .",
    "if detected , these neutrons can overlap in time with the faster neutrons of the next pulse ( frame overlap ) and complicate the interpretation of the transmission data . in our measurements ,",
    "these low energy neutrons are absorbed in the @xmath1he targets , due to the very large cross section of neutrons on @xmath1he at these low energies .",
    "the water moderator is also poisoned with gd to absorb low energy neutrons . as a result",
    "we expect ( and observed ) no frame overlap in our measurements .",
    "collimation and shielding of the neutron beam is accomplished by a combination of brass , lead , and polyethylene loaded with either boron or lithium .",
    "brass collimators located immediately up - stream and downstream of the @xmath1he gas cell define a 1.1  cm diameter beam . a lead wall with a 10  cm square hole",
    "is located downstream of the second set of brass collimators and limits the flux of fast neutrons entering the 40  m long evacuated beam pipe leading to the @xmath1he scintillation detector .",
    "a series of borated polyethylene collimators with 10  cm diameter holes are located at regular intervals inside the beam pipe .",
    "a wall of lithium - loaded polyethylene with a 10  cm square hole is constructed 3  m from the detector .",
    "attempts to locate shielding tightly around the detector were found to increase the background .",
    "therefore the detector was left unshielded .",
    "neutrons were detected with a @xmath1he gas scintillation detector .",
    "discriminated pmt pulses were counted with a multiscaler . the neutron detector and associated electronics",
    "are described in section 3.4 .",
    "@xmath1he gas was polarized using the rb - spin exchange method .",

    "the resultant @xmath1he polarization saturates at a value @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the average rb polarization produced by laser optical pumping and @xmath88 is the spin - exchange rate from the rb to the @xmath1he nucleus .",

    "rb densities of @xmath91 @xmath92 are used .",
    "typical alkali - spin exchange apparatus can be found in refs  @xcite .",
    "the most common lasers in use for the rb optical pumping in high density @xmath0he targets are ti : sapphire lasers and high - power laser diode arrays ( lda ) @xcite .",
    "two fiber - coupled ldas @xcite were used in this experiment .",
    "the unpolarized laser beam from the fiber was first focused and then linearly polarized with a beam polarizing cube .",
    "the linearly polarized component , which traversed the cube , was first circularly polarized with a quarter wave plate and then refocused so that the sample cell was completely covered by the light spot .",
    "the linearly polarized component which reflected from the cube was redirected parallel to the first beam with a mirror , and then circularly polarized by a second polarizing - cube / quarter - wave - plate pair .",
    "thus the cylindrical 10-cm long cell was covered with four circularly polarized round light spots .",
    "the wavelength of the lasers were monitored by a spectrometer  @xcite .",
    "the state of the art of the glass cell preparation for high @xmath1he polarization is discussed in ref .",
    "the cell construction is designed to optimize the fom of the spin filter and meet practical considerations as well .",
    "the cells of this experiment were 10 cm long and 3.5 cm in diameter .",
    "the cylindrical part of the cell was produced from reblown corning 1720 aluminosilicate glass with a wall thickness of about 3 mm .",

    "a destructive pressure test with water was performed with a few cells which had the same design . the maximum pressure before the burst was measured to be about 16  bar .",
    "the @xmath1he polarization time constants varied from 40  h to 60  h. the cell used for this measurement had 3.3  bar @xmath1he , for a @xmath1he density of @xmath96  @xmath67 , and a measured relaxation time of approximately 45 hours . the highest polarization",
    "@xmath1he with this cell was measured using the neutron beam to be 45% . due to technical difficulties",
    ", this polarization could not be maintained , and the average polarization achieved for the measurement was near 20% .",
    "the @xmath1he polarization direction was perpendicular to the neutron beam .",
    "the 86-cm diameter coils in the helmholtz configuration were used to provide the holding field of 3.0 mt .",
    "the @xmath1he polarization was monitored by the adiabatic fast passage method @xcite .",
    "the oven required to control the rb density in the sample cell contained two almost identical @xmath1he cells .",
    "one of the cells was continuously polarized by two lasers : the second cell , which contained approximately the same amount of @xmath1he as the first , did not have any rb so the @xmath1he nuclei were not polarized .",
    "this cell was used as a reference cell .",
    "the cells were kept at temperature of about 175  @xmath97c for the optimum rb density .",
    "the whole @xmath0he apparatus was mounted on a movable table which allowed the cells to be alternated into and out of the beam every two minutes by switching the position of the table whose position was controlled with an accuracy of 0.2 mm . in one table position 2400 neutron pulses were accumulated , after which the table was moved to the other position .",
    "each two - position cycle comprises one run .",
    "the data acquisition system separated information between the polarized cell and reference cell .",
    "a @xmath1he scintillation detector was chosen as the transmission detector for its high efficiency in this neutron energy range , fast time response ( @xmath98 nsec ) , and insensitivity to gamma rays .",
    "the @xmath0he scintillation detector utilizes the same large capture cross section for neutrons on @xmath0he that is used in the polarizer : @xmath99 . because the capture cross section depends on the neutron energy , the @xmath1he thickness in the detector",
    "can be selected so that it has the optimum stopping power for the neutrons of interest . thus the neutron detection efficiency of the cell with a given pressure depends on the neutron energy . however , since the neutron kinetic energy is small compared to the @xmath100 value of the reaction , the pulse height of the neutron capture event by @xmath1he is constant .    the products from the reaction , triton and proton , have kinetic energy of 575  kev and 192  kev , respectively .",
    "the triton has a mean free path of 0.9  bar - cm in @xmath0he gas and the proton mean - free path is 5.83  bar - cm . in the experiment we used a single cylindrical @xmath1he scintillation detector cell with a diameter of 5 cm and length of 5 cm .",
    "we used typically 8  bar of @xmath1he in the detector cell .",
    "the great majority of capture events deposit all their energy in the detector .",
    "the detector efficiency is then given by the neutron absorption in the cell : @xmath101 a small correction must be made to the detector efficiency when neutrons are captured near the wall of the detector , and subsequently do not deposit all their energy within the detector .",
    "this effect is energy dependent , since low energy neutrons have a higher absorption cross section and are therefore captured nearer the front of the detector ( see figure  [ fig : profile ] ) .",
    "since we require only a transmission @xmath102 , and the efficiency and `` wall effect '' are spin - independent , for the neutron polarization measurements no corrections need be made to the raw data to account for these effects . however , the energy dependence of the efficiency has a small effect on the calibration of the neutron tof data in terms of neutron energy ( discussed in section 4.2 ) .",
    "the detector cell was made from aluminum with a 5 mm thick entrance window for neutrons at the end of the cylinder .",
    "scintillation light was detected through a 3 mm thick sapphire window which was mounted on the other end of the cylinder and was sealed with a viton o - ring .",
    "the photomultiplier tube was a 2 inch diameter amperex xp2262b which provided a fast rise time ( @xmath103 nsec ) and a good quantum efficiency ( @xmath104% at @xmath105 nm ) .",
    "the two charged particles , proton and triton , from the capture reaction produce vacuum ultraviolet ( vuv ) scintillation light in @xmath1he gas through de - excitations of short - lived @xmath1he quasi - molecules @xcite .",
    "the n-@xmath1he reaction is estimated to produce @xmath106 1 - 2 vuv photons per kev in @xmath1he gas .",
    "it was impractical in our case to efficiently detect vuv photons .",
    "therefore , the inside walls of the cell were coated with a wavelength shifter ( wls ) to convert the vuv light to the visible region .",
    "the wls was tetraphenylbutadiene ( tpb , 1,1,4,4-tetraphenyl-1,3-butadiene ; fluka @xmath107 ) .",
    "the fluorescence efficiency of tpb has been studied recently by mckinsey _",
    "after the coatings were made , the cell was held at a temperature of @xmath108  c and pumped to a pressure below @xmath109 mbar for a day .    to increase the light output and improve the pulse height resolution , 7% of xe gas by volume was added @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : phd ] shows the pulse height distribution with the @xmath1he - xe mixture measured with thermal neutrons .",
    "pulses from the photomultiplier tube were fanned into three separate integral level discriminators whose outputs are in turn recorded in scalers .",
    "the first of the discriminator - scaler pairs is used to determine the neutron yield from which the transmission ratio is extracted , and is described in more detail in sec .",
    "the remaining two discriminator - scaler pairs are used to stabilize the gain of the photomultiplier tube .",
    "these discriminators are set at 60  mv and 120  mv , respectively .",
    "the lower discriminator is set in the minimum of the pulse height distribution from the detector and counts essentially all of the neutron events .",
    "the upper discriminator is centered at the peak of the pulse height distribution and has a count rate about half that of the lower level discriminator . at approximately five minute intervals ,",
    "the data acquisition system reads both scaler values and adjusts the voltage of the photomultiplier tube until the scaler value associated with the 60  mv discriminator is approximately twice that of the 120  mv one . by this method",
    "the gain of the pmt was stabilized to the 1% level .",
    "given the spectrum of pulse height shapes and the location of the discriminator windows , this stability suffices to reduce the fluctuation of the number of recorded neutron counts due to detector gain changes to a value which was below counting statistics .",
    "pulses from the @xmath1he scintillator are first passed through a 100 ns filter for shaping .",
    "they are then passed through a 10 @xmath110 amplifier before being pulse - height discriminated and recorded in an ortec t914  @xcite multiscaler that is divided into 9625 bins .",
    "individual neutron counts are accumulated in a single multiscaler bin for a preset length of time , @xmath111 , until an external oscillator signals the multiscaler to advance to the next bin .",
    "the data are thus stored as histograms representing the number of scaler counts versus the neutron time of flight .",
    "when the last tof bin has been reached , the multiscaler returns to the first bin and waits for the next beam burst , which is preceded by a start signal from the proton storage ring .",
    "the same start signal triggers a countdown scaler set at 2400 .",
    "new counts in each tof bin are accumulated on top of those from the previous beam burst until the countdown scaler reaches zero . at this time data acquisition",
    "is halted , and the data stored in the multiscaler is written to disk .",
    "this process requires approximately one minute , during which the translation table for the target and empty cells is moved to the next position .",
    "the countdown scaler is reset to 2400 , the multiscaler is cleared , and data acquisition recommences only after the multiscaler is finished writing to disk and the position transducer indicates that the translation table is in the correct position .",
    "each target - in , target - out cycle comprises one run .",
    "the multiscaler is read into camac through a kinetic systems model 3344 serial line communication interface .",
    "the data - acquisition is based in vme , with online sorting handled on an hp - workstation by the xsys data - acquisition package , as developed at iucf @xcite .",
    "in this section we describe the details of the measurement strategy , the data analysis , and the results .",
    "the following method , which is a slight modification of the technique outlined earlier ( defined by equation  [ eq : polvratio ] ) , was used to measure the neutron polarization .",
    "both a target cell and a reference cell were placed on a translating table .",
    "transmission through the target cell ( polarized and unpolarized ) was normalized by the transmission through the unpolarized reference cell .",
    "the relative normalization was measured every six minutes , thus reducing the effects of time - dependent drifts in the properties of various parts of the system to negligible levels .    to determine the neutron beam polarization",
    ", we first obtained the ratio of the transmissions through the * unpolarized * target cell ( @xmath112 ) and the reference cell ( @xmath113 ) : @xmath114 the factor @xmath115 is energy dependent , and dominated by the differences in the @xmath1he and window thicknesses for the two cells .",
    "we then polarized the target cell , and obtained the ratio of the transmissions through the target cell while * polarized * , @xmath116 , and the reference cell ( always unpolarized ) , @xmath117 . from equation  [ eq : trans2 ]",
    "we obtain the ratio of these transmissions @xmath118 the values of both @xmath115 and @xmath119 depend upon the neutron energy . as long as the properties of the reference cell are static ( _ i.e. _",
    ", constant @xmath1he density ) , @xmath120 and we can take the ratio of equations  [ eq : norm1 ] and [ eq : norm2 ] to get the ratio @xmath121 needed in equation [ eq : polvratio ] for extracting the neutron polarization : @xmath122 we thereby determine the argument , @xmath123 , that can be substituted into equation  [ eq : pol1 ] to obtain beam polarization , @xmath124 .",
    "none of the individual parameters in the argument need be known .",
    "figure  [ fig : enhance ] shows the transmission enhancement caused by @xmath0he polarization as a function of neutron energy .",
    "the neutron energy is determined by tof , which for nonrelativistic neutrons is inversely proportional to the square - root of the neutron energy . for optimal resolution a long flight path and fine time binning are important .",
    "for this reason , and also to avoid a number of systematic effects associated with non - forward neutron scattering from the @xmath1he target , the neutron detector is located approximately 60  m away from the neutron source and more than 50  m from the @xmath0he target .",
    "calibration of the tof in terms of neutron energy is determined by installing thin films of @xmath125u and natural ir into the beam .",
    "these nuclei possess neutron resonances whose absolute energies are known to 0.1% or better ( see table  [ tab : tofresults ] ) .",
    "using the fitxs routine mentioned earlier , the centroid channel number of each of these resonances was extracted and correlated with the resonance energy .",
    "fitxs takes into account details of the beamline geometry and moderator properties including the emission time distribution of the neutrons from the moderator as a function of tof .",
    ".resonant nuclei used for the neutron time - of- flight energy calibration .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : polarization ]    in table  [ tab : polarization ] we show a list of systematic effects from various sources for the target conditions in our experiment .",
    "we have included all known effects which modify the transmission expression by at least 0.01% in the energy range of our measurement .",
    "the largest systematic effect is due to the slowly rising @xmath1he polarization , an effect which may be made negligible if more time is available for ramping up the @xmath1he polarization .",
    "otherwise , deadtime / pileup corrections , detector backgrounds and energy calibration give the largest effects , which are at the 0.02% level .",
    "these effects are plotted as a function of neutron energy in figure  [ fig : error ] .",
    "for this reason we are confident that it is possible to improve the absolute accuracy of this technique to the 0.02% level .",
    "one question that arises is whether or not all of the techniques described in this measurement can be extrapolated to the lower neutron energies of interest in fundamental physics experiments .",
    "for example , it becomes impractical to calibrate the neutron tof spectrum by transmission through neutron resonances with absolutely known resonance energies , since such resonances broaden and disappear as one approaches neutron threshold .",
    "one alternative to this procedure which is well - suited to a transmission measurement is to use the sharp change in transmission through polycrystalline solids at neutron energies corresponding to bragg scattering conditions .",
    "the discontinuity in the total cross section for neutron energies above and below the bragg condition is clearly visible in a neutron tof transmission spectrum and occurs at a well - defined neutron energy .",
    "in addition , the pulse height resolution of the @xmath0he scintillator detector will worsen as the low energy neutrons are absorbed close to the detector wall and the reaction products do not deposit the full energy of the reaction into the gas .",
    "the neutron detector efficiency then develops an energy dependence which is influenced directly by the detector geometry .",
    "this problem can be avoided by using a detector not based on absorption in helium gas .",
    "the sensitivity of the detector to gamma backgrounds must then be assessed .",
    "finally , in many cases it may not be practical to locate the transmission detector so far from the polarized target . in this case",
    "all of the systematic effects not important for our geometry must be evaluated in detail to judge the limit to absolute accuracy .",
    "using a laser - polarized @xmath1he spin filter we have measured the absolute neutron beam polarization from 40 mev to 10 ev with an absolute accuracy of 0.3% , where 0.2% is from counting statistics , and 0.1% is the systematic error .",
    "the measurement was performed with @xmath1he polarized to about 20% with the rb - spin exchange method .",
    "we have demonstrated that the simplicity of the mechanism of neutron polarization in polarized @xmath1he gas allows for a new and reliable way of measuring and monitoring on - line the absolute polarization of a low energy neutron beam to better than 0.1% .",
    "the use of @xmath1he spin filters to measure and monitor the beam polarization does not require a spin flipper or analyzer .",
    "it depends only upon the well defined relationship for neutron transmission through polarized @xmath1he gas .",
    "the @xmath1he filter provides a possibility for continuous online measurement and control of the neutron polarization .",
    "the extension of the technique to lower neutron energies is straightforward .",
    "in addition to the fundamental neutron physics applications , the development of neutron polarizers and analyzers based on @xmath1he spin filters is important for neutron scattering .",
    "neutron scattering studies in the thermal and epithermal energy range have suffered for years from a lack of a convenient source of polarized neutrons . with a @xmath1he spin filter",
    "the useful range can be expanded to epithermal neutron wavelengths .",
    "one of the advantages of the @xmath1he spin filter is its simplified experimental configuration .",
    "one does not require any major modifications to the beamline for a beam polarization measurement to be made .",
    "compact configurations are possible because there will be no gamma production and the @xmath1he filter has a large acceptance angle , allowing the filter and experiment to be mounted close to the source .",
    "the accurate absolute measurement described in this work demonstrates that the simple relations between the polarized target parameters and the neutron transmission and polarization are satisfied to high accuracy in practical polarized @xmath0he devices .",
