    "quantum degenerate bose gases in double - well potentials exhibit coherent macroscopic tunneling dynamics , analogous to those in superconducting josephson junctions @xcite .",
    "the observer can detect individual well populations by direct optical absorption imaging , and can infer the relative phase of the wave packets from interference experiments @xcite . furthermore , atomic interactions can be tuned over a wide range by adjusting particle number and double - well parameters or by means of feshbach resonances ( cf .",
    "@xcite for a review ) .",
    "double - well systems are often modeled within a two - mode approximation by the bose - hubbard hamiltonian .",
    "the parameters of the model are the number @xmath2 of atoms , the interaction energy @xmath3 for a pair of particles in the same potential well , and the tunneling coupling energy @xmath4 ( cf .",
    "@xcite , which use the same notation ) .",
    "one distinguishes the  rabi \" ,  josephson \" , and  fock \" regimes @xcite according to the relations @xmath5 recent experiments making use of strong interactions deep in the josephson regime have accomplished squeezing and macroscopic entanglement @xcite . on the other hand , coherent tunneling dynamics and bloch oscillations",
    "have been realized in completely non - interacting bose gases @xcite .",
    "the intermediate regime of moderate interactions ( the josephson - rabi boundary regime ) is virtually unexplored in experiment .",
    "this regime , where @xmath6 , is of particular interest , as it contains most of the stationary josephson modes , such as @xmath7 and @xmath8 phase modes , and the onset of macroscopic quantum self trapping @xcite . here",
    ", number and phase fluctuations are sensitive to the ratio of @xmath9 to @xmath10 , both in the ground state @xcite and , as we shall see , in thermal equilibrium at higher temperatures .",
    "when a gas of ultracold bosons is released from a double - well potential trap and recombined in free expansion , interference fringes , analagous to those of young s double - slit experiment , are observed in the atomic density .",
    "this does not necessarily mean that the double - well system was prepared in a coherent state , for individual images or  shots \" will feature interference fringes _ even if the gases are initally independent _ @xcite . to ascertain that the experimental procedure prepares the system in a coherent state , one needs to repeat the experiment many times and compare the results .",
    "if the fringes always lie in the same position , one may infer that the state is coherent , and ascribe a definite value to the relative phase between the condensates in the two wells .",
    "the decohering effect of temperature is seen in the fluctuations , from one shot to another , of the location of the interference fringes .",
    "these fluctuations reduce the visibility of the interference fringes when the density profiles are averaged .",
    "the fringe contrast in the average density profile is called the  coherence factor \" and , for double - well systems in the josephson regime , is found to be a certain function of @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "this function is used to calibrate the  thermometer \" of noise thermometry @xcite .    in this article",
    "we study canonical thermal equilibrium states of @xmath2 bosons in double - well and multi - well potentials , focusing on regimes where both @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "this includes the rabi - josephson boundary regime , provided the temperature is high enough that @xmath12 .",
    "we find that the coherence factor is sensitive to the ratios @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "our results are rigorous inasmuch as they are derived from a general theorem about canonical statistics of @xmath0-mode boson models @xcite .",
    "the regimes we consider are not normally attained in atom interferometry experiments .",
    "for example , the noise thermometry experiments reported in @xcite involved trapping a few thousand @xmath16 atoms at @xmath17-@xmath18 nk .",
    "the parameter @xmath19 ranged between about @xmath20 and @xmath21 , but the parameter @xmath15 was large because the experiments were performed deep within the josephson regime .",
    "however , it should be possible to engineer bosonic josephson junctions in the rabi - josephson boundary regime by taking advantage of feshbach resonances to reduce the interaction parameter @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ applications section ]",
    "we state our main results and proposals concerning noise thermometry of @xmath22-site bosonic josephson junctions . in section  [ m - site section ]",
    "we state the central result of this article , theorem  [ specifictheorem ] , a general result concerning canonical statistics of @xmath0-site bose - hubbard models .",
    "we return to the particular case @xmath23 in section  [ 2-site section ] and discuss the fluctuations of density observables such as interference fringes in time - of - flight matter wave interferometry .",
    "we outline a proof of theorem  [ specifictheorem ] in the appendix .",
    "double - well systems may be modeled using a two - mode approximation @xcite . in a symmetric two - well potential , the ground state is degenerate",
    "when the wells are separated by an infinitely high barrier : the _ gerade _ and _ ungerade _ modes have the same energy . if the barrier between the wells is finite , tunneling lifts the ground state degeneracy . provided",
    "the tunneling barrier is not _",
    "too _ low , the energy splitting of these low energy modes is small compared to the energy difference between them and the higher excited states , and , at low enough temperatures , there are effectively only two modes in play .",
    "two - mode approximations have been derived using either a  semiclassical \" or  second - quantized \" approach .",
    "the former approach attempts to constrain the semiclassical gross - pitaevskii dynamics to a two - dimensional subspace @xcite .",
    "the latter approach begins with the second quantized hamiltonian , and attempts to restrict it to one involving only two modes @xcite , which might be the lowest energy solutions of the gross - pitaevskii equation @xcite , or which might be found by self - consistent variational minimization of the energy over all suitable two mode approximations @xcite .",
    "the relationship between the second - quantized and the semiclassical theories is discussed in @xcite .",
    "two - mode models become quite sophisticated @xcite .",
    "the simplest one is the 2-site bose - hubbard model , whose hamiltonian is @xmath24 in this formula , the operators @xmath25 and @xmath26 are understood to operate on the @xmath27-particle component of the boson fock space .",
    "the observable @xmath28 is the relative number imbalance between the wells .",
    "the observable @xmath29 is the relative occupation difference of the _ gerade _ and _ ungerade _ modes , which is related to relative phase .",
    "canonical thermal equilibrium states of the @xmath22-site bose - hubbard hamiltonian can be approximated by certain mixtures of coherent states .",
    "we shall show that this approximation is rigorously justified for regimes where @xmath12 and @xmath13 ( and @xmath27 is large ) .",

    "the expected value of the population imbalance @xmath41 is zero , i.e. , @xmath42 .",
    "we will show that the variance of @xmath28 is @xmath43    in figures 1 and 2 , @xmath32 and @xmath44 are plotted against @xmath11 on a logarithmic scale , for various values of @xmath45     vs. temperature for several values of @xmath46 ( logarithmic scale ) . ]     vs. temperature for various values of @xmath46 .",

    "this method is suitable for the josephson regime @xmath48 , where the parameter @xmath49 is formally equal to @xmath50 .    to perform noise thermometry in the rabi - josephson boundary regime , where @xmath51 , one needs to know both @xmath11 and @xmath49 .",
    "estimates of @xmath11 and @xmath49 can be deduced from statistical estimates of the coherence factor @xmath32 and the variance @xmath52 of the number fluctuations , thanks to formulas ( [ formula for coherence factor ] ) and ( [ formula for z^2 ] ) .",
    "there are a couple of benefits of doing noise thermometry in the rabi - josephson boundary regime :    1.when a bosonic josephson junction is fashioned in the laboratory , one usually has more accurate knowledge of the parameter @xmath3 than the parameter @xmath4 ( the tunneling energy @xmath4 is quite difficult to estimate , due to its exponential sensitivity to the precise geometry of the double - well potential ) . by performing noise thermometry in the rabi - josephson boundary regime",
    ", one can take advantage of one s knowledge of @xmath3 to estimate @xmath4 as well as @xmath47 .",
    "2.if one does happen to know @xmath4 with some accuracy , one obtains _ two _ estimates of the temperature . if these estimates differ significantly , it may be evidence that the experimental procedure has failed to prepare the double - well system in a canonical thermal equilibrium state .",
    "the assumption that replication of the experiment is sampling from the canonical ensemble ought to be tested , because some ways of preparing the system can fix it in a non - canonical equilbrium state , for example , if the double - well is formed by ramping up a potential barrier too quickly @xcite .",
