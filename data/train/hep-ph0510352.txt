    "the properties of perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) at high energy and/or density presently receive much attention . on phenomenological grounds",
    "this domain is interesting both for deep inelastic scattering at hera and hard scattering at the tevatron and lhc , and for heavy - ion collisions with an initially large density of partons , e.g.  at rhic and lhc . on theoretical grounds",
    "the high energy and density domain is a challenge , since it implies a resummation of logarithms in the perturbative expansion at all orders of the strong coupling constant .",
    "this resummation goes beyond the one at the origin of the linear evolution equation in rapidity @xmath0 known as the balitsky ",
    "fadin  kuraev",
    " lipatov ( bfkl ) equation @xcite .",
    "it implies non - linear terms which describe the damping of the scattering amplitudes due to the high density of partons ( mainly gluons ) produced during the evolution .",
    "this leads to a transition to _ saturation _",
    "@xcite where a new state of qcd matter , the `` color glass condensate '' ( cgc ) is expected to appear @xcite .",
    "indeed , the cgc is proposed as the initial state formed in heavy ion collisions at high energy @xcite .    in its mean - field version , the qcd evolution towards saturation",
    "is described by the balitsky ",
    "kovchegov ( bk ) nonlinear equation @xcite . in the color dipole picture of qcd @xcite",
    ", it governs the energy dependence of the onium ",
    "target amplitude , where the target is supposed to be interacting independently with each dipole resulting from the evolution of the onium wave function with energy . in parton language , and neglecting impact parameter dependence , the bk equation describes the rapidity @xmath0 evolution of the `` unintegrated gluon distribution '' , i.e.   the distribution of gluon transverse momenta @xmath1 in the target .",
    "an interesting set of results on this distribution during the transition to saturation have already been obtained from the mathematical properties of the bk equation .",
    "indeed , analytic asymptotic solutions of the non - linear equation have been found @xcite in terms of traveling waves , i.e.   scaling solutions @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath0 play the rle of space and time , respectively .",
    "in fact , the traveling wave pattern of the solutions of the bk equation , which is already present at pre - asymptotic energies @xcite , reflects the earlier proposed @xcite `` geometric scaling '' of the @xmath4 cross section .",
    "the saturation scale @xmath5 is directly related to the movement in time of the traveling wave and in fact @xmath6 @xmath7 is nothing else than the speed of the wave which reaches a universal critical value at high energies , depending only on the kernel @xcite .",
    "hence , in physical terms the gluon transverse momenta propagate with rapidity towards higher and higher values , i.e.   to the _ ultraviolet _ , the typical transverse momentum scale being the saturation scale @xmath8 this is the key property of the transition to saturation .",
    "in fact the `` final '' result of this evolution  the color glass condensate  is supposed to be a fully saturated state where all gluons have a momentum equal to ( or possibly larger than ) the saturation scale characterizing the medium . however , in the rapidity evolution from an onium ",
    "target scattering , this `` final '' state is not expected to occur easily at finite energy for the whole system . on the other hand , heavy ion collisions at high energies could ,",
    "due to the high initial density of partons , be a good candidate for the physical occurrence of the cgc @xcite in the early stages of the collision .",
    "however , it is known that difficulties occur in reconciling this appealing scenario with the rapid thermalization which seems to occur in the next stages of the process",
    ". more precisely the mechanisms by which the original cgc , being inherently perturbative , feeds the low momentum region @xcite are currently under scrutiny @xcite . hence , this asks the question of the propagation towards the _ infrared _ , when one starts with an initial state with a lower transverse momentum limit , or at least characterized by a typical high transverse momentum , as is the case for the cgc . this propagation has been considered from the point of view of a bottom - up mechanism @xcite , possibly helped by plasma instabilities @xcite .",
    "however , it is worth considering the effect of energy evolution upon this type of dense initial phase already in the initial stage of the collision .",
    "this is our physical motivation for looking at the properties of the bk equation from a new point of view , the bk equation being considered as a prototype for non - linear perturbative qcd evolution .",
    "we expect most of our results to be valid also for more complete nonlinear evolution equations . in the present paper",
    "we essentially stick to the relevant mathematical properties of the bk evolution , leaving a more detailed analysis of the physics of heavy - ion collisions for the future .",
    "we will thus discuss how the bk equation gives information on the propagation with energy of gluon momenta towards the _ ultraviolet _ and the _ infrared _ ; namely , how the gluon momentum distribution evolves towards larger and smaller momenta , respectively , when starting with appropriate initial conditions .",
    "we will consider initial conditions with a `` sharp '' cut - off , either ultraviolet or infrared ( see fig.1 ) , but the mathematical universality properties of traveling wave solutions will allow much more general initial conditions , provided the initial fronts are steep enough .",
    "the plan of our paper is the following . in section [ newi ]",
    "we recall the bk equation in transverse momentum space . in section [ newii ]",
    ", we discuss the propagation of momenta towards the ultraviolet ( i.e.   large gluon momenta ) and show that we recover the same traveling wave solutions and scaling properties as for the solution of the bk equation for the physical amplitude . in section [ newiii ] , using appropriate initial conditions with an infrared cut - off , we derive a new type of scaling solutions of the bk equation for the propagation towards the infrared ( i.e.   towards small gluon momenta ) . in section [ newiv ]",
    "we solve the same equations numerically , confirming the analytical predictions and study in detail the solutions .",
    "conclusions on the propagation properties of the bk equation and its possible relevance for the cgc and the initial stage of the thermalization process are discussed in section [ conclusions ] .",
    "the bk equation for the onium  target s - matrix in position space reads ( x_01,y ) = d^2x_2  k(x_0,x_1;x_2 )   \\{s(x_02,y ) s(x_12,y)- s(x_01,y ) }  , equation where ( x_0,x_1;x_2 ) =   kernel is the bfkl kernel @xcite .",
    "( [ equation ] ) is the impact - parameter independent form of the bk equation , which is what we consider in this work .",
    "@xmath9 is the qcd coupling constant , @xmath10 are the endpoint coordinates of the qcd dipoles in two - dimensional transverse space , and @xmath11 . to obtain the equation for the amplitude , perform the replacement @xmath12 to get ( x_01,y ) = d^2x_2   k(x_0,x_1;x_2 )   \\ { n(x_02,y ) + ( x_12,y)-(x_01,y)-(x_02,y ) n(x_12,y)}. 1-equation again assuming impact - parameter independence , it is well - known @xcite that the fourier transformation to momentum space leads to a rather simple form of the evolution equation which is suitable for the derivation of useful analytical properties @xcite .",

    "@xmath18 can be related to the unintegrated gluon distribution of the target , and thus gives a direct information on the distribution of transverse momenta of the gluons probed in the target when the total rapidity is @xmath19    the equation ( [ 1-equation ] ) then takes the form = bk_in_k where the kernel @xmath20 is the integral kernel of the bfkl equation in momentum space .",
    "it acts on the gluon distribution as k ( k , y ) = _ 0^ .",
    "integral    a comment useful for the further analysis is in order .",
    "it appears easier to discuss the propagation towards the _ ultraviolet _ and the _ infrared _ using formulas ( [ bk_in_k],[integral ] ) in terms of gluon momenta .",
    "indeed , this is the formulation for which the mathematical results in terms of traveling waves @xcite are better known .",
    "however , the universality properties of the traveling wave regime in momentum space are expected to be valid in position space too .",
    "hence , the propagation of momenta towards the ultraviolet ( infrared ) will correspond to the evolution of qcd dipoles towards smaller ( larger ) sizes .",
    "the mathematical argument for this statement is , briefly , that it is easy to realize ( e.g.  by means of a mellin transform @xcite ) , that the linear part of the equation is symmetric by fourier transform , interchanging @xmath21 with @xmath22 in eq.([integral ] ) .",
    "it is then known from general mathematical properties @xcite , that the traveling wave regime does not depend of the form of the non - linear term even if modified by fourier transformation .",
    "let us first consider the problem of the propagation of the distribution of momenta towards the ultraviolet , in an `` universal way '' , that is in a way independent of the precise physical structure of the target . in order to formulate the problem , we want to consider initial conditions defined only by a sufficiently sharp _ ultraviolet _ cut - off . in fact , interestingly enough , we will see that the resulting traveling wave pattern is independent of the initial cut - off profile .",
    "we start with a simple choice of initial condition , namely a @xmath23-function .",
    "as we shall see , the asymptotic solution is the same for any other initial distribution with a sharp enough cut - off . ] .",
    "hence we choose ( k , y_0 ) = ( -l ) boundaryk1 where @xmath24 with @xmath25 being the initial ultraviolet cut - off .",
    "the notation @xmath26 is now for the solution of the bk equation starting from the @xmath23 cut - off ( [ boundaryk1 ] ) .",
    "when the rapidity increases , the transverse momenta of the gluon distribution evolve towards larger and larger @xmath1 .",
    "as we shall see , the solution takes the form of a traveling wave , the same that was found @xcite for the physical amplitude @xmath18 itself .",
    "the wave front defines a critical region in @xmath1 moving forward with rapidity .",
    "let us sketch the arguments in the present case of an initial @xmath23-function .",
    "one introduces the mellin transform with respect to the variable @xmath27 in the long - range tail of the distribution , where @xmath28 , the non - linear term in ( [ bk_in_k ] ) will remain small when evolving in @xmath0 and can at first be neglected .",
    "the solution of the linear part will thus remain valid .",
    "the solution is written ( k , y ) ~_c  e^-l+ ( ) ( y - y_0 )  , 2-equation where @xmath29 \\label{chi}\\ ] ] is the mellin transform of the kernel ) of the mellin - transform one may see that it is symmetric in the fourier transform from momentum to position space , allowing to extend to the latter the traveling wave properties of the former , as quoted in section [ newi ] . ] and the prefactor @xmath30 comes from the initial @xmath23-function condition ( [ boundaryk1 ] ) .",
    "we are expecting a wave front and thus search for a specific velocity @xmath31 characterizing its forward motion .",
    "hence we define a comoving frame following the ultraviolet front and defined by the shift @xmath32 a priori , no special velocity @xmath31 is selected , since for each value of @xmath33 one has a velocity @xmath34 which stabilizes the value of @xmath35 however , it can be shown from general grounds @xcite that , once the non - linearities are properly taken into account , and provided the initial conditions are steep enough in @xmath36 a critical velocity @xmath37 is selected , in analogy with the group velocity in wave physics @xcite . here @xmath38 is the critical anomalous dimension identical to that found for the bk equation @xcite .",
    "in fact the only condition @xcite on the initial boundary dependence is @xmath39 this can also be inferred from analyticity properties of the integrand of eq .",
    "( [ 2-equation ] ) in mellin space @xcite , where the point is to check that the position of the prefactor pole @xmath40 is situated to the left ( in @xmath41 ) of the critical point @xmath42 .",
    "this ensures that the overall behavior will be driven by the critical slope @xmath43 and not by the one corresponding to the initial condition .",
    "these conclusions have been tested numerically in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "indeed , the argument is essentially the same as for the transition matrix element , even if the initial condition is different . recall that in that case , the initial conditions are dictated by the perturbative qcd property of `` color transparency '' @xmath44 at large @xmath1 ( i.e.   color transparency , in terms of dipoles ) . in mathematical terms , all solutions verifying a sharp enough cut - off @xmath45 lie in the same `` universality class '' and thus follow the same traveling wave pattern at high enough rapidity .",
    "for instance , both the physical amplitude @xmath14 and the solution @xmath26 with @xmath23-function initial condition lie in this `` universality class ''",
    ". hence a unifying description of `` propagation towards the ultraviolet '' is correctly defined .",
    "we shall discuss the `` propagation towards the infrared '' within the same context in the next section [ newiii ] .",
    "there exists a critical value @xmath46 which characterizes the position of the moving wave front @xmath26 of momenta propagating towards the ultraviolet .",
    "the value of @xmath47 is defined as the value of @xmath1 , at a specified @xmath0 , where the distribution @xmath26 has a fixed ( and , for consistency , small ) constant value .",
    "since this is also the region where these distributions vary significantly with @xmath36 see fig .",
    "[ fig : fkpp ] , @xmath47 represents the most probable domain value for momenta as a function of @xmath19 on general grounds , one finds @xmath48 where @xmath43 and @xmath49 are given by the solution of the equation ( [ frontvelocity ] ) .",
    "the correction @xmath50 is a universal retardation effect due to the non - linearities .",
    "there exists also a third @xmath51 sub - asymptotic universal term in the exponential @xcite which we neglect for our purposes .",
    "we also leave for further study the interesting question of pre - asymptotics and early scaling @xcite .",
    "together with the front velocity @xmath52 it is possible to obtain some general knowledge of the front profile in the region next to the tail , including information on the diffusive approach to the scaling curve .",
    "this means that the gluon momenta do not reach instantaneously the scaling behavior of the traveling wave .",
    "there is a kind of diffusive retardation effect , violating geometric scaling .",
    "one finds @xmath53    a physically important remark follows from the identification of the traveling wave characteristics of general ultraviolet evolution with the amplitude @xmath14 with perturbative initial conditions .",
    "it means that the dynamics are dominated by gluon momenta of order of the saturation scale rather independently of the ultraviolet cut - off profile ( if sharp enough ) .",
    "in other terms , the propagation towards the ultraviolet is essentially determined by the evolution of the saturation scale .",
    "these gluons are expected to eventually build the cgc phase .",
    "let us imagine that at @xmath54 instead of the boundary condition ( [ boundaryk1 ] ) , one starts with boundary conditions for another solution @xmath55 of the bk equation , that describes an initial distribution of gluons with a low momentum cut - off @xmath25 , see in , e.g. , fig .",

    "[ travel ] . as in the previous case",

    "due to the universality properties , these limitations are expected to play no important rle for our conclusions . ]",
    "@xmath23-function condition , but our results will be valid for the whole class of initial conditions lying in the same `` universality class '' of sharp enough infrared cut - offs , to be defined with precision later on .",
    "we start with the initial condition given by ( k , y_0 ) = ( + l ) , boundaryk2 where @xmath56 denotes the corresponding solution of the bk evolution equation",
    ". we will now demonstrate that under very general conditions such an initial condition leads to a gluon distribution that propagates rapidly `` backwards '' , i.e.   towards the infrared .",
    "however , a special treatment is needed for the bfkl kernel given by ( [ kernel ] ) in momentum space or ( [ chi ] ) in mellin space .",
    "the critical value of the speed of the traveling wave is obtained from the equation @xmath57 , an equation that has one finite and one infinite solution when @xmath58 is the leading logarithmic ( ll ) bfkl kernel .",

    "[ kernelplots](a ) .",
    "the infinite value ( formally for @xmath61 ) is the indication of an infrared instability of the propagation which is to be regularized , as will become clear later on .",
    "the analysis of the asymptotic solutions of @xmath62 requires a particular treatment in this case .",
    "let us proceed in steps and first go back to the original diffusive approximation of the bk equation where known mathematical properties are useful to address our problem .",
    "this approximation of the ll bfkl kernel , considered in ref .",
    "@xcite , consists in expanding the kernel around @xmath63 and keeping terms up to second order , ( ) ( ) + ^ ( ) ( - ) + ^ ( ) ( -)^2 ( ) .",
    "diffusive this brings @xcite the bk equation into the form of the fisher  kolmogorov  petrovsky  piscounov equation @xcite . in this kernel",
    "there are no poles and the equation for @xmath59 has two solutions , one ( @xmath64 ) with positive , the other ( @xmath65 ) with negative value @xmath66 of the speed , see fig .",

    "the positive value yields the same forward traveling waves propagating with speed @xmath31 discussed in the previous section .",

    "it is well - known that the ll bfkl kernel is well - approximated by a two - pole model , @xmath79 , which reproduces the poles of the bfkl kernel .",
    "this kernel has also been studied in ref .",

    "this kernel can be viewed as an approximation of some next - to - leading effects , and is also simple enough to use in our reasoning .",

    "[ kernelplots](a ) .",
    "bfklplots    we observe that traveling wave solutions are generated in the forward direction , while the backward direction is characterized by a fixed ( non - traveling ) scaling curve , obtained _ almost _ immediately in the rapidity evolution .",
    "moreover , the solution extends also immediately towards very negative values of @xmath91 i.e.   in the very far infrared .",
    "this is a clear sign of infrared instability of the evolution with the ll kernel .    in ll bfkl , hence , only forward traveling waves are present .",
    "the backward solution propagates instantly to high @xmath0 , and generates a fixed scaling solution . in a formal way",
    ", the speed gets infinite and the wave front is situated at @xmath92 .",

    "this is a feature related to the singularity of the canonical bfkl kernel at @xmath93 and , as we shall see now , is physically tamed by next - to - leading corrections .",
    "this sensitivity to next - to - leading qcd corrections is a specific and interesting feature of backward propagation towards the infrared .",

    "left - moving traveling waves appear , in agreement with the analytical predictions .",
    "in all cases the speed @xmath66 is larger than for the forward propagation ( i.e.  larger than the ordinary forward bk traveling waves ) .",
    "hence the infrared instability is made finite but the propagation towards the infrared is still much more rapid . in terms of qcd dipoles",
    ", one may say that dipoles with large sizes are easily produced during the energy evolution , in the `` universality class '' of backward propagation .",

    "[ twopolebfklfig ] ) we considered the backward waves obtained for the toy model and the forward waves for the original bfkl kernel .",

    "derivative - fig    the saturation scale @xmath47 is defined as the momentum , at a certain rapidity , where the amplitude reaches a particular value @xmath98 , i.e. , @xmath99 .",
    "the overall normalization therefore depends on the chosen value of @xmath98 and it is most convenient to study the logarithmic derivative of @xmath47 , where the normalization cancels .",
    "because the shape of the front is not completely fixed as it propagates in rapidity , the functional form of @xmath100 will also depend on @xmath98 , but this dependence is a subleading effect in @xmath0 and vanishes as @xmath0 becomes large .",

    "let us summarize the results obtained in our study of the gluon momentum propagation ( or equivalently , dipole size evolution ) during nonlinear qcd evolution at high density / energy :    \\(i ) the propagation of gluon momenta towards the ultraviolet and infrared with energy correspond to two different `` universality classes '' of solutions of the non - linear balitsky  kovchegov evolution equation .",
    "they are selected by the existence of an ultraviolet ( resp .",
    "infrared ) cut - off in the initial conditions but largely independent of the cut - off profile , if sharp enough .",
    "\\(ii ) the propagation towards the ultraviolet is characterized by asymptotic traveling wave solutions which are independent of the ( sharp enough ) initial distribution . in particular",
    ", they are the same as those exhibited by the onium - target amplitude with initial conditions defined by the qcd transparency property .",
    "hence , the rate of evolution towards the ultraviolet is universally governed by the saturation scale , generalizing the behavior of the bk dipole - target amplitude .",
    "\\(iii ) the propagation of sizes towards the infrared shows new and distinctive features which have not been discussed , to our knowledge , in the literature previously . in the case of the ll bfkl kernel ,",
    "i.e.   in the leading log approximation of perturbative qcd , one obtains a scaling distribution ( after a short diffusive interlude ) which extends almost immediately towards the far infrared region , revealing an infrared instability .",
    "this phenomenon is due to the singularity of the bfkl kernel at @xmath110    \\(iv ) as soon as this singularity is shifted or smoothed out , new traveling wave solutions appear , with a ( large ) speed of backward propagation towards the infrared",

    "our findings of the new traveling wave pattern towards the infrared within a purely perturbative evolution framework could have sizable physical implications .",
    "an example we have in mind is the problem of thermalization of a color glass condensate formed in the first stages of a heavy - ion collision .",
    "indeed , it is well known that it is not easy to reconcile the formation of a perturbative cgc ( at weak coupling ) as an initial compound state in a heavy ion collision , with the hydrodynamic features of the final state which probably require a fast thermalization or , at least , a rapid decrease of the mean free path in the medium .",
    "we think that a discussion of this mechanism would be interesting for the discussion of thermalization of an initial color glass condensate phase during a heavy ion collision process .    as a further outlook",
    ", it will also be worth examining the effect of the growth of the coupling constant during the propagation towards the infrared .",
    "our present results have been obtained for simplicity assuming a fixed value of the coupling constant .",
    "they will have a natural extension to running coupling , using the method of ref .",

    "it is nowadays emphasized @xcite that fluctuations could modify the saturation solutions , violate geometric scaling or even exert a back - reaction onto the linear regime . what we obtain from our analysis of the `` universality class '' of propagation towards the ultraviolet will probably survive the implication of fluctuations .",
    "even more interesting is the investigation of fluctuation effects on the infrared propagation",
    ". this will be the subject of forthcoming studies .",
    "properties borrowed from statistical physics could help in attacking this problem with new tools .",

    "<S> using the balitsky  kovchegov ( bk ) equation as an explicit example , we show that nonlinear qcd evolution leads to an instability in the propagation toward the _ infrared _ of the gluon transverse momentum distribution , if one starts with a state with an infrared cut - off . </S>",
    "<S> this effect takes the mathematical form of rapidly moving traveling wave solutions of the bk equation , which we investigate by numerical simulations . </S>",
    "<S> these traveling wave solutions are different from those governing the transition to saturation , which propagate towards the _ ultraviolet_. the infrared wave speed , formally infinite for the leading order qcd kernel , is determined by higher order corrections . </S>",
    "<S> this mechanism could play a rle in the rapid decrease of the mean free path in the color glass condensate scenario for heavy ion collisions . </S>"
