    "in the galactic as well as cluster of galaxy scales , observations show that there are discrepancy between the observed dynamical mass and the mass inferred from the luminous matter in the structures  @xcite .",
    "one of solutions for interpretation of this observation is using the concept of missing mass of universe , so - called dark matter in the cosmology .",
    "the particles composing dark matter fluid interact with each other only gravitationally and they have possibly very weak interaction with the ordinary matter and themselves .",
    "no explicit signal of dark matter particle from the interaction with the ordinary matter is found yet @xcite .",
    "the other approach for the interpretation of observation is using the idea of modification of gravity law in order to replace it with the dynamical effect of missing mass .",
    "one of well known models is the modified newtonian dynamics ( mond ) where the newtonian dynamics changes in such a way that in the small accelerations produces a flat rotation curve for the spiral galaxies @xcite .",
    "this theory also is developed to relativistic version by @xcite .",
    "one of the challenging questions regarding mond and other modified gravity theories is the interpretation of gravitational lensing of systems like the bullet cluster @xcite and the large scale structure formation in the universe without using the dark matter component of the structures .",
    "another attempt to solve the missing mass problem with modifying the gravity - law has been introduced by @xcite with the non - local gravity ( nlg ) .",
    "this theory is the extension of non - local special relativity to the accelerating frames . in the newtonian limit of non - local gravity ,",
    "the effective gravitational potential is similar to a newtonian potential , in addition to an extra repulsive term similar to the yukawa force @xcite .",
    "this theory has been compared with the rotation curve of spiral galaxies as well as the temperature profile of hot gas in chandra database for the cluster of galaxies . with the fixed values for the parameters of this theory , the dynamics of spiral galaxies as well as the cluster of galaxies are consistence with the baryonic distribution of matter in these structures and",
    "there is no need to the dark matter @xcite .",
    "the other alternative theory to the dark matter is so - called modified gravity ( mog ) theory which is a covariant extension of general relativity . in this theory beside the tensor field as the generator of gravity there are additional scalar and vector fields @xcite .",
    "the important feature of this theory is the fifth force charge for each particle which is proportional to the inertial mass and it couples via a massive vector field .",
    "the geodesics of a test particle in this theory has an extra term similar to the lorentz force in the electrodynamics , coupling with the fifth force charge and the result is a deviation from the standard geodesic equation in general relativity . with this extra term in the weak field approximation ,",
    "a modified poisson equation is obtained where the solution of this equation for a point like mass results in a newtonian potential and a yukawa repulsive term .",
    "the comparison of the dynamics of spiral galaxies with things catalog results in universal values for the parameters of this model with reasonable fit to the rotation curve of galaxies and cluster of galaxies @xcite .",
    "one of interesting similarities between the non - local gravity and mog theories is that while these theories have completely different physical axioms , in the weak field approximation they behave almost similar .    to test the universality of parameters of modified gravity models in the intermediate scales ,",
    "we apply the effective potential of mog , non - local gravity as well as mond for interpreting data in dwarf galaxies of little things catalog .",
    "the observational data in this catalog are the density distribution of stars and gas of each galaxy as well as the dynamics in form of rotation curve of galaxy .",
    "in section ( [ mogfield ] ) , we review the alternative theories of gravity to compensate the dark matter as ( a ) modified gravity ( mog ) and the weak field approximation of this theory , ( b ) non - local gravity and the corresponding weak filed approximation and modified newtonian dynamics ( mond ) . in section ( [ rotcurve ] ) , we introduce the little things catalog and apply the results of weak field approximation of alternative models of gravity to the dwarf galaxies . in this section",
    "we obtain the best values for the parameters of gravity model and compare them with what has been obtained from the spiral galaxies and cluster of galaxies . in section ( [ conc ] ) for the conclusion , we discuss about the universality of parameters of modified gravity theories and possibility of having running parameters in these theories .",
    "one of the important questions in the cosmology is the missing mass of universe where the baryonic matter is not enough to interpret the dynamics of structures such as cluster of galaxies and spiral galaxies @xcite . beside using the concept of dark matter ,",
    "the alternative approach is the modification of gravity law in such a way that one can explain the dynamics of structures with only baryonic matter . in this section",
    "we introduce three models for the modification of gravity law . these models are ( a ) modified gravity ( mog ) which is introduced by @xcite and the weak field approximation obtained in @xcite , ( b ) non - local gravity ( nlg ) where the einstein equations in teleparallel form are similar to the maxwell equations , hence these equations are written in a non - local way @xcite and ( c ) modified newtonian dynamics ( mond ) where the newtonian dynamics is modified in the small accelerations @xcite .",
    "we use the metric signature convention @xmath5 .",
    "the general form of action for mog which also is called the scalar - tensor - vector - gravity ( stvg ) , is given by @xcite : @xmath6 where the first term is the standard einstein action @xmath7 and the second term ( i.e. @xmath8 ) and third term ( i.e. @xmath9 ) of action corresponds to the massive vector and scalar fields that are composed by the following terms : @xmath10\\sqrt{-g}~d^4x,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath11\\sqrt{-g}~d^4x , \\label{scalar}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is the covariant derivative with respect to the metric @xmath13 , the faraday tensor of the vector field is defined by @xmath14 , @xmath15 is a dimensionless coupling constant , @xmath16 is a scalar field representing the gravitational coupling strength and @xmath4 is a scalar field corresponding to the mass of the vector field . also @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the self - interaction potentials associated with the vector field and the scalar fields , respectively . here in our analysis",
    "we consider a simplified version of this action assuming that all the potentials set to zero and @xmath15 and @xmath4 fields as the constant parameters .    also the action for pressureless dust can be written as @xmath20 where assuming a point mass particle by replacing @xmath21 and varying this action results in the geodesic equation of @xmath22 where we assume that the fifth force charge is related to the inertial mass by @xmath23 and the right hand side of this equation is similar to the lorentz force in the electrodynamics .",
    "the only difference is that vector field in this action is massive , hence provides a short range interaction .    in the astrophysical scales we use the weak field approximation of this theory which has good agreement with the dynamics of spiral galaxies and cluster of galaxies @xcite . here ,",
    "we review the same procedure by expanding fields around the minkowski space - time in the action as follows : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the minkowski metric . for the vector field , we write @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the zeroth order and @xmath28 is the first order perturbation of the vector field . for the minkowski space - time , we set @xmath27 equal to zero which means that in the absence of matter there is no gravity source for the vector field @xmath29 .",
    "also we perturb the energy - momentum tensor about the minkowski background : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is zero .    by substituting the perturbation in the action and varying the action with respect to metric and ignoring the higher orders of perturbation",
    ", we get @xmath32 where the first term on the right - hand side of this equation represents the energy - momentum tensor of matter , and the second term corresponds to the energy - momentum tensor of the vector field given by @xmath33    in the weak field approximation , ignoring the higher order terms from the vector field in the energy momentum tensor , for @xmath34 component we have @xmath35 and substituting in equation ( [ ein1 ] ) results in @xmath36 varying action with respect to the vector fields , we have the following equation @xmath37 let us assume that the current of matter , @xmath38 is conserved , ( i.e. @xmath39 ) , which implies the constrain of @xmath40 in the weak field approximation .",
    "for the static case , this equation simplifies to @xmath41 which has the solution of @xmath42    in order to obtain the field equation for an effective potential in the weak field approximation , we use the geodesic equation of a test mass particle in equation ( [ em5 ] ) and in the weak field of gravitation we take the divergence of the spatial component form this equation , @xmath43 where @xmath44 represents the acceleration of the test particle .",
    "we substitute @xmath45 from ( [ effpois ] ) into ( [ p2 ] ) and define the effective potential for the test particle by , @xmath46 , and relate it to the distribution of matter as @xmath47 where by replacing the solution for @xmath48 from ( [ phi0 ] ) and substituting @xmath49 with @xmath50 , we derive the effective potential of @xmath51 where with redefinition of parameters we get the conventional form that derived in @xcite @xmath52 , \\label{mogphi}\\ ] ] and consequently the acceleration of a test particle is given by @xmath53~d^3x ' . \\label{mogacceleration}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the observational test of this theory with the spiral galaxies as well as the cluster of galaxies provides a unique values of @xmath54 and @xmath55 @xcite for these scales .      the lorentz covariance in the spacial relativity is valid for the inertial observes .",
    "the fundamental assumptions of transformation of physical laws between the non - accelerating observers and the accelerating observes is that , locally these two frames are equivalent .",
    "this is called the equivalence principle . however , for accelerating observers which are the real observers of the physical world , the lorentz covariance might not be valid .",
    "this extension is modelled with the introduction of non - locality in the accelerating frames and consequently in gravity .",
    "it has been argued that one must in general go beyond the locality hypothesis of standard special relativity theory and include the past history of an accelerated observer @xcite .",
    "the extension of non - locality to the general relativity is done by the averaging procedure where a kernel acts as the weight function for the gravitational memory of the past events . in the non - local gravity",
    ", it is assumed that deviation from the locality is proportional to @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the characteristic length of phenomenon and @xmath58 is the characteristic length that can be defined by the acceleration of the observer . in the case",
    "that @xmath59 , assuming that the locality is breakdown , we can not use the equivalence principle    the non - local gravity is formulated in a tetrad formalism .",
    "this field relates the space time metric to the minkowski space with @xmath60 . here",
    "the tetrad field has sixteen degrees of freedom .",
    "it is necessary to extend the riemannian structure of space - time by using the weitzenbck connection where @xmath61 where simplifying this equation results in @xmath62 .",
    "similar to the electromagnetic @xcite , we can define the field strength as follows @xmath63 we define another auxiliary field strength , a modified torsion tensor of @xmath64}+2e_{[\\mu}{}^{\\hat{\\alpha } } c_{\\nu]{\\hat{\\beta}}}{}^{\\hat{\\beta}}\\,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where by defining a tensor density of @xmath65 and @xmath66 , the einstein equation can be written in a simpler form of @xmath67}{}^{\\hat{\\alpha}}=0\\,,\\ ] ] @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the energy - momentum tensor of matter and @xmath70 is the energy momentum of tetrad field and similar to the energy momentum tensor of electromagnetic field , it is traceless .",
    "the advantage of teleparallel formalism of general relativity is that we can write the einstein equations in the form of maxwell equations in a non - vaccum media . here",
    "@xmath71 plays the role of electromagnetic filed tensor of @xmath72 ( i.e. @xmath73 ) , @xmath74 plays the role of displacement tensor of @xmath75 ( i.e. @xmath76 ) and finally @xmath77 plays the role of current in the electromagnetism ( i.e @xmath78 ) .",
    "it is well known that constitutive relation between @xmath72 and @xmath75 in the electrodynamics for a generic medium is non - local and this non - locality is expressed through a kernel in the integration .",
    "this idea is extended to the non - local relativity in a covariant form . in the weak field approximation by expanding the tetrad filed around @xmath79 , equation ( [ i5 ] )",

    "one of interesting approaches to answer the missing mass problem is the modified newtonian dynamics that was proposed by @xcite . in order to interpret the flat rotation curve of spiral galaxies",
    ", milgrom assumed that newtonian dynamics should be modified in such a way that restore the newtonian gravity at larger accelerations and is modified at low accelerations . in this theory",

    "an equivalent version of this theory is the modification of gravity law sourced by a single mass object as follows : @xmath107    in order to ensure a smooth transition between the two regimes between the newtonian gravity and mondian gravity , milgrom s law is written in the following form : @xmath108 where interpolating function satisfies the following constraints of @xmath109 for x @xmath110 1 and @xmath111 for x @xmath112 1 .",
