    "in a recent stimulating article with important implications for the use of finite basis sets , staroverov , scuseria , and davidson @xcite presented an exchange - only optimized effective potential ( xoep ) scheme that yields , for given finite gaussian orbital basis sets , ground state energies that surprisingly equal exactly the ground state hartree - fock ( hf ) energies for these basis sets .",
    "moreover , their xoep scheme not only yields one unique but an infinite number of exchange potentials and each of the latter leads to the corresponding ground state hf energy if used as the exchange potential in the corresponding exchange - only ks hamiltonian operator . on the other hand",
    ", it is known that in a complete basis set limit , which corresponds to a complete real space representation of all quantities , the xoep method is identical @xcite to the exact exchange - only kohn - sham method and yields ground state energies that always lie above @xcite the corresponding ground state hf energy .",
    "staroverov , scuseria , and davidson then state : `` our conclusions may appear paradoxical . for any finite basis set ,",
    "no matter how large , there exist infinitely many xoep s that deliver exactly the ground - state hf energy in that basis , however close it may be to the hf limit .",
    "nonetheless , in the complete basis set limit , the xoep is unique and e(xoep ) is above e(hf ) '' .",
    "( here e(xoep ) and e(hf ) denote the xoep and hf total energies , respectively , that are denoted @xmath0 and @xmath1 in this work . )",
    "furthermore they state : `` the non - uniqueness of oeps in a finite basis set raises doubt about their usefulness in practical applications ''    we here first show , by different means including a constrained - search one , that the above statement of staroverov , scuseria , and davidson , that it is always possible to construct optimized effective potentials that deliver exactly the ground state hf energy , holds if and only if the products of the orbital basis functions , or at least the products of the corresponding occupied and unoccupied hf orbitals from a given orbital basis set , form a linearly independent set .",
    "otherwise , the xoep scheme for finite orbital basis sets , in general , does not deliver exactly the ground state hf energy .",
    "secondly , we show that the xoep approach of staroverov , scuseria , and davidson , does not really represent an exchange - only ks method and does not yield physically meaningfull ks exchange potentials , even if the products of orbital basis functions are linearly independent . in order to get physically meaningfull ks exchange potentials via xoep schemes ,",
    "the latter have to be set up in a way that they represent ks methods , otherwise they are indeed of little usefulness in practical applications .",
    "however , if xoep schemes are set up properly then they are of great usefulness in practice as demonstrated , e.g. , by numerically stable plane - wave xoep procedures for solids @xcite .",
    "we start by briefly reconsidering the xoep approach of staroverov , scuseria , and davidson @xcite .",
    "the relevant hamiltonian operators are the hf hamiltonian operator @xmath2 and the exchange - only ks hamiltonian operator @xmath3 atomic units are used throughout . in eqs .",
    "( [ hf - hamiltonian ] ) and ( [ ks - hamiltonian ] ) , @xmath4 denotes the external potential , usually the electrostatic potential of the nuclei , @xmath5 is the hartree potential , i.e. , the coulomb potential of the electron density , @xmath6 is the local multiplicative ks exchange potential , @xmath7 the effective ks potential , and @xmath8 the nonlocal exchange operator with the kernel @xmath9 in a real space representation . here",
    "@xmath10 designates the first - order density matrix . in the hf - hamiltonian operator of eq.([hf - hamiltonian ] ) the first - order density matrix occuring in the nonlocal exchange operator of eq .",
    "( [ hf - kernel ] ) equals the hf first order density matrix @xmath11 and the nonlocal exchange operator subsequently equals the hf exchange operator . for simplicity",
    "we consider closed shell systems with non - degenerate ground states . in this case",
    "orbitals , first - order density matrices , and basis functions can all be chosen to be real - valued .",
    "next we introduce an orbital basis set @xmath12 of dimension @xmath13 .",
    "the representations of the hf- and exchange - only ks - hamiltonian operators in this basis set are @xmath14 and @xmath15 respectively .",
    "the matrices @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are defined by the corresponding matrix elements @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 , respectively , and by @xmath26 . because the orbital basis functions are real - valued all matrices are symmetric",
    "now we expand the ks exchange potential in an auxiliary basis set @xmath27 of dimension @xmath28 , i.e. , @xmath29 the auxiliary basis set , of course , shall be chosen such that its basis functions are linearly independent .",
    "the crucial question arising now is how many and what types of matrices @xmath20 representing the ks density - functional exchange potential can be constructed for a given auxiliary basis set @xmath27 .",
    "this question was answered in ref .",
    "firstly we consider the case when the @xmath30 different products @xmath31 of orbital basis functions are linearly independent . in this case , if @xmath32 and the auxiliary basis functions span the same space as the products of the orbital basis functions , then a symmetric matrix @xmath20 can be constructed in a unique way by determining appropriate expansion coefficients @xmath33 for the exchange potential .",
    "the reason is that the determination of the @xmath32 expansion coefficients @xmath33 for the construction of the @xmath32 different matrix elements of the symmetric matrix @xmath20 leads to a linear system of equations @xmath34 with @xmath35 for the coefficients @xmath33 of dimension @xmath32 that is nonsingular and thus has a unique solution @xcite . in eq .",
    "( [ equationforxcoefficients ] ) , @xmath36 is a @xmath37 matrix that contains the overlap matrix elements @xmath38 .",
    "the first index of @xmath36 , i.e. , @xmath39 , is a superindex refering to products of orbital basis functions while the second index , @xmath40 , refers to auxiliary basis functions .",
    "the vector @xmath41 collects the expansion coefficients of eq .",
    "( [ vx - aux ] ) for the exchange potential and the right hand side @xmath42 , a vector with superindices @xmath39 , contains the @xmath43 independent elements of an arbitrarily chosen matrix @xmath20 . if we chose @xmath20 to be equal to the matrix representation of an arbitrary nonlocal operator with respect to the orbital basis set then eqs .  ( [ vx - aux ] ) and ( [ equationforxcoefficients ] )",
    "define a local potential with the same matrix representation .",
    "this demonstrates that a distinction of local multiplicative and nonlocal operators is not clearly possible for orbital basis sets with linearly independent products of orbital basis functions .",
    "if @xmath44 and the space spanned by the auxiliary functions contains the space spanned by the product of orbital functions then @xcite an infinite number of sets of coefficients @xmath33 lead to any given symmetric matrix @xmath20 .",
    "the real space ks exchange potentials @xmath45 corresponding according to eq .",
    "( [ vx - aux ] ) to these sets of coefficients @xmath33 are all different but all represent local multiplicative potentials .",
    "next we construct ks hamiltonian operators ( [ ks - hamiltonian ] ) by adding these different ks exchange potentials to always the same external and hartree potential .",
    "the resulting effective ks potentials in real space , i.e. , the @xmath46 are all different . nevertheless the resulting basis set representations @xmath47 of the corresponding ks hamiltonian operators are all identical because the basis set representations @xmath48 of the different exchange potentials @xmath6 , by construction , are all identical . as a consequence the ks orbitals resulting from diagonalizing the ks hamiltonian matrix @xmath47 and subsequently also the resulting ground state electron densities are identical in all cases .",
    "we thus have a situation where different local multiplicative ks potentials @xmath46 lead to the same ground state electron density .",
    "this seems to constitute a violation of the hohenberg - kohn theorem .",
    "indeed it was shown in ref .",
    "[ ] and discussed in ref .",
    "[ ] that the hohenberg - kohn theorem does not hold for finite orbital basis sets in its original formulation , i.e. , that different local potentials , e.g. , local potentials obtained by different linear combinations of auxiliary basis funtions , must lead to different ks determinants and thus different ks electron densities . we will come back to this point later on . finally , if @xmath49 then not all symmetric matrices @xmath20 can be constructed from a local ks exchange potential given by an expansion ( [ vx - aux ] ) .    in their xoep approach staroverov , scuseria , and davidson @xcite can expand the ks exchange potential in @xmath32 auxiliary basis functions and determine the coefficients such that the resulting matrix @xmath48 exactly equals the hf exchange matrix @xmath19 .",
    "if additionally the ks hartree potential is set equal to the hf one then the resulting hf and ks hamiltonian operators are identical . subsequently also the hf and ks orbitals , the ground state electron densities , and the ground state energies are identical . because the hf and the ks electron densities turn out to be identical , the coulomb potential of this density can equally well be considered as a hf or a ks hartree potential .",
    "it follows immediately that the ks exchange potential constructed in this way is the xoep exchange potential : the hf total energy is the lowest total energy any slater determinant can yield .",
    "thus if a local multiplicative ks potential leads to this total energy it is clearly the optimized effective potential defined as the potential that yields the lowest total energy achievable by any local multiplicative ks potential .",
    "the xoep ground state energy resulting from this construction equals the corresponding hf energy .",
    "moreover by enlarging the number of auxiliary basis functions , resulting in @xmath44 , not only one optimized exchange potential leading to the hf energy but infinitely many can be constructed .",
    "staroverov , scuseria , and davidson obtained the hf energy in their xoep scheme even if the number of auxiliary functions only equaled the product @xmath50 of occupied and virtual orbitals @xcite . in this case a similarity transformation of the hf and the ks hamiltonian matrices and their constituents was carried out in order to obtain representations of all matrices with respect to the hf orbitals .",
    "then it is sufficient to chose the expansion coefficients of the ks exchange potential such that only the occupied - virtual block of the ks exchange matrix equals that of the hf exchange matrix .",
    "the resulting ks hamiltonian matrix then may differ from the hf hamiltonian matrix in the occupied - occupied and the virtual - virtual block but this merely leads to unitary transformations of the occupied and virtual orbitals among themselves and thus does not change the ground state energy or the electron density .",
    "indeed it is straightforward to show that the occupied - virtual block of the exchange matrix equals that of the hf exchange matrix if the products of occupied and unoccupied orbitals are linearly independent . to that end",
    "we consider the xoep equation determining the xoep exchange potential @xcite @xmath51 in eq .",
    "( [ exxb ] ) @xmath52 and @xmath53 denote occupied and unoccupied ks orbitals , respectively , with eigenvalues @xmath54 and @xmath55 . both sides of eq .",
    "( [ exxb ] ) are a linear combination of products @xmath56 of occupied and unoccupied ks orbitals with coefficients @xmath57 and @xmath58 , respectively . however , if the products @xmath56 are linearly independent then the two linear combinations can only be identical if the coefficients multiplying the products are all identical .",
    "this , however , requires that @xmath59 , i.e. , that the occupied - virtual block of the ks exchange matrix equals that of the corresponding exchange matrix of a nonlocal exchange operator of the form of the hf exchange operator .",
    "replacement of the ks exchange matrix by the matrix of the nonlocal exchange operator thus again leads only to a unitary transformation of the occupied and virtual orbitals among themselves .",
    "therefore the corresponding xoep determinant can also be interpreted as hf determinant .",
    "next we consider the crucial point what happens if the products of orbital basis functions @xmath31 are linearly dependent .",
    "then the rows of the matrix @xmath36 of eq.([equationforxcoefficients ] ) are linearly dependent , thus the rank of the matrix @xmath36 is lower than @xmath60 , and as consequence eq.([equationforxcoefficients ] ) , in general , has no solution .",
    "for an alternative argument , observe that for linear dependent products of orbital basis functions @xmath31 , there exists at least one linear combination of such products that equals zero @xmath61 in eq .",
    "( [ linear - dependence ] ) the @xmath62 denote the coefficients of that linear combination .",
    "the corresponding sum of matrix elements of @xmath48 also equals zero , i.e. , @xmath63 for any choice of expansion coefficients @xmath64 in eq .",
    "( [ vx - aux ] ) because the product of any local function and thus of any ks exchange potential @xmath6 with the sum ( [ linear - dependence ] ) equals zero .",
    "the products @xmath65 for two different arguments @xmath66 and @xmath67 , on the other hand , are always linearly independent because the orbital basis set @xmath12 has to be linearly independent",
    ". therefore the linear combination @xmath68 can not be identical to zero for all values of the arguments @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "then , however , also the integral of this linear combination with @xmath69 , i.e. , with the kernel of the nonlocal hf exchange operator , in general , is not equal to zero , i.e. , in general @xmath70 comparison of eqs .",
    "( [ zero - matrix - elements ] ) and ( [ zero - matrix - elementshf ] ) shows that , in general , the exchange matrices @xmath20 and @xmath19 are different no matter how the expansion coefficients @xmath33 of the ks exchange potential , eq .",
    "( [ vx - aux ] ) , are chosen .",
    "this demonstrates that , in general , neither the xoep scheme of staroverov , scuseria , and davidson @xcite nor any other leads to an xoep hamiltonian operator that equals the hf hamiltonian operator when the orbital basis products are linearly dependent .",
    "if we consider the version of staroverov , scuseria , and davidson s xoep scheme that refers only to the occupied - virtual block of the xoep and hf exchange matrices then by completely analogous arguments it follows that this scheme only works if the products of occupied and unoccupied hf orbitals are linearly independent .",
    "however , in general , if the products of occupied and unoccupied hf orbitals are linearly dependent then it is not possible to obtain the hf ground state energy via an xoep scheme .      before we discuss the question how products of basis functions can become linearly dependent for given orbital basis sets we elucidate the situation from a constrained - search @xcite point of view",
    "we start with a constrained - search proof that the xoep ground state energy , @xmath0 , must equal the hf ground state energy , @xmath1 , in their common finite orbital basis , when there is no linear dependence in the products of orbital basis functions . to accomplish this we appeal to the work of harriman @xcite .",
    "he showed that only one first - order density matrix may yield any density generated by a given finite orbital basis whose basis products form a linearly independent set .",
    "this means that since an idempotent first - order density matrix uniquely fixes a corresponding single determinant , it follows that only one single determinant , constructed from a given finite orbital basis whose products are linearly independent , may yield a density that is constructed from this same basis .",
    "consequently , with use of a common finite orbital basis set , the xoep single determinant must equal the hf single determinant if there exists an effective ks potential @xmath71 in eq ( [ ks - hamiltonian ] ) such that the corresponding ks ground state density is the same as the hartree - fock density . that this @xmath71 exists for the situation when the basis products are linearly independent , as discussed above , follows from ref .",
    "[ ] and was shown in practice by staroverov , scuseria , and davidson @xcite .    what happens when the products are not linearly independent ?",
    "due to the idempotency property of the first - order density matrix for a single determinant , a density generated from a given finite orbital basis could still generate a unique determinant if the basis products are linearly dependent , provided that this linear dependency is mild enough @xcite , i.e. , if the products of occupied and unoccupied orbitals remain linearly independent .",
    "however , if the linear dependency of the basis product pairs is not sufficiently mild , then the situation changes dramatically in that more than one single determinant will yield the same density from a given finite basis set @xcite . in this case",
    "we do not have equality @xmath72 .",
    "instead , we have inequality @xmath73 , which arises from the following contradiction .",
    "assume that the xoep determinant @xmath74 equals the hf determinant @xmath75 through respective optimizations in their common finite orbital basis set .",
    "then it follows that their densities must be the same .",
    "but , from a constrained - search analysis @xcite , the xoep determinant @xmath74 would yield this hf density and minimize , within this common basis , just the expectation value @xmath76 of the kinetic energy , while the hf determinant @xmath75 yields this hf density and minimizes , within the common basis , the expectation value @xmath77 of the kinetic energy plus the electron - electron repulsion energy .",
    "here @xmath78 denotes the many - electron kinetic energy operator , @xmath79 the corresponding electron - electron repulsion operator , and @xmath80 slater determinants that yield the hf density .",
    "( equivalently , the xoep determinant would yield the hf density and minimize @xmath81 while the hf determinant yields this hf density and of course minimizes @xmath82 . here",
    "@xmath83 denotes the many - electron hamiltonian operator . ) . because the slater determinants @xmath74 and @xmath75 minimize different expectation values , i.e. , @xmath84 , respectively , they are different , in general , and the inequality @xmath85 applies for this common finite orbital basis case .",
    "however , there is only one possible determinant @xmath80 that yields the hf density from a given finite basis when the basis products are linearly independent or the extent of linear dependency is weak . in this case",
    "both minimizations yield this one slater determinant simply because both minimization only run over one slater determinant .",
    "thus there is no contradiction and the finite basis set conclusion of staroverov , scuseria , and davidson follows in that the equality @xmath72 applies .",
    "hence we are now able to provide the resolution of the xoep paradox @xcite stated by staroverov , scuseria , and davidson : for a finite basis set case , no matter how large the basis , @xmath0 equals @xmath1 provided that the basis products form a linearly independent set or the extent of linear dependence is sufficiently weak .",
    "however , in going from any starting finite basis set to the complete basis set limit , @xmath0 may become greater than @xmath1 somewhere along the way because as more and more basis orbitals are added to the finite basis set , the onset of sufficient linear dependency eventually occurs ( see appendix ) .",
    "we have provided an explanation for what might very well seem counterintuitive to the reader without knowledge of the analysis provided here .",
    "as one keeps adding more and more orbital basis functions , both @xmath1 and @xmath0 decrease and they continually remain equal to each other . past a certain critical point  in the addition of orbital basis functions , however , @xmath1 and @xmath0 may start to differ from each other and @xmath1 keeps decreasing while the behavior of @xmath0 depends on the chosen orbital basis set and it might actually be that @xmath0 rises ! the latter behavior for example occurs if the exact hf orbitals as they correspond to a real space representation are themselves chosen as the basis set . if the basis set is restricted to the occupied hf orbitals , @xmath1 and @xmath0 are of course equal .",
    "if unoccupied hf orbitals are added to the basis set , @xmath1 remains unchanged at first .",
    "in contrast , beyond a certain point @xmath0 raises .",
    "the cause , of course , is the appearance of sufficient linear dependence at the critical point .",
    "[ ] does analyse certain linear dependency situations but the authors do not discuss the energy consequences for finite basis sets . )      next we consider how products of orbitals basis functions become linearly dependent .",
    "as example we consider a plane wave basis set corresponding to a unit cell defined by the three linearly independent lattice vectors @xmath86 , @xmath87 , and @xmath88 . the plane waves representing the orbital basis set @xmath89 then are given by @xmath90 with @xmath91 and @xmath92 in eq .",
    "( [ g ] ) , @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 denote three reciprocal lattice vectors defined by the conditions @xmath96 for @xmath97 .",
    "by @xmath98 the space of all integer numbers is denoted , @xmath99 denotes the cutoff that determines the size of the plane wave basis set , and @xmath100 stands for the crystal volume .",
    "we have assumed before that basis functions are real - valued .",
    "this is not the case for plane waves .",
    "however , we can always obtain a real valued basis set by linear combining all pairs of plane waves with wave vectors @xmath101 and @xmath102 to real - valued basis functions .",
    "this real valued basis set and the original complex - valued plane wave basis set are related by a unitary transformation that does not change any of the arguments of this paper .",
    "all arguments therefore are also valid for the complex - valued plane wave basis sets considered here and below .",
    "the number @xmath60 of basis functions roughly equals @xmath103 .",
    "the exact value of @xmath60 depends on whether reciprocal lattice vectors @xmath101 that lie in the immediate vicinity of the surface of the sphere with radius @xmath99 have lengths that are slightly larger or slightly smaller than @xmath99 .",
    "the relation @xmath104 shows that the products of plane waves of the orbital basis set are again plane waves of the same type with reciprocal lattice vectors @xmath105 that obey the relation @xmath106 . due to the latter relation",
    "the number of different products @xmath107 is about 8 times as large as the number @xmath13 of orbital basis functions , i.e. , equals about @xmath108 .",
    "if @xmath109 then @xmath110 . in this case",
    "the number of _ different _ products of orbital basis functions is smaller than the number of products of orbital functions .",
    "thus some products of orbital functions are equal and thus linearly dependent . for realistic systems",
    "the number of plane wave basis functions is much larger than 15 . in a plane wave framework",
    "therefore xoep and hf methods , in general , lead to different ground state energies with @xmath73 .",
    "results from plane wave xoep and hf calculations for silicon discussed below illustrate this point .",
    "in this section we show that the xoep approach of staroverov , scuseria , and davidson @xcite does not really correspond to an exact exchange ks method and does not yield a ks exchange potential , irrespective of whether or not the products of basis functions of the chosen orbital basis set are linearly independent . to this end",
    "we consider the xoep or exact exchange ( exx ) equation written in a form that slightly differs from that of eq.([exxb ] ) @xmath111 the response function @xmath112 in eq .",
    "( [ exx ] ) is given by @xmath113 eq .",
    "( [ exx ] ) can be derived in completely different ways .",
    "firstly , following refs . [ ] and [ ] , one can consider the expression of the hf total energy and search for those orbitals that minimize this energy under the constraint that the orbitals are eigenstates of a schrdinger equation with an hamiltonian operator of the form @xmath114 the search for these orbitals is tantamount to searching the optimal effective potential @xmath115 , therefore the name optimized effective potential method .",
    "the optimized effective potential @xmath115 can always be expressed as @xmath116 with the hartree potential given as the coulomb potential of the electron density generated by the orbitals . as shown in refs .",
    "[ ] and [ ] the optimized effective potential @xmath115 is obtained if the exchange potential potential @xmath117 of eq.([oep - potential ] ) obeys the xoep or exx equation ( [ exx ] ) .",
    "alternatively the xoep or exx equation ( [ exx ] ) can be derived within an exact exchange - only ks framework . the hamiltonian operator @xmath118 of the exact exchange - only ks equation is given by eq .",
    "( [ ks - hamiltonian ] ) with the effective ks potential @xmath119 the ks exchange potential in eq .",
    "( [ ks - potential ] ) is defined as the functional derivative of the exchange energy @xmath120 with respect to the electron density @xmath121 , i.e , as @xmath122 following ref .",
    "[ ] we now exploit that according to the hohenberg - kohn theorem there exists a one - to - one mapping between effective potentials @xmath123 and resulting electron densities @xmath121 .",
    "therefore all quantities that are functionals of the electron density , here in particular the exchange energy , can be simultaneously considered as functionals of the effective potential @xmath71 .",
    "taking the functional derivative @xmath124 of the exchange energy with respect to the effective potential @xmath71 in two different ways with the help of the chain rule yields @xmath125 the functional derivative @xmath126 equals the response function ( [ xs ] ) and the right hand side of eq.([chain - rule ] ) equals the right hand side of the xoep or exx equation ( [ exx ] ) .",
    "furthermore the response function @xmath112 is symmetric in its arguments for real valued orbitals .",
    "therefore eq .",
    "( [ chain - rule ] ) is identical to the oep or exx equation ( [ exx ] ) .",
    "this shows that the exchange potentials arising in the xoep and the exact exchange - only ks schemes and subsequently the xoep and the exact exchange - only ks schemes itself are identical . the xoep or exx equation can be derived in various ways within a ks framework @xcite . a crucial point , however , is that all derivations within a ks framework rely on real space representations in the sense that functional derivatives are taken within real space because the ks exchange potential is defined in real space as the functional derivative @xmath127 .",
    "thus the above conclusion that the xoep and the exact exchange - only ks schemes are equivalent holds only in real space , i.e. , if all quantities are respresented in real space .",
    "calculations , however , are usually carried out in basis sets and we will show next that in this case an xoep and an exact exchange - only ks scheme , in general , are not equivalent .",
    "the xoep or exx equation ( [ exx ] ) turns into the matrix equation @xmath128 with matrix and vector elements elements @xmath129 @xmath130 and @xmath131 if an auxiliary basis set @xmath132 is introduced to represent the response function , the exchange potential , and the right hand side of the exx equation ( [ exx ] ) . for simplicity",
    "we assume at this point that the auxiliary basis set is an orthonormal basis set .",
    "this is actually the case for plane wave basis sets but not for gaussian basis sets .",
    "however , without changing the following arguments we can assume that we have orthonormalized any auxiliary gaussian basis set .",
    "as long as the orbitals are represented in real space there is an infinite number of them and the summations over unoccupied orbitals in the response function ( [ xs ] ) and the right hand side of the xoep or exx equation ( [ exx ] ) remains infinite and complete . for simplicity",
    "we assume that the considered electron system is either periodic and thus exhibits periodic boundary conditions or , in case of a finite system , is enclosed in a large but finite box with an infinite external potential outside the box .",
    "then the number of orbitals is infinite but countable .",
    "as long as all orbitals are taken into account in the summation over unoccupied orbitals , the basis set representation of the exchange potential resulting from the basis set xoep or exx equation ( [ exx - basis ] ) becomes the more accurate the larger the auxiliary basis set and converges against the real space representation of the exchange potential and can be interpreted both as exact exchange - only ks or xoep exchange potential .",
    "this changes dramatically if the orbitals are represented in a finite orbital basis set .",
    "then , provided a reasonable orbital basis set is chosen , the occupied and the energetically low unoccupied orbitals are well represented .",
    "most of the energetically higher unoccupied orbitals , however , are not represented at all simply because a finite orbital basis set can not give rise to an infinite number of unoccupied orbitals .",
    "moreover , the energetically higher orbitals arising in a finite orbital basis set are quite poor representations of true unoccupied orbitals .",
    "let us now concentrate on the representation of the response function .",
    "the integrals @xmath133 occuring in the matrix elements ( [ xs - elements ] ) of the response function contain the three functions @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath134 .",
    "the occupied orbitals @xmath52 have few nodes and thus are relatively smooth functions .",
    "the energetically low lying unoccupied orbitals still are relatively smooth , the higher ones however , with an increasing number of nodes and with increasing kinetic energy become more and more rapidly oscillating . for smooth auxiliary basis functions @xmath134 the integrals latexmath:[$\\langle \\phi_a    high unoccupied orbital @xmath53 because the product of the smooth functions @xmath134 and @xmath52 again is a smooth function and the integral of this smooth product with a rapidly oscillatory unoccupied orbital @xmath53 is zero due to the fact that any integral of a smooth with a rapidly oscillating function vanishes .",

    "( [ xs - elements ] ) can be restricted to unoccupied orbitals @xmath53 below a certain energy depending on the smoothness of the involved auxiliary basis functions @xmath134 and @xmath138 . for sufficiently smooth functions @xmath134 and @xmath138 the contributing unoccupied orbitals @xmath53",
    "thus are well represented in a finite orbital basis set",
    ". therefore the matrix elements @xmath136 of the response functions are correct for indices @xmath40 and @xmath139 referring to sufficiently smooth auxiliary basis functions . for a more rapidly oscillating auxiliary basis function",
    "nonvanishing matrix elements @xmath133 with energetically high unoccupied orbitals @xmath53 occur .",
    "the energetically high unoccupied orbitals @xmath53 , however , are poorly described in the finite orbital basis set and moreover there are too few of them .",
    "therefore the matrix elements @xmath136 of the response functions turn out to be wrong if at least one index refers to a more rapidly oscillating auxiliary basis functions . indeed ,",
    "if an auxilliary function @xmath140 oscillates much more rapidly than the energetically highest unoccupied orbitals @xmath53 obtained for a given orbital basis set then all matrix elements @xmath141 and thus all corresponding elements @xmath136 of the response function is erroneously zero .    for a given auxiliary basis set , according to the above argument",
    ", a representation of the response function is correct only if the orbital basis set is balanced to the auxiliary basis set in the sense that it describes well unoccupied orbitals up to a sufficiently high energy .",
    "otherwise an incorrect representation of the response function is obtained .",
    "the matrix representation of the response function like the response function itself is negative semidefinite .",
    "this is easily seen if a matrix element of the type @xmath142 for an arbitrary function @xmath143 is considered .",
    "such a matrix element is obtained by summing up the contributions occuring in the summation over occupied and unoccupied orbitals in eq .",
    "( [ xs ] ) . each single contribution and",
    "thus also the complete sum is nonpositive .",
    "therefore an insufficient orbital basis set leading to too few energetically high unoccupied orbitals results in eigenvalues of the response matrix that have a too small magnitude .",
    "solutions of the matrix equation ( [ exx - basis ] ) are given by the product of the inverse of the response matrix with the right hand side of the equation , i.e. , by @xmath144 .",
    "if @xmath145 contains eigenvalues that are too small then the corresponding eigenvectors contribute with a too large magnitude to the solution of equation ( [ exx - basis ] ) .",
    "the eigenvectors with too small eigenvalues correspond to rapidly oscillatory functions .",
    "therefore the resulting exchange potential exhibits rapidly oscillatory features .",
    "this is exactly what is observed in the xoep scheme of staroverov , scuseria , and davidson @xcite . if the response matrix even contains eigenvectors with eigenvalues that are erroneously zero then an infinite number of solutions arise of the matrix equation ( [ exx - basis ] ) corresponding to an infinite number of exchange potentials , which yield , within the finite basis set , the same ks orbitals .    therefore if the auxilliary and the orbital basis sets are chosen unbalanced , e.g. , if one chooses a too small orbital basis set for a given auxiliary basis set or a too large auxiliary basis set for a given orbital basis set , then the resulting response matrix @xmath145 is corrupted and no longer represents a proper representation of the response function in real space . in this case",
    "the xoep scheme no longer represents an exact exchange ks scheme and the resulting exchange potential is unphysical and no longer represents the ks exchange potential .",
    "however , even in this case the xoep scheme still is a proper optimized potential scheme in the sense that it yields a linear combination of auxiliary basis functions that results in the lowest total energy for this orbital basis set that can be obtained if the exchange potential shall be a linear combination of the auxiliary basis functions . while the resulting exchange potential is unphysical and does not resemble the ks exchange potential it obeys the above requirement of the xoep scheme .",
    "the reason is that the arguments used for the xoep derivation of the real space exx or xoep equation can also be used if orbital and auxiliary basis sets are introduced whereas no analogue to the dft derivation exists anymore in this case .",
    "we now illustrate the arguments of the previous two sections by specific examples .",
    "these examples also demonstrate that an auxiliary basis set that consists of all products of occupied and unoccupied orbitals is not balanced to the corresponding orbital basis set in the sense that a correct representation of the response function and a proper ks exchange potential can not be obtained for such an auxiliary basis set .",
    "firstly a system of electrons in a box with periodic boundary conditions and an external potential equal to a constant is considered .",
    "the box shall be defined by corresponding unit cell vectors @xmath146 with @xmath147 .",
    "if the box , i.e. , the unit cell vectors , become infinitely large then the system turns into an homogeneous electron gas .",
    "the ks eigenstates @xmath148 of such a system are determined by symmetry and are simple plane waves @xmath149 as they are given in eq .",

    "set we chose plane waves , @xmath149 and @xmath154 , respectively , again as given in eq.([plane - waves ] ) .",
    "thus , for the considered system , arises the special case that each orbital basis function @xmath149 represents a ks orbital @xmath148 . obviously , the cutoff @xmath155 of the orbital basis set has to be chosen equal to or larger than @xmath156 .",
    "the matrix representation @xmath145 of the response function in the considered case is diagonal with diagonal elements @xmath157 the auxiliary basis set shall be characterized by the cutoff radius @xmath158 , i.e. , the auxiliary basis set shall consist of all plane waves @xmath154 with @xmath159 .",
    "note that the auxiliary function with @xmath160 that equals a constant function has to be excluded from the auxiliary basis set because the xoep or exx equation in agreement with the basic formalism determines the exchange potential only up to an additive constant .",

    "now three cases can be distinguished : ( i ) if @xmath161 then the corresponding matrix elements @xmath162 of the reponse function are obtained with their correct value in a basis set calculation with an orbital basis set characterized by the cutoff radius @xmath155 because all unoccupied orbitals @xmath163 occuring in the summation in eq .",

    "this demonstrates that an auxiliary basis set given by all products of occupied and unoccupied orbitals is not balanced with the corresponding orbital basis set .",
    "the considered system is special in that the right hand side of the xoep or exx matrix equation is zero due to the translational symmetry .",
    "therefore also the resulting exchange potential is zero or more precisely equals an arbitrary constant .",
    "if the auxiliary basis set is chosen according to the above cases ( i ) and ( ii ) then a basis set calculation yields the correct exchange potential , i.e. , zero or a constant .",
    "if the auxiliary basis set contains functions according to the above case ( iii ) , however , then the xoep or exx matrix equation erroneously has an infinite number of solutions that equal a constant plus an arbitrary contribution of auxiliary basis functions with @xmath169 .",
    "the reason why the correct exchange potential is obtained for an auxiliary basis set chosen according to the above case ( ii ) despite the fact that in this case the response function is already corrupted is that for the special system considered here the right hand side of the xoep or exx matrix equation is zero .",
    "therefore any values for the diagonal elements @xmath162 that differ from zero lead to the correct result .",
    "however , in general the right hand side of xoep or exx matrix equation is not equal to zero and then a response matrix with eigenvalues with erroneously too small magnitudes leads to a wrong exchange potential that exhibits too large contributions from those linear combinations of auxiliary basis functions that correspond to the too small eigenvalues of the response matrix .",

    "a key point is that the orbital products of a complete basis are linearly dependent .    moreover , whether or not the products of occupied and unoccupied orbitals are linearly independent , we have shown that basis set xoep methods only represent exchange - only ( exx ) ks methods , i.e. , proper density - functional methods , if the orbital basis set and the auxiliary basis set representing the exchange potential are balanced to each other , i.e. , if the orbital basis set is comprehensive enough for a given auxiliary basis set",

    "another reason to carry out xoep methods that represent exx ks methods is that the latter may be combined with new , possibly orbital - dependent , correlation functionals to arrive at a new generation of density - functional methods .",
