    "the latest theoretical and computational advances in nuclear structure modeling have also had a strong impact on nuclear astrophysics .",
    "more and more often calculations of stellar nucleosynthesis , nuclear aspects of supernova collapse and explosion , and neutrino - induced reactions , are based on microscopic global predictions for the nuclear ingredients , rather than on oversimplified phenomenological approaches .",
    "the nuclear input for astrophysics calculations necessitates the properties of thousands of nuclei far from stability , including the characteristics of strong , electromagnetic and weak interaction processes .",
    "most of these nuclei , especially on the neutron - rich side , are not accessible in experiments and , therefore , many nuclear astrophysics calculations crucially depend on accurate theoretical predictions for the nuclear masses , bulk properties , nuclear excitations , ( @xmath4 ) and ( @xmath5 ) rates , @xmath6- and @xmath0-decay half - lives , fission probabilities , electron and neutrino capture rates , etc .    the path of the @xmath7-process nucleosynthesis runs through regions of very neutron - rich nuclei .",
    "@xmath0-decays are particularly important because they generate elements with higher z - values , and set the time scale of the @xmath7-process . except for a few key nuclei",
    ", however , @xmath0-decays of @xmath7-process nuclei have to be determined from nuclear models .",
    "one of the crucial questions for structure models is , therefore , a consistent microscopic calculation of @xmath0-decay far from stability .",
    "two microscopic approaches have been successfully applied in large - scale modeling of weak interaction rates of neutron - rich nuclei : the shell model and the proton - neutron quasiparticle random phase approximation ( pn - qrpa ) .",
    "shell model applications in nuclear astrophysics have recently been reviewed in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the calculation of @xmath0-half lives ,",
    "in particular , the principal advantage of the shell model is the ability to take into account the detailed structure of the @xmath0-strength functions .",
    "in addition to large - scale shell model predictions for the half - lives of waiting - point nuclei at @xmath8 @xcite , the no - core shell model @xcite and the shell model embedded in the continuum @xcite have recently been applied to @xmath0-decay of light nuclei .",
    "large configuration spaces , however , prevent systematic applications of the shell model to heavy nuclei along the r - process path .    when compared to the shell model ,",
    "important advantages of an qrpa approach based on the microscopic self - consistent mean - field framework , include the use of global effective nuclear interactions and the treatment of arbitrarily heavy systems .",
    "fully self - consistent qrpa calculations of weak interaction rates of neutron - rich nuclei , however , have only recently been reported . in ref .",
    "@xcite , in particular , a fully self - consistent qrpa has been formulated in hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) canonical single - particle basis .",
    "the canonical basis diagonalizes the density matrix and describes both the bound states and the positive - energy single - particle continuum .",
    "the formulation of the rqrpa in the canonical basis is particularly convenient because , in order to describe transitions to low - lying states in weakly bound nuclei , the two - quasiparticle configuration space must include states with both nucleons in the discrete bound levels , states with one nucleon in a bound level and one nucleon in the continuum , and also states with both nucleons in the continuum .",
    "the hfb+qrpa model based on skyrme interactions , and with the inclusion of a finite - range residual proton - neutron particle - particle interaction , has been applied in the calculation of @xmath0-decay rates for spherical neutron - rich r - process waiting - point nuclei  @xcite .",
    "based on a different energy - density functional , the self - consistent hfb plus continuum qrpa framework has been employed in a systematic calculation of the allowed and first - forbidden @xmath0-decay rates for the @xmath7-process nuclei near @xmath8 @xcite . it has been shown that the effect of the high - energy first - forbidden transitions is crucial for @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and especially in the @xmath11 region .    in this work",
    "we report the first application of the relativistic pn - qrpa in the calculation of @xmath12-decay rates for neutron - rich nuclei .",
    "self - consistent relativistic mean - field models have been very successfully applied to nuclear structure , not only in nuclei along the valley of @xmath0-stability , but also in exotic nuclei with extreme isospin values and close to the particle drip lines .",
    "the relativistic mean - field framework has recently been extended to include medium dependent meson - nucleon vertices .",
    "one way to determine the functional form of the meson - nucleon vertices is from in - medium dirac - brueckner interactions , obtained from realistic free - space nn interactions .",
    "this microscopic method represents an _ ab initio _ description of nuclear matter and finite nuclei .",
    "another approach is purely phenomenological , with the density dependence for the @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 meson - nucleon couplings adjusted to properties of nuclear matter and a set of spherical nuclei .",
    "the resulting density - dependent meson - nucleon couplings are in qualitative agreement with those obtained in the microscopic approach . in ref .",
    "@xcite we have extended the relativistic hartree - bogoliubov ( rhb ) model to include medium - dependent vertex functions .",
    "a phenomenological effective interaction , denoted dd - me1 , was adjusted to properties of nuclear matter and finite nuclei , and tested in the analysis of the equations of state for symmetric and asymmetric nuclear matter , of ground - state properties of the sn and pb isotopic chains @xcite , and deformed nuclei @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that , in comparison with standard non - linear meson self - interactions , relativistic lagrangians with an explicit density dependence of the meson - nucleon couplings provide an improved description of asymmetric nuclear matter , neutron matter and nuclei far from stability .",
    "the relativistic random - phase approximation ( rrpa ) , based on effective lagrangians characterized by density - dependent meson - nucleon vertex functions , has been derived in ref . @xcite . in ref .  @xcite the relativistic qrpa has been formulated in the canonical single - nucleon basis of the rhb model , and the corresponding proton - neutron relativistic qrpa ( pn - rqrpa )",

    "our initial attempt to calculate @xmath12 decay rates of r - process nuclei by simply employing the dd - me1 interaction in the rhb plus pn - rqrpa framework was not successful .",
    "in general , the resulting half - lives were more than an order of magnitude longer than the empirical values .",
    "the reason is that dd - me1 , as well as most other successful relativistic mean - field interactions , has a relatively low effective nucleon mass , especially when compared to effective masses of skyrme forces .",
    "this means that , because the density of states around the fermi surface is low , in a self - consistent relativistic qrpa calculation of @xmath0-decay the transition energies are low , and this result in long lifetimes . in some cases",
    "one could improve the results by adjusting the strength of the @xmath16 pairing interaction , which is not really known , but this is not the solution of the problem , and in any case it can not be applied to doubly closed - shell nuclei .",
    "the problem of adjusting the effective nucleon mass in relativistic mean - field models is somewhat complicated , because this quantity is also related to the energy spacings between spin - orbit partner states .",
    "since the latter are empirically well determined , the effective nucleon mass can not be increased without extending the standard relativistic mean - field framework . in order to be able to calculate @xmath0-decay half - lives , in this work",

    "the ground state of a nucleus can be written either in the quasiparticle basis as a product of independent quasi - particle states , or in the canonical basis as a highly correlated bcs - state . by definition , the canonical basis diagonalizes the density matrix and it is always localized .",
    "it describes both the bound states and the positive - energy single - particle continuum .",
    "the matrix equations of the qrpa take a particularly simple form in the canonical basis , including only the matrix elements @xmath19 of the residual @xmath17-interaction , and the matrix elements @xmath20 of the pairing @xmath18-interaction , as well as certain combinations of the occupation factors @xmath21 , @xmath22 of the canonical single - nucleon states .",
