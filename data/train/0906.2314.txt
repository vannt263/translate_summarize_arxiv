    "superfluidity is one of the most dramatic manifestations of quantum mechanics on the macroscopic scale , and is associated to a host of different phenomena such as non - classical rotational inertia , quantization of vortices , dragless motion of impurities and metastability of ring currents as seen in , _",
    "e.g. _ , liquid he ii . since each of these phenomena may be taken as `` defining '' a transition to superfluidity , it is important to ask under what circumstances they occur together . as was pointed out by leggett @xcite",
    "the metastability of ring currents and nonclassical rotational inertia are two fundamental superfluid phenomena of yet very different nature .",
    "while the latter is an equilibrium property , the former is a dynamic one .",
    "although both types of phenomena are often explained by bose - einstein condensation of bosons or cooper pairs of fermions @xcite , the latter is not seen as an exclusive requirement @xcite .",
    "here we consider the superfluid properties of an interacting one - dimensional ( 1d ) bose gas at zero temperature , a system which is not bose - condensed @xcite but may possess quasi - long - range order @xcite .",
    "it is a long - standing question whether the 1d bose gas can support persistent currents with macroscopic lifetimes @xcite .",
    "this system has been realized with ultracold bosonic atoms in tightly confining linear traps @xcite ( ring traps are also under development @xcite ) , in which the boson interactions are effectively described @xcite by the contact potential @xmath0 of the lieb - liniger ( ll ) model @xcite .",
    "the interaction strength is quantified by the dimensionless parameter @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the linear density and @xmath3 is the mass . for @xmath4 ,",
    "the model is known as the tonks - girardeau ( tg ) gas and can be mapped to an ideal _ fermi _ gas . for @xmath5 , the bogoliubov model of weakly interacting bosons",
    "is recovered .    experimental investigation of the superfluid properties of the 1d bose gas by observing the motion of impurities is at an early stage @xcite and theoretical predictions are not yet comprehensive .",
    "sonin @xcite found that ring currents can be metastable except for infinitely strong interactions .",
    "_ @xcite also concluded that persistent currents could be observable on experimental time scales and bchler _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite found the 1d bose gas able to sustain supercurrents even in the presence of a strong defect .",
    "astrakharchik and pitaevskii @xcite considered the drag force on a moving heavy impurity within luttinger liquid theory and predicted a power - law dependence on the velocity for small velocities .",
    "these results contain an unknown prefactor preventing the calculation of the actual value of the drag force and are in any case not applicable at larger velocities .",
    "the motion of an impurity of finite mass was considered in the tg gas @xcite but for finite values of @xmath6 this problem is still unresolved .    in this paper",
    "we calculate the rate of energy dissipation of ring currents in the presence of a small integrability - breaking defect of strength @xmath7 based on recent advances in the understanding @xcite of the dynamics of the ll model .",
    "the results of our calculations are summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : drag ] . while for small velocities our calculations support the power - law predictions of ref .",
    "@xcite , the drag force @xmath8 assumes the velocity - independent value of @xmath9 for velocities large compared to the speed of sound @xmath10 .",
    "although our results suggest that the 1d bose gas can support metastable currents only in the weakly interacting regime where @xmath11 , the superfluid fraction is 1 regardless of @xmath6 @xcite according to the nonclassical rotational inertia for a finite ring .",

    "suppose that the gas is initially rotating with the linear velocity @xmath22 and then is braked with an `` obstacle , '' created , _",
    "e.g. _ , by a laser beam @xcite . in the frame where the gas is at rest",
    ", the obstacle moves with velocity @xmath23 . in a superfluid",
    "we expect no energy dissipation , and thus zero drag force ( the current is persistent ) .",
    "energy conservation dictates that the transitions from the ground state caused by the moving obstacle with velocity @xmath24 , lie on the line @xmath25 .",
    "according to landau , if the excitation spectrum lies above this line , the motion can not excite the system , which is then regarded superfluid .",
    "the landau critical velocity ( when the line touches the spectrum ) equals @xmath26 .",
    "this implies that any supercurrent state with @xmath27 is unstable since @xmath28 .",
    "however , in 3d similar supercurrent states exist , which apparently leads to the absence of current metastability .",
    "the paradox can be resolved by considering not only the spectrum but also _ probabilities _ of excitations .",
    "below we argue that in the 3d case , the probability to excite supercurrents is vanishingly small , while in the 1d case it depends on the strength of bosonic interactions .",
    "when the walls of a toroidal container are set in rotation adiabatically with a small velocity , a superfluid stays at rest while a normal fluid follows the container .",
    "this effect leads to a nonclassical rotational inertia of superfluid systems , which can be used to determine the superfluid fraction @xcite .",
    "one can show @xcite that in the ll model , the gas has zero rotational inertia ( zero normal fraction ) at @xmath29 for any @xmath30 .",
    "this is an _ equilibrium _ property completely determined by the low - lying energy spectrum @xcite .",
    "by contrast to the hess - fairbank effect , metastability of currents is not an equilibrium effect and transition probabilities have to be considered .",
    "the dissipation rate as energy loss per unit time @xmath31 of an obstacle ( or heavy impurity ) moving with velocity @xmath24 relative to the gas can be related to the drag force @xmath32 acting on the impurity by @xmath33 . for weak impurities with interaction potential",
    "@xmath34 the drag force is related to the dynamic structure factor ( dsf ) in linear - response theory @xcite : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the fourier transform of the impurity potential .",

    "transitions from the ground state caused by a moving obstacle with velocity @xmath24 occur along the straight ( red ) line .",
    "drag force ( [ dragf1d ] ) is thus a generalization of the landau criterion for superfluidity . indeed ,",
    "if the excitation spectrum of a generic system lies above the line @xmath55 then it is superfluid ; in this case the drag force ( [ dragf1d ] ) equals zero .",
    "the drag force thus proves to be fundamental and can be considered as a quantitative measure of superfluidity .",
    "equation ( [ dragf1d ] ) can be verified experimentally for different types of obstacles : for @xmath56 all the points at the line contribute to the drag force , while for @xmath57 only one point @xmath58 in the @xmath59-@xmath60 plane does , where @xmath61 is the reciprocal lattice vector ( see fig .",

    "equation ( [ dfkg ] ) can be exploited even in the case of a cigar - shaped quasi-1d gas of bosons at large number of particles , because the boundary conditions do not play a role in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "it gives us the momentum transfer per unit time from a moving shallow lattice , which can be measured experimentally @xcite . at @xmath64 ,",
    "corresponding to the mott insulator state in a deep lattice , and at @xmath65 , the drag force takes non - zero values for arbitrary @xmath66 .",
    "however , at small @xmath6 , its non - zero values practically localize in vicinity of @xmath67 . as there is no sharp transition from superfluid to isolated phase in 1d @xcite",
    ", we can put the threshold equal to , say , @xmath68 of the characteristic value @xmath69 of the drag force ( [ dfkg ] ) .",
    "then we get a phase diagram in the @xmath24-@xmath6 plane @xcite similar to that of polkovnikov _ et al .",
    "note that in the latter paper , the superfluidity was examined in terms of quantum phase slips @xcite .",
    "so , the both quasiparticle and quantum phase slip description lead to the same results .      in order to study metastability of the @xmath16th supercurrent state , we need to calculate the drag force on an obstacle moving with the velocity @xmath23 relative to the gas . for large system size",
    "the supercurrent - state velocities are dense and in the thermodynamic limit ( @xmath70 , @xmath71 ) we may consider arbitrary velocities .",
    "we consider the drag force and decay of currents in various regimes .",
    "we calculate the drag force from eq .",
    "( [ dragf1d ] ) by using the interpolating expression @xmath72 for @xmath52 , and @xmath73 otherwise @xcite .",

    "the drag force reaches the velocity - independent value of @xmath9 .",
    "a characteristic velocity scale is the speed of sound @xmath10 , which determines the transition from a power - law increase to the velocity independent regime .",

    "the numerical dsf as per ref .",
    "@xcite was obtained for @xmath88 particles ( @xmath89 ) , @xmath90 ( @xmath91 ) and @xmath92 ( @xmath93 ) .",

    "the fit with the analytical ansatz is good for all values of @xmath24 for large @xmath6 .",
    "the decreasing curves at large velocity @xmath99 are due to imperfect sum - rule saturation at high momenta . for small @xmath6 ,",
    "the onset of the drag force is quicker from the numerical dsf than from the analytical ansatz .",
    "this occurs first because the smoothing of the numerical data required to compute the drag force overestimates it when its curvature is positive ( this smoothing also leads to small artifacts in the data around @xmath100 ) , and second because the obtained numerical dsf is larger than the analytical ansatz for @xmath101 , and also just above the bogoliubov dispersion ( where the analytical ansatz is zero by definition ) , where excitations with higher numbers of particle - hole pairs contribute .      for the important question whether persistent currents may exist at all ,",
    "the small velocity regime is most relevant , which is dominated by transitions near the first supercurrent state ( umklapp point at @xmath102 ) .",
    "the drag force in this regime has a power - law dependence on the velocity @xmath103 for @xmath104 , as first found by astrakharchik and pitaevskii . from eqs .",

    "( [ df_universal1 ] ) works well up to @xmath109 .",
    "the behavior of the dsf near the umklapp point means that the drag force takes non - zero values even for _ arbitrarily small _ interactions .",

    "excitations become readily available and provide an avenue for the rapid decay of supercurrents .",
    "landau reasoned that this is very implausible in 3d , since it involves the macroscopic motion of the system , and hence a _ macroscopic number _ of quasiparticle excitations .",
