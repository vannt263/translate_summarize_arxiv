    "the anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) are young , energetic , x - ray bright isolated neutron stars , with spin periods of the order 10s .",
    "they are called _ anomalous _ since their luminosity far exceeds the energy available from spin - down , and no binary companions are seen .",
    "axps ( along with the related soft gamma - ray repeaters or sgrs ) are now believed to be _ magnetars _ ( thompson & duncan , 1996 ) .",
    "magnetars have huge external magnetic fields ( @xmath1 g ) and even larger internal fields .",
    "it is the decay of the magnetic flux which provides the luminosity seen , and is responsible for a whole array of observational effects such as bursting and giant flares .",
    "see woods & thompson ( 2004 ) for a summary of recent observational data on magnetars , and how they are modeled .",
    "since they are young remnants of massive , short - lived progenitors , all of the axps are found in the galactic plane ( except for cxou  j010043.1@xmath2721134 which is in the small magallanic cloud ) .",
    "this causes a major obstacle to observations : high interstellar extinction , manifested as photo - electric edges from different elements in the soft x - ray band , and as continuum extinction from dust in the optical and near - infrared . since the amount of extinction has been difficult to estimate accurately , the spectral energy distributions of axp have been subject to large uncertainties ( hulleman et al .  2004 ; durant & van kerkwijk 2005 , 2006 ) .    furthermore , even if the interstellar absorption is well - characterized , distances and therefore absolute fluxes are difficult to determine .",
    "the simplest distance estimate is made by requiring that the black - body component typically inferred from the x - ray spectrum arises from a neutron - star sized area .",
    "we do not , however , expect the surfaces of axps to be homogeneous , both on observational grounds ( they pulsate ) and from theoretical considerations ( the magnetic field , which affects the heat conduction , will vary across the surface ) .    for axps that are associated with supernova remnants or other interstellar structure ,",
    "a more direct distance estimate can be made using 21 cm measurements and the galactic rotation curve .",
    "convincing cases for associations with supernova remnants have been made for two axps : 1e  2259 + 589 with ctb  109 ( gregory & fahlman , 1980 ) , and 1e  1841@xmath2045 with kes  73 ( sanbonmatsu & helfand 1992 ) .",
    "furthermore , gaensler et al .",
    "( 2005 ) found an bubble coincident with the direction of axp 1e  1048.1@xmath25937 , which they suggest was created by the winds of the massive progenitor of the axp ( see muno et al .",
    "2006 for a discussion of possible massive progenitors to axps ) .",
    "even for these systems , however , distance estimates can be rather uncertain , with different authors finding inconsistent results ( we discuss this further in  4 and  5 ) .    for sources in the galactic plane , a different clue to",
    "the distance is available if one has a good measure of the interstellar extinction , and the run of extinction with distance can be determined independently .",
    "this works because the extinction increases with distance , more so towards star - forming regions and molecular clouds .",
    "the so - called red clump method provides a means for deriving the function of reddening versus distance in any given line of sight , based on field stars over a relatively small area .",
    "lpez - corredoira et al .",
    "( 2002 ) noted that in an infrared color - magnitude diagramme of a stellar cluster ( @xmath3 versus @xmath4 for example ) , core helium - burning giants , or red clump stars , form a well - defined and easily - identified concentration of stars redward of the main sequence .",
    "stars spend up to 10% of their lifetime in this phase , and are much more luminous than typical main sequence stars . because their helium cores all have roughly the same mass , their luminosities are largely independent of the total stellar mass . furthermore ,",
    "their infrared colours are insensitive to metallicity . as a result",
    ", they are good infrared standard candles and if the red clump can be identified at each of a range of distances , then the reddening at each distance can be calculated .",
    "the method has been used not only by lopez - corredoira et al .",
    "( 2002 ) to measure the density distribution of stars in the galaxy , but also by , e.g. , drimmel et al .",

    "3 we use this field to test the reliability of the method , and to estimate uncertainties in the derived values . in  4 , we present the results of the red clump method applied to each of the galactic axps , and we discuss the implications in terms of distance . in  5 , we compare our new distances with those in the literature , in particular for the controversial case of 1e  2259 + 589 and the associated supernova remnant ctb  109 . in  6",
    ", we use our results to infer luminosities and emitting radii , and discuss how these depend on other axp properties .",
    "we draw conclusions in  7 .",
    "our method closely follows that described by lpez - corredoira et al .",
    "we start with data from the 2mass catalog ( skrutskie et al . ,",
    "2006 ) in the j- and k@xmath5-bands .",
    "( from here on , we refer to the k@xmath5 band as k for brevity . ) since all the galactic axps lie along the plane , we find a large number of 2mass stars at relatively small radii around each source .",
    "for the analysis , we initially chose the 9999 nearest stars and used these to construct @xmath3 versus @xmath4 color - magnitude diagrammes ( covering circular fields around each axp with radii in the range 96 to 20.6 ) .",
    "below , we first discuss in some detail the results for the axp 1e  1048.1@xmath25937 , for which applying the method proved to be most tricky .    figure [ cmd ] shows the colour - magnitude diagramme for 1e  1048.1@xmath25937 . on this graph",
    ", reddening alone causes stars to move to the right and slightly down ( redder and fainter ) and increased distance alone causes stars to move down ( fainter in all bands ) . from the figure",
    ", one sees that the main sequence ( on the left of the diagramme ) contains the bulk of the stars .",
    "due to the large range in intrinsic luminosities , stars from different distances and reddenings show up as an amorphous conglomeration , with an increasing range in color towards the faint end .",
    "the red clump , however , shows up as a clearly defined stripe ( center ) , representing stars of the same luminosity and color at different distances and reddenings .",
    "since red - clump stars are relatively rare , few are found at magnitudes brighter than about @xmath6 ( distance @xmath7kpc ) .",
    "stars redward of the red clump are either poorly measured ( e.g. , blended in the k band ) , background super - giants or young stars with infrared excess .    one can select any range in @xmath4 in the diagramme in order to find the peak of the red - clump star distribution for that range .",
    "our method works by identifying this peak for various ranges in k - band magnitude . as an example , we have selected a 0.6mag - wide strip around @xmath8 for analysis .",

    "features from this plot , such as the poor fits around @xmath18 , will be discussed in the next section .",
    "since our algorithm finds only local minima in the @xmath19 surface , it is necessary to supply reasonable starting values to the routine .",
    "we found that if we chose our strips in @xmath4 to overlap , and used the best - fit values of the previous histogram , smooth changes in the peak were well followed . to increase robustness",
    ", our algorithm also checks the relative residuals of fits performed with a few different initial values of @xmath20 ; this covers the case where there is a sudden jump in reddening .",
    "note that the choice of the range in @xmath4 of each histogram and the extent to which these strips overlap is arbitrary , but should not change the results .",

    ", the translation of @xmath3 versus @xmath4 into reddening versus distance corresponds to decomposing the reddening and distance vectors on the diagramme for each red - clump peak found .",
    "the infrared color excess can be expressed as a visual reddening through ( e.g. , schlegel et al .",
    "1998 ) : @xmath23 the distance is then ( correcting for reddening in k ) : @xmath24",
    "the approach discussed above for converting a 2mass dataset into a run of reddening with distance does not yet yield estimates of the uncertainties . here , we investigate the error analysis for the field of 1e  1048.1@xmath24937 in detail .",
    "we chose this field since it exemplifies the problems faced , and lies near one of the most complicated regions of the galaxy , the carina complex .",

    "[ fitter ] ) , which should be a good approximation if the gaussian is a reasonable fit for the distribution of infrared colors in the red clump , and if the contamination by other stars is not too large . for the test field ,",
    "the fwhm of the peak is typically @xmath27mag and the number of stars of order 100s , giving uncertainties of the position of the peak @xmath28mag ( one - sigma ) .    in principle",
    ", one could derive better formal uncertainties , e.g. , by calculating the @xmath19 values around the best - fit function , or ",
    "more appropriately for a counting problem with poissonian statistics  using a maximum - likelihood method ( which might even take into account the probability distributions in @xmath29 and @xmath4 for each star ) .",
    "we believe , however , that a better approach is to keep the estimate of the formal errors simple and combine it with empirical tests for systematic effects using different subsets of stars and using multiple fields .",
    "the first test we did was to try different cuts on the 2mass data using the magnitude error estimates and photometric quality flags , in order to keep only the best measured points .",
    "we found , however , that this had the sole effect of truncating the cmd at brighter magnitudes , without significantly tightening the spread in the red - clump stars at any magnitude .",
    "this suggests that any spread in the red - clump stripe on a cmd beyond the typical measurement error is due predominantly to field inhomogeneities .",
    "thus , in order to find the reddening to as large a distance as possible , we continue to use all the available 2mass stars in a given field .",
    "an important feature that can be seen for the bins between @xmath30 and 11.5 in fig .",
    "[ marked ] is that there seems to be overdensities at both @xmath31 and @xmath32 and that the fitted points lie in between these two .",
    "this suggests that the reddening at these distances is variable across the field . since two peaks are visible , part of the field might be obscured by denser interstellar matter .    to investigate the inhomogeneity in reddening , and to determine how this affects the sensitivity of method",
    ", we analyzed six fields at a distance of 15  from 1e  1048.1@xmath25937 ( note that these fields overlap somewhat with the target field ) .",
    "figure [ circle ] shows the resulting graphs of @xmath3 versus @xmath4 ( we show this graph rather than @xmath33 versus @xmath34 , since @xmath34 depends on both values ) .",
    "one sees that the distribution of reddenings is trimodal , with fields 1 and 6 showing consistently less reddening as a function of distance than fields 2 , 3 and 5 , but merging to the same value for faint @xmath4 ( note that some fields appear to show a decrease in reddening ; this is due to the same bimodality that affects the central pointing ) .",
    "field 4 shows consistently higher reddening , and is the line of sight passing towards the cluster to the west .",
    "thus , there is structure in the galactic dust distribution : a dust cloud appears to cover the field gradually from the north - west with increasing distance .",
    "considering the complex structure of the local carina nebula , this is not surprising ; it is simply a consequence of the large reddening gradients in the area .    from fig .",
    "[ circle ] , comparing fields with similar runs of @xmath3 as a function of @xmath4 ( such as 1 and 6 , and 2 and 3 ) , one sees that the uncertainties inferred from the gaussian fit ( which are similar for all fields ) agree roughly with the scatter between those fields , suggesting that they are reasonable estimates of the uncertainties .",
    "( one also sees that compared to the scatter along the curve , the error bars appear to be overestimates  this , however , is a consequence of the fact that the points are not independent , as the strips in @xmath4 overlap . )",

    "field  1 is offset by 15  to the east , and the other fields are placed anti - clockwise with increasing number ( see inset ) . ]",
    "given the inhomogeneity in reddening , we checked whether chosing a smaller field would yield a tighter fit .",
    "figure  [ central ] shows a comparison of the results for the original set of 9999 stars around 1e  1048.1@xmath25937 with the results for just the central one - third of those stars , as well as , for comparison , for a randomly chosen one - third of the stars .",
    "interesting behavior is seen in the randomly - chosen curve : generally it follows the curve of the original sample ( with increased error bars ) , but around @xmath35 the inferred @xmath10 color decreases a little and is lower than inferred from the original sample .",
    "this is due to the competition between the two areas with different reddening in the field . with fewer stars ,",
    "the fit is more liable to jump from one over - density to the other .",
    "for the central sub - sample , however , this does not occur .",
    "instead , it shows consistently lower reddening than the original sample at all values of @xmath4 .",
    "the errors are only slightly larger , since the smaller number of stars is offset by the smaller spread in the colors of the red - clump stars .    from our tests , we conclude that in the field of 1e  1048.1@xmath25937 a dark cloud towards the north obscures some fraction of area within the 114 radius covered by the original 9999 stars , but it does not cover the source and hence should be ignored in determining the run of reddening with distance .    more generally , we conclude that , since our aim is not to determine accurately the _ average _ reddening in the field , but rather to find the reddening at the center of the field only , we should use the minimum number of stars required for our method to work reliably .",
    "empirically , we find that this is @xmath36 stars ; with fewer stars , the red - clump peak becomes poorly defined due to small - number statistics .    in the case that there remains substantial inhomogeneity within the small field under examination",
    "( this is certainly possible , but it turns out not the case for the axp fields ) , we must raise an important caveat to the use of the method .",
    "because the over - desity finding rutine picks the best gaussian feature out of the color histograms , it will be biased towards the more homogenous part of the field .",
    "if the field is highly inhomogenous , it may not be able to locate the red - clump satisfactoraly ; if a compact dense cloud obscures part of the field , then the method will give the reddening of the unobscured part of the field , since the cloud will have strong column density gradients across it .",
    "5937 for different subsamples",
    "( see inset ) .",
    "the curves have been slightly offset in @xmath4 for clarity . ]",
    "the next effect we checked is that of the choice of the size and overlap of the bins in @xmath4 . in order to have as high a distance resolution as possible",
    ", one would like to use bins in @xmath4 that are as small as possible . in order for the red - clump peak",
    "to be better defined on each histogram , however , one would prefer more stars and a narrower distribution of red - clump star colors . as discussed above ,",
    "increasing the field size in order to use more stars does not help since the reddening may be non - uniform .",
    "the same is true for increasing the k - bin sizes : different colors from different distances will tend to blur the red - clump peak .",
    "since in this case this also comes at the cost of reduced distance resolution , we opt for bin sizes as small as possible which still give reliable results : 0.6mag , with steps of 0.2mag .",
    "the overlap factor does not change the results or our method , but it is convenient computationally and also allows us to determine slightly more accurately the locations of jumps in reddening .    5937 , from du pont imaging .",
    "the du pont sources are shown as black circles , and the 2mass points ( from the closest 3300 stars ) as crosses . ]",
    "the final thing we checked is the effect of the 2mass limiting magnitudes on our measurements .",
    "our precise estimate of the distance of 1e  1048.1@xmath25937 from 2mass data alone is uncertain , because the last point in our graph of @xmath3 versus @xmath4 is likely affected by the incompleteness to fainter and to redder sources . to check for this , we obtained further , deeper jk infrared imaging data from the wide - field infrared camera on the du pont 2.5 m telescope , las campanas ( see persson et al .",
    "we subtracted a sky frame from each image using the median of the science frames ( this is required because of an additive component to the noise from fringing ) , registered and stacked the images .",
    "we tied the photometry directly to 2mass using many stars cross - identified on each of the chips .",
    "figure [ dupont ] shows the new , deeper color - magnitude diagram for stars in the field of 1e  1048.1@xmath25937 .",
    "this includes stars from the chip containing the axp and two adjacent chips ( each chip has a size 200  square ) .",
    "one sees that down to @xmath37 , @xmath38 , which corresponds to the last reliable red - clump location from the 2mass data , the du pont and 2mass data are consistent , having overdensities at the same colour .",
    "however , for the next group , at @xmath39 , @xmath40 , the du pont data indicate a location redder than the 2mass data would have suggested .",
    "thus we conclude that the reddening rises more quickly in this region , and the axp is closer than otherwise would have seemed .",
    "we show the @xmath3 values obtained from the du pont data in figure [ central ] and use these for the final point on the reddening curve for 1e 1048.1@xmath25937 in figure [ output ] .",
    "as mentioned above , the challenges faced in the field of 1e  1048.1@xmath25937 are more severe than those for any of the other fields ; none show reddening gradients as large , and for all the other sources ( except 1e  2259 + 586 , see  [ results ] ) the appropriate value of the color excess lies either well before or beyond the completeness limit . using what we have learned here , we perform our analysis on the central 3300 stars near each axp , and infer uncertainties using the simple estimate from counting statistics .",

    "hence , for these three axps , we use the extinction estimates compiled in woods & thompson ( 2004 ) .",

    "first , above we implicity converted photo - electric absorption edges by metals to an equivalent hydrogen column @xmath43 , and that in turn to visual extinction @xmath33 .",
    "this is not as uncertain as it appears , however , since the relation of predehl & schmitt ( 1995 ) between x - ray and visual extinction , while quoted in terms of hydrogen column @xmath43 , was based on x - ray measurements that were sensitive to metals along the line of sight , not hydrogen , just like ours .",
    "hence , there is no uncertainty associated with , e.g. , the metallicity or the hydrogen to dust ratio .",
    "a second worry one might have is about selective extinction , i.e. , variations in the interstellar extinction law ( usually parametrised by @xmath44 ) .",
    "there is , however , far less variation in the infrared ( e.g. , mathis 1990 ) .",
    "since the optical extinction estimates of predehl & schmitt were largely based on a standard extinction law , we should thus circumvent any problems at visual wavelengths by using the same standard relation between infrared and visual extinction .",

    "a resolution to the distance discrepancy would thus be that the foreground cloud , including the `` arm '' which partially covers ctb 109 , is indeed involved in streaming motion , but that ctb  109 is interacting with a background cloud unconnected with the first .",
    "if this background cloud is not associated with the streaming motion , but follows the standard rotation curve ( @xmath94 , @xmath95kpc ) , then its distance is @xmath96kpc , which is consistent with our estimate for the distance of 1e  2259 + 589 .    finally , as an independent check , we note that the wolf - rayet star wr  158 , which is at an angular separation of 6.1 , has a spectroscopic distance of @xmath53kpc and extinction @xmath97 ( van der hucht , 2001 ) .",

    "another possibility would be that the magnetic field strengths are roughly dipolar , but offset from the center ( as typically inferred for magnetic white dwarfs and ap stars ; e.g. , wickramasinghe & ferrario 2000 ) .",
    "if so , the axps with the largest pulsed fractions might have the largest offsets , for which the effects of partial overlap between polar caps might lead to smaller effective radii .",

    "if the emission source for the thermal component is the same as it is for the axps , this suggests that the non - thermal component is powered at least partly from another , additional reservoir of energy .",
    "for instance , the energy could be stored in a large magnetic twist imparted during the previous gamma - ray bursting phase .",

    "1e  2258 + 586 falls near the end of the outer arm , known to exist in this direction beyond the perseus arm ( e.g. , kimeswenger & weinberger 1989 ) .    from our distances , we infer 210kev luminosities and we find that these cluster tightly around @xmath112 , consistent with the prediction in the context of the magnetar model that a saturating luminosity must exist above which rapid internal neutrino cooling is effective .",
    "furthermore , we calculated effective emitting radii for the thermal components in the x - ray spectra , and find that these are inversely correlated with temperature , while the corresponding areas are inversely proportional to the pulsed fraction .",
    "this suggests the internal heating is released predominantly through one or more hot polar caps , with sizes that differ between the different axps .",
    "the red - clump method can be applied to any line of sight in the galactic plane , and is particularly useful combined with reddening estimates from x - ray spectroscopy .",
    "more accurate results may be obtained using deeper infrared imaging of selected fields , although , unfortunately , it may not be possible to extend the method to regions with very high reddening , since the red clump stars may well become confused with highly reddened main - sequence stars . as a result of the latter limitation",
    ", the method may not be generally useful for the other class of magnetars , the soft gamma - ray repeaters , which generally suffer very high extinction .",
    "it should be useful , however , for point sources such as the compact central objects .",
    "generally , for further analysis of distances and structure within the milky way , it would be useful to cross - calibrate results from the red - clump method with those from x - ray absorption studies , x - ray dust scattering haloes , and and co measurements .    *",

    "we thank david kaplan for pointing out the paper describing the red - clump method to us , and martin lpez - corredoira for information on the applicability of the red - clump method .",
    "we also thank bryan gaensler for help with interpreting co and data and for discussions about 1e  1048.1@xmath25937 , manami sasaki and terrance gaetz for discussing the case of ctb  109 , and tom dame and peter martin for general discussions of galactic gas and dust .",

    "<S> we identify `` red clump stars ''  core helium - burning giants  among 2mass stars and use them to measure the run of reddening with distance in the direction of each of the galactic anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axp ) . </S>",
    "<S> we combine this with extinction estimates from x - ray spectroscopy to infer distances and find that the locations of all axp are consistent with being in galactic spiral arms . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that the 210kev luminosities implied by our distances are remarkably similar for all axp , being all around @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , using our distances to estimate effective black - body emitting radii , we find that the radii are tightly anti - correlated with pulsed fraction , and somewhat less tightly anti - correlated with black - body temperature . </S>",
    "<S> we find no obvious relationship of any property with the dipole magnetic field strength inferred from the spin - down rate . </S>"
