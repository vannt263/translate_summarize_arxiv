    "both theoretical models @xcite and observations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) suggest that it is common for supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) in galactic centres to form binaries that gradually lose their energy through radiating gravitational waves ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "numerical simulations of black hole ( bh ) binary mergers ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) suggest that the merger remnant smbhs receive a recoil velocity of typically several hundred ( and in some spin and mass - ratio configurations up to thousands ) of km / s , due to highly anisotropic gravitational - wave emission in the final merger phase .",
    "taking into account the spatial distribution of mass in the galactic centre region , and corresponding dynamical friction , this means that the smbh can engage in a damped oscillating motion @xcite with an amplitude comparable to , or exceeding the @xmath20(10 - 100 pc ) size of the optically thick dusty molecular torus ( ` dust torus ' ) believed to be surrounding galactic centres ( for an overview , see @xcite ) . for a large recoil , the smbh can escape from the galactic centre and can remain wandering within the dark matter halo @xcite",
    ". as accreting material can stay gravitationally bound to the moving smbh , and thus the smbh can remain active for @xmath21 yr after the merger event ( e.g. @xcite ) , kinematic and spatial signatures of the recoil could be found in the spectra of quasars ( qsos ; see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "these signatures could confirm the gravitational recoil of merger remnant smbhs , and could probe the smbh binary parameters , recoil trajectory models , as well as the spatial distribution and composition of matter in the galactic centre region .    in this paper , we propose that in the presence of dust tori obscuring galactic nuclei , the gravitational recoil of active merger remnant smbhs should introduce a correlation between dust column mass densities along the line of sight ( @xmath1 ) and magnitudes of line - of - sight peculiar velocities of smbhs relative to their host galaxies ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "proxies to estimate both of these quantities can be measured from observable features of qso spectra @xcite . as pointed out earlier by @xcite",
    ", recoiling bhs can spend a significant fraction of their time off - nucleus , possibly reducing the fraction of fully obscured ( ` type ii ' ) qsos ; we also follow up on this suggestion .    using a selected combination of models of gravitational recoil , smbh trajectories , and obscuring dust tori",
    ", we demonstrate the feasibility of detecting @xmath1@xmath0 correlations by simulating a set of @xmath2 random observations of recoiled qsos with a monte carlo method .",
    "we characterize the strength of correlation between @xmath1 and @xmath0 for obscured ( i.e. @xmath3 ) qsos in two different @xmath0 intervals , and estimate the number of obscured qsos that could be used to reject the hypothesis of no correlation between @xmath1 and @xmath0 with @xmath13 significance .",
    "as the strength of the correlation between @xmath1 and @xmath0 , as well as the underlying @xmath22 relation depends on the presumed combination of models , observational studies on qso spectra could provide an opportunity for testing chosen combinations of these models .",
    "we also calculate the fraction of qsos obscured by their dust tori , @xmath17@xmath16 , which , compared to the observed fraction of type ii ( i.e. obscured ) qsos could provide an independent test for a chosen combination of recoil , smbh trajectory , and dust tori models .",
    "we propose to use the sdss - dr10 quasar catalog @xcite to perform these tests in the near future , and will report on this observational search in a separate publication .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in   [ sec : dynamics ] , we describe the gravitational recoil and smbh trajectory models we used in our monte carlo simulations . in   [ sec : torus ] , we describe our implementation of a smooth dust torus model .",
    "we present our results in   [ sec : results ] and discuss some issues that will be relevant for an observational search for the proposed correlations in ",

    "finally , we offer our conclusions and summarize the implications of this work in   [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "anisotropic emission of gravitational waves emitted by coalescing smbhs carry away linear momentum , resulting in a recoil of the merger remnant smbh in the opposite direction . numerical simulations of this process have been carried out for merging smbhs with equal and unequal masses , zero and non - zero spins aligned or counter - aligned with the orbital angular momentum , and with spins pointing in random directions with equal probability ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .    to keep our monte carlo simulation as general and realistic , but at the same time , as computationally cheap as possible ,",
    "following @xcite , we adopted the analytical formulae given in equation ( 4 ) of @xcite to construct the distribution of recoil velocity magnitudes , @xmath23 ( note that @xcite gives results very similar to more recent , slightly modified formulae in @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the direction of the recoil velocity depends on the orientation of the spin and orbital angular momentum vectors .",
    "it is plausible that prior to merger , the bhs accrete a significant amount of gas coherently from a circumbinary accretion disc , whose inner regions are aligned with the binary s orbital plane ( e.g @xcite ) .",
    "one then expects that the spin angular momentum vectors at the time of the merger may be aligned with the orbital angular momentum of the binary ( @xcite ; although there could still be significant misalignment at merger for fast - spinning and unequal - mass binaries ; @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the kick direction may not be random , and may lie preferentially in the plane of the circumbinary disc ( and also in the binary orbital plane ) . however , we emphasize that here we are interested only in the kick direction relative to the orientation of the larger scale nuclear torus .",
    "it is much less clear whether the binary orbital plane and/or accretion disc is aligned with the symmetry plane of this torus .",
    "this depends on the transfer of angular momentum between large ( 100 pc ) and small ( sub - parsec ) scales , which is sensitive to turbulence , star formation , and feedback processes @xcite .",
    "observationally , parsec - scale maser discs ( which could be taken as proxies for the accretion discs that determine the kick direction ) appear to be oriented randomly with respect to the plane of their host galaxies @xcite .",
    "we therefore simply assume that the kick direction is random , i.e. not aligned with the symmetry plane of the torus .",
    "thus , we chose directions of recoil velocities randomly from a uniform distribution covering a whole sphere .    using the fitting formulae of @xcite , we calculated @xmath23 for a given pair of masses ( @xmath24 ) and dimensionless spin vectors of the merging smbhs ( @xmath25 , where @xmath26 are the spins of the smbhs , @xmath27 is speed of light , and @xmath28 is newton s constant ) .",
    "observations of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) indicate that a significant number of smbhs have @xmath29 , although a second population of smbhs with @xmath30 was found for @xmath31 smbhs ( see @xcite ) . in our simulations , for simplicity , we first assigned each merging smbh to one of the two @xmath32 populations with equal probability , and then drew a random @xmath32 value from the corresponding ( i.e. @xmath33 $ ] or @xmath34 $ ] ) interval .",
    "the directions of both spin vectors were chosen independently from a uniform distribution covering a whole sphere .",
    "we randomized pairs of masses independently from the smbh mass function given in @xcite , downscaled both mass values by a factor of 2 , and used them as values for @xmath35 and @xmath36 . the fact that we chose the mass of the merger remnant as @xmath37 means that in our monte carlo simulations @xmath38 values are under - represented at the lowest ( @xmath39 ) and at the highest ( @xmath40 ) values , and overrepresented at values in between , compared to the smbh mass function given in @xcite .",

    "this model assumes that the smbh is embedded in a spherical stellar bulge , and is decelerated by dynamical friction .",

    "title=\"fig:\",width=317 ] +    @xcite followed the motions of merger remnant smbhs with fixed masses in various configurations of dark matter haloes using numerical simulations .",
    "they concluded that due to the asymmetric and inhomogeneous mass distribution in the halo , the smbh trajectories suffer large deviations from the @xcite trajectories .",
    "smbhs might not even return to the galactic centre , after the smbhs reach the first turning point in their oscillating motion . to check",
    "how much this could affect the results of our monte carlo simulations , we simulated an independent set of @xmath59 qsos , and examined the fraction of smbhs that reach the first turning point before the mock observation is made .",
    "we found that for the entire qso sample , this fraction is @xmath60 per cent , while it is reduced to @xmath61 and @xmath62 per cent for qsos with @xmath63 and @xmath64 , respectively .",
    "the reason for the full population having a higher fraction is that once the smbhs make their first u  turn , their orbits decay rapidly due to dynamical friction . as a result , many of these end up with @xmath65 and @xmath66 at the mock observation time ( as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rv ] ) .",
    "as we will show in   [ sec : results ] below , only qsos with @xmath67 show a @xmath1@xmath0 correlation .",
    "furthermore , below we propose to study only the subset of qsos with @xmath5 , due to the limitations imposed by inevitable random velocity errors .",
    "we conclude that in this sub - sample of qsos , the effects of asphericity and inhomogeneities will reduce the predicted correlations only by @xmath68 per cent , and we ignore this complication in the rest of this paper .",
    "a similar deviation from a purely radial trajectory may arise on much smaller scales , inside the spherical nuclear star cluster ( stellar core ) enshrouding the galactic centre . as shown by @xcite , when the smbh mass is not negligible compared to the mass of the stellar core , the smbh and the stellar core exhibit oscillations about their common centre of mass . as a result",
    ", the smbh is not exposed to the largest dynamical friction near the geometric centre of the core , and it may take up to @xmath69 times longer for the oscillations to be damped . here , we neglect this effect , leaving its evaluation to future work .",
    "however , we note that it would likely result in a larger fraction of smbhs remaining displaced from the nucleus , and possibly a larger fraction of qsos exhibiting the correlations we propose .",
    "according to the unified scheme of agns , galactic nuclei are obscured by optically and geometrically thick dusty molecular tori , with the amount of obscuration depending on the viewing angle @xcite . even though dust typically only constitutes @xmath70 per cent of the mass of the tori ( while the rest of the mass is in gas , mostly in molecular hydrogen form ) , dust is the main component responsible for the obscuration and reddening of qsos , and thus , most torus models focus on the dust distribution in the tori ( i.e. on ` dust tori ' ) .",
    "torus models developed to reproduce the observed spectral energy distributions of agns can be divided into two categories : smooth versus clumpy models ( for an overview , see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we implemented a hydrostatic model of smooth dust tori presented by @xcite .",
    "this model has the advantages of simplicity , using physically reasonable assumptions about torus formation , and providing good fits to the mid - infrared spectral energy distributions of agns with relatively few free parameters .",
    "the dust torus is assumed to form from gas released through stellar winds and ejection of planetary nebulae in the nuclear star cluster .",
    "even though the ejecta of individual stars should produce a cloudy structure of the torus , no instruments so far has been able to resolve single clouds of the dust distribution , and @xcite conclude that these clouds should be small . for simplicity , they treat the torus as a continuous medium characterized by the density distribution @xmath71 ( see their equation 8) . the effective potential created by the central smbh and the angular momentum distribution in the stellar",

    "we attribute this to the fact that in more massive galaxies , the recoiling bhs spend longer times at off - centre distances comparable to the size of the obscuring torus .",

    "we plan to present the results from a search in the sdss dr10 data base in a forthcoming publication .    here",
    "we address two natural caveats : while proxies can be used to estimate both @xmath1 and @xmath0 , these estimates will have uncertainties we have so far ignored .",
    "although we have no a priori reason to expect that these uncertainties will be correlated , they will represent noise , which will reduce the statistical significance of any correlation , and thus increase the number of qsos required for a detection .",
    "furthermore , we have so far assumed that a clean qso sub - sample with @xmath3 and @xmath208 can be constructed .",
    "more realistically , observational errors will pollute any such selection ( e.g. qsos with @xmath5 can be missed , and qsos with @xmath66 can be mistakenly included ) .",
    "the line - of - sight velocity offset ( @xmath0 ) can be estimated using the centroids or peaks of broad lines , relative to those of the narrow lines .",
    "the level of obscuration ( @xmath1 ) can be estimated using qso colours : a larger obscuring column should result in a redder continuum ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "an alternative proxy for the obscuring column could be the equivalent width of the broad lines themselves .",
    "although the geometry of the broad line region is not fully understood , type ii quasars have weak or no broad emission lines . in the standard unified model of agn @xcite , this is attributed to the obscuration of the high - velocity broad - line region by the dusty torus ( note that the continuum is still visible and can therefore not be spatially colocated with the broad - line emitting region ) .",

    ", title=\"fig:\",width=317 ] +    similarly to the errors in @xmath0 , we have studied the impact of errors in @xmath1 . here",
    ", there are several potential concerns .",
    "first , in the presence of uncertainties , a sharp selection @xmath3 is unrealistic .",
    "secondly , for large obscuring columns , with @xmath1 comparable to the maximum possible column density of a half - torus according to the @xcite model ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : nh_vs_vr ] ) , @xmath224 ( i.e. for configurations corresponding to true type ii qsos ) , the broad lines may be undetectable , or may have too low s / n for a reliable centroid measurement .",
    "we here repeated our fiducial analysis , except that we replaced the selection criterion @xmath3 by the range @xmath225 .",
    "we chose @xmath226 and @xmath227 .",
    "the number of qsos within this range ( and also satisfying @xmath228 km / s as before ) is @xmath229 , or @xmath230 per cent of the full sample of @xmath204 qsos . with this cut , we find that the correlations remain significant : @xmath231 for the @xmath1@xmath6 correlation , with a @xmath137-value of @xmath232 .",
    "we also evaluated the impact of random gaussian errors in @xmath233 with a standard deviation of @xmath234 .",
    "the results are similar to those shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : v - error ] : we find that @xmath211 decreases , and the minimum number of qsos required to detect the correlation between @xmath235 and @xmath6 ( @xmath160 ) increases with @xmath234 . for the case of @xmath236 , we find @xmath237 , with a @xmath137-value of @xmath238 , and @xmath239 . thus , random gaussian errors in @xmath233 have a very small effect on the @xmath235@xmath6 correlation .",
    "based on the above , we conclude that statistical errors on estimating the velocity offsets and obscuring column densities can diminish the correlations predicted in the idealized toy model .",
    "this is mostly due to the impact of these errors on the purity of selection of a sub - sample , intended to include only the most correlated qsos . in the examples above",
    ", we find that this increases the number of qsos required for a detection by an order of magnitude , but there is no indication that these errors will prevent a detection of the correlations in a large sample ( tens of thousands ) of qsos .",
    "finally , as the distribution of smbh masses in qsos observable in different survey projects may vary significantly , we have considered how using higher smbh masses ( see @xcite and @xcite ) affect our results . in these tests ,",
    "we have also taken into account the possibility of a correlation between the smbh mass and the mass of the stellar core @xcite .",
    "we have found that the increased smbh masses lead fewer smbhs escaping the galactic nucleus ( an effect that should increase the number of smbhs in the population showing @xmath1@xmath0 correlation ) , however they also lead to significantly smaller torus sizes , resulting with a net decrease in the correlation coefficient of a factor of @xmath240 .",
    "this demonstrates that although the strength of the @xmath1@xmath0 is sensitive to the underlying assumptions of the applied models , the @xmath1@xmath0 correlation itself is a robust result .",
    "a large fraction of luminous qsos are believed to be triggered by merger events , and if qso activity often follows the coalescence of smbhs in the merging nuclei , then a large fraction of all qsos may have experienced recent gravitational recoil . while a handful of qsos with large spatial or velocity offsets have been identified as recoil candidates @xcite , the ubiquity of this phenomenon remains poorly known .    here , we proposed a statistical technique to search for a population of recoiling smbhs with smaller velocity offsets among luminous qsos , based on a positive correlation between these velocity offsets and the column densities of obscuring dust tori .",
    "the correlations are introduced by the damped oscillating motions of smbhs with typical recoil speeds , which are comparable to the escape velocities from galactic nuclei .",
    "these smbhs spend a significant time off - nucleus , and at distances comparable to the size of obscuring tori in located in the nuclei .",
    "we have demonstrated , using simple models of gravitational recoil , smbh trajectories , and the geometry of obscuring dust tori , that observing a random sample of a few thousand partially obscured qsos , with line - of - sight velocity offsets @xmath12 , could allow a significant detection of the correlation between the line of sight dust column density @xmath1 and @xmath0 ( or @xmath6 ) .",
    "the existence of this correlation is found to be robust within the simple models we choose , and detectable even in the face of random errors on @xmath1 and @xmath0 .",
    "however , we expect that the tightness of the correlation , the underlying @xmath241 relation , and the properties of the qso subset showing correlations can depend strongly on the model assumptions",
    ". nevertheless , our results should motivate searching for correlations in real data ; a positive detection would allow testing various combinations of recoil , bh trajectory , and dust tori models",
    ". a further test could be possible by comparing the predicted fraction of obscured qsos to the observed fraction of type ii qsos .",
    "we propose to carry out these tests in the future using catalogues of observational data for qsos , such as the sdss - dr10 qso catalogue .",
