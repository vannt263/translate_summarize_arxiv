    "the existence of three almost identical generations of quarks and leptons suggests a new quantum number to distinguish them , a quantum number that arises from a new symmetry commonly known as horizontal symmetry . in order to account for mass differences of the three generations and their mixing ,",
    "the symmetry must be broken , usually assumed spontaneously .",
    "the standard approach is to pick a horizontal symmetry group @xmath1 , often a finite group to avoid the appearance of goldstone particles , assign irreducible representations under that group to various left - handed and right - handed fermions , as well as the scalar particles ( higgs ) needed to break the symmetry .",
    "yukawa couplings invariant under @xmath1 are constructed , vacuum expectation values of the higgs are assigned to break the symmetry , and mass matrices are read out from the broken lagrangian .",
    "the mass matrices so obtained depend on various parameters : the yukawa coupling constants and the vacuum expectation values .",
    "these parameters are then adjusted to fit the masses and experimental mixing parameters obtained from these mass matrices .",
    "the regularity of neutrino mixing has aroused intense interest in recent years ; various symmetry groups have been invoked to explain it .",
    "they include @xmath2 , and others .",
    "because of the presence of numerous adjustable parameters in each case , it is difficult to tell how much of the success in explaining the mixing is due to the symmetry invoked , and how much is due to parameter fitting . in an attempt to settle this question ,",
    "i proposed some time ago two criteria , demanding that    * symmetry  of  the  mass  matrices  should  be + * symmetries  of  the  horizontal  symmetry  group  , [ c1]and * vacuum  alignments  should  be  assigned  to  satisfy  .[c2 ] * * *    we will see in the next section that the symmetry of the mass matrices ( ` residual symmetry ' ) can be determined from the mixing matrix .",
    "consequently the minimal horizontal group @xmath1 is , according to , just the group generated by the residual symmetries obtained from the mixing matrix .",
    "moreover , if symmetry breaking is carried out according to , then the mixing matrix is automatically recovered provided the residual symmetry is ` non - degenerate ' . in that case , the remaining free parameters are the yukawa coupling constants , and they are used exclusively to fit the masses . if the residual symmetry is not ` non - degenerate ' , then some free parameters may have to be used to fit the mixing matrix as well .    given a mixing matrix , it should be noted that the horizontal symmetry @xmath1 is not unique for three reasons .",
    "first , if @xmath1 satisfies , then any group containing @xmath1 also satisfies .",
    "this kind of non - uniqueness is not serious because , for the sake of economy , one usually uses the smallest group anyway unless there is a good reason not to .",
    "secondly , for reasons to be explained in the next section , the residual symmetry itself is not unique , but as long as it is ` non - degenerate ' , we will recover the mixing matrix automatically whatever the corresponding @xmath1 is .",
    "thirdly , the symmetry group @xmath1 so deduced is strictly speaking only the symmetry group of the left - handed fermions .",
    "it can however be taken to be the symmetry group of all the fermions and the local lagrangian , if we assign the right - handed fermions to transform like the left - handed fermions .",
    "let @xmath3 denote the charged leptons , the neutrinos , the up - type and the down - type quarks , and @xmath4 their corresponding @xmath5 dirac mass matrices , connecting left - handed to right - handed fermions .",
    "it is important to note that fermion masses and mixings can already be obtained by diagonalizing the left - handed to left - handed mass matrices @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) and @xmath8 , assuming the active neutrinos to be given by a type - i see - saw mechanism , with a right - handed majorana mass matrix @xmath9 .",
    "for that reason we can not possibly deduce any information on the symmetry of the right - handed fermions just from masses and mixing .",
    "from now on we shall deal with the mass matrices @xmath10 exclusively until the last section .",
    "i shall concentrate on explaining how to obtain the residual symmetries of the left - handed leptons from the mixing matrix .",
    "the procedure in the quark sector is similar .",
    "let @xmath11 be the pmns mixing matrix , with @xmath12 standing for the @xmath13th column of @xmath14 .",
    "it is the matrix to diagonalize @xmath15 in the basis where @xmath16 is diagonal .",
    "each @xmath14 gives rise to three different unitary symmetry operators @xmath17 of the neutrino mass matrix , satisfying @xmath18 , and given by the formula g_i = u_iu_i^t-(u_ju_j^t+u_ku_k^t)(i=1,2,3),[g]where @xmath19 are the other two indices different from @xmath13 .",
    "for the mixing matrix in the tri - bimaximal form u=1    2&&0 + -1 & & + -1&&-    , [ tribi]these three symmetry operators are g_1&=&13    1&-2&-2 + -2&-2&1 + -2&1&-2    , g_2=-131&-2&-2 - 2&1&-2 - 2&-2&1,g_3=-1&0&00&0&10&1&0.[g]a variance and relaxation of the tri - bimaximal mixing is to assume only one of its columns to be firmly known , with the other two parameterized subject only to unitarity .",
    "if only the @xmath13th column of the tri - bimaximal matrix is firmly known , then the residual symmetry is given by a single @xmath17 .",
    "for @xmath20 , bimaximal mixing is present but trimaximal mixing may not . for @xmath21 , trimaximal mixing is present but bimaximal mixing may not . for @xmath22 , there is no good name for it but for easiness of referral we will just call it ` unimaximal mixing ' for now .",
    "we turn to the charged - lepton sector where @xmath16 is diagonal , and denote its unitary symmetry opeators by @xmath23 .",
    "they satisfy @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "any diagonal unitary matrix is a solution and hence a qualified symmetry operator .",
    "let me divide these solutions into two categories , non - degenerate , and degenerate .",
    "the former refers to cases when all three diagonal entries of @xmath23 are different , and the latter refers to the situation in which two of the entries are the same .",
    "the significance of this division will become clear in a moment .    using ,",
    "a minimal @xmath1 is simply the group generated by @xmath23 and @xmath26 , where @xmath23 is one of the charged lepton residual symmetries , and @xmath26 denotes collectively all the known residual symmetries in the neutrino sector .",
    "we can always obtain a larger @xmath1 by taking several @xmath23 s as generators , but usually it is the smallerst that we want .",
    "if we take @xmath27 , with @xmath28 , then @xmath29 , and the minimal horizontal symmetry groups can be shown to be    1 .",
    "@xmath30 for tri - bimaximal mixing .",
    "2 .   @xmath31 for unimaximal mixing .",
    "3 .   @xmath32 for trimaximal mixing .",
    "4 .   @xmath33 for bimaximal mixing .",
    "moreover , it can be shown that as long as @xmath23 is non - degenerate , then @xmath34 .",
    "let me stress that this theorem is based only on the physically reasonable criterion of , and not some other criterion that has been incorrectly quoted in the literature .",
    "let @xmath35 be the lagrangian density invariant under some horizontal symmetry group .",
    "after integrating out the right - handed fermions , we obtain an effective lagrangian density @xmath36 consisting of the left - handed leptons @xmath37 , the ( possibly composite ) higgs fields @xmath38 in the charged lepton section , and the higgs fields @xmath39 in the neutrino sector .",
    "@xmath40 is invariant under the left - handed symmetry group @xmath1 determine previously .",
    "note that the effective lagrangian may not even be local , but that does not matter because all that concerns us is its invariance under the left - handed symmetry group @xmath1 .",
    "is used to determine the vacuum alignments when @xmath41 is broken . if @xmath36 is to remain invariant under the residual symmetries , then to satisfy the vacuum alignments must obey f^a=,g^a=[fgvev]for every irreducible representation @xmath42 of @xmath1 , where @xmath43 are the irreducible representation of @xmath44 , and @xmath45 are the irreducible representations of @xmath46 .    with the vacuum alignments satisfying , the residual symmetries of the original mixing matrix are preserved .",
    "if @xmath23 is non - degenerate and diagonal , then the original mixing matrix is automatically recovered for the following reason . since @xmath16 commutes with @xmath23 , the non - degeneracy of @xmath23 guarantees that @xmath16 is diagonal when @xmath23 is .",
    "@xmath14 is then recovered by filling its columns by the eigenvectors of @xmath26 with @xmath47 eigenvalues .",
    "note that this is not necessarily correct if @xmath23 is degenerate , for then even in the representation when @xmath23 is diagonal , @xmath16 may not be , and a further rotation may be necessary to make it diagonal . in that case",
    "the @xmath14 so calculated is not yet the mixing matrix . for easiness of reference ,",
    "we repeat this conclusion below : * the  mixing  matrix  is  automatically  recovered  if  f  is  non - degenerate.[c3 ] + [ c3 ] *",
    "quark mixing is irregular , has small mixing angles , is hence completely unlike leptonic mixing .",
    "its left - handed symmetry group obtained from must also be very different from the lepton s .",
    "this is unpleasant , so it is natural to ask whether there is any way to accommodate quark mixing within the leptonic symmetry group @xmath1 .    if one is willing to abandon and/or in the quark sector , that could presumably be done by fitting .",
    "one then chooses quark representations , new higgs and new alignments if necessary , and use the tunable parameters to fit the quark data alone , or the quark and leptonic data together .",
    "there are some fairly successful models in the literature of this kind , giving a decent fit to existing quark and leptonic data .",
    "since the fit is usually not perfect , it is hard to pinpoint the origin of the success , and in exactly what way the chosen group @xmath1 and not some others is the real horizontal symmetry .    alternatively , one can try to retain , , and the same set of higgs fields , at the expense of giving up a full explanation of quark mixing in the lowest order .",
    "for example , one might try to accommodate cabibbo mixing in the lowest order , but leave out the smaller mixings with the third generation and attribute them to the effect of a higher order correction of vacuum alignments . in the rest of this section",
    ", we will discuss a simple example of this kind .",
    "the first question to settle is , if we adopt the same group @xmath1 , use the same higgs fields @xmath46 with the same vacuum alignments in the leptonic and the quark sectors , how come we do not up with the same mixing matrix for both ?",
    "after all , according to and , we expect the same residual symmetry to emerge from the same vacuum alignments , and according to , same residual symmetry leads to the same mixing matrix .",
    "the answer is that , whereas @xmath38 is the higgs for @xmath48 and @xmath39 is the higgs for @xmath49 in the leptonic sector , the higgs for @xmath50 and @xmath51 will both be @xmath38 in the quark sector .",
    "recall that the left - handed to left - handed mass matrices @xmath52 is related to the dirac mass matrices @xmath53 by @xmath6 for @xmath7 , but because of the see - saw mechanism for neutrino , the relation there is @xmath8 .",
    "it is therefore reasonable to choose the same higgs @xmath54 for @xmath55 , but a different one @xmath56 for @xmath49 .",
    "this however brings up another problem : if @xmath54 is used for @xmath50 and @xmath51 both , we should end up with no quark mixing whatsoever if applies .",
    "for that reason we will have to sidestep by using a degenerate @xmath23 to allow cabibbo mixing to be accommodated .",
    "the simplest degenerate @xmath23 is given by one of the following three : f_a = diag(1,-1,-1),f_b = diag(-1,1,-1),f_c = diag ( -1 , -1 , 1).[f]the left - handed leptonic symmetry groups generated by @xmath57 , and/or @xmath58 . and @xmath59 , and/or @xmath60 , can be computed in a straight forward manner .",
    "it turns out that if @xmath61 or @xmath62 is involved , the resulting group is infinite no matter which @xmath63 we choose .",
    "this leaves @xmath60 as the only possible residual symmetry in the leptonic sector .",
    "computation shows that @xmath64 , and both @xmath65 and @xmath66 give rise to the same group @xmath0 , the dihedral group with 8 elements , which contains both @xmath67 and @xmath58 . in order to have a non - trivial mixing , we choose the non - abelian group @xmath0 as @xmath1 .    before proceeding with the physics",
    "let us first summarize the relevant mathematical properties of the group .",
    "@xmath0 has five classes @xmath68 , containing the following elements : @xmath69 .",
    "the group has four 1-dimensional irreducible representations , which we shall designate as @xmath70 , and one 2-dimensional irreducible representation @xmath71 .",
    "the irreducible representations in the basis where @xmath72 are diagonal are given by the left - hand table of below , in which @xmath73 are the pauli matrices .",
    "the defining representation of @xmath60 and @xmath63 shown in and can easily be seen to belong to @xmath74 .",
    "since the residual symmetries come from the mixing matrix of the left - handed leptons , the left - handed leptons themselves must also belong to @xmath74 , with the first generation in @xmath75 , and the second and third generations together in @xmath71 .",
    ", [ ir]both the character table and the clebsch - gordon ( cg ) series can be obtained from .",
    "the allowed clebsch - gordan series are shown on the right - hand table of .",
    "if the two doublets in @xmath76 are @xmath77 and @xmath78 , then a = a_1b_1+a_2b_2 ,  b = a_1b_2+a_2b_1 ,  c = a_1b_1-a_2b_2 ,  d = a_1b_2-a_2b_1.[cgc ]    now we have to decide whether @xmath67 , or @xmath58 , or both , is the residual symmetry in the @xmath48 sector . in order to be able to accommodate cabibbo mixing ,",
    "i claim that has to be @xmath58 for the following reason .",
    "once we pick a @xmath23 , the alignment of @xmath54 is fixed by and .",
    "since we have decided to use the same @xmath54 in the @xmath50 and @xmath51 sectors as well , it compels us also to use this same @xmath23 to be the residual symmetry in both quark sectors . if the first and the second diagonal entries of @xmath23 are the same , which is the case for @xmath58 , then is no longer valid , and @xmath79 no longer has to be diagonal in the 1,2 block .",
    "it is this non - diagonal nature that allows a cabibbo mixing of the first two generations to take place .",
    "neither @xmath67 nor @xmath80 has that property so they can not be used as residual symmetry operators unless we abandon cabibbo mixing .",
    "[ tvev]since we know the left - handed fermions to belong to @xmath74 , can be used to determine what irreducible multiplets of @xmath38 and @xmath39 the fermions can be coupled to in @xmath36 .",
    "taking into account which compels some allowed couplings to effectively vanish after symmetry breaking , we end up with the following coupling schemes of @xmath81 to @xmath54 ( left - hand table ) and @xmath49 to @xmath56 ( right - hand table ) ,      , [ elec]where the lower - case latin and greek letters are the coupling constants to the higgs field of an irreducible representation indicated by the corresponding upper case letter .",
    "for example , @xmath82 and @xmath83 are coupling constants for irreducible representation @xmath42 .",
    "more specifically , @xmath83 is the coupling constant of the @xmath84 term , and @xmath85 is the coupling constant of the @xmath86 term , where the bold letter represents the higgs representation , and the other two letters represents the fermions ( remember the first generation belongs to @xmath75 , the second and third generations belong to @xmath71 ) . @xmath87 and @xmath88 never appear because @xmath89 for @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "similarly , @xmath92 and @xmath51 never occurs because @xmath93 for @xmath94 and @xmath90 , according to .",
    "we have sufficient information now to write down @xmath36 and then the mass matrices under this @xmath0 scheme .",
    "the result is _",

    "[ mass]if we set the parameter @xmath95 , then @xmath16 is diagonal , and @xmath96 can be used to fit the charged - lepton masses .",
    "@xmath15 is 2 - 3 symmetric , has an invariant eigenvector @xmath97 , hence neutrino mixing is automatically bimaximal .",
    "this is expected because @xmath60 is a residual symmetry .",
    "the remaining four parameters in @xmath15 can be used to fit the neutrino masses and the remaining mixing angles .",
    "for example , if we set @xmath98 , then @xmath99 is an invariant eigenvector so trimaximal mixing is present . in that case",
    "the mixing matrix is tri - bimaximal , and the remaining three parameters can be used to fit the neutrino masses . in the quark sector , if we set @xmath100 , then @xmath101 is diagonal , and @xmath102 can be used to fit the down - quark masses .",
    "@xmath103 can then be used to fit the cabibbo angle , and @xmath104 the up - quark masses .",
    "we see therefore that @xmath105 can accommodate both tri - bimaximal neutrino mixing and the cabibbo mixing of quarks with the same set of higgs , without giving up the criteria and .",
    "this conclusion is reached without having to know how the right - handed fermions are doing .",
