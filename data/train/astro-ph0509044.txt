    "radial abundance gradients in the milky way disk are among the main constraints of models of the chemical evolution of the galaxy .",
    "the study of the gradients comprises the determination of their magnitudes along the disk , space variations and their time evolution ( see for example henry & worthey 1999 , maciel & costa 2003 ) .",
    "probably the most interesting property of the gradients is their time evolution , which is a distinctive constraint of recent chemical evolution models .",
    "maciel et al . ( 2003 ) suggested that the o / h gradient has been flattening during the last few gyr , on the basis of a large sample of planetary nebulae ( pn ) for which accurate abundances are available , and for which the ages of the progenitor stars have been individually estimated .",
    "this work has been recently extended ( maciel et al . 2005 ) to include the s / h ratio in planetary nebulae , [ fe / h ] metallicities from open clusters and cepheid variables , as well as some young objects , such as ob associations and hii regions .    in this work",
    ", we review the main characteristics of the work by maciel et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and analyze the uncertainties involved in the determination of the gradients . in particular , we investigate whether the derived uncertainties support either a systematic variation of the abundances with the galactocentric distance , as assumed by our work , or simply a dispersion of the abundances around some average value .",
    "the main results for the time variation of the gradients as derived from planetary nebulae , open clusters , and cepheids are shown in tables  1 and 2 . adopting average linear gradients , which can be taken as representative of the whole galactic disk ,",
    "the abundances can be written in the form      where @xmath2(o / h ) + 12 or @xmath2(s / h ) + 12 for pn , hii regions and ob stars , and @xmath3 [ fe / h ] for open clusters and cepheids . for planetary nebulae , we have taken into account both o / h and s / h determinations and evaluated the gradient in the galactic disk according to the ages of the progenitor stars . for comparison purposes",
    ", we can also derive the [ fe / h ] metallicities from the o / h abundances , on the basis of a [ fe / h ] @xmath4 o / h correlation derived for disk stars ( see maciel 2002 and maciel et al .",
    "2005 for details ) .",
    "the ages follow from the age - metallicity relation by edvardsson et al .",
    "( 1993 ) , which also depends on the galactocentric distance . in this way",
    ", we can divide the sample of pn into different age groups , each one having a characteristic gradient .",
    "table 1 shows representative examples of 3 age groups for o / h and 2 age groups for s / h .",
    "the table gives the gradient @xmath5 ( dex / kpc ) as defined by equation ( 1 ) .",
    "all gradients in this paper have been calculated assuming @xmath6 kpc for the galactocentric distance of the lsr . for detailed references on the pn data the reader",
    "is referred to maciel et al .",
    "( 2003 , 2005 ) .",
    "it should be mentioned that the pn age groups shown in table  1 are typical groups , arbitrarily defined .",
    "in fact , we have extended this procedure by taking into account a variety of definitions of the age groups , with similar results .",
    "column  2 of table  4 shows the estimated values of @xmath7  and @xmath8  [ within brackets ] assuming average values , that is , no linear variations .",
    "the results for pn show that the probability is very low in all cases , so that the data points are probably not distributed according to a gaussian distribution around some average value .",
    "however , it is interesting to note that , if we restrain the galactocentric distances to a smaller range , such as from @xmath9 kpc to 8 kpc , or @xmath10 kpc to 10 kpc , the probability @xmath8 increases , showing that , for a given galactocentric bin , the abundances show a better agreement with the gaussian distribution around some average value .    for the open clusters , the table shows a generally better agreement with the gaussian distribution around a mean value , both for the friel and chen samples , in agreement with our conclusions in sect .",
    "however , for cepheid variables we have the same results as for the pn , that is , the cepheid data are apparently not consistent with a gaussian distribution around a mean value .",
    "we can also estimate @xmath8 in each case taking into account the derived linear correlations which are displayed in tables  1 and 2 .",
    "here we have @xmath11 for the number of degrees of freedom , so that we can estimate @xmath7 and @xmath8  provided we have a reliable estimate of the uncertainty of the data . for planetary nebulae , recent discussions by pottasch et al .",
    "( 2005 ) of objects with iso data suggest that the abundances of the beststudied elements are probably correct within 20% , which corresponds to 0.10 dex for oxygen .",
    "this is probably a lower limit for other nebulae for which no infrared data is available , so that their abundances depend more heavily on ionization correction factors .",
    "we may then adopt @xmath12 dex for o / h and @xmath13 dex for s / h as realistic estimates for planetary nebulae .",
    "the latter can also be attributed to the open clusters , in view of the heterogeneity of the data and the use of photometric abundances . for cepheid variables , which have the best determinations , an average uncertainty",
    "@xmath14 seems appropriate .",
    "the results are shown in column  3 of table  4 , under the heading linear . again",
    "the probabiliy is given within brackets .",
    "we can see that in all cases the @xmath7  values are lower than the corresponding values for the averages , so that the probability @xmath8  is higher for the linear correlation than for the simple averages .",
    "in fact , these probabilities are very close to unity in most cases , especially if we consider the more realistic , higher uncertainties .",
    "it can also be seen that for cepheid variables the probability given in column  3 is essentially unity , reinforcing our conclusion about systematic abundance variations with the galactocentric distance ."
