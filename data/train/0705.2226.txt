    "when we look at the night sky , we see that galaxies seem to be arranged in a particular way .",
    "one might expect that galaxies would be distributed randomly , much as grains of sand would if you threw a handful across the floor , but instead , they seem to trace elegant structures ; galaxy clusters are connected to each other by long filaments , interspersed with large voids , where few or no galaxies are seen .",
    "the drivers behind the formation of these large - scale structures have been the subject of intense study and debate for over thirty years ; how did the universe go from being smooth and homogeneous just after the big bang to the clumpy , clustered universe we see today ?    at the core of current theories for the formation of these structures is the premise that the evolution of the total mass distribution is described by the gravitational collapse of primordial density fluctuations , and that this evolution is traced by the evolution of galaxies .",
    "overdense regions , or ` haloes ' , are predicted to undergo mergers to build haloes of increasing mass , with galaxies forming from the baryonic matter in these haloes .",
    "this framework of ` biased ' hierarchical buildup @xcite has proven to be remarkably successful in explaining several important aspects of galaxy and large - scale structure formation .",
    "this paradigm is however not without its problems .",
    "a good example of these problems concerns the evolution of massive ( @xmath6 ) galaxies .",
    "we might expect that massive galaxies form slowly , with many halo mergers needed to build up the required large baryon reservoirs , and indeed some galaxies do appear to form in this way @xcite .",
    "there is however evidence that many massive galaxies may form at high redshift @xcite and on short timescales @xcite , directly counter to early , ` naive ' model predictions .",
    "intriguingly , recent surveys ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have uncovered a huge population of distant , ir bright sources that are plausible candidates for being rapidly forming , massive galaxies , however they are so numerous that even recent models have difficulty in explaining their counts , and invoke a wide variety of solutions ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "it seems likely therefore that there are strong , but subtle links between distant , ir / sub - mm bright galaxies , and the formation of large - scale structures .",
    "therefore , we need observations that relate the properties of these galaxies with the underlying dark matter distribution . motivated by this",
    ", we have used data from the spitzer wide area infrared extragalactic survey ( swire , @xcite ) to select large samples of distant ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs , l@xmath7l@xmath8 ) and study their clustering evolution with redshift .",
    "we assume @xmath9 km s@xmath10 mpc@xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 .",
    "the results presented here were originally published in @xcite .",
    "to select high redshift ulirgs , we use the 1.6@xmath13 m emission feature , which arises due to photospheric emission from evolved stars .",
    "when this feature is redshifted into one of the irac channels then that channel exhibits a ` bump ' @xcite . a complete discussion of the source selection and characterization methods is given in lonsdale et al 2006 ( in preparation ) , which we summarize here .",
    "our sources are taken from the elais n1 and elais n2 fields , and the lockman hole , covering 20.9 square degrees in total .",
    "we first selected those sources fainter than r=22 ( vega ) , and brighter than 400@xmath13jy at 24@xmath13 m . within this set , we selected two samples that displayed a ` bump ' in the 4.5@xmath13 m and 5.8@xmath13 m channels , i.e. where @xmath14 for one sample ( the ` b2 ' sample ) and where @xmath15 for the other sample ( the ` b3 ' sample ) .",
    "this resulted in a total of 1689 b2 sources and 1223 b3 sources .",
    "for both samples we used hyper - z @xcite to estimate redshifts , the results from which place most of the b2 sources within @xmath0 , and most of the b3 sources within @xmath16 . from the best fits we also derived ir luminosities and power sources ; the requirement that the sources have @xmath17jy demands an ir luminosity of @xmath18l@xmath19 for all the sources , with ( most objects having ) a starburst as the dominant power source , with star formation rates of @xmath20m@xmath19yr@xmath10 .",
    "similarly , the presence of the 1.6@xmath13 m feature demands a minimum mass of evolved stars of @xmath21m@xmath19 .",
    "both the b2 and b3 sources are thus good candidates for being moderately massive galaxies harboring an intense , obscured starburst , making them similar in nature to both local ulirgs , and high - redshift smgs .",
    "we measured the angular clustering of both samples using the methods described in @xcite , which we summarize here .",
    "we found that the levels of angular clustering seen in the three fields were consistent with each other to within 0.5@xmath22 , and so combined the angular clustering measures for each sample over the three fields . to quantify the strength of clustering",
    ", we fit both datasets with a power law , @xmath23 , where @xmath24 and @xmath25 is the clustering amplitude ; @xmath26 for the b3s and @xmath27 for the b2s . to convert these angular clustering amplitudes to spatial clustering amplitudes",
    ", we invert limbers equation :    @xmath28^{2}}{\\int_{a}^{b}\\left(\\frac{dn}{dz}\\right)^{2}e(z ) d_{\\theta}^{1-\\gamma}(z)f(z)(1+z)dz}\\right]^{\\frac{1}{\\gamma}}\\ ] ]    where @xmath29 parametrizes the redshift evolution of @xmath30 , and :    @xmath31/2 ) } , e(z ) = [ \\omega_{m}(1+z)^{3 } + \\omega_{\\lambda}]^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\ ] ]    we derived @xmath32 from the photometric redshift distributions @xcite . for the b2 sources",
    "this is a gaussian centered at @xmath33 with a fwhm of @xmath34 , and for the b3 sources this is a gaussian centered at @xmath35 with a fwhm of @xmath36 .",
    "the resulting correlation lengths are @xmath37mpc for the b2 sources , and @xmath38mpc for the b3 sources .",
    "to place these clustering results in context , we consider two models .",
    "the first parametrizes the spatial correlation function , @xmath39 , as a single power law in comoving coordinates , where the comoving correlation length , @xmath40 , is :      here the choice of @xmath42 determines the redshift evolution @xcite .",
    "several cases are usually quoted .",
    "first is ` comoving clustering ' , where haloes expand with the universe , and @xmath43 ; in this case clustering remains constant .",
    "second is the family of models for which @xmath44 , for which clustering increases with time .",
    "examples of this family include ( a ) ` stable ' clustering , for which @xmath45 ( in this case the haloes are frozen in _ proper _ coordinates , ( b ) the predicted evolution of clustering of the overall dark matter distribution , where @xmath46 @xcite , and @xmath47 at z=0 @xcite , ( c ) ` linear ' clustering , where @xmath48 . a cautionary note to this",
    "is that detailed interpretations of clustering evolution from these models suffer from several theoretical flaws @xcite , and so should be thought of as qualitative indicators rather than quantitative predictions .",
    "we therefore simply use the ` stable ' and ` linear ' models as indicators of the possible range of halo clustering amplitude with redshift .",
    "the second class of model comprises those in which comoving correlation lengths increase with _ increasing _ redshift .",
    "these models introduce ` bias ' , @xmath49 , between the galaxies and the underlying dark matter .",
    "an example of such models are the ` fixed mass ' models @xcite , which predict the clustering strength of haloes of a specified mass at any given redshift . in figure [ r0plot ]",
    "we plot the @xmath42 model for dark matter ,  stableand ` linear ' epsilon models normalized to the b2 and b3 clustering strengths , the fixed halo mass models for halo masses of @xmath50m@xmath19 , @xmath51m@xmath19 , and @xmath52m@xmath19 , the @xmath30 values for the b2 and b3 galaxies , and the spatial correlation lengths of other galaxy populations taken from the literature .    with the the uncertainties described earlier",
    "firmly in mind , we use figure [ r0plot ] to explore the relationships between our samples , the underlying dark matter , and other galaxies . both the b2s and the b3s",
    "are strongly clustered , with correlation lengths much higher than that predicted for the overall dm distribution .",
    "both b2s and b3s cluster significantly more strongly than optical qsos at their respective epochs , and b3s cluster more strongly than smgs . based on the @xcite models",
    ", then we derive _ approximate _ 1@xmath22 halo mass ranges of @xmath53m@xmath54 for the b3s , and @xmath55m@xmath56 for the b2s .",
    "interestingly , halo masses comparable to these were recently derived for an independent sample of high - redshift ulirgs by @xcite .",
    "the most interesting comparison is however between the two samples themselves .",
    "the clustering evolution of qsos with redshift @xcite may mean that there is a ` minimum ' host halo mass for qso activity , below which no qso is seen , of @xmath57m@xmath19 .",
    "the correlation lengths for the b2 and b3 samples are consistent with the same conclusion but for a @xmath58 ` minimum ' dm halo mass . taken together ,",
    "these results imply that a minimum halo mass is a ` threshold ' factor for _ all _ forms of luminous activity in galaxies , both starbursts and agn .",
    "it is also interesting to speculate on what the host haloes of b2 and b3 sources contain at lower and higher redshifts .",
    "we might expect that a halo hosting a b3 source could contain an optically bright lbg at @xmath59 , followed by a b3 at @xmath60 , possibly accompanied by other ( near - ir selected ) star forming systems @xcite , before evolving to host a rich galaxy cluster at low redshifts .",
    "the occupants of a halo hosting a b2 galaxy would however probably be different .",
    "we would expect that such a halo could contain an smg at @xmath60 , and optically fainter lbgs at @xmath61 ( though probably not lbgs at @xmath62 ) . at lower redshifts such",
    "a halo might host a radio - bright agn and or ero at @xmath63 , and a ( poor to rich ) cluster at @xmath64 .",
    "we conclude that ulirgs at @xmath65 as a class likely signpost stellar buildup in galaxies in clusters at @xmath64 , with higher redshift ulirgs signposting stellar buildup in galaxies that will reside in more massive clusters at lower redshifts ."
