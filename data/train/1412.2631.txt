    "it is commonly known that the addition of a small amount of liquid in a granular medium brings cohesion properties due to the surface tension of the liquid .",

    "properties and rheology of homogeneous wet granular materials have received a lot attention from experimental @xcite and numerical point of view @xcite .",
    "however the situations encountered in nature or industry often present heterogeneous systems , where the liquid content is not homogeneously distributed over space .",
    "this is the case for some landslides where the basal material is more cohesive than the flowing one .",
    "such a situation arises for example because of humidity .",
    "to model their dynamics , the evolution of the interface between the erodible ground and the flowing material is still studied experimentally or numerically @xcite and the effect of the cohesion on erosion remains unknown .    in the industrial context , many processes blend powders and grains with liquids .",
    "understanding the mechanisms of the spreading of the liquid is important to avoid lump formation when preparing dough in food industry , but also in the granulation phenomenon to obtain pills in pharmaceutical industry @xcite , or during the production of slurries for mortar or concrete in building materials @xcite . during the first stages of the blending , wet areas are in contact with dry flowing grains .",
    "we can expect morphological evolution of the cohesive medium through exchanges between the two areas .",
    "more precisely , in the case of low water content , one may expect erosion of the cohesive phase to occur by extraction of grains from the cohesive medium . despite the large interest of industry in these processes , the precise mechanisms of these initial steps",

    "erosion of a substrate by a granular phase is of interest for geomorphology , where empirical laws are derived from field observation and from model experiments @xcite .",
    "the erosion rate is usually related to the kinetic energy of impacting grains @xcite like in the seminal models of wear production by sand blasting @xcite , where the erosion rate scales with the velocity of impacting grains to a power between 2 and 5 @xcite . in the case of enduring contact , fretting wear has been shown to be proportional to the normal load @xcite .",
    "however two main points are questionable : first , the stress and flowing conditions at the granular interface are still matter of debate , specially for dense flows @xcite and are hardly linked to the erosion processes @xcite .",
    "what is the driving mechanism for granular erosion ?",
    "second , the cohesive media may not be considered as a continuous material since its internal length scale is of the same order of size as the flowing grain . thus the previous laws derived for brittle or plastic materials showing that the erosion rate decreases with the square of the tensile strength may not apply @xcite .",
    "we expect on the opposite that forces developed by a stretched capillary bridge @xcite will govern the erosion process .    in this paper",
    ", we study this erosion phenomenon experimentally with a model system . here , cohesion is brought by capillary bridges only . the eroding flow is constituted of dry - dense granular matter .",
    "we explore the dynamics of erosion in regard of the properties of the liquids in the wet granular medium , and of the properties of the flowing grains .",
    "we present a model of erosion that reveals unexpected dependencies and that may be used to better understand the mixing issues mentioned above .",
    "we used a thin plexiglas cylinder with an inner diameter of 14.2 cm and a depth of 0.5 cm as rotating drum ( fig .",
    "[ fig : drum view ] ) .",
    "these dimensions correspond to an aspect ratio around 28 , so the drum can be considered as 2-dimensional .",
    "we introduced wet material , of controlled liquid content , to form a circular aggregate of diameter @xmath2 cm at the center of the drum .",
    "to do so , we first mix an amount of grains and liquid , with the help of a spatula , until we obtain a homogeneous mixture",
    ". the cohesion forces that ties the aggregate will also make it stick to the vertical drum walls , and remain at the center .",
    "then , we filled half the place left with dry grains before closing the drum , and putting it into rotation .",
    "different types of material have been employed , and are summarized in table [ tab : granular - materials - employed ] .",
    "phonolite has an important roughness , and thus is close to real materials .",
    "we also used several kinds of beads ranging from 0.2 to 1.3 mm in diameter .",
    "we will use different notations for the flowing - grain diameter @xmath3 and for the radius of wet grains @xmath4 inside the aggregate .",
    "different liquids were used , water , glycerol , ethylene glycol and silicone oils , in order to vary the surface tension @xmath5 , from 20 to 70 mn / m , and viscosity @xmath6 , from 1 to @xmath7 mpa.s .    for the range of measured surface tension @xmath5 ,",
    "the typical granular bond number is always high , with @xmath8 , where @xmath4 is the wet grain radius and @xmath9 the mass of the grain .",
    "that is why cohesion from capillary bridges here can easily overcome the gravity .",
    "the aggregate has then enough cohesion to sustain itself , and not break under its own weight .",
    "the capillary length @xmath10 is around 2.6 mm for water , much larger than the typical size of capillary bridges , so gravity will not deform them . finally , drainage is limited by viscous effects , as the liquid should travel through thin films of liquids , whose thickness is the roughness of the bead surface , @xmath11 . considering the hydrostatic pressure on the size of the aggregate , we obtain a drainage time on a distance @xmath4 of @xmath12 s for @xmath1310 mpa.s .",

    "humidity is a source of liquid in the granular medium , as shown by bocquet _",
    "_ in @xcite , which can influence the results .",
    "however , we checked that the influence of this parameter is weak compared to our data dispersion .    for experiments with glass beads ,",
    "the progressive liquid spreading due to erosion in the dry area can alter the flow properties .",
    "cohesion appears in the surrounding medium until it sticks to the edges of the drum .",
    "the setting is then widely modified , so we use only the first part of the experiment , when the spreading of the liquid is still low enough .",
    "trials have first been led with phonolite and water , for different liquid contents . in the following ,",
    "we choose to use @xmath14 , the ratio of liquid volume on the total volume of aggregate . as there is no compaction of the aggregates in our experiments ,",
    "@xmath14 is not changed without addition or withdrawal of liquid .",
    "we had to used quite high levels of liquid contents due to the high roughness of phonolithe grains , between 4 and 22.5% .",
    "the rotation speed was maintained at 0.349 rad / s , corresponding to an 18 s period .",
    "figure [ fig : erosion - phono ] shows the variation of the aggregate diameter , from its initial value to zero , when it disappears in the flow .",
    "the lifetime of the aggregate ( a few minutes ) increases with @xmath14 . for low liquid contents",
    ", the diameter decreases linearly with time .",
    "such behavior can easily be justified by simple assumptions . in this case ,",
    "capillary bridges are individual , so the behavior of interfacial grains does not depend on the other grains farther below the surface .",
    "the erosion of the grains is then a local mechanism .",
    "moreover , the flow properties are stationary , thus we assume that the mechanical action of the flow is constant with time .",
    "since the wet aggregate is assumed to be homogeneous , the local erosion rate should also be constant with time . finally , the diminution of the aggregate area should scale with the portion @xmath15 of perimeter undergoing the erosion ( fig [ fig : drum view ] ) , leading to @xmath16 .",
    "we assume that the angle @xmath1 depends on the geometry only , and remains unchanged .",
    "the diameter decrease would then be linear : @xmath17 .    ]    for the higher liquid contents , we have a slower evolution , and even a growth phase for @xmath14=22.5% .",
    "this growth is probably enabled by the rearrangement of the liquid distribution .",
    "if the liquid network is sufficiently connected , suction may bring the liquid to the edge of the aggregate and create new capillary bridges , with initially dry grains , coming from the flow .",
    "we saw that gravity - driven drainage was not permitted because of viscous effects .",
    "moreover , when the liquid content is high enough , the liquid is not distributed anymore into single capillary bridges .",
    "the laplace pressure may be weaker in water pockets implying more than two grains , and on the opposite , it will plays fully on the newly formed bridge .",
    "that is why liquid transport may occur here , as it is driven by capillary effects , stronger than gravity at the grain scale .",
    "the diameter seems to follow a square root collapse with time ( fig .",
    "[ fig : erosion - phono ] ) . as a simple tentative explanation",
    ", we can consider that the flowing grains pump the liquid toward the surface of the aggregate , thus the erosion will be lower at the beginning while the degree of saturation in the core decreases .",
    "then , the erosion rate increases when the diameter decreases , as the water content is lower inside .",
    "we reserve this issue for future work .",
    "the linear regime appears then as a simpler process , which does not involve liquid migration inside the aggregate . in this regime",
    ", we can measure an erosion rate @xmath18 from the slope of the lines , to quantify the speed of the process .",
    "we define @xmath18 as a dimensionless parameter , by rescaling the aggregate diameter @xmath0 by the beads diameter @xmath3 , and the time by the rotation period of the drum @xmath19 : @xmath20 @xmath18 is then a positive number , counting the number of layers of grains eroded from the surface of the aggregate , for each revolution of the drum .      in the following of the paper , we use relatively low liquid contents to remain in the linear regime of erosion , for which we can measure an erosion rate .",
    "the typical value will be @xmath21 , and otherwise precised .",
    "figure [ fig : linear - decrease ] shows a typical run of the experiment .",

    "the liquid used is silicone oil v100 .",
    "[ fig : linear - decrease ] ]    to stretch a capillary bridge linking two grains , one must overcome two forces , one coming from the surface tension , and the other one from the viscosity of the liquid .",
    "the forces developed by a capillary bridge are approximated by @xcite : @xmath22 @xmath23 being the contact angle , and @xmath24 the separation distance between the two beads .",
    "these are first order approximations regarding @xmath24 .",
    "only the normal viscous dissipation is considered , and we assume that most of the viscous dissipation arises from normal displacement .",
    "we expect then both surface tension and viscosity to increase the resistance to erosion , and thus to observe lower erosion rates when they increase . in order to observe the effect , an other set of experiments",
    "have been carried out with various liquids .",
    "we used the same protocol as previously , with a 24 s period .",
    "the liquid content is fixed at @xmath14=0.3% or otherwise precised .",
    "figure [ fig : gamma ] shows the evolution of the erosion rate with the surface tension .",
    "the different liquids have similar viscosity , from 10 to 20 mpa.s .",
    "the erosion rate strongly decreases even for a small range of surface tension .     for different liquids and glass beads . for filled symbols viscosity",
    "is around 10 mpa.s , and for open ones around 20 mpa.s[fig : gamma ] ]    silicone oils allowed us to explore the influence of viscosity from 10 to 10000 mpa.s ( v10-v10000 ) , and have a conveniently constant surface tension of 21 mn / m . on figure",
    "[ fig : eta ] , we plotted the erosion rate versus the viscosity .",
    "the decrease of the erosion rate spreads over three decades , and a similar trend is observed for other trials with other glass beads and polystyrene beads .",
    "the lines of slope of -1 in log - log scales on this plot show a trend in agreement with the results , even if we observe a slightly lower slope for the bigger glass beads .",

    "the lines of slope -1 show a trend .",
    "typical error bars error bars estimated from error measurements are smaller than the markers .",
    "however , experiments with similar viscosity display some variability . [ fig : eta ] ]    in the previously defined linear erosion regime , the liquid content still has an influence on the erosion dynamics .",
    "figure [ fig : liquid content ] shows the erosion rate measured for different liquid content ( @xmath14=0.3 - 1.5 % ) , with two different liquids . in this range",
    ", we have enough liquid to cover the surface of the beads by a layer of liquid .",
    "meanwhile , we are still below a threshold of coalescence of capillary bridges , and they are formed only between pairs of beads . moreover , for a homogeneous distribution the liquid network is well described in @xcite , from which come the results and relations of this paragraph we rely on .",
    "the cohesion forces have simple expressions ( eq .",
    "( [ eq : cohesion forces ] ) , and it is noticeable that theses two cohesion forces do not depend on the volume of the bridges in first approximation . the influence of the liquid content may be explained as follows . under the assumption of a homogeneous distribution of liquid , further addition of liquid will increase the bridge volume @xmath25 .",
    "if we assume all the liquid to go into the capillary bridges , @xmath25 is linked to the liquid content by : @xmath26 , @xmath25 being rescaled by @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the average number of bridges per bead .",
    "therefore the rupture length @xmath29 also increases as follow : @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "@xmath31 is simply @xmath32 .",
    "the rupture length will then contribute to the effective resistance to erosion .",
    "but more importantly , the addition of liquid also increases the connectivity of the capillary bridges network .",
    "@xmath28 is experimentally given by @xmath33 .",
    "@xmath31 , scaling roughly with @xmath34 ( through @xmath35 ) , appears as the relevant parameter to analyze the liquid content influence .",
    "the equation giving @xmath35 and @xmath31 are solved iteratively to obtain @xmath31 as a function of @xmath14 .    ]      the different sets of beads used also give information about the influence of flowing beads on the erosion dynamics .",
    "here , only the beads of the flow are changed , and the aggregate is always made with 200 - 400 @xmath36 m glass beads .",
    "this way , the cohesion of the aggregate remains unchanged , and we can independently observe the influence of the action of the flow on the process .",
    "we changed two parameters with great consequences on the erosion rate : bead size and bead density .",
    "m beads of different material listed in table ( [ tab : granular - materials - employed ] ) . the variations with the beads diameter are plotted on the right , using glass beads and 10 , 100 and 1000 mpa.s silicone oils .",
    "[ fig : e diameter density ] ]    figure [ fig : e diameter density ] shows a strong increase of the erosion rate of several decades , with only moderate changes of the mass density and diameter .",
    "the scaling appears as clearly faster than a simple proportionality .",
    "in order to understand how the liquid properties impact the erosion dynamics , we need to evaluate the order of magnitude of the different forces .",
    "since the erosion of the aggregate is a very slow process compared to the dynamics of the flowing grains , we can assume first that wet grains are extracted one by one from the aggregate and second , that the dry - grains flow is not modified by this mechanism .",
    "for this purpose , we introduce a typical velocity , @xmath37 , which scales as the average velocity of the first layer of beads flowing on the aggregate .",
    "we explore a wide range of viscosity , hence the stokes number @xmath38 as defined in @xcite , with @xmath9 the mass of the beads , varies from @xmath39 to @xmath40 , which means that inertia of the beads can be important for the low viscosities .",
    "the capillary number was also varied in a wide range , @xmath41 .",
    "the velocity used is relevant only if the grains are extracted at the same speed as the flowing grains , but this is a questionable point . using few fast - camera acquisitions , we measured a typical velocity around @xmath42 mm / s , which is only a tenth of @xmath43 .",
    "these measures indicate potentially a lower capillary number , and therefore that viscous forces are negligible versus capillary effects .",
    "this question will be precised later .",
    "finally , we can evaluate the typical force @xmath44 undergone by the grains submitted to the flow .",
    "we can either choose the stress from gravity @xmath45 , where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the height and the average density of the flowing layer and @xmath36 is the friction coefficient at its bottom , or the one from bagnold s collisional - stress scaling : @xmath48 , with @xmath49 the shear rate in the flow . the shear rate in the rotating drum geometry is given by @xmath50 @xcite ,",
    "so we obtain that the stress driving the erosion should scale either like : @xmath51 or , @xmath52 the former scaling ( [ eq : shear stress ] ) has been confirmed by numerical simulations at the front of a bidisperse granular flow : yohannes _ et al . _ in @xcite found an average boundary stress scaling linearly with the bead size , as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : shear stress ] ) .",
    "then , in both cases , the density of the beads impacts directly the boundary stress .",
    "erosion models derived from @xcite suggest that @xmath53 .",
    "however , we can notice that a simple proportionality between the erosion rate and @xmath47 or @xmath3 could not explain the important effect on the erosion rate we observed on figure [ fig : e diameter density ]",
    ". this dependency would be too weak compared to the one we measured .",
    "then either we do not have a simple scaling of the erosion rate , or the average shear stress is not a relevant parameter in the process .",
    "the average force @xmath44 can be evaluated with the average shear stress ( eq . [ eq : shear stress ] or [ eq : shear_stressgravity ] ) on one bead , @xmath54 , leading to a range of force between @xmath55n for the bagnold stress and @xmath56n for the gravity force .",
    "we can use the shield number @xmath57 comparing the tangential and confining forces , usually defined for the river bed erosion @xcite . here",
    "@xmath58 , as the dominant confining force is @xmath59 .",
    "we find that @xmath57 spans from 0.005 up to 0.12 depending on the chosen stress and on the surface tension .",
    "the shear force values are then at least ten times less than capillary forces .",
    "this comparison means that erosion is not possible to occur as a simple stretching of the bonds by the average stress .      even if the average force undergone by the aggregate s grains",
    "is weak compared to the capillary forces , physical quantities are known to have large fluctuations around their average values in a granular medium .",
    "such fluctuations in the granular flow can overcome the cohesion of the aggregate .",
    "only larger values present in the force distribution @xmath60 are able to overcome the threshold allowing the stretching of the bonds , until we reach the rupture . then , in order to build an erosion rate , we need the time for a bridge to reach the rupture , for each level of stress .",
    "@xmath59 is the static force , which defines the lower level of erosion resistance , as the viscous force arises only with stretching speed .",
    "we consider that only forces @xmath61 greater than @xmath59 will contribute to the erosion , at a rate @xmath62 , and with a probability of occurrence @xmath63 .",
    "under such hypothesis , the erosion rate derived from this stochastic model should follow :    @xmath64    we call @xmath65 the theoretical erosion rate derived from this stochastic model .",
    "@xmath66 simply represents the portion of the aggregate undergoing the stress of the flow , and we have a dimensionless erosion rate multiplying by @xmath19 . writing this model , we assume that the rupture time is lower than the correlation time of the forces .",
    "gardel @xmath67 report a correlation time of 10 ms in a hopper for 3 mm beads @xcite .",
    "we will comment this assumption in the next paragraph .",
    "the fluctuations are typically exponential in a granular material .",
    "we chose to use the distribution derived from the q - model , verified for static pile @xcite and for flow under shear as well @xcite :    @xmath68    @xmath69 being linked to the average force of the distribution by @xmath70 .",
    "regardless of the precise distribution , exponential decrease for high forces is a generic feature for granular medium in a wide variety of conditions @xcite .",
    "this approach brings us back to the previous issue of the velocity of extracted grains : different levels of forces lead to different rupture times , thus to various extraction velocities . from this",
    "we need to evaluate the rupture time relations with the liquid properties as well as the stress level .",
    "evaluating the rupture time requires studying the bridge dynamics .",
    "initially , the main force acting on the bridge is the capillary force .",
    "then , as the bond is stretched , viscous forces will arise .",
    "we use a simple equation to model the bridge dynamics :    @xmath71    we consider here a single capillary bridge , submitted to a constant traction force @xmath61 . here",
    "we use first order expressions of the forces , the capillary forces , for instance , actually depend on the separation distance @xcite .",
    "we consider two different limit cases of this non - linear differential equation ( [ eq : bridge dynamics ] ) .",
    "first , for low viscosity , inertia will dominate compared to the viscous force . neglecting this term ,",
    "we can then integrate from the contact distance @xmath11 , due to roughness , to the rupture length :    @xmath72    if viscosity is high enough , then inertia is negligible , and again we can easily integrate without the left - hand side to obtain the rupture time :    @xmath73    we evaluate these time scales for a traction force @xmath61 being twice the capillary force : we find values around 0.1 ms for the inertial time , and from 0.3 to 300 ms for the viscous time . comparing to the correlation time of forces from literature , the most viscous case and the lower levels of forces will not verify the assumption we made .",
    "still , very large forces can achieve the rupture of the bridge in a short enough time . to push further the analytical development of the model ,",
    "now we make the assumption that the sum of the two characteristic times provides a good approximation of the actual rupture time .      using the force distribution ( [ eq : stress distribution ] ) and the total rupture time ( [ eq : inertial rupture time ] ) and ( [ eq : viscous rupture time ] ) , the erosion rate",
    "can then be developed in the following form :    @xmath74    with @xmath75 and @xmath76 , constant coefficients depending on the beads and liquid properties .",
    "we have to consider the multiplicity of capillary bridges through the number @xmath77 , which is now present both in the viscous force ( in @xmath78 and in the capillary force @xmath59 , even if we keep the same notation .",
    "the effective number of capillary bridges per bead in the aggregate can be reduced next to the walls .",
    "then we overestimate this number , but only for a small fraction of the grains , around 10% as we have 20 layers of grains in the width of the drum . for the beads submitted to erosion , at the surface of the aggregate",
    ", we consider this number to be reduced to the half : @xmath79 .",
    "the substitution @xmath80 allows to underline the main physical trends in the expression :    @xmath81    with @xmath82    the first result of this model is the main dependencies of the erosion rate : it decreases exponentially with the capillary force , and scales as @xmath83 as we observed on figure [ fig : eta ] .",
    "the dimensionless integral @xmath84 varies with dimensionless numbers as well , @xmath85 , which is @xmath86 , and @xmath87 .",
    "the second one can actually be written as a combination of the first one , and other usual numbers : @xmath88 .",
    "these numbers are rather small for the set of parameters used in most experiments .",
    "then @xmath84 is close to its limit 1 , and will give weaker influence on the erosion rate with the physical parameters .",
    "it is worth noting that we do not expect this stochastic erosion rate to exactly match the experimental data .",
    "indeed , the roughness of the surface or the local variations of the number of bridges , that would delay the erosion , are not taken into account .    in a different limit of @xmath89 and @xmath90 ,",
    "the viscous rupture time would dominate , and we obtain a different expression for the erosion rate : @xmath91 then , the erosion rate is proportional to the average force , according to the wear models described in @xcite .    in the following ,",
    "we confront our model with the experimental data in more detail .",
    "m glass beads .",
    "the line is an exponential fit of the data .",
    "[ fig : e_fcap ] ]    plotting the erosion rate times @xmath92 ( figure [ fig : e_fcap ] ) allows to represent liquids of different physical properties on the same graph , and should exhibit an exponential decrease with @xmath59 , neglecting the variations of @xmath84 .",
    "the points are well gathered on the same line in log - lin scales , except for the experiments with water .",
    "this shift is probably due to evaporation during the experiment , reducing the effective liquid content in the aggregate .",
    "an evaporation test showed that half the initial water content in the aggregate disappeared after 40 minutes , which was the time of measurement for this experiment .",
    "similar tests on the other liquids showed no effect of evaporation .",
    "the scaling with @xmath83 of the erosion rate is also confirmed by this plot .",
    "the fit provides an evaluation of the parameter @xmath69 , related to the average force @xmath44 .",
    "we found @xmath93n for the standard set - up of our experiments , that is glass beads of 200 - 400 @xmath36 m diameter .",
    "nevertheless , it is straightforward to integrate numerically equation ( [ eq : stochastic model ] ) , and fit @xmath44 by successive iterations : we find @xmath94n . as",
    "this value is close to the previous one , the first order of the variations are well captured by the first parts of equation ( [ eq : stochastic erosion rate ] ) , meaning that the integral @xmath84 ( eq . [ eq : integral_i ] ) has a moderate variation .",
    "however , this value is quite different from the force estimation based on dimension analysis ( eq . [ eq : shear stress],[eq : shear_stressgravity ] ) , but still less than the capillary force , whose comparison justify our stochastic approach .",
    "an explanation would be that the surface of the aggregate is not flat and that the highest wet grains experience larger forces , leading to a faster erosion of those grains .",
    "another tentative explanation is to consider capillary bridges to break one at the time , decreasing by a factor @xmath95 the cohesive force and the fitted @xmath44 . in both cases ,",
    "the erosion rate is expected to increase and to lead to an overestimation of the mean force @xmath44 .",
    "moreover , the fitted value of @xmath44 is sensitive to the precise distribution function @xmath60 , that still remains subject to research . nevertheless , the exponential decrease arising from the distribution tail is a strong result unrelated to the value of @xmath44 . in the next section ,",
    "we test our model with the scaling of the exerted force by the flow .",
    "the exponential decrease with the capillary force confirms an important point of this model , which is the role of stochastic fluctuations in the erosion process .",
    "now as we dispose of a data set where only the average stress is varied , we can confront the results with the model predictions . as the aggregate is prepared likewise for each set , using glass beads",
    ", there is no change in capillary force or in the viscous term in equation ( [ eq : stochastic erosion rate ] ) .",
    "however , the average force , and therefore @xmath69 , will change with @xmath47 , and @xmath3 according to equation ( [ eq : shear stress ] ) .    ]",
    "figure  [ fig : exp decrease f ] shows the exponential decrease of @xmath96 versus @xmath97 and similar variations on the beads size .",
    "this is the expected dependency with the average force according to equation ( [ eq : stochastic erosion rate ] ) . as in the previous part",
    ", we integrate @xmath84 and fit by iterations until we obtain an evaluation of the average force , @xmath44 .",
    "we convert the result to the equivalent value for the standard flow set - up ( 200 - 400 @xmath36 m glass beads ) , according to equation ( [ eq : shear stress ] ) .",
    "the data set on the mass density gives a value of @xmath98n , and the set on the diameter with silicone oil v10 gives @xmath99n , which are pretty concordant , and still quite close to the previous one , using the capillary force variations .",
    "this exponential decrease with the dimensionless number @xmath100 is confirmed on the two independent parameters , by separate experiments , and supports the relevance of considering stress fluctuations in the erosion process .",
    "this result also confirms the use of the inertial stress for the scaling of the force .    ]    the different sets of results of this erosion experiment show a good agreement with the stochastic model proposed here .",
    "the influence on the erosion rate of physical properties of the liquids involved ( viscosity , surface tension , liquid content ) , and the beads ( density , size ) has been verified separately , and leads to a concordant evaluation of the fitting parameter @xmath44 .",
    "using the right scaling , we plot all the results on the figure [ fig : master - curve ] , showing that the erosion rates gather on a single master curve .",
    "the white symbols on this figure correspond to the polystyrene beads flowing around a polystyrene beads aggregate .",
    "they are far below the master curve while the erosion of the polystyrene beads flowing on a glass beads aggregate is well captured by our model ( one of the darker blue square ) .",
    "this is even more surprising as glass beads seem to be eroded faster than polystyrene ones .",
    "we do not know the origin of this behavior , and we suppose that arising static electric charges may prevent effective contacts between beads , reducing the erosion rate . finally , the slope of the fitted master curve value is @xmath101 n.",
    "we measured the evolution of erosion rate of a wet aggregate with respect to the liquids and grains properties .",
    "we showed an unexpected strong influence of the surface tension .",
    "this effect is captured by the stochastic model we proposed which shows a good agreement with the different sets of experimental results .",
    "we can not separate the domain of influence of the viscosity and surface tension due to their different roles in the erosion mechanism : we have shown that in conditions of low stokes number , the viscosity drives mostly the rupture time of the capillary bridge .",
    "meanwhile , surface tension acts as a simple threshold and a shift for the efficient contribution in the stress distribution of the surrounding flow . in the case of a low level of stress ,",
    "the fluctuations of the flow appear as crucial in the description of the erosion phenomenon .",
    "this role of fluctuations have already been pointed out for other interface behavior , expressed as boundary conditions in @xcite .",
    "fluctuations acts also as the triggering effect of quasistatic flows in the work of pouliquen _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , similarly to our experiments , and have recently shown their relevance in impact dynamic in granular media @xcite .",
    "we thanks f. chevoir for enlightening advises .",
    "we acknowledge also p. raux and c. clanet for fruitful discussions on the different erosion regimes and e. gouillart for useful comments on the manuscript ."
