    "<S> while magnetic hysteresis usually considers magnetic domains , the switching of the core of magnetic vortices has recently become an active topic . </S>",
    "<S> we considered bloch domain walls , which are known to display at the surface of thin films flux - closure features called nel caps . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrated the controlled switching of these caps under magnetic field , occurring via the propagation of a surface vortex . </S>",
    "<S> for this we considered flux - closure states in elongated micron - sized dots , so that only the central domain wall can be addressed , while domains remain unaffected .    </S>",
    "<S> 0.5 in    0.5 in    data storage relies on the handling of two states , called bits . in magnetoelectronic devices bits </S>",
    "<S> are stored using the two directions of magnetization in nanoscale bistable domains . in hard - disk drives these </S>",
    "<S> are written in granular continuous thin films , while in solid - state magnetic random access memories ( mrams ) bits rely on dots patterned with lithography@xcite . while miniaturisation is the conventional way to fuel the continuous increase of device density , </S>",
    "<S> disruptive solutions are also sought . to these </S>",
    "<S> belong in recent years many fundamental studies investigating no more the domains , but the manipulation of domain walls and magnetic vortices as objects in themselves . </S>",
    "<S> the degree of freedom associated with these may be their location , for a domain wall moved along a stripe@xcite , or their internal structure , the up - or - down polarity of a vortex in a circular dot@xcite . in the latter case the chirality of the flux - closure around the vortex </S>",
    "<S> might also be exploited as a second degree of freedom@xcite . in this context </S>",
    "<S> it is of fundamental interest to revisit all existing internal degrees of freedom in classical domain walls , and determine whether or not they might be switched independently of their environnement .    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we consider an already known internal degree of freedom in bloch domain walls , the so - called nel caps  ( ncs ) , and report the controlled magnetic switching of these ncs . </S>",
    "<S> bloch walls in thin films have been extensively addressed@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to the simplest text - book case where a translational invariance is assumed within the dw plane , bloch walls in thin films with in - plane magnetization are known to display an extra degree of freedom beyond the up - or - down polarity of its core : the direction of magnetization in the ncs , occurring at both surfaces of the wall to decrease the magnetostatic energya . </S>",
    "<S> the name nc was given only later@xcite , as the arrangement of magnetization in ncs mimics that of a nel wall , a type of dw with solely in - plane magnetization@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> at remanence the two ncs are antiparallel to each other and thus in principle two degenerate ground states exist , which we named after the direction of magnetization of the bottom and top ncs , @xmath0 and @xmath1a . </S>",
    "<S> this overall arrangement was named an asymmetric bloch wall@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> so far nobody demonstrated that the remanent state of antiparallel ncs could be selected reliably . </S>",
    "<S> this mainly stems from the fact that in thin films , where such processes had been sought , the magnetization in the domains rotates easily under applied fields , often affecting the location and even the existence of domain walls@xcite . to lift this limitation we considered elongated dots displaying a flux - closure state , were a finite - size bloch domain wall is stabilized by the internal dipolar fields . </S>",
    "<S> the structure of these flux - closure states has long since been described , and is now called a landau state@xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate numerically and experimentally that ncs can be switched controllably under the application of a magnetic field without affecting the other two degrees of freedom found in the dot : the core with perpendicular magnetization of the bloch wall , nor the chirality of the in - plane flux - closure .    </S>",
    "<S> ( a )  schematic view of a domain wall of bloch type , terminated by a nel cap at each surface . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetization is opposite in the top and bottom nel caps , and points along the @xmath2 axes across the plane of the wall . </S>",

    "<S> the map of @xmath5 at mid - height is also shown , and the in - plane curling of magnetization is indicated by white arrows.,width=313 ]    the sample consists of epitaxial micron - sized self - assembled elongated fe@xmath6 ) dots with atomically - smooth facets . </S>",
    "<S> these were fabricated using uhv pulsed - laser deposition on @xmath7 wafers buffered with a layer of w@xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> the dots grow spontaneously as a result of a dewetting process named stranski - krastanov growth mode , driven by the large lattice mismatch between fe and w  ( @xmath9{\\%}$ ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the facets arise spontaneously and reproducibly with well - defined directions in relation with the single - cristallinity of the dot@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the growth temperature  ( ) and nominal thickness  ( ) were chosen so that the average length , width and height of the dots are @xmath10{\\micron}$ ] , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the dots were capped with @xmath13-thick mo followed by a @xmath14-thick au layer to prevent oxidation during the transfer in air between the growth chamber and the magnetic imaging setups .    </S>",
    "<S> two high - resolution imaging instruments were used , bringing complementary informations . </S>",
    "<S> the first instrument is an elmitec gmbh leem / peem microscope ( leem  v ) , based at the nanospectroscopy beamline of elettra synchrotron ( trieste , italy ) . in the low energy electron microscopy ( leem ) mode@xcite , topographical features are revealed with a lateral resolution below @xmath15 . in the x - ray photo - emission electron microscope mode  ( xpeem ) the x - rays energy was tuned at the fe @xmath16 edge , @xmath17{ev}$ ] . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic contrast is obtained using xmcd - peem ( x - ray magnetic circular dichroism)@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the spatial resolution is here @xmath18 , with a probing depth of @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> maps of the in - plane component of surface magnetization parallel to the x - ray beam are thus achieved . as a second instrument we used a fei titan transmission electron microscope in the fresnel contrast mode@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the microscope is equipped with a gatan imaging filter for zero - loss filtering and a dedicated lorentz lens , and was operated at 300kv . </S>",
    "<S> we tilted the sample by @xmath19 so that the field produced by the lorentz exhibits an in - plane component , which we used in our experiments to switch the ncs . </S>",
    "<S> the fresnel images highlight the location of vortices and domain walls separating the in - plane domains , with a bright or dark contrast contrast revealing the chirality of the domains around them , not the magnetization of their core . </S>",
    "<S> the sapphire substrate was mechanically polished and then ion - milled to permit transmission of the electrons .    </S>",
    "<S> the micromagnetic simulations were performed using gl_fft , a custom - developed code@xcite based on a finite - differences scheme . </S>",

    "<S> ( b )  a magnetization process of nel caps under @xmath27 ( c )  schematic cross - sectional view of the switching of ncs : the final state is @xmath0 or @xmath1 depending on the sign of the applied field.,width=313 ]    we first report simulations . </S>",
    "<S> first notice on , as already known@xcite , that a vortex and a bloch wall in a dot are topology equivalent . </S>",
    "<S> conceptually the asymmetric bloch wall can be derived from a vortex by shearing apart its top and bottom extremities . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to the prototypical landau structure@xcite . in the following we call these extremities </S>",
    "<S> surface vortices_. we now focus on faceted dots , whose shape and size are those investigated experimentally . for a given chirality and polarity of the dw </S>",
    "<S> the set of ncs gives rise to two degenerate ground states at zero external field , @xmath0 and @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> starting from a @xmath1 state , a transverse magnetic field @xmath28 is applied ( along  @xmath29 ) . upon applying a positive @xmath28 </S>",
    "<S> no significant change occurs up to . at @xmath30{mt}$ ] </S>",
    "<S> the top surface vortex propagates through the top nc to the other end of the dw , and settles atop the bottom vortex surface . </S>",
    "<S> the two ncs are then parallel and aligned along the field direction  [ @xmath31 state ] . this arrangement is known as an _ asymmetric nel wall _ , </S>",
    "<S> consistent with the finding in thin films that asymmetric nel walls are favored against asymmetric bloch walls under a transverse field@xcite . upon decreasing @xmath28 back to zero no significant change </S>",
    "<S> occurs down to @xmath32{mt}$ ] , where suddenly the surface vortex travels back to its initial position  [ @xmath1 state ] . under now decreasing negative fields the top </S>",
    "<S> nc remains unaffected , while it is the bottom nc that switches still around @xmath33{mt}$]c [ @xmath34 state ] . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , when @xmath28 is reduced back to zero it is again the top nc that switches back . </S>",
    "<S> this leaves a @xmath0 state at remanence , opposite to the initial state . </S>",
    "<S> the fact that it is always the top nc that switches back when the field magnitude is reduced might be related to the tilted facets , which break the symmetry between the top and bottom surfaces . </S>",
    "<S> thus owing to this breaking of symmetry and according to micromagnetic simulations , one should be able to switch the set of ncs by applying a magnetic field transverse to the dot . at remanence </S>",
    "<S> the top nc should be antiparallel to the applied field .    </S>",
    "<S> ( a )  3d view of a typical self - assembled epitaxial fe(110 ) dot ( atomic force microscopy , true aspect ratios ) . </S>",
    "<S> ( b )  leem ( topography ) and ( c )  xmcd - peem ( magnetism ) typical view of an ensemble of dots . </S>",
    "<S> after magnetization at @xmath35{mt}$ ] the dots are in the @xmath0 state at remanence whatever their size , height or aspect ratio . </S>",
    "<S> the white arrow indicates the direction of the x - rays , thus the component of in - plane surface magnetization imaged.,width=309 ]    the micromagnetic predictions were confirmed experimentally . as no significant magnetic field </S>",
    "<S> can be applied while imaging with xmcd - peem , the state of the ncs was checked at remanence after application of a transverse magnetic field @xmath28 with a given sign and magnitude . for each field </S>",
    "<S> several tens of dots were imaged  ( 20 to 40 ) . </S>",
    "<S> ncs are revealed as a thin stripe of dark or light contrast along the length of the dotsc . in principle </S>",
    "<S> this contrast could be mistaken as arising from a nel wall . </S>",
    "<S> this is however ruled out as the magnetic force microscopy signature of these walls is monopolar , while nel walls would induce bipolar contrasts@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we now describe the results . in the as - grown state the @xmath0 and @xmath1 states were found in equal ratios within statistical fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast the occurrence of the @xmath1 state [ @xmath0 , resp ] reaches after application of @xmath36{mt}$ ] ( @xmath37{mt}$ ] , resp . ) . </S>",
    "<S> the mean switching field is @xmath38{mt}$ ] with a @xmath39{mt}$ ] distribution . </S>",
    "<S> this value is in close agreement with the numerical simulations presented above  ( @xmath40{mt}$ ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the remaining @xmath41{\\%}$ ] of dots are still found in the @xmath0 [ resp . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath1 ] state . </S>",
    "<S> this lack of switching could result from subtle changes in the arrow - shape of the dots such as an asymmetry , which may induce the departure of the bottom surface vortex at decreasing field , instead of the top one . </S>",
    "<S> this remains to be studied .    </S>",
    "<S> ( a )  fresnel - mode lorentz microscopy of one single dot of thickness @xmath43 as a function of rising ( i .- vi . ) and then decreasing ( vi .- viii . ) field . </S>",
    "<S> ( field of view @xmath44 ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> the in - plane component of the applied field is indicated on each image . </S>",
    "<S> the location of the surface vortex associated with the switching of a nel cap is indicated with an arrow . </S>",
    "<S> ( b )  simulation of fresnel mode images of the switch of nel cap , based on the micromagnetic configurations of b i. , iii . and iv . </S>",
    "<S> the defocusing is @xmath45,width=302 ]    the dots were then investigated under an magnetic field by lorentz microscopy . in the fresnel mode the domain wall is revealed by fringes arising from interferences of electrons having gone through the two longitudinal domainsa . </S>",
    "<S> computed fresnel contrasts based on simulated micromagnetic configurations show that domain walls with parallel ncs give rise to a narrower pattern of fringesb , allowing us to follow in the experiments the location of the propagating surface vortex responsible for the switching of a nc . all features predicted by the simulationsb are thus confirmed : the hysteresis  ( see iv . versus viii . ) ; the translational susceptibility of the surface vortex that is negligible for low field and increases dramatically close to the vicinity of the switching field upon increasing the field  ( i .- v . </S>",
    "<S> , compare with ) ; the negligible or even zero susceptibility before the switching back when the field is decreased  ( vi .- vii . , </S>",
    "<S> compare with ) . </S>",
    "<S> besides as opposite chiralities induce dark or light fringes respectively , the experimental images ( i .- viii . ) taken through the hysteresis demonstrate that the chirality is not affected by the switching of the ncs , neither at rising nor at decreasing field . </S>",
    "<S> this is consistent with xmcd - peem experiments where the occurrence of clockwise and anticlockwise chiralities remained similar for all applied magnetic fields and no cross - correlation between the chirality and the state of the ncs could be evidenced either , within the statistical error bars@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> concerning the polarity of the dw core , which is detectable neither by xmcd - peem nor by lorentz microscopy , we must rely only on the simulations to infer that the core of the dw remains unaffected by the switch of ncs .    to conclude we have demonstrated numerically and experimentally that the direction of magnetization of the nel caps , an internal surface feature of bloch walls , can be switched controllably using a transverse magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> this was achieved in elongated ferromagnetic dots displaying a flux - closure state , so that the domain wall can be manipulated while the domains remain unaffected owing to the internal demagnetizing field@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the switching occurs through the propagation of surface vortices through the ncs . </S>",
    "<S> the selection of the state of the ncs at remanence is made possible by the tilted facets of the dots , which lift the degeneracy between the top and bottom surfaces . </S>",
    "<S> the switching affects neither the chirality of the in - plane domains nor the polarity of the core of the dw . </S>",
    "<S> these results show that at least three degrees of freedom may be addressed independently and reliably in a single magnetic dot , whereas only two had been manipulated so far in the now widely - studied vortex state found in high - symmetry dots . </S>",
    "<S> this fundamental knowledge of the possibility of an internal switching in bloch walls may also be of use for studies of field- or current - driven movement of domain walls , were it is well known that domain walls can undergo topological transformations during their movement@xcite . </S>"
