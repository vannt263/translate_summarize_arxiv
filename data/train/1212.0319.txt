    "the heisenberg uncertainty principle @xcite is one of the most remarkable features of quantum theory which differs quantum world essentially from the classical world .",
    "it sets limits on the precise prediction of the outcomes of two incompatible quantum measurements @xmath0 and @xmath1 on a particle , and is expressed in various forms @xcite .",
    "however , berta _ et al . _",
    "@xcite showed recently that the uncertainty bound imposed by the heisenberg principle could actually be violated with the aid of a quantum memory @xmath2 that is entangled with the particle @xmath3 to be measured .",
    "this quantum - memory - assisted entropic uncertainty relation reads @xcite @xmath4 the equivalent form of which was previously conjectured by renes and boileau @xcite . here , @xmath5 is the conditional von neumann entropy of the density operator @xmath6 , @xmath7 . on the left - hand side ( lhs ) of the inequality",
    ", @xmath8 is that of the postmeasurement state @xmath9 which represents uncertainty of the measurement outcomes of @xmath10 conditioned on the prior information stored in @xmath2 , where @xmath11 with @xmath12 being the eigenstates of @xmath13 , and @xmath14 with @xmath15 quantifies the complementarity of @xmath0 and @xmath1 .    this generalized entropic uncertainty relation has been confirmed in all - optical experiments @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , the related relations expressed by other entropic quantities , such as the rnyi entropy which is important in physical models @xcite , are also exploited @xcite .",
    "since it has a fundamental role , this quantum - memory - assisted entropic uncertainty relation can be studied from various viewpoints @xcite , and can be applied to other quantum information processes @xcite .",
    "the uncertainty relation of eq . differs from its original one @xcite by an additional term @xmath5 .",
    "it is clear that the bound of the entropic uncertainty , the right - hand side of inequality named as the uncertainty bound ( ub ) hereafter , is reduced whenever @xmath16 .",
    "it is remarkable that the quantity of conditional entropy @xmath5 has many important implications in quantum information processing .",
    "its negativity means inseparability @xcite and gives the lower bound of the one - way distillable entanglement for @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "it quantifies partial quantum information @xcite and can be related with quantum correlation measures @xcite .    in this paper , we go one step further from bipartite state @xmath17 to consider its purification @xmath18 or a tripartite state @xmath19 , i.e. , a third party @xmath20 is entangled with both the particle @xmath3 and the memory @xmath2 .",
    "some fundamental and interesting phenomena are found : for example , there exists correlative capacities which indicate the uncertainty reduction of ub because of @xmath2 implies its increasing for other parties ; the changing of ub is induced by competitions of various quantum correlations between different pairs .",
    "these results have important conceptual implications and shed new light on the foundations of quantum mechanics .",
    "we begin with a simple yet meaningful observation . for any three - partite system @xmath21 with density matrix @xmath22 ,",
    "we have @xmath23 which can be proved directly by the strong subadditivity inequality : @xmath24 @xcite . eq .",
    "indicates that whenever @xmath16 , we always have @xmath25 .",
    "therefore , the reduction of the ub on @xmath3 with quantum information stored in @xmath2 excludes its reduction by quantum information stored in @xmath20 .",
    "since the reduction of the ub originates from the quantum correlations established between the measured particle and the quantum memory @xcite , this observation may be interpreted as a fact that particle @xmath3 reaches its potential correlative capacities with the quantum memory @xmath2 in the sense that any other quantum memory except @xmath2 always gives increasing ub of measurement uncertainty on @xmath3 .",
    "inequality also has important physical implications . to be convinced ,",
    "let us consider a variant of the imaginary  uncertainty game \" presented in @xcite : three players , alice ( @xmath3 ) , bob ( @xmath2 ) , and charlie ( @xmath20 ) , share a quantum state @xmath22 , the form of which is known only to bob and charlie .",
    "they begin the game by preagreeing on two measurements @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "alice then measures either @xmath0 or @xmath1 randomly on the particle @xmath3 , and informs bob and charlie of her measurement choice but not the outcome .",
    "what we want to determine here is whether bob and charlie ( communication between them is forbidden ) can predict the outcomes of alice both with improved precision ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] for an illustration ) . as for fixed @xmath0 and @xmath1 , the ub of measurement",
    "is determined only by the conditional entropy @xmath26 for @xmath27 of the observed particle @xmath3 and the quantum memories @xmath28 , and eq . excludes the possibility for @xmath5 and @xmath29 taking the negative values simultaneously , the prediction precision of bob and charlie can not be improved simultaneously in this game ; i.e. , the improvement of bob s prediction precision implies the degradation for that of charlie s , and vice versa . particularly , for pure @xmath6 , eq .",
    "simplifies to @xmath30 , which tells us that the more precisely the measurement outcome is predicted by one participant , the less precisely that will be predicted by the other one . in some sense , one may say that this implies another kind of uncertainty relation , because it sets limits on bob and charlie s ( under the constraint of no communication between them ) ability to predict correctly the measurement outcomes of alice simultaneously ; that is to say , the certainty of prediction for one participant implies the uncertainty of prediction for another participant    the arguments above can also be easily generalized to the @xmath31-player case , i.e. , we have @xmath32 where the particles @xmath33 belong to bob , charlie and daniel , _ et al .",
    "_ , respectively .",
    "this inequality can be proved directly by combination of the strong subadditivity of the von neumann entropy ( theorem 11.14 of @xcite ) and the subadditivity of the conditional entropy ( theorem 11.16 of @xcite ) , and it implies that even for the multiplayer case , the precision of predictions about alice s measurement outcomes can not be improved simultaneously for all of the participants .    also we would like to remark here that the generalized  uncertainty game \" illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] can be immediately tested by similar all - optical setups as those in refs .",
    "next let us consider some quantum correlations and begin with quantum discord @xcite .",
    "the measure of the classical correlation takes the form @xmath34 where @xmath35 , with @xmath36 being the nonselective postmeasurement state of @xmath2 after the positive operator valued measure ( povm ) on @xmath3 , and @xmath37 is the probability for obtaining the outcome @xmath38 .",
    "@xmath39 is usually interpreted as the maximum information gained about @xmath2 with the measurement outcome of @xmath3 .",
    "the quantum discord is then defined by the discrepancy between quantum mutual information @xmath40 and @xmath39 as @xmath41 the quantum discord can therefore be interpreted as the minimal loss of correlations due to the povm @xmath42 .",
    "it survives for states with quantumness of correlation and vanishes for states with only classical correlation .",
    "it attracts much attention recently because of its fundamental role in quantum information processing @xcite . here , we demonstrate a new perspective of quantum discord in the uncertainty principle of quantum mechanics .",
    "assume @xmath18 being the purification of the bipartite state @xmath43 , we first have the following proposition :    _ proposition 1 . _",
    "when the ub on @xmath3 is reduced with the aid of a quantum memory @xmath2 , then both @xmath44 , @xmath39 and the entanglement of formation ( eof ) , @xmath45 , are larger than those between @xmath3 and its purifying system @xmath20 .",
    "_ by using the koashi - winter equality for @xmath46 @xcite , we obtain @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the eof for @xmath49 , defined as @xmath50 @xcite , and the minimum is taken over all pure state decompositions @xmath51 . since @xmath52 , eq .",
    "yields @xmath53 , and therefore @xmath54 .",
    "furthermore , by combining eqs . and , we obtain an equivalent form of the koashi - winter equalities @xmath55 which gives @xmath56 , and hence @xmath57 .",
    "finally , to prove @xmath58 , we note that the conditional entropy @xmath16 is equivalent to @xmath59 for @xmath46 .",
    "therefore by using the chain rule @xcite , we derive @xmath60 which implies @xmath61 , and thus completes the proof .    in fact , from eqs .",
    ", , and @xmath62 , with @xmath63 ( @xmath64 or @xmath20 ) @xcite , we can obtain @xmath65 thus , @xmath57 and @xmath54 are in fact equivalent , i.e. , the fulfillment of one inequality implies the holding of another one .",
    "moreover , we point out here that even for mixed @xmath22 , we still have @xmath54 .",
    "this is because for any @xmath22 with the purification @xmath66 , we always have @xmath67 , where the first inequality originates from proposition 1 ( by taking @xmath68 as a combined system ) , and the second one is due to the fact that the classical correlation is nonincreasing under local quantum operations @xcite .",
    ". also implies that @xmath69 , which can be convinced by the koashi - winter equalities @xmath70 and @xmath71 . by combining this with @xmath72 [ an equivalent form of eq . ] and @xmath73 , we further obtain @xmath74 this equation indicates that when the ub on @xmath3 is reduced , the quantum discord @xmath75 is upper bounded by eof between @xmath3 and the quantum memory @xmath2 and lower bounded by eof between @xmath3 and the purifying system @xmath20 .",
    "furthermore , for pure @xmath46 eq . turns into @xmath30 , therefore by combining this with the koashi - winter equalities of the equivalent form of eq .",
    ", we have @xmath76 , and hence eq . also means @xmath77 .",
    "we now discuss the physical mechanism responsible for changing ub . from the proof of proposition 1 we know that @xmath78 and therefore @xmath5 is determined by the competition between the quantum discords @xmath79 and @xmath44 .",
    "this relation has also been noted by fanchini _",
    "it explains why the ub is not a monotonic function of the quantum discord between @xmath3 and the quantum memory @xmath2 , as while @xmath44 increases , @xmath79 may also increases but with a faster rate , and as a result , this induces the increase of the uncertainty with increasing @xmath44 . to be explicit , we consider the mixed state @xmath6 of the following form @xmath80 where @xmath81 in the standard basis @xmath82 .",
    "the purification @xmath46 for this state can be written as @xmath83 which is just the generalized _ w _ state @xcite .",
    "for the purification @xmath46 of eq .",
    ", both the reduced states @xmath6 and @xmath84 have the x structure , and therefore the discords @xmath44 and @xmath79 can be determined analytically @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] we plot dependence of @xmath5 , @xmath44 , and @xmath79 on @xmath85 with @xmath86 , i.e. , @xmath87 .",
    "one can see that @xmath5 , and thus the ub , increases with increasing values of both @xmath44 and @xmath79 when @xmath88 $ ] , and decreases with decreasing values of both @xmath44 and @xmath79 when @xmath89 $ ] . as illustrated in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] with @xmath90 $ ] , this counterintuitive phenomenon is caused by the more quickly increasing rate of @xmath79 ( the dashed blue line ) compared with that of @xmath44 ( the solid red line ) .",
    "out of the above @xmath85 regions , either @xmath44 increases more rapidly than that of @xmath79 , or @xmath44 increases while @xmath79 decreases , and therefore the ub decreases with increasing @xmath44 .",
    "so the behavior of ub depends on the competition of quantum discords .",
    "recently , xi _",
    "proposed the concept of one - way unlocalizable quantum discord @xcite , which is in some sense dual to quantum discord @xcite . here , we present some analysis of the quantum - memory - assisted entropic uncertainty relation based on this measure of correlations . by using the same semiological rules as ref .",
    "@xcite , we denote @xmath91 as the entanglement of assistance for @xmath92 @xcite , while @xmath93 as the one - way unlocalizable entanglement @xcite , and @xmath94 as the one - way unlocalizable quantum discord @xcite , both for @xmath92 with measurements on @xmath95 , and @xmath96 .",
    "then we have the following result :    _ proposition 2 .",
    "_ when the ub on @xmath3 is reduced with the aid of a quantum memory @xmath2 , then both @xmath97 and @xmath98 are always satisfied",
    ".    _ proof .",
    "_ by using the buscemi - gour - kim equality @xcite , we have @xmath99 substraction of the second equality of eq . from that of the first one",
    "gives rise to @xmath100 , and hence @xmath97 .",
    "furthermore , combination of the definition of the one - way unlocalizable quantum discord @xcite with the buscemi - gour - kim equality @xcite implies @xmath101 then we have @xmath102 , and therefore @xmath98 .",
    "this proposition implies that when the ub on @xmath3 is reduced using the information stored in a quantum memory @xmath2 , then both the one - way unlocalizable entanglement and the one - way unlocalizable quantum discord between @xmath3 and @xmath2 are always larger than those between @xmath3 and the purifying system @xmath20 . this reinforces the interpretation of the potential maximal correlations between @xmath3 and @xmath2 as the essential element responsible for the reduction of the measurement uncertainty in eq . .",
    "as the negativity of the conditional entropy plays such an important role in improving the prediction precision of the uncertainty game , we now present some possible structures of @xmath6 ensuring @xmath16 . by noting the araki - lieb inequality",
    "@xcite @xmath103 we see that if @xmath104 , then @xmath105 due to the non - negativity of the von neumann entropy .",
    "@xmath5 is negative if @xmath106 , i.e. , @xmath107 , with @xmath108 being the orthonormal basis of @xmath109 .",
    "recently , a necessary and sufficient equality condition for the inequality was derived in @xcite .",
    "it states that @xmath104 if and only if the complex hilbert space @xmath110 can be factorized as @xmath111 such that @xmath112 with @xmath113 .",
    "in fact , for state @xmath6 of eq . , we have @xmath114 by using the additivity of the von neumann entropy @xcite , and therefore @xmath115 .",
    "combination of this with eq .",
    "gives @xmath116 . since quantum correlation can not exist without classical correlation @xcite , this further implies @xmath117 and @xmath118 , which confirms the arguments presented in proposition 1 , namely , @xmath57 and @xmath54 if @xmath16 .    as an explicit example , consider a qubit - qudit system with @xmath119 in the standard basis @xmath120 .",
    "as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , this state can be factorized as in eq . with @xmath121 and @xmath122 , and as a result gives the negative conditional entropy @xmath123 .",
    "finally , note that eq .",
    "is only a sufficient condition for the negativity of @xmath5 , and there are bipartite states @xmath6 ensuring @xmath16 , but can not be factorized into the form of eq . .",
    "an obvious example of such states is the two - qubit werner state @xmath124 @xcite , with @xmath125 and @xmath126 .",
    "to summarize , we have established some new physical implications of the quantum - memory - assisted entropic uncertainty relation from the perspective of correlative capacities , which are captured by the concepts of quantum discord , eof , and the one - way unlocalizable quantum discord .",
    "the changing of the uncertainty bound is a result of competitions of various correlations between different players .",
    "we showed that whenever the prediction precision is improved compared with that with only classical memory , the observed particle @xmath3 reaches its potential maximal correlative capacities with the quantum memory @xmath2 in the sense that their correlations ( both quantum and classical ) are always larger than those between @xmath3 and the purifying system @xmath20 .",
    "we hope these results may shed some new light on exploring the physical implications of the entropic uncertainty principle , especially from the perspective of quantum correlations .    as a concluding remark",
    ", we point out that the resulting certainty on the prediction of the measurement outcomes of two incompatible observables with the aid of a quantum memory may imply another kind of uncertainty .",
    "this is convinced by a variant of the  uncertainty game \" with more than two players , e.g. , the three - player case illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] , which shows that the more precisely the measurement outcomes of alice are predicted by bob , the less precisely that will be predicted by charlie , and vice versa .",
