    "the cosmic history of galaxy mass assembly represents one of the open key questions in cosmology .",
    "early - type galaxies ( etgs ) are the most effective probes to investigate this topic , as they are the most massive and oldest galaxies in the local universe and most likely those whose stars formed earliest .",
    "observations have shown that a population of massive and passive galaxies is already in place at high redshift , when the universe was only a few gyr old ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "so far , the main physical parameters related to their formation and assembly have been mainly estimated on local etgs , and their ageing and evolution can mix up and confuse the original properties when the bulk of their mass formed and assembled .",
    "information on the star formation ( sf ) time - scale of high-_z _ etgs can be obtained from the detailed chemical abundance ratios of their stellar populations @xcite , which can be derived by a detailed spectral analysis .",
    "indeed , the abundance of iron with respect to @xmath8-elements is tightly correlated with the time delay between type i and type ii supernovae ( sn ) , giving a direct probe of the time - scale within which sf has occurred .    up to now",
    ", only few works have experimented a spectral analysis on etgs at _ z _ @xmath11 ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) due to the low s / n of the available spectroscopic data , and they were mostly focused on age estimates , in particular using the @xmath12 region @xcite .",
    "the analysis of the rest - frame optical spectrum is still lacking .",
    "furthermore , measures are usually performed on stacked spectra @xcite , thus deleting possible peculiarities of single objects .    a single - object measurement of age , stellar metallicity and chemical abundance ratios of _ z _ @xmath13 etgs is missing at the present time .",
    "we fill this gap , presenting the first attempt to measure the detailed chemical composition , besides age , of a _ z _ @xmath14 etg directly in the early stages of its evolution .    throughout this paper , we assume a standard cosmology with h@xmath15 km s@xmath16 mpc@xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "our target is a bright and massive ( @xmath19 m@xmath20 ) etg from the k - selected galaxy catalog in the cosmos ( cosmological evolution survey ) field @xcite .",
    "it is one of the @xmath21 galaxies with k@xmath22(vega ) @xmath23 selected by @xcite on the basis of three criteria : ( i ) non - detection at @xmath24 @xmath25 m in the _ _ spitzer__+mips data @xcite ; ( ii ) visual elliptical morphology ( see fig . [ spettro ] , top panel ) ; ( iii ) multicolor spectral energy distribution ( sed ) consistent with old and passive stellar populations with no dust reddening .",
    "all available information are shown in table [ tab : info ] . for further details see @xcite and @xcite .    [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : results ]    we have performed a detailed spectroscopic analysis of a _",
    "_ z__=1.426 , massive ( @xmath26 ) , early - type galaxy .",
    "we gain strong evidence of a high stellar metallicity and @xmath8-enhancement , and old ( relative to its redshift ) age ( table [ tab : results ] ) .",
    "these quantities constrain the past sf history experienced by the galaxy . in particular , the [ @xmath8/fe ] ratio , quantifying the time delay between type ii sn events , responsible of the production of @xmath8-elements , and the type ia sns , related to the formation of fe - peak elements , allows to determine the sf time - scale @xcite . the high value [ @xmath8/fe ]",
    "@xmath27 obtained for @xmath28 is a direct signature that its sf time - scale must have been short .",
    "in particular , adopting the simple theoretical modelling of @xcite , where the sf is modelled with a gaussian function , we obtain a time - scale @xmath29 t @xmath30 gyr covering the interval within which @xmath31 of the stars were formed .",
    "considering also the old age of its stellar content , this suggests that @xmath28 formed the bulk of its stars at _ z@xmath5 _ @xmath6 within a short time - scale of @xmath29 t @xmath32 gyr and then passively evolved over the following @xmath33 gyr .    with the high [ @xmath8/fe ] value suggesting a short sf time scale for @xmath28 , the clear indication for an extremely high total",
    "metallicity opens new issues on the gas enrichment history of the universe .",
    "it is worth emphasising that the global integrated metallicity of the local etgs never reaches values higher than the @xmath34 z@xmath20 .",
    "indeed , we considered the local sample analysed in @xcite and quickly verified that the metallicity and [ @xmath8/fe ] values of @xmath28 together with its velocity dispersion estimate , are not included in the local distribution of values , even if such high values of z and [ @xmath8/fe ] are expected for dense etgs as suggested by these scaling relations .",
    "thus , this suggests that this galaxy must experience mass accretion events ( minor merging ) from _ z _ @xmath35 to _ z _ @xmath36 which will move it on the observed local scaling relations towards lower values of both z and @xmath37 , diluting the extreme metallicity stars and confining them in the central part of the galaxy . indeed ,",
    "such extreme metallicity values are in some cases found in the inner core of local massive etgs ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) which are known to show metallicity gradients @xcite .",
    "we calculated that adding e.g. @xmath38 of a sub - solar metallicity component , as in the case of dwarf galaxies , to @xmath28 would decrease the measure of its average metallicity to the local observed values . on the other hand ,",
    "the gas metallicities up to now measured in _ z _ @xmath39 star forming galaxies result to be solar or sub - solar , and do not match at all the high stellar value measured in our target galaxy @xcite and in the centers of local etgs @xcite . it is out of the aims of the present paper to suggest a possible explanation of this missing detection of high-_z _ high metallicity gas .",
    "a possibility is that the lower gas metallicity comes from dilution through infalling primeval gas , or selective mass loss of metals in galactic winds . at the same time , the estimate of the metallicity of the broad line regions in quasars at _ z _ @xmath40 reveals gaseous metallicities even higher than the stellar one reported here @xcite , suggesting the possibility that their enriched gas is involved in the initial sf events of ( at least some ) high-_z _ massive proto - elliptical galaxies .",
