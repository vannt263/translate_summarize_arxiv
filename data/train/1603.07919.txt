    "sensitivity analysis is an important aspect of the responsible use of hydraulic models .",
    "such approach allows the identification of the key parameters impacting model performance @xcite . global sensitivity analysis",
    "( gsa ) aims at ranking the input parameters variability effects on model s output variability .",
    "only few studies have performed gsa on hydraulic models . indeed , this type of approach is not straight forward , as it requires adaptation of methods and tools development .",
    "these aspects being time consuming , not without standing the heavy computational cost of such type of approach , it represents an important investment for applied practitioners community and is therefore still at an exploratory level . nevertheless , dealing with uncertainties in hydraulic models is a press - forward concern for both practitioners @xcite and new guidance @xcite . in practical flood event modelling applications ,",
    "mostly uses standard industrial codes relying on shallow water equations ( swes ) either in 1d ( _ e.g. _ mascaret @xcite , mike 11 @xcite _ etc . _ ) or 2d ( _ e.g. _ telemac 2d @xcite , mike 21 @xcite , isis2d @xcite _ etc .",
    "the aim of using hydraulic models is to provide information on simulated flood event properties such as maximal water depth or flood spatial extent .",
    "eventually outputs of the models are used for design or safety assessment purpose . in hydraulics , deterministic mathematical models",
    "aim at representing natural phenomena with different levels of complexity in the mathematical formulation of the physical phenomena depending on underlying simplifying assumptions .",
    "these assumptions will influence the domain of validity and of application of the models .",
    "consequently , it will impact accuracy standards which should be expected from models results .",
    "an analytical solution to swe exists from a mathematical point of view only when the problem is well - posed , which is generally not the case in practical river flood modelling engineering applications @xcite .",
    "moreover , equations are resolved using computer codes , which will discretely approach the continuous solutions of these equations ( when mathematically existing ) .",
    "numerical approach implemented in these codes can be various and different level of accuracy can be expected depending on the numerical method . in deterministic hydraulic codes ,",
    "input parameters are variables which are known with a certain level of confidence .",
    "eventually , modeller choices to design models and computation optimization can introduce high variability in results . in hydraulic models , sources of uncertainties can be classified in three categories : ( @xmath0 ) hypothesis in mathematical description of the natural phenomena , ( @xmath1 ) numerical aspects when solving the equations , and ( @xmath2 ) input parameters of the model .",
    "the uncertainties related to input parameters are of prime interest for applied practitioners willing to decrease uncertainties in theirs models results .",
    "hydraulic models input parameters are either of hydrological , hydraulic , topographical or numerical type .",
    "identification , classification and impact quantification of sources of uncertainties , on a given model output , are a set of analysis steps which will enable to ( @xmath0 ) analyze uncertainties behavior in a given modelling problem , ( @xmath1 ) elaborate methods for reducing uncertainties on a model output , and ( @xmath2 ) communicate on relevant uncertainties . uncertainty analysis ( ua ) and sensitivity analysis ( sa ) methods are useful tools , as they allow robustness of model predictions to be checked and help to identify input parameters influences .",
    "ua consists in the propagation of uncertainty sources through the model , and then focus on the quantification of uncertainties in model output and propagating them through the model predictions @xcite .",
    "it allows robustness of model results to be checked .",
    "various methods are then available to rank parameters regarding their impact on results variability ( such as sobol index @xcite ) .",
    "this process goes one step beyond ua and constitutes a global sensitivity analysis ( gsa ) . in practice ,",
    "such type of approach is of a great interest , but is still at an exploratory level in applied studies relying on 2d swe codes .",
    "indeed , gsa approach implementation is challenging , as it requires specific tools and deals with important computational capacity .",
    "with 1d free surface hydraulic codes , applied tools and methodology for uncertainty propagation and for gsa have been developed by irsn and companie nationale du rhne ( cnr ) @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the study presented in this paper is to apply a protocol and to provide a tool , allowing adaptable and ready - to use gsa for 2d hydraulic modelling applications .",
    "sections developed in this paper present the concept of gsa applied to 2d hydraulic modelling approach through the presentation ( @xmath0 ) of the gsa concept , ( @xmath1 ) of implemented protocol and ( @xmath2 ) of developed operational tools .",
    "a proof of concept to illustrate feasibility of the approach is given , based on a 2d flood river event modelling in nice ( france ) low var valley .",
    "a regular sensitivity analysis aims to study how the variations of model input parameters impact the models outputs .",
    "objectives with this approach are mostly to identify the parameter or set of parameters which significantly impact models outputs @xcite .",
    "for instance , sa screening approach is a variance - base method which allows to identify input variables which have negligible effects , from those which have linear , non - linear or combinatory effects significantly impacting variability of results output . this can be useful for models with a large set of input parameters assumed to introduce uncertainty , to reduce the number of input parameters to consider in a given sa study .",
    "local sa focuses on fixed point in the space of the input .",
    "the aim is here to address model behavior near parameters nominal value to safely assume local linear dependence on the parameter .",
    "more details about these sa methods and their application to practical engineering problems can be found in @xcite .",
    "a gsa aims to quantify the output uncertainty in the input factors , given by their uncertainty range and distribution @xcite . to do so ,",
    "the deterministic code ( 2d hydraulic code in our case ) is considered as a black box model as described in @xcite : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the model function , @xmath6 are @xmath7 independent input random variables with known distribution and @xmath8 is the output random variable .",
    "the principle of gsa method relies on estimation of inputs variables variance contribution to output variance .",
    "a unique functional analysis of variance ( anova ) decomposition of any integral function into a sum of elementary functions allows to define the sensitivity indices as explained in @xcite .",
    "sobol s indices are defined as follow : @xmath9/var(y).\\label{eq : sobol}\\ ] ] to implement a gsa approach , it is necessary ( @xmath0 ) to identify inputs and assess their probability distribution , ( @xmath1 ) to propagate uncertainty within the model and ( @xmath2 ) to rank the effects of input variability on the output variability through functional variance decomposition method such as calculation of sobol indices .",
    "the first two steps constitute an uncertainty analysis ( ua ) which is a compulsory stage of the gsa . for the first step of the ua",
    ", each input parameter is considered as a random value where both , choice of considered input parameter and choice of probability distribution of the input random values , have to be set up .",
    "the assessment of selected uncertain parameters and their probability distribution is completed according to expert opinion or by statistical analysis for measured values if sufficient measured data sets are available .",
    "the first two steps lead to define probability density function constructed to represent uncertainty of selected input parameters for the study .",
    "it has to be emphasized that this step of the gsa process is important and strongly subjective @xcite .",
    "propagation of uncertainty is then required ( step @xmath1 of the ua ) , all sources of uncertainties are varied simultaneously , which is classically done using monte - carlo techniques or more parsimonious monte - carlo like approach @xcite .",
    "controlling the convergence of the uncertainty propagation gives an idea if the sample of simulations is large enough to allow consistent statistical analysis . in practice , convergence of estimated sensitivity indices and their confidence interval can be plotted and examined visually @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the decision whether the level of convergence is satisfactory or not , depends on arbitrary decision of the operator regarding desired accuracy and confidence interval on the accuracy .",
    "eventually , gsa can be performed to calculate sobol index .",
    "first - order sobol index indicates the contribution to the output variance of the main effect of each input parameters .",
    "total - order sobol index measures the contribution to the output variance including all variance caused by interactions between uncertain input parameters @xcite .",
    "the production of sobol index spatial distribution map is promising .",
    "moreover , such maps have been done in other application fields such as hydrology , hydrogeology and flood risk cost estimation @xcite .",
    "an overview of gsa approach is presented in fig .",
    "this type of general protocol for gsa has already been applied to 1d hydraulic model @xcite .",
    "common aspects arise between 1d and 2d models hydraulic application to implement a gsa approach and are described step by step below : the first step ( step @xmath0 , in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , identifies the input parameters of the hydraulic code to be considered for the analysis . in hydraulic models , the mains input parameters to consider are : @xmath0 ) geometric parameters , spatial discretization , hydraulic and numerical parameters .",
    "the geometric parameters , in 1d models , are represented as cross section , whereas in 2d models digital elevation model ( dem ) are included as component of geometric parameter .",
    "another important geometrical aspect to consider as an input parameter introducing uncertainty is the spatial discretization .",
    "the spatial discretization can be considered as a geometrical and a numerical parameter .",
    "indeed spatial discretization impacts both the level of details of the geometry included in calculation and numerical stability of calculation as , @xmath10 ( and @xmath11 in 2d ) impact cfl criterion .",
    "hydraulic parameters are mainly initial , boundary conditions and energy loses coefficient .",
    "such parameters are introduced in models under the form of water level , discharge or flow velocity field or friction coefficients .",
    "geometric and hydraulic variables can be measured or estimated ; as a result they are often subject to a high level of uncertainty .",
    "numerical parameters are related to numerical method and solver included in numerical scheme . broadly speaking",
    ", input numerical parameters will be those related to cfl number ( @xmath12 and @xmath10 ) , parameters impacting accuracy of solver ( numbers of iteration or order of solver method for instance ) as well as parameters impacting numerical diffusion and dispersion .",
    "once input parameters are selected , a probability density function has to be attributed to each parameter , in order to distribute input parameters .",
    "as previously mentioned , probability density function are most often related to expert opinion .",
    "the most common used distributions in hydraulic studies are normal or triangular distribution @xcite .",
    "uniform distribution is used as well , when no clear idea can be made up regarding the distribution of a given parameter variability . by assuming equi - probability of the realization @xmath7 of a variable , uniform distribution",
    "will then maximize the uncertainty ( entropy ) of the input parameter . to apply a gsa ,",
    "the input parameters are assumed to be independent .",
    "this specific point should be considered at this stage of the gsa , as sometimes selected input parameters can be strongly correlated in some cases .",
    "for example , in hydraulic model dependences between flow and linear energy loses properties ( represented by chzy , manning or strickler law ) are present . the second step ( step @xmath1 , in fig . [ fig1 ] )",
    "results in the propagation of the distributed input parameters within the selected hydraulic model .",
    "hydraulic codes ( 1d and 2d ) are based on the same sets of equations which are the swe , as written as follow in 2d @xcite : @xmath13 where the unknowns are the velocities @xmath14 and @xmath15 @xmath16 $ ] and the water height @xmath17 @xmath18 $ ] , and where @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) is the opposite of the slope and @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) the linear energy losses in @xmath23-direction ( resp .",
    "@xmath24-direction ) . therefore ,",
    "underlying hypothesis in the mathematical description of the physical process are similar for 1d and 2d models : ( @xmath0 ) uniform @xmath25 ( and uniform @xmath26 in 2d ) velocity for a given mesh cell , ( @xmath1 ) horizontal free surface at a given cell , ( @xmath2 ) vertical hydrostatic pressure and ( iv ) energy losses are represented through chzy , manning or strickler formulas @xcite . as previously mentioned , the model is considered as a black box as described concerning for application of the gsa . for each specific source of uncertainty , @xmath27 independent realizations",
    "are generated using monte - carlo techniques .",
    "the number of realizations has to be large enough to reach convergence of the interest variable .",
    "histograms are commonly plotted to ensure that output parameters follow a normal distribution .",
    "moreover , spatially distributed results of the variable of interest can then be analyzed .",
    "the third step ( step @xmath2 , in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) and final step of gsa approach is the calculation of the sobol indices and the evaluation of the model outputs robustness .",
    "analysing gsa results , the model user has a better understanding and quantification of its models uncertainties .      to apply a gsa with 2d hydraulic models ,",
    "a coupling between promthe a code allowing a parametric environment of other codes , has been performed with fullswof_2d , a two - dimensional swe based hydraulic code .",
    "the coupling procedure has taken advantage of previous coupling experience of promthe with 1d swe based hydraulic code @xcite .",
    "the coupled code promthe - fullswof ( p - fs ) has been performed on a hpc computation structure .",
    "fullswof_2d ( full shallow water equation for overland flow in 2 dimensions ) is a code developed as a free software based on 2d swe @xcite . in fullswof_2d , the 2d swe are solved thanks to a well - balanced finite volume scheme based on the hydrostatic reconstruction @xcite . the finite volume scheme , which is suited for a system of conservation low , is applied on a structured spatial discretization , using regular cartesian mesh . for the temporal discretization ,",
    "a variable time step is used based on the cfl criterion .",
    "the hydrostatic reconstruction ( which is a well - balanced numerical strategy ) allows to ensure that the numerical treatment of the system preserves water depth positivity and does not create numerical oscillation in case of a steady states , where pressures in the flux are balanced with the source term here ( topography ) .",
