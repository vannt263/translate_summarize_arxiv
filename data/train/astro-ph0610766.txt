    "various observations covered well in this volume indicate the existence of structure in the neutral and ionized ism on au spatial scales , causing concern about how well we understand the basics of the ism physics . in the straightforward interpretation",
    ", these clouds should be extremely overdense and and overpressured .",
    "evaporation arguments point to very short lifetimes of such clouds , yet the au - scale structures in the diffuse medium seem quite common . in this volume",
    "the reader can find many articles dealing with the observed properties of sins .",
    "therefore we do not dwell upon this issue .",
    "instead we adopt a broad theoretical approach and ask a question whether turbulence can produce enough activity on small scales to be considered as a potential source of sins .",
    "the attractiveness of turbulence as an origin of sins is that it can produce a generic universal explanation .",
    "indeed , turbulence is really ubiquitous in astrophysics , including the ism and circumstellar regions .",
    "however , the most popular kolmogorov turbulence model can not account for sins .",
    "kolmogorov turbulence has a spectrum of @xmath0 , the fluctuations of density at scale @xmath1 arisen from advection by turbulence are @xmath2 , i.e. they decrease with the scale .",
    "sins , on the contrary , are connected to rather large density contrasts at small scales .",
    "this would violate the assumption of kolmogorov turbulence that it is only weakly compressive at large outer scale .",
    "fortunately , astrophysical turbulence is not limited to the kolmogorov spectrum .",
    "if the spectrum of density fluctuations scales as @xmath3 , @xmath4 , then @xmath5 increases with the decrease of turbulence scale .    as we see from the example above , in terms of turbulence ,",
    "the origin of sins is a quantitative question related to the spectra of turbulent motions .",
    "this question can not be dealt using brute force of computers .",
    "indeed , from the point of view of fluid mechanics astrophysical turbulence is characterized by huge reynolds numbers , @xmath6 , which is the inverse ratio of the eddy turnover time of a parcel of gas to the time required for viscous forces to slow it appreciably .",
    "for @xmath7 we expect gas to be turbulent and this is exactly what we observe in hi ( for hi @xmath8 ) .",
    "in fact , very high astrophysical @xmath6 and its magnetic counterpart magnetic reynolds number @xmath9 ( that can be as high as @xmath10 ) present a big problem for numerical simulations that can not possibly get even close to the astrophysically - motivated numbers .",
    "the currently available 3d simulations can have @xmath6 and @xmath9 up to @xmath11 . both scale as the size of the box to the first power , while the computational effort increases as the fourth power ( 3 coordinates + time ) , it is not feasible to resolve the actual interstellar turbulent cascade to test whether sins somehow emerge at the end of it .",
    "another approach based on ( a ) establishing scaling relations that can be tested with the modern computers and ( b ) testing these relations with observational data seems promissing . in what follows",
    "we discuss the part ( a ) . part ( b )",
    "is addressed in a recent review by lazarian ( 2006 ) .",
    "a very important insight into the incompressible mhd turbulence by goldreich & shridhar ( 1995 ) ( henceforth gs95 ) has been followed by progress in understanding of compressible mhd turbulence ( lithwick & goldreich 2001 , cho & lazarian 2003 , henceforth cl03 , cho , lazarian & vishniac 2003 ) . in particular , simulation in cho & lazarian ( 2003 ) showed that alfvnic cascade evolves on its own , where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the alfvn and sound velocities respectively .",
    "however , the coupling gets marginal at smaller scales as turbulence cascades and turbulent velocities get smaller . ] and it exhibits kolmogorov type scaling ( i.e. @xmath14 ) and scale - dependent anisotropy of the goldreich - shridhar type ( i.e. @xmath15 ) even for high mach number turbulence . while slow modes exhibit similar scalings and anisotropy , fast modes show isotropy .",
    "the density scaling obtained in cho & lazarian ( 2003 ) was somewhat puzzling . at low mach numbers it was similar to slow modes , while it got isotropic for high mach numbers .",
    "density power spectrum shallower than the kolmogorov one was reported in a number of observations ( deshpande , dwarakanath & goss 2000 , padoan et al 2003 ) and the relation between the sins and the shallow power spectrum was advocated in deshpande ( 2000 ) .    for high mach numbers we expect shocks to develop ;",
    "the density should be perturbed most dramatically by those shocks .",
    "naively , one would think that density perturbations will have a random - shock spectrum of @xmath16 which leaves very little perturbation on small scales .",
    "also , in sub - alfvnic turbulence magnetic field is dynamically important , so we expect to observe some anisotropy which is typical for magnetic turbulence . none of these two properties is actually observed in simulations .",
    "on the contrary , the spectrum was typically rather shallow and there was no significant anisotropy .",
    "this mystery is resolved as follows : shocks in isothermal fluid can have very large density contrasts , up to sonic mach squared , however the conservation of mass and positive sign of density allows only small regions with high - density or clumps .",
    "these clumps totally dominate the spectrum of density .",
    "being close to delta - functions , they generate rather shallow spectrum .",
    "being distributed randomly in space , they mask any anisotropy originally present due to alfvnic shearing .",
    "our calculations in beresnyak , lazarian & cho ( 2006 , henceforth blc06 ) demonstrated that the spectrum of density for high mach number mhd turbulence is shallow ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "this potentially may be important for sins , although we do not attempt to provide quantitative arguments for this at the present stage .",
    "the rms deviation of density for a subsonic case is consistent with prediction @xmath17 for low beta ( cl03 ) , and the rms deviation of log - density for supersonic case is around unity regardless of a mach number .",
    "the distributions are notably broader for higher mach numbers , though .",
    "dimension of the high - density structures is between 1 and 2 , being viewed as a flatted filaments or elongated pancakes .",
    "there were no evident preferred orientation of these structures along or perpendicular to the mean magnetic field .",
    "maximum density value in a mach 10 data cube was around @xmath18 .",
    "we also noted in blc06 that the randomly distributed high - density clumps suppress any anisotropy originating from motions at small scales .    in magnetically dominated medium",
    "that we deal with it is reasonable to assume that the corresponding shocks move material along magnetic field lines the same way that the slow modes do in subsonic case .",
    "the shocks are randomly oriented and therefore the clumpy structure that we observe does not reveal any noticeable anisotropy .",
    "in fact , the density perturbations associated with such shocks should not be correlated with the magnetic field strength enhancement , which our data analysis confirms .",
    "note , that due to different reasons , this correlation also weak for density fluctuations induced by slow modes low mach number mhd turbulence ( see cl03 ) .",
    "interestingly enough , similar results in terms of shallow density spectrum are seen in pure high mach number hydrodynamic simulations ( kim & ryu 2005 ) .",
    "this reinforces the idea that the primary mechanism for generating of flat spectrum of density is the random multiplication / division of density in supersonic flows which , together with mass conservation , form isolated high peaks of density .",
    "does this mean that magnetic field is totally unimportant for the structure of density in supersonic turbulence ?",
    "not at all  we were able to reveal the underlying density structure , that comes from alfvnic shearing by using a log - density instead of density for spectra and structure functions .",
    "the structure function of log - density have shown very familiar goldreich - sridhar scale - dependent anisotropy , typical for almost any quantity in sub - alfvnic compressible turbulence ( see fig .",

    "the explanation of the shallow spectrum of density presented above suggests that if we include gravity the clumps will be denser and the power spectrum of density will be flatter or could be even rising ( @xmath23-functions will give the 1d power spectrum of @xmath24 )    in terms of the relation to sins , we may note , that cooling may make interstellar gas more pliable to compression than the isothermal gas that we used in the simulations .",
    "this , could result in more density contrast when the original gas is warm .",
    "this calls for detailed studies that include cooling .",
    "in this section we describe a new mechanism to transfer turbulent energy to small scales bypassing the usual turbulent cascade .",
    "this mechanism , described in lazarian & beresnyak ( 2006 ) allow us to have relatively large - amplitude slab - type alfvenic perturbations on small scales . even though mhd alfven waves do not perturb density , small - scale kinetic alfven waves ( kaw ) do .",
    "also the slab alfven waves in a compressible media is subject to the well - known parametric instability that produces density perturbations .    the close connection between the cosmic ray ( cr ) power - law and the turbulence power - law is the point that was stressed by randy jokipii in many of his presentations ( see jokipii 2001 ) .",
    "the physical essence of this relation and , in fact , the very understanding of the interaction of cr and turbulence are currently the issues of intensive research .",
    "it is well known that the propagation of cr depends on the scaling of the ism turbulence .",
    "most of the studies in the field use isotropic or slab - like alfvenic turbulence the origin of which does not follow from either theoretical models of mhd turbulence ( see goldreich & shridhar 1995 ; review by cho & lazarian 2005 and references therein ) or numerical simulations of mhd turbulence ( see cho & lazarian 2003 and references therein ) . on the contrary ,",
    "the interactions of alfvenic turbulence with scale dependent anisotropy that is consistent with both theoretical predictions and numerics were shown to be inefficient for cosmic ray scattering ( chandran 2000 , yan & lazarian 2002 ) . using the scalings for fast modes obtained in cho & lazarian ( 2003 ) , yan & lazarian ( 2002 )",
    "identified fast modes as the principal scattering agent for standard models of mhd turbulence , provided that the energy is injected at scales larger than a pc . in this model that follows from this work the differences in damping of fast modes result in the differences in cr propagation in different ism phases",
    "this induces substantial changes on the models of cr propagation in our galaxy ( yan & lazarian 2004 ) and in clusters of galaxies ( brunetti & lazarian 2006 ) .    while the above changes of the picture of cr propagation and possibly acceleration are inevitable in the quasi - linear models of scattering by mhd turbulence injected at large scales , in an astrophysically realistic situation with the pressure of crs close to thermal or magnetic pressure , it is reasonable to ask whether the feedback of crs to mhd turbulence is important .",
    "this question was addressed in lazarian & beresnyak ( 2006 ) .",
    "crs react very differently from ordinary gas when the magnetized fluid is compressed , if the scale of compression is less than cr mean free path .",
    "such scale compressions or expansions change only the component of cr momentum that is perpendicular to magnetic field ( due to the so - called `` adiabatic invariant '' conservation ) , while the component of the momentum parallel to magnetic field stays the same .",
    "such state is , however , unstable .",
    "we calculated the rate of cr kinetic instability that transfers energy to small scales , creating small - scale alfvenic perturbations that are not a part of the global mhd cascade .",
    "these perturbations are more like waves moving along magnetic field lines and thus are very different from highly anisotropic gs95 alfvenic modes .",
    "quantitatively , we consider a power - law distribution of crs @xmath25 where @xmath26 is conveniently defined as the power - law index for a one - dimensional distribution ( or particle density ) .",
    "for example , around the earth @xmath27 up to the energies of @xmath28  ev",
    ". the the growth rate of the cosmic - ray - alfvn gyroresonance instability ( henceforth gi ) can be estimated as : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the number density of crs with momentum larger than the minimal resonant momentum for a wave vector value of @xmath31 , @xmath32 is the proton mass , @xmath33 is the density of the thermal plasma , @xmath34 is the ion plasma frequency .",
    "@xmath35 is a numerical factor that depends on the index of cosmic rays @xmath26 .",
    "the @xmath36 sign corresponds to the two mhd modes .",
    "we shall concentrate on the alfvn mode , corresponding to the plus sign , as those are less subjected to linear damping .",
    "we show that when anisotropy is created by compressive turbulence , the anisotropy factor @xmath37 is small and changes its sign on the scale of the mean free path , depending on two competitive mechanisms  scattering which tends to isotropize momentum distribution , and magnetic field compression which tends to make it oblate or prolate .    assuming that anisotropy arises from the turbulent compressions with amplitude @xmath38 at large scale , the factor @xmath39 is equal to @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the alfven velocity .",
    "then the expression for the instability rate can be written as @xmath42 where @xmath43 is a larmor radius of a cr resonant with a particular wave vector @xmath44 , @xmath45 is the 1  gev proton larmor radius and @xmath46 this cr instability gets energy from external turbulent compressions of cr at the mean free path scale and directly transfers it to scale of the cr larmor radius .",
    "there are two non - linear processes limit the growth rate of the instability .",
    "first of all , the magnetic perturbations generated at the larmor radius of cr backreact on cr by limiting the mean free path @xmath47 . if the change of magnetic field direction is @xmath48 the scattering that is a random walk requires @xmath49 interaction and @xmath50 where we designated @xmath51 as the magnetic field perturbation pertaining to a particular wavenumber , i.e. @xmath52 .",
    "we can consider @xmath51 as a function of either @xmath53 or the resonant larmor radius @xmath43 ( see longair 1994 ) .",
    "@xmath51 grows as the instability grows , which in turn reduces @xmath47 . on the other hand ,",
    "it is the mean free path @xmath47 which determines the scale at which compressions of the magnetic field are important .",
    "this can be understood as follows : the cr distribution `` remembers '' the perturbed value of the magnetic field and its anisotropy only during the time the typical particle travels its mean free path .",
    "once particles scatter significantly , the anisotropy of the distribution is effectively `` reset '' . as a result only low amplitude motions on scales less than @xmath47 excite the instability which limits the degree of anisotropy @xmath39 attainable .",
    "the instability grows as @xmath54 where the injection of energy is happening at the scale of the mean free path , i.e. @xmath55 where eqs .",
    "( [ instab_main ] ) and ( [ mean_path ] ) were used .",
    "we see that according to the above equations @xmath51 perturbations will grow as @xmath56 thus reducing @xmath47 virtually to @xmath43 . if not for other processes , it is possible to show that this suppression would reduce @xmath47 to virtually the cr gyroradius , inducing bohm - type diffusion of crs .",
    "however , the collection of waves with different wavelengths created by the instability is also subject to steepening with the rate of @xmath57 , which combined with the effect of limiting @xmath47 above provides : @xmath58 for @xmath59 and @xmath60 eq .  ( [ amplitude ] ) produces a rather shallow spectrum of perturbations , @xmath61 .",
    "the calculations above are valid provided that @xmath47 is larger than the compressive mode cutoff scale @xmath62 . if , on the other hand , @xmath63 the compression for the instability is supplied from the eddies at the damping scale , namely , @xmath64 . in this case instead of",
