    "in a number of physical problems one needs to consider the model in the background of manifolds with boundaries on which the dynamical variables obey some prescribed boundary conditions . in quantum field theory , the imposition of boundary conditions on the field operator gives rise to a number of physical consequences .",
    "the casimir effect is among the most interesting phenomena of this kind ( for reviews see @xcite ) .",
    "it arises due to the modification of the quantum fluctuations of a field by boundary conditions and plays an important role in different fields of physics , from microworld to cosmology .",
    "the boundary conditions in the casimir effect may have different physical natures and can be divided into two main classes . in the first one ,",
    "the constraints are induced by the presence of boundaries , like macroscopic bodies in qed , interfaces separating different phases of a physical system , extended topological defects , horizons in gravitational physics , branes in high - energy theories with extra dimensions and in string theories . in the corresponding models",
    "the field operator obeys the boundary condition on some spacelike surfaces ( static or dynamical ) .",
    "the original problem with two conducting plates , discussed by casimir in 1948 @xcite , belongs to this class . since the original research by casimir",
    ", many theoretical and experimental works have been done on this problem for various types of bulk and boundary geometries .",
    "different methods have been developed including direct mode - summation and the zeta function techniques , semiclassical methods , the optical approach , worldline numerics , the path integral approach , methods based on scattering theory , and numerical methods based on evaluation of the stress tensor via the fluctuation - dissipation theorem .",
    "the recent high precision measurements of the casimir force allow for an accurate comparison between the experimental results and theoretical predictions .    in the second class , the boundary conditions on the field operator",
    "are induced by the nontrivial topology of the space .",
    "the changes in the properties of the vacuum state generated by this type of conditions are referred to as the topological casimir effect .",
    "the importance of this effect is motivated by that the presence of compact dimensions is an inherent feature in many high - energy theories of fundamental physics , in cosmology and in condensed matter physics .",
    "in particular , supergravity and superstring theories are formulated in spacetimes having extra compact dimensions .",
    "the compactified higher - dimensional models provide a possibility for the unification of known interactions . models of a compact universe with nontrivial topology may also play an important role by providing proper initial conditions for inflation in the early stages of the universe expansion @xcite . in condensed matter physics , a number of planar systems in the low - energy sector are described by an effective field theory .",
    "the compactification of these systems leads to the change in the ground state energy which is the analog of the topological casimir effect .",
    "a well - known example of this type of systems is a graphene sheet . in the long wavelength limit",
    ", the dynamics of the quasiparticles for the electronic subsystem is described in terms of the dirac - like theory in two - dimensional space ( see ref .",

    "many authors have investigated the casimir energies and stresses associated with the presence of compact dimensions ( for reviews see refs .",
    "most97,duff86,khan14 ) . in higher - dimensional models",
    "the casimir energy of bulk fields induces an effective potential for the compactification radius .",
    "this has been used as a stabilization mechanism for the corresponding moduli fields and as a source for dynamical compactification of the extra dimensions during the cosmological evolution .",
    "the casimir effect has also been considered as a possible origin for the dark energy in both kaluza - klein - type and braneworld models @xcite .",
    "extra - dimensional theories with low - energy compactification scale predict yukawa - type corrections to newton s gravitational law and the measurements of the casimir forces between macroscopic bodies provide a sensitive test for constraining the parameters of the corresponding long - range interactions @xcite .",
    "the influence of extra compactified dimensions on the casimir effect in the classical configuration of two parallel plates has been recently discussed for scalar @xcite , electromagnetic @xcite and fermionic @xcite fields .",
    "the vast majority of the works on the influence of the copmactification on the properties of the quantum vacuum in the casimir effect has been concerned with global quantities such as the force or the total energy .",
    "more detailed information on the vacuum fluctuations is contained in the local characteristics . among the most important local quantities , because of their close connection with the structure of spacetime , are the vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) of the vacuum energy density and stresses .",
    "for charged fields , another important characteristic is the vev of the current density . due to the global nature of the vacuum",
    ", this vev carries information on both global and local properties of the vacuum state . besides , the vev of the current density appears as a source of the electromagnetic field in semiclassical maxwell equations , and ,",
    "hence , it is needed in modeling a self - consistent dynamics involving the electromagnetic field .    in models with nontrivial topology",
    ", the nonzero current densities in the vacuum state may appear as a consequence of quasiperiodicity conditions along compact dimensions or by the presence of gauge field fluxes enclosed by these dimensions .",
    "note that the gauge field fluxes in higher - dimensional models will also generate a potential for moduli fields and this provides another mechanism for moduli stabilization ( for a review see @xcite ) .",
    "the vev of the fermionic current density in spaces with toroidally compactified dimensions has been considered in @xcite . in the special case of a 2-dimensional space ,",

    "is described and the hadamard function is evaluated in the region between the plates for general robin boundary conditions . by using the expression for the hadamard function , in section [ sec:1plate ] , we evaluate the current density in the geometry of a single plate . the corresponding asymptotics are discussed in various limiting cases and numerical results are presented . in section [ sec:2plates ] the current density is investigated in the region between two plates .",
