    "in mesoscopic transport , wave interference plays an essential role , giving rise to well - known phenomena such as enhanced backscattering , anderson localization and universal conductance fluctuations @xcite .",
    "recently , another striking interference effect has caught much attention , that is , the existence of highly transmitting channels , terms `` open channel '' in a random system @xcite .",
    "these open channels , which enable an optimally prepared coherent input beam to transmit through a strong scattering medium with order unity efficiency , were predicted initially for electrons @xcite .",
    "however , they have not been directly observed in mesoscopic electronics due to the extreme difficulty of controlling the input electron states .",
    "in contrast , it is much easier to prepare the input states of classical waves , such as electromagnetic waves or acoustic waves .",
    "recent developments of adaptive wavefront shaping and phase recording techniques in optics have enabled experimental studies of open channels @xcite .",
    "the open channels greatly enhance light penetration into scattering media , that will have a profound impact in a wide range of applications from biomedical imaging and laser surgery to photovoltaics and energy - efficient ambient lighting @xcite .",
    "+ the transmission channels are eigenvectors of the matrix @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the field transmission matrix of the system .",
    "the eigenvalues @xmath2 are the transmittance of the corresponding eigenchannels . in the lossless diffusion regime ,",
    "the density of eigenvalues @xmath2 has a bimodal distribution , with one peak at @xmath3 that corresponds to closed channels , and a peak at @xmath4 that corresponds to open channels @xcite .",
    "the diffusion process is dominated by the open channels , and the average transmittance is proportional to the ratio of the number of open channels by the total number of propagating channels @xcite . at the transition to localization",
    ", the number of open channels is reduced to one , and the open channels disappear in the localization regime .",
    "the conductance of a localized system is dominated by the single highest transmitting channel . in the past few years",
    ", wavefront shaping has been utilized to increase the coupling of the incident light to the open channels of random media @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations reveal that the open channels enhance the energy stored inside the disordered medium @xcite . in the diffusion regime ,",
    "the field energy of an open channel is spread over the entire transverse extent of a sample , while in the localization regime the maximal transmission channel becomes confined in the transverse direction normal to the transmission direction @xcite . +",
    "in addition to the transmission channels , the transport can also be interpreted in terms of resonances , which are referred to as `` levels '' for electrons and `` modes '' for classical waves @xcite .",
    "for an open system , one can define quasi - normal modes of the maxwell equations .",
    "they describe states that have stationary normalized spatial profiles and amplitudes decaying in time due to radiative losses .",
    "these quasi - normal modes play an important role in transport , e.g. , in the localization regime energy is transported either by tunneling through a localized mode in the middle of the sample or by hopping over a necklace state that is formed via coupling of several localized modes @xcite . if the input beam is coupled to multiple modes , the interference of these modes at the output end determines the total transmission @xcite .",
    "the two approaches to describe transport phenomena , transmission channels and resonant modes , complement each other @xcite . at any frequency , the transmission eigenchannels can be expressed as a frequency - dependent superposition of resonant modes with specific resonance frequencies and widths . in the localization regime , the maximal transmission channel",
    "can typically be identified with a single resonant mode @xcite .",
    "+ absorption of radiation is usually assumed to suppress interference effects such as the occurrence of open channels .",
    "most studies on transmission eigenchannels have considered lossless random media where absorption is negligible . in reality absorption",
    "exists in any material system , and could have a significant impact on diffusion and localization @xcite . in the microwave regime for instance",
    ", absorption is particularly difficult to avoid and leads to a significant reduction of the transmission through disordered waveguides @xcite .",
    "absorption does not destroy the phase coherence of scattered waves , but it attenuates the longer scattering paths more than the shorter paths , thus modifying the interference patterns . since the open channels penetrate deeper into the random medium than the closed channels , they would experience more absorption . in other words , absorption should have a stronger effect on the open channels than on the closed channels .",
    "however , it is not clear how absorption would modify the open channels .",
    "moreover , it has been shown lately that light absorption in strongly scattering media can be greatly enhanced or inhibited by coherent effects @xcite . thus the interplay between absorption and interference determines not only the amount of energy being transmitted , but also the amount of energy being deposited in the random media .",
    "the investigation of strongly scattering systems with absorption is therefore not only important to the fundamental study of mesoscopic transport , but also relevant for applications in imaging , light harvesting , and lighting technology @xcite .",
    "+ in this paper , we address the following questions : how does absorption modify the open channels ?",
    "how does the channel bandwidth vary with absorption ? what is the correlation between a transmission and a reflection channel in the presence of absorption ?",
    "in weak absorption , when the ballistic absorption length @xmath5 is much larger than the average path length @xmath6 ( @xmath7 is the transport mean free path ) , most scattering paths are not affected by absorption . however , when ballistic absorption length becomes smaller than the average path length @xmath8 , attenuation of long scattering paths significantly affects the transport through the system . to study the change of light transport ,",
    "we compute the spatial field distribution inside the random medium .",
    "the spectral width of the maximal transmission channel is important to many of the aforementioned applications , for instance , a broad spectral width is desired for light harvesting . to address this question ,",
    "we calculate the frequency bandwidth of input wavefront corresponding to the maximal transmission channel and its scaling with absorption . experimental studies of the transmission channels rely on the access to both sides of the scattering media .",
    "it is , however , often more convenient and less invasive to work in a reflection configuration , where all measurements are on the input side of the sample .",
    "for example , without absorption , the total transmission is maximized by finding the minimal reflection channel @xcite . in presence of absorption , the relation between the maximal transmission channels and the minimal reflection channels is not known .",
    "therefore , we investigate the correlation between these two channels as a function of absorption .",

    "the localization length is @xmath24 .",
    "the system is in the diffusion regime , as confirmed from the linear decay of intensity but it is close to the localization regime .",
    "the reason we chose this regime is as follows . in the localization regime , the maximal transmission eigenchannel is composed of only one or two quasi - normal modes @xcite . in the diffusion regime ( @xmath25 ) , many overlapping modes contribute to the maximal transmission channel , making the analysis complicated . in our case , the maximal transmission channel consists of a few quasi - normal modes , their interference determines the behavior of the transmission channel .",
    "moreover , in this regime the transport displays a large fluctuation from one realization to another . within the same ensemble we may find realizations that are more localized or more diffusive than the typical sample .",
    "we can therefore study a wide range of conditions in the same ensemble .",
    "+ usually , absorption exists either inside the scattering particles , in the waveguide wall or in the background material that hosts the particles .",
    "the concomitant contrast in the imaginary part of the refractive index causes additional scattering , which modifies the resonant modes @xcite . in this paper",
    "we prefer to avoid this scattering effect by introducing a spatially homogeneous imaginary refractive index @xmath26 to both scatterers and background , so that mode wavefunctions do not change and we can focus on the effects of absorption and energy loss .",

    "a noticeable change of the field pattern is observed : the loops gradually disappear , and the creeks become straighter .",
    "this behavior occurs because the longer scattering paths that involve more windings are strongly attenuated by absorption . to maximize the transmission through the random system",
    ", light takes a shorter and more straight path to minimize absorption . as a result ,",
    "the distribution of poynting vector s angle @xmath65 becomes narrow and its variance decreases .",
    "when absorption becomes very strong ( @xmath67 ) , the maximal transmission channel bears no resemblance to the one with weak absorption .",
    "all meandering creeks eventually merge into a single stream with few windings and light propagates mostly in the forward direction .",
    "we conclude that in the presence of strong absorption , diffusive transport has been turned into a ballistic - like transport , even in a thick mesoscopic sample with a length close to the localization length .",

    "this means that interference remains strong , and absorption merely reduces the amount of energy reaching the output end , but does not change the interference pattern .",

    "when the minimal reflectance has a maximum at @xmath116 , the field pattern of the minimal reflection channel shown in fig .",
    "[ figure_7](c ) , resembles that of mode 2 in the left half of the waveguide . at this strong absorption level ,",
    "the contribution of mode 1 to the minimal reflection channel is negligible , whereas mode 2 becomes dominant , which is a mode with a larger overlap with the input light into the disordered waveguide .",
    "therefore , the interference in the bulk of the sample - that is the cause of open transmission channels - is suppressed , which leads to an increased reflectance .",
    "+ let us now consider the input wavefront @xmath114 , which corresponds to the minimal reflection channel ( or maximal transmission channel ) without absorption .",
    "@xmath114 couples most of the input energy into mode 1 .",
    "figure [ figure_7](g ) shows the reflectance associated with input wavefront @xmath114 as a function of absorption @xmath49 . when absorption becomes significant ( @xmath76 ) , the reflectance increases rapidly , up to @xmath122 times its value at @xmath123 .",
    "another input wavefront @xmath115 , corresponding to the minimal reflection channel at @xmath116 , couples most of the energy into mode 2 . in fig .",
    "[ figure_7](g ) , we show the evolution of the reflection value associated to this wavefront with absorption .",
    "as expected , the reflectance decreases with increasing absorption .",
    "once the reflectance with input wavefront @xmath115 becomes lower than that associated with @xmath114 , mode 2 becomes dominant in the minimal reflection channel .",
    "this illustrates that with increasing absorption , the mechanism that produces the minimal reflection channel changes from transmission to bulk absorption .",
    "moreover , it shows the significant role played by interference of scattered waves up to the point where the absorption becomes dominant .",
    "we have performed a detailed numerical study to understand how absorption modifies transport in a 2d disordered waveguide , with emphasis on the maximum transmission channel .",
    "the maximal transmission channel is relatively robust against absorption compared to the transmittance .",
    "its input wavefront remains nearly unchanged up to @xmath124 , but changes rapidly beyond that point . in the maximal transmission channel , light propagates through the random structure along winding paths when absorption is weak ( @xmath75 ) , and takes more straight routes once absorption is significant ( @xmath76 ) .",
    "we investigate the correlations between the quasi - normal modes and the maximal transmission channel to illustrate the mechanism of enhanced transmission in both weak and strong absorption regimes .",
    "maximal transmission is facilitated by hopping through localized modes when absorption is weak , and is dominated by more extended modes when absorption is strong .",
    "we observe distinct scaling behavior for the spectral width of maximal transmission channel in different random configurations .",
    "such differences result from the absorption - induced change in the number of quasimodes that participate in the maximal transmission channel .",
    "the channel spectral width increases linearly with absorption , if the mode participation number @xmath90 remains almost constant ; the width increases sublinearly if @xmath90 decreases , and superlinearly if @xmath90 increases . in the absence of absorption",
    ", minimal reflection corresponds to maximal transmission , but this correspondence no longer holds in the regime of strong absorption ( @xmath76 ) , where minimal reflection corresponds to enhanced absorption . in some instances , we have observed the surprising feature that the minimal reflection eigenvalue increases with absorption , which can be explained by the reduction of destructive interference . the numerical study presented here provides a physical understanding of the effects of absorption on transmission and reflection eigenchannels at the relevant mesoscopic scale , which will hopefully serve in the interpretation of experimental work , and in the design of practical applications .",
    "we want to thank douglas stone , arthur goetschy , alexey yamilov for stimulating discussions and ad lagendijk for encouragements .",
    "the numerical study is supported in part by the facilities and staff of the yale university faculty of arts and sciences high performance computing center .",
