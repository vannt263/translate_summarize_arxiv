    "electromagnetic wave propagation is a very important physical phenomenon in classical field theory . in general , the geometrical structure of spacetime as well as the intrinsic properties and the motion of material media can affect the light propagation . in the generally covariant pre - metric approach to electrodynamics@xcite , the axioms of electric charge and of magnetic flux conservation manifest themselves in the maxwell equations for the excitation @xmath0 and the field strength @xmath1 : @xmath4 these equations should be supplemented by a constitutive law @xmath5 .",
    "the latter relation contains the crucial information about the underlying physical continuum ( i.e. , spacetime and/or material medium ) .",
    "mathematically , this constitutive law arises either from a suitable phenomenological theory of a medium or from the electromagnetic field lagrangian .",
    "it can be a nonlinear or even nonlocal relation between the electromagnetic excitation and the field strength .",
    "earlier , we have investigated the propagation of waves in the most general linear theory . here",
    "we present some results which hold true for all electrodynamical models with an arbitrary local spacetime relation .",
    "this is how we call the constitutive law if it applies to spacetime ( `` the vacuum '' ) itself .",
    "if local coordinates @xmath6 are given , with @xmath7 , we can decompose the excitation and field strength 2-forms into their components according to @xmath8",
    "we will study the propagation of a discontinuity of the electromagnetic field following the lines of ref .",
    "@xcite , see also refs .",
    "the surface of discontinuity @xmath9 is defined locally by a function @xmath10 such that @xmath11 on @xmath9 . across @xmath9 ,",
    "the geometric hadamard conditions are satisfied : @xmath12 = 0,\\qquad [ \\partial_i f_{jk } ] = q_i\\ , f_{jk } ,   \\label{had1}\\\\ & & [ h_{ij } ] = 0,\\qquad [ \\partial_i h_{jk } ] = q_i\\ , h_{jk}.   \\label{had2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath13(x)$ ] denotes the discontinuity of a function @xmath14 across @xmath9 , and @xmath15 is the wave covector .",
    "since the spacetime relation @xmath16 determines the excitation in terms of the field strength , the corresponding tensors @xmath17 and @xmath18 , describing the jumps of the derivatives of field strength and excitation , are related by @xmath19 in linear electrodynamics , the components of the constitutive tensor @xmath20 are constant ( or , at least , independent of the electromagnetic field ) .",
    "but in general @xmath20 is a function of the electromagnetic field , the velocity of matter , the temperature , and other physical and geometrical variables .",
    "quite remarkably , however , all the earlier results obtained for linear electrodynamics remain also valid in the general case because whatever nonlinear spacetime relation @xmath16 may exist , the relation between the _ jumps _ of the field derivatives , according to ( [ kappa ] ) , is always linear .",
    "if we use maxwell s equations ( [ me ] ) , then ( [ had1 ] ) and ( [ had2 ] ) yield @xmath21 introducing the conventional constitutive matrix @xmath22 and making use of ( [ kappa ] ) , we rewrite the above system as @xmath23 solving the last equation by @xmath24 , we finally reduce ( [ 4dwave1])@xmath25 to @xmath26 this algebraic system has a nontrivial solution for @xmath27 only when the determinant of the matrix on the l.h.s . vanishes .",
    "the latter gives rise to our _ covariant fresnel equation _",
    "@xmath28 with the fourth order fresnel tensor density of weight @xmath29 defined by @xmath30 it is totally symmetric , @xmath31 , and thus has 35 independent components .",
    "the quantity @xmath20 or , equivalently , @xmath32 , characterizes the electromagnetic properties of the vacuum and is as such of universal importance .",
    "the untwisted tensor density @xmath32 of weight @xmath29 has 36 independent components . if we decompose it into irreducible pieces with respect to the 6-dimensional linear group , then we find @xmath33 independent components , respectively .",
    "the irreducible pieces of @xmath34 are defined as follows : @xmath35}\\ , , \\nonumber\\\\{}^{(1 ) }    \\chi^{ijkl}&:= & \\chi^{ijkl } -\\",
    ",    { } ^{(2)}\\chi^{ijkl}-\\,{}^{(3)}\\chi^{ijkl}={}^{(1 ) } \\chi^{klij}\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since no metric is available , we can not form traces .",
    "the abelian axion piece @xmath36 @xmath37 has been introduced by ni @xcite . a constitutive law ( for matter ) with @xmath38 ( non - vanishing `` skewon field '' ) has been discussed by nieves and pal@xcite .",
    "it yields p- and cp - violating terms in the field equations .",
    "thus all constitutive functions in ( [ decomp ] ) can claim respectability from a physical point of view in the framework of linear response theory .",

    "the various irreducible pieces of the constitutive tensor affect the wave propagation in different ways .",
    "technically , this can be determined by studying how a certain irreducible piece @xmath45 contributes to the fresnel tensor density ( [ g4 ] ) and , thereby , to the fresnel equation ( [ fresnel ] ) which governs the wave covectors",
    ".    we will demonstrate here the general properties of the fresnel tensor density . as a preparatory step ,",
    "let us take @xmath46 . then , using a compact notation by omitting the indices , we have quite generally @xmath47 here the mixed terms @xmath48 contain one @xmath49-factor and the @xmath50 s two @xmath49-factors .",

    "similarly , we find @xmath66 and @xmath67 both expressions vanish when we impose symmetrization over @xmath51 .",
    "the proof that all @xmath68 s are equal to zero reduces to the above formulas in which we simply need to replace one of the @xmath69 factors by the levi - civita @xmath70 .",

    "the properties of the fresnel tensor simplify greatly the final analysis of the light propagation in the general electrodynamical theory .",
    "as we saw , neither the axion piece @xmath78 nor the skewon piece @xmath79 ( alone or together ) can provide electromagnetic wave propagation .",
    "the presence of the _ principal part _ @xmath80 of the constitutive tensor is indispensable for the existence of nontrivial electromagnetic waves and ultimately for the existence of the light cone structure on spacetime . in any case",
    ", the fresnel tensor density reads @xmath81 furthermore , in general @xmath82 which means that the skewon field _",
    "does _ influence the fresnel equation and thus , eventually , the light cone structure .",
    "an example of this general result can be found in the asymmetric constitutive tensor studied by nieves and pal @xcite .",
    "actually , we can use ( [ over1 ] ) to find more exactly the contribution of the skewon to the fresnel tensor .",
    "one can straightforwardly see that @xmath83 the proof is analogous to the demonstration of the property @xmath60 and is based directly on the skew symmetry @xmath84 . as a result , ( [ over1 ] ) yields @xmath85.\\nonumber\\ ] ] substituting here the explicit form of the skewon part ( [ skewon ] ) , we finally find @xmath86    our basic results on the light propagation are then that @xmath87 , otherwise there is no orderly wave propagation , the axion piece @xmath88 is left arbitrary , it does nt influence light propagation locally , whereas the skewon piece @xmath89 makes itself felt by means of equation ( [ propg8 ] ) .",
    "the detailed study of how exactly these 15 functions @xmath90 affect the light cone is left for future work .",
