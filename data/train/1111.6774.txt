    "perhaps the most traditional technique to identify accretion - powered activity in galactic nuclei relies on identifying sources with an ultraviolet excess , i.e. sources whose spectral energy distribution ( sed ) does not steeply decline on the blue side of the stellar spectrum peak ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "albeit successful , this method fails to detect both obscured and high - redshift agn ( active galactic nuclei ) , which disappear from the uv due to absorption from local dust and the lyman forests , respectively .",
    "this shortcoming is not negligible , since the presence of a large population of heavily obscured agn seems required by the hard spectrum of the x - ray background @xcite .",
    "more generally , optical , uv , and x - ray observations , which are traditionally employed to detect unobscured agn activity , are still known to miss a large fraction of the obscured agn population , and nearly all of the compton - thick agn which are thought to dominate agn number counts at high redshifts @xcite .",
    "the obscuring dust that hides agn from ultraviolet , optical , and soft x - ray surveys should be a strong , largely isotropic emitter in the mid - to - far - infrared .",
    "inactive galaxies and agn have different seds at short infrared wavelengths : while the composite blackbody spectra of the stellar population of normal galaxies produce an sed that peaks at approximately 1.6@xmath0 m ( in f@xmath3 ) , agn have roughly power - law shaped seds .",
    "searching for agn at these wavelengths suffers very modestly from extinction by dust or gas , as demonstrated for example by studies based on the two micron all - sky survey  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "more recently , observations taken with the multiband imaging photometer ( mips ; @xcite ) and infrared array camera ( irac ; @xcite ) aboard _ spitzer _ have been successfully employed to select agn candidates independently of their optical and/or x - ray properties . in addition",
    ", they have proven capable of identifying heavily obscured agn that are missed even in the deepest x - ray fields , making ir selection a viable alternative to traditional agn selection methods ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    ", @xcite found that the fraction of mir sources dominated by an agn decreases with decreasing flux density , but only down to a 24 @xmath0 m flux density of about 300 @xmath0jy . below this limit , the agn fraction levels out at  10% , indicating that a substantial fraction of faint 24 @xmath0 m sources are primarily powered by mechanisms other than star formation .",
    "furthermore , the majority of agn with low 24 @xmath0 m flux densities are missed by x - ray surveys , suggesting that x - ray emission alone can not be used to unambiguously pinpoint agn activity .    unfortunately , direct measurements of mir eddington ratios are mostly limited to samples of known agn  here loosely defined as emitting above a few per cent of their eddington luminosity . at fainter levels of nuclear luminosity , disentangling accreation powered and star formation powered mir emission becomes a challenge .",
    "while contamination can be reduced by focusing on quiescent ( in terms of their star formation ) early - type galaxies , pushing the threshold to the lowest accretion rates / luminosities  that is , below a few thousandths of the eddington limit in terms of nuclear , accretion - powered activity  necessarily means facing additional sources of contamination .",

    "upper limits for the non - detected sources are given in table[tab_all ] .",

    "one of the goals of this project is to detect possible nuclear mir emission which may point towards obscured low - level agn activity .",
    "however , in such a scenario , diffuse dust in the host galaxy becomes a significant source of contamination . in order to isolate any faint excess of nuclear dust emission ,",
    "we must first account for possible diffuse dust emission originating from the host galaxy itself .",
    "some galaxies in our sample have extended ( kpc - scale ) dust features clearly detectable from the optical images ( hereafter often called  optical dust ",
    "the spatial resolution of _ spitzer _ is not sufficient to resolve mir emission from this dust in most of our objects . in such cases",
    "we can not disentangle how much of the unresolved mir flux comes from diffuse dusty structures or from a putative nuclear source .",
    "therefore we exclude any objects with optically detected dust in the host galaxy from further analysis . for reference , there are 18 objects with optically detected dust in our sample and we detect most of them at 24@xmath0 m , with the exception of vcc1422 and vcc1779 .",

    "it has been shown that for early - type galaxies the total luminosity at 24@xmath0 m correlates well with the optical luminosity ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "radial light profiles were created using the task ellipse within iraf .",
    "the central question is whether these galaxies require an additional nuclear component to explain their mir light profiles or if the observed mir emission is in accordance with emission from the host galaxy ( stellar light and dust emission associated directly with the stellar population ) .    in order to use the optical light profiles as a proxy for the mir emission expected from the stellar populations",
    ", we also created radial profiles from the re - reduced acs @xmath11-band images , which we convolved with an observed mips psf , after aligning them to the mips images to acs - pixel accuracy . because only few mir maps included a sufficiently bright star to serve as a mips psf for our analysis , we chose to create an average psf from twelve individual stars on our maps which were reasonably bright , not close to the edges of the maps , and also fairly isolated .",
    "the radial surface brightness profile for the mir psf was derived in the same manner as for the acs and mips images .",
    "the observed mir surface brightness profiles were then fitted as the linear combination of the radial profile of the mir - psf convolved optical images ( i.e. stellar host galaxy contributions ) and the radial profile of the average mir psf ( i.e. a possible nuclear excess of unresolved dust ) .",
    "we show the radial profile fits in fig.[images_radprof ] . in most objects",
    "an additional psf component is required to match the optical light profile with the mir light profile .",
    "this nuclear mir excess can be small ( e.g. vcc1537 ) , of medium strength ( e.g. vcc0731 ) , or quite substantial ( e.g. vcc2092 ) .",
    "we will discuss the likely origin of this nuclear excess emission in section[sec : results ] .      as a second step in our analysis we modeled the observed mir images using galfit @xcite . as we have seen in the previous section ,",
    "a two component model is well suited to describe the mir radial profiles of the early - type galaxies in our sample .",
    "therefore we chose to fit the two - dimensional images also with two components : one component representing the host contributions , plus a psf component representing a possible nucleus .",
    "as tracers for the host galaxy light distribution we again used the _ hst _ @xmath11-band images , which have been modeled previously by @xcite .",
    "we fixed the shape parameters ( e.g. effective radius , sersic index , axis ratio , orientation ) describing the host component to those determined by @xcite , leaving the absolute scaling and centroid as the only free parameters .",
    "for the psf component we provided the same average psf used in section [ sec : radprof ] .",
    "for the vast majority of objects this two - component model provided a very good description of the mir images . in a few individual cases we added an additional psf to account for nearby stars . in the cases of vcc1125 and",
    "vcc2095 an additional disk component was needed to achive a satisfactory model of the galaxy .",
    "the model for vcc1938 was more complex and required a second sersic profile and an additional ( off nuclear ) psf .",
    "the mips 24@xmath0 m images and the residuals after subtracting the best fit model for all 37 sources for which the fitting was performed are presented in fig.[images_galfit ] .",
    "the significance of psf components in the individual objects was tested using similar techniques as described earlier for the aperture photometry : we placed 1000 random apertures in the residual images ( i.e. after subtraction of the best - fit model ) and fitted the resulting distribution of flux values with a gaussian .",
    "the value of three times the sigma of this gaussian ( including an aperture correction ) was converted into an ab magnitude limit for the psf component . for six sources",
    "the fitted psf component was fainter than the 3@xmath8 magnitude limit for the respective image and , thus , the limiting magnitude was taken as the bright limit for the psf component in these cases . for the remaining 31 objects the nuclear psf component is significant at a @xmath15@xmath16 level .",
    "the additional nuclear psf required to fit the 24@xmath0 m radial profiles and images could be due to processes like star formation or low - luminosity agn activity . however",
    ", radial variations in the age and/or metallicity of the stellar population can also result in a modified optical / mir light ratio towards the center of the galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) . since our method assumes that the stellar host component has a fixed @xmath11/24@xmath0 m ratio throughout the galaxy , part of the nuclear psf component could in fact be due to a variation in the central properties of the stellar populations . in the following",
    "we will discuss such effects .",
    "one possible process to boost the mir emission in the core would be residual star formation .",
    "in fact , the uv / optical colors of @xmath17 early - type galaxies indicate that 10 - 30% of them have experienced recent star formation with 1 - 3% of the stellar mass having ages @xmath181 - 2gyr ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the single stellar population ( ssp ) models of e.g. @xcite and  @xcite , which include the effects of dust from agb stars , predict a strong decline of the mir emission with the age of the stellar populations . a younger stellar population in the centers of the galaxies",
    "would then translate into increased mir emission .",

    "<S> we complete our census of low - level nuclear activity in virgo cluster early - type galaxies by searching for obscured emission using _ spitzer _ space telescope mid - infrared ( mir ) imaging at 24@xmath0 m . </S>",
    "<S> of a total sample of 95 early - type galaxies , 53 objects are detected , including 16 showing kiloparsec - scale dust in optical images . </S>",

    "<S> no such modeling was performed for the sources with dust detected in the optical images . </S>",
    "<S> we explore several possible sources of the mir excess emission , including obscured nuclear emission . </S>",
    "<S> we find that radial metallicity gradients in the stellar population appear to be a natural and most likely explanation for the observed behavior in a majority of the sources . alternatively , </S>",
    "<S> if the concentrated mir emission were due to nuclear activity , it would imply a mir - to - x luminosity ratio @xmath1@xmath2 for the low luminosity agn detected in x - rays by our survey . </S>",
    "<S> this ratio is an order of magnitude larger than that of typical low - luminosity agn and would imply an unusual spectral energy distribution . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that the black holes found by our survey in quiescent early - type galaxies in virgo have low bolometric eddington ratios arising from low accretion rates and/or highly radiatively inefficient accretion . </S>"
