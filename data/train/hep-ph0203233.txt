    "the discovery of neutrino masses requires an extension of the standard model ( sm ) or the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , which may involve right - handed neutrinos , or more generally gauge singlets .",
    "since there are no protective symmetries , these singlets are usually expected to have huge explicit ( majorana ) masses .",
    "this leads to the see - saw mechanism @xcite , which provides a convincing explanation for small neutrino masses . this scenario can be realized in many grand unified theories ( gut s ) and their supersymmetric counterparts .",
    "for instance , left - right symmetric models and @xmath0 gut s include singlet neutrinos , which can get huge masses in several ways , e.g.  by a higgs in a suitable representation or radiatively . furthermore , additional singlets may exist , which can also be involved in the see - saw mechanism .",
    "it is often assumed that all heavy singlet mass eigenvalues are degenerate .",
    "however , in all the models a large hierarchy of the singlet masses is possible .",
    "note that such a hierarchical spectrum may even show up if all elements of the singlet mass matrix are of the same order .",
    "democratic mass matrices , where this is the case due to discrete symmetries , are an example .",
    "another argument for a non - degenerate spectrum follows from assuming a neutrino yukawa matrix @xmath1 which is proportional to the diagonalized charged lepton yukawa matrix @xmath2 , i.e.  the relation @xmath3 holds with a constant real number @xmath4 . if the neutrino masses are degenerate and of the order @xmath5 , the see - saw relation @xmath6 for the neutrino mass matrix @xmath7 allows to determine the singlet mass matrix @xmath8 .",
    "mixings do not significantly alter this picture , since e.g.  bimaximal mixing can be accomplished by small modifications of a degenerate @xmath7 of the order @xmath9 or @xmath10 , respectively .",
    "taking for example @xmath11 , the mass eigenvalues of @xmath8 are of the order @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 for the case at hand .",
    "it is therefore conceivable that there may be an even larger hierarchy in @xmath8 than in the charged lepton yukawa matrices .",
    "altogether , there are thus good reasons to study the effects of a non - degenerate or even hierarchical singlet mass spectrum .    in this paper",
    ", we calculate the renormalization group equations ( rge s ) for the evolution of the neutrino mass matrix from the gut scale to the electroweak or susy breaking scale .",
    "we consider the case where the sm and the mssm are extended by an arbitrary number of heavy singlets which have explicit ( majorana ) masses with a non - degenerate spectrum .",
    "hence , to study the rg evolution of neutrino masses several effective field theories ( eft s ) , with the singlets partly integrated out , have to be taken into account . below the lowest mass threshold , the neutrino mass matrix is given by the effective dimension 5 neutrino mass operator in the sm or mssm , respectively .",
    "the corresponding rge s were derived in @xcite .",
    "consider the sm or the mssm with @xmath15 additional sterile neutrinos .",
    "the eigenvalues of the mass matrix @xmath8 , i.e.  the masses of the mass eigenstates @xmath16 , have a certain spectrum , @xmath17 .",

    "before we calculate the rge s in the various theories , let us specify the modifications in the lagrangians due to the appearance of the heavy neutrinos . in the sm above the highest mass threshold ( `` full theory '' in figure [ fig : eftranges ] ) , the kinetic and mass term as well as the yukawa interaction for the singlet neutrinos @xmath19 , @xmath20 ,",
