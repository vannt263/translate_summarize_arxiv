    "studies of correlations arising from electron - electron interactions remain a central theme in condensed matter physis @xcite to better understand challenging phenomena such as high - tc superconductivity @xcite or colossal magnetic resistance .",
    "@xcite there is a need for better theoretical models that can account for relevant correlations in ground and excites states of fermionic systems with as much simplicity as possible . within this context",
    ", the repulsive hubbard hamiltonian @xcite has received a lot of attention since it is considered the generic model of strongly correlated electron systems .",
    "@xcite hubbard - like models have also received renewed attention in the study of cold fermionic atoms in optical lattices @xcite and the electronic properties of graphene .",
    "@xcite    unlike the one - dimensional ( 1d ) hubbard model , which is exactly solvable @xcite using the bethe ansatz , @xcite an exact solution of the two - dimensional ( 2d ) problem is not known .",
    "therefore , it is highly desirable to develop approximations that , on the one hand , can capture the main features of the exact 1d bethe solution and , on the other hand , can be extended to higher dimensions . for small lattices",
    ", one can resort to exact diagonalization using the lanczos method .",
    "@xcite for larger systems , several other methods have been extensively used to study the 1d and 2d hubbard models as well as their strong coupling versions .",
    "@xcite among such approximations , we have the quantum monte carlo , @xcite the variational monte carlo , @xcite the density matrix renormalization group @xcite as well as approximations based on matrix product and tensor network states . @xcite both the dynamical mean field theory and its cluster extensions @xcite have made important contributions to our present knowledge of the hubbard model .",
    "other embedding approaches are also available .",
    "@xcite finally , we refer the reader to the recent state - of - the - art applications of the coupled cluster method to frustrated hubbard - like models .",
    "@xcite    although routinely used in nuclear structure physics , especially within the generator coordinate method , @xcite symmetry restoration via projection techniques @xcite has received little attention in condensed matter physics .",
    "nevertheless , these techniques offer an alternative for obtaining accurate correlated wave functions that respect the symmetries of the considered many - fermion problem .",
    "the key idea is,@xcite on the one hand , to consider a mean - field trial state @xmath2 which deliberately breaks several symmetries of the original hamiltonian . on the other hand , the goldstone manifold @xmath3 , where @xmath4 represents a symmetry operation , is degenerate and the superposition of such goldstone states",
    ", @xcite can be used to recover the desired symmetry by means of a self - consistent variation - after - projection procedure .",
    "@xcite such a single - reference ( sr ) scheme provides the optimal ritz - variational@xcite representation of a given state by means of only one symmetry - projected mean - field configuration .",
    "this kind of sr variation - after - projection scheme , has already been applied to the 1d and 2d hubbard models @xcite as well as in quantum chemistry within the framework of the projected quasiparticle theory .",
    "@xcite    one of the main advantages of the symmetry - projected approximations @xcite is that they offer compact wave functions as well as a systematic way to improve their quality by adopting a multi - reference ( mr ) approach . in this case ,",
    "a set of symmetry - broken mean - field states @xmath5 is used to build goldstone manifolds @xmath6 whose superposition can be used to recover the desired symmetries of the hamiltonian . @xcite the key idea is then to expand a given state in terms of several symmetry - projected and variationally determined mean - field configurations .",
    "the resulting wave functions encode more correlations than the ones obtained within sr methods while still keeping well defined symmetry quantum numbers .",
    "@xcite    there are differents flavors of mr approximations available in the literature.@xcite in the present study , we adopt a mr scheme well known in nuclear structure physics , @xcite which to the best of our knowledge has not been applied to lattice models . the key ingredient in such mr scheme",
    "is the inclusion of relevant correlations in both ground and excited states on an equal footing . as a benchmark test",
    ", we concentrate on the 1d hubbard model for which exact solutions are known .",
    "@xcite in particular , we consider the case of half - filled lattices .",
    "nevertheless , the present mr approximation can be extended to the 2d case as well as to doped systems with arbitrary on - site interaction strengths .    for a given single - electron space",
    "we resort to generalized hf - transformations @xcite ( ghf ) mixing all quantum numbers of the single - electron basis states .",
    "the corresponding slater determinants deliberately break spin and spatial symmetries of the 1d hubbard hamiltonian .",
    "@xcite we restore these broken symmetries with the help of projection operators .",
    "@xcite the resulting mr ground state wave functions are obtained applying the variational principle to the projected energy .",
    "the structure of our mr ground state wave functions is formally similar to the one adopted within the resonating hf @xcite ( reshf ) method , i.e. , they are expanded in terms of a given number of non - orthogonal symmetry - projected configurations .",
    "nevertheless , while in the latter all the underlying hf - transformations and mixing coefficients are optimized simultaneously , @xcite in our case the orbital optimization is performed sequentially , only for the last added hf - transformation ( all our mixing coefficients are still optimized at the same time ) rendering our calculations easier to handle .",
    "this is particularly relevant for alleviating our numerical effort if one keeps in mind that , for both ground and excited states , we use the most general ghf - transformations and therefore a full 3d spin projection is required .",
    "our mr scheme is also used to compute spin - spin correlation functions ( sscfs ) in real space , magnetic structure factors ( msfs ) as well as dynamical properties of the 1d hubbard model like spectral functions ( sfs ) and density of states ( dos ) .",
    "dagotto - review , rayner-2d - hubbard - prb-2012,carlos - hubbard-1d , fetter - w on the other hand , one may wonder whether there is any relevant information in the intrinsic symmetry - broken ghf - determinants associated with our mr wave functions .",
    "as will be shown below , the structure of such intrinsic determinants can be interpreted in terms of basic units of quantum fluctuations for the lattices considered.@xcite    in addition to ground state properties , our mr framework treats excited states with well defined quantum numbers as expansions in terms of non - orthogonal symmetry - projected configurations using chains of variation - after - projection ( vap ) calculations . as a byproduct , we also obtain a ( truncated ) basis consisting of a few gram - schmidt orthonormalized states , @xcite which may be used to perform a final diagonalization of the hamiltonian in order to account for further correlations in both ground and excited states .    the layout of the theory part of this paper is as follows .",
    "first , we introduce the methodology of our mr vap scheme in sec.[theory ] .",
    "symmetry restoration based on a single slater determinant ( i.e. , sr symmetry restoration ) is described in sec.[hubbard1dhamiltonian ] .",
    "this section will serve to set our notation as well as to introduce some key elements of our 3d spin and full space group projection techniques .",
    "subsequently , symmetry restoration based on several slater determinants ( i.e. , mr symmetry restoration ) is discussed in sec.[symmetry - multiref ] . in particular , the mr description of ground and excited states is presented in secs.[symmetry - multiref - gs ] and [ symmetry - multiref - excited ] , respectively . in sec.[sfplusdos ] , we will briefly discuss the computation of the sfs and dos within our theoretical framework .",
    "the results presented in this paper test the performance of our approximation in a selected set of illustrative examples . in most cases , calculations have been carried out for on - site repulsions @xmath7 and @xmath8 taken as representatives of weak , intermediate - to - strong , and strong correlation regimes . in sec.[results ] , we first consider the ground states of half - filled lattices with up to 50 sites . we compare our ground state and correlation energies with the exact ones as well as with those obtained using other theoretical methods .",
    "we then discuss the dependence of the predicted correlation energies on the number of non - orthogonal symmetry - projected configurations used to expand our ground state wave functions , the computational performance of our scheme as well as the structure of the intrinsic ghf - determinants resulting from our mr vap procedure .",
    "next , we consider the results of our calculations for sscfs in real space and msfs for half - filled lattices with up to 30 sites .",
    "these results are compared with density matrix renormalization group @xcite ( dmrg ) ones obtained with the open source alps software.@xcite this comparison is very valuable as dmrg represents one of the most accurate approximations in the 1d case .",
    "subsequently , we compare the dos provided by our theoretical framework with the exact one , obtained with an in - house diagonalization code , in a lattice with 10 sites . results for hole sfs are also discussed for a 30-site lattice .",
    "we end sec.[results ] by presenting results for excitation spectra in various lattices and discussing the structure of the intrinsic ghf - determinants resulting from our mr vap procedure for excited states .",
    "finally , sec.[conclusions ] is devoted to concluding remarks and work perspectives .",

    "we conclude that the ghf - fed approximation can be considered a reasonable starting point for building correlated ground state wave functions which , at the same time , respect the original symmetries of the 1d hubbard hamiltonian .",
    "this is further corroborated from the results , shown in table ii , for @xmath60 .",
    "in particular , even when our description of the ground state in this lattice is poorer than in the @xmath209 case since we have kept the same number of ghf - transformations , it is remarkable that we obtain ( with 125,048 variational parameters ) the values @xmath210 and @xmath211 , respectively .",
    "for the same on - site repulsions the variational monte carlo method @xcite predicts @xmath175 values of around @xmath212 and @xmath213 .",

    "they increase smoothly with the number of non - orthogonal symmetry - projected configurations used to expand the wave function . from fig.[energy_vs_trans ]",
    ", it is apparent ( see also tables i and ii ) that with increasing lattice size , we need a larger number @xmath108 of symmetry - projected configurations to keep and/or improve the quality of the ghf - fed wave functions . for example , comparing the @xmath40 and @xmath41 lattices , we see that in the former @xmath11 transformations are enough to obtain @xmath215 while in the latter @xmath216 . on the other hand ,",

    "in fact , both ours and the reshf @xcite wave functions are nothing else than a discretized form of the exact coherent - state representation of a fermion state @xcite and , therefore , become exact in the limit @xmath219 .",
    "our aim in the present work is not to lower the ground state energy as much as possible but to test to which extent our scheme can account for relevant correlations in the considered lattices .",
    "therefore , for the largest lattices here studied ( i.e. , @xmath36 and @xmath189 ) , we have restricted ourselves in practice to a maximun number @xmath199 of ghf - transformations .",

    "results are shown for @xmath60 and @xmath181 but similar behavior was also obtained for @xmath153 and @xmath8 . as demonstrated in the plot , the ghf - fed speedup grows linearly with the number of processors used in the calculations .",
    "on the other hand , panel ( b ) of the same figure shows that ( for a fixed number of proccessors ) an efficient implementation of our variational scheme scales linearly with the number @xmath108 of ghf - transformations used while the reshf scaling is quadratic . concerning the scaling of our method with system size ,",
    "fig.[energy_vs_trans ] shows that as the system becomes larger a larger number of transformations is required to keep the quality of our wave functions .",
    "we can not currently determine how the number of transformations scales with system size as this would require to consider larger lattices than the ones studied in this paper .",
    "an interesting issue is whether there is any relevant information in the symmetry - broken ( i.e. , intrinsic ) determinants @xmath127 resulting from the ghf - fed vap optimization .",
    "we are interested in comparing the structure of these determinants with the spin - density wave solution obtained with the standard uhf approximation . here",

    "a very different behavior appears in the intrinsic ghf - determinants @xmath127 associated with the ghf - fed solution .",
    "first , we observe a broad spin feature distributed all over the lattice , which is a consequence of the richer spin textures provided by the use of ghf - transformations and full 3d spin projection .",
    "in addition , pairs of points ( black squares ) appear where @xmath224 changes its sign ( i.e. , the spin - density wave reverses it phase ) .",
    "these defects of the spin - density wave phase represent soliton - antisoliton ( @xmath225 ) pairs in the case of half - filled lattices .",
    "@xcite in particular , our analysis of the charge densities @xmath226 reveal that they correspond to neutral @xmath227 pairs .",
    "let us stress that the presence of at least one @xmath227 pair is a genuine vap effect appearing even if we approximate a given ground state within a sr framework , @xcite as discussed in sec.[hubbard1dhamiltonian ] .",
    "furthermore , fig.[solitonsu2 ] illustrates how the @xmath227 pairs appear at different lattice locations @xmath228 with varying distance @xmath229 among the members of the pairs .",
    "the latter represents the breathing motion of the @xmath227 pairs .",
    "the @xmath227 pairs are present in all the intrinsic determinants @xmath127 associated with the ghf - fed expansion , which as already mentioned above , superposes the goldstone manifolds @xmath230 containing defects in the spin - density wave .",
    "we are then left with an intuitive physical picture in which the soliton pairs can be regarded as basic units of quantum fluctuations in our ghf - fed states . on the other hand , the interference between @xmath227 pairs belonging to different symmetry - broken determinants @xmath127 is accounted for in our calculations through a resonon - like equation similar to eq.([hw-1 ] ) .",
    "this interpretation has been suggested in previous studies with the reshf method .",
    "@xcite      let us now consider the ground state spin - spin correlation functions ( sscfs ) in real space .",
    "for a given set of symmetry quantum numbers @xmath33 , they can be computed as    @xmath231    note that if a wave function has good spin , as it is the case with the ghf - fed one , the sscfs have to be the same for all the members of a ( 2s+1)-multiplet and , therefore , they can not depend on the @xmath232 quantum number .",
    "however , a dependence with respect to the particular row @xmath106 of the space group irreducible representation that we are using in the projection still remains and is explicitly included in @xmath233 .",
    "the sscfs corresponding to the ground states for @xmath234 and @xmath41 , approximated by @xmath235 and @xmath236 ghf - transformations , respectively , are depicted in panels ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) of fig.[ss - n30-ne30 ] . in the same figure , we have also plotted the values resulting from our dmrg calculations . we observe a good agreement between the ghf - fed and dmrg sscfs with slight deviations for the @xmath36 lattice at u=8 t , which can be improved by increasing the number of transformations . in particular , both sscfs display a rapid decrease for @xmath237 .",
    "a similar feature has been studied in previous works .",
    "@xcite regardless of the on - site interaction , the short range part of the sscfs runs parallel for the lattices considered in fig.[ss - n30-ne30 ] , pointing to converged behavior as a function of lattice size .",
    "morevover , the mid and long range amplitude of the sscf for a given lattice increases with increasing @xmath238 values .    in each panel of fig.[ss - n30-ne30 ] , the inset displays a close - up of the long range behavior of the sscf predicted by the ghf - fed and dmrg approximations compared with the one obtained within the standard uhf approach for @xmath36 .",
    "as can be observed , the amplitude of the uhf sscf remains constant for @xmath239 while the ghf - fed and dmrg ones exhibit a damped long range trend .",
    "previous studies have suggested that there are two important ingredients necessary to account for a qualitatively correct long range behavior of the sscfs : the self - consistent optimization of the intrinsic determinants ( i.e. , orbital relaxation @xcite ) and having pure spin states ( i.e. , no spin contamination @xcite ) .",
    "our wave functions meet both conditions .",
    "the magnetic structure factors ( msfs ) , evaluated at the wave vector @xmath240 , can be computed as    @xmath241    and the ones corresponding to the ground states for @xmath234 and @xmath41 are displayed in fig.[skk - vs - sites ] as functions of @xmath152 @xmath242 .",
    "the corresponding dmrg results are shown in the same plot .",
    "we have also included the uhf msfs for comparison purposes . at variance with the uhf msfs which diverge exponentially ,",
    "both the ghf - fed and dmrg results display an almost linear behavior .",
    "a previous work@xcite has shown that the sscfs in real space behave for a half - filled system as @xmath243 .",
    "this implies that as a funcion of the lattice size , the msfs should behave as @xmath244 @xmath118 . in fig.[skk - vs - sites ] , we have simply fitted a straight line using the dmrg msfs to guide the eye .",
    "we have not attempted to determine logarithmic corrections as this would require larger lattices than those studied in the present paper .      in panels ( a ) ,",
    "( b ) , and ( c ) of fig.[dosn10ne10 ] , we have plotted ( black ) the dos @xmath245 for @xmath155 . in the same figure ,",
    "we have also plotted ( red ) the exact dos obtained with an in - house full diagonalization code .",
    "there is excellent agreement between ours and the exact dos concerning the position and relative heights of all the prominent peaks .",
    "both ours and the exact dos exhibit the particle - hole symmetry well known for half - filled systems @xcite and a splitting into the lower and upper hubbard bands .",
    "the hubbard gap between these bands increases with larger @xmath238 .",
    "both dynamical cluster approximation @xcite and cellular dynamical mean field theory @xcite studies suggest that this gap is preserved for any finite value of the on - site interaction at sufficiently low temperatures even in the thermodynamic limit , with @xmath246 being the only singular point .",
    "tendencies to spin - charge separation as well as other relevant shadow features inside the brillouin zone , similar to the ones expected in the infinite-@xmath238 limit of the 1d hubbard model , @xcite have been found in previous cellular dynamical mean field theory @xcite and cluster perturbation theory @xcite studies of the spectral weigths in the case of finite on - site repulsions . in panels ( a ) ,",
    "( b ) , and ( c ) of fig.[sfholesn30 ] , we have plotted the hole sfs for the @xmath36 lattice .    the first feature observed from fig.[sfholesn30 ] is the hubbard gap opening at the fermi momentum @xmath247 .",
    "the spectral weight concentrates on the prominent peaks belonging to the spinon band .",
    "our calculations for smaller lattices with @xmath162 and @xmath10 indicate that this spinon band is quite stable in terms of lattice size although the relative height of its peaks decreases for increasing @xmath238 values .",
    "the holon singularities are clearly visible in some of the sfs shown in fig.sfholesn30 for linear momenta @xmath248 . on the other hand ,",
    "the holon bands can also be followed for linear momenta @xmath249 and @xmath250 .",
    "they are the mirror images of the ones with opposite @xmath251 values @xcite and become apparent for @xmath181 and @xmath8 . however , besides the spinon band , the most relevant feature in our sfs is the very extended distribution of the spectral weight for linear momenta @xmath248 .",
    "the comparison with our sfs for @xmath162 and @xmath252 obtained with @xmath11 and @xmath253 ghf - transformations , reveals that the increase of lattice size produces more pronounced shadow features due to the fragmentation of the spectral strength over a wider interval of @xmath254 values .",
    "the previous finite size results show that our sfs exhibit tendencies beyond a simple quasiparticle distribution and agree qualitatively well with the ones obtained using other approximations .",
    "@xcite        the shapes of some selected hole sfs are compared in panels ( d ) , ( e ) , and ( f ) of fig.[sfholesn30 ] . as can be seen from panel ( d ) ,",
    "@xmath255 transformations are enough to account for all relevant details of the sfs shown in panel ( a ) for @xmath153 . on the other hand , panels ( e ) and",
    "( f ) show that a larger number of transformations is required for @xmath181 and @xmath8 .",
    "in particular , increasing the number of transformations for the ( @xmath119)-systems from @xmath256 to @xmath255 and/or @xmath236 leads to a shift of the main peaks and redistributes the spectral strength of some of the peaks found in the sfs for @xmath256 as a result of the small number of configurations used in the calculations .",
    "this explains the differences between ours and the sfs reported , for the same lattice at @xmath181 , in the previous vap study @xcite of the 1d hubbard model using only @xmath257 and @xmath258 ghf - transformations .      in this section",
    ", we consider the low - lying excitation spectra obtained for @xmath259 and @xmath10 with the ghf - exc - fed scheme discussed in sec.[symmetry - multiref - excited ] .",
    "for each irreducible representation of the space group , we have computed the lowest - energy and first excited states with spins @xmath260 and @xmath261 .",
    "each of these states has been approximated by @xmath262 non - orthogonal symmetry - projected ghf - determinants .",
    "a final @xmath263 diagonalization of the 1d hubbard hamiltonian has also been carried out .",
    "for these particular lattices , we have found that for each symmetry @xmath33 , the ( gram - schmidt orthonormalized ) ground @xmath264 and first excited @xmath265 states are very weakly coupled through the hamiltonian . due to this , the energies corresponding to the states @xmath266 and @xmath267 resulting from the @xmath268 diagonalization are almost identical to those corresponding to the basis states @xmath269 and @xmath265 .",
    "however , this can not be anticipated _ a priori _ and the final diagonalization of the hamiltonian should always be carried out .    in fig.[vampir_vs_fed ] , we compare the energies of some selected states for @xmath9 and @xmath178 with the ones obtained in the previous variational study @xcite of the 1d hubbard model where 3d spin and linear momentum projections were carried out .",
    "the exact results in fig.[vampir_vs_fed ] correspond to lanczos diagonalizations . as can be observed , our mr calculations , where in addition to 3d spin projection the full space group of the 1d hubbard model is taken into account , improve the energies reported in ref .",
    "35 for both ground and excited states .    in fig.[fed - dispersions ] , we show the low - lying spectrum obtained via eq.([diagonalizationfinal ] ) , for @xmath162 [ panels ( a ) , ( b ) , and ( c ) ] and @xmath10 [ panels ( d ) , ( e ) , and ( f ) ] taken as representatives examples of systems whose @xmath163 and @xmath198 ground states have @xmath270 and @xmath158 symmetries , respectively .",
    "we observe that both the lowest - lying singlet and triplet states obtained in our calculations nicely follow the sine - like dispersion trend in the exact curve for @xmath271 .",
    "the anomaly observed in the ghf - exc - fed @xmath272-dispersion for the lowest - energy singlets and triplets has also been found in previous studies within the reshf framework ikawa-1993 as well as in finite versions of the exact lieb - wu solutions .",
    "@xcite for any finite u value , the exact @xmath273 curves exhibit gapped excitations , exception made for the @xmath274 and @xmath275 states which are degenerate . in our calculations such a degeneracy is broken due to finite size effects . however , we observe that for a given finite @xmath238 value , the energy difference between the lowest singlet and triplet states decreases with increasing lattice size .",
    "for example , for @xmath276 we have obtained @xmath277 in the case @xmath278 while @xmath279 for @xmath40 . for increasing on - site respulsions , irrespective of the lattice size , an overall compression of the spectra takes place .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that in the limit @xmath280 all the configurations shown in fig.[fed - dispersions ] should become degenerate .      in sec.[solitons - ghf - fed ] , we have discussed the structure of the intrinsic determinants associated with the ghf - fed states . here , we pay attention to the symmetry - broken ones used to expand the ghf - exc - fed wave functions .",
    "to illustrate our results , we consider states belonging to the spectrum shown in panel ( e ) of fig.[fed - dispersions ] . in particular , we have plotted in panels ( a ) to ( d ) of fig.[solitons_excited_states ] the quantities @xmath224 ( black ) and @xmath281 ( red ) computed [ see , eq.([sdw1 ] ) ] with some of the @xmath11 and @xmath282 symmetry - broken determinants @xmath127 and @xmath283 used to expand the lowest - energy @xmath284 and first excited @xmath285 states with @xmath286 and @xmath164 symmetry .",

    "\\(i ) we have presented a powerful methodology of a vap mr configuration mixing scheme , originally devised for the nuclear many - body problem , but not yet considered to study ground and excited states , with well defined symmetry quantum numbers , of the 1d hubbard model with nearest - neighbor hopping and periodic boundary conditions .",
    "both ground and excited states are expanded in terms of non - orthogonal and ritz - variationally optimized symmetry - projected configurations .",
    "the simple structure of our projected states allows an efficient parallelization of our variational scheme , which scales linearly with the number of processors as well as with the number of transformations used in the calculations .",
    "the method also provides a ( truncated ) basis consisting of a few gram - schmidt orthonormalized states .",
    "this basis may be used to diagonalized the hamiltonian to account , in a similar fashion , for additional correlations in the ground and excited states with well defined symmetry quantum numbers .",
    "\\(ii ) we have shown that our mr approximation gives accurate ground state energies and correlation energies as compared with the exact lieb - wu solutions for relatively large half - filled lattices up to @xmath288 and @xmath189 sites .",
    "the comparison with other theoretical approaches also reveals that our scheme can be considered as a reasonable starting point for obtaining correlated ground state wave functions in the case of the 1d hubbard model .",
    "we have computed the full low - lying spectrum for the @xmath162 and @xmath10 lattices .",
    "the momentum dispersion of the lowest - lying singlet and triplet states follows the exact shape predicted by the lieb - wu solution in the thermodynamic limit . with increasing @xmath238",
    "we also observe a general compresion of the spectrum .",
    "\\iii ) from the analysis of the structure of the intrinsic determinants associated with our mr ground and excited state wave functions , we observe that they all contain defects ( i.e. , solitons ) that can be regarded as basic units of quantum fluctuations for the considered lattices .",
    "\\(iv ) our results for the ground state sscfs in real space show long range decay that is not observed in the uhf case .",
    "the msfs computed from such correlation functions show a behavior approximately linear in @xmath152 @xmath289 consistent with previous results available in the literature .",
    "\\(v ) our approximation also allows to compute sfs and the dos . to this end",
    ", we considered anstze , whose flexibility is determined by the numbers @xmath108 and @xmath125 of hf - transformations used to expand the wave functions of systems with @xmath0 and @xmath290-electrons . for a small lattice with @xmath155 we have compared the dos predicted within our approach with the one obtained using a full diagonalization and found an excellent agreement between both . for a larger lattice with @xmath36",
    "our scheme provides hole sfs that agree qualitatively well with the ones obtained with other approximations and exhibit tendencies beyond a simple quasiparticle distribution .",
    "we believe that the finite size calculations discussed in the present study already show that vap approximations , based on mr expansions in terms of non - orthogonal symmetry - projected hf - determinants , represent useful tools that complement other existing approaches to study the physics of low - dimensional correlated electronic systems . within this context",
    ", the scheme presented in this work leaves ample space for further improvements and research .",
    "first , the number of non - orthogonal symmetry - projected configurations used in the corresponding mr expansions can be increased to improve the quality of our wave functions .",
    "second , we could still incorporate particle number symmetry breaking ( i.e. , general hfb - transformations ) and restoration ( i.e. , particle number projection ) to access even more correlations .",
    "third , our scheme can be easily extended to the 2d case as well as to doped systems with arbitrary on - site interaction strengths .",
    "our approximation is also general enough so as to be implemented for the molecular hamiltonian @xcite as well as for lattices like the honeycomb , the kagome or the shastry - sutherland @xcite ones .",
    "the same vap mr scheme can also be applied to study frustrated hubbard models in the 1d and 2d cases .",
    "finally , the mr scheme discussed in the present work could also be used as a powerful solver in the framework of fragment - bath embedding approximations .",
    "@xcite in particular , it could replace exact diagonalizations for fragment sizes where it is not feasible while still providing highly correlated ( fragment ) wave functions .",

    "<S> we present a multi - reference configuration mixing scheme for describing ground and excited states , with well defined spin and space group symmetry quantum numbers , of the one - dimensional hubbard model with nearest - neighbor hopping and periodic boundary conditions . within this scheme </S>",
    "<S> , each state is expanded in terms of non - orthogonal and variationally determined symmetry - projected configurations . </S>",
    "<S> the results for lattices up to 30 and 50 sites compare well with the exact lieb - wu solutions as well as with results from other state - of - the - art approximations . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to spin - spin correlation functions in real space and magnetic structure factors , we present results for spectral functions and density of states computed with an ansatz whose quality can be well - controlled by the number of symmetry - projected configurations used to approximate the systems with @xmath0 and @xmath1 electrons . </S>",
    "<S> the intrinsic symmetry - broken determinants resulting from the variational calculations have rich structures in terms of defects that can be regarded as basic units of quantum fluctuations . given the quality of the results here reported , as well as the parallelization properties of the considered scheme , we believe that symmetry - projection techniques , which have found ample applications in nuclear structure physics , deserve further attention in the study of low - dimensional correlated many - electron systems . </S>"
