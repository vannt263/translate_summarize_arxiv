    "the formation of galaxies and their influence on the physical state of the inter - galactic medium ( igm ) is often studied using semi - analytical models of structure formation ( for example @xcite ) .",
    "such studies will allow one to extensively explore the unknown parameter space related to physical conditions in a high redshift galaxy and its star formation , with limited computational resources .",
    "semi - analytical models together with available observations can be used to understand the evolution of our universe while putting tight constraints on various physical processes associated with the high redshift universe . in samui",
    "et al . ( 2007 , 2008 ) ( hereafter paper  i and paper  ii ) we used semi - analytical models to predict the ionization history of the universe , the high redshift ( @xmath2 ) uv luminosity functions of lbgs and also the global effect of galactic outflows .    in any semi - analytical galaxy formation model , one needs to assume some form of the halo mass function giving the number density of dark matter halos as a function of mass and redshift .",
    "the first halo mass function in an analytical form was given by press & schechter ( 1974 ) .",
    "the press - schechter ( ps ) mass function has been widely employed in semi - analytical models of galaxy formation and in understanding the high redshift universe .",
    "it is important to note that one needs not just the dark halo mass function at any redshift , but also their formation rate and survival probability . for the ps mass function ,",
    "sasaki ( 1994 ) proposed a method to find the formation rate of halos and their survival probability at later epochs .",
    "note that one can also find this rate through n - body simulations , or by constructing a large number of merger trees .",
    "however , it turns out that we need to resolve halo masses over a wide dynamic range from @xmath3 to @xmath4 , to model both the effect of outflows and the galactic luminosity function .",
    "one also needs to have a large enough number of halos in the simulation or a large number of realizations of the merger trees , to obtain good statistics of the range of galaxy properties .",
    "therefore , to have a preliminary look at this challenging problem , in paper  i and  ii , we focused on analytical methods .",
    "in particular we used the ps mass function and the sasaki formalism , to predict the ionization history of the universe , the high redshift ( @xmath2 ) uv luminosity functions and also the global effect of galactic outflows .    in paper",
    "i , we concluded that the observed redshift evolution of the luminosity function of lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) at @xmath5 requires evolution in physical properties that govern the star formation activity on top of the evolution in the number density of dark matter halos coming from the structure formation model .",
    "we found that the required amount of redshift evolution in the star formation activities depends on the redshift evolution of the number density of dark matter halos and hence on the assumed form of the halo mass function .    in paper",
    "ii , we showed that galactic scale outflows originating predominantly from small mass halos with mass @xmath6 can pollute 60% of the igm with metals at @xmath7 with a metallicity floor of @xmath8 .",
    "inclusion of star formation in even smaller mass halos which cool due to the presence of h@xmath9 or hd molecules , helps more in spreading the metals .",
    "this is because they are more abundant and hence their mean separation is smaller . in these models , even at @xmath10 , more than 60% of igm is being polluted with metals .",
    "these conclusions may crucially depend on the choice of the adopted form of the mass function .",
    "it is known that the ps mass function does not provide a good fit to the number density of dark matter halos determined from recent high resolution simulations of galaxy formation . from such simulations a number of different fitting formulae for the halo mass function have been suggested ( see for example sheth & tormen 1999 ; jenkins et al . 2001 ; reed et al .",
    "2003 , 2007 and warren et al .",
    "note that there is no direct way to scale the results obtained by assuming the ps mass function to results which would arise from these other mass functions .",
    "therefore it is important to revisit various issues discussed in paper  i and ii considering the mass functions determined from the simulations .",
    "this forms the basic motivation of this paper .",
    "we will mainly concentrate , as in paper  i and ii , on high redshift ( i.e. @xmath11 ) uv luminosity function of lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) and the effect of galactic outflows on the igm adopting a self consistent reionization history .",
    "note that the sasaki formalism , used in paper i and ii , is not easily generalisable to other mass functions ( ripamonti , 2007 and also see discussion in section  2 ) . an alternative is to simply take the derivative of the mass function under the assumption that it is sufficiently close to the net formation rate of objects in the mass range that is of interest to the semi - analytic models .",
    "this approach is widely used in several semi - analytical models in the literature ( for example haehnelt & rees 1993 , scannapieco 2005 ) .",
    "the derivative includes not only the formation rate of halos , but also their destruction rate at the same redshift .",
    "therefore it is not guaranteed to be positive definite .",
    "this is the disadvantage of using the derivative of the mass function .",
    "nevertheless , in the range of halo masses that we will be interested in at different redshifts , we will see that the derivative of the mass function is indeed positive definite .",
    "therefore , for other mass functions consider in this work , we simply use its derivative to model the net formation rate of dark matter halos .",
    "we will also compare results obtained using the derivative as an alternative to the sasaki formalism for the ps mass function .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  2",
    "we review different proposals for the halo mass function that we wish to study and also compare the net formation rate of collapsed halos predicted by these mass functions .",
    "the star formation and reionization models are described in section  3 . in section  4",
    "we show the effect of the halo mass function on the predicted uv luminosity functions of high redshift lbgs .",
    "in particular , we use the @xmath0-minimization technique to discriminate between models using different mass functions .",
    "the feedback of galactic outflows on the igm is discussed in section  5 .",
    "finally section  6 gives our conclusions . in this work we use the cosmological parameters consistent with the recent wmap 5th year data release i.e. @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 ( dunkley et al .",
    "also we use a salpeter stellar initial mass function ( imf ) in the mass range @xmath19 unless otherwise mentioned .",
    "the halo mass function is defined to be the number density of collapsed dark matter halos in the mass range @xmath20 and @xmath21 at a given redshift @xmath22 .",
    "the differential halo mass function is defined as @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the average density of the universe at that redshift .",
    "the rms density fluctuations , @xmath25 , of the smooth density field with a top - hat window function is defined as @xmath26 where , @xmath27 is the linear power spectrum of the density fluctuations at @xmath28 , @xmath29 is the fourier transform of the real - space top - hat filter , and @xmath30 is the growth factor of linear perturbations normalized to unity at @xmath28 ( peebles 1993 , padmanabhan 2002 ) .",
    "the idea of representing the mass function in the form of eq .",
    "[ eqn_mf ] is that different analytical forms of the halo mass function can be represented with different forms of the function @xmath31 in that equation .",
    "for example , @xmath31 for the ps mass function is given by @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the critical over density for collapse , usually taken to be equal to @xmath34 .",
    "the simple form of ps mass function has been widely used in the semi - analytical models of galaxy formation ( chiu & ostriker 2000 , barkana & loeb 2001 , nagamine et al 2006 ) .",
    "the deviation of the ps mass function from numerical simulations was pointed out by sheth & tormen ( 1999 ) .",
    "the discrepancy is larger for high mass rare objects , the ps mass function always predicting a smaller number of rare objects compared to numerical simulations .",
    "sheth & tormen ( 1999 ) proposed a modification of the ps mass function which provides a better fit to the numerical simulation data .",
    "the sheth - tormen ( st ) mass function takes the following form : @xmath35 { \\frac}{\\delta_c}{\\sigma}\\exp{\\left(-{\\frac}{a\\delta_c^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right)}. \\label{eqn_st}\\ ] ] choosing @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 in eq .",
    "[ eqn_st ] provides a better fit to mass functions obtained from numerical simulations over a wide range of masses and redshifts compared to the ps formula .",

    "they used high - resolution @xmath43cdm numerical simulations to calculate @xmath31 of dark matter halos down to the scale of dwarf galaxies , back to a redshift of @xmath47 .",
    "they showed that the st mass function provides a good fit to their data except for redshift @xmath48 or higher where it over predicts halo numbers by more than @xmath49 . in a later work , reed et al .",

    "meanwhile warren et al .",
    "( 2006 ) performed simulations where they corrected a systematic error in halo - mass determination by the friends - of - friends halo finder .",
    "they also measured the shape and quantified the uncertainty in the predicted theoretical mass function of dark matter halos in @xmath43cdm cosmology and showed that the canonical st and jw forms of the mass function are inconsistent with the @xmath43cdm mass function at a @xmath55 level at intermediate masses , and @xmath56 at the highest masses .",
    "they provided an analytical fit to @xmath31 given by @xmath57}. \\label{eqn_w}\\ ] ] thus we have a set of halo mass functions which gives a better fit to the numerical simulations of galaxy formation compared to the classical ps formula . here , we consider these set of @xmath31 to examine how sensitive the predictions of semi - analytical models are to the assumed form of the halo mass function .",
    "we begin by comparing the net formation rate of dark matter halos for different halo mass functions described above .",
    "this is the most fundamental ingredient in any semi - analytical model of galaxy formation . in paper",
    "i  &  ii we used sasaki formalism of the ps mass function to get the formation rate . following the same steps for the st mass function we obtain @xmath58 \\left[{\\frac}{d(z_c)}{d(z)}\\right]^{1 - 2p }   \\label{eqn_st_sasaki}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath59 is the formation rate of the dark matter halos collapsed at @xmath60 and survive till some observed redshift , @xmath61 .",
    "the survival probability is given by @xmath62^{(1 - 2p)}$ ] .",
    "note that putting @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath63 in above equation gives back the sasaki formalism of the ps mass function ( see eq .  1 of paper  i ) .",
    "it is clear from the above equation that due to the presence of @xmath64 term , it is not guaranteed that the formation rate will always be positive . as formation rate being negative",
    "is unphysical the generalization of sasaki formalism for the st mass function is incorrect .",
    "therefore , as mentioned in section 1 , we rather model the net formation rate of collapsed dark matter halos , by taking the redshift derivative of the halo mass function , @xmath65 .        in fig .",
    "[ fig_rates ] we show the ratio of the redshift derivatives for different halo mass functions to that obtained for the ps mass function . in panels with @xmath66 we show three characteristics masses related to our star formation model at that redshift .",
    "the dotted vertical lines show the mass that collapsed from @xmath67 fluctuations at that redshift .",
    "in addition with solid ( red ) and dashed ( blue ) arrows we show the masses corresponding to halos with circular velocity @xmath68 and @xmath69 respectively . this is the mass range where radiative feedback from the metagalactic uv background becomes important ( thoul & weinberg 1996 , also see in sec .  3 ) .",
    "in this redshift range the process of reionization is believed to be already over ( fan et al .",
    "2006 ) and hence the radiative feedback is well constrained in our model ( indeed we will see in the next section that all our models predict redshift of reionization @xmath70 ) .",
    "we do not show these arrows for @xmath71 as the exact radiative feedback will depend on the history of reionization .",
    "thus , for @xmath71 we only show the mass that collapsed from a @xmath67 fluctuations by dotted lines .",
    "it is clear from the figure that for higher mass objects which are rare , the ps mass function always predicts a smaller net halo formation rate compared to any other mass function . for smaller mass objects the trend is opposite .",
    "this will lead to different slope in the luminosity function derived from different halo mass function . at @xmath72",
    "all the mass functions predict similar halo formation rate ( within 10% ) around the characteristic mass which corresponds to @xmath73 fluctuations .",
    "however , at the typical halo masses that will be detected as galaxies ( @xmath74 ) ps underpredicts the net halo formation rate upto an order of magnitude .    for @xmath75",
    "the @xmath67 fluctuations are above @xmath76 and the predictions of other mass functions compared to that of ps mass function are upto an order of magnitude higher .",
    "however , in our modelling of star formation , we assume a sharp cut off in the star formation for halos of mass above @xmath76 , attributed to the agn feedback ( see section  2 of paper  i ) .",
    "this reduces the difference in the prediction of our semi - analytical modelling of star formation arising due to different halo mass functions at these redshifts .",
    "hence , for @xmath75 all the mass functions predict a halo formation rate within a factor 2 of each other , for typical masses which contribute to the star formation .",
    "the abrupt cut - off seen in the formation rate at @xmath77 around @xmath78 is due to the fact the derivative of the ps mass function is becoming negative .",
    "this shows the unphysical behavior in calculating the net formation rate by taking derivative of the mass function . however , star formation in such low mass halos ( @xmath79 ) at @xmath80 are suppressed by the radiative feedback ( see below ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that all the mass functions other than the ps mass function predict similar @xmath81 .",
    "this clearly shows that semi - analytical models using different mass functions ( except the ps mass function ) , will all give similar results .",
    "it is a nontrivial exercise to demonstrate the difference between the formation rate obtained from the sasaki formalism of the ps mass function , ( @xmath82 ) , to that calculated by taking the derivative ( @xmath83 ) .",
    "this is because in the sasaki formalism one needs two redshifts , namely the collapse redshift ( @xmath60 ) of the halo and the observed redshift ( @xmath22 ) in order to calculate the formation rate weighted by the survival probability . on the other hand",
    "the derivative contains only one redshift , the collapse redshift .",
    "however , we will try to show the difference between these two approaches in the specific context of outflows in section 5 .    in the following sections we will show how the predictions of semi - analytic galaxy formation models change with the mass function used .",
    "we begin with a brief overview of our prescriptions for star formation and reionization as in paper  i and ii .",
    "the star formation rate of an individual dark matter halo of mass @xmath20 collapsed at redshift @xmath60 and observed at redshift @xmath22 is modelled by ( chiu & ostriker 2000 ) , @xmath84 . \\label{eqn_sfr}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath85 is the fraction of total baryonic mass that goes into stars in the entire lifetime of the halo and @xmath86 is a parameter which governs the duration of the star formation activity in the halo . as in papers",
    "i and ii we take @xmath87 unless stated otherwise .",
    "further , @xmath88 is the age of the universe at redshift @xmath22 ; thus @xmath89 is the age of the galaxy and @xmath90 is the dynamical time at that epoch .",
    "the star formation rate is converted to luminosity at @xmath91     assuming an initial mass function ( imf ) of the stars formed [ see eq .  ( 6)-(8 ) of paper  i ] .",
    "only a fraction ( @xmath92 ) of this uv luminosity would come out from the galaxy due to the absorption by dust .",
    "the minimum critical mass of a halo ( @xmath93 ) which can sustain star formation at a given epoch is decided by the cooling efficiency of the gas and also by radiative feedback in ionized regions .",
    "we consider models with @xmath93 corresponding to a virial temperature , @xmath94  k ( as `` atomic cooled model '' ) and @xmath95  k ( `` molecular cooled model '' ) . for ionized regions of the universe , our models assume complete suppression of star formation in halos below a circular velocity @xmath96  km  s@xmath97 , no suppression above circular velocity of @xmath98 km s@xmath97 and a linear fit from @xmath99 to @xmath100 for the intermediate masses ( as in bromm & loeb 2002 ; also see benson et al . 2002 ; dijkstra et al .",
    "we have already indicated these characteristic masses in fig .",
    "[ fig_rates ] with solid ( red ) and dashed ( blue ) arrows .",
    "the star formation in the high mass halos are also reduced by a suppression factor @xmath101^{-1}$ ] to incorporate possible agn type feedback in massive halos as in paper  i ( also see bower et al .",
    "2005 ; best et al . 2006 ) .",
    "given the luminosity evolution for an individual galaxy , and their abundance from the halo mass function , one can then easily estimate the uv luminosity function at any redshift ( eq .  ( 8) of paper  i ) .",
    "ionization history of the universe is required to self - consistently incorporate radiative feedback for each model .",
    "we compute it following again the method set out in paper  i ( section 2.4 ) . in table",
    "[ tab_reion ] we summarize the reionization history in terms of the electron scattering optical depth to the reionization ( @xmath102 ) and the redshift of reionization ( @xmath103 ) for some of our models .",
    "note that @xmath103 is the redshift when the hydrogen ionization fraction becomes unity .",

    "we find these differences to remain within @xmath107 .",
    "this also turns out to be the case for molecular cooled models . indeed",
    "the reionization histories are also almost identical . however , the st and other mass functions predict slightly different reionization histories compared to the ps mass function though they do not differ greatly amongst themselves .",
    "it is interesting that even if @xmath85 is larger for the model with the ps mass function compared to that with other mass functions , @xmath102 is smaller in this model .",
    "thus to get the same @xmath102 we need a smaller efficiency ( or @xmath85 ) for models with st and other mass functions compared to models using the ps mass function .",
    "this basically reflects the smaller abundance of rare high mass collapsed halos for the ps halo mass function at high @xmath22 .",
    "however for ` molecular cooled ' models , one needs to lower @xmath85 considerably in the molecular cooled objects , to be consistent with the observed value of @xmath102 for the st and other mass functions .",
    "this can be seen in table  [ tab_reion ] , that to be consistent with the observed @xmath102 , one needs to adopt a value of @xmath108 for molecular cooled halos .",
    "also note that @xmath103 is less in molecular cooled models though @xmath102 is higher .",
    "this is because of radiative feedback : more uv photons are generated by the molecular cooled objects which increase the degree of ionization of the igm at a given redshift compared to atomic cooled models , and causes early suppression of star formation in halos with a circular velocity less than @xmath98 km s@xmath97 .",
    "hence it takes longer time to get complete reionization of the igm making @xmath103 less in molecular cooled models .    hence we conclude that the st and other mass functions leads to higher @xmath102 compared to the ps mass function even when we use lower @xmath85 .",
    "thus to reproduce observed @xmath102 , the models using other mass functions require less efficiency for star formation and/or uv escape compared to that of models using the ps mass function .",
    "if stars are formed with ` top - heavy ' imf in the molecular cooled low mass halos then one has to further reduce the @xmath85 in those halos , to have a consistent @xmath102 .",
    "in particular the reionization efficiency of molecular cooled halos has to be substantially reduced when one uses the st and other mass functions obtained from the simulation instead of the ps mass function .",
    "in this section we turn our attention to the uv luminosity function .",
    "first we illustrate the differences between results from different mass functions for fixed model parameters ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_uv_lf ] ) . here",
    ", we do not make any attempt to fit the observed luminosity function .",
    "this will be done in the latter part of this section .",
    "in our model we assume @xmath109 , @xmath110 with cosmological parameters mentioned in the introduction .",
    "we apply a constant dust reddening correction of factor @xmath111 for all redshifts and masses .",
    "it is clear from this figure that at @xmath112 , the ps halo mass function ( solid lines ) predicts lower number of lbgs compared to any other mass functions in the observed luminosity range .",
    "this is simply a manifestation of the fact that the ps mass function predicts less number of rare high mass halos compared to other mass functions .",
    "but at the low mass end the ps mass function predicts a higher number density of collapsed objects .",
    "this effect can be seen at @xmath113 where the uv luminosity function at @xmath114 is slightly higher for the models with ps mass function .",
    "the difference between the ps mass function and other mass functions are mass dependent which leads to a different slope in the luminosity function calculated from different mass functions .",
    "as expected all the other halo mass functions obtained from the simulation predict almost the same luminosity function at all redshifts .",
    "it is interesting to see that all the mass functions predict almost similar luminosity function at @xmath113 even though they are different at higher redshifts . as we pointed out before the slopes of the luminosity functions coming from different mass functions are indeed different .    in the right panels of fig .",
    "[ fig_uv_lf ] we show the ratio of luminosity function obtained from the ps mass function to that from the st mass function .",
    "it is clear from the figure that there is a characteristics luminosity ( or in turn the halo mass ) for each redshift where the amplitude of the luminosity function derived from the ps and st mass functions match with each other .",
    "however this characteristic luminosity increases with decreasing redshift . at @xmath7 , in the mass range of halos where star formation takes place the ps mass function over produces halos compared to the st mass function ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_rates ] ) . at the low mass range",
    "the excess is roughly a factor 2 .",
    "the excess seen at the low end of the luminosity function produced by the ps mass function is due to this . at @xmath115",
    "all the models produce same number density at @xmath113 .",
    "as star formation in halos above this mass are suppressed we do not see order of magnitude deviation in the high luminosity end as we would have expected from fig .",
    "[ fig_rates ] .",
    "however at @xmath116 , compared to the ps mass function the st mass function produces a factor @xmath117 excess at @xmath118 and similar number of halos at the mass corresponding to @xmath119 km  s@xmath97 .",
    "thus we see a much better matching at the low luminosity end of the luminosity function ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_uv_lf ] ) and a very strong deviation at the high luminosity end for @xmath120 .",
    "thus the reasonable match in the luminosity function at @xmath113 and strong disagreement at high-@xmath22 could be attributed to the fact that as one moves to higher and higher redshifts a given luminosity range is contributed by rarer and rarer objects ( or higher @xmath25 fluctuations ; see fig .",
    "[ fig_rates ] ) and the ps mass function is known to predict less number of rare objects compared to the st mass function or other mass functions derived from simulations .",
    "we find that the luminosity functions calculated using the derivative of the ps mass function and that obtained from the sasaki formalism , differ negligibly for @xmath87 .",
    "however for @xmath121 the sasaki formalism predicts larger abundances by about @xmath122 , in the observed luminosity range .",
    "the reason is as follows : first , the sasaki formalism for @xmath123 gives the formation rate of halos , while the derivative gives the formation minus the destruction rate , and hence a lower net formation rate .",
    "second , for any @xmath86 we detect galaxies whose ages are @xmath124 , when they shine the maximum . in the sasaki formalism , only a fraction of halos @xmath125 formed at @xmath126 survive at the observed time @xmath127 . for small @xmath86",
    ", we have @xmath128 , and thus @xmath129 and the luminosity function predicted by the sasaki formalism is higher , as its formation rate is higher .",
    "however as @xmath86 increases , @xmath130 increases , @xmath131 decreases , and hence luminosity functions computed by the two methods first approach each other for @xmath132 , after which the derivative method starts to produce a larger luminosity function . nevertheless , since @xmath90 is much smaller than the hubble time , we find the differences between the luminosity function calculated by these two methods , are less than @xmath122 for all @xmath22 .",
    "this difference is much smaller than the difference between luminosity functions , that are obtained using ps and other mass functions for @xmath133 .",
    "it is also clear from fig .",
    "[ fig_uv_lf ] that the shape of the uv luminosity functions ( the slope and characteristic luminosity ) and its redshift evolution , does depend on the assumed form of the halo mass function .",
    "this is expected as we have seen in fig .",
    "[ fig_rates ] that the difference of halo formation rate coming out from different mass functions are mass dependent .",
    "hence it suggests that , in principle we would be able to constrain the form of the halo mass function , just by fitting the luminosity functions . in what follows we use @xmath0 minimization to address this issue .",
    "we use @xmath0 minimization technique to quantify how well the models using different mass functions reproduce the observed luminosity functions . for each redshift bin",

    "a single sne is assumed to produce @xmath188  erg of energy out of which a fraction @xmath189 goes into the outflow .",
    "the outflow is taken to be spherically symmetric and its dynamics is followed using a thin - shell approximation ( see eqs .",
    "( 5)-(16 ) of paper  ii for the details ) .",
    "the dark matter potential of the halo is assumed to be in nfw profile and a fraction ( @xmath190 ) of the total baryonic mass is taken to be in thermal equilibrium at virial temperature in this potential . the amount of mass coming out of the star forming region is assumed to be proportional to the mass of stars formed with the proportionality constant @xmath191 .",
    "we also assume that @xmath192 of the shocked igm / halo gas is concentrated in the thin - shell region and rest @xmath193 is incorporated in the hot bubble .",
    "the initial radius of the shell is taken to be @xmath194 the virial radius , and the outflow is frozen to the hubble flow when its peculiar velocity drops to the sound speed of the surrounding igm .",
    "the extent @xmath195 , to which an individual outflow can propagate into the igm , depends mainly on the rate of sne productions and the energy efficiency of the outflow , @xmath196 . in paper",
    "ii , we showed that @xmath195 is fairly independent of other parameters as long as the outflow escapes the halo potential .",
    "note that we have already constrained @xmath134 by fitting the uv luminosity functions of lbgs .",

    "one can also calculate porosity weighted averages of various physical quantities associated with the outflows , and their probability distribution functions ( pdfs ) . in our models , we compute the metallicity of the outflowing gas and the global average metallicity assuming instantaneous metal mixing within the galaxy ( see appendix  a of paper  ii ) .        in fig .",
    "[ fig_filling ] we show the filling factor of the universe as predicted by using different halo mass functions .",
    "the different models considered are : the st ( long dashed green ) , jw ( short dashed blue ) , warren ( dot dot dashed magenta ) and reed ( dotted dashed violet ) halo mass functions . in all these models",
    "we assume @xmath206 . for comparison",
    "we also show the filling factor as calculated from the the ps mass function using both the sasaki formalism ( thick solid black line ) and by taking the derivative to compute the net formation rate ( the short dashed red line ) .",
    "recall that in these models we take @xmath207 .",

    "the reason behind this can be understood as follows . in case of sasaki formalism whenever a halo is destroyed , one implicitly assumes that the outflowing material no longer contributes to the volume filling factor .",
    "but in the models with the derivative of the ps mass function once an outflow is formed it contributes to the volume filling factor for ever ; although the derivative itself gives the net ( formation minus destruction ) rate , at @xmath60 . and",
    "thus leads to a smaller formation rate of halos at @xmath60 . the net difference between sasaki formalism and the derivative of the ps mass function",

    "note that @xmath82 and @xmath215 come as a part of the integrand over @xmath60 while calculating the porosity of the galactic outflows at a given @xmath22 ( eq .  [ eqn_q ] ) .",
    "we choose these values of @xmath20 as outflowing material from halos with such masses dominate the volume filling factor of igm , as mentioned above .",
    "it is clear from the figure that at typical collapsed redshifts for such halos ( as indicated with the arrows ) the derivative of the ps mass functions predicts about a factor of @xmath144 higher net formation rate compared to that of sasaki formalism applied to the ps mass function .",
    "this difference decreases with decreasing @xmath60 and at certain redshift the sasaki formalism predicts higher formation rate ( weighted by the destruction probability ) compared to the derivative .",
    "however the star formation in halos with these masses would be suppressed by the radiation feedback due to reionization at @xmath2186 .",
    "therefore , at @xmath113 , the integrand in eq .  [ eqn_q ] will be larger for the ps derivative compared to that obtained from sasaki formalism ( for the range of halo masses and @xmath60 that contributes dominantly to @xmath208 ) .",
    "for this reason the model with the derivative of the ps mass function predicts higher volume filling factor even if the uv luminosity function predicted by them were same .",
    "note that when we use the sasaki formalism , we could go to the other extreme and not destroy any outflow , by replacing the survival probability , @xmath219 , with unity . in this case",
    "we find that the volume filling factor is the largest , even higher than that obtained when one uses the derivative of the mass function to calculate the halo formation rate .",
    "we show this as a thin solid line in fig .  [ fig_filling ] .",
    "the volume filling factor that realistically obtains will be bracketed by these two cases ( the thick / thin solid lines of fig .  [ fig_filling ] ) .",
    "this difference also gives an estimate of the uncertainty in the volume filling factor obtained in semi - analytic models .",
    "we see from fig  [ fig_rates ] that the net formation rates , calculated using the derivative of all the mass functions , agree reasonably well , for halos that contributes dominantly to @xmath208 .",

    "( a ) we compare the filling factor that we have already discussed in great details .",
    "panel ( b ) compares the porosity weighted average mass of the dark matter halos that contribute to the filling factor . since the st mass function predicts more high mass objects , the average halo mass that contribute to the filling factor predicted by this model is slightly higher compared to the ps mass function for @xmath221 . however , vary massive halos which formed at lower redshifts do not have an outflow due to smaller value of @xmath85 .",
    "hence at @xmath212 average mass contributed to the volume filling factor is less in the models with the st mass function compared to that with the ps mass function .",
    "panel ( c ) compares the porosity weighted average radius of outflows whereas panel ( d ) compares the global average metallicity produced by star formation ( the top set of curves ) , and that which is injected into the igm ( the lower set of curves ) . due to the reason already mentioned above ,",

    "( e ) and panel ( f ) we show the porosity averaged peculiar velocity of the outflow and the temperature of the hot bubble respectively .",
    "both the average peculiar velocity and the temperature are higher in case of the sasaki formalism mainly reflecting the fact that @xmath85 is higher for the ps mass function compared to the st mass function . for the ps mass function , although the sasaki formalism and the derivative have the same @xmath85 the average peculiar velocity and the temperature are lower in the model with the derivative due to the higher volume filling factor . in general",
    ", we conclude from fig .",
    "[ fig_wind_avg ] that even if the filling factor changes depending on the way we calculate the net formation rate ( upto 50% change ) , the physical properties related to the outflow do not vary significantly between these models . as mentioned earlier ,",
    "an important invariant feature of all the outflow models is that small mass halos with @xmath222 contribute dominantly to the porosity @xmath199 ( as originally discussed by silk , wyse & shields , 1987 , miralda - escude & rees , 1997 , nath & trentham , 1997 , madau , ferrara & rees , 2001 ) .",
    "the mildly overdense regions which produce the lyman-@xmath223 forest lines probe the power spectrum of density perturbations down to a comoving scale of half a mpc or so at @xmath7 . in paper  ii we found that in the atomic cooled models , the igm is polluted by regions of hot gas ( @xmath224  k ) with sizes of @xmath225  kpc .",
    "this could potentially distort the density power spectrum as inferred from the lyman-@xmath223 forest .",
    "there is no evidence in the current data for such distortions .",
    "however , this aspect needs to be studied further to see how much of a problem this is for the above models .    on the other hand",
    ", we also noted that molecular cooled models are better placed to seed the igm with metals without strong distorting effects on the lyman-@xmath223 forest lines . this is because outflows from molecular cooled halos can significantly fill the universe , even at @xmath226 , while at the same time having typically a much smaller radius .",
    "we therefore also consider here the effect of changing the halo mass function in such models .        in fig .",
    "[ fig_wind_m ] we show the volume filling factor predicted by the molecular cooled models , as obtained from the models with derivative of the ps ( dashed ) and st ( solid ) mass function .",
    "we also show the @xmath227 when we use the sasaki formalism and the ps mass function ( dotted dashed line ) .",
    "we take @xmath228 in the molecular cooled halos in order to be consistent with the optical depth of reionization inferred from the cmb polarization measurements ( see table  [ tab_reion ] ) . as expected all these models",
    "fill the igm with outflows and metals at fairly high redshift ( @xmath229 ) .",
    "the volume filling factor is again smaller when one employs the sasaki formalism , essentially for the same reason as discussed in the case of atomic cooled models .",
    "the higher value of @xmath85 in the model with the derivative of the ps mass function compared to the model with the derivative of the st mass function makes the volume filling factor larger for the former model .",
    "we have also checked that physical parameters in these models are similar to that obtained in the molecular cooled models discussed in paper  ii .",
    "hence the conclusions about the molecular cooled models arrived at in paper  ii remain ; that they are more favorable in spreading the metals , without unduly distorting the lyman-@xmath223 forest .",
    "in a series of papers ( paper i and paper ii ) we have been developing semi - analytic models of star formation and associated outflows in high redshift galaxies that are constrained by available observations on uv luminosity function and reionization .",
    "our models successfully explained the observed uv luminosity functions of lyman break galaxies at @xmath5 and predicted various effects of outflows form the galaxies on the metal enrichment of the igm .",
    "in all these models one of the main ingredients is the halo mass function .",
    "we used the standard ps mass function with the halo formation rate given by sasaki ( 1994 ) . however the halo mass functions determined by fitting various numerical simulations of galaxy formation",
    "differ considerably from the ps mass function , especially for rare objects .",
    "it is then necessary to examine how this affects the model predictions given in paper i and ii . here",
    ", we present a systematic comparison of the results for different analytical forms of the halo mass functions .",
    "further , two methods are normally used in the literature to compute the net formation rate of halos for the ps mass function ; ( i ) the formalism of sasaki is used to calculate a formation rate of halos at collapse and then fold in the halo survival probability to later epochs , or ( ii ) the derivative of the ps mass function is employed to get a net formation rate ( formation rate minus destruction rate ) at any redshift . we had employed the sasaki formalism for the ps mass function in paper i and ii .",
    "here we also calculate model predictions using the derivative of the ps mass function to test the sensitivity of the results to the manner of computing the net halo formation rate .",
    "such a comparison is also important as the sasaki formalism is not easily generalizable to other mass functions . for all other halo mass functions one has to simply take recourse to its derivative , to model the net formation rate of halos .",
    "we first show , by comparing the derivatives of all mass functions , that the historically used press - schechter mass function predicts a lower formation rate of rare high mass dark matter halos compared to any other mass function .",
    "however , all other mass functions do not differ significantly in the formation rate of collapsed dark matter halos .",
    "therefore , significant differences can arise in model predictions made using the ps mass function and the other forms of the mass functions considered here .",
    "we show the effect of this difference by ( i ) calculating the reionization history of the universe , ( ii ) fitting the observed uv luminosity functions of high redshift lbgs , and ( iii ) calculating the feedback of star formation on the igm .",
    "the main results of our study are as follows :    * in order to produce a given electron optical depth to the reionization , the efficiency in the star formation and/or in uv escape fraction has to be lower in the models using st and other mass functions obtained from simulations compared to that with the ps mass function .",
    "this decrease has to be much more in the small mass molecular cooled halos if they also contribute to the reionization process . * all new sets of data points , which extend the uv luminosity function of lbgs to the faint end and to higher @xmath22 ,",
    "can be naturally explained in the framework of our earlier models . *",
    "the luminosity function determined using the ps and st mass functions match reasonably at @xmath113 , but they differ more and more strongly as one goes to higher redshifts , and especially at the bright end ( right panel of figure  [ fig_uv_lf ] ) .",
    "this is because as one moves to higher and higher redshifts a given luminosity range is contributed by rarer and rarer objects and the ps mass function predicts a lower net formation rate compared to the st mass function or other mass functions derived from simulations .",
    "the uv luminosity functions determined from all mass functions , other than the ps mass function , agree reasonably with each other .",
    "* we find that the luminosity functions calculated using the derivative of the ps mass function and that obtained from the sasaki formalism , differ negligibly for @xmath87 and by less than @xmath122 for other values of @xmath230 .",
    "* we show , by using @xmath0 minimization technique , that the models with the st halo mass function provide a better fit to the observed uv luminosity functions in the redshift range @xmath231 compared to the models with the ps halo mass function . however , the redshift evolution of the best fit model parameter @xmath134 crucially depends on the data set used , as well as various uncertainties such as k - correction , dependence of dust opacity on the wavelength etc .",
    "* models with different mass functions , using the derivative of the mass functions to calculate the net formation rate of halos , predict very similar ( with in 10% ) volume filling factor for metals in the igm .",
    "however , these models always predict a higher volume filling factor compared to the sasaki formalism of the ps mass function .",
    "therefore , even though the method used to calculate the formation rate of collapsed dark matter halos has only a mild effect on the predictions of high redshift uv luminosity functions , they do predict different outflow feedback to the igm .",
    "different models give similar predictions for other physical parameters associated with outflows and the conclusions of paper ii appear to be largely insensitive to the adopted form of the halo mass function .    the next important step in the development of our models could be to implement it in the framework of a numerical simulation or by generating merger trees .",
    "this will help in unambiguously determining the halo formation rate and its survival probability .",
    "however , as mentioned earlier , one has to resolve the formation of halos right from @xmath3 to @xmath4 in order to model both igm metal enrichment and the galactic luminosity function .",
    "to achieve such a large dynamic range would be a major challenge .",
    "we thank iwata ikuru for kindly providing the data on luminosity function at @xmath232 .",
    "we thank an anonymous referee for useful suggestions and prompting us to do a @xmath0 analysis of the uv luminosity functions .",
    "ss thanks csir , india for the grant award no .",

    "<S> the form of the halo mass function is a basic ingredient in any semi - analytical galaxy formation model . </S>",
    "<S> we study the existing forms of the mass functions in the literature and compare their predictions for semi - analytical galaxy formation models . </S>",
    "<S> two methods are used in the literature to compute the net formation rate of halos , one by simply taking the derivative of the halo mass function and the other using the prescription due to sasaki ( 1994 ) . for the historically used press - schechter ( ps ) mass function </S>",
    "<S> , we compare various model predictions , using these two methods . however , as the sasaki formalism can not be easily generalized for other mass functions , we use the derivative while comparing model predictions of different mass functions . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the reionization history and uv luminosity function of lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) predicted by the ps mass function differs from those using any other existing mass function , like sheth - tormen ( st ) mass function . </S>",
    "<S> in particular the reionization efficiency of molecular cooled halos has to be substantially reduced when one uses the st and other mass functions obtained from the simulation instead of the ps mass function . using @xmath0-minimization </S>",
    "<S> , we find that the observed uv luminosity functions of lbgs at @xmath1 are better reproduced by models using the st mass function compared to models that use the ps mass function . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , the volume filling factor of the metals expelled from the galaxies through supernovae driven outflows differs very little between models with different mass functions . </S>",
    "<S> it depends on the way we treat merging outflows . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that the porosity weighted average quantities related to the outflow are not very sensitive to the differences in the halo mass function .    </S>",
