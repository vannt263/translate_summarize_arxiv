    "more than 20 years ago , v.  i.  arnold @xcite discovered a strange duality among the 14 exceptional unimodal hypersurface singularities .",
    "a beautiful interpretation of this duality was given by h.  pinkham @xcite and independently by i.  v.  dolgachev and v.  v.  nikulin @xcite .",
    "i.  nakamura related this duality to the hirzebruch - zagier duality of cusp singularities @xcite .    in independent work in early 1982 , c.  t.  c.  wall and the author discovered an extension of this duality embracing on one hand series of bimodal singularities and on the other hand , complete intersection surface singularities in @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "we showed that this duality also corresponds to hirzebruch - zagier duality of cusp singularities .",
    "recent work has aroused new interest in arnold s strange duality .",
    "it was observed by several authors ( see @xcite and the references there ) that pinkham s interpretation of arnold s original strange duality can be considered as part of a two - dimensional analogue of the mirror symmetry of families of calabi - yau threefolds .",
    "two years ago , k.  saito @xcite discovered a new feature of arnold s strange duality involving the characteristic polynomials of the monodromy operators of the singularities and he found a connection with the characteristic polynomials of automorphisms of the famous leech lattice . only shortly after , m.  kobayashi @xcite found a duality of the weight systems associated to the 14 exceptional unimodal singularities which corresponds to arnold s strange duality .",
    "he also related it to mirror symmetry .    in this paper",
    "we first review these results .",
    "then we consider our extension of this duality and examine which of the newly discovered features continue to hold .",
    "it turns out that with a suitable construction , pinkham s interpretation can be extended to a larger class of singularities . in this way",
    ", one obtains many new examples of mirror symmetric families of k3 surfaces .",
    "we also associate characteristic polynomials to the singularities involved in our extension of the duality and show that saito s duality continues to hold .",
    "moreover , in this way we can realize further characteristic polynomials of automorphisms of the leech lattice",
    ". the connection with the leech lattice seems to be rather mysterious .",
    "we discuss some facts which might help to understand this connection .",
    "we conclude with some open questions .",
    "we thank the referee for his useful comments .",
    "we first discuss arnold s original strange duality among the 14 exceptional unimodal hypersurface singularities .",
    "we recall dolgachev s construction @xcite ( see also @xcite ) of these singularities .",
    "let @xmath1 be positive integers such that @xmath2 .",
    "consider the upper half plane @xmath3 with the hyperbolic metric @xmath4 and a solid triangle @xmath5 with angles @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 .",
    "let @xmath9 be the subgroup of the group of isometries of @xmath10 generated by the reflections in the edges of @xmath11 , and let @xmath12 be the subgroup of index 2 of orientation preserving isometries",
    ". then @xmath13 and @xmath12 acts linearly on the total space @xmath14 of the tangent bundle on @xmath10 .",
    "the inclusion @xmath15 as zero section determines an inclusion @xmath16 of orbit spaces .",
    "collapsing @xmath17 to a point yields a normal surface singularity @xmath18 .",
    "this singularity is called a _",
    "triangle singularity_. the numbers @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 are called the _ dolgachev numbers _ @xmath22 of the singularity",
    ". the scalar multiplication in the fibres of the tangent bundle @xmath14 induces a good @xmath23-action on @xmath24 . a resolution of the singularity @xmath18 can be obtained by the methods of @xcite . a minimal good resolution",
    "consists of a rational curve of self - intersection number @xmath25 and three rational curves of self - intersection numbers @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 respectively intersecting the exceptional curve transversely .    by @xcite , for exactly 14 triples",
    "@xmath29 the singularity @xmath18 is a hypersurface singularity .",
    "thus it can be given by a function germ @xmath30 where @xmath31 is weighted homogeneous with weights @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 and degree @xmath35 .",
    "the corresponding weighted homogeneous functions , weights and degrees are indicated in table  [ table1 ] .",
    "it turns out that these singularities are unimodal and one gets in this way exactly the 14 exceptional unimodal hypersurface singularities in arnold s classification @xcite .",
    "( the equations in table  [ table1 ] are obtained by setting the module equal to zero . )",
    "special elements of @xmath36 correspond to the deep holes of the leech lattice .",
    "a _ deep hole _ of the leech lattice @xmath37 is a point in @xmath38 which has maximal distance from the lattice points .",
    "it is a beautiful theorem of j.  h.  conway , r.  a.  parker , and n.  j.  a.  sloane ( @xcite , see also @xcite ) that there are 23 types of deep holes in @xmath37 which are in one - to - one correspondence with the 23 isomorphism classes of even unimodular lattices in @xmath38 containing roots , which were classified by h .- v .",
    "niemeier @xcite .",
    "these lattices are characterized by the root systems which they contain .",
    "the frame shape of the coxeter element of such a root system is also the frame shape of an automorphism of the leech lattice .",
    "we have indicated in table  [ table8 ] the type of the root system of the niemeier lattice , if a frame shape corresponds to the coxeter element of such a root system .",
    "the automorphism group @xmath36 of the leech lattice contains the mathieu group @xmath39 ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "s.  mukai @xcite has classified the finite automorphism groups of k3 surfaces ( automorphisms which leave the symplectic form invariant ) and shown that they admit a certain embedding into the mathieu group @xmath39 .",
    "he gives a list of 11 maximal groups such that every finite automorphism group imbeds into one of these groups .",
    "a table of the centralizers of the conjugacy classes of @xmath36 can be found in @xcite .",
    "for an element @xmath40 , denote its centralizer by @xmath41 and the finite cyclic group generated by @xmath42 by @xmath43 .",
    "we have marked by ( @xmath44 ) in table  [ table8 ] the cases where there is an obvious inclusion of @xmath45 in one of mukai s groups .",
    "it follows that in these cases there is a k3 surface with an operation of @xmath45 on it by symplectic automorphisms .    to a frame shape @xmath46",
    "one can associate a modular function @xcite .",
    "let @xmath47 be the dedekind @xmath48-function . then define @xmath49 saito @xcite has proved the identity @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 is the dual frame shape . from this",
    "it follows that @xmath53 is a modular function for the group @xmath54      the frame shape @xmath55 is the frame shape of the operator @xmath56 which can be considered as an automorphism of a sublattice of finite index of the even unimodular 24-dimensional lattice @xmath57 , which is the full homology lattice of a k3 surface .",
    "the lattice @xmath57 has the same rank as the leech lattice , but contrary to the leech lattice it is indefinite and has signature @xmath58 .          by a computer search ,",
    "one finds for @xmath70 in addition to the 22 frame shapes of table  [ table8 ] only the following frame shapes : @xmath71 these frame shapes also appear in kondo s tables , namely in the tables of certain transforms of the frame shapes of @xmath36 ( * ? ? ?",
