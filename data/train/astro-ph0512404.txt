    "recent surveys in the uv and ir @xcite have highlighted the importance of low - metallicity galaxies for the investigation of vigourous episodes of star formation .",
    "in particular , nearby blue compact dwarf ( bcd ) galaxies provide evidence that isolated , small , low - metallicity galaxies may experience high star formation levels in the present epoch @xcite .",
    "since the advent of _ iso _ it has been known that very low metallicity ( @xmath1 @xmath2 1 ) galaxies show very little in the way of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbonate ( pah ) @xcite emission in the mid - ir @xcite .",
    "pah emission is thought to be linked to star forming activity @xcite - uv photons from massive young stars excite the pah carriers , and therefore trace the extent of star formation .",
    "low pah luminosity in strongly star forming galaxies is contrary to what has been seen previously by _ iso _",
    "surveys - in starbursts , ubiquitous strong pah emission was detected ( see review by genzel & cesarsky 2000 ) .",
    "however from _ iso _ data it has been tentatively noted that as the metallicity of the galaxy increases , so too does the strength of the pah emission @xcite .",
    "this begs the question - what causes the pah emission deficiency in low - metallicity galaxies ?",
    "is it a case of pah carriers being destroyed or is the pah deficiency intrinsic ?",
    "hirashita et al .",
    "( 2002 ) note that dust destruction is the dominant ism process when the metallicity of a low metallicity galaxy such as blue compact dwarfs ( bcds ) reaches 12 + log ( o / h ) @xmath3 @xmath48 .",
    "furthermore , recent work by @xcite suggest that the small size of ism grains emitting in the mid and far - ir may be due to destruction by shock waves from supernovae ( sn ) in these galaxies . in low - metallicity galaxies ,",
    "star formation is dominated by massive stars ( m@xmath5 @xmath6 35m@xmath7 ) and high sn rates are expected in galaxies experiencing very recent massive star formation @xcite . an extremely high sn rate and/or extremely energetic sn ( with up to 10@xmath8 ergs being released into the ism @xcite ) from very massive stars could very well be responsible for the lack of pah in low - metallicity galaxies . in this scenario ,",
    "strong sn shocks propagating into the ism may be the culprit responsible for the pah deficiency .    in order to investigate this question ,",
    "a tracer of sn activity is required .",
    "the mid - ir [ feii ] lines offer an ideal extinction - insensitive tool to probe the sn activity in actively star forming galaxies .",
    "iron is an abundant refractory element ; however it is highly depleted from the gas phase of the interstellar medium in galaxies as a result of condensation onto dust grains ( e.g. , de boer , jura & shull 1987 ) .",
    "forbidden line emission from low ionization states of fe is greatly enhanced behind hydrodynamic shock fronts where grain processing can result in near solar gas phase fe abundances .",
    "the near - infrared [ feii ] lines at 1.257 @xmath0 m and 1.644 @xmath0 m have been widely used to trace the sn content in galaxies ( e.g. , greenhouse et al .",
    "1991 , 1997 ; calzetti 1997 ) . likewise , the @xmath9(7/2 - 9/2 ) transition of [ feii ] near 26 @xmath0 m can also be used as a relatively pure tracer of sn activity .",
    "the low excitation potential corresponding to the transition ( 550 k ) may in fact imply that emission from the mid - ir lines is longer lasting than emission from the higher excitation potential near - ir lines , which are thought to persist only up to 10@xmath10 years @xcite after a sn explosion .",
    "this feature , coupled with emission from [ neii ] at 12.8 @xmath0 m which traces emission from very massive young stars , could be used to determine the sn shock emission relative to the present ionizing photon production rate .",
    "[ neii ] is a robust indicator of the ionizing photon rate in dust - enshrouded starburst galaxies . for galaxies dominated by typical stellar uv fields",
    ", a simple linear proportionality between the [ neii ] luminosity and the lyman continuum luminosity is expected from photoionization models @xcite .",
    "measurements of the [ feii]/[neii ] emission line ratio in starburst galaxies could thus provide a sensitive measure of the supernova content of galaxies @xcite and hence an estimate of the degree of grain processing and destruction .",
    "furthermore , an increased sn rate or shock wave intensity , indicated by a higher [ feii]/[neii ] would be highly suggestive that in low metallicity galaxies destruction by sn shocks is responsible for the absence of pahs .    given the availability of high spatial and spectral resolution data in the mid - ir from _",
    "spitzer _ of nuclear regions of starbursts ( where massive stars are located ) , we can search for [ feii ] emission from nearby starbursts , and compare the [ feii]/[neii ] ratio as a function the strength of the pah emission to see if any correlation exists . such a diagnostic , using data from galaxies of known metallicity , will us to determine whether sn driven shocks play an important role in the pah emission deficit in low - metallicity galaxies .",
    "a total of 18 starburst galaxies of known metallicity from optical studies ( see references in table 1 for sources ) were selected from the _ spitzer _ archive to form the core sample .",
    "the full list of targets is given in table 1 , and are listed in terms of increasing metallicity .",
    "these galaxies range in metallicity from extremely low ( such as i zw 18 , with @xmath11= 1/50 ) to super - solar metallicity ( @xmath12 ) galaxies such as m 82 and ngc 7714 .",
    "to differentiate between low and high - metallicity galaxies , we use a metallicity ( 12 + log ( o / h ) ) cut - off value of 8.85 - just less than solar , with the majority of the low - metallicity galaxies having values less than 8.3 .",
    "the galaxies range widely in morphology from blue compact dwarfs such as i zw 18 to spirals such as ngc 7714 and ic 342 .",
    "none of the galaxies in our sample are known to harbour agn .",
    "this is important , as pah destruction can occur close to an agn due to the hard ionization environment @xcite .",
    "in addition [ feii ] emission can be elevated in galaxies harbouring agn ( e.g. sturm et al . 2000 ) .",
    "one possible exception is ngc 7714 , which is optically classified as a liner @xcite .",
    "however , the lack of [ nev ] emission at 14 and 24 @xmath0 m and the absence of any evidence for an obscured agn by recent chandra imaging @xcite strongly suggests that ngc 7714 is a pure starburst and it is therefore included in our sample .",
    "most of the targets are nearby , with only mrk 25 ( 42.1 mpc ) , mrk 930 ( 77.3 mpc ) and um 448 ( 78.4 mpc ) greater than 40 mpc away ( assuming a value of @xmath13 = 71 km / s / mpc ) , allowing detections of the comparatively weak [ feii ] emission .",
    "we extracted low and high resolution archival spectral data from the short - low ( sl ) ( 5.2 - 14.5 @xmath0 m ) , short - high ( sh ) ( 9.9 - 19.6 @xmath0 m ) and long - high ( lh ) ( 18.7 - 37.2 @xmath0 m ) modules of the _ spitzer _ infrared spectrograph ( irs ) .",
    "the datasets were derived from a number of _ spitzer _ legacy and guaranteed time observation programs released to the _ spitzer _ data archive , and consisted of either spectral mapping or staring observations .",
    "we obtained fluxes for the nuclear positions only from the mapping observations .",
    "all the staring observations were centered on the galaxy s nucleus .",
    "the data were preprocessed by the _ spitzer _ science center ( ssc ) data reduction pipeline version 12.0 before being downloaded .",
    "further processing was done within the idl based irs data reduction and analysis package _",
    "smart _ , v 5.5.2 @xcite .",
    "the high - resolution spectra were extracted using the full - aperture extraction method along the diffraction orders .",
    "for the low - resolution spectra , the spectra were extracted using the interactive column extraction option which is similar to the method used in the ssc pipeline , and allowed for definition of a source as well as a manual definition of the background .",
    "for both high and low resolution spectra , the ends of each order where the noise increases significantly were manually clipped , as were hot pixels .",
    "fluxes were extracted for the emission lines [ neii ] at 12.8 @xmath0 m and [ feii ] at 26 @xmath0 m using the smart interactive line - fitting tool , along with the 7.7 @xmath0 m pah feature .",
    "the 7.7 @xmath0 m pah strength was determined according to the prescription adopted in a number of previous studies @xcite . here , the continuum was determined at the center of the 7.7 @xmath0 m feature , with the continuum determined using a first order linear fit to the 5.9 and 9.5 @xmath0 m bandpass .",
    "the pah strength was then calculated as the ratio of the 7.7 @xmath0 m feature peak intensity to the underlying continuum .",
    "the silicate absorption feature at 9.7 @xmath0 m was not prominent in any of our spectra .",
    "we therefore do not consider it to significantly affect the strength of the 7.7 @xmath0 m pah feature .",
    "the use of 3 separate apertures for the sl , sh and lh modules raises the issue of aperture effects on the extracted fluxes , and by extension , any derived correlations .",
    "nuclear star formation , responsible for the bulk of the pah emission and mid - ir continuum in the vast majority of galaxies , originates from the central few hundred parsecs ( e.g. surace & sanders 1999 ; scoville et al .",
    "2000 , satyapal et al .",
    "however given the different morphologies and physical scales within the sample , it is quite plausible that for some of our sample at least , ir emission and associated star formation extends further than the central few hundred parsecs and thus a larger proportion of the mir and fir emission may fall outside the irs aperture beams .    in order to determine if aperture corrections are required , we used mips 70 @xmath0 m images to trace the spatial extent of the fir emission . if the fir was not contained within the long - hi slit ( covering roughly the central kiloparsec ) , we considered the source to be extended , otherwise the source was considered compact . for 66 % of the sample ( all of the low metallicity and one of the high metallicity galaxies ) , the fir emission is fully contained within the irs aperture beams and for these galaxies aperture corrections are not likely to be significant . for the remaining galaxies , a quick inspection of the mips 70 micron images",
    "reveal that the fir is more extended than the irs aperture . in sect .",
    "3.1.1 , we discuss the possible impact of the resulting aperture variations on our results .",
    "in order to investigate how the strength of sn shocks relative to the massive star population varies with the strength of the pah emission , we plot the [ feii]/[neii ] emission line ratio versus the 7.7 @xmath0 m pah peak to continuum ratio for each galaxy in fig .",
    "it is immediately apparent that a strong correlation exists between the [ feii]/[neii ] ratio and the pah strength - as the pah strength increases , the [ feii]/[neii ] ratio drops .",
    "interestingly , a clear divide exists between low and high metallicity galaxies on the plot . employing a spearman rank correlation analysis @xcite to assess the statistical significance of this trend yields a correlation coefficient ( r@xmath14 ) of -0.870 between [ feii]/[neii ] and the pah strength with a probability of chance correlation ( p@xmath14 ) of 2.73 x 10@xmath15 , indicating a significant anti - correlation .",
    "the spearman rank correlation technique has the advantage of being non - parametric , robust to outliers and does not presuppose a linear relation .    since the pah strength can also be dependent on the strength of the mid - ir dust continuum , we can attempt to decouple this effect by plotting the [ feii]/[neii ] ratio versus the ratio of the 7.7 @xmath0 m pah feature luminosity and the total ir luminosity ( fig .",
    "2 ) , which also includes emission from much larger dust grains .",
    "although the iras aperture is larger than those on irs , it has been widely demonstrated that the 12 to 100 @xmath0 m fluxes in star forming galaxies are dominated by emission from the nuclear regions of the galaxy that also give rise to the pah emission @xcite .",
    "a preliminary analysis of the 70 @xmath0 m mips images of our sample of galaxies shows that for 6 of the 7 high metallicity starbursts included in fig .",
    "2 ( m82 , ngc 7714 , ngc 3049 , ngc 1482 , ngc 253 , and ngc 2903 ) , the fir emission is more extended than the irs aperture through which the pah emission is measured . since these aperture variations can potentially result in systematic errors in the pah / fir flux ratio , we have distinguished extended sources from compact sources in fig .",
    "2 . using the spearman rank correlation technique again , a similar but weaker ( r@xmath14 = -0.738 ; p@xmath14 = 4.73 x 10@xmath16 ) , correlation is found .",
    "both plots confirm that a strong relationship exists between the pah strength and the strength of the [ feii]/[neii ] ratio .",
    "the mips images of our sample of galaxies will be discussed in a follow up work .      since it has been previously suggested from _",
    "imaging and isocam - cvf spectra @xcite that pah emission also varies with metallicity , we can also explore whether the [ feii]/[neii ] ratio varies in a similar fashion , given the link between pah emission and the [ feii]/[neii ] emission as seen in fig .",
    "1 . in fig .  3 , we see a strong anti - correlation ( r@xmath14 = -0.856 ; p@xmath14 = 5.96 x 10@xmath15 ) , with the [ feii]/[neii ] ratio dropping with increasing metallicity .",
    "again as in fig . 1 , we see a clear separation in the [ feii]/[neii ] ratio between galaxies of low and high metallicity .",
    "we must state that the correlations we see here are derived from compact starburst regions , and we must be careful in extrapolating this result to suggest that there is a global lack of pahs in low - metallicity galaxies .",
    "quiescent dwarf galaxies , which are not currently undergoing strong star formation or numerous sn events , may exhibit stronger pah emission than that seen in the starburst dwarf galaxies in our sample .",
    "for quiescent dwarfs , diffuse star formation provides a mechanism for the excitation of the pah carriers , excited through extended low level star formation and by lower mass stars from earlier bursts . in support of this , using fluxes from irac and mips imaging @xcite note a large scatter of pah emission to 24 @xmath0 m continuum ratios for a number of dwarf galaxies , suggesting that a contribution is made to the overall pah emission from quiescent regions outside the nuclear starburst regions , and would enhance pah emission even within low metallicity galaxies .",
    "uv radiation from the massive o star population may play an important role in pah destruction in low metallicity galaxies due to the hard ionizing radiation field surrounding these stars @xcite . in fig .  4",
    ", we plot the [ neiii ] 15.5 @xmath0 m /[neii ] 12.8 @xmath0 m ratio versus the pah strength for our sample .",
    "the [ neiii]/[neii ] ratio is a robust extinction and abundance - insensitive indicator of the hardness of the radiation field surrounding massive young stars @xcite .",
    "although fig .  4 shows a significant correlation ( r@xmath14 = -0.612 ; p@xmath14= 6.88 x 10@xmath17 ) , there is considerable scatter and the correlation is weaker than the correlation displayed in fig .  1 .",
    "this correlation confirms a similar diagnostic presented in @xcite for a range of objects of varying morphology and spatial scale that include hii regions , spiral , starburst and dwarf galaxies .    the strength of the correlation in fig .  4 in relation to that in fig .",
    "1 suggests that pah destruction by sn - driven shocks likely plays a more pronounced role than grain destruction from uv radiation within hii regions .",
    "indeed , there is observational precedence for suggesting that sn - driven shocks play a pivotal role in the destruction of pahs .",
    "using isocam - cvf spectra , @xcite do not detect pah emission within either ionic or molecular shocks in a number of galactic supernova remnants 3c 391 , despite strong pah features detected in the spectra of the pre - shock region and also in nearby regions not affected by the sn remnant .",
    "furthermore , the shocked emission shows no significant continuum rise at mid - ir wavelengths .",
    "this rise is normally seen in interstellar dust spectra , including those of quiescent regions , such as reflection nebulae and have been attributed to the presence of very small dust grains ( vsgs ) @xcite .",
    "the lack of pah emission within shocked regions has also been noted in other galactic sn remnants such as g11.2 - 0.3 and kes 69 , based on irac colour ratios @xcite .",
    "the lack of aromatic features or rising continuum in the mid - ir spectrum of 3c 391 suggests that both the pah carriers and vsgs are destroyed by sn shocks .",
    "the lack of pah in our sample of low metallicity galaxies , plus a lack of rising mid - ir continua for the low metallicity sample suggests very strongly that sn shocks play a dominant role in the pah emission deficit in these objects , and indeed for the state of the ism as a whole .    in order to further clarify and disentangle the contributions that uv radiation surrounding young stars and sn shocks play in the destruction of pah carriers and in the evolution of the ism in low - metallicity galaxies , a follow - up high - resolution",
    "spectral mapping survey of low - metallicity galaxies using irs is critical .",
    "such a high spatial resolution spectroscopic survey will provide further insight into the physics of grain and aromatic feature destruction in high ionization starburst and shock front environments .",
    "an alternate scenario for the low pah emission in low metallicity galaxies is that due to the extreme youth of these galaxies , not enough time has elapsed for stars below 8 m@xmath7 to move off the ms to become asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars .",
    "these evolved objects are considered to be the primary source for pahs @xcite .",
    "an agb star consists of a degenerate c / o core surrounded by a very extended convective atmosphere , from which mass is lost via a dense and dusty outflow at rates of 10@xmath18 to 10@xmath16 m@xmath7 yr@xmath19 and at expansion velocities of 5 - 30 km s@xmath19 @xcite .",
    "pah carriers from agb stars take @xmath4200 myr to be injected into the ism , when @xmath44 m@xmath7 stars evolve off the ms @xcite , thus requiring several generations of star formation to enrich the ism with pah carriers .",
    "however , agb stars have been detected even in the lowest known metallicity galaxy , i zw 18 @xcite , and the age of the agb population ( @xmath4500 myr ) is more than long enough for injection of pahs into the ism , and for the ism to become pah enriched .",
    "however , modeling by @xcite suggests that despite the presence of agb stars , a timescale of up to 1 gyr is required to enrich the ism with pah to the level we see in higher metallicity galaxies .",
    "nevertheless the presence of agb stars plus the expected level of pah enrichment after 500 myr ( from the models of morgan and edmunds ( 2003 ) ) , indicate that we should see higher pah emission than has been detected in low - metallicity galaxies such as i zw 18 .",
    "given the high [ feii]/[neii ] ratios for low - metallicity galaxies , it would be plausible to suggest that shocks from sn further depress pah emission in these galaxies through destruction of the pah carriers .",
    "such a scenario may help to explain the lack of pah emission even in galaxies with advanced agb populations .",
    "the lack of pah emission within sn shocks such as those within the galactic sn remnant 3c 391 @xcite would strongly enhance the plausibility of this scenario .      from discussions of the evolution of fine structure line ratios in sect .",
    "3.1 and 3.2.1 , we note that the decrease in the strength of the fine structure line ratios with higher metallicity is consistent with the hardness of the ionizing radiation in the starburst increasing with decreasing metallicity @xcite .",
    "it has been suggested that the formation of massive stars is directly related to lower metallicities within the ism , with a larger jeans mass being formed due to a drop in the cooling efficiency of the primordial gas @xcite leading to a higher ionization environment within the starburst regions .",
    "given the proclivity for such low - metallicity objects to produce such massive stars , it would be interesting to determine if the decrease in the [ neiii]/[neii ] ratio with higher metallicity is indicative of a variation in the upper mass limit of the initial mass function ( imf ) with increasing metallicity .",
    "theoretical studies predict that the production of very massive stars in high metallicity galaxies is suppressed through feedback from previous stellar generations @xcite .",
    "the drop in the [ neiii]/[neii ] ratio with increasing metallicity and pah strength would suggest a lack of very massive stars ( with initial masses greater than 40 m@xmath7 ) being formed and going onto produce supernovae as the ism evolves through feedback from earlier generations .",
    "in support of this scenario , photoionization work by @xcite and @xcite attribute low excitation ratio values to high - mass , solar - metallicity starbursts forming fewer massive stars through feedback into the ism .",
    "however , since the [ neiii]/[neii ] ratio is dependent on both the upper mass cutoff ( m@xmath20 ) and the age of the stellar population ( e.g. @xcite ) , it is difficult to decouple one effect from the other .",
    "further detailed modeling using stellar population synthesis codes coupled with photoionization codes using a large number of line diagnostics could help constrain m@xmath20 .",
    "using archival spectral data from _ spitzer _ , we undertook a survey of 18 starburst galaxies in order to determine whether sn shocks are responsible for the pah deficiency in low - metallicity galaxies . using the emission line ratio of [ feii ] at 26 @xmath0 m to [ neii ] at 12.8 @xmath0 m plotted against the pah strength",
    ", we found a strong anti - correlation , with the [ feii]/[neii ] ratio decreasing with increasing pah emission .",
    "similar correlations were found when comparing the [ feii]/[neii ] ratio to the pah / ir luminosities and metallicity . since [ feii ]",
    "emission has been linked primarily to sn shocks , we attribute the high [ feii]/[neii ] ratios in low - metallicity galaxies to enhanced sn activity , and consider this to be the dominant mechanism for pah destruction , rather than grain destruction in photoionized regions surrounding young massive stars .",
    "we also consider whether the extreme youth of the low - metallicity galaxies is responsible for the lack of pah emission . while the age of the known agb populations in our low - metallicity sample galaxies is less than the time required for full pah enrichment of the ism , we argue that sn shocks ( as evidenced by from the high [ feii]/[neii ] ratios and sn rates ) further depress the pah emission .",
    "we conclude that while sn shock destruction of the pah carriers may not be fully responsible for the lack of pah emission , it remains a prime culprit for the lack of pah emission in low metallicity galaxies .",
