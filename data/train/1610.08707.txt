    "investigation of the essence and mechanism of the acceleration of our universe in the last decade , confirmed by some observational data on the account of supernova type ia ( sne ia ) @xcite , cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmb)@xcite , large - scale structure of the universe @xcite , baryon acoustic oscillations @xcite , weak lensing @xcite , have lionized with cosmologists .",
    "there are two solutions for the elucidation for this problem ; dark energy with negative pressure , understanding the nature of which , is one of the main problems in the research area , and the extended gravity ( modified gravity ) which has been a competitive alternative to the dark energy scenario .",
    "one of the routes to extend gravitational theories is teleparallel gravity ( tg ) where , the torsion scalar @xmath0 which consisting of the weitzenbck connection , describes the action @xcite .",
    "tg is demonstrably equivalent to general relativity @xcite and enables one to say that gravity is not due to curvature , but the torsion .",
    "@xmath1 gravity , a generalized version of the so - called tg ( proposed originally by einstein @xcite ) , is easier to work with than @xmath2 to analyze the cosmological evolution .",
    "this stems for the order of gravitational field equation which is two in the former one and four in the latter one .",
    "@xmath1 gravity which provides alternative interpretations for the accelerating phases of the universe @xcite , has interesting cosmological solutions .",
    "the symmetries of mechanical and physical systems have intimate connections with the associated conserved quantities .",
    "one of the methods for seeking the conserved quantities of the mechanical and physical systems is the noether symmetry which is one of the most beautiful fruits of the calculus of variations .",
    "noether theorem allows one to derive conserved quantities from the presence of variational symmetries @xcite .",
    "however , some hidden conserved currents may not be obtained by @xcite .",
    "the existence of noether symmetry assures the presence of cyclic variables by a coordinate transformation such that the lagrangian becomes cyclic in one of them .",
    "these new variables make the field equations to be easy solving . on the other hand ,",
    "there are cases that we have no solution with this approach . the new approach , recently proposed by the author as `` b.n.s . ''",
    "approach may solve this problem @xcite .",
    "usually , the problem occurs in two places ; first , when we match all conserved currents with field equations which is discussed with details in ref .",
    "@xcite , and second , when we use cyclic variables having no more conserved currents . in this paper",
    ", we shall see that when cyclic variables approach is used for solving field equations we encounter a strange result .",
    "so , by shifting to b.n.s .",
    "approach problem is solved .",
    "these solutions may carry noether currents as well .",
    "generally speaking , the universe as confirmed by cmb temperature is anisotropic , but we premise it to be isotropic at large scales .",
    "one of the models that may describe such background is bianchi type i model in which each direction has own scale factor @xcite . in this paper , we have studied our model in a special bianchi type i which was named as locally rotationally symmetric bianchi type i ( lrs bi ) where two of three spatial directions have the same scale factor . in such background",
    "we have considered @xmath1 model , containing a coupling between scaler field potential and magnetism in particular .",
    "there are several fields such as the vector fields and the nonlinear electromagnetic fields that able to produce the negative pressure effects . in this paper",
    "the action under consideration is that of ref .",
    "@xcite which is comprised of four parts",
    ". one of which is the magnetism part coupled with a function of scalar field .",
    "the motivation of this letter is whether such action can describe acceleration era in a homogeneous and anisotropic background or not .",
    "we start with the following gravitational action @xcite [ action ] s = d^4x e where @xmath3 det@xmath4 with @xmath5 being a vierbein ( tetrad ) basis , @xmath0 is the torsion scalar , @xmath6 stands for the components of the gradient of @xmath7 which we assume it to be dependent on time only and @xmath8 is the scalar potential .",
    "the strength tensor is expressed as @xmath9 and @xmath10 is the coupling function between scalar and vector fields .",
    "the lrs bi universe model is given by [ metric ] ds^2 = dt^2 - a^2(t ) dx^2 - b^2(t ) , here the metric potentials @xmath11 and @xmath12 are functions of time alone . according to this metric",
    ", we introduce a homogeneous and anisotropic vector field as a(t ) = ( ( t ) , 0 , , ) whence we get f _",
    "f^ = the torsion scalar for the metric ( [ metric ] ) can be found as t = - 2 ( 2 + ) in which the dot denotes a derivative with respect to time .",
    "the lagrangian density corresponding to action ( [ action ] ) takes the form [ point - like ] l = -2 b - a ^2 - a b^2 ^2 - a b^2 v + a f^2 ^2 therefore , the euler - lagrange equations for the scale factors @xmath11 and @xmath12 become [ fe a ] 2 + = - + v , [ fe b ] + + = + v. for the vector @xmath13 , and scalar field @xmath7 , the euler - lagrange equations take the following forms [ fe a ] + ( + 2 ) = 0 , [ fe phi ] + ( + 2 ) = + v^ , where the latter one is the klein - gordon equation and the prime indicates a derivative with respect to @xmath7 .",
    "the energy function , @xmath14 associated with ( [ point - like ] ) becomes [ fe e ] -2 - + ^2 + + v = 0 .",
    "in this section we want to use noether approach for solving eqs .",
    "( [ fe a])-([fe e ] ) .",
    "the configuration space and tangent space for the point - like lagrangian ( [ point - like ] ) are @xmath15 and @xmath16 respectively .",
    "hence the infinitesimal generator of the noether symmetry is [ generator ] * x * = + + + + _ , t + _ , t + _ , t + _ , t , where y = y ( a , b , , a ) y_,t = + + + ; y \\ { , , , } . the existence of noether symmetry implies the existence of a vector field * x * such that the lie derivative of the lagrangian with respect to the vector field vanishes , @xmath17 , [ condition . ] _ * x",
    "* l = 0 + + + + _ , t + _ , t + _ , t + _ , t = 0 .",
    "this yields an expression which is of second degree in @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath7 and @xmath13 and whose coefficients are functions of @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath7 and @xmath13 only . thus to satisfy equation ( [ condition . ] ) , we obtain the following set of equations    & = 0 , + 2 a + 2 b = 0 , b+2ab+2a=0 , f+2a f^+2af = 0 , + & + b ( + ) = 0 , ab + 2=0 , ab^2 + 2a + 2b = 0 , -b^2 + f^2 = 0 , + & af^2 - 2b = 0 , af^2 -2a -2b = 0 , ( 2a+b ) v+bav^=0 .    solving this system of partial differential equations lead to the following solutions [ sol 1 ]    = -2c_1a , = c_1b , & = 0 , = c_1a + c_2 , + f= & , v=.    as we observe , noether approach can not give the forms of unknown functions in this case .",
    "symmetry generators , @xmath18 , on tangent space turn out to be * x*_1=-2a+b+a , * x*_2=. according to noether theorem , if @xmath19 , then the function @xmath20 is a constant of motion .",
    "so we have @xmath21 @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are arbitrary constants .",
    "we add ( [ cons.1 ] ) and ( [ cons.2 ] ) to the set of eq.s ( [ fe a])-([fe e ] ) and solve this system .",
    "we used cyclic variables approach for solving but it produced a constant vector field which does not make sense for the action ( [ action ] ) .",
    "this is compelling to use b.n.s .",
    "approach where without any loss of generality , we do the maps as follows [ map 1 ]    \\ {    ll i : & +   + ii : &    .",
    "therefore , we have [ map 2 ]    \\ {    ll i : & +   + ii : &    .     and @xmath25 versus time @xmath26 respectively at the time range [ 6 , 14].,title=\"fig:\",width=7,height=3 ] +    substituting eqs .",
    "( [ map 1 ] ) and ( [ map 2 ] ) in eqs .",
    "( [ fe a])-([fe e ] ) and ( [ cons.1])-([cons.2 ] ) , we obtain a modified system of differential equations .",
    "one solution for this system is    [ sol fe ] a(t ) & = a_0 e^k_1 t^2 , b(t)=b_0 t^2 , a(t)= , +   + f(t ) & = , v(t)= +   + ( t)&= ( ) dt + & = + - ( )    limpidly , doing an inverse map for reaching at the usual form of unknown functions ( @xmath17 depending on @xmath7 ) in this case is challenging , so we shall do it numerically .",
    "hamiltonian constraints , @xmath27 ( eq . [ fe e ] ) , @xmath28 ( eq . [ cons.1 ] ) and @xmath29 ( eq . [ cons.2 ] ) are three conserved currents carried by this set of solution .",
    "they correspond to @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 respectively .",
    "we present three figures to demonstrate the results obtained through the following choices for constants of integration @xmath33     versus time @xmath26 at the time range [ 6 , 14 ] and plot ( b ) shows @xmath34 parameters ( state finders).,title=\"fig:\",width=7,height=2 ] +     diagnostic versus redshift @xmath35 at the redshift range [ 0.001,1].,title=\"fig:\",width=3,height=2 ] +    and discuss cosmological behavior of lrs bi universe model .",
    "we use the time unit @xmath36 in plotting .",
    "regarding our aim @xmath17 accelerated era only , we present plots at the time range @xmath37 $ ] . + figures [ fig1](a ) and [ fig1](b ) indicate the scale factors with increasing nature expressing the accelerated expansion of the universe .",
    "however as is clear in ( [ sol fe ] ) @xmath38 grows faster than @xmath25 because of @xmath39 .",
    "present amounts of both scale factors are one , as we expected . +     and coupling function @xmath10 versus scalar field @xmath7 respectively.,title=\"fig:\",width=7,height=2 ] +     and coupling function @xmath10 versus time @xmath26 respectively.,title=\"fig:\",width=7,height=2 ] +    for lrs bi , the mean hubble parameter is given by @xmath40 which , in present case , takes the form [ hub . ] h=+ .",
    "the deceleration parameter is @xmath41 which acts as a tool to determine the nature of cosmic expansion ; @xmath17 for @xmath42 and @xmath43 we have decelerated and accelerated expansion respectively .",
    "regarding ( [ hub . ] ) , it takes the following form [ q ] q= -    the @xmath34 parameters are the state finders that help to check the correspondence of constructed models with the standard universe models .",
    "the value of @xmath44 represents correspondence of the constructed model with standard @xmath45cdm universe model .",
    "these are defined in terms of deceleration and hubble parameters as @xcite @xmath46 so , according to ( [ hub . ] ) and ( [ q ] ) , in this case , become @xmath47    the @xmath48 is another diagnostic of dark energy proposed by sahni et al . @xcite .",
    "the @xmath49 analysis have been applied to several models @xcite .",
    "it is defined as om(z ) = where @xmath50 is the present value of hubble parameter . in our anisotropic metric , the redshift @xmath35 is given by z= -1 where @xmath51 .",
    "+ figure [ fig2 ] ( a ) indicates negative behavior of deceleration parameter implying an accelerating universe at the last half age of universe . also it is close to @xmath52 at present time .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] ( b ) shows that the trajectory passes through a point @xmath53 , which indicates a close correspondence with the @xmath45cdm universe model . according to the figure [ fig5 ] we are in phantom phase because of @xmath54 .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] ( a ) presents a subtractive behavior of scalar potential @xmath8 versus scalar field @xmath7 .",
    "moreover , the coupling function @xmath10 have detractive behavior versus scalar field @xmath7 , too ( see figure [ fig3 ] ( b ) ) .",
    "and figures [ fig4 ] ( a ) and [ fig4 ] ( b ) indicate that both scalar potential and coupling function go down versus time which is physically meaningful",
    ". the scalar potential will be constant and the coupling function will vanish in future due to @xmath55 from ( [ sol fe ] ) and ( [ selections for constants ] ) .",
    "+ finally , i would like to compare our results with @xmath2 version of action ( [ action ] ) and give a brief comment on ref .",
    "+ it is worth to note that unlike our case ( @xmath1 version ) , the behaviors of scalar potential and coupling function versus time in @xmath2 version of the action ( [ action ] ) are increasing which is not appreciable ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "however , some things are uncomforting in that reference ; adopted vector field is not true , because the first component of the vector field which was taken to be zero may be allowed to take a non - zero variable , moreover , the choice of the last component of vector field being the only non - trivial component violates the cosmological principle on which their metric is based .",
    "also the implemented time unit is the same , but one of their scale factors is high at @xmath56 and one is constant that are not admissible .",
    "this comparison and discussions which mentioned in ref .",
    "@xcite imply that the @xmath1 version of the action ( [ action ] ) which was investigated in this paper and ref .",
    "@xcite , works better than @xmath2 version surveyed in refs . @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we studied an action in teleparallel gravity , which introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite , in the homogeneous and anisotropic ( lrs bi ) background geometry via noether symmetry approach and showed that by the use of cyclic variables we have no consistent solution with the action ( [ action ] ) , for it produced constant vector field .",
    "then , by keeping noether currents , we proceeded with b.n.s .",
    "data analysis of the results obtained via this new approach could illustrate exactly the last half of cosmic evolution .",
    "these results witnessed that both scale factors have increasing nature and both are close to @xmath57 at the present time ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "the amount of deceleration parameter , @xmath58 , is negative throughout this era indicating the accelerating behavior of the universe and is close to minus one at the present time .",
    "the resulting model , regarding the amount of state finders , have a close correspondence with the @xmath45cdm universe model .",
    "pursuant to the @xmath48 diagnostic we learned that our universe is in phantom phase .",
    "we found that the scalar potential @xmath8 and coupling function @xmath10 in this model have detractive behaviors versus time that is physical . limiting @xmath10 and @xmath8 in infinite time give zero and non zero constants ( @xmath59 ) respectively , so this model in anisotropic metric predicts that we will have constant scalar potential in the future and @xmath10 will vanish for its plummeting nature .",
    "according to the results of this paper and ref .",
    "@xcite , altogether , it seems that @xmath1 version of the action ( [ action ] ) works better than @xmath2 version .",
    "however , in frw spacetime , both versions of the action ( [ action ] ) provide the same field equations .",
