    "is the most distant quasar discovered in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , @xcite ) , and remains among the most distant known .",
    "it is a radio quiet quasar @xcite with an estimated supermassive black hole mass of @xmath12 accreting at the eddington limit , as found from emission lines @xcite .",
    "optical spectra of the source show a saturated gunn  peterson trough due to a partially neutral intergalactic medium , providing some of the first evidence from the earliest epochs of galaxy formation and cosmic reionization at @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "j@xmath3 was the first @xmath13 quasar to be detected as a hyperluminous infrared galaxy ( hylirg ) ( infrared luminosity @xmath14 l@xmath15 , ) through millimetre bolometer observations .",
    "it also remains the most distant detection of molecular gas to date , with multiple detections of co rotational transition lines from @xmath16 up to @xmath5 and the possible detection of the co ( @xmath17 ) transition @xcite .",
    "these revealed a massive molecular gas reservoir of @xmath18 centred on the active galactic nucleus ( agn ) and extended on scales of 5 kpc @xcite .",
    "observations trace a bright @xmath19 kpc atomic gas region with active star formation apparently taking place at an estimated star - formation rate ( sfr ) surface density of @xmath20 yr@xmath21 kpc@xmath22 @xcite . based on , suggest the presence of a high velocity complex outflow extending to projected radii of @xmath23 kpc .",
    "j@xmath3 has a far - infrared ( fir ) luminosity of @xmath24 @xcite , corresponding to thermal emission from @xmath25 of warm dust @xcite .",
    "j@xmath3 has served as the archetype for extreme starburst - agn at high redshifts , representing the early , coeval formation of supermassive black holes and their stellar host galaxies during the epoch of reionization .    in this paper , we present observations with the karl g. jansky very large array ( vla ) of the co ( @xmath0 ) line emission in j1148 + 5251 .",
    "these observations have a number of significant advantages over the previous vla observations .",
    "low order co transitions are critical to constrain the total molecular gas mass in galaxies , and in particular , to look for massive reservoirs of cold gas fuelling star formation @xcite .",
    "the lowest previously detected transition from j@xmath3 was co ( @xmath16 ) @xcite , with rather shallow limits on the co ( @xmath26 ) line emission .",
    "co ( @xmath16 ) can be substantially sub - thermally excited , even in starburst galaxies , with a typical brightness temperature ratio of 0.66 for submillimetre galaxies ( smgs ) , and 0.6 for high @xmath8 main sequence galaxies .",
    "conversely , the co ( @xmath0 ) to co ( @xmath26 ) ratio is almost always thermal ( i.e. the brightness temperature is constant due to thermalized emission ) , even in high-@xmath8 main sequence galaxies , with ratios of 0.85 in smgs and 0.9 even in high @xmath8 main sequence galaxies .",
    "hence , co ( @xmath0 ) provides an excellent route to study cool gas reservoirs , being four times stronger ( in erg s@xmath21 hz@xmath21 ) than co ( @xmath26 ) , but still tracing the colder gas @xcite .",
    "we use the capabilities of the vla to image the full emission line from j@xmath3 .",
    "the previous co ( @xmath16 ) observations used the old vla correlator , which had limited bandwidth and channelization , leading to an observation that missed the line wings beyond @xmath27 km s@xmath21 , and had only 12 channels across the centre of the line .    and",
    "lastly , we obtain sensitive observations of the continuum emission at a rest frame frequency of 230 ghz , corresponding to an emission regime that would be dominated by the cold dust .    we adopt a standard @xmath28cdm cosmological model with @xmath29 km s@xmath21 mpc@xmath21 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 . at a redshift of @xmath1",
    ", this implies an age of the universe of 851 myr and a scale of @xmath32 kpc arcsec@xmath21 .",
    "we use the vla in c and d configurations to observe the co ( @xmath0 ) ( @xmath33 ghz ) emission line towards j1148@xmath345251 .",
    "the line is redshifted to @xmath35 ghz at @xmath11 .",
    "observations in the d configuration were performed between november 2011 and january 2012 for a total of @xmath36 hours on source .",
    "observations in the c configuration followed between january and april 2012 for a total of @xmath37 hours on source . since these observations were taken as jvla early science during the initial commissioning of the new correlator , we chose to observe topocentric frequencies",
    ". furthermore , the observations span a six month range that involved major changes to the correlator between c and d configurations .",
    "hence , we did not attempt to doppler track , but have summed the topocentric spectra .",
    "this leads to at most a @xmath38 km s@xmath21 smearing of spectral features , which is comparable to a single channel in our final analysis .",
    "this smearing will have no effect on our subsequent analysis .",
    "the standard calibrator 3c286 was used as a primary flux and bandpass calibrator and the nearby source j1153@xmath344931 was observed approximately every five and a half minutes for pointing , secondary amplitude and phase calibration .",
    "these observations were taken during the commissioning phase of the vla correlator , and hence correlator capabilities were evolving rapidly .",
    "the d array observations were obtained when full channelization ( 64 channels ) was available , but only for a 128 mhz bandwidth .",
    "this bandwidth is easily adequate to cover any reasonable line emission ( @xmath39 km s@xmath21 ) , but does not allow for a sensitive continuum measurement .",
    "the later c array observations had the same line coverage , but also had close to 1 ghz of bandwidth off - line , providing a sensitive continuum observation .",
    "the data were calibrated , imaged and analysed using standard techniques in nrao s casa package @xcite .",
    "some difficulties were encountered due to the presence of two bright sources near the half power position of the primary beam .",
    "small inherent pointing inaccuracies resulted in these sources appearing as time - variant leading to significant residual sidelobes even after deconvolution . to solve this issue we performed continuum subtraction in the @xmath40-plane using the outer most channels ( 4 to 9 and 57 to 62 ) of the 128 mhz band centred on the emission line ( channels 23 to 43 ) .",
    "we imaged the c - array data separately using a close - to-`natural ' weighting scheme characterized by a ` robust ' parameter @xcite of 1 .",
    "we then repeated the process for the d - array data only .",
    "we also created a combined data set from the c and d - array data and imaged it with different weightings to explore spatial resolution versus signal - to - noise optimization .",
    "a close - to-`uniform ' weighting scheme ( robust @xmath41 in casa ) was used to achieve higher spatial resolution , a close - to-`natural ' robust @xmath42 was used to obtain higher sensitivity , and a good trade - off between resolution and sensitivity was achieved with a middle - ground robust @xmath43 . this way we produced maps with a large range in resolution , as shown in table [ robust ] .",

    "the combined c&d observations yield a synthesized beam with broad wings , depending on weighting . to further explore the issue of the co ( @xmath0 ) emission size",
    ", we carried out two tests .",
    "first , we looked at point - source line profiles at various resolutions .",
    "we considered the position of the peak emission from the d - array only map ( derived from a gaussian fit ) as the position of the point source and took line profiles from the d - array only and c&d - array data imaged with three different weightings ( robust @xmath42 ,  @xmath55 and @xmath56 ) .",

    "there is a clear decrease in the peak emission , as it drops from @xmath57 to @xmath58 mjy beam@xmath21 .",
    "fitting gaussians to each of the spectra , we find a difference of @xmath59 between the d - array only spectral amplitude and the c&d - array robust @xmath41 spectral amplitude .",
    "the restoring beams for each of these maps are listed in table [ robust ] .",

    "second , we imaged the combined c&d - array dataset .",
    "this is problematic as well due to the different weightings required for optimal signal - to - noise by data from the two arrays and the broad line wings resulting from having significantly more time on - source with the d array versus the c array . to avoid these issues , we cleaned the integrated line emission ( velocities between @xmath60 km s@xmath21 and @xmath61 km s@xmath21 ) to a depth where the synthesized beam s broad wings are removed and explored different briggs weights .",
    "figure [ total_cii ] shows contours of the j1148 + 5251 velocity - integrated co ( @xmath0 ) emission imaged with a robust of @xmath62 overlaid on to the emission observed by .",
    "the spatial resolution of the co ( @xmath0 ) observations is @xmath63 , just slightly higher than that of the observation , as shown in the bottom left corner of the map .    the main emission region is less than @xmath64 arcsec in extent , although there is some diffuse emission to the south west of the source at @xmath65 which needs further confirmation .",
    "a formal elliptical gaussian fit to the robust @xmath66 image returns a deconvolved major axis of @xmath67 , and an undetermined minor axis and position angle .",
    "so we marginally resolve the emission in one direction and measure a size consistent with that found by @xcite for the co ( @xmath5 ) emission .",
    "the peak flux of @xmath68jy beam@xmath21 is measured close to the position of the optical quasar ( see cross in fig .",
    "[ total_cii ] ; @xcite ) and agrees very well with the position of the .",
    "much deeper observations are needed to determine the source morphology as a function of velocity .",
    "we do not detect any continuum in the co ( @xmath0 ) observations down to a limit of @xmath69jy .",
    "the line width of @xmath70 km s@xmath21 we derive for the co ( @xmath0 ) emission agrees well with the width measured in previous studies .",
    "hence , the low and high order transitions have similar line profiles in j@xmath3 .",
    "the fir - to - radio spectral energy distribution fit from @xcite uses an emissivity index @xmath71 , a dust temperature @xmath72  k @xcite and a fir - to - radio ratio @xmath73 @xcite and predicts an observed flux density of @xmath74jy , with a large uncertainty depending on @xmath75 .",
    "our non - detection is just below the predicted value .",
    "this result confirms a @xmath76 value that is at least as steep as @xmath77 , and possibly steeper , thereby strengthening the argument for little cold dust in j@xmath3 .",
    "far infrared co luminosity ratios and linewidths in quasars at high redshifts are similar to what is observed in local ultra - luminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) so we adopt the co luminosity to h@xmath78 mass conversion factor of @xmath79  ( k km s@xmath21 pc@xmath80)@xmath21 used for ulirgs @xcite . from , the line ratio @xmath81 is typically very close to unity for high redshift galaxies , so we can approximate @xmath82 as @xmath83 k km s@xmath21 pc@xmath53 .",
    "thus , from the co ( j@xmath84 luminosity we derive a total molecular gas mass of @xmath85 .      assuming a rotating disc geometry for the line - emitting gas in j@xmath3 we can estimate the dynamical mass of the emitting region using @xmath86 , where @xmath87 is the diameter in kpc we measured for the emission and @xmath88 is the fwhm in km s@xmath21 of the line profile .",
    "following @xcite we use the approximation @xmath89",
    "@xmath90  fwhm@xmath91 .",
    "taking the size of the source as 8.1 kpc ( the major axis ) implies @xmath92 . for an inclination angle of @xmath93 as found from the ratio of the minor to major axis , the dynamical mass is @xmath94 , in line with previously derived values .",
    "@xcite quote @xmath95 ( or @xmath96 if accounting for an inclination of @xmath97 ) within a disc of diameter 5 kpc .",
    "@xcite use the line emission to find a dynamical mass of @xmath98 for a region with radius @xmath19 kpc .",
    "it has to be noted that there is substantial uncertainty to modelling assumptions ( rotating disc ) , and model parameters ( size , inclination ) in our dynamic mass estimate .",
    "high resolution imaging in or co at much higher signal - to - noise is required to better understand the galaxy dynamics in j@xmath3 .",
    "we have expanded the large velocity gradient ( lvg ) model of the line excitation in j@xmath3 calculated by @xcite in which the kinetic gas temperature and density are considered as free parameters .",
    "a fixed @xmath99 h@xmath78 ortho - to - para ratio was used due to the relative statistical weights of the symmetrical and antisymmetrical eigenstates of the wavefunction .",
    "this model uses the @xcite co collision rates and a cosmic microwave background temperature of @xmath100 k at @xmath101 .",
    "we kept the parameters adopted by @xcite : a co abundance per velocity gradient of [ co]@xmath102 pc/(km s@xmath21 ) and a co disc radius of 2.5 kpc @xcite .",
    "the co ( @xmath0 ) data point fits well on the curve described by the best solution ( fig .",

    "this was obtained for a spherical , single - component model with a co disc filling factor of 0.16 , @xmath103 k , and @xmath104(h@xmath78)@xmath105 @xmath106 .    .",

    "we have observed the co ( @xmath0 ) transition towards j@xmath3 and find supporting evidence that j@xmath3 is similar to lower redshift quasars in terms of its high co line excitation and compact size .",
    "we marginally resolve the main emission region to have a major axis of @xmath109 .",
    "we also detect tentative evidence for diffuse emission extending to the south west .    considering the line excitation in j@xmath3 , our data are used to provide further constraints on previous lvg models , resulting in average physical conditions that are similar to those observed in other high - redshift quasars @xcite .",
    "we find @xmath103  k extending from low to high order transitions .",
    "as such , it is possible that the emission in the low order transitions of co may be associated with the same warm , highly excited star - forming gas traced by higher-_j _ line transitions .",
    "this would support previous claims that the mid-_j _ co lines ( _ _ j__@xmath110 ) may also be good indicators of the total amount of cool molecular gas in high redshift quasars @xcite .    in the local universe",
    ", the traditional view of ultraluminous infared galaxies ( ulirgs ) and agn has been that these objects represent different phases in an evolutionary sequence @xcite . a heavily dust obscured galaxy undergoing vigorous star - formation",
    "will be observed as a ulirg , while a buried agn continues to grow a supermassive blackhole .",
    "this may eventually give rise to a far - infrared luminous quasar , followed by an optically luminous quasar with only a modest gas reservoir remaining .",
    "this scenario may be similar to what is observed in high - redshift quasars , like j@xmath3 , which may have gone through an earlier phase of starburst activity before the agn had formed .",
    "extended reservoirs of cold molecular gas have been detected via co line emission in @xmath111 smgs @xcite , suggesting that they may be in the process of forming through gas - rich mergers .",
    "a population of @xmath112 smgs has recently been discovered ( e.g. riechers et al .",
    "2013 ; weiss et al .",
    "2013 ) , so it is possible that these may represent an early phase of the luminous @xmath113 quasars such as j@xmath3 .",
    "these objects are likely to evolve into the most massive early - type galaxies observed in the local universe . however , in the case of the single known @xmath112 smg , the lack of a hot dust component detected in the herschel bands makes this object inconsistent with such a scenario .",
    "more work is required to establish the validity of the @xmath1146 smgs and @xmath115 quasars connection .",
    "we calculate new estimates of the gas and dynamical mass from the co ( @xmath0 ) line luminosity .",
    "our results agree with previous measurements , but are less prone to biases due to high order molecular line excitation .",
    "the gas mass we estimate is @xmath116 of the dynamical mass , suggesting a low value for @xmath117 .",
    "this supports a departure from the @xmath118 relationship , in that the @xmath119 of the host galaxy is well below that expected from the low @xmath8 relation .",
