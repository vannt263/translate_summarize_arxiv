    "following the 2006 proposal of an invisibility cloak via geometric transforms in the covariant maxwell s equations @xcite , and their conformal counterpart in specific regimes @xcite , enhanced control of electromagnetic waves has been experimentally validated in a number of fascinating studies @xcite , that also include acoustic , elastodynamic and hydrodynamic waves @xcite .",
    "transformation optics @xcite and conformal optics @xcite have been reconciled in the proposal of invisibility carpets @xcite , that make use of quasi - conformal mappings that relax the constraint on anisotropy @xcite .",
    "interestingly , control of wave trajectories can be extended to matter waves @xcite .",
    "looking at the mathematical origin of cloaking , which comes from the concept of dirichlet - to - neumann map in inverse problems with anisotropic media @xcite , some of us proposed some mimetism for matter waves @xcite , and this prompted further studies in control of diffusion phenomena that can be achieved through coordinate transformations in the fourier @xcite and fick s @xcite equations for heat and mass respectively .",
    "the latter work has served as an inspiration for the group of martin wegener , who exploited the fick s diffusion equation for multiple light scattering usages , whereby light is governed by ballistic laws @xcite : cylindrical and spherical invisibility cloaks made of thin shells of polydimethylsiloxane doped with melamine - resin microparticles surrounding a diffusively reflecting hollow core were experimentally shown to ahieve good cloaking performance in a water - based diffusive throughout the entire visible spectrum and for all illumination conditions and incident polarizations of light .",
    "however , these authors noted that the transformed fick s equation as proposed in @xcite does not fully retain its form under pendry s transform @xcite , since a heterogeneous isotropic factor appears in front of the time derivative ( a problem solved in @xcite using reduced parameters that preserve diffusion trajectories , but induce some impedance mismatch at the cloak s boundaries ) .",
    "this issue remained an achilles heel in the control of mass diffusion through geometric transform until now .",
    "interestingly , scattering cancellation techniques for mantle cloaking in diffusion processes do not suffer from this pitfall @xcite as these are based on a totally different mechanism not underpinned by coordinate changes .",
    "this cloaking route reminiscent of neutral inclusions , a concept introduced by kerner 60 years ago @xcite , has been followed in a number of works in the theory of composites in the quasi - static limit @xcite .",
    "it can also explain the success of the cloaking experiment in a water - paint based environment in @xcite , which has been extended to solid media invoking the concept of neutral inclusion , and no longer transformed fick s equation , in @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we focus our analysis on cloaking of diffusive light in scattering media via geometric transforms , which is governed by the diffusive photon density wave ( dpdw ) equation .",
    "the transformed dpdw equation involves an anisotropic spatially varying diffusivity , as well as other heterogeneous but isotropic parameters",
    ". we shall first give a physical interpretation to all the terms in transformed dpdw .",
    "we will then consider numerical illustrations of anamorphism and external cloaking in dpdw equation .",
    "this part is actually an extension of @xcite where dpdw equation was first used to reduce scattering of diffuse light , however without resorting to coordinate changes .",
    "we will then consider a non - linear transform that makes fick s equation totally form invariant in certain cylindrical geometries .",
    "we will finally come back to the interesting question of variation of the field inside the invisibility region in the time domain , since the linear transform which we use for fick s equation avoids pitfall of a vanishing factor in front of the time derivative in transformed equations for the diffusion of mass , heat , matter and light .",
    "let us set the scene of diffusion of light in scattering media .",
    "the transport equation for photons in scattering and absorbing media is given by @xcite @xmath0 with @xmath1 denoting the radiance at position @xmath2 , in direction @xmath3 , at time @xmath4 ( with units of @xmath5 ) .",
    "@xmath6 denotes the probability of scattering to @xmath7 from direction @xmath3 .",
    "@xmath8 is the speed of light in the medium and @xmath9 , @xmath10 are the scattering and absorption coefficients , respectively .",
    "@xmath11 is the source term .",
    "the photon fluence is given by @xmath12 in order to get solutions of this equation for diverse geometries , one needs to make the so - called @xmath13 approximation @xcite .",
    "it consists in expanding the radiance @xmath14 and source @xmath11 in terms of spherical harmonics @xmath15 , and truncating at order @xmath16 , i.e. @xmath17 and @xmath18 the phase function can also be expanded as ( assuming that the scattering amplitude is only dependent on the change in direction of the photon @xcite ) : @xmath19 the approximation @xmath20 ( i.e. setting @xmath21 ) is actually , quite appropriate when @xmath22 ( absorption much smaller than scattering ) and @xmath23 is not too anisotropic @xcite . inserting eqs .",

    "( [ diff5 ] ) equal to zero , so - called dpdw equation , that we will utilize throughout this paper .",
    "this equation for propagation of diffuse photon density waves with heterogeneous isotropic diffusivity , and heterogeneous absorption coefficient , in the time - harmonic regime , takes thus the final form @xmath34 where @xmath35 represents the distribution of fluence field at each point @xmath36 in cartesian coordinates ( for more details on cylindrical dpdw cloaks in the frequency domain , see @xcite ) .    moreover , @xmath25 is the modified diffusivity , i.e. @xmath26 , with @xmath27 the modified scattering coefficient and @xmath8 is the speed of light as defined in ( [ diff1 ] ) .",
    "let us consider a map ( a pull - back ) from a co - ordinate system @xmath37 to the co - ordinate system @xmath38 given by the transformation characterized by @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "this change of co - ordinates is characterized by the transformation of the differentials through the jacobian :    @xmath42    from a geometric point of view , the matrix @xmath43 is a representation of the metric tensor .",
    "the only thing to do in the transformed coordinates is to replace the diffusivity ( homogeneous and isotropic ) and potential by equivalent ones .",
    "the effective diffusivity becomes heterogeneous and anisotropic , while the absorption coefficient and the speed of light get a new expression .",
    "their properties are given by @xmath44 where @xmath45 stands for the upper diagonal part of the inverse of @xmath46 and @xmath47 is the third diagonal entry of @xmath48 .",
    "the transformed equation associated with ( [ govpressure ] ) reads @xmath49 where importantly the source term @xmath50 is a hallmark of the geometric transform .",
    "indeed , if one places a source in the transformed medium , it seems to radiate from a shifted location , what can be considered as a mirage effect @xcite .",
    "an elegant way to derive ( [ transfpressure ] ) is to multiply ( [ govpressure ] ) by a test function that is an infinitely differentiable function which vanishes on the boundary @xmath51 of a domain @xmath52 , and to further integrate by parts over @xmath52 , which leads to : @xmath53 where @xmath3 is the unit outward normal to the boundary @xmath51 of the integration domain @xmath52 .",
    "moreover , @xmath54 denotes the duality product between the space of distributions ( these are generalized functions such as dirac , heaviside functions ) and the space of test functions i.e. a pairing in which one integrates a distribution against a test function .",
    "we now apply to ( [ equ_ac_weak ] ) the coordinate change @xmath55 ( a push - forward ) and noting that @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the gradient in the new coordinates , we end up with @xmath58 upon integration by parts , and noting that @xmath59 we obtain @xmath60 which is the intergral form of ( [ transfpressure ] ) .",
    "this lays the foundation of transformation light diffusion .",
    "note that in the case of cylindrical domains , when the geometric transform only affects the transverse coordinates i.e. the transformation is characterized by @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 one has : @xmath64 where @xmath45 stands for the upper diagonal part of the inverse of @xmath46 and @xmath47 is the third diagonal entry of @xmath48 .",
    "this is left as an exercise for the zealous reader , who can otherwise find the derivation in section 4.3 . on external cloaking .",
    "we would like to also stress that we shall use pull - back transformations in the sequel for historical reasons : cloaking was first proposed for maxwell s equations , which behave well under pull - back geometric transforms , unlike push - forward @xcite .",
    "let us also take this opportunity to give proper credit to the seminal work on masking by teixeira @xcite and on anamorphism by nicolet , zolla and geuzaine @xcite . in the former ,",
    "the formalism of differential geometry is used to demystify cloaking and masking , while the latter shows that if an object is placed in a transformed medium , it will scatter like another object with deformed boundary , and different electromagnetic parameters , see fig .",
    "[ geojohn ] , which is characterized by the pull - back transform .",
    "nicolet et al .",
    "illustrated their theory with an object placed inside a heterogeneous anisotropic shell , which is a singular cloak . in",
    "what follows , we shall pursue an alternative route to anamorphism , which amounts to placing an object in the invisibility region of a non - singular cloak that scatters like a different object , see @xcite for the case of matter - waves .",
    "in this section we discuss a generalization of pendry s linear transformation @xcite to a degree @xmath65 polynomial transformation .",
    "it is applied to the general framework where it sends a domain to another domain , and is nowhere singular .",
    "the corresponding derived electromagnetic material is hence nowhere singular .",
    "moreover , this allows to create mimesis whereby an object dressed with a device acquires the same electromagnetic behavior as another one of our choice .",
    "the case where the polynomial is of degree @xmath66 is discussed in @xcite .",
    "the non - transformation ( [ eqnonlinear ] ) we propose here readily extends to any star domain in @xmath67 that is , any domain with a vantage point from which all points , including the boundary s , are within line - of - sight .",
    "the transformation preserves every line passing through that fixed vantage point . in more details , consider three bounded star domains @xmath68 in @xmath69 with piecewise smooth boundaries @xmath70 all sharing the same chosen vantage point , @xmath71 and",
    "further suppose they have the following configuration : @xmath72 contains @xmath73 which in turn , contains @xmath74 we would like to make the domain @xmath72 acquire the same response to any electromagnetic waves as the different domain @xmath74 more precisely , we seek to fill the region @xmath75 with an electromagnetic medium whose properties ( permittivity and permeability ) are given by the tensor @xmath76 in equation ( [ eq : tensorgeneral ] ) below , so that @xmath72 appears to electromagnetic waves as if it were @xmath77 with an infinitely conducting boundary @xmath78 we call such an electromagneti divice , a mimesis cloak .",

    "it is given by ( [ eqnonlinear ] ) and it sends the region @xmath81 to the region @xmath75 , in such a way that the boundary @xmath82 of @xmath83 stays point - wise fixed , while @xmath84 is mapped to @xmath85 we also set an infinitely conducting boundary condition on the inner boundary @xmath86 of the region @xmath87 any type of defect could be concealed inside @xmath73 and @xmath72 will yet still have the same electromagnetic response as @xmath77 with an infinitely conducting boundary @xmath88 in practice , we may divide the domains @xmath68 into subdomains , the part of whose boundaries lying inside @xmath89 is a smooth hypersurface .",
    "here is a detailed description of the non - linear transformation and the subsequent construction of the tensor @xmath90 .",

    "it is also worth noting that taking dirichlet or neumann boundary conditions at a finite distance ( without geometric transformation ) would change the physics of the problem , by enforcing some values of the field at a finite distance . importantly , since we deal with a diffusion equation which is such that the field s amplitude is evanescent away from the source , there is no need to consider a complex valued mapping like in @xcite for perfectly matched layers ( pmls ) , which were originally introduced by berenger @xcite to absorb electromagnetic waves propagating in all directions , without reflection .",

    "let us now assume that @xmath192 and @xmath193 in ( [ govpressure ] ) , this leads us to fick s equation , where @xmath25 is a chemical diffusivity in units of @xmath194 and @xmath35 a concentration . in @xcite , where the transformed fick s equation counterpart of ( [ transfpressure ] ) with @xmath192 and @xmath193 was studied in the time - domain , it was noted that the parameter @xmath195 has no physical meaning for @xmath196 .    in order to overcome this pitfall",
    ", we now consider a geometric transform for cloaking which is such that det(*j * ) is a constant .",
    "this can be done assuming that @xmath197 in ( [ eqnonlinear ] ) , and further considering some boundaries parameterized by an azimuthal angle @xmath198 : @xmath199 whose jacobian is such that @xmath200 .",
    "if we further consider some radially symmetric ( circular ) boundaries , we can see that @xmath201 becomes a constant .",
    "interestingly , if we take @xmath202 , we endup with the nonlinear counterpart of pendry s formula @xmath203 which has jacobian @xmath204 which is such that @xmath205 .    provided that @xmath201 is constant ( what requires circular boundaries ) , it is possible to recast ( [ transfpressure ] ) as @xmath206 with @xmath207 . when @xmath193 and @xmath192 , fick s equation is form invariant under ( [ magictransfo ] )",
    ".    we note that ( [ magictransfo ] ) also solves the issue of reduced parameters that brought a small discrepancy in fourier s equation in @xcite , which were used for a layered thermal cloak via homogenization .",
    "unfortunately , the form invariant fick s equation under ( [ magictransfo ] ) holds only for circular boundaries , and breaks down in the spherical case .",
    "let us now detail the computation of the diffusion matrix .",
    "we start with the computation of the jacobian matrix of the compound transformation @xmath208 which can be expressed as : @xmath209 where @xmath210 , @xmath211 and @xmath212 ; moreover , @xmath213 and we note that @xmath214 as the rotation matrices @xmath215 and @xmath183 are unimodular .",
    "we then compute the transformation matrix : @xmath216 where we have use the fact that the rotation matrix satifies @xmath186 and @xmath187 .",
    "we now observe that from ( [ magictransfo ] ) @xmath217 , hence the transformed diffusivity inside the circular coating of the cloak can be expressed as @xmath218 where the eigenvalues of the diagonal matrix ( principal values of conductivity ) are from ( [ bleu ] ) @xmath219 with @xmath220 and @xmath221 the interior and the exterior radii of the cloak .    in order to eliminate @xmath222 in the factor of @xmath223 as in ( [ transfpressure1 ] ) , we multiply the eigenvalues by @xmath201 and find @xmath224    this should be compared with eigenvalues of diffusivity and determinant of jacobian obtained from pendry s transform when @xmath104 : @xmath225 note that @xmath226 vanishes for @xmath227 , in which case the frequency dependence is dropped .",
    "physically , replacing the frequency by a time derivative , this means it should take an infinite amount of time for mass to cross the inner boundary of the cloak .",
    "this led to counterintuitive results for the transformed heat equation in @xcite , where it was observed that heat inside the invisibility region is constant at each time step , and similar results hold for the transformed fick s equation in @xcite .",
    "we would like to investigate what happens inside this invisibility region with the nonlinear transform that avoids the vanshing determinant .",
    "in this section , we draw interesting consequences on the application of non linear transform ( [ magictransfo ] ) to various diffusion equations in the time domain .",
    "provided that @xmath201 is constant ( what requires circular boundaries ) , the transformed light diffusion equation in time domain writes as @xmath228 with @xmath207 . when @xmath193 and @xmath192 , the time dependent fick s equation is form invariant under ( [ magictransfo ] ) , which was not the case in @xcite .",
    "the transformed fick s equation in @xcite has served as an inspiration for the work on light diffusion cloaks by wegener s group , and using our geometric transform ( [ magictransfo ] ) , it should be now possible to achieve well behaved cloaks in the transient domain , since there is no longer the issue of the heterogeneous determinant as a factor of the time derivative .",
    "moreover , fourier s equation for heat also takes a nicer form , when using our transform : @xmath229 as now there is no more issue with vanishing values of product of density by specific heat at the inner boundary of the cloak .",
    "therefore , the thermodynamic cloak design experimentally validated in @xcite might be further improved .",
    "finally , one should note that there is a strong analogy between ( [ transfpressure1 ] ) and the time - dependent schr \" odinger equation in the context of quantum mechanics . some time - independent quantum cloaks for matter waves have been proposed by the groups of zhang and greenleaf using coordinate transforms @xcite , but they suffered from an inherent singularity due to the vanishing determinant on the inner boundary of the cloak , which is overcome with the non - linear transform using the transformed schr \" odinger equation @xmath230 where @xmath231 can now be safely removed from the equation . which has not been studied thus far in the cloaking literature .",
    "here , what plays the role of the transformed conductivity in ( [ transfpressure1 ] ) is @xmath232 , which is a transformed ( anisotropic heterogeneous ) mass .",
    "note that when @xmath231 is not a constant , @xmath233 is a transformed ( heterogeneous ) potential .",
    "moreover , @xmath231 in the left - hand side is a time - scaling parameter , @xmath234 is the planck constant and @xmath235 is the wave function . in order to facilitate the physical interpretation of ( [ transcat ] ) , one can now divide throughout by @xmath231 , since it is a constant thanks to ( [ magictransfo ] ) .",
    "we have considerably improved the cloak s design , since we do not have to handle the heterogeneous determinant like in @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , we still face the obstacle of an anisotropic diffusivity inside the cloak .",
    "this problem can be handled using techniques of homogenization see e.g. chapter 1 in @xcite for a detailed derivation in the case of the conductivity and wave equations .",
    "let us consider that the field is solution of the following dpdw equation ( outside the source ) @xmath236 inside the heterogeneous isotropic cloak @xmath237 , where @xmath238 , @xmath239 and @xmath240 are piecewise continuous functions of period @xmath66 in @xmath241 .",
    "when @xmath242 , the field @xmath243 oscillates rapidly in the structured cloak @xmath237 , with oscillations on the order of @xmath244 .",
    "to filter these variations , we consider an asymptotic expansion of @xmath245 solution of ( [ acoustic - hom1 ] ) in terms of a macroscopic ( or slow ) variable @xmath246 and a microscopic ( or fast ) variable @xmath247 .",
    "the homogenization of dpdw equation can be derived by considering the ansatz @xmath248 where for every @xmath249 is 1-periodic along @xmath250 .",
    "note that we evenly divide @xmath237 ( @xmath251 , @xmath252 ) into a large number of thin curved layers of radial length @xmath253 , but the time variable @xmath4 in ( [ acoustic - hom1 ] ) is not rescaled .    rescaling the differential operator in eq .",
    "( [ acoustic - hom1 ] ) accordingly as @xmath254 , and collecting the terms sitting in front of the same powers of @xmath244 , we obtain @xmath255 which is the homogenized dpdw equation where @xmath256 is the leading order term in the ansatz ( [ ansatz ] ) . here , @xmath257 is the arithmetic mean over a unit cell @xmath258 along the radial axis and @xmath259 is a homogenized rank-2 diagonal tensor , which has the physical dimensions of a homogenized anisotropic diffusivity @xmath260 given by @xmath261    we note that if the cloak consists of an alternation of two homogeneous isotropic layers of thicknesses @xmath262 and @xmath263 and diffusivities @xmath264 , @xmath265 , light speed @xmath266 , @xmath267 and absorption coefficients @xmath268 , @xmath269 , we obtain the following effective parameters @xmath270 which are respectively described by one harmonic and three arithmetic means , where @xmath271 is the ratio of thicknesses for layers @xmath159 and @xmath272 and @xmath273 .",
    "we consider a multilayered cloak with radii @xmath274 mm and @xmath275 mm , with @xmath276 layers of diffusivity varying between @xmath277 and @xmath278 ( in units of @xmath279 ) and compare its diffusion against a shell with same radii and a thin inner layer of diffusivity @xmath277 ( graphene could be used ) and a thick outer layer of diffusivity @xmath278 ( still in units of @xmath279 ) .",
    "we show in figures [ fig : mimetism7b]-[fig : mimetism7a ] the spatial distribution of mass at representative time steps ( this is similar for light , heat etc . , except that one has to apply a scaling factor on time due to the very diffusion speed for chemical species , light , heat etc . ) .",
    "we start with the case of long times , when we reach the stationary regime in figure [ fig : mimetism7b ] , where we note in panels ( a ) and ( b ) that the field is uniform inside the invisibility region of the cloak , unlike for the two - layer shell .",
    "we plot the profile of mass concentration in panels ( b ) and ( d ) along the x - axis highlighted by the white segment in panels ( a ) and ( b ) .",
    "however , when we look at short times , we can see quite interesting antagonistic behaviours in the cloak and the shell , see figures [ fig : mimetism7d]-[fig : mimetism7c ] : field increases with time almost uniformly in the invisibility region in panels ( a ) and ( b ) , whereas it varies non monotonically in panels ( b ) and ( c ) , and eventually reaches a uniform gradient .",
    "let us explain this phenomenon .",
    "if we assume that the field ( mass , or photon density or temperature ) on the inner disc @xmath25 is zero , then the weak maximum principle ensures us that the temperature is zero everywhere inside the disc @xmath25 .",
    "however , if the temperature on the boundary @xmath280 of @xmath25 this theorem only states that @xmath281 . in order to demonstrate that the field inside the disc is a constant for any given time @xmath4 , we need to apply the mean value property , which states that @xcite :    * theorem ( nirenberg ) : * _ let @xmath282 ( i.e. continuous with first and second space derivatives continuous and first time derivative continuous ) solve the heat equation ( [ heat ] ) then : @xmath283 for each @xmath284 . here , @xmath285 is the so - called heat ball which is a super - level set of the fundamental solution of the heat equation defined as @xmath286 and @xmath287 . _    as a corollary of this theorem , if d is connected and there exists @xmath288 such that @xmath289 , then by picking @xmath250 small enough so that @xmath290 , and using the mean value property , we conclude that @xmath291 is constant inside @xmath292 .    next for any @xmath293 such that the line segment connecting @xmath169 to @xmath294 is in @xmath25 , we can show that @xmath295 whenever @xmath296 by covering the line segment connecting @xmath297 and @xmath298 with the heat balls .    finally ,",
    "since @xmath25 is connected , any @xmath294 can be connected from @xmath169 via finitely many line segments .",
    "and therefore we have @xmath299 for all @xmath300 , @xmath301 .",
    "we have therefore shown that if the invisibility region @xmath25 is connected , which is clearly the case for a disc , but also for the invisibility region shown in figures [ fig : mimetism7b]-[fig : mimetism7a ] , and if there exists @xmath302 such that @xmath303 , then we are ensured that @xmath304 in @xmath305 . keeping in mind",
    "that the value of the field on the boundary of the invisibility region @xmath25 in [ fig : mimetism7b]-[fig : mimetism7a ] is the solution of the transformed equation ( [ transfpressure1 ] ) , we note that it is an appromation of the field solution of the diffusion equation ( [ govpressure ] ) at the point @xmath306 in ( [ magictransfo ] ) mapped onto @xmath307 .",
    "we therefore deduce that the field in the circular invisibility region in figure[fig : mimetism7b]-[fig : mimetism7a ] is a constant field equal to the value of the field at the center point of the disc @xmath25 before geometric transform . in the present case ,",
    "the value of @xmath291 solution of ( [ govpressure ] ) at the center point is @xmath308 , hence after the geometric transform the value of @xmath291 solution of ( [ transfpressure1 ] ) on @xmath280 equals @xmath308 , and so is the value of @xmath309 solution of its approximate homogenized equation ( [ acoustic - hom2 ] ) . applying the above corollary of the mean value theorem",
    ", we deduce that @xmath310 in the disc @xmath25 .",
    "importantly , when we consider a different point as the origin of the geometric transform , the maximum value inside @xmath25 can be smaller or larger than @xmath308 , but it can not exceed @xmath311 . indeed ,",
    "if we assume that the value of the field at the point taken as the origin @xmath306 of the geometric transform is @xmath311 , maximum of the field solution of ( [ govpressure ] ) , then the above discussion leads to @xmath312 inside the invisibility region .",
    "in this review article , we have proposed some models of generalized cloaks that create some optical illusion for light in diffusive media : infinite conducting obstacles dressed with these cloaks scatter light like other infinite conducting obstacles . in these cloaks ,",
    "an electric wire could in fact be hiding a larger object near it .",
    "in fact , any object could mimic the signature of any other one .",
    "for instance , we design a cylindrical cloak so that a circular obstacle behaves like a square obstacle , thereby bringing about one of the oldest enigma of ancient time : squaring the circle !",
    "the ordinary cloaks then come as a particular case , whereby objects appear as an infinitely small infinite conducting object ( of vanishing scattering cross - section ) and hence become invisible .",
    "such generalized cloaks are described by nonsingular permittivity and permeability , even at the cloak s inner surface .",
    "we have proposed and discussed some interesting applications .",
    "the results within this paper can be extended to cloaking and anamorphism for electromagnetic , acoustic , hydrodynamic and elastodynamic waves propagating in anisotropic heterogeneous media .",
    "regarding the fabrication of the light diffusion cloak , there is of course the route work @xcite but we note the possibility to use instead a self - assembly technique for colloidal nanoparticles like in @xcite . for the mass diffusion cloak",
    ", it has been shown in @xcite that certain membranes of graphene oxyde allow for control of drug diffusion , we thus believe go could be used as a building block of a biocloak ( see fig . [",
    "fig : intro ] for an artistic view ) that would also consist of an alternation of peptides as proposed in @xcite .",
