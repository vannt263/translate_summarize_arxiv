    "violation of time - reversal invariance ( t ) could be inferred from a weak interaction induced transverse polarization ( @xmath5 ) of muons normal to the decay plane in the decays @xmath6  ( @xmath1 ) and @xmath7  ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "standard model ( sm ) contributions to @xmath5 are at about the @xmath9 level @xcite and final state interactions in @xmath1 contribute at the @xmath10 level @xcite .",
    "a measurement in excess of this has the potential to reveal new cp violation physics , given cpt invariance .",
    "the value of @xmath5 can be as large a @xmath11  @xmath12 in models with multi - higgs doublets , leptoquarks , left - right symmetry or susy @xcite .",
    "motivation to search for additional sources of cp violation arises from the observed baryon asymmetry in the universe , which can not be explained by the cp violation in the standard model alone such as the sm t - violation observed in the neutral kaon system @xcite . at the high energy accelerator research organization ( kek ) in japan ,",
    "the e246 collaboration is completing a search for @xmath5 in @xmath1 at the @xmath13 level .    in 1999 , the first result , @xmath14 , was published @xcite , based on @xmath15 good @xmath16 events from the data taken during 1996 and 1997 , indicating there is no evidence for t violation .",
    "the t - violating parameter im@xmath17 was then extracted as im@xmath18 .",
    "the 90% confidence limits are given as @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "further data were collected during 1998  2000 , and the final e246 sensitivity to @xmath5 in @xmath1 is expected to be @xmath21 corresponding to @xmath22im@xmath23 of about @xmath24 . since statistics will dominate the sensitivity , the detector will have a capability to improve the sensitivity by a factor of 34 using a more intense kaon beam in the future . in this paper",
    "we give a description of the apparatus .",
    "the measurement of the t - violating transverse muon polarization @xmath25 requires first that the detectable constituents of the @xmath1 decay with a branching ration of 3.2% be distinguished and that the decay plane be established from the kinematic parameters .",
    "secondly , a polarimeter must be sensitive to the polarization component normal to the decay plane .",
    "for example , if events are selected whose decay plane includes the beam axis , then @xmath25 would appear as an azimuthal component of the polarization around the beam axis .",
    "the muon polarization is measured from the asymmetry of the decay positron angular distribution relative to the polarization axis .",
    "in our experiment we used a stopped kaon beam in contrast to the previous search @xcite which used the in - flight decay of a 4-gev kaon beam .",
    "although a low - momentum stopped - kaon beam risks a potential disadvantage of reduced kaon flux compared to the high momentum beam used for in - flight measurements , the stopped method offers several potential advantages in minimizing backgrounds and systematic uncertainties which compensate the reduced beam intensity , and can result in a measurement with improved overall sensitivity .    in a stopped - kaon decay , the kinematics can be determined with high resolution which allows a precise definition of the decay plane as well as powerful tools to reject backgrounds and reduce systematic instrumental sources of asymmetry . in our apparatus , muons are accepted in a range of polar angles around @xmath26 with respect to the beam axis and are momentum analyzed in one of the 12 gaps of a superconducting toroidal spectrometer magnet .",
    "the decay vertex is determined by tracking in scintillators and/or wirechambers of the charged incoming kaon and outgoing muon .",
    "the muon momentum is obtained with adequate resolution to reject the dominant decay modes @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) and @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "the @xmath31 momentum is obtained from a high - solid - angle segmented csi(tl ) calorimeter , and the kaon momentum is , of course , zero .",
    "good determination of the @xmath31 decay kinematics in the segmented calorimeter allows one to identify and include events in the muon polarimeter corresponding to both forward ( downstream ) and backward ( upstream ) going @xmath31s , @xmath32 and @xmath33 events , respectively .",
    "the two classes of events give opposite asymmetries in the polarimeter due to @xmath25 as illustrated in figure [ fg : fwdbwdpt ] .",
    "that is , a properly normalized sum of @xmath32- and @xmath33-type events must give a zero asymmetry . in the previous in -",
    "flight experiment only a forward - decaying ( @xmath32 ) @xmath31 was inferred from the forward boost from the @xmath4 rest frame and an energy threshold on one of the decay photons .",
    "=    from the kinematics it is also possible to optimize the instrumental sensitivity to the physics parameter of t violation in this decay , @xmath34 .",
    "the value of @xmath35 varies by an order of magnitude over the @xmath36 phase space . a figure of merit combining the statistical sensitivity of the decay rate and @xmath37 peaks for @xmath38 energies above 50 mev and @xmath31 energies below @xmath39 mev , well away from the kinematic peak .",
    "the muon acceptance in particular can therefore be optimized to enhance the sensitivity to @xmath34 from @xmath25 .      instead of using the transverse field method which was adopted in the previous experiment@xcite we adopted the longitudinal field configuration .",
    "in this case the transverse component @xmath5 of the muon polarization is held , and the non - t - violating in - plane components precess , while in the transverse field method the in - plane component @xmath40 parallel to the muon momentum is held and the t - violating component was sought as a possible phase shift of the precessing component .",
    "the comparison is shown in figure [ fg : msr ] .",
    "=    in our apparatus the polarimeter is similar in general concept to that used in @xcite , except that the fringe magnetic field from the toroid is shimmed to produce an _ azimuthal _ field at the muon stoppers .",
    "muons are stopped in an annular array of aluminum stoppers surrounding the beam axis .",
    "positrons from muon decay are detected in scintillator arrays located azimuthally between the muon stoppers so that an asymmetry between clockwise , @xmath41- and counter - clockwise , @xmath42-decaying muons can be measured . in our case",
    ", the 12-segment polarimeter accepts muons exiting the gaps of the toroid and is located well removed from both the stopping target and beam axis where background rates can be reduced to a low level .",
    "this minimizes the problems of accidental rates in detecting the decay positrons and allows a long acceptance time for the muon decay ( @xmath43s ) in order obtain higher statistical sensitivity and detailed determination of the background .",
    "one advantage of using the longitudinal field method in the present experiment is higher statistical significance from a given number of positron events compared to a reduction of @xmath44 in the case of the precession measurement .",
    "although usually it is problematic how to remove instrumental misalignment which gives rise to a spurious asymmetry effect in the longitudinal field method , in the present experiment such effects can be canceled out by taking the ratio of @xmath32 and @xmath33 pions .",
    "@xmath25 would be indicated by an asymmetry between @xmath41 and @xmath42 decay positrons as @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the effective analyzing power and @xmath47 is the kinematical attentuation relating the polarization axis to the decay plane .",
    "furthermore , it is possible to obtain the polarization from the double ratio @xmath48_{fwd}}{[n(cw)/n(ccw)]_{bwd } } \\simeq 1 + 4 \\alpha   \\langle\\cos{\\theta_{t}}\\rangle p_{t } , \\label{e2}\\ ] ] with a doubling of the sensitivity to @xmath25 .",
    "several sources of potential systematic errors due to instrumental misalignments cancel out to first order in this double ratio",
    ". a direct measurement of the analyzing power can be obtained from the @xmath49 component , which is the in - plane component parallel to the pion momentum , by selecting events with a transverse @xmath31 decay .",
    "the field requires good mapping and stability , but it does not need to be reversed as did the axial field in the previous experiment @xcite .",
    "this avoids potential systematic effects due to the reversing field itself as well as its effect on photomultiplier tube ( pmt ) gains .",
    "general assembly views of the apparatus are shown in figure [ fg : e246det ] as end and side views .",
    "our detector s three main analytical elements are the toroidal spectrometer , the csi(tl ) photon calorimeter @xcite , and the polarimeter .",
    "=    the space available for the csi(tl ) array is limited by the 1-m inner diameter of the toroidal magnet and cryostat .",
    "the crystal length of 250 mm ( 13.5 radiation lengths ) is adequate to keep shower leakage for photons up to 250 mev acceptable while still allowing sufficient space for the pin diode and preamplifier readout system .",
    "the crystal array has 12 holes aligned with the magnet gaps which provide the acceptance for charged particles in the spectrometer .",
    "two additional holes in the crystal array were required on the beam axis : the upstream hole allowed for the incoming kaon beam and instrumentation which included a erenkov detector , a scintillator hodoscope and a degrader .",
    "this hole had to accommodate not only the kaon beam phase space but also the six - times - higher pion contamination including an asymmetric halo around the kaon beam , which could result in unacceptable rates in the crystal elements near the beam axis .",
    "this problem was partially alleviated by a pb and w collimator upstream of the apparatus .",
    "downstream , the beam - axial hole provided access for the support and readout of the segmented stopping target assembly and inner tracking elements .",
    "the latter include the 12 close - packed fiducial counters used in the event trigger and for muon time - of - flight measurements , and a stack of ring scintillators and a cylindrical drift chamber both used for muon tracking .",
    "the target size was matched to the measured kaon beam profile at the stopping location at the center of the toroid .",
    "it is necessary to minimize the target size to avoid excess mass in the path of exiting muons and photons from @xmath31s , as well as to economize on the number of segmented elements in the target to be instrumented .",
    "the polarimeter was mounted immediately downstream of the spectrometer to maximize acceptance for @xmath1 @xmath38s in the 12 pure aluminum stopping arrays , and to take advantage of the shimmed fringe field of the toroid which serves as a holding field for @xmath25 .",
    "a wedge shaped copper degrader preceded each aluminum muon stopping array , and compensated for the momentum dispersion from the analyzing magnet so that all muons would come to a near uniform stopping depth .",
    "in addition to the stoppers and positron detectors , the polarimeter included several veto counters used to help identify good stopping muons and valid decays while rejecting backgrounds .      the first design goal was to simultaneously optimize the acceptance for @xmath38s from @xmath1 in the 12 magnet gaps , and to maximize the acceptance for @xmath31s in the csi(tl ) calorimeter .",
    "this required careful matching of the 12 holes in the csi(tl ) array to allow muons from the distribution of stopped kaons in the central stopping target to enter the magnet gaps and be accepted in the polarimeter at the magnet exit . a monte carlo study @xcite lead to a design with 10% acceptance for @xmath38s from @xmath1 , while maintaining 70% coverage for @xmath50 detection .",
    "optimum overall acceptance of 8% was obtained for the angle @xmath46 of 22.5 degrees as illustrated in figure [ fg : acceptance ] .",
    "=      our apparatus is constructed with 12-fold azimuthal symmetry set by the 12-gap toroidal spectrometer magnet .",
    "the summation of events from the 12 spectrometer gaps contributes to the acceptance , and also allows additional capabilities to reduce systematic asymmetry effects due to the instrumentation and the kaon beam phase space .",
    "for example , each positron detector in the polarimeter serves as a @xmath41 counter for one gap and a @xmath42 counter for the neighboring gap , and an apparent asymmetry due to variations in counter efficiencies cancel .",
    "similarly , asymmetries induced by an asymmetric kaon stopping distrubution also cancel in the azimuthal sum over 12 gaps . in this case also , since the decay vertex is determined event - by - event , residual higher order asymmetry can be tested for and corrected .",
    "the experiment was set up at the low - momentum separated kaon beam line k5 @xcite in the north hall of the kek proton synchrotron .",
    "the layout of the beam line is shown in figure [ fg : k5 ] and the main parameters are listed in table [ tb : k5beam ] .",
    "this channel was originally designed for 550-mev/@xmath52 maximum momentum , but it was upgraded to 660 mev/@xmath52 for this experiment .",
    "it is equipped with a single - stage electrostatic separator ( dcs ) with an electric field of 50 kv-@xmath53 and can deliver a @xmath51 beam with @xmath54:@xmath4 ratio of 5  10 making a nearly achromatic spot on the experimental target .",
