    "physical systems often are described by means of dynamical systems defined by differential equations of first order in time .",
    "the knowledge of a single point in phase space is sufficient for precise prediction of the future evolution of the system . starting from this initial condition , the equations of motion can be integrated  at least numerically .",
    "some systems are very sensitive to the initial condition and therefore are associated with deterministic chaos .    for complex systems ,",
    "a deterministic description often is not feasible due to the huge amount of degrees of freedom and their frequently unknown microscopic interactions .",
    "however , in many cases the individual processes act on two different time scales .",
    "the dynamics of the entire system then can be reduced to the dynamics of some macroscopic order parameters , that enslave the highly fluctuating microscopic degrees of freedom @xcite . in turn , the set of order parameters , @xmath0 , obeys stochastic differential equations ( sdes ) . if the sdes are of first order in time , trajectories likewise can be generated from one single initial state .",
    "the evolution then does not depend on properties of the trajectory prior to the initial point and , therefore , exhibits only a very restricted memory .",
    "realisations of particular trajectories sensitively depend on the fluctuating random forces , that are involved .",
    "however , considering an ensemble of realizations of the stochastic process , the markovian property becomes evident .    in recent years",
    ", the analysis of stochastic time series has made great advances .",
    "especially , the non - parametric reconstruction of the governing stochastic differential equation by means of the direct evaluation so drift and diffusion function has become a successful tool for analyzing stochastic processes . a method , that initially was proposed by siegert et al .",
    "@xcite , in the meantime has been applied to several problems in the field of finance @xcite , life sciences @xcite and turbulence @xcite .",
    "moreover , algorithms for the efficient application of maximum likelihood methods have been developed @xcite .",
    "a brief overview over the estimation power of several methods can be found in @xcite .",
    "quite recently , an algorithm has been proposed , that combines the capabilities of the latter methods @xcite .",
    "however , the validity of markov properties remains a crucial constraint for the efficient application of all these procedures on stationary time series data .",
    "a close inspection of data sets generally indicates , that markov properties are violated at small time differences .",
    "typically , physical arguments are accounted for this effect , based on the fact that stochastic forces actually are correlated in time on small time differences .",
    "the aim of the present note is to study the influence of measurement noise on the markov properties of measured data .",
    "we shall show that measurement noise as well interferes with and spoils the markov properties .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "some methods for verification of the markov properties of measured data sets are reconsidered .",
    "section [ sect : theory ] contains the basic arguments concerning the influence of measurement noise on the transition probability density functions .",
    "consequences of the central equation ( [ eqn : markovnoise ] ) for the markov properties will be made explicit by means of three limiting cases , that are discussed at the end of the section . in section [",
    "sect : data - analysis ] , the general results of the former section are exemplified by means of two particular examples . in detail , the impact of discretization noise on a purely deterministic system and the effects of uncorrelated measurement noise on a stochastic process are investigated .",
    "we conclude with section [ sect : conclusion ] , which summarises the main results of our investigations and comprises the consequences for standard tools for data analysis .",
    "multivariate joint probability density functions ( pdfs ) are of great importance for the analysis of measured time series @xmath1 . in principle",
    ", they contain all information on the initial data set such as spatial and temporal evolution .",
    "the benefit from a probabilistic approach on the basis of high dimensional joint pdfs , however , generally is limited .",
    "the analysis substantially can be simplified , if the data set under consideration satisfies markov properties .",
    "this circumstance is equivalent to the representation of all multivariate joint pdfs in products of single - conditioned pdfs , @xmath2 here , @xmath3 is a shorthand notation for the probability of being at time @xmath4 in a small interval at @xmath5 with @xmath6 . in general , the latter transition pdfs furthermore explicitly depend on the times @xmath7 .",
    "let us now assume the sample to be ergodic and stationary in a sense , that ensemble averages can be carried out by means of time averages and the pdfs do not depend on time explicitly @xcite . then",
    ", the chapman - kolmogorov equation @xcite @xmath8 has to be fulfilled for any markov process .",
    "this equation can be evaluated numerically for measured data sets .",
    "although the validation of this equation is not sufficient for the validity of markov properties , it has turned out to be a very robust criterion .",
    "moreover , a direct comparison of the conditional probability distributions @xmath9 and @xmath10 has been used for validation of markov properties . for markovian data , these functions should coincidence for arbitrary values of @xmath11 .",
    "an example for the application of this procedure by means of graphical inspection of the pdfs is depicted in figure [ fig : markov_surf ] , that has been prepared by wchter et al .  in connection with",
    "the study of the statistical properties of hight profiles of gold surfaces @xcite . here ,",
    "wchter et al .  investigated markov properties of the transition pdfs for nested heigth increments in different scales . in the present case",
    ", markov properties might be fulfilled for scales separated by @xmath12 , whereas they evidently are violated at separation lenghts of @xmath13 , as can be seen from inspection of figure [ fig : markov_surf ] .",
    "it is evident , that the proper interpretation of the plot with respect to the markov properties has to be quantified by introducing a certain measure for the distance of the two probability distributions . to this end",
    "the wilcoxon test @xcite can be applied in order to compare pdfs , that originate from samples of different size , and only makes few demands on the properties of the individual pdfs .",
    "the numerical implementation is straightforward , results for the present example e.g.  are depicted in @xcite . for a detailed description of the wilcoxon test",
    "we refer to the appendix of @xcite .",
    "if the direct estimation @xcite of drift and diffusion functions from measured data sets is intended and the underlying process , therefore , is assumed to obey langevin equations , an alternative method can be applied for inspection of markov properties . once the estimation procedure has been performed and an estimate for drift and diffusion functions is available , the character of the dynamical noise can be determined from the sample .",
    "the presence of noise without any temporal and spatial correlations is a sufficient indication for compliance of the measured data set with markov properties .",
    "this procedure e.g.  is outlined and applied in @xcite .",
    "it is certainly the most direct way to investigate markov properties .",
    "an ensemble of markov processes @xmath14 is considered , that now is distorted by measurement noise @xmath15 . for simplicity , the details are carried out for a one - dimensional process .",
    "only three consecutive points @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 with @xmath19 and @xmath20 are investigated for this purpose . since the statistics is assumed to be stationary ,",
    "this is sufficient for the current considerations .",
    "henceforth , @xmath21 is a shorthand notation for the transition pdf of the variable @xmath22 in the time increment @xmath23 .",
    "let us now assume , that the true process is hidden to the data analyst : instead of the variable @xmath14 , a perturbed variable @xmath24 is measured , that emerges from the initial process by means of the relation @xmath25 thereby , @xmath26 is a stochastic variable , that incorporates systematic and non - systematic measurement errors .",
    "we further assume , that the deterministic contributions to the measurement error can be identified and the noise @xmath27 can be specified by @xmath28 here , @xmath29 incorporates non - systematic noise sources . for reasons of simplicity , we assume these errors to be independent of one another for consecutive measurements , @xmath30 on the other hand",
    ", @xmath31 characterises deterministic , systematic measurements errors , that have no explicit dependence on @xmath32 .",
    "we would like to emphasize , that discretization errors fall into this broad class , that are an intrinsic feature of any digital measurement procedure . while the former noise is uncorrelated , this assumption generally is violated for the latter noise source due to correlations in the variable @xmath22 itself .",
    "the probability for the measurement of @xmath33 now solely depends on the entangled variable @xmath34 and can be specified by means of the conditional probability @xmath35 .",
    "hence , the conditional probability @xmath36 for the process @xmath24 can be calculated by means of its definition through joint probabilities .",
    "application of the markov properties of the underlying process @xmath14 finally yields    @xmath37    in general , this expression deviates from the single conditioned pdf @xmath38 .",
    "therefore , noisy measurements on perfect markov processes in general lose their markov property due to the inexact measurement procedure .",
    "referring to section [ sect : introduction ] this means , that a single point from a noisy measurement on a markov process , @xmath39 , not in any case is sufficient for a proper prediction of the future dynamics of the measured data .",
    "this makes sense , since the intrinsic state of the system , @xmath40 , hardly can be estimated from just one single measurement due to the measurement uncertainty .",
    "rather , the consideration of a couple of noisy measurements , @xmath41 , can enhance the accuracy of the predicted probability of @xmath42 .",
    "at least for three simple cases , expression ( [ eqn : markovnoise ] ) can be investigated analytically .",
    "first , markov properties are retrieved for the trivial case @xmath43 , where actually no measurement noise is present .",
    "second , ( [ eqn : markovnoise ] ) can be evaluated for @xmath44 . in this case",
    ", the entangled process itself does not show any correlations . frequently , this approximately is true for large time increments between individual measurements .",
    "if so , the integrals disentangle and the noisy measurements themselves turn out to be independent of one another , @xmath45 .",
    "thus , the measured variable @xmath46 satisfies markov properties .",
    "third , noisy measurements can be considered , that sample the process much faster than the intrinsic dynamics of the entangled variable , @xmath22 .",
    "therefore , @xmath47 is a reasonable approximation of the transition pdf on consecutive measurements .",
    "moreover , only purely non - systematic , gaussian measurement noise with variance @xmath48 is taken into account . in this case ,",
    "evaluation of expression ( [ eqn : markovnoise ] ) yields @xmath49\\\\\\nonumber&\\times\\frac{\\int dx_0\\ \\sqrt\\frac{1}{2\\pi\\sigma^2/3}\\exp\\left[-\\frac{\\left(x_0-\\frac{1}{3}\\left(y_2+y_1+y_0\\right)\\right)^2}{2\\sigma^2/3}\\right]p_x(x_0)}{\\int dx_0\\ \\sqrt\\frac{1}{2\\pi\\sigma^2/2}\\exp\\left[-\\frac{\\left(x_0-\\frac{1}{2}\\left(y_1+y_0\\right)\\right)^2}{2\\sigma^2/2}\\right]p_x(x_0)}\\quad.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the latter factor , two different convolutions occur in numerator and denominator : the stationary pdf @xmath50 is convoluted with gaussian pdfs with different standard deviations , centred at the average value of @xmath51 and @xmath52 , respectively .",
    "therefore , this expression generally depends on the value @xmath53 and conflicts with markov properties of @xmath24 .",
    "we would like to emphasize , that the approximation of a persistent entangled process is feasible for fast but noisy measurements on rather slow processes .",
    "the current case reveals the loss of markov properties on the very small time scales for these kind of measurements , that does not stem from its intrinsic dynamics but , purely , from uncertainties during the measurement process .",
    "let us now elucidate the findings of the latter section by means of two examples .",
    "first , the influence of discretization noise on the properties of a simple deterministic process is investigated . by construction , the violation of the chapman - kolmogorov equation can be demonstrated .",
    "second , the influence of gaussian measurement noise on the markov properties of a stochastic process at relatively high time lag is considered .",
    "the effect of measurement noise becomes obvious from the inspection of conditional pdfs obtained by numerical integration of the chapman - kolmogorov equation ( [ eqn : chap - kol ] ) .",
    "we consider the elementary process @xmath54\\quad.\\ ] ] it is the general solution of the ordinary differential equation @xmath55 .",
    "since the dynamics are of first order in time , the one dimensional process @xmath14 can be specified by one initial condition and , therefore , is markovian . due to the deterministic character , the conditional transition pdf for the variable @xmath22 in the time interval @xmath23 complies with @xmath56",
    "the process apparently is not stationary , since no forcing is present .",
    "the conditional transition pdfs , however , do not depend on time explicitly .",
    "we now consider the statistics of an ensemble of measurements , whose initial positions @xmath57 of the individual processes are distributed according to @xmath58 .     example of a process @xmath14 according to eqn .",
    "( [ eqn : zerfall ] ) , that is affected by strong discretization noise . here , the faint line specifies the original process @xmath14 , whereas the bold line depicts the evolution @xmath24 , that eventually is obtained from the measurement due to discretization errors.,width=302 ]    we assume that the exact intrinsic variable @xmath22 is entangled due to discretization errors , that occur during an imaginary measurement procedure .",
    "therefore , the exact , continuous variables @xmath22 are mapped to a finite set of discrete variables @xmath59 according to the rule @xmath60 here , the intervals @xmath61 $ ] and @xmath62 $ ] associated with the variables @xmath63 and @xmath64 are connected to one another by the requirements @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "moreover it is implied , that any measured value @xmath22 can be mapped by means of ( [ eqn : sample_map ] ) .",

    "the discretization noise can be specified in compliance with the notation of the latter section by the conditional pdf @xmath68 the effect of discretization noise on the initial variable @xmath22 is illustrated in figure [ fig : zerfall_diskret ] .",
    "as @xmath46 only assumes discrete values @xmath69 , the normalisation of the latter pdf for any @xmath22 is guaranteed by the equation @xmath70    we now would like to demonstrate the loss of markov properties due to the discretization of the signal . in principle , eqn .",
    "( [ eqn : markovnoise ] ) directly could be evaluated numerically for the ensemble under consideration . however , in this case the invalidity of the chapman - kolmogorov equation ( [ eqn : chap - kol ] ) nicely can be utilized for this purpose .",
    "analogous to eqn .",
    "( [ eqn : markovnoise ] ) , the transition pdf conditioned on a single point can be specified , @xmath71 application of the particular transition pdfs ( [ eqn : zerfall_x_cpdf ] ) and ( [ eqn : zerfall_xi_cpdf ] ) yields @xmath72 if the process @xmath24 would obey markov properties , the discrete version of the chapman - kolmogorov equation , @xmath73 would have to be fulfilled for any choice of @xmath74 , @xmath53 and @xmath23 . for @xmath75 with @xmath76 and @xmath77 ,",
