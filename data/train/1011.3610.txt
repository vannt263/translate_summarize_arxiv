    "nonclassical states of light are central to quantum optics .",
    "their importance comes from potential applications on advanced optics , as teleportation @xcite , quantum computation @xcite , quantum communication @xcite , quantum cryptography @xcite , quantum lithography @xcite , etc .",
    "a number of schemes have been proposed for generating such states @xcite . among them , a method has been presented for generating superpositions of css of a cavity field via degenerate raman interaction @xcite . in this paper , we have followed the same approach and suggested a theoretical scheme for generating the gkcss which are temporally stable , via the intensity - dependent degenerate raman interaction .",
    "it is worth to mention that , we have used the intensity - dependent modified effective hamiltonian which describes appropriately the dynamics of the interaction between atom and field .",
    "this is while , to the best of our knowledge , no scheme for generation of gkcss may be found in the earlier literature .",
    "the degenerate raman interaction describes the interaction between a degenerate @xmath23-type three - level atom ( as shown in fig . 1 ) and a single - mode radiation field characterized by bosonic operators @xmath24 .",
    "various properties of this system have been previously discussed @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian for such a system in the interaction picture is given by : @xmath25 where we have set @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the two degenerate lower states and @xmath29 is the upper state of the atom , the coupling constant of the transition between @xmath29 and @xmath30 with the cavity field is denoted by @xmath31 , @xmath32 is detuning , where @xmath33 is the cavity field frequency , @xmath34 is the energy of the two lower states and @xmath35 is the energy for the upper level of the atom . on the other side , to describe the degenerate raman interaction , an effective hamiltonian was derived by agarwal in @xcite , when the atomic transition between the upper and lower levels is far from the frequency of the field mode . indeed ,",
    "after adiabatically eliminating the upper level , the author introduced the effective hamiltonian as : @xmath36 where @xmath37 indicates the effective atom - field coupling constant .",
    "in fact , in the effective hamiltonian approach , the two lower levels are coupled with a single - mode field through a virtual upper level . as a result",
    ", the degenerate raman interaction is reduced to an effective two - level system .",
    "also , the effective hamiltonian given in ( [ effective hamiltonian1 ] ) leads to the elimination of time - dependent phase factors in ( [ interaction hamiltonian ] ) .",
    "these factors are related to the ac stark shifts of energy levels @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian that represents the stark shifts of energy levels is given by : @xmath38    where @xmath39 describes the stark shift of the state @xmath40 .",
    "hence , one may modify the effective hamiltonian given in ( [ effective hamiltonian1 ] ) , so that it includes the ac stark effects represented in ( [ ac stark ] ) . in this way , for the modified effective hamiltonian",
    ", one has then @xcite @xmath41 inserting @xmath42 and @xmath43 respectively from ( [ effective hamiltonian1 ] ) and ( [ ac stark ] ) in ( [ sum hamiltonian ] ) , the modified effective hamiltonian can be written as follows : @xmath44 it is found that , the modified effective hamiltonian @xmath45 is more suitable than the well - known effective hamiltonian @xmath42 in studying the time evolution of the systems .",
    "xu and zhang in @xcite showed that , in the degenerate raman interaction , far off - resonant ( enough large value of @xmath46 ) , the modified effective hamiltonian has been given in ( [ modified effective hamiltonian ] ) , can be applied instead of the hamiltonian in the interaction picture in ( [ interaction hamiltonian ] ) .",
    "in fact , starting from a unique state vector at @xmath47 , both of the hamiltonians lead to the same state vector of atom - field system at any time @xmath48 .",
    "altogether , several other mathematical physics methods were suggested to obtain the modified effective hamiltonian in @xcite .",
    "generalization of the single - mode to two - mode degenerate raman process has been recently done in @xcite . but , to achieve our aim of the paper , we should generalize the single - mode degenerate raman interaction in a rather different way .",
    "indeed , following the path of knight in @xcite and specifically zheng in @xcite , we replace the bosonic operators @xmath24 in ( [ modified effective hamiltonian ] ) with @xmath49 , i.e. , the generalized @xmath1-deformed ladder operator .",
    "this type of generalization may be arisen from the same procedure of degenerate raman interaction , briefly illustrated in the previous section , with the difference that the interaction between the same @xmath23-type atom and a single - mode radiation field is now considered to be intensity - dependent .",
    "henceforth , analogously to ( [ interaction hamiltonian ] ) one may suggest the following form for the hamiltonian of such a system in the interaction picture @xmath50 in the same way , analogously to ( [ modified effective hamiltonian ] ) , for the intensity - dependent modified effective hamiltonian we suggest @xmath51 clearly , inserting @xmath52 in ( [ tamim interaction hamiltonian ] ) and ( [ tamim effective hamiltonian ] ) recovers the usual degenerate raman interaction ( intensity independent coupling ) introduced in ( [ interaction hamiltonian ] ) and ( [ modified effective hamiltonian ] ) , respectively . this type of generalization ( of degenerate raman interaction ) to intensity - dependent interaction can be frequently found in the literature , for instance , whenever one imposes nonlinearity on the standard jcm @xcite .",
    "before we proceed , to establish the above formal approach more explicitly , the following discussion may be offered .",
    "as mentioned , when @xmath46 is enough large , the equivalence of the introduced hamiltonian in ( [ interaction hamiltonian ] ) and ( [ modified effective hamiltonian ] ) are demonstrated in @xcite .",
    "our aim at this stage is to prove that , in the nonlinear degenerate raman interaction , under particular conditions , the nonlinear modified effective hamiltonian in ( [ tamim effective hamiltonian ] ) can be applied appropriately instead of the nonlinear hamiltonian in the interaction picture introduced in ( [ tamim interaction hamiltonian ] ) . to investigate the validity of our proposal ,",
    "we will obtain the time evolution of the state vector of the atom - field system by using ( [ tamim interaction hamiltonian ] ) and ( [ tamim effective hamiltonian ] ) , and continue with showing that for enough large value of @xmath46 , these two state vectors are equal .",
    "for this purpose , we suppose that the atom is initially in a superposition of @xmath28 and @xmath27 : @xmath53 and the field is in the arbitrary state : @xmath54 where @xmath55 determines the initial state of the field .",
    "the state of the atom - field system at @xmath47 is thus given by : @xmath56 the time evolution of the state of the atom - field system , governed by @xmath57 introduced in ( [ tamim interaction hamiltonian ] ) , is the solution of : @xmath58 where @xmath59 , denotes the state of the atom - field system after time @xmath48 .",
    "the following general solution may be considered as : @xmath60 .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the problem is now determining the time dependent coefficients which may be obtained by lengthy but straightforward calculations with the following final results : @xmath61 @xmath62 @xmath63 where we have set @xmath64 @xmath65 @xmath66 @xmath67 @xmath68 with the following definitions : @xmath69 @xmath70 on the other side , if we use @xmath71 introduced in ( [ tamim effective hamiltonian ] ) for obtaining the time evolution of the state of the atom - field , we have to solve the equation @xmath72 where @xmath73 denotes the state of the atom - field system after time @xmath48 .",
    "the general solution may be given by @xmath74   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath75 @xmath76 here we have set @xmath77 @xmath78 @xmath79 when @xmath80 namely @xmath46 be enough large and @xmath81 which means that evolving time is not too long , one has : @xmath82 @xmath83 therefore , by using the two above approximations we have : @xmath84 @xmath85 and consequently , @xmath86 as it is observed , we established that in the nonlinear degenerate raman interaction , whenever @xmath46 be enough large , the state vectors given in ( [ halate system t barhamkonesh ] ) and ( [ halate system t moaser ] ) will be equal .",
    "therefore , in the nonlinear degenerate raman interaction , when @xmath46 be enough large , the nonlinear modified effective hamiltonian is equivalent to the nonlinear hamiltonian in the interaction picture .",
    "now , in the remainder of the paper , we want to present our theoretical scheme for generating temporal stable gkcss via the introduced intensity - dependent degenerate raman interaction , while the atom - field interaction is described by the modified effective hamiltonian given in ( [ tamim effective hamiltonian ] ) .",
    "it is worth to notice that , without loss of generality , @xmath87 is assumed in ( [ tamim effective hamiltonian ] ) for continuing the calculational works , thus one has @xmath88 .",
    "so , one arrives at the modified effective hamiltonian as follows : @xmath89 using the expression of @xmath90 , it may be readily seen that the effective hamiltonian in ( [ tamim modified effective hamiltonian ] ) can be explicitly re - written as : @xmath91 inserting @xmath92 in ( [ modified effective hamiltonian ] ) and then comparing the recasted relation with ( [ tamime effective hamiltonian , rewrite ] ) , the above development can be , in a sense , considered simply as generalizing @xmath93 to @xmath94 .",
    "this result may be viewed as intensity - dependent atom - field coupling .    now",
    ", suppose that the cavity field is initially prepared in the nonlinear cs introduced in ( [ bast nonlin ] ) . also , the flux of the atoms injected into the cavity is such a low that there exists at most one atom at a time inside the cavity .",
    "if the first atom be initially in a superposition of @xmath27 and @xmath28 , such that @xmath95 the state of the atom - field system at @xmath47 is thus given by : @xmath96 using the time evolution of the state of atom - field described by : @xmath97 with @xmath98 in ( [ tamime effective hamiltonian , rewrite ] ) and the initial state in ( [ first atom+field at t=0 ] ) , the state of the atom - field system after time @xmath48 is given by : @xmath99   |g , n\\rangle\\nonumber \\\\        & + & [ ( 1+\\varepsilon_{1 } ) e^{2i\\lambda n f^2(n)t}+(1-\\varepsilon_{1})]|e , n\\rangle\\ \\}.",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the atomic velocities can be controlled such that every atom interacts for a fixed time @xmath100 , with the radiation field inside the cavity .",
    "suppose that the atom which is exiting the cavity is detected in the state @xmath27 , so the cavity field certainly collapses to @xmath101   |n\\rangle ,   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath102 is an appropriate normalization factor that may be determined .",
    "inserting @xmath103 from ( [ bast nonlin ] ) in ( [ ( first atom)field at tau ] ) one can rewrite the field state as @xmath104!}\\;e^{2i\\lambda n f^2(n)\\tau}|n\\rangle\\nonumber\\\\        + & ( 1-\\varepsilon_{1 } ) & \\mathbf{\\mathcal{n}}(|z|^2 ) \\sum_{n=0 } ^{\\infty }         \\frac{z^n}{\\sqrt{n!}\\ ; [ f(n)]!}\\;|n\\rangle\\}.    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is worth mentioning the fact that the normalization coefficient @xmath18 for both nonlinear cs and gkcs is exactly the same .",
    "noticing that @xmath105 , at last the state in ( [ vazeh ] ) can be written as @xmath106 ,    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath107 is a gkcs introduced in ( [ final bast gk z , alpha ] ) with @xmath108 .",
    "it is clear from ( [ ( first atom)field at tau , temporall+nonlinear ] ) that we have arrived at a superposition of gkcs and initial nonlinear cs .",
    "now , if one prepares the atom in the initial state ( [ first atom ] ) with @xmath109 , namely the probabilities of the presence of the atom in @xmath27 and @xmath28 are equal , the cavity field will collapse to @xmath110 .",
    "so , we have successfully generated a temporal stable state from initial nonlinear cs @xmath7 that is not temporally stable .",
    "now , assume that the second atom is injected into the cavity , while it is initially in the state described by @xmath111 if the second atom also interacts for a time @xmath100 , with the cavity field which is described by ( [ ( first atom)field at tau ] ) and then , it is detected in the state @xmath27 , the cavity field collapses to @xmath112 where again @xmath113 is a normalization constant . similar to the procedures we followed in ( [ ( first atom)field at tau])-([(first atom)field at tau , temporall+nonlinear ] ) , the state in ( [ ( second atom)field at tau ] ) can be re - written as @xmath114 ,    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have set @xmath115 .",
    "now , once again when the first and second atoms are initially prepared in @xmath116 , i.e. , @xmath117 , the cavity field would be in @xmath118 , i.e. , in the gkcs .    by further iteration of the above procedure",
    "it is easy to show that if the @xmath119th atom is initially in the state @xmath120 and we enter @xmath121 atoms into the cavity , one by one , we can generate a superposition of @xmath121 temporally stable gkcss and the initial state of the cavity field @xmath7 that is not temporally stable .",
    "when all of @xmath121 atoms that are exiting one by one from the cavity are detected in the state @xmath27 , the state of the cavity field is given by @xmath122 ,    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath123 is an appropriate normalization constant and @xmath124 .",
    "again , if @xmath125 @xmath126 , then @xmath127 and @xmath128 . as a result , the cavity field would be in @xmath129 which is exactly in the gkcss family .",
    "we end this section with noticing that , the initial state of the cavity , i.e. , nonlinear cs may be generated experimentally . as an evidence recall that the generation of photon - added coherent states as a well - known class of nonlinear css reported by zavatta et al in @xcite .",
    "also , a theoretical scheme for generation of any class of nonlinear css in a micromaser using the intensity - dependent jaynes - cummings model was introduced in @xcite .",
    "in summary , using the intensity - dependent degenerate raman interaction procedure has been introduced in the present paper and assuming the cavity field to be initially in the nonlinear cs ( which is not temporally stable ) , the atoms that are in a superposition of the states @xmath28 and @xmath27 are sent inside the cavity , one by one . the atomic velocity can be controlled such that every atom interacts with the cavity field for a specific time interval @xmath100 .",
    "if each of the atoms , which is exiting from the cavity is detected in the state @xmath27 , the cavity field collapses to a superposition of gkcss and initial nonlinear cs . if @xmath121 atoms are sent inside the cavity , superposition of @xmath121 gkcss and the initial state of the cavity will be generated .",
    "preparing the initial state of the atom , such that the probabilities of being every atom in states @xmath28 and @xmath27 are equal , then the generated states reduce to a gkcs .",
    "in fact , we have generated temporally stable gkcs from a nonlinear cs which does not have this property .",
    "in addition to these , we have found a more deep insight to the physical foundation of gkcss , where we observed that according to our proposal , the parameter @xmath130 in the phase factor of gkcss in ( [ final bast gk z , alpha ] ) explicitly depends on @xmath93 ( the effective coupling constant of the atom - field ) and @xmath100 ( the time of the interaction between atom and field ) .",
    "altogether , our proposal may be considered as the first step in producing the gkcss .",
    "we hope that the proposed theoretical scheme will stimulate further better approaches to study the gkcss , experimentally .",
