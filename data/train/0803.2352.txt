    "such neural populations are usually spatially localized and contain both excitatory and inhibitory neurons @xcite .",
    "the simplest model to display features of neural interaction consists of two coupled neural systems . starting from this simplest network motif",
    ", larger networks can be built , and their effects may be studied . for example , starting from two interconnected reticular thalamic neurons with oscillatory behavior , it was shown in @xcite how more complex dynamics emerges in ring networks with nearest neighbors and fully reciprocal connectivity , or in networks organized in a two - dimensional array with proximal connectivity and `` dense proximal '' coupling in which every neuron connects to all other neurons within some radius . in another example @xcite , a neural population was itself modeled as a small sub - network of excitable elements , to study hierarchically clustered organization of excitable elements in a _ network of networks_.    most studies represent a population as an effective oscillatory element that is then coupled with other populations to study synchronization and network effects @xcite . in these studies ,",
    "the basis for the emergence of complex network dynamics is the _ oscillatory _ behavior of neural elements , in spite of the fact that individual neural systems are usually in a stable steady state exhibiting _ excitable _ dynamics when perturbed .",
    "a reason is that self - sustained oscillatory behavior in the individual element is required to define synchronization of subsystems @xcite .",
    "one way to resolve this is to add weak gaussian white noise to each individual element to generate sparse poisson - like irregular spiking patterns , as seen in real neurons @xcite .    in this report",
    ", we introduce a time - delayed coupling into the model of two excitable populations and demonstrate that the coupling - delay can induce sustained oscillations between the two subsystems .",
    "we find a regime of bistability between the stable fixed point and limit cycle oscillations for sufficiently large delay times @xmath0 and coupling strength @xmath1 . as the mechanism for these delay - induced oscillations",
    "we identify a saddle - node bifurcation of limit cycles .",
    "this result suggests the use of a compound system of two time - delayed coupled excitable elements as a minimal network motif to investigate oscillatory behavior in more complex networks .",
    "we examine the delayed linear symmetric coupling of two identical neural populations .",
    "each population is represented by a simplified fitzhugh - nagumo ( fhn ) system @xcite , which is widely used as a paradigmatic model of excitable systems @xcite .",

    "the value of the excitability parameter @xmath5 determines whether the subsystem is excitable ( @xmath6 ) or exhibits self - sustained periodic firing ( @xmath7 ) .",

    "the interaction between the two neural populations is modelled as diffusive , i.e. , the coupling vanishes if the variables @xmath15 are identical . the coupling strength @xmath1",

    "these studies consider _ neural fields _",
    "@xcite , that is , they extend over one or more spatial dimensions .",
    "while neural field models adopt the continuum limit of a network , we consider the minimal network motif , i.e. , two discrete subsystems , but in both cases the biophysical reason to include delay is the same .    the generic biophysical interpretation of the fhn model is based on a single point - like neuron and was originally not derived from features of a neural population .",
    "the variable @xmath17 models fast changes of the electrical potential across the membrane ( spikes ) , and @xmath18 is related to the gating mechanism of membrane channels @xcite . on the contrary ,",
    "a neural population is generically described by a time coarse - grained mean - field model , in which the dynamical variables represent averaged spiking rates @xcite .",
    "notwithstanding , spiking rates in neural populations can exhibit both steady state values and relaxation oscillations .",
    "both states are described by the fhn mechanism with @xmath19 and @xmath9 , respectively , which justifies the fhn model for `` point - like '' populations . to avoid confusion about spikes vs.  spiking rates , a model of uncoupled subsystems as defined by eq .",

    "@xmath0 the oscillation is readily understood as the two units firing alternately , each spike initiated by the delayed signal of the remote system .",
