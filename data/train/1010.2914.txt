    "several articles have recently focused on the electrocaloric effect ( ece ) in ferroelectrics and related materials,@xcite which bears analogy with the well known magnetocaloric effect ( mce).@xcite here we investigate the mechanisms of ece in relaxor ferroelectrics , to be referred to as _ relaxors _ and normal ferroelectrics ( or _ ferroelectrics _ ) , and discuss the specific features of these two groups of materials . in particular , we will discuss the possibility of achieving a giant ece in bulk inorganic relaxors and ferroelectric materials as well as in organic polymers .",
    "these systems offer the prospect of practical applications , such as miniaturized and energy efficient cooling devices , without the need for large electric currents commonly associated with the mce .",
    "a crucial physical quantity in ece is the change of entropy of a polar material under the application and/or removal of an external electric field .",
    "for example , when the electric field is turned on isothermally , the elementary dipolar entities in the system will become partially ordered and the entropy will be lowered .",
    "the entropy lowering of the dipolar subsystem is then compensated by an increase of the temperature of the total system , which characterizes the ece .",
    "the degree of lowering depends on the number of statistically significant configurations in the initial and final states of the system , as well as on the size of the average dipole moment and the volume density of dipolar entities .",
    "other factors may also play a role : if the system undergoes a first order phase transition under the action of external electric field , the entropy will be enhanced on crossing the borderline between the two phases , resulting in a larger ece .",
    "the line of first order transition points terminates at a critical point where the transition becomes continuous,@xcite and it will be of special interest to investigate the behavior of ece in the vicinity of the critical point .",
    "estimates of the ece can be made on the basis of thermodynamic maxwell relations using the measured heat capacity and the field and temperature dependence of the dielectric polarization . from the theoretical point of view ,",
    "a central problem is how to make predictions about the temperature and field dependence of ece . as a first step",
    ", one needs to develop an appropriate phenomenological and/or mesoscopic model , which incorporates the specific physical features of the systems . here",
    "we will make use of the standard landau phenomenological model , which can be applied to both relaxors and ferroelectrics with the corresponding choice of landau coefficients .",
    "these in turn can be derived from the mesoscopic model of the material under study . in the case of relaxors ,",
    "the mesoscopic model of choice is the spherical random bond ",
    "random field ( srbrf ) model , which is based on the concept of reorientable polar nanoregions ( pnrs).@xcite thus we should be able to compare the ece in relaxors and ferroelectrics , and determine the parameters , which control the ece in these systems .",
    "finally , using general principles of statistical thermodynamics we will discuss the existence of a theoretical upper bound on the ece and argue that it satisfies a universal relation , which is , in principle , also applicable to mce .",
    "the temperature change of a polar system under adiabatic electric field variation from the initial value @xmath3 to final value @xmath4 can be written in the form @xcite @xmath5 which follows from the thermodynamic maxwell relation @xmath6 involving the entropy density @xmath7 and the physical dielectric polarization @xmath8 ( in units of c / m@xmath9 ) . the volume specific heat at constant field is given by @xmath10 .    in deriving eq .",

    "we will apply eq .",
    "( [ dt3 ] ) in order to discuss the predictions of landau theory in two characteristic cases , namely , normal ferroelectrics and relaxors .",
    "as already mentioned , in landau theory of phase transitions in ferroelectrics , the coefficients @xmath53 in eq .",
    "( [ f ] ) are assumed temperature independent and @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the curie - weiss temperature .",

    "writing @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the curie constant , we find : @xmath69 for @xmath70 , a critical point will be located at @xmath71 , where @xcite @xmath72 turning next to relaxors , we assume that the relevant elementary dipolar entities at temperatures around the dielectric maximum are polar nanoregions or pnrs . according to the srbrf model,@xcite these pnrs are coupled through gaussian random interactions @xmath73 ( `` random bonds '' ) and are subject to gaussian random fields @xmath74 .",
    "in zero applied field , spontaneous long range order is suppressed @xmath75 .",
    "this means that for a relaxor we can still use the free energy ( [ f ] ) , however , the coefficient @xmath76 must remain positive at all temperatures .",
    "thus , for @xmath61 and @xmath62 there can be no second order phase transition .",
    "the explicit form of @xmath76 follows from eq .",
    "( [ es1 ] ) , namely , @xmath77 where @xmath78 represents the ( quasi)static linear field - cooled dielectric susceptibility .",
    "this can be derived from the srbrf model of relaxors:@xcite @xmath79 with @xmath80 the effective curie constant @xmath68 is given explicitly in terms of the average squared dipole moments @xmath81 of pnrs , namely , @xmath82 , and the average volume @xmath83 associated with a pnr .",
    "later , we will also introduce the saturation polarization @xmath84 , where @xmath85 . for simplicity , we will henceforth neglect the difference between @xmath86 and @xmath87 , and write @xmath88 .",

    "typically , in relaxors one finds @xmath103 , implying that random bonds are effectively much stronger than random fields .",
    "this allows pnrs to reorient collectively under the action of external fields and relax towards equilibrium . in the opposite case , @xmath104 , pnrs are would be trapped in a frozen static configuration of random fields and no characteristic low - frequency relaxor response due to pnr flipping could be observed .",

    "larger values of @xmath13 in ferroelectrics rather than in relaxors are mainly due to the sharp decrease of @xmath143 in relaxors at @xmath184 ( cf .",

    "however , this does not mean that ferroelectrics are better candidates for achieving giant ece .",

    "moreover , the above comparison between relaxors and ferroelectrics makes only sense if the coefficients @xmath185 are indeed the same in both cases .",
    "therefore , in discussing the ece in specific systems one should carefully consider the actual physical values of all the relevant model parameters , as discussed in the following section .",
    "it has been observed experimentally in a variety of systems that the entropy change @xmath186 in eq .",

    "thus , in relaxors , @xmath190 is expected to be a function of temperature with @xmath195 .    using the relations ( [ dt4 ] ) and ( [ ds ] ) , the ece temperature change @xmath13 can be written as @xmath196 a quadratic relation of the same form is predicted by eq .",
    "( [ dt5 ] ) if the terms @xmath47 , @xmath197 , ... etc . are neglected .",
    "it is exactly true in the case @xmath55 discussed in section iii .",
    "clearly , the above relation is applicable only in the _ quadratic _ regime where the empirical eq .",
    "( [ ds ] ) is valid .",
    "the parameter @xmath190 can be determined directly from the measured ece temperature change @xmath13 , with @xmath12 extracted from dielectric experiments . alternatively , and especially in ferroelectrics or relaxors at temperatures above the freezing temperature",

    "( [ dt6 ] ) .",
    "it turns out , however , that the values of @xmath13 measured directly may differ from the ones deduced from dielectric data .",

    "another possibility is that the empirical relation eq .",
    "( [ ds ] ) is an effective quasi - linear relation observed in a broad range of large field values , while its derivation based on the landau expansion is by assumption restricted to small fields .",
    "we can obtain an estimate for the maximum ece temperature change @xmath205 by assuming that in a sufficiently strong electric field the polarization reaches its saturation value @xmath88 .",

    "obviously , the expansion ( [ s1 ] ) can not be applied due to convergence problems . on the other hand ,",

    ", eq .  ( [ dtm3 ] ) implies that the polarization or magnetization must have reached complete saturation . in the dielectric case",
    ", this requires large electric fields with the already mentioned possibility of dielectric breakdown . in the magnetic case , however , extremely large fields of the order of @xmath233  t may be necessary .",
    "( [ dtm3 ] ) is valid in the saturation regime @xmath234 , typically at low temperatures , where @xmath235 is expected to be temperature dependent . in ferroelectrics",
    ", the formation of domains should be taken into account , and the entropy limit @xmath236 could only be reached in very high fields . in relaxors , there is an additional difficulty that the relaxation of pnrs at low temperatures is extremely slow and the above limit can only be reached after very long times .    at high temperatures , @xmath235 normally approaches a certain limit .",
    "in metals one has @xmath237 according to the dulong - petit law , which is generally not valid for complex solids .",
    "for example , in perovskites , @xmath238.@xcite thus , the maximum ece in perovskites at high temperatures is of the order @xmath239 .",
    "this limit applies to a large group of perovskites , i.e. , paraelectrics , ferroelectrics , relaxors , etc .",
    "specifically , for @xmath37 ( see table i ) , we find @xmath240 .",
    "for example , if the system can support large electric fields such that @xmath241  k , this would lead to a giant ece temperature change @xmath242  k at room temperature .",
    "this exceeds roughly by a factor of @xmath243 the estimated values for perovskites in table  i , which were derived from the physical values of the parameters @xmath219 , @xmath68 , and @xmath31 .",
    "in this paper , we studied the mechanism of ece in relaxor ferroelectrics ( or _ relaxors _ ) and in normal ferroelectrics ( referred to as _ ferroelectrics _ ) .",
    "starting from the widely accepted result for the ece temperature change @xmath134 , based on the thermodynamic maxwell relation , we derived an alternative expression which could directly be applied in theoretical model calculations .",
    "the results for @xmath134 have been obtained in two physical regimes of field - temperature variables @xmath127 .",
    "the first of these is the so - called _ quadratic _ regime , where @xmath13 is proportional to the square of the dielectric polarization @xmath12 , and the second the _ saturation _ regime , where @xmath12 is allowed to reach its maximum value @xmath219 .    in the quadratic regime",
    ", the system can be described by the landau - type free energy model , in which the harmonic landau coefficient @xmath76 depends on the physical nature of the system , i.e. , the behavior of @xmath76 in relaxors differs from that of ferroelectrics .",
    "the anharmonic coefficients @xmath53 , which are common to both cases , then determine the critical behavior of the system in a field @xmath49 .",
    "the case @xmath61 does not show any pronounced anomalies . for @xmath2 , the polarization @xmath8 and",
    "hence @xmath13 rises steeply in a relaxor near the isolated critical point @xmath244 , whereas in a ferroelectric , the largest effect occurs near the first order phase transition in zero field , which is absent in the relaxor case .",
    "the ece efficiency @xmath181 shows a similar behavior in both cases , and at higher fields the same asymptotic values are found . of course",
    ", these conclusions only apply provided that all the remaining physical features , such as the number of equilibrium orientations @xmath36 of the elementary dipolar entities , etc .",
    ", are the same in both cases .",
    "experimentally , the ece entropy change in the _ quadratic _ regime is found to behave as @xmath245 , which is trivially reproduced by the landau model .",
    "the coefficient @xmath190 tends to have larger values in relaxors , leading to a stronger ece . in irradiated organic polymer relaxors ,",
    "this can be explained by the larger number of polar nanoregions ( pnrs ) and thus a smaller average pnr volume @xmath209 . in the _ saturation _ regime",
    ", the entropy of the dipolar subsystem generally approaches the negative value of the configuration entropy , @xmath246 , and the maximum ece value @xmath205 thus crucially depends on the orientational degeneracy @xmath36 .",
