    "wide - area multiwavelength surveys such as the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; @xcite ) and the ukirt ( uk infrared telescope ) deep sky survey @xcite have enabled the study of large , statistical samples of galaxies .",
    "however , such surveys are generally limited to low redshifts ( @xmath7 ) , a single facility , and one region of the electromagnetic spectrum  usually the ultraviolet , optical or near - infrared . to produce a comprehensive picture of galaxy evolution",
    ", one must observe galaxies over an extensive range of wavelengths to probe multiple physical properties .",
    "this requires the combination of multiple data sets across observatories and instruments , and thus the consolidation of disparate sensitivities , resolutions and data reduction techniques ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "obtaining a consistent , optically - motivated photometric catalogue for large multiwavelength datasets is highly non - trivial @xcite .",
    "naively position matching existing catalogues gives rise to the possibility of table mismatches , especially when joining high - resolution ( resolution @xmath0 0.8 ) optical data to low - resolution far - infrared data ( resolution @xmath018 ) .",
    "disparate data reduction methods , even though they may represent the most appropriate photometry in each individual band , may use differently sized and shaped apertures for the same object and hence probe different physical scales .",
    "more subtly , the different means of calculating errors by different survey teams will affect the quality of spectral energy distribution ( sed ) fits for a particular galaxy .",
    "@xcite show that the use of a multiwavelength catalogue derived using the same data reduction procedure across the full wavelength range results in reduced photometric inconsistency , and improves the accuracy of sed fits and star formation rate estimators compared to an equivalent catalogue constructed from table matching alone .",
    "one technique to construct a consistent multiwavelength catalogue is a variation of ( forced ) matched aperture photometry , proceeding initially with aperture definition on a high - resolution image .",
    "the apertures are then propagated to the lower resolution data after convolution with the point spread function and appropriate deblending .",
    "software packages implementing this technique include tfit @xcite and the lambda - adaptive multiband deblending algorithm in r ( lambdar ; @xcite ) .",
    "one dataset that lends itself to the construction of such a catalogue is the galaxy and mass assembly ( gama ; @xcite ) survey .",
    "gama is a highly complete low - redshift spectroscopic and multiwavelength imaging campaign that aims to characterise the distribution of energy , mass and structure from kiloparsec to megaparsec scales .",
    "the gama spectroscopic campaign targeted 230 degrees of sky using the aaomega spectrograph on the 3.9  m anglo - australian telescope , obtaining redshifts for @xmath0250,000 galaxies .",
    "this spectroscopy is complemented by ultra - violet imaging from the _ galaxy evolution explorer _ ( _ galex _ ; @xcite ) , optical imaging from sdss and the kilo - degree survey ( kids ; @xcite ) , near - infrared imagery from the vista ( visible and infrared survey telescope for astronomy ) kilo - degree infrared galaxy ( viking ; @xcite ) survey , mid - infrared imagery from the _ widefield infrared survey explorer _ @xcite and far - infrared imagery from _",

    "the project has examined a wide variety of topics , including the cosmic spectral energy distribution ( e.g. @xcite , andrews et al . in prep ) , star formation rates @xcite , large scale structure ( e.g. @xcite ) , galaxy groups ( e.g. @xcite ) , close pairs ( e.g. @xcite ) and galaxy properties and structure ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the gama survey , while scientifically comprehensive , by design only probes the low redshift universe ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "it is therefore beneficial that an intermediate redshift ( @xmath8 ) equivalent to gama is established in order to explore a broader time baseline .    the cosmological evolution survey ( cosmos ; @xcite ) region , covering 2  deg@xmath1 of sky centred on r.a .",

    "cosmos has been used to study many aspects of galaxy formation and evolution , including the evolution of specific star formation rates ( e.g. @xcite ) , effects of environment on galaxy morphology ( e.g. @xcite ) , high - redshift quasars ( e.g. @xcite ) and dust obscured galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however , the multiwavelength dataset was processed with different flux measurements and reduction methods resulting in a corresponding increase in systematic error .    here , we construct a catalogue of consistent total flux measurements spanning from the far - ultraviolet to the far - infrared for a subregion we shall refer to as g10 and based on existing cosmos imagery .",
    "our catalogue , when combined with the spectroscopic redshifts curated by @xcite , forms an intermediate redshift sample prepared in an identical way to and thus suitable for direct comparison to gama .",

    "the user can also supply a list of contaminants  objects with defined apertures which are fully deblended using the following method , but without flux measurements being performed .",
    "for each image , lambdar optionally convolves input apertures with the psf , giving an aperture function @xmath42 for each object .",

    "the normalization of the aperture functions can be scaled by a set of prior flux weights @xmath43 either supplied by the user or determined using the flux of the central pixel .",

    "the deblended image , i.e. the product of @xmath45 and the image @xmath46 , governs how much flux is assigned to object @xmath25 .",
    "lambdar then performs either psf weighted photometry  which multiplies the deblended image by the aperture function  or aperture photometry , which converts the aperture function into a simple aperture before multiplication .",

    "manual inspections were performed by ska , ljmd , and spd and involved both fixing the primary aperture and fixing , adding or removing apertures down to @xmath48  mag whose centre lies within 1.5 times the revised semi - major axis of the primary object .",
    "inspections and fixes were performed using a bespoke interface written by asgr using the shiny framework .",
    "in addition , any apertures with a semi - major axis less than the subaru @xmath25 psf fwhm of 0.95were replaced with a point source .    however , the above procedure failed to recover the very brightest stars due to positional mismatch . to overcome this issue , we ran sextractor on the cfht @xmath25 band mosaic with default - like settings  varying only the detection threshold ( 3@xmath13 ) , sky background mesh size ( 512 pixels ) and memory settings .",
    "we then position matched this catalogue to the g10/cosmos catalogue to 1and used the cfht aperture parameters for cataids brighter than @xmath57  mag ( as measured on the cfht image ) that were not manually inspected .",
    "this resulted in 2256 apertures ( 1.2 per cent ) being updated .",
    "another potential issue is that apertures in regions requiring complex deblending were systematically larger than their constituent objects .",
    "one such example is presented in the right panel of figure [ fig : shredded ] . to ( partially )",
    "address this problem , we selected objects where the primary aperture has at least five overlapping apertures , or where the weighted sum of the overlapping areas are at least 125 per cent of the area of the primary aperture ( an area that is covered by @xmath58 overlapping apertures is counted @xmath58 times ) .",
    "we performed an internal match of this list to a 6radius , then checked and fixed by eye objects within 6or 1.5 times the semi - major axis of the primary object ( whichever was larger ) .",
    "1209 regions were fixed in this manner .",
    "the aperture catalogue and mosaic were then overlain on screen and visually inspected , with any obvious remaining problems fixed by hand .    in total",
    ", there are 185907 objects in the g10 region , of which 17062 ( 9.2 per cent ) had apertures requiring manual inspection .",
    "this included manually fixing 2785 ( 1.5 per cent ) sources , removing 651 ( 0.3 per cent ) false detections , replacing 1838 ( 1.0 per cent ) with point sources , adding 1722 objects ( 1.0 per cent ) and fixing 1209 ( 0.7 per cent ) regions manually . in this process",
    ", 9480 ( 5.1 per cent ) neighbouring sources were also fixed .",
    "the resulting size - magnitude distribution , analogous to figure [ fig : magsize ] , is shown in figure [ fig : magsize - after ] with the changed apertures denoted with green points .",
    "figure [ fig : unshredded ] is analogous to figure [ fig : shredded ] , but with the manual fixes incorporated .",
    "manual inspections took about one minute each , with total time expended on the order of 100 person - hours .",
    "the total number of objects fixed manually , and the number of potentially problematic apertures remaining , highlights the need for increasing the accuracy of automated aperture determination for the next generation of galaxy surveys , for example the wide area vista extragalactic survey ( waves ; @xcite ) .",
    "these surveys have comparable source density to the cosmos region but instead cover hundreds of square degrees , making manual intervention prohibitively labour intensive .          [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      + @xmath59 @xcite + @xmath60 @xcite + @xmath61 @xcite + @xmath62 @xcite [ tab : extinct ]        we release three sets of catalogues .",
    "the main catalogue contains abridged redshift information from @xcite and fluxes and errors for each band in janskys .",
    "this catalogue contains fluxes corrected for galactic extinction for @xmath63 to @xmath64 inclusive using the @xmath65 values from the @xcite dust maps multiplied by the @xmath66 values given in table [ tab : extinct ] .",
    "objects which have a greater than 0.8positional offset beteen this catalogue and the 2008 cosmos photometric catalogue have been assigned a flags value of 1 . to denote masked regions ,",
    "we propagate the relevant cosmos2015 flag column .",
    "non - matches to cosmos2015 are assigned a mask value equal to their nearest neighbour . for objects that do not have flux measurements due to cascading flux cuts , we assign a flux of -9998 and an error equal to the @xmath35 point source limit as calculated from the median sky rms for 1000 random apertures ( see figure [ fig : sky ] ) .",
    "the fraction of objects assigned upper limits range from 82 per cent in the ultraviolet , 81 per cent for irac 3 and 4 , 94 per cent for mips 24 and pacs , 96 per cent for spire 250 , 98 per cent for spire 350 and 99 per cent for spire 500 and mips 70 .",
    "these are shown by the bottom panel of figure [ fig : summary ] .",
    "figure [ fig : summary ] attempts to summarise our panchromatic catalogue as compared to cosmos2015 , and what one might construct from existing archival photometry .",
    "the upper three panels show , for each catalogue , the colour distribution for the same set of galaxies .",
    "the vertical spread therefore indicates a colour range ( @xmath67 ; where @xmath68 represents each filter in turn ) , each colour band denotes a filter ( @xmath68 ) , and the horizontal spread the redshift range ( @xmath69 ) .",
    "the density of data points reflects the number of objects . to create the sample the three catalogues",
    "were matched and only those galaxies with @xmath70 for both @xmath40 and @xmath68 in all three catalogues selected .",
    "the fourth panel shows the widths of the colour distribution as measured from the 84th-16th percentile range ( i.e. @xmath35 ) which are essentially comparable for all datasets .",
    "finally , the bottom plot shows the fraction of objects with a @xmath35 detection ( dashed line ) , or a limit ( solid line ) . from the @xmath28",
    "to @xmath40 bands all catalogues contain a measurement for all objects . in the fuv and nuv and irac bands",
    "a recorded strong or credible measurement occurs more frequently in the cosmos2015 catalogue , and in the far - ir our catalogue contains more credible measurements than either cosmos2015 or archival data .",
    "however the critical advancement is that our catalogue now contains a measurement or flux limit for every object , essentially increasing the fraction of systems with far - ir constraints from a few per cent to all galaxies in all bands .",
    "additionally we release the catalogues output by lambdar for each of the 38 bands , which provide more detailed photometric measurements and errors , as separate files .",
    "these catalogues also contain warning flags , such as for objects affected by the saturated nan region replacement detailed in section [ sec : phot2 ] .",
    "the fluxes contained in these catalogues are not extinction corrected .",
    "in addition to the new photometry catalogues presented in the work , we also highlight the release of an updated version of the spectroscopic catalogue outlined in @xcite .",
    "this catalogue now incorporates dr3 of the zcosmos @xcite spectra , released in january 2015 ( eso large programme lp175.a-0839 ) and the recent photometric redshift analysis of the cosmos2015 team @xcite .",
    "columns 135 - 139 of the davies et al .",
    "catalogue are updated with the zcosmos dr3 measurements and additional columns 176 - 179 are added for the cosmos2015 best - fit redshift ( ` zp_cosmos2015 ' ) , the 1@xmath13 upper and lower error range ( ` zl68_cosmos2015 ' and ` zh68_cosmos2015 ' ) , and the best fit @xmath71 value ( ` chi2_cosmos2015 ' ) .",
    "we also update the ` z_best ' , ` z_use ' and ` z_gen ' parameters accordingly . to do this",
    ", we undertake a similar process to that outlined in section 4 of @xcite , where we compare redshift measurements across various observations .",
    "however , we now perform matching in comparison to the zcosmos dr3 catalogue instead of the zcosmos - bright 10k catalogue , and to the more recent cosmos2015 photometric redshifts over the original @xcite photometric redshifts . for example",
    ", z_gen==5 now refers to a @xmath72 offset between our autoz measurement and the cosmos2015 photometric redshift .",
    "this updated catalogue yields an increased number of z_use==1 sources ( good high resolution redshift ) , increasing the sample to @xmath73 galaxies , and slightly reducing the spread and outlier rate of comparisons between z_best and zcosmos / primus / photometric redshifts , as displayed in figure 9 of @xcite .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for further details of how the spectroscopic catalogue was constructed , and note that the updated catalogue can be found here : http://cutout.icrar.org/g10/g10cosmoscatv03.tar.gz .",
    "we have produced a 38 band photometric catalogue in cosmos spanning from far - ultraviolet to far - infrared wavelengths in a manner consistent with the equivalent @xcite gama catalogue .",
    "we gathered multiwavelength imagery from the _ galex _ deep imaging survey , cosmos , ultravista , s - cosmos , splash , pep and hermes surveys . from this data , we obtained consistent total flux measurements for a sample of 185,907 sources using lambdar .",
    "this required the construction of an aperture catalogue by manually checking and adjusting raw sextractor output , a process that is prohibitively labour - intensive for the next generation of galaxy surveys .",
    "we demonstrate that the resulting photometric catalogue has accurate astrometry , is consistent with existing photometric datasets and achieves adjacent colour distributions  a proxy for photometric measurement error  comparable to existing data sets .",
    "the released catalogue is complete for objects with @xmath4  mag and partially complete to @xmath48  mag due to a rigid flux cut made prior to the lambdar measurements . as our catalogue is designed for panchromatic analysis , including sed fitting , we tested it for a sample of 5619 galaxies using magphys .",
    "we found improved convergence and goodness of fit with our catalogue compared to table matching archival photometry .",
    "the catalogues and a cutout generator for the multiwavelength imagery used are available at http://cutout.icrar.org/g10/datarelease.php .",
    "this sample will be used in future observations as an input catalogue for a spectroscopic survey to complete the g10 region .",
    "this catalogue will form the basis for a gama - equivalent multiwavelength database at intermediate redshifts .",
    "this database will enable the derivation of physical properties and structural parameters for the cosmos region using the same techniques as gama and enable comparative studies of the cosmic spectral energy distribution ( andrews et al . in prep ) , galaxy structure and morphology , star formation rates ( davies et al . in prep ) , stellar masses ( wright et al . in prep ) and panchromatic measurements of the extragalactic background light @xcite . in combination with further spectroscopic observations of the g10 region",
    ", we will create catalogues of groups ( akin to @xcite ) and large scale structure .",
    "in addition to enabling comparisons to low - redshift galaxy evolution surveys , these catalogues will pave the way for future galaxy evolution surveys such as waves @xcite and provide a basis for optically motivated stacking using 21  cm data from the cosmos hi large extragalactic survey ( chiles ; @xcite ) .",
    "we wish to thank the anonymous referee whose feedback helped improve this manuscript , the splash team for providing early access to their irac images and the cosmos team for the provision of accurate and precise photometric redshifts .",
