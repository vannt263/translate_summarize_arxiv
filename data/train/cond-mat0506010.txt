    "the tunnelling current characteristics of a single electron transistor ( set ) have been extensively studied and interesting physical phenomena , such as coulomb blockade and kondo effect have been found.@xmath0 the main structure of an set consists of three electrodes ( source , drain and gate ) and the active region consists of one or more quantum dots ( qds ) . although the physics of kondo effect is more profound than that of coulomb blockade , the main device application of set is based on the coulomb blockade effect .",
    "the tunnelling current of an set is sensitive to the size of the qd .",
    "the charging energy , @xmath1 , is typically larger than the energy level spacing , @xmath2 , caused by the quantum confinement in large qds .",
    "consequently , the tunnelling current displays a periodic coulomb oscillation with respect to the gate voltage .",
    "this feature of periodic coulomb oscillation is a consequence of homogeneity of @xmath1 and negligible @xmath3 .",
    "however , such a coulomb oscillation was observed only at very low temperature due to the small charging energy .",
    "note that the charging energy must be greater than the thermal energy and tunnelling rate multiplied by @xmath4 in order for an set to operate properly . for application in high temperature sets , nanoscale qds with large charging energy are desired .    to date",
    "two major kinds of nanoscale qds have been used to construct sets : the si / ge qds and the inas / gaas self - assembled quantum dots ( saqds ) .",
    "silicon ( si ) or germanium ( ge ) qds can be miniaturized to reach nanometer scale with advanced fabrication technology .",
    "nanoscale si / ge sets typically display non - periodic coulomb oscillations at room temperatures,@xmath5 as a result of the large charging energy ( @xmath1 ) and the unequally spaced values of @xmath6 , which are comparable to @xmath1 .",
    "even though si / ge sets can operate at room temperatures , it is difficult to gian full understanding of their tunnelling current characteristics because of the multi - valleyed nature of si / ge and the unknown si / ge - sio@xmath7 interface properties .",
    "furthermore , the electron - hole recombination rate in si / ge qds is not large enough for useful application in optoelectronics , since si and ge are indirect - band - gap semiconductors.@xmath8    the inas / gas saqds , on the other hand , are better understood , and because inas is a direct - band - gap semiconductors , sets constructed from inas / gas saqds can have useful application in optoelectronic devices such as single - photon generators and single - photon detectors .",
    "recently , inas / gaas self - assembled quantum dot ( saqd ) embedded in a p - n junction has been employed to generate single - photon emission for application in quantum cryptography.@xmath9 another way to achieve single - photon generation is to use isolated saqd with optical pumping .",
    "such studies have received a great deal of attention recently.@xmath10 the spontaneous emission spectrum of a qd typically exhibits coexisting sharp emission peaks , which have been attributed to the electron - hole recombination in the exciton , trion and biexciton formed in the qd .",
    "the antibunching feature of the emitted single photon in this kind of device has been demonstrated.@xmath11 in addition , gate electrodes have been used in some experiments to manipulate the emission spectrum.@xmath12 .",
    "many theoretical efforts based on the anderson model and keldysh green s function method have been devoted to the studies of transport properties of sets , including the dc and ac tunnelling current.@xmath13 the studies on the ac tunnelling current of set mainly focus on the photon - side band phenomena caused by the microwave pumping@xmath14",
    ". only a handful theoretical studies considered the optical properties of sets .",
    "recently , we have studied the intraband transitions of sets made of inas / gaas saqds for application as an infrared photodetector with operating wavelength near @xmath15.@xmath16 on the other hand , the interband transitions in a qd have been adopted frequently to realize single - photon generation .",
    "theoretical studies of the electronically driven single - photon generator ( spg ) have been reported,@xmath17 whereas theoretical studies on optically pumped sets ( including the coupling with leads ) are still lacking .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to provide a theoretical analysis for such a system .",
    "furthermore , the measurement of exciton binding energy in a qd remains illusive , since in a typical photoluminescence measurement or the emission spectrum of a single qd , one can only observe the exciton recombination , but not the free electron - hole recombination .",
    "the exciton binding energy is an important physical quantity as it provides information about the effective dielectric constant and the charge distribution of electron and hole in the qd . in our current theoretical study",
    ", we will show that via the measurement of the tunnelling current of an set made of a nanoscale qd under optical pumping one can determine the exciton binding energy of a qd unambiguously .",
    "the schematic diagram for the set system considered is shown in fig . 1 . here",
    "a nanoscale qd is embedded in a n - i - n junction .",
    "this is different from the electrically driven spg , where a qd is embedded in a p - n junction .",
    "therefore , the physical process considered here is also quite diffrent . using optical pumping to create electron - hole pairs in the set , one can not only electrically manipulate the single - photon emission spectrum arising from exciton complexes in the qd , but also optically control the tunnelling current of the set . in this paper",
    ", we will consider both the hole - assisted tunnelling current due to optical pumping and the electrode - controlled spontaneous emission spectrum .",
    "our calculation is based on the keldysh green s function approach@xmath18 within the anderson model for a two - level system .",
    "a effective - mass model , which takes into account the anisotropy and inhomogeneity , is used to estimate the inter - particle coulomb energies .",
    "we find that the optical excitation creates holes in the qd , which provide new channels ( via the electron - hole interaction ) for the electron to tunnel from the emitter to the collector . as a consequence",
    ", an electron can tunnel through the qd via four additional channels , characterized by the exciton , positive trion , negative trion , and biexciton states .",
    "each addition channel can generate a new plateau ( or oscillatory peaks ) in the tunnelling current characteristics in addition to the typical plateau ( or peaks ) caused by the coulomb blockade effect .",
    "this gives rise to a rich tunnelling current characteristics and it can be used to determine the exciton binding energy .",
    "this paper is organized as the following . in section",
    "ii , we derive the tunnelling current of set under optical pumping . in section iii , we calculate the polarization needed for describing the spontaneous emission spectrum . in section iv",
    ", we present calculations of the inter - particle coulomb interactions within a simple but realistic effective - mass model . in section",
    "v , we discuss the results of our numerical calculations on the tunnelling current and spontaneous emission spectrum and demonstrate that the exciton binding energy can be extracted via the measurement of tunnelling current . finally , a summary and concluding remarks are presented in section vi .",
    "the system of interest is shown in fig .",
    "1 , which consists of a single inas / gaas self - assembled quantum dot ( saqd ) sandwiched between two n - doped gaas leads .",
    "electrons are allowed to tunnel from the left lead ( emitter ) to the right lead ( collector ) under the influence of an optical field .",
    "the hamiltonian for the system is given by    @xmath19    where the first term describes electrons in the qd .",
    "we assume that the quantum confinement effect is strong for the small inas qd considered here .",
    "therefore , the energy spacings between the ground state and the first excited state for electrons and holes , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , are much larger than the thermal energy , @xmath22 , where @xmath23 and @xmath24 denote the boltzmann constant and temperature . only the ground state levels for electrons and holes , @xmath25 and @xmath26 ,",
    "are considered in the first term .",
    "the second term describes the kinetic energies of free carriers in the electrodes .",
    "note that in the current setup , the gate electrode does not provide any carriers , but merely controls the energy levels of the qd .",
    "the third term describes the coupling between the qd and the leads .",
    "note that only the conduction band of qd is coupled with the electrodes .",
    "the fourth term describes the interband optical pumping with a frequency @xmath27 , which is in resonance with the transition energy for an electron - hole pair in the wetting layer .",
    "we treat the electromagnetic field as a semiclassical field .",
    "the fifth term describes the optical phonon assisted process for electrons in the wetting layer to relax into the inas qd .",
    "the last term describe the coupling of the qd with the electromagnetic field of frequency @xmath28 .",
    "@xmath29 is the rabi frequency , where @xmath30 is the matrix element for the optical transition and @xmath31 is electric field per photon .",
    "@xmath32 and @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) denote the creation and annihilation operators of a photon ( phonon ) , respectively .    due to the large",
    "strain - induced splitting between the heavy - hole and light - hole bands for typical qds , we only have to consider the heavy hole band ( with @xmath35 ) and ignore its coupling with light - hole band caused by the qd potential .",
    "thus , we can treat the heavy hole as a spin-1/2 particle with @xmath36 representing @xmath37 .",
    "this treatment is convenient for algebraic manipulations in the calculation of green s functions . because the effect of inter - particle coulomb interactions is significant in small semiconductor qds ,",
    "we take into account the electron coulomb interactions and electron - hole coulomb interactions by adding the following terms @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are creation and annihilation operators for particles with spin @xmath41 in the @xmath42th energy level of the qd .",
    "once the hamiltonian is constructed , the tunnelling current of set can be calculated via the keldysh green s function method.@xmath43 we obtain the tunnelling current through a single dot ( see appendix a ) @xmath44\\frac{\\gamma_l(\\epsilon ) \\gamma_r(\\epsilon ) } { \\gamma_l(\\epsilon)+\\gamma_r(\\epsilon)}img^r_{e,\\sigma}(\\epsilon),\\ ] ] where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the fermi distribution function for the source and drain electrodes , respectively .",

    ", these tunnelling rates will be assumed energy and bias - independent .",
    "therefore , the calculation of tunnelling current is entirely determined by the spectral function @xmath50 , which is the imaginary part of the retarded green s function @xmath51 .",
    "( 3 ) is obtained provided that the condition @xmath52 and @xmath53 are satisfied , where @xmath54 is the captured rate of electrons .",
    "because of the phonon bottleneck effect , we expect the rate for the electron to relax from the wetting layer to the qd is small .",
    "thus , we have ignored the terms involving phonons in the calculation of the tunnelling current . besides ,",
    "photon current has also been neglected , since the electron - hole recombination rate , @xmath55 is much smaller than the tunnelling rates .",
    "the retarded green s function , @xmath56 , can be obtained by the equation of motion of @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is a step function .",

    "the fourier transform of @xmath60 is given by @xmath61 with @xmath62 being a positive infinitesimal number .",
    "@xmath63 is the full green s function , which includes all type of interactions .",
    "given the conditions @xmath64 and @xmath53 , we can drop the fifth and the last term of the hamiltonian in the calculation of @xmath56 . to solve @xmath56 ,",
    "we consider only the lowest order coupling between the electrodes and the qd .",
    "the equation of motion for @xmath65 leads to    @xmath66    where the two particle green s functions , @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 arise from the particle correlation and they satisfy    @xmath70    @xmath71    and    @xmath72    @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 in eqs .",

    "for instance , the peak located at @xmath223 almost vanishes due to the much reduced probability for the pole at @xmath224 . based on the results of figs .  4 and 5 , we see that the set has potential application as an optically controlled switch . for practical applications , we must consider the behavior of the tunnelling current for an set operated at finite temperatures .",
    "figure 6 shows a comparison of the electron occupation number and tunnelling current at zero temperature and finite temperature ( @xmath237 ) .",
    "we see that the plateaus become broadened and the magnitude of the tunnelling current peak is reduced as the temperature increases .",
    "thus , a large charging energy is required for sets to be operated at high temperatures .",
    "the tunnelling current as a function of applied bias ( @xmath185 ) for various strengths of photo - excitation power at @xmath238 and @xmath239 is shown in fig .",
    "the tunnelling current exhibits a staircase behavior .",
    "this is the well - known coulomb blockade effect .",
    "the effect of the optical pumping is reduce the threshold voltage and increase the number of plateaus in the j - v characteristics .",
    "we also notice that a negative differential conductance occurs at high voltages when the resonance level of the qd is below the conduction band minimum of the emitter electrode .",
    "set has been considered as a single - photon generater ( spg ) for quantum information application such as quantum cryptography and teleportation.@xmath240 thus , it is of great interest to study the spontaneous single - photon emission spectrum of the set .",
    "we previously reported the theoretical studies of the emission spectrum of a single qd embedded in a p - n junction.@xmath17 here , we consider the single - photon emission of an set ( a qd embedded in a",
    "n - i - n junction ) under optical pumping . since the magnitudes of inter - particle coulomb interactions @xmath206",
    ", @xmath241 and @xmath175 are fairly close , it will be difficult to resolve the peaks of exciton ( @xmath125 ) , negative trion ( @xmath242 ) , positive trion ( @xmath243 ) and biexciton ( @xmath128 ) for the case of large tunnelling rate as we considered above ( @xmath244 ) .",
    "therefore , for this study we adopt a small tunnelling rate , @xmath245 in order to resolve these peaks in the emission spectrum .",
    "this can be achieved , for example , by increasing the barrier thickness between the qd and the conducting leads .",
    "figure 8 shows the emission spectrum for various gate - voltages at fixed pump power ( @xmath200 ) . for @xmath246 ,",
    "the calculated spontaneous emission spectrum displays four peaks corresponding to @xmath242 , @xmath125 , @xmath128 and @xmath243 .",
    "the red shift of the @xmath242 peak relative to the exciton peak agrees well with experimental observations.@xmath247 the biexciton peak displaying a blue shift with respect to the exciton peak ( showing an antibinding biexciton ) is also consistent with the observation reported in ref.[14,19 - 21 ] recently , studies of the binding and antibinding of biexcitons were reported in ref .",
    "our calculation given by eqs .",
    "( 21 ) and ( 22 ) provides only the antibinding feature of biexciton . in ref .",
    "21 it is pointed out that the biexciton complex changes from antibinding to binding as the qd size increases . for qds with dimension larger than the exciton bohr radius ( around 20 nm ) ,",
    "the correlation energy becomes significant . in this study , we have not taken into account the correlation energy .",
    "this is justified as long as we restrict ourselves to qds with size less than 20 nm .",
    "we see in this figure when the gate - voltage is increased up to @xmath248 , only the @xmath242 and @xmath249 peaks survive in the emission spectrum as @xmath197 approaches 1 . furthermore , we can adjust the intensity of excitation power to either enhance or suppress the strength of the biexciton peak .",
    "thompson et al . demonstrated that the single photon generated by the biexciton state is significantly less in emission time than the single exciton state.@xmath250 from this point of view , the biexciton state is favored for the application of single - photon generation .",
    "we find that one can increase the pump power in order to select the biexciton state as the desired source to produce the single - photon emission .",
    "this is demonstrated in fig .",
    "9 , where the emission spectra for various strengths of excitation power at the fixed gate voltage @xmath248 are shown .",
    "we see that the negative trion saturates at @xmath251 and diminishes afterwards , while the biexciton peak increases quadratically with @xmath201 and becomes the dominant peak in the emission spectrum .",
    "finally , we discuss the emission spectrum of an isolated charge - neutral qd with @xmath252 . for this case",
    "the rate equation of exciton number @xmath253 can be readily obtained by solving the rate equation @xmath254 with @xmath255 where @xmath256 and @xmath257 is the refractive index of the system .",

    "@xmath261 denotes the capture rate for excitons from the wetting layer to the qd . after the integration of @xmath28 in eq .",

    "( 25 ) , we see that the intensities of exciton and biexciton peaks are proportional to @xmath236 and @xmath267 , if @xmath253 is proportional to @xmath236 ( the excitation power ) .",
    "this is in very good agreement with many experimental reports.@xmath268 note that in some experiments , the pump energy is far above the qd band gap and the emission occurs after the electrons and holes are captured .",
    "this situation becomes similar to the open system considered in the set with optical pumping . in this case",
    ", we can replace @xmath87 in eq .",
    "( 20 ) by @xmath269 , the electron occupation due to optical pumping , and we can still prove that the intensities of @xmath125 and @xmath128 peaks as functions of the excitation power are described by eqs .",
    "( 14 ) , ( 15 ) and ( 20 ) .",
    "thus , they exhibit linear and quadratic behavior as a function of @xmath236 , respectively .",

    "17 , in which the pump energy is far above the qd band gap and both @xmath242 and @xmath243 peaks ( in addition to the @xmath125 and @xmath128 peaks ) were observed in the emission spectrum .",
    "in this article we have studied the tunnelling current and emission spectrum of an set under optical pumping theoretically .",
    "we apply our theoretical analysis to an set , which consists of a single quantum dot embedded in a n - i - n junction .",
    "we use a simple but realistic effective mass model to calculate the inter - particle coulomb interactions of pyramid - shaped inas / gaas qds .",
    "these coulomb interactions are essential for the study of optical and transport properties of qds .",

    "it is found that the holes in qd generated by optical pumping leads to new channels for electrons to tunnel from the emitter to the collector , which creates a variety of ways to control both the electrical and optical signals .",
    "the binding energy of exciton complexes as well as electron charging energy can be determined by examining the tunnelling current as a function of gate voltage @xmath186 with a small applied bias @xmath185 . in addition , the emission spectrum of set can be modified significantly by adjusting bias voltage , the gate voltage , or the pump intensity .    *",
