    "gamma - ray astronomy is the primary means by which we can study the non - thermal processes occuring in cosmic sources such as active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , pulsars and gamma - ray bursts ( grbs )  @xcite .",

    "gamma - ray telescopes have improved in sensitivity and resolution from cos - b  @xcite to the fermi - lat  @xcite , but the performance of these pair - creation telescopes decreases at low energy where the background is problematic and the angular resolution is limited by multiple scattering .    the performance and polarimetry potential of a tpc have been studied in detail in ref .",

    "several effects contribute to the angular resolution , which is shown as a function of photon energy in fig .",
    "[ fig : angularresar ] for an argon gas tpc .",
    "the angular resolution for pair production is limited by multiple scattering of the electrons in the gas .",
    "also , most conversions take place in the field of a nucleus whose recoil momentum is impossible to measure because of the very short recoil path length .",
    "this puts a limit on the resolution at energies @xmath4 . even with these limitations however , an improvement in angular momentum of up to an order of magnitude with respect to that of the fermi - lat is achievable with a tpc .",
    "argon tpc , using an optimal tracking such as that implemented in a kalman filter , and with a track sampling of @xmath5 and a spatial resolution of @xmath6 . at high energies ( @xmath7 ) , it is limited by the multiple scattering of the electrons in the gas . at lower energies ,",
    "it is constrained by the unknown recoil momentum of the nucleus .",
    "this limit can be overcome by looking at triplet conversion , but they are rarer and more difficult to reconstruct . ]",
    "the polarimetry of cosmic sources with a pair - creation telescope has long been considered to be difficult or even impossible , as thick , high-@xmath8 detector elements are needed to convert the incoming photon , and the conversion electrons then undergo multiple scattering in the converter , after which the information about the azimuthal angle of the conversion plane is blurred  @xcite .",
    "we have built and validated an event generator  @xcite which is full ( 5d , either nuclear or triplet conversion ) exact down to threshold and polarized .",
    "we have characterized the properties of a telescope based on a thin homogeneous detector with optimal tracking and have established the power laws that describe the dominating contributions to the angular resolution  @xcite .",
    "for such a detector , even when the dilution of the effective polarization asymmetry due to multiple scattering is taken into account , polarimetry can still be performed with high precision ( still under the assumption of optimal tracking )  @xcite .",
    "the harpo project aims to characterize the tpc technology as a high angular resolution polarimeter and telescope in the mev - gev range , enabling us to obtain unprecedented sensitivity for the detection of low - energy gamma rays .",
    "a tpc is a detector in which traversing charged particles ionize the detector material .",
    "the electrons produced drift along an electric field , @xmath9 , and are then amplified and measured on the @xmath10-@xmath11 readout plane .",
    "the drift time gives a measure of the @xmath12 coordinate .",
    "harpo would be the first space polarimeter above @xmath3 .    in this paper",
    "we first describe the demonstrator that we have built to validate the performance of the tpc technology , in particular the characterization of the gem and micromegas combinations used for gas amplification .",
    "then we present the recent experimental campaign , in which the detector was exposed to the quasi - monochromatic and almost fully polarized beam provided by the bl01 line of the newsubaru facility , operated by the lasti in university of hygo in japan .",

    "this results in a gamma energy range at the compton edge between @xmath40 and @xmath41 as shown in table  [ laser ] . as the gamma has a maximum energy for forward compton scattering , energy selection was performed by using a collimator on axis .",
    "when collimation is applied , the polarisation of the laser beam is almost entirely transferred to the gamma beam : in that way , an almost fully polarized gamma beam ( @xmath30 ) is obtained .",
    "a general issue in polarization studies is the control of a possible systematic bias induced by the non - cylindrical - symmetric structure of the detector  @xcite .",
    "therefore in addition to the fully polarized data , some data with a non polarized beam were taken . to produce such a beam , a @xmath42 plate is used .",
    "this changes the linear polarization to circular polarization , which , as far as pair conversion is concerned , is equivalent to random polarization ( @xmath32 ) . or vice versa .      for the previous characterizations using cosmic rays , the tpc was triggered on a simple coincidence of scintillator signals  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , for data taking in beam , we wished to maximize the fraction of selected gammas that converted in the gas .",
    "therefore a dedicated , more sophisticated trigger was designed .",
    "in addition it provides separately the control of the efficiency of each of its components .",
    "the harpo trigger system is based on a parisroc2  @xcite chip mounted on a pmm2  @xcite board .",
    "this trigger is built from the discriminated signals of the scintillators , laser and micromegas mesh as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : trigger ] .",
    "the available signals are :    * laser : when a pulsed laser is used , the laser s trigger signal @xmath43 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : laser trigger ] ) is used .",
    "it also determines the time at which the event takes place , @xmath44 , with a precision of a few @xmath45 ns .",
    "+    * scintillator : the signal comes from 12 pmts on 6 scintillators . the signal is recorded , whether there is a trigger or not .",
    "it gives @xmath44 with a hundred nanosecond precision .",
    "this signal determines @xmath44 when the laser signal is not available ( co@xmath33 ) .",
    "* micromegas mesh : the signal induced on the mesh is long and has an unpredictable shape : it corresponds to the time distribution of the charge deposited by the event in the tpc gas as it drifts towards the anode .",
    "the signal is amplified and derived through a 5 nf capacitor .",
    "it is then discriminated with a constant - fraction discriminator ( cfd ) , so as to determine the rising edge @xmath46 of the signal .",
    "the @xmath47 constant of the readout electronics of the mesh signal is @xmath48 .",
    "it has been fixed as a compromise between the amount of electronic noise given the large capacitance of the full mesh , of 8nf , and the need of a precise determination of the rising edge of the signal @xmath46 .",
    "+ events that have a too small of a delay between the time of the event , @xmath44 , and the discriminated mesh signal rising edge , @xmath46 , are rejected .",
    "this provides a veto on background tracks created in the beam line upstream of the tpc and on gamma rays which converted in the material between the up scintillator and the active tpc gas ( example : in the pcb supporting the amplification system ) .",
    "the gamma trigger , @xmath49 , is designed so as to select gamma rays produced by lcs and that converted inside the tpc gas .",
    "the conditions are listed below :    * the upstream scintillator signal ( @xmath50 ) is used as a veto , * at least one downstream scintillator signal ( @xmath51 , other than `` up '' ) is required , * the laser trigger signal ( @xmath43 ) , when present , is used , * the events with a signal present in the mesh are selected , vetoing the prompt part as already explained , we require @xmath52 . this `` slow '' selection of a mesh signal is denoted @xmath53 .",
    "the main @xmath54 trigger line is therefore defined as the combination of the four following components : @xmath55        the distribution of @xmath46 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tmin ] .",
    "gamma conversions inside the tpc gas ( blue ) are the signal events .",
    "the flatness of that part of the spectrum is due to the fact that the probability of conversion per unit path length is constant for a thin detector .",
    "tracks entering the detector from upstream and gamma conversions in the detector material upstream of the tpc gas , which escaped the vetos , form the ( green ) peak . if we had used a trigger without any veto , the height of this peak would have been larger by several orders of magnitude , precluding an efficient data taking .",
    "events ( red ) which lie outside the normal time range ( i.e. , @xmath56 or @xmath57 ) are due to energy deposition inside the gas by events that are not related to the trigger ( pile - up ) .     for one run ( all trigger lines ) :",
    "tracks originating upstream ( green ) , gamma conversion inside the tpc gas ( blue ) , charge deposition inside the gas by events not related to the trigger ( red ) . ]",
    "in addition to the main gamma trigger line , separate trigger lines have been formed with one of the trigger components omitted ( such as @xmath58 ,   @xmath59 ,   @xmath60 ,   @xmath61 ,   in the case of a pulsed laser ) .",
    "analysis of these specific data will enable us to control separately the signal efficiency and the background rejection factor for each component of the main trigger line .",
    "other dedicated lines were used , such as the `` traversing @xmath12 track '' line for calibration purposes .",
    "most of these additional lines were down - scaled so as to not saturate the bandwidth of the digitizing electronics , and were active only for a fraction of the time , as denoted by the rainbow part of fig .",
    "[ fig : trigger ] .",
    "approximately @xmath62 of the time was devoted to the main trigger line .",

    "bar was performed , with the gas amplification tuned so that the signal amplitude was kept constant ( @xmath67 , nd 1@xmath68 , @xmath69 ) .      during data taking in the beam ,",
    "some basic parameters were monitored , such as alignment , amplification gain , trigger performance and event quality after some very basic tracking .",

    "the small features that can be seen in the time charts ( fig .",

    "were found to be sufficiently stable and the electron absorption due to either leaks or outgassing was found to be sufficiently small that we did nt have to renew the gas .",
