    "quantum hall ( qh ) devices at certain filling fractions are the only systems known to be in topological phases .",
    "the @xmath1 laughlin state is in an abelian topological phase .",
    "the excitations of such a phase carry a fraction of an electron charge and have fractional statistics which are intermediate between bosonic and fermionic statistics .",
    "the fractional charge has been confirmed experimentally @xcite , and experiments showing indications of fractional statistics have been recently performed @xcite .",
    "the observed@xcite quantum hall state at filling fraction @xmath0 is the primary candidate for a system in a non - abelian topological phase , and is believed to be described by the moore - read pfaffian state @xcite as a result of numerical evidence @xcite .",
    "the excitations of the pfaffian carry fractional charge @xmath2 and have non - abelian braiding statistics : for given quasiparticle positions , there are several linearly - independent quantum states of the system , and braiding the quasiparticles causes a rotation in this space@xcite .",
    "in addition to their novelty , these properties could be useful for topological quantum computation @xcite .    in the absence of landau level mixing , the hamiltonian of a half - filled landau level is particle - hole symmetric .",
    "the pfaffian state , if it is the ground state of such a hamiltonian , spontaneously breaks particles - hole symmetry .",
    "the particle - hole conjugate of the pfaffian , dubbed the anti - pfaffian @xcite , has exactly the same energy as the pfaffian in the absence of landau level mixing .",
    "hence , it is a serious candidate for the @xmath0 state observed in experiments , where landau level mixing , which is not small , will favor one of the two states .",
    "therefore , it is important to find experimental probes which can distinguish between these two states .",
    "although the two states are related by a particle - hole transformation and are both non - abelian , they differ in important ways : their quasiparticle statistics differ by abelian phases , and the anti - pfaffian has three counter - propagating neutral edge modes while the pfaffian edge is completely chiral . in this paper",
    "we consider edge tunneling experiments for both the pfaffian and the anti - pfaffian states , and we find quantitative differences between the two resulting from these distinctions .",
    "the double point contact geometry has been proposed as a probe for non - abelian statistics @xcite . in this setup ,",
    "a qh bar is gated so that two constrictions are created , as shown in figure [ 2pc ] , and quasiparticles can tunnel from one edge to the other at either constriction . the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ 2pc ] serves as a reminder that the two edges are actually different sections of a single edge which is the boundary of the system ; consequently , inter - edge tunneling satisfies topological conservation laws which are important in the non - abelian case .",
    "an edge quasiparticle entering the sample from the left can tunnel to the lower edge through either point contact , and the measured tunneling current is sensitive to the interference between these two possible trajectories .",
    "the phase difference between the quantum amplitudes of these two trajectories depends on the applied voltage between the top and bottom edges , the magnetic flux enclosed between the two trajectories , and the number of quasiparticles localized in the bulk between the two trajectories .",
    "if the quasiparticles have non - abelian statistics , the quantum state of the system can change when the edge quasiparticle encircles the localized bulk ones , and the effect on the interference term is more than merely a phase shift . the pfaffian and anti - pfaffian states exemplify the most extreme case : if there is an even number of localized quasiparticles enclosed between the tunneling trajectories , there will be interference that depends on the magnetic flux and applied voltage , while in the presence of an odd number of bulk quasiparticles in the bulk , the interference pattern will be completely lost .",
    "we will recover these striking results using an explicit edge theory calculation .",
    "the visibility of the interference pattern in the even quasiparticle case will be obscured by thermal smearing as well as the difference between the charged and neutral mode velocities .",
    "naively , the latter is particularly acute in the anti - pfaffian case , where the velocities have opposite sign .",
    "however , as we will see quantitatively from the edge state calculation below , the difference between the even and odd quasiparticle cases will be visible for sufficiently low temperature in both the pfaffian and anti - pfaffian states .",
    "the required temperature vanishes as the distance between the contacts or the difference in velocities is increased .",
    "the principle conceptual difficulty in analyzing inter - edge tunneling stems from the non - abelian nature of the bulk state , which causes ambiguities in edge correlation functions ( or , more properly , _",
    "conformal blocks _ ) .",
    "we show how these are resolved , following refs . and further refinements introduced in refs .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ main ] we set up the perturbative calculation to lowest order , explain the ambiguity that arises in evaluating correlation functions due to the non - abelian nature of the edge , and show how to resolve this ambiguity , following refs . .",
    "in section [ tv ] , we find the expected tunneling current behavior as a function of bias voltage and temperature in the pfaffian state , taking into consideration the different velocities of charged and neutral modes on the edge . we show that for sufficiently low temperature , interference will be visible in the even quasiparticle case . in section [ apf ] , we repeat the calculation for the anti - pfaffian state and show the quantitative differences with the pfaffian case .    , with tunneling amplitude @xmath3 .",
    "the dashed line serves as a reminder that both top and bottom edges are two sections of the same edge .",
    "the two ends of point contact @xmath4 are two points on the same edge separated by a distance @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the length of the edge.,width=288 ]",
    "we now set up the calculation of the tunneling current to lowest order and discuss the basic issues which arise .",
    "the pfaffian and anti - pfaffian cases are conceptually similar , so we focus on the pfaffian for the sake of concreteness .",
    "the edge theory of the pfaffian state has a chiral bosonic charge mode and a chiral neutral majorana mode@xcite [ eqn : pf - edge ] l_pf(,)=_x(_t+v_c_x)+ i(_t+v_n_x)both modes propagate in the same direction , but will have different velocities in general .",
    "one expects the charge velocity @xmath7 to be larger than the neutral velocity @xmath8 .",
    "the electron operator is a charge @xmath9 fermionic operator : _ el = e^i and the @xmath2 quasiparticle operator is : _",
    "1/4=e^i/2 where @xmath10 is the ising spin field of the majorana fermion theory@xcite .",
    "when inter - edge tunneling is weak , we expect the amplitude @xmath11 for charge-@xmath2 to be transferred from one edge to the other to be larger than for higher charges @xmath12 , which should be @xmath13 .",
    "it is also the most relevant tunneling operator in the renormalization group sense @xcite , so we will focus on it .",
    "since it is relevant , its effective value grows as the temperature is decreased , eventually leaving the weak tunneling regime .",
    "we assume that the temperature is high enough that the system is still in the weak tunneling regime and a perturbative calculation will be valid , but still much lower than the bulk energy gap .    following ref .",
    ", we write the tunneling hamiltonian in the form : @xmath14 the frequency @xmath15 is the josephson frequency for a charge @xmath2 quasiparticle with voltage @xmath16 applied between the top and bottom edges .",
    "the difference in the magnetic fluxes enclosed by the two trajectories around the interferometer is @xmath17 .",
    "we have chosen a gauge in which the vector potential is concentrated at the second point contact so that @xmath17 enters only through the second term above .",
    "both edges are part of the boundary of the same hall droplet , so we can denote the point on the upper edge which is on the other side of point contact @xmath4 from @xmath18 by @xmath19 , where @xmath20 and @xmath6 is large .",
    "the operator @xmath21 tunnels a quasiparticle between @xmath18 and @xmath22 : @xmath23 the current operator can be easily found from the commutator of the tunneling hamiltonian and the charge on one edge : @xmath24 to lowest order in perturbation theory , the tunneling current is found to be : [ current ] i(t ) = -i _ -^t dt 0 | [ i(t),h_(t)]|0 in order to compute the current , we substitute ( [ eqn : tunneling - ham ] ) and ( [ eqn : current - op ] ) into ( [ current ] ) .",

    "the correlations involving the bosonic fields are straightforward to calculate and , in the limit of a long sample , @xmath27 , the bosonic correlation function breaks into a product of two - point correlation functions of fields on the same edge : @xmath28^{-1/8}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] however , the four @xmath10 correlation function is actually ill - defined without further information , namely the fusion channels of the four @xmath10 operators .",

    "the tunneling current calculation in the double quantum point setup proceeds in a very similar fashion to the pfaffian case .",
    "to lowest - order , we must compute four - quasiparticle correlation functions , and the relevant conformal block is the one in which quasiparticle fields on both ends of a point contact should fuse the identity . in the long sample limit , we seek the projection of these correlation function on the conformal block in which quasiparticles on the same edge fuse to the identity .",
    "@xmath128 non - abelian statistics are similar to the ising statistics that appear in the pfaffian . in the @xmath128 theory",
    "there are only @xmath34 particle types , @xmath140,@xmath132 , and @xmath9 , with the fusion rule : = 0 + 1 which is analogous to the the fusion rule in eq.([sigmasigma ] ) .",
    "hence , the enumeration of conformal blocks in @xmath128 theory is the same as in the ising theory if we identify the operators @xmath32,@xmath10 and @xmath38 with @xmath140 , @xmath132 , and @xmath9 operators respectively . also , the matrix elements of the f - matrix which describes the change of basis between different fusion channels turn out to be the same in both theories , up to a phase@xcite .",
    "an equation analogous to eq.([longsample ] ) holds for the anti - pfaffian case also , but with different power laws since the spin @xmath132 operator has a different scaling dimension than the @xmath10 operator : @xmath141^{-3/8 } \\nn\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the tunneling current behavior in the anti - pfaffian case is qualitatively the same as but quantitatively different from the pfaffian case .",
    "one might worry that no interference should take place at all since the @xmath2 quasiparticle operator is made up of a bosonic part moving in one direction and a fermionic part moving in the opposite direction , and in a semiclassical picture these two parts are moving away from each other .",
    "in fact , the sign of the neutral mode velocity makes no difference , as may be seen by comparing ( [ longsample ] ) and ( [ longsample - ap ] ) . as a result of the product over @xmath142 , the sign of the neutral mode velocity drops out of the problem .",
    "the point is that the quantum mechanical tunneling process involves creating a quasiparticle and a quasihole , and regardless of the chirality of the mode , one excitation will move to the left and one to the right .",
    "we note that this breakdown of semiclassical intuition represented by the insensitivity to the neutral mode direction is a feature of a dc measurement",
    ". a finite frequency measurement might be more sensitive to the difference between the charge and neutral velocities .    at zero temperature in the anti - pfaffian state ,",
    "@xmath143 the conductance will behave as @xmath144 ; the differential conductance will be sharply peaked at @xmath145 ( with a peak width of order @xmath146 ) and vanishing elsewhere . for @xmath100 ,",
    "the conductance varies as @xmath147 . in both cases",
    ", there are quantitative differences from the pfaffian .",
    "again , for an odd number of quasiparticles in the interference loop , @xmath148 for an even number of bulk quasiparticles , the tunneling current will oscillate with magnetic field and voltage , similar to the pfaffian case . again , for charge and neutral velocities which are equal in absolute value ( although opposite in sign ) , @xmath78 can be found analytically : @xmath149 although the phase acquired in the anti - pfaffian state by an @xmath2 quasiparticle in going around another @xmath2 quasiparticle is different ( in either fusion channel ) from in the pfaffian state , the phase acquired by an @xmath2 quasiparticle in going around a charge @xmath138 is @xmath150 in either state , with the minus sign corresponding to the presence of a neutral fermion .",
    "a difference between the absolute values of the neutral and charge velocities will again be evident through a beating pattern in the differential conductance .",
    "@xmath78 is exponentially decaying with temperature with characteristic scale : k_b t^*= ( + ) ^-1 and the corresponding dephasing length is : l_= ( + ) ^-1 .",
    "as we have seen from the preceding formulas , the pfaffian and anti - pfaffian state have qualitatively similar behavior in a two point - contact interferometer . in particular , the reversal of the neutral modes in the latter state makes little difference .",
    "however , the temperature and voltage dependences of the backscattered current are quantitatively different .",
    "the difference is clear in the behavior of a single - point contact , where the associated power laws are different , @xmath151 in the case of the pfaffian and @xmath152 in the case of the anti - pfaffian .",
    "however , there are also differences in the detailed temperature and voltage dependence of the interference contribution to the current , as may be seen from eqs .",
    "[ eqn : zero - temp - int ] , [ i_12-ap ] .",
    "the relative insensitivity of quantum interference effects to the difference between the charge and neutral mode velocities runs counter to semi - classical thinking ( and shows its limitations ) : naively , one might think that when a quasiparticle decays into its charged and neutral parts , interferometry would be hopeless . fortunately , this is not the case , as explicit calculation shows .",
    "this also augurs well for the suitability of either one for quantum computation along the lines of refs . .",
    "the downside is that the experimental difference between the pfaffian and anti - pfaffian states is muted .",
    "it can be extracted from the behavior in an interferometer , but it would still be useful to have a probe which is more sensitive to the direction of the neutral modes ."
