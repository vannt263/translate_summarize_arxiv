    "the global star - formation rate ( sfr ) has undergone strong cosmological evolution : it was @xmath0 10 times its present value at @xmath1 , had a peak value @xmath0 10100 times the present one in the redshift range @xmath2 1.53.5 , and declined again at high @xmath3 ( madau _ et  al . _  1996",

    "details of the sfr at high redshifts are still somewhat uncertain , because much of the star formation at @xmath4 may be dust - obscured and so missed by optical surveys , but detected readily through the copious submillimeter emission from the dust heated by star formation ( hughes _ et  al . _  1998 ; barger _",

    "the x - ray emission of a normal galaxy ( _ i.e. _ , one without an active nucleus ) is dominated by the integrated emission of the galaxy s x - ray binary population ( see , _",

    "in wg98 we discussed the effects of an evolving sfr on the evolution of x - ray binary populations of galaxies , and so on that of the x - ray emission from normal galaxies .",
    "we suggested that x - ray luminosities  of normal galaxies could show significant evolution ( by up to a factor @xmath0 10 ) , even in the relatively nearby redshift range @xmath2 0.51.0 .",
    "we also showed that an evolving sfr could resolve the `` birthrate problem '' involving lmxb and their descendant `` millisecond '' radio pulsars ( mrp , see kulkarni & narayan 1988 ; lorimer 1995 , l95 ) .    the sfr profile used in wg98the only profile available at the time  was based on the optical / uv data alone . over the past three years",
    ", there has been considerable progress in our understanding of cosmic star - formation history .",
    "in addition , very deep x - ray imaging with @xmath5 is beginning to detect normal galaxies in the redshift range @xmath2 0.51.0 , so that comparison with observations is becoming possible for the first time . in this _",
    "letter _ , we consider quantitatively the key imprints left by sfr evolution on the -evolution profiles of normal galaxies , using the best sfr models currently available .",
    "we briefly discuss the recent results of brandt _",
    "et  al . _  ( 2001 , bran01 ) from the ultradeep @xmath5 imaging of the hubble deep field north ( hdf - n ) . a detailed calculation of the expected x - ray flux distribution of the hdf - n galaxies based on the results of this paper",
    "is reported by ptak _",
    "et  al . _  ( 2001 , ptak01 ) .",
    "we also reconsider the resolution of the lmxb  mrp birthrate problem using the new sfr profiles , and find that the calculated rates for both ( a ) whole populations of lmxb and mrp , and , ( b ) short - period systems , are consistent with observation for some sfr profiles suggested recently to account for the multiwaveband sfr data .",
    "we discuss the relative roles of global sfr profiles on the one hand , and the profiles of individual galaxies or galaxy - types on the other .",
    "the total x - ray output of a normal galaxy can be modeled as the sum of those of its hmxb and lmxb as per the wg98 scheme , wherein the evolution of each species `` @xmath6 '' is described by a timescale @xmath7 ( see wg98 ) . to study the effects of the dependence of @xmath7 on the binary period and other evolutionary parameters",
    ", we run the evolutionary scheme over ranges of likely values of @xmath7 given in the literature .",
    "the evolution of the hmxb population in response to an evolving star - formation rate sfr(t ) is given by @xmath8 where  is the number density of hmxbs in the galaxy , and  is the hmxb evolution timescale .",
    "@xmath9 is the rate of formation of hmxbs per unit sfr , given approximately by @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the fraction of all stars in binaries , @xmath12 is that fraction of primordial binaries which has the correct range of stellar masses and orbital periods for producing hmxbs ( van den heuvel 1992 , vdh92 and the references therein ) , and @xmath13 is that fraction of massive binaries which survives the first supernova . in these calculations ,",

    "includes both ( a ) the time taken ( @xmath15 yr ) by the massive companion of the neutron star to evolve from the instant of the neutron - star - producing supernova to the instant when the `` standard '' hmxb phase begins , and , ( b ) the duration ( @xmath16 yr ) of this hmxb phase ( vdh92 and references therein ) .",
    "since the second timescale is negligible compared to the first , little error is made by approximating this two - step process by a single step with an overall timescale .",
    "two basic methods of lmxb production have been discussed . in the cores of dense globular clusters , they can be produced by the tidal capture of a neutron star by a normal star . over the rest of a galaxy , stellar densities are insufficient for tidal capture , and lmxbs",
    "are produced by the evolution of primordial binaries ( see , _",

    ", we consider only the latter mechanism . for spiral galaxies , at least , this must be the dominant mechanism , since the globular - cluster lmxb population in such galaxies only accounts for a relatively small fraction of the total x - ray luminosity .",
    "lmxb evolution from primordial binaries has two distinct stages ( wg98 ) after the supernova produces a post - supernova binary ( psnb ) containing the neutron star .",
    "first , the psnb evolves on a timescale  due to nuclear evolution of the neutron star s low - mass companion and/or decay of binary orbit due to gravitational radiation and magnetic braking , until the companion comes into roche lobe contact and the lmxb turns on .",
    "subsequently , the lmxb evolves on a timescale . since  and",
    "are comparable in general , we must describe the two stages separately ( wg98 ) by : @xmath17 @xmath18 here ,  and  are the respective number densities of psnb and lmxb in the galaxy , and @xmath19 is the rate of formation of lmxb per unit sfr , given approximately by @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the fraction of all stars in binaries , @xmath22 is that fraction of primordial binaries which has the correct range of stellar masses and orbital periods for producing lmxbs , and @xmath23 is that fraction of such binaries which survives the massive star s supernova .",
    "we display evolution in terms of the redshift @xmath3 , which is related to the cosmic time @xmath24 by @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is @xmath24 in units of @xmath27 yr , and a value of @xmath28 km s@xmath29 mpc@xmath29 has been used ; other cosmologies will be considered elsewhere .",
    "other values of the hubble constant lead to a straightforward scaling : for @xmath30 km s@xmath29 mpc@xmath29 , for example , @xmath31 , so that the results remain unchanged if all timescales are shortened by a factor of 1.3 . ] .",
    "we consider the suite of current sfr models detailed in table 1 to cover a plausible range , using the parameterization ofb99a , b .",
    "models of the `` peak '' class have the form @xmath32 while those of the `` anvil '' class have the form @xmath33 these functional forms are not unique , but useful , since they have a convenient low-@xmath3 limit , sfr@xmath34 , where all sfr profiles must agree with the optical / uv data ( m98 ) , and since the model parameters can be manipulated to mimic a wide range of star - formation histories ( b99b ) .",

    "no galaxies exist for sufficiently large redshifts , @xmath38 10 .",
    "figures 1 and 2 show the prompt evolution of hmxbs and the slow evolution of lmxbs , and the evolution of the total x - ray binary population , where the two components have been so weighted as to represent the total x - ray emission from the galaxy ( the weight - ratio is the product of @xmath39 and the ratio of the average luminosity of hmxbs and lmxbs ) .",
    "the hmxb profile closely follows the sfr profile because  is small compared to the sfr evolution timescale .",
    "by contrast , the lmxb profile has a significant lag behind the sfr profile because  and  are comparable to sfr evolution timescale : depending on these timescales , the lmxb profile peaks at redshifts @xmath0 13 later than the hmxb profile ( as seen clearly in figs . 1 and 2 ) , which is a characteristic signature of sfr evolution ( wg98 ) .",
    "figure 1 compares the -evolution corresponding to the ( madau or peak - m ) sfr profile and the evolutionary timescales we originally used in wg98 , _",

    ", we display the -evolution for a range of sfr profiles  peak - m , hierarchical , anvil-10 , and gaussian , the evolutionary timescales being held fixed at  = 1.9 gyr ,  = 1.0 gyr . between them , the two figures thus explore the effects of ( a ) varying the evolutionary timescales for a fixed sfr profile , _ viz . _",
    "peak - m , and ( b ) varying the profile for a fixed set of evolutionary timescales . for sufficiently _ slow _ lmxb evolution ,",
    "the galaxy s x - ray emission is dominated by lmxbs at low redshifts ( @xmath40 ) , and by hmxbs at high redshifts . as a result ,",
    "the total -profile is _ strongly _ influenced at high redshifts by the sfr profile ( see fig.2 ) , and may actually show hints of a double - peak structure ( wg98 ) at intermediate redshifts ( _ e.g. _ , the gaussian profile in fig.2 ) . for sufficiently _ fast _ lmxb evolution , on the other hand , lmxbs and hmxbs may have comparable contributions to  at low redshifts ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "bran01 estimate that the average x - ray luminosity of the bright spiral galaxies at an average redshift @xmath41 used in their stacking analysis is about a factor of 3 higher than that in the local universe ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "this observed evolution , ( 0.5)/(0.0 ) @xmath0 3 , can be compared with our theoretical results in table 2 .",
    "the degree of evolution from @xmath43 to @xmath44 0.51.0 increases from madau - type profiles to those with additional star formation at high redshifts , the numbers for the peak - m profile being in best agreement with bran01 . for a given profile ,",
    "the evolutionary factor is smaller for a slower evolution of lmxbs ( roughly measured in this context by the total time  + ) , as expected .",
    "more sophisticated estimates of the expected -distribution of hdf - n galaxies , based on these evolutionary scenarios , are described in ptak01 .",
    "as discussed in wg98 , the evolution of mrps from lmxbs is described by an equation similar to eq .  3 , but involving the mrp number density , and mrp evolution timescale @xmath45 yr ( camilo _ et  al . _",
    "our evolutionary scheme yields the profiles of lmxb and mrp evolution for a given sfr profile , giving the number ratio , @xmath46 , and the rate ratio , @xmath47 , of the mrp and lmxb populations at the present epoch ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "we showed in wg98 that the peak - m profile yielded @xmath48 for the overall mrp and lmxb populations , in agreement with current observations ( l95 ) .",
    "however , for short - period systems ( lmxb periods @xmath49 days ) , this profile yielded a value @xmath50 , smaller than the current value @xmath51 estimated from observations ( l95 ) . on repeating these calculations with other sfr profiles which have additional star formations at high redshifts , _",
    "e.g. _ , the gaussian and hierarchical profiles , we now find reasonable agreement for both whole populations and short - period systems , since these give @xmath52 for short - period systems , for plausible evolutionary timescales .",
    "thus , there appears to be no discrepancy between observation and the idea that sfr evolution naturally leads to values of @xmath53 which can be @xmath54 1 as well as considerably above unity ( but see  4 ) .    a new development in sfr research since",
    "wg98 has been the study of star - formation histories of individual galaxies and various galaxy - types .",
    "sfr profiles of individual galaxies , ranging from those in the local group to those in the hdf at redshifts @xmath55 , have been inferred , using a variety of techniques ( glazebrook _ et  al . _  1999 ,",
    "et  al . _  2000 ,",
    "et  al . _  2000",
    ") . for various galaxy - types , models of spectro - photometric evolution , which use the synthesis code _ pgase",
    "_ and are constrained by deep galaxy counts , have been developed ( rocca - volmerange and fioc 2000 ) , leading to a model sfr profile for each type .",
    "the birthrate problem was originally formulated entirely in terms of observations in our own galaxy , so that , strictly speaking , we should use the sfr profile of our galaxy . as none of the above techniques",
    "can be used in our own galaxy , it is difficult ( but not impossible ) to determine its sfr profile : calculations with such a profile will be described elsewhere .",
    "we have shown that different global sfr profiles within the currently admissible range lead to very different -evolution profiles , so that the latter profiles can be an _ independent _ x - ray probe of cosmic star - formation history .",
    "our results and a more detailed consideration by ptak01 indicate that the early _ chandra _ results ( bran01 ) are consistent with the peak - m profile : let us now clarify the underpinnings of this result by applying the considerations of global and individual sfr profiles summarized above .",
    "bran01 used bright spirals for their stacking analysis .",
    "rocca - volmerange and fioc ( 2000 ) have shown that the model sfr profile for such ( sa - sbc ) spirals rises roughly in a madau fashion from @xmath43 to @xmath1 ( which these authors ascribe to a bias in the original sample used to construct the madau profile towards bright spirals ) , and thereafter flattens to a roughly constant value @xmath0 12 times that at @xmath43 , falling again at @xmath56 .",
    "we can roughly represent this profile in the range @xmath57 by an anvil - type profile ( see  2 ) , with the parameter @xmath58 as given in table 1 , and the parameter @xmath59 2.7 .",
    "for such a profile with the timescales  = 1.9 gyr ,  = 1.0 gyr , as in figure 2 , our evolutionary scheme gives ( 0.5)/(0.0 ) = 3.3 , and ( 1.0)/(0.0 ) = 5.4 , in good agreement with both the bran01 results and the peak - m results given in table 2 .",
    "we now see why the peak - m profile appears to give a good account of the bran01 results . in effect",
    ", the bran01 analysis may be probing the sfr profile of only the bright spirals in hdf - n , and the fact that the peak - m profile is consistent with the bran01 results does _ not _ imply that the global sfr necessarily follows the peak - m profile .",
    "thus , there is no basic contradiction between the results of  2 and  3 .",
    "however , the fact that our global analysis of the birthrate problem (  3 ) gives the best agreement with observation for sfr profiles ( gaussian and hierarchical ) which have larger sfrs at high redshifts than the model sa - sbc profile of rocca - volmerange and fioc ( which , in turn , has a larger sfr at high redshifts than the peak - m profile ) remains to be understood fully .",
    "the individual - galaxy treatment may hold the key here .",
    "signatures of star formation in the relatively nearby ( @xmath60 ) universe have usually been sought at wavelengths other than x - rays . in this redshift range ,",
    "the x - ray probe described here is a `` fossil record '' study of star formation at earlier epochs for sufficiently slow lmxb evolution ( see fig.2 ) , since lmxbs then preserve this record for @xmath0 1 gyr after the star - formation peak is gone .",
    "conversely , for a known sfr profile , this is a unique proving ground for theories of lmxb evolution , which have been built almost wholly on the basis of our experience in the current epoch : this new probe is , at present , our only direct means of watching lmxb evolution unfold over cosmic time .",
