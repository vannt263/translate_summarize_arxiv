    "an understanding of the distribution and kinematics of the different components of the circumnuclear gas in an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) is important both for studying the anisotropy in the radiation field and thereby testing the unification scheme ( cf .",
    "barthel 1989 ; urry & padovani 1995 ) , and for understanding the fuelling of the radio activity . at radio wavelengths , the ionized component of this gas may be probed via radio polarization measurements of compact components in sources which reside within the dense interstellar environments of the parent galaxies .",
    "such sources are the radio cores , and the compact steep - spectrum ( css ) and gigahertz peaked - spectrum ( gps ) sources .",
    "the css sources are defined to be those with a projected linear size @xmath415 kpc ( h@xmath5=71 km s@xmath6 mpc@xmath6 , @xmath7=0.27 , @xmath8=0.73 , spergel et al .",
    "2003 ) and having a steep high - frequency radio spectrum ( @xmath90.5 , where s(@xmath10 ) .",
    "the gps sources are more compact and have sizes @xmath41 kpc ( odea 1998 ) . an important way of probing the atomic gas on sub - galactic scales is by studying 21-cm hi absorption towards the compact components of css and gps objects , or the compact radio nuclei of the larger objects ( e.g. van gorkom et al . 1989 ; conway & blanco 1995 ; peck et al .",

    "2003 ; gupta et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "the hi absorption lines associated with css and gps objects exhibit a variety of line profiles , suggesting significant , sometimes complex , gas motions , while the hi column densities have been found to be anti - correlated with source sizes ( vermeulen et al .",
    "2003 ; pihlstrm et al .",

    "pihlstrm et al .",
    "have explored different distributions of the hi gas density to explain this observed anti - correlation , and find that a disk as well as a spherical distribution are consistent with it . to study some of these aspects and to test for consistency with the unification scheme",
    ", we examine the dependence of hi column density on relative prominence of the core , f@xmath0 , which is being used as a statistical measure of the orientation of the source axis to the line of sight ( orr & browne 1982 ; kapahi & saikia 1982 ) . in this paper",
    ", we have investigated this using a sample of 32 css and gps sources , and have also examined the dependence of hi column density and velocity shift of the primary absorption component relative to the systemic velocity , on source symmetry parameters .",
    "our sample consists of all css and gps sources identified with radio galaxies and quasars for which we could compile information on the hi column density and core flux density or an upper limit to it either from the literature or our observations .",
    "css and gps sources such as j1347 + 1217 ( 4c+12.50 ) and j1407 + 2827 ( mrk668 , oq208 ) , which have prominent hi absorption lines and well - defined radio structures have not been included because they are classifed as seyferts in the literature ( e.g. hurt et al .",
    "1999 ; gallimore et al .",
    "the radio source j1415 + 1320 ( oq122 ) which has an hi absorption line ( carilli et al .",
    "1992 ) but has been identified as a bl lac object possibly residing in a spiral host galaxy ( wurtz , stocke & yee 1996 ) has also not been considered .",
    "for this study , a core is defined to be a compact feature between the two outer lobes of emission . for those without a detected core ,",
    "the upper limits to the core flux density are 3 times the rms noise in the image , and have been estimated only for those sources whose largest angular size is at least 5 times the resolution element .",
    "the fraction of emission from the core , f@xmath0 , or an upper limit to it at an emitted frequency of 8 ghz has been estimated for each source . to estimate this fraction , we have used a spectral index of 0 and 1 for the core and extended emission respectively , unless information was available in the literature .",
    "the sample consisting of 32 objects of which 14 are gps and 18 are css objects is listed in table  [ sample ] .",
    "23 of these are associated with galaxies and 9 with quasars .",
    "the projected linear size of the sample ranges from 0.02 to 11.3 kpc with a median value of 0.68 kpc , while the 5-ghz luminosity ranges from 1.3@xmath1110@xmath12 to 1.2@xmath1110@xmath13 whz@xmath6 with a median value of 7.6@xmath1110@xmath14 whz@xmath6 .",
    "the values of f@xmath0 range from @xmath150.001 to 0.279 with a median value of 0.011 , while those of n(hi ) range from @xmath150.06@xmath1110@xmath16 to 84.2@xmath1110@xmath16 @xmath17 with a median value which is less than 1.8@xmath1110@xmath16 @xmath17 . in this paper",
    ", we will refer to sources with core prominence lesser and greater than the median value as having lower and intermediate values .",
    "the sources with the highest values of f@xmath0 are not represented in our sample since they would not be classified as css and gps objects .",
    "to examine the dependence of hi column density on core prominence and also check for consistency with the unification scheme for radio galaxies and quasars , we plot the hi column density against the core fraction ( fig .",
    "[ nhivsfc ] ) . in our sample , there is only one hi detection for the 9 quasars and 15 detections for the 23 galaxies , consistent with orientation effects playing a significant role in the detection of hi absorption .",
    "the quasars have a higher median value of f@xmath0 of @xmath180.028 compared with 0.011 for the galaxies .",
    "these trends are broadly consistent with the expectations for the unification scheme .",
    "one of the striking features seen in fig .",
    "[ nhivsfc ] is that 10 of the 15 galaxies that have a detected hi absorption feature , also have a detected radio core , compared with only 2 out 0f 8 sources without an hi detection .",
    "this suggests that detection of a radio core in galaxies enhances the probability of detecting a 21-cm absorption feature . dividing the galaxies into two roughly equal groups at the median value of f@xmath0@xmath180.011 , 9 of the 11 with f@xmath0@xmath190.011 ( i.e. intermediate values of core fraction )",
    "have a detected absorption feature compared with 6 out of 12 detections in the other group with lower values of f@xmath0 .",
    "the median value of n(hi ) , using upper limits as their values , for the intermediate f@xmath0 group is @xmath183.7@xmath1110@xmath16 @xmath17 compared with 1.5@xmath1110@xmath16 @xmath17 for the lower f@xmath0 group .",
    "a kolmogorov - smirnov test shows the distributions to be different at a significance level of @xmath1895 per cent .",
    "thus for galaxies , there is a tendency for the detection rate as well as the column density to increase with the degree of core prominence . for the 9 quasars in our sample , there is only one detection and hence it is not meaningful to do a similar exercise . but",
    "clearly , sources with the lowest values of f@xmath0 do not tend to have the higher values of n(hi ) .",
    "it is important to enquire whether such a trend is consistent with the unification scheme for radio galaxies and quasars .",
    "the deficit of high column density values for sources with low values of f@xmath0 can be understood in a scenario where the radio source sizes are larger than the scale of the circumnuclear disk which contributes most of the absorbing gas , so that the line of sight to the lobes at very large inclinations ( corresponding to small values of f@xmath0 ) does not intersect the hi disk . for intermediate values of f@xmath0",
    ", one would then expect higher detection rate as well as higher values of n(hi ) as seen in fig .",
    "[ nhivsfc ] . for angles close to the line of sight , which would have the highest values of f@xmath0",
    ", one would expect small values of n(hi ) and much lower detection rates due to the line of sight passing largely through the ionization cone and also through regions of the disk with a high spin temperature due to the presence of an agn ( bahcall & ekers 1969 ) .",
    "such sources will usually get classified as compact flat spectrum ( cfs ) sources and not many of them with similar properties as the sources in our sample have been searched for 21-cm absorption ( cf .",
    "gupta et al . 2006 ) .",
    "the neutral hydrogen column density as a function of linear size for our sample of 32 radio sources is shown in fig .",
    "[ nhivsl ] .",
    "this shows the anti - correlation between the hi column density and source size reported by pihlstrm et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and extended to a larger sample of 96 sources by gupta et al .",
    "thus detection probability of 21-cm absorption feature is higher for both small sources and those with intermediate values of core prominence .",
    "it may be noted that projected linear size and f@xmath0 for this sample show no significant relation .",
    "in addition to the circumnuclear disk , absorption could also occur in neutral clouds that are part of the gas that has been accelerated by interaction with a radio jet .",
    "gas outflows as fast and broad as @xmath181000 km s@xmath6 have been detected in a number of radio sources in neutral as well as ionised gas ( see morganti , tadhunter & oosterloo 2005 ) .",
    "the kinematical and spatial properties of these suggest that they are being driven by the same mechanism i.e. interaction with the expanding radio jets .",
    "the dynamical interaction of the radio source with these clouds could distort the morphology of the radio source thereby affecting the symmetry parameters such as the separation ratio and the misalignment angle .",
    "the separation ratio , r@xmath1 , is defined to be the ratio of the separation of the further component from the core to the nearer one , while the misalignment angle , @xmath2 , is defined to be the supplement of the angle formed at the core by the outer hotspots .",
    "such jet - cloud interactions may also affect the velocity of the absorbing cloud relative to the systemic velocity of the galaxy .",
    "however , we find no evidence of any significant dependence of the hi column density as well as the relative velocity of the primary absorption component on either the separation ratio or the misalignment angle ( figs .",
    "[ nhivsasym ] and [ vshvsasym ] ) .",
    "but this does not rule out the importance of the role played by jet - cloud interactions in the observed structures of these sources as there exists significant evidence for this in terms of structural , brightness and polarization symmetry parameters ( saikia et al .",
    "1995 ; 2001 ; saikia & gupta 2003 ) .",
    "for a sample of css and gps objects , we have examined the dependence of hi column density on the degree of core prominence and projected linear size . in our sample ,",
    "15 out of 23 galaxies exhibit 21-cm absorption as against 1 out of 9 quasars , which is broadly consistent with the unification scheme .",
    "the detection rate as well as the hi column density appears to be larger for galaxies with more prominent cores , with the higher column densities occurring in intermediate values of f@xmath0 and not in the lowest values of f@xmath0 .",
    "this broad trend can be understood in the unification scheme if the lines of sight towards the lobes of sources with the lowest values of f@xmath0 , which are inclined at the largest angles to the line of sight , do not pass through the circumnuclear hi disk .",
    "this could happen if the source sizes are larger than the scale of the disk .",
    "it is interesting to note that 10 of the 15 galaxies with a detected hi absorption feature also has a detected radio core , compared with 2 out of 8 galaxies without any hi detection .",
    "our sample also shows an inverse relationship between the hi column density and the projected linear size , suggesting that both small sizes and more prominent cores enhance the probability of detecting hi absorption in css and gps objects .",
    "in addition to the disk , hi absorption may also be due to clouds of cold gas , some of which may have interacted with the radio jet .",
    "we , however , find that the hi column density and the velocity shift of the primary absorption component relative to the systemic velocity show no dependence on the degree of misalignment and the separation ratio .",

    "we also thank the numerous contributers to the gnu / linux group . this research has made use of the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) which is operated by the jet propulsion laboratory , california institute of technology , under contract with the national aeronautics and space administration .",
