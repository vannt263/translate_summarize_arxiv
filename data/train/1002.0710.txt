    "when lvy @xcite introduced his famous curve in 1938 , he also constructed fractal surfaces in a similar way .",
    "70 years later , we have plenty of papers on fractal sets in the plane , and a number of general statements and constructions which hold in every dimension , but very few studies on the geometry of fractals in dimension @xmath0    visualization is certainly one reason to prefer plane sets : they can be easily shown on a computer screen . in dimension 3 , visualization is more difficult , even though there are good ray - tracing programs , like chaoscope @xcite and ifs builder @xcite , which allow to look at three - dimensional fractals from any chosen viewpoint , with prescribed light sources .",
    "figure [ twin6 ] shows two views of one of our main examples . does it have interior points ?",
    "if so , is the interior connected ? is the figure simply connected ? unlike in two dimensions , the answer to such questions can hardly be guessed from the pictures - this requires tools which we develop here",
    ".    there are several mathematical difficulties in dimension @xmath0 we avoid the problem that linear maps do usually not commute , by concentrating ourselves to fractals generated by a single matrix .",
    "but there is another problem which will concern us : proper self - similarity is rather an exceptional case .",
    "the moduli of all eigenvalues of a @xmath1 matrix do rarely coincide while for a @xmath2 matrix they coincide as soon as the eigenvalues are complex .",
    "this problem is addressed in section 2 , and theorem 2.3 implies that in @xmath3 there is essentially only one type of ` integer ' self - similar tile with 2 up to 7 pieces .",
    "other difficulties concern the topology of three - dimensional fractals .",
    "our main aim here is to study the topology of self - affine tiles , and of their boundaries which are fractal surfaces . in particular",
    ", we would like to know which of these tiles are homeomorphic to a closed ball . in two dimensions ,",
    "the corresponding question for disk - like tiles was discussed in a large number of papers @xcite ( more references can be found in @xcite ) , and jordan curve arguments were heavily used . among others , it is easy to see that connectedness of the interior of a self - affine tile in the plane is sufficient for its disk - likeness . in @xmath3",
    "this is not the case .",
    "the topology of the boundary of a tile can be much more complicated than in @xmath4 even the connectedness of a tile is not so easy to verify @xcite .    the geometric phenomena which we encounter in fractal tiles are not caused by knots or wild spheres @xcite .",
    "it is rather the self - affine fibre structure of the boundary which makes the topology complicated .",
    "apparently , the different eigenvalues of the generating matrix produce long and thin fibres which can pierce the interior of neighboring tiles , or distort the boundary structure .",
    "we develop algebraic tools which describe the geometry of a self - affine tile @xmath5 in arbitrary dimension , in a similar way as homotopy and homology groups describe the geometry of manifolds .",
    "our tools use self - affinity in a specific way , and they yield quite detailed information about the geometry . the basic concept is the _ neighbor graph _ @xmath6 it can be considered as a blueprint of @xmath5 which contains all information about the topology of @xmath5 in a simple scheme . in the case",
    "where @xmath5 tiles by translations in a unique way , the vertices @xmath7 are those translations for which @xmath8 belongs to the tiling and intersects @xmath9 such translations @xmath10 will be called neighbor maps , and they do not only represent the neighboring piece @xmath8 but also the boundary set @xmath11 of @xmath9 this set can be a face , an ` edge ' or just a point of @xmath12 or a more complicated fractal boundary set .",
    "for a ball - like tile we expect that faces are homeomorphic to disks and edges are homeomorphic to intervals , and we have to check this idea .    neighbors in lattice tilings were introduced by indlekofer , ktai and racsko @xcite , and neighbor maps for self - similar sets were defined by bandt and graf @xcite . for a self - affine tile ,",
    "the boundary sets have themselves a self - affine structure : each face or edge is the union of smaller copies of other boundary sets .",
    "this is indicated by the edges of the graph @xmath13 the definition of @xmath14 in section 3 implies that the boundary @xmath15 is a self - affine graph - directed construction in the sense of mauldin and williams @xcite , and the graph which directs this construction is @xmath14 itself .",
    "this fact was stated by scheicher and thuswaldner @xcite for lattice tiles , and used in many other papers to determine the hausdorff dimension and topological structure of @xmath16 for plane self - similar tiles @xcite .",
    "some authors @xcite prefer the contact matrix defined by grchenig and haas @xcite which describes a subgraph of @xmath13    a first application of the neighbor graph concerns the existence of self - affine lattice tilings , a problem treated in @xcite and in a series of papers by vince @xcite .",
    "theorem 5.1 shows that the existence of such tilings is equivalent to the compatibility of all neighbors , which can be easily checked with @xmath13    in sections 7 to 12 we study the topology of the boundary of @xmath9 in section 8 we define the hierarchy of different boundary sets like faces , edges , points etc . which corresponds to the hierarchy of sets with different hausdorff dimensions in mauldin - williams constructions .",
    "an important problem is to determine all _ faces _  those boundary sets which cover an open set on the boundary .",
    "two methods are developed for this purpose .",
    "theorem 9.2 gives an algorithmic approach which only uses the combinatorics of the neighbor graph .",
    "theorem 10.1 provides an analytic approach based on recent work by he and lau @xcite and akiyama and loridant @xcite , connected with eigenvalues of adjacency matrices and hausdorff dimension . in section 11",
    "we define a polyhedral structure of fractal tiles by the intersection sets of two and more faces .",
    "there are corresponding neighbor intersection graphs @xmath17 which allow to calculate details of the polyhedral structure and compare it with the structure of ordinary polyhedra .",
    "in contrast to the contact matrix , all these tools can also be applied to tiles with incompatible neighbors as well as to fractals which are not tiles , and neighbors can be related by arbitrary isometries of @xmath3 instead of translations . to illustrate our methods , we selected a small class of examples , which is introduced in section 6 : the _ twindragons .",
    "_ these are the self - affine lattice tiles with two pieces .",
    "the one - dimensional twindragon is the interval . in the plane , there are three examples : rectangle or parallelogram , the twindragon and the tame twindragon .",
    "they are all disk - like @xcite . in three - dimensional space , there are seven examples , which we denote by letters to . while is conjugate to a cube , and have an extremely intricate structure .",
    "we mention some of their properties without proof . for",
    "and we determine the boundary faces and their intersections , and we show that their interior is not simply connected . and seem to be homeomorphic to a ball .",
    "in section 12 we determine their exact polyhedral structure .",
    "we show that they have faces which are not homeomorphic to a disk , but has connected interior .",
    "this paper focusses on concepts rather than algorithmic questions although it seems clear that the neighbor graph and related finite automata are well - suited for computerized evaluation .",

    "a sufficient condition is @xcite @xmath40 in which case @xmath41 is called a _ standard digit set _ or _ complete residue system . _ the latter name comes from the fact that for @xmath42 , the subgroup @xmath43 of the additive group @xmath18 has @xmath44 residue classes , so by ( [ selfb ] ) each class is represented by exactly one @xmath45 see lagarias and wang @xcite who also studied non - standard digit sets . in this paper , we consider only standard digit sets .",
    "the self - affine tile @xmath5 is called _ self - similar _ if the mapping @xmath29 is a similarity mapping with respect to the euclidean metric . in this case , we must distinguish the standard basis which defines the euclidean distance , and the basis for the lattice @xmath18 which need not be orthonormal .",

    "from @xmath14 we have the equation @xmath535 on the other hand @xmath536 we have seen that @xmath537 and @xmath538 intersect @xmath539 in a single point , and this also holds for their images under @xmath540 or @xmath541 thus @xmath542 and @xmath543 have only one common point .",
    "so @xmath530 consists of two isometric pieces which intersect in a singleton , and can not be homeomorphic to a disk .",
    "it should be mentioned that the polyhedron in figure [ twinpo ] describes only topologically - the metric structure is completely different .",

    "in this section , we go a small step towards proving our conjecture , by proving that the interior of is connected .",

    "we put @xmath565 where @xmath566 means @xmath562 minus its one - point boundary sets .",
    "then @xmath567 since @xmath568 contains @xmath569 and @xmath570 the set @xmath568 intersects @xmath571 and @xmath572 to apply proposition 13.1 , it only remains to verify that @xmath568 is connected . since twindragons are connected ( cf .",
    "section 7 ) , each @xmath573 is connected",
    ". moreover , there are pairs of opposite paths from the root in @xmath14 with labels @xmath574 and @xmath575 hence also with @xmath576 and @xmath577 and also with @xmath10 and @xmath577 which all end in a vertex of @xmath14 corresponding to a face . thus @xmath578 and @xmath579 @xmath580 and @xmath581 as well as @xmath582 and @xmath580 have a face in common .",

    "identify @xmath599 with @xmath600 and define the edges according to definition 11.1 .",
    "then we apply step ( iii ) as above , to exclude empty intersections .    to identify point neighbors in @xmath197 we use the adjacency matrix @xmath399 defined in section 10 .",
