    "boltzmann - gibbs statistics is used to study the systems having the following conditions :    \\(i )  the spatial range of the microscopic interactions are short - ranged ,    \\(ii )  the time range of the microscopic memory is short - ranged ,",
    "\\(iii ) the system evolves in a euclidean - like space - time .",
    "these kinds of systems are said to be extensive .",
    "if a system does not obey these restrictions , boltzmann - gibbs statistics seems to be inappropriate and a non - extensive formalism must be used .",
    "tsallis thermostatistics ( tt ) is one of these formalisms .",
    "tt has been applied to some concepts of thermostatistics [ 1 ] and also achieved in solving some physical systems , where bg statistics is known to fail : stellar polytropes [ 2 ] , levy - like anomalous diffusions [ 3 - 7 ] , two - dimensional euler turbulence [ 8 ] , solar neutrino problem [ 9 ] , velocity distributions of galaxy clusters [ 10 ] , fully developed turbulence [ 11 - 14 ] , electron - positron and other high - energy collisions [ 15 - 19 ] , anomalous diffusion of hydra viridissima [ 20 ] and nematic liquid crystals [ 21 ] .    since the paper by tsallis [ 22 ] , there has been a growing tendency to nonextensive statistical formalism .",
    "it has been shown that this formalism is useful , because it provides a suitable theoretical tool to explain some of the experimental situations , where standard thermostatistics seems to fail , due to the presence of long - range interactions , or long - range memory effects , or multi - fractal space - time constraints .",
    "tt has been applied to various concepts of thermostatistics and achieved in solving some physical systems , where boltzmann - gibbs statistics is known to fail .",
    "recently , oliveira et al .",
    "[ 23 ] have pursued the idea , based on novel experimental and theoretical results , that manganites are magneticallynon - extensive objects .",
    "this property appears in systems where long - range interactions and/or fractality exist , and such features have been invoked in recent models of manganites , as well as in the interpretation of experimental results .",
    "therefore we could expect that this kind of materials could be examined within a non - extensive thermostatistics , one of which is called tsallis thermostatistics ( tt ) and as you can see in our paper , tt has been applied to various concepts of thermostatistics and achieved in solving some physical systems , where boltzmann - gibbs statistics is known to fail . on the other hand",
    ", we are still working on application of tt on thermoluminescence process , so another studies on this subject are forthcoming , experimentally and theoretically .",
    "tt considers three possible choices for the form of a nonextensive expectation value .",
    "these choices have been studied in [ 24 ] and applied to two systems ; the classical harmonic oscillator and the quantum harmonic oscillator . in that study ,",
    "tsallis et al .",
    "studied three different alternatives for the internal energy constraint .",
    "the first choice is the conventional one ,    @xmath8    the second choice is given by    @xmath9    and regarded as the canonical one .",
    "both of these choices have been applied to many different systems in the last years [ 25 ] .",
    "however both of them have undesirable difficulties .",
    "the third choice for the internal energy constraint is    @xmath10    this choice is commonly considered to study physical systems because it is the most appropriate one , and is denoted as the tsallis - mendes - plastino ( tmp ) choice .",
    "@xmath11 index is called the entropic index and comes from the entropy definition ,    @xmath12    where @xmath13 is a constant , @xmath14 is the probability of the system in the @xmath15 microstate , @xmath16 is the total number of configurations . in the limit @xmath17",
    ", the entropy reduces to the well - known boltzmann - gibbs ( shannon ) entropy .",
    "the optimization of @xmath18 leads to    @xmath19 ^{\\frac{1}{1-q}}}{% z_{q}^{(3)}}\\ ] ]    with    @xmath20 ^{\\frac{1}{1-q}}.\\ ] ]    this equation is an implicit one for the probabilities @xmath21 .",
    "therefore the @xmath22 @xmath23 @xmath24 of an observable is defined as    @xmath25    where @xmath26 denotes any observable quantity which commutes with the hamiltonian .",
    "this expectation value recovers the conventional expectation one when @xmath27 .",
    "as mentioned above , eq.(11 ) is an implicit one and in order to solve this equation , tsallis et al .",
    "suggest two different approaches ;  @xmath28 @xmath29  and  @xmath30  transformation .",
    "the luminescence intensity of a pre - irradiated phosphor is recorded as a function of the rising temperature .",
    "the resulting curve between the luminescence intensity and temperature , known as the glow curve , first increases and then , after reaching a maximum , decreases .",
    "if n represents the ocuupied trap density at time t , thenthe following equation gives the rate of thermal release of electron at temperature t within tsallis thermostatistics :    @xmath31    it is important to note that the rate is expressed as a power law rather than exponential one .",
    "if the phosphor is heated at a constant rate of increase of temperature , i.e. @xmath1 the above equation can be rewritten as @xmath32    we assume that  initially at the start of heating , @xmath3 , @xmath4",
    ". then the integration of eq.(13 ) results in @xmath33    the thermoluminescence intensity @xmath6 as a function of temperature is given as : @xmath34   \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\left ( 1+(1-q)\\left ( \\frac{\\left ( -\\frac{s}{r}% \\int_{t_{i}}^{t}(1-(1-q)e / kt^{\\prime } ) ^{(\\frac{1}{1-q})}dt^{\\prime } \\right ) ^{\\frac{1}{1-q}}-1}{1-q}\\right ) \\right ) ^{\\frac{1}{1-q}}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    figure shows the computed glow curves corresponding to eq.(15 ) .",
    "the parameters in the eq.(15 ) are : @xmath35 , electron trap depth @xmath36 and @xmath37 . in the figure , it is shown the effect of the nonextensivity . in other words , if the rate of thermal release of electrons at temperature t is expressed as a power law relation , then the glow intensity vs temperature behaves as shown in the figure .",
    "an interesting point is that in all the curves corresponding to different values of @xmath11 entropic index , the intensity approximately has the same value at @xmath38 .",
    "presumably there is some normalization at 390 k in order to compare with @xmath39 case .",
    "the peak sequence moves smoothly with @xmath11 value , this is in much the same way as caused by changing thermoluminescence kinetics if one varies the relative number of trapping and recombination sites and includes secondary , or back reactions .",
    "whilst the data presented here are of a preliminary nature , it is sufficient to give encouragement for further developments .",
