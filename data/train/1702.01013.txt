    "therefore , introducing disorder in form of chemical impurity , which is expected to tune either or both the @xmath14 and @xmath17 parameters , appears to be an effective route to understand the magnetism of original system .",

    "however , signature of gp has been evidenced in isovalent doped sr@xmath0ca@xmath1ruo@xmath2 which the authors have ascribed to the fact that suppression of ru - o - ru bond angle with ca substitution dilutes fm interaction through ru - o - ru bonds , hence gp behavior is induced.@xcite the gp picture is further supported by a recent band calculation using dft and dmft approach showing presence of both itinerant and local moment model of magnetism in srruo@xmath2 , particularly local type magnetic moment persists above @xmath5.@xcite in this scenario , we believe that gp behavior arises as a consequence of site dilution which renders small size ferromagnetically aligned clusters above @xmath5 .",
