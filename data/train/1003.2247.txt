    "quantum key distribution ( qkd ) has attracted great attention as an unconditionally secure key distribution scheme .",
    "the basic idea of qkd protocol is to exploit the quantum mechanical principle that observation in general disturbs the system being observed .",
    "thus , if there is an eavesdropper ( eve ) listening while the two legitimate communicating users , namely alice and bob , attempt to transmit their key , the presence of the eavesdropper will be visible as a disturbance of the communication channel that alice and bob are using to generate the secret key .",
    "alice and bob can then throw out the key bits established while eve was listening in , and start over .",
    "the key generation rate , which is the length of the securely sharable key per channel use , is one of the most important criteria for the efficiency of the qkd protocol . the first qkd protocol , which was proposed in 1984 @xcite , is called bb84 after its inventors ( bennet and brassard )",
    ".    qkd protocol usually consists of two parts : a quantum and a classical part . in the quantum part",
    ", alice sends qubits prepared in certain states to bob .",
    "the states of these qubits are encodings of bit values randomly chosen by alice .",
    "bob performs a measurement on the qubits to decode the bit values . for each of the bits , both the encoding and decoding",
    "are chosen from a certain set of operators .",
    "after the transmission steps , alice and bob apply _ sifting _ where they publicly compare the encoding and decoding operator they have used and keep only the bit pairs for which these operators _",
    "match_.    once alice and bob have correlated bit strings , they proceed with the classical part of the protocol . in a first step , called _",
    "parameter estimation _",
    ", they compare the bit values for randomly chosen samples from their strings to estimate the quantum channel .",
    "after the parameter estimation , alice and bob proceed with a classical processing , where alice and bob share a secret key based on their bit sequences obtained in the quantum part .",
    "mathematically , quantum channels are described by trace preserving completely positive ( tpcp ) maps @xcite .",
    "conventionally , in the bb84 protocol , we only used the statistics of the matched measurement outcomes , which are transmitted and received in the same basis , to estimate the tpcp map that describes the quantum channel , while the mismatched measurement outcomes , which are transmitted and received in different bases , were discarded .",
    "however , watanabe _ et al . _",
    "@xcite showed that by using the statistics of _ both _ matched and mismatched measurement outcomes , the tpcp maps describing the quantum channel can be estimated more accurately .",
    "they implemented a practical classical processing for the six - state and bb84 protocols that utilizes their accurate channel estimation method and showed that the key rates obtained with their method were at least as high as the key rates obtained with the standard processing by shor and preskill @xcite .    in the bb84 protocol @xcite",
    ", alice creates random bits of 0 and 1 with equal probability .",
    "then , alice and bob each chooses between the two bases , i.e.  the rectilinear basis ( or @xmath0 basis ) of vertical ( @xmath1 ) and horizontal ( @xmath2 ) polarizations , and the diagonal basis ( or @xmath3 basis ) of @xmath4 and @xmath5 polarizations , with equal probability .",
    "@xcite proposed a simple modification of the standard bb84 protocol @xcite by assigning significantly different probabilities to the different polarization bases during both transmission and reception .",
    "they showed that the modification could reduce the fraction of mismatched measurement outcomes , thus nearly doubles the efficiency of the bb84 protocol .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a modification of the bb84 protocol by assigning a different transmission probability to each transmitted qubit _ within _ a single polarization basis . while in classical information , assignment of different probability to each input bit can increase the mutual information of asymmetric channels (",
    "* problem 7.8 ) , in quantum key distribution the benefit of assigning a different transmission probability to each transmitted qubit was unknown .",
    "we show that by setting a different transmission probability to each transmitted qubit , we can improve the key rate and achieve a higher key rate .",
    "we demonstrate this fact by using the accurate channel estimation over the amplitude damping channel .",
    "we determine the optimum bit transmission probability that maximizes the key rate .",
    "in this section , we describe a modification of the bb84 protocol where the transmission probability of each qubit within a single polarization basis is not necessarily equal .",
    "the protocol consists of a quantum and a classical part .",
    "the quantum part includes the distribution and measurement of quantum information , and is determined by the operators that alice and bob use for their encoding and decoding .    for simplicity",
    ", we assume that eve s attack is the collective attack , i.e.  the channel connecting alice and bob is given by tensor products of a channel @xmath6 from a qubit density matrix to itself . as is usual in a lot of qkd literature",
    ", we assume that eve can access all the environment of channel @xmath6 .",
    "the channel to the environment is denoted by @xmath7 .      in the modified bb84 protocol ,",
    "alice chooses random bits of 0 and 1 according to the probability distribution @xmath8 alice modulates each bit into a transmission basis that is randomly chosen from the @xmath0 basis @xmath9 and the @xmath3 basis @xmath10 , where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the eigenstates of the pauli matrix @xmath13 for @xmath14 .",
    "we occasionaly omit the subscripts @xmath15 of the basis , and the basis @xmath16 is regarded as @xmath0 basis unless otherwise stated .",
    "then bob randomly chooses one of the measurement observables @xmath13 for @xmath14 , and converts a measurement result @xmath17 or @xmath18 into a bit @xmath19 or @xmath20 , respectively .",
    "note that alice and bob keep the the mismatched measurement outcomes to estimate the channel more accurately .      the classical part of the protocol that we consider is essentially the same as the classical part of the protocol proposed by watanabe _ et al . _ @xcite .",
    "however , since we assign a different transmission probability to each transmitted qubit with a single polarization basis ( see eq .",
    "( [ probx ] ) ) , some adjustments need to be made accordingly .",
    "the classical part of our protocol consists of two subprotocols , called _",
    "parameter estimation _ and _ classical post - processing_. the main purpose of the parameter estimation subprotocol is to estimate the amount of information gained by the eavesdropper eve during the distribution of the quantum information .",
    "after the parameter estimation , alice and bob proceed with a classical subprotocol .",
    "hereafter , we treat only alice s bit sequence @xmath21 that is transmitted in @xmath0 basis and the corresponding bob s bit sequence @xmath22 that is received in @xmath23 measurement , where @xmath24 is the finite field of order 2 .",
    "our goal is to generate a secure key pair @xmath25 , using @xmath26 and @xmath27 . here",
    "alice and bob want to generate a key pair @xmath25 which is statistically independent of eve s information by cloning the quantum objects and looking at the conversation over the public authenticated channel .",
    "the protocol we consider is _ one - way _",
    ", i.e.  only communication from alice to bob or from bob to alice , is needed .",
    "it consists of the following steps :    1 .",
    "_ information reconciliation _ :",
    "alice sends error correction information to bob . using the correction information ,",
    "bob decode the bit string @xmath27 into an estimate of @xmath26 .",
    "privacy amplification _ :",
    "alice randomly chooses a hash function from a set of universal hash functions and sends the choice to bob over the public channel .",
    "then , alice and bob compute @xmath28 and @xmath29 , respectively",
    ".    the above procedure is usually called _ the direct reconciliation_. the procedure in which the roles of alice and bob are switched is called _ the reverse reconciliation _ @xcite .",
    "since the pair of the sequences @xmath30 is transmitted and received in @xmath0 basis , they are independently identically distributed according to @xmath31 note that the distribution @xmath32 can be estimated from the statistics of the sample bits that are transmitted in @xmath0 basis and measured by the observable @xmath23 .",
    "the secure key rate is determined according to the result of the privacy amplification @xcite . for the direct reconciliation ,",
    "let @xmath33 be the conditional von neumann entropy with respect to density matrix @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the von neumann entropy for a density matrix @xmath36 and @xmath37 is the probability distribution shown in eq .",
    "( [ probx ] ) . the secure key rate @xcite is @xmath38    while for the reverse reconciliation , we can calculate the conditional von neumann entropy @xmath39 from the channel @xmath6 as follows .",
    "we define @xmath40 for the entangled state @xmath41 let @xmath42 be a purification of @xmath43 , and let @xmath44 $ ]",
    ". then the density matrix @xmath45 is derived by measurement on bob s system , i.e. @xmath46 for the reverse reconciliation , the secure key rate @xcite is @xmath47",
    "in the stokes parametrization , the qubit channel @xmath6 can be described by the affine map parametrized by 12 real parameters @xcite as follows : @xmath48\\mapsto \\left [ \\begin{array}{ccc } r_{zz } & r_{zx } & r_{zy } \\\\",

    "( [ channelparam ] ) .",
    "thus we can only estimate the parameters @xmath51 by the accurate channel estimation @xcite and we have to consider the worst case @xcite for the parameters @xmath52 , i.e. @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the set of all parameters @xmath55 such that the parameters @xmath52 and @xmath56 constitute a qubit channel , and @xmath57 is the density matrix which corresponds to the parameter @xmath56 .",
    "we can simplify the form of the desired function @xmath58 when eve s ambiguity is convex @xcite .",
    "we can prove the convexity of eve s ambiguity with respect to @xmath6 in our protocol by using the same technique used by watanabe _",
    "* lemma 2 ) . by the convexity of eve s ambiguity , the minimization in eq .",
    "( [ fomega1 ] ) is achieved when the parameters @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 , are all @xmath19 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 1 ) .",
    "hence , the number of free parameters can be reduced to 1 and the remaining free parameter is @xmath64 .",
    "thus the the problem is rewritten as looking for an estimator of @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the set of parameters @xmath64 such that the parameters @xmath52 and @xmath64 consitute a qubit channel when other parameters are all @xmath19 , and @xmath67 is the density matrix corresponding to the parameter @xmath64 .      in this section , we calculate the key rates of the bb84 protocol with our proposed procedure over the amplitude damping channel , and determine the optimum bit transmission probability that maximizes the key generation rate .",
    "we clarify the fact that the key rates using the optimum bit transmission probability of the proposed bb84 protocol is higher than those of the conventional protocol @xcite .    in the stokes parametrization , the amplitude damping channel @xmath68",

    ", we can set @xmath77 .",
    "furthermore , by the condition on the tpcp map @xcite @xmath78 we can decide the remaining parameter as @xmath79 .    by straightforward calculation",
