    "entropy is a quantity of large relevance in different areas of physics .",
    "being at the foundation of thermodynamics and information theory @xcite , the concept of entropy is even capable to describe the information content of black holes @xcite . despite its well - known properties @xcite ,",
    "a numerical computation of the entropy can be rather difficult .",
    "this is especially the case when the classical definition of entropy is applied in the quantum domain where the state of a system is generically described by a density operator .",
    "the von neumann entropy @xcite of a quantum state allows to quantify the amount of disorder in a system and has shown to be a valid quantifier of entanglement between two subsystems @xcite . for pure states ,",
    "the entropy of entanglement is defined as the von neumann entropy of the reduced density operator @xcite , whereas for mixed states several definitions exist , e.g.  the relative entropy of entanglement @xcite . here",
    ", we are interested in computing the entropy of entanglement of pure states . as a concrete example",
    ", we consider in section  [ sc : qo ] an entangled two - photon state generated by spontaneous parametric down - conversion . under certain conditions to be specified , the reduced density operator of such a state assumes the shape of a large matrix with a number of rows and columns of order @xmath0 . in this case , the common approach to calculate the entropy of entanglement by means of the reduced density operator s eigenvalue spectrum fails .",
    "the here presented numerical algorithm computes the entropy of a large matrix without the prior knowledge of its eigenvalues .      in quantum mechanics",
    "the density operator of a given state is a hermitean , positive semidefinite operator .",
    "more specifically , focusing on real symmetric , positive semidefinite matrices  @xmath1 , i.e. , @xmath2 the _ entropy _ of  @xmath3 may be defined by @xmath4 here , @xmath5 signifies the spectrum of  @xmath3 , and  @xmath6 is a continuous function on the real interval  @xmath7 which is given by @xmath8    by the symmetry of  @xmath3 , the spectral theorem implies that  @xmath3 can be diagonalized by means of an orthogonal matrix  @xmath9 , @xmath10 , i.e. @xmath11 , where  @xmath12 , and  @xmath13 denote the eigenvalues of  @xmath3 .",
    "then , we may define the matrix function @xmath14 induced by   ( and denoted with the same letter ) in a standard way ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) by @xmath15 , where @xmath16 .",
    "furthermore , we see that @xmath17 .",
    "moreover , since the trace of a matrix is invariant with respect to similarity we arrive at @xmath18 at first glance , computing the entropy is possible by either applying  , i.e. , by computing the full spectrum of  @xmath3 , or by using formula   which involves the computation of the matrix logarithm .",
    "evidently , for large matrices , both approaches are prone to be computationally unfeasible due to their high degree of complexity .",
    "the goal of this paper is to calculate the entropy of a matrix _ without _ the need of finding the eigenvalues of  @xmath3 or the necessity of computing the matrix logarithm of  @xmath3 explicitly . to this end",
    ", two key ingredients will be taken into account :    * the function  @xmath6 will be approximated by a polynomial  @xmath19 ; in so doing the term  @xmath20 can be expressed approximately as a sum of powers of  @xmath3 .",
    "this avoids the computation of the matrix logarithm . * using the relations @xmath21 ,",
    "the entropy of  @xmath3 can be found approximately by computing the trace of @xmath22 .",
    "this quantity , in turn , may be determined numerically by appropriately combining a monte - carlo procedure and a clenshaw type scheme . in this way , the explicit computation of the matrix powers occurring in  @xmath22 can be circumvented .    applying these ideas",
    ", we will obtain a low - complexity algorithm for the matrix entropy which is still able to generate accurate computational results . as a practical application we will consider a two - photon state entangled in frequency .",
    "more precisely , we will consider a large density matrix resulting from suitable discretization of the related continuous operator .",
    "we will use the new algorithm developed in this paper to demonstrate entanglement quantification by means of the entropy for a large real - valued density matrix  @xmath1 , with a matrix size of the order  @xmath23 .",
    "the article is organized as follows : in section  [ sc : montecarlo ] we will recall a monte - carlo procedure proposed in  @xcite to compute the trace of a matrix function . subsequently , a chebyshev approximation polynomial of the function  @xmath6 will be derived in section  [ sc : p ] , together with a sharp error estimate with respect to the supremum norm .",
    "furthermore , section  [ sc : entropy ] contains the new algorithm and a probabilistic error analysis .",
    "next , we present some numerical examples including a traditional finite element matrix and the above - mentioned quantum optics application in section  [ sc : examples ] . finally , we draw some conclusions in section  [ sc : conclusions ] .    throughout the paper , @xmath24 denotes the euclidean norm .",
    "furthermore , @xmath25 signifies the trace of a matrix , i.e. , the sum of its diagonal entries .",
    "we note the fact that  @xmath26 for any  @xmath1 .",
    "we also notice that , for any  @xmath27 , there holds that @xmath28=-\\gamma_0\\tr\\left({\\mathcal{l}}\\left(\\gamma_0^{-1}\\bm a\\right)\\right)-\\log(\\gamma_0)\\tr(\\bm a).\\ ] ] the appealing property of this identity is that it allows to compute the entropy by means of the function  @xmath6 as _ restricted _ to the interval  @xmath29 $ ] . in particular , since we approximate  @xmath6 by a chebyshev polynomial , the interval of approximation can be limited from  @xmath30 $ ] to the smaller interval  @xmath31 $ ] , if  @xmath32 .",
    "the following proposition , see , e.g. ,  @xcite , motivates a monte - carlo procedure for the computation of the trace of a symmetric matrix . throughout the paper ,",
    "we let  @xmath33 , and  @xmath34 .",
    "[ pr : random ] consider a symmetric matrix @xmath1 with  @xmath35 .",
    "furthermore , let  @xmath36 be a random variable that takes values  @xmath37 and  @xmath38 with probability  @xmath39 each",
    ". moreover , let  @xmath40 be a vector of  @xmath41 independent samples generated by  @xmath36 .",
    "then , @xmath42 , where  @xmath43 denotes the expected value .    from a practical point of view",
    ", this result allows for the computation of a numerical approximation of the trace of a symmetric matrix  @xmath3 by taking the mean of a finite number  @xmath44 of sample computations , @xmath45 where  @xmath46 are random vectors like defined above .",
    "thence , recalling  , we find , for any  @xmath27 , that @xmath47    in order to provide bounds for terms of the form  @xmath48 , for  @xmath49 , we note the following lemma . it is based on an elementary analysis of the graph of  @xmath6 .",

    "then , there hold the estimates @xmath51 for any  @xmath52 $ ] . here , @xmath53 is the sign function ( with  @xmath54 ) .",
    "we continue by deriving some upper and lower bounds for  @xmath55 .",
    "[ co : bounds ] let  @xmath1 be real symmetric , and positive semidefinite , and  @xmath56 $ ] , for some  @xmath57 .",
    "furthermore , consider  @xmath58 .",

    "let  @xmath58 .",
    "we choose an orthogonal matrix  @xmath60 that diagonalizes  @xmath3 , i.e. @xmath61 .",
    "then , @xmath62 then , using the upper bound from lemma  [ lm : q ] and the identity  @xmath63 , it follows that @xmath64 the proof of the lower bound is completely analogous .",
    "[ rm : gamma0 ] suppose that  @xmath65 is the maximal eigenvalue of  @xmath3 .",

    "hence , by the previous corollary  [ co : bounds ] , we see that @xmath67 we may ask the question of how to choose  @xmath68 and  @xmath69 such that the upper and lower bound in the above estimates are as close as possible to each other . in other words , we seek  @xmath70 such that the function @xmath71\\ ] ] is minimal .",

    "the proposed procedure does neither require the computation of the spectrum nor of the matrix logarithm .",
