    "the large - scale structure revealed by the distribution of galaxies is believed to have formed through a process of gravitational instability , starting with primordial fluctuations in the early universe .",
    "but while self - gravity amplifies perturbations in the cosmic fluid , cosmic expansion suppresses them .",
    "their growth rate therefore depends rather sensitively on the dynamical expansion of the universe and may be used to discriminate between different models .",
    "measurements of the growth rate tend to focus on infall motions associated with condensing regions , with peculiar velocities largely correlated with the local gravitational potential .",
    "galaxies trace these motions , carrying an imprint of the changing growth rate as the universe evolves ( peacock et al . 2001 ;",

    "a principal statistical technique used to measure the growth rate is based on the redshift - space distortion ( rsd ) created by the galaxies peculiar velocities ( kaiser 1987 ) .",
    "specifically , maps produced with distances inferred from redshifts in spectroscopic galaxy surveys show that the galaxy distributions are anisotropic due to the fact that the redshifts contain components from both the smooth hubble flow and the peculiar velocities of the infalling matter .",
    "as long as one can reliably separate these two contributions to the redshift , one may thereby extract a history of the build - up of structure .    the use of rsd , however , is practical primarily before non - linear effects begin to emerge , where measurements yield information on both the matter over - density and the peculiar velocities of galaxies . in the linear regime ,",
    "the problem is typically reduced to solving a second - order differential equation for the time - dependent fluctuations , from which one may then infer their growth rate .",
    "thus , although objects suitable for this work can in principle include individual galaxies , clusters of galaxies , and superclusters , their density contrasts ( @xmath8 ) today are , respectively , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 .",
    "these estimates assume a critical density @xmath12 g @xmath13 , and that about @xmath14 @xmath15 of galactic matter are contained within a @xmath16 kpc region .",
    "clusters typically contain fewer than @xmath17 galaxies , while superclusters have tens of thousands of galaxies . in @xmath2cdm , @xmath18 during the matter - dominated era , so galaxies and clusters presumably ceased growing linearly , i.e. , grew with @xmath19 , at redshifts @xmath20 and @xmath21 , respectively .",
    "these structures are non - linear in the local neighborhood .",
    "the linear - growth analysis described in this paper therefore tends to address the formation of super - clusters , which could have grown linearly over the redshift range @xmath22 .",
    "this is the approach we shall follow in this paper , and therefore focus on surveys relevant to these large structures , including 2dfgrs ( peacock et al .",
    "2001 ) and vvds ( guzzo et al . 2008 ) .",
    "by now , the development of linear perturbation theory is quite mature  at least within the context of the standard model ( @xmath2cdm ) , in which dark energy corresponds to a cosmological constant @xmath2 .",
    "comparative tests using the growth of linear structure have been carried out between @xmath2cdm and an assortment of other cosmologies , principally those based on extensions to general relativity involving higher - order curvature terms or extra dimensions ( wetterich 1995 ; amendola 2000 ; dvali et al .",
    "2000 ; carroll et al . 2004",
    "; capozziello et al .",
    "however , measurements of the linear growth rate have not yet been used to test the @xmath1 universe ( melia 2007 ; melia and shevchuk 2012 ; melia 2016a , 2017 ) , another frw cosmology , which has thus far been shown to fit many other kinds of data better than @xmath2cdm .",
    "( a brief summary of these previously published results is provided in ",
    "3.1 below . )",
    "the principal aim of this paper is to address this deficiency .",
    "we are especially motivated to carry out this analysis by recent comparative studies using the alcock - paczyski test ( alcock and paczyski 1979 ) , based the changing ratio of angular to spatial / redshift size of ( presumed ) spherically - symmetric source distributions with distance ( melia and lpez - corredoira 2016 ) .",
    "the use of this diagnostic , with newly acquired measurements of the anisotropic distribution of bao peaks from sdss - iii / boss - dr11 at average redshifts @xmath23 and @xmath24 , has allowed us to determine the geometry of the universe with unprecedented accuracy .",
    "previous applications of the galaxy two - point correlation function to measure a redshift - dependent scale that could be used to determine the ratio of angular ( i.e. , transverse ) size to redshift ( i.e. , radial ) size were limited by the need to disentangle the acoustic scale in redshift space from redshift distortions from internal gravitational effects ( lpez - corredoira 2014 ) .",
    "a major limitation of this process was that inevitably one had to pre - assume a particular cosmological model , or adopt prior parameter values , in order to estimate the possible confusion between the true cosmological redshift interval from one edge of the cluster to the other and the contribution to this redshift width from these internal gravitational effects .",
    "unfortunately , the wide range of possible distortions for the same correlation - function shape resulted in very large errors associated with the bao peak position and hence the inferred acoustic scale ( often in the @xmath25 range ) .",
    "this situation has improved significantly over the past few years with ( 1 ) the use of reconstruction techniques ( eisenstein et al .",
    "2007 ; padmanabhan et al . 2012 ) that enhance the quality of the galaxy two - point correlation function , and ( 2 ) the use of ly-@xmath26 and quasar observations to more precisely determine their auto- and cross - correlation functions , allowing the measurement of bao peak positions to better than @xmath27 accuracy ( cuesta et al .",
    "the most recent determination of @xmath28 has been based on the use of three bao peak positions : the measurement of the bao peak position in the anisotropic distribution of sdss - iii / boss dr12 galaxies at @xmath29 and @xmath23 ( cuesta et al .",
    "2016 ) , in which a technique of reconstruction to improve the signal / noise ratio was applied ; and the self - correlation of the bao peak in the ly-@xmath26 forest in the sdss - iii / boss dr11 data at @xmath24 ( padmanabhan et al . 2012 ) , plus the cross - correlation of the bao peak of qsos and the ly-@xmath26 forest in the same survey ( font - ribera et al .",
    "2014 ) .    with these new measurements",
    ", the use of the alcock - paczyski diagnostic ( melia and lpez - corredoira 2016 ) has shown that the current concordance ( @xmath2cdm ) model is disfavoured by the bao data at @xmath30 .",
    "they instead show that the @xmath1 model has a probability @xmath31 ( i.e. , consistent with 1 ) of being correct .",
    "measurements of the linear growth rate also critically depend on the alcock - paczyski effect , so the observations considered in this paper provide an invaluable , complementary , set of data with which to test the @xmath1 cosmology .    in   2 of this paper , we derive the necessary formalism for studying the time evolution of linear fluctuations in this model , which reduces to solving a second - order differential equation , though with some important differences compared with its counterpart in @xmath2cdm .",
    "a contextual background for @xmath1 is provided in   3 , where we also solve the growth equation as a function of redshift , and describe the observables , specifically the volume - delimited variance @xmath32 of the fluctuations and its corresponding growth function .",
    "the standard model is analyzed in   4 , and we end with a discussion and conclusion in    5 and 6 .",
    "the equations describing the growth of linear perturbations in @xmath2cdm are well known so , for this model , we will simply adopt the key results from previous work and summarize these in   4 below . in the case of @xmath1 , however , it is essential to begin with relativistic perturbation theory , which we now describe .",
    "we will assume that small inhomogeneities emerge into the semi - classical universe out of the planck regime ( melia 2016b ) with an essentially scale - free distribution ( see below ) .",
    "the subsequent development of structure is usually assumed to have progressed through a series of steps , each corresponding to a particular , dominant component in the cosmic fluid , eventually leading to the formation of stars and galaxies . to study the growth of perturbations in an otherwise smooth background , it is helpful to know ( i ) the relative abundance of non - relativistic baryonic ( b ) and cold - dark matter ( cdm ) ; ( ii ) the contribution to the total energy density @xmath33 and pressure @xmath34 from all the components in the cosmic fluid ; and ( iii ) the spectrum and type ( i.e. , adiabatic or isothermal ) of primeval density fluctuations .    newtonian theory , as a limiting approximation to general relativity ( gr ) , is only applicable within the hubble radius @xmath35 , where the effects of spacetime curvature are small . in the @xmath1 universe , the quantum fluctuations always have a wavelength ( or scale ) @xmath36 smaller than @xmath4 , and the perturbations that grow from these early seeds never stretch in size beyond this gravitational horizon . but the full gr theory is nonetheless still necessary when we are dealing with perturbations in relativistic matter , such as would occur in a baryonic fluid coupled to the radiation field , or in a fluid that includes energetic neutrinos .",
    "we consider perturbations about the background solution for the density and pressure , labeled with subscript @xmath37 , such that @xmath38 and @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the perturbed first - order variables that generally depend on the spatial coordinates @xmath42 as well as the time ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "( in this paper , we denote the spatial coordinates with indices @xmath44 , while greek indices refer to all four coordinates , with metric signature @xmath45 $ ] . ) in the linear regime , we have @xmath46 , and similarly for all the other first - order quantities .",
    "different perturbative modes therefore evolve independently of each other and may be treated separately .    for simplicity , we consider only barotropic fluids with @xmath47 and , following convention , we use a dimensionless density variable @xmath48 , etc .",
    "in all the equations .",
    "we define the background equation - of - state parameter @xmath49 which includes the contributions to @xmath50 and @xmath51 from all the components in the cosmic fluid , and the adiabatic sound speed , @xmath52 , within the fluctuation , where @xmath53 , so that @xmath54 which depends principally on the perturbed quantities @xmath41 and @xmath40 .    in deriving the dynamical equations for the evolution of the perturbations , one must carefully distinguish between the different roles played by the background quantities @xmath50 and @xmath51 , and the fluctuations @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "the former dominate the evolution of the hubble constant @xmath55 in ( cosmic ) time @xmath56 , while the local growth is heavily influenced by the gravitational potential associated with the fluctuations themselves .",
    "of course , einstein s field equations contain a single stress - energy tensor @xmath57 encompassing all of the sources ( i.e. , @xmath58 , @xmath59 ) but , as we shall see , once the dynamical equations are linearized , some terms depend predominantly on @xmath50 and @xmath51 , while others contain only the perturbed amplitudes . the equations we will use allow for the possible evolution of a matter perturbation embedded within an otherwise smooth background , such as we would encounter in a radiation - dominated , or dark energy dominated , universe . in every case , however , the expansion rate is always driven by @xmath60 and @xmath61 .    in the relativistic treatment of fluctuation growth , we perturb both the spacetime metric and the stress - energy tensor @xmath57 representing the sources .",
    "the details of how one linearizes the einstein field equations have appeared in many previous publications , and we refer the reader to some of these excellent works ( weinberg 1972 ; landau and lifshitz 1975 ; peebles 1980 ; press and vishniac 1980 ; kolb and turner 1990 ; padmanabhan 1993 ; peebles 1993 ; coles and lucchin 1995 ; peacock 1999 ; liddle and lyth 2000 ; tsagas et al .",
    "we follow the covariant lagrangian approach , employing locally - defined quantities , and we derive their evolution along the worldlines of _ comoving _ observers .",
    "there is therefore a slight difference between the proper time @xmath62 defined at each spacetime point , and the cosmic time @xmath56 , since the perturbations somewhat shift the local frame out of the hubble flow ( in which @xmath56 would otherwise be the proper time everywhere ) .",
    "fortunately , there is a straightforward way to deal with such ` gauge ' issues using the coordinate transformation @xmath63    the energy conservation law reads @xmath64 and it is straightforward to see from equations  ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) that ( padmanabhan 1993 ; liddle and lyth 2000 ) @xmath65 in addition , @xmath66 and @xmath67 where @xmath68 , @xmath69 is the smoothed hubble constant driven by the background fluid ( i.e. , @xmath50 and @xmath51 ) at time @xmath56 , @xmath70 describes scalar deviations from the smooth background expansion rate represented by @xmath71 , and @xmath72 is the 4-dimensional laplacian operator .",
    "( @xmath71 should not be confused with the hubble constant today , which is usually also denoted with subscript  @xmath37 \" . )",
    "as we discuss below , @xmath50 in the @xmath1 universe appears to be dominated by dark energy and ( baryonic and dark ) matter at low redshifts , and dark energy and radiation in the early universe . in this paper , we focus on the more recent growth of perturbations , and we follow the conventional approach of assuming that dark energy ( @xmath73 ) is a smooth background , while the perturbations themselves are due solely to fluctuations in the matter density @xmath74 .",
    "we further assume , again conventionally , that once these matter perturbations start to condense out of the smooth cosmic fluid , they decouple from the dark energy , except through their gravitational interaction .",
    "we shall see shortly that in the @xmath1 universe , where @xmath75 , @xmath76 is constant to first order at low redshifts . in solving equations  ( 7)-(9 ) , we will therefore also retain the leading second - order terms to determine its time dependence , if any . from equation",
    "( 7 ) , it is straightforward to show that @xmath77 and therefore from equations  ( 8)-(10 ) , we find that @xmath78 to first - order , the gravitational ( third ) term on the left - hand side is zero , a result of the zero - active mass condition @xmath75 , for which the cosmic fluid experiences no net gravitational acceleration .",
    "we therefore assume that @xmath76 is ( at most ) a very weak function of @xmath56 , @xmath79 with @xmath80 . in that case , @xmath81 which we approximate as @xmath82 where @xmath83 is essentially constant with @xmath84 .",
    "and so equation  ( 11 ) reduces to the form @xmath85    the derivative term in equation  ( 15 ) requires some knowledge concerning the spatial variation of the fluctuation .",
    "this is typically handled via a wavenumber decomposition of @xmath40 , in which the density fluctuation is written as a fourier series , @xmath86 in terms of the comoving wavenumber @xmath87 and wavevector @xmath88 where , as always , @xmath89 .",
    "the fourier components may be calculated through the expression @xmath90 with this , and the fact that @xmath91 , it is straightforward to show from equation  ( 15 ) that the local growth rate equation in the @xmath1 universe may be written as @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the universal expansion factor .",
    "note that for the application we are considering in this paper , we have explicitly used the constant value @xmath94 , so terms proportional to @xmath95 have been omitted from these expressions ( cf .",
    "tsagas et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "these equations specifically describe the evolution of scalar fluctuations .",
    "it is well known that the inclusion of metric perturbations about the spatially flat friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) background metric produces a combination of modes that conveniently split into scalar , vector , and tensor components , depending on how they transform on spatial hypersurfaces . but vector perturbations have no lasting influence in an expanding universe .",
    "in addition , scalar and tensor modes decouple to linear order , so gravity waves do not provide any backreaction to the metric ; they satisfy sourceless equations when the energy - momentum tensor is diagonal , as is usually assumed for a perfect fluid in cosmology . for these reasons ,",
    "we focus exclusively on the evolution of scalar perturbations in this paper .",
    "let us first briefly discuss the motivation for considering this model .",
    "we have been developing this friedmann - robertson - walker cosmology for over ten years now ( melia 2007 , 2016a , 2017 ; melia & shevchuk 2012 ) , driven largely by a series of observational tests that suggest its predicted expansion rate is a better fit to the data than that of the current concordance model , @xmath2cdm . in this sub - section ,",
    "we survey some of these completed model comparisons , and explain why it is now necessary to probe this cosmology more deeply , including its predicted growth rate  the subject of this paper .",
    ".model comparisons between @xmath1 and @xmath2cdm [ cols= \" < , < , < \" , ]",
    "the linear growth equation in @xmath2cdm , which may also be derived from the formalism in   2 , is well known and we simply adopt the key results from previous work ( e.g. , linder 2005 ) .",
    "it is often written in the form @xmath96 where , as usual , dot indicates a derivative with respect to cosmic time .",
    "the hubble constant @xmath97 is defined in equation  ( 54 ) and , in the case of @xmath2cdm , @xmath98 is assumed to be a cosmological constant ( for which the dark - energy pressure is @xmath99 ) . in addition , for flat @xmath2cdm ( the fiducial model used here ) , @xmath100 .",

    "the current status of this work points to some tension between the predictions of @xmath2cdm and the measured linear growth rate at low and high redshifts .",
    "the primary cmb anisotropies place limits on the matter fluctuation amplitude at the time of recombination that may be extrapolated to the nearby universe .",

    "given these limitations , and fully acknowledging this important caveat , we will for now directly compare the growth rate in @xmath1 measured locally with that implied by the version of @xmath2cdm optimized to fit both the low- and high - redshift data .",
    "it is quite evident that the quality of the fit is not the only indication that @xmath1 may be preferred by these data .",
    "even a simple inspection by eye would suggest that these measurements , at least as shown in figure  2 , point to an absence of significant curvature in the measured functional dependence of @xmath0 on redshift .",

    "worse , all 5 of the remaining points in the standard model lie below the best - fit curve , while a purely randomized distribution should have been evenly dispersed above and below it . at the moment , this asymmetry in the @xmath2cdm residuals is an even more compelling argument in favour of @xmath117 than a simple comparison of their @xmath111 values .",
    "unfortunately , one can not be more definitive than this because , in spite of the evident superiority of @xmath1 over @xmath2cdm based on their residuals ( and , to some degree , on the quality of the fits ) , the growth rate measurements are not yet accurate enough for us to clearly distinguish a model whose best - fit curve has significant curvature ( fig .",

    "in recent years , perturbation theory has matured to the point where the predictions of @xmath2cdm have been compared extensively to measurements of the growth rate @xmath0 , and to other models .",
    "the current consensus is that planck @xmath2cdm ( planck collaboration 2014a ) is generally well matched to the data , and that no firm evidence exists for extensions to general relativity ( alam et al . 2016 ) .",

    "the principal goal of this paper has been to ascertain whether or not the predictions of the @xmath1 universe are also consistent with the measured growth rate at redshifts @xmath22 .",
    "we have found that the current measurements , though still not sufficiently precise to clearly distinguish between @xmath1 and @xmath2cdm , nonetheless favour the former over the version of the latter optimized by the joint analysis of _ planck _ and linear growth rate data .",

    "<S> we use recently published redshift space distortion measurements of the cosmological growth rate , @xmath0 , to examine whether the linear evolution of perturbations in the @xmath1 cosmology is consistent with the observed development of large scale structure . </S>",
    "<S> we find that these observations favour @xmath1 over the version of @xmath2cdm optimized with the joint analysis of _ planck _ and linear growth rate data , particularly in the redshift range @xmath3 , where a significant curvature in the functional form of @xmath0 predicted by the standard model  but not by @xmath4@xmath5@xmath6is absent in the data . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath2cdm is optimized using solely the growth rate measurements , however , the two models fit the observations equally well though , in this case , the low - redshift measurements find a lower value for the fluctuation amplitude than is expected in </S>",
