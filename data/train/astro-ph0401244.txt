    "recent studies have pointed out that gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) may be considered as standard cosmological candles .",
    "the prompt @xmath4-ray energies of grbs , after correction for the conical geometry of the jet , result clustered around a mean value of a few 10@xmath5 erg @xcite .    since the discovery that grbs lie at cosmological distances , about 30 redshifts have been measured .",
    "apart from the controversial case of grb 980425 , possibly associated with the nearby supernova sn1998bw ( at @xmath6 ) , all other redshifts are spread within the wide 0.17@xmath74.5 range .",
    "therefore grbs could be good candles to probe cosmological parameters @xcite @xcite .",
    "grbs are thought to be associated with the death of massive ( and short lived ) stellar progenitors .",
    "therefore the rate of grb events per unit cosmological volume should be a tracer of the global history of star formation .",
    "hence , we have now all the information necessary to perform simulations of grb distributions in a given cosmological model .",
    "universal parameters such as the matter density fraction @xmath8 and the cosmological constant energy fraction @xmath1 , can be constrained by fitting the hubble diagrams corresponding to such simulated distributions .",
    "it is the aim of this paper to simulate different grb distributions and investigate their ability to determine the cosmological parameters @xmath8 and @xmath1 .",
    "both universes with and without a cosmological constant @xmath9 will be considered .",
    "first , in order to show what we are aiming at , we performed a kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) test on two data sets made of 300 grbs simulated in two different cosmological models , one with @xmath10 and @xmath11 and the other with @xmath12 and @xmath13 , but both with a hubble constant @xmath14 km s@xmath15 mpc@xmath15 ( as it will be assumed throughout the paper ) .",
    "we assume that grbs are indeed standard candles with true prompt @xmath4-ray energy released , @xmath16 , following a gaussian distribution in its logarithm with mean @xmath17 ( if @xmath16 is expressed in @xmath18 units ) and @xmath19 ( corresponding to a multiplicative factor of 2 ) @xcite , and that they are distributed in the universe according to the model of star formation rate @xmath20 reported in @xcite , which matches the @xmath21 relation ( grb number counts vs. peak photon flux ) obtained with batse data . applying the ks test on the redshift distributions",
    ", we found that the probability that the two data sets are drawn from the same distributions is @xmath22 , a `` no man s land '' value for this test . on the other hand , the application of the ks test on the parameter @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the luminosity distance , resulted in a significant probability @xmath25 , which tells us that it is possible to discriminate between the two different cosmological models if a set of 300 grb luminosity distances is known ( see figure [ ks ] ) .",
    "calculated for two data sets of 300 grbs simulated in an universe with @xmath10 and @xmath11 ( full line ) and in one with @xmath12 and @xmath13 ( dashed line ) .",
    "the corresponding probability that the two data sets are drawn from the same distribution is @xmath26 . ]",
    "we consider now a @xmath27 cosmology , in which the only contribution to the density parameter is given by @xmath8 .",
    "we assume for grbs the same energy distribution as for the ks test .",
    "however , the assumed mean value is not relevant for our investigation , since it is the dispersion value that constrains the cosmological density parameter .    the standard candle energy is related to the fluence of the burst @xmath28 via the luminosity distance @xmath24 . in order to have a linear propagation of errors throughout our simulations , we choose to construct with grbs a hubble diagram @xmath29 , since the distribution of the parameter @xmath30 is the same of that of @xmath31 , and therefore it is gaussian .    in order to study the ability of grbs in probing the cosmological parameters as a function of their number",
    ", we have simulated different samples with @xmath32 = 10 , 30 , 100 , 300 and 1000 .",
    "moreover , in order to be free from statistical fluctuations , we have performed 10@xmath33 realizations of each of these samples .",
    "the simulation of a grb consists of the random sampling of both the redshift @xmath34 and the true @xmath4-ray energy released @xmath16 , according to the respective adopted distributions .",
    "given a cosmological model , from these coupled values we obtain the corresponding value for the parameter @xmath30 , which we plot on the hubble diagram as a function of @xmath34 .",
    "at this point we perform a @xmath35 minimization of the simulated data to see with which accuracy the fit reproduces the input cosmology . the measurement error on @xmath30",
    "is assumed to be @xmath36 .",
    "the mean results of our repeated fits in an einstein - de sitter universe ( @xmath10 ) are reported in the left side of table  [ tablam ] .",
    "we move now to a @xmath9-dominated cosmology , in which the contributions to the density parameter are given by the mass density , @xmath8 , and by the cosmological constant energy density , @xmath37 . in light of the recent observations of the cosmic microwave background",

    "finally , we must remark that the analysis in @xcite assumes of course a particular set of cosmological parameters to derive the standard @xmath4-ray energy of grbs . to avoid a circular logic",
