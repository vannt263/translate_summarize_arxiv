    "the @xmath4 alloys are very useful in the future because they can potentially outperform gaas in electron transport properties and their room temperature band gaps are particularly well suited for applications in infrared emitting diodes and detectors@xcite .",
    "thus , it is highly desirable to have a better understanding of the electronic properties of these alloys .",
    "kim and coworkers@xcite reported the dielectric functions of selected compositions of different concentration @xmath1 , including the endpoints values @xmath5 and @xmath6 , which can be used as the database to analyze those with arbitrary concentration @xmath1 . on the other hand , people can use many theoretical methods , like bethe - salpeter equation ( bse)@xcite and time - dependent local density approximation ( tdlda)@xcite , to calculate optical spectra for semiconductors and achieved good agreement with the experiment .",
    "these approaches focus on the response of the interacting system to a weak external perturbation and treat the exchange - correlation potential @xmath7 by local density approximation ( lda)@xcite .",
    "the difficulty , which has been known since the early 1980s , is that the basic local - density approximation and its semilocal extensions severely underestimate the band gap .",
    "a scissor operator @xmath8 must be used to correct the band gap for its application in solids . here",
    "the energy shift @xmath9 is some constant which can be obtained either semiempirically@xcite or by gw computation @xcite , and @xmath10 is the projection operator applied on conduction bands only .",
    "unfortunately , it s impossible to use the scissor operator in alloy since it is a composition of two or more semiconductors and one ca nt determine which band gap should be corrected .",
    "it prevents those theoretical methods to be applied to alloys .",
    "the recent emerged meta - generalized gradient approximation(mgga ) @xcite can fix the notorious underestimated band gaps caused by lda@xcite .",
    "it expands the exchange - correlation potential in terms of not only the density , but also the gradient of the density @xmath11 , the kinetic energy density @xmath12 and(or ) @xmath13 .",
    "tran and blahas(tb09 ) mgga @xcite shows great improvement in band gaps which can be in perfect agreement with experimental results .",
    "the mgga can be used to generate kohn - sham(ks ) wave functions and eigenenergies with good band gaps for gaas , inas and their alloys .",
    "the idea of using time - dependent density functional theory ( tddft)@xcite with adiabatic mgga to compute optical spectrum was adopted by nazarov etc.@xcite .",
    "they have implemented this approach into the full potential linearized augmented plane - wave ( fplapw)@xcite scheme to calculate optical spectrum for bulk si and ge with good success .",
    "however , fplapw needs a big number of plane waves as the basis which makes it not easy to be applicable to systems with large number of atoms . in this paper",
    "we will implement this approach into the full potential linear augmented - slater - type orbits ( lasto)@xcite scheme with adiabatic mgga to compute optical spectra for alloys .",
    "lasto uses less number of basis than fplapw , which we believe makes it more competitive to be applied to big systems than the latter .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we briefly review the tddft concepts and formulas on which our calculation is based . in sec .",
    "iii we describe how to model the basic alloy structures needed in our calculation .",
    "iv apply the tddft approach to compute the optical absorption spectra for the family of ternary alloy @xmath0 .",
    "the results are compared to and gotten good agreement with experimental data .",
    "finally , a short summary and outlook is presented to conclude the paper in sec .",
    "let s assume a weak perturbation to the alloy , then study the response of it to the perturbation .",
    "theoretically , the excitonic information is contained in the complex dielectric function @xmath14 via the response function @xmath15 given by @xmath16 here the response function @xmath15 can be built from the frequency - dependent , dynamical exchange - correlation(xc ) kernel @xmath17 and the noninteracting ks response function @xmath18 by the equation@xcite @xmath19 where @xmath17 is defined as @xmath20}{\\delta n(\\mathbf{r'},\\omega)}\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath21 $ ] is the time - dependent xc potential which is a functional of the particle density @xmath22 .",
    "the xc kernel @xmath23 can be approximated by @xcite , @xmath24 in the reciprocal space , which has the singularity of the type @xmath2 as @xmath3@xcite that the traditional approximations do nt provide . here",
    "@xmath25 is a reciprocal vector .",
    "therefore , this xc kernel @xmath23 is much better .",
    "the fourier transform of the noninteracting ks response function @xmath26 can be expressed in terms of the ks orbitals and eigenenergies as    @xmath27    where @xmath28 is the occupation number for the kohn - sham state @xmath29 with quantum number @xmath30 and spin @xmath31 at wave vector @xmath32(limited in brillouin zone ) .",
    "note that the ks response function adapted in eq .",
    "is the static one , i.e. , it does nt depend on time or frequency .    [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     one has to pay particular attention to the calculation of the matrix elements @xmath33 under mgga .",
    "if the reciprocal vector @xmath25 is nonzero , it can be evaluated directly . if @xmath34 , @xmath35 according to @xmath36 perturbation theory .",
    "the velocity operator is given as @xmath37 $ ] .",
    "under mgga , the potential is nonlocal , thus @xmath38 $ ] , so one ca nt use the momentum operator to replace the velocity operator .",
    "since @xmath39 $ ] is hard to evaluate , we approximate the transition matrix elements on the right hand side of eq .   by @xmath40 as was discussed by rohlfing and louie@xcite .",
    "one can approximate the transition matrix elements @xmath41 by the lda p - matrix elements directly .",
    "to calculate the dielectric functions for a ternary alloy @xmath42 with concentration(x ) of the constituent elements , we adopt the cluster - averaging method to simulate alloy systems .",
    "firstly , five basic structures , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 and the @xmath47-@xmath47 alloy , have to be modeled and calculated at the corresponding lattice constant which obeys vegard s law@xcite given by @xmath48 their contributions are incorporated into the alloy of interest with occurrence probabilities @xmath49 @xmath50 where @xmath51 .",
    "we assume these probabilities are random and can be calculated by the equation @xmath52 the binary end points compounds @xmath43 and @xmath44 are modeled by zinc blende structure with td symmetry .",
    "the remaining thing is to model a @xmath47-@xmath47 alloy and two minority clusters @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "it is not trivial because atoms are randomly distributed over the sample in alloys and we want to take advantage of a periodic unit cell .",
    "we follow the procedure described in ref.@xcite .",
    "the @xmath47-@xmath47 alloy is modeled by the primitive tetragonal structure with space group no .",
    "115 in the international tables for crystallography or point group @xmath53 .",
    "it contains 4 atoms per unit cell with the primitive vectors @xmath54 where the @xmath55 is the face - centered cubic lattice constant .",
    "two minority clusters @xmath45 and @xmath46 require a larger unit cell to model them , and we use the primitive cubic structure with space group no . 215 or point group @xmath56 , which contains 8 atoms unit cell with the primitive vectors @xmath57    in principle , we can use three distinct unit cells for five clusters , the typical zincblende unit cell for @xmath43 and @xmath44 , the primitive tetragonal structure for @xmath47-@xmath47 alloy , and the primitive cubic structure for @xmath58-@xmath59 and @xmath59-@xmath58 alloys . in order to cancel systematic errors",
    ", we use the largest unit cell among them , the one specified by eq .  , for the latter three alloys .",
    "their constituent atoms are allowed to relax until they reach equilibrium positions . in general",
    ", all atoms can move independently , but we restrict their movements in a way preserving the symmetry of the atoms in their unrelaxed ( ideal ) positions in the crystal .",
    "note that we do nt use the largest unit cell for @xmath43 and @xmath44 since we found the results of both the supercell and the bulk are the same .",
    "the self - consistent ks band structures of @xmath60 , @xmath61 @xmath62 @xmath63 and @xmath64 were computed with tb09@xcite mgga and lasto basis scheme . for the @xmath47-@xmath47 alloy @xmath62 , for @xmath58-@xmath59 alloy @xmath61 and @xmath59-@xmath58 alloy @xmath63 ,",
    "their lattice constants are 11.06586 bohr , 10.87443 bohr , 11.25710 bohr .",
    "the unit cell for all three alloys are supercell with basis vectors given by eq .  .",
    "since lasto uses point group to do the calculation , we used d2d symmetry for the @xmath47-@xmath47 alloy @xmath62 , and td symmetry for the primitive cubic structure for @xmath58-@xmath59 alloy @xmath61 and @xmath59-@xmath58 alloy @xmath63 .",
    "the coordinates of relaxed atoms of the alloys are listed in table [ alloyatoms ] .",
    "based on the band structures , we calculated optical spectra for five basic structures , using tddft with the transition matrix elements approximated by the lda p - matrix elements , as described by eq .  , via mgga .",
    "we used a 8x8x8 k - mesh for supercells and 10x10x10 k - mesh for bulk structures , generated by monkhorst - pack @xcite method with shift @xmath65 , to do the brilloin zone integration .",
    "the cutoffs of the reciprocal vectors were set to 2.3 for bulk structures and 2.0 for supercells .",
    "the average value of the derivative of the xc energy with respect to the kinetic energy density in eq .   were computed by voorhis and scuseria s xc functional@xcite .",
    "their spectra are presented in fig.[spectra ] .",
    "0.42     0.42     then we adopted the cluster averaging method to calculate the optical spectra of alloy @xmath0 with arbitrary concentration @xmath1 and fit them to experimental data .",
    "the real and imaginary parts of spectra are presented in fig.[spectra ] .",
    "it is obvious that tddft with the transition matrix elements approximated by the lda p - matrix elements via mgga , as described by eq .  , greatly improves the agreement between the theoretical and experimental data .",
    "since lasto uses less number of basis functions than other schemes , this makes tddft+mgga within lasto is fast and efficient enough to handle large supercells , up to 100 atoms .",
    "thus it can be applied to novel material and those with big number of atoms , like buckyball , quantum dots and solar cell . on the other hand ,",
    "lasto basis allows us to extract interaction parameters within tight - bingding model , which can be combined with tddft to treat realistic nanoparticles semi - empirically .",
    "we used the tddft theory with the transition matrix elements approximated by the lda p - matrix elements via mgga and the cluster averaging method to compute the spectra of @xmath0 with arbitrary concentration @xmath1 and compared them to experimental results .",
    "it turns out the great success of this method .",
    "this method is simple and time saving .",
    "the main reason is that mgga provides approximately correct band structures for alloys so that the expensive gw correction or inapplicable rigid scissor operator is no longer needed in our calculation .",
    "we believe this method can be applied in more materials , especially some with special structures , like superlattice , in the future .",
