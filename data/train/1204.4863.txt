    "vortices in type - ii superconductors have attracted much attention .",
    "since superconductivity is destroyed at the vortex center , the vortex core can be regarded as a potential well surrounded by the superconducting gap ( sg ) .",
    "therefore , quasi - particle states in the vortex core provide us with useful information of the sg . in this respect",
    ", it is particularly interesting to study vortices in iron - based superconductors  @xcite .",
    "characteristic features of iron - based superconductors , namely high transition temperature , multi - band nature ,  @xcite small carrier density and possible sign - reversal in the sg ,  @xcite should bring about unusual quasi - particle states in and around the vortex core . here",
    "we investigate vortices of an iron - based superconductor using scanning tunneling microscopy / spectroscopy ( stm / sts ) .",
    "in general , the excitation spectrum in the vortex core consists of discrete bound states separated by @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the sg and @xmath2 is the fermi energy .",
    "@xcite in conventional superconductors , @xmath2 is many orders of magnitude larger than @xmath1 and the excitation spectrum can be regarded as continuous .",
    "depending on the quasi - particle lifetime @xmath3 associated with impurity scattering , the vortex core can be classified into either dirty or clean regimes .",
    "if the lifetime broadening @xmath4 is greater than @xmath1 ( equivalent to @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the coherence length and @xmath7 is the mean - free path ) , quasi - particles are frequently scattered in the core and the core is well approximated as a normal metal .",
    "the influence of sg on the core states is masked in this dirty case .",
    "on the other hand , if @xmath8 or @xmath9 , quasi - particles can travel from one side of the vortex core to the other without being scattered .",
    "the most prominent feature of such a clean vortex core is that local density - of - states ( ldos ) at the vortex center exhibits a peak at @xmath2 because low - energy bound states are localized near the center .",
    "this ldos peak was first observed by hess _",
    "_ in nbse@xmath10  @xcite and subsequent theoretical analysis revealed that the energy and spatial evolution of the ldos peak reflect the nature of sg as well as normal - state band structure  @xcite .",
    "if the ratio @xmath11 , which roughly corresponds to the number of bound states , becomes small , energy separation between the bound states is large and the excitation spectrum is no longer continuous , provided @xmath12 .",
    "unfortunately , this so - called quantum - limit regime may not be reachable in conventional phonon - mediated superconductors .",
    "however , in iron - based superconductors , because of small carrier density ( which leads small @xmath2 ) and high transition temperature ( which means large @xmath1 ) , the quantum - limit regime may be anticipated .",
    "theoretical analysis of the quantum - limit vortex predicts strong particle - hole asymmetry in an ldos spectrum at the vortex center and a friedel - like oscillation in the spatial variation of ldos .",
    "@xcite    so far , vortices are successfully observed by stm / sts in some iron - based supercondcutors .",
    "@xcite the ldos peak associated with the bound states has been detected in the tunneling spectra at the vortex centers of fese and ba@xmath13k@xmath14fe@xmath10as@xmath10 .",
    "@xcite in the latter compound , possible quantum - limit behavior is discussed based on the asymmetry of the spectrum .",
    "@xcite however , detailed electronic structure of the vortex core and effects of multi band are still elusive .",
    "in addition to the quasi - particle states in the vortex core , properties of many vortices , vortex matter , have provided a fertile area of research . in general , vortices tend to form a triangular lattice ( abrikosov lattice ) due to the repulsive interaction between them .",
    "however , the abrikosov lattice may qualitatively be altered by quenched disorders and/or thermal agitation .",
    "@xcite the competition among associated energy scales , namely , elastic energy of the abrikosov lattice , pinning energies of quenched disorders and thermal energy , brings about various vortex phases : hexatic abrikosov - like phase ( elastic energy dominant ) , vortex glass or amorphous vortices ( pinning energy dominant ) and vortex liquid ( thermal energy dominant ) . the effect of thermal agitation and consequent vortex - lattice melting transition has extensively been studied in cuprate high - temperature superconductors . however , competition between elastic and pinning energies is still to be clarified .",
    "the stability of the abrikosov lattice is determined by its shear modulus @xmath15 which is roughly given by @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the upper critical field and @xmath18 is the magnetic field @xmath19 normalized by @xmath17 .",
    "@xcite at low and high @xmath18 where @xmath15 is small , the abrikosov lattice should be destroyed by the quenched disorders and the amorphous vortex matter may emerge .",
    "the vortex lattice partially retains its order in the intermediate @xmath18 range but should contain dislocations .",
    "@xcite numerical simulation of the vortex configuration shows that vortices with unusual coordination numbers of 5 and 7 are aligned alternately , forming domain boundaries .",
    "@xcite a crossover to the high - field amorphous phase occurs through roughening of the boundaries .    in this article ,",
    "we report results of comprehensive stm / sts experiments on vortices in an iron - based superconductor lifeas .",
    "lifeas is one of the very few stoichiometric iron - based superconductors and thus clean single crystals are available .",
    "in addition to this , cleaved surfaces studied by stm / sts are electronically neutral , which is highly advantageous to minimize the surface - related extrinsic effects .",
    "tunneling spectrum exhibits clear two - gap features indicating that the sg amplitude is different depending on the fermi - surface cylinder .",
    "in contrast to other vortex - imaging techniques such as bitter decoration , stm / sts can image vortices even at high magnetic field where @xmath19 is almost uniform . by taking this advantage , we study the structure of vortex matter over wide @xmath19 range and find a signature of high - field crossover to the amorphous phase .",
    "we also examined the electronic state of the vortex cores .",
    "tunneling spectra at the vortex center are strongly particle - hole asymmetric with a sharp ldos peak just below @xmath2 .",
    "we compare the spectra and their spatial evolution with those expected in the quantum - limit vortex core and show that the ldos features associated with the larger sg are consistent with the quantum - limit behavior , but those for the smaller sg including the sharp peak just below @xmath2 are not compatible with the quantum - limit vortex - core state .",
    "we also found that vortex radius shrinks with decreasing temperature .",
    "this is a direct evidence of so - called kramer - pesch effect  @xcite associated with the low - energy bound states in the vortex core .",
    "lifeas single crystals were grown by a lias self - flux technique .",
    "@xcite a resistivity @xmath20 ratio @xmath21 of as high as 45 and no detectable residual specific heat coefficient are observed .",
    "these data demonstrate the high quality of the crystals .",
    "superconducting transition temperature @xmath22 defined at zero - resistance is about 18  k. since lifeas degrades in an ambient atmosphere , all of the sample handling procedures were carried out inside of glove boxes filled with purified ar or n@xmath10 gases .",
    "all stm / sts experiments were performed in a constant - current mode using a commercial ultra - high - vacuum low - temperature stm system modified by ourselves ( unisoku usm-1300 with nanonis controller ) .",
    "@xcite tunneling conductance , which is proportional to the ldos at given bias voltage , was measured by standard lock - in technique using the built - in software lock - in detector of nanonis controller .",
    "clean and flat surfaces perpendicular to the [ 001 ] axis were prepared by _ in situ _ cleaving at liquid n@xmath10 temperature . immediately after the cleaving , samples were transferred to the stm unit which was precooled below 10  k. electrochemically etched w wires , which were cleaned , sharpened and characterized by a field - ion microscope , were used for scanning tips .",
    "magnetic fields were applied along the [ 001 ] axis .",
    "whenever magnetic field was changed , the sample was heated up above @xmath22 in advance and then it was field - cooled to the measurement temperatures in order to ensure the homogeneous field distribution inside the sample .",
    "we show a typical stm topography in fig .",
    "although various types of natural defects exist , most of the cleaved surface is clean and flat enough to image a regular square atomic lattice as shown in the inset .",
    "the lattice constant is determined to be 0.39  nm , indicating that the imaged atomic site is either the as site or li site .",
    "figure  1(b ) represents the tunneling spectrum measured in the clean region .",
    "the spectrum is skewed v - shaped bottomed at @xmath2 with a bump at about 40  mev .",
    "we confirmed that the spectrum does not exhibit obvious spatial variations except in the vicinity of defects .",
    "results of spectroscopic studies near defects will be published everywhere .    at low energy , sg structure is clearly identified .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "1(c ) , spectral weight over a finite energy range near @xmath2 is completely removed at low temperatures .",
    "this is a direct evidence that the sg is finite everywhere on the fermi surface .",
    "two pairs of peaks can be clearly identified , implying that the sg consists of at least two components . by defining the sg amplitude @xmath23 using the peak - to - peak separation , the sg ratio @xmath24 ( @xmath25 denotes boltzmann constant ) for the smaller sg ( @xmath26  mev )",
    "is estimated to be 3.7 , which is close to the value expected from the weak - coupling bardeen - cooper - schrieffer theory .",
    "the sg ratio for the larger sg ( @xmath27  mev ) takes a very large value of 7.7 . in both sgs ,",
    "the rising edges at lower energy have finite width which is wider than our energy resolution ( @xmath28  mev ) .",
    "this result is consistent with the anisotropic sg suggested by recent angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) experiments  @xcite and quasi - particle interference effect .",
    "@xcite    the observed sg amplitudes are quantitatively consistent with the arpes data .",
    "@xcite we identify that the smaller sg opens on the outer - most hole cylinder and the larger sg is associated with the inner hole cylinders . a contribution from the electron cylinders , where arpes observed @xmath29  mev ,",
    "@xcite is not clear in the tunneling spectrum .",
    "possible reason for this apparent absence may be that the gap - edge peak for the electron cylinders overlaps with those for the hole cylinders , or electron cylinders are `` masked '' by the tunneling matrix element .    at elevated temperatures ,",
    "both gaps are smeared out and disappear at about bulk @xmath22 of 18  k , indicating that they faithfully represent bulk superconductivity .",
    "since superconductivity is destroyed at the vortex center , ldos below the sg energy should be enhanced around the vortices .",
    "therefore , vortices can be imaged by spectroscopic imaging technique in which tunneling conductance is measured at every pixel of stm image .",
    "figures 2(a)-(c ) are conductance maps at @xmath2 at representative @xmath19 s , showing vortices as bright spots .",
    "we repeated the same experiment over wide @xmath19 range from 0.1  t to 11  t. as shown in fig .",
    "3(a ) , @xmath19 dependence of vortex density perfectly follows the trend expected in the case that single vortex carries the single flux quantum of 2.07@xmath30  wb .        interestingly , vortices do not form into the ordered triangular lattice .",
    "two - dimensional auto - correlation ( figs .",
    "2(g)-(i ) ) and fourier - transform ( figs .",
    "2(j)-(l ) ) images are characterized by @xmath19-dependent ring - like structures around the origin . at 0.5  t",
    ", weak 6-fold spots are identified along the ring in the auto - correlation image ( fig .",
    "2(g ) ) , indicating that hexatic correlation is developing . at higher @xmath19 ,",
    "the ring - like structures are isotropic in magnitude but the rings in the fourier - transform images are deformed into rectangular shape elongated along the as - as direction .",
    "the emergence of 4-fold anisotropy suggests that the symmetry of underlying crystal lattice and/or anisotropy of the sg affect the configuration of vortices but they are not strong enough to arrange vortices into regular square lattice which was observed in yni@xmath10b@xmath10c , for example .",
    "nevertheless , the observed ring - like structures indicate that there is a well - developed distance correlation between vortices but the orientational correlation is almost absent .",
    "such a highly disordered vortex matter in lifeas is in sharp contrast to the vortices in ba@xmath13k@xmath14fe@xmath10as@xmath10 where well - ordered triangular vortex lattice has been observed .",
    "@xcite the difference between these two materials can be ascribed to the difference in the shear modulus @xmath15 associated with the difference in @xmath17 .",
    "@xcite in lifeas , @xmath17 along the [ 001 ] axis is about 15  t ,  @xcite while that of ( ba , k)fe@xmath10as@xmath10 is estimated to be more than 60  t.  @xcite this difference gives rise to an order - of - magnitude smaller @xmath15 in lifeas than that in ( ba , k)fe@xmath10as@xmath10 .",
    "therefore , vortex lattice in lifeas is much more susceptible to quenched disorders than that in ( ba , k)fe@xmath10as@xmath10 . in other words",
    ", lifeas can be a playground to investigate how the structure of vortex matter subject to quenched disorder changes as a function of @xmath19 .    in order to analyze the local structure of vortex matter , we performed delaunay triangulation analysis as summarized in figs .",

    "even if there is a defect , its coordination number should be 5 or 7 , which is close to the regular value of 6 .",
    "such defect vortices are aligned alternately forming a domain boundary .",
    "this situation does not change so much as long as the elastic energy is relevant . at high enough @xmath19 , however , @xmath15 diminishes . as a result , the domain boundary becomes rough and the vortex matter approaches to the uniformly disordered amorphous phase which contains vortices with extraordinary coordination numbers less than 5 and more than 7 .",
    "these behaviors are totally consistent with the result of numerical simulation .",
    "@xcite      we now focus on spectroscopic features of a single vortex .",

    "@xcite in the case of lifeas , the effect of vortex lattice can be safely excluded because vortices at 0.5  t form into a distorted hexatic lattice ( fig .",

    ", arpes observed the smallest sg in the outer - most hole cylinder and the sg exhibits 4-fold anisotropy .",
    "@xcite the sg is smaller along the fe - fe direction than along the as - as direction , which would give rise to the vortex - core shape with the ldos tails along the fe - fe direction .",
    "this is in contradiction to the observed ldos distribution at @xmath2 shown in fig .",
    "4(a ) , indicating that the sg anisotropy does not play a major role .",

    "@xcite this anisotropy should result in a larger number of quasi - particles traveling along the as - as direction , forming high ldos tails around a vortex .",

    "the particle - hole asymmetric spatial evolution of the ldos peak , especially the step - like change in its energy in the filled state , may be due to the friedel - like oscillation .",
    "@xcite namely , it is possible that the observed asymmetric quasi - particle states associated with the larger sg reflect the quantum nature of the vortex electronic states in lifeas .",

    "tunneling spectrum at the vortex center is strongly particle - hole asymmetric , being reminiscent of the behavior expected in the quantum - limit vortex core where the discrete bound states inside the core are smeared out neither by impurity scattering nor thermal broadening . the quasi - particle branch associated with the larger superconducting gap exhibit step - like energy change as approaching to the vortex center",
    "this is consistent with the friedel - like oscillation expected in the quantum - limit vortex .",
    "@xcite however , quasi - particle states associated with the smaller superconducting gap are not compatible with the quantum - limit behavior , although energy - gap like feature is observed even at the vortex center .",
    "observation of kramer - pesch effect , strong @xmath46 dependence in the vortex - core size , also suggests that energy - separation between the discrete bound states associated with the smaller gap is not large enough to bring about detectable energy gap at the vortex center . the mechanism which opens the energy gap at the vortex center is an interesting open question .",
    "nevertheless , we anticipate that observed rich spectroscopic features exposed in the vortex core of lifeas serve as a touchstone of various theoretical models for the superconducting state in iron - based materials .",
