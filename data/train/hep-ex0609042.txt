    "exclusive processes with hadronic final states in two - photon collision are an excellent probe to test various model calculations motivated by perturbative and non - perturbative qcd . as shown by brodsky and lepage ( bl ) @xcite , at sufficiently large two - photon center - of - mass energy @xmath11 and momentum transfer from the initial photon to the produced meson @xmath12 , the leading term of the amplitude for the process @xmath13 , where @xmath14 denotes a meson , can be expressed as a hard scattering amplitude for @xmath15 times the leading term meson electromagnetic form factor . for mesons with zero helicity",
    "their calculation gives the following dependence on @xmath16 and scattering angle @xmath17 : @xmath18 ^ 2}{(1-\\cos^2\\theta^*)^2}+   \\frac{2(e_1e_2)[(e_1-e_2)^2]}{1-\\cos^2\\theta^*}g(\\theta^*)+ 2(e_1e_2)^2g^2(\\theta^*)\\big\\ } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the quark charges ( i.e. , mesons have charges @xmath21 ) , and explicit forms of the leading term meson form factor @xmath22 @xmath23 and the function @xmath24 can be found in refs .",
    "( [ eq : bl1 ] ) implies that the angular distribution of neutral meson pairs , unlike that for charged meson pairs which is dominated by @xmath25 terms , is directly determined by the shape of @xmath24 and the value of @xmath22 .",
    "later , benayoun and chernyak ( bc ) @xcite used a factorization hypothesis similar to the bl calculation but further improved the treatment of the effects of su(3 ) symmetry breaking ; their predictions appeared to be in good agreement with the subsequent measurements of @xmath26 and @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "recently , diehl , kroll and vogt ( dkv ) @xcite considered the consequences of the assumption that at intermediate energies the amplitudes for the process @xmath13 are dominated by so - called handbag contributions .",
    "the handbag amplitude is expressed as the product of an amplitude for the hard @xmath27 subprocess times an unknown form factor @xmath28 describing the soft transition from the @xmath29 to the meson pair . in  @xcite the differential cross section",
    "is given by @xmath30 where the meson annihilation form factor @xmath28 is not calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite but is instead obtained by fitting the data ; the magnitude of @xmath28 for different mesons can be linked by using su(3 ) and isospin symmetry . the validity of this approach has recently been criticized in ref .",

    "earlier , the belle collaboration performed a high - statistics measurement of the cross sections for the processes @xmath31 and @xmath32  @xcite in the @xmath33(=@xmath11 ) range 2.4 gev  @xmath34  4.1 gev .",
    "analysis of the data showed that in this @xmath33 range the @xmath33 dependence of the cross section is consistent with that predicted by the leading term qcd calculations  @xcite .",
    "here we report a measurement of the cross section for @xmath35 at @xmath36 and @xmath37 with a data sample of 397.6  fb@xmath1 collected at or near the @xmath38 resonance , accumulated with the belle detector @xcite at the kekb asymmetric - energy @xmath2 collider  @xcite .",
    "this measurement can provide important information that complements previous studies and sheds light on how the two - photon mass and angular distributions of such cross sections depend on the flavor of the produced mesons .",
    "the belle detector is a large - solid - angle magnetic spectrometer .",
    "momenta of charged tracks are measured with a central drift chamber ( cdc ) , located in a uniform 1.5 t magnetic field which surrounds the interaction point ( ip ) and subtends the polar angle range @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is a scattering angle in the laboratory frame .",
    "the trajectories of the charged tracks near the interaction point are provided by the cdc and the silicon vertex detector ( svd ) .",
    "energy measurement of electromagnetically interacting particles is performed in an electromagnetic calorimeter ( ecl ) made up of csi(tl ) crystals .",
    "the detector is described in detail elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "exclusive @xmath41 pairs are produced in quasi - real two - photon collisions through the process @xmath42 , where the scattered @xmath43 and @xmath44 are lost down the beampipe , and only the two @xmath45 mesons are detected .",
    "we select @xmath35 candidate events in two stages . at stage",
    "i the following requirements are applied :    * exactly four charged tracks with zero net charge of which at least two have @xmath46 gev/@xmath47 , @xmath48 cm , @xmath49 cm , where @xmath50 is the transverse momentum in the laboratory frame and @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the radial and axial coordinates of the point of closest approach of the track to the nominal ip , respectively , and the @xmath53-axis is the direction opposite to the positron beam axis ; * the sum of the magnitudes of the momenta of all tracks , @xmath54 , and the total energy deposit in the ecl are less than 6  @xmath55 and 6  @xmath3 , respectively ; * the invariant mass of these four tracks is less than 4.5  @xmath56 , and the missing mass squared of the event is greater than 2  @xmath57 ;    at stage ii pairs of oppositely charged tracks without particle identification are used to reconstruct @xmath58 decays . to distinguish @xmath35 events from other four - track background sources such as @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 that have no @xmath45 candidates , two different sets of selections",

    "the mismatch in the @xmath53 direction at the @xmath45 vertex point for the @xmath63 tracks must be less than 2.4 ( 1.8 ) cm ; the direction of the pion - pair momentum must also agree with the direction from the ip to the vertex to within 0.03 ( 0.1 ) rad . to evaluate the background and calculate efficiencies , we use a monte carlo simulation ( mc ) of the detector response based on geant3 @xcite .",

    "thus the four - track backgrounds can be eliminated efficiently after our event selection .",
    "the resolution in the reconstructed @xmath45 mass is 4 mev / c@xmath65 , and only candidates for which @xmath66 mev / c@xmath65 are selected .",
