    "one of the outstanding results in oriented matroid theory is the topological representation theorem , introduced by folkman and lawrence  @xcite ( see @xcite for simplified proofs ) , which says that there is a one - to - one correspondence between oriented matroids and equivalence classes of _ pseudosphere arrangements_. this theorem bridges topology and combinatorics , and shows that oriented matroids constitute a natural combinatorial model .    motivated by oriented matroid theory , it is natural to consider whether a useful theory can be developed by abstracting combinatorial aspects of other related objects .",

    "in fact , we show that the combinatorial properties observed by eli and matouek represent in some sense almost _ all _ of the combinatorial properties that can be proved using some natural geometric properties . to do so , we first observe a slightly stronger combinatorial property of partitions than those observed by eli and matouek , and then we introduce a combinatorial model called _ degree-@xmath0 oriented matroids _ by axiomatizing the observed combinatorial properties .",
