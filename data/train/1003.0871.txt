    "random boolean networks ( rbns ) are a class of complex systems , that show a well - studied transition between ordered and disordered phases .",
    "the rbn model was initially introduced as an idealization of genetic regulatory networks . since then",
    ", the rbn model has attracted much interest in a wide variety of fields , ranging from cell differentiation and evolution to social and physical spin systems ( for a review of the rbn model see @xcite and @xcite , and the references within ) .",
    "the dynamics of rbns can be classified as ordered , disordered , or critical , as a function of the average connectivity @xmath0 , between the elements of the network , and the bias @xmath2 in the choice of boolean functions . for equiprobable boolean functions , @xmath3 ,",
    "the critical connectivity is @xmath1 .",
    "the rbns operating in the ordered regime @xmath4 exhibit simple dynamics , and are intrinsically robust under structural and transient perturbations .",
    "in contrast , the rbns in the disordered regime @xmath5 are extremely sensitive to small perturbations , which rapidly propagate throughout the entire system .",
    "recently , it has been shown that the pairwise mutual information exhibits a jump discontinuity at the critical value @xmath6 of the rbn model @xcite .",
    "more recently , similar results have been reported for a related class of discrete dynamical networks , called random threshold networks ( rtns ) @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we consider a non - linear random networks ( nlrns ) model , which represents a departure from the discrete valued state representation , corresponding to the rbn and rtn models , to a continuous valued state representation .",
    "we discuss the complex dynamics of the nlrn model , as a function of the average connectivity ( in - degree ) @xmath0 .",
    "we show that the nlrn model exhibits an order - chaos phase transition , for the same critical connectivity value @xmath1 , as the rbn and rtn models . also , we show that both , pairwise correlation and complexity measures are maximized in dynamically critical networks .",
    "these results are in very good agreement with the previously reported studies on the rbn and rtn models , and show once again that critical networks provide an optimal coordination of diverse behavior .",
    "the nlrn model consists of @xmath7 randomly interconnected variables , with continuously valued states @xmath8 , @xmath9 . at time @xmath10 the state of the network is described by an @xmath7 dimensional vector@xmath11^{t},\\ ] ] which is updated at time @xmath12 using the following map:@xmath13 where@xmath14^{t},\\ ] ] and    @xmath15    here , @xmath16 is an @xmath17 interaction matrix , with the following randomly assigned elements : @xmath18 and @xmath0 is the average in - degree of the network .",
    "the interaction weights can be interpreted as excitatory , if @xmath19 , and respectively inhibitory , if @xmath20 . also , we have @xmath21 , if @xmath22 is not an input to @xmath23 .",
    "obviously , the threshold @xmath24 can be considered as a constant input , with a fixed weight @xmath25 , to each variable @xmath23 .",
    "therefore , in the following discussion we do not lose generality by assuming that the threshold parameter is always set to @xmath26 .",
    "in order to illustrate the complex dynamics of the nlrn system , we consider the results of the simulation of three networks , each containing @xmath27 variables , and having different average in - degrees : @xmath28 , @xmath29 and respectively @xmath30 .",
    "also , the continuous values of the variables @xmath31 are encoded in shades of gray , with black and white corresponding to the extreme values @xmath32 . in figure 1 , one can easily see the three qualitatively different types of behavior : ordered @xmath33 , critical @xmath34 , and respectively chaotic @xmath35 .    a quantitative characterization of the transition from the ordered phase to the chaotic phase is given by the lyapunov exponents @xcite , which measure the rate of separation of infinitesimally close trajectories of a dynamical system .",
    "the linearized dynamics in tangent space is given by:@xmath36 where @xmath37 is the jacobian of the map @xmath38 , with the elements@xmath39,\\ ] ] and @xmath40 is the separation vector .",
    "the dynamics of @xmath40 is typically very complex , involving rotation and stretching .",
    "therefore , the rate of separation can be different for different orientations of initial separation vector , such that one obtains a whole spectrum of lyapunov exponents . in general",
    ", there are @xmath7 possible values , which can be ordered : @xmath41 .",
    "these lyapunov exponents are associated with the lyapunov vectors , @xmath42 , which form a basis in the tangent space .",
    "a perturbation along @xmath43 will grow exponentially with a rate @xmath44 .",
    "oseledec s theorem @xcite proves that the following limit exists:@xmath45 we should note that , oseledec s limit will always correspond to @xmath46 , because an initial random perturbation will always have a component along the most unstable direction , @xmath47 , and because the exponential growth rate the effect of the other exponents will be obliterated over time .",
    "thus , in general , it is enough to consider only the maximal lyapunov exponent ( mle ) , which is enough to characterize the behavior of the dynamical system @xcite .",
    "a negative mle corresponds to an ordered system ( fixed points and periodic dynamics ) , while a positive mle is an indication that the system is chaotic .",
    "a zero mle is associated with quasiperiodic dynamics and corresponds to the critical transition .",
    "figure 2 shows the mle as a function of the average in - degree , @xmath48 .",
    "one can see that the critical in - degree is @xmath1 , such that for @xmath49 the nlrns are ordered , and for @xmath50 the nlrs become chaotic .",
    "the numerical results were obtained by averaging over the nlrns ensemble for each @xmath0 , using @xmath51 nlrns with @xmath52 elements .",
    "also , for each time series we have discarded the first @xmath53 steps , in order to eliminate the transient , and the mle was calculated from the next @xmath53 steps .    in order to provide a more detailed characterization of the order - chaos phase transition",
    "we introduce the following spectral complexity measure : @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the spectral entropy , and @xmath56 is the spectral disequilibrium .",
    "the complexity is defined by the interplay of two antagonistic behaviors : the increase of entropy as the system becomes more and more disordered and the decrease in the disequilibrium as the system approaches chaos ( equiprobability ) .",
    "a similar complexity measure , evaluated in the direct ( time ) space , was introduced in @xcite , for discrete state systems .",
    "in contrast , our complexity measure is defined for continuous state systems , and it is evaluated in the inverse ( frequency ) space .    in order to define the spectral entropy @xcite , we consider the discrete fourier transform ( dft ) : @xmath57=[x_{n}(1), ... ,x_{n}(\\omega)]^{t},\\ ] ] @xmath58 and the power spectrum : @xmath59^{t},\\ ] ] @xmath60 of the time series : @xmath61^{t},\\ ] ] corresponding to the attractor of the variable @xmath62 of a given nlrn . here",
    ", @xmath63 stands for the complex conjugate value . since the variables @xmath31 are real , the dft result has the following symmetry:@xmath64 and therefore the power spectrum @xmath65 has only @xmath66 positive values :    one can normalize the power spectrum such that:@xmath67 and@xmath68 the new variable @xmath69 can be interpreted as the probability of having the frequency @xmath70 _ embedded _ in the time series @xmath71 .",
    "thus , using the spectral probability vector @xmath72^{t},\\ ] ] one can define the spectral entropy of the time series @xmath71 , as following:@xmath73=-\\frac{1}{\\log_{2}\\omega}\\sum_{\\omega=1}^{\\omega}p_{n}(\\omega)\\log_{2}p_{n}(\\omega),\\ ] ] where @xmath74 is the normalization constant , such that @xmath75 .",
    "obviously , the spectral entropy of the ordered systems will be low , @xmath76 , since only a very small number of frequencies are present , while the spectral entropy of chaotic systems will be high , @xmath77 , since a large number of frequencies are present .",
    "the spectral entropy takes the maximum value , @xmath78 , for the equilibrium state , which is defined deep in the chaotic regime , where all frequencies become equiprobable : @xmath79 , @xmath80 .",
    "the spectral disequilibrium of the time series @xmath71 , measures the displacement of the corresponding probability vector @xmath81 from the equilibrium state , and it is defined as following:@xmath82=\\sum_{\\omega=1}^{\\omega}[p_{n}(\\omega)-\\omega^{-1}]^{2}.\\ ] ] a special attention is necessary in the case when the attractor is zero : @xmath83 . in this particular case ,",
    "the power spectrum is also zero , @xmath84 , and the probability vector @xmath81 is undetermined . in order to overcome this difficulty",
    ", we define @xmath85 and @xmath86 for this particular attractor , such that it has the lowest entropy and the largest displacement from equilibrium .",
    "since the spectral disequilibrium measures the distance between two distributions , one may consider also the spectral kullback - leibler divergence @xcite as an alternative .",
    "however , for the considered nlrn model , the kullback - leibler divergence is simply given by : @xmath87=\\frac{1}{\\log_{2}\\omega}\\sum_{\\omega=1}^{\\omega}p_{n}(\\omega)\\log_{2}\\left(\\frac{p_{n}(\\omega)}{\\omega^{-1}}\\right)=1-h_{\\omega}[\\mathbf{p}_{n}(\\omega)].\\ ] ] similarly , one can show that the symmetrical kullback - leibler divergence is given by:@xmath87+d_{\\omega}^{kl}[\\omega^{-1}||\\mathbf{p}_{n}(\\omega)]=-h_{\\omega}[\\mathbf{p}_{n}(\\omega)]-\\frac{1}{\\omega\\log_{2}\\omega}\\sum_{\\omega=1}^{\\omega}\\log_{2}p_{n}(\\omega).\\ ] ] therefore , in this case , the kullback - leibler divergence ( or its symmetrical version ) can be expressed in terms of entropy .",
    "thus , the spectral disequilibrium seems to be a more appropriate distance measure , since it can not be expressed in terms of entropy .",
    "another quantity of interest is the pairwise spectral correlation between the power spectrum of two network variables @xmath62 and @xmath88 , which is defined as:@xmath89=\\frac{(\\mathbf{y}_{n}-\\mathbf{\\overline{y}}_{n})^{t}\\mathbf{(y}_{m}-\\mathbf{\\overline{\\mathbf{y}}_{m}})}{\\left\\vert \\mathbf{y}_{n}-\\mathbf{\\overline{y}}_{n}\\right\\vert \\left\\vert \\mathbf{y}_{m}-\\overline{\\mathbf{y}}_{m}\\right\\vert } , \\ ] ] where @xmath90 and @xmath91 represents the mean values .",
    "the average correlation for a given nlrn is : @xmath92c_{\\omega}[\\mathbf{y}_{n},\\mathbf{y}_{m}],\\ ] ] where we have excluded the self - correlation terms ( @xmath93 if @xmath94 and @xmath95 if @xmath96 ) .    in figure 3",
    "we give the numerical results for the above spectral measures ( entropy , disequilibrium , complexity and correlation ) , obtained by averaging over the nlrns ensemble ( @xmath51 networks with @xmath52 elements and @xmath97 ) .",
    "one can see that both the complexity and the correlation measures are maximized by the critical nlrns with @xmath1 .    as mentioned at the beginning of the paper , the continuous nlrn model",
    "is directly related to the binary rtn model , which has been extensively studied recently @xcite , @xcite .",
    "recently , we have investigated the binary rtn model , using similar quantities , complexity , entropy , and the mutual information , which are well defined in the time domain .",
    "the obtained results for both nlrn and rtn models are in very good agreement , showing a phase transition for the same critical connectivity @xmath1 .",
    "also , for the rtn model , we have shown that the mutual information , which is the binary counter part of the spectral correlation , is maximized for @xmath1 .",
    "similar results have also been previously reported for the rbn model @xcite .",
    "we have shown numerically that the nlrn model exhibits an order - chaos phase transition , for the same critical connectivity value @xmath1 , as the rbn and rtn models .",
    "also , we have shown that both the pairwise correlation and the complexity measures are maximized in dynamically critical networks .",
    "these results are in very good agreement with the previously reported studies on the rbn and rtn models , and show once again that critical networks provide an optimal coordination of diverse behavior .",
    "we would like also to note that these optimal properties of critical networks are likely to play a major role in biological systems , perhaps serving as important selective traits .",
    "given the potential biological implications , it is of interest that recent data suggest that genetic regulatory networks in eukaryotic cells are dynamically critical @xcite . also , recent experiments conducted on rat brain slices show that these neural tissues are critical @xcite .",
    "thus , it seems plausible that in cells , neural systems , and other tissues , natural selection will have acted to maximize both the correlation across the network , and the diversity of complex behaviors that can be coordinated within a causal network .",
    "ordered networks have convergent trajectories , and hence forget their past .",
    "chaotic networks show sensitivity to initial conditions , and thus they too forget their past , and are unable to act reliably . on the other hand , critical networks , with trajectories that on average neither diverge or converge ( quasiperiodic dynamics ) , seem best able to bind past to future , and therefore to maximize the correlated complex behavior .",
