    "an isolated classical system always has a fixed value of the total energy .",
    "in contrast , an isolated quantum system can be in a superposition of states with different total energies  @xcite .",
    "this entails the following difficulty for the foundations of statistical physics : a typical isolated macroscopic quantum system is generally expected to thermalise under the action of its internal dynamics for the overwhelming majority of initial nonequilibrium states appearing in nature or created in a laboratory  .",
    "thermalisation implies that the density matrix of any small subsystem within the large system approaches a form consistent with the canonical gibbs density matrix ( canonical ensemble ) for the large system . a necessary condition for an isolated many - particle quantum system to thermalise is a sufficiently narrow initial probability distribution of its total energy , as is , for example , the case for the canonical and the microcanonical statistical ensembles ( see below ) . at the same time , for an isolated quantum system , the probability of occupying an energy eigenstate remains unchanged with time .",
    "thus , a large isolated quantum system with a broad initial distribution of the total energy thermalises not to a conventional equilibrium state with a well - defined temperature but rather to a mixture or superposition of states with different temperatures .",
    "the problem now is that the initial states characterised by the narrow distribution of total energy are _ not _ necessarily the most probable ones .",
    "for example , non - gibbs equilibrium for small subsystems emerges when initial states are selected in the hilbert space of a typical many - particle system among quantum superpositions with a given energy expectation value and without any constraint on the width of the energy window for participating eigenstates  .",
    "the latter condition defines the `` quantum micro - canonical '' ( qmc ) ensemble  @xcite .",
    "given the above considerations , why do the initial nonequilibrium quantum states of macroscopic systems not normally exhibit the broad participation of energy eigenstates and hence non - gibbs statistics for small subsystems ?",
    "in this paper , we address the above question by introducing the criterion of stability of quantum statistical ensembles with respect to local measurements and then apply this criterion to lattices of spins 1/2 .",
    "similar ideas in other contexts have been considered in refs .",

    "let us now observe that accidental measurements of microscopic particles in a macroscopic system can not be excluded under any foreseeable natural or experimental conditions .",
    "we , therefore , introduce the following stability criterion : _ a physically realisable quantum statistical ensemble describing a stationary state of a macroscopic system must be stable with respect to a small number of any arbitrarily chosen local measurements within the system .",
    "the measurement is called `` local '' if the measured quantity is localised in the three - dimensional physical space  .",
    "the number of measurements @xmath12 is called small if @xmath13 .",
    "the ensemble is called stable if _",
    "@xmath14 _ where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the probability distributions before and after the measurements , respectively . _    the measurements in question",
    "are implied to occur naturally , for example , when a passing photon becomes entangled with the system and accidentally measured later . without the measurement ,",
    "the above process would describe a decoherence event  @xcite .    in the following , we simplify the analysis by assuming random instantaneous projective measurements of individual particles in the system  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we mainly focus on `` strong instability '' , which we define as the case when fewer than 10 measurements lead to @xmath17 independent of @xmath18 .",
    "qualitatively , measurements can lead to both narrowing and broadening of @xmath4 .",
    "the broadening effect of a single measurement is due to the off - diagonal elements of the projection operator describing the measurement in the basis of the total - energy eigenstates .",
    "the narrowing effect originates from correlations between the total energy of the system and the measurement outcomes .",
    "indeed , broad probability distributions @xmath4 can be considered as a mixture of microcanonical ( or canonical ) ensembles corresponding to different temperatures @xmath19 , which , in turn , imply different probability distributions of local variables .",
    "when a given measurement outcome is more likely for one represented temperature than for another , the post - measurement distribution will be narrower than the initial one  @xcite . in terms of the energy scales , the increase of the variance @xmath6 due to the off - diagonal elements of a local projection operator should normally be of the order of @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is an appropriately chosen single - particle energy .",
    "the reason is that the quantum projections corresponding to the local measurements are one - particle or a few particle operators . at the same time",
    ", the decrease of @xmath6 for broad @xmath4 can easily be of the order @xmath22 , i.e. , much larger .",
    "since we focus primarily on broad @xmath4 , we neglect the broadening effect of the measurements unless explicitly specified otherwise .",
    "we further limit our derivations to @xmath4 satisfying inequality @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the width of the energy distribution corresponding to the canonical ensemble with the same average energy as that of @xmath4 .      for an ensemble with narrow energy distribution @xmath4 , such as the canonical ensemble",
    ", the above - mentioned broadening effect also leads to heating , defined as the drift of the average energy @xmath7 in the direction of larger entropy @xmath25 ( larger value of @xmath26 $ ] ) .",
    "this means that @xmath7 increases for positive temperatures and decreases for negative ones .",
    "such a behaviour is consistent with the second law of thermodynamics , because local measurements of individual particles can be viewed as small nonadiabatic perturbations of the system . for positive temperatures @xmath9 ,",
    "the increase of @xmath7 due to one measurement is of the order of the one - particle energy @xmath21 .",
    "a broad ensemble can be considered as a mixture of canonical ensembles with different temperatures .",
    "the heating for each of the contributing canonical ensembles occurs as explained above .",
    "therefore , the overall heating effect for a broad ensemble corresponds to the combination of the heating effects for the individual canonical ensembles . in a system with a finite hilbert space ,",
    "the asymptotic shape of @xmath4 corresponds to the canonical ensemble at infinite temperature , which is , in turn , proportional to the density of states @xmath2 of the system .",
    "our definition of @xmath4 implies averaging over energy bins whose width @xmath27 satisfies the following inequalities : @xmath28 in the case of negative temperatures , @xmath29 should be used instead .    the left inequality in eq .",
    "together with the restriction @xmath30 and the inequality   allows us to neglect heating described in the preceding part . the right inequality in eq .",
    "assures that the energy eigenstates within each bin approximately correspond to the same density matrices of small subsystems within the entire system considered",

    "now we consider a lattice of @xmath18 spins-1/2 and examine how multiple random local measurements affect @xmath4 .",
