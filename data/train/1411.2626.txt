    "understanding galaxy evolution in the high - redshift universe is one of the major goals in contemporary astronomy . to reveal the mechanism(s ) of this evolution , it is crucial to study the galactic spectra reflecting their physical state , e.g. , star formation rate ( sfr ) , stellar mass , metallicity , dust contents , and their spatial distributions . in this work ,",

    "note that , however , the uv background can locally be strong at near star - forming galaxies and has impact on galaxy evolution ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "low - mass galaxies are expected to be sensitive to stellar feedback , especially in the early universe , because of their shallow potential well , making it easier for the gas to be pushed out . in an associated work ,",
    "we analyze various prescriptions for feedback and compare the results with observations @xcite .",

    "we present their uv luminosity functions , redshift evolution , and the effect of galactic morphology on the spectral properties of high-@xmath2 galaxies .",
    "the most massive galaxy in the cr run exhibits a resilient morphology of a gas - rich disk galaxy with a stellar bar and outer spiral arms , over a substantial period of time , @xmath44 , as shown in figure  [ fig:2dgas ] for @xmath17 and discussed in @xcite .",

    "the amount of dust is @xmath47 , and the mean gas metallicity has reached @xmath48 .",
    "this dust is concentrated around the galactic center , while the stellar distribution is more extended and exhibits also a spheroidal component .    in comparison ,",
    "the most massive galaxy in the ucr run is more compact and spheroidal .",
    "the half - mass radius of the gaseous ( stellar ) distribution in the most massive ucr galaxy at @xmath49 is about 375pc ( 255pc ) .",
    "most of the baryons are enclosed within the central kpc , and its sfr is @xmath50 , which is a factor of @xmath51 lower than that of the most massive object in the cr run .",
    "more detailed analysis of the galactic morphology will be shown elsewhere .",
    "the evolution of sfr , gas metallicity and dust mass as a function of the galaxy stellar mass are shown in figure  [ fig : sfr ] .",
    "for each redshift , the sfr increases nearly linearly with the stellar mass and its slope @xmath15 in the log - log plot ranges within @xmath52 , which is consistent with the previous works ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the slopes for all the samples are summarized in table  [ table : fit ] .",
    "such slopes imply a weak dependence of the specific sfr ( @xmath53 ) on @xmath9 , where ssfr@xmath54 .",
    "this trend is also supported by observations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ". as @xmath55 , the ssfr slightly increases with @xmath9  contrary to what has been found for lower redshifts @xcite .",
    "we find also that the ssfr decreases somewhat with redshift , as can be seen in the second panels ( from the top ) of figure  [ fig : sfr ] .",
    "this trend and values are consistent with recent simulations @xcite and observations @xcite .",
    "such a trend seems to reflect dependence of the ssfr on the gas fraction in galaxies which decreases with redshift for the low - mass galaxies .",
    "some of the lower - mass galaxies are affected more by the stellar feedback , while the higher - mass galaxies retain much of their gas , keeping their high sfrs .",
    "this causes a substantially higher dispersion in the sfr for galaxies with @xmath56 .    ) , and galactic dust mass ( @xmath57 ) , as a function of the galaxy stellar mass ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "the different symbols represent the different redshifts , @xmath58 and 12 . ]",
    "we do not observe any clear difference in the sfr ",
    "@xmath59 relationship between the cr and ucr runs , except the presence of much higher galaxy masses in the former .",
    "the sfr of most galaxies in the cr and ucr runs is fueled by the cold gas accretion rather than by major mergers , as shown by @xcite .",
    "obviously , the upper cutoff of the sfr lies much lower for the ucr run because of the absence of massive galaxies in the normal region at @xmath33 .",
    "this cutoff is increasing with time , e.g. , it is @xmath60 at @xmath13 and @xmath61 at @xmath49 , for the cr run .",
    "one expects that galaxy evolution process is greatly accelerated in the overdense regions , which is supported by the evolution of the cr galaxies .",
    "the third panels ( from the top ) of figure  [ fig : sfr ] show that the gas metallicity @xmath62 has a large dispersion , because the gas in low - mass galaxies is easily blown away by the sn feedback . in these objects ,",
    "the metallicity can quickly rise to log(@xmath63 once the stars form , and it will lead to a large dispersion , reflecting the variation in the sfrs . on the other hand ,",
    "massive galaxies show a tighter correlation owing to the steady gas supply from the igm filaments and minor mergers  the width of quartiles to median values at each mass bin decreases with increasing mass .",
    "metallicity of some massive galaxies in the cr run reaches a nearly solar abundance at @xmath49 . already at @xmath13 , the most massive galaxy exhibits",
    "log(@xmath64 due to early sf .",
    "there is little difference in the value and the spread between the cr and ucr runs .",
    "most of the difference again becomes visible for @xmath65 .",
    "the observed lbgs at @xmath66 show metallicities ranging from @xmath67 to @xmath68 ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "our cr results exhibit similar median metallicities , with only a few outliers having near - solar abundances .",
    "however , the halos of the massive galaxies in cr have already reached the mass range of @xmath69 by @xmath33 , which is similar to that of the observed lbgs at @xmath70 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "galaxies in overdense region evolve ahead of the normal regions .",
    "therefore , these massive galaxies can be substantially enriched by metals during this rapid galaxy growth .",
    "in addition , there is little information about the metallicity of galaxies at @xmath71 due to difficulties in detecting the metal lines . @xcite",
    "have noted a very low metallicity of lbgs at @xmath28 from the extreme blue colors of their uv spectra , while in the recently observed large sample , the uv slope of lbgs at @xmath71 appears similar to that of galaxies at @xmath72 @xcite .",
    "hence , the metallicity of galaxies at @xmath20 is still subject to debate .",
    "the bottom two panels of figure  [ fig : sfr ] show that the galactic dust mass , @xmath57 , is tightly correlated with the stellar mass , because @xmath73 of the stellar mass ends up as type - ii sne , and the amount of dust is fixed @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "some fraction of dust is consumed by the sf process or is blown out of galaxies by the sne feedback .",
    "again , this increases dispersion in @xmath57 . at @xmath49 , the dust mass in the most massive ( cr ) galaxy",
    "has reached @xmath74 .",
    "the ssfr and the dust mass in our massive ( cr ) galaxies are similar to those observed in smgs at @xmath75 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "they appear only slightly smaller than in the bright smg at @xmath5 discovered by @xcite , which has @xmath76 , @xmath77 , and @xmath78 .",
    "the most massive galaxy in our simulations has similar stellar and dust masses , but its sfr is smaller by a factor less than 4 . given the uncertainties in modeling the sf process , this is a very reasonable correspondence .      , at @xmath79 in the rest - frame of the galaxy .",

    "the error - bars provide 1-@xmath80 standard deviations for different viewing angles . here , 50 angular bins have been used , 5 in @xmath81 and 10 in @xmath82 . ]     and @xmath83 . _ lower : _ optical depth of the dust calculated from the dm halo radius identified by the hop group - finder algorithm , to a specific radius , using density distributions of the upper and middle panels . ]    .",

    "the upper panels show the uv band ( @xmath84 in the rest frame ) , which corresponds to the @xmath85 band in the observed frame .",
    "the lower panels display the ir band ( @xmath86 ) , which corresponds to the sub - millimetre band of @xmath87 .",
    "the colours indicate the surface brightness in the log scale in units of @xmath88 . ]",
    "the uv continuum photons are overwhelmingly emitted by young stars ( in the absence of the agn ) .",
    "some of them are absorbed by the dust before escaping from galaxies .",
    "therefore , the galaxy uv properties are determined by their physical properties shown in figure  [ fig : sfr ] .",
    "the calculated escape fraction , @xmath10 , of the uv photons in the @xmath89 band for the cr and ucr galaxies is displayed in the figure  [ fig : fesc ] .",
    "we find that most of the uv photons in galaxies with @xmath90 have been absorbed by dust already at high redshifts , @xmath91 .",
    "their photon escape fraction is @xmath92 at this redshift and decreases further with the stellar mass .",
    "this mass dependence is consistent with the previous works ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the values at @xmath93 are similar to the published ones ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "figure  [ fig : fesc ] shows that @xmath10 is increasing towards smaller redshifts for galaxies with @xmath94 , while for higher - mass objects this increase is marginal . as a result ,",
    "the median slope steepens with time .",
    "dashed lines fit the median values with the mass bin of @xmath95 dex using the fitting function , @xmath96 , where @xmath15 and @xmath97 are the fitting parameters .",
    "the slope @xmath15 ranges from @xmath98 to @xmath99 .",
    "the benchmark value of @xmath100 moves to the right and is located at @xmath101 by @xmath33 .",
    "the parameter @xmath97 evolves from @xmath102 at @xmath103 to @xmath104 at @xmath17 . for galaxies with @xmath105 , the @xmath10 increases from 0.03 to 0.06 during @xmath106 , while for @xmath107 galaxies it rises by a factor of 3 .",
    "hence galaxies become more transparent at lower @xmath2 in our simulations , and low - mass galaxies show a more pronounced trend in this direction .",
    "the @xmath10 in our simulations is smaller than that of @xcite .",
    "these authors have assumed that dust is distributed in a screen with a radius of @xmath108 where @xmath109 is the halo virial radius , taking the mean density of the sphere to be 200 times the critical density at a particular redshift . on the other hand , in our simulations",
    ", the gas distribution is clumpy , is found near the starforming regions , and , therefore , absorbs the stellar radiation more efficiently , resulting in lower @xmath10 .",
    "the observed lbgs indicate a very high escape fraction because of the blue colours in the uv bands ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in comparison",
    ", the @xmath10 of high - mass end galaxies in our simulations appears smaller .",
    "by @xmath49 , our most massive cr galaxies with @xmath110 have @xmath111 .",
    "note that the estimated higher @xmath10 in the observed lbgs result from the assumed smooth dust extinction curve of local starforming galaxies from @xcite .",
    "however , if one accounts for the bump at @xmath112 in the dust extinction curve , the blue colour could still be obtained , despite @xmath10 being small .",
    "massive cr galaxies are compact , and have large amount of dust due to the high sfr .",
    "the stellar distributions are centrally concentrated , and the galactic centers  the sites of the sf  appear to be enshrouded in dust .",
    "hence , the stellar radiation is efficiently absorbed .",
    "we note , that there is uncertainty in @xmath10 when using the uv colour alone , because the change in the uv colours by the dust extinction depends sensitively on the dust properties , e.g. , its size and composition .",
    "if the typical grain size is smaller than that in the milky way , and the main component is graphite , the dust extinction does not change the uv colour or make it bluer because of the bump at @xmath113  in the dust extinction curve @xcite .    the most significant difference in @xmath10 between the cr and ucr galaxies , less than a factor of 2 , can be seen in the lowest mass bin , @xmath114 , as we discuss in section 3.5 .",
    "the reason for this is that the gas distribution , and hence the distribution of sf regions and dust , in the cr galaxies are more compact than in the ucr ones . as shown in @xcite ,",
    "the galaxies in a particular mass range form earlier in overdense regions , compared to ` normal ' regions in the universe .",
    "this happens because the accretion rate depends on the background density in addition to the halo / galaxy mass .",
    "indeed , in our simulations , the low - mass galaxies in cr form earlier than the ucr ones , resulting in a more compact gas / star distribution and a more efficient dust extinction . at earlier times",
    ", the universe is denser and the parent dm halos have larger concentration parameter , causing compact gas distribution .",
    "the radial distribution of the gas , stars and dust in the cr run are shown in figure  [ fig : dist ] .",
    "we take the most massive galaxies at @xmath17 and @xmath83 , and estimate the mean density in spherical shells at each radius .",
    "most of them are distributed in the central kiloparsec .",
    "half - mass radii of the gas are 95pc at @xmath115 and 215pc at @xmath17 .",
    "due to the compact distributions , the optical depth at @xmath116 , estimated from the boundary of the grid placed around each galaxy to an arbitrary radius @xmath117 , i.e. , @xmath118 , increases steeply when approaching the galactic centre . at @xmath115 , the optical depth to @xmath119kpc is larger than unity , and this radius increases to @xmath120kpc at @xmath17 .",
    "the stellar distribution behaves similarly .",
    "for example , the mass @xmath121 is within the radius mentioned above , where the ism is optically thick at @xmath115 , but decreases somewhat to @xmath122 at @xmath17 .",
    "consequently , most of the stellar uv radiation is absorbed by the dust .",
    "note , that , despite lower dust mass at @xmath115 , the fraction of stellar mass inside the radius of @xmath123 is higher than that at @xmath17 , due to the compact dust and stellar distributions .",
    "therefore , even at high redshifts , stellar uv radiation of galaxies residing in the overdense regions can be absorbed by the dust .",
    "the gas and dust appear to be pushed away from the center at lower redshifts .",
    "the surface brightness of the most massive galaxies in the cr and ucr runs at @xmath17 is shown in @xmath85 and sub - millimetre bands ( figure  [ fig : sb ] ) .",
    "the @xmath85 band in the observed frame corresponds to the uv band in the rest frame .",
    "the @xmath85-band flux of the galaxy in the cr run exhibits a similar distribution to the stellar one ( figure  [ fig : dist ] ) , e.g. , 1-d radial distribution .",
    "however , some parts get fainter , because of the stronger dust absorption . on the other hand ,",
    "the sub - millimetre flux traces the dust distribution , and , therefore , is more compact compared to the @xmath85-band flux .",
    "the @xmath85 and sub - millimetre band fluxes of the galaxy in the ucr run show similar distributions reflecting stars and dust , respectively .",
    "however , the uv flux is flatter compared to the stellar distribution , and the sub - millimetre flux is more compact due to the effect of the radiative transfer , i.e. , uv flux near the galactic centers is efficiently absorbed , as shown in figure  [ fig : dist ] .",
    "the uv fluxes from galaxies at @xmath124 in the rest frame are shown in figure  [ fig : muv ] .",
    "the flux is the angular mean .",
    "dotted and dashed lines represent fitting lines to median values with the mass bin of 0.5dex , using the function @xmath125 . for the intrinsic @xmath126 , @xmath127 , which means that the uv flux increases linearly with the stellar mass , @xmath9 , since @xmath128 , where @xmath129 is the uv flux density .",
    "this happens because the uv flux is proportional to the sfr @xcite which correlates with the stellar mass , as shown in figure  [ fig : sfr ] . on the other hand , due to the mass dependence of @xmath10 ,",
    "the fitting lines to @xmath126 are flatter with @xmath130 , considering the dust extinction .",
    "hence , after correction by the dust extinction , @xmath131 .",
    "we find that , before the dust extinction has been applied , many cr galaxies appear above the detection threshold for recent observations of the hubble ultra - deep field ( hudf ) with the wide - field camera3 ( wfc3 ) onboard the hst @xcite .",
    "however , due to the strong dust extinction , the galaxies in the cr run become fainter by @xmath132 magnitudes . as a result",
    ", many of the galaxies appear below the detection threshold for the current hst observations . at @xmath13 , only a few bright galaxies appear above the threshold . in the ucr run ,",
    "the intrinsic uv fluxes of most galaxies are fainter than the detection threshold at @xmath133 . only a few galaxies at @xmath134 can be observable as lbgs .",
    "the error bars in figure  [ fig : muv ] show the dispersion in @xmath126 due to the viewing angle . because of the anisotropic stellar and dust distributions , the uv flux changes significantly . on average ,",
    "the dispersion increases with the stellar mass , because the galaxy shapes become more disky ( see   [ sec : view ] , and also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the photons escape efficiently along the normal direction to the disk plane .",
    "this can affect significantly the limiting cr galaxy mass , moving it by about a decade in @xmath9 , from @xmath135 to @xmath136 .",
    "for example , @xmath126 of the most massive galaxy at @xmath17 in the cr ranges from @xmath137 to @xmath138 .",
    "therefore , for many galaxies , the detection by the hst depends on the viewing angle .",
    "since the dust absorption cross section decreases with increasing wavelength , dispersion becomes smaller at longer wavelengths .",
    "this effect may cause variation of physical properties in observational study using the sed fitting .",
    "we shall discuss additional details in section  [ sec : discussion ] .",

    "stellar masses in the ucr galaxies lie within the range estimated by these observations . because the ucr run is using a small volume , we can not sample larger galaxies , because they are rare and difficult to find in such volumes ( see section2 ) .",
    "the stellar masses of our cr galaxies with @xmath141 exceed those of stark et al . by a factor of a few , while the dimmer ones fall within the observed range .",
    "we note that the cr galaxies reside in the highly overdense region which tends to evolve ahead of the average density regions in the universe .",
    "for example , their sf starts at higher redshifts than in the ucr galaxies . as a result",
    ", a larger fraction of the uv photons will be attenuated by larger amount of dust , and the stellar mass - to - emerging uv flux ratio becomes higher in comparison with the observed lbgs .",

    "this enables us to compare our simulation results to the observed lfs as shown in figure  [ fig : lf ] .",

    "we also demonstrate that the lf in the ucr run nicely agrees with the observed lfs at the fainter side . without the dust extinction ( not shown here ) , the lfs are shifted a few magnitudes brighter , and hence deviate from the observed ones .",
    "these shifts are related to @xmath10 through @xmath147 .",
    "therefore , @xmath139 of massive cr galaxies with @xmath148 becomes fainter by more than 2.5 magnitudes , while that of the low - mass ucr galaxies with @xmath149 shifts down by less than 1.3 magnitudes .",
    "this result is interesting and of a prime importance to observations of high - redshift galaxies , as it shows that the dust extinction is important in the @xmath20 galaxies .",
    "we note that due to a relatively small computational box for the ucr galaxies , it does not include massive bright galaxies with @xmath150 .",
    "hence , our results in the ucr run are limited at @xmath151 .    the reasonable agreement of the ucr lf with observations after the dust extinction correction also provides support to the cr run results , which has been performed with the same physical models , except for the environment of higher densities .",
    "we note that , if quasars indeed reside in such massive galaxies , their spatial distribution will reflect the distribution of our cr galaxies in the sky with the limited volume , accounting for quasar duty cycle somewhat smaller than unity .",
    "our results indicate that even galaxies at @xmath20 can suffer from the dust attenuation .",
    "on the other hand , recent observations have shown that the slope @xmath97 of the uv flux is @xmath152 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "if we consider the smooth dust extinction curve , such as the calzetti law @xcite , @xmath153 means that the dust attenuation is small @xcite . however , the sne dust model is associated with the extinction curve which exhibits a bump at 2175 , due to the small graphite dust .",
    "therefore , our sne dust model does not increase @xmath97 with the dust extinction , i.e. , the dust extinction @xmath154 is nearly independent of this parameter ( e.g. , figure  1 in * ? ? ?",
    "this is unlike the relation between the dust extinction and the slope @xmath97 in the local starforming galaxies @xcite .",
    "we confirm that even galaxies with a strong dust extinction keep @xmath155 , which is nearly the value of the intrinsic seds .",

    ", the slope of @xmath163 shows a shallower @xmath164 , because @xmath165 lies at the long - wavelength tail of the thermal peak of the dust emission .",
    "for example , the peak wavelength of ir radiation from the most massive galaxy is @xmath166 , while that of the observed smg shows @xmath167 .",
    "therefore , when the dust temperature increases with increasing @xmath157 , the peak intensity moves to smaller @xmath168 and becomes higher .",
    "hence the increase in the intensity around the peak is larger than in the tail . for a fixed covering area of dust emission",

    "the massive galaxies in cr run appear fainter than the observed smg at @xmath17 by factor @xmath171 @xcite , although the stellar and dust masses are similar .",
    "there are at least three options which can explain such a difference .",
    "first , the observed smg could be detected during an extreme starburst phase , while our model galaxies mostly evolved with smooth gas accretion @xcite .",
    "second , the cr galaxies could have a different dust covering factor of the central sf sites .",
    "alternatively , the modelled and observed galaxies can lie in different environments , which lead to different accretion rates , gas fractions , etc . note that the number of detected smgs at @xmath14 is still quite small . future surveys of high - redshift smgs using alma will allow for a better and statistically significant comparison .",
    "while we focus on the dust continuum emission in this work , we note that the metal lines , e.g. , c and o , and the co molecular lines enhance the detectability of high - redshift galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "<S> we use high - resolution zoom - in cosmological simulations of galaxies of romano - daz et al . , post - processing them with a panchromatic three - dimensional radiation transfer code to obtain the galaxy uv luminosity function ( lf ) at @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the galaxies are followed in a rare , heavily overdense region within a @xmath1 density peak , which can host high-@xmath2 quasars , and in an average density region , down to the stellar mass of @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the overdense regions evolve at a substantially accelerated pace  the most massive galaxy has grown to @xmath4 by @xmath5 , contains dust of @xmath6 , and is associated with a very high star formation rate , sfr@xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> the attained sfr@xmath8 correlation results in the _ specific _ sfr slowly increasing with @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> most of the uv radiation in massive galaxies is absorbed by the dust , its escape fraction @xmath10 is low , increasing slowly with time . </S>",
    "<S> galaxies in the average region have less dust , and agree with the observed uv lf . </S>",
    "<S> the lf of the overdense region is substantially higher , and contains much brighter galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the massive galaxies are bright in the infrared ( ir ) due to the dust thermal emission , with @xmath11 at @xmath5 , while @xmath12 for the low - mass galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , alma can probe massive galaxies in the overdense region up to @xmath13 with a reasonable integration time . </S>",
    "<S> the uv spectral properties of disky galaxies depend significantly upon the viewing angle . </S>",
    "<S> the stellar and dust masses of the most massive galaxy in the overdense region are comparable to those of the sub - millimetre galaxy ( smg ) found by riechers et al . at @xmath5 , while the modelled sfr and the sub - millimetre flux fall slightly below the observed one . statistical significance of these similarities and differences will only become clear with the upcoming alma observations .    </S>",
