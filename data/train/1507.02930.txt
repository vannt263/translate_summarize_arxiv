    "<S> _ introduction . </S>",
    "<S> _ the efficient generation of highly entangled states is among the biggest challenges in quantum technologies , as they allow approaching the ultimate quantum limits like the elusive heisenberg limit in metrology @xcite . within the last decade , </S>",
    "<S> technological development has enabled a number of schemes that reliably produce entangled many - particle quantum states , ranging from spin squeezed to dicke states for neutral atoms @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> + the lipkin - meshkov - glick hamiltonian , originally developed in nuclear physics @xcite , captures the dynamics of interacting particles in two modes . </S>",
    "<S> it allows the generation of a rich variety of spin squeezed @xcite and highly entangled non - gaussian states @xcite . in ultracold gases </S>",
    "<S> , this hamiltonian can be implemented using linear rabi coupling and atomic interactions between two internal states </S>",
    "<S> . with that system , entangled non - gaussian states have been created @xcite . in this work , </S>",
    "<S> we detail the dynamic generation of spin squeezed states . </S>",
    "<S> + the addition of linear coupling to the standard one - axis - twisting scheme @xcite leads to an exponentially increasing quantum uncertainty , implying a corresponding squeezing along the orthogonal axis on a fast time scale . </S>",
    "<S> this results from the interplay of the twist due to the interaction and the rotation ( turn ) caused by the linear coupling . </S>",
    "<S> semiclassically , this behavior can be understood as the dynamics of a classical phase space volume around an unstable fixed point . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding emergence of correlations has also been studied in a three - mode scenario @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> _ experimental system . _ in our experiment , the lipkin - meshkov - glick hamiltonian is realized by employing two internal states of a @xmath3rb bose - einstein condensate @xcite , the @xmath4 and @xmath5 hyperfine states of the electronic ground state . </S>",
    "<S> we simultaneously prepare up to 30 independent condensates , each containing @xmath6 atoms , in an optical standing wave potential @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the large trapping frequencies ensure that external dynamics is frozen out . additionally , the array of condensates yields many independent realizations and enables scalability to large atom numbers @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> + linear coupling between the two internal states is achieved using a two - photon microwave ( @xmath7ghz ) and radio frequency ( @xmath8mhz ) transition . </S>",
    "<S> the phase of the coupling can be nonadiabatically adjusted by switching the phase of the radio frequency radiation , which is created using an arbitrary waveform generator . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the coupling power can be altered by changing the amplitude of the radio frequency signal and attenuating the microwave by use of a fixed attenuator on an rf switch with two ports . </S>",
    "<S> the atomic nonlinearity is enhanced in the vicinity of an interspecies feshbach resonance between @xmath9 and @xmath10 at a magnetic bias field of 9.12 g . </S>",
    "<S> after each experimental cycle , state - dependent detection is implemented using absorption imaging after stern - gerlach separation of the two components @xcite ( see fig.[fig1]a ) . </S>",
    "<S> the imaging is performed at low magnetic fields ( @xmath11 g ) after a ramp - down of the bias field in 300ms . in order to inhibit spin - relaxation loss of the @xmath9 state during the ramp - down , we transfer its population to @xmath12 via a microwave @xmath13 pulse .    </S>",
    "<S> _ theoretical description . </S>",
    "<S> _ in a quantum mechanical description , the system of @xmath14 indistinguishable two - level bosons can be treated as a pseudospin ( @xmath15 ) and displayed on a generalized bloch sphere . using the respective creation and annihilation operators of the two modes , the @xmath16 component of the pseudospin @xmath17 </S>",
    "<S> is defined by the population difference between the two levels , which can be directly detected in the experiment . </S>",
    "<S> the orthogonal components ( coherences ) are given by @xmath18 and @xmath19 , fulfilling the angular momentum commutation relation @xmath20 = \\text{i } \\epsilon_{jkl}\\hat{j}_l$ ] . </S>",
    "<S> + in this pseudospin picture , our experimental system can be described by the hamiltonian @xmath21 which is a special case of the lipkin - meshkov - glick hamiltonian @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the quantum dynamics of this system is governed by the relative strength of the three parameters : the nonlinearity @xmath22 arising from the interparticle interaction , coupling strength @xmath23 given by the microwave and radio frequency radiation , and the detuning @xmath24 resulting from the mismatch of the coupling and the atomic frequency , the ac zeeman shift as well as the particle number dependent mean field shifts . </S>",
    "<S> + the resulting dynamics can be understood from the fact that angular momentum operators are the generators of rotations . </S>",
    "<S> thus , @xmath25 leads to a rotation around the @xmath16 direction whose angular velocity @xmath26 depends on the population difference @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> this can be interpreted as a twist ( fig.[fig1]b ) . </S>",
    "<S> the one - axis twisting scheme exploits this nonlinear twist exclusively . </S>",
    "<S> + the second and third term in the hamiltonian describe linear rotations around the @xmath28- and the @xmath16-axis , respectively . in the regime @xmath29 , the relative sign between linear coupling @xmath23 and nonlinearity @xmath22 </S>",
    "<S> can be chosen such that the linear rotation leads to a speed - up of the shear of the quantum state . </S>",
    "<S> this is achieved when the linear coupling transfers the enlarged spread in phase ( @xmath30 ) into an increased spread in particle number difference ( @xmath27 ) , which implies faster twisting .    </S>",
    "<S> _ classical phase space picture . </S>",
    "<S> _ further insight can be gained by analyzing the corresponding classical description , which is valid in the limit @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding classical hamiltonian is @xmath32 with the imbalance @xmath33 and the phase @xmath34 . in the case of sole twisting , the phase space portrait features two stable fixed points at the north and south pole of the generalized bloch sphere . </S>",
    "<S> exemplary classical trajectories are visualized by solid lines in fig.[fig1]b . </S>",
    "<S> the addition of linear coupling leads in the case of dominating interaction , i.e. @xmath35 , to two additional fixed points on the equator of the bloch sphere , one of which is stable and one unstable @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the tnt scenario exploits this unstable fixed point and is experimentally realized for @xmath36 and @xmath37 ( fig.[fig1]c ) . </S>",
    "<S> the instability leads to rapid spreading of the quantum state along the separatrix which divides the classical phase space into regions of macroscopically different temporal behavior . </S>",
    "<S> spin squeezing is generated during the early dynamics @xcite . at later times , the bending around the stable fixed points leads to the appearance of non - gaussianity , and squeezing vanishes @xcite . + </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , the quantum states created by the one - axis - twisting scheme @xcite remain gaussian on much longer timescales .    </S>",
    "<S> _ state preparation . </S>",
    "<S> _ in the experiment , after initial preparation of all atoms in @xmath10 , a coherent superposition between @xmath9 and @xmath10 is produced by applying a @xmath38 pulse of the linear two - photon coupling . subsequently , microwave and radio frequency are attenuated to reach the regime of @xmath39 and the phase of the rabi coupling is adjusted by @xmath40 , which changes the rotation axis from the @xmath41 to the negative @xmath28-axis . </S>",
    "<S> additional phase shifts due to the microwave attenuator are compensated by shifting the phase of the radio frequency accordingly , and the frequency is adjusted , taking into account the change in ac zeeman shift caused by the altered power of the coupling radiation . </S>",
    "<S> + the influence of technical detuning fluctuations , caused by variations of the magnetic bias field of @xmath42 g over several days , is reduced by applying a spin - echo pulse ( @xmath13 rotation around the @xmath28 direction ) at half the evolution time . </S>",
    "<S> this also reduces the sensitivity to coupling phase errors . by omitting the linear coupling during the evolution time , </S>",
    "<S> the same sequence is used for a direct comparison to the one - axis twisting scenario .    </S>",
    "<S> _ state analysis . </S>",
    "<S> _ to investigate the states generated by the twist - and - turn scheme , we perform a tomographic readout . </S>",
    "<S> this is achieved by rotating the state around the @xmath28-direction for various angles and analyzing the fluctuations of the particle number difference for repeated measurements ( fig.[fig2]a ) . </S>",
    "<S> the fluctuations are quantified by the number squeezing parameter @xmath43 , normalized to the binomial variance of the corresponding coherent spin state @xmath44 with @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> one representative experimental result is shown in fig.[fig2]b , from which we extract the maximal observed variance as well as the minimal fluctuations @xmath46 and the corresponding rotation angle @xmath47 .    </S>",
    "<S> _ experimental results . </S>",
    "<S> _ the generation of squeezing with the tnt scheme is quantified in fig.[fig3 ] by the resulting spin squeezing parameter @xmath48 , taking into account the reduced mean spin length @xmath49 due to the extension of the state along the long axis . </S>",
    "<S> we infer @xmath50 by applying a rotation with an angle @xmath51 and detecting the distribution of particle number differences . </S>",
    "<S> since the population imbalance after the rotation is @xmath52 , we can directly access the expectation value @xmath50@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> + we experimentally find strong initial spin squeezing , reaching a minimal value of @xmath53db after 15ms evolution time ( fig.[fig3]a ) . </S>",
    "<S> the precisely characterized photon shot noise of the absorption images ( standard deviation @xmath54atoms for each component ) has been subtracted for all given values . </S>",
    "<S> small fringe noise contributions remain @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our results confirm the generation of entanglement during the early evolution . </S>",
    "<S> + after this minimal value , squeezing is quickly lost . </S>",
    "<S> this does not imply the loss of entanglement , as spin squeezing only captures the variance properties of the state and thus does not fully characterize non - gaussian states . in this regime </S>",
    "<S> , entanglement can be shown by extraction of the fisher information @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> + the solid lines in fig.[fig3]a represent the results of a monte carlo wave function ( mcwf ) simulation discussed in detail in the appendix , and qualitatively agrees with the experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> this simulation includes particle losses and the resulting change of the parameters @xmath55 and @xmath56 which depend on the atomic density , as well as the technical detuning fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> the dashed line includes additional known sources of noise during the detection process , such as the residual losses due to background collisions during the ramp - down of the magnetic field , which corresponds to a loss of @xmath57 atoms . </S>",
    "<S> + we also compare this novel scheme with the well - established one - axis twisting scheme . </S>",
    "<S> while the corresponding experimentally obtained value of the best squeezing ( gray squares in fig.[fig3]a ) is comparable , the transition to non - gaussian states happens at much larger time scales , which are longer than the largest investigated evolution time . </S>",
    "<S> + the experimentally extracted angle of minimal fluctuations @xmath47 and the size of the long axis ( see fig.[fig3]b and c ) are much less susceptible to loss than the minimal squeezing , yielding very good agreement with our mcwf simulations . </S>",
    "<S> the underlying classical instability in the tnt scheme leads to an exponential growth of quantum mechanical uncertainty , which is directly observed by analyzing the increase of fluctuations of the long axis shown in fig.[fig3]c . </S>",
    "<S> this is in contrast to one - axis twisting , where the deviation from the initial exponential growth occurs much earlier @xcite , and confirms that the exponentially fast initial squeezing is prolonged in the tnt scheme .     and @xmath24 , the characteristics of final states after a fixed evolution time change with atom number . </S>",
    "<S> this is shown for an evolution time of @xmath58ms and three key parameters of the spin squeezed states : a ) the spin squeezing parameter @xmath59 , b ) the optimal rotation angle @xmath47 and c ) the extension of the long axis . </S>",
    "<S> the results are reproduced by a mcwf simulation including the experimental parameter dependences on atom number ( solid line ) . </S>",
    "<S> the dashed line indicates the results including additional noise during the readout sequence , the dotted lines are the corresponding classical limits . </S>",
    "<S> error bars are statistical 1 s.d . confidence intervals . ]    _ upscaling of tnt to large atom numbers . </S>",
    "<S> _ the obtainable phase precision in an interferometric sequence is limited by @xmath60 for a spin squeezed state with @xmath14 particles and spin squeezing parameter @xmath61 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , it is one of the main challenges to generate squeezing also for large atom numbers . </S>",
    "<S> it has been shown that the use of many mesoscopic condensates allows the upscaling of squeezing to large numbers @xcite by adding up the populations of the individual condensates . </S>",
    "<S> + to analyze the number squeezing parameter for different ensemble sizes , we sum the atom numbers of different lattice sites @xmath62 and @xmath63 ( upper left panel of fig.[fig4 ] ) and calculate @xmath64 in analogy to the evaluation for the single sites . </S>",
    "<S> for an evolution time of 15ms and the optimal angle @xmath65 , this analysis yields a noise suppression @xmath66db even for the full ensemble of 10200 particles ( gray circles in fig.[fig4 ] ) . as the classical reference , </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding scaling for a coherent spin state is in agreement with the shot - noise limit for all atom numbers ( diamonds ) . </S>",
    "<S> + the loss of squeezing for large atom numbers is caused both by atom number inhomogeneities over the array and technical noise sources , which are dominated by fluctuations of the magnetic bias field . </S>",
    "<S> the influence of the latter can be minimized by employing a differential analysis , in which the array is divided in two parts and the relative fluctuations of the two population imbalances @xmath67 and @xmath68 are analyzed . </S>",
    "<S> this is robust against the technical fluctuations , as these are suppressed for the difference @xmath69 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding relative squeezing parameter @xmath70 quantifies the noise suppression relative to the classical limit @xmath71 . with this analysis </S>",
    "<S> , we find @xmath72db for the full sample . </S>",
    "<S> this is on a comparable level with the value of @xmath73db that can be obtained using one - axis twisting @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> + the remaining decrease of squeezing can be attributed to the atom number dependence of the tnt squeezing scheme ( fig.[fig5 ] ) , for which the degree of single - site squeezing improves as the particle number increases . </S>",
    "<S> this results from the particle number dependence of the detuning since the intra - species scattering lengths of the two components are slightly different . </S>",
    "<S> the numerical solution of the stationary gross - pitaevskii equation for our experimental situation reveals to good approximation the scalings @xmath74 and @xmath75 . </S>",
    "<S> both effects are included in the mcwf simulation ( solid lines ) . </S>",
    "<S> since we fix the angle of rotation to @xmath65 , the strong dependence @xmath47 on atom number ( see fig.[fig5]b ) mainly limits the scalability using mesoscopic samples with varying atom number . </S>",
    "<S> note that this atom number dependence of the final state is stronger compared to the one - axis - twisting scheme , which leads to the slightly lower value for the relative squeezing of the full ensemble . </S>",
    "<S> + for the sum of several independent condensates , the two - mode approximation is not valid , and the mean spin length has to be extracted from the visibility @xmath76 of ramsey fringes . as we observe @xmath77% for the full ensemble , the whole resource can be directly exploited for quantum enhanced measurements , either in a dc or a gradiometric scheme . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding spin squeezing parameters @xcite are @xmath78db for the direct analysis , and @xmath79db for the differential case , showing the applicability for quantum - enhanced metrology .    </S>",
    "<S> _ conclusion . </S>",
    "<S> _ we have shown that the twist - and - turn scheme can efficiently generate spin squeezing on short experimental time scales and is thus favorable for squeezing in lossy environments . </S>",
    "<S> these spin squeezed states can be directly employed in quantum - enhanced measurement schemes , which have already been demonstrated for clocks and magnetometry @xcite . extending this process to 1d systems , </S>",
    "<S> the criticality of the tnt scheme is the underlying mechanism of the miscible - immiscible quantum phase transition at zero temperature @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such a system is ideally suited for studies of spatial quantum correlations and scaling behavior in pattern formation dynamics .    </S>",
