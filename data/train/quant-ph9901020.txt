    "when the boundaries of the quantum radiation field are set in motion , low frequency photons may be excited out of the vacuum field state .",
    "such quantum effect is closely related to the radiation pressure exerted on the moving boundaries by the vacuum field  @xcite .",
    "given its conceptual importance , one has proposed an experiment to observe the effect with the aid of high - q microwave cavities  @xcite .",
    "exact relativistic results are known for one  dimensional models  @xcite , but the analysis of realistic 3d configurations usually demands some perturbation method . several different perturbation approaches  @xcite@xcite",
    "have been successfully employed to compute the radiation effect induced by the nonrelativistic motion of a broad variety of 3d boundaries . in reference",
    "@xcite , the photon emission rates induced by the oscillation of a single perfectly - reflecting plane mirror were obtained by taking the long wavelength approximation and assuming the motion induced corrections to be small .",
    "more recently , this particular perturbation approach was also employed in the problem of two plane mirrors forming a cavity  @xcite .    the connection between the nonrelativistic limit and the long wavelength approximation may be understood by considering the example of a mirror oscillating at frequency @xmath0 with amplitude @xmath1 then the nonrelativistic limit translates into @xmath2 and since the emitted photon frequencies satisfy the inequality @xmath3",
    "@xcite , they correspond to wavelengths @xmath4 much larger than @xmath1 in this long wavelength regime , the scattering of a plane wave of frequency @xmath5 usually generates sidebands at frequencies @xmath6 with amplitudes of the order of @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is any integer . hence the sidebands have amplitudes which are increasingly small as the order @xmath8 increases . moreover , the motion induced correction of the elastic scattered component is usually of the order of @xmath9 therefore , the photon emission effect induced by a nonrelativistic motion may be analyzed by taking a first - order expansion in @xmath10 and then the entire motion effect is contained in the sidebands at @xmath11 accordingly , in this approach the motion induced terms are treated as small perturbations which may be computed directly from the field for a mirror at rest  @xcite",
    ".    however , when the incident wave is polarized so that the magnetic field is perpendicular to the plane of incidence ( tm polarization ) , the first downshifted sideband ( @xmath12 ) may be intense if the parameters are such that it corresponds to a grazing wave ( peak amplitude value of the order of @xmath13 such enhancement effect , which is reminiscent of the wood s anomalies in the scattering by a diffraction grating at rest , first explained by rayleigh in the beginning of the century  @xcite , was analyzed in reference  @xcite from the point - of - view of classical wave optics , always in the long wavelength approximation .",
    "it takes place over a very narrow spectral interval , and may be interpreted in terms of resonances associated to the plane symmetry ( in the context of diffraction gratings , a discussion along these lines was proposed by fano @xcite ) .",
    "more specifically , the resonances are related to surface waves ( plasmons ) which are the field eigenfunctions for the unperturbed system ( surface at rest ) . in the perfect - reflection limit considered here ,",
    "they are expelled from the medium and then degenerate into grazing travelling waves .",
    "these unperturbed eigenfunctions are tm polarized ( so that the electric field is perpendicular to the surface of the mirror ) , thus no resonance enhancement occurs for te scattering in the long wavelength approximation .    as for the motion induced quantum radiation effect , in order to compute the emission rate taking these resonances into account ,",
    "we follow in this article a nonperturbative scheme , though still assuming a nonrelativistic motion , which allows us to employ the long wavelength approximation .",
    "we consider in detail the contribution of tm - polarized vacuum fluctuations which propagate along directions nearly parallel to the surface of the mirror .",
    "as we show below , the motion induced correction to tm - polarized nearly grazing waves is not a small perturbation in this case , and the dynamical coupling between different sidebands must be taken into account . as a result",
    "the elastic field components are strongly modified , leading to a shift of the resonance frequency for generation of photons .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 , we expand the scattered field as a superposition of sidebands in order to derive a nonperturbative solution of the boundary condition associated to an oscillating mirror , which is then used in section 3 to compute the photon emission rate .",
    "section 4 presents a discussion and some final remarks .",
    "we consider a plane perfectly  reflecting mirror oscillating along the direction perpendicular to its surface , which we take along the @xmath14 axis . the mirror s position at time @xmath15",
    "is given by the equation @xmath16 we use mks units and take @xmath17 @xmath18 as usual we decompose the electromagnetic field into components according to whether the electric field is perpendicular ( te ) or parallel ( tm ) to the plane of incidence .",
    "as a consequence of the plane symmetry , the two polarizations are uncoupled in the scattering by the moving mirror , and accordingly we have two separate problems to solve . in the case of te polarization ,",
    "the perturbation approach is always valid in the long wavelength regime ( as in the problem of reflection by a shallow diffraction grating ) , so that we only consider in this paper the generation of tm photons out of the vacuum radiation field .",
