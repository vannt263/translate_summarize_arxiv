    ", we elucidate such relations in 2d systems with mirror symmetries by analyzing properties of the fourier transformed local density of states around a single static impurity of an arbitrary kind ( potential , magnetic , dipolar , etc . ) .",
    "we show that while generically the positions of high intensity peaks of ft - ldos at a given energy are determined by the shape of the iso - energy contour@xcite , peaks at @xmath0 vanishes if the two bloch states separated by @xmath2 on the contour have opposite mirror eigenvalues . moreover , the inverse statement is also true : by identifying the absence of these peaks in a multi - band system , we know that the two states mirror eigenvalues of each band on mirror symmetric lines in bz , thus partly revealing the orbital nature of these bands .",
    "( ` orbital ' includes orbital and spin degrees of freedom . )    the surface states of the recently discovered topological crystalline insulators ( tci ) make an example of a multi - orbital 2d metal . among the intensive theoretical efforts on topological phases beyond those protected by time - reversal symmetry@xcite ,",
    "hsieh _ et al _ predicted@xcite , via first principles calculation , that snte is a nontrivial insulator whose topology is protected by mirror symmetries , dubbed mirror symmetric topological crystalline insulator ( mstci ) , characterized by robust surface states on the @xmath3-plane which contains in the surface brillouin zone ( bz ) four dirac points ( two along @xmath6-@xmath7-@xmath6 and two along @xmath8-@xmath7-@xmath8 ) .",
    "this prediction has been experimentally confirmed@xcite through the use of angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) in pb@xmath4sn@xmath5te .",
    "furthermore@xcite , as the binding energy increases away from the dirac point binding energy , the surface states undergo a lifshitz transition at a critical energy @xmath9 where the iso - energy contour changes from two separate ellipsoids to two concentric ellipsoids .",

    ", i.e. , the two degenerate states at each dirac point have different mirror eigenvalues . in this paper",
    ", we show that it can be promptly identified by examining the vanishing intensities in the ft - ldos .    to numerically verify the theory , we use symmetry analysis to derive a minimal four - band model that semi - quantitatively recovers the observed dispersion and the lifshitz transition .",
    "we calculate the ft - ldos around a point charge impurity and see complete intensity suppression at wavevectors connecting two states with opposite mirror eigenvalues , even when the scattering is _ not _ forbidden by trs .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec.[general ] , we develop a general analysis for the qpi in 2d systems with mirror symmetries and trs , focusing on the general properties of the pattern and the symmetry forbidden scattering channels in ft - ldos . in sec.[application ] , we apply the general theory to the surface states of tci snte , deducing all forbidden channels of ft - ldos based on experimental facts only ; then we develop an effective theory that captures the main features of the surface states and perform a numerical study which confirms our results . in sec.[discussion ] , we discuss how the general theory can be applied to systems without spin orbital coupling , where trs forbidden channels no longer exist and the limitations of our study .",
    "we begin by considering a multi - band homogeneous 2d system with the following symmetries : mirror reflections about @xmath10- and @xmath11-planes and trs . in matrix representation ,",
    "the single particle hamiltonian @xmath12 and symmetry operators satisfy : @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , where @xmath12 is written in an arbitrarily chosen orbital basis and @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 ( @xmath19 , with @xmath20 being complex conjugation ) are the unitary matrices representing the symmetry operations in the same basis . in the presence of impurities , the local density of states is defined as @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the @xmath23-th single particle eigenstate and @xmath24 the corresponding energy . under fourier transform , it becomes the ft - ldos [ eq : rho ] & & ( q,)= + & & -_ktr[g(k , k+q,)-g^(k+q , k , ) ] , where @xmath25 is the total number of unit cells in the system , and @xmath26 the retarded green s function . for a single point impurity given by a matrix @xmath27 in the chosen basis ,",
    "the exact t - matrix approach solves @xmath26 in terms of the homogeneous green s function @xmath28 : [ eq : fullg ] & & g(k , k+q,)= + & & g_0(k,)_q0+g_0(k,)t()g_0(k+q , ) , where @xmath29 .",
    "the matrix @xmath30 contains the effect of impurity and is defined as t()=v(i - g()v)^-1 , where @xmath31 .",
    "the pattern of @xmath0 naturally depends on the type of impurity , namely , the form of matrix @xmath27 .",
    "@xmath27 is denoted by three indices @xmath32 , where @xmath33 means that the impurity changes / does not change sign under @xmath34 and trs , respectively .",
    "for example , the combination @xmath35 is an impurity that is invariant under mirror reflection about @xmath10-plane and trs yet changes sign under a mirror reflection about @xmath11-plane .",
    "the physical realization of this type is an electric dipole oriented along @xmath36-axis . for any of the eight types , we derive the exact and approximate symmetries of @xmath0 and summarize them in table [ tab : impurity ] ( for derivation , see appendix [ derivation ] ) . here , ` approximate ' indicates that the relation is valid only when @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the homogeneous density of states at @xmath1 .        besides the global symmetries in @xmath0 derived above , the most important feature of the ft - ldos is the presence of _ singularities _ at certain scattering vectors , i.e. , @xmath2-vectors .",
    "we start from eq.([eq : fullg ] ) by rewriting the retarded green s function in terms of projectors : [ eq : g_projector ] & & tr[g(k , k+q,)]= + & & _ mn , where @xmath39 is the band index and @xmath40 is the projector onto the @xmath39-th band , and @xmath41 is the periodic part of the bloch state at @xmath42 with band index @xmath39 .",
    "( in eq.([eq : g_projector ] ) , we ignore the first term in eq.([eq : fullg ] ) that gives the homogeneous dos , as we are interested in the inhomogeneous part of ldos . )",
    "the most significant contribution to @xmath0 comes from regions near the two poles of eq.([eq : fullg ] ) at @xmath43 and @xmath44 respectively .",
    "physically , @xmath0 comes from the elastic scattering between two states of energy @xmath1 possessing a momentum difference @xmath45 . from this picture , we know that the ft - ldos is nonzero at @xmath46 if there are two states on the iso - energy contour of @xmath1 and separated by @xmath2 .",
    "in fact , closer study@xcite shows that @xmath0 is divergent at @xmath2 , if the normal directions , of the contour at @xmath47 and @xmath48 , determined by the gradient of the dispersion , are parallel or anti - parallel .",
    "as the gradient of dispersion is the quasiparticle group velocity , this shows that the forward ( with zero scattering angle ) and backward scattering ( with @xmath49 scattering angle ) are the major channels .",
    "any pair of @xmath50 s satisfying this condition are called a pair of stationary points denoted by @xmath51 , and generically @xmath0 is divergent at @xmath52 .",
    "each divergence in reality becomes a finite peak due to finite quasiparticle lifetime [ finite @xmath53 in eq.([eq : g_projector ] ) ] .",
    "the intensity of the peak is given by the pre - factor @xmath54 $ ] [ see eq.([eq : g_projector ] ) ] .",
    "when the two states at @xmath51 are _ orthogonal _ , we have @xmath54=0 $ ] hence the peak at @xmath55 is strongly suppressed .",
    "this _ absence _ of singularities in the ft - ldos pattern is a symmetry protected property of the system , because in general @xmath56 can only be guaranteed by the presence of an underlying symmetry .",
    "for example in trs ti , the two states at @xmath42 and @xmath57 on the iso - energy contour are orthogonal because they are related by trs .",
    "this leads to the suppression of @xmath58 that is a hallmark of trs ti@xcite .",
    "mark that the suppression discussed here is completely independent of the symmetries of impurity , but only depends on the symmetries of the homogeneous system .    in a system with mirror symmetries",
    "@xmath16 and @xmath17 , @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) ensures the orthogonality between two states with _ different _ eigenvalues of @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) thus leading to forbidden scattering channels . in general",
    ", @xmath16 symmetry gives @xmath59 and specially at @xmath60 it gives @xmath61 , where @xmath62 .",
    "therefore , any two states on the iso - energy contour with @xmath60 are a stationary pair",
    ". additionally , as @xmath63=0 $ ] , these states are eigenstates of @xmath16 , having eigenvalue @xmath64@xcite .",
    "the general conclusion is that if the states at @xmath65 and @xmath66 have different mirror eigenvalues , the peak in ft - ldos at @xmath67 is suppressed .",
    "the inverse statement is also true : if ft - ldos due to stationary pair scattering at @xmath68 suppressed , where @xmath69 is the scattering vector between two states along @xmath60 , then states at @xmath65 and @xmath66 have opposite eigenvalues of @xmath16 .",
    "similar statements can be made for the states along @xmath70 axis on the iso - energy contour at @xmath71 , using @xmath17 symmetry .",
    "experimentally , the suppressed peaks in ft - ldos is observed by comparing it to the joint density of states ( jdos ) , @xmath72 , or , the number of states per unit energy at energy @xmath1 and momenta @xmath50 satisfying @xmath45 . the jdos can be experimentally obtained by convolving the arpes measured spectral weight@xcite .",
    "formally , @xmath72 is defined as & & _ j(q,)= + & & -[_m , n , k ] . when compared with eq.([eq : g_projector ] ) , the only difference is that in @xmath72 the factor @xmath73 $ ] is missing .",
    "hence @xmath72 is completely determined by the geometric features of the iso - energy contour .",
    "a comparison between @xmath0 and @xmath72 thus gives information of the wave functions , because any stationary vector that is present in @xmath72 but absent in @xmath0 indicates that the two wave functions at the contributing stationary points are orthogonal .",
    "we apply the general result to surface states of pb@xmath4sn@xmath5te , to elucidate how its unique topological properties manifest themselves in qpi .",
    "the surface states exist around @xmath6 and @xmath8@xcite , and let us first focus on the states around @xmath6 , then due to @xmath74 symmetry , a parallel analysis can be repeated for those around @xmath8 . along @xmath75 , there are two dirac points ( denoted by @xmath76 ) , or , band crossings . since that the two bands crossings have opposite eigenvalues of @xmath16 , and that trs inverts @xmath16 eigenvalue from @xmath64 to @xmath77 , the only possible configuration of @xmath16 eigenvalues is the one shown in fig.[fig : fs](a ) , up to an overall sign .",
    "besides the two dirac points at fermi energy @xmath78 , there are two additional dirac points higher and lower than @xmath78 at @xmath6 ( denoted by @xmath79 ) . along the perpendicular direction @xmath80",
    ", however , there is no band crossing point . along this line",
    ", bands can either have the same eigenvalues of @xmath17 and hence repel each other ( fig.[fig : fs](b ) ) , or they can have the same eigenvalue of @xmath17 but opposite effective mass ( fig.[fig : fs](c ) ) .",
    "@xmath79 are protected by trs and therefore appear in both directions ; the other two dirac nodes , @xmath76 are protected only by @xmath16 symmetry . to see the lifshitz transition , we find that for @xmath81 , the bands along @xmath82 do not cross @xmath1 , resulting in an iso - energy contour of two separate ellipsoids centered at @xmath76 respectively . from fig.[fig : fs](a ) , along @xmath83 , the two points on the same side of @xmath6 have opposite eigenvalues of @xmath16 . while for @xmath84 or @xmath85 , the bands along @xmath82 cross @xmath1 twice , resulting in an iso - energy contour of two concentric loops centered at @xmath6 .",
    "the two crossing points on same side of @xmath6 have the same mirror eigenvalue according to fig.[fig : fs](b / c ) .",
    "this analysis gives us the mirror eigenvalues on the iso - energy contours before and after the lifshitz transition , marked in fig.[fig : fs](d , e ) .",
    "we now use the general theory to obtain the following pairs of suppressed peaks in ft - ldos : @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 before the lifshitz transition ( @xmath89 defined as @xmath90 ) , and @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 and @xmath96 after the lifshitz transition .",

    "we develop a minimal @xmath107-model which qualitatively captures the surface band dispersion both before and after the lifshitz transition and calculate @xmath0 around a point impurity ( most common impurity in pb@xmath4sn@xmath5te ) . near the dirac points @xmath76 , the system can be approximated by two separate two - band @xmath107 models .",
    "nevertheless , in order to describe the lifshitz transition where the two cones cross each other , one needs to consider the hybridization between the two cones and , thus , the minimal model is at least four - band . at @xmath6",

    "assuming that the distortion breaks @xmath16 , we know that : first , the two dirac nodes along @xmath140 are no longer protected and open a gap of @xmath141 ; second , the lifshitz transition happens at two different energies , @xmath142 and @xmath143 , for the surface states around @xmath6 and around @xmath8",

    "the effective theory around @xmath8 is obtained by rotating the model in eq.(6 ) by @xmath151 , and in this theory , the distortion term corresponds to @xmath150 . in fig.[fig : gapped ] , we choose @xmath152ev and calculate the iso - energy contours at @xmath102ev in ( a ) , @xmath153ev in ( b ) , @xmath138ev in ( c ) and @xmath154ev in ( d ) . from these figures ,",

    "the resultant qpi patterns , @xmath133 , at these energies are plotted in fig.[fig : gapped](e , f , g , h ) respectively .",
    "these patterns are simply superpositions of patterns contributed by states around @xmath6 and those around @xmath8 ; each pattern explicitly breaks fourfold rotational symmetry .",
    "another important feature is that all @xmath2-vectors that are forbidden by @xmath16 are now present .",

    "gapped](f ) , the inner circle is contributed by the surface states around @xmath6 . on this circle ,",

    "compare this with fig.1(b ) , we can see that the distortion makes the intensity at @xmath157 finite .",
    "the main results apply to any 2d or quasi-2d systems with mirror symmetries and , in a multi - orbital system can be used to identify the orbital nature of the bands on an iso - energy contour .",
    "for example , using our theory in conjunction with sts , one may use qpi to establish or disprove the long predicted dirac metal state@xcite in the sdw phase of 1111-family of iron - based superconductors .",
    "when applying the theory to the cases where spin - orbital coupling is negligible ( e.g. , in iron - based superconductors ) , or more accurately , where su(2 ) symmetry is restored , we note the following differences : ( i ) mirror eigenvalues become real numbers @xmath158 and ( ii ) there is no trs forbidden channel due to spin degeneracy . compared with arpes with polarized light that also resolves orbitals for bands lower than the fermi energy in the absence of magnetic field",
    ", qpi can be applied to field induced phases and to states above the fermi energy .    in the application to pb@xmath4sn@xmath5te",
    ", it is necessary to point out that we have assumed that @xmath0 contains contributions only from scattering between states near @xmath6 .",
    "however , the full qpi pattern also consists of the scattering among states near @xmath8 and the inter - pocket scattering between states near @xmath6 and those near @xmath8 . yet due to @xmath74-symmetry , the contribution to @xmath0 made by states near @xmath8 can be obtained easily by making a fourfold rotation of @xmath0 contributed by states around @xmath6 . the inter - scattering between states near @xmath8 and those near @xmath6 only contributes to @xmath0 near @xmath159 .",

    "k_y , ) , + m_yzg_0(k_x , k_y,)m^-1_yz&=&g_0(-k_x , k_y , ) , + u_tg_0(k,)u_t^-1&=&g_0^t(-k,).the symmetries of @xmath30 , however , depends on symmetries of both the system _ and _ the impurity , i.e. , the @xmath53-index . using definitions of @xmath53-index and eq.(3 ) , one obtains : [ eq : ttransform1 ] m_xzt()m_xz^-1=_xv(i-_xg()v)^-1&=&t()_x=1 , + & ~&-t()_x=-1 , + m_yzt()m_yz^-1=_yv(i-_yg()v)^-1&=&t()_y=1 , + & ~&-t()_y=-1 , + u_tt()u_t^-1=(_tv(i-_tg()v)^-1)^t&=&t^t()_t=1 , + & ~&-t^t()_t=-1 . here ` @xmath161 ' means that the relation becomes exact only if @xmath30 is replaced by its leading order , i.e. , @xmath162 .    combining equations in eqs.([eq : ttransform1 ] ) , one easily obtains other two equations : [ eq : ttransform2 ] ( m_xzm_yz)t()(m_xzm_yz)^-1=_x_yv(i-_x_yg()v)^-1&=&t()_x_y=1 , + & ~&-t()_x_y=-1 , + ( m_xzm_yzu_t)t()(m_xzm_yzu_t)^-1=[_x_y_tv(i-_x_y_tg()v)^-1]^t&=&t^t()_x_y_t=1 + & ~&-t^t()_x_y_t=-1 .",
    "now we use eqs.([eq : gtransform ] ) and eqs.([eq : ttransform1 ] ) and have ( q_x , q_y,)&=&_k[tr(m_xzg_0(k_x , k_y,)t()g_0(k_x+q_x , k_y+q_y,)m^-1_xz)-(q - q)^ ] + & = & _ k[tr(g_0(k_x , k_y,)m_xzt()m_xz^-1g_0(k_x+q_x , k_y - q_y,))-(q - q)^ ] + & = & ( q_x ,- q_y,)_x=1 + & ~&-(q_x ,- q_y,)_x=-1 , ( q_x , q_y,)&=&_k[tr(m_yzg_0(k_x , k_y,)t()g_0(k_x+q_x , k_y+q_y,)m^-1_yz)-(q - q)^ ] + & = & _ k[tr(g_0(k_x , k_y,)m_yzt()m_yz^-1g_0(k_x - q_x , k_y+q_y,))-(q - q)^ ] + & = & ( -q_x , q_y,)_y=1 + & ~&-(-q_x , q_y,)_y=-1 , ( q_x , q_y,)&=&_k[tr(u_tg_0(k_x , k_y,)t()g_0(k_x+q_x , k_y+q_y,)u_t^-1)-(q - q)^ ] + & = & _ k[tr(g_0(-k_x - q_x ,- k_y - q_y,)(u_tt()u^-1_t)^tg_0(-k_x ,- k_y,))-(q - q)^ ] + & = & _ k[tr(g_0(k_x - q_x , k_y - q_y,)(u_tt()u^-1_t)^tg_0(k_x , k_y,))-(q - q)^ ] + & = & ( q_x , q_y,)_t=1 + & ~&-(q_x , q_y,)_t=-1 .",
    "we can also use eqs.([eq : gtransform ] ) and eqs.([eq : ttransform2 ] ) to obtain , very similarly , ( q_x , q_y,)&=&(-q_x ,- q_y,)_x_y=1 + & ~&-(-q_x ,- q_y,)_x_y=-1 , + ( q_x , q_y,)&=&(-q_x ,- q_y,)_x_y_t=1 + & ~&-(-q_x ,- q_y,)_x_y_t=-1 . up to now we have derived all symmetries , exact and approximate , of @xmath0 listed in table i.",
    "in the text , we mention that although we have only studied the case of a single impurity , the result extends to the case where there are random impurities of the same type and strength and when the impurity strength is weak . here we prove that under these conditions , the ft - ldos around a single impurity , @xmath0 , can be related to the autocorrelation function of the overall ldos resulted from many impurities , @xmath160 . by definition , r(r,)=_n|_n(r)|^2(-e_n)=-im[g(r , r , ) ] , where @xmath163 is an eigenfunction of the hamiltonian , having eigenvalue @xmath164 .",
    "the fourier transform of @xmath165 is , in terms of the retarded green s function , r(q,)=_ktr[g(k , k+q,)-g^(k+q , k , ) ] , which is identical to the expression of @xmath166 in the case of a single impurity .",
    "but now @xmath26 does not have a simple expression as in eq.(3 ) in the text , since the system contains more than one impurity .    by definition",
    ", we have the fourier transform of the correlation function @xmath167 as ( from here , we suppress the argument of @xmath1 for concision ) c(q)&=&r(r+r)r(r)(-iqr ) + & = & |r(q)|^2.therefore the fourier transform of the autocorrelation function @xmath167 is exactly the ensemble average of the module squared fourier component @xmath168 .    for an arbitrary configuration of identical impurities ,",
    "the retarded green s function is g(k , k+q)=g_0(k)_q0+g_0(k)v(q)g_0(k+q)+_kg_0(k)v(k - k)g_0(k)v(k-k - q)g_0(k+q)+ ... where @xmath169 is the fourier transform of the impurity potential . from the above equation we have @xmath168 as & & r(q)=_0_q0+_ktr[g_0(k)v(q)g_0(k+q)-g^_0(k+q)v(q)g^_0(k ) ] + & + & _ k , k_ktr[g_0(k)v(k - k)g_0(k)v(k-k - q)g_0(k+q)-g_0^(k+q)v(k-k - q)g^_0(k)v(k - k)g^_0(k)]+ ... for @xmath170 ,",
    "the lowest order in @xmath171 is the second order in @xmath27 :      total number of impurities . up to this point",
    ", we have proved that fourier transform of the autocorrelation function @xmath167 of the overall ldos @xmath165 is proportional to @xmath171 in the limit of weak impurities . in other words , the singularities in @xmath173 can be revealed in the autocorrelation of ldos in the case of multiple identical impurities ."
