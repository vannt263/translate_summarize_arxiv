    "a _ quandle _ is a set @xmath3 with a binary operation @xmath4 satisfying the three axioms    ( )    for every @xmath5 , we have @xmath6 ,    for every pair @xmath7 there is a unique @xmath8 such that @xmath9 , and    for every @xmath10 , we have @xmath11 .",
    "the uniqueness in axiom ( ii ) implies that the map @xmath12 defined by @xmath13 is a bijection ; the inverse map @xmath14 then defines the _ dual operation _ @xmath15 .",
    "the set @xmath3 then forms a quandle under @xmath16 , called the _ dual _ of @xmath17 .",
    "quandle theory may be thought of as analogous to group theory .",
    "indeed , groups are quandles with the quandle operation given by @xmath0-fold conjugation for an integer @xmath0 , i.e. , @xmath18 another important example of a type of quandle structure is the category of _ alexander quandles _ , i.e. , modules @xmath19 over the ring @xmath20 $ ] of laurent polynomials in one variable with quandle operation @xmath21 the second author has written elsewhere on alexander quandles ; see @xcite and @xcite .    other examples of quandles include _ dehn quandles _ , i.e. , the set of isotopy classes of simple closed curves on a surface @xmath22 with action given by dehn twists , and _ coxeter quandles _ , i. e. , @xmath23 with @xmath24 where @xmath25 is a symmetric bilinear form .",
    "see @xcite and @xcite for more .",
    "so far , quandles have been of interest primarily to knot theorists , due to their utility in defining invariants of knots . in @xcite",
    ", a quandle is associated to every topological space , called the _ fundamental quandle . _ in particular , it is shown that isomorphisms of the _ knot quandle _",
    "( definable from a knot diagram by a wirtinger - style presentation ) preserve peripheral structure , making the knot quandle a complete invariant of knot type considered up to homeomorphism of topological pairs , though not up to ambient isotopy .",
    "finite quandles have been used to define invariants of both knots and links in @xmath26 and generalizations of knots such as knotted surfaces in @xmath27 and virtual knots .",
    "the simplest example of such an invariant is the number of homomorphisms from the knot quandle to a chosen finite quandle .",
    "one can also obtain knot invariants by counting homomorphisms with crossings weighted by quandle cocyles arising in various quandle cohomology theories .",
    "see @xcite and @xcite for more .    in this paper , we show how to associate to any finite quandle @xmath28 an @xmath1 matrix @xmath29 .",
    "we then define an equivalence relation on the set of @xmath1 quandle matrices , which we call @xmath30-equivalence ( after we decided that our initial choice of `` @xmath31-equivalence '' would be confusing ) . our main theorem",
    "then says that two such matrices represent isomorphic quandles iff they are @xmath30-equivalent .",
    "we then give an algorithm for applying this result to determine all isomorphism classes of quandles with @xmath0 elements as well as their automorphism groups , and as an application we determine all isomorphism classes and automorphism groups of quandles with up to @xmath2 elements .",
    "after the initial posting of the preprint of this paper to arxiv.org , a paper with similar results was posted by lopes and roseman @xcite .",
    "we have also learned that related results were obtained by hayley ryder in her dissertation @xcite .",
    "let @xmath32 be a finite quandle with @xmath0 elements .",
    "we define the matrix of @xmath3 , denoted @xmath29 , to be the matrix whose entry in row @xmath33 column @xmath34 is @xmath35 : @xmath36.\\ ] ] the matrix @xmath29 is really just the quandle operation table considered as a matrix , with the columns acting on the rows . in particular , if the elements of the quandle are the numbers @xmath37 with @xmath38 , call @xmath29 an _ integral quandle matrix_. we may obtain an integral quandle matrix by suppressing the `` @xmath39 ' 's in the notation and just writing the subscripts ; hence we lose no generality by restricting our attention to integral quandle matrices .",
    "if the entries on the diagonal in an integral quandle matrix are in the usual order , i.e. , @xmath40 , then @xmath41 is just the entry in row @xmath33 column @xmath34 .",
    "an integral quandle matrix of this type is in _",
    "standard form_.    the quandle axioms place certain restrictions on what kind of matrices can arise from a quandle .",
    "[ mqdef ] let @xmath42 be an @xmath43 matrix with @xmath44 .",
    "then @xmath45 for a finite quandle @xmath3 if and only if the following conditions are satisfied :    ( )    the diagonal entries are distinct , i.e. @xmath46 implies @xmath47 . if this condition is satisfied , denote the row number containing @xmath39 on the diagonal by @xmath48 and the column number containing @xmath39 on the diagonal by @xmath49 .",

    "it is worth noting that if @xmath3 is not a quandle but a _ rack _ , i.e. if @xmath71 satisfies quandle axioms ( ii ) and ( iii ) but not necessarily ( i ) , then corollary [ rcl ] does not hold , and there is no standard form matrix presentation for non - quandle racks . in particular , to represent racks with matrices , we need to keep track of which row and column represent which element of @xmath3 , since unlike the quandle case , in a non - quandle rack we can not recover this information from the matrix itself .",
    "if @xmath45 is an integral quandle matrix for a quandle @xmath3 then the trace of @xmath29 is @xmath72    by lemma [ mqdef ] , the diagonal is a permutation of @xmath73 . then @xmath74    let @xmath75 be a permutation of @xmath76",
    ". set @xmath77 where @xmath38 and @xmath78 is the permutation matrix of @xmath31 .",
    "then we say @xmath79 is _ p - equivalent _ or _ permutation - equivalent _ to @xmath29 , and write @xmath80 .",
    "the fact that @xmath30-equivalence is an equivalence relation follows from the fact that @xmath81 is a group .",

    "then @xmath87 says that in the operation table of @xmath84 , the element in row @xmath88 and column @xmath89 is @xmath90 ; that is , we obtain an operation table for @xmath84 by applying the permutation @xmath31 to every element in the table , including the row and column labels ( which we can recover from the diagonal ) .",

    "is called a _ latin square _ , and",

    "if a quandle is isomorphic to union of a proper subset of conjugacy classes in a group , then the group elements defining some inner automorphisms may not be elements of the quandle , and we can have connected quandles which are non - latin .",

    "it is easy to check that there is only one quandle of order 1 and one quandle of order 2 , both trivial ( i.e. , @xmath136 . ) application of the above algorithm shows that there are three quandle isomorphism classes of order 3 , 7 isomorphism classes of quandles of order 4 and 22 isomorphism classes of quandles of order 5 .",
