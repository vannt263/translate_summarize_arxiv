    "the evolution of turbulence in magnetically confined plasmas is a complex problem that is not yet completely understood besides the huge amount of work on this topic ( @xcite and the references there in ) .",
    "low - frequency drift type turbulence , which has significant influence on the magnetic confinement of high temperature plasmas , is extensively studied especially in connection with fusion research ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "most of the studies that go beyond the quasilinear stage are based on numerical simulations or on simplified models .",
    "they show a complex nonlinear evolution with generation of large scale structures , increase of order and appearance of zonal flow modes ( @xcite , @xcite ) that leads to the nonlinear damping of turbulence .",
    "the stochastic particle advection that appears in turbulent plasmas due to the @xmath0 ( or electric ) drift determined by the fluctuating potential can produce trajectory trapping or eddying around contour lines of the potential .",
    "trapping has a strong effect on the statistics of particle trajectories .",
    "analytical methods adequate to the study of particle stochastic advection in the presence of trapping were developed only in the last decade ( @xcite , @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "they permitted to understand that trapping determines strong departure from the characteristics of gaussian advection processes .",
    "the aim of this paper is to contribute to the understanding of the effects of trajectory trapping on the evolution of drift turbulence .",
    "these are the first analytical results on this complex problem that are in agreement with numerical simulations .",
    "test particle trajectories are strongly related to plasma turbulence .",
    "plasma dynamics is basically described by the vlasov - maxwell system of equations , which represents the conservation laws for the electron and ion distribution functions along particle trajectories coupled with the constraints imposed by maxwell equations .",
    "analytical studies of plasma turbulence based on trajectories were initiated by dupree @xcite , @xcite and developed especially in the years seventies @xcite .",
    "these methods do not account for trajectory trapping and thus they apply to the quasilinear regime or to unmagnetized plasmas .",
    "a very important problem that has to be understood is the effect of the non - standard statistical characteristics of the test particle trajectories on the evolution of turbulence in magnetized plasmas .",
    "a lagrangian approach is developed , which extends the lagrangian methods of the type of @xcite , @xcite , @xcite to the nonlinear regime characterized by trapping .",
    "we study linear modes on turbulent plasma with the statistical characteristics of the potential considered known .",
    "drift turbulence in hot magnetized plasmas is considered .",
    "analytical expressions are derived , which approximate the growth rates and the frequencies of the test modes as functions of the characteristics of the background turbulence .",
    "they provide an image of turbulence evolution .",
    "we show that there is a sequence of processes , which appear at different stages of evolution as transitory effects and that the drift turbulence has an oscillatory ( intermittent ) evolution .",
    "a different perspective on important aspects of the physics of drift type turbulence in the strongly non - linear regime is deduced . the main role in these processes",
    "is shown to be played by ion trapping .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the dispersion relation for the drift modes on turbulent plasmas is deduced in section 2 .",
    "it is shown that the effects of the background turbulence are contained in a function of time that enters in the ion propagator .",
    "it is an average over the stochastic ion trajectories in the background turbulence .",
    "the statistical methods for evaluating this function are shortly presented in section 3 .",
    "the next three sections present the effects of the turbulence on the test modes for quasilinear turbulence , weak nonlinear regime ( when the fraction of trapped ions is small ) and strong nonlinear regime ( with strong trapping ) .",
    "the evolution of the drift turbulence is discussed at each stage .",
    "the summary of results and the conclusions are presented in section 8 .",
    "drift waves and instabilities are low - frequency modes generated in non - uniform magnetically confined plasmas . depending on the particular conditions ,",
    "there are several types of drift modes .",
    "since the aim of this work is to understand the effects of trapping on the evolution of turbulence , we consider a simple confining geometry , the plane plasma slab , in which the magnetic field is straight and uniform .",
    "plasma has low @xmath1 , which means that the perturbation of the magnetic field is negligible ( electrostatic approximation ) .",
    "the magnetic field is along @xmath2 axis ( @xmath3 and plasma is non - uniform in one direction taken along @xmath4 axis . for simplicity , the equilibrium temperatures are uniform and only the density @xmath5 is @xmath6-dependent .",
    "the characteristic length of density variation @xmath7 is much larger than the wave length of the drift modes .",
    "we start from the basic description of this ( universal ) drift turbulence provided by the drift kinetic equation in the collisionless limit .",
    "electron kinetic effects produce the dissipation mechanism to release the energy and , combined with finite larmor of the ions , make drift waves unstable .",
    "the latter consist of the polarization drift velocity and of the modification of the electric drift velocity due to the gyro - average of the potential on the ion orbits .",
    "both effects determine the decrease of mode frequency below the diamagnetic frequency , which makes the growth rate positive . beside this ,",
    "the polarization drift has a more complex influence determined by its nonzero divergence .",
    "we neglect here the modification of the potential and consider the effects of the polarization drift .",
    "the reason is that , as shown below , the background turbulence in the nonlinear regime eliminates the effects of the finite larmor radius on the frequency .",
    "thus , this approximation that determines sensible simplifications of the calculations has negligible influence on the phenomenology of  drift turbulence evolution in the nonlinear regime .",

    "the dispersion relation for turbulent plasmas is determined in subsection 2.2 , where we show that the background potential modifies the propagator of the modes through trajectory distribution and also by a compressibility effect produced by the polarization drift .",
    "we begin with the electrons and show that their response is the same in quiescent and turbulent plasmas because actually they do not `` see '' the turbulence due to the fast decorrelation produced by the motion along the magnetic field .",

    ", we make an additional simplification , which has the advantage of simplifying the analytical expressions : we neglect the change of the potential by the gyro - average and take the same potential in the ion and electron equations .",
    "the reason is that the turbulence evolves in the nonlinear stage to correlation lengths much larger than the ion larmor radius and the effect of potential gyro - average becomes negligible .",
