    "granular materials play an important role in industrial applications , geophysics and astrophysics .",
    "they are also of a great general interest to physicists , as each of the  phases `` of granular materials : solid , liquid and gas have unusual properties that distinguish them from their classic ( atomic ) counterparts @xcite",
    ". we will consider granular gas ( or rapid granular flow ) and focus on a variant of clustering instability , a striking tendency of granular gases to form dense clusters .",
    "clustering instability was first discussed in the context of a freely ' ' cooling \" granular gas @xcite . following these works ,",
    "related clustering phenomena were investigated in driven granular gases as well , both in experiments @xcite and in particle simulations @xcite .",
    "granular clustering results from energy losses by inelastic collisions , and it is a manifestation of thermal condensation instability , also encountered in other fields , for example in gases and plasmas that cool by their own radiation @xcite . since the discovery of the clustering instability , the validity of granular hydrodynamics ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) has been under scrutiny @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the clustering in a freely `` cooling '' granular gas , where one deals with a complex time - dependent process , steady states are achievable in driven granular systems .",
    "one of the simplest settings of this type is driving the granulate by a side wall at a zero gravity .",
    "therefore , an ensemble of inelastically colliding hard spheres , confined in a box and driven by one or two  thermal \" walls has served as a prototypical driven granular system @xcite .",
    "steady states of this system have served as test beds for granular hydrodynamics and its violations .",
    "the first analysis of this system in the physical literature was performed , in one dimension , by kadanoff _",
    "the nearly elastic particles were constrained to move on a straight line with energy input from the boundaries .",
    "particle simulations @xcite showed that , for typical initial conditions , the system evolves to a state where the particles are separated into two groups .",
    "almost all particles form a cluster in a small region of space , where they move with very small velocities , while a very few remaining particles move with high velocities .",
    "clearly , this steady state can not be described by granular hydrodynamics ( actually , by any coarse - grained theory ) .",
    "therefore , the results of kadanoff _ et al . _",
    "@xcite brought into question the validity of granular hydrodynamics in general .",
    "this question was addressed in two subsequent theoretical works @xcite that dealt with similar systems in two dimensions .",
    "esipov and pschel @xcite investigated an ensemble of nearly elastic hard disks in a circular box with the circumference serving as thermal wall .",
    "@xcite considered a rectangular box , one side of which served as thermal wall .",
    "particle simulations @xcite showed granular clusters : dense and  cold \" regions of granulate developing away from the thermal wall . in terms of thecoarse - grained particle density ,",
    "these steady - state clusters had simple shapes : azimuthally uniform ( circular state ) @xcite and laterally uniform ( strip state ) @xcite .",
    "et al . _ also showed that , for nearly elastic collisions , the strip state is describable by a steady - state solution of granular hydrodynamic equations .",
    "the empiric constitutive relations suggested by grossman _",
    "used simple interpolations between the low - density limit , where the constitutive relations are derivable systematically @xcite , and high - density limit where , close to the dense packing , free volume arguments can be used .    the results of refs .",
    "@xcite showed that the anomaly observed in the one - dimensional setting @xcite does not persist in higher dimensions .",
    "clustered states qualitatively similar to those of grossman _",
    "_ were observed in experiment of kudrolli _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite who investigated a system of spherical particles in a box , rolling on a smooth surface and driven by a rapidly vibrating side wall .",
    "the number of particles served as the control parameter in ref .",
    "a dense cluster of the strip type was observed when the number of particles was big enough , in much the same way as in ref .",
    "the basic physics of the strip state is simple and can be explained by the following hydrodynamic argument . because of the inelastic collisions the particle random motion slows down ( that is , the granular temperature decreases ) with the increase of the distance from the driving wall .",
    "to maintain the momentum balance , the granular density should increase with this distance . when the total number of particles is big enough ( the rest of parameters being the same )",
    ", the density contrast becomes large , and the enhanced density region away from the driving wall is observed as the strip state .",
    "the prototypical system exhibits many interesting phenomena of _ non_-hydrodynamic nature .",
    "these include inelastic collapse @xcite , possible lack of scale separation @xcite , non - gaussianity in the particle velocity distribution @xcite , normal stress difference and pressure nonuniformities @xcite , etc .",
    "for nearly elastic collisions , however , granular hydrodynamics was shown to yield an accurate quantitative description in the dilute limit @xcite , and reasonably accurate description for moderate and high granular densities @xcite .",
    "of course , the nearly elastic limit is quite restrictive for most of realistic granular flows .",
    "still , this limit is conceptually important just because granular hydrodynamics can be used there .",
    "granular hydrodynamics has a great predictive power and helps to identify important collective phenomena ( shear flows and vortices , shocks , different modes of clustering flows etc . )",
    "that are difficult , if not impossible , to identify and predict in the language of individual particles .",
    "once identified , these phenomena can then be investigated in experiment and simulations in more general ( not necessarily hydrodynamic ) formulations .",
    "therefore , granular hydrodynamics provide a leading - order approach to a big ensemble of nearly - elastically colliding grains .",
    "this approach has been taken recently by livne _",
    "@xcite who employed granular hydrodynamics for a stability analysis of the strip state described above .",
    "the analysis revealed a spontaneous symmetry - breaking instability of the strip state with respect to perturbations along the strip .",
    "well within the instability region , the clustered states with broken symmetry , found by a numerical solution of the steady state hydrodynamic equation , are strongly localized in the lateral direction : most of the particles are located in dense  islands \" @xcite .",
    "these results indicate that the prototypical system can show a non - trivial behavior even in the leading - order , hydrodynamic limit .",
    "indeed , this systems can be put into the list of pattern - forming systems far from equilibrium @xcite .",
    "the present work focuses on a more detailed stability analysis of this system .",
    "our first objective is to check to what extent the symmetry - breaking instability predicted in ref .",
    "@xcite is sensitive to the constitutive relations .",
    "livne et al .",
    "@xcite employed the empiric relations suggested by grossman et al .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "we shall use the better known jenkins - richman ( jr ) relations @xcite . while the relations of grossman et al .",
    "are more accurate for high densities ( even including those close to the dense packing limit ) , the jr relations should work better at low and intermediate densities .",
    "we shall see , however , that the marginal stability curves , obtained with these two sets of relations , are not much different from each other .",
    "this implies that the symmetry - breaking instability is robust .",
    "our second objective is to get more insight into the marginal stability problem and , where possible , to obtain analytic results .",
    "we shall show that the marginal problem is equivalent to an eigenvalue problem of quantum mechanics .",
    "an important finding here is a universal behavior of the marginal stability curves in the limit when the density perturbations are strongly localized at the elastic wall opposite to the thermal wall . in the dilute limit , we obtain analytically the short- and long - wavelength asymptotics of the marginal stability curves and density eigenfunctions . we also give the physical interpretation to the symmetry - breaking instability and to the density borders of the instability region .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "2 we formulate the model and briefly describe the strip state : the simplest steady state of the prototypical system .",
    "section 3 presents marginal stability analysis of the strip state and compares the results obtained for two different sets of constitutive relations .",
    "more results on marginal stability , including some analytic results in the dilute limit , are presented in sec .",
    "section 5 includes a discussion and summary .",
    "the prototypical driven granular system in two dimensions include inelastically colliding hard disks of diameter @xmath0 and mass @xmath1 , moving in a box with dimensions @xmath2 .",
    "the gravity force is zero .",
    "collisions of disks with the walls @xmath3 and @xmath4 are assumed elastic .",
    "the wall @xmath5 is `` thermal '' wall : upon collision a particle is assigned a random velocity taken from a gaussian ensemble with temperature @xmath6 .",
    "energy input at the thermal wall balances the energy dissipation due to inter - particle collisions , so the system can reach a steady state .",
    "we shall parameterize the inelasticity of the particle collisions by a constant normal restitution coefficient @xmath7 and work in the nearly elastic limit : @xmath8 . in this limit",
    ", the navier - stokes granular hydrodynamics is expected to be sufficiently accurate in a system with a big number of particles and small knudsen number .",
    "the possible steady states of the system are described by the steady state versions of the momentum and energy balance equations : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the granular pressure , @xmath11 is the granular temperature , @xmath12 is the thermal conductivity and @xmath13 is the rate of energy losses by collisions .",
    "we assume that the number density @xmath14 is not too big : @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the ( hexagonal ) dense packing density .",
    "this assumption enables us to employ the constitutive relations derived by jenkins and richman @xcite . for the steady state problem ,",
    "the required constitutive relations include the equation of state @xmath17 and relations for @xmath12 and @xmath13 in terms of @xmath14 and @xmath11 .",

    "the boundary conditions for eq .",
    "( [ e4 ] ) are determined by the properties of the particle - wall interactions . at the elastic walls",

    "we have @xmath36 at these three walls . here",

    "notice that the steady - state _ density _ distributions are independent of the wall temperature @xmath6 , in contrast to the similar problem with gravity , where the gravity acceleration , combined with @xmath6 and the ( finite ) system size in the direction of gravity , would make an additional governing parameter .",
    "the laterally uniform steady state ( strip state ) corresponds to the one - dimensional ( @xmath45-independent ) solution @xmath46 .",
    "it is described by the equations @xmath47 where primes stand for the @xmath48 derivatives . for the strip state , the boundary condition at the wall @xmath37 drops out .",

    "this degeneracy of the strip state is caused by the character of particle interaction : the hard - core potential does not introduce any characteristic energy @xcite .",

    "the potential ( [ pot ] ) admits at most one such energy level .",

    "[ delta1 ] .",
    "one can see that , qualitatively , the results are the same : the both curves describe a symmetry - breaking instability at a critical value of the aspect ratio that depends on the area fraction . in both cases , there are sharp low- and high - density borders of instability region . therefore , we can conclude that the instability is robust and does not require a very special form of the constitutive relations . on the other hand , there is a noticeable ( about 15% ) difference in the exact positions of the marginal stability curves , so the instability provides a good quantitative test for constitutive relations of granular hydrodynamics .",
    "in this section we investigate the marginal stability problem in more detail and obtain some analytic results in the dilute limit .",
    "let us characterize the strip state by the scaled parameters @xmath28 and @xmath52 and introduce a different rescaling of the coordinate : @xmath83 . in terms of the original , physical coordinate @xmath84",
    "the new rescaling is independent of the system size : @xmath85 equations ( [ e7 ] ) for the strip state become @xmath86 while the eigenvalue problem ( [ e8 ] ) and ( [ e9 ] ) reads @xmath87 now the primes denote the derivatives with respect to @xmath88 , while @xmath89 is the new scaled wave number . like the coordinate @xmath88 , the new scaled wave number @xmath90 is independent of @xmath29 : @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the physical wave number .",
    "the problem ( [ strip1 ] ) and ( [ e16 ] ) is determined by two parameters : @xmath52 and @xmath28 .",

    "( [ e16 ] ) where it determines the scaled system size .",
    "if the wave function @xmath93 is strongly localized in the potential well @xmath94 ( correspondingly , the negative energy level is sufficiently deep ) , the results for @xmath90 and @xmath95 become independent of @xmath28 at sufficiently large @xmath28 .",
    "indeed , in this case one can safely move the boundary @xmath96 to infinity .",
    "it is important that , in this case , the exact form of the boundary condition at the driving wall becomes insignificant , leading only to exponentially small corrections @xcite .",
    "this universal  localization regime \" was discovered in ref . @xcite",
    "that employed a different set of constitutive relations .",
    "the criterion for localization can be obtained from the requirement that the localization length ( which is of order @xmath97 ) be much smaller than the ( scaled ) system size @xmath98 . in the physical units it corresponds to the short - wavelength limit of the bifurcating solution : @xmath99 . to fulfill this criterion",
    ", @xmath90 should be far enough from the borders of the instability interval , where @xmath90 vanishes . in the next subsection we will work in the dilute limit and",

    "an important issue that was not addressed in this work is selection : what is the wavelength of the resulting symmetry - broken cluster in an infinite , or long enough , system ?",
    "the selection has dynamical nature ; this important issue is addressed elsewhere @xcite .",

    "@xcite ) provides the region of parameters where the instability can be observed . an important issue is to eliminate the static friction between the particles and surface that occurs far enough from the driving wall . in experiment , this is achieved by slightly inclining the system , so that a very small gravity appears @xcite . as the result , the strip state moves down , toward the driving wall @xcite .",
    "the model problem investigated in the present work does not include gravity .",
    "we expect , however , that the symmetry - breaking instability should persist for a non - zero gravity .",
    "in fact , a similar instability has already been observed in particle simulations of a dilute two - dimensional granular bed fluidized by a rapidly vibrating bottom plate @xcite . under conditions of the simulations @xcite there was no direct , mechanical coupling between the bottom plate vibration and collective granular motions .",
    "therefore , the vibrofluidized system , investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite , is similar ( though not identical ) to the model system driven by a thermal wall .",
    "as gravity introduces an additional scaled parameter , the phase diagram of this type of systems should be more complicated .",
    "for example , it is already known that , at some values of the scaled parameters , steady  thermal \" convection ( steady state of a different type ) develops both in vibrofluidized systems @xcite and in systems driven by a  thermal \" wall @xcite .",
    "granular hydrodynamics will be instrumental in delineating the phase diagrams of these systems in the limit of nearly elastic collisions .    finally ,",
    "when inelasticity of the particle collisions is _ not _ small , the normal stress difference , possible lack of scale separation and non - gaussianity in the velocity distribution may become important .",
