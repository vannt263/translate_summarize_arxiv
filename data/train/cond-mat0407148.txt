    "dna is believed to form an effectively one - dimensional molecular wire , which is highly promising for diverse applications .",
    "actually , the modern development of physico - chemical experimental techniques enables us to measure directly dna electrical transport phenomena even in single molecules @xcite .",
    "moreover , several groups have recently performed numerical investigations of localization properties of dna electronic states based on realistic dna sequences @xcite .",
    "however , dna transport properties still remain a controversial topic , mainly due to tremendous difficulties in setting up the proper experimental environment and the complexity of the molecule itself .",
    "specifically , a distinctive feature of biological polymers is the complicated composition of their elementary subunits , and an apparent ability of their structures to support long - living nonlinear excitations .",
    "although a number of theoretical explanations for dna charge transfer / transport phenomena have been suggested on the basis of standard solid - state - physical approaches , like polarons , solitons , electrons or holes @xcite , the situation is still far from working out a unique , non - contradictory theoretical scheme .    in their polaron - like model , hennig and",
    "coworkers studied electron breather propagation along dna homopolynucleotide duplexes , i.e. in both poly(dg)-poly(dc ) and poly(da)-poly(dt ) dna polymers @xcite , and , for this purpose , estimated electron - vibration coupling strength in dna using semiempirical quantum - chemistry @xcite .",
    "have also considered a possible mechanism to explain the phenomena of dna charge transfer @xcite .",
    "the charge coupling with dna structural deformations can create a polaron and thus promote a localized state @xcite . as a result , the moving electron breather may contribute to highly efficient long - range conductivity .",
    "recent experiments seem to support the polaron mechanism for the electronic transport in dna polymers @xcite .    in the present paper ,",
    "we investigate localization properties of electronic states in a stochastic bond vibration model of poly(dg)-poly(dc ) and poly(da)-poly(dt ) dna polymers by adopting the model by hennig _",
    "_ @xcite . here",
    "we assume that the disorder is caused by dna vibrational modes , and via electron - vibrational coupling it influences the charge transfer / transport along dna duplexes .",
    "moreover , we discuss the difference in charge localization properties between poly(dg)-poly(dc ) and poly(da)-poly(dt ) dna polymers , as well as the peculiarities of the mixed ( at / gc ) model .    the outline of the present paper is as follows . in the next section",
    "we introduce the dna model to investigate subsequently the electronic states and their coupling to dna vibrational modes . in the sec .",
    "3 we present numerical results concerning the influence of changes of the hydrogen - bond stretchings and twist angles as well as the effects of finite system size on the localization properties .",

    "this section reformulates the model hamiltonian for dna duplexes , as introduced by hennig _",
    "@xcite into a one - electron tight - binding adiabatic hamiltonian with structural disorder , taking into account a nearest - neighbor electron hopping term .",
    "the latter model is actually akin to that proposed earlier by dunlap - kundu - philips ( dkp ) .",
    "specifically , the general dkp model contains disorder induced by the proper vibrational modes , which shows up in both the diagonal and the off - diagonal parts of the electron hamiltonian @xcite . generally , in the dkp model the transport can arise from a set of measure - zero unscattered states at a particular energy derived from the resonant transmission formula @xcite , and the number of the unscattered states",
    "can be estimated by the resonance width in the system size .",
    "the hamiltonian for the electronic part in our dna model is given by @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are creation and annihilation operators of an electron at the site @xmath3 .",
    "the on - site energies @xmath4 are represented as @xmath5 where @xmath6 is a constant and @xmath7 denotes the fluctuation caused by the coupling with the transversal watson - crick h - bonding stretching vibration .",
    "the transfer integral @xmath8 depends on the three - dimensional stacking - distance @xmath9 between adjacent bases labeled by @xmath3 and @xmath10 , along each strand and is given as , @xmath11 the parameters @xmath12 and @xmath13 , which describe the strength of the interaction between the electronic and spatial variable , have been previously calculated through quantum - chemical methods .",
    "radial displacements bring about also a variation of the distances between neighboring bases along each strand @xmath9 .",
    "the first  order taylor expansion around the equilibrium positions is given by @xmath14 @xmath15 represents the equilibrium radius of the helix , @xmath16 is the equilibrium twist angle between base pairs , and @xmath17 the equilibrium distance between bases along a strand given by @xmath18 with @xmath19 being the distance between neighboring base pairs in the direction of the helix axis .",
    "a sketch of the geometrical parameters @xmath20 and @xmath9 is given in fig.1 .     and @xmath9 are indicated . ]",
    "we adopt realistic values of the parameters obtained from the semi - empirical quantum - chemical calculations ; @xmath21@xmath22 $ ] , @xmath23@xmath22 $ ] for the coupling parameters of the poly(da)-poly(dt ) dna polymer , @xmath24@xmath22 $ ] , @xmath25@xmath22 $ ] for the ones of the poly(da)-poly(dt ) dna polymer . as to the other typical parameters for dna molecules , we use : @xmath26,v_{0}=0.1 [ ev]$ ] , @xmath27@xmath28 , r_{0}=10 [ $ ] @xmath28 $ ] and @xmath29 .",

    "although the fluctuation of the on - site energy is almost of the same order in both poly(dg)-poly(dc ) and poly(da)-poly(dt ) dna polymers , the fluctuation of the transfer integral @xmath8 in the poly(dg)-poly(dc ) dna polymers is much larger than that of the poly(da)-poly(dt ) dna polymers .",

    "we use the localization length @xmath44 and/or lyapunov exponent @xmath45 calculated by the mapping ( 6 ) in order to characterize the exponential localization of the wave function .",
    "originally the lyapunov exponent ( inverse localization length ) is defined in the thermodynamic limit ( @xmath46 ) , however , in the present paper we use the following definition for the lyapunov exponents of the electronic wave function for a large system size @xmath47 @xcite .",
    "@xmath48 we use appropriate initial conditions @xmath49 , and for large @xmath50 the localization length and lyapunov exponent are independent of the boundary condition . the system size dependence of the localization length is investigated in subsect.3.3 in the relation with the resonance energy .",

    "for the computation of the energy dependence of the localization length we used a energy subdivision of 800 points in the energy range .",
    "the extent of the localization depends on the fermi energy of the electroads when we measure the transmission coefficient or conductance .",
    "it is apparent that the localization length is reduced as a result of the increase of the fluctuation strength @xmath32 of the hydrogen bond stretching .",
    "the small peaks for the resonance energy are suppressed in @xmath56 due to the large fluctuation in the @xmath7 .",
    "figure 3(b ) and ( c ) show the localization length as a function of the energy in the case of poly(dg)-poly(dc ) and the mixed dna polymers , respectively . in fig.3(b )",
    "the global behavior is almost the same as that illustrated in fig.3(a ) except for the shape of the energy dependence . the localization length in the poly(da)-poly(dt )",
    "dna polymer is globally larger than the one in poly(dg)-poly(dc ) dna polymer .",
    "the reason is simply because the fluctuation strength of @xmath8 in poly(dg)-poly(dc ) dna polymers is larger than the one in poly(da)-poly(dt ) dna polymers as seen in fig.2 .    in the mixed case ,",
    "the localization length in the mixed sequence shows the intermediate behavior between the poly(dg)-poly(dc ) and poly(da)-poly(dt ) dna polymers .",
    "the resonance peak structure in the energy dependence of the localization length is not as pronounced as in the case of poly(da)-poly(dt ) and poly(dg)-poly(dc ) dna polymers .    as a result , more disorder in the h - bond stretching ( higher w values ) renders the peak structure in the electronic states to disappear and makes the latter more localized .",
    "the finite system effect will be discussed in subsect.3.3 .     in the ( a ) poly(da)-poly(dt )",
    "dna polymers , ( b ) poly(dg)-poly(dc ) dna polymers and ( c ) mixed dna polymers .",
    "the system size is @xmath57 and @xmath58 . ]      in this subsection , we investigate how the localization length depends on the helical twist angle @xmath16 of the dna double helix .",
    "it is known that the allowed values of the angle range from ca .",
    "@xmath59 till @xmath60 .",
    "figure 4 shows the energy dependence of the localization length for some twist angles in the dna models .",
    "we conclude , that in poly(da)-poly(dt ) polymers the change of the angle does virtually not affect the localization length , however , in the poly(dg)-poly(dc ) polymer it does have an impact .",
    "the difference is caused by the @xmath16 dependence of the fluctuation of the transfer energy @xmath8 which is smaller in the case of the poly(dg)-poly(dc ) polymer than in its poly(da)-poly(dt ) counterpart as seen in fig.2(b ) .",
    "it follows that when the twist angle increases in the poly(dg)-poly(dc ) dna polymer the localization length becomes smaller ( larger ) in the low ( high ) energy region .     in the ( a ) poly(da)-poly(dt )",
    "dna polymers , ( b ) poly(dg)-poly(dc ) dna polymers and ( c ) mixed dna polymers .",
    "the system size is @xmath57 and @xmath34 . ]",
    "figure 5 shows the system size dependence of the localization length in the poly(dg)-poly(dc ) polymer and the poly(da)-poly(dt ) polymer .",
    "although the states for most of energies are exponentially localized , and have well - pronounced resonant maxima at discrete points correspond to the eigenenergies of each system when the system size is relatively small ( @xmath61 ) .",
    "electronic states whose energy is close to resonance peaks have a tendency to be extended in the sense that their localization length is larger than the system size . for the larger system size the energy dependence of the localization length converges .    in our definition of the localization length , when the system size @xmath47 is smaller than the localization length , the sharp energy dependence of the resonance peaks appears , and the structure of the resonance depends on the randomness in @xmath7 of each sample .",
    "note that the resonance structure can be washed out if we take the ensemble average @xmath62 with regard to different configurations of @xmath7 even for @xmath34 .",
    "as a result we can say the transfer and transport of the electron sharply depend on the fermi energy of the electroades as the system size is relatively small .",
    "the extended states caused by the resonance can contribute to the transfer of the electron .     in the ( a ) poly(da)-poly(dt ) dna polymers , ( b ) poly(dg)-poly(dc ) dna polymers and ( c ) mixed dna polymers .",
    "@xmath34 and @xmath58 .",
    "we have numerically investigated localization properties of electronic states in an adiabatic polaron model of poly(dg)-poly(dc ) and poly(da)-poly(dt ) dna polymers with realistic parameters obtained using semi - empirical quantum - chemical calculations .",
    "now , we are in a position to compare the localization properties of the poly(dg)-poly(dc ) , poly(da)-poly(dt ) dna polymers and the mixed case .",
    "figure 6(a ) and ( b ) show the localization length and lyapunov exponent ( inverse of the localization length ) in the three types of the polymers with @xmath34 . in the low energy region , the localization length in the poly(dg)-poly(dc ) dna polymer is larger than that in the poly(da)-poly(dt ) dna polymer . on the other hand ,",
    "it is known from the experiments that poly(dg)-poly(dc ) oligomer is a better semiconductor than poly(da)-poly(dt ) oligomer @xcite .",
    "the difference is caused by the dynamical effect which is neglected in this paper and the system size effect .",
    "indeed , the localization length of the dna polymers is larger than @xmath63 $ ] in almost all the energy band for all models , that is much larger than the system size of the oligomer used in the experiments .",
    "as seen in fig.5 in the smaller system size the resonance peaks become complex ."
