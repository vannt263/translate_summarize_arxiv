    "while optically bright quasars are the most spectacular expression of accretion onto supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) at galaxy centers , it is widely believed that smbhs grow most of their mass during obscured phases , in which the detection of the nuclear power becomes challenging ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "large amounts of gas and dust are found to hide the majority of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) in the nearby and distant universe , as demonstrated by deep and wide x - ray surveys over different sky fields ( see e.g. , @xcite for a review ) . from @xmath1330 to @xmath1350% of all agn are believed to be obscured by extreme gas column densities above @xmath14@xmath10 .",
    "these objects are dubbed `` compton - thick '' and represent the most elusive members of the agn population .",
    "the evidence for an abundant population of local compton - thick objects is compelling : up to @xmath15 of nearby seyfert 2s contain a compton - thick nucleus @xcite ; about 50 objects - mostly local - have been certified as `` bona - fide '' compton - thick agn by x - ray spectral analysis @xcite .",
    "synthesis models of the x - ray background ( xrb ) suggest that compton - thick agn must be abundant at least up to @xmath16 to explain the peak of the xrb at 30 kev ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "a population of distant , compton - thick agn , as abundant as that predicted by xrb synthesis models , is also required to match the smbh mass function measured in nearby galaxies with that of `` relic '' smbhs grown by accretion ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in recent years it has been proposed that compton - thick agn represent a key phase of the bh / galaxy coevolution , during which the bh is producing most of its feedback into the host galaxy ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and it has also been suggested that their number density steeply increases with redshift @xcite .",
    "the observation of heavily obscured agn at high-@xmath17 , @xmath18 , remains challenging and it is very difficult to estimate their abundance since they produce only a small fraction of the xrb emission and are thus poorly constrained by synthesis models .",
    "deep x - ray surveys have proven effective in revealing a few `` bona fide '' compton - thick agn at high - z .",
    "for instance , four such objects at @xmath19 have been discovered in the @xmath20 - deep field south ( cdfs ; see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "other examples of candidate compton - thick agn at high - z have been reported ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , even up to z=5.8 @xcite , albeit with poorer x - ray photon statistics .",
    "selection techniques based on the strength of the mid - ir emission with respect to the optical and x - ray emission have also been developed and applied to select large populations of candidate compton - thick agn up to @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "once more , however , the lack of x - ray spectra prevents an unambiguous determination of the absorbing column density , making the measurements by these works largely uncertain .    in this paper",
    "we report the discovery of a `` bona - fide '' compton - thick agn at @xmath17=4.76 in the 4 ms cdfs . a concordance cosmology with @xmath22  km  s@xmath12  mpc@xmath12 , @xmath23",
    ", @xmath24 is adopted throughout this paper .",
    "we searched for @xmath25band dropout objects in the hst / acs v2.0 data of goods - south @xcite associated with x - ray emission in the 4 ms @xmath1 image .",
    "we used the @xmath26-dropout selection criteria from @xcite , which effectively pick sources at @xmath27-dropout if @xmath28 , 2 ] , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 . ] .",
    "details on the production of the @xmath2-dropout catalog are given in @xcite .",
    "additionally , we required a stellarity parameter ( class_star ) greater than 0.9 in the @xmath33 band to choose point - like sources .",
    "this led to 21 star - like @xmath26-dropouts with @xmath34 , among which there are four z@xmath135 galaxies , eleven stars , three lower - redshift galaxies , and one z@xmath135 agn , which is the only object detected in x - rays ( xid403 in the 4 ms cdfs catalog of @xcite ) .",
    "the remaining two candidates have not been identified spectroscopically .",
    "the measured ab magnitudes of xid403 in acs images are : @xmath35 .",
    "the 5@xmath36 detection limit in the @xmath37-band is 28.4 ab mag .",
    "xid403 ( @xmath38=03:32:29.29 , @xmath39=-27:56:19.5 ) was recognized as an agn at @xmath0 based on fors-2 spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "its optical spectrum exhibits a narrow ( fwhm@xmath40 km s@xmath12 ) ly@xmath41 emission line and a broader ( fwhm@xmath42 km s@xmath12 ) nv@xmath431240 emission line , with an integrated flux similar to ly@xmath41 . a more recent spectrum with deimos / keck confirms both features @xcite .",
    "the spectral energy distribution of xid403 was published by @xcite .",
    "based on a laboca detection at 870@xmath44 m , they showed that this source is a bright submillimeter galaxy with sfr@xmath131000 @xmath45 yr@xmath12 . a large reservoir of molecular gas ( @xmath46 ) was also identified through co(2 - 1 ) observations @xcite .",
    "we considered the same optical to mid - ir datasets used by @xcite and improved on the sed by adding the detection at 1.1 mm by aztec / aste ( @xmath47mjy ; scott et al .",
    "2010 ) and the @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 magnitudes from the deep nir imaging by hawk - i / vlt ( @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 ; @xcite ) .",

    "unfortunately , it falls just outside the areas covered by the @xmath55 m spitzer / irs mosaic @xcite and goods - herschel ( pi d. elbaz ) .",
    "xid403 is not detected in the 3 ms @xmath56 image of the cdfs .",
    "a total exposure of @xmath57 ms has been accumulated on the cdfs as a result of 54 individual observations with acis - i performed during three different time periods : @xmath58 ms in 2000 , @xmath59 ms in 2007 and @xmath60 ms in 2010 .",
    "x - ray data products , including event files for each observation and also for the merged dataset are publicly available . in this paper",
    "we use the data products by @xcite who derived x - ray source catalogs from a full reprocessing and astrometric recalibration of the event files .",
    "we used ciao v4.1 and the funtools package to perform x - ray aperture photometry at the position of xid403 .",
    "the separation between the optical and x - ray centroids is @xmath61 , which is well within the @xmath62 x - ray source positional uncertainty ( @xmath130.47  ) . to maximize the s / n ratio , we measured the source counts in different bands within a small aperture of 3  radius , which encloses @xmath1350% of the psf at 1.5 kev at the source location ( @xmath63 arcmin off - axis ) .",
    "we measured @xmath64 net counts in the 0.9 - 4 kev band , corresponding to a @xmath3 detection net counts in the 0.5 - 8 kev band ( 100% psf ) in @xcite , in agreement with our estimate . ] .",
    "we verified that similar results are obtained when using different local background regions .",
    "the hardness ratio , defined as hr = ( h - s)/(h+s ) , where s and h are the net counts observed in the 0.5 - 2 kev and 2 - 7 kev bands , respectively , is hr=@xmath4 ( not corrected for vignetting ) .",
    "this value , for an agn at @xmath5 with a standard intrinsic spectrum ( i.e. , @xmath8 ) is highly suggestive of heavy obscuration . for comparison",
    ", an agn at @xmath5 with @xmath65@xmath10 is expected to have hr@xmath66 at the source position .",
    "we extracted the x - ray spectrum in the 0.5 - 7 kev band using the same 3  radius aperture and verified that below 0.9 kev and above 4 kev the source emission is indistinguishable from the background .",
    "the spectrum and response files were created using the psextract script in ciao . since psextract does not account for the psf fraction when building up the effective area file , we multiplied the 0.5 - 2 kev and 2 - 10 kev fluxes as obtained from the spectral fit by a factor of 2 and 2.5 , respectively , to recover the full aperture - corrected x - ray fluxes .",
    "we found consistent results either using spectral responses extracted from individual observations , or those obtained as an exposure - weighted mean over all individual responses . to double",
    "check the reliability of this procedure we also built spectral response files for one of the @xmath1 exposures ( obsid=8594 ) using the acis - extract software @xcite which allows proper construction of effective area files at any psf fraction . again , consistent results are found when using the acis - extract responses .",
    "we analyzed the x - ray spectrum with xspec v11.3.2 using the cash statistic @xcite to estimate the best - fit parameters .",
    "errors are quoted at @xmath62 confidence level .",
    "we first fitted the data using a powerlaw spectrum modified by galactic absorption , which returns @xmath67 .",
    "we then used the plcabs model @xcite , which follows the propagation of x - ray photons within a uniform , spherical obscuring medium , accounting for both photoelectric absorption and compton scattering .",
    "this model can be used in the case of heavy absorption ( up to @xmath68 @xmath10 ) and up to rest - frame energies of @xmath69 kev .",
    "when fixing the photon index to @xmath8 , we derived a compton - thick column density of @xmath9 @xmath10 ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "if we conservatively assume @xmath70 , which is @xmath71 off the average intrinsic agn value , we still obtain @xmath72 @xmath10 .",
    "the measured absorption should be interpreted as a lower limit , since a cold reflection model ( pexrav ) , corresponding to @xmath73 @xmath10 , provides an equally good fit . fitting the data with the recent mytorus model @xcite , which accounts for a toroidal distribution of the obscuring matter ,",
    "again returns @xmath72 @xmath10 .",
    "no prominent iron k@xmath41 line is observed at 1.1 kev ( i.e. , 6.4 kev rest - frame ) , but this is not in conflict with the compton - thick scenario .",
    "indeed , the @xmath74 ew scales with @xmath75 , so that ew@xmath761 - 2 kev , as is typical of compton - thick agn , would translate into ew@xmath77170 - 340 ev .",
    "we verified that such a weak line can be easily accomodated in the fit and that only loose upper limits can be derived for the equivalent width ( ew@xmath78 kev at 90% c.l . ) .",
    "the aperture - corrected x - ray fluxes , as extrapolated from the x - ray fit , are @xmath79 erg @xmath10 s@xmath12 and @xmath80 erg @xmath10 s@xmath12 . the intrinsic ( de -",
    "absorbed ) , rest - frame 2 - 10 kev luminosity is @xmath11 erg s@xmath12 , which places xid403 at the low end of the x - ray luminosity range for type-2 quasars .",
    "admittedly , the uncertainties in the geometry of the obscuring ( and reprocessing ) material might substantially affect the derivation of the intrinsic luminosity .",
    "however , we note that , if the spectrum were produced by pure reflection and a typical reflection efficiency of @xmath81 is assumed @xcite , the intrinsic luminosity would be even higher .",
    "xid403 was detected in the 1 ms cdfs catalog by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* xid=618 ) , with @xmath82 erg @xmath10 s@xmath12 and @xmath83 erg @xmath10 s@xmath12 .",
    "the @xmath84 times larger soft x - ray flux is likely due to contamination from high background fluctuations over the larger ( 8  radius ) extraction region adopted in that catalog .",
    "we checked the photometry of the 2000 , 2007 and 2010 periods separately using a smaller 3  radius : no significant source variability is detected in any band .",
    "xid403 was below the detection thresholds of the 1 ms cdfs catalog by @xcite and 2ms cdfs catalogs by @xcite .",
    "we searched for additional indicators of heavy obscuration by considering data at other wavelengths .",
    "we first investigated the observed ( i.e. , not corrected for absorption ) , rest - frame 2 - 10 kev to @xmath85 luminosity diagnostic ratio ( x / ir , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we derived the x - ray luminosity from the spectral fit and used the @xmath86 rest - frame luminosity ( derived from the spitzer / mips datapoint at 24@xmath44 m ) as a proxy for the @xmath85 luminosity .",
    "the x / ir ratio of @xmath87 would place xid403 in the region populated by compton - thick agn @xcite .",
    "when considering the @xmath88 vs @xmath89 color diagram elaborated by @xcite , xid403 would fall in `` cell e '' , where a significant fraction ( @xmath90 ) of galaxies is found to host a heavily obscured , candidate compton - thick agn .",
    "we then built the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) from the x - rays to the radio regime ( see fig.2 ) .",
    "as already shown by @xcite , the radio to fir emission of this source is dominated by dusty star formation , at a rate of @xmath131000 @xmath45 yr@xmath12 .",
    "we note that x - ray binaries associated to such a high sfr would produce @xmath91 erg s@xmath12 ( @xcite ) , similar to the @xmath74 value",
    ". however , x - ray binaries have on average much softer spectra ( @xmath92 , @xcite ) than observed ( @xmath93 ) .",
    "if absorption is invoked to explain such a spectral hardness , then intrinsic luminosities of @xmath94 erg s@xmath12 are derived , which are incompatible with x - ray binary emission .    a reasonable match with the mir to uv datapoints",
    "could be obtained with a reddened qso template with @xmath95 ( adopting the extinction curve of @xcite ) .",
    "when converting the measured optical extinction into an equivalent hydrogen column density by applying the relation valid for the milky way ism ( @xmath96 ) , we find @xmath97 @xmath10 , which is three dex smaller than what is estimated from the x - ray spectral fit . a mismatch between the x - ray and the optically estimated column density , in the range of @xmath98 ,",
    "is observed in local agn , calling for a number of interpretations ( e.g. , low dust - to - gas ratio ; * ? ? ?",
    "the mismatch observed in xid403 is @xmath131000 , which would make this object extreme . in their sed analysis @xcite",
    "suggest a different , stellar origin for the optical / uv rest frame emission . following the parameterization used by @xcite and @xcite for obscured agn",
    ", we fitted the sed of xid403 with a stellar component , an agn torus component , and a dusty starburst component .",
    "the dusty starburst is responsible for the bulk of the fir to radio emission , while the agn torus produces the entire emission at 24@xmath44 m ( 4@xmath44 m rest - frame ) .",
    "a galaxy template with @xmath99 , @xmath100 and a @xmath131-gyr - old constant star formation rate nicely fits the optical / uv@xmath101 data . however , a possible problem in interpreting the optical / uv@xmath101 emission as stellar light is that xid403 is pointlike in the deep hst / acs images ( class_star=0.99 in @xmath102 and @xmath33 ) , which would imply a half - light radius of @xmath103 kpc .",
    "although very compact morphologies have been observed in a fraction of distant sub - mm galaxies @xcite , the pointlike nature of xid403 , coupled to the presence of broad nv emission , might suggest that the optical / uv@xmath101 light has a nuclear origin .",
    "in particular , we could be looking at a fraction ( @xmath104 ) of nuclear radiation that leaks out without being absorbed or is scattered towards us and thus would be polarized .",
    "if true , the effective extinction to the nucleus would be much higher than that estimated by fitting the whole mir to uv emission with a reddened qso template , being more in line with the large x - ray column density .",
    "this interpretation has been already proposed by @xcite to explain the relatively blue optical / uv emission and broad line components of two sub - mm galaxies at @xmath105 hosting heavily obscured agn , similar to xid403 .",
    "also , although the stellarity parameter is uncertain for the faint @xmath106-band detection , the decrease of class_star from 0.95 in @xmath48 to 0.74 in @xmath106 may also suggest that the host galaxy contributes significantly only at @xmath107 .",
    "in fig.2 we show a possible sed decomposition for xid403 obtained by adding an agn torus component and a scattering component ( corresponding to @xmath104 of the agn intrinsic uv emission ) to the sed of arp220 . in summary",
    ", the full sed analysis shows that xid403 is not a classic , type-2 qso ( i.e. , a narrow - line , x - ray obscured agn whose physical properties can be explained within the standard , geometry - based unified model ; @xcite ) , but points to a complex physical picture likely related to its active assembly phase .",
    "the ir emission from the agn torus and the measured x - ray emission are used ( see e.g. , @xcite ) to derive an agn bolometric power of @xmath108  erg  s@xmath12 . assuming that the bh is radiating at the eddington limit , as might be expected during these active bh and galaxy build - up phases ,",
    "would imply @xmath109 .",
    "this in turn gives @xmath110 , which is a factor of 5 smaller than the local value .",
    "it would then seem that both bh and stellar mass are rapidly growing towards their final values , but the bh is lagging behind as seen in sub - mm galaxies at @xmath111 @xcite and expected by recent semi - analytic models of bh / galaxy formation @xcite .",
    "however , since the estimated bh mass is a lower limit ( accretion might be sub - eddington ) and the stellar mass derived in the previous section might be an upper limit ( the agn likely contributes to the optical / uv@xmath101 light ) , this ratio might well be equal to the local value .      while the space density of luminous , unobscured and moderately obscured qsos declines exponentially at @xmath112 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the behaviour of heavily obscured objects has still to be properly determined .",
    "semi - analytic models of bh / galaxy evolution linking the obscuration on nuclear scales to the gas availability in the host galaxy ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , would predict an increasing abundance of obscured agn towards high redshifts , and some observational evidence of this trend has been reported ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "we considered the number of compton - thick agn as expected from the synthesis model by @xcite .",
    "xid403 is detected with a 2 - 10 kev flux @xmath113 times larger than the detection limit at its position .",
    "the mean limiting flux over the 160 arcmin@xmath114 goods - s area is @xmath115 erg @xmath10 s@xmath12 . using the @xcite model",
    ", one would expect from 0.06 to 0.6 compton - thick agn in the range of @xmath27 with @xmath116 erg @xmath10 s@xmath12 in goods - s , depending on whether their space density undergoes the same high - z decline as observed for less obscured qsos or stays nearly constant .",
    "clearly , any firm conclusion is prevented by the low statistics .",
    "however , the mere presence of a compton - thick agn at @xmath117 in such a small area ( and this could be a lower limit since we did not investigate the whole x - ray source catalog ) might suggest that the space density of compton - thick agn is not rapidly declining towards high redshifts .",
    "this shows that the detection of even a small number of heavily obscured agn at @xmath117 in ultra - deep x - ray surveys would have a strong leverage on our understanding of early bh evolution .",
    "x - ray spectral analysis is the only unambiguous way to determine whether an agn is shrouded by compton - thick matter .",
    "observations at energies above 10 kev are an obvious way to identify compton - thick agn , but the current high - energy instrumentation and that foreseen in the near future ( @xmath118 , @xmath119 ) will not allow sampling objects beyond @xmath120 .",
    "below 10 kev , sensitive observations with limiting fluxes of @xmath121 erg @xmath10 s@xmath12 over wide sky areas , such as those from the proposed missions @xmath122 @xcite and @xmath123 @xcite , would be required .",
    "the only concrete way to detect and unambiguously recognize high - z compton - thick agn in the near future is through even deeper observations with @xmath1 .",
