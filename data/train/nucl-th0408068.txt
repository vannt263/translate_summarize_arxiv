    "it is nowadays widely accepted that quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) is the basic theory of strong interactions . over the years , however , one has learned that qcd manifests itself with different degrees of freedom in different energy regimes .",
    "as a consequence one resorts to separate approaches for the solution of qcd depending on the energy domain one is working in .",
    "low - energy qcd is characterized by the appearance of constituent quarks as quasiparticles ( see , e.g. , the lattice studies in ref .",
    "therefore , it seems to be appropriate to treat hadrons in terms of constituent quarks .",
    "an effective tool towards a comprehensive description of low - energy hadron phenomena is offered by constituent quark models ( cqms ) .",
    "they can be designed to incorporate the essential ingredients of low - energy qcd . at the same time",
    "they can make use of a covariant formulation so as to allow for the necessary relativistic treatment of hadrons as composite systems of constituent quarks confined to a relatively small volume .",
    "when building a cqm one faces the problem of the proper effective interaction between the constituent quarks . while the confinement can readily be modeled after lattice results of qcd ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , there are alternative approaches to the hyperfine interaction of the constituent quarks .",
    "one type of hyperfine interaction between constituent quarks derives from one - gluon exchange ( oge ) @xcite .",
    "several cqms are based on this dynamical concept @xcite .",
    "while oge cqms have a long tradition , all of them are facing some serious problems especially in baryon spectroscopy .",
    "in particular , they do not manage to describe in a uniform manner the level schemes in the @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath0 spectra in accordance with experimental data @xcite .",
    "another approach to the hyperfine interaction of constituent quarks considers instanton - induced effects @xcite .",
    "the cqm based on this concept also encounters similar difficulties in the @xmath2 and @xmath3 spectra as it can not reproduce the correct level orderings of positive- and negative - parity excitations @xcite .",
    "congruent with the assumption of constituent quarks as the essential degrees of freedom at low energies is the appearance of goldstone bosons .",
    "therefore , it seems to be quite natural to derive the hyperfine interaction from goldstone - boson exchange ( gbe ) @xcite .",
    "a cqm based on this dynamical concept has indeed been quite successful in describing the excitation spectra of the light and strange baryons @xcite .",
    "the specific spin - flavor symmetry that is brought about by gbe allows to reproduce in a unified framework specifically the characteristic patterns in the level schemes of the @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath0 spectra @xcite .",
    "the cqm of ref .",
    "@xcite uses only a part of the dynamics offered by gbe , namely , only the spin - spin part of the pseudoscalar exchange .",
    "obviously , one is interested in the performance of a more complete model that takes into account also the other force components of the single goldstone - boson exchange , such as the complete tensor force , as well as the possibilities offered by multiple gbe @xcite .",
    "first preliminary attempts in this direction were already made in refs .",
    "@xcite . in the present paper",
    "we report an extended version of the gbe cqm that includes all relevant force components offered by pseudoscalar , vector , and scalar exchanges .",
    "we also address the role of spin - orbit forces in more detail .",
    "spin - orbit forces can stem from both the confinement and the hyperfine interactions . from phenomenology",
    ", however , one expects their net effect to be small in baryon spectroscopy .",
    "the more this should be true for quadratic spin - orbit forces .",
    "therefore , in cqms it is often assumed that spin - orbit as well as quadratic spin - orbit forces can be left out .",
    "nevertheless , we study the influences of spin - orbit forces by considering two versions of the extended gbe cqm , one without and one with such type of interaction .",
    "this work is organized as follows : in section [ sec : ps_gbe_cqm ] we shortly recapitulate the properties of the pseudoscalar gbe cqm of ref .",
    "@xcite , which is restricted to spin - spin forces of pseudoscalar exchange only . in section [ sec : multiple_gbe ] we discuss the idea of multiple gbe and its effective description .",
    "the formulation of the extended gbe cqm is presented in section [ sec : extended_gbe ] . in section [ sec : parameterization ] we give the parameterizations of the two versions of the extended gbe cqm constructed here .",
    "the resulting spectra of all the light and strange baryons are presented in section [ sec : results ] .",
    "we close with a discussion of the obtained results and an outlook to possible applications and tests of the new type of gbe cqm in low - energy hadronic physics .",
    "in ref . @xcite one constructed a cqm relying on the hamiltonian @xmath4 , \\label{ps_ham}\\ ] ] where @xmath5 are the three - momenta of the constituent quarks and @xmath6 are their masses .",
    "the confinement potential @xmath7 was chosen to be of a linear form , and the hyperfine potential @xmath8 consisted of the spin - spin components of the pseudoscalar meson exchange ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ ps_ham ] ) corresponds to an invariant ( interacting ) mass operator @xmath10 in relativistic quantum mechanics and it lends itself to covariant calculations not only of the energy spectra but also of further hadronic reactions .",
    "the spectra and wave functions of the light and strange baryons were obtained by solving the eigenvalue problem of the above hamiltonian ( or equivalently of the mass operator @xmath10 ) via the stochastic variational method ( svm ) @xcite .",
    "this approach provides a very reliable determination of the eigenenergies and eigenstates .",
    "the accuracy of the method was checked before by solving the problem of a relativistic three - quark system via ( modified ) faddeev equations @xcite .",
    "the spectra for the light and strange baryons resulting from the pseudoscalar gbe cqm are shown in figure [ fig : ps_gbe ] .",
    "as is immediately evident , quite a satisfactory description of the spectroscopy of all light and strange baryons can be achieved already with this kind of gbe cqm .",
    "especially , the orderings of the energy levels according to their parities are obtained in agreement with experiment . in the spectrum of the nucleon , the roper resonance @xmath2(1440 ) with @xmath11",
    "comes out as the lowest excitation above the nucleon ground state .",
    "it is followed by the @xmath12 doublet @xmath2(1535)@xmath2(1520 ) . in the spectra of the @xmath0 and the @xmath13",
    "the @xmath14 resonances @xmath15 and @xmath16 fall below the resonances with negative parity @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 .",
    "in addition , the two @xmath20 states @xmath21@xmath22 remain the lowest excitations above the ground state .",
    "this behavior rests on the explicit flavor dependence of the gbe cqm and is governed by the particular spin - flavor symmetry coming with gbe .    with the specific type of hyperfine interaction deriving from gbe the intricate problem of the correct ordering of the low - lying excitations of the light and strange baryons",
    "is thus readily resolved .",
    "however , there remain some other problems .",
    "most strikingly the @xmath23 resonance remains far from the experimental value .",
    "furthermore , some states in the bands of higher excitations in the @xmath2 ( as well as the @xmath0 ) spectrum do not fit the experimental data ; especially the near degeneracies of the @xmath24 and similarly of the @xmath25 and @xmath26 @xmath2 resonances at about 1700 mev are not reproduced .",
    "in this situation an obvious question was if further improvements of the description of the light and strange baryon spectra could be obtained by an extension of the pseudoscalar gbe cqm to including further force components .",
    "wagenbrunn et al .",
    "made first attempts to extend the gbe cqm and proceeded to study the influences of the tensor forces from pseudoscalar gbe @xcite .",
    "however , with these tensor forces alone no improvement could be achieved , because the remarkably small splittings in the various multiplets of alike total - angular - momentum states could not be reproduced as observed in experiment . from phenomenology one",
    "expects the total tensor - force effects to be small .",
    "therefore one went ahead to include also vector- and scalar - type exchanges in addition to the pseudoscalar one @xcite .",
    "the spin - orbit forces , however , had then not yet been taken into account in the parametrization of an extended gbe cqm @xcite .",
    "in the pseudoscalar gbe cqm a reasonable description of the light and strange baryon spectra is achieved only if the hyperfine interaction is based solely on the spin - spin part .",
    "if the tensor forces are included ( with a strength as prescribed by unique octet and singlet pseudoscalar coupling constants , with values @xmath27 and @xmath28 , respectively , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , one can no longer keep certain splittings small , as demanded by phenomenology .",
    "this is true especially for the @xmath20 resonances at around 1510 mev as well as the @xmath29 resonances at around 1650 mev .",
    "the behavior is demonstrated in figure [ lsmulti ] , where in panel b the effects of the tensor forces due to pseudoscalar meson exchange are demonstrated ; obviously the generated splittings are too large especially in the second band .    in the picture of gbe dynamics",
    "there is also the possibility of multiple - boson exchanges , in addition to the single - boson exchange prevailing in the ansatz of pseudoscalar coupling @xcite .",
    "one may take the effects of such multiple - boson exchanges into account by foreseeing single - boson exchanges of scalar and vector type , just as in the meson - exchange model of the nucleon - nucleon interaction @xcite .",
    "for example , the effects of two - pion exchanges can effectively be described by @xmath30-meson exchange ( @xmath31 s - wave ) and by @xmath32-meson exchange ( @xmath31 p - wave ) , the effects of three - pion exchanges by @xmath33-meson exchange , and so forth .",
    "one may assume that an analogous approach works in the case of goldstone - boson - exchange dynamics between constituent quarks .",
    "motivated by the discussion above we constructed our extended version of the gbe cqm . for this purpose we considered pseudoscalar , vector , and scalar meson exchanges , as well as all relevant force components ( i.e. central , spin - spin , tensor , and spin - orbit forces ) .",
    "the hamiltonian of the extended gbe cqm has the following form @xmath4 . \\label{ext_ham}\\ ] ] again @xmath5 are the three - momenta and @xmath6 are the masses of the constituent quarks .",
    "@xmath34 is the confinement potential and @xmath35 denotes the hyperfine interaction between quark @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "it is now taken to be the sum of the pseudoscalar ( ps ) , vector ( v ) , and scalar ( s ) meson exchange potentials , @xmath38\\lambda^a_i\\cdot \\lambda^a_j+\\nonumber\\\\ & + & \\sum^7_{a=4}\\left[v_{k}(i , j)+v_{k^*}(i , j)+v_{\\kappa}(i , j)\\right]\\lambda^a_i\\cdot \\lambda^a_j+\\nonumber\\\\ & + & \\left[v_{\\eta}(i , j)+v_{\\omega_8}(i , j)+v_{f_0}(i , j)\\right]\\lambda^8_i\\cdot\\lambda^8_j+ \\nonumber\\\\ & + & \\frac{2}{3}\\left[v_{\\eta'}(i , j)+v_{\\omega_0}(i , j)+v_{\\sigma}(i , j)\\right ] , % + \\nonumber\\\\[4pt ] % & & \\right ] \\label{fullpot}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath39 denote the gell - mann flavor matrices .",
    "subsequently we shall give the explicit expressions for the phenomenological confinement potential as well as for the spatial parts of the different meson - exchange potentials using the following form factor for the constituent quark - meson vertex @xcite @xmath40 here , @xmath41 is the three - momentum of the exchanged meson @xmath42 , @xmath43 its mass , and @xmath44 the corresponding cut - off parameter . for mesons with different masses",
    "these cut - off parameters may be different .",
    "their values should be bigger for mesons with larger masses .      for the confinement interaction",
    "we assume a linear potential dependent on the distance @xmath45 between constituent quarks @xmath36 and @xmath37 @xmath46 the strength @xmath47 is treated as a fit parameter but it turns out to be of a magnitude roughly corresponding to the string tension of qcd .",
    "the constant @xmath48 is needed to fix the ground - state energy of the spectrum , i.e. the nucleon , to its phenomenological value of 939 mev .    according to lattice qcd calculations",
    "@xcite one would expect an additional ( short - range ) coulomb term of the form @xmath49 ( with strength @xmath50 ) in the confinement potential .",
    "our studies , however , have revealed that such a term can effectively be absorbed into the remaining potential parts . in particular , its effect can be compensated by a slight adjustment of the linear term @xmath51 and a small variation of the cut - off parameter @xmath52 in the scalar exchange potential @xcite .",

    ", one observes that the correct level ordering of positive- and negative - parity excitations is achieved in a satisfactory manner ; the roper resonance @xmath139 lies well below the first negative - parity resonance @xmath140 .",
    "in addition , the level splittings within the experimentally almost degenerate multiplets remain generally small . in this respect",
    "the extended gbe cqm resembles the spectral properties of the pseudoscalar gbe cqm with spin - spin hyperfine interactions only ( cf . figure [ fig : ps_gbe ] ) .",
    "however , for the present version of the extended gbe cqm ( without spin - orbit forces ) , one also observes deficiencies with regard to the @xmath141 and @xmath142 states ; their practical degeneracy observed in experiment is not brought about .",
    "we require explicit spin - orbit forces in order to improve these levels ( see the next subsection ) .",
    "the strange baryons are reproduced reasonably well at least with respect to the ground states and some 4-star resonances . like other cqms , also the gbe cqm has difficulties in reproducing the @xmath0 spectrum .",
    "while the level ordering of positive- and negative - parity states is in principle correct ( namely , opposite to the @xmath2 spectrum ) , the @xmath23 is missed by far .",
    "obviously , this state can not be described as a pure @xmath143 state .",
    "it is strongly influenced by the nearby @xmath144-@xmath2 decay threshold .",
    "a similar effect might still influence the @xmath145 ; it is predicted too high by about 60 mev .    in the pdg listings",
    "one finds a @xmath146 resonance with 3-star status , however , with uncertain @xmath138 .",
    "it is therefore not shown in our figures .",
    "we find no theoretical level that could match such a state in the relevant energy region .",
    "the next excitations beyond the decuplet ground state @xmath147 lie close to 1800 mev . here",
    ", one could also think about an influence of the @xmath144-@xmath13 threshold .",
    "for instance , for the lowest @xmath148 a similar effect as for the @xmath149 could occur and it could relate to the @xmath1 resonance experimentally seen at an energy around 1690 mev .",
    "the spectra of the extended gbe cqm with spin - orbit forces ( see subsection [ subsec : with_ls ] ) are shown in figure [ fig : ext_gbe_ls ] .",
    "in general , the spectral properties of this version are similar to the previous one but the almost degenerate levels @xmath141 and @xmath142 in the @xmath2 spectrum as well as the @xmath150 and @xmath151 in the @xmath0 spectrum are now improved .",
    "the same is true for the @xmath152 and @xmath153 .",
    "the splitting of the @xmath154 and @xmath155 gets reduced .",
    "these achievements are due to the additional spin - orbit forces .",
    "such a behavior is not obtained in neither one of the other versions of the gbe cqm ( cf .",
    "figures [ fig : ps_gbe ] and [ fig : ext_gbe_nols ] ) .",
    "the gbe cqm by the graz group @xcite so far relied on the spin - spin part of the pseudoscalar meson exchange only . here , we have studied further possibilities offered by gbe dynamics for the hyperfine interaction of constituent quarks in light and strange baryons . in particular , we have taken into account the effects of multiple goldstone - boson exchange through the exchanges of vector and scalar mesons in addition to the pseudoscalar ones .",
    "all relevant force components have been considered .",
    "we have presented two versions of the extended gbe cqm , one without and one with spin - orbit forces .",
    "the relativistic quark - model hamiltonian involves only a handful of open parameters .",
    "the hyperfine interaction needs five fit parameters in the case without spin - orbit forces and six in the case with spin - orbit forces ; the confinement interaction is always the same , namely , a linear potential whose strength is congruent with the one deduced from lattice qcd calculations . in both cases a reasonable description of the excitation spectra of all light and strange baryons can be achieved .",
    "the two versions differ in the quality of reproducing higher - lying resonance levels .",
    "the almost degeneracy of the @xmath141 and @xmath142 levels in the @xmath2 spectrum as well as the @xmath156 and @xmath157 levels in the @xmath0 spectrum can only be obtained in the case when spin - orbit forces are included . at the same time the description of the @xmath152 and @xmath153 splitting is also improved .",
    "the gbe dynamics is now comprehensively included in the quark - model hamiltonian for baryons .",
    "this hamiltonian is equivalent to a covariant mass operator to be used in further studies within relativistic ( i.e. poincar - invariant ) quantum mechanics .",
    "its eigenstates are readily obtained in the rest frame of any baryon .",
    "they can be boosted to an arbitrary reference frame in either one of the possible forms of relativistic quantum mechanics ( instant , front , point forms etc . ) .",
    "most economically ( and accurately ) this can be done in point form , where the lorentz transformations remain interaction - free .",
    "it will be most interesting to repeat the investigations of baryon reactions so far done with the pseudoscalar version of the gbe cqm , in particular , the calculations of the nucleon electroweak structure @xcite and of the mesonic decays of the baryon resonances @xcite .",
    "one may expect new insights into the properties of the corresponding observables once all force components ( especially the tensor and spin - orbit forces ) are included .",
    "of course , the extended versions of the gbe cqm are now also better amenable to further studies , such as the @xmath2-@xmath2 interaction ( cf . ,",
    "e.g. , the works by bartz and stancu @xcite ) .",
    "the different force components needed in these respects are directly brought about by the present gbe cqms ."
