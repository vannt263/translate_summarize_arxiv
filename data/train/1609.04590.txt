    "the observation of the discovered higgs boson @xmath5 with decaying into a pair of tau leptons  @xcite provided more evidence for the existence of at least one @xmath6 doublet scalar field in addition to various other measurements of the properties of @xmath5 at the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "then , the natural question is `` how many doublet fields are there in the higgs sector ? '' in general , multi - higgs doublet models ( mhdms ) can reproduce the predictions of the standard model ( sm ) composed of only one higgs doublet , and so we should take into account the possibility of the existence of multi - doublets .    on the other hand ,",
    "multi - doublet fields arise in many models beyond the sm . as the most familiar example , in the minimal supersymmetric sm ( mssm ) the higgs sector is extended to have two doublets because of the requirement of gauge anomaly cancellation .",
    "in addition , the multi - doublet structure is required to have an additional source of cp - violation , which is necessary to realize the successful scenario of electroweak baryogenesis  @xcite . moreover ,",
    "additional doublets are often introduced in various loop - induced neutrino mass models , such as the model by zee  @xcite and by ma  @xcite etc .",
    "the point is that the structure of mhdms depends on new physics scenarios , e.g. , in the mssm the so - called type - ii yukawa interaction is adopted .",
    "therefore , by studying the phenomenology of mhdms with a bottom - up approach , we can narrow down the possible scenarios of new physics beyond the sm .",
    "one of the most important issues when mhdms are discussed is the possibility of flavour changing neutral currents ( fcncs ) mediated by neutral higgs bosons , which appear at the tree level in general .",
    "the simplest way to avoid such fcncs is to realize a yukawa lagrangian where each type of fermion , i.e. , charged leptons , up - type and down - type quarks couples to only one scalar doublet field .",
    "this is usually achieved by imposing discrete symmetries in the higgs sector , and is so - called `` natural flavour conservation '' ( nfc )  @xcite .",
    "depending on how doublet fields couple to each type of fermions , there are four ( five ) independent types of yukawa interactions in models with two ( more than two ) doublets  @xcite .    in this paper , we discuss the deviation in the couplings of @xmath5 to weak bosons ( @xmath3 and @xmath7 ) and fermions @xmath8 from the sm prediction in the mhdms with nfc . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it has been clarified that the four types of yukawa interactions in two higgs doublet models ( 2hdms ) can be determined by measuring the correlation between the deviations in the charged lepton yukawa couplings @xmath9 and the down - type quark yukawa couplings @xmath10 as long as there is a non - zero deviation in the @xmath3 couplings .",
    "now , we extend this discussion to models with @xmath11 higgs doublet fields , and we investigate how the pattern of the deviation can be different in 2hdms and in mhdms with @xmath12 .    this paper is organized as follow . in sec .",
    "ii , we define the mhdms with nfc .",
    "we then give the general expressions for the @xmath3 and @xmath13 couplings .",
    "we show more explicit forms of these couplings in the 2hdms and the three higgs doublet models ( 3hdms ) as simple examples . in sec .",
    "iii , we give numerical results of the deviation in the couplings of @xmath5 especially for the @xmath1 and @xmath2 couplings in the 2hdms and the 3hdms .",

    "let us move on to the construction of the kinetic term and the yukawa lagrangian for the scalar doublets in the higgs basis . without loss of generality , the kinetic term is expressed as follows : @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the covariant derivative for the doublet higgs fields . from the above lagrangian",
    ", the gauge - gauge - scalar type interaction is obtained from the first term , because only @xmath27 contains the vev @xmath21 .",

    "( [ kappaf2 ] ) tells us the following important fact .",
    "as long as @xmath111 , the sign of @xmath112 is determined by the sign of @xmath113 . in this case , the prediction of @xmath114 in the four types of yukawa interactions appears in the four different quadrant on the @xmath115@xmath116 plane for a fixed @xmath100 which can be determined by measuring the sign of @xmath117 .",

    "although this statement is valid for the case with @xmath124 for all @xmath125 as mentioned above , the case with at least one of @xmath126 being smaller than @xmath127 is phenomenologically quite difficult to realize in the type - ii , -x and -y 2hdm , which is explained following . in order to achieve , the condition @xmath128 is satisfied unless we take @xmath129 which is disfavored by the various @xmath130 physics constraints mainly due to the enhancement of the top yukawa coupling .",

    "@xmath131 , we need a rather large value of @xmath99 if @xmath132 . for example , when @xmath133 is given to be @xmath134 , @xmath99 should be larger than about 6 ( 14 ) to satisfy @xmath135 .",
    "the important point is that such a case gives a huge deviation in some of yukawa couplings in the type - ii , -x , and -y 2hdm .",

    ", title=\"fig:\",width=264 ]    finally , we show the prediction in the type - z 3hdm on the @xmath164 and @xmath165 plane .",
    "the left and right panel show the case for @xmath199 and @xmath200 , respectively .",
    "we can see that the predictions with @xmath201 ( @xmath202 ) and @xmath203 are allowed for the case of @xmath204 ( @xmath205 ) , which are not allowed in the 2hdms at the tree level .",
    "even if we take into account the one - loop corrections to the yukawa coupling , only a few percent level of the difference between @xmath164 and @xmath165 is allowed as we see in fig .",
    "therefore , if the higgs boson couplings are measured to be in this region , i.e. , @xmath201 ( @xmath202 ) and @xmath203 , it can be evidence for the mhdms with @xmath12 .",
    "we have studied the sm - like higgs boson couplings with weak bosons @xmath3 and fermions @xmath13 in mhdms with nfc . we have presented the generic expression for the scaling factors of @xmath75 and @xmath70 in the model with @xmath11 doublet scalar fields . as simple concrete examples",
    ", we have discussed the 2hdms and the 3hdms , and have presented the formulae of these scaling factors in terms of the ratios of the higgs vevs and the matrix elements of the diagonalization matrix for the cp - even scalar states for each type of yukawa interaction .",
    "we then have shown the correlation between @xmath164 and @xmath165 in the 2hdms and in the 3hdms under the assumption that the @xmath3 couplings deviate from the sm prediction by 1% .",
    "it has been clarified that there are predictions in the @xmath164 and @xmath165 plane in the 3hdms , which can not be explained in the 2hdms even when taking into account the one - loop corrections to the yukawa coupling .",
    "we would like to mention that such a region can also be explained within a 2hdm if we relax the framework of nfc such as the so - called type - iii 2hdm .",
    "however , in such a model fcncs mediated by neutral higgs bosons are naturally induced , so that measurements at flavour experiments also become important to discriminate the models with nfc and those without nfc .    finally , we briefly comment on the case with cp - violation in the higgs sector which is assumed not being occurred in this paper . if there is a non - zero physical cp - violating phase in the higgs potential , cp - even and cp - odd component scalar fields",
    "are mixed with each other . through the mixing",
    ", the yukawa coupling for the sm - like higgs boson contains a term proportional to the @xmath206 matrix , which can modify various physical quantities such as decay rates and cross sections of the sm - like higgs boson from the sm prediction even if @xmath207 is taken .",
    "the collider phenomenology with such a cp - violating effect has been studied in refs .",
    "@xcite in the 2hdms .",
    "in addition , the method to extract the cp - even component ( without @xmath206 ) and the cp - odd component ( with @xmath206 ) of the @xmath208 coupling has been proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite by measuring the @xmath208 cross section weighted by an operator constructed from the ( anti-)top quark momentum .",
