    "_ iso _ , together with cobe and scuba , has shown convincingly that dusty star formation plays a key role in the early universe .",
    "isocam has identified a significant population of dusty active starburst galaxies , the ultraluminous infrared ( ir ) galaxies ( ulirg ) , at @xmath8 , which account respectively for @xmath930% and @xmath7 10% of the far - ir ( fir ) and submm backgrounds @xcite , which in turn account for half of the total extragalactic background .",
    "submm observations ( e.g. , scuba , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) suggest that the remaining fractions are also due to ulirgs , but at higher redshifts ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "that dust plays such an important role in the high - redshift universe may appear surprising , as it is usually thought that in the early stages of galaxy formation , when the gas is still relatively metal - free , dust was virtually absent .",
    "this assumption however has been challenged by mid - ir ( mir ) observations of one of the most metal - poor star - forming galaxies known , sbs0335@xmath11052e   @xcite . in this local blue compact dwarf galaxy ( bcd ) at a distance of 54 mpc and with a nebular heavy element abundance of only 12@xmath0log(o / h)=7.3 , a large amount of dust ( .5ex@xmath12 ) hides most ( @xmath7 75% ) of the current star - forming activity from view @xcite .",
    "thus , to interpret the spectra of high - redshift galaxies , it is crucial to understand how and when this ubiquitous dust component is formed and how it affects the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of galaxies by redistributing the ultraviolet - optical energy radiated by the young stars in the star - forming regions to mir and fir wavelengths .",
    "such an understanding is needed if we are to use these seds to derive photometric redshifts and the star formation rate as a function of cosmic epoch .",
    "indeed , the optical - radio seds of seven nearby bcds show several significant deviations from the standard templates of the evolved and massive starbursts ( e.g. , m82 and arp220 ) frequently used to derive photometric redshifts of submm / mm sources @xcite .",
    "first , the location of the infrared bump implies generally warmer dust temperatures , with sbs0335@xmath11052e  being the most extreme case of short - wavelength turnover @xcite .",
    "second , the mid - ir spectra of bcds show very weak or no aromatic features in emission ( e.g. , pahs ) , in contrast to the strong pah features seen in the spectra of normal starburst galaxies ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "there is evidence that these characteristics may be more common at high redshift ; the seds of distant scuba / vla sources tend to be better fit with the seds of highly extinguished star clusters ( as in the bcd iizw40 ) than with those of m82 and arp220 @xcite .",
    "here we present data from our _ spitzer _  cycle 1 program which include spectroscopic , photometric and imaging observations of more than 20 bcds with metallicities ranging from 1/30 to 1/4 that of the sun .",
    "besides studying the seds of bcds in the infrared , we also wish to investigate star formation in metal - poor environments and how star formation parameters and dust properties change as a function of metallicity . while much progress has been made in finding large populations of galaxies at high redshifts ( @xmath13 * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , truly young galaxies in the process of forming remain elusive in the distant universe .",
    "the spectra of those far - away galaxies generally indicate the presence of a substantial amount of heavy elements , indicating previous star formation and metal enrichment . in the hierarchical picture of galaxy formation , large galaxies are formed from the assembly of small ones .",
    "therefore , because of their low mass and chemically unenriched interstellar medium ( ism ) , bcds are possibly the closest examples we can find of the elementary units from which galaxies formed .",
    "their relative proximity allows studies of their dust content with a sensitivity , spectral and spatial resolution that faint distant high - redshift galaxies do not permit .    in this first paper of a series",
    ", we discuss the most metal - rich object in our sample , haro3  = ngc3353 = mrk 35 .",
    "haro3  has a heliocentric radial velocity of 969 km s@xmath14 @xcite which gives a distance of 16.3 mpc , adopting a hubble constant of 70 km s@xmath14 mpc@xmath14 and correcting for the virgocentric flow .",
    "the present distance is about 25% larger than the old distance of 13.1 mpc used by previous investigators who did not correct for virgocentric flow .",
    "the blue apparent magnitude is of haro3  is 13.2 ( rc3 ) , which corresponds to a blue absolute magnitude of @xmath15 .    with its known population of wolf - rayet stars @xcite , haro3  is an ideal object for studying star formation in its relatively early stages .",
    "optical @xmath16 band observations by @xcite show that haro3  hosts several star - forming regions . in order of decreasing brightness",
    ", there is first an off - center very blue star - forming region ( a : we adopt here the nomenclature of @xcite ) ; a nuclear emission region ( b ) ; two faint star - forming knots ( c ) associated with the tidal tail which extends to the south - west of the galaxy ; and one or more faint knots to the south ( d ) .",
    "these star - forming regions are labeled in the 4.5  irac image of haro3(to be discussed later ) in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : irac ] .",
    "near - ir ( nir ) and high - resolution vla radio observations by @xcite demonstrate that the current star formation in haro3  is most active in region a , with a star formation rate of @xmath7 0.6 m@xmath3 yr@xmath14 and a total mass of young stars of @xmath7 10@xmath4 m@xmath3 within a region of @xmath17 0.1 kpc radius .",
    "region a is also the youngest star - forming region in haro3 , with clusters of ages @xmath6 5 myr .",
    "while the balmer decrement yields an extinction a@xmath5  = 0.5 mag , @xcite found that the br@xmath18 and radio fluxes imply a larger extinction in region a , a@xmath5@xmath19 8 .",
    "as for the clusters in region b , they are slightly older , with ages @xmath7 810 myr @xcite .",
    "high - resolution _",
    "f606w imaging of haro3  by @xcite shows that regions a and b are separated by a conspicuous dust lane .",
    "the various star - forming regions are superimposed on an underlying low - surface - brightness component with somewhat irregular contours , so that haro3  is of type ii in the bcd morphological classification of @xcite .",
    "its redder color suggests that it is composed of older stars made in previous episodes of star formation . a tidal tail to the south - west is clearly seen in the _ hst _  image of @xcite , suggesting that some of the present star formation may have been triggered by a merger with another dwarf galaxy or hi  cloud .",
    "@xcite proposed that the hi  properties of haro3may be suggestive of a small - scale interaction , although higher resolution hi  imaging would be necessary to confirm this .",
    "spectroscopy of region a by @xcite and @xcite gives oxygen abundances of 12@xmath0log(o / h)=8.30@xmath200.01 and 8.34@xmath200.01 respectively , in good agreement with the value 12@xmath0log(o / h)=8.37@xmath200.06 obtained earlier by @xcite .",
    "if we adopt 12@xmath0log(o / h)=8.32 and a solar oxygen abundance of 12@xmath0log(o / h)=8.91 @xcite , haro3  would have a metallicity of about 1/4 that of the sun .",
    "if , instead , we adopt the new solar calibration of @xcite with 12@xmath0log(o / h)=8.65 , then haro3  would have a metallicity of 1/2 solar .",
    "we describe our new spitzer observations and their reduction in section [ sec : data ] . in section [ sec : spectra ] , we present the spectroscopic results , and discuss the pah features and the ir fine - structure lines .",
    "we also compare the observed ir emission - line intensities with those predicted by a cloudy @xcite photoionization model based on the observed optical emission line fluxes .",

    "thuan ) , we have observed haro3  with irs @xcite in the low- and high - resolution modules ( sl , sh , lh ) ; with irac @xcite at 4.5 and 8 ; and with mips @xcite at 24 , 70 , and 160 . the data were acquired over a period of several months on 17 nov 2004 ( irs ) , 23 nov 2004 ( irac ) , and 3 apr 2005 ( mips ) . for all instruments , we started the data reduction with images processed by the _",
    "spitzer _  science center ( ssc ) pipeline , i.e. the basic calibrated data ( _ bcd _ ) and the corresponding masks ( the dce masks ) .",
    "the masks flag potential spurious features in the images , such as strong radiation hits , saturated pixels , or nonexistent / corrupted data .",
    "spectroscopy was performed in staring mode with the short low module in both orders ( sl1 , sl2 ) and with both short and long high - resolution modules ( sh , lh ) @xcite .",
    "these give low - resolution spectra from 5.2 to 14.5  ( r@xmath2164 - 128 ) , and high - resolution spectra from 9.6 to 37.2  ( r@xmath21600 ) .",
    "we obtained 30s@xmath14 cycles for sh , 14s@xmath18 for lh , 6s@xmath13 for sl1 , and 6s@xmath16 for sl2 .",
    "sources were centered in the slits by peaking up and offsetting from 2mass stars .",
    "figure [ fig : slits ] shows the positions of the three different slits across haro3 ; in the left panel , the slits are superimposed on the _",
    "hst_/wfpc2 f606w image @xcite and in the right panel on the @xmath22  image of @xcite .",
    "it can be seen that all three slits include region a.    it is necessary to accurately subtract the background before spectrum extraction . because of the dominance of the background signal , the accuracy of this process strongly influences the quality of the final spectrum .",
    "we started the spectral reduction with the individual _ bcd _ frames processed by the s11.0.2 version of the ssc pipeline , which provides ramp fitting , dark current subtraction , droop and linearity corrections , flat - fielding , and wavelength and flux calibrations .",
    "however , the pipeline does not include background subtraction .",
    "hence , for the low - resolution spectra , we constructed a coadded background frame from the _ bcd _ observations with the source in the opposing nod and off - order positions ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . when the source is in sl1 , the sl2 slit samples background , and vice versa .",
    "this makes it possible to include the off - order frames in the background image since the same on - chip integration times were used for both sl orders .",
    "the image for the source at a given nod position was constructed by coadding all frames at that position .",
    "coadding was performed with the sigma - clipping option of the _ imcombine _ task in iraf .",
    "the inclusion of off - order and off - nod frames in the background image means that the integration time on the background is three times that on the source , which improves the signal - to - noise of the two - dimensional ( 2d ) subtraction .    for the high - resolution sh and lh spectra , a 2d background image",
    "could not be constructed because of the small size of the slit .",
    "therefore we subtracted the background from the sh and lh observations using the one - dimensional ( 1d ) spectra as described below .",
    "the sh and lh 2d _ bcd _ images were coadded as for the sl modules , and successive corrections for sporadic bad pixels and cosmic ray hits were carried out manually by inspection of the images at the separate nod positions .",
    "we extracted the source spectra with _ spice _",
    ", the post - pipeline irs package furnished by the ssc . to maximize the calibration accuracy , the automatic point - source extraction window was used for all modules .",
    "the automatic extraction uses a variable - width extraction window which scales with wavelength in order to recover a constant fraction of diffraction - limited instrument response . for the sl spectra , this gives a 4-pixel ( 72 ) length at 6 , and an 8-pixel one ( 144 ) at 12 ; the slit width is 36 for both sl modules . at high resolution ,",
    "the _ spice _  extraction is performed over the entire slit ( 47@xmath1113 sh ; 111@xmath1223 lh ) .",
    "orders were spliced together by averaging , ignoring the noisy regions at the red end of each order ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "then the individual spectra were box - car smoothed to a resolution element , and clipped in order to eliminate any remaining spikes in the high - resolution data .",
    "finally , the two spectra for each module ( one for each nod position ) were averaged .",
    "background was subtracted from the 1d sh spectra by minimizing the difference between the 2d background - subtracted sl and sh spectra over the substantial ( @xmath75 ) overlap in wavelength .",
    "we adopted the model of reach and coworkers for the spectral shape of the background , and the multiplicative constant was given by the minimization .",
    "the lh background was subtracted by minimizing the difference between the sh and lh spectra over their overlap region ( @xmath61 ) .    the final averaged irs spectra obtained in the short - wavelength low - resolution mode ( sl ) and in both short and long wavelength high - resolution modes ( sh , lh )",

    "we designed our irac astronomical observation requests ( aors ) to give four ( high - dynamic range1s . ] ) irac frames of 30s ; only channels 2 ( 4.5 ) and 4 ( 8.0 ) were acquired .",
    "small - scale dithering in a `` cycling '' pattern was performed with a total of 120s spent in each irac channel .",
    "the individual _ bcd _ frames were processed with the s11.0.1 version of the ssc pipeline ( see the irac data handbook ) .",
    "this processing is designed to remove the effects of dark current , detector nonlinearity , flat field , multiplexer bleeding , and cosmic rays , and to perform flux calibration . however , in some cases , those with particularly bright sources in the field - of - view , the pipeline is unsuccessful at removing all artefacts . in the case of haro3 ,",
    "the bright point - like source at the center of the galaxy resulted in a `` banding '' effect in the 8  image , i.e. in an artificially enhanced brightness level in the rows and columns containing that bright source ( see the irac data handbook ) .",
    "the 4.5  image was not affected by banding since it occurs only in the si : as arrays ( channels 3 and 4 )",
    ". dithering does not eliminate the effect because the position of the bands on the array remains unchanged relative to the galaxy .",
    "moreover , because the intensity of the brightness enhancement decreases with distance from the bright source , it is not straightforward to correct automatically .",
    "we eliminated the effect from each 8  frame by interpolating the feature across the affected rows , substituting the spurious pixel values with those of a typical background .",
    "the _ bcd _ frames ( corrected for `` banding '' effects in the case of the 8  ones ) were coadded using _",
    "mopex _ , the image mosaicing and source - extraction package provided by the ssc @xcite .",
    "pixels flagged by the dce masks and by the static bad - pixel masks ( pmasks ) were ignored .",
    "additional inconsistent pixel values were removed by means of the _ mopex _  outlier rejection algorithms .",
    "we relied on the dual - outlier technique , together with the multiframe algorithm , rather than using any spatial criteria for rejection .",
    "the frames were corrected for geometrical distortion and projected onto a `` fiducial '' ( refined ) coordinate system with pixel sizes of 120 , roughly equivalent to the original pixels .",
    "standard linear interpolation was used for the mosaics .",

    "our mips images were acquired in the fixed cluster - offset mode in all three channels , with offsets of 12  in two additional pointings .",
    "we used ramp times of 3s , 10s , and 10s for 24 , 70 , and 160 , respectively , with 1 , 2 , and 6 cycles in the three channels .",
    "this gave us a total of 32 frames at 24 , 56 frames at 70 , and 104 frames at 160 . because the first data frame of each observation sequence at 24  has a shorter exposure time ,",
    "we discarded those frames with keyword dcenum=0 ; we also removed the second frame ( dcenum=1 ) because of increased data artefacts ( see the mips data handbook ) ; this left us with 24 frames at 24 .",
    "the individual _ bcd _ frames were processed by the s11.4.0 version of the ssc pipeline , which converts the integration ramps inherent to the mips detectors into slopes , and remediates temporal variation of the slope images @xcite .",
    "the processing includes correcting for stimulator flashes on the mips - ge detectors , dark subtraction , flat - fielding , and flux calibration . as for the irac images , we processed the dithered _ bcd _ frames in the spatial domain with _ mopex_. the dce masks and the static masks were used to flag pixels , and subsequently ignore them .",
    "the _ mopex _",
    "outlier rejection was used to flag any additional spurious pixel values , with the dual - outlier and multiframe algorithm as for the irac frames .",
    "geometrical distortion was corrected before projecting the frames onto a fiducial coordinate system with pixel sizes of 120 for mips-24 , roughly half of the original pixel size of 25 .",
    "pixel sizes of the final mosaics at 70 and 160  are also approximately half of the originals , i.e. 495 at 70  and 80 at 160 .",
    "unlike the irac coadds , we incorporated the sigma - weighting algorithm because we found it gave less noisy mips mosaics than without .",

    "the width ( equal to the gaussian @xmath23 ) of these fits is @xmath2424 in both the irac and mips-24 images , which implies that , indeed , the source is quite extended at irac wavelengths , but more point - like at 24 .",
    "however , at 24 , the diffraction limit is @xmath76 , implying that the gaussian fit is too narrow ; moreover the 24  flux resulting from this fit may be too low ( see @xmath25[sec : dust ] ) , because the fit does not account for the substantial flux in the first airy ring .",

    "examination of the irs spectra in fig .",
    "[ fig : irs ] shows that there are pah features clearly detected at 5.7 , 6.2 , 7.7 , 8.6 , 11.2 , 12.7 , and 16.4 .",
    "we have derived the flux and equivalent width ( ew ) of these features by fitting the sl and sh spectra with a series of lorentzian profiles of unknown width , amplitude , and central wavelength . because of their broad low - intensity wings , the pah features are better fit with lorentzian than with gaussian profiles .",
    "the fits were performed with the _ splot _ task in iraf .",
    "the continuum was linearly interpolated in two sections , one from 6 - 9 , and the other from 10.5 - 13.9 .",
    "the best - fit parameters , averaged over several independent estimates in both high and low resolution spectra , are given in table [ tab : pahs ] .",
    "the flux of the 12.7  pah feature is probably overestimated because of the difficulty in separating it from the bright [ neii ]   fine structure line ( see @xmath25[sec : lines ] ) .",
    "our derived values are in general agreement with those based on iso spectra @xcite .",
    "there is however a large difference in the slope of the continuum between the isophot and irs spectra .",
    "the isophot continuum is nearly flat while the irs one is continuously rising toward longer wavelengths ( fig .",
    "[ fig : irs ] ) .",
    "we interpret this continuum slope difference as due to the fact that different regions in haro3  are sampled by isophot and irs , as a result of the different apertures in the two instruments .",
    "the iso pht - s beam is @xmath27(@xmath7 2kpc ) , considerably larger than the irs apertures . for the latter ,",
    "the slit width is 36 for both sl modules , while it is 47@xmath1113 for the sh module and 111@xmath1223 for the lh module .",
    "this means that , while the irs apertures include mainly radiation from the star - forming region a , the iso aperture encompasses a large part of the interstellar medium ( ism ) around region a. so the spectrally flat pah emission seen by isophot comes from the general extended ism in haro3  while the strong rising mir continuum emission seen by irs is related to the more compact star - forming region a.    the relative strengths of the three main pah emission features can be used as diagnostics to identify pah sizes and infer the neutral - to - ionized gas ratio @xcite .",
    "according to the models of @xcite and the observed flux ratios of the @xmath28 and @xmath29 features , the pahs in haro3  are predominantly neutral and small , containing a few hundred carbon atoms , similar to the normal galaxies studied by @xcite .",
    "in other words , haro3  lies in the `` normal galaxy '' region in the pah diagnostic diagram rather than in the starburst galaxy region which includes objects such as m82 and ngc253 , that are dominated by ionized pahs .",
    "this again supports our previous contention that the pahs in haro3  arise mainly from the normal ism around the star - forming region , not only from knot a itself .    on the other hand , the pah ews are generally high , @xmath30 for the 7.7  line , more typical of starburst galaxies @xcite than of bcds @xcite .",
    "this result may not be surprising as haro3  with m@xmath31=@xmath15 is at the bright end of the luminosity function of dwarf galaxies , but it contrasts with the flux ratio trends described above .",
    "overall , haro3  follows the metallicity trends of increasing pah ew with increasing oxygen abundance reported by @xcite and discussed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "however , for its metallicity , the ews of the ionized pahs in haro3  exceed by @xmath750% to up to almost a factor of three that of most extreme bcd in the @xcite sample .",
    "in contrast , the neutral pah at 11.2has an ew of 0.6 , typical of other bcds .    finally , we find that the pah emission features in haro3  are narrow , narrower than many of the objects tabulated by @xcite .",
    "the only objects which possess pah features with smaller widths at 7.7  are the small magellanic cloud , the reflection nebulae / photodissociation region ngc7023 , and 30doradus in the large magellanic cloud . m82 and",
    "ngc253 have slightly broader pah features than these objects or haro3 , but the difference may not be significant .",
    "however , different pah features tend to have systematically different fwhms @xcite , so that to make a more definitive statement , we must wait for more data and a more uniform method of measuring pah parameters ( e.g. , _ pahfit _ : * ? ? ?",
    "perhaps not surprisingly , haro3 s pah features are also narrower than those predicted by the model for the diffuse galactic ism at high latitudes @xcite .",
    "we have tried to subtract a scaled version of the model spectrum from the observed spectrum of haro3 , but because of the narrowness of the features and their lower equivalent widths ( because of the rising continuum ) , the scaled subtraction leaves significant residuals . we conclude that there are many factors behind the appearance of pah features ( e.g. , chemical abundance , ism energetics , etc . ) .",
    "thus even though our irs spectrum may contain a conspicuous ism component , galactic ism spectra may not be a good template for all ism pah emission .",

    "we have also measured the fraction of the @xmath22  emission in the @xcite image which falls in the irs slits ( see right panel of fig.[fig : slits ] ) . because of the orientation of the slits and their different sizes , roughly 36% of the total @xmath22  emission lies within the sl slit ; @xmath4825% within the sh slit ; and @xmath4880% within lh .",

    "the discrepancy between the observed and predicted intensity ratios of the two weakest lines , [ neii]@xmath3236.01 @xmath45 m and [ neii]@xmath3212.81 @xmath45 m , are larger than for the others . in part , this discrepancy could be explained by the observational errors , at least in the case of the weakest [ neiii]@xmath3236.01 @xmath45 m emission line .",

    "in particular , the irac emission peaks on region a , coincident with the strong compact radio source seen by @xcite , the site of the most active star - forming region in haro3 .",
    "emission in the irac bands is the sum of three different components : 1 ) the stellar photospheres , 2 ) the hot dust continuum , and 3 ) the pahs . because of the usual dominance of the pahs in mir spectra of star - forming galaxies ( see the haro3  mir spectrum in fig .",
    "[ fig : irs ] ) , the 8  irac channel is commonly used as a `` pah indicator '' @xcite .",
    "the 4.5/8.0 flux ratio is thus a potentially important diagnostic for characterizing the ism properties at short wavelengths : high 4.5/8.0 ratios would indicate predominantly stellar light , whereas low ratios would point to a relatively large pah contribution .",
    "an irac 4.5/8.0 color image was created from the two irac 4.5 and 8   mosaics by first subtracting the background measured in empty regions in each mosaic , then aligning the two mosaics by cross correlation , and finally dividing one by the other .",

    "[ fig : iracoverlay ] shows that the 4.5/8 flux ratio varies by more than a factor of 10 over the galaxy , with peaks @xmath240.5 and troughs of @xmath60.1 .",
    "because the 4.5/8.0 color of stellar populations is @xmath49 , roughly independently of age and metallicity @xcite , it is clear the the color map of haro3  is dominated by the ism , and not by stars .",
    "the only source with 4.5/8.0 colors near the stellar value is knot d to the south of the nucleus ( there is no @xmath22   emission associated with this object ) .    if we interpret the 8  emission in the irac band in the `` standard '' way and attribute it primarily to pahs , the low 4.5/8 ratio @xmath260.1 around knots a and b ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : iracoverlay ] ) would imply a substantial pah contribution . indeed this interpretation is supported by the detection of strong pah features in the irs spectrum ( see @xmath25[sec : spectra ] ) . if all the changes in the 4.5/8 ratio over the galaxy were attributed only to changes in the pah emission , the higher ratio @xmath260.3 in the broad `` ridge '' to the southeast of the nucleus ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : iracoverlay ] ) would indicate that pahs should be _ three times less prominent _ there .",
    "it could be that the pahs are destroyed by the radiation fields in the star - forming regions associated with the intense circumnuclear @xmath22  visible in the right panel of fig . [",
    "fig : slits ] .      on the other hand ,",
    "the spatial variations in the 4.5/8 flux ratio could be associated with variations in the hot dust 4.5@xmath118  continuum .",
    "as pointed out by @xcite and others , variations in the 8  continuum can masquerade in broadband images as variations in the pah contribution . because in haro3  the pahs and continuum contribute roughly equally to the 8  filter",
    ", it is not unreasonable to think that the larger 4.5/8  ratios are due to a flatter continuum slope , i.e. a lower 8  continuum , in the general extended ism as compared to star - forming region a.    we can test this hypothesis by making irac / mips hybrid color images .",
    "since the irac 4.5  image traces stars and hot dust but not pah features , the irac 8  image mainly the dust continuum and pahs with a very small stellar contribution , and the mips 24  image the warm or hot dust continuum only , we should be able to use the irac / mips colors to distinguish between continuum and pah variations . since the spitzer diffraction limit is 111 at 4.5 , 198 at 8  ( see the irac data handbook ) , and",
    "@xmath76at 24 , comparison of the irac 4 and 8  images with the mips 24  image is only possible after some processing of the latter .",
    "the availability of an accurate prf makes possible a deconvolution for the mips-24 image , which we performed with the _ lucy _ task in the _ stsdas _ extension of _ iraf _ , using the _ mips24_prf_mosaic _ in the _ mopex _ distribution as the deconvolution kernel .",
    "prior to deconvolution , the mips image was linearly interpolated to the finer pixel scale of the prf .",
    "after deconvolution , the image was rebinned to the original scale of the mips24  mosaic ( see @xmath25[sec : mipsdata ] ) , designed to be the same as the irac scale .",
    "the original and deconvolved mips-24 images are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mips24 ] .",
    "just as we did for the irac color maps , background was first subtracted for the irac and mips images , then the images were aligned using a cross correlation technique , and finally the irac image was divided by the mips image .",
    "the 4/24  and 8/24  flux ratios obtained from the deconvolved 24  images are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : iracmips ] where the 4.5   image is superimposed in contours .",
    "there are several features of the hybrid irac / mips-24 color images in fig .",
    "[ fig : iracmips ] to be noticed .",
    "first , the high ratio of @xmath70.6 in source a in the 8/24 color map is much larger than the value inferred from the irs spectrum of @xmath70.06 .",
    "however the spectrum has not been deconvolved and is roughly diffraction limited at all wavelengths .",
    "this means that it encompasses a larger fraction of the extended source as wavelength increases . at @xmath78",
    "the spectrum encompasses a region of @xmath72  in size , while at 24  it encompasses a @xmath76  region .",
    "therefore , it is likely that the higher image value is closer to the true one for region a than the low value derived from the irs spectrum which is more typical of the general ism .",
    "indeed , the value of the 8/24 color averaged over a 40  square region is @xmath70.17 , consistent with the color derived from total fluxes . hence , we believe that the general structure of the hybrid irac / mips-24 color images is reliable .",
    "second , as mentioned before , there is a noticeable feature with a high 4.5/8 ratio ( @xmath260.3 ) tracing a broad ridge to the southeast of region a ( see the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : iracoverlay ] ) .",
    "our aim is to use the 24  map to trace the hot dust continuum , and compare it to the irac colors .",
    "the ridge feature is also present in the 4.5/24 and 8/24 color maps ( fig .",
    "[ fig : iracmips ] ) .",
    "however , because of its location , the feature in the 24  map ratios may be an artefact of the deconvolution procedure . to check its reality ,",
    "we have performed three tests .",
    "first , we have convolved the irac 8  image with the mips-24 prf and then divided the resulting image by the original 24  image .",
    "second , we have convolved the mips-24 deconvolved image with the irac 8  prf and divided by the original 8  image .",
    "third , we have divided the original 24  image by its prf .",
    "the results of the first and third tests are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mipsops ] . the second test",
    "is not shown : because of the small size of the irac prf , the color image obtained this way is virtually indistinguishable from the one made with the mips-24 deconvolved image .",
    "inspection of fig .",
    "[ fig : mipsops ] shows that the feature of interest in the 24  map coincides roughly with the airy wings of the mips-24 prf .",
    "thus the broad ridge in the 24  map ratios may not be a real feature ; this means that the 24  image can not be used to unequivocally validate either hypothesis for the red 4.5/8  ridge color .",
    "nevertheless , we can examine the relative colors of the ridge and the surrounding disk .",
    "first , the _ ridge _ in haro3  has a 4.5/8 flux ratio of @xmath50 , `` bluer '' than the surrounding _ disk _ with @xmath51 .",
    "if the change in color depends solely on the 8  band , then the ridge would have to have either 50% fewer pahs or 50% less hot dust at 8  than the disk .",
    "since we expect the disk to have less hot dust than any actively star - forming region , we must necessarily conclude that the `` ridge '' is deficit in pahs , not in the hot dust continuum .",
    "the pahs could have been destroyed because of proximity to the edge of the ionized gas shell ( see @xmath22  image in fig . [",
    "fig : slits ] ) , or by supernovae shocks and outflows perpendicular to the dust lane .",
    "the morphology of the 4/24 and 8/24 flux ratio maps as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : iracmips ] is complex ; both ratios vary by a factor of @xmath2430 over the galaxy , being greatest in and around knot c toward the southwest and knot d toward the southeast . because knot d has _",
    "r_-band emission , but no @xmath22  in the images by @xcite ,",
    "the reason for its high 4/24 and 8/24 ratios is unclear ; indeed we can not exclude that knot d be merely a foreground star . on the other hand , in knot c",
    ", we tentatively interpret these high ratios to be due to _ increased _ pah strength , or equivalently , _ decreased _ hot dust .",
    "first , the 4.5/8 flux ratio in knot c is half that in knots a and b , and the morphology in the color is clearly extended .",
    "second , both the 4.5/24 and 8/24 ratios are also lower in knot c. hence , we conclude that there is less hot dust emitting at 4.5  and 8  in knot c than in knots a and b , and possibly an 8  pah excess .    the difficulty of separating pah and continuum contributions in the broadband irac 8  filter is evident from the above discussion . in haro3 , with its conspicuous @xmath22  emission throughout the entire central region and across the dust lane , the ism changes from predominantly neutral in the outer disk to ionized in the inner regions . because of the complex morphology from 5 to 8  on kpc scales , we conclude that the ism has been disturbed by the combined effects of the star - formation episodes concentrated in knots a , b , and c.      fig .",
    "[ fig : mipsoverlay ] shows the dust emission at the longer wavelengths of 24 , 70 and 160 .",
    "the emission at 24 and 70  is virtually point - like , and appears to be mainly associated with the most active star - forming region a. the point - like nature of the 24 and 70  emission is also illustrated by the growth curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : phot].[sec : phot ] is too low relative to the spectrum .",
    "the mips-24 image of haro3  resembles the octagonal shape of the prf , which is strongly diffraction limited with a pronounced airy ring .",
    "hence , we would expect a gaussian fit to give a lower flux than the true one , since it does not include the flux in the airy maximum at radii of @xmath76 , and may also have overestimated the background because of the additional emission at these radii .",
    "] however , the emission at 160  appears to be more extended ( see also its growth curve in fig . [",
    "fig : phot ] ) .    like most other galaxies ,",
    "haro3  is a composite entity in the ir ; we see different components and morphologies depending on wavelength . in haro3",
    ", we see _ extended _ stellar photospheric and _ compact _ hot dust continuum emission at 4.5 ; _ extended _ pah emission in the general ism at 8   but with some hot dust continuum and stars ; _ compact _ warm dust emission associated with active star - forming regions at 24 and 70 ; and cooler _ extended _ dust emission associated with older stellar populations at 160 .",
    "we now use the complete ir sed to constrain the properties of the star formation and the dust in the brightest star - forming region in haro3 , region a. the infrared morphology revealed by the irac and mips images ( fig .",
    "[ fig : irac ] and [ fig : mipsoverlay ] ) suggest that region  a dominates the sed of haro3at wavelengths @xmath52 .",
    "the ir sed of this region , a strong continuum with ionic lines indicating a relatively hard ionizing source , is quite similar to that observed toward dust - enshrouded super star clusters , such as for instance in ngc5253 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references within ) . such an identification is confirmed by the detection of compact thermal radio emission from region  a by @xcite , emission identified as originating in the compact hii  region created by the star cluster .",
    "to constrain the properties of this cluster and its surrounding dust envelope , we have fit the nir - fir sed of this source with the radiative transfer code _ dusty _  @xcite .",
    "_ dusty _  solves the radiative transfer problem in a dust envelope but has a number of limitations which must be understood so we can properly evaluate the results it gives .",
    "first , _ dusty",
    "_  assumes a spherically symmetric dust envelope which is decoupled from the ionizing radiation source .",
    "while this decoupling is probably realistic for the stars and the dust ( we do not expect much of the dust to survive in or very near the star cluster ) , it is much less so for the ionized gas which is a source of radiation through its continuum emission , and the dust .",
    "the assumption of spherical symmetry is also too strong to be realistic .",
    "second , _ dusty",
    "_  assumes that grains are in thermal equilibrium with the radiation field .",
    "this may be the case for all grains near and in the cluster exposed to its intense and hard radiation , but clearly not so for grains in the general interstellar medium of haro3 .",
    "these two limitations mean that the sed we can fit realistically with _ dusty _",
    "concerns only region  a , but not the whole galaxy .    to construct the sed of region  a",
    ", we must use high spatial resolution observations in order to distinguish its emission from emission from other parts of haro3 . in the nir , which is a useful domain to constrain the total optical depth to the cluster",
    ", we use the nir observations listed in table [ tab : photom ] , taken from @xcite . given that our irs spectrum is centered on region",
    "a and includes the spectral region covered by our irac data , we have preferred to use the irs rather than the irac data in the 5 - 35  range .",
    "we however do not use the irs spectrum in its original form but rather in its pah - subtracted version .",
    "as explained earlier , the pah component in the original irs spectrum is related to the general ism of haro3and therefore not relevant here .",
    "the mips point at 24  is included in the fit , although it does not provide supplementary constraints with respect to the irs spectrum .",
    "as the 70@xmath45 m  mips image is strikingly pointlike we assume that it is entirely due to region  a. the 160  mips image is more extended than the psf ( fig .",
    "[ fig : phot ] ) and therefore likely contains a contribution from the general ism .",
    "however it is not possible to accurately deconvolve the 160@xmath45 m  image to derive the point - source component flux only .",
    "we thus should keep in mind in judging the goodness of the fit that the 160  flux is likely an upper limit to the actual flux from region  a.    the iras and iso measurements of haro3  were not used in the fit for two reasons .",
    "first , the iso fluxes and the iras 12 and 25@xmath45 m  fluxes fall in a region of the sed that is better covered by the irs and mips data , and including them does not add more information .",
    "comparison of the iras 60 and 100  fluxes to the mips 70 and 160  fluxes shows that , although they are compatible with each other within their respective error bars , the iras photometry is systematically higher than the mips photometry",
    ". this can be due either to the larger iras beam since it subtends more faint extended emission than the smaller spitzer beam or to an incorrect cross - calibration between iras and spitzer . at this stage of the spitzer mission , cross - calibration with another mission",
    "can indeed be uncertain and , as a result we rather restrict ourselves to the spitzer data .",
    "finally , the radio data of @xcite , although of very high spatial resolution , were not used in the fit because first , _ dusty _  does not take into account radio emitting processes ; and second , the contribution of free - free and synchrotron emission to the sed at the longest wavelength point ( 160 ) is negligible .    before proceeding with the fit , we recall that region  a is composite .",
    "it is composed of two main sources ( a1 and a2 ) and a much fainter third one ( a3 ) . making a single _ dusty _  model for a collection of identical sources",
    "is not a problem since the total values of the quantities of interest such as opacities , luminosities and masses , are independent of the actual number of sources used to fit the sed .",
    "as discussed before , a1 and a2 are not identical ( we will neglect the faint a3 ) .",
    "thus , a2 has no optical counterpart in the _",
    "hst_f606w band image while a1 does .",
    "it is also not clear that the br@xmath18 and radio emission in the direction of a2 come from the same source , while such an association is much clearer in a1 .",
    "finally , the different derivations of the extinction toward region a ( essentially a1+a2 ) by @xcite , using the radio to br@xmath18 ratio , the hydrogen balmer line ratios , and the nir colors , disagree .",
    "while this is a rather common situation , it points to a non - homogeneous extinction in region a and suggests that a1 and a2 may not be in the same `` evolutionary '' stage . indeed ,",
    "our cloudy modeling does suggest that a2 has more extinction than a1 ( @xmath25[sec : cloudy ] ) .",
    "this composite nature of region a must be kept in mind when discussing the physical properties deduced from the fit .",
    "this is however the best we can do : the lack of high resolution data in the mir - fir allows us only to make a single _ dusty _  model of the sed of region a which includes both a1 and a2 .",
    "when judging the goodness of the fit , it is also important to compare the number of independent constraints with the number of model parameters . for practical purposes we have integrated the irs data in a series of 10 pseudo - filters with a resolving power @xmath53 of 5 .",
    "the nir data consists of three bands , while mips provides 2 independent measurements .",
    "we therefore have 15 independent constraints on the fit .",
    "the model requires a large number of parameters .",
    "we need first to specify a heating source .",
    "we take it to be described by the starburst99 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter sb99 ) burst stellar populations at the metallicity of haro3 .",
    "this requires one parameter , the age of the burst .",
    "the dust is described by its composition and size distribution .",
    "we take it to be formed of silicates , graphites and amorphous carbons .",
    "thus the dust mix requires two more parameters .",
    "the dust size distribution is characterized by a minimum and a maximum size and a power law exponent , requiring three additional parameters .",
    "the dust shell around the star cluster is modeled as a series of embedded shells , each with an outer ( relative ) radius and an exponent for the power - law describing the dependence of the dust density on radius .",
    "thus the total number of parameters required is @xmath54 .",
    "the `` size '' of the system is described by the temperature at the inner edge of the first shell .",
    "finally the total amount of dust is constrained by the optical depth at v. a complete _ dusty _  model is therefore described by @xmath55 , i.e. in principle , a model with 3 shells is still over - constrained by the data .    to estimate the goodness of fit of a model , we compute the quantity : @xmath56 ^ 2,\\ ] ] where @xmath57 and @xmath58 are respectively the observed and modeled fluxes ,",

    "the sum of the weights is normalized to n , the number of filters used to construct the sed .",
    "to search for the best fitting dust sed , i.e. the one with the lowest @xmath23 , we have run about 3@xmath110@xmath62 _ dusty _  models , varying @xmath63 from 1 to 3 .",

    "we ran also just short of a million 2-zone models where the outer radius was varied between 100 and 1000 , and the intermediate radius between 2 and 999 . in these models the density exponent ranged between @xmath112 and 4 , with most values between @xmath111 and 2 .",
    "about 3.5@xmath65 3-zone models were run , where the outer radius was fixed at 1000 and the intermediate radius sampled the range from 10 to 999 uniformly . in the 3-zone models ,",
    "the density exponent was varied from @xmath66 to 3 with a large number of models between 0 and 1 .",

    ", the best constrained quantity is the bolometric luminosity of the system .",
    "this is because , for a well - sampled sed , this luminosity being the integral of the sed , the observed and best - fit ones should be the same .",
    "the luminosity of the model is 2.8@xmath110@xmath67@xmath68 .",

    "the bolometric luminosity constitutes a large but not unreasonable fraction of the total galaxy luminosity : for comparison , the 8 - 1000@xmath45 m  luminosity derived from the iras bands @xcite is 4.1@xmath110@xmath67@xmath68 . with the bolometric luminosity of the system",
    ", we can then use the sb99 models to derive several physical parameters of the central ionizing source .",
    "the best - fit sed corresponds to a sb99 model with a salpeter initial mass function and a burst age of 5myr .",
    "as this sb99 cluster has a luminosity of 10@xmath67@xmath68  for a stellar mass of 10@xmath62@xmath69 , the ionizing source has then a mass of 2.8@xmath110@xmath62@xmath69 .",
    "this is again in the high mass range for stellar clusters , but acceptable given that region a is a multiple source .",
    "the best - fit age for the cluster is 5myr , in the upper range of ages that have been derived for region a using various diagnostics .",
    "for example , in the course of a large program to determine electron temperatures of hii  regions in bcds by fitting their optical seds ( 32005200  ) and in particular the balmer jump ( @xmath323646  ) , @xcite have determined the stellar populations of a number of galaxies , including region a in haro3 .",
    "they approximate the star formation history of region a by two bursts of different strengths , a recent burst with an age t(young ) to account for the young stellar population and a prior burst with an age t(old ) responsible for the older stars .",
    "the contribution of each burst to the sed is given by the ratio of the masses of stellar populations formed respectively in the old and young bursts , b= m(old)/m(young ) .",
    "the contribution of gaseous emission is determined from the observed equivalent width of the @xmath37  emission line ew(@xmath37 ) .",
    "those authors ran a large number ( 10@xmath70 ) of monte carlo models varying simultaneously t(young ) , t(old ) and b. they found that the model which best fits the sed of haro3  has t(young ) = 4 myr , t(old ) = 2 gyr and b = 20 .",
    "the age of the young burst so derived is in good agreement with the one of @xmath7 5 myr derived by @xcite from fitting the nir colors , and the one derived here by the _",
    "dusty _  fit .",
    "sb99 predicts also the number of hydrogen - ionizing photons q@xmath42   from such a cluster .",
    "we find q@xmath42@xmath71photons s@xmath14 .",
    "this is on the low side of the range of values for a1@xmath0a2 given by @xcite , i.e. from 4.3 ( @xmath72 ) to 8.2@xmath73photons s@xmath14 ( radio ) converted to the distance used here .",
    "@xcite interpret the disagreement between the two derivations of q@xmath42  as a sign for the existence of highly obscured sources in region a. this explanation can not account for our low value of q@xmath42 : since we reproduce the full sed of region a , there is no room for extra sources as they would inevitably contribute substantial emission in some wavelength range .",
    "a possible explanation could be that the age we derive is too old . as can be seen in @xcite a 2.5 myr cluster has a q@xmath42  5 times higher while its total luminosity has only increased by a factor 1.5 . yet a more likely explanation is related to the composite nature of region a",
    ": a1 seems to suffer from very little extinction , while a2 seems to be more obscured .",
    "one could thus envision a situation where the less obscured source is indeed a 5 myr cluster , though less luminous than we find here , while the more obscured source is a younger cluster .",
    "such a model however has too many free parameters to be constrained by the data at hand .",
    "the derived properties of the dust `` shell '' around the ionizing clusters lead to a more surprising picture .",
    "the first intriguing feature concerns the nature of the dust . we find that silicates are absent from the best - fitting chemical mix .",
    "this situation is similar to that in ngc5253 @xcite where modeling of the embedded star cluster also indicates a lack of silicates .",
    "this situation likely results from the need for significantly hot dust to produce the nir continuum , while avoiding the generation of silicate emission / absorption features which would be expected from small hot silicate grains in an optically thick regime .",
    "if the hot dust continuum were produced by thermally fluctuating small carbon grains , then colder silicate dust grains may exist in the outer part envelope .",
    "however these two features ",
    "stochastic heating , and a radial dependence of the chemical composition  are not implemented in _",
    "dusty_.    the second intriguing feature concerns the size of the grains .",
    "to reproduce the full sed , and in particular its fir part , the maximum grain size must exceed @xmath711 ; the upper limit to the largest possible size is unconstrained by our fit .",
    "even though the best - fit value is large , @xmath7 40 , this is still small compared to the millimeter - sized grains that have been advocated to fit the seds of circumstellar shells ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , this is quite large compared to the standard mrn size distribution @xcite , with a maximum size of 0.25 - 1.0 .",
    "if we allow the fit to the 160@xmath45 m  mips flux to be significantly worse since it is likely an upper limit , we can relax the constraint on the largest grain size to values that are more consistent with the mrn distribution .",
    "unlike the maximum size , the minimum size and the exponent of the size distribution are very similar to the mrn distribution .",
    "the last surprising feature concerns the extent and mass of the `` shell '' : at the adopted distance of 16.3mpc , it has a radius of 430pc , considerably larger than region  a and nearly reaching region  b ( fig .  [ fig : iracoverlay ] )",
    ". a more detailed look at the model reveals that , despite the large extent of the dust shell , the other physical parameters are not unreasonable .",
    "first , with @xmath74 , the shell needs not be very thick .",
    "in fact , it is not truly a shell since the density shows no dependence with radius , i.e. the exponent of the density power law distribution is equal to zero .",
    "thus , the geometry deduced from the _ dusty _  modeling is more that of a large cloud of dust surrounding region  a than that of a giant dust shell .",
    "one could in fact consider that the best fitting model describes , not so much an embedded cluster and its envelope , but the general ism of haro3heated locally by the clusters in region  a. this would make region  a an example of the later stage in the possible evolutionary sequence that goes from totally embedded super - star clusters to completely unobscured ones ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the irac and the shorter - wavelength mips images do not show such an extended dust cloud because of the presence of temperature and hence surface brightness radial gradients in haro3 . in the model ,",
    "the energy source lies at the center , the surface brightness is centrally peaked and the apparent size of the object is smaller than its physical size . at 160 , with a resolution of @xmath75 , haro3  appears extended ( resolved ) , which would be consistent with the cool dust temperature at a radius of 430pc .",
    "_ dusty _  can compute images at selected wavelengths ; these images reveal that the fwhm of the dust cloud is always smaller than the instrumental psf 24 and 70 .",
    "therefore although the model dust cloud is large , it would not necessarily be seen as a resolved object in the 24 and 70  images . at 160  however , with a resolution of @xmath75 , haro3  appears slightly resolved , which is not the case of the model cloud .",
    "this probably indicates that a fraction from the 160  flux is not heated by region a but rather finds its energy source in the general interstellar radiation field .",
    "we derive an opacity @xmath74 from our best - fit model . in the model context , this is the optical depth of the `` shell '' toward the central source .",
    "there are many possible explanations of the difference between the _",
    "dusty_-derived optical depth @xmath76 and the measured values of the extinction @xmath77 from recombination lines .",
    "the simple and linear relation between the two quantities ( @xmath78 ) is only valid in the screen geometry , when scattering and radiation transfer are neglected .",
    "although _ dusty _  assumes a screen geometry , it treats the complete radiation transfer process : absorption , scattering , and re - emission of the absorbed energy .",
    "as scattering has a wavelength dependence opposite to that of extinction , the resulting relation between @xmath77 and @xmath76 becomes shallower and depends strongly on wavelength .",
    "another plausible explanation is that a more realistic geometry would have part of the source region , and in particular the ionized gas responsible for all the lines and for a large fraction of the nir emission , mixed with the absorbing dust .",
    "this also results in a shallower relation between @xmath77 and @xmath76 . in any case",
    ", the model value of a@xmath5  is within the range of observationally determined values of a@xmath5 . from the optical recombination lines ,",
    "@xcite derive a@xmath5=0.5 .",
    "comparing br@xmath18 from @xcite with @xmath37  gives a@xmath5=0.9 . from the location of region",
    "a in the ( j - h / h - k ) color - color diagram , @xcite estimate a larger a@xmath5  in the range 2 - 4 .",
    "finally , the comparison of q@xmath42  from the radio emission to that deduced from the @xmath72  line gives a still larger value , a@xmath5=8 @xcite .",
    "there thus appears to be a systematic increase of the derived extinction with increasing wavelengths .",
    "these differences may be due to a variety of causes such as : ( 1 )  mixing between the emission and absorption regions ; ( 2 )  the coexistence of sources with different extinction within the spitzer beam ; or ( 3 )  the clumpy distribution of the absorbing material . for lack of a better spatial resolution in the infrared ,",
    "it is impossible to distinguish among these possibilities , although we do know that region  a comprises three components in the radio . that we can model the complete nir - fir sed with a characteristic opacity in the intermediate range of the observationally determined extinctions suggests that our model is representative of the _ average _ situation in region  a.    from the dust properties and the physical size of the system",
    ", we can compute the total dust mass which we find to be 1.5@xmath79@xmath69 .",
    "this is again a large dust mass for embedded clusters , which generally are one order of magnitude less massive .",
    "it is however a quite reasonable mass for a dust cloud in the general ism of haro3 .",
    "indeed , based on the observations of @xcite and @xcite , @xcite have derived a total molecular and atomic gas mass of @xmath76.7@xmath80@xmath69 .",
    "thus haro3  has a dust - to - gas ratio of 2.2@xmath81 , consistent with the metallicity trends for bcds illustrated by @xcite and references therein .    to summarize , a model where the stellar clusters in region  a heat an extended and diffuse region of the ism of haro3   can account well for the nir - fir spectral energy distribution of the galaxy .",
    "star formation in haro3  occurs primarily in several knots distributed over the central region of the galaxy around the dust lane . the primary star - forming regions , knots a , b , and c ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : irac ] ) show different properties in the optical , the infrared , and the radio . because of the compact radio emission found by @xcite , we would like to argue that knot a is a ensemble of star clusters with generally large extinction ( the extinction is highly variable ) , while knot b is older and less obscured .",
    "knot c , with its seemingly high pah fraction , would be older still , with an @xmath22  flux @xmath76 times smaller than the other two knots , but with similar extinction @xcite .",
    "because of its high density ( n@xmath82200@xmath36 * ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and compact size in the radio @xcite , we would classify knot a as `` active '' ( see the definition of this term in * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "such conditions are found also in mergers , with consequently a high pressure , and possible formation of super star clusters .",
    "that knot a is forming stars in an `` active '' mode is corroborated by the good fit of the _ dusty _  model to the ir sed , the significant ir luminosity , and the relatively high sfr inferred by @xcite from the radio emission .",
    "knots b and c , on the other hand , are less dense ( n@xmath82100@xmath36 * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and can be considered as  passive  .",
    "the properties of the knots differ in terms of their irac and mips colors , but the irs spectrum encompasses variable fractions of knots a and b , as well as the intervening ism in the dust lane dividing the two regions . were knot a to be an isolated dusty star cluster with a rising - spectrum radio source , we would expect it to have little or no pah emission @xcite because we would expect the pahs to be destroyed by the intense radiation field in the `` active '' compact region .",
    "however , we do see pah emission .",
    "therefore either our hypothesis is mistaken , namely pahs can be found in compact dense star - forming regions , or our spectrum is `` contaminated '' by region  b and the global ism in haro3  ( or both ) . to distinguish among the various possibilities ,",
    "more extensive samples are needed , with a wide range of metallicities , luminosities , and pah properties .",
    "haro3  is relatively nearby bcd , only slightly metal deficient , with 12@xmath0log(o / h)=8.32 , and only slightly sub - luminous , with @xmath83 .",
    "hence , it is an object which could serve as a transition case to link the properties of low - metallicity bcds with those of more luminous metal - rich starbursts .",
    "indeed , the ews of its pahs are generally higher than those of other bcds ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , more consistent with more luminous and metal - rich starburst galaxies @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the pahs in haro3  tend to be neutral according to the diagnostic diagram of @xcite , more similar to `` normal '' galaxies than to starbursts .",
    "pahs in bcds may also be narrower than those of starbursts , and more similar to nearby hii  regions although the differences may not be significant .",
    "the problem with many of these results is that their exact interpretation depends on the fraction of the global ism in the irs slits .",
    "these appear to cross the dust lane that separates the apparent positions of star - forming knots a and b , so we could be seeing a pah contribution from the general ism , not necessarily associated with the star formation .",
    "the pah parameters also depend on how they were derived ( e.g. , continuum determination , profile templates , etc . ) .",
    "consequently , on the basis of a single object , we can not make definitive statements about low - metallicity pahs , and must wait for larger bcd and starburst samples analyzed in a homogeneous way .",
    "we present here the first results of our _ spitzer _  cycle 1 program which is aimed at the investigation of star formation in metal - poor bcd galaxies .",
    "we wish to study how star formation parameters and dust properties change as a function of metallicity and excitation . in this first paper of a series",
    ", we discuss the infrared properties of the most metal - rich object in our sample , haro3  = ngc 3353 = mrk 35 , with an oxygen abundance of 12@xmath0log(o / h)=8.32 .",
    "we have obtained irs low and high - resolution spectra for the brightest star - forming region a in haro3 , as well as irac images at 4.5 and 8  and mips images at 24 , 70 , and 160  of the galaxy .",

    "the pahs in haro3  are predominantly neutral and small , similar to those found in normal spiral galaxies , suggesting that they reside in the general ism and not in the star - forming region a. the pah emission features are relatively narrow and their equivalent widths are generally high for the metallicity of haro3 .",
    "( 2 ) gaseous nebular line emission is also seen .",
    "the irs spectrum shows several fine - structure lines , including [ siv]@xmath3210.51 , [ neii]@xmath3212.81 , [ neiii]@xmath3215.55 , 36.01 , [ siii]@xmath3218.71 , 33.58 , [ oiv]@xmath3225.89 , and [ siii]@xmath3234.82 .",
    "( 3 ) several fairly high - excitation lines are detected in haro3 .",
    "the faint [ oiv ]  line at 25.89  indicates the presence of radiation as hard as 54.9 ev in haro3 .",
    "this hard radiation is perhaps due to the wolf - rayet stars present in the galaxy .",
    "such a detection is intriguing because the high - ionization [ fev]@xmath324227 and heii  @xmath324686 emission lines which both have an ionization potential of 54.4ev , are not seen in the optical spectrum of haro3 , presumably because of extinction effects .",
    "the electron density derived from the mir lines is about half that derived from the optical lines .",
    "moreover hii  photoionization cloudy models that reproduce the optical line intensities predict mir lines that are systematically too small compared to those observed .",
    "this discrepancy may be understood if the beam dilution in the ir is taken into account , and if the bulk of the mir radiation comes from a region more obscured than the optical one .",
    "\\(4 ) like most galaxies , haro3  is a composite entity in the ir .",
    "we see _ extended _ stellar photospheric emission and _ compact _ hot dust continuum at 4.5  coming mainly from the star - forming regions , _ extended _ pah emission coming mainly from the general ism at 8 , with a small contribution from hot dust continuum and stars , _ compact _ small grain warm dust emission associated with active star - forming regions at 24 and 70 , and cooler _ extended _ dust emission associated with older stellar populations at 160 .",
    "\\(5 ) we have modeled the ir spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of star - forming region a with _ dusty _ , a code which solves the radiative transfer problem in a dust envelope .",
    "the best - fit model gives a total luminosity of 2.8@xmath110@xmath2 l@xmath3 and a total stellar mass of 2.8@xmath110@xmath4 m@xmath3 for the ionizing star clusters .",
    "these numbers are not unreasonably high because region a contains at least three star clusters .",
    "the best - fit age of the star formation burst in a is 5myr , in agreement with the age derived from the optical sed .",
    "the number of ionizing photons is 4.4@xmath73 photons s@xmath14 , greater than the one derived from the br@xmath18 line but smaller than that derived from the thermal radio flux , indicating more extinction in the br@xmath18 flux than in the mir .",
    "\\(6 ) as for the nature of the dust , the best - fit _ dusty _  model implies that silicates are absent from region a. the maximum grain size can reach the very large value of 40  if we attempt to fit the 160  mips flux . however , we obtain more reasonable results ( @xmath7 1 ) if we consider the 160   flux to be an upper limit and do not attempt to fit it .",

    "the dust density does not vary with distance from the central clusters , and the dust extent is 430pc in radius , considerably larger than region  a. this suggests that the geometry deduced from the _ dusty _  modeling is that of a large cloud of dust in the general ism of haro3 , surrounding region  a and heated by the clusters in it , rather than that of a giant dust shell around region  a.    this work is based on observations made with the spitzer space telescope , which is operated by the jet propulsion laboratory , california institute of technology , under nasa contract 1407 .",

    "<S> the irs spectrum of haro3  shows strong narrow polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) emission , with high equivalent widths . </S>",

    "<S> a cloudy model suggests that the mir lines originate in two regions : a low - extinction optically - emitting region , and an optically invisible one with much higher extinction . </S>",
    "<S> the morphology of haro3  changes with wavelength . </S>",
    "<S> irac 4.5  traces extended stellar photospheric emission from the body of the galaxy and hot dust continuum coming mainly from star - forming regions ; 8  probes extended pah emission coming mainly from the general ism ; mips 24 and 70  images map compact small - grain warm dust emission associated with active star formation , and 160  reflects cooler extended dust associated with older stellar populations . </S>",

    "<S> the best - fit _ dusty _  model of the sed gives a total luminosity of 2.8@xmath110@xmath2 l@xmath3 and a mass of 2.8@xmath110@xmath4 m@xmath3 for the ionizing clusters . </S>",
    "<S> we infer an extinction a@xmath5@xmath63 , intermediate between the optical a@xmath5@xmath7 0.5 and the radio a@xmath5@xmath7 8 , consistent with the picture that longer wavelength observations probe more deeply into star - forming regions . </S>"
