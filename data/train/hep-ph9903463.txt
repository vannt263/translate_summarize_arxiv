    "the search for the higgs boson and , hence , for the origin of electroweak symmetry breaking and fermion mass generation , remains one of the premier tasks of present and future high energy physics experiments .",
    "fits to precision electroweak ( ew ) data have for some time suggested a relatively small higgs boson mass , of order 100  gev  @xcite , hence we have studied an intermediate - mass higgs , with mass in the @xmath4  gev range , beyond the reach of lep at cern and of the fermilab tevatron .",
    "observation of the @xmath0 decay channel in weak boson fusion events at the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) is quite promising , both in the standard model ( sm ) and minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) .",
    "this channel has lower qcd backgrounds compared to the dominant @xmath5 mode , thus offering the best prospects for a direct measurement of a @xmath6 coupling .    despite weak - boson fusion higgs production s significantly lower cross section at the lhc ( almost one order of magnitude )",
    ", it has the advantage of additional information in the event other than the decay products transverse momentum and their invariant mass resonance : the observable quark jets .",
    "thus one can exploit techniques like forward jet tagging  @xcite to reduce the backgrounds .",
    "another advantage is the different color structure of the signal v. the background .",
    "additional soft jet activity ( minijets ) in the central region , which occurs much more frequently for the color - exchange processes of the qcd backgrounds  @xcite , are suppressed via a central jet veto .",
    "we have performed a first analysis of intermediate - mass sm @xmath0 and of the main physics and reducible backgrounds at the lhc , which demonstrates the feasibility of higgs boson detection in this channel , with modest luminosity  @xcite .",
    "@xmath0 event characteristics were analyzed for one @xmath7 decaying leptonically and the other decaying hadronically .",
    "we demonstrated that forward jet tagging , @xmath7 identification and reconstruction criteria alone yield an @xmath82/1 signal - to - background ( s / b ) ratio ; additional large background suppression factors can be obtained with the minijet veto .    in the mssm ,",
    "strategies to identify the structure of the higgs sector are much less clear . for large tan@xmath9",
    ", the light neutral higgs bosons may couple much more strongly to the @xmath10 members of the weak isospin doublets than its sm analogue . as a result ,",
    "the total width can increase significantly compared to a sm higgs of the same mass .",
    "this comes at the expense of the branching ratio @xmath11 , the cleanest higgs discovery mode , possibly rendering it unobservable over much of mssm parameter space and forcing consideration of other observational channels .",
    "since @xmath12 is instead slightly enhanced , we have examined the @xmath7 mode as an alternative  /citeprz .",
    "the analysis uses full tree - level matrix elements for the weak boson fusion higgs signal and the various backgrounds .",
    "extra minijet activity was simulated by adding the emission of one extra parton to the basic signal and background processes , with the soft singularities regulated via a truncated shower approximation ( tsa )  @xcite .",
    "we simulated @xmath13 collisions at the cern lhc , @xmath14  tev .",
    "for all qcd effects , the running of the strong - coupling constant was evaluated at one - loop order , with @xmath15 .",
    "we employed cteq4l parton distribution functions  @xcite throughout .",
    "the factorization scale was chosen as @xmath16 min(@xmath17 ) of the defined jets , and the renormalization scale @xmath18 was fixed by @xmath19 .",
    "detector effects were considered by including gaussian smearing for partons and leptons according to atlas expectations  @xcite .    at lowest order",
    ", the signal is described by two single - feynman - diagram processes , @xmath20 , i.e. @xmath21 and @xmath22 fusion where the weak bosons are emitted from the incoming quarks  @xcite . from a previous study of @xmath23",
    "decays in weak boson fusion  @xcite we know several features of the signal , which we could directly exploit here : the centrally produced higgs boson tends to yield central decay products ( in this case @xmath24 ) , and the two quarks enter the detector at large rapidity compared to the @xmath7 s and with transverse momenta in the 20 - 80 gev range , thus leading to two observable forward tagging jets .",
    "we only considered the case of one @xmath7 decaying leptonically ( @xmath25,@xmath26 ) , and the other decaying hadronically , with a combined branching fraction of @xmath27 .",
    "our analysis critically employed transverse momentum cuts on the charged @xmath7-decay products and , hence , some care was taken to ensure realistic momentum distributions .",
    "because of its small mass , we simulated @xmath7 decays in the collinear and narrow - width approximations and with decay distributions to @xmath28,@xmath29 , @xmath30  @xcite , adding the various hadronic decay modes according to their branching ratios .",
    "we took into account the anti - correlation of the @xmath31 polarizations in the decay of the higgs .",
    "positive identification of the hadronic @xmath32 decay requires severe cuts on the charged hadron isolation .",
    "we based our simulations on the possible strategies analyzed by cavalli _",
    "et al . _",
    ". considering hadronic jets of @xmath33  gev in the atlas detector , they found non - tau rejection factors of 400 or more while true hadronic @xmath7 decays are retained with an identification efficiency of @xmath34 .    given the h decay signature , the main physics background to the @xmath35 events of the signal arises from real emission qcd corrections to the drell - yan process @xmath36 , dominated by @xmath37-channel gluon exchange .",
    "all interference effects between virtual photon and @xmath38-exchange were included , as was the correlation of @xmath31 polarizations .",
    "the @xmath38 component dominates , so we call these processes collectively the `` qcd @xmath39 '' background .    an additional physics `` ew @xmath39 '' background arises from @xmath38 and @xmath40 bremsstrahlung in ( anti)quark scattering via @xmath37-channel electroweak boson exchange , with subsequent decay @xmath41 .",
    "naively , this ew background may be thought of as suppressed compared to the analogous qcd process .",
    "however , the ew background includes electroweak boson fusion , @xmath42 , which has a momentum and color structure identical to the signal and thus can not easily be suppressed via cuts",
    ".    finally , we considered reducible backgrounds , i.e. any event that can mimic the @xmath43 signature of a hard , isolated lepton and missing @xmath17 , a hard , narrow @xmath7-like jet , and two forward tagging jets .",
    "thus we examined @xmath44 , where the @xmath45 decays leptonically ( @xmath25,@xmath26 ) and one jet fakes a hadronic @xmath7 , and @xmath46 , where one @xmath47 decays leptonically and either a light quark or @xmath47 jet fakes a hadronic @xmath7 .",
    "we neglected other sources like @xmath48 events which had previously been shown to give substantially smaller backgrounds  @xcite .",
    "fluctuations of a parton into a narrow @xmath7-like jet are considered with probability @xmath49 for gluons and light - quark jets and @xmath50 for @xmath47 jets ( which may be considered an upper bound )  @xcite .    in the case of @xmath51",
    ", we simulated the semileptonic decay @xmath52 by multiplying the @xmath53 cross section by a branching factor of 0.395 and implementing a three - body phase space distribution for the decay momenta to estimate the effects of lepton isolation cuts .",
    "we normalized our resulting cross section to reproduce the same factor 100 reduction found in ref .",
    "the basic acceptance requirements must ensure that the two jets and two @xmath7 s are observed inside the detector ( within the hadronic and electromagnetic calorimeters , respectively ) , and are well - separated from each other : @xmath54    the @xmath43 signal is characterized by two forward jets with large invariant mass , and central @xmath7 decay products .",
    "the qcd backgrounds have a large gluon - initiated component and thus prefer lower invariant tagging jet masses .",
    "also , their @xmath7 and @xmath45 decay products tend to be less central .",
    "thus , to reduce the backgrounds to the level of the signal we required tagging jets with a combination of large invariant mass , far forward rapidity , and high @xmath17 , and @xmath7 decay products central with respect to the tagging jets  @xcite : @xmath55 triggering the event via the isolated @xmath7-decay lepton and identifying the hadronic @xmath7 decay as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite requires sizable transverse momenta for the observable @xmath7 decay products : @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "it is possible to reconstruct the @xmath7-pair invariant mass from the observable @xmath7 decay products and the missing transverse momentum vector of the event  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath7 mass was neglected and collinear decays assumed , a condition easily satisfied because of the high @xmath7 transverse momenta required .",
    "the @xmath7 momenta were reconstructed from the charged decay products @xmath17 and missing @xmath17 vectors .",
    "we imposed a cut on the angle between the @xmath7 decay products to satisfy the collinear decay assumption , @xmath58 , and demanded a physicality condition for the reconstructed @xmath7 momenta ( unphysical solutions arise from smearing effects ) ; that is , the fractional momentum @xmath59 a charged decay observables takes from its parent @xmath7 can not be negative . additionally , the @xmath60 distribution of the leptonically decaying @xmath7-candidate is softer for real @xmath7 s than for the reducible backgrounds , because the charged lepton shares the parent @xmath7 energy with two neutrinos .",
    "a cut @xmath61 , @xmath62 proved very effective in suppressing the reducible backgrounds .",
    "our monte carlo predicted a @xmath7-pair mass resolution of 10 gev or better , so we choose @xmath63  gev mass bins for analyzing the cross sections .",
    "finally , the @xmath64 background exhibits a jacobian peak in its @xmath65 distribution  @xcite .",
    "a cut @xmath66  gev largely eliminates this background .    using all these cuts together ,",
    "although not in a highly optimized combination , we expect already a signal to background ratio of 2/1 with a signal cross section of 0.5 fb for @xmath67  gev .",
    "a probability for vetoing additional central hadronic radiation was obtained by measuring the fraction of events that have additional radiation in the central region , between the tagging jets , with @xmath17 above 20 gev , using the matrix elements for additional parton emission .",
    "this minijet veto reduces the signal by about @xmath68 , but eliminates typically @xmath69 of the qcd backgrounds ; the ew @xmath39 background is reduced by about @xmath70 , indicating the presence of both boson bremsstrahlung and weak boson fusion effects . because the veto probability for qcd backgrounds is found to be process independent , we applied the same value to the @xmath71 background .",
    "table  [ table1 ] gives expected numbers of events for 30 fb@xmath2 integrated luminosity at the lhc .",
    "it is possible to isolate a virtually background - free @xmath72 signal at the lhc , leading to a @xmath1 observation of a sm higgs boson with a mere 30 fb@xmath2 of data .",
    "the expected purity of the signal is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : mtautau ] , showing the reconstructed @xmath73 invariant mass for a sm higgs of 120 gev after all cuts and a minijet veto have been applied .",
    "while the reducible @xmath64 and @xmath51 backgrounds are the most complicated and do require further study , they appear to be easily manageable .",
    ".[table1 ] number of expected events for the signal and backgrounds , for 30  @xmath74 integrated luminosity , all cuts and application of a minijet veto .",

    "the production of cp even higgs bosons in weak boson fusion is governed by the @xmath76 couplings , which , compared to the sm case , are suppressed by factors @xmath77 , respectively  @xcite .",
    "their branching ratios are modified with slightly more complicated factors .",
    "one can simply multiply sm cross section results from our analysis by these factors to determine the observability of @xmath78 in mssm parameter space .",
    "we used a renormalization group improved next - to - leading order calculation , which allows a light higgs mass up to @xmath79  gev , and examined two trilinear term mixing cases , no mixing and maximal mixing  @xcite .",
    "varying the pseudoscalar higgs boson mass @xmath80 , one finds that @xmath81,@xmath82 each approach a plateau for the case @xmath83 , respectively . below @xmath84  gev ,",
    "the light higgs mass will fall off linearly with @xmath80 , while the heavy higgs will approach @xmath85  gev , whereas above @xmath84  gev , the light higgs will approach @xmath86  gev and the heavy higgs mass will rise linearly with @xmath80 .",
    "the transition region behavior is very abrupt for large @xmath87 , such that the plateau state will go to @xmath79  gev almost immediately , while for small @xmath87 the transition is much softer and the plateau state reaches the limiting value via a more gradual asymptotic approach .    with reasonable luminosity , 100 fb@xmath2 in the worst case , it will be possible to observe at the @xmath1 level either @xmath88 or @xmath89 decays to @xmath7 pairs when they are in their respective plateau region , with the possibility of some overlap in a small region of @xmath80 , as shown in fig .",
    "very low values of @xmath90 would be unobservable , but already excluded by lep2 ; there should be considerable overlap between this mode at the lhc and the lep2 excluded region .",
    "furthermore , a parton shower monte carlo with full detector simulation should be able to optimize the analysis so that much less data is required to observe or exclude the mssm higgs .",
    "we have shown that weak boson fusion production of a higgs boson with subsequent decay to @xmath7 pairs , @xmath72 , is an excellent observational mode at the lhc , requiring only modest integrated luminosity and allowing direct measurement of the @xmath3 coupling .",
    "this mode also provides a no - lose strategy for seeing at least one of the cp even neutral mssm higgs bosons .",
