    "we consider a finite chain of @xmath2 oscillators with initial condition restricted to a small group of @xmath3  of consecutive oscillators .",
    "we define a localized motion as one in which the amplitude of oscillation is small outside a group of @xmath4 oscillators for all times , with @xmath5 , and we introduce a numerical criterion to quantify localization based on the information entropy .",

    "last , since the linear frequencies of the isolated @xmath6-system lie in the dispersive band , an immediate consequence of the ( cc ) is that there must be a critical nonzero energy for localization ( namely , for at least one of the @xmath6 frequencies to exit the dispersive band ) . for supercritical values of the morse parameter , we use canonical perturbation theory to evaluate the frequency shifts and we predict a threshold energy for localization in agreement with the numerical calculations .    for the normalizations that follow , the most convenient way to introduce the peyrard - bishop ( bp ) model @xcite for a dna macromolecule is by the lagrangian    @xmath8^{2 } ,   \\label{pbmodel}\\ ] ]    where @xmath9and @xmath10 denote the relative displacements of the nucleotidic bases at sites @xmath11 and @xmath12 of each dna strand , respectively . the number @xmath2 denotes the number of sites in each strand of the dna and can be as large as @xmath13 . for practical reasons",

    "in such a way the localized state looses its energy in the form of radiation and spreads out . in contrast , localized excitations displaying only frequency components inside the two reactive bands are expected to preserve localization for long times .    there is a large body of studies of one - dimensional chains , investigating the energy interchange among the  linearized  system modes chaos5,pre1,pre2,driscoll , burlakov , cretegny , kosevich , mirnov . for initial energy in a few low frequency modes , one of us ( j. dl ) has developed theoretical descriptions for energy spreading among modes , valid in various energy ranges , which were compared to numerical results for the fpu chain @xcite and for the klein - gordon chain @xcite .",

    "the reason for this choice is that , as is well known , multiple - scale expansions are only valid for initial data varying slowly in real space and quasi - monochromatic in fourier space , while here we are interested in the evolution of initial excitations strongly localized in real space ( delocalized in fourier space ) . moreover",

    "let us initially displace from the equilibrium position @xmath46 only a finite number @xmath3 of consecutive particles . for such initial datum , instead of studying the dynamics of the full chain , involving a large number of degrees of freedom , we study the dynamics of the subsystem defined by the lagrangian ( [ normall ] ) , with the sum restricted to the sites corresponding to the degrees of freedom initially excited , and with fixed end boundary conditions for the next neighbors .",
    "such an @xmath6-degree of freedom subsystem is thought of as isolated and having energy @xmath47 .",
    "this subsystem can be regarded as a perturbation of @xmath48 linearly coupled oscillators , whose normal mode frequencies @xmath49 are shown to lie inside the dispersive band of the larger @xmath2-chain . for sufficiently low energies ,",
    "the dynamics is quasi - linear and its frequency spectrum is close to the normal mode frequencies @xmath50 . according to the ( cc ) ,",
    "if one uses such initial conditions for the larger lattice , the normal modes of the larger chain are excited and the initial excitation will spread out , which is what we observe numerically . with increasing energy , the effect of nonlinearity becomes prominent , and the frequency spectrum is modified . in the absence of resonances of third and fourth order ( at least ) in the harmonic spectrum of the subsystem , the modes preserve their identity and we can follow their frequency shifts inside the dispersive band . according to the ( cc ) , one has localization for initial data at a given energy when the frequencies of the corresponding motion of the subsystem is outside the dispersive band .",
    "of course this can happen only if the energy ( i.e. the nonlinearity ) is high enough .",
    "the conditions required on the frequency spectrum for multi - periodic oscillations are much more restrictive and the localization properties of such states can be very weak@xcite .",
    "for this reason , we restrict the analysis to _ periodic _ oscillations only , which amounts to look for periodic orbits of the subsystem whose frequency and harmonics lay outside the dispersive band .",
    "this analysis is detailed below .      for the theoretical analysis we consider localized excitations where the amplitude of oscillation is small  for sites outside a group of @xmath51 modes , say @xmath52 ( our @xmath11 runs to both negative and positive directions and the central particle is @xmath53 ) .",
    "under this conjecture the dynamics for sites on the right - hand side of the group ( @xmath54 )  can be approximated by a linear chain driven by the given oscillation of oscillator @xmath55 ( while the same can be said of the oscillators on the left - hand side , @xmath56 ) .",
    "the equation of motion for the linearized chain can be derived from the lagrangian ( [ normall ] ) by expanding the exponential @xmath57where the above linearization holds only for the oscillators outside the subgroup , which are supposed to oscillate with a small amplitude ( @xmath54 ) .",

    "( [ linear ] ) that @xmath60satisfies the linear matrix iteration law    @xmath61    where @xmath62 .",
    "for example in the case of a monochromatic forcing , @xmath63 is nonzero only at a single frequency @xmath64 , and for the iteration of eq.([iterate ] ) to produce a bounded amplitude for sites of a large @xmath11 it is necessary that @xmath65 , which is the definition of the reactive band ( as opposed to the radiation band defined by @xmath66 ) .",
    "if the forcing has several large fourier components , the first large component might be in the lower reactive band ( @xmath67 ) , while the other important harmonics could be in the upper reactive band ( @xmath68 ) .",
    "the first subsystem we consider here ( henceforth called the 1-system ) is defined by @xmath69 and consists of the nonlinear oscillation of a single particle of coordinate @xmath70 with fixed ends ( @xmath71 ) .",
    "this nonlinear dynamics can be derived from lagrangian ( [ normall ] ) and it is also described by the hamiltonian@xmath72the frequency of oscillation for the periodic motion of  hamiltonian ( hamiltonian1 ) can be determined by a simple quadrature for any energy , by the formula@xmath73 ^{-1}. \\label{quadrature}\\]]in figure 1 we plot this frequency as a function of the energy for several values of the parameter @xmath37 to illustrate that it is always inside the radiation band for @xmath74 at any energy .",
    "this is then the minimum value for the @xmath37 parameter where localization is possible , as predicted by the correspondence conjecture for the simple 1-system .",
    "it turns out that the biological value is @xmath75 , in agreement with this theory .",
    "another agreement with this simple theory is discussed in the numerical section , as the numerical searches never found a localized state with @xmath76 .    for supercritical values of @xmath37 ( @xmath77 ) , the frequency ( quadrature )",
    "is in the lower reactive band for a sufficient large energy .",
    "the frequency of small oscillations ( zero energy ) is easily obtained by expanding hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian1 ] ) to quadratic order , and is @xmath78 the next correction for small energies can be obtained by expanding hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian1 ] ) to fourth order in @xmath79 as@xmath80where the superscript and subscript on @xmath81 refer to the order of the expansion and to the 1-system , respectively .",
    "introducing action - angle variables and using standard canonical perturbation theory @xcite , we find that the normal form of hamiltonian ( [ hami1 ] ) up to second order in the action variable @xmath82 is @xmath83with @xmath84notice that for supercritical values of @xmath37 ( @xmath77 ) , the coefficient @xmath85 as defined by eq .",

    "this determination of the critical energy is compared to the numerical results in the following section , and it turns out to be short by a factor of two .",
    "the explanation for this is that the subsystem consisting of a single oscillator looses a significant amount of energy to the immediate neighbors , such that one could expect a higher critical energy .",
    "it turns out that the value @xmath94 predicted by eq.([ecritical1 ] )  is precisely a factor of two short of the numerical value @xmath95 for any value of @xmath37 .",
    "our simple theory is then seen to be only in qualitative agreement with the numerical calculations .",
    "a better approximation should be given by a subsystem consisting of three particles with fixed ends , which is our next subsystem .",

    "the value @xmath1 estimated from the biological measurements is far from the critical and in a region where localization length is small , such that we predict a robust localization from the above dna model .",
