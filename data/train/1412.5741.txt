    ". the interaction may induce star formation .",
    "they also suggested that the interaction between filaments is caused by compression due to an external effect , e.g. , the shock of nearby supernova remnants .",

    "does not exhibit a clear sheet structure at @xmath78 , as shown in figure  [ colden_f_ht10.eps](d ) .",
    "this is because the amplitude of the colliding flow is considerably lower than the mean velocity of the initial turbulence ( @xmath79 ) .",
    "the low compression due to the colliding flow leads to a long elapsed time for the maximum mass of the sink particles to reach @xmath73 .",

    "the total kinetic energy of gas is therefore evaluated as @xmath84 when @xmath85 .",

    "the rapid decreases in @xmath87 are responsible for the shock waves formed by the colliding flows .",

    "this indicates that self - gravity increases the compressibility of the velocity field .",
    "the high - density models tend to exhibit more rapid increases in @xmath100 than do the low - density models , and this result underscores the differences in freefall times between them .",

    "it is known that the probability distribution function ( pdf ) of density in isothermal turbulent gas without self - gravity is well approximated by a lognormal distribution ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "a deviation of pdfs from the lognormal distribution was also reported by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite for self - gravitational isothermal turbulence . during the evolution ,",
    "the profiles of the low - density tails oscillate around the lognormal distributions .",

    "after star formation begins , the star formation efficiencies increase with a similar trend in all models .",
    "this similar trend indicates that the high - density models have higher accretion rates in total than do the low - density models because the clouds of the high - density models are more massive than those of the low - density models .",

    "we also confirmed that , for sink particles , the velocity dispersion for @xmath148 tends to be smaller than those for @xmath149 and @xmath150 .",
    "the dispersion difference indicates that the gravity of the sheet decelerates the motion of the sink particles along the @xmath76-direction , which is the direction normal to the sheet .",

    "<S> using self - gravitational hydrodynamical numerical simulations , we investigated the evolution of high - density turbulent molecular clouds swept by a colliding flow . the interaction of shock waves due to turbulence produces networks of thin filamentary clouds with a sub - parsec width . </S>",
