    "consider a curved interface between a low - viscosity fluid ( for example , water ) and a high - viscosity fluid ( for example , oil ) in a large horizontal hele - shaw cell .",
    "if the system is unforced , the interface undergoes relaxation by surface tension , ultimately approaching either a straight line , or a circle ( or breaking into several domains which then become circles ) .",
    "this free boundary problem is hard to solve , as the governing equations ( see below ) are non - local .",
    "this is especially true when the interface initially has a complex shape , as observed in numerous experiments when the viscous fluid is displaced by the inviscid fluid in radial geometry , see ref . @xcite and references therein .",
    "the initial shape complexity is caused here by the viscous fingering instability that develops during the preceding _ forced _ stage of the flow @xcite .",
    "the ( strongly ) forced hele - shaw flow is a standard paradigm in fluid dynamics and nonlinear dynamics @xcite .",
    "the ( small ) surface tension there is usually invoked in order to regularize the otherwise singular dynamics on small scales .",
    "we are interested in this paper in an _ unforced _ flow , where surface tension is the _ only _ driving mechanism .",
    "here is the formulation of the unforced hele - shaw ( uhs ) flow model that we will be dealing with throughout this paper .",
    "let one fluid have negligible viscosity , so that the pressure in it is uniform .",
    "the velocity of the viscous fluid is @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the pressure , @xmath15 is the dynamic viscosity , and @xmath16 is the plate spacing @xcite .",
    "therefore , the interface speed is @xmath17 where index @xmath18 denotes the components of the vectors normal to the interface and directed from the inviscid fluid to the viscous fluid , and @xmath19 is evaluated at the corresponding point of the interface @xmath20 .",
    "the viscous fluid is incompressible .",
    "therefore , its pressure is a harmonic function : @xmath21 the gibbs - thomson relation yields a boundary condition at the interface : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is surface tension , and @xmath24 is the local curvature of the interface , positive when the inviscid region is convex outwards",
    ". finally , as the flow is unforced , we demand @xmath25 equations ( [ speed])-([external ] ) define the uhs problem ( see refs . @xcite and references therein for a more detailed discussion ) .",

    "the uhs flow ( [ speed])-([external ] ) is not integrable . moreover , until recently even no _",
    "analytic solutions to this class of flows had been found , except for the simple solutions provided by a linear stability analysis of a single , slightly deformed flat or circular interface @xcite .",
    "recently , some analytic solutions have been obtained for two special initial interface shapes . in the first of them , the inviscid fluid domain at @xmath0 has the form of a half - infinite stripe @xcite .",
    "as time progresses , the tip of the stripe retreats and develops a lobe . at long times , the growing lobe approaches a self - similar shape , whereas the lobe size and retreat distance follow a power law in time with different dynamic exponents : @xmath26 and @xmath27 , respectively .",
    "in the second case the assumed form of the inviscid fluid was a wedge @xcite .",
    "as this initial condition , and eqs .",
    "( [ speed])-([external ] ) , do not introduce any length scale into the problem , the solution is self - similar at _ all _ times , with a single dynamic exponent @xmath12 @xcite . the scale - invariant interface shape in this case is given by the solution of an unusual inverse problem of potential theory .",
    "@xcite solved this problem perturbatively for an almost flat wedge , and numerically for several values of the wedge angle .",
    "the results of refs .",
    "@xcite suggest that the values of dynamic exponents , and other attributes of the self - similar asymptotics , are determined by the initial shape of the retreating edge of the inviscid fluid domain , while the two solutions obtained in refs .",
    "@xcite are particular members of a broader family of solutions . the results of the present paper confirm this scenario .",
    "we consider here a more general , power - law shape @xmath1 , where @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 , and show that , for _ any _ @xmath3 , the relaxation dynamics exhibit self - similar intermediate asymptotics : a late - time asymptotics for @xmath28 and an early - time asymptotics for @xmath6 . the retreat distance and the lobe size show , for any @xmath8 , a power law behavior in time with exponents and pre - factors uniquely determined by @xmath8 .",
    "the case of @xmath7 , investigated in ref .",

    "surprisingly , at @xmath9 the interface shape , rescaled to the local maximum elevation of the interface , turns out to be universal ( that is , independent of @xmath8 ) in the similarity region .",

    "we report the results of a numerical solution of ( [ speed])-([external ] ) for the cases of @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 , compare them with our theoretical predictions and report the universality of the rescaled interface shape .",

    "the presence of the decreasing asymptote @xmath116 implies that , for any @xmath118 , the shape function @xmath119 must have a local maximum .",
    "once we obtained the solution , we can check it for self - consistency with all the assumptions we made .",
    "first , it can be easily checked that , in the scaling regime @xmath120 ( for @xmath10 ) or @xmath107 ( for @xmath6 ) we have @xmath121 , as we assumed .",
    "now , the lobe area @xmath122 grows with time as @xmath123 .",
    "this value is indeed much less than @xmath124 in the scaling regime .",
    "furthermore , the time - dependent interface elevation in the lobe region @xmath125 is much larger , in the scaling regime , than the initial interface elevation at the moving tip , which is @xmath126 .",
    "this strong inequality serves as a necessary condition for the assumed similarity asymptotics ( [ ansatz ] ) as a leading order description .",
    "in order to test the predicted dynamic exponents @xmath53 and @xmath54 and verify the presence of the self - similar regime , we solved the problem numerically for three different values of parameter @xmath8 .",
    "in addition , we returned to the case of @xmath7 , previously considered in ref .",
    "@xcite , and solved it numerically for small values of the wedge angle .",
    "our numerical algorithm @xcite employs a variant of the boundary integral method for an exterior dirichlet problem formulated for a singly connected domain , and explicit tracking of the contour nodes .",
    "the harmonic potential is represented as a potential produced by a dipole distribution with an _ a priori _ unknown density @xmath127 on the contour .",
    "the dipole density @xmath127 is found numerically from an integral equation which is a modification of the well - known jump relation of the potential theory @xcite .",
    "computing another integral of this ( already found ) dipole density , one obtains the harmonic conjugate function , whose derivative along the contour yields , by virtue of the cauchy theorem , the normal velocity of the interface .",
    "we used a piecewise constant function for a discrete approximation of @xmath127 and a piecewise linear function for discretizing the interface .",
    "the integral entering the integral equation is represented as a sum of @xmath127 multiplied by a kernel which is integrated analytically between two neighboring nodes .",
    "this approximation was previously suggested for the inner problem @xcite .",
    "we found that it is also efficient in the outer problem in the following cases : ( i ) for a long and slender domain , ( ii ) in the vicinity of the cusp at @xmath6 , and ( iii ) for a wedge ( @xmath7 ) with a small angle .",
    "the numerical approximation is described in detail in ref .",
    "the method requires an inhomogeneous grid with a small spacing in regions of high curvature of the contour , and we used a grid with spacing exponentially growing with the distance from the interface s tip .",
    "the number of grid nodes was reduced as the interface s perimeter decreased , and the curvature radius of the tip increased .",
    "the shape of the numerical interface at @xmath0 is determined by the following parameters : the exponent @xmath8 , the domain size @xmath128 , and the cutoff parameter @xmath129 that was used for @xmath130 , see below .",
    "one quarter of the interface is represented as a graph @xmath131 , where @xmath132 .",
    "the second quarter is obtained by reflecting this graph with respect to the @xmath88-axis .",
    "then , by reflecting the two branches with respect to the @xmath133-axis , we obtained the closed interface we worked with . in this manner",
    "we could exploit the four - fold symmetry of the domains and achieve a four - fold reduction in the number of algebraic equations , approximating the integral equation . for @xmath134 ,",
    "the tip is smooth , and we took @xmath135 . for @xmath6",
    "there is a cusp at @xmath136 that our numerical method can not handle .",
    "a similar difficulty arises for @xmath7 if the wedge angle is very small .",
    "a positive @xmath137 allows one to employ the method , if the node spacing in the cutoff region is less than @xmath138 .",
    "we measured the retreat distance of the tip @xmath51 and the interface shape at different rimes for three values of @xmath8 : @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 , and also for three different wedge angles for @xmath7 . in the process of relaxation ,",
    "each of these domains ultimately becomes a perfect circle .",
    "therefore , to observe the self - similar asymptotics we performed the measurements at times much shorter than the characteristic time of relaxation toward a circle .",
    "in addition , to minimize the influence of other tips , we performed the measurements sufficiently close to a chosen tip ( at distances much smaller than the distance between the chosen tip and the neighboring tip ) .",
    "these two limitations are especially relevant at @xmath134 , where theory predicts self - similarity at sufficiently long times . on the contrary , at @xmath6 we performed the measurements at very short times . here",
    "the main limitation comes from the presence of the cutoff , which necessitates a sufficiently long  waiting time \" so that the influence of the cutoff on the solution can be neglected .    for @xmath32 we took @xmath139 and the minimum node spacing @xmath140 .",
    "the spacing increased exponentially with the distance from the tip , and the initial number of nodes was @xmath141 ( here and in the following  per quarter of the interface ) .",
    "for @xmath142 we chose @xmath143 , @xmath144 and the initial number of nodes @xmath145 .",

    "the time step was chosen to be @xmath163 times the maximum of the ratio of the interface curvature radius and the interface speed at the same node .",
    "this choice of numerical parameters was dictated by the fact that , at @xmath5 , we were interested in a long - time behavior , whereas at @xmath6 we needed to focus on very earlier times , in order to observe the predicted self - similarity and scalings .",
