    "cold dark matter has become the paradigm for explaining observations of large scale structure of the universe .",
    "flat cosmological models composed of cold dark matter ( cdm ) and a cosmological constant ( or quintessence ) combined with a nearly scale - invariant , adiabatic spectrum of density fluctuations produce excellent fits to observed structure on large ( @xmath5mpc ) scales @xcite .",
    "this class of models - collectively labeled as @xmath6cdm   - has received substantial additional support from the recent cosmological observations of supernovae at high redshift @xcite and the fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background @xcite . the nature and",
    "properties of the dark matter remain unknown , however , and present one of the greatest challenges of current cosmological research .",
    "a recent suggestion by @xcite that observations on galactic and subgalactic scales offer unique clues regarding the properties of the dark matter has attracted much attention .",
    "the basic argument is that the `` standard '' cdm models , where dark matter particles are assumed to interact only through gravity , may be in conflict with some observed features on smaller ( @xmath7mpc ) scales . in particular , cdm models @xcite tend to predict density profiles of dark matter halos which are cuspy and have central densities of 1 @xmath8  and larger , whereas observations of dwarf and low surface brightness galaxies seem to favor the presence of a relatively flat core , with typical densities of @xmath9@xmath8  @xcite .",
    "other apparent discrepancies from the simulations of cdm are that they tend to predict : a ) more than ten times as many dwarf galaxies as are observed for the local group , b ) disks which are small and have too little angular momentum , c ) triaxial clusters instead of relatively spherical ones ; see @xcite for discussion and references .",
    "the thrust of the suggestion by @xcite is that these possible discrepancies may be alleviated if dark matter particles have some additional type of interaction , besides gravity , that affects structure formation only on these smaller scales .",
    "the physical requirement for such `` self - interacting dark matter '' ( sidm ) is that on the smaller scales , the typical density of dark matter particles is large enough so that interactions have a nonnegligible effect , while on large scales the probability of interactions is low enough so that the favorable properties of cdm vis a vis observed structure are maintained .",
    "@xcite speculated that if the dark matter particles scatter off one another through this interaction , the entropy of their phase space must increase while their trajectories will become isotropic rather than radial , processes which will lead to a dark matter core with a shallower density profile .",
    "the ansatz is that a dark matter particle in a typical galactic halo should undergo several collisions per hubble time to achieve such halo structure .",
    "since the relevant mean free path is @xmath10kpc and typical dark matter densities ( e.g , in the solar neighborhood ) are @xmath11 , the cross section for sidm is required to lie in the range @xmath12@xmath13  ( where @xmath14@xmath15  @xmath16@xmath13  ) .",
    "later , @xcite concluded from numerical simulations that the preferred range for the cross section is about @xmath17@xmath15  .",
    "interestingly , this coincides with the range of typical low energy hadronic physics , implying that a natural candidate for a sidm particle could be a light , supersymmetric hadron @xcite .",
    "following the suggestion by @xcite , several numerical studies of sidm were conducted via n - body simulations , amended to include a monte - carlo algorithms for particle - particle scattering . @xcite and @xcite examined sidm structure formation in a universe with an initial density fluctuation spectrum . @xcite and @xcite studied the evolution on a single , isolated halo , with initial conditions based on the @xcite model , which describes a noninteracting cdm halo ( this choice is probably inappropriate for sidm - see below , and also in dav@xmath18 et al .",
    "while there is significant disagreement about whether various aspects of the results are favorable for the sidm model , the general trend in the n - body simulations is that the centers of halos do indeed become flatter with lower densities with respect to standard @xmath6cdm  models .    in this work",
    "we revisit the issue of the density profile of a sidm halo by studying the evolution of such a halo via a gravothermal fluid approximation . in the gravothermal approach ,",
    "the ensemble of gravitating particles is approximated as a fluid in quasi - static virial equilibrium .",
    "the effective temperature is identified with the square of the one dimensional velocity dispersion , and thermal heat conduction is employed to reflect the manner in which orbital motion and scattering combine to transfer energy in the system .",
    "this formalism was originally introduced for the study of globular star clusters ( see , e.g , reviews by lightman & shapiro 1978 and spitzer 1987 ) , and has proven to be very successful in understanding the evolution of these systems @xcite .",
    "this agreement comes about despite the fact that star clusters are only weakly collisional and have long collision mean free paths greatly exceeding the size of the cluster , and thermalization is achieved by the cumulative effect of repeated distant , small - angle , gravitational ( coulomb ) encounters .",
    "in fact , the gravothermal fluid description is much better suited to sidm halos where the thermalizing particle interactions are close encounter , large - angle ( hard sphere ) scatterings .",
    "it is reassuring , nevertheless , that even in the case of weakly collisional systems like star clusters , the gravothermal fluid model does reproduce many of the results found from more fundamental analyses of the collisional boltzmann equation , with collisions treated in the fokker - planck approximation @xcite .",
    "an isolated self - gravitating cluster of particles in virial equilibrium will relax via collisions to a state consisting of an extended halo with a shallow temperature gradient , surrounding a hotter , central core region . as time advances , the core transfers mass and energy through the flow of particles and heat to the extended halo .",
    "the thermal evolution timescale of the dense core is much shorter than that of the extended halo , which essentially serves as a static heat sink .",
    "as the core evolves it shrinks in size and mass , while its density and temperature grow .",
    "increase of central temperature induces further heat transfer to the halo , leading to a _",
    "instability on a thermal ( collisional relaxation ) timescale .",
    "the secular evolution of the core towards infinite density and temperature but zero mass is known as `` gravothermal collapse '' or the `` gravothermal catastrophe '' ( lynden - bell & wood 1968 ; see reviews in lightman and shapiro 1978 and spitzer 1987 ) .",
    "a critical modification to the gravothermal scenario is that a _ dynamical _ instability occurs when the particle velocities in the core , or , equivalently , when the central potential , becomes relativistic .",
    "it is well known that fluid stars ( i.e.  highly collisional gases ) in hydrostatic equilibrium are unstable to radial collapse on a dynamical timescale when they are sufficiently compact and relativistic .",
    "@xcite originally conjectured and shapiro and teukolsky ( 1985a , b , 1986 ) subsequently demonstrated that collisionless gases in virial equilibrium also experience a radial instability to collapse on dynamical timescales when their cores are sufficiently relativistic . in either case",
    ", this dynamically instability will terminate the epoch of secular gravothermal contraction and will lead to the catastrophic collapse of a _ finite _ mass core , which must end as a black hole .",
    "simulations of the catastrophic collapse of relativistic collisionless clusters have been performed recently , in part to explore the possibility of creating the supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) inferred to exist in most galaxies and quasars @xcite ; see @xcite for a review .    in the case of globular star clusters and gravitational scattering ,",
    "multiple , distant , small - angle scattering events dominate over the very rare , close encounter , large - angle scatterings until the core is very dense @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that the last stage of secular core collapse , when large - angle scatterings in the core are not negligible , does not differ significantly from the earlier stages . as we demonstrate below , for sidm there is also a transition between two evolutionary stages , but in this case the difference is very significant .",
    "these two stages are best described by distinguishing between two limits : + _ the long mean free path ( lmfp ) limit . _",
    "if the typical distance a particle travels between collisions is much longer than the gravitational scale height at the particle s position , it orbits the cluster center many times unperturbed before being scattered . for typical parameters , the low - density ,",
    "extended halo of a thermalized sidm system will reside in the lmfp regime , while the core may or may not . if the core is in the lmfp regime , a particle can escape from the core following a single encounter with another particle , since momentum transfer in these large - angle encounters is appreciable .",
    "the entire volume of the core can then participate in heat and mass transfer .",
    "+ _ the short mean free path ( smfp ) limit .",
    "_ if the core is dense enough , its size may be comparable or even exceed the mean free path between collisions .",
    "when the mean free path is much smaller than the gravitational scale height , particle motion in the core is constrained by multiple collisions .",
    "in particular , heat conduction is obviously less efficient , and transfer of energy and mass from the core to the halo is limited to a surface effect at the edge of the core . as demonstrated below ,",
    "even if a sidm halo is formed initially with a core in the lmfp regime , gravothermal evolution will cause the central density to increase and ultimately drive the core to a smfp state .",
    "we also show that in this smfp limit , mass loss from the dense core is severely reduced with respect to a lmfp core .    in this paper",
    "we apply the gravothermal model to study the evolution of an isolated , spherical halo of sidm .",
    "although this is clearly a simplified description omitting many of the details of structure formation ( mergers , accretion , angular momentum transfer , baryon content ) , our approach offers a simple tool for assessing the sidm proposal , and provides some new predictions regarding the evolution and late - time gravothermal collapse of such a system .",
    "the model also provides physical insight for interpreting the results of more detailed n - body simulations , and serves as a probe for studying details of the core profile not easily resolved by these simulations and the late - time behavior whose diagnosis is beyond their current reach .    in   [",
    "sect : times ] we estimate relaxation timescales characterizing typical sidm halos and compare them with those of globular star clusters . in ",
    "[ sect : gtevolve ] we outline the gravothermal formalism .",
    "the results of our sidm halo evolution calculation are presented in sections  [ sect : selfsim ] and [ sect : hydro ] .",
    "we first show in   [ sect : selfsim ] that in the lmfp limit there exists a self - similar solution for the halo evolution , equivalent to the @xcite homology solution for star clusters .",
    "then , in   [ sect : hydro ] we perform a time - dependent gravothermal numerical calculation to examine the full evolution , including the later stages where the core moves into the smfp regime .",
    "we briefly compare our results with previous n - body simulations in ",
    "[ sect : nbody ] , and present our conclusions and a discussion in   [ sect : conc ] .",
    "in a globular star cluster , the thermal relaxation time due to multiple , small - angle , gravitational ( coulomb ) encounters is given by ( see , e.g. , lightman and shapiro 1978 and spitzer 1987 ) @xmath19 in equation  ( [ eq : t_rgc ] ) @xmath20 is the number of stars , @xmath21 is their mass , @xmath22 is their number density , and @xmath23 is the stellar velocity dispersion , related to the total cluster mass @xmath24 and the half - mass radius , @xmath25 by the virial relation @xmath26 . in typical virialized star clusters ,",
    "the ratio of collision mean free path to local system scale height @xmath2 everywhere satisfies the strong inequality @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the local crossing or dynamical timescale . as a result of this inequality ,",
    "these systems are only weakly collisional , satisfying the collisionless boltzmann ( vlasov ) equation to high approximation as they evolve quasistatically on relaxation timescales . for typical globular cluster parameters ,",
    "the relaxation time is significantly shorter than the cluster age ( @xmath29 yrs ) , hence all clusters are well thermalized . indeed",
    "the timescale for gravothermal core collapse to a singular state in such systems satisfies @xmath30 @xcite and is comparable to typical cluster ages , so that many , initially dense clusters are likely to have undergone complete gravothermal collapse @xcite .    in an sidm halo where thermalization is due to close , large - angle interactions , the relaxation time is the mean time between single collisions . for a cross section per unit mass @xmath31 ,",

    "the constant @xmath35 is typcially of order unity ; specifically , @xmath36 for particles interacting elastically like billard balls ( hard spheres ) with a maxwell - boltzmann velocity distribution ( reif 1965 , eqs .  ( 7.10.3 ) , ( 12.2.8 ) and ( 12.2.12 ) ) .",
    "as discussed below , for a typical sidm halo , the ratio @xmath37 is likely to be @xmath38 at formation throughout the halo ; with evolution , this ratio does not change much in the halo , but ultimately drops well below unity in the central core . at this point",
    "the system consists of a fluid core surrounded by a weakly collisional extended halo . by construction ,",
    "the typical sidm halo relaxation time is smaller than a hubble time , enabling the system to thermalize .",
    "we show below that a typical halo has a gravothermal collapse time @xmath39 .",
    "accordingly , halos forming in the present epoch are in no danger of collapsing , but halos formed earlier at high and moderate redshift may have already undergone gravothermal collapse .",
    "the assumption of hard sphere interactions adopted here provides the simplest description of dark matter particle interactions and is the basis of most n - body studies to date .",
    "however , more complex interactions , characterized by cross sections which may be energy dependent and/or non - elastic , are also possible and may yield different evolutionary tracks than the ones we will derive .",
    "the fundamental equations describing a spherical , virialized gravothermal fluid are mass conservation , hydrostatic equilibrium , an energy flux equation and the first law of thermodynamics .",
    "the latter equation is time - dependent and drives the quasistaticevolution . denoting @xmath40 as the mass enclosed by radius @xmath41 , @xmath42 as the density , @xmath43 as the one - dimensional velocity dispersion and @xmath44 as the luminosity through a sphere at @xmath41 , these equations are ( lynden - bell & eggleton 1980 ) : @xmath45 @xmath46 @xmath47 @xmath48 we can define a pressure , @xmath49 , which appears in the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium , and a temperature @xmath50 which appears in the flux equation ; here @xmath21 is the particle mass .",

    "increase , decreasing the ratio @xmath37 .",
    "now the core density increases much faster with time than the core temperature ( @xmath64 , see below ) .",
    "hence , a nonrelativistic core will enter the smfp regime well before gravothermal contraction drives it to a relativistic state and dynamical collapse .",
    "therefore , late in the evolution of a sidm halo , its core will be in the smfp regime , while the extended halo will remain in the lmfp regime and some transition region must exist between the two .",
    "the equations ( [ eq : mass ] , [ eq : hydstat ] , [ eq : firstlaw ] and [ eq : flux_eq ] ) describe the evolution of a spherical , isolated halo of sidm .",
    "these equations define a time - dependent diffusion problem , which we solve numerically in the next section",
    ". however , it is useful and instructive to examine first a self - similar solution which can be found for these equations in the lmfp limit , following the original derivation of @xcite for globular clusters .    if the entire halo is sufficiently dilute so that @xmath58 everywhere , then @xmath65 can be neglected with respect to @xmath66 in the square brackets in equation ( [ eq : flux_eq ] )",
    "this lmfp regime admits a self - similar solution which can be obtained by separating variables into time and space components as follows : @xmath67 the time - dependent functions give the values of the core parameters at time @xmath68 .",
    "the dimensionless spatial profiles denoted by the asterik ( @xmath69 ) are related by a set of ordinary differential equations , found by substituting equation  ( [ eq : separate ] ) into the four equations  ( [ eq : mass]-[eq : firstlaw ] ) : @xmath70 \\label{eq : firstnod}\\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the constants @xmath71 and @xmath72 are two eigenvalues of the equations .",
    "the system of four equations plus two eigenvalues is uniquely determined by specifying six boundary conditions .",
    "four of these conditions apply to the origin , where @xmath73 and the other two conditions arise from the requirement that the extended halo remains practically static over the evolution of the core , so that it may be treated as infinite .",
    "the mass and energy of the extended halo are then also infinite , eliminating any scale to the problem and ensuring the existence of a self - similar solution .",
    "the consequence of this condition on the extended halo is that its density profile must tend asymptotically toward a power law of the form @xmath74 @xcite . indeed",
    "the condition of self - similarity automatically yields the relation @xmath75 @xcite .",
    "the asymptotic outer boundary conditions then arise from equations  ( [ eq : mnod ] , [ eq : fluxnod ] ) and are @xmath76    the above derivation is almost identical to the derivation of the self - similar solution for star clusters by @xcite .",
    "the sole difference is the form of the flux equation ( [ eq : fluxnod ] ) , since for sidm @xmath77 , whereas for globular clusters @xmath78 .",
    "we solved the coupled set of odes for the nondimensional profiles by relaxation on a finite mesh @xcite , and the solution is shown in figure  [ fig : selfsimfig ] . a key feature of the solution is the existence of a core - halo structure : the finite core is nearly isothermal and homogeneous , while the infinite halo is characterized by declining power - law profiles for the density , velocity and luminosity .",
    "note that the luminosity peaks at the outer edge of the core ( @xmath79 ) , reflecting the shorter evolutionary ( cooling ) timescale ( @xmath80 ) in this region .",
    "a fundamental feature of the self - similar solution is that the eigenvalues @xmath71 and @xmath72 completely define the time - dependent evolution in terms of @xmath81 .",
    "we can define an initial core radius @xmath82 and mass , and @xmath83 and follow their time dependence as well . delineating the precise core boundary for the self - similar density profile plotted in figure  [ fig : selfsimfig ] is somewhat arbitrary .",
    "we will employ the king radius @xcite , where @xmath84 and then define @xmath85 . typically , the density at the king radius is about @xmath86 of the central density",
    ".    the time - dependent evolution can be parameterized by a single variable @xmath87 , which is defined through @xmath88 @xcite where @xmath89 is the total energy of the core .",

    "this is mostly due to the fact that the allowed range of the parameters is quite small .",
    "specifically , the exponent @xmath91 must reside between @xmath115 , which corresponds to an isothermal profile , and @xmath116 which corresponds to a constant core energy ( see lynden - bell & eggleton 1980 for a discussion of this allowed range ) . in star clusters ,",
    "transfer of particles from the core to the extended halo is a diffusive process , so the average change in specific energy should indeed be smaller than in sidm systems , where a particle can be ejected from the core by a single collision .",
    "hence , the star cluster values set an upper ( lower ) limit on the value of @xmath91 ( @xmath87 ) for the sidm case , as is borne out by the actual solution .",
    "an immediate consequence is that the density of dark matter in an isolated , extended halo of an sidm system should maintain the profile @xmath117 .",
    "such a power law is not inconsistent with halo profiles previously found with n - body simulations for sidm . in the same way , the predictions of the self - similar gravothermal model for star clusters",
    "have been confirmed by detailed integrations of the fokker - planck equation @xcite .",
    "the result for @xmath87 corresponds to the core mass evolving with velocity according to the relation @xmath118 .",
    "the core of a lmfp sidm halo must lose more than @xmath119 of its mass in order to increase its central temperature by one order of magnitude .",
    "assuming that the core is initially nonrelativistic , it must increase its central temperature by a factor of , say , @xmath120 to reach the relativistic instability , in which case only a tiny fraction of the initial core mass will be available for the black hole that arises from the final catastrophic collapse .",
    "we show in   [ sect : hydro ] below how this conclusion is drastically modified once the core enters the smfp regime .",
    "one key issue concerning galaxy formation is how the collapse time compares with typical ages of galaxies .",
    "according to table 1 , a lmfp sidm system has a lifetime of about @xmath121 before undergoing secular core collapse .",
    "this ratio @xmath122 is somewhat smaller than in the star cluster case , because of the greater efficiency of energy transfer in clusters as reflected in the value of @xmath53 .",
    "the cumulative effect of multiple gravitational scatterings in the star cluster case gives @xmath123 @xcite , whereas for hard sphere collisions in sidm systems , we have @xmath124 . the typical density of dark matter inferred for flat - density cores is @xmath125@xmath8  ( @xmath126gm@xmath127  ) @xcite , so for @xmath128@xmath129  the collapse time exceeds ten hubble times ( for @xmath130@xmath15  ) .",
    "consequently , sidm is consistent with the existence of relaxed , flat - core density profiles in present day halos .",
    "furthermore , the functional forms of equations  ( [ eq : dlogdlogm_c ] ) and  ( [ eq : mcollapse ] ) show that throughout most of the evolution , the core hardly changes : at @xmath131 the central density will have increased only by a factor of @xmath132 .",
    "currently existing flat - density cores should exhibit central densities similar to those they acquired at virialization .",
    "we now return to a full time - dependent , numerical solution of the evolution equations of   [ sect : gtevolve ] , without assuming self - similarity or restricting ourselves to the lmfp regime .",
    "the numerical approach is not only useful for confirming the self - similar solution , but it is essential for studying the evolution of the core in the smfp limit , which it must eventually reach . late in its life ( shortly before @xmath133 ) , the core becomes sufficiently dense and hot that @xmath37 falls below unity and the evolution deviates from the self - similar solution .",
    "this final stage will be dominated by the thermal evolution of a genuine fluid core , which cools , contracts and ultimately becomes dynamically unstable to relativistic collapse to a black hole .",

    "hereafter we drop all tildes but report results in terms of these dimensionless variables .",
    "we solved this time - dependent diffusion problem numerically by taking alternative diffusion and hydrostatic - equilibrium steps .",
    "time dependence is followed through equation  ( [ eq : evoldiff ] ) , and after each successful time step the profile is adjusted to maintain hydrostatic equilibrium . since the dynamical time scale of the system is much shorter than the thermal time , hydrostatic equilibrium is solved by keeping the entropy of each lagrangian zone fixed , while its position and other thermodynamic properties are modified . the effect of the sidm collisions is examined by varying the value of the combination @xmath145 . in principle",
    "such a ( newtonian ) calculation can be carried out all the way to collapse , but in practice maintaining numerical accuracy requires constantly refining spatial and temporal resolution , which ultimately limits the dynamic range of the calculation .",
    "reasonable accuracy can be maintained until to @xmath150 a few tens , at which point theb integration time step become excessively small .",

    "the initial profile is marked by the thicker line , and in the other profiles larger central densities correspond to later times .",
    "the self - similar structure is clearly maintained throughout the evolution , as the core contracts in size and mass , while the extended halo remains largely unchanged .",
    "numerically we find that the density in the extended halo falls as @xmath152 , corresponding to a value of @xmath153 .",
    "the quantitative fit to the self - similar solution is very good , as is the fit for the function @xmath154 and other quantities ( see below ) .",
    "we now consider our results for @xmath155 , whereby the core eventually evolves into the smfp regime .",
    "figure  [ fig : rhosnap0.01 ] shows snapshots of the density profile for a calculation with @xmath156 ; the profiles are labeled according to the value of @xmath37 ( in units of @xmath157 ) at the center . at early times , when @xmath158 everywhere , the profiles are identical to those in figure  [ fig : rhosnaplng ] , but as the core density and temperature increase , the density profile gradually deviates from the self similar solution .",
    "some difference is already observable when @xmath159 , and when the core has @xmath160 the density profile has obviously taken a new form .",
    "in fact , what was originally the core during the lmfp stage of the evolution has fragmented into two components : a dense inner core which continues to evolve , and an outer region with a lower , roughly uniform density , which connects to the extended halo .",
    "this outer core is also almost static while the inner core continues to contract with time .",
    "the existence of the double core structure is even more pronounced when examining the evolution as a function of the mass coordinate . in figure",
    "[ fig : snaprhot_m ] we show snapshots of the density and temperature profiles for @xmath156 ( the times of the snapshots are not necessarily identical between the two frames ) .",
    "the inner core develops a fairly sharp `` edge '' , which becomes more distinct as the evolution progresses .",
    "the nature of this inner core can be understood from the @xmath161 and @xmath162 profiles at the late stages of the evolution .",
    "these are shown in figure  [ fig : tlhlam_last ] ( along with @xmath163 ) for the last profile of figure  [ fig : snaprhot_m ] .",
    "the inner core forms in the region where @xmath164 , and heat conduction is dominated by classical diffusion with a short mean free path .",
    "its edge corresponds to a transition region where @xmath165 and where the luminosity peaks .",
    "the inner core resembles a fluid star composed of a nonrelativistic , nearly isothermal and homogeneous gas undergoing thermal cooling , surrounded by a thin , exponential envelope .",
    "the outer part of the core is the remnant of the original core in the lmfp limit .",
    "this outer core then connects smoothly to the extended halo , and barely evolves with time as the inner core contracts .",
    "an important aspect of the composite core is that the outer region holds most of the mass , and therefore acts as a heat sink to the inner region , which continues to evolve as its outer layers cool .",
    "the inner core loses mass as it continues to contract .",
    "gravothermal collapse is slowed down with respect to a lmfp regime , where particles orbit outside the core for many scale heights ; in a smfp core , mass and heat loss are now confined to the surface where @xmath166 .",
    "a slight temperature inversion is created in the outer core , which corresponds to a region of negative ( although very small in magnitude ) luminosity .",
    "the timescale for heat conduction in the outer core is much longer , however , than the thermal time of the inner core , so the details of the outer core temperature profile are unimportant for the gravothermal evolution .",
    "the value of the cross section , @xmath167 , determines the evolutionary track of the sidm halo as its core contracts .",
    "the deviation from the self - similar solution will begin earlier ( at lower central densities and temperatures ) for larger @xmath167 ; see equation  ( [ eq : flux_eq ] ) .",
    "a larger cross section also reduces the efficiency of heat conduction , since the conductivity scales as @xmath168 .",
    "these effects are demonstrated in figure  [ fig : rhos_ts ] , which presents the time dependence of the central density of a sidm halo for different values of @xmath145 . in all cases",
    "the initial conditions are the self - similar solution . in the extreme lmfp limit ( @xmath151 )",
    ", the collapse time appears to be @xmath169 , in good agreement with the prediction of the self - similar solution ( assuming @xmath170 ) . with a finite @xmath145",
    "the late - time evolution is slower ( requires more relaxation times ) , as expected , and the delay of the late - time evolution is more pronounced for larger values of the cross section .",
    "a finite value of the cross section introduces a scale into the problem which precludes a simple , self- similar solution for the evolution of the double core and extended halo structure . for example , we show in figure  [ fig : rhoc_vc ] the relation between central density and central temperatures for calculations with different @xmath145 .",
    "the details of the evolution depend on the value of @xmath167 : there is no universal @xmath171 relation .",
    "we note in passing that even if the entire system ( core and extended halo ) were in the smfp limit , a self similar solution with a power law density profile can not exist : the thermal time scale in the core would be longer than that in the halo , causing the system to be unstable @xcite .                    the most significant effect caused by the the transition of the inner core into a strongly collisional",
    "fluid is a critical reduction of the rate of mass loss from the core .",
    "we demonstrate this in figure  [ fig : mc_tc ] , which shows the core mass as a function of the central temperature for the different cases . in the lmfp phase ,",
    "the core mass follows a power law with @xmath172 , in agreement with a value of @xmath173 ( see eq .  ( [ eq : dlogdlogm_c ] ) ) . when @xmath155 , the mass loss rate is appreciably reduced for the smfp inner core : instead of a steep power law , the core mass nearly saturates while the central temperature increases . as a consequence ,",
    "the core mass at the onset of relativistic instability should be much larger than would be expected from the self - similar solution in the lmfp limit .",
    "while strict self - similarity is broken once the inner core enters the smfp regime , there does seem to exist some power - law correspondance for the evolutionary tracks of the central values of some of the physical parameters .",
    "empirically , we find that the function @xmath174 ( in units of @xmath175 ) tends to converge to a single track as a function of central temperature ; this convergence is also shown in figure  [ fig : mc_tc ] .",
    "the consequences of relativistic instability in the inner core depend on the collisional nature of the gas at the onset of instability .",
    "for example , when a _ fluid _ star is unstable to radial collapse on a dynamical timescale , it undergoe catastrophic collapse in which the entire star ( core + halo ) forms a black hole ( see , eg .",
    "shapiro & teukolsky 1980 ) .",
    "by contrast , when a _ collisionless _ cluster of particles with a core - halo structure is unstable to radial collapse , it is essentially the core alone and its immediate surroundings that undergoes catastrophic collapse ( shapiro & teukolsky 1986,1992 ) . particles in the halo outside the core constitute the bulk of the matter and continue to orbit the central black hole , forming a new , dynamically stable , equilibrium system consisting of a central black hole and a massive , extended halo of orbiting particles .",
    "when a sidm cluster becomes sufficiently relativistic in the inner core it too must be subject to relativistic instability to collapse , as in the two extreme opposite cases described above . at the onset of collapse ,",
    "the inner core acts as a fluid system ( @xmath176 ) while the exterior region behaves as a collisionless gas ( @xmath177 ) , at least on dynamical timescales .",
    "this bifurcation is evident in figure  [ fig : tlhlam_last ] .",
    "the key consequence is that we expect the entire inner core of a sidm cluster to undergo collapse to a black hole , while the region outside the inner core relaxes to a dynamically stable equilibrium system of particles that continue to orbit the central hole .",
    "thus the relevant mass to consider for dynamical collapse and black hole formation is the inner core , or , more specifically the region in which the matter satisfies @xmath178 and behaves as a fluid .",
    "the matter inside will all collapse and the matter outside this region will reach a stable equilibrium state outside the central black hole , at least on dynamical timescales .",
    "subsequent interactions between particles in this ambient region will ultimately fuel the central hole , causing it to grow on relaxation timescales @xcite .",
    "the same effect drives the secular growth of black holes immersed in ambient star clusters , a problem that has been well studied by detailed fokker - planck calculations ( bahcall & wolf 1976 , frank & rees 1976 , lightman and shapiro 1977 , cohn & kulsrud 1978 , marchant & shapiro 1980 ; see shapiro 1985 for a review and references ) .",
    "it is the catastrophic collapse of the inner ( fluid ) core of a sidm cluster which naturally provides the initial seed black hole .",
    "the @xmath179 vs. @xmath180 relation for the late - time inner core evolution determines the mass of the core at the time of relativistic instability .",
    "here we infer that relation by a combination of physical reasoning and extraplolaton from our numerical integrations for earlier epochs into the relativistic regime .",
    "because energy and mass transfer from the smfp inner core are limited to surface phenomenon , the relative rates of these processes must remain significantly reduced with respect to the lmfp core . in equation  ( [ eq : zeta ] ) , the typical absolute value of @xmath87 during the late time evolution of the inner core must be close to zero , since only a small fraction of the inner core energy is transferred to the outer core .",
    "if @xmath181 then we have @xmath182 : hence , at late times the inner core will lose about one order of magnitude in mass for every order of magnitude it gains in central central temperature ( note that @xmath87 can not be identically zero , as this value corresponds to no evolution whatsover ) .",
    "we can calibrate this prediction for the late - time @xmath179 vs. @xmath180 relation by calculating the value of @xmath87 numerically using equation  ( [ eq : dlogdlogm_c ] ) . in figure  [ fig : zetak ]",
    "we show the corresponding estimates of @xmath183 , using the results shown in figure  [ fig : mc_tc ] .",
    "the deviation of the time - dependent value of @xmath87 from the constant value of 0.766 found for the lmfp limit is clear and reflects the formation of the smfp inner core . during its formation , the +        mass of inner core is almost constant while its density and temperature profiles are adjusted , and so @xmath87 decreases to a minimum ( negative ) value .",
    "however , once the inner core is sufficiently dense , mass is continuously lost from its surface as outer layers cool and expand to join the outer core .",
    "the resulting value of @xmath87 starts to increase again , and is still rising when the calculations are terminated .",
    "we find that due to the sensitivity of the core mass to the details of the density profile at the edge of the inner core , it is preferable to estimate the asymptotic trend of @xmath87 by a more robust definition of the core mass . in the context of the double core structure where the inner region is collisional ( fluid ) ,",
    "the transition point where @xmath184 provides a more appropriate definition for the `` edge '' . in figure",
    "[ fig : zetah ] we again show the numerical estimate of @xmath87 , this time when the core mass corresponds to the radial position where @xmath184 ( which only exisits after a smfp core is formed ) .",
    "again we see that for all cases @xmath87 is increasing from a transient stage of @xmath185 , and seems to settle asymptotically in the range @xmath186 .",
    "we expect that this trend is indeed representative of the typical value of @xmath87 in the case of a smfp core at high central temperatures .",
    "our prediction is , therefore , that once a smfp inner core is completely formed , the final stages of its evolution will be characterized by @xmath187 .",
    "the inner core mass will therefore decrease by only about one order of magnitude for every order of magnitude that its central temperature increases .    finally , our inability to integrate the full system of equations `` forever '' does not prevent us from estimating the the collapse time , @xmath133 .",
    "in the lmfp regime , the collapse time is always @xmath188 times the instantaneous relaxation time . at the time at which the numerical simulations are halted ,",
    "the smfp inner core relaxation time is typically @xmath189 times shorter than the initial core relaxation time .",
    "consequently , the total time to collapse from @xmath94 is dominated by the early evolution of the lmfp core and extended halo system . the additional time to collapse once the inner core enters",
    "the smfp regime is considerably shorter .",
    "our analysis of sidm evolution via a gravothermal fluid approach is an alternative to n - body simulations . in general , mean - field n - body codes have the advantage that they avoid having to adopt an approximate , fluid - like set of equations to describe sidm .",
    "however , the spatial resolution of n - body codes is severly limited by the total number of particles they are able to follow .",
    "large numbers of particles , required for high resolution , can be tracked only for restricted integration times , and this limitation prohibits n - body simulations from following the evolution of sidm halos for many relaxation timescales .",
    "previous n - body calculations focussing on the same problem tackled here @xcite also found that introducing collisions in the dark matter interactions leads to the formation of a flatter core , as opposed to the cdm prediction of a cuspy core ( with @xmath190 , and @xmath191 in navarro et al .",
    "1997 or @xmath192 in moore et al .",
    "previous simulations of time - dependent evolution also confirm the general trend of core contraction while the extended halo remains roughly static .",
    "they also show that during the evolution the density and temperature of the core both increase ( see , e.g. in fig .  1 of burkert 2000 , figs .  1 and 2 in kochanek & white 2000 and fig .  3 in yoshida et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "our study is compared most naturally to the simulations of @xcite and @xcite , who also investigated an isolated halo . @xcite",
    "surveyed different values for the sidm cross section , and discovered that a larger cross section induces a greater effect on the evolution - see their fig .",
    "2b , which resembles our figure  [ fig : rhos_ts ] .",
    "however , both works assumed as initial conditions a virialized @xcite profile with a cuspy core , so that initially , part of the halo resided in the smfp regime : the initial conditions of @xcite correspond to a ratio @xmath193 _ at the outer edge of the core _ and those of @xcite correspond to the range of 0.1 - 3.0 .",
    "such a system has a lifetime of only a few relaxation times @xcite , which is the trend found by @xcite , who claimed that such a short lifetime is an argument against the validity of sidm .",
    "however , such an initial configuration appears to be inconsistent with the sidm hypothesis , at least for large collision cross sections . in this case",
    ", a cluster will not virialize with a cuspy halo as in the case of cdm , since collisions would modify halo profiles .",
    "the formation of smooth cores following virialization is certainly indicated in the results of @xcite and @xcite , whose calculations include halo formation by violent relaxation . our results may offer a better description of the evolution of a sidm halo : the lifetime of a present day halo is significantly _ longer _ than a hubble time .",
    "limited spatial resolution did not allow @xcite and @xcite to follow the evolution of the core to large densities .",
    "in particular , the simulations they reported were terminated when the central density increased by less than a factor of 10 with respect to its value when the flat core formed .",
    "thus , they could not observe the late - time evolutionary effects which appear at much larger densities , including the formation of the smfp inner core or its reduced rate of mass loss as the core continues to contract .",
    "we hope that n - body simulations or other boltzmann - solvers with improved spatial resolution in the core and extended integration timescales might be able to confirm our findings on these issues in the future .",
    "we can not easily compare out results with those of @xcite and @xcite , who examined the significance of a sidm model on structure formation by including a monte - carlo module in a cosmological tree code .",
    "their calculations are three dimensional and include the effects of accretion and mergers , which are not accounted for in our spherical study .",
    "@xcite claim that no halo ever develops an isothermal core since hot material is continuously accreted onto the halo , therefore preventing efficient heat transfer from the core to the halo .",
    "although their results can not truly gauge the properties of the core due to insufficient resolution , it is clear that significant ongoing accretion will modify gravothermal evolution which we found above .",
    "however , the time - dependent results of @xcite seem to be consistent with gravothermal evolution , with the exception of the destabilizing effect of major mergers .",
    "we plan to extend our method to incorporate an effective accretion and merger algorithm in the future .",
    "the purpose of this work was to construct a simple the gravothermal fluid model to study the evolution of an isolated , spherical , halo of self - interacting dark matter ( sidm ) .",
    "for sidm every close collision can produce a large - angle scattering , a process which can drive thermal relaxation and gravothermal core collapse .",
    "by contrast , cdm halos are collisionless and frozen in time following their initial virialization . for a typical range of sidm cross sections and central densities of dark matter cores at the present epoch ,",
    "the relaxation time is of order @xmath194 years .",
    "accordingly , a typical halo has had sufficient time to thermalize and acquire a gravothermal profile consisting of a flat core surrounded by an extended halo . in this sense sidm",
    "is similar to globular star clusters , for which the gravothermal model was originally developed .",
    "however , in globular clusters , relaxation is driven by the cumulative effect of many distant , small - angle coulomb encounters .    in the gravothermal evolution of a sidm halo",
    ", we can distinguish between a lmfp limit , where the gravitational scale height is much smaller than the collision mean free path , and the smfp limit , where the situation is reversed .",
    "heat conduction and mass transfer between the core and the extended halo differ in form and magnitude in the two limits .",
    "a semianalytic self - similar solution exists in the lmfp regime and can be determined following the approach of @xcite for globular star clusters .",
    "the general case requires numerical integration of the full set of quasistatic gravothermal equations .",
    "we showed that the core of a lmfp halo undergoes gravothermal collapse in a time @xmath195 , where @xmath0 is the instantaneous relaxation time .",
    "in newtonian theory the core collapses to infinite density and zero mass , but in reality it must collapse slightly earlier to a black hole with a finite mass due to the dynamical instability which sets in when particle velocities become relativistic . in any case , the collapse time of present day halos is significantly longer than the hubble time .",
    "accordingly , the existence of halos with flat cores at the current epoch is entirely consistent with the sidm hypothesis and gravothermal evolution .    in the standard scenario of the gravitational collapse of an",
    "initially dilute , overdense fluctuation of dark matter , a nascent sidm halo will virialize by violent relaxation on a dynamical ( collapse ) time scale",
    ". the system will subsequently thermalize by collisions on a relaxation time scale ( eq .  ( [ eq : t_rsidm ] ) ) . for typical parameters , both",
    "the core and extended halo will be in the lmfp regime following the initial relaxation .",
    "the model then predicts that the extended halo , if isolated , will acquire a density profile with @xmath117 ; this power - law should remain constant while the core evolves .",
    "while a power - law of this magnitude is not easily distinguishable from the range considered plausible for cdm , @xmath196 , @xcite it is consistent with the results of n - body simulations of sidm .",
    "while the extended halo remains almost static the core contracts and eventually enters the smfp regime where it behaves as a fluid .",
    "subsequent evolution drives the core into two components , a dense , smfp inner core and a more dilute lmfp outer core .",
    "sharp temperature and density gradients develop at the interface between the two components where @xmath166 .",
    "gravothermal evolution of the inner core is slowed down ( i.e. , requires more relaxation times ) with respect to the evolution of the original lmfp core .    in the lmfp limit",
    "we find that @xmath197 : the core mass must decrease by more than four orders of magnitude for every order of magnitude the central temperature increases ( very much like the case for globular clusters ) . if at formation the core is initially nonrelativistic so that @xmath198 , the mass of the core at the onset of relativistic instability would clearly be negligible , were the evolution to persist in the lmfp regime .",
    "however , the transition into the smfp state drastically changes the evolution , so that @xmath199 .",
    "hence , _ a sidm halo retains an appreciable inner core mass as it evolves towards the relativistic instability_.    previous n - body simulations of a sidm halo show that the system develops a flat core plus extended halo structure .",
    "studies of an isolated halo @xcite also find that the core evolves by contracting in size while increasing its density and temperature , as we expect based on our gravothermal model .",
    "the gravothermal model allows us to follow the evolution of the core to much greater central densities than the n - body codes , and we have able to identify the appearance of a double core and reduced mass loss from the contracting inner core .",
    "we hope that future n - body simulations with improved resolution in the core region might be able to confirm this interesting behavior .",
    "the most significant cosmological implication of our results is that an isolated sidm halo at the present epoch with a central density and velocity dispersion similar to those inferred from observations ( @xmath125@xmath8  and @xmath200@xmath129  respectively ) should have a relaxed gravothermal profile , including a flat core and an extended halo at the current epoch .",
    "its relaxation time is less than one tenth of hubble time , so that it had sufficient time to thermalize , while the lifetime of its core should exceed ten hubble times , so the core should be far from collapse . hence , a gravothermal sidm halo is consistent with the observational inference of a flat core in dark matter halos .",
    "while our approach does not include accretion , mergers or angular momentum , these processes can be incorporated in more complicated gravothermal models .",
    "one natural question arises : did sidm halos formed at high or moderate redshift earlier in the universe have core lifetimes that were shorter than the hubble time ? at high red shift",
    "the mean density of the universe was higher , and so would be the typical densities of halos which form , implying shorter relaxation and gravothermal collapse times .",
    "a scenario whereby the gravothermal catastrophe in a sidm halo leads to the formation of a black hole at high red shift is intriguing as a general mechanism for producing supermassive black holes in galaxies and quasars .",
