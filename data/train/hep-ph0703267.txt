    "the measurement of the angle @xmath0 ( @xmath3 ) of the unitarity triangle using dalitz plot analysis of the @xmath4 decay from @xmath2 process , introduced by giri _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite and belle collaboration  @xcite and successfully implemented by babar  @xcite and belle  @xcite , presently offers the best constraints on this quantity .",
    "however , this technique is sensitive to the choice of the model used to describe the three - body @xmath1 decay .",
    "currently , this uncertainty is estimated to be @xmath5 and due to large statistical error does not affect the precision of @xmath0 measurement .",
    "as the amount of @xmath6 factory data increases , though , this uncertainty will become a major limitation .",
    "fortunately , a model - independent approach exists ( see  @xcite ) , which uses the data of the @xmath7-charm factory to obtain the missing information about the @xmath1 decay amplitude .    in our previous study of the model - independent dalitz analysis technique  @xcite we have implemented a procedure proposed by giri _",
    "_ involving the division of the dalitz plots into bins , and shown that this procedure allows to measure the phase @xmath0 with the statistical precision only 3040% worse than in the unbinned model - dependent case .",
    "we did not attempt to optimize the binning and mainly considered a high - statistics limit with an aim to estimate the sensitivity of the future super - b factory .",
    "the data useful for model - independent measurement are presently available from the cleo - c experiment  @xcite .",
    "cleo - c collected an integrated luminosity of 280 pb@xmath8 at the @xmath9 resonance decaying to @xmath10 . by the end of cleo - c operation",
    "this statistics will grow up to 750  fb@xmath8  @xcite .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath11 events where @xmath12 meson in a @xmath13 eigenstate decays to @xmath14 , and twice as much events of @xmath15 with both @xmath12 mesons decaying to @xmath16 .",
    "both of these processes include the information useful for a model - independent @xmath0 measurement . in this paper , we report on studies of the model - independent approach with a limited statistics of both @xmath9 and @xmath6 data , using both @xmath17 and @xmath18 final states .",
    "the density of @xmath19  dalitz plot is given by the absolute value of the amplitude @xmath20 squared : @xmath21 in the case of no @xmath13-violation in @xmath12 decay the density of the @xmath1   decay @xmath22 equals to @xmath23 then the density of the @xmath12 decay dalitz plot from @xmath2  process is expressed as @xmath24 where @xmath25 include the value of @xmath0 and other related quantities , the strong phase @xmath26 of the @xmath2  decay , and amplitude ratio @xmath27 : @xmath28 the functions @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the cosine and sine of the strong phase difference @xmath31 between the symmetric dalitz plot points : @xmath32 the phase difference @xmath31 can be obtained from the sample of @xmath12 mesons in a @xmath13-eigenstate , decaying to @xmath14 .",
    "the dalitz plot density of such decay is @xmath33 ( the normalization is arbitrary ) .",
    "decays of @xmath12 mesons in @xmath13 eigenstate to @xmath14 can be obtained in the process , _ e.g. _",
    "@xmath34 , where the other ( tag - side ) @xmath12 meson is reconstructed in the @xmath13 eigenstate , such as @xmath35 or @xmath36 .",
    "another possibility is to use a sample , where both @xmath12 mesons ( we denote them as @xmath12 and @xmath37 ) from the @xmath9 meson decay into the @xmath16 state  @xcite . since @xmath9 is a vector , two @xmath12 mesons are produced in a @xmath38-wave , and the wave function of the two mesons is antisymmetric .",
    "then the four - dimensional density of two correlated dalitz plots is @xmath39 this decay is sensitive to both @xmath29 and @xmath30 for the price of having to deal with the four - dimensional phase space .    in a real experiment , one measures scattered data rather than a probability density .",
    "two options of dealing with real data are possible : a binned approach , or a scatter plot smoothing using nonparametric density estimation .",
    "the latter could be useful to reach the statistical sensitivity equivalent to the model - dependent case .",
    "however , in this paper we show that using the appropriate binning this is also possible .",
    "the binned approach was proposed by giri _",
    "et al . _ @xcite .",
    "assume that the dalitz plot is divided into @xmath41 bins symmetrically to the exchange @xmath42 .",
    "the bins are denoted by the index @xmath43 ranging from @xmath44 to @xmath45 ( excluding 0 ) ; the exchange @xmath46 corresponds to the exchange @xmath47 .",
    "then the expected number of events in the bins of the dalitz plot of @xmath12 decay from @xmath2  is @xmath48 ,     \\label{n_b}\\ ] ] where @xmath49 is the number of events in the bins in the dalitz plot of the @xmath1 in a flavor eigenstate , @xmath50 is the normalization constant .",
    "coefficients @xmath51 and @xmath52 , which include the information about the cosine and sine of the phase difference , are given by @xmath53 @xmath52 is defined similarly with cosine substituted by sine . here @xmath54 is the bin region , over which the integration is performed .",
    "note that @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 ( the equality @xmath58 being satisfied if the amplitude is constant across the bin ) .    the coefficients @xmath49 are obtained precisely from a very large sample of @xmath1 decays in the flavor eigenstate , which is accessible at @xmath6-factories .",
    "the expected number of events in the dalitz plot of @xmath40 decay equals to @xmath59,\\ ] ] and thus can be used to obtain the coefficient @xmath51 .",
    "as soon as the @xmath51 and @xmath52 coefficients are known , one can obtain @xmath60 and @xmath61 values ( hence , @xmath0 and other related quantities ) by a maximum likelihood fit using equation ( [ n_b ] ) .",
    "note that now the quantities of interest @xmath60 and @xmath61 ( and consequently @xmath0 ) have two statistical errors : one due to a finite sample of @xmath2  data , and due to @xmath17 statistics",
    ". we will refer to these errors as @xmath6-statistical and @xmath40-statistical , respectively .",
    "obtaining @xmath52 is a major problem in this analysis . if the binning is fine enough , so that both the phase difference and the amplitude remain constant across the area of each bin , expressions ( [ cs ] ) reduce to @xmath62 and @xmath63 , so @xmath52 can be obtained as @xmath64 . using this equality",
    "if the amplitude varies will lead to the bias in the @xmath65 fit result .",
    "since @xmath51 is obtained directly , and @xmath52 is overestimated by the absolute value , the bias will mainly affect @xmath61 determination , resulting in lower absolute values of @xmath61 .",
    "our studies @xcite show that the use of equality @xmath58 is satisfactory for the number of bins around 200 or more , which can not be used with presently available @xmath40 data .",
    "it is therefore essential to find a relatively coarse binning ( the number of bins being 1020 ) which a ) allows to extract @xmath52 from @xmath51 with low bias , and b ) has the sensitivity to the @xmath0 phase comparable to the unbinned model - dependent case .    fortunately , both the a ) and b ) requirements appear to be equivalent . to determine the @xmath6-statistical sensitivity of a certain binning , let s define a quantity @xmath66",
    " a ratio of a statistical sensitivity to that in the unbinned case . specifically , @xmath66 relates the number of standard deviations by which the number of events in bins is changed by varying parameters @xmath60 and @xmath61 , to the number of standard deviations if the dalitz plot is divided into infinitely small regions ( the unbinned case ) : @xmath67\\,d\\mathcal{d }    } , \\ ] ] where @xmath68 , @xmath69 .",
    "since the precision of @xmath60 and @xmath61 weakly depends on the values of @xmath60 and @xmath61 @xcite , we can take for simplicity @xmath70 . in this case",
    "one can show that @xmath71 therefore , the binning which satisfies @xmath72 ( _ i.e. _ the absence of bias if @xmath52 is calculated as @xmath73 ) also has the same sensitivity as the unbinned approach .",
    "the factor @xmath66 defined this way is not necessarily the best measure of the binning quality ( the binning with higher @xmath66 can be insensitive to either @xmath60 or @xmath61 , which is impractical from the point of measuring @xmath0 ) , but it allows an easy calculation and correctly reproduces the relative quality for a number of binnings we tried in our simulation .",
    "the choice of the optimal binning naturally depends on the @xmath1 model . in our studies",
    "we use the two - body amplitude obtained in the latest belle @xmath0 dalitz analysis @xcite .    from the consideration above",
    "it is clear that a good approximation to the optimal binning is the one obtained from the uniform division of the strong phase difference @xmath31 . in the half of the dalitz plot @xmath74 ( _ i.e. _ the bin index @xmath75 ) the bin @xmath54 is defined by condition @xmath76 in the remaining part ( @xmath77 ) the bins are defined symmetrically .",
    "we will refer to this binning as @xmath31-binning . as an example , such a binning with @xmath78 is shown in fig .",
    "[ binning ]  ( a ) .",
    "although the phase difference variation across the bin is small by definition , the absolute value of the amplitude can vary significantly , so the condition @xmath79 is not satisfied exactly .",
    "the values of @xmath51 and @xmath52 in this binning are shown in fig .",
    "[ cspic ] with crosses .",
    "figure  [ binning ]  ( b ) shows the division with @xmath78 obtained by continuous variation of the @xmath31-binning to maximize the factor @xmath66 .",
    "the sensitivity factor @xmath66 increases to 0.89 compared to 0.79 for @xmath31-binning .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     we perform a toy mc simulation to study the statistical sensitivity of the different binning options .",
    "we use the amplitude from the belle analysis  @xcite to generate decays of flavor @xmath1 , @xmath40 , and @xmath12 from @xmath2  decay to the @xmath14 final state according to the probability density given by ( [ p_d ] ) , ( [ p_cp ] ) and ( [ p_b ] ) , respectively . to obtain the @xmath6-statistical error we use a large number of @xmath1 and @xmath40 decays , while the generated number of @xmath12 decays from the @xmath2  process ranges from 100 to 100000 . for each number of @xmath6 decay events ,",
    "100 samples are generated , and the statistical errors of @xmath60 and @xmath61 are obtained from the spread of the fitted values .",
    "a study of the error due to @xmath40 statistics is performed similarly , with a large number of @xmath6 decays , and the statistics of @xmath40 decays varied .",
    "both errors are checked to satisfy the square root scaling .",
    "the binning options used are @xmath31-binning with @xmath78 and @xmath80 , as well as ",
    "optimal \" binnings with maximized @xmath66 obtained from these two with a smooth variation of the bin shape . note that the  optimal \" binning with @xmath80 offers the @xmath6-statistical sensitivity only 4% worse than an unbinned technique .",
    "for comparison , we use the binnings with the uniform division into rectangular bins ( with @xmath78 and @xmath81 in the allowed phase space , the ones which are denoted as 3x3 and 5x5 in  @xcite ) .",
    "the @xmath6- and @xmath40-statistical precision of different binning options , recalculated to 1000 events of both @xmath6 and @xmath40 samples , as well as their calculated values of the factor @xmath66 , are shown in table  [ stat ] . in the present study we use the errors of parameters @xmath60 and @xmath61 rather than @xmath0 as a measure of the statistical power since they are nearly independent of the actual values of @xmath0 , strong phase @xmath82 and amplitude ratio @xmath27 .",
    "the error of @xmath0 can be obtained from these numbers given the value of @xmath27 . the factor",
    "@xmath66 reproduces the ratio of the values @xmath83 for the binned and unbinned approaches with the precision of 12% .",
    "while the binning with maximized @xmath66 offers better @xmath6-statistical sensitivity , the best @xmath40-statistical precision of the options we have studied is reached for the @xmath31-binning . however , for the expected amount of experimental data of @xmath6 and @xmath40 decays the @xmath6-statistical error dominates , therefore , slightly worse precision due to @xmath40 statistics does not affect significantly the total precision .    using @xmath31-binning",
    ", the following combination of the binned and unbinned approaches is possible , which allows to reach @xmath6-statistical precision equivalent to the unbinned case .",
    "assume the number of @xmath31-bins is large enough , so @xmath84 and @xmath85 remain almost constant across the bin area .",
    "at the level of current precision this is reached already for a number of bins as small as 1020 .",
    "then @xmath86 where the integrals can be calculated from the flavor @xmath12 data sample .",
    "therefore , it is possible to obtain @xmath84 from @xmath51 ( and consequently @xmath85 ) , and use them in the expression for the probability density ( [ p_b ] ) to perform the unbinned @xmath6-data fit thus obtaining the best possible @xmath6-statistical precision .",
    "we have considered the choice of the optimal binning only from the point of statistical power . however , the conditions to satisfy low model dependence are quite different .",
    "since the bins in the binning options we have considered are sufficiently large , the requirement that the phase does not change over the bin area is a strong model assumption .",
    "we have performed toy mc simulation to study the model dependence .",
    "while the binning was kept the same as in the statistical power study ( based on the phase difference from the default @xmath1 amplitude ) , the amplitude used to generate @xmath1 , @xmath40 and @xmath2  decays was altered in the same way as in the belle study of the model - dependence in the unbinned analysis  @xcite . as a result ,",
    "the same bias of @xmath87 is observed as in unbinned analysis .",
    "we remind that the cause of this bias is a fixed relation between the @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "therefore , proposed binning options , although providing good statistical precision , are not flexible enough to provide also a low model dependence . to minimizie the model dependence ,",
    "the bin size should be kept as small as possible , therefore , uniform binning is more preferred .    in a real analysis , one can control the model error by testing if the amplitude used to define binning is compatible with the observed @xmath40 data .",
    "this can be done , _ e.g. , _ by dividing each bin and comparing calculated values of @xmath51 in its parts , or by comparing the expected and observed numbers of events in each bin .",
    "we conclude that the method of @xmath0 determination using only @xmath40 data is only asymptotically model - independent , since for any finite bin size the calculation of @xmath52 is done using model assumptions of the @xmath31 variations across the bin . increasing the @xmath40 data",
    "set , however , allows to apply a finer binning and therefore reduce the model error due to the variation of the phase difference .",
    "the use of the @xmath9 decays where both neutral @xmath12 mesons decay to the @xmath14 state allows to significantly increase the amount of data useful to extract phase information in @xmath1 decay .",
    "it is also possible to detect events of @xmath89 , where @xmath90 is not reconstructed , and its momentum is obtained from kinematic constraints . the number of these events is approximately twice that of @xmath91 due to combinatorics .",
    "we will refer to both of these processes as @xmath92 .",
    "in the case of a binned analysis , the number of events in the region of the @xmath91 phase space is @xmath93 .",
    "\\end{split}\\ ] ] in the case of the @xmath94 final state , the interference term changes its sign . here",
    "two indices correspond to two @xmath12 mesons from @xmath9 decay .",
    "it is logical to use the same binning as in the case of @xmath40 statistics to improve the precision of the determination of @xmath51 coefficients , and to obtain @xmath52 from data without model assumptions , contrary to @xmath40 case .",
    "the obvious advantage of this approach is its being unbiased for any finite @xmath92 statistics ( not asymptotically as in the case of @xmath40 data ) .",
    "note that in contrast to @xmath40 analysis , where the sign of @xmath52 in each bin was undetermined and has to be fixed using model assumptions , @xmath95 analysis has only a four - fold ambiguity : change of the sign of all @xmath51 or all @xmath52 . in combination with @xmath40 analysis , where the sign of @xmath51 is fixed",
    ", this ambiguity reduces to only two - fold .",
    "one of the two solutions can be chosen based on a weak model assumption ( incorrect @xmath52 sign corresponds to complex - conjugated @xmath12 decay amplitude , which violates causality requirement when parameterized with the breit - wigner amplitudes ) .",
    "coefficients @xmath51 , @xmath52 can be obtained by minimizing the negative logarithmic likelihood function @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the poisson probability to get @xmath98 events with the expected number of @xmath99 events .",
    "the number of bins in the 4-dimensional phase space is @xmath100 rather than @xmath41 in the @xmath40 case .",
    "since the expected number of events in correlated @xmath101 data is of the same order as for @xmath40 , the bins will be much less populated .",
    "this , however , does not affect the precision of @xmath51 , @xmath52 determination since each of the free parameters is constrained by many bins .",
    "the toy mc simulation was performed to study the procedure described above . using the amplitude from the belle analysis , we generate a large number of @xmath4 decays and several sets of @xmath91 decays ( according to the probability density given by ( [ p_corr ] ) ) .",
    "we use the same binning options as in @xmath40 study with @xmath78 . the negative logarithmic likelihood ( [ corr_lh ] )",
    "is then minimized with @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath102 as free parameters .",
    "we constrain @xmath103 in the fit to improve the convergence .",
    "the coefficients @xmath51 , @xmath52 are then used in the fit to @xmath6 decay data to obtain the @xmath65 error due to @xmath92 decay statistics .",
    "the number of @xmath91 decays ranges from 1000 to 10000 .",
    "the obtained error shows a square root scaling .",
    "the best @xmath104-statistical error is obtained for @xmath31-binning and recalculated to 1000 events yields @xmath105 , @xmath106 , which is only slightly worse than the error obtained with the same amount of @xmath40 data ( see table  [ stat ] for comparison ) .",
    "we also check that changing the model used to define the binning does not lead to the systematic bias ( although it does decrease the statistical precision ) .",
    "figure  [ cspic ] demonstrates the precision of the determination of @xmath51 , @xmath52 coefficients in our toy mc study and the absence of the systematic bias for both @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "since the number of @xmath92 decays in @xmath9 data is approximately twice larger than the number of @xmath40 decays , the statistical errors due to @xmath9 data for the two approaches are nearly equal .",
    "the same binning can be used in both approaches , therefore improving the accuracy of @xmath51 determination .",
    "the approach based on @xmath92 data allows to extract both @xmath51 and @xmath52 without additional model uncertainties , so it can be used to check the validity of the constraint @xmath79 and therefore to test the sensitivity of the particular binning .",
    "we have studied the model - independent approach to @xmath0 measurement using @xmath2 decays with neutral @xmath12 decaying to @xmath14 .",
    "the analysis of @xmath107 data allows to extract the information about the strong phase in @xmath19  decay that is fixed by model assumptions in a model - dependent technique .",
    "we specially consider the case with a limited @xmath107 data sample which will be available from cleo - c in the nearest future .    in the binned analysis",
    ", we propose a way to obtain the binning that offers an optimal statistical precision ( close to the precision of an unbinned approach ) .",
    "two different strategies of the binned analysis are considered : using @xmath17 data sample , and using decays of @xmath9 to @xmath108 .",
    "the strategy using @xmath40 decays alone can not offer a completely model - independent measurement : it provides only the information about @xmath51 coefficients , while @xmath52 for low @xmath40 statistics has to be fixed using model assumptions .",
    "however , as the @xmath40 data sample increases , model - independence can be reached by reducing the bin size .",
    "the strategy using the @xmath109 sample , in contrast , allows to obtain both @xmath51 and @xmath52 with an accuracy comparable to @xmath40 approach .",
    "both strategies can use the same binning of the @xmath19   dalitz plot and therefore can be used in combination to improve the accuracy due to @xmath9 statistics .",
    "the expected sensitivity is obtained based on the @xmath1 decay model from belle analysis . for the cleo - c statistics of 750 pb@xmath8 ( 1000 @xmath40 events and 2000 @xmath92 events ) the expected errors of parameters @xmath60 and @xmath61 due to @xmath9 statistics are @xmath110 and @xmath111 . for @xmath112",
    "it gives the @xmath0 precision @xmath113 , which is far below the expected error due to present - day @xmath6 data sample .    in our study",
    ", we did not consider the experimental systematic uncertainties _",
    "e.g. _ due to imperfect knowledge of the detection efficiency or background composition .",
    "we believe these issues can be addressed in a similar manner as in already completed model - dependent analyses .",
