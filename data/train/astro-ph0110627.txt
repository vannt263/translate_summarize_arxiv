    "luminous infrared galaxies ( lirgs ) are galaxies with @xmath3 and in which most of the bolometric luminosity is emitted in the infrared ( see @xcite for a review ) . in addition , they are often found in interacting or merging systems  with a frequency ranging from @xmath4 at @xmath5 to @xmath6 at @xmath7  and are rich in molecular gas @xcite . a majority of interacting systems , however , are not lirgs , so interactions are unlikely to be the sole sufficient condition for explaining lirgs @xcite .    numerical simulations of interacting systems suggest that lirgs might be powered by nuclear starbursts .",
    "starbursts are triggered as tidal interaction strips angular momentum from molecular gas in the galaxies and gas clouds are drawn into the circumnuclear region during the late stages of interaction @xcite .",
    "this scenario does not explain off - nuclear starbursts and gas concentrations observed in some systems @xcite , although some simulations do show enhanced extra - nuclear star formation ( e.g. , fig .",
    "13 , @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , numerical simulations do not necessarily reflect real star formation processes , since star formation is modeled , by the schmidt law , as a function of gas density only .",
    "previous observational work on lirgs have found nuclear starbursts and gas concentrations consistent with the numerical results , but these studies generally focused on late - stage mergers and ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) , which lack the initial condition information that would be useful in comparisons to simulations @xcite .",
    "few studies have explored mergers of gas - rich galaxies over the entire merger sequence .",
    "@xcite studied a range of phases in the merger sequence in the , , and @xmath8-bands for a small sample of galaxies .",
    "they suggest that disks should become more disrupted as the merger progresses , from @xmath9 of the @xmath10 being found in the main disks and bulges of each system at an early stage to near 0% , late in the merger sequence .",
    "in addition , @xcite have shown that star formation efficiency ( sfe = @xmath11 ) increases as separation between interacting galaxy pairs decreases .",
    "in general , these results , as well as other observational results and numerical simulations suggest that the starburst phase of interacting galaxies occurs at a late stage in the interaction and is confined to the central kpc .",
    "arp 256 is composed of two galaxies separated by @xmath12 .",
    "arp 256 n ( north ) is a sb(s)c galaxy , while arp 256 s ( south ) is a sb(s)b galaxy . at a redshift of @xmath13 km @xmath14 ,",
    "their distance has been calculated at 98.1 mpc ( @xmath15=75 km @xmath14 @xmath16 ) with a projected nuclear separation of 29 kpc @xcite .",
    "the ir luminosity based on iras observations is @xmath17 , but neither galaxy is known to have agn activity and both show region - like spectra @xcite .",
    "the relatively large separation between the galaxies in arp 256 suggests that the system is in an early phase of merging and , thus , is of interest as an observational example of a lirg in the early stages of the formation process .",
    "table [ ta1 ] summarizes the details of all the observations .",
    "21 cm observations of arp 256 were conducted with the very large array ( vla ) in the c configuration on 1998 december 14 .",
    "the time on source was nearly 7 hours , and the half - power beamwidth of @xmath18 was centered between the two galaxies and fully covered all the emission with a velocity bandwidth of 63 channels of 21.75 km @xmath14 each . the observing frequency was 1.3826 ghz , corresponding to 8159 km @xmath14 in the optical definition of velocity with respect to the local standard of rest .",
    "the aips software package was used for the calibration and data reduction .",
    "the data was carefully flagged and two calibration sources , quasars 3c48 ( iau name : 0137 + 331 ) and 0022 + 002 , were used to derive the antenna - based gain and the bandpass solutions .",
    "the continuum was estimated from the line - free channels ( channels 1 - 24 and 45 - 63 , velocity ranges 8833 - 8333 and 7876 - 7485 km @xmath14 ) and subtracted in the @xmath19 plane with uvlin to result in a data cube with only emission .",
    "emission is clearly detected in the velocity range 8290 - 7963 km @xmath14 ( channels 26 - 41 ) , a velocity linewidth of 370 km @xmath14 .",
    "two image maps were made from this data cube .",
    "one resultant map uses a synthesized beam of @xmath20 and a robust = 0 weight function to achieve 0.38 mjy @xmath21 rms noise level .",
    "an additional , `` naturally '' weighted map , with synthesized beam of @xmath22 , was made and used to construct a velocity contour map ( see figure [ mom1 ] ) .",
    "a radio continuum image was extracted from the the emission - free channels ( channels 3 - 22 , 43 - 61 , velocity ranges 8790 - 8377 and 7920 - 7528 km @xmath14 ) of the dataset .",
    "a robust=-5 , `` uniform '' weight function was used in order to maximize the resolution of the image , resulting in a @xmath23 synthesized beam and 0.61 mjy @xmath21 rms noise level .",
    "co @xmath24 in arp 256 was observed in 1998 may and november at the berkeley - illinois - maryland association ( bima ) 10-element millimeter wave array in the c configuration .",
    "arp 256 was observed for 28 minutes , alternated with 6.5 minute observations of the phase and amplitude gain calibrator 0006 - 063 for a total time on source of 9 hours .",
    "mars and uranus were observed as flux calibrators .",
    "the pointing was centered between the galaxies and the half - power beamwidth of @xmath25 covered the central 64 kpc .",
    "the observing frequency was 112.2204 ghz , corresponding to 8149 km @xmath14 in the optical convention .",
    "in addition , 78 channels of 19.9 km @xmath14 velocity width provided full frequency coverage .",
    "line emission was found in channels 27 - 48  velocity range 7890 - 8308 km @xmath14  for a velocity linewidth of 440 km @xmath26 .",
    "calibration and data reduction were done with the miriad software package .",
    "the resultant map uses a synthesized beam of @xmath27 and natural weighting to achieve a 0.038 jy @xmath21 rms noise level .",
    "in figure  [ over1 ] , the column density map is overlaid on a @xmath28-band image of arp 256 from a mosaic of 52 exposures of 60 seconds each from observations made with the nirim camera @xcite on the mount laguna observatory 1-m telescope .",
    "the distribution shows a spiral pattern , but , when compared to the near - infrared image , the emission peaks do not correspond to the optical emission peaks of the galaxies .",
    "this suggests that the original disks associated with the two galaxies have been severely disrupted despite the large separation between the two galaxies .",
    "the strong disruption of the disks may indicate that the galaxies have passed the period of first closest approach .",
    "the integrated flux measured in the vla map is 6.6 jy km @xmath14 , which is essentially the same as the single - dish flux of 6.01 jy km @xmath14 , measured by @xcite . from the integrated flux",
    ", the total mass can be estimated by @xmath29 where @xmath30 is distance in mpc , and @xmath31 is integrated flux in jy km @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath31 is obtained by summing the flux in the channel maps .",
    "the resultant total mass is @xmath32 .    the channel maps and the position - velocity map show at least four distinct gas components ( see figures  [ hichan],[sv1 ] ) : the tail of emission extending from the northern arm of arp 256 n ; the central peak of emission between the two galaxies ; a small amount of gas that overlaps the optical emission of arp 256 s on the sky ; and the emission peak to the south - west of arp 256 s. these components have @xmath3320 , 30 , 5 , and 15% of the integrated flux , and therefore of the total mass , respectively .",
    "figure  [ over1 ] also shows the integrated co intensity map overlaid on the optical image .",
    "in contrast to the distribution , the co emission associated with arp 256 s appears unresolved , as well as undisturbed , and well - confined within the circumnuclear regions of the galaxy . no co emission is detected in the nuclear regions of arp 256 n , although there is a marginal , @xmath34 detection in the vicinity of the southern major spiral arm .",
    "the absence of detected emission in arp 256 n is unexpected for a late - type spiral ( sc ) galaxy . in general ,",
    "early - type spirals  sab and sb  have a @xmath35 ratio around 2 and spiral galaxies later than sc have a ratio smaller than 1 @xcite , but the original disks of arp 256 have been disrupted , so this comparison is no longer possible .",
    "we estimate the molecular gas mass from the integrated co(1 - 0 ) flux using the empirical relation @xcite : @xmath36 where @xmath30 is distance in mpc and @xmath31 is co integrated flux in jy km @xmath37 . here",
    "the galactic conversion factor @xmath38/@xmath39 @xmath40 ( k km @xmath41 ( see @xcite for a review ) is assumed for convenient comparison with previous results .",
    "we note that this conversion factor may cause an overestimation of the molecular gas mass if the galaxy is undergoing starbursts ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the integrated flux of the co emission associated with the southern nucleus is 42 jy km @xmath14 , resulting in an estimated @xmath42 mass for the southern nucleus of @xmath43 .",
    "the @xmath44 upper limits to the integrated flux and the @xmath45 for the northern source are 29 jy km @xmath14 and 3.3 @xmath46 , respectively , employing the same linewidth as arp256 s.      a 21 cm radio continuum map was extracted from line - free channels of the vla observations and displayed in figure  [ over1 ] . a strong",
    ", unresolved radio source overlaps the bulge of arp 256 s. weaker continuum emission is detected in the direction of arp 256 n , with a peak over the northern major spiral arm and a weaker peak over the southern major spiral arm ( see figure  [ radioclose ] ) , with the possibility that the radio emission forms a spiral to match the spiral arms of the galaxy .",
    "future observations should include a higher resolution radio map in order to follow up on this unusual structure .",
    "measurements of the 20 cm radio continuum flux imply that the radio continuum is emitted almost entirely from the circumnuclear region of arp 256 s  inside a radius of 2 kpc .",
    "@xcite find an integrated flux density of 43.2 mjy at a resolution of @xmath47 , while the vla faint images of the radio sky at twenty - centimeters ( first ) survey finds 34.82 mjy within a @xmath48 beam @xcite .",
    "this corroborates the high level of activity in the southern source as seen in our map and implies the presence of a star forming region or an agn in arp 256 s. a closer inspection of the southern galaxy may detect a slight offset between the peak in emission of the radio continuum and the peak in emission of the co disk . while the radio continuum emission appears to be centered directly on the @xmath28-band image peak , the co emission appears slightly to the north - east .",
    "this offset , while intriguing , is similar to the pixel size for both the co map and the @xmath28-band map and has to be verified by further observations .",
    "figure  [ mom1 ] shows isovelocity contours from the first moment of the data cube .",
    "the velocity field appears to have the characteristics of two `` spider diagrams '' centered at the nuclei of the two galaxies .",
    "however , as the spectral lines are not single peaked and the velocity gradients do not follow the major axes of the optical galaxies  as would have been expected for an isolated , rotating , inclined disk  the `` spider diagram '' features are likely incidental",
    ". the systemic velocities of the two galaxies appear very similar , @xmath338150 km @xmath14 , measured via the optical definition with respect to the local standard of rest .",
    "it is possible that arp 256 n has a slightly greater recessional velocity , 8175 compared to 8125 km @xmath14 for arp 256 s. in comparison , heliocentric optical redshifts for the two galaxies show the northern nucleus at 8193 km @xmath14 and the southern nucleus at 8112 km @xmath14 .",
    "in addition , the co map for arp 256 s shows a velocity width of 300 km @xmath14 , centered around 8130 km @xmath14 , calculated via the optical definition .",
    "the gas appears to `` rotate '' about arp 256",
    "n , from south - south - west to north - east between 8246 and 8050 km @xmath14 , whereas the around arp 256 s `` rotates '' from near the galaxy to west - south - west between 8159 and 8007 km @xmath14 , asymmetric in distribution",
    ".    these rotational signatures may be misleading , since , in searching for signatures of rotational motion in smaller slices of the spatial - velocity diagram , it becomes apparent that very little gas can actually be attributed to any particular galaxy .",
    "for example , figures  [ nsv ] and [ ssv ] are spatial velocity diagrams for the two galaxies of arp 256 separately , summing emission perpendicular to the approximate east - west alignment of the major axes of both galaxies .",
    "they clearly show that despite the large amount of gas in the system , very little of the original disks around arp 256 n and s remain .",
    "the declinations which correspond to the optical bulges of the galaxies appear at approximately the same velocity , 8115 km @xmath14 .",
    "in addition , the major peaks of emission ( offset on the sky from the galaxies ) do not exhibit normal rotational motion and appear essentially at one velocity . at lower velocities ,",
    "the northernmost peak of emission appears at 8070 km @xmath14 , while the southernmost peak is at 8030 km @xmath14 . at higher velocities ,",
    "the strongest peak of emission , between the two galaxies , appears at two distinct velocities , 8160 and 8250 km @xmath14 .",
    "any attempt to synthesize the kinematic data into an orbital geometry for the system can be only partly successful , as we remain burdened with too many degrees of freedom . given the lack of strong tidal tails and the strong disruption of the disks , it is likely that at least one of the spin vectors of the galaxies is retrograde with respect to the orbital angular momentum vector and a prograde - prograde configuration is unlikely @xcite .",
    "the velocity contours show that the direction of the gradient in the two galaxies is in opposite directions along an east - west axis . however , as the galaxies appear to be at least somewhat face - on with respect to the plane of the sky ",
    "arp 256 s is measured at an inclination of @xmath49 @xcite  even this is inconclusive in determining whether the galaxies spin axes are aligned or in opposite directions .",
    "given the level of activity in the southern galaxy , it is appropriate to ask whether the source is a starburst or an agn .",
    "the answer , however , is difficult to determine definitely . a simple way to distinguish between a nuclear starburst and an agn would be to resolve the center of the galaxy ;",
    "a nuclear starburst would be confined to @xmath50 1 kpc of the center , while an agn would be confined to a much smaller radius . in addition , an offset of the radio continuum emission from the gas that might feed star formation or from starlight could distinguish a starburst from an agn .",
    "current radio continuum images of arp 256 s are unable to resolve the center of the galaxy and distinguish between a nuclear starburst or an agn .",
    "they resolve at best to only 1 - 2 kpc , and the previously noted offset of the co disk is inconclusive , given the resolution of our images .",
    "starbursts exhibit a strong far - infrared / radio continuum correlation ( see @xcite ) , which also proves inconclusive in the case of arp 256 , falling within an acceptable range for a starburst , but not ruling out an agn @xcite . however , previously published data of line ratios taken from optical spectra distinguish between a starburst and an agn .",
    "@xcite find , via optical spectra , that both of the galaxies in arp 256 are region - like ( not powered by an agn ) and neither liner nor seyfert - like .",
    "in addition , @xcite find significant h@xmath51 emission in the southern nucleus , supporting those results .",
    "the star formation efficiency ( sfe ) of the galaxies can be estimated by the ratio @xmath52 . given a @xmath53 from @xcite of @xmath54 for the northern source and of @xmath55 for the southern source , the sfe of arp 256  s is 24.4 @xmath56 , far higher than the typical sfe of giant molecular clouds in the milky way ( * ? ? ?",
    "* @xmath57 ) and within the 20 - 100 @xmath56 range for nuclear starburst galaxies @xcite .",
    "the @xmath53 given by @xcite , however , is likely to be an underestimate as it is based upon an extrapolation from near - ir measurements and assumptions about the far - infared ratios . on the other hand , from the radio continuum map",
    ", it is clear that @xmath3375% of the emission is from the southern source .",
    "the total ir luminosity detected by iras is @xmath17 .",
    "if we assume that arp 256 s emits @xmath3375% , then we estimate a similar sfe for arp 256 s of @xmath58 .",
    "it seems likely , then , that there is a starburst in the nuclear regions of arp 256 s. the infrared luminosity and the molecular gas mass give an estimate of how long it will take for the molecular gas to run out .",
    "if we assume the infrared luminosity is entirely due to dust heated by young stars in recent star formation , the star formation rate ( sfr ) is directly proportional to the infrared luminosity , with a relation of sfr ( @xmath59 @xmath60 ) @xmath61 ) for stars with masses greater than 2 @xmath59 @xcite . for arp 256",
    ", the estimated star formation rate would be 11.7 @xmath62 .",
    "this rate essentially measures gas depletion , so given the inferred molecular gas mass , the molecular gas will be exhausted in @xmath63 yr .",
    "this timescale is inconsistent with the expectation of a nuclear starburst at a late stage of merging for galaxies with central bulges .",
    "given that arp 256 is currently in an early - stage of merging associated with the period of first close approach @xcite , the starburst in arp 256 s will be exhausted before the late stages of merging .    in comparison to other studies ,",
    "other discrepancies also arise .",
    "@xcite , in a study of sfe in systems at various stages of interaction , note a correlation between sfe and interaction time ",
    "the longer the interaction time , the greater the sfe  which supports the standard model of starbursts at late stages of mergers . in comparison to that study , arp 256 has the highest sfe for its apparent separation ( the measure of interaction time used ) .",
    "the highly disrupted disk and the low percentages of flux associated with the optical disks of each galaxy also run contrary to the results of @xcite , who find an anti - correlation between the stage of merger and the central mass . other observations , however , find cases of early - stage mergers with possible starbursts ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the lack of detected co would imply that arp 256 n has little star formation activity .",
    "@xcite , however , identify the galaxy as region - like .",
    "in addition , the h@xmath51-band images of arp 256",
    "n of @xcite , clearly show a peak of emission in the northern arm but not in its nucleus , nor in the southern arm  where we had a marginal detection of co and an upper limit of @xmath64 .",
    "our radio continuum map peaks off - nucleus and may possibly overlap the h@xmath51 peak in the northern arm and is , therefore , consistent with the results of @xcite .",
    "from our new observations of and co in arp 256 we see evidence contradicting the standard model of lirgs . despite the large separation between the galaxies and no morphological evidence of interaction that would accompany an intermediate or late stage merger , arp 256 displays the highly disrupted disks and increased sfe commonly associated with a late stage of merging . the interaction history of arp 256 that has led it to its current set of characteristics , however , are unavailable with current evidence and models , and more study is required of this system and others like it .",
