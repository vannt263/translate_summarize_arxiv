    "measuring rheological properties of complex fluids is usually performed in oscillatory shear flow by recording the time - dependent shear stress response to an externally applied oscillatory shear strain @xcite .    for a small strain amplitude @xmath0 ,",
    "the measured shear stress is a simple harmonics with the same angular frequency @xmath1 and can be represented in the form @xmath2 provided that the shear strain changes according to a sine law , i.e. , @xmath3 .",
    "the quantities @xmath4 and @xmath5 are called the storage and loss moduli , respectively .    equation ( [ 1rh(0.1 ) ] ) can be also represented in the form @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the shear stress amplitude , @xmath8 is the dynamic modulus .    in many practical applications ,",
    "monitoring changes of @xmath9 and @xmath10 occurring in response to changes of environment variables is crucial for understanding the structure and dynamics of materials .",
    "for example , the ratio @xmath11 changes dramatically at the glass transition as a response to variation of relative humidity @xcite .",
    "since properties of the materials in the glassy and in the fluid state are totally different , they can not be described by one model , and hence a model - free approach should be used for description rheology of materials in a broad range of values of temperature and relative humidity .",
    "thus , calculation of @xmath9 and @xmath10 from both traditional rheometry data and from newer methods such as qcm - d @xcite finds many applications in pharmacy , biophysics , surface and colloid chemistry .    for small amplitude oscillatory shear ( saos ) flows ,",
    "the amplitude ratio , @xmath12 , and the loss angle , @xmath13 , are independent of @xmath0 , whereas the moduli @xmath4 and @xmath5 represent elastic and viscous material properties .",
    "the quantities @xmath4 and @xmath5 represent integral characteristics of the material functions ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , and in saos they bear complete information on viscoelastic properties .",
    "recently , the so - called incomplete storage and loss moduli were introduced in @xcite to describe sinusoidally driven testing on a finite interval of time .",
    "however , when the assumption of small strain amplitudes is not satisfied , the same sinusoidal excitation will elicit a non - sinusoidal shear stress response , which is called large amplitude oscillatory shear ( laos ) flow .",
    "while in saos , the storage and loss moduli possess clear physical meanings , these parameters lose their physical significance in the nonlinear regime @xcite .",
    "there is still an urgent need for finding measurable and physically meaningful material parameters that can conquer the status of nonlinear counterparts of @xmath4 and @xmath5 @xcite . in the present paper ,",
    "we consider the problem from two viewpoints : fourier transform ( ft ) and stress decomposition ( sd ) .",
    "correspondingly , the ft and sd coefficients are denoted by @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , while the generalized storage and loss moduli are indicated using letter subscripts .",
    "let us assume that the shear strain input is represented as a sine wave @xmath19 so that the strain rate is given by @xmath20    in the framework of the fourier - transform ( ft ) rheology , the nonlinear stress response is represented in the form of a fourier series @xmath21 where the fourier - coefficient moduli @xmath22 and @xmath23 are , in general , functions of angular frequency @xmath1 and strain amplitude @xmath0 , which are the two laostrain input parameters .    in the framework of the stress decomposition ( sd ) approach of @xcite",
    ", the stress response can be described as @xmath24 so that the stress response represents the sum @xmath25 of the elastic and viscous contributions @xmath26",
    "@xmath27    it is well known @xcite that the two forms ( [ 1rh(1.3 ) ] ) and ( [ 1rh(1.4 ) ] ) are equivalent , and the fourier - coefficient moduli @xmath14 and @xmath15 can be expressed in terms of the power - coefficient moduli @xmath28 and @xmath29 and vise versa .      first , making use of the trigonometric formulas @xmath30 @xmath31 ( see , e.g. , formulas ( 1.320.3 ) and ( 1.320.7 ) given by @xcite ) , we find @xmath32 @xmath33 where the coefficients @xmath34 are expressed in terms of a binomial coefficient @xmath35 with @xmath36 being the factorial of @xmath37 .",

    "similarly , @xcite introduced the minimum - rate dynamic viscosity , @xmath84 , and the large - rate dynamic viscosity , @xmath85 , defined as @xmath86 where @xmath87 .    in the framework of the ft rheology ,",
    "the following expansions take place @xcite : @xmath88 @xmath89    in the framework of the sd rheology , the substitution of ( [ 1rh(1.4 ) ] ) into the second formula ( [ 1rh(3.4 ) ] ) yields @xmath90    to evaluate the dynamic viscosity @xmath84 , we note that @xmath91 where , in light of ( [ 1rh(1.1 ) ] ) and ( [ 1rh(1.2 ) ] ) , @xmath92 , so that @xmath93 and , therefore , @xmath94    thus , the minimum - rate dynamic viscosity is given by @xmath95    observe that the large - strain modulus @xmath75 , as it is given by the power series expansion ( [ 1rh(3.6 ) ] ) , coincides with one of the generalized storage moduli introduced by @xcite ( see also @xcite ) as follows : @xmath96 here , @xmath97 and @xmath98 are the maxima of the elastic ( [ 1rh(1.6 ) ] ) and viscous ( [ 1rh(1.7 ) ] ) stresses , which are attained at @xmath99 and @xmath100 , respectively .",

    "note that the quantity @xmath110 was originally introduced by @xcite as the so - called apparent cage modulus .",

    "bowditch plots for a complete cycle with a sinusoidal strain input is represented together straight lines corresponding to the introduced above moduli and viscosities .    in the framework of saos ,",
    "it is easy to get interpretations for the moduli ( [ 1rh(5.1 ) ] ) and viscosities ( [ 1rh(5.2 ) ] ) . indeed ,",
    "if the applied oscillatory strain is given by @xmath3 , then the oscillatory stress response can be represented in the form @xmath118 .",
    "then , it can be shown that @xmath119    therefore , taking into account the saos relations @xmath120 @xmath121 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the storage and loss moduli , we readily get @xmath122 and @xmath123    note that the first formula ( [ 1rh(5.3 ) ] ) and ( [ 1rh(5.4 ) ] ) were obtained for the cage modulus @xmath110 by @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in the framework of saos , the following inverse relations take place : @xmath124 here , @xmath125 and @xmath126 are the storage and loss compliances , respectively .",
    "thus , from ( [ 1rh(5.4)])([1rh(5.6 ) ] ) , it follows that @xmath127    we emphasize that formulas ( [ 1rh(5.7 ) ] ) hold only in the saos regime . in the case of laos , by analogy with ( [ 1rh(5.7 ) ] ) , one can introduce the following quantities : @xmath128 @xmath129 @xmath130 @xmath131        the quantities ( [ 1rh(5.8a)])([1rh(5.9b ) ] ) can be called generalized storage and loss compliances defined in the strain - controlled test .    by analogy with eqs .",
    "( [ 1rh(5.7)])([1rh(5.8b ) ] ) , we can introduce the following quantities : @xmath132 @xmath133    note that , though the moduli @xmath134 and @xmath135 were introduced via the corresponding viscosities ( see formulas ( [ 1rh(5.9a)])([1rh(5.10b ) ] ) ) , they can be directly measured from the scaled lissajous ",
    "bowditch plot ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : fig6 ] ) .      in laos ,",
    "as it was observed by @xcite , it is still possible to define a value of the dynamic modulus @xmath136 where @xmath137 is the stress amplitude .",
    "the generalized loss angle can be introduced in a number of ways .",
    "first , based on the time delay , @xmath138 , between the amplitude values of the strain input and the stress output , i.e. , between the stress and strain maxima ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] ) , we can introduce the so - called amplitude based loss angle @xmath139    the corresponding storage and loss moduli can be formally introduced by the formulas @xmath140 where the dynamic modulus @xmath141 is given by ( [ 1rh(4.1 ) ] ) .",
    "further , as it was noted by @xcite , in the nonlinear regime , the concept of a single valued phase angle only makes sense when the periods of oscillation are identical ( equal to @xmath142 ) and when the phase difference is measured at zero stress . in this case",
    ", the so - called zero - stress based generalized loss angle , @xmath143 , can be introduced via the following formula @xcite : @xmath144 here , @xmath145 is the strain at which the stress is instantaneously zero .",
    "this quantity can be evaluated from the lissajous ",
    "bowditch curve .     and @xmath146 .",
    "]    finally , for the sake of completeness , let us introduce the zero - strain based generalized loss angle , @xmath147 , by the formula @xmath148 where @xmath146 is the stress at which the strain is instantaneously zero .",
    "again , this quantity can be calculated from the lissajous ",
    "bowditch curve ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5a ] ) .    for the sake of completeness ,",
    "in the case of laos measurements represented via the stress versus strain rate lissajous ",
    "bowditch plot , we can define the zero - stress based , @xmath149 , and the zero - strain - rate based , @xmath150 , generalized loss angles as follows : @xmath151 here , @xmath152 is the stress at which the strain rate is instantaneously zero , @xmath153 is the strain rate at which the stress is instantaneously zero .",
    "in this section , we briefly overview the defined generalized moduli on an illustrative example of laos and formulate some recommendations and conclusions .",
    "we consider a laos flow of a molten low - density polyethylene at @xmath154 with the test frequency @xmath155  hz ( so that @xmath156 rad / s ) and the strain amplitude @xmath157 , which was treated in the ft framework by @xcite using the discrete fourier transform to obtain the fourier series coefficients from the laos loop ( see table  [ tab : table1 ] ) .",
    "the coefficients @xmath16 and @xmath17 for the stress decomposition ( [ 1rh(1.4 ) ] ) ( see table  [ tab : table1 ] ) were evaluated using formulas ( [ 1rh(1.10 ) ] ) and ( [ 1rh(1.11 ) ] ) , which , in this case , are specified as follows : @xmath158 @xmath159 @xmath160 @xmath161 @xmath162 @xmath163 @xmath164 @xmath165 @xmath166          further , numerically evaluating the stress amplitude @xmath172 , by formula ( [ 1rh(4.1 ) ] ) we obtain the generalized dynamic modulus @xmath173 whereas formulas ( [ 1rh(4.2 ) ] ) , ( [ 1rh(4.4 ) ] ) , and ( [ 1rh(4.5 ) ] ) yield three different loss angles ( in radians ) @xmath174        as it is shown by the example of the previous section , the discrepancy between the moduli evaluated in laos according to different definitions can be very substantial .",
    "for example , @xmath55 and @xmath75 differ from @xmath74 by 40% and 80% , respectively , whereas the three storage moduli must coincide in saos .",
    "it is interesting to observe that the sd coefficients show tendency to decay faster than the ft coefficients ( see table  [ tab : table1 ] ) .",
    "therefore , the fit of the experimental laos loop @xcite will require a smaller number of sd coefficients .",
    "further , it is important to emphasize that though the quantities @xmath110 and @xmath111 were introduced in a similar way to @xmath74 and @xmath75 , they do not reduce to the storage modulus in saos .",
    "however , the corresponding reciprocal values , @xmath175 and @xmath176 ( see formulas ( [ 1rh(5.8a ) ] ) and ( [ 1rh(5.8b ) ] ) ) coincide with the storage compliance in the range of small strains .",
    "therefore , it is of practical interest to compare the values of @xmath175 and @xmath176 , which are determined under strain control , with the small - strain compliance , @xmath177 , and the large - strain compliance , @xmath178 , which are defined under stress control with the sinusoidal input as follows @xcite : @xmath179 note that comparison of strain - controlled and stress - controlled laos flows was performed in @xcite .",
    "let us underline again that though the right - hand sides of two formulas ( [ 1rh(6.1 ) ] ) coincide with the right - hand sides of ( [ 1rh(5.8a ) ] ) and ( [ 1rh(5.8b ) ] ) , respectively , in laos , the values of @xmath177 and @xmath178 can be different from @xmath175 and @xmath176 , even for the same level of the stress amplitude .",
    "a very important finding in our study is the exact coincidence of the minimum - strain storage modulus @xmath74 and the minimum - rate loss modulus @xmath107 with the first sd coefficients @xmath180 and @xmath181 , respectively . in the spirit of the decomposition method of @xcite ,",
    "the latter quantities , being coefficients of the leading terms in the sd expansions ( [ 1rh(1.6 ) ] ) and ( [ 1rh(1.7 ) ] ) , should not depend on the strain amplitude @xmath0 .",
    "this fact is of crucial relevance for laos , where other considered generalized moduli are strain amplitude dependent .",
    "thus , to conclude , a rheologicaly nonlinear material in laos is characterized by a set of storage and loss moduli , each of which has a more or less distinct physical meaning .",
    "while the different definitions result in the same values in saos , their predictions in laos can differ by tens of percents ( of course , depending on the level of the strain amplitude ) .",
    "therefore , when characterizing a laos flow in terms of the storage and loss moduli provided by commercially available rheometers , a special attention should be paid to specifying the method of moduli measurement . the strain - amplitude independent generalized storage and loss moduli @xmath74 and @xmath107",
    "are highlighted as being worthy of identifying the mechanical properties of a rheologically nonlinear material in laos .",
