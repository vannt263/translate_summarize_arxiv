    "the fermi space gamma - ray telescope ( fsgt ) was launched in 2008 @xcite . in the pre - fsgt era , the most - widely discussed mechanism of generating gev emission of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) is the inverse compton ( ic ) scattering ( e.g. , mszros & rees 1994 ; chiang & dermer 1999 ; dermer et al . 2000 ; fan & piran 2008 ; razzaque 2013 ) .",
    "the possibly dominant role of synchrotron radiation of the shock - accelerated electrons in producing gev emission has not been seriously - investigated / noticed until nov .",
    "2008 , two months before the official release of the first fermi - lat grb data ( the first report was on grb 080916c by abdo et al .",
    "2009a ) , by @xcite .",
    "the subsequent modeling of the fermi - lat grb gev emission data with the synchrotron radiation of the forward shock electrons can be found in a series of works ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and now the synchrotron radiation has been widely taken to be the leading mechanism to interpret the grb gev emission . nevertheless , the ic should play a non - ignorable role in producing @xmath6 gev afterglow emission @xcite .",
    "the physical reason is that due to the energy loss caused by the synchrotron radiation of the shock - accelerating electrons , these particles can not reach an energy higher than @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the so - called maximal lorentz factor of the electrons and @xmath9 is the strength of the magnetic field in the emitting region @xcite .",
    "correspondingly , the observed synchrotron radiation is not expected to exceed @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the bulk lorentz factor of the emitting region and @xmath12 is the redshift of the grb . in the early afterglow phase ,",
    "usually we have @xmath13 and hence @xmath14 .",
    "this is a quite general argument , which is valid as long as the emitting electrons are shock - accelerated @xcite .",
    "motivated by such a fact , @xcite suggested that the @xmath15rays more energetic than tens - gev , if detected in the afterglow of some relatively  nearby \" luminous grbs at a time @xmath16a few hundred seconds , would favor the ic scattering origin .    among grbs detected by fsgt ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a remarkable one is grb 130427a , the most powerful explosion of all grbs at redshift @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "its emission above 100 mev lasted about one day and four photons are at energies greater than 40 gev .",
    "regardless of the interpretation of the early multi - wavelength emission data , the simple but robust constraint by @xmath18 strongly disfavors the synchrotron radiation origin of the @xmath6 gev afterglow photons @xcite .",
    "the discovery of a hard spectral gev - tev radiation component in the afterglow phase is strongly in support of the ic radiation model ( tam et al .",
    "2013 ; c.f .",
    "kouveliotou et al .",
    "2013 ; perley et al .",
    "2014 ) .    in this work",
    "we analyze the fermi - lat public data of grb 131231a @xcite and report the discovery of a hard spectrum component in the first @xmath19s ( see section 3 ) and then we discuss its interpretation and implication , in particular the detection prospect by cherenkov telescope array ( cta ) in section 4 .",
    "the fermi gamma - ray burst monitor ( gbm ) triggered on grb  131231a  ( trigger 410157919 ) at 04:45:16.08 ut ( t@xmath20 ) on dec 31 2013 .",
    "the detection at high enough peak flux in the gbm detectors initiated an autonomous repoint request ( arr ) and fermi slewed to the grb location .",
    "the location of grb 131231a is at a distance of 40@xmath21 from the lat boresight at the time of the trigger and lat kept it in the field of view ( fov ) for 900s @xcite .",
    "it entered the lat fov again between 3200s and 7000s after the trigger .",
    "in addition to the fermi / gbm , konus - wind also triggered the burst . in the gbm data ,",
    "the light curve consists of a single large peak preceded by a smaller peak which resulted in the trigger .",
    "its duration ( @xmath22 ) is about 31s @xcite .",
    "the observation of konus - wind shows a broad multi - peaked pulse from 13s before and 35s after it was triggered .",
    "the fluence of this burst is @xmath23 erg/@xmath24 according to the observation of konus - wind from t0 to t0 + 7.488s in the 20kev-10mev energy range @xcite , while the gbm team reported that the fluence is @xmath25 erg/@xmath24 in the time interval t0 + 0.003s to t0 + 56s , in the 10kev-1000kev energy range @xcite .",
    "the time - averaged spectrum ( from trigger to 34.303s after ) is also well fitted by band function @xcite with @xmath26 kev , @xmath27 and @xmath28 @xcite .    in the x - ray band ,",
    "swift / xrt started to observe it at 52.1ks after the trigger .",
    "the location of the source observed by the swift / xrt is ra=10.5904 and dec=-1.6519 with an uncertainty of 3.5 arcsec(radius ) at 90@xmath29 confidence level and the position is consistently used in our subsequent analysis of lat data @xcite .",
    "the optical emission was firstly detected by the 1 m telescope located on mt .",
    "nanshan , xinjiang , china at t0 + 7.91 hr after the fermi trigger and then confirmed by some other telescopes @xcite .",
    "the redshift has been measured to be @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "the fermi / lat data of grb 131231a we utilized are available at the fermi science support center ( fssc ) , and we used the newest software , fermi science tools version v9r32p5 package in our analysis .",
    "we selected the events with `` evclass=2 '' ( source class ) from 100mev to 300gev within 15@xmath21 around the circle center ( @xmath31 , @xmath32 ) from fssc . to reduce the contamination of the gamma - ray photons from earth limb , we disregarded all the photons with the zenith angle greater than @xmath33 .",

    "the red squares represent those photons with @xmath36.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=50.0% ]      to construct the light curve of grb131231a , we performed unbinned maximum likelihood fits .",
    "the photons were divided into 8 time intervals to acquire sufficient statistics in each interval . since some photons come from the diffuse background or point sources and the time spans in each bin is short , we added the  galactic diffuse \" (  gll_iem_v05.fits \" ) ,  isotropic diffuse \" (  iso_source_v05.txt \" ) components and all the point sources within 20@xmath21 from the grb position into our background model , keeping the parameters of all the point sources fixed .",
    "we assumed a single power law spectrum for grb@xmath37131231a with its  normalization \" and  spectral index \" being allowed to vary .     to @xmath38s ( interval b , denoted by circles ) and @xmath38s to @xmath39s ( interval c , denoted by diamonds ) .",

    "the index of the best fitted line are 0.54@xmath400.15 , 0.51@xmath400.21 , 0.55@xmath400.28 for interval a , b and c respectively.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the results of our analysis are shown in fig.[fig : lt ] .",
    "we further fit the light curve with a single power law excluding the first time interval since it is before the peak flux time .",
    "the best fit temporal index is @xmath41 , which is similar to other fermi - lat grbs @xcite .",
    "as far as photon statistics allow , we attempt to build the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) from the prompt phase to the afterglow phase .",
    "the criteria we used to select the data are similar to those used to construct the light curve except that we split all data into two time intervals ( i.e. t@xmath20 to t@xmath20 + 120s and t@xmath20 + 120s to t@xmath20 + 1300s ) and five energy bins .",
    "attempts to use more time intervals may in principle give a more detailed time - evolution of the gamma - ray spectrum , as suggested by  @xcite for the case of grb  130427a .",
    "however , due to the limited photon statistics especially above a few gev , we only chose two time intervals with enough statistics to derive a general feature of the spectrum .",
    "the method and the models we used in this procedure are the same as the last section when constructing the light curve",
    ". we plot the resulting data in fig.[fig : sed ] .",
    "we then fit the five spectral points with a single power law and the index is @xmath42 for the first time interval and @xmath43 for the second time interval .",
    "the fit of all data in the first @xmath2 s gives a power - law index @xmath44 .",
    "these indices are consistent with those obtained by maximum likelihood analysis using all 100  mev to 100  gev photons .",
    "the energy spectrum from 100  mev to 100  gev is very hard , which is rare among fermi - lat grbs @xcite , except for grb 100728a , which has photon index , @xmath45 during an x - ray flare ( abdo et al . , 2011 , he et al . 2012 ) .",
    "although some bursts in the first fermi grb catalog may have spectrum almost as hard as that of grb 131231a , especially for grb 110120a and grb 110428a @xcite , these bursts have a lower detection significance as well as a smaller photon number associated with the respective grb .",
    "we present the probability of each photon in this data in the bottom panel of fig.[fig : lt ] , adopting the _ gtsrcprob _ tool . as shown in the fig.[fig : lt ] there are three photons with energy more than 10 gev : a 16 gev photon arrived at @xmath46s , a 51 gev photon at @xmath47s and a 62 gev photon at @xmath48s .",
    "the probability that each of these @xmath4910  gev photons is associated with the grb is @xmath4999.7% . with a redshift @xmath50",
    ", the highest gamma - ray has an energy @xmath51 gev in the burst s frame .",
    "the implication of such energetic photons will be discussed later",
    ".      it would be interesting to compare the high energy emission properties with those of grb 130427a . in grb 130427a ,",
    "four gamma - rays above 40 gev were collected @xcite while in grb 131231a just two gamma - rays are found to be so energetic .",
    "we note that : ( i ) the isotropic - equivalent kinetic energy of the outflow of grb 131231a is smaller than that of grb 130427a , as suggested by the less luminous prompt emission of grb 131231a ( whose isotropic 0.1 @xmath5 100 gev energy release is @xmath52 erg but @xmath53 erg for grb 130427a ) ; ( ii ) grb 131231a is at a redshift @xmath50 , which is a factor of two larger than grb 130427a ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "the extragalactic background light ( ebl ) , which reduces the chance of a @xmath55100  gev photon to arrive to the earth by photon - photon pair production , may play a moderate role here .",
    "taking these two factors into account , grb  131231a is actually comparable to grb  130427a in the number of very energetic photons that it emits .    in grb 130427a a hard spectral component ( @xmath45 ) above a few gev",
    "was found during the afterglow phase @xcite , while in grb 131231a the hard spectrum emerges at energy as low as @xmath56 mev .",
    "such a fact suggests that either the synchrotron radiation of grb 131231a is considerably less - efficient than that of grb 130427a or the ic radiation of grb 131231a is much more - efficient than that of grb 130427a .",
    "grb 131231a was detected by fsgt but not _ swift / bat _ , and the early x - ray and optical observations are not available .",
    "here we adopt the gev emission to constrain the afterglow model . in the electron synchrotron radiation model , a spectrum as hard as @xmath57 and",
    "the flux decline @xmath58 can be roughly accounted if ( i ) the energy distribution index of injected electrons is as hard as @xmath59 and the gev band is above both the typical synchrotron radiation frequency ( @xmath60 ) and the cooling frequency ( @xmath61 ) , a reliable calculation of the forward shock emission is still not available and two groups of primary approaches have been developed by bhattacharya ( 2001 ) and dai & cheng ( 2001 ) and by xue et al .",
    "( 2009b ) , respectively . ] , or alternatively ( ii ) the energy distribution index of injected electrons is normal with @xmath62 and the gev band is between @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "the synchrotron radiation spectrum of shock - accelerated electrons , however , is expected to have a cutoff at the energy ( i.e. , eq.(8 ) of fan et al .",
    "( 2013 ) ) @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the isotropic - equivalent kinetic energy of the outflow , @xmath65 is the number density of the medium , and @xmath66 is the wind parameter . the convenience @xmath67 has been adopted . for reasonable @xmath64 and @xmath65 ( or @xmath66 ) , the @xmath3",
    "gev @xmath15ray arriving at @xmath68 s ( see fig.[fig : lt ] ) can not be accounted for .",
    "we then conclude that the synchrotron radiation origin is disfavored unless the electrons are accelerated by mechanisms that operate on timescales faster than the larmor timescale .",
    "eq.([eq : syn_limit ] ) does not hold any longer if the high energy emission is from shock - accelerated protons rather than electrons @xcite .",
    "intriguingly , the synchrotron radiation of slowly - cooling protons has a spectrum @xmath69 , which is well consistent with the observation , where @xmath70 is the distribution index of shock - accelerated protons .",
    "the gev emission flux of the protons can be estimated as @xmath71 where @xmath72 ( @xmath73 ) is the fraction of shock energy given to the protons ( electrons ) and @xmath74 is the maximal specific fluxes of the forward shock electrons . with eqs.(2 - 3 ) of @xcite , it is straightforward to show that @xmath75 erg is needed to reproduce the observed gev flux @xmath76 at @xmath77 s. though such energies make possible the acceleration of ultra - high energy cosmic rays in the forward shock region , such a huge @xmath64 seems to be unrealistic .",
    "below we turn to the synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) radiation model ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . as summarized in eqs.(52 - 53 ) of @xcite , the characteristic frequencies governing the ssc spectrum are @xmath78 in the interstellar medium ( ism ) case and @xmath79 in the free wind medium , and @xmath80 in the ism case and @xmath81 in the free wind medium",
    "please note that @xmath82 and @xmath83 , where @xmath60 is the typical synchrotron radiation frequency of the forward shock electrons and @xmath84 is the minimum lorentz factor of the shock - accelerated electrons , and @xmath61 is the so - called cooling frequency of the forward shock electrons and @xmath85 is the cooling lorentz factor of the forward shock @xcite . on the other hand , the maximum ssc flux can be estimated as @xmath86 in the ism case and @xmath87 in the wind case ( see eq.(54 ) of fan & piran ( 2008 ) for a summary ) .    in order to account for the observed spectrum @xmath57 , the electrons are likely either in fast cooling phase ( i.e. , @xmath88 ) or in slow cooling phase ( i.e. , @xmath89 ) if @xmath90 is not sizeably larger than 2 . in the former we would expect a temporal behavior @xmath91 in the ism case and @xmath92 in the wind case ,",
    "both are inconsistent with the observed decline @xmath93 ( see the fig.[fig : lt ] ) . for the electrons in the slow cooling phase",
    ", we have @xmath94 in the ism case and @xmath95 in the wind case .",
    "clearly the ism model is in agreement with both the spectrum data and the temporal behavior for @xmath96 while the wind medium model is not .    due to the lack of simultaneous optical and x - ray afterglow emission at @xmath97 s , it is impossible to reliably infer the shock parameters .",
    "even so , a rough estimate on the importance of the ic radiation ( i.e. , the so - called compton parameter @xmath98 ) is achievable . in the ssc model @xmath99 mev at @xmath100",
    "s and @xmath101 gev at @xmath77 s are needed . as a conservative estimate of @xmath98 ,",
    "we assume that the synchrotron and ssc radiation components contribute equally at @xmath102 mev .",
    "note that both @xmath61 and @xmath60 are likely to be well below @xmath56 mev , and hence the synchrotron radiation flux at @xmath56 mev should drop with time as @xmath103 , very similar to that of the detected decline of high energy afterglow emission .",
    "therefore we have @xmath104 , implying that the forward shock electrons were likely mainly cooled by the synchrotron radiation photons rather than by the shock - generated magnetic field .",
    "cta is a project to build a new generation ground - based gamma - ray instrument in the energy range extending from tens - gev to above 100 tev .",
    "compared to current generation of imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescope arrays , cta has a factor of @xmath105 improvement in sensitivity in the energy range of @xmath106 and the extension to energies about 25 gev @xcite , cta will be very suitable to observe the high energy afterglow emission of grbs .",
    "that s why now we estimate the detection prospect of grb 131231a by cta - like detectors . for @xmath107s",
    ", we would expect @xmath108 .",
    "the ssc radiation spectrum is thus @xmath109 for @xmath89 and @xmath110 for @xmath111 . for a given @xmath90",
    ", we can estimate the flux , say , at @xmath112 gev , respectively ( see lines shown in fig.[cta ] ) . as a conservative estimate",
    ", we assume that the exposure time is half an hour , for which the cta sensitivities as a function of photon energy can be found in fig.24 of @xcite .",
    "one can find in fig.[cta ] that the @xmath113 gev emission might be a bit challenging to be detected by cta unless the observation started very early , for example , within one hour after the grb trigger .",
    "the @xmath114 gev emission could be detectable in a few hours after the trigger while the detection prospect of @xmath56 gev emission is even more promising .    in view of these facts",
    ", we conclude that ( 1 ) for the hard spectrum of the high energy ( @xmath115 ) afterglow emission of grb 131231a , the model of synchrotron radiation of the shock - accelerated electrons or protons is less likely while the synchrotron self - compton scattering origin is favored ; ( 2 ) the fireball was in slow - cooling phase and the circum - burst medium had a constant density profile ; ( 3 ) cta could significantly detect tens of gev afterglow emission of grb 131231a - like events and then play an important role in revealing the underlying physical process(es ) .",
