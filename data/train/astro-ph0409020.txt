    "solar system tests provide a number of very stringent tests of einstein s theory of general relativity ( gr ) , and to date gr has passed all observational tests with flying colours .",
    "nevertheless , the fundamental question remains as to whether einstein has the last word in our understanding of gravity or not .",
    "solar - system experiments are all made in the weak - field regime and will never be able to provide tests in the strong - field limit which is largely unexplored .",
    "tests involving the observations of x - ray binaries may help , but the interpretation of these results depends to some extent on models which are known with only limited precision .",
    "in contrast , pulsars represent accurate clocks which can , in a binary orbit , allow us to perform high precision tests of gravitational theories . in the following",
    "we describe a key - science project developed for the ska with a number of colleagues , namely don backer , jim cordes , simon johnston , joe lazio and ben stappers .",
    "details can be found in @xcite .",
    "through its sensitivity , sky and frequency coverage , the ska will discover a very large fraction of the pulsars in the galaxy , resulting in about 20,000 pulsars .",
    "this number represents essentially all active pulsars that are beamed toward earth and includes the discovery of more than 1,000 millisecond pulsars ( msps ) .",
    "this impressive yield effectively samples every possible outcome of the evolution of massive binary stars .",
    "the sensitivity of the ska allows much shorter integration times , so that searches for compact binary pulsars will no longer be limited . among the discovered sources , pulsar - black hole ( psr - bh ) systems are to be expected .",
    "being timed with the ska , a psr - bh system would be an amazing probe of relativistic gravity with a discriminating power that surpasses all of its present and foreseeable competitors @xcite .",
    "as stars rotate , astrophysicists also expect bhs to rotate , giving rise to both a bh spin and quadrupole moment .",
    "the resulting gravito - magnetic field causes a relativistic frame - dragging in the bh vicinity , leading the orbit of any test mass about the bh to precess if the orbit deviates from the equatorial plane .",
    "the consequences for timing a pulsar around a bh have been studied in detail by wex & kopeikin ( 1999 @xcite ) , who showed that the study of the orbital dynamics allows us to use the orbiting pulsar to probe the properties of the rotating bh . not only can the mass of the bh be measured with very high accuracy , but the spin of the bh can also be determined precisely using the nonlinear - in - time , secular changes in the observable quantities due to _ relativistic _ spin - orbit coupling",
    ". the anisotropic nature of the quadrupole moment of the external gravitational field will produce characteristic short - term periodicities due to _ classical _ spin - orbit coupling , every time the pulsar gets close to the oblate bh companion @xcite .",
    "therefore , the mass , @xmath0 , and both the dimensionless spin @xmath1 and quadrupole @xmath2 , @xmath3 of the bh can be determined , where @xmath4 is the angular momentum and @xmath5 the quadrupole moment .",
    "these measured properties of a bh can be confronted with predictions of gr .    in gr ,",
    "the curvature of space - time diverges at the centre of a bh , producing a singularity , which physical behaviour is unknown .",
    "the cosmic censorship conjecture was invoked by penrose in 1969 ( see e.g.  @xcite ) to resolve the fundamental concern that if singularities could be seen from the rest of space - time , the resulting physics may be unpredictable .",
    "the cosmic censorship conjecture proposes that singularities are always hidden within the event horizons of bhs , so that they can not be seen by a distant observer .",
    "a singularity that is found not to be hidden but `` naked '' would contradict this cosmic censorship .",
    "in other words , the complete gravitational collapse of a body always results in a bh rather than a naked singularity ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "we can test this conjecture by measuring the spin of a rotating bh : in gr we expect @xmath6 . if , however , ska observations uncover a massive , compact object with @xmath7 , two important conclusions may be drawn .",
    "either we finally probe a region where gr is wrong , or we have discovered a collapsed object where the event horizon has vanished and where the singularity is exposed to the outside world .    one may expect a complicated relationship between the spin of the bh , @xmath1 , and its quadrupole moment , @xmath2 .",
    "however , for a rotating kerr bh in gr , both properties share a simple , fundamental relationship @xcite , i.e.  @xmath8 .",
    "this equation reflects the `` no - hair '' theorem which implies that the external gravitational field of an astrophysical ( uncharged ) bh is fully determined by its mass and spin .",
    "therefore , by determining @xmath2 and @xmath1 from timing measurements with the ska , we can confront this fundamental prediction of gr for the very first time .",
    "the best timing precision would be provided by a psr - bh system with a msp companion .",
    "such systems do not evolve in standard scenarios , but they can be created in regions of high stellar density due to exchange interactions . prime survey targets would therefore be the innermost regions of our galaxy and globular clusters . finding pulsars in orbits around massive or super - massive bhs would allow us to apply the same techniques for determining their properties as for the stellar counterpart @xcite .",
    "since the spin and quadrupole moment of a bh scale with its mass squared and mass cubed , respectively , relativistic effects would be measured much easier .",
    "the ska will discover a dense array of msps distributed across the sky .",
    "being timed to very high precision ( @xmath9100 ns ) , this `` pulsar timing array '' ( pta ) acts as a cosmic gravitational wave ( gw ) detector . each pulsar and the earth",
    "can be considered as free masses whose positions respond to changes in the space - time metric .",
    "a passing gravitational wave perturbs the metric and hence affects the pulse travel time and the measured arrival time at earth @xcite . with observing times of a few years ,",
    "pulsars are sensitive to gws frequencies of @xmath10 , hence in the @xmath11nhz range .",
    "consequently , the ska can detect the signal of a stochastic background of gw emission in a frequency range that is complementary to that covered by lisa and ligo .",
    "a stochastic gravitational wave background should arise from a variety of sources .",
    "cosmological sources include inflation , string cosmology , cosmic strings and phase transitions ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "we can write the intensity of this gw background as @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the energy density of the stochastic background and @xmath14 is the present value of the critical energy density for closure of the universe , @xmath15 with @xmath16 km s@xmath17 mpc@xmath17 as the hubble constant . a contribution to the gw background",
    "is also expected from astrophysical processes , i.e.  the coalescence of massive bh binaries during early galaxy evolution @xcite .",
    "the amplitude of this signal depends on the mass function of the massive bhs and their merger rate @xcite .",
    "measuring the slope of the spectrum would allow us to discriminate between this foreground signal and the cosmological sources .",
    "the wedge - like sensitivity curve of the pta is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : gwspec ] . for timing precision that is only limited by radiometer noise ,",
    "the rms is expected to scale with the collecting area of the observing telescope . in reality , the precision is also affected by other effects . their limiting influence and the application of correction schemes will need to be determined on a case by case basis .",
    "however , extrapolating from the experience with the best performing msps today , we can expect the ska to improve on the current limit on @xmath18 by a factor @xmath19 !"
