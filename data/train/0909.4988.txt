    "the transport of mobile modifier ions in silicate glasses below the glass transition takes place in a basically fixed environment provided by the glass structure . besides the disordered structure of the network ,",
    "the coulomb interactions among the mobile ions add significantly to the complexity of the underlying energy landscape , because their contribution is both long  ranged and non  static .",
    "a hopping picture of the dynamics has been widely accepted,@xcite based on evidence for the existence of well defined ionic sites , from experiments@xcite and also from simulations@xcite .",
    "basically hopping models describe the glass system by a representation of the effective energy landscape experienced by the ions .",
    "the conformational disorder of the network is typically represented by a distribution of site  energies .",
    "they are treated as static , relying on the separation of timescales between ion dynamics and structural relaxation.@xcite energy values for individual sites and barriers are normally treated as independent of each other in realizations by lattice models ; see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "this common assumption is however not trivial , and it has been dropped in at least one case.@xcite numerical investigations of such simplified models have established that the coulomb interaction between the mobile ions is required for a completely correct representation of the dynamics,@xcite and a quantitative model of the ionic conductivity has been built with the interactions among the ions as the main element.@xcite most other approaches however disregard the coulomb interaction among the mobile ions.@xcite this immediately raises the question whether the coulomb interaction can be simply taken into account by a local modification of the energy landscape .",
    "recently a statistical method allowed us the identification of all ionic sites in realistic molecular dynamics @xmath0",
    "simulations.@xcite most of the conclusions have been confirmed by other groups . @xcite . by direct observation of the ion hopping dynamics , key predictions about the ion dynamics",
    "could be tested.@xcite .",
    "furthermore , different spatial aspects of the conduction paths have been reported @xcite .",
    "most of the hopping models mentioned above use the concept of site  energies .",
    "however , typically the properties of these site ",
    "energies are postulated in an ad - hoc manner . in the present work",
    "we express the properties of the energy landscape via explicitly determined site - energies .",
    "these are obtained based on our @xmath0 simulations of alkali silicate systems , from time - averages of the particle energy of the ion residing in a site .",
    "two key questions are addressed : what are the properties of the site ",
    "energies for a real ion conductor ? do these site ",
    "energies indeed determine thermodynamic or dynamic properties of the corresponding sites ?",
    "in particular , since the coulomb interaction between cations can be expected to be strong , it is not evident a priori that it can be taken into account as merely a contribution to single - particle or , equivalently , single  site energies .",
    "this aspect is discussed in detail by examining the correlation of site ",
    "energies to thermodynamical and dynamical observables .",
    "in our md simulations the potential energy is given by pair interactions as @xmath1 .",
    "the interaction potential @xmath2 consists of the coulomb interaction for point charges @xmath3 and of a short range part @xmath4 of born - mayer type .",

    ", single - particle energies @xmath6 can be computed just like @xmath7 as the sum of all pair contributions @xmath8 involving the particle @xmath9 , @xmath10 . while @xmath11 , any change @xmath12 to the energy of the system resulting from a change of particle @xmath9 is directly given by @xmath13 . considering a cation as particle @xmath9 , the contribution to @xmath6 only from interactions with e.g. other cations",
    "can furthermore be isolated simply by restricting the sum to the appropriate @xmath14 .",
    "the situation is complicated by the use of periodic boundary conditions : to avoid finite - size effects , the system is treated as an infinite repetition of periodic images of the simulation box.@xcite due to the long range nature of the coulomb interaction , it can not be computed by simple summation up to a finite cutoff in this case . instead",
    "all periodic images of the simulation box must be taken into account .",
    "we use the ewald method@xcite for this purpose , where the coulomb energy is broken into three formal contributions : only the real part @xmath15 is a pair term like @xmath4 ; the fourier part @xmath16 relates to the infinite set of periodic images of particle @xmath14 , and the self - correction @xmath17 is globally assigned to particle @xmath9 only .",
    "yet a deeper analysis shows that the coulomb part @xmath18 of a single - particle energy can still be assembled from these terms , and that it can still be divided into contributions from groups of like particles .",
    "one can notably still separate the interaction of a cation with other cations @xmath19 from the interaction with network atoms @xmath20 , because @xmath17 can be traced exclusively to the cation part .",
    "a constant correction@xcite for the nonzero charge of the partial systems under consideration is neglected , because it does not affect the results of this study , where energy differences are relevant .",
    "as the locations and structural properties of the sites are stable on the time scale of alkali ion diffusion , the potential energy of cation @xmath9 is determined by the site @xmath21 it occupies . a site ",
    "energy @xmath22 can therefore be identified by taking the time average over the particle energy of the ions @xmath23 residing in @xmath24 at any given time @xmath25 , i.e. @xmath26 . like the particle energies , the total value of the site  energy @xmath27 is separated into the contributions @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",

    "energies , introduced so far , provide an average view of the energy landscape , as it is adopted by most hopping models . in principle one might envisage a scenario where dynamical events induce systematic changes in the local configuration .",
    "specifically the energy of a site might change as a consequence of an ionic jump .",
    "for example , in the migration concept @xcite an ion , jumping to a site , is thought to be gradually stabilized by the subsequent adaption of the other ions to that jump . in this scenario",

    "here we restrict ourselves to the system @xmath32 .",
    "a possible time - dependence would naturally depend on the typical residence time of an ion in a site .",

    "the time dependencies of the energies from the start and from the end of the residence were both investigated .",
    "the positive direction of time was defined in both cases away from the nearest jump , such that the plotted time increases always towards the middle of the residence .",

    "is identical within the errors , given by either error bars or symbol size .",
    "it is clearly seen that , if at all , @xmath44 and @xmath41 slightly change with time for the shortest residences . after their addition to the total energy @xmath38 only unsystematic fluctuations remain . in conclusion no energetic relaxations are observed when an ion reaches a site , or before it leaves . the average site ",
    "energies are therefore the appropriate quantities for a deeper analysis of the behavior of the systems .      the residence times are linked to the site ",
    "energies in an indirect way , via the height of the energy barrier between two sites . while it is probably not crucial , this complication is absent for the thermodynamic occupation probabilities of the sites , which should depend directly on their energies via a fermi distribution .    in fig .",

    "energies @xmath38 found in the @xmath64 system was propagated in a monte carlo simulation .",
    "the occupation data from this simulation , given by the open circles , nicely agrees with the theoretical fermi function .",

    "the deviations of ion behavior from expectations based on the average energies , like the fermi distribution for relative occupations , can be understood when considering the effect of ion - ion interactions . to visualize this effect we use a very simple model with @xmath70 sites and @xmath71 ions .",
    "this choice reflects the observed small number of free sites .",
    "let @xmath29 denote the energy of an ion at site @xmath24 due to the interaction with the network .",
    "furthermore , @xmath72 denotes the additional energy of an ion at site @xmath24 due to the interaction with the other ions under the condition that site @xmath25 ( @xmath73 ) is empty .",
    "one expects a small but significant dependence of @xmath72 on @xmath25 , e.g. , via the distance of site @xmath25 to site @xmath24 .",
    "furthermore , this term also contains possible correction effects of the network energy because the network structure may also depend on the actual ionic configuration .",
    "the energy @xmath74 $ ] thus denotes the total energy of the system under the condition that site @xmath25 is vacant .",
    "correspondingly , the equilibrium probability @xmath75 that site @xmath25 is empty is proportional to @xmath76 .    for this model one can first calculate the average energy @xmath27 related to site @xmath24 .",
    "it is given by @xmath77 via the boltzmann average this expression implies that the typical residence time is longer than the typical energy fluctuations via jumps of surrounding particles .",
    "this ansatz is compatible with the simulation results because the fluctuations of the energy are much faster than typical residence times ( @xmath78 . the probability that site @xmath24 is occupied by an ion can be calculated as @xmath79 in fig .",

    "they are considered as random numbers , drawn from a narrower box distribution @xmath82 $ ] .",
    "one can clearly see that now significant deviations from the fermi distribution are observed .",

    "in one case ( circles ) the ion - ion interaction does not depend on the position of the vacancy , in the other case ( squares ) a weak dependence has been taken into account ( see text for details).,width=325 ]",
    "the site  energies that are the basis for this investigation of the energy landscape for ionic transport can be determined with good precision as averages from long molecular dynamics simulations . while there are fast fluctuations , the mean value of the site  energy is stable on the timescale of the typical residence of alkali ions in a site . the observed stability of the site  energies and the absence of relevant relaxations on longer time scales , i.e. on the scale of ionic diffusion or beyond , are necessary conditions for our analysis .",
    "a description of the energy landscape through a distribution of static site  energies , as it is used in most hopping models , is well justified by these results .",
    "our analysis demonstrates that fundamental properties of the energy landscape assumed by these models depend on the coulomb interaction among the cations .",
    "strong correlations in the network energies of neighbor sites are canceled out by the cation interaction to yield a nearly random landscape .",
    "both the spatial correlations in @xmath41 and its anticorrelation with @xmath44 are reproduced by the counter ion model@xcite by using full coulomb interactions between mobile cations and fixed anions on a lattice .",
    "arguably , any realistic energy landscape for a hopping model must at least implicitly incorporate effects of the cation interaction . one further example is the introduction of spatial correlations into the energy landscape of a model designed to reproduce the internal friction of mixed ",
    "alkali glasses.@xcite    both observed correlations in the landscape can be tentatively explained by an argument similar to that used by greaves in favor of conduction",
    "channels.@xcite he stated that any non  bridging oxygen ( nbo ) in the structure has to be shared between several cations in order to fulfill all coordination requirements .",
    "aided by the long range of the coulomb interaction , the presence of an nbo can thus influence the energies of several neighboring sites alike .",
    "higher numbers of available nbos will similarly favor not a single site , but a region of the system .",
    "but such a region will be energetically favorable to the cations only just until their mutual repulsion balances the effect of the structure , giving rise to the observed anticorrelation .",
    "the correlations between neighboring sites and between the different contributions at one site are in turn essential for features of the landscape that directly affect the dynamics . while barrier heights for jumps between sites were not determined , the difference between two site ",
    "energies gives a lower bound for the barrier for the transition between them .",
    "although the correlations in @xmath41 limit the occurring differences , the additional smoothing of the landscape by the anticorrelated @xmath44 is necessary to reach values as small as 0.33 ev for @xmath32 .",
    "interestingly , this value is significantly smaller than the macroscopic activation energy of 0.66 ev .",
    "two reasons may play a role .",
    "one may expect that the barriers between the sites also make a significant contribution to the macroscopic activation energy .",
    "moreover we have seen that the local dynamics is only weakly correlated with the local energy .    in fig .",
    "[ fig_timefit ] the correlations between site  energies and residence times are obscured by scatter that dominates the results for most sites .",
    "the larger values of @xmath41 observed for slow sites suggest a low density of non - bridging oxygen ( nbos ) atoms and , correspondingly , a high density of bridging oxygen ( bos ) nearby .",
    "this is fully compatible with the previous observation that sites with long residence times are surrounded by a larger number of bos@xcite .",
    "the physical reason is that the jump process of an ion is supplemented by an instantaneous local door - opening effect of oxygen atoms @xcite . in case where the neighborhood contains bos the door - opening effect",
    "is reduced , giving rise to a longer residence time .",
    "this structural trend is however only sufficient to indicate very slow sites , just as the network energies support only a general relationship , but no clear prediction of the dynamics at any individual site .",
    "the even weaker dependence of the residence times on @xmath38 indicates that the average site energies do not capture all effects of the added cation interaction on the local dynamics .    but also considering equilibrium properties the full site  energies , with the cation interaction included , have still proven insufficient to determine the behavior of ions at the individual sites . the most fundamental test for the importance of the site ",
    "energies in our systems is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_fermi ] , where the influence of the site  energies on their occupation probability is investigated .",
    "the relative occupation of the sites deviates fundamentally from the expected fermi dependence .",
    "these observations clearly indicate that average single  site  energies , as defined here ( thus , taking into account the long - range interaction ) and used in many of the models of ion conduction , do not contain the complete information .",
    "the simple model analyzed in fig . [ fig_simple_fermi ] suggests the reason : coupling of the site ",
    "energies to other , distant parts of the system makes states of identical local occupation energetically non - equivalent . in consequence",
    "the statistics yielding e.g. the fermi distribution are disrupted . in the glass simulated by the md model , the fluctuations of the site  energy",
    "are fast compared to the duration of a residence .",
    "but for the case of only a few unoccupied sites the relaxation rate also strongly depends on the availability of free nearby sites .",
    "as jumps happen with delays much shorter than the total residence times once a free site is available , the effective timescale on which the site  energy acts on the occupation becomes comparable to the timescale of fast energy fluctuations . as a consequence only a weak correlation between residence time and site  energy is to be expected .",
    "we have shown that it is possible to describe the energy landscape for ion conduction in a glass in terms of stable average site  energies .",
    "the analysis of site ",
    "energies has established a central influence of the cation interaction on the basic properties of the energy landscape . yet average site ",
    "energies including cation interactions are still insufficient to predict the ion dynamics directly .",
    "the dependence of the site  energies on the ionic configuration , and the low number of free sites , which regulates the possibility for jumps independently from the energies , are demonstrated as the likely causes .    a direct description of the dynamics starting from site",
    " energies will therefore not be able to capture the correlations among the ions .",
    "instead the falsification of the single  energy picture suggests that alternative ways should be explored to build a description of the ion dynamics from information about the energy landscape .",
    "in particular a treatment in terms of vacancies seems promising@xcite because due to their small concentration interaction effects can be expected to be negligible . they offer an equivalent description of the ion dynamics , without loss of microscopic detail , because every jump of an ion can be replaced by a corresponding jump of a vacancy .",
