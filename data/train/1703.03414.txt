    "by the time nicolaus copernicus postulated that the earth revolves around the sun  and not vice versa  humans had already been studying eclipses for thousands of years @xcite . indeed ,",
    "one of the oldest - known astrophysical phenomena is syzygy , when three or more celestial bodies become co - linear .",
    "although often defined in terms of the sun , moon and earth only , syzygys could involve other solar system bodies , and more than three total .",
    "@xcite computed the frequencies of a variety of solar system syzygys , and @xcite provided specific examples , such as when the sun , venus , earth , jupiter and saturn achieved syzygy in the year 1683 , and when the sun , venus , jupiter and saturn will achieve syzygy in the year 2040 .    in the argot of astronomers , the terms _",
    "eclipse _ , _ transit _ , and _ occultation _ have come to represent syzygy in different contexts ( e.g. the sun is eclipsed , whereas exo - planets transit , and stars are occulted ) .",
    "semantics aside , the geometrical configuration provided by a syzygy yields invaluable information .",
    "the sun s corona is visible from earth only during particular types of syzygys , the rings around the asteroid chariklo were detected only because of a different type of syzygy @xcite , and the first putative detection of rings around an exo - moon were made possible because of syzygys @xcite .",
    "in fact , exo - planetary systems containing multiple planets which transit their parent star or stars have the potential to be `` most information - rich planetary systems besides our own solar system '' @xcite .",
    "the idea of exo - syzygy is not just a possibility , but a reality : exo - planets like kepler-1647  b have already achieved syzygy with both of its parent stars and the earth @xcite .",
    "almost ubiquitously , syzygys have been studied by assuming a viewpoint on or close to the earth s surface .",
    "however , the motivation for studying syzygys in a more general context has now received added impetus with ( i ) the numerous space missions that visit other parts of the solar system ( and beam back data from a variety of viewpoints ) , and ( ii ) the febrile desire to find habitable planets and understand what life is like on them .",
    "cassini , messenger and new horizons are but a few of the robotic spacecraft which have provided us with different perspectives .",
    "the great fortune that our nearest stellar neighbour ( proxima centuri ) happens to host a detectable planet in the habitable zone @xcite has provided an ideal flyby candidate for the breakthrough starshot mission , which has already received significant financial backing .    here",
    ", we formulate a geometry for three - body syzygys in a general - enough context for wide applications and which yields an easy - to - apply collection of formulae given only the radii and mutual distances of the three bodies .",
    "we then apply the formulae to a wide variety of solar system syzygys and extrasolar syzygys .",
    "we begin in section 2 by establishing our setup .",
    "we then place eclipses into context for three different combinations of stars , planets and moons in sections 3 - 5 by providing limits in each case from the results of the derivations in appendices a and b and from stability criteria .",
    "we apply our formulae to a plethora of specific cases for the solar system in section 6 and for extrasolar systems in sections 7 - 8 .",
    "we conclude with a useful algorithm , including a user - friendly flow chart , in section 9 .",
    "all data used in the applications are taken from two sources unless otherwise specified : the jet propulsion laboratory solar system dynamics website and the exoplanet data explorer .",
    "we model planetary systems that include three spherical bodies , at least one of which is a star . because we consider the systems only at syzygy , no motion is assumed , allowing for a general treatment with wide applicability .",
    "we denote the star as the `` primary '' , the body on or around which an observer / detector might see an eclipse as the `` target '' , and the occulting / transiting / eclipsing body as the `` occulter '' .",
    "the occulter may be a planet ( case i ) , star ( case ii ) or moon ( case iii ) , and we consider these individual cases in turn in sections 3 - 5 .",
    "we denote the radii of the primary , occulter and target to be , respectively @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , and the pairwise distances between the centres of the objects as @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "we assume that the primary is the largest of the three objects , such that @xmath6 and @xmath7 , but make no assumptions about the relative sizes of the occulter and target .",
    "all results are derived in terms of the radii and mutual distances only .",
    "the masses of the bodies @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 rarely factor in the equations , but regardless are convenient identifiers for diagrams and will primarily be used for that purpose .",
    "the values of any two of @xmath3 , @xmath5 and @xmath4 may be given , allowing for trivial computation of the third value .",
    "for cases i and ii , when the occulter is a planet or star , the astrocentric distances @xmath3 and @xmath5 are often known , whereas for case iii , when the occulter is a moon , @xmath5 and @xmath4 are often known from observations .    however , in both observational and theoretical studies , orbits with respect to centres of mass ( as in barycentric and jacobi coordinates ) are sometimes more valuable .",
    "denote @xmath11 as the distance of the target to the centre of mass of the primary and occulter .",
    "then    @xmath12    observations from earth rarely catch three - bodies in an exo - planetary system in syzygy .",
    "therefore , instantaneously measured or estimated mutual distances may not be as helpful as orbital parameters , such as semimajor axis @xmath13 , eccentricity @xmath14 and true anomaly @xmath15 .",

    "the three bodies achieve syzygy .",
    "the inclinations , longitudes of ascending nodes and arguments of pericentre of the bodies help determine eclipse details associated with motion ( such as duration length ) ; here we consider only the static case at syzygy , and hence are unconcerned with these other parameters , as well as the time at which the true anomalies achieve syzygy .      in all cases ,",
    "the radiation emanating from the primary will form two different types of cones with the occulter , because the latter is smaller than the former .",

    "if the target intersects the umbral cone at syzygy , then a total eclipse will occur as seen by an observer on the target .",
    "the projected area of the total eclipse area is defined by the radius @xmath17 .",

    "we now apply our geometrical formalism to three general cases , starting with that of a planet occulter .",
    "one specific example of this case would be mercury transiting the sun as viewed from earth .",

    "because circumbinary planets are now known to be common and will continue to represent a source for some of the most fascinating planetary systems in the foreseeable future @xcite , the case of a stellar occulter is important to consider . when a system contains two stars and one circumbinary planet , then the planet s orbital elements",
    "are usually measured with respect to the centre of mass of the stars ( and contain a subscript of `` 123 '' , as indicated in section 2 ) .",

    "we can now take the relation even further .",
    "if we know that the planet is on a circular orbit ( @xmath41 ) , then we may use the stability boundary of equation 3 of @xcite , which yields ( still assuming @xmath42 ) ,    @xmath43    @xmath44.\\ ] ]    this boundary , along with the assumptions of circularity and equal stellar densities , allow us to write the condition for ensuring total eclipses on the target in terms of only the stellar radii as    @xmath45    @xmath46    we plot fig .",

    "we find    @xmath50",
    "for a moon occulter ( such as the sun - earth - moon system ) , we follow a similar procedure as to the last two sections in order to provide relations which establish parameter space regimes in which total eclipses can never or always occur .    first we note that additional constraints can be imposed on the moon s orbital size , from both below and above .",
    "these constraints may be used with the formulae below depending on what quantities are known . as detailed in @xcite",
    ", moons can exist in stable orbits if they reside somewhere outside of the roche , or disruption , radius of the planet , and inside about one - half of a hill radius ( see also @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) .",

    "@xmath53 is a constant which can take on a variety of values depending on the body s shape , composition and spin , and typically span the range 0.78 - 1.53 ( table 1 of * ? ? ?",
    "although a common value of @xmath54 is 0.5 , it is dependent on the direction of revolution and other properties of the moon .      in the context of typically - known orbital elements in systems with a moon ,",

    "hence , because the equation sometimes holds , the moon sometimes produces total eclipses , and sometimes does not .      in a similar fashion , the condition to ensure that total eclipses will occur ( equation [ alwminmax ] ) gives    @xmath58    or , by neglecting a @xmath25 term ,    @xmath59 }         { 1+e_{23 } }         \\label{moon1 }         .\\ ] ]",
