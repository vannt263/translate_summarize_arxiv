    "of the @xmath6 radio pulsars detected so far , 51 have also been found in the x - rays @xcite .",
    "these x - ray emitting pulsars represent a wide range of ages ( @xmath7  yrs ) , magnetic field strengths ( @xmath8  g ) , periods ( 1.6  530  ms ) and spectral properties . in particular , while non - thermal ( power law ) emission is supposed to dominate in the youngest objects ( like the crab ) , the soft x - ray radiation of rotation - powered pulsars with ages as large as @xmath9  yrs should be dominated by thermal emission from the neutron star ( ns ) surface ( see e.g. becker & pavlov 2002 for a recent review ) .",
    "these `` middle - aged pulsars '' are old enough for their magnetospheric emission to have decreased and become fainter than the thermal one . at the same time",
    ", they are young enough that the ns surface is not too cool for its thermal radiation to still be detectable in the x - rays .",
    "there are three middle - aged pulsars for which a thermal component , interpreted as thermal emission from the surface , has certainly been observed : geminga , psr  b0656 + 14 and b1055 - 52 ( dubbed the _ three musketeers _ by becker & trmper 1997 ) . due to its age",
    ", a dominant thermal component was also expected from psr  j0538 + 2817 .",
    "psr  j0538 + 2817  is a 143  ms pulsar located in the direction of the galactic anti - center @xcite .",
    "the source was detected during an untargeted pulsar survey at 430  mhz using the 305  m arecibo radio telescope @xcite .",
    "psr  j0538 + 2817  is located at a distance of 1.2  kpc ( using the model of cordes & lazio 2002 ) , with a spin down age of @xmath10  yrs .",
    "the source is believed to be associated with the supernova remnant s147 @xcite as the distance to the pulsar and the remnant are consistent , as are their ages .",
    "sun et al .",
    "( 1996 ) detected x - ray emission from psr  j0538 + 2817  using data from the rosat all sky survey ( rass ) .",
    "however , the photon statistics from the rass were not good enough to perform timing or spectral studies .",
    "marginal evidence was found for pulsed gamma - ray emission at the radio period from photon arrival time analysis of egret data @xcite .",
    "psr  j0538 + 2817  is a factor 510 more distant than geminga , and only the large collective area of _ xmm - newton _  has now made it possible to obtain good spectral information . in this paper",
    "we report on _ xmm - newton _  observations of psr  j0538 + 2817and present timing and spectral analyses of the source .",
    "psr  j0538 + 2817  was observed with _ xmm - newton _  for @xmath1118  ks on 2002 march 8 as a part of the guaranteed time program . the following analysis uses data from the three european photon imaging camera ( epic ) instruments : two epic mos detectors @xcite and the epic pn detector @xcite .",
    "the thin optical blocking filter was used on the pn . to provide a temporal resolution of 6  ms , which is needed for timing studies of millisecond pulsars ,",
    "the pn was operated in _ small window _ mode .",
    "the mos1 was operated in _ full window _ ( imaging ) mode with a time resolution of 1.4  s. in order to obtain better temporal resolution the mos2 was operated in _ timing mode _ ; in this mode data from the central ccd are collapsed into a one - dimensional row to achieve a 1.5  ms time resolution .",
    "the medium filter was used for both mos observations .",
    "observations of psr  j0538 + 2817  were taken with the resolution grating spectrometer ( rgs ) , however we did not detect enough photons for a meaningful analysis .",
    "we also do not detect the pulsar in the images taken with the om .",
    "we are unable to determine a realistic upper limit for the optical detection of psr  j0538 + 2817  as the position of the pulsar is coincident with the stray light effect in the om image .    we reduced the epic data with the _ xmm - newton _  science analysis system ( sas v5.3.0 ) . to maximize the signal - to - noise we filtered the data to include only single , double , triple and quadruple photon events for mos , and only single and double photon events for pn .",
    "we find no evidence for any extended emission in a spatial analysis of the mos and pn data , indicating that psr  j0538 + 2817  is consistent with being a point source from _ xmm - newton _  observations .",
    "we extracted data for the source within a radius of 30@xmath12 for the pn and mos1 instruments . while this radius encircles 100% of the flux for psr  j0538 + 2817  in the mos1 , only 89% of the flux",
    "is encompassed for the pn .",
    "however , due to the position of the source on the pn detector we are restricted in our choice of radii .",
    "hence , the flux measured from the pn is corrected for in the following analyses .",
    "selection of the photons from the mos2 event file was achieved by extracting 100% of the flux within a rectangular region centered on the source .    in our temporal analysis",
    "we consider data within the 0.215  kev energy range for the epic mos2 and pn instruments .",
    "the timing studies were performed on barycentrically corrected mos2 and pn event files .",
    "we used mos1 and pn data to produce spectra of psr  j0538 + 2817 .",
    "we subtracted a background which was extracted from an annulus around the source fiducial region .",
    "we also created the corresponding photon redistribution matrix ( rmf ) and ancillary region file ( arf ) .",
    "we determine a predicted pulse period for psr  j0538 + 2817  from the radio measurements @xcite at the epoch of our _ xmm - newton _  observations ( mjd 2452341.5 ) , assuming a linear spin - down rate .",
    "it is possible however that glitches could alter the period from the predicted value .",
    "therefore we searched for a pulsed signal in the pn ( @xmath116500 photons ) and mos2 ( @xmath113300 photons ) data over a wider frequency range centered on the derived radio period , p = 143.158657  ms ( @xmath13 hz ) .",
    "we have employed two methods in our search for pulsed emission from psr  j0538 + 2817 . in the first method we implement the @xmath14 test @xcite . in the second method",
    "we calculate the rayleigh statistic ( see de jager 1991 ; mardia 1972 ) and then calculate the maximum likelihood periodogram ( mlp ) using the @xmath15-statistic @xcite to determine significant periodicities in the datasets ( see zane et al .",
    "the advantage of this method is that the @xmath15-statistic makes no assumptions about the distribution of the data , and is itself distributed as @xmath16 which allows one to determine errors for the periods detected directly from the periodogram .",
    "we searched the pn data ( 0.215 kev ) for a periodic signal using the @xmath14 test , with the number of harmonics @xmath17 being varied from 1 to 10 .",
    "we find that in order to optimize the signal - to - noise ( @xmath18/@xmath19 ) ratio we must use the value @xmath20 .",
    "the resulting @xmath21 periodogram is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ztest ] ( top , left panel ) .",
    "we find a peak at @xmath22 hz , which , within the quoted 90% uncertainty range , is consistent with the predicted radio frequency given above , @xmath23 hz . the @xmath21-statistic for this peak is 65.67 , which has a probability of chance occurrence of @xmath24 .",
    "frequencies of this order are detected at the values expected , given radio measurements , in similar objects ( j.a .",
    "kennea 2003 , private communication ) .    the corresponding @xmath21 periodogram for the mos2 data ( 0.215 kev ) is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ztest ] ( top , right panel ) .",
    "we note that the noise level is much greater in the mos2 periodogram compared to that for the pn data .",
    "the largest peak near to the predicted radio frequency , and the second largest peak in the periodogram , is at @xmath25 hz .",
    "this value , within the 90% confidence limit quoted , is not consistent with the frequency found in the pn data , or the derived radio frequency .",
    "if we consider the 68% uncertainty range , @xmath26 hz , the frequency is still not consistent with the predicted and pn frequencies .",
    "the probability of chance occurrence for this peak is @xmath27 .",
    "the largest peak in the mos2 periodogram occurs at @xmath28 hz .",
    "however , it is difficult to reconcile this value with the predicted radio frequency .",
    "both peaks have a low significance when compared with the noise level .    assuming that the pulsed signal we have detected in the pn data is real we have investigated the energy range over which we can detect a periodic signal for the pn data .",
    "we separated the pn data into 4 energy bands , 0.21 , 12 , 23 and 310 kev , and generated @xmath21 periodograms for each dataset .",
    "our results show that we can detect a pulsed signal in the 0.21 and 12 kev ranges , but at energies greater than 2 kev we do not find a dominant peak in the periodograms near to the predicted radio frequency .",
    "we find a peak at @xmath29 hz for the 0.21 kev data ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ztest ] , bottom , left panel ) , and at @xmath30 hz for the 12 kev data ( fig .  [ fig : ztest ] , bottom , right panel ) . both of these frequencies are consistent with the frequency found previously for the pn data ( 0.215 kev ) , and the derived radio frequency , within the 90% uncertainty range quoted .",
    "the probability of chance occurrence for the 0.21 and 12 kev peaks are @xmath31 and @xmath32 , respectively .",
    "the frequencies being consistent within different energy ranges is expected .",
    "the lower amplitude and significance of detection of pulsed emission in the separate energy ranges is simply due to the fact that fewer events are detected .",
    "we also searched for a periodic signal using the mlp method .",
    "initially we constructed the mlps using the pn and mos2 data in the 0.215 kev energy range to compare with our @xmath21 results .",
    "we find a peak for the pn data at @xmath33 hz , which is detected at the 8-sigma level ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mlp ] , left panel ) .",
    "the frequency of the peak is consistent , within the 90% confidence limit , with the @xmath21 value for the pn data , and with the predicted radio frequency .",
    "the largest peak in the mos2 mlp occurs at @xmath34 hz ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mlp ] , right panel ) .",
    "while this is not consistent with the pn and predicted radio frequencies , it is in agreement with the values found from the @xmath21 test for the mos2 data . while the peak could represent a true periodicity , its significance above the noise is low .",
    "we used the mlp method on the pn data which had been separated into different energy ranges , given above .",
    "the results are in excellent agreement with the @xmath21 test , again with the significance and amplitude of the detection decreasing with number of events .",
    "while our results indicate that we have detected pulsed emission from psr  j0538 + 2817  in the pn data , the absence of a periodic signal at a similar frequency , within the 90% confidence limit , in the mos2 data is worrying .",
    "however , we note that the mos2 receives @xmath35% of the flux that is received by the pn , and that the quantum efficiency of the mos instruments is poorer than that for the pn , especially in the softer energies where we are detecting the pulsed signal . despite these factors ,",
    "the most important consideration for this analysis is the @xmath18/@xmath19 ratio for the pn and mos2 data .",
    "our pn data has @xmath18/@xmath36 , while for the mos2 we have @xmath18/@xmath37 .",
    "this suggests that the lack of signal in the mos2 data is hampering the period search ; our results for the mos2 temporal analysis being consistent with noise is perhaps not surprising .",
    "the frequency found from the @xmath21 test for the pn data in the 0.215 and the 0.21 kev band , @xmath38 hz , deviates from the derived radio frequency by 0.0000021  hz , or 0.000043  ms . we have folded the pn light curves in the 0.215 , 0.21 , 12 and 210  kev bands using our detected frequency , and the radio ephemeris ( mjd 2449564.5 ) .",
    "the 0.215  kev light curve ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lc ] , top panel ) has a pulse fraction of @xmath39% .",
    "the pulse profile is clearly asymmetric with a slower rise to and faster fall from maximum .",
    "indicative of this asymmetry , a sinusoidal fit to the light curve can be excluded with @xmath40 .",
    "the arrival time of the radio pulse is consistent with the maximum of the x - ray peak .",
    "the light curves in the 0.21 and 12  kev bands ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lc ] , second and third panels ) have pulse fractions of @xmath41% and @xmath42% , respectively .    in order to investigate the asymmetry in the 0.215  kev light curve we determined whether or not there is a phase shift between the 0.21 and 12  kev light curves .",
    "although the pn light curve in the 0.215  kev energy range was not well described by a sinusoid , as a first estimate to the maxima of the 0.21 and 12  kev light curves we have employed the method of fitting with a sinusoid , as these two light curves are more symmetrical . while the fit for the 12  kev light curve is improved by a factor of @xmath11 two",
    "the fit is still not optimal , and the value of @xmath43 for the 0.21  kev light curve still indicates an asymmetry .",
    "however , for estimation purposes we have marked the position of the maxima of the cosine curves for each band in fig .",
    "[ fig : lc ] .",
    "the maximum in the 0.21  kev band occurs at @xmath44 , and at @xmath45 in the 12  kev band . while this indicates that the maxima in the two bands are shifted by 0.08 in phase , corresponding to a pulse shift of 29@xmath46 , the uncertainty on the peak positions does not rule out the null hypothesis that there is zero phase shift .",
    "we note that this shift in phase is small compared to the pulse width .",
    "if the shift is real , this could be the origin of the asymmetry in the 0.215  kev light curve .    in an attempt to improve the sparse information we have from the sinusoidal fit to the pn light curve in the 0.215  kev band ,",
    "we have also modeled the brightness variation with a symmetrical polar cap model @xcite , which includes gravitational bending effects .",
    "the input parameters for the model are the angular size of the caps , the angle between the magnetic and rotation axis and that between the viewing direction and the rotation axis .",
    "the best fit to the data occurs for 20@xmath46 , 11@xmath46 and 31@xmath46 for the three angles respectively , with a @xmath47 of 1.71 .",
    "the compactness parameter @xmath48 was set to a typical value of 3 .",
    "the @xmath47 for the polar cap model is significantly better than for the sinusoidal fit with the same number of free parameters , but falls short of that required because of the symmetry of the model prediction .",
    "the absence of any sharp features in the light curve , and the absence of any asymmetry in our model results in degeneracies between the fit parameters and render the formal uncertainties on their values to be large . by exploring the parameter space",
    ", we find that a range of viewing directions between 10 and 60@xmath46 is permitted , with the angle between magnetic and rotation axis constrained to between 20 and 35@xmath46 over this range .",
    "the change in viewing direction is in fact accommodated by a change in cap size to produce the observed pulsation , with the semi - angle subtended increasing from a negligible size to 30@xmath46 as the viewing angle increases from 10 to 60@xmath46 .",
    "this analysis is therefore limited given the systematic differences between the model and the data . nevertheless , the general point that we note is that the method allows us to determine an upper limit for the emitting region .",
    "the pole cap size has to be constrained to a full angle of @xmath1165@xmath46 , otherwise the observed pulsation amplitude can not be reproduced .",
    "another factor which could be responsible for the asymmetry is aberration @xcite .",
    "this effect has been seen in radio observations of pulsars @xcite and is due to corotation which causes the radiation beams to bend toward the azimuthal direction ( the direction of rotation of the pulsar ) so that emission is received earlier than if there were no rotation .",
    "the components emitted at higher altitudes in the light cone are shifted to an earlier phase due to this aberration , resulting in an asymmetry in the location of the leading and trailing components with respect to the center of the pulse profile .",
    "for the same cone , the lower frequency radiation comes from a higher altitude , and hence is observed first , than the higher frequency radiation .",
    "the effects of aberration increase with altitude .",
    "if we assume that the emission we observe from psr  j0538 + 2817originates from close to the surface of the neutron star i.e.  a heated polar cap , and not at a height which is near to that of the light cylinder , the effects of aberration should be negligible .",
    "data from mos1 and pn were used to create spectra of psr  j0538 + 2817 . in order to preserve any features in the spectra while providing sufficient",
    "signal - to - noise , the spectra were re - binned to ensure a minimum of 15 counts in each energy bin .",
    "we fit the combined mos1 and pn spectra with the x - ray spectral analysis package xspec ( v11.1.0 ) using various models , each with interstellar absorption ( @xmath2 ) accounted for by xspec s photoelectric absorption model .",
    "the spectra were fit between 0.23 kev .",
    "we used three different methods to determine the value of @xmath2 to be used in the model fits : ( 1 ) @xmath2 was allowed to run free , ( 2 ) @xmath2 was fixed at the estimated fraction of galactic absorption in the direction and at the distance of the pulsar with a value of 1.3@xmath3 @xmath4 , ( 3 ) @xmath2 was fixed at the value of 2.5@xmath3 @xmath4 as measured from a star near to the pulsar in position and distance .",
    "psr  j0538 + 2817  is classed as a `` middle - aged '' pulsar and is thought to perhaps have similar spectral properties to the _ three musketeers _ @xcite .",
    "the spectra of psr  b0656 + 14 @xcite and b1055 - 52 @xcite are similar and can be well - fit with a model which comprises of two blackbodies and a power law ( pl ) , known as the ts+th+pl model .",
    "the current interpretation is that the pl component is due to some non - thermal magnetospheric emission , while the two blackbodies represent a soft thermal component ( ts ) emerging from most of the ns surface and a hard thermal component ( th ) which originates from heated polar caps .",
    "geminga is not bright enough to allow one to discriminate between the different components of the temperature distribution at the surface : its thermal spectrum is well - fit by a single blackbody plus power law .    in order to study the spectra of psr  j0538 + 2817 , and to investigate the pulsar s similarity to the _ three musketeers _ we fit the pn and mos1 spectra with a variety of models .",
    "these were as follows , a single blackbody , a single power law , a blackbody plus power law , a two blackbody , and the ts+th+pl model .",
    "we find that the multi - temperature models yield the same value for the temperature for both components indicating that only one blackbody is required .",
    "the large uncertainties on the power law index for the single power law , blackbody plus power law and ts+th+pl fit indicate that the pl component is not required .",
    "our results indicate that the spectra can be well - fit with a single blackbody ( fig .",
    "[ fig : spec ] , top panel ) .",
    "table 1 shows the results for the fits with different @xmath2 values as described above . comparing the @xmath47 values for the three fits , and the values of @xmath2 ,",
    "suggests that the estimate of the fraction of galactic absorption in the direction of psr  j0538 + 2817  is too low ( fit ( 2 ) ) .    from our model fit",
    "we find @xmath2 = ( @xmath49)@xmath50 @xmath4 and @xmath51 k for fit ( 1 ) in which @xmath2 is allowed to run free . the fit results in @xmath47 = 1.08 for 320 d.o.f . for fit ( 3 )",
    "in which @xmath2 is fixed at the measured value for a star at a similar distance and position as the pulsar of @xmath2 = 2.51@xmath3 @xmath4 gives @xmath52 k , with @xmath47 = 1.08 for 321 d.o.f . employing the f - test we find a probability of 0.4 which indicates that freeing @xmath2 is not warranted . in fig .",
    "[ fig : cont ] we show the error ellipses in the temperature - absorbing column plane which confirm this result .",
    "we find unabsorbed luminosities of 4.0@xmath53 ergs s@xmath54 and 2.7@xmath53 ergs s@xmath54 from xspec in the _ rosat _ 0.12.4 and 0.510  kev bands , and a blackbody luminosity of 4.6@xmath53 ergs s@xmath54 for fit ( 3 ) .",
    "the emitting radius resulting from the single blackbody fit is @xmath55  km .",
    "this indicates that the emission originates from a region which is smaller than the surface of the ns .",
    "however , the radiation radius is representative of the stellar radius only when the spectral properties of the emergent radiation are consistently accounted for . to investigate whether one can increase the emitting radius so that it represents the whole of the neutron star we have fit the data with a pure - h , non - magnetized atmospheric model @xcite which is publicly available .",
    "we note that the observed modulation in the light curve argues against the emission being generated by the full surface of the ns as implied by an atmospheric model , however the size of the emitting region determined from the model is dependent on the value of the normalization constant and can therefore represent a smaller region .",
    "typically , these models are found to require lower color temperatures and larger radii with respect to a simple blackbody .",
    "the results of the fits are given in table 2 .",

    "the standard cooling model is based on neutrino emission via the modified urca process , _ n - n _ and _ p - p _ neutrino bremsstrahlung , crust neutrino bremsstrahlung , and plasmon neutrino processes . assumptions about the form of the nucleon - nucleon force and the many - body technique used to calculate the equation of state must be made in the cooling models .",
    "the standard curve considered here ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : slane ] , solid line ) uses an equation of state of moderate stiffness .",
    "however , the distance to the pulsar derived from the atmospheric model fits are too low .",
    "we find that the fit with @xmath57 = 10  km gives a pulsar distance of 0.26  kpc , and 0.38  kpc with @xmath57 = 18  km ( see section 1 ) . while this suggests that the atmospheric model can be ruled out , we note that the model we have used is non - magnetized , and with @xmath65 g for psr  j0538 + 2817  the applicability of this model is questionable .",
    "further studies with a magnetic model must be performed to address this .",
    "we note that our spectral fits have been obtained from data which are averaged over the spin pulse .",
    "however , the pulsation can in principle be caused by a local variation in the emission properties of the ns surface , or by some absorption in a frame rotating with the ns .",
    "these effects may have implications for any spectral fitting to a mean spectrum .",
    "we have analyzed spectra of psr  j0538 + 2817  from the mos1 and pn instruments on _ xmm - newton_. we find that the spectra are well described by a single blackbody with @xmath66 k and @xmath2 = 2.5@xmath3 @xmath4 .",
    "the temperature inferred from the model fit results in an emitting radius of @xmath67  km .",
    "it is difficult to reconcile this radius with that of the whole neutron star .",
    "the higher temperature implied by the blackbody fit could indicate that there is a heating mechanism occurring at the poles i.e.  magnetospheric processes , inverse compton scattered photons above the polar cap producing electron - positron pairs resulting in surface heating by the returning positrons ( see greiveldinger et al .",
    "1996 ; harding & muslimov 2002 ) .    an inferred temperature from a blackbody",
    "fit which results in a radius which is smaller than the surface of the neutron star has been noticed in several other sources @xcite . in general , fits with un - magnetized , pure - h atmospheric cooling models give a temperature lower by a factor 1.53 , but often they also give radii that are too large ( or , equivalently , distances which are too small ) .",
    "therefore , caution must be taken in whether they are directly applicable .",
    "the same is true in the assumption that the thermal emission is due to accretion from the interstellar gas , since pure - h cooling and accretion spectra are almost indistinguishable in the x - rays @xcite .",
    "if the atmosphere is dominated by heavy - elements , the fit values from the model spectra are close to those from a blackbody , but in this case one also expects absorption lines and edges @xcite .    in the case of psr  j0538",
    "+ 2817 , we have found that a pure - h , un - magnetized atmospheric model also provides an excellent fit to the spectral data .",
    "the resulting temperature is a factor @xmath68 lower than that derived from the blackbody fit .",
    "the value is therefore high , but certainly in better agreement with that predicted by the cooling models ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : slane ] ) .",
    "however , these fits imply either very small distances to the pulsar ( @xmath69  pc ) or unacceptably large ns radii , so the applicability of these spectral models to psr  j0538 + 2817  is questionable .",
    "a similar conclusion has been reached by pavlov et al.(2002 ) in the case of psr  0656 + 14 , based on _ chandra _  data .",
    "we note that in the case of psr  j0538 + 2817  fitting with a magnetized must be performed to be able to rule out conclusively an atmospheric model .",
    "psr  j0538 + 2817  has often been claimed to be potentially similar to other middle - aged sources , psr  b0656 + 14 , b1055 - 52 and geminga ( the _ three musketeers _ , see table [ tab3 ] ) .",
    "as noted in section  [ sect : spec ] the power law component is detected in the spectra of the _ three musketeers_. results from _ rosat _ indicate that all of the three objects exhibit a pulse shift of @xmath70 at @xmath71  kev , and an increase in the pulse fraction ( confirming the different nature of the thermal and non - thermal emission ) .",
    "however , recent results for b1055 - 52 deduced from _ xmm - newton _  observations indicate that the pulse phase energy dependence is not as strong as suggested by _ rosat_. the surface temperatures of the _ three musketeers _ ( as taken by the blackbody fit ) are in the range ( 0.31.2)@xmath72 k which is typically too high to be reconciled with that predicted by standard cooling curves @xcite .",
    "we note that the temperature determined for psr  j0538 + 2817  from the blackbody fit is even higher .",
    "the inferred radii for the _ three musketeers _ are compatible with the equation of state of a neutron star , or smaller .",

    "+ 2817  is an extremely interesting object .",
    "its spectrum _ only _ shows a thermal component : the non - magnetospheric power law has not been detected by _ xmm - newton_. this result must be confirmed by further deep pointings : for instance , we note that in the case of b1055 - 52 the _ rosat _ spectrum was well - fit by either two blackbodies @xcite or a flatter power law @xcite . only very recently have _",
    "chandra _",
    "observations of b1055 - 52 @xcite revealed the spectral energy distribution in detail ; the _ chandra_spectrum is well - fit by the ts+th+pl model .",
    "we note that b1055 - 52 is at a distance of @xmath73  kpc and faint , psr  j0538 + 2817  is also faint and at a larger distance , hence both sources are difficult to observe .",
    "on the other hand , if confirmed , the absence , or very low level , of a hard tail in the spectrum of psr  j0538 + 2817  is peculiar .",
    "while psr  j0538 + 2817  and b1055 - 52 have similar ages , psr  j0538 + 2817  may represent a transition object between those discussed above ( psr  b0656 + 14 , b1055 - 52 and geminga ) and older ( @xmath74 yrs ) sources ( e.g. b0950 + 08 , b1929 + 10 , j0437 - 4715 ) , based on its spectral properties .",
    "the latter have a ns surface ( excluding the cap ) which is much cooler and therefore not detectable in the x - ray range",
    ". however , the polar caps may be heated by accretion or bombardment of particles thus producing the observed x - rays . in this case",
    ", the soft x - ray spectrum may be dominated by the th component discussed above .",
    "this interpretation may also help to reconcile the temperature inferred from the spectral fit of psr  j0538 + 2817which is higher than the predicted surface temperature of a ns at the age of psr  j0538 + 2817  ( and makes the comparison with the cooling curves unfounded ) .",
    "if the temperature from our blackbody fit to the spectrum of psr  j0538 + 2817  is taken as the th component , we find an upper limit , from the 90% uncertainty level , of 0.56@xmath72 k for the surface temperature ( ts ) of the neutron star .",
    "we find that the 2@xmath75 upper limit for the unabsorbed flux in the 3.010.0 kev band for a power law with a photon index of 2.0 is 5.9@xmath76 erg @xmath4 s@xmath54 .",
    "the _ xmm - newton _  observation of psr  j0538 + 2817  provides the first evidence for pulsed x - ray emission at a period which is consistent , within errors , to the predicted radio pulse period .",
    "the pulse profile is broad and slightly asymmetric , with a slower rise and more rapid decline .",
    "pulsed x - rays from psr  j0538 + 2817  could be produced via one of two mechanisms .",
    "the first is due to relativistic particles produced either in regions above the polar caps of the neutron star or in outer gaps .",
    "these particles are accelerated by the magnetic field which is aligned with the electric field and/or the drop in potential generated by the deutsch wave .",
    "non - thermal x - ray emission results from the effects of curvature , synchrotron and inverse compton radiation on the accelerated particles .",
    "the other mechanism is thermal emission which may be produced at the stellar surface due to the initial cooling of the neutron star , or reheating of the polar caps by the bombardment of back - flowing particles and internal friction .",
    "the particular x - ray emission mechanism can sometimes be determined from the pulse shape .",
    "high amplitude , sharp , narrow pulses can only be produced by a highly beamed , and therefore relativistic population of electrons , while low amplitude , quasi - sinusoidal pulses can be produced by either method . since the latter characteristics are those seen in the pn light curve of psr  j0538 + 2817 , in principle we can not discriminate between the two mechanisms .",
    "however , the absence of a power law tail in the spectrum , argues toward a thermal origin",
    ".    the observed pulsation may also be due to absorption in the rotating magnetosphere , instead of being an intrinsic characteristic of the pulsar emission ( see cropper et al .",
    "2002 for a discussion of a similar effect in the case of rx  j07203125 ) . however , the thermal emission of psr  j0538 + 2817  is hotter than that of rx  j07203125 , and this implies a higher ionization parameter ( by a factor of @xmath77 ) .",
    "moreover psr  j0538 + 2817  has a faster rotation period ( by a factor of @xmath78 50 ) which limits the maximum extent of the light cylinder and therefore the volume of absorbing material .",
    "the high densities of largely neutral material required , together with the rather weak magnetic field in this system to confine it , argue against absorption as the origin of the pulsations .",
    "the simplest explanation for the flux variation is therefore that it is due to hot , rotating polar caps .",
    "the asymmetry in the pulse shape in fig .",
    "[ fig : lc ] ( top panel ) can not be produced by any symmetrical structure on the ns , nor by any beaming effects , as long as these operate symmetrically with respect to the magnetic or rotation axis .",
    "on the other hand , if the emission originates in a hot spot ( or cap ) , the observed asymmetry can be qualitatively understood by requiring that the trailing edge of the cap is hotter and brighter than the leading edge .",
    "the dc component of the pulse profile implies that there is never a time when the emission is `` off '' ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : lc ] ) .",
    "if the polar cap model is correct this suggests that part of the cap is always visible .",
    "we find that the spectra of psr  j0538 + 2817  can be well - fit with a blackbody .",
    "the value for the emitting radius indicates that the emission is from a region which is smaller than the surface of the ns , i.e. a hot spot .",
    "we investigated whether a pure - h atmospheric model would provide model temperatures to be in line with that expected from the cooling curve .",
    "we find that the model fits the spectra well , but the distance to the pulsar determined from the fit is too small , unless we use unrealistically large radii for the ns .",
    "we do not find any evidence for a non - thermal component in the spectra of psr  j0538 + 2817 .",
    "however , we note that the power law component was detected in b10522 - 52 only after deeper observations . this may also be true for psr  j0538 + 2817 .",
    "we have detected for the first time pulsed x - ray emission from psr  j0538 + 2817 , the period of which is consistent , within errors , with the predicted radio period .",
    "whether the mechanism for x - ray emission is via non - thermal magnetospheric synchrotron or thermal emission from the hot surface is not clear , as the broad asymmetric pulse shape found for psr  j0538 + 2817  does not favor either model .",
    "however , the absence of a power law component may indicate that the emission is thermal in origin .",
    "we find an asymmetric pulse profile which may be due to hot , rotating polar caps , with a temperature structure which is hotter at the trailing edge . if the polar cap model is correct , the small radius we determine for the emission region is expected .",
