    "entanglement is an essential resource for many applications in quantum information science such as quantum superdense coding@xcite quantum teleportation@xcite , quantum cryptography@xcite , and quantum computing@xcite . from an information - theoretic point of view",
    ", two parties sharing entanglement can be regarded to have already a certain amount of information distributed between them ; one e - bit per a shared maximally entangled pair of qubits .",
    "thus , for example , in superdense coding two bits of information can be sent from one party to another by manipulating only one of two maximally entangled qubits . in quantum teleportation a quantum state of a qubit",
    "can be completely transferred by sending only two bits of classical information , if the two parties , the sender and the receiver , share a maximally entangled pair .    in this work we explore yet another situation in which two(or more ) parties can make use of entanglement they share to their advantage .",
    "we consider a situation in which two parties , alice and bob , share a maximally entangled pair a and b of qubits .",
    "alice makes a bell - state measurement upon the qubit @xmath0 and another qubit @xmath1 she prepared in a state about which only she has the information .",
    "bob also makes a bell - state measurement upon the qubit @xmath2 and another qubit @xmath3 he prepared in a state about which only he has the information .",
    "we are interested in the probability for each of the sixteen possible joint measurement outcomes , which in general depends upon the states of the qubits @xmath1 and @xmath3 in a way characteristic of the shared entanglement .",
    "if alice keeps the information on the state of qubit @xmath1 to herself and bob keeps the information on the state of qubit @xmath3 to himself , they have a partial knowledge of the probabilities in advance that others do not .",
    "we suggest that this advantage can be exploited to devise a method by which alice and bob secretely and simultaneously exchange messages .",
    "generalizations of the method to higher - dimensional systems(``qudits '' ) and to multipartite entanglement are also discussed .",
    "let us suppose that two parties , alice and bob , share a maximally entangled pair @xmath0 and @xmath2 of qubits .",
    "the qubits a and b can be in any of the four bell states @xmath4 , \\end{array}\\ ] ] but for the sake of concreteness of argument , we take it as @xmath5 alice has in her possession another qubit @xmath1 which she prepared in state latexmath:[\\[|\\psi\\rangle_{\\alpha } = a_0 |0 \\rangle_{\\alpha}+ a_1    qubit @xmath3 which he prepared in state latexmath:[\\[|\\psi\\rangle_{\\beta } = b_0 |0 \\rangle_{\\beta}+ b_1    pair @xmath1 and @xmath0 , and bob performs a bell - state measurement on the pair @xmath3 and @xmath2 .",
    "the experimental scheme is depicted schematically in fig .  1 .    .",
    "alice performs a bell - state measurement on the qubit pair @xmath1 and a , and bob performs a bell - state measurement on the qubit pair @xmath3 and b. bsm stands for bell - state measurement.,width=529 ]    the probability @xmath8 that alice s bell - state measurement yields @xmath9 and bob s bell - state measurement yields @xmath10 can be obtained by expanding the total wave function @xmath11 a straightforward algebra yields @xmath12,\\ ] ] where all indices are evaluated modulo 2 . the probabilities @xmath13 s are given by @xmath14    we note that , since alice prepared the state of qubit @xmath1 and thus knows what @xmath15 and @xmath16 are , and similarly since bob prepared the state of qubit @xmath3 and thus knows what @xmath17 and @xmath18 are , alice and bob have a partial prior knowledge of the probabilities @xmath13 s .",
    "we suggest that they can take advantage of this knowledge to secretely exchange messages .",
    "the scheme we propose goes as follows .",
    "we suppose that alice and bob share a large number n(@xmath19 ) of maximally entangled pairs a s and b s .",
    "we further suppose that alice has an equally large number n of qubits @xmath1 s , each of which she prepared in state ( 3 ) , and that bob has n qubits @xmath3 s , each of which he prepared in state ( 4 ) .",
    "alice keeps the information on the state of qubits @xmath1 s to herself and bob keeps the information on the state of qubits @xmath3",
    "s to himself . alice and bob then perform a series of n bell - state measurements on each pair @xmath1 and @xmath0 , and @xmath3 and @xmath2 , respectively .",
    "they announce publicly their measurement results only when the outcome is either @xmath20 or @xmath21 ( this considerably eases the burden on the bell - state measurements , because only these two bell states can be unambiguously distinguished with linear optical means @xcite ) . by counting the number @xmath22 of occurrences for the joint outcome @xmath23 , the probabilities @xmath24 s @xmath25 can be determined experimentally as @xmath26 when the four experimentally determined probabilities @xmath27 s ( @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 ) are substituted for the probabilities @xmath24 s of eqs .",
    "( 7a ) and ( 7b ) , we obtain two equations that relate the four constants @xmath32 and @xmath18 .",
    "since alice knows the values of @xmath15 and @xmath16 , there are only two unknowns @xmath17 and @xmath18 [ the constants @xmath17 and @xmath18 are complex numbers , but they are subject to normalization and the overall phase can be ignored ] to her .",
    "likewise , there are only two unknowns @xmath15 and @xmath16 to bob . to any third party",
    ", however , the number of unknowns is four .",
    "we can thus conclude that only alice and bob can completely determine the four constants @xmath33 and @xmath18 .",
    "let us suppose that alice and bob have secret messages they wish to send to each other .",
    "if they prepare their messages in the form of two constants , the scheme described above can be used for them to achieve a secret two - way communication .",
    "we mention that a scheme which is different from our proposed scheme but allows two parties to simultaneously exchange their messages as our proposed scheme does has recently been proposed@xcite .",
    "let us now estimate the efficiency of the scheme described in the previous section .",
    "when a sufficiently large number @xmath34 of bell - state measurements are made by alice and bob each , the number @xmath35 of times the joint outcome @xmath36 is counted lies within the range defined as@xcite @xmath37 where @xmath13 s are the exact theoretical probabilities given by eqs.(7 ) .",
    "thus , the accuracy of the experimentally determined probabilities @xmath38 is limited by @xmath39 eq.(10 ) is valid as long as alice and bob perform each of their bell - state measurements individually , which we assume here .",
    "[ if a collective approach is adopted , for example , if alice performs all n bell - state measurements before bob makes any of his measurements and sends the message containing the outcome of all her measurements to bob , and if bob , upon receiving alice s message , performs his bell - state measurements in an appropriate collective way , it may be possible to obtain a higher accuracy for @xmath40 .",
    "further research is needed on the collective approach . ]",
    "eq.(10 ) indicates that , in order to obtain @xmath40 accurate to one decimal point , which would allow alice and bob to share four real values @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) accurate to one decimal point each , alice and bob should perform @xmath43(perhaps a few hundred ) bell - state measurements each .",
    "we therefore conclude that alice and bob gain 4 secret digits(or equivalently 13@xmath4414 secret bits ) at the expense of @xmath43(a few hundred ) entangled pairs , i.e. , the number of secret bits gained per use of an entangled pair is roughly 0.1 or less .",
    "the efficiency of the proposed scheme is thus somewhat lower than that of the entanglement - based cryptographic scheme(e91)@xcite .",
    "we note that the proposed protocol can be used for alice and bob to send secretly to each other directions in space and consequently to possess two private shared reference frames .",
    "they need of course to store the information on their euler angles in the constants @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , @xmath18 , respectively .",
    "shared reference frames are a resource for quantum communications @xcite .",
    "a standard protocol@xcite to send directions in space when alice and bob share entangled pairs , say in @xmath45 , requires alice to perform a projection measurement in her @xmath46 basis on the particle a of each entangled pair and announce publicly the outcome of each measurement .",
    "bob would then follow with his projection measurement in his @xmath46 basis on the corresponding particle b of each entangled pair . if a sufficiently large number @xmath47 of projection measurements are performed by alice and bob , the number @xmath48 of times that alice and bob obtain the same measurement outcome will be given by @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the angle between alice s and bob s axes .",
    "[ we assume that qubits are polarized photons . if we take spins for qubits , then @xmath51 .",
    "provided that alice and bob perform each of their projection measurements individually , essentially the same statistical analysis based on eq.(9 ) applies here , and thus the efficiency of our proposed protocol is of the same order of magnitude as that of this standard entanglement - based protocol . [ if , however , we allow bob to make collective measurements in the standard protocol , the efficiency can be higher .",
    "see , for example , ref.@xcite . ]",
    "our protocol , however , requires both alice and bob to perform bell - state measurements , which are in general more difficult to perform than von - neumann projection measurements .",
    "one advantage of our protocol is that it is symmetric with respect to alice and bob and allows both alice and bob to gain information , whereas in standard schemes the information usually flows one way .",
    "we now consider a generalization of the above scheme to higher - dimensional systems , i.e. , to `` qudits '' .",
    "the generalized bell states for a qudit can be defined as @xcite @xmath52 where @xmath53 .",
    "let us assume that alice and bob share a large number n(@xmath19 ) of entangled pairs @xmath0 s and @xmath2 s in the generalized bell state @xmath54 .",
    "alice performs a series of n bell - state measurements on pairs of qudit @xmath0 and another qudit @xmath1 she prepared in state @xmath55 , while bob performs a series of n bell - state measurements on pairs of qudit @xmath2 and yet another qudit @xmath3 he prepared in state @xmath56 . as in the qubit case",
    ", the total wave function @xmath57 can be expanded in terms of the products of the generalized bell states @xmath58 as @xmath59 where @xmath60 is given by @xmath61 where all indices are now evaluated modulo d. eq.(13 ) indicates that the probabilities @xmath62 take on the same value if @xmath63(mod d ) is the same and if @xmath64(mod d ) is the same .",
    "thus , there are @xmath65 different values of the probabilities @xmath66 s .",
    "eq.(13 ) then provides @xmath67 independent equations that relate the constants , @xmath68 ; @xmath69 . to any third party other than alice and bob",
    ", the number of unknowns contained in these constants is @xmath70 .",
    "there are , however , only @xmath71 unknowns , as far as alice or bob is concerned . by agreeing to publicly announce their measurement results only when the outcome is among judiciously chosen generalized bell states ,",
    "alice and bob can limit the number of probabilities that can be determined experimentally in such a way that the number of equations that relate the experimentally determined probabilities with the constants @xmath72 s and @xmath73 s is greater than or equal to @xmath71 but less that @xmath70 .",
    "this way , alice and bob can send secret messages in the form of @xmath71 constants to each other and as a result secretely share @xmath70 constants between them .    as an example consider the case @xmath74 .",
    "if alice and bob announce results of the bell - state measurements only when they measure either @xmath75 or @xmath76 , they can determine experimentally the four probabilities @xmath77 and @xmath78 , which are given by    @xmath79    where @xmath80 .",
    "( 14a)-(14d ) are sufficient for alice and bob to determine their four unknowns , allowing them to exchange messages in the form of four constants each .",
    "another possible generalization of the proposed scheme is to the case of multiparty communications .",
    "let us consider the case when n(@xmath81 ) parties share an n - qubit entangled state of greenberger - horne - zeilinger ( ghz ) type @xcite given by @xmath82 and the greek letter @xmath83 ) refers to the nth party or nth qubit .",
    "each party has , in addition to the qubit k of eq.(15 ) [ the letter k ( and also the small letter k and the greek letter @xmath84 ) denotes the kth party or kth qubit , where @xmath85 , another qubit @xmath84 which she or he prepared in state @xmath86 each party then performs a bell - state measurement upon the qubits @xmath84 and k. the total wave function for the 2n qubits @xmath87 can be expanded as @xmath88 a straightforward algebra yields @xmath89 \\end{array}\\ ] ]    in eq.(18 ) , the constants @xmath90 and @xmath91 define the state of the qubit @xmath83 in which the nth party prepared according to @xmath92    eq.(18 ) indicates that there are @xmath93 different values for the probabilities @xmath94 @xmath95 . to any member of the @xmath96 parties sharing the entanglement of eq.(15 ) , the number of unknowns is @xmath97 , while it is @xmath98 to any outsider . as before , by agreeing to publicly announce the measurement results only when the outcome is among judiciously chosen bell states , each of the n parties can secretely send his message in the form of two constants to all others of the n parties , so that the n parties can share secretely the messages in the form of @xmath99 constants .    as an example , consider the case @xmath100 .",
    "let us assume that the three parties , alice , bob and charlie agree that charlie is the last one to make an announcement each time , that alice and bob announce the measurement results only when they obtain either @xmath20 or @xmath21 , and that charlie announces his measurement result only when both alice and bob announce their measurement results and he(charlie ) obtains either @xmath20 or @xmath21 or @xmath75 .",
    "the probabilities that can be determined experimentally are then the following :    @xmath101    since each of alice , bob and charlie has four unknowns , she or he can use eqs .",
    "( 20a)-(20d ) to solve for her or his unknowns .",
    "this allows alice , bob and charlie to share secretely six constants among them .",
    "if alice , bob and charlie are limited to linear - optical bell - state measurements , they can only determine eight probabilities @xmath102 of eqs .",
    "( 20a ) and ( 20b ) experimentally .",
    "in this situation , alice , bob and charlie each needs to announce publicly one of the constants , say @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "each of alice , bob and charlie then has two unknowns for which eqs.(20a ) and ( 20b ) provide sufficient information . in this case , however , the number of constants that the three parties can secretely share is reduced to three .",
    "so far , we have assumed that alice and bob have exactly the same basis for the states @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "thus , if the qubits we consider are polarized photons or spins , we assume that alice and bob share a spatial reference frame .",
    "as far as our proposed protocol is concerned , this shared reference frame does not need to be private , because the privacy of the protocol does not depend upon the privacy of the reference frame .",
    "the shared reference frame can , for example , be a specific direction with respect to a fixed star .     and @xmath105 ) and bob s reference frame ( @xmath107 and @xmath108).,width=188 ]    it may happen , however , that alice and bob , for reasons of better security , want to use reference frames of their own choice which may not coincide , or that their reference frames are inadvertently misaligned . as show below ,",
    "our proposed protocol still works , even if alice s reference frame does not coincide with bob s .",
    "let us suppose that bob s axis makes an angle @xmath50 with respect to alice s , as shown in fig .",
    "the initial state for the four particles @xmath109 and @xmath2 are now written as @xmath110 where@xmath105 and @xmath106 denote alice s basis states and @xmath108 and @xmath107 bob s basis states .",
    "we assume that alice prepares the entangled pair @xmath0 and @xmath2 in @xmath111 , keeps @xmath0 and sends @xmath2 to bob .",
    "now alice performs her bell state measurement on the pair @xmath112 in her @xmath46 basis , whereas bob performs his bell state measurement on the pair @xmath113 in his @xmath114 basis .",
    "we thus need to express @xmath115 and @xmath116 in terms of @xmath117 and @xmath118 , and expand the wave function @xmath119 as @xmath120 where @xmath121 refers to bell states of eq .",
    "( 1 ) defined in terms of bob s basis @xmath108 and @xmath107 . a straightforward algebra yields , for the probabilities @xmath122 ,    @xmath123    @xmath124    @xmath125    @xmath126    @xmath127    @xmath128    @xmath129    @xmath130    where the probabilities are further restricted by the identities    @xmath131    @xmath132    @xmath133    comparison of eqs.(23 ) with eqs.(7 ) indicates that the misalignment of bob s axis with respect to alice s axis partly breaks degeneracies among the probabilities . for example , @xmath134 is no longer equal to @xmath135 , and @xmath136 is no longer equal to @xmath137 .",
    "the difference between these probabilities can thus be considered as a measure of the misalignment .    our scheme for quantum message exchange can proceed exactly as before .",
    "we let alice and bob announce publicly their measurement results only when the outcome is either @xmath20 or @xmath21 .",
    "the four experimentally determined probabilities @xmath138 , and @xmath31 then provide four equations , eqs .",
    "( 23a ) , ( 23b ) , ( 23e ) and ( 23f ) , that relate the five constants ; @xmath139 and the angle @xmath50 . to alice(bob ) there are three unknowns @xmath140 and @xmath50 , whereas to any third party the number of unknowns is five . only alice and bob can thus determine the five constants @xmath141 and @xmath50 .",
    "our scheme thus allows alice and bob not only to secretely share the four constants but also to determine the angle between their reference frames .",
    "we have analyzed a situation in which each of two ( or more ) parties sharing entanglement performs a bell - state measurement upon the entangled particle in his ( or her ) possession and another particle he(or she ) prepared in a specific state .",
    "the probability for a joint measurement outcome corresponding to a given combination of the bell states depends critically upon the states of the particles involved . taking advantage of the fact that each person belonging to the parties sharing entanglement and only he(or she ) knows the state of the particle he(or she ) prepared , we suggest a scheme by which two(or more ) parties sharing entanglement can secretely and simultaneously exchange messages . for the case of two parties sharing entangled qubits",
    ", the scheme requires bell - state measurements that distinguish only two out of the four bell states , which can be accomplished using only linear optical devices .",
    "the scheme thus provides an experimentally feasible means of two - way communication .",
    "we should emphasize that , although it may not be apparent at first sight , entanglement plays a critical role in the proposed scheme .",
    "it is through entanglement that the joint probabilities appear in an `` entangled '' form as give in eqs.(7 ) and that the separate probabilities for either alice or bob to obtain any arbitrary bell state are evenly distributed regardless of which bell state we consider .",
    "information on the constants @xmath142 and @xmath18 can be obtained only by looking at the joint probabilities . on the other hand ,",
    "if the qubits a and b were not entangled , alice s bell - state measurements would be completely independent of bob s bell - state measurements , and information on the constants @xmath15 and @xmath16 ( @xmath17 and @xmath18 ) would be obtained by looking only at the results of alice s ( bob s ) bell - state measurements .",
    "bob(alice ) would need as much information as any third party in order to determine @xmath15 and @xmath16(@xmath17 and @xmath18 ) from the results of alice s ( bob s ) bell - state measurements .",
    "the parties sharing entanglement have advantages only because the joint probabilities for alice s and bob s bell - state measurements are `` entangled '' .",
    "of course , the maximal advantage is provided by the maximal entanglement which we have assumed . in general , as the degree of shared entanglement is decreased , the joint probabilities exhibit less degree of entanglement , and as a result the parties sharing entanglement has less degree of advantage over a third party .",
