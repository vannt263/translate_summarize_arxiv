    "in this paper we studied the dynamics of thin vibrated granular layers in the framework of phenomenological model based on the ginzburg - landau type equation for the order parameter characterizing the amplitude of sub - harmonic sand vibrations . although rigorous derivation of this model is not possible up to date , our approach gives a significant insight in the problem in hand and results in testable predictions .",
    "our model is complementary to more elaborate fluid dynamics - like continuum descriptions or direct molecular dynamics simulations and allows us to carry out analytical calculations of various regimes and predict their stability .",
    "a challenging problem is to establish a quantitative relation between our order parameter model and other models and experiments .",
    "we have shown in this paper that the generic parametric ginzburg - landau model eq.([eq1 ] ) captures not only patterns of vibrated sand near the primary bifurcation , but also large acceleration patterns such as hexagons , interfaces , and super - oscillons .",
    "the structure of the phase diagram fig.[phase ] for high frequencies and amplitudes of vibrations is qualitatively similar to that of previous experiments refs.@xcite , as well as the experiments reported here .",
    "increasing vibration amplitude leads to transition from a trivial state to stripes , hexagons , decorated interfaces , and finally , to stable interfaces .",
    "interface decorations were found to be a result of the transversal instability of a flat interface which is analogous to the negative surface tension .",
    "we found that eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) is not sufficient to describe the saturation of interface instability .",
    "we propose a possible non - local mechanism of saturation of this instability which takes into account the dependence of the overall length of the interface and magnitude of parametric forcing , which may occur due to a large scale convective flow induced by the sand motion near the interface .",
    "we described analytically the motion of the interface under the symmetry - breaking influence of the small subharmonic driving .    in our experimental study we found that on a qualitative level the theoretical phase diagram is similar to the experimental one",
    "the experiments also confirmed existence of super - oscillons and their bound states with the interface as it was predicted by the theory .",
    "further experimental study is necessary to elucidate the specific mechanism for saturation of the interface instability .",
    "stimulated by the theoretical prediction , we also performed experimental studies of interface motion under additional subharmonic driving .",
    "the experiment confirmed that the direction and magnitude of the interface displacement depend sensitively on the amplitude and the relative phase of the subharmonic driving .",
    "moreover , we found that period - doubling motion of the flat layers produces subharmonic driving because of the finite ratio of the mass of the granular layer and the cell .",
    "this in turn leads to the restoring force driving the interface towards the middle of the cell .",
