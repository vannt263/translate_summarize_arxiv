    "almost 20 years ago , t hooft and mandelstam proposed the dual superconductor scenario of confinement : it is believed that at low temperature magnetic monopoles condense and thus , chromo electric flux is expelled from the qcd vacuum , analogous to a type ii superconductor .",
    "this leads to the formation of thin electric flux tubes between colour charges and thus to a linearly rising potential , explaining confinement . in view of both , making genuinely non perturbative aspects of qcd accessible to analytical treatment and understanding",
    "how confinement arises , it is worthwhile to investigate to what extent qcd reproduces expectations from the ginzburg - landau ( gl ) equations , and to fix their relevant parameters .",
    "pioneering steps in this direction have been made in refs .",
    "@xcite .    in nonabelian theories ,",
    "the definition of fields and currents becomes ambiguous .",
    "t hooft suggested the maximal abelian gauge as a renormalizable gauge condition for projecting out a cartan subgroup , believed to be relevant for infra red aspects of qcd ( abelian dominance ) . in this investigation , we follow these lines .",
    "previously , the abelian string tension has been found to reproduce the nonabelian one within 8%  @xcite .",
    "a further decomposition of the abelian wilson loop into photon and monopole parts  @xcite shows that the monopole part accounts exclusively for the string tension  @xcite .",
    "here we extend these studies to the level of field distributions .",
    "we investigate a @xmath0 lattice at @xmath1 , corresponding to a lattice spacing @xmath2  fm , where the scale has been set from the string tension value @xmath3  mev .",
    "a careful study of systematic errors introduced by incomplete gauge fixing and optimisation of the gauge fixing procedure are crucial for obtaining reliable results .",
    "we take measurements on 108 independent abelian configurations , generated in the context of ref .",
    "@xcite . in the limit of large @xmath4 ,",
    "we measure connected correlation functions  @xcite , @xmath5 by varying @xmath6 , we scan through the space around two static sources , separated by a distance @xmath7 . depending on the type of the local probe @xmath8 ,",
    "distributions of @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are obtained .",
    "@xmath15 denotes a smeared wilson loop , which is either built up from abelian link angles or from the regular ( photon ) or the singular ( monopole ) contributions to these angles alone , according to the approximate factorisation of ref .",
    "it has been demonstrated previously that the abelian potential approximately factorises into a monopole and a photon contribution  @xcite . here , we investigate this factorisation on the level of the underlying field distributions . in fig .",
    "[ densities ] the situation is depicted for the action density , @xmath16 . in accord with nave expectations ,",
    "the string is entirely due to the monopole part , whereas the effect of the photon part is localised in the vicinity of the sources .",
    "we choose the coordinates such that the colour sources lie on the @xmath17-axis at positions @xmath18 with @xmath19 .",
    "@xmath20 denotes the transverse distance from the interquark string . a combination of ampere s law @xmath21 with the london equation @xmath22 yields @xmath23 .",
    "we expect the analytical solution , @xmath24 to hold in the london limit which should be realized at sufficiently large @xmath25 and @xmath26 . for @xmath27 , we find all our data on @xmath28 and @xmath13 to be in perfect agreement with ampere s law and proceed to fit @xmath29 in the central plane ( @xmath30 ) to eq .",
