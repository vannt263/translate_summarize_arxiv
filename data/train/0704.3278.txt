    "[ hrcsec ] below in an elementary fashion using ( a mild generalization of ) the diamond lemma .",
    "the case when @xmath85 is of type @xmath90 or @xmath91 , given in theorems [ ant ] and [ dnt ] .",
    "to prove these theorems , we use explicit integral bases for @xmath92 and their zeroth hochschild homology modulo torsion .",
    "we explicitly present these bases and verify that they are bases using the diamond lemma for modules over a commutative ring ( which is discussed in appendix [ dla ] ) .",
    "the remaining cases where @xmath85 is of type @xmath93 ( for @xmath94 ) and @xmath95 : these are proved in  [ wdescptpfs ] . here",

    ", we use the term `` grbner generating set '' since we work over arbitrary commutative rings ( such as @xmath0 ) and it is slightly inconvenient for us to define the minimal such sets that , when working over fields , are customarily called grbner bases ( and we do not need minimality here ) .    in the process , we obtain integral , rational , and characteristic @xmath1 bases for @xmath77 and @xmath69 modulo torsion .",
    "this relies on the @xmath0-module decomposition @xmath97 . for @xmath69 ,",
    "we can then ( essentially ) write classes as cyclic words in @xmath98 and @xmath99 . for details , see  [ ean ] for the case @xmath100 ,  [ edn ] for the case @xmath101 , propositions [ mip2 ] and [ wdescp ] for the case where @xmath1 is good for @xmath85 as above ( i.e. , not a factor of the size of the group given by the mckay correspondence ) ; and for the general case see theorem [ wdescpt ] and the preceding ( note that only @xmath102 and @xmath95 are not covered by the preceding cases ) . as observed above , these cases are overlapping , but note that the bases we obtain do _ not _ coincide in overlapping cases .",
    "the bases should be interesting in their own right .",
    "as one simple application of the bases for @xmath77 , we may deduce that @xmath77 is torsion - free ( which was proved in @xcite for non - dynkin quivers using gelfand - kirillov dimension ) .",
    "( this follows from much less work than is required for the proof of theorem [ mt ] itself , where the essential difficulty is in finding the @xmath0-module structure of @xmath69 , rather than merely @xmath77 . )    in the dynkin and extended dynkin cases , we also compute explicit bases for @xmath77 and @xmath69 modulo torsion , and give an explicit description of the torsion of @xmath69 . here",
    ", it turns out that the torsion is finite , and the nonzero classes @xmath103 only occur in `` stably bad primes '' : none for @xmath104 ; @xmath105 for @xmath106 , @xmath107 for @xmath108 , and @xmath109 for @xmath110 .",
    "the precise result is theorem [ dedz ] ( which refines a result of @xcite , which established the cases in which @xmath111 vanishes ) .",
    "note that there is good reason why this torsion must be as described : indeed , our proof of theorem [ mt ] via the method of the proof of theorem [ wdescpt ] in  [ s : mt - fp ] could also be used backwards to deduce , assuming the statement of theorem [ mt ] ( which does not single out any primes ) , the precise torsion structure of @xmath69 without computing it directly .",

    "first , in  [ wittsec ] , we explain the motivation and interpretation using noncommutative witt theory .",
    "then , in  [ hrcsec ] , we prove hesselholt and rains s conjecture .",
    "in  [ gpsec ] we prove its generalization , theorem [ mt ] , in the case of good primes ( not dividing @xmath113 where @xmath115 is associated to an extended dynkin subquiver ) .",
    "next ,  [ nccisec ] recalls the notion of ncci algebras and proves a general result we will need about them .    in  [ hsrcisec ]",

    "we also pose a more general question on asymptotic rci algebras in positive characteristic ( question [ rciques ] ) .    in the next crucial section ,  [ refppsec ] ,",
    "we prove one direction of theorem [ mt ] : that the classes @xmath27 are nonzero ( proposition [ rpnz ] )",
    ". we then proceed to state a refinement of the main theorem ( theorem [ wdescpt ] ) , using prime powers , which implies theorem [ mt ] .",
    "the goal of the remainder of the paper will be to prove this refinement .    in ",

    "it is natural to ask if these structures are compatible in any way .",
    "in particular , one might ask if they form a restricted lie algebra .",

    "hesselholt showed that @xmath156 then is an abelian group under @xmath171 and @xmath172 and the operations are independent of the choice of noncommutative polynomials @xmath176 .",
    "in addition to defining @xmath154 for associative algebras @xmath5 , hesselholt generalized the frobenius ( @xmath177 ) and verschiebung ( @xmath178 ) operators on @xmath154 to the noncommutative setting .",

    "now , the universal elements of @xmath198 should instead be written as @xmath200 , replacing the parameter @xmath56 by the quiver @xmath44 .",

    "now , to show that @xmath78 , as well as @xmath1374 , is integrally spanned by the elements stated in the theorem , we make two observations .",

    "next , take an expression of the form @xmath1379 where @xmath1398 and @xmath1320 begins with @xmath1329 or @xmath1330 . if @xmath1320 includes @xmath1326 anywhere except at the very end , then it precedes @xmath160 , and we may freely replace @xmath1402 with @xmath1403 .",
    "since @xmath1320 does not begin with @xmath1326 , the occurrence @xmath1404 in @xmath1320 is preceded by @xmath638 .",
    "thus , we replace the resulting @xmath1405 in @xmath1320 by @xmath1406 .",
    "the resulting @xmath1407 term involves changing direction at an internal vertex , which we showed above must be in @xmath1408 .",
    "in other words , in @xmath1374 , one can replace the @xmath1326 in @xmath1320 by @xmath1409 , and obtain the same element .",
    "hence , the elements stated in the theorem integrally span @xmath1374 , as well as @xmath78 .    it remains to show linear independence of the given elements over @xmath0 ( i.e. , that they form a basis for the free @xmath0-module @xmath78 ) .",
    "we do this by mirroring the above , but using the diamond lemma and a bit more careful analysis . for any generalized path @xmath1410",
    ", we can construct an alternating sequence @xmath1411 which we call `` the ends of @xmath203 '' , as follows : start with the empty sequence , unless the initial vertex of @xmath203 is an external one , in which case we start with the side @xmath638 for left or @xmath160 for right .",
    "every time we hit the left end ( a left external vertex or the superposition of both ) we add an @xmath638 to the sequence @xmath1412 , unless @xmath1412 is already nonempty with last term equal to @xmath638 . every time we hit the right end , we add an @xmath160 , unless the sequence is nonempty with last term @xmath160 .",

    "finally , let us consider the places @xmath1419 where @xmath203 is `` not going in the correct direction . '' by `` not the correct direction at @xmath155 ''",
    ", we mean that the path is headed away from the next endpoint @xmath1420 ( = towards the previous endpoint @xmath1421 ) appearing in the path . precisely , suppose that @xmath1422 and @xmath203 hits the endpoint @xmath1423 , at the time corresponding to when we add @xmath1424 to the sequence , between @xmath1425 and @xmath1426 ( i.e. , if the last endpoint @xmath1424 is hit at the very end , set @xmath1427 ) .",
    "then , for all @xmath1428 , we say that @xmath155 is a place where @xmath203 heads in the `` wrong direction '' if @xmath1429 .",
    "now , for any @xmath1413 of the form @xmath1430 for some @xmath1196 , let @xmath1431 be the subset of places where @xmath203 goes in the wrong direction .",
    "one easily sees that the size of @xmath1432 is the difference between @xmath206 and the shortest path with the same endpoints as @xmath203 ( this makes sense since we assumed @xmath203 had definite endpoints ) .",
    "now , we may define @xmath1433 if either @xmath1434 , or else @xmath1435 and there is an order - preserving bijection @xmath1436 such that @xmath1437 for all @xmath1438 .",
    "that is , the places where @xmath203 goes in the `` wrong direction '' occur strictly before the corresponding places in @xmath1320 .",
    "now , we finally have the ordering we need such that the relations on @xmath1439 modulo which one gets @xmath1440 are confluent and give the desired elements as the normal form ( one reduces as in the first part of this proof ) .",
    "so , the desired elements are linearly independent and form a basis of @xmath78 . also ,",
