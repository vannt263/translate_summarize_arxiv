    "the cern axion solar telescope ( cast )  @xcite is operating since 2003 in search for the emission of axions from the sun through their conversion into soft x - ray photons in the strong magnetic field of an lhc dipole prototype magnet .",
    "the experiment has been setting the strongest bounds on solar axion production to date  @xcite .",
    "more recently , cast is extending its scope , making use of the versatility of the experimental setup .",
    "these extensions include the search for solar chameleons both through their coupling to photons  @xcite and through their coupling to matter  @xcite as well as the search for relic axions exploiting resonant microwave cavities immersed into the magnetic field  @xcite . in these proceedings",
    "we report about the progress in the search for solar chameleons using an ingrid detector , extending the preliminary results reported at the 2014 axion - wimp workshop  @xcite .",
    "the observation of a non - vanishing cosmological constant , dubbed dark energy ( de ) , is arguably one of the greatest mysteries of modern physics .",
    "there exist only very few particle physics approaches to explain de .",
    "the observed accelerated expansion of the universe may be explained by the existence of a scalar field .",
    "one such scenario is the so - called chameleon for which a low - energy effective theory has been formulated  @xcite .",
    "the chameleon field acquires an effective mass through a screening potential which establishes a non - zero vacuum expectation value depending on the surrounding matter density .",
    "the screening potential assures the suppression of measurable fifth force effects and leads to a chameleon mass which depends on the ambient matter density .",
    "chameleons , similar to axions , can be created via the primakoff effect in strong electro - magnetic fields present in the sun and observed on earth through their back - conversion into detectable x - ray photons within a strong magnetic field via the inverse primakoff effect .",
    "the energy of the photons is essentially equivalent to the chameleons thermal energy during their production in the sun .",
    "while axions may be created in the core of the sun with a spectral maximum at approximately 3kev , chameleons are predicted to be created in the solar tachocline  @xcite around 0.7r@xmath3 where intense magnetic fields are present .",
    "thus , they are produced at lower temperature corresponding to a spectral maximum of only 600ev , requiring photon detectors with sub - kev sensitivty .",
    "an initial search for solar chameleons with cast has been conducted using a silicon drift detector  @xcite .",
    "an ingrid ( `` integrated grid '' ) is a gas - ampficication device based on the micromegas principle .",
    "a thin aluminum mesh is mounted approximately 50 @xmath4 m above a cmos pixel chip , in our case the timepix asic  @xcite , via photolithographic wafer post - processing techniques  @xcite .",
    "the input pads of the pixels charge - sensitive amplifiers serve as charge - collecting anodes and the collected charged is amplified and processed digitally in - situ .",
    "the pixel pitch is 55@xmath555@xmath6m@xmath7 . with this fine pitch",
    ", a typical gas amplification of @xmath83000 and a detection threshold of @xmath9electrons , a single electron efficiency of @xmath1095% is achieved .",
    "given the diffusion of the ionization electrons from the photo electron , this allows for the counting of the total number of created electrons on the pixel chip and yields a direct measure of the energy , free of fluctuations in the amplification region . as the range of the photo electron in the detector gas ( 97.7% argon , 2.3% isobutane ) is only few hundred microns , the image of an absorbed photon",
    "is an essentially circular cloud of hit pixels , where the cloud radius decreases with the absorption depth of the photon .",
    "this pattern provides an effective template which differs significantly from charged particle background ( e.g.  cosmic muons or electrons from @xmath11-decay ) which produces typically a track - like pattern on the pixel chip .",
    "these differences are exploited to provide a powerful topological background suppression .",
    "the detector and its installation in cast is explained in more detail in  @xcite where also sensitivity of the detector down to below 300ev has been demonstrated .",
    "in autumn 2014 , the detector has , for the first time , been taking data on 27  consective days including 1.5h of daily solar tracking .",
    "while the solar tracking data are still blinded , the in - situ background data are being analysed using a simple three - variable likelihood for the photon hypothesis . in comparison to  @xcite",
    ", the likelihood has been further tuned to reduce energy - dependent biases .",
    "a preliminary background spectrum is shown in fig.[fig : background ] . in the region above 2kev two peaks around 3kev and 8kev are visible .",
    "the former corresponds to the known flourescence line of argon while the latter is likely a superposition of copper flourescence and cosmic tracks which traverse the detector parallel to the drift field .",
    "such cosmics produce a m.i.p .",
    "signal which , due to the track s direction , is difficult to distinguish from a photon via topological supression alone .",
    "outside these peaks , the background level is around @xmath12 .",
    "there is a notable increase in background for energies below 2kev , reaching @xmath1 around 1kev .",
    "the origin of this background needs further study .",
    "while the solar tracking data of the 2014 run have not yet been analyzed , one can already estimate an expected limit in case of non - observation of an excess .",
    "our estimates are based on scaling the limit of the sdd detector  @xcite and accounting for scaling factors in exposure time , effective sensitive area , background , and efficiency . in fig.[fig : limit ] the estimated expected limit of the chameleon - photon coupling @xmath13 from the ingrid detector is shown together with the observed sdd limit and other experimental and astrophysical constraints .",
    "it can be seen that the 2014 ingrid data have the potential to set a limit @xmath2 , improving the sdd limit by almost a factor two under the same model assumptions as given in  @xcite .",
    "also shown are prospects for data taking in 2015 and 2016 . at the time of writing",
    ", the detector has been continously taking data in the 2015 cast run using the same setup as in 2014 .",
    "further improvements in background suppression ( external cosmic veto , additional readout of the grid signal ) and photon detector efficiency ( through thinner x ray windows ) as well as improvements in the software rejection of background are currently being developed and will be implemented step - wise .",
    "rough estimates for the potential of these improvements yield expected exclusions are also shown in fig.[fig : limit ] .     vs.  chameleon - photon coupling @xmath13 .",

    "we thank the organizers of the axion - wimp - workshop 2015 for an exciting conference and their warm hospitality .",
