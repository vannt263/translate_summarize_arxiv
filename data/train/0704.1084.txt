    "the emergence of the dark energy as one of the basic ingredients of the current standard cosmological scenario , and the absence of an even vague understanding of its possible origin , opens a window to the analysis of all possible mechanisms that generate background energy ( see e.g. @xcite for a review of recent proposals ) .",
    "the main problem is that the apparent value of the dark energy is very tiny compared with any physical energy scale .",
    "a second problem is that in a generic quantum field theory there is generation of vacuum energy and any renormalization prescription requires a fine tuning , which is not very convincing without the quantisation of the gravitational interaction .",
    "the guess that dark energy might change with the evolution of the universe can be understood even if dark energy is just vacuum energy .",
    "the finite corrections due to finite size of the causal hubble domain decrease as the universe continues to expand .",
    "the aim of this paper is to analyse the variation of these finite size corrections under of renormalization group on the space of boundary conditions for scalar field theories in flat space , although the results are generalisable for more general backgrounds .",
    "the dependence of the vacuum energy on the boundary conditions @xcite is well known since the discovery of casimir effect @xcite ( see @xcite and @xcite and references therein for recent revisions ) .",
    "however , boundaries might also be considered as a source of new , although peculiar , interactions and therefore can undergo renormalization @xcite .",
    "the renormalization of boundary conditions modifies the critical behaviour of the theory @xcite . in systems with boundaries or defects",
    ", the boundary rg flow induces a dynamical behaviour on the boundaries .",
    "the dynamics of d - branes in string theory emerges in this way @xcite .",
    "the renormalization group flow is analysed from a global viewpoint in the most general framework for boundary conditions of scalar field theories introduced in ref . @xcite . in particular",
    ", we consider the possible existence of topological transitions @xcite induced by the renormalization of boundary conditions or cyclic orbits in the boundary rg flow @xcite .",
    "the dependence of the finite size corrections to the vacuum energy and vacuum entanglement entropy @xcite under the boundary rg flow is analysed from a very general perspective .",
    "the action which governs the dynamics of scalar field theory in a bounded domain @xmath0 of flat space consists of two different of terms , @xmath1 .",
    "the first one s_b()=12 dt _ is defined in terms of the values of the fields in the bulk . the second term s_b()=12 dt _ d^d-1 x [ one ] depends only on the values of the fields at the boundary @xmath2 @xmath3 .",
    "@xmath4 denotes the metric induced on the boundary by the bulk flat metric , and @xmath5 is the normal derivative at the boundary = | _ _ _ n=_n|__. the presence of the boundary term @xmath6 allows the generation of local classical equations of motion without requiring any specific type of boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "indeed , the gradient term = _ ||^2 can be rewritten as = _ ^+ _ ^ _ n [ efive ] where @xmath7 is the laplace - beltrami operator @xmath8 . in the quantum theory",
    "the laplace - beltrami operator must have a real spectrum in order to have a selfadjoint hamiltonian = 12 .",
    "[ hamilton ] for the free field theory ( the inclusion of interactions does not changes the picture @xcite ) .",
    "this means that the classical fields must satisfy boundary conditions which make the operator @xmath9 selfadjoint .",
    "the complete set of boundary conditions which satisfy this requirement @xcite are in one - to - one correspondence with the group of unitary operators of the boundary hilbert space @xmath10 . for any unitary operator @xmath11 ,",
    "the fields satisfying the boundary condition [ const ] define a domain where @xmath12 is a selfadjoint operator .    in the case of open strings ,",
    "the corresponding conformal 1 + 1 dimensional scalar field theories is defined on the space interval @xmath13\\subset \\ir$ ] and there is a large variety of admissible boundary conditions described by the unitary group @xmath14 .",
    "the unitary matrices u_d=    -1&0&-1    u_n=    1&0&1    u_p=    0&1&0    define dirichlet , neumann and periodic boundary conditions , which in string theory correspond to a string attached to a d - brane background , free open and closed string theories , respectively .    for higher n - dimensional target spaces , or n - component strings ,",
    "the set of boundary conditions becomes @xmath15 which includes matrices which interpolate between one single closed string or n disconnected strings @xcite .",
    "the topology change is described in this picture by a simple change of boundary conditions in @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "if the spectrum of eigenvalues of the unitary operator @xmath17 does not include the value @xmath18 ( i.e. @xmath19 ) the boundary condition ( [ const ] ) can be rewritten as _",
    "n = -i uu   which means that only the boundary values of the fields at the boundary can have an arbitrary value @xmath20 whereas its normal derivative is determined by @xmath17 and @xmath20 .",
    "the corresponding operator mappings from unitary into selfadjoint operators a_=-i uu are the celebrated cayley transforms .",
    "the inverse cayley transform u= i a_ia _ recovers the unitary operator @xmath17 from their selfadjoint cayley transforms @xmath21 .",
    "the condition of @xmath9 being selfadjoint is necessary but not sufficient to guarantee the unitarity of the corresponding quantum field theory . indeed , in the case of free field theory the hamiltonian ( [ hamilton ] )",
    "must be selfadjoint .",
    "this requires that the spectrum of @xmath22 must be not only real but also positive which restricts the set of admissible boundary conditions to a subset @xmath23 of @xmath10 .    because of the existence of the boundary term in ( [ efive ] ) the hamiltonian @xmath24 ( [ hamilton ] ) is not selfadjoint if the spectrum of the unitary operator @xmath17 intersects the following domain of phase factors @xmath25 in any other case , @xmath26 is a lower bound for the spectrum of the operator @xmath9 and @xmath24 is selfadjoint .",
    "one possible source of unitarity loss is the existence of edge estates with large negative eigenvalues of operator @xmath9 .",
    "the consistency of the quantum field theory imposes , thus , a very stringent condition on the type of acceptable boundary conditions , even in the case of massive theories in order to prevent this type of pathological behaviour of vacuum energy .    for real scalar fields",
    "there is a further condition .",
    "@xmath17 has to satisfy a cp symmetry preserving condition u^=u^,u = u^t .",
    "the usual neumann and dirichlet boundary conditions @xmath27 satisfy this condition .",
    "in general , for   u=     a_1&b&a_2    the condition requires that a_1=a^t_1 , a_2=a^t_2 , a_1 b^+b a_2^=0 b b^+a_1a_1^= , a_2a_2^+b^tb^=    in particular , the quasi - periodic condition @xmath28 is also compatible if @xmath29 .    in the case of one single real massless",
    "scalar the set of compatible boundary conditions has two connected components : @xmath30 given by the operators of the form u_=   + i   _ y , and @xmath31 given by u_=   _ z +   _ x .",
    "@xmath30 includes neumann ( @xmath32 ) and dirichlet ( @xmath33 ) conditions ; and @xmath31 contains the quasi - periodic boundary conditions ( l)=(0);_n(l)=()^-1_n(0 ) [ quasi ] which include periodic ( @xmath34 ) and antiperiodic ( @xmath35 ) boundary conditions .",
    "since boundary conditions appear more naturally in the schrdinger picture of field theory and the theory is plagued of ultraviolet singularities some doubts were raised about their relevance for the quantum field theory .",
    "the pioneer work of symanzik @xcite confirmed the consistence of the standard picture even in presence of bulk renormalizable interactions ( see @xcite for an explanation of a recent controversy @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , there is a renormalization of the very boundary conditions because the boundary terms are the source of new interactions .",
    "the renormalization group can be defined in the continuum approach by _ ( ) = ^ [ ] [ ( x)-_(x ) ] by means of a fluctuating field @xmath36 with short range fluctuations of order @xmath37 .",
    "this implies that the boundary condition _",
    "n= is renormalised to _",
    "= _ , since _",
    "n_()=^[]+1[_n(x_b)-_n_(x_b ) ] = ^[]+1(x_b)= _ _ ( ) with @xmath38 . for more general boundary conditions",
    "the continuum renormalization group is given by u_^ _",
    "u_= 12 ( u^_-u _ ) or [ rgf ] for @xmath39 fixed points correspond , therefore , to self - adjoint boundary conditions @xmath40 . in particular , dirichlet and neumann ( @xmath41 ) are renormalization group fixed points .    for mixed boundary conditions the rg flows from dirichlet ( uv ) toward neumann ( ir ) conditions .",
    "u=. [ flip ]    critical exponents can be identified with the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath42 at the fixed points .",
    "since @xmath42 is also hermitian all critical exponents are either @xmath43 or @xmath44 and there is no room for cyclic orbits .",
    "it is well known , however , that some quantum systems with singular boundaries and singular interactions @xcite exhibit cyclic renormalization group flows . moreover ,",
    "some topological field theories ( e.g. russian doll models ) present a similar behaviour @xcite . in scalar field theories ,",
    "this phenomenon simply does not occur for regular boundaries .",
    "for the same reasons topological transitions do not occur for finite scale transformations since the flip of eigenvalues from @xmath45 to @xmath46 requires a change in the parameter @xmath47 of the flow from @xmath48 to @xmath49 as in ( [ flip ] ) ) .",
    "in 1 + 1 dimensions the theory of massless scalar fields is formally conformal invariant .",
    "however , boundary conditions might break this symmetry @xcite .",
    "conformal invariance is only preserved if the boundary conditions are stable under the boundary renormalization group flow .",
    "the fixed points can easily be identified . for a complex scalar field , besides the above mentioned fixed points , which correspond to dirichlet , neumann and pseudo - periodic boundary conditions and obviously are conformal invariant , there are fixed points corresponding to quasi - periodic boundary conditions ( [ quasi ] ) .",
    "they also preserve the conformal symmetry .",
    "in 1 + 1 dimensions this exhausts the whole set of conformal invariant boundary conditions .",
    "any other boundary condition flows toward one of these fixed points .",
    "the most stable fixed point corresponds to neumann conditions because all its critical exponents are @xmath46 .",
    "the most unstable is that of dirichlet conditions since all critical exponents @xmath44 .",
    "this is compatible with the fact that the neighbourhood of dirichlet boundary conditions is plagued of singularities    periodic , quasi - periodic and pseudo - periodic fixed points present relevant and irrelevant perturbations with critical exponents @xmath18 , respectively .",
    "negative values label the possible instabilities .",
    "implications of these results for string theory are well known .",
    "periodic boundary conditions , appear as attractors of systems with quasi - periodic and pseudo - periodic conditions which stresses the stability of closed string theory vacuum . for open strings the ( stable ) attractor points are standard free strings ( neumann ) . any other boundary condition flow toward one of those fixed points .",
    "notice that the absence of topological transitions in the boundary renormalization group flow is a consequence of the fact that all relevant perturbations are always associated with -1 critical exponents .    in higher dimensions ( @xmath50 ) conformal",
    "invariance requires , even in the massless case @xmath51 , that neumann boundary conditions have to be modified in order to preserve conformal invariance with a term _",
    "n = k , proportional to the extrinsic curvature @xmath52 of the boundary .    in the case of singular boundaries",
    "some more interesting boundary renormalization group flows arise ( see e.g. @xcite for a review ) : fixed points and cyclic orbits of the boundary renormalization group flow can appear @xcite and conformal invariance can be partially broken to a discrete subgroup @xcite .",
    "the infrared properties of quantum field theory are very sensitive to boundary conditions @xcite . in particular , physical properties of the quantum vacuum state like",
    "the vacuum energy may exhibit a very strong dependence on the type of boundary conditions .",
    "this can be explicitly shown in the simple case of a massless field defined on a finite one - dimensional interval @xmath53 $ ] .    for pseudoperiodic boundary conditions defined by the unitary operator u_=   _ x -   _ y : ( l)=e^i ( 0 ) [ pseudo ] the casimir vacuum energy ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) is given by e_0=(-_n ( + n-12)^2 )    the vacuum energy dependence on @xmath54 is in this case relatively smooth .",
    "the only cuspidal point at @xmath55 corresponds to periodic boundary conditions .",
    "a completely regular behaviour is obtained for robin boundary conditions u = e^2 i : _",
    "n(0)= ( 0),_n(l)= ( l ) [ robs ] which smoothly interpolate between dirichlet ( @xmath56 ) and neumann ( @xmath57 ) conditions when @xmath58 is restricted to the interval @xmath59 $ ] @xcite .",
    "finally , the casimir energy for quasi - periodic boundary conditions @xcite e_0=(-_n(+n+14)^2 ) [ qp ] is also dependent on the choice of the parameter @xmath58 .",
    "two particularly interesting cases are given by @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 , @xmath63 which correspond to a zaremba ( mixed ) boundary conditions : one boundary is dirichlet and the other neumann .",
    "the dependence of vacuum energy on boundary conditions seems to suggest that many other observables may suffer the same effect . in particular , one may wonder whether or not the entropy of the system is dependent on the type of conditions that constrain the values of the fields at the boundary .",
    "the entropy of the field theory at finite temperature scales with the volume of physical space . only in quantum gravity or string",
    "theory the entropy can scale with the area of black hole horizon .",
    "however , in field theory it is possible    to generate a mixed state from the pure vacuum state @xmath64 by integrating out the fluctuating modes in a bounded domain @xmath65 of the physical space @xmath0 ( see figure 1 ) = _ _ 0^_0 .",
    "the entropy of this state @xmath66 , although ultravioletly divergent , provides a measure of the degree of entanglement of the vacuum state . in the case of a free massless real scalar field theory in one - dimensional spaces ( @xmath67 ) this entropy scales logarithmically with the size @xmath68 of @xmath65 and the ultraviolet cut - off @xmath69 introduced to split apart the domain @xmath65 and its complement @xmath70 s_=13 , [ eone ] and in @xmath71 dimensions it scales linearly with the perimeter @xmath72 of @xmath65 s_=c_2 - [ etwo ] and in @xmath73 dimensions as the volume of the boundary of @xmath65 s_=c__d v _ ^1-d .",
    "[ ethree ] in particular in three - dimensional spaces it scales with the area of the boundary of @xmath65 like in the presence of a blackhole @xcite .",
    "although the coefficients of the leading terms @xmath74 in ( [ etwo ] ) and ( [ ethree ] ) have been explicitly computed , they are not universal because they obviously depend on the choice of the uv cutoff @xmath69 . on the contrary ,",
    "the coefficient @xmath75 of the logarithmic term in ( [ eone ] ) is universal and does coincide with one third of the central charge of the corresponding conformal field theory .",
    "similarly , the finite @xmath76 term in ( [ etwo ] ) is also universal in @xmath71 dimension and is related to a degree of topological entanglement @xcite .",
    "it is remarkable that in @xmath67 the coefficient @xmath75 is also independent of the choice of boundary condition in @xmath0 .",
    "this in contrast with what happens for the finite size corrections to vacuum energy .",
    "the coefficient of the @xmath77 term is also proportional to the central charge but in that case the corresponding factor is very sensitive to the type of boundary conditions imposed at the boundary of @xmath0 .",
    "the above results indicate that whereas the casimir energy is closely related with the infrared properties of the conformal theory which are sensitive to the boundary conditions , the entanglement entropy is rather associated to the behaviour at the interface between @xmath65 and its complement @xmath70 which do not depend on the choice of boundary conditions at the edge of the physical space .",
    "the description of regular boundary conditions in terms of unitary matrices provides a very useful framework for the description of the boundary renormalization group flow and the breaking of conformal invariance due to boundary effects .",
    "neumann conditions turn out to be the only boundary conditions which are absolutely stable under rg flow .",
    "all other boundary conditions may have some relevant perturbations which are the source of rg instabilities .",
    "however , the global structure of the flow does not permit topological transitions .",
    "the finite size corrections to vacuum energy are very sensitive to the choice of boundary conditions which discriminate between the different fixed points of the renormalization group flow . on the contrary ,",
    "the leading contribution to entanglement entropy of the vacuum is insensitive , for one - dimensional massless scalar field theories , to the change of boundary conditions . in d=2 dimensions the same property holds for the finite correction to the entanglement entropy of massless scalar theories",
    "this fact , is very relevant for the implementation of quantum codes with topological stability @xcite .",
