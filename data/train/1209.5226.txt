    "metallic magnetic tunnel junctions ( mtjs ) are important building blocks of spintronic devices such as magnetic random access memories or hard disk drive read heads . also mtjs based on ferromagnetic semiconductors could be promising for future device applications as they could combine magnetic memory and semiconductor logic functions in the same class of materials .",
    "presently , gamnas can be considered the most prominent prototype of diluted magnetic semiconductors @xcite .",
    "a variety of gamnas - based mtjs with various barrier materials have been studied so far : alas @xcite , gaas @xcite , ingaas @xcite , znse @xcite and almnas @xcite .",
    "the electronic key parameters such as the tunneling magnetoresistance ( tmr ) ratio of such semiconducting mtjs are usually determined by perpendicular - to - plane magnetoresistance ( ppmr ) measurements between the top and the bottom contact of a micropatterned mtj pillar . however",
    ", during such ppmr measurements electrical contacting of the top contact , e.g. , by wire bonding , could lead to an electrostatically or mechanically induced modification or even destruction of the mtj s the delicate tunnel barrier yielding wrong tmr parameters .",
    "+ here we show that low - ohmic shunting of the in - plane mtj resistance by a metallic top contact can induce significant perpendicular - to - plane current components .",
    "this effect can be used to derive the tmr from in - plane magnetoresistance ( ipmr ) measurements of large mtj pillar structures thereby avoiding the aforementioned problems .",
    "based on finite element simulations we further show that such shunting can also induce strongly inhomogeneous current densities in ppmr measurements of micron or sub - micron scale mtj pillars .",
    "this effect has to be taken into account for the reliable determination of the resistance area product ( ra ) and the spin torque @xcite critical current density @xmath0 from ppmr measurements .",
    "our gamnas mtj stacks are grown in a low - temperature mbe environment on a semi - insulating gaas wafer .",
    "details of our gamnas growth procedure are published elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the stack consists of 100@xmath1 nm carbon - doped @xmath2-gaas as a non - magnetic bottom contact line and a junction of ( 100@xmath1nm)/barrier / gamnas(50@xmath1 nm ) with about 5% of mn concentration in both gamnas layers .",
    "the barrier of the mtj stack consists of @xmath3 thick alas sandwiched between two @xmath4 thick layers of gaas .",
    "the wafers are fabricated into rectangular pillars with @xmath5 x @xmath5 lateral extensions as shown in the microscope image of fig .",
    "the samples consist of an mtj pillar with one top contact ( tc ) , two bottom contacts ( bc ) and a gaas : c bottom lead between the two bcs and the bottom mtj layer .",
    "a sectional sketch of the sample is shown in fig .",
    "1(b ) . + the fabrication of the pillar structures is carried out by multiple e - beam lithography steps in combination with lift - off and wet etching . the ohmic tc and bc consist of @xmath6 ti and @xmath7 au . the tc is directly deposited on the uppermost gamnas layer of the mtj whereas the bc contacts the highly c - doped gaas lead via a remaining 30@xmath1 nm thick gamnas layer",
    "this allows the realization of well defined ohmic contacts to the gaas : c . for magnetotransport measurements the samples were wire - bonded and placed in a commercial he cryostat with variable temperature insert allowing the application of 3d magnetic vector fields up to @xmath8 .",

    "for in - plane easy axis loops , the field is applied along the [ 001 ] crystalline orientation .",

    "however , surprisingly the measurement of @xmath9 shows a very similar behavior as @xmath10 with a similar tmr ratio but twice the resistance difference : @xmath18 .",
    "this similarity suggests a current path which leads twice through the tmr structure as sketched by the black arrow in fig .",
    "the low - ohmic gold tc of the pillar has a resistivity which is about two orders of magnitude lower than the resistivity of the bottom gaas : c layer below the pillar .",

    "for this current path the tmr of the mtj is measured twice in series explaining the factor of two between both resistance differences , @xmath19 and @xmath20 respectively , in a straightforward manner . to confirm this scenario similar mtj pillars without the central au tc were fabricated and characterized ( not shown ) .",
    "these samples do not show a significant tmr signal in the ipmr measurements .",
    "this is expected as no by a low ohmic tc is present in these devices . in the above measurements of the shunted devices",
    "basically the same tmr ratio is derived for both ipmr and ppmr .",
    "this could allow an alternative way to measure the tmr of a mtj in a planar geometry .",
    "the practical advantage of such a configuration is the absence of a bonding wire on the pillar tc .",
    "this would reduce the risk of damaging the delicate tunneling structures during the bonding process and migth allow simplified device fabrication .",
    "the above low - ohmic shunting should result in a strongly inhomogeneous current density near the pillar edges . to confirm this and to estimate the length scale of this inhomogeneous current distribution two dimensional finite element simulations of the current distribution",

    "@xmath22 was varied from 0.1 to 100 s / m and the resistance of the complete device was calculated . from the comparison of the calculated resistance to the experimental values we can estimate that that @xmath22 of our devices is between 1 and 10 s / m . + figure 3 shows typical maps of the simulated current density @xmath23 distribution during such ipmr measurements . in the figure the current distribution near the edge of the mtj pillar",

    "in contrast , practically no current flows in the tc gold layer , at least in the displayed part of the mtj pillar . for this tunnel conductance , the shunting effect should thus be small or negligible . also for the case of @xmath24 1 s / m most of",
    "the current still flows in the lower gamnas layer and in the gaas : c .",
