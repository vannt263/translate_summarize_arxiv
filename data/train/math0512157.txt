    "the modern theory of regular polytopes and their geometric realizations in euclidean spaces has been greatly influenced by the discovery of the petrie - coxeter polyhedra in @xmath1 and coxeter s regular skew polyhedra in @xmath2 ( see coxeter  @xcite , dress  @xcite , grnbaum  @xcite , mcmullen  @xcite , and @xcite ) .",
    "two of the petrie - coxeter polyhedra and all of coxeter s skew polyhedra inherit their symmetry properties directly from self - dual regular figures , namely the cubical tessellation in @xmath1 , and the self - dual regular convex polytopes ( the @xmath0-simplex @xmath3 and @xmath4-cell @xmath5 ) or the double @xmath6-gonal prisms ( or @xmath7 ) in @xmath2 , respectively ( see section  [ chimprop ] ) .",
    "however , the symmetries of these figures provide only one half of the symmetries of the polyhedra ; the other half corresponds to the dualities ( see @xcite ) .",
    "coxeter credited petrie with the original idea of admitting infinite regular polyhedra in @xmath1 with skew vertex - figures . in particular",
    ", petrie discovered two of the petrie - coxeter polyhedra , and then coxeter found the third and carried out the corresponding enumeration in @xmath2 . in @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "this enumeration is extended to hyperbolic @xmath8-space @xmath9 , where there are thirty - one regular skew polyhedra .",
    "the connection between self - dual polytopes and skew polyhedra was further investigated in @xcite in the context of abstract regular polytopes , where a construction of regular  petrie - coxeter - type \" polyhedra from self - dual regular @xmath0-polytopes is described .",
    "in this paper we extend these ideas to abstract chiral polytopes .",
    "we exploit the two different kinds of self - duality ( proper and improper self - duality ) for chiral polytopes and present constructions of polyhedra , which are chiral or regular , depending on the kind of self - duality of the original chiral @xmath0-polytope . from improperly",
    "self - dual chiral @xmath0-polytopes we obtain chiral  petrie - coxeter - type \" polyhedra ( or maps ) , that is , abstract chiral analogues of the ordinary petrie - coxeter polyhedra .",

    "these conditions essentially say that @xmath11 shares many combinatorial properties with classical polytopes .",
