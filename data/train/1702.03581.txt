    "entanglement is one of the central quantum phenomena that distinguish quantum systems from their classical counterparts .",
    "it has profound implications in many different contexts of modern physics and has both driven theoretical discussions of the foundations of quantum mechanics and motivated promising applications in quantum information and quantum computation . in quantum many - body physics ,",
    "the study of entanglement is focused on the survival , or lack thereof , of entanglement between individual particles when a large number of particles organize themselves with interactions in a condensed matter system @xcite .",
    "some of the characteristics of the correlations generated this way are quantified by the concept of ` entanglement entropy ' and it s scaling with the system size .",
    "scaling of entanglement entropy is often closely related to the spectral gap of a system , although an exact relation is still somewhat elusive , especially in higher dimensions . in a gapped system ,",
    "correlations are short - ranged , and entanglement entropy is expected to obey an area law ( see , e. g. @xcite ) , which says the entanglement entropy of a region scales with the area of the boundary of the region as opposed to its volume . in one dimension",
    "the entanglement entropy of a subsystem is bounded by a constant regardless of its length , as shown in @xcite . for gapless systems ,",
    "( 1 + 1)-dimensional conformal field theory study gives logarithmic scaling @xcite , and fermi liquids exhibit logarithmic scaling in any dimension @xcite .",
    "recently , efforts have been made to find one - dimensional spin systems with more severe violations of the area law @xcite .",
    "these exotic scalings are achieved at the price of either introducing a high - dimensional local hilbert space or sacrificing translational invariance .",
    "based on previous work by bravyi et al @xcite , movassagh and shor @xcite first introduced a highly - entangled ( power - law scaling ) integer spin-@xmath5 chain ( @xmath6 ) that enjoys several physically appealing features , including relatively small dimensionality of the local hilbert space , short - range interaction and translational invariance .",
    "furthermore , the model hamiltonian is frustration free : it can be written as a sum of local projectors sharing a unique simultaneous ground state .",
    "inspired by this work , in @xcite we have used the idea to describe a class of hamiltonians with a tunable parameter @xmath7 that exhibits a novel quantum phase transition .",
    "the @xmath8 phase , in particular , features an enhanced scaling of entanglement entropy to a full extensive ( volume ) scaling .",
    "the phase exhibits additional unusual properties .",
    "for example , the spectral gap has been shown to decrease exceptionally fast as a function of system size @xmath9 .",
    "an initial estimate of exponential decay has been improved by levine and movassagh @xcite to an unusually fast decay as @xmath10 .",
    "recently , numerical studies on the nature of the gap in @xmath11 phase in the deformed motzkin model have been carried out suggesting a type of topological order in the haldane phase @xcite .",
    "another realization of the new bound to extensive phase transition based on the fredkin model @xcite .",
    "this model utilizes half - integer spin chains , with next nearest neighbor interactions based on the so - called fredkin gate @xcite . in @xcite a proof of the entropy scaling is given , but the underlying conditions for the frustration free deformation are not fully clarified .    in this paper",
    "we explain the condition for a frustration free deformation in more detail . in doing",
    "so we unveil the more general class of deformations , that maintain a frustration free ground state .",
    "in addition we give an alternative , fully self - contained version of the proof of entropy scaling that might yield further insights of the underlying physics .",
    "in addition , we prove an upper bound on the scaling of the spectral gap using a variational wave function that explicitly manifests the super- exponential decay of the gap giving a physical intuition behind the scaling established in @xcite .    the paper is structured as follows . in section [ hgs ] ,",
    "we briefly review the constituting ingredients dyck walk and fredkin interaction of the hamiltonian and ground state of fredkin spin chain and show how the deformation parameter @xmath7 fit in without compromising its frustration free feature of the hamiltonian and the uniqueness of its ground state . in section [ entent ] , we illuminate the mechanism behind the linear scaling of entanglement entropy of fredkin spin chain by introducing the non - commutative ` height ' and ` shift ' operators , without resorting to any mathematical knowledge beyond analysis . in section [ spgp ]",
    ", we exploit features of the hamiltonian and it s ground state to construct a low energy excitation state that has an exponentially small gap .",
    "finally , in section [ discussion ] , we point out several possible future directions .",
    "we start with a brief review of dyck walks , which span the ground state subspace of the hilbert space of the fredkin spin chain hamiltonian introduced in @xcite .    a dyck walk ( or path ) on @xmath12 steps is any path from @xmath13 to @xmath14 with steps @xmath15 and @xmath16 that never passes below the @xmath17-axis .",
    "a dyck walk can be mapped to a spin configuration of a spin-@xmath0 chain @xmath18 with @xmath19 or @xmath20 for a @xmath15 or @xmath21th step respectively . when each step is assigned a color @xmath22 from a palette of @xmath5 colors",
    ", @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) corresponds to a state @xmath25 ( resp .",
    "@xmath26 ) . and a colored dyck walk can , therefore , represent the spin configuration of any half - integer spin chain . in the original fredkin spin chain model ,",
    "the ground state is a uniform superposition of colored dyck walks . here following @xcite , we present a class of hamiltonians that feature higher probability amplitudes in the superposition for paths with greater heights .",
    "our hamiltonians have a reduced contribution to entanglement from fluctuation in path shape , which are greatly reduced , however we have an enhanced contribution to entanglement from color degrees of freedom , which , in turn , is responsible for the volume scaling of entanglement .",
    "we introduce a parameter @xmath7 that deforms the fredkin hamiltonian of @xcite while remaining frustration free .",
    "the hamiltonian is given by : @xmath27 where @xmath28 @xmath29,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath30 the projectors in @xmath31 are defined using : @xmath32 .",
    "the fredkin gate projectors in @xmath31 allows a pair of @xmath33 neighboring spins ( with the same color enforced by the first term in @xmath34 ) to move freely around its left or right third neighbor and still appear in the ground state superposition , but now with a different probability amplitude .",
    "the second term in @xmath34 ensures that otherwise identical dyck paths with different coloring have the same weight .",
    "and the boundary term @xmath35 ( together with the fredkin projectors ) penalizes paths that go below @xmath36 at any point along the chain .",
    "notice that analogous to @xcite , the simplest choice is a parameter @xmath37 being the same in the two projectors of @xmath31 is the one employed in @xcite , but is only a subset of the parameter space that leaves the hamiltonian frustration free . more generally , we introduce parameters @xmath38 and @xmath39 , for the two projectors in @xmath40",
    ". then any set of @xmath41 that satisfies the condition @xmath42 for all @xmath43 s would guarantee the hamiltonian to be frustration free .. ] the point is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ ffcondition ] .",
    "in particular , we may specify a hamiltonian with a frustration - free ground state by picking any set of the @xmath44 parameters .        we now want to characterize the ground state of the system .",
    "first , let us denote @xmath45 to be the height of the dyck path after step @xmath46 , that is , for a spin configuration @xmath47 describing a dyck path , @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the pauli matrix giving @xmath50 if spin @xmath43 is in state @xmath51 or @xmath52 , respectively . the height function is illustrated for a generic dyck path in fig .",
    "[ heights ] .",

    "this process is repeated for each peak until the lowest height hill is achieved.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]    in this way , the weight of each dyck paths is related to the weight of the lowest height , @xmath54 path .",
    "note that we have suppressed the color index in this treatment since , as mentioned above , in the ground state superposition all admissible colorings should appear with the same amplitude .",
    "the amplitude of a given dyck path in the ground state of the model is thus given by counting the number of `` diamonds '' associated with each @xmath44 , and can be written in the form : @xmath55\\log ( t_{l-1}^a)}|w\\rangle , \\label{eq : gs}\\ ] ] where @xmath56 $ ] is the integer part of @xmath17 and @xmath57 is a normalization factor . in the case",
    "where @xmath58 , the ground state can be simply related to the area under the path as : @xmath59",
    "in this section , we employ the simplest choice of parameters which is translational invariant @xmath60 everywhere .",
    "when @xmath61 , the entanglement entropy of the ground state scales as @xmath62 for @xmath63 and as @xmath64 for @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "the reason our deformation with the extra parameter can further increase the scaling of entropy is because when a spin is moved around its neighboring @xmath33 pair , it is separated from its own partner paired in the same color , which is the first unpaired down spin to its right ( or up spin to its left ) .",
    "this way , when a pair of spins required to be in the same color are shifted to different subsystems of the chain , they become a source of entanglement entropy between the two subsystems . tuning the parameter @xmath7 to favor higher paths in the ground state superposition",
    "will now enhance the more substantial contribution from those with more unpaired spins in one subsystem . to put this in a mathematical way",
    ", we decompose the ground state into tensor products of states in the left and right halves of the chain .",
    "@xmath65 where @xmath66 is a weighted superposition of spin configurations with @xmath67 excess @xmath68 , @xmath69 excess @xmath70 and a particular coloring @xmath17 of the unmatched arrows , such that @xmath71 , and @xmath72 is the coloring in the second half of the chain that matches @xmath17 .",

    ", we can see that for large enough @xmath7 , @xmath76 will be monotonically increasing as we increase @xmath77 by increments of @xmath79 .",
    "paths with height in the middle scaling as @xmath80 will contribute more to the entanglement entropy from the @xmath81 possible colorings of unmatched spins . in particular , the half chain entanglement entropy will also scale linearly with system size @xmath3 . in the next subsection",
    ", we give a rigorous proof that this is true in the thermodynamic , and that this critical phase of large entanglement spans the entire half line @xmath8 .      in this section",
    "we repeat the steps taken in @xcite , to prove volume scaling for weighted motzkin walks , with a few modifications . for arbitrary @xmath8 ,",
    "the non - zero entries of @xmath76 are not necessarily monotonic in terms of @xmath77 , but we can still show that for a given @xmath3 , @xmath76 reaches its maximum at some @xmath83 , within a finite distance away from @xmath84 independent of the system size @xmath3 itself .",
    "this is not obvious in the step - by - step recurrence relations , but becomes clear as we take into account the accumulated effect of the evolution of the coefficients @xmath76 with respect to @xmath3 . to see this , we summarize in the following operator formalism .",
    "as in @xcite , we represent the distributions of @xmath85 as components of the state at ` time ' @xmath86 during the ` evolution ' in a basis spanned by @xmath87 , @xmath88 .",

    "[ lemma : pnm bound ] we see that when @xmath142 + 1,\\ ] ] we have @xmath143 it is easy to check that the function @xmath144 is monotonically increasing when @xmath145 , in other words , for @xmath146 , @xmath147 therefore @xmath148 where we used @xmath149 for entropy terms with @xmath150 in the last inequality .",
    "notice our proof here does not rely on the fact that @xmath6 , and it applies to the @xmath63 case as well .",
    "since entanglement entropy is a measure of correlation in the system , a high entanglement entropy indicates that the system is highly correlated and also a gapless spectrum ( in the thermodynamic limit ) @xcite . as our model at @xmath82 exhibits",
    "linear scaling of entanglement entropy , we expect the spectral gap to be also decreasing faster with system size than the @xmath61 . here",
    ", we give variational proof that the spectral gap for @xmath82 decreases exponentially with a square of the system size .",
    "just as the linear scaling of entanglement entropy results from the prominence of the higher weighted paths in the ground state superposition , gaplessness can be shown by truncating lower weighted paths at the price of softly violating the superposition required to make the projectors in the hamiltonian vanishing .",
    "to do so it is convenient to define a ` prime walk ' as follows :    a prime dyck walk is a dyck walk that is always above the x - axis , except at the endpoints .    by this definition ,",
    "a dyck walk is either prime or a concatenation of prime walks ( fig .",
    "[ excit ] exhibits a dyck walk in solid line made of two prime walks and one in dashed line made of three prime walks ) .    to construct a low energy variational excited state , we start with an auxiliary state that projects out all the walks in the ground state superposition whose longest prime walk has a length smaller than @xmath151 .",
    "that is , define : @xmath152 and @xmath153 the complement of @xmath154 .",
    "our auxiliary state is defined as : @xmath155 for @xmath8 higher walks are favored rendering the auxiliary state largely overlapping with the ground state and therefore unqualified as a low energy excitation state . however , the color degree of freedom allows us to make this state orthogonal to the ground state by permuting the color of the last down move ( or equivalently the first up move ) in the longest prime walk .",
    "this way , all walks in the new superposition have one pair of spins with unmatched colors , and consequently orthogonal to all paths in the ground state .",
    "the choice of the ` n+1 ' threshold on the cut - off of longest prime walk length eliminates the potential ambiguity in the location of the color permutation so that each path in the superposition has exactly one pair of unmatched colores .",
    "we define the excited state @xmath156 as : @xmath157 where @xmath158 is the new normalization factor and the operator @xmath159 sends the color @xmath160 of the last down move of the longest prime walk to @xmath161 and leaves everything else unchanged . and because of the color imbalance , @xmath162 let us compute the variational energy associated with the @xmath156 state .",
    "first we note that : @xmath163 as each non - matching color pair is separated by at least @xmath3 sites ( while @xmath34 is only sensitive to nearest neighbor violations ) .",
    "the same goes for most of the projectors in @xmath31 just the way it works in the ground state .",
    "however , in @xmath31 , we have also non - zero contributions coming from walks @xmath164 that are one `` fredkin '' move away from leaving the set @xmath165 .",
    "in other words , this happens when the first ( second ) projector in @xmath31 in eq .",
    "acts on the left ( resp .",
    "right ) endpoint of the longest prime walk and changes its length from @xmath151 to @xmath166 ( the kind of which is absent in the superposition ) .",
    "for instance , applying the projectors on @xmath167 ( eq . ) to the prime walk @xmath164 corresponding to the one in fig .",
    "[ excit ] gives :     that crosses the threshold of the cut - off when acted on by the operator @xmath168.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    @xmath169    and @xmath170 with @xmath171 is any other walk in the @xmath156 ( i.e. any other walk in @xmath154 ) .",
    "we can now estimate the variational energy due to such paths .",
    "the number of these paths that will go from @xmath154 to @xmath172 when applying a fredkin projector is very roughly bounded from above by @xmath173 ( which is the total number of walks ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the probability amplitudes of a path that has a prime walk length of exactly @xmath151 or @xmath174 in @xmath172 , are penalized by their area differences from the highest weighted one , i.e. the shaded area in fig .",
    "[ excit ] , by a factor smaller than @xmath175 .",
    "we therefore have the following upper bound : @xmath176 thus we have proved an upper bound of exponential of square of system size on the spectral gap when @xmath82 .",
    "_ remark : _ the overall factor @xmath79 above comes from possibility of modifying the prime path on the left or on the right .",
    "we mention a few other future directions worth exploring . while we have shown how to construct a multi - parameter deformation , we have only studied entropy and gap for a uniform parameter @xmath7 .",
    "this choice keeps the chain translationally invariant , however , no momentum space arguments were involved in the analysis .",
    "a more general treatment will have to contend without the distribution of the @xmath177 parameters .",
    "second , the nature of the quantum phase transition is unclear . at a first glance",
    ", it hardly fits into the mechanism of symmetry breaking with an associated goldstone mode and exponents . to study",
    "the transition , as well as thermal effects , more detailed information about the density of states near the ground state is crucial . in particular",
    ", it would be very interesting to explore a possible field theoretic description in the continuous limit .    our argument for the gap",
    "gives an elementary way of obtaining the gap estimate of @xcite , who treated the motzkin type model , and can immediately be applied also for that motzkin model .",
    "it would be interesting to see if it is possible to construct such an argument for the case @xmath63 ( there is numerical evidence suggesting that the @xmath8 phase is gapless even for @xmath63 @xcite , although the entropy is bound in this phase ) .    finally ,",
    "although we have strong numerical evidence supporting the claim that the spectrum will be gapped when @xmath11 , we did nt work out an analytical proof so far .",
