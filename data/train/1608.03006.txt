    "one of the most puzzling peculiarities of superconductivity in electron - doped cuprates is its relationship to disorder and , in particular , to oxygen disorder @xcite .",
    "superconductivity occurs in a narrow range of cerium doping and requires an additional oxygen reduction treatment at the end of the fabrication process @xcite .",
    "the amount of oxygen removed during this ultimate annealing is very small @xcite , while the treatment has so strong influence on the electrical and magnetic properties of the samples @xcite , which change from antiferromagnetic insulators to superconductors @xcite , to suppose that also a redistribution among all possible oxygen sites could occur as well as some other structural changes @xcite .",
    "the true effects of this thermal treatment and its connection to superconductivity have been the object of intensive experimental studies , but they are still quite far from being understood and constitute one of the most intriguing challenges in the field @xcite .",
    "different microscopic mechanisms have been conjectured . on one hand ,",
    "if oxygen vacancies are created in the @xmath2 planes and/or in the charge - reservoir layers , the af correlation length will decrease(antiferromagnetic order suppression with respect to as - grown samples fabricated in oxygen rich atmosphere ) as confirmed by angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy on differently oxygenated single crystals @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "if non - stoichiometric oxygens at the apical positions are removed , the disorder will be reduced @xcite : in optimally reduced crystals , electron localization and pair breaking effects are reduced with respect to as - grown and over - reduced samples @xcite . moreover ,",
    "the evidence of a structural restructuring involving copper ion migration @xcite and the change of the _ c _ lattice parameter @xcite have been reported among the consequences of the high - temperature oxygen - reduction treatment inducing superconductivity .",
    "one more ingredient in the puzzle is connected to the extreme conditions in which the annealing procedure necessary to induce superconductivity has to be carried out @xcite .",
    "accordingly , such a treatment inevitably becomes itself one of the main sources of disorder in the system .",
    "such a disorder ( mainly related to oxygen vacancies and non - stoichiometric occupations ) largely affect the spectrum of the excitations in the system and is held responsible for the localization effects observed in the in - plane transport properties @xcite . in particular , it was reported that the temperature @xmath3 at which the in - plane resistivity features a minimum in metallic ( low - temperature reduced ) and superconducting ( high - temperature reduced ) samples can be decreased by repeated low - temperature annealing procedures in oxygen deficient atmosphere @xcite .",
    "such a behavior can be easily explained in terms of a reduction of the degree of positional disorder of the in - plane oxygen vacancies at each cycle of such a treatment with a consequent reduction of their ( or of any related scattering center ) de - phasing capabilities . along this line ,",
    "the high - temperature treatments ( necessary to induce superconductivity ) could be instead held responsible for the removal of non - stoichiometric oxygens at the apical positions and for the related change of the lattice parameter in the _ c _ direction .    guided by the idea that defects not only affect the spectrum of excitations of the pristine system , but they can even induce / foster _ new _ excitations in the system in connection to their degree of positional disorder , we have performed time - resolved reflectivity ( trr ) pump - probe experiments on three films of @xmath0 with substantially different in - plane transport properties induced by different fabrication procedures and/or ex - situ thermal treatments with respect to oxygen content and disorder .",
    "our choice of the trr technique was dictated by the well - proven capability of pump - probe techniques to reveal the presence of various kinds of excitations in a system identifying their different relaxation dynamics @xcite .",
    "excitation manifested as _ additional _ relaxation channel proving that it is possible to turn a trr measurement , although indirectly , into a disorder - sensitive probe .",
    "then , comparing the features in temperature of the in - plane resistivity of the three samples to the features in temperature of the _ additional _ relaxation processes parametrization , we have managed to prove our initial hypothesis .    it is necessary to clarify how we have identified the _ new _ excitations and the related _ additional _ relaxation channels : similar trr pump - probe experiments have already been performed on a optimally - reduced single crystal of the same material with a value of cerium doping equal to @xmath4 @xcite . in such measurements , at temperatures above the superconducting critical one , a single relaxation channel has been identified and assigned to those excitations responsible for the so - called _ pseudogap _ phenomenology .",
    "our measurements reproduce faithfully such results , but also evidence the existence of a _ second _ relaxation channel whose parametrization unequivocally shows features in temperature that can be strictly related to those reported by the in - plane resistivity of our samples .",
    "given the main objective to identify _ new _ excitations and _ additional _ relaxation channels to be strictly and unambiguously connected to oxygen disorder , we have chosen the system to study and the conditions under which performing this study so to have a well defined reference and , consequently , to be in the best possible conditions to appreciate similarities and differences .",
    "this is the obvious reason why we have not only chosen a system where trr pump - probe experiments have already been performed @xcite , without showing any additional channel with respect to the _ canonical _ ones ( pseudogap and superconductivity ) , but we also used the same central wavelength ( @xmath5{nm}$ ] ) and working pump fluence ( @xmath6{\\mu j / cm^{2}}$ ] ) .",
    "this allowed us first to benchmark our results by reproducing those already obtained in ref .   as regards both the pseudogap and the superconducting channels ( the presence of the latter is a trademark of quality in itself for such systems ) .",
    "second , in these conditions , if any different behavior among our films and the single - crystal sample used in ref .   would come out from our measurements , it can only be assigned to the main difference between them : the disorder caused by the different oxygen content and location induced in the fabrication process .",
    "if a system sustains a collective excitation of any kind , the raman interaction @xmath7 describes the coupling of an applied electric field @xmath8 ( e.g. , the one carried by the laser pump pulse ) to such a collective mode @xcite : @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the mean value of the related _ ladder _ operator @xmath11 , @xmath12 is the _ displacement _ operator , @xmath13 is the mean value before the application of the field and @xmath14 is the dielectric tensor of the system . in principle , the dielectric tensor @xmath14 depends on all collective excitations of the system and when one of them gets _ excited _",
    "( i.e. , when @xmath15 ) also @xmath14 gets modified : @xmath16 .",
    "then , the reflectivity @xmath17 measured by a second time - delayed pulse ( e.g. , the laser probe pulse ) is different from the reflectivity measured at equilibrium ( i.e. , before the application of the pump pulse ) @xmath18 : @xmath19 , where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the incident and reflected directions .",
    "this mechanism is known as impulsive stimulated raman scattering ( isrs ) @xcite and turns very efficiently trr measurements into an invaluable tool to discover collective excitations : @xmath22 .",
    "unfortunately , it is not possible to identify unambiguously the nature of the mode ( spin , charge , orbital ,  ) in this way , but it is possible to study the properties of the excitations by analyzing the features of the corresponding relaxation processes ( lifetime of the mode , type and strength of its damping ,  ) .",
    "in fact , within the linear response regime ( i.e. , when @xmath23 where @xmath24 ) and for pulses much shorter than the characteristic response time of the mode ( i.e. , when @xmath25 ) , the change in reflectivity is proportional to the time - dependent impulsive response function @xmath26 of the excited mode : @xmath27 .",
    "accordingly , in presence of one or more critically damped modes ( i.e. , when @xmath28 ) , the differential transient reflectivity @xmath29 has the expression : @xmath30 such a behavior , at temperatures above the superconducting critical one , is exactly what has been found in ref .   for a single mode that they assigned to the excitations responsible for the _ pseudogap _ phenomenology ( @xmath31 and @xmath32 ) . here , we search for a second mode of this very same kind whose @xmath33 and @xmath34 present features that can be related to those of the in - plane resistivity of our three samples .    :",

    "dc sputtering technique was optimized to grow @xmath42 films on ( 100 ) @xmath43 ( sto ) substrates by using a single stoichiometric target as a sputtering source in an on - axis configuration with the substrate @xcite .",
    "the films were grown in pure argon ( @xmath44 ) ( sample b ) or in a mixed atmosphere of @xmath44 and oxygen ( @xmath45 ) , with ratio @xmath46 , at a total pressure of 1.7 mbar ( sample c ) and heater temperature of about 850c .",
    "part of the sample b was ex - situ thermally treated in flowing argon at a temperature of 900c to obtain the sample a , that shows a superconducting transition at temperature @xmath47{k}$ ] ( at 50% @xmath48 ) with @xmath49{k}$ ] .",
    "the morphology , phase composition , and purity of the grown samples were inspected by high - resolution x - ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy combined with wavelength dispersive spectroscopy @xcite : well oriented films were obtained without spurious phases and a cerium content of @xmath50 .",
    "the electrical transport properties were investigated by using the standard four probe technique in a cryogenic variable - temperature system .",
    "the only difference among the three films , which have been _ _ fabricated _ ad hoc , _ is then the oxygen content and location that lead to completely different temperature dependences of the in - plane resistivity [ see fig .

    "the pump fluence on the sample ranges from @xmath6{\\mu j / cm^{2}}$ ] to @xmath55{\\mu j / cm^{2}}$ ] , while the probe fluence is fixed at @xmath6{\\mu j / cm^{2}}$ ] .",
    "the sample is located into an optical cryostat , equipped with a cold finger and using a temperature controlled liquid helium continuous flow .",
    "the measurements were performed in a temperature range between @xmath56{k}$ ] and @xmath57{k}$ ] .",
    "for each temperature , the pump - probe signal is averaged over several fast - scan sweeps .    [ cols=\"^ \" , ]      given the positive outcome of the scaling analysis for all three samples ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] ) , we can confidently use eq .",
    "( [ eq : fit ] ) to analyze the data and determine the minimal number of relaxation channels necessary to fit them .",
    "this preliminary analysis shows that just two channels are active in all three samples and that only four parameters ( @xmath58 and @xmath59 ) are necessary to fit the data at all analyzed temperatures . in fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] , the temperature dependence of these four parameters is reported and compared among the three different samples . the behavior of @xmath60 and @xmath61 resemble the one found in ref .  .",
    "in particular , we have @xmath62 , which suggests that the excitations responsible for this relaxation channel are related to a _ hidden _ order establishing only at @xmath63 .",
    "this also suggests that these excitations are the same quasi - particles lacking global coherence often invoked to explain the opening of a _ pseudogap _ in the electronic density of states , reported in many different experiments , through a dynamic exchange with ordinary electrons . the first and most remarkable difference with respect to",
    "what found in @xcite is the change of behavior , on decreasing temperature , in both @xmath60 and @xmath61 around the temperature @xmath64 , where the resistance features a minimum [ see fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ( a ) ] : @xmath60 changes suddenly its slope and @xmath61 starts decreasing .",
    "the presence of such a minimum in the resistance is due to disorder and it is evident that these pump - probe measurements are somehow sensitive to this latter . in particular , decreasing the temperature , starting right at @xmath64 , the amplitude of the second contribution @xmath65 becomes significant [ see fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] ( c ) ] , marking the occurence of a second overdamped mode and , correspondingly , of a second relaxation channel presumably directly connected to disorder . in order to prove the hypothesis that this second relaxation channel is strictly connected to disorder , we analyze the behavior of the four fitting parameters in the other two samples with completely different transport properties .    in sample",
    "b , in a region of temperature close to @xmath66 , @xmath67 changes its slope , although less suddenly than @xmath60 at @xmath64 , and @xmath68 changes functional dependence on temperature : @xmath69 for temperatures above @xmath66 and @xmath70 for temperatures below @xmath66 .",
    "what is even more worth noticing is that both @xmath71 becomes significant and @xmath72 jumps from one to another almost constant value right at @xmath66 .",
    "such a jump is present in @xmath73 too and , at the lowest temperatures , @xmath34 assumes almost the same value in both samples . in sample c ,",
    "the insulating behavior dominates the resistive response and no evident minimum is present .",
    "again , @xmath74 becomes significant only below a certain temperature , @xmath75{k}$ ] , and then shows a behavior remarkably similar to the one reported for @xmath71 .",
    "@xmath72 does not show any noticeable change at that temperature , except for a very small jump in the opposite direction with respect to those observed in the other two samples , and assumes almost the same value reported for the other two samples at low enough temperatures , signaling a kind of _ universality _ in the dynamics of this second excitation . as a matter of fact",
    ", it is just the coincidence in the behavior and range of values of @xmath33 and in the values at low temperatures reported for @xmath34 across all three samples , although these latter are so different in the resistive response , to be very remarkable and suggestive of a common behavior for the slowest relaxation channel .",
    "if we analyze the behavior of @xmath76 and @xmath77 , we can recognize a change in slope in @xmath76 around @xmath78 , but the overall behavior of @xmath76 exactly resembles the one found for @xmath67 although shifted quite higher in temperature .",
    "instead , the behavior and the values reported for @xmath77 follows very closely those reported for @xmath79 .",
    "the qualitative and quantitative coincidence in @xmath80 and @xmath32 across all three samples can be considered as a strong indication that there exists a strict relationship between the ( antiferromagnetic ) order leading to the insulating behavior in sample c and both the _ pseudogap _ phenomenon and the fastest relaxation channel in all three samples .",
    "once the behavior of @xmath74 and of @xmath81 showed the existence of a kind of critical temperature , @xmath78 , also for sample c , we have searched signatures of it also in the behavior of the resistance as a function of the temperature . plotting the resistance of sample c on a log - log scale",
    "[ see inset in fig .",
    "[ fig:1](a ) ] and the slope of the log - log tangent to the curve , @xmath41 , in proximity of the temperature @xmath78 found analyzing the optical data , there appears a change of slope in the resistivity from an almost constant @xmath40 at low temperatures to temperature dependent smaller negative values at higher temperatures .",
    "it is worth reminding that @xmath40 is what is predicted for an interacting disordered 3d _ semiconductor _ by weak localization @xcite .",
    "this is the most remarkable confirmation we could seek of the capability of pump - probe measurements to identify excitations relevant to transport and of the extreme sensitivity of such measurements .    starting from a picture where the perfect antiferromagnetic in - plane long - range spin order in the @xmath82-@xmath83 planes is weakened ( down to become just short - range ) by oxygen vacancies , it is possible to conceive a unified scenario for both types of excitations revealed by the pump - probe trr measurements .",
    "the first kind of excitations ( those described by @xmath31 and @xmath32 ) could be assigned to the in - plane magnetic fluctuations reminiscent of the antiferromagnetic order in the @xmath82-@xmath83 planes and usually related to the _ pseudogap _ phenomenon . instead , the second kind of excitations ( those described by @xmath33 and @xmath34 )",
    "could be assigned to magnetic fluctuations of the out - of - plane components of the @xmath82 spins induced by the _ @xmath83 _ vacancies in the plane .",
    "in fact , the absence of an @xmath83 breaks the exchange link between the two spins residing on the two nearest - neighbor @xmath82 ions .",
    "this allows them to acquire out - of - plane components with a specific relative order between them and with respect to all other couples of out - of - plane spin components generated by @xmath83 vacancies .",
    "this happens within a distance dictated by the residual correlation length of the underlying in - plane antiferromagnetic order .",
    "the temperature @xmath3 signals the predominance of disorder over all other source of scattering .",
    "the fact that @xmath3 can be decreased by repeated annealing procedures in @xmath83 deficient atmosphere can be then explained as such annealing procedures allow the vacancies to maximize their distances minimizing their pairwise coulomb potential .",
    "then , the vacancies somehow order ( or , at least , decrease their degree of positional disorder ) with an overall reduction of their de - phasing capability and , therefore , relevance as scattering sources . according to this , the signals measured for samples obtained following different procedures of fabrication and annealing with respect to the @xmath83 content and positional disorder is different , but coherent as we found .",
    "in summary , by carefully analyzing the resistance and the trr of three _ ad hoc _ fabricated films of @xmath0 differing only for the degree of disorder ( mainly related to oxygen vacancies and non - stoichiometric occupations ) , we have established the existence of an excitation and of the related critically damped relaxation channel .",
    "the parametrization of this latter presents features in temperature connected one to one to the transport properties of the three samples , which are dictated by the presence of defects .",
    "this clearly demonstrates that trr measurements can be extremely sensitive to disorder when this latter foster the emergence of new excitations in the system .",
    "a possible scenario for the assignment of the excitations revealed by the trr measurements has been proposed that connects the antiferromagnetic in - plane spin order , its _ canonical _ fluctuations inducing a _",
    "pseudogap _ , its weakening through the insertion of @xmath83 vacancies and the effect of the positional disorder of these latter ( controlled through well - defined annealing procedures ) on the appearence and position of a minimum in the resistance as a function of temperature and the excitations of out - of - plane magnetic fluctuations .",
    "we are quite confident that the collected data and the unambiguous experimental evidence of a connection between the two kind of measurements ( optical spectroscopy and transport ) , but also the given possible scenario , will foster further experiments and investigations .",
