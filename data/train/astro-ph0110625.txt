    "recently , @xcite have reported the detection of a transient absorption feature , consistent with a redshifted fe  k edge at the redshift of the burst , @xmath1 ( see @xcite ) , in the prompt x - ray emission from grb  990705 .",
    "this is the second time ( after grb  980329 ; @xcite ) that x - ray spectroscopy during the prompt phase of a grb revealed evidence for excess soft x - ray absorption above the galactic hydrogen column , and the first time that evidence for a time dependence of such absorption has been found .",
    "( here , we do not consider the possible absorption features detected by ginga in a few cases [ see , e.g. , @xcite ] at higher energies which were inconsistent with being due to photoelectric absorption or other atomic processes . )",
    "the transient nature of the absorption feature was rather significant : the absorption edge was detected at the @xmath2 level in observing interval b ( with its depth being consistent with the less significant detection in interval a ) , while there was @xmath3 evidence for such an absorption edge in observing interval d ( and all following intervals ) , when the upper limit on its depth was inconsistent with the value measured during interval b at the @xmath4 level .",
    "this has been interpreted as evidence for photoionization of the absorber by the prompt burst emission @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the non - transient excess absorption in grb  980329 @xcite , which does not yield very specific information about the location of the absorbing material , the transient nature of an x - ray absorption feature allows rather detailed diagnostics of the relevant physical time scales and the geometry of the grb environment .",
    "if the observed absorption feature is due to photoelectric absorption at the fe k edge , then it is natural to try to interpret the duration of the occurrence of this feature as the photoionization time scale , assuming that the absorbing material is not dense enough for recombination to be efficient .",
    "the expected x - ray absorption signatures of such a scenario had been investigated previously by @xcite who had concluded that such features are either transient on the prompt grb time scale , or remain virtually unchanged throughout the prompt and afterglow phase .",
    "however , the application of this idea to the specific case of grb  990705 by @xcite revealed that either an implausibly large amount of iron , concentrated very close to the grb , would be required , or the iron would have to be distributed very anisotropically around the burst source .",
    "as an alternative , @xcite have investigated an environment containing small , dense clumps of iron - enriched material .",
    "in such an environment , photoionization can be balanced by rapid recombination , and the duration of the absorption feature can be identified with the compton heating time scale of the absorber by the prompt grb emission , or with the sweep - up time scale of the absorbing material by the relativistic blastwave responsible for the grb and afterglow emission .",
    "this scenario can produce the observed absorption feature in grb  990705 with a reasonable amount of iron , quasi - isotropically distributed around the grb source , but required that the clumps containing this material be very dense and exhibit a rather extreme degree of clumping .",
    "finally , @xcite have suggested that the absorption feature could be a blue - shifted resonance scattering feature in an inhomogeneous high - velocity outflow .",
    "this requires that the absorbing material has a systematic average outflow velocity of @xmath5  c and a velocity dispersion @xmath6 .",
    "while this scenario can slightly reduce the required amount of iron and degree of clumping , it requires a kinetic energy of @xmath7  ergs in the directed outflow , which has to be ejected several months prior to the grb .",
    "the parameter estimates resulting from all three of these basic scenarios are summarized in table [ parametertable ] .",
    "those estimates are rather generic and independent of specific progenitor scenarios . in this paper",
    ", we are tying parameter estimates pertaining to the transient absorption feature in grb  990705 to specific grb progenitor models .",
    "this is done by deducing constraints on the supernova explosion which is likely to have happened prior to the grb , ejecting the material responsible for the transient absorption feature . in  [ models ] we briefly review the viable grb progenitor models which are generally capable of producing a significant concentration of high - z material close to the grb prior to the actual grb event .",
    "the degree of clumping of matter ejected in supernova explosions will be discussed in ",
    "[ clumping ] .",
    "model - specific estimates of the parameters pertaining to the pre - ejected material will be calculated in  [ absorptionfeatures ] .",
    "we will discuss the implications of our results in  [ discussion ] .",
    "with most long - duration grb progenitors it is hard to produce a sizable amount of iron within 1  pc of the grb engine . for most collapsar progenitors the only source of iron prior to collapse would be in the massive star s wind . unless these stars are extremely metal rich , the total mass in iron in these winds will be much less than 0.1  @xmath8 .",
    "unfortunately , metal rich massive stars lose too much mass to winds and will probably not form collapsars @xcite .",
    "the evolutionary scenario of he - merger grbs provides a more likely , although still rare , source of iron within @xmath9  pc of the grb engine .",
    "recall that the formation process of a he - merger grb requires a binary system whose primary evolves to collapse and produces a compact remnant .",
    "normal supernova explosions eject from 0.002 - 0.3  @xmath8 of @xmath10ni @xcite into the region surrounding the binary system and this @xmath10ni ultimately decays into iron .",
    "it is possible that the primary produces an abnormal supernova like supernova 1998bw which then may eject as much as a solar mass of @xmath10ni or more @xcite .",
    "when the primary remnant eventually merges with its companion , a grb is formed , exploding into this iron rich region .",
    "the difficulty lies in limiting the iron to a region within @xmath9  pc of the binary system until the merger occurs and a grb is produced ( see the values of @xmath11 in tab . [ parametertable ] ) . because the @xmath10ni is produced in the inner layers of an exploding supernova and a large fraction of @xmath10ni is ejected at low velocities ( @xmath12 1000  km  s@xmath13 ) .",
    "although these velocities are relatively low , it takes only 1000  yr for this ejecta to travel 1  pc .",
    "even if a sizable amount of @xmath10ni is ejected with lower velocities , winds from the companion star ( which tend to be massive for most he - merger grbs ) will blow the @xmath10ni away from the binary at roughly 1000  km  s@xmath13 and it is difficult to increase the maximum allowed time delay between primary supernova and grb outburst ( to be consistent with the previous parameter estimates for the absorber in grb  990705 ) by less than 1000  yr .    with the standard formation scenario of he - merger grbs , such small delays between supernova explosion and grb outburst require that the secondary star evolve off the main sequence a scant 1000  yr after the primary supernova explosion .",
    "this would require extreme fine tuning of the masses of the two stars and the likelihood of such an occurrence would be less than 0.01  % .    however , an alternate formation scenario may be more plausible .",
    "if the secondary evolves off the main sequence before the primary explosion , a common envelope phase will occur where two helium cores tighten their orbits as they inspiral within a hydrogen common envelope .",
    "typically , after the hydrogen envelope is ejected , it leaves behind two tightly orbiting helium cores . when the primary s helium core collapses , the system may be disrupted by neutron star kicks , it may remain bound , or the neutron star may be placed in such a close orbit that it quickly merges ( within 1000  yr ) with its helium star companion .",
    "the latter case , where the neutron star merges with its helium companion , produces a he - merger grb surrounded by the iron ejecta of the primary s supernova . using the binary population synthesis code developed in @xcite ,",
    "we have calculated the rate of these quick he - merger grbs for a range of population synthesis parameters .",
    "the fraction of quick mergers lies somewhere between 0.5 - 2.5  % . for most of the double helium cores which actually form he - merger grbs",
    ", there is typically a delay of 10 - 100 years from the supernova explosion to the grb outburst .",
    "sn - grb delays significantly below @xmath14  yrs could occur in the supranova model of @xcite , where the supernova explosion of a fast rotating , massive star leaves behind a rapidly spinning , supra - massive neutron star which implodes several months to several years later to form a grb .",
    "the time delay between the sn and the grb will then be determined by the spin - down time , which can be estimated as @xmath15  yr , where @xmath16 is the dimensionless angular momentum of the neutron star , @xmath17 is its angular velocity in units of @xmath18  s@xmath13 , and its surface magnetic field is @xmath19  g. detailed simulations of collapsing neutron stars @xcite seem to indicate that , in contrast to vietri & stella s original suggestion , this process ejects a rather large amount of baryonic material and has too little energy to produce a grb .",
    "however , strong beaming of a relativistic outflow along the rotational axis may overcome the latter problem so that we will consider the supranova model as a conceivable alternative in this paper , although more detailed simulations are needed in order to address the concerns mentioned above .",
    "supernova 1987a surprised astronomers by giving strong evidence that the @xmath10ni ejected in the explosion was mixed into the outer layers of the star @xcite .",
    "this @xmath10ni fragmented into high velocity `` bullets '' @xcite which could potentially be the clumps necessary to explain the absorption feature in grb  990705 .",
    "it is believed that rayleigh - taylor instabilities which arise when the shock moves through the composition layers of the star produce this mixing and lead to clumps of @xmath10ni on size scales from 1 to 5 degrees ( see @xcite , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "spatially resolved spectroscopy of galactic snrs by the _",
    "chandra _ x - ray observatory ( e.g. , @xcite ) confirmed the tendency of element mixing and clumping of the high - z material into dense blobs in snrs .",
    "this is in agreement with detailed 3d hydrodynamic simulations of sn explosions as described in detail in @xcite .",
    "[ snclumps ] illustrates an example of the slightly asymmetric supernova explosion of a @xmath20 star .",
    "the figure shows the distribution of the ejecta , color - coded by the average atomic weight , 1  yr after the sn explosion .",
    "it shows that most of the heavy elements are concentrated in dense clumps of angular size scale @xmath9  a few degrees , and are concentrated around @xmath21  cm at that time .    in the following",
    ", we will use the results the parameters of the supernova ejecta derived from this example to estimate the expected spatial distribution and , consequently , the expected time - dependent absorption features produced in pre - grb supernova ejecta in the he - merger and the supranova scenarios . for this purpose , we assume that the metal - rich , dense clumps are not decelerating significantly , so that their distance from the center of the explosion scales linearly with the sn - grb time delay @xmath22 .",
    "different grb progenitor models will then differ primarily by @xmath22 and by the amount of mass in the clumpy ejecta , @xmath23 , which might be correlated with the mass of the progenitor .",
    "we are thus interested in the location of model systems in the @xmath23-@xmath22 plane which are capable of reproducing the absorption feature seen in grb  990705 .",
    "as mentioned above , the directed velocity of clumps containing an overabundance of heavy elements , might be @xmath24  cm  s@xmath13 . according to the analysis of @xcite ,",
    "this would produce too narrow an absorption feature at a too low centroid energy , if the dominant absorption mechanism were resonance scattering out of the line of sight by hydrogen - like iron .",
    "for this reason , we will concentrate in the following on photoelectric absorption as the dominant absorption mechanism .",
    "as motivated above , we assume that most of the iron is concentrated in metal - rich clumps on angular scales of @xmath25  degrees , with @xmath26  5 , within which the average atomic weight @xmath27 may exceed @xmath28 .",
    "those clumps are filling a fraction @xmath29  % of the volume within a typical size scale of @xmath30  cm 1  yr after the supernova explosion . as a function of the time delay @xmath31  yr , between the sn explosion and the grb , the spatial distribution of clumps will extend out to @xmath32  cm . assuming that most of the clumps will be concentrated around @xmath33 , this yields a typical size scale of such clumps as @xmath34 . for a total supernova ejecta mass concentrated in clumps , @xmath35",
    ", we then find the average density of nuclei in the clumped ejecta to be @xmath36 we would then expect to have @xmath37 clouds located by chance along the line of sight towards the observer . if @xmath38 , we would thus expect to have several clouds overlapping along the line of sight , while for @xmath39 , this number would correspond to the probability @xmath40 of one cloud being located along the line of sight .",
    "the initial depth of the iron k absorption edge of clouds along the line of sight ( assuming that we have at least 1 cloud located within the line of sight ) will add up to @xmath41    the observation of @xmath42 during the first @xmath43  s of grb  990705 can be used to put parameter constraints on the progenitor of this grb . assuming that @xmath44 , this yields @xmath45 this relation is plotted for various ratios @xmath46 and @xmath47 by the solid curves in fig .",

    "solutions near the lower right corner of the diagram would require a very strong iron overabundance w.r.t . the standard solar - system value , and a small covering fraction of the absorber , implying a small chance probability of having an absorbing cloud in the line of sight to the observer .",
