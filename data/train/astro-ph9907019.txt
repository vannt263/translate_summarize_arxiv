    "searches for brown dwarfs are meeting with increasing success in recent years .",
    "proper - motion surveys ( ruiz et al .  1997 ) , surveys of young clusters ( stauffer et al .  1989 ; rebolo , zapatero - osorio , & martn 1995 ) , companion searches ( nakajima et al .",
    "1995 ) , radial velocity measurements ( mayor & queloz 1995 ; marcy & butler 1995 ) , and all - sky near - infrared and deep optical surveys ( delfosse et al .  1997 ; kirkpatrick et al .  1999 , hereafter k99 ) have identified an ever - growing number of confirmed substellar objects . until recently , gl 229b ( nakajima et al .",
    "1995 ) stood out amongst those objects as the only known brown dwarf sufficiently cool ( t@xmath7 = 960@xmath870 k , marley et al .",
    "1996 ) to show ch@xmath1 absorption bands at 1.6 and 2.2 @xmath9 .",
    "analysis of preliminary data from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; york et al .",
    "1999 ) has led to the discovery of the first field counterparts of gl 229b ( strauss et al .",
    "1999 ; tsvetanov et al .",
    "1999 ) .    in this letter , we report the discovery of an additional four spectroscopically - similar dwarfs , which we designate as spectral class `` t '' . while these objects have also been called `` methane '' dwarfs , we note that the 3.3 micron fundamental ch@xmath1 band is predicted to appear at higher temperatures , i.e. perhaps amongst the latest - type l dwarfs . ]",
    "( k99 ) , based on data from the two micron all - sky survey ( 2mass ; skrutskie et al .",
    "1997 ) ; and the recovery of a t dwarf identified by sdss .",
    "a brief summary of the selection process and initial follow - up of 2mass t candidates is discussed in @xmath102 ; near - infrared spectroscopy of the confirmed t dwarfs is discussed in @xmath103 ; and a preliminary sequence and estimates of t@xmath7 and the t dwarf space density are discussed in @xmath104 .",
    "results are summarized in @xmath105 .",
    "candidates were culled from two separate 2mass data samples .",
    "the first ( sample a ) , was taken from the 2mass spring 1999 data release , 2483 deg@xmath11 of northern hemisphere data containing approximately 20.2 million point sources .",
    "candidates were constrained to have detections at j and h bands with j @xmath5 16 ( 2mass signal - to - noise ratio @xmath4 10 limit ) , j - h @xmath5 0.3 and h - k@xmath12 @xmath5 0.3 , @xmath13 ( to eliminate source confusion in the plane ) , no minor planet correlations , and no optical counterparts ( usno - a : monet et al .",
    "1998 ) within 5@xmath14 .",
    "the adopted near - infrared colors select objects similar to or cooler than gl 229b , while excluding the overwhelming numbers of main sequence stars .",
    "note that this may exclude l / t transition objects ( 0.6 @xmath15 j - k@xmath12 @xmath15 2.1 ) , although the temperature range over which ch@xmath1 absorption causes this transition may be quite small ( reid et al .",
    "j- and h - band detections were required to exclude false sources , although a k@xmath12-band detection was not required because of decreased sensitivity at this wavelength non - detections are reported as limiting magnitudes ( no object detected at given coordinates to 95% confidence level ) . in this case , the h - k@xmath12 color limit is still required to be less than 0.3 magnitude . ] ( 2mass 99.9% completeness limit is k@xmath16 14.3 ) .",
    "non - detections on poss - i ( minkowski & abell 1963 ) are imposed because these objects have extremely red optical - infrared colors ( gl 229b r - j @xmath17 9 , golimowski et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "the second set",
    "( sample b ) was taken from 3420 deg@xmath11 ( @xmath17 28 million point sources ) of northern and southern hemisphere data , with search criteria of j - h @xmath5 0.2 and h - k@xmath12 @xmath5 0.2 , j @xmath5 16 , @xmath18 , no minor planet correlations , and no poss - i or poss - ii ( reid et al .",
    "1991 ) detections .",
    "again , sources were required to have j- and h - band detections but not required to have k@xmath12-band detections .",
    "the search criteria selected 349 candidates from sample a and 319 candidates from sample b. subsequent inspection of poss and 2mass data to rule out faint optical sources ( background stars ) and high proper motion stars eliminated all but 12 candidates from sample a and all but 11 from sample b. three candidates from sample a and five from sample b were accessible for observation in may , and are listed in table 1 , which gives the object name ( col .",
    "[ 1 ] ) , sample ( col . [ 2 ] ) , and 2mass j- , h- , and k@xmath12-band photometry ( cols .",
    "[ 3]-[5 ] ) .",
    "the two samples are spatially distinct , and can be considered complete in the region of sky observable during our investigation , 548 deg@xmath11 in sample a and 1236 deg@xmath11 in sample b.    one additional object , 2mass j1225 - 27 , which was previously identified as a t dwarf candidate ( burgasser et al .  1998 ) , but is not a member of either sample , was also included in our follow - up and is listed in table 1 .      the largest source of contamination among our t candidates is uncatalogued minor planets ( burgasser et al .  1998 ; k99 ) , which have blue near - infrared colors ( j - k@xmath16 0.3 , veeder et al .  1995 ; sykes et al .  1999 ) and will not match a poss - i or -ii source because of motion . while catalogued minor planets are flagged by the 2mass processing pipeline , uncatalogued minor planets remain , and re - imaging is required to eliminate them from the candidate pool",
    ".    eighty - minute z@xmath19 band ( fukugita et al .  1997 ) exposures were obtained for two candidates , 2mass j1217 - 03 and 2mass j1237 + 65 , using the usno flagstaff 1.55 m tek2k camera on 1999 may 19 ( ut ) .",
    "the remaining targets in table 1 were imaged at k - band using the keck i near infrared camera ( nirc ; matthews & soifer 1994 ) on 1999 may 27 ( ut ) .",
    "results from these reimaging campaigns are summarized in table 1 , columns ( 6)-(8 ) . in total ,",
    "five of nine objects were confirmed at their expected positions .",
    "2mass j - band images of the new confirmed candidates are shown in figure 1 .",
    "designated names ( col .",
    "[ 1 ] ) , 2mass j magnitudes and j - h , h - k@xmath12 , and j - k@xmath12 colors ( cols .",
    "[ 2]-[5 ] ) , and estimated distances ( col .",
    "[ 6 ] ) are listed in table 2 .",
    "an initial identifying optical ( 8000 - 11000  ) spectrum for 2mass j1237 + 65 was obtained from the palomar 200 ",
    "double spectrograph ( oke & gunn 1982 ) on 1999 may 24 ( burgasser et al .  1999 ) . the data identified this object as very cool , as it is similar in appearance to the optical spectrum of gl 229b ( oppenheimer et al .",
    "1998 ) , though quite noisy due to the exceedingly faint signal .",
    "all confirmed candidates were then spectroscopically observed in the near - infrared using the keck i nirc grism on 1999 may 27 - 28 ( ut ) .",
    "a 120 line / mm grism with the hk order sorting filter was employed , for first order resolution @xmath20 ; wavelength resolution was 60  / pixel .",
    "each target was imaged with nirc in camera mode and then placed into either a 0@xmath2152 ( for 2mass j1217 - 03 , j1225 - 27 , and j1237 + 65 ) or 0@xmath2138 ( for 2mass j1047 + 21 and j1346 - 00 ) wide slit .",
    "total integration times of 1000s were divided into five 200s exposures with 5@xmath14 on - slit dithers between exposures .",
    "the spectra were then pairwise subtracted to remove sky background , and each spectrum extracted separately .",
    "flat - fielding was performed by obtaining a spectrum of a diffusely illuminated dome spot with identical instrumental settings .",
    "each target spectrum was divided by a spectrum of a nearby sao f star to correct for telluric absorption , and photometric standards were observed for flux calibrations .",
    "individual exposures for each object were then averaged into a single , final spectrum .    reduced spectra for all new 2mass t dwarfs are shown in figure 2 , along with gl 229b ( leggett et al .",
    "all but one of the objects , 2mass j1225 - 27 , were saturated at the h - band peak , resulting in a false `` absorption '' feature at 1.58 @xmath9 .",
    "the region of saturation was at most 3 pixels wide .",
    "an extrapolation of each saturated h - band peak using the 2mass j1225 - 27 spectrum is indicated by a dotted line ; each spectrum is normalized to this revised h - band peak .",
    "the 1.6 and 2.2 @xmath0 methane bands are quite obvious in all of the confirmed candidates , identifying all as t dwarfs .",
    "broadened h@xmath3o absorption bands shortward of 1.5 and 2.05 @xmath0 are also evident , consistent with those found in gl 299b ( oppenheimer et al./ 1995 ) .",
    "the 2.3 @xmath0 co band seen in the l dwarfs ( k99 ) is either overwhelmed by ch@xmath1 absorption or absent in the t dwarfs .",
    "the spectra show significant variation in the ratio between the flux at 2.1 and 1.55 @xmath9 .",
    "as figure 2 indicates , the 2.1 @xmath9 peak flattens from 2mass j1217 - 03 down to 2mass j1237 + 65 .",
    "in contrast , there is an apparent steepening in the core of the 1.6 @xmath9 ch@xmath1 band , which is flat for 2mass j1217 - 03 , but decreases from 1.6 to 1.8 @xmath9 for 2mass j1225 - 27 , j1047 + 21 , and j1237 + 65 .",
    "according to burrows et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , the dominant form of molecular carbon switches from co to ch@xmath1 at t@xmath22 1300 k. h@xmath3o vapor bands , which have a profound influence on the near - infrared spectra of m ( jones et al .  1994 ) and l ( delfosse et al .",
    "1997 ) dwarfs , are also expected to be strong in t dwarfs . as tokunaga & kobayashi ( 1999 )",
    "have shown , h@xmath3 collision - induced absorption ( cia ) has a marked influence on the latest l dwarfs , noticeably depressing the spectrum in a broad region around 2.2 @xmath9 .",
    "this has also been seen in the reflectance spectrum of jupiter ( danielson 1966 ) .",
    "for the lower t@xmath7 s of t dwarfs , h@xmath3 is expected to play a more dominant role .",
    "thus , for t@xmath23 1300 k , the major absorbers in the near - infrared ( jhk ) spectra are ch@xmath1 , h@xmath3o , and h@xmath3 .",
    "since cia affects the k band more strongly than the h band , particularly toward lower temperatures , the ratio of the flux at h to that at k should increase with cooler effective temperatures .",
    "this reasoning is the basis of our preliminary spectral sequence as displayed in figure 2 : 2mass j1217 - 03 , j1225 - 27 , j1047 + 21 , j1237 + 65 , and gl 229b .",
    "the j band is even less influenced by cia and little influenced by ch@xmath1 , so that the same argument should also hold true for j - k@xmath12 ; that is , we expect that cooler t dwarfs also have bluer j - k@xmath12 colors .",
    "four of the five objects were not detected at k@xmath12 by 2mass , however , so these color relations require further observational investigation .    if we assume that these dwarfs have 8.5 @xmath5 log ( age , gyr ) @xmath5 9.5 , typical of isolated field objects , then based on the observed colors and the assumption that all of the objects are warmer than gl 229b , the 2mass t dwarfs are likely to have 950 @xmath5 t@xmath7 @xmath5 1300 k ( see figure 9 of burrows et al .",
    "it must be stressed that this is a preliminary assessment of the temperatures of these objects , and no consideration for other spectral influences such as metallicity and gravity have been made .",
    "better t@xmath7 estimates of these t dwarfs will require model fitting of their spectra from the far optical through the near - infrared .",
    "this analysis will be left to a future paper .      as indicated in table 2 ,",
    "objects appear to lie within the j - h @xmath5 0.2 and h - k@xmath24 0.2 color region specified for sample b , even 2mass j1047 + 21 , which was selected from a slightly broader color cut .",
    "if we assume that these colors are typical for all methane dwarfs , then we can make a preliminary assessment of the warm ( 900 @xmath5 t@xmath25 1300 k ) t dwarf space density . with one detection in 548 deg@xmath11 of sample",
    "a and three detections in 1236 deg@xmath11 of sample b , we obtain a mean surface density of 0.0022 t dwarfs deg@xmath26 , or 90 warm t dwarfs observable over the entire sky with j @xmath5 16 . if we make the simplifying assumption that all four confirmed t dwarfs in our sample have the same luminosity as gl 229b , then this j - band limit corresponds to a distance limit of @xmath27 13 pc , and thus a space density of @xmath17 0.01 warm t dwarfs pc@xmath28 . this value should be considered an upper limit , as the warmer t dwarfs likely sample beyond 13 pc .",
    "it is nonetheless comparable to the l dwarf density of 0.007 l dwarfs pc@xmath28 computed by k99 .",
    "comparison with the simulations of reid et al .",
    "( 1999 ) suggests a mass function @xmath29 in the t dwarf regime , comparable to the relation for local late m dwarf stars ( reid et al .",
    "we have identified four new t dwarfs and one previously discovered t dwarf in 1784 deg@xmath11 of 2mass survey data . these objects all show the hallmark 1.6 and 2.2 @xmath9 ch@xmath1 absorption bands that are characteristic of objects with t@xmath2 1300 k. they show some variation in their h- to k - band flux ratios , likely due to the combined absorption of ch@xmath1 , h@xmath3o , and h@xmath3 .",
    "this allows us to make a preliminary attempt at a t dwarf spectral sequence .",
    "we determine a proemial space density estimate of @xmath30 0.01 warm t dwarfs pc@xmath28 , comparable to the l dwarf density from k99 .    a.  j.  b.  would like to thank tom geballe and sandy leggett for the use of their recalibrated gl 229b ukirt spectrum , ben oppenheimer for his valuable comments , albert burgasser for consultation on a t dwarf search database , and especially the 2mass staff and scientists for their support and for pointing their telescopes in the right directions .",
