    "new clues are emerging that long grb are associated with supernovae @xcite .",
    "this is illustrated most recently by optical emissions lines in the late - time light - curve of the hete - ii burst grb 030329 @xcite , which are remarkably similar to those observed in grb980425/sn1998bw @xcite .",
    "a grb - supernova assocation provides important support for the collapsar model of grbs , representing a violent death of evolved massive stars @xcite .",
    "the short lifespan of tens of myrs of massive stars implies that grbs take place in star - forming regions @xcite , and hence more broadly points towards an association to molecular clouds .",
    "the event rate of grbs per unit cosmological volume is hereby expected to be correlated to the cosmic star - formation rate ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "because observations by past and current experiments ( see table i ) are flux - limited , the observed grb - event rate is strongly biased towards events at lower redshifts .    in this letter",
    ", we calculate the ratio @xmath2 of unseen - to - observed grbs .",
    "our analysis is based on the bias in the observed grb - event rate towards low redshift events in a flux - limited sample of 33 grbs with individually measured redshifts .",
    "we propose to use a linear relationship for the correlation between the true - but - unseen grb event rate and the cosmic sfr , to derive from this bias a best - fit log - normal grb peak - luminosity function .",
    "while it is an open question to what the degree cosmological evolution of metallicity affects the sfr independently of the grb event rate ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , linear relationship between the two will serve as a leading - order approximation .    in  2",
    ", we discuss the cosmological model .",
    " 3 tabulates the current sample of 33 grbs with individually measured redshifts . in  4 , we present the best fit of the data for a log - normal distribution function , estimate the fraction of unseen - to - observed grbs , and compare our results with the beaming factor @xmath3 of frail et al.(2001 ) , based on a sample of grbs with achromatic breaks in their light - curves .",
    "we summarize our results and draw our main conclusions in  5 .",
    "we model the intrinsic grb - event rate in a flat @xmath4-dominated cold dark matter cosmology with closure energy densities @xmath5 = 0.70 and @xmath6 = 0.30 .",
    "these values are suggested by boomerang and maxima @xcite on the power spectra of the cmb and distant type ia sne @xcite .",
    "the hubble parameter h@xmath7 is taken to be @xmath8 ( freedman et al . , 2001 ) .",
    "@xcite provide three models of the cosmic sfr up to redshifts @xmath9 , reflecting some uncertainties in sfr estimates .",
    "no significant changes have been noticed in application of these three models , and we present only results derived from the second model , sfr2 .",
    "we have @xmath10 by transformation of the @xmath11 in a matter - dominated unverse ( @xmath12 ) , @xmath13 where @xmath14^{1/2}$ ] .    for a grb - event rate locked to the sfr",
    ", the true event rate between @xmath15 and @xmath16 , as observed in the observer s frame of reference , satisfies @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the formation mass fraction of the source progenitors . here , the division by @xmath19 accounts for time - dilatation by cosmic expansion .",
    "the element of comoving volume is @xmath20 the grb redshift probability density can be written as @xcite @xmath21 assuming that the mass fraction of grbs progenitors is redshift independent , the scaling factor @xmath22 is the only free parameter of our model . for the flux - limited experiments listed in table",
    "i we define a probability - density function of detection as a function of redshift as @xmath23 where the dependence on the luminosity has been integrated out in the detected event rate @xcite @xmath24 here , @xmath25 refers to the intrinsic grbs luminosity function in the batse energy range @xmath26 kev .",
    "the luminosity threshold as a function of redshift is given by @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the luminosity distance to a source at redshift @xmath15 and where @xmath29 denotes the sensitivity threshold of the instrument .",
    "following @xcite , we take a flux - density threshold of baste of 0.2 @xmath30 .",
    "as of the time of this writing , we have 33 grbs with individually measured redshifts ( table i ) .",
    "they collectively represent a variety of past and current experiments . due to a flux threshold in each of the instruments used , the observed grb redshift distribution is strongly biased towards low redshifts .",
    "this introduces a quantitative selection effect , relative to the redshift distribution predicted by the sfr model ( fig .",
    "1 )  the true distribution of grb - redshifts representing what would be observed in the ideal case of a zero - flux threshold in the instruments . in view of the various instruments involved ,",
    "the dependency of the observed grb redhift - distribution function on the flux - limit is simulated in fig .",
    "we shall assume that the grb - luminosity function is redshift independent , i.e. , without cosmological evolution of the nature of its progenitors .",
    "we take a log - normal probability density for the luminosity shape - function , with mean @xmath31 and width @xmath32 given by @xmath33 where @xmath34 is normalized with respect to 1@xmath35s@xmath36 .",
    "the optimized parameters of our model are @xmath37 this notation means that the estimated parameters can be either ( 122,3.4 ) , ( 123,3.2 ) , ( 125,2.8 ) , or ( 126,2.6 ) , but not ( 122,2.6 ) for instance .",
    "our results are compatible to the expectations of sethi et bhargavi ( 2001 ) who derive a log - normal luminosity function with @xmath38 and @xmath39 from a different flux - limited sample .",
    "they mentioned that because of selection effects , the inferred average luminosity over - estimates the true mean luminosity by a factor of 2 or 3 , and the variance is within 40 - 50% of the true variance .",
    "the observed and predicted redshift distribution , based on the sfr , are shown in fig . 1 in case of optimal parameters ( [ eqn_par ] ) .",
    "the results indicate a good fit to the data , suggesting that selection effects are adequaly modeled .",
    "the fraction of _ detectable _ grbs as a function of redshift @xmath40 shows a the steep decrease as the luminosity threshold increases , making high - redshift grbs less likely to be detected .",
    "a satisfactory test for our model is provided by comparing the predicted flux distribution of grbs above the sensitivity threshold with the peak flux distribution of a sample of 67 grbs observed with ipn ( fig .",
    "the fluxes derived from our luminosity function in 50 - 300 kev have been extrapolated to the ipn range of 25 - 100 kev , assuming an @xmath41 energy spectrum and using the formula given in appendix b of sethi et bhargavi ( 2001 ) .",
    "the conversion factor from @xmath42 to @xmath30 has been taken to be @xmath43 , and the sensitivity threshold equal to 5 @xmath30 ( hurley , private communication ) .",
    "a quantitative result provided by our model is the ratio @xmath2 of the true grb - event rate ( what would be seen in case of a zero - flux limit in the detector ) and the observed grb - event rate . for the optimal parameters ( [ eqn_par ] )",
    ", we have @xmath44 the factor @xmath2 is between 200 - 1200 in the error box of ( [ eqn_par ] ) .",
    "our estimate of the true - to - observed grb - event rate @xmath2 is strikingly similar to the grb - beaming factor @xmath45 of about 500 derived by frail et al .",
    "our analysis is independent of the mechanism providing a broad distribution in grb luminosities . without further input",
    ", our results may reflect ( a ) isotropic sources with greatly varying energy output , ( b ) beamed sources with standard energy output and varying opening angles , or ( c ) anisotropic but geometrically standard sources @xcite .",
    "we find that the grb peak - luminosities and beaming are correlated .",
    "to see this , we simply note that the case of no correlation between peak - luminosities and beaming give rise to an unseen - but - true grb event rate which is @xmath46 times the observed rate .",
    "the true grb - event rate hereby approaches that of type ii supernovae  we discard this possibility .",
    "a correlation between peak - luminosities and beaming is naturally expected sources ( b ) and ( c ) with standard energy output  the picture that bears out of @xcite .",
    "this introduces a correlation @xmath47 between peak - luminosity and beaming factor in ( b ) and , for a flux - limited sample , also in ( c ) . for a flux - limited sample , both ( b ) and ( c )",
    "give rise to an anticorrelation between inferred beaming and distance such that to leading - order @xmath48const .",
    "4 shows that this anticorrelation holds in the sample of @xcite . for a related discussion on estimating the grb beaming factor from flux limited surveys , see @xcite",
    "a table of 33 grbs with individually determined redshifts allows an estimate of the grb - luminosity function , based on constant of proportionality between the grb event rate and the cosmic star - formation rate .",
    "we have tested our fit by reproducing the distribution of peak luminosities in the ipn sample of 67 grbs .",
    "a flux - limited sample introduces a ratio @xmath2 of unseen grbs , whose emissions fall below the detector threshold , to observed grbs .",
    "a best fit analysis of the luminosity function gives @xmath0 .",
    "this number is both large and close to the grb beaming factor of 500 .",
    "the possibility that @xmath2 and @xmath45 are uncorrelated gives rise to prohibitively large true grb event rates , and is discarded .",
    "the results support a relation @xmath47 between the peak - luminosity and the beaming factor in the context of conical or anisotropic grb - emissions with standard grb - energies .",
    "this points towards an anticorrelation between distance and half - opening angle , which is approximately supported by the sample of @xcite .",
    "the results presented here and those of @xcite indicate a true grb event rate of 1 per year within @xmath49mpc .",
    "grb980425/sn1998bw ( @xmath50 ) is consistent with this true event rate . for anisotropic but geometrically standard sources , grb980425 is hereby _ not _ anomalous , but consistent with the trend shown in fig .",
