    "goudsmit and uhlenbeck discovered electron spin in 1925 , while trying to find out what causes very close parallel lines to appear in the optical spectrum of hydrogen .",
    "they were able to show that these lines could be due to the fact that the electron possesses a natural angular impulse and bipolar magnetic momentum , whose component must be equal to @xmath1 or @xmath8 .    when describing the circumstances of the discovery , uhlenbeck commented that both he and goudsmit imagined that the electron would be configured as a sphere in permanent rotation , but that they realised that , given the mass of the electron a spin momentum of @xmath1 would require the tangential velocity at its equator to be many times the speed of light .",
    "two years later , the experiments of phipps and taylor showed clearly that the electron does in fact possess a natural angular impulse , @xmath9 , whose value is @xmath1 , and soon after , dirac used schrdinger s equation while substituting the classic equation @xmath10 by its relativistic form @xmath11 , to show that the electron must have a spin of @xmath12 .",

    "nernst suggested that the quantic fluctuations of space must cause an electromagnetic radiation which would therefore be inherent to space and , consequently , have a relativistically invariant spectrum .    in 1958",
    "sparnaay found this radiation when he was measuring the casimir effect at temperatures close to absolute zero .",
    "he detected some radiation , which was independent of temperature and whose spectrum was such that the intensities of its flows are inversely proportional to the cubes of the wavelengths , which is a necessary condition for the radiation to be relativistically invariant . in 1997 , s.k .",
    "lamoreaux carried out new measurements of the intensity of the energy flow of zero - point radiation , using a different method , and reached the same measurements as sparnaay s .",
    "a function of spectral distribution which is inversely proportional to the cubes of the wavelengths implies a distribution of energies which is inversely proportional to the @xmath13 power of the wavelengths , because the energies of the photons are inversely proportional to their wavelengths . in 1969 , timothy h. boyer showed that the spectral density function of zero - point radiation is : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the number giving the measurement of the wavelength @xmath16 .",

    "they move at the speed of light along rectilinear trajectories . these are geodesic lines , in a space without curvature . within the space defined by the 3-dimensional spherical surface @xmath46 , the geodesic lines are great circles , but in the case of our universe",

    "our aim , to investigate possible configurations of photons , implies that it is preferable to characterise them according to their wavelength @xmath16 .",
    "all photons of wavelength @xmath16 are identical .",
    "we must make a brief digression here .",
    "the wave - motion of photons is very different from that of the waves of the sea . except where they break",

    "we will now analyse the following suggested configuration for photons :    the substance of the photons undulates along cylindrical helices , in such a way that the advance of one wavelength along its rectilinear trajectory is accompanied by an advance of an equal distance over a circumference of radius @xmath54 , having its centre on the said trajectory , and situated on a plane perpendicular to it , so that for every complete rotation over that circumference , there will be an advance of one wavelength over the rectilinear trajectory .    *     to help the analysis of the suggested configuration , there are shown in fig .",
    "1 the projections over the planes @xmath55 and @xmath56 of a cylindrical helix , whose equations are : @xmath57 z = r\\sin\\left(\\que xr\\right)\\\\ \\\\[-8pt ] y = r\\cos\\left(\\que xr\\right)\\end{array}\\right\\}\\eqno{(5)}\\ ] ]    during the time elapsed between @xmath58 and @xmath59 , the point on the helix has advanced a distance of @xmath60 along the axis @xmath61 , and has made one complete rotation around that axis , which presupposes a journey of @xmath60 over the circumference of the projection on the plane @xmath56 . both during this journey and during that over @xmath61 , the velocity has been @xmath39 ( obviously , these speeds are not to be added together , but seen as independent of each other )",
    ".    the advance of @xmath62 over the axis @xmath61 , i.e. one wavelength , @xmath16 , is matched by a length of the helix traced over the cylinder of rotation with a radius of @xmath63 , which is given by @xmath64 @xmath65    the length of the cylindrical helix corresponding to a distance of one wavelength is equal to @xmath66 .",
    "seeing that electromagnetic wave - motion must run over a cylindrical rotational surface , it must do so following a cylindrical helix , since for cylinders , whether rotational or not , their helices are their geodesic lines .",
    "for every distance of one wavelength , @xmath16 , along @xmath61 , there can be only one corresponding photon .",
    "a photon whose energy is equal to @xmath67 ( the energy equivalent of the mass of the electron ) has a wavelength of @xmath68 , to which there corresponds @xmath69 , and its spin momentum will be @xmath70 which is the right value for photons .",
    "in order to develop the hypothesis proposed in this paper , it will be better to limit ourselves initially to considering the electron , and then move on to the remaining elementary particles .",
    "the basic suppositions for all of them are the following :    1 .   the transformation of a photon into a particle does not require any change in its substance , but only a change in the organisation of that same substance .",
    "it continues to be the same  packet of energy with @xmath71 quantity of action \"  which , instead of moving lineally and forming part of a train of waves moving at the speed of light , has turned round on itself to  bite its tail \" , creating an isolated entity rotating in such a way that at any point on it , the tangential velocity is @xmath39 .",
    "2 .   the photon does not lose its essentially linear nature in favour of a spherical surface .",
    "what happens is that it rolls itself around a sphere of radius @xmath47 , in such a way that during the period @xmath72 it makes the journey of @xmath73 around the great circle @xmath74 of radius @xmath47 , which meanwhile completes a rotation of @xmath75 radians around the axis @xmath76 ( see fig .",
    "2 ) . at the end of the said period @xmath72 ,",

    "the journey over the great circle is equivalent to the photon s journey over @xmath86 in fig .",
    "1 . both have a length of @xmath62 , and neither of them generates angular momentum . during its journey over the great circle ,",
    "the angular momentum would follow a diameter at the equator . however when",
    "it has completed a rotation around every point on the equator , it will be balanced by its opposite going in a contrary direction so that the sum of the two is zero .",
    "the rotation around @xmath83 generates at every point a momentum determined by the tangential velocity @xmath87 and by the radius @xmath88 . in other words : @xmath89 where the value @xmath90 is determined by the equal distribution of the energy of the photon in a journey of @xmath91 radians",
    ". therefore we arrive at : @xmath92 for @xmath93 ,  @xmath94 .    from equations ( 6 ) we obtain : @xmath95 dy = r(\\cos^2\\va-\\sin^2\\va)d\\va = r\\cos2\\va\\,d\\va\\\\[+4pt ] dz = r\\cos\\va\\,d\\va\\end{array}\\ ] ]    therefore , @xmath96 , whence @xmath97 and , finally : @xmath98 which is somewhat greater than the distance travelled along the great circle between @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",

    "the radius of the electron is @xmath24 and its circumference @xmath105 .",
    "therefore a `` rolling up '' of @xmath106 would mean making @xmath107 turns around a circumference of radius @xmath24 , i.e. a length of @xmath108 , which would be covered in a period of @xmath109 if a speed of @xmath39 is maintained .",

    "the energy @xmath67 will be distributed equally over the length of the wavelength @xmath112 , so that the value of the spin momentum will still be @xmath1 .",
    "if at any time the `` rolling - up '' should come undone while the `` tail - biting '' remains , centrifugal force would cause it to change into a circumference of radius @xmath113 , rotating at the same tangential velocity @xmath39 and generating the angular momentum @xmath0 .    a great circle of radius @xmath24 , making one turn around the axis @xmath76 every @xmath114",

    "deduced that if it were configured as a spherical surface , the radius of that surface would have to be greater than that of an entire hydrogen atom ; otherwise , the tangential velocity at its equator would have to be much greater than that of light .",
    "this is perhaps the only possible experimental support for the conjectural `` rolling - up '' of the wavelength @xmath106 around the sphere of radius @xmath3 and the wave equations ( 5 ) , with @xmath111 instead of @xmath69 .    the value of @xmath110 , which implies the reduction of scale between the world of electromagnetic waves and the world of particles possessing mass , is due to the interaction of the latter particles with zero - point radiation which , thanks to the compton effect , compresses them until equilibrium is reached with electrostatic repulsion , which in the case of the electron happens when @xmath111 .    for the photon which has an energy equal to @xmath67",

    "the fine structure constant @xmath110 , the wavelength @xmath20 of the most energetic photon and the speed of the light , @xmath39 , are three fundamental and invariable physical entities which modulate the architecture of our universe .",
    "the suggested configuration implies that the whole of the substance of the photon transformed into an electron maintains its coherence , and revolves around the centre of the sphere of radius @xmath24 , over whose surface it moves , in such a way that the tangential velocity at all its points is equal to that of the original photon , i.e. that of light .",
    "the `` energy packet '' of dimensions @xmath122 , which in the configuration described here revolves as a single entity around a point , from which all its substance is distant by @xmath24 , in such a way that its tangential velocity is always @xmath39 , implies a mass of @xmath123 and a centrifugal force of @xmath124 .",
    "this force is exactly equal to that of the electrostatic repulsion of the electron s charge against itself on the surface of the particle , i.e. to : @xmath125    the equivalence just stated leads us to suggest that the electrostatic field determined by the electron s charge , could proceed from the interaction between the centrifugal force inherent to its spin and zero - point radiation [ 2 ] .",
