    "the statistical properties of galaxy clusters ( shape , structures , size , temperature , mass ) depend strongly on the geometry of the universe .",
    "their study provides some robust constraints on cosmological models , structure formations and evolution @xcite .",
    "this strong coupling makes the study of massive and distant clusters a very useful tool for cosmology .",
    "the intergalactic gas component can be observed through its bremsstrahlung emission at x - ray wavelengths .",
    "it can also be detected from submillimeter to radio wavelengths via the sunyaev - zeldovich effect @xcite . whereas the x - ray emission depends on the square of the gas density , the sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz hereafter ) effect is linearly dependent on this quantity .",
    "for this reason , the sz effect is proportional to the column density and thus to the line of sight integrated gas mass .",
    "moreover the sz signal does not suffer from the brightness decrease of the radiations ( in particular the x - ray one ) due to the expansion of the universe ( see a review by @xcite ) .",
    "the rxj1347 - 1145 cluster is known as the most luminous x - ray cluster to date .",
    "it has been detected in the rosat all sky survey and furthermore studied with the rosat - hri and the asca - gis2 instruments @xcite . with an intrinsic bolometric x - ray luminosity of @xmath8 , it shows a very peaked x - ray emission profile with an angular core radius of @xmath9  .",
    "it also presents a very strong cooling flow in its central region , with a corresponding accreting rate of @xmath10m@xmath1/yr .",
    "it is a distant cluster with @xmath11 , so that the angular distance is @xmath12mpc ( 490pc / arcmin , with @xmath13km / s / mpc , @xmath5 , @xmath6 ; 410pc / arcmin in a standard cdm model ) .",
    "the value of the core radius with these two sets of cosmological parameters is respectively equal to 68kpc ( @xmath14cmd model ) and to 57kpc ( standard cdm model ) .",
    "the total binding mass derived from the x - ray data within 1mpc is @xmath15m@xmath1 .",
    "this value has to be compared to those obtained from the optical gravitational lensing follow - up achieved by @xcite and @xcite . within the same radius ,",
    "they provide a value of @xmath16m@xmath1 @xcite .    in a previous paper , we have reported the detection of a very strong sz effect in the direction of rxj1347 - 1145 with the diabolo photometer @xcite .",
    "we have presented a map of the cluster central region ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "the corresponding comptonization parameter was @xmath18 ( 1@xmath19 error bars ) . during the 1999 diabolo run",
    ", we performed an extended mapping of rxj1347 - 1145 over a 4 by 4 field .",
    "the size of the first map was rather small so that only 1d average slice was used to compare with the x - ray data . here",
    "the size of the map allows to make full use of 2d information on the cluster .",
    "moreover , the computation of a cluster radial profile from a 2d map allows to discard most of the effects induced by point sources .    in this paper",
    ", we present the resulting extended map of this cluster at 2.1 mm . in a first part",

    "the diabolo instrument is a dual channel photometer working at 1.2 and 2.1 mm .",
    "the detectors are bolometers cooled down to 0.1k using an open cycle @xmath20he-@xmath21he dilution refrigerator @xcite .",
    "two thermometers associated to a heater and a pid digital control system are used to regulate the temperature of the 0.1k plate .",
    "there are three adjacent bolometers per channel , arranged in an equilateral triangle at the focus of the telescope . for a given channel ,",
    "each bolometer is coaligned with one bolometer of the second channel , both looking toward the same sky direction . for the observations presented here ,",
    "diabolo was installed at the focus of the iram 30 meter radio telescope at pico veleta ( spain ) .",
    "this configuration allows us to achieve a 22  resolution at 2.1 mm .",
    "the 30 meter telescope focus being of nasmyth type , the rotation of the field has to be taken into account in the sky maps reconstruction . @xcite",
    "have described the experimental setup and reported the first diabolo sz detections .",
    "rxj1347 - 1145 has been observed in january 1999 for a total integration time of 17 hours .",
    "the x - ray emission center : @xmath22 , @xmath23 @xcite , has been taken as the map center . each sequence of observation has been performed in the right ascension coordinates , using the earth rotation as right ascension drift such that the telescope is kept fixed in local coordinates .",
    "the basic observation sequence was a @xmath24 map in right ascension - declination coordinates , with a 10  declination steps .",
    "the wobbling secondary mirror of the 30 m iram telescope has been used at a frequency of 1hz and with a modulation amplitude of 150  .",
    "the wobbling is horizontal ( eg : at constant elevation ) , thus not aligned with the scanning direction . in order to remove systematic signal drifts that are produced by the antenna environment",
    ", we used alternatively the positive and negative beam to map the cluster .",
    "we have produced 89 such maps .",
    "the data processing includes all the different steps described by @xcite .",
    "this includes a correction from the cosmic - rays impacts , a synchronous demodulation of the signal , a subtraction of the atmospheric signal correlated between the two channels , a correction from the atmosphere opacity , a reprojection of each single observation on a final ra - dec grid , a baseline subtraction supported by the edges of the map and the computation of a final map at 1.2 and 2.1 mm by coadding the 3 bolometers of each channel .",
    "the beam modulation is performed with an amplitude of 150  , so that some of the `` off '' positions lie within the limit of our map .",
    "consequently , the beam switching has to be taken into account in the data analysis ( see sec .",
    "[ szsignal ] ) .    throughout the run",
    ", the pointing verifications have been performed in the direction of qsos lying at about the same declination as the cluster .",
    "the planet mars has been used as a calibration target and to map the beam pattern .",
    "assuming mars is a point source with respect to the diabolo s beam ( angular diameter around 5  in january 1999 ) , the accuracy in the absolute calibration is better than 20% at 1.2 mm and 15% at 2.1 mm .",
    "mars has directly been mapped in right ascension - declination during this run .",
    "this method provides a direct view of the beam shape including eventual systematic effect as the beam elongation in the right - ascension direction due to the conjugated effects of the scanning drift speed and the bolometer time constant .",
    "the reduced map for rxj1347 - 1145 at 2.1 mm is shown on fig .",
    "it has been smoothed using a gaussian filter with 20  fwhm .",
    "the contours overplotted correspond to 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 and 5 @xmath19 detection levels ( negative and positive contours are respectively drawn with solid and dashed lines ) .",
    "the noise level on this map is 1mjy / beam in a @xmath25 pixel ( equivalent to 0.5mjy / beam in the 22  diabolo beam and to 0.3mjy / beam ( equivalent to @xmath26 ) in the 30  fwhm effective beam after smoothing ) .",
    "this map exhibits a strong and extended sz decrement in the direction of the cluster .",
    "unfortunately , the diabolo 1.2 mm data are very noisy .",
    "no positive sz signal could be extract from them .",
    "we used them to subtract most of the atmospheric emission from the 2.1 mm data .",
    "the signal does not seem to follow a symmetric circular distribution as expected from the x - ray data and from the commonly used @xmath27-model .",
    "the first look at the map argues in favor of substructure in the signal , and so far , in the gas distribution .",
    "the x - ray map has been overplotted on the sz map ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1]c ) .",
    "it has been computed from the whole rosat / hri observations ( 35ks exposure time ) obtained from the rosat database ( the map published by @xcite included only a third of those data ) .",
    "as the sz signal is linearly dependent of the gas density ( scaled with @xmath28 ) , the x - ray emission is dominated by contributions from regions of higher density ( scaled with @xmath29 ) .",
    "furthermore , the x - ray and sz signals are not sensitive to the same part of the gas .",
    "what appears as differences between the sz and the x - ray spatial distributions could be associated to different gas phases with various physical states ( density , pressure , temperature ) . in the following",
    ", we will compare in detail the measured sz map to the expected sz distribution deduced from the symmetrical cluster x - ray model",

    ", we can compute the comptonization parameter expected toward the cluster center : @xmath36 . following this approach , we used a @xmath27-model to describe our sz signal . because of the circular symmetry induced on the projected sky by this kind of model",
    ", we chose to test different @xmath27-models on the radial profile resulting from our 2.1 mm map ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) . to model the sz signal , we have taken into account the integration of the sz spectrum on the diabolo passbands and the integration of the gas distribution over the diabolo beam shape . to perform a rigorous fit of the diabolo data ,",
    "we need to take into account in the model every step of the observing procedure and of the data reduction procedure .",
    "so whatever the model we used , we considered it as a real sky and we reproduced on it all the diabolo s observations performed in the direction of rxj1347 - 1147 .",
    "( this includes the wobbling positions and amplitudes . ) .",
    "the resulting simulated data set of observations has been reduced in the same way as the real dataset by following all steps of the diabolo pipeline ( demodulation , base line subtraction , reprojection , ... see sec  [ red ] ) .",
    "the resulting model for the flux of the sz decrement per beam can be expressed as follow :    @xmath37    where @xmath38 , is the comptonization parameter towards the cluster center ( @xmath39 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath40 the electron mass and @xmath41 the speed of light .",

    "has been fixed to the x - ray value of 0.56 in models @xmath59 and @xmath64 .",
    "unfortunately , in those two cases the core radius can also not be constraint precisely .",
    "its determination suffers from a degeneracy and despite of the extent of our sz map , we are not able to discriminate between a small and a high core radius model .",
    "this is due to the way we have defined the zero level : a baseline subtraction in the ra direction fitted to 60% of the data point per line 30% on each edge ) .",
    "this operation is needed to eliminate the low - frequency detector noises . consequently , whatever the model is , the cluster extension is cut off by the baseline subtraction and the signal to noise ratio does not allow to make the difference between small and large core radius . for this reason",

    "we have also propagated the uncertainty on the x - ray parameter determination through the whole pipeline of the data analysis .",
    "the extra 1@xmath19 errors are @xmath70 and @xmath71mjy . because we just use the information on the x - ray temperature to fix the exact shape of the sz spectra ( a second order effect ) , the extra errors induced by the temperature uncertainty",
    "is marginally significant .",
    "the most important difference is driven by the core radius and by the @xmath27 parameters uncertainties .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] presents the best fit radial profile model ( sz plus point source signals ) overlying the cluster radial profile as seen by diabolo at 2.1 mm .",
    "the residual signal is overplotted as a dashed line .",
    "one can also perform a fit with @xmath60 as a single free parameter . to do that , the central part of the map ( @xmath72  ) is excluded from the radial profile computation . the best fit parameter in this case is @xmath73 .",

    "moreover , it is in very good agreement with the value determined by @xcite from their 21ghz data : @xmath77 . finally , within the 2@xmath19 of our previous determination : @xmath78 @xcite . combining the @xmath79 value expected from the x - ray data ( @xmath36 ) and the one we estimated from our sz measurements , we are able to derived the @xmath80 value : @xmath81km / s / mpc .",

    ", we can suggest that this excess is compatible with the presence of a second point source in this region .",
    "this hypothesis is supported by the point source detected at 350ghz with scuba and at 8.46ghz with the vla by komatsu et al ( private communication ) .",

    "this source seems to be an infrared source .",
    "a millimeter residual , provided by the millimeter tail of a dust emission , could contribute to our signal .",
    "complementary millimeter observations are needed for this source .      from the diabolo map",
    ", we can directly estimate the gas mass which gives rise to the measured sz signal .",
    "the sz signal can directly converted into a gas mass value by applying the linear transformation : @xmath93 , where c is a constant which depends on the redshift ( @xmath11 ) and also on the gas temperature .",
    "the sz signal map is obtained after the subtraction of the point source best fit model ( see sec .",
    "[ szsignal ] ) .",
    "this rxj1347 - 1145 sz map is shown on figure  [ fig1]c ( the x - ray contours have been overplotted ) .",
    "afterwards , it is converted into a gas mass map , which is then integrated with respect to the distance to the cluster center ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .    due to the size of the diabolo map and especially to the part used to subtract the baseline ( 30% on the edge of each line ) , we could only measure the projected gas mass within a projected radius of 74  ( ie : 0.6mpc ) : @xmath94m@xmath1 .",
    "the error bar are quoted at a 68% confidence level .",
    "this value agrees very well with the estimate gas mass derived from the x - ray best fit model ( under the hypothesis of a spherical @xmath27-model ) : @xmath95m@xmath1 .",
    "this result confirms the agreement of the sz and the x - ray data , when the hypothesis of the @xmath27-model is adopted . in our case ,",
    "no bias has been introduced in the measured projected mass by the baseline subtraction .",
    "in fact the part of each line used to subtract the baseline has been taken out of 0.6mpc from the cluster center .",
    "a radius of 0.6mpc corresponds to an angular radius of 74.2  ( 8.8@xmath61 ) . assuming a virial radius of 10@xmath61 , the mass unaccounted for is estimated as no more than 16% of the total gas mass .",
    "our determination of the gas mass agrees with the x - ray determination .",
    "however , the x - ray total mass determination disagree with the strong lensing @xcite and the weak lensing @xcite determinations by a factor of two .",
    "@xcite explained this discrepancy by the effect of the cooling flow on the total mass estimation through x - ray data .",
    "he concludes that the correction from this effect removes the differences between the estimators of the total mass . as an example",
    ", we can propose an increase of the gas temperature by a factor of two ( @xmath96kev ) . to keep the sz signal unchanged",
    ", this increase has to be balanced by a decrease of the gas density by a factor of two .",
    "it then affects our results in the following ways : ( a ) the infered total mass will be divided by a factor of two ( @xmath97m@xmath1 ) .",
    "the total mass will also increase by a factor of two and then be in agreement with the lensing measurements .",
    "( b ) as far as we suggest an increase of the gas temperature balanced by a decrease of the gas density , the sz signal will remain unchanged . on the opposite , the x - ray flux will decrease by more than a factor of 2 ( scaling the x - ray flux as @xmath98 ) .",
    "consequently , the hubble constant will be affect by a factor of 2 ( @xmath99 ) .",
    "the previous scheme is very simple .",
    "the thermodynamic state of the intracluster medium is probably more complex mainly made of two gas components .",
    "a cold ( @xmath100kev ) , dense and peacked central component surrounded by a hot ( @xmath101kev ) , thin and extended component . in this case",
    "the cluster should present a non isothermal radial profile ( assuming the spherical symmetry ) . this kind of hypothesis could explain the very strong degeneracy which we encountered while trying to determine the core radius ( see sec .",
    "[ szsignal ] ) .",
    "unfortunately , the quality of our data is not good enough to argue in this direction .",
    "nevertheless , this suggestion is not unlikely .",
    "recent xmm - newton observations have already shown such a behavior in other cooling flow clusters : a1795 @xcite , a1835 @xcite      the best fit model gives a flux of @xmath102mjy / beam for the central point source .",
    "this point source can be visualized on the data map after the subtraction of the sz component .",
    "figure  [ fig1]d shows clearly an excess of positive emission in its center .",
    "the nvss map @xcite has been overplotted as contours .",
    "both signals match very well in term of position .",

    "@xcite have reported various measurements of this point source : an ovro flux of @xmath104 at 28.5ghz , a nma ( nobeyama millimeter array ) flux of @xmath105mjy at 100ghz and a 2@xmath19 upper limit of @xmath106mjy obtained with scuba at 350ghz . from this set of measurements and assuming a power law spectrum for the point source radio emission , they have derived : @xmath107mjy .",
    "more recently , @xcite have observed it with the vla at 8.46 and 22.46ghz .",
    "the respective detected flux are @xmath108 and @xmath109mjy .",
    "using those latest measurements , we update the point source power spectrum determination : @xmath110  mjy .",
    "the quality of this fit is moderate , due to the very robust constraints given by some of the data points ( see fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) .",
    "it is difficult to conclude firmly that a single power spectrum can model correctly the synchrotron emission from radio wavelengths down to millimeter wavelengths .",
    "the intensity and the spectral shape of the synchrotron emission is driven by the internal magnetic field of the radio source .",
    "furthermore its strength also drives the maximum frequency of emission allowed . to date , a lot of radio sources have been observed with various intensity and spectral shapes . because of this high rate of variation from one source to an other and because of the lack of millimeter data , we are not able to state on an eventual cut - off in the spectral shape of our radio source . for this reason , we adopted the previously defined power law model .",
    "it provides us an estimation of the flux contributed by the central point source at 143ghz ( 2.1 mm ) .    to explain the nature of the millimeter emission we have detected",
    ", we will now compare the residual radio flux expected at 143ghz ( 2.1 mm ) and 350ghz ( 850@xmath111 m ) from the previous power law spectrum to the flux respectively obtained from the diabolo data and from the scuba data . at 2.1 mm ,",
    "we have extrapolated : @xmath112mjy .",
    "this estimation is at 1@xmath19 compatible with our determination from the diabolo map .",
    "the 350ghz ( eg : 805@xmath111 m ) flux can be estimated too : @xmath113mjy .",
    "now , from the scuba data points published by @xcite , we have subtracted the positive sz contribution , computed from the cluster sz spectrum and scaled by our @xmath60 best fit value .",
    "the sz radial profile has been obtained from the model c ( see sec .  [ szsignal ] ) convolved with the scuba beam ( a gaussian beam with @xmath114  ) .",
    "we fixed the value of the signal offset ( so - called dc offset ) to 2.7mjy / beam as published by komatsu et al .",
    "we finally deduced for the point source : @xmath115mjy .",
    "the low signal to noise ratio of this last flux does not allow us to consider this result as the detection of a real submillimeter point source .",
    "nevertheless , our diabolo flux and the scuba flux are both compatible with the estimation extrapolated from the point source power spectrum . for this reason",
    ", it seems reasonable to deduce that the point source emission seen in our map is likely due to the synchrotron millimeter tail of the central radio point source emission .",
    "we have produced an extended map ( @xmath116 ) of the rxj1347 - 1145 cluster with the diabolo photometer .",
    "we have drawn the distribution of the sz signal up to 74  ( 0.6mpc ) from the cluster center .",
    "this sz signal is as much extended as the x - ray emission and is the strongest sz effect detected to date .",
    "the sz map allows us to directly derived the projected mass distribution and by the way to measure the cluster gas mass up to 0.6mpc .",
    "we derived @xmath117m@xmath1 .",
    "the gas mass estimated within the same region , under the assumption of a classical @xmath27-model and the cluster parameters derived from the x - ray data , agrees with our value .    due to the map noise level and to the observing strategy",
    ", we are not able to firmly conclude to the existence of substructure in the gas distribution .",
    "nevertheless , our map presents some asymmetric features at more than a 2@xmath19 level .    at the moment",
    ", the first results of the chandra and the xmm - newton satellites , concerning the observation of galaxy clusters , already show some departure in the density distribution from the @xmath27-model symmetry , as well as in the temperature distribution from the isothermality @xcite .",
    "for this reason , the comparison of the upcoming chandra and xmm - newton x - ray obervations to the actual and the future sz data ( from interferometers and bolometer arrays ) are needed to understand the cluster physical structure .",
