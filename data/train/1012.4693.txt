    "the aim of this paper is to develop a diagrammatic language for @xmath0-dimensional contact manifolds .",
    "this is motivated by ( but does not depend on ) the deep result of giroux  @xcite , which says that any closed contact manifold ( in any odd dimension ) admits an open book decomposition adapted to the contact structure , where the pages are stein manifolds and the monodromy is a symplectic diffeomorphism . in the case of a @xmath0-dimensional contact manifold ,",
    "the pages are stein surfaces .",
    "these permit a description via kirby diagrams , where the attaching circles for the @xmath1-handles are legendrian knots in the standard contact structure on the boundary @xmath2 of the @xmath3-handlebody .",
    "provided the monodromy is given as a product of dehn twists along lagrangian spheres corresponding to the @xmath1-handles , this too can be encoded in the kirby diagram .",
    "since legendrian knots are faithfully represented by their front projection in the @xmath1-plane , we obtain a description of @xmath0-manifolds in terms of @xmath1-dimensional diagrams .",
    "the combination of stabilisations of the open book with handle slides in the stein page leads to a couple of moves on such diagrams that do not change the contact @xmath0-manifold .",
    "these moves are introduced in section  [ section : moves ] , after a brief discussion of open books and their monodromy in sections [ section : book ] and  [ section : monodromy ] .",
    "we then present two simple applications of these moves to diagrams without @xmath3-handles . in section  [ section : s2s3 ] we describe an integer family of contact structures on @xmath4 and @xmath5 , the non - trivial @xmath6-bundle over  @xmath7 .",
    "we also give a diagrammatic proof of the diffeomorphism @xmath8 and its contact analogue . in section  [ section : no1handles ] we classify contact @xmath0-manifolds that admit stein fillings made up of a single @xmath9-handle and @xmath1-handles only .    in section  [ section : subcritical ]",
    "we turn our attention to general subcritically stein fillable contact @xmath0-manifolds .",
    "these can be described by open books with trivial monodromy , whose diagrammatic representations are particularly tractable .",
    "we show how to implement the tietze moves on presentations of the fundamental group as diagrammatic moves . as an application",
    ", we prove that subcritically fillable contact @xmath0-manifolds are classified by their fundamental group , up to connected sums with @xmath4 and @xmath5 ( with their standard contact structures ) , see theorem  [ thm : classification ] .",
    "there is a corresponding classification of the subcritical stein fillings ( corollary  [ cor : classification_stein ] ) .    roughly speaking ,",
    "these results can be phrased as saying that @xmath10-dimensional compact subcritical stein manifolds are determined by topological data .",
    "this contrasts sharply with the general situation for stein manifolds . in any even dimension @xmath11",
    "there are countably many pairwise distinct stein manifolds of finite type , all diffeomorphic to euclidean space ; this was proved by mclean  @xcite , building on earlier work of seidel and smith  @xcite .",
    "in section  [ section : s5 ] we specialise to subcritical stein fillings of the @xmath0-sphere and give a characterisation of the standard contact structure on @xmath12 in terms of such fillings .",
    "we discuss the relevance of this result in the context of the andrews ",
    "curtis conjecture concerning presentations of the trivial group .",
    "finally , in section  [ section : simply ] we exhibit diagrams for some special simply connected @xmath0-manifolds .",
    "these diagrams are then used to show that every @xmath0-dimensional simply connected spin manifold is a double branched cover of the @xmath0-sphere .",
    "a further application is a new proof that every simply connected @xmath0-manifold admits a contact structure in each homotopy class of almost contact structures .",
    "in this section we review the basic aspects of the giroux correspondence between contact structures and open books . we describe three essential operations on open books : dehn  seidel twist , stabilisation , and open book connected sum . in the last part of this section we recall how to compute the homology of open books .",
    "recall that a compact stein manifold is a compact complex manifold @xmath13 admitting a strictly plurisubharmonic function @xmath14 that is constant on the boundary  @xmath15 and has no critical points there . then the exact @xmath1-form @xmath16 defines a symplectic structure on  @xmath13 compatible with the complex structure .",
    "notice that compact stein manifolds are in particular of * finite type * , i.e.  they have finite handlebody decompositions .    according to a fundamental theorem of giroux  @xcite , any cooriented contact structure on a closed manifold",

    "@xcite , the @xmath129-dimensional stein fillable contact manifolds are characterised as those contact manifolds that admit a supporting open book whose monodromy is a composition of right - handed dehn twists . in higher dimensions ,",
    "this condition on the monodromy is still sufficient for stein fillability .",
    "if a contact manifold is supported by an open book whose monodromy is a composition of right - handed dehn twists along lagrangian spheres on the pages , then it is stein fillable .",
    "this appears to be a folklore theorem ; a proof can be found in  @xcite , see also  @xcite .",
    "the main idea is that a lagrangian sphere on a page can be made legendrian with respect to the contact structure on the open book ; a right - handed dehn twist then corresponds to a legendrian surgery , which preserves stein fillability .    in @xcite",
    "left - handed dehn twists are used to construct algebraically overtwisted contact manifolds , i.e.  contact manifolds with vanishing contact homology , which are conjecturally not strongly fillable ( and hence not stein fillable ) .",
    "we now want to give diagrammatic representations of @xmath0-dimensional contact open books . here",
    "the page is a stein surface , which can be described by a kirby diagram . according to a result of",
    "eliashberg  @xcite , worked out further by gompf  @xcite , any compact stein surface can be obtained from the @xmath130-disc in @xmath131 by attaching a finite number of @xmath3- and @xmath1-handles , where each @xmath1-handle is attached along a legendrian knot ( in the standard contact structure on the relevant boundary @xmath129-manifold ) , with framing @xmath132 relative to the contact framing of that legendrian knot .",
    "conversely ( this is the easier part ) , this recipe always produces a stein surface .",
    "the boundary @xmath129-manifold obtained by attaching @xmath55 @xmath3-handles to the @xmath130-disc is the connected sum @xmath133 with its unique tight contact structure ; the attaching circles for the @xmath1-handles form a legendrian link in this contact manifold . in other words ,",
    "the kirby diagram of a stein surface consists of a finite collection of pairs of attaching balls for the @xmath3-handles in @xmath134 with its standard contact structure @xmath135 , and the front projection to the @xmath136-plane of a legendrian link . for more information see @xcite and  @xcite .    in order to obtain a representation of the contact manifold @xmath80",
    ", one also needs to encode the monodromy @xmath18 in the diagram .",
    "this is possible in special cases .",
    "for instance , if one of the legendrian knots in the kirby diagram bounds in an obvious way a lagrangian disc in the stein surface  @xmath13 , the union of this disc with the core disc of the @xmath1-handle is a lagrangian sphere , and we can speak of a dehn twist along this sphere .",
    "beware that different such dehn twists will not , in general , commute with each other . in cases where the order of the dehn twists is inessential , we simply write the relevant dehn twist next to the legendrian knot representing the corresponding lagrangian sphere",
    ". in particular , stabilisations can be so encoded , provided one understands the monodromy of the given diagram .    by section  [ section : sum ] , the diagram for the connected sum of two contact open books is simply given by drawing the attaching balls and legendrian attaching circles in a single diagram , separated by a hyperplane .",
    "we illustrate the use of ( de-)stabilisations in the following two handle moves on a diagram of @xmath72 .",
    "these moves do not change the contactomorphism type of @xmath72 .",
    "assume we are given a kirby diagram for @xmath13 that includes a legendrian knot @xmath137 with the property that the monodromy @xmath18 equals the identity on the handle attached along  @xmath137 .",

    "bennequin invariant @xmath139 to the diagram , unlinked with the given legendrian link and not passing over @xmath3-handles .",
    "this @xmath138 bounds an obvious lagrangian disc , so a right - handed dehn twist @xmath140 along the corresponding @xmath1-sphere ( see the following remark ) amounts to a stabilisation of @xmath72 .",
    "it is not accidental that the knot @xmath138 we use for the stabilisation is chosen to have @xmath139 .",

    "if we push the core disc along its boundary in the direction of the surgery framing , we obtain a disjoint disc .",
    "hence , pushing @xmath47 in that direction along its boundary leads to a disc having intersection @xmath142 with @xmath47 .",
    "if @xmath47 is topologically isotopic to a disc in @xmath15 ( as in the case of  @xmath138 ) , this means that the linking number of @xmath138 with its push - off in the direction of the surgery framing equals  @xmath142 . since the surgery framing is obtained from the contact framing by adding a negative twist , we conclude @xmath139 .",

    "although the general belief appears to be that the andrews  curtis conjecture is false , we should admit in all fairness that this suggested strategy for disproving it is not the most promising one .",
    "it seems more likely that methods such as those indicated in remark  [ rem : hprinciple ] allow one to give a direct proof that the standard contact structure on @xmath12 is the only one admitting a subcritical stein filling .",
    "in this section we exhibit diagrams for contact structures on some simply connected @xmath0-manifolds . as a corollary , we obtain a branched covering description of @xmath0-dimensional simply connected spin manifolds , and a new proof that every simply connected @xmath0-manifold admits a contact structure in each homotopy class of almost contact structures .",
    "barden  @xcite has given a complete classification of simply connected @xmath0-manifolds .",
    "here we are only interested in those manifolds that potentially carry contact structures .",
    "if a @xmath0-manifold @xmath35 admits a contact structure , then its structure group reduces to @xmath210 ; such a reduction is called an * almost contact structure*. necessary and sufficient for the existence of an almost contact structure is the vanishing of the third integral stiefel ",
    "whitney class  @xmath289 , see  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition  8.1.1 ) .",
    "the manifold @xmath223 is the @xmath0-sphere ; the manifolds @xmath291 are prime if and only if @xmath55 is a prime power @xmath293 , @xmath294 .",
    "one obtains a unique prime decomposition of a given @xmath35 if one requires that only the @xmath295 and at most one summand @xmath5 are used , cf .",
    "proposition  [ prop : connect_sum_s2s3 ] .",
    "all the prime manifolds in this list , with the exception of @xmath5 , are spin manifolds , i.e.  their second stiefel  whitney class vanishes .",
    "let @xmath296 , @xmath219 , be the contact @xmath0-manifold represented by the diagram depicted in figure  [ fig : diagramm_k ] .",
    "write @xmath297 for the page of the open book represented by this diagram , so that @xmath298 .          [ thm : dehntwist_legendrian_surgery ] let @xmath301 be a legendrian sphere in a contact open book that sits on a page of the open book as a lagrangian submanifold",
    ". then the contact manifold obtained by legendrian surgery along @xmath47 is contactomorphic to @xmath302 , where @xmath113 denotes the right - handed dehn twist along @xmath69 .",
    "we construct a stein filling @xmath303 of @xmath296 by starting with the subcritical stein manifold @xmath304 , which is a filling for @xmath305 , and attaching a @xmath129-handle for each dehn twist .",
    "the first two @xmath129-handles corresponding to @xmath306 and @xmath307 cancel the @xmath1-handles of  @xmath297 , so we obtain a @xmath10-dimensional disc @xmath285 .",
    "the further two @xmath129-handles corresponding to the iterated application of @xmath306 and @xmath307 then yields the stein filling  @xmath303 .",
    "this implies @xmath308 , and the skew - symmetric intersection form @xmath309 on @xmath310 has to look like @xmath311 for some @xmath312 . by the argument mentioned in section  [ section : homology_openbook ]",
    "we conclude @xmath313    the manifold @xmath300 is obviously simply connected , and it satisfies @xmath314 because it carries a contact structure .",
    "so in order to establish that @xmath300 is diffeomorphic to @xmath291 it suffices to show , by barden s classification , that @xmath315 .",
    "decompose the open book @xmath300 as @xmath316 as in section  [ section : openbooks_defs ] , with @xmath317 the mapping torus of  @xmath297 , and @xmath318 .",
    "we can then compute the homology of @xmath300 by the procedure outlined in section  [ section : homology_openbook ] .",
    "in particular , we consider the mayer ",
    "vietoris sequence @xmath319    in terms of the standard generators of @xmath320 , the intersection form @xmath321 is given by @xmath322 thus , as shown in section  [ section : action ] , the action of the two dehn twists on @xmath320 is given by @xmath323 hence @xmath324 from the wang sequence of the mapping torus @xmath317 we then have @xmath325      from the knneth theorem we have @xmath332 from the wang sequence one sees that @xmath333 is generated by the class of @xmath334 , where @xmath335 is any point of  @xmath336 . combining these two pieces of information ,",
    "one deduces that the homomorphism @xmath337 in the mayer ",
    "vietoris sequence is an isomorphism .",
    "so that sequence tells us that @xmath341 is a quotient of @xmath342 , and hence at most of rank  @xmath3 . combining this with the information that @xmath341 is isomorphic to @xmath343 , we conclude @xmath344 . since @xmath345",
    ", we obtain @xmath346 from the universal coefficient theorem , whence @xmath347 by poincar duality .",
    "thus , the mayer ",
    "vietoris sequence reduces to @xmath348      for @xmath330 the short exact sequence becomes @xmath353 recall that @xmath354 is generated by meridional loops @xmath355 around @xmath356 , respectively .",
    "the homomorphism @xmath357 is given by sending @xmath358 to the class represented by the torus @xmath359 . now cut this torus along a meridian @xmath360 and insert two meridional discs in  @xmath361 ( of opposite orientation ) ; this gives us a @xmath1-sphere in @xmath362 representing the same homology class .",
    "now flow one of the meridional discs and the cylindrical part of that @xmath1-sphere along a vector field on the mapping torus that is transverse to the fibres and whose time-1 map , say , gives the monodromy map from a fibre to itself .",
    "the geometric intersection number of the meridional disc @xmath363 to @xmath358 with the spherical generator @xmath364 of @xmath365 corresponding to @xmath366 ( made up of a seifert disc for @xmath366 and the core disc of the @xmath1-handle ) equals the kronecker  @xmath367 .",
    "the self - intersection number of the @xmath368 is @xmath142 , and the intersection number between @xmath369 and @xmath370 equals @xmath330 .",
    "hence , with the observation from section  [ section : action ] we infer that the monodromy @xmath299 acts on the @xmath363 as follows : @xmath371 the homology group @xmath372 is generated by the classes of @xmath369 and @xmath370 , subject to the relation @xmath373 .",
    "so the effect of the monodromy homomorphism can also be written as @xmath374 it follows that the @xmath1-torus @xmath375 ( resp .",
    "@xmath376 ) is homologically equivalent to @xmath377 ( resp .",
    "@xmath378 ) in  @xmath362 . thus , in terms of suitable generators , the homomorphism @xmath379 in the mayer ",
    "vietoris sequence for @xmath380 is multiplication by  @xmath1 , hence @xmath381 , i.e.  @xmath382 .          by barden s classification , any",
    "closed , simply connected @xmath0-dimensional spin manifold @xmath35 can be decomposed as @xmath383 this classification of _ spin _ manifolds had actually been achieved earlier by smale  @xcite . by the preceding section , each @xmath384 is diffeomorphic to an open book @xmath385 .",
    "the manifold @xmath4 can likewise be written as an open book with quadratic monodromy .",
    "namely , as page take the cotangent unit disc bundle @xmath386 of  @xmath7 . with proposition  [ prop : s2s3 ]",
    "the manifold @xmath387 can be shown to be diffeomorphic to @xmath4 .",
    "let @xmath140 be a right - handed dehn twist along the zero section of  @xmath386 .",
    "since @xmath388 is isotopic , relative to the boundary , to the identity map , it follows that @xmath4 is diffeomorphic to @xmath389 , see @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "so @xmath35 can be written as @xmath390 this implies that @xmath35 is the double branched cover of @xmath391 branched along the binding of the open book . that last open book , however , is a right - handed stabilisation of @xmath392 , which is diffeomorphic to the @xmath0-sphere .",
    "the following theorem was first proved by the second author  @xcite , using contact surgery .",
    "the second proof was given by the third author  @xcite , using open book decompositions .",
    "here we give a diagrammatic proof .",
    "homotopy classes of almost contact structures on oriented , simply connected @xmath0-manifolds are classified by the first chern class , cf .",
    "* proposition  8.1.1 ) .",
    "so each @xmath291 in barden s classification admits a unique almost contact structure up to homotopy ( for either of its orientations ) .",
    "the result now follows from section  [ section : mk ] and proposition  [ prop : s2s3 ] .",
    "this project was initiated during the conference `` symplectic topology , contact topology , and applications '' at hokkaido university , organised by o.  v.  k.  ( then a post - doc at hokkaido university ) and funded by jsps grant 19@xmath39307804 .",
