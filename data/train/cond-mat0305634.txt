    "elastic objects pinned by a quenched random potential are a relevant model for many experimental systems .",
    "it describes interfaces in magnets @xcite which experience either short - range disorder ( random bond ) , or long range ( random field ) disorder , the contact line of a liquid wetting a rough substrate @xcite , vortex lines in superconductors @xcite .",
    "it also provides powerful analogies , via mode coupling theory , to complex systems such as structural glasses @xcite .",
    "one important observable is the roughness exponent @xmath3 of the pinned manifold .    from the theoretical side ,",
    "this problem still offers considerable challenges .",
    "it is the simplest example of a class of disordered systems , including random field magnets , where the so called dimensional reduction @xcite renders conventional perturbation theory trivial and useless at zero temperature .",
    "the elastic object is usually parameterized by a @xmath1 component vector @xmath4 in the embedding space @xmath5 , and @xmath6 is the coordinate in the internal space .",
    "apart from the case of the directed polymer ( dp ) in @xmath7 dimensions ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 ) , where some exact results were obtained @xcite , analytical results are scarce . one important challenge is to understand the dp for any @xmath1 , due to its exact relation to the kardar - parisi - zhang growth equation whose upper critical dimension is at present not known , and even its very existence is debated @xcite .",
    "two main analytical approaches have been devised so far .",
    "each succeeds in evading dimensional reduction , providing an interesting physical picture , but comes with its limitations .",
    "the first one is the mean field theory , the replica gaussian variational method ( gvm ) @xcite in the statics and the off equilibrium dynamical version @xcite .",
    "the gvm approximates the replica measure by a replica symmetry broken ( rsb ) gaussian , equivalently , the gibbs measure for @xmath10 as a random superposition of gaussians @xcite , and is argued to be exact for @xmath11 .",
    "it yields flory values for the exponent @xmath3 . as for spin glasses , computing the next order corrections ( i.e.  in @xmath12 ) at the rsb saddle point",
    "is very arduous @xcite .",
    "one may question whether it is the most promising route , since it is as yet unclear whether the huge degeneracy of states encoded in the parisi rsb is relevant to describe finite @xmath1 .",
    "there seems to be some agreement that this type of rsb does not occur for low @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "certainly , in the simpler but still - non trivial @xmath13 limit , parisi type rsb found in the gvm should exist only at @xmath11 , apart from the interesting so - called marginal case of logarithmic correlations @xcite .",
    "for the dp , another exactly solvable mean field limit is the cayley tree and there too it is not clear how to meaningfully expand around that limit @xcite .",
    "the second main analytical method is the functional renormalization group ( frg ) which performs a dimensional expansion around @xmath14 and was originally developped only to one loop , within a wilson scheme @xcite .",
    "its aim is to include fluctuations , neglected in the mean - field approaches .",
    "there too , the dynamics @xcite has been investigated .",
    "the frg follows the second cumulant of the random potential @xmath15 under coarse graining , a full function since the field is dimensionless in @xmath14 .",
    "it was found that @xmath15 becomes non - analytic already in the 1-loop equation at @xmath16 after a finite renormalization , at the larkin scale .",
    "both methods circumvent dimensional reduction by providing a mechanism which is non - perturbative in the bare disorder .",
    "the gvm evades dr thanks to the rsb saddle point .",
    "the frg escapes via the generation of a cusp - like non - analyticity in @xmath17 at @xmath18 .",
    "indeed , while the bare disorder correlator is an analytic function , frg fixed points for the renormalized @xmath15 , perturbative in @xmath2 , are found only in the space of non - analytic functions , and subject to the condition that the resulting exponent @xmath3 is non - trivial . both methods are disconcertingly different in spirit and it is an outstanding question in the theory of disordered systems how to compare and reconcile them .",
    "comparisons were made between some predictions of the 1-loop frg and of the gvm @xcite .",
    "balents and fisher obtained the 1-loop frg equation for any @xmath1 restricted to @xmath19 , and found that its solution reproduces the flory value of @xmath3 for lr disorder , but yields subtle corrections for sr disorder , exponential in @xmath1 .",
    "physically both methods capture the metastable states beyond the larkin scale @xmath20 and it is tempting to compare how they describe them . in @xcite",
    "a coarse grained random potential was defined and it was found within the gvm that its correlator mimics the one in the frg , exhibiting some non - analyticity which was interpreted in terms of shock - like singularities in the coarse grained disorder . unfortunately , this analogy was demonstrated only around the larkin scale , while a quantitative and more general connection able to reach perturbatively the true large scale behaviour , as is achieved in the field theoretic frg , is still missing .",
    "the need for a study of the frg at large @xmath1 is all the more pressing since we have developped systematic higher loop approaches within the @xmath21-expansion @xcite . within these studies",
    ", we have found that higher loop frg equations for @xmath15 at @xmath22 contain non - trivial , potentially ambiguous `` anomalous terms '' involving the non - analytic structure of @xmath15 at @xmath23 .",
    "we have proposed a solution to lift these ambiguities in the statics at two loops @xcite .",
    "since the large-@xmath1 limit allows in principle to handle higher - loop corrections ( i.e.  to treat any @xmath21 ) it should be useful to understand the many - loop structure of the field theory .",
    "stated differently , we want to understand which physical quantity precisely does the frg computes ? finally , developping a systematic @xmath12 expansion within the frg for any @xmath0 should provide a novel handle to attack problems such as kpz , maybe avoiding the need for spontaneous rsb altogether if it proves to be non - essential .",
    "the aim of this paper is to study the frg at large @xmath1 . for this purpose",
    "we first perform an exact calculation of the effective action @xmath24 $ ] of the replicated field theory at large @xmath1 .",
    "its value for a uniform mode and further expansion in cumulants yields a definition of the renormalized disorder consistent with field theoretic approaches .",
    "the second disorder cumulant is found to obey a closed self - consistent equation .",
    "all higher cumulants can be constructed recursively from the lower ones .",
    "it can be easily inverted below the larkin scale and there the solution is analytic and corresponds to the replica symmetric solution of mp .",
    "varying with respect to an infrared scale , here the mass , we obtain the frg @xmath25-function in any @xmath0 at dominant order , @xmath11 .",
    "the continuation beyond the larkin scale is remarkably easier to perform on the resulting frg equation .",
    "its solution reveals that the frg _ exactly _ reproduces the non - trivial result of the gvm with full rsb for small overlap .",
    "we also give a formula which yields the complete rsb solution for all overlaps . at no point in our derivation parisi - rsb",
    "is invoked , as replica symmetry is broken explicitly here . since our saddle point equations for the effective action contain both the mp equations and the frg , it can be used to describe the crossover from frg to rsb .",
    "a qualitative analysis of this crossover is given , as well as a comparison with previous attempts to relate the frg to the gvm @xcite .",
    "finally , applications to other problems and new perspectives are discussed .",
    "a short version of this work has appeared in @xcite . in a related paper @xcite ,",
    "we give all details of the calculation of the @xmath26 corrections , with the aim of understanding finite but large @xmath1 .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section [ sec : model and program ]",
    "we define the model , the effective action and its physical interpretation . in section [ sec : calculgamma ] we compute the effective action at large @xmath1 , using the saddle point method and perform a cumulant expansion ( section [ sec : self - consistent equation for the renormalized disorder ] ) .",
    "a graphical interpretation is given in section [ s : graphinterprete ] . in section [",
    "sec : functional renormalization group equations ] we establish the frg equation at large @xmath1 ( the @xmath25-function of the theory ) .",
    "then in section [ detailed ] we perfom a detailed analysis of the frg equation for a specific class of disorder correlators , both below and above the larkin scale . in section [ sec : comparisonrsbfrg ] we compare the frg with the mp solution using rsb .",
    "first we recall the mp approach and find agreement with the predictions of the frg calculation .",
    "next we extend these results to an arbitrary disorder correlator for which the gvm gives full rsb .",
    "finally we discuss the physical interpretation and compare our approach with the one of ref .",
    "section [ sec : discussion and conclusion ] presents the conclusion .",
    "the appendices contain several generalizations , the calculation of the third and fourth disorder cumulant , finite temperature fixed points , and an analysis and comparison with the effective action in more conventional field theories .",
    "we consider the general model for an elastic manifold of internal dimension @xmath0 embedded in a space of dimension @xmath1 .",
    "the position of the manifold in the embedding space is described by a single valued displacement field @xmath27 , where @xmath28 belongs to the internal space and @xmath10 is a @xmath1 component vector which belongs to the embedding space .",
    "( its components @xmath29 , @xmath30 , are specified below only when strictly necessary . )",
    "a well studied example is that of an interface ( e.g.  a domain wall in a magnet ) where @xmath31 and @xmath9 .",
    "there @xmath27 denotes the height of the interface .",
    "other examples are the directed polymer ( @xmath8 ) in a @xmath1 dimensional space , which can be mapped to the @xmath1-dimensional burgers and kardar - parisi- zhang ( kpz ) equations @xcite , or a vortex lattice in the absence of dislocations described by @xmath32 , @xmath33 , where @xmath27 is there the deformation from the ideal crystal @xcite .",
    "we will study here the equilibrium statistical mechanics of such an elastic manifold in presence of quenched disorder , modeled by a random potential @xmath34 .",
    "it is described , in a given realization of the random potential , by the partition function @xmath35\\ , { { \\mathrm{e}}}^{- { \\cal h}_v[u]/t } \\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath36}{t } = \\int_q ~ \\frac{1}{2 } ~ c(q)^{-1 } ~ u(-q ) \\cdot u(q ) + \\frac{1}{t } \\int_x v(x , u(x))\\ ] ] consists out of an elastic energy ( expressed here in fourier space and taken to be isotropic ) , and of a pinning energy due to disorder . here and below we denote @xmath37 and @xmath38 . throughout , square brackets as e.g.  in @xmath39 $ ]",
    "denote a functional , here @xmath40 of the field @xmath41 , while parenthesis as in @xmath42 denote functions .",
    "a convenient form for the inverse bare propagator , used below , is : @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the temperature and the elastic constant is set to unity by a choice of units .",
    "the role of the additional mass term @xmath45 will be discussed below . an additional small scale ( ultraviolet , uv ) cutoff @xmath46 is implied here and will be made explicit when needed .",
    "this model is highly non - trivial and , apart from the cases of @xmath9 and @xmath47 , very few exact results are known @xcite . to obtain exact results for large embedding space @xmath48 , we need to consider a fully isotropic version of the model with @xmath49 symmetry such that the model remains non - trivial in that limit . as in standard large-@xmath1 treatment ( as for instance of the @xmath50 @xmath49 model )",
    "one defines the rescaled field @xmath51 we will freely switch from one to the other in the following .",
    "one also chooses the distribution of the random potential to be @xmath49 rotationally invariant .",
    "it can be parameterized by its set of connected cumulants , of the form @xmath52 this adequately models the case of uncorrelated ( or short - range correlated ) disorder in the internal space , studied here .",
    "the second cumulant , which plays the central role , is thus defined in terms of a function @xmath53 .",
    "the higher cumulants are not strictly necessary in the bare model , but they appear , as we will see , under coarse graining .",
    "the distribution of disorder being translationally invariant , these functions satisfy @xmath54 for any @xmath55 .",
    "the model studied here is thus a slight generalization of the model studied by mezard and parisi @xcite , henceforth also referred to as mp , in the same limit .",
    "although we will consider the general case , it is useful , as in mp @xcite to define two sets of simple models for which more specific results will be given .",
    "these are , respectively , the gaussian , short - range ( sr ) disorder , correlator @xmath56 and the power - law correlations @xmath57 which , for infinite @xmath1 always corresponds to long - range ( lr ) disorder , a different universality class , as we will see below . for finite @xmath1 , the long - range disorder corresponds , at the bare level , to @xmath58 ; but this is modified at the renormalized level , and the true frontier lr - sr for finite @xmath1 is non - trivial .      having defined the model , and before turning to calculations , let us first outline what we aim at .",
    "all the considerations in the present section are valid for any @xmath1 , but , since in the next section we will consider the large @xmath1 limit explicitly , we already make apparent the rescalings .    the model defined above has already been studied in mp @xcite .",
    "one of the aims of this study was to compute the roughness exponent of the manifold , defined from the 2-point function as @xmath59 besides the roughness exponent @xmath3 , the amplitude @xmath40 is also of interest whenever it is universal , as it is the case e.g.  for long range disorder . to this",
    "aim the model was replicated ( @xmath60 ) , averaged over disorder and self - consistent saddle point equations where derived for the 2-point function @xmath61 this can always be done in a large-@xmath1 limit , and is then solved via a rsb ansatz .",
    "our goal is in a sense broader .",
    "we want to understand the full structure of the field theory , i.e.  all correlation functions and not only the 2-point one .",
    "we will thus instead study the generating function of correlations as well as the effective action functional which yields the renormalized vertices .",
    "this program , defined here , will be carried out in the following sections explicitly for large @xmath1 . in this article",
    "we will restrict ourselves to dominant order , but the aim is to understand large but finite @xmath1 , including calculating of @xmath12 corrections .",
    "this is deferred to @xcite .",
    "all physical observables for any @xmath1 can be obtained from the replicated action in presence of a source , i.e.  an external force @xmath62 acting on each replica : @xmath63 = \\overline { \\int \\prod_a { \\cal d } [ u_a ] e^{- \\sum_a h_v[u_a]/t + \\int_x \\sum_a j_a(x)\\cdot u_{a}(x ) } }   \\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath41 , @xmath64 are the replicated fields ( each one being an @xmath1 component vector @xmath65 ) .",
    "differentiating with respect to the replicated source @xmath62 in the limit @xmath66 yields all correlation functions .",
    "the finite-@xmath67 information is also interesting .",
    "for instance from @xmath68 = \\overline{\\exp(- n { \\cal f}_v / t)}\\ ] ] one can retrieve the sample to sample distribution of the free energy @xmath69 , as was done e.g.  in a finite size system for @xmath8 @xcite . thus , unless specified we will keep @xmath67 arbitrary .",
    "one can explicitly perform the disorder average in ( [ repzj ] ) : @xmath70&= & \\int \\prod_a { \\cal d } [ u_a ] { { \\mathrm{e}}}^ { - n { \\cal s}[u , j ] } \\\\   { \\cal s}[u , j ] & = &   \\frac{1}{2 } \\int_q   c(q)^{-1 } v_a(-q ) \\cdot v_a(q )   \\nonumber \\\\   & & + \\int_x [ u(\\chi(x ) ) - j_a(x ) \\cdot v_a(x ) ] \\qquad \\label{lf9}\\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where here @xmath71 and here and below summations over repeated replica indices are implicit .",
    "we have rescaled the source in a manner complementary to the field : @xmath72 we have also introduced the bare interaction potential @xmath73 which is a function of a @xmath67 by @xmath67 replica matrix @xmath74 and has a cumulant expansion in terms of sums with higher numbers of replicas . because of translational symmetry and @xmath49 invariance it depends only on the matrix @xmath75 and the form of each cumulant is restricted .",
    "for instance one has @xmath76 etc .. the matrix potential @xmath77 can thus be considered as a convenient way to parameterize the disorder ( here the bare disorder ) .",
    "the physical object which contains the information about the field theory at large scale is the effective action .",
    "it is the generating function of the 1-particle irreducible diagrams and in conventional field theories its formal expansion in powers of the field yields the renormalized vertices . all correlation functions are then obtained simply as tree diagrams from these renormalized vertices .",
    "in particular it is known that within a @xmath78 expansion at zero temperature to at least 2-loop order the theory can be renormalized ( i.e.  rendered uv finite and yielding universal results ) by considering counter - terms only to the second cumulant .",
    "the latter is a function @xmath15 , and can be viewed as the set of all coupling constants which simultaneously become marginal in @xmath14 . to probe renormalizability to any number of loops ,",
    "we want to compute the effective action from first principles .",
    "the effective action functional is defined as a legendre transform : @xmath79 + { \\cal w}[j ] & = & \\int_x \\sum_a j_a(x ) \\cdot u_a(x ) \\\\   { \\cal w } [ j ] & = & \\ln { \\cal z}[j ]   \\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] strictly speaking the definition is the convex envelope @xmath24=\\min_j ( \\int_x \\sum_a j_a(x ) \\cdot u_a(x ) - { \\cal w}[j])$ ] . here",
    "we apply the definition to the replicated action , and will content ourselves with the differential definition @xmath80}{\\delta u_a(x ) } & = & j_a(x ) \\\\",
    "\\frac{\\delta { \\cal w}[j]}{\\delta j_a(x ) } & = & u_a(x ) \\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which relates a pair of values @xmath81 , later also denoted by @xmath82,u)$ ] . since @xmath24 $ ] defines the renormalized vertices , its zero momentum limit defines the _",
    "renormalized disorder_. thus in order to compute the renormalized disorder , we only need to compute @xmath24 $ ] ( per unit volume ) for a _ uniform _ configuration of the replica field @xmath83 ( a so - called fixed background configuration ) . because of the statistical tilt symmetry @xcite , i.e. invariance of disorder term in the replicated action ( [ lf9 ] ) under the translation @xmath84 , and of the @xmath49 invariance one can argue , and this is what we find below , that for the model ( [ choice ] ) the scaled effective action per unit volume ( which for a uniform mode is simply a function of @xmath85 ) should have the following form @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the volume of the system , and here and below we use the notation : @xmath88 for the @xmath67 by @xmath67 replica matrix .",
    "this defines the renormalized disorder .",
    "furthermore , whenever @xmath89 can be expanded , up to a constant , in the form : @xmath90 where here and in the following we denote @xmath91 then ( [ cumulants ] ) defines the _ renormalized cumulant _ functions @xmath92 etc .. as we will see below this is correct up to some very subtle behavior at coinciding replica vectors ( i.e.@xmath93 for some pair @xmath94 ) .",
    "also note that the constant part @xmath95 is the free energy .",
    "the main result of the following sections will be the exact calculation of the uniform part of the effective action , i.e.  of the function @xmath89 .",
    "this will be performed within a large @xmath1 expansion : @xmath96 and here we will obtain the dominant order @xmath97 ; the corrections @xmath98 are calculated in @xcite . it will be a function of a scale parameter . we choose to add a mass - term @xmath45 which provides such a scale .",
    "it is a convenient choice since for @xmath99 one has @xmath100 : fluctuations are totally suppressed and the effective action equals the action .",
    "one can then progressively lower the mass down to zero , starting from this initial condition , since ultimately one is interested in the massless limit .",
    "another choice is to change the uv cutoff , as will be discussed again below .",
    "it is now useful to give a more direct physical interpretation of this quantity , in addition to the above field theoretic interpretation .      the effective action for a uniform background is also known to be related to the distribution of the order parameter .",
    "let us recall the relation for a simple pure ferromagnet .",
    "the unnormalized probability distribution of the order parameter @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the local magnetization is by definition @xmath103\\ , \\delta\\left(\\phi - \\frac{1}{l^d } \\int_x \\phi(x)\\right ) { { \\mathrm{e}}}^ { - s[\\phi ] } \\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath104 $ ] is the action which describes the ferromagnet ( e.g.  a @xmath50 theory or a landau ginsburg model ) .",
    "the functional @xmath105 evaluated for a uniform @xmath106 reads : @xmath107 in the large - volume limit , the saddle point can be taken and since the legendre transform is involutive , this yields the relation between the effective action at @xmath108 per unit volume and the probability distribution of the order parameter as : @xmath109 in the thermodynamic limit the effective action per unit volume can very well be a non - analytic function .",
    "this is the case e.g.  in the ferromagnetic phase where its left and right second derivatives at @xmath110 do not coincide ( @xmath111 is the spontaneous magnetization per unit volume ) .",
    "while the right derivative at @xmath110 is related to the inverse susceptibility , the left one is zero , mathematically due to the prescription to take the convex envelope , and physically because one can always lower the magnetization at no cost in free energy per unit volume by introducing a domain wall .",
    "the above property ( [ lf17 ] ) can be extended to a given @xmath112 mode .",
    "finally , note that in @xmath13 the above does not hold since there is no large factor @xmath113 , and the probability distribution is directly given by the action @xmath114 .",
    "what is then the physical meaning of the quantity that we will be computing in the next sections ? let us in analogy to the magnetization for a ferromagnet define the center of mass of an interface : @xmath115 since we have added a mass in the elastic energy ( [ choice ] ) , which acts as an extra quadratic well bounding the fluctuations of the interface , the disorder - induced fluctuations of the center of mass are always finite .",
    "one expects that they diverge typically as @xmath116 as @xmath117 , thus their behavior as a function of @xmath45 is of high interest and yields e.g.  the information about the roughness exponent .",
    "one can then define the probability distribution @xmath118 of the center of mass of the interface in a given realization of the random potential @xmath119 ( and in presence of the quadratic well induced by the mass ) .",
    "one can see that by definition the generating function for a uniform @xmath120 is the laplace transform of the probability distribution of @xmath121 , namely @xmath122 then by the same saddle point argument as for the ferromagnet one expects , at least naively , that @xmath123 = - \\lim_{l \\to \\infty } \\frac{1}{n l^d } \\ln \\overline{p_v(w_1 ) \\dots p_v(w_n ) } \\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] symbolically one can write : @xmath124 } \\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] provided this is taken with a grain of salt .",
    "thus one can also think of the renormalized disorder @xmath125 as parameterizing the set of correlations of an effective equivalent toy model ( @xmath13 ) which has the same set of correlations as the center of mass variable in the original model .",
    "the @xmath126-th connected moment of the center of mass is identical , up to a volume factor , to the zero momentum limit of the connected m point correlator of the @xmath10 field , e.g. @xmath127 and , once the effective action is known , both can thus be obtained in principle as the sum of all tree graphs made from @xmath128 $ ] vertices .",
    "for instance the 2-point function should be obtainable from : @xmath129^{-1}_{ab}\\ ] ] and the connected 4-point function from : @xmath130^{-1}_{ae } [ \\hat{\\gamma}''[v=0]]^{-1}_{bf }   \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\times [ \\hat{\\gamma}''[v=0]]^{-1}_{cg } [ \\hat{\\gamma}''[v=0]]^{-1}_{dh } \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\times \\hat{\\gamma}''''[v=0]_{efgh}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this however assumes analyticity , which as we will see below , does not always hold .",

    "then for @xmath311 , since @xmath292 diverges for small @xmath45 , one sees from ( [ secder0 ] ) that @xmath308 becomes infinite as @xmath312 , where the larkin mass @xmath313 is the solution of : @xmath314 with @xmath315)$ ] and has the standard dependence @xmath316 of the inverse larkin length on the bare disorder ( a larkin length @xmath317 can be defined ) .",
    "since @xmath318 is like @xmath319 positive , this divergence is the usual one of the frg , as also found in 1- and 2-loop studies @xcite , where it signals that the function @xmath320 becomes non - analytic and that a cusp singularity forms at @xmath18 in the second derivative @xmath321 , i.e.  in the correlator of the pinning force .",
    "this is usually interpreted as a glass phase with many metastable states beyond the larkin length .",
    "thus for @xmath322 the function always becomes non - analytic at large scale ( small mass ) , and there is a single glass phase .",
    "for @xmath323 , since @xmath292 is convergent , the cusp occurs only if the bare disorder is sufficiently large .    at non - zero temperature @xmath281 ( [ secder0 ] )",
    "shows that for @xmath324 thermal fluctuations do not change the scenario .",
    "since @xmath294 remains finite , temperature only slightly renormalizes the value of @xmath313 downward , as @xmath325 for @xmath326 . for @xmath327 the effect of thermal fluctuations",
    "is more important . for definiteness let us consider the set of models with power law correlations ( [ corrlr ] ) .",
    "then ( [ secder0 ] ) becomes : @xmath328 since both integrals diverge for small mass as @xmath329 , @xmath330 , one can distinguish three cases :    * if disorder correlations decay fast enough @xmath331 then the @xmath294 term wins and as @xmath117 one has @xmath332 , indicating that disorder is subdominant , resulting in a high - temperature phase . in that case",
    "the solution is analytic as @xmath117 .",
    "there is however a more complicated behavior for intermediate values of @xmath45 ( see appendix [ app : sr ] ) . *",
    "if disorder correlations decay slower , i.e.  @xmath333 , the term proportional to @xmath292 wins and the solution always becomes non - analytic at some larkin mass .",
    "* in the marginal case , @xmath334 there is a transition at some critical temperature @xmath335 between a high temperature phase and a glass phase .",
    "these features are very general and each of these cases will be studied in more details below .",
    "one can immediately see that the existence of an analytic solution for @xmath336 is in one to one correspondence to the existence of a locally stable replica symmetric solution of the mp equations .",
    "indeed the condition for the stability of the rs saddle point is precisely that the replicon eigenvalue be positive , namely that @xcite : @xmath337 be positive for all @xmath126 .",
    "the rsb instability occurs when the lowest eigenvalue , which corresponds to @xmath338 , vanishes .",
    "the condition @xmath339 is equivalent to the vanishing of ( [ secder0 ] ) , i.e.  of the divergence of @xmath318 and the emergence of non - analytic behavior .",
    "thus the generation of a cusp in the frg coincides at large @xmath1 exactly with the instability of the rs solution .",
    "it is easy to see that an analytic solution @xmath296 of ( [ starting ] ) and ( [ frg1 ] ) can not describe the glass phase at @xmath16 .",
    "indeed when @xmath296 is analytic , eq .",
    "( [ 3cum ] ) and similar results for higher cumulants indicate that the full effective action is analytic .",
    "it is then immediate to obtain correlations from its derivatives .",
    "for instance , from ( [ lf20 ] ) the 2-point function at @xmath108 is simply : @xmath340 on the other hand , setting @xmath307 in ( [ starting ] ) one finds : @xmath341 thus at @xmath16 one recovers the dimensional reduction ( dr ) result @xmath342 with @xmath343 instead of a non - trivial value for @xmath3 expected in the glass phase .",
    "furthermore since the effective action is analytic , all higher connected cumulants will trivially vanish at @xmath16 ( or be equal to the bare ones if the bare model contains such higher cumulants ) from the dr property .",
    "clearly , in the glass phase , the dr scaling is expected to be incorrect and a non - analytic solution should be found , as well as a way to escape ( [ dr ] ) .",
    "below we find how such a mechanism occurs within the frg .",
    "it will emerge from our study that for the case where disorder is relevant in the large scale limit ( i.e.  the long range case @xmath333 mentioned above ) the non - analytic solution of the frg equation will correspond to the full replica symmetry breaking solution of mp .",
    "the situation for the short range case is more delicate .",
    "both are discussed below .",
    "the equation ( [ frg1 ] ) is valid ( for @xmath11 ) in any spatial dimension @xmath0 .",
    "since one has the exact relation : @xmath344 one sees that the frg equation ( [ frg1 ] ) has a well defined limit @xmath345 for @xmath322 .",
    "it makes formulae somewhat simpler so we will start by considering this case ; the case @xmath293 will be studied later .",
    "note that although the equation has a well - defined limit , its solution may require a uv cutoff ( e.g.  as is manifestly the case in integrating ( [ rel ] ) above ) .",
    "thus from now on we study @xmath311 and consider the infinite uv cutoff limit .",
    "then one has @xmath346 with @xmath2 .",

    "we emphasize that this frg equation ( [ frg2 ] ) that we have derived is valid , to dominant order in @xmath12 , _ in any dimension _ @xmath322 and at any temperature @xmath44 . in a previous study",

    "if we consider the dominant order in @xmath1 of their equation , we find that it is identical to the @xmath16 part of ( [ frg2 ] ) ( up to some changes in notation ) .",
    "equation ( [ frg2 ] ) however is valid to _ all orders _ in @xmath21 , an important point which the method used in @xcite could not address .",
    "comparison of ( [ frg2 ] ) to our recent 2-loop , i.e.  @xmath353 studies requires to expand to next order in @xmath12 and is performed in @xcite .",
    "furthermore ( [ frg2 ] ) includes the effect of temperature to all orders in @xmath21 . expanding the term proportional to @xmath44 to lowest order in disorder @xmath211 , one finds the term @xmath354 .",
    "this is the large-@xmath1 limit of the tadpole term obtained in the 1-loop frg at @xmath281 @xcite : @xmath355 where for infinite @xmath1 the last term drops out .",

    "the form and the effect of the temperature term in ( [ frg2 ] ) to all orders in @xmath21 is radically different from its 1-loop truncation .",
    "indeed , in the 1-loop frg the temperature is known to smoothen the cusp and render the function @xmath320 analytic in a boundary layer @xmath356 ( e.g.  for @xmath9 @xcite ) with @xmath357 . here however , as further analysis confirms below , for @xmath358 the divergence of @xmath359 is self - reinforcing since it kills the term proportional to @xmath360 .",
    "we find that it usually occurs at a finite ( larkin ) scale . in the marginal case @xmath361",

    "one can of course keep an explicit @xmath46 dependence everywhere , but that leads to needless complications without changing the result .",

    "( the validity near @xmath307 beyond the larkin length is reexamined below ) .",

    "two approaches are legitimate , corresponding to different points of view .",
    "the first , natural in mean field , is exact integration .",
    "but then one discovers that the solution becomes non - analytic upon reaching the larkin mass .",
    "it thus raises the non - trivial question on how to continue this solution beyond the larkin length . before doing so",
    ", we will first examine a second point of view , more familiar from standard rg arguments .",
    "the standard rg approach amounts to construct and compute the @xmath25-function of the theory , and then search for a fixed point ( function ) which describes the large scale physics .",
    "usually , finding the basin of attraction of the fixed point , or relating arbitrary initial conditions to the final approach of the fixed point is an unmanageably difficult task .",
    "it is fortunately also besides the goal of the rg which is to compute universal large scale physics independently of the irrelevant details of the bare model . here",
    ", however , because of the large-@xmath1 limit , we can integrate the rg flow exactly and in principle `` solve '' any bare model .",
    "let us temporarily ignore this integrability feature and focus on finding the zeroes of the @xmath25-function .",
    "the @xmath25-function was derived previously within an @xmath21 expansion and non - analytic fixed points were found to one loop @xcite and also to two loops @xcite . in the latter case",

    "let us follow the same strategy and ask whether we can find non - trivial fixed points .",
    "let us study @xmath16 and use the equivalent linear form of the frg equation .",
    "we want to find the solutions @xmath372 of @xmath386 @xmath387 is a fixed number ( we want to impose @xmath388 ) , since we are looking for a fixed point function .",
    "keeping @xmath387 arbitrary , one first tries a linear solution @xmath389 which yields @xmath390 and @xmath391 . writing @xmath392",
    "one finds a homogeneous equation for @xmath381 and thus @xmath393 imposing now @xmath388 , i.e.  @xmath394 , fixes the value of @xmath395 and one finds the _ family of zero temperature fixed point _",

    "finally , for @xmath405 we find the fixed point : @xmath406 an important observation is that all of these fixed points exhibit automatically the expected cusp .",
    "indeed one finds that @xmath407 , i.e.  @xmath375 in ( [ fixedpoints ] ) vanishes and has a minimum at @xmath408 : @xmath409 this gives @xmath410 with @xmath411 , implying that the second derivative diverges as @xmath412 @xmath413 recalling that @xmath414 we see that all fixed points with @xmath415 correspond to a power - law long - range correlator @xmath349 , while @xmath416 corresponds to a gaussian short range disorder . if we follow the standard rg arguments , we can now sort the models ( [ correlator ] ) into these universality classes . since for the bare model @xmath417 and since the decay of @xmath15 in ( [ correlator ] ) at large @xmath10 can be argued to be identical for @xmath257 and @xmath348 ( for lr fixed points ) we find @xmath418 or @xmath416 for short range correlations .",
    "these values are valid to dominant order in @xmath12 . in @xcite",

    "several important remarks are in order .",
    "first we have found the fixed points of the inverted linear form ( [ linear ] ) of the frg equation .",

    "second we have found fixed points _ assuming _ that @xmath424 . since this is _ different _ from what has been found previously in ( [ dy0 ] ) at @xmath16 , one can ask whether these result are compatible .",
    "these two questions have a common answer .",
    "examining more closely what has really been done in this section , we note that it is equivalent to declaring both ( [ frg2 ] ) and ( [ linear ] ) valid for any @xmath397 and interpreting everywhere @xmath425 in ( [ linear ] ) and , equivalently @xmath426 as @xmath427 defined by continuity as @xmath412 .",
    "this is legitimate since the transformation from ( [ frg2 ] ) to ( [ linear ] ) is certainly valid for @xmath397 and we note that this answer the second question above since eq .",
    "( [ y ] ) , i.e.  the derivative of ( [ frg2 ] ) , evaluated at @xmath412 yields : @xmath428 which works both in the regime @xmath429 where the solution is analytic @xmath430 and in the fixed point regime @xmath117 when the cusp has developed and the last term in ( [ cusp ] ) has a non - zero limit according to ( [ bp],[bpp ] ) .",
    "we expect these fixed points to be the physically correct solutions at small @xmath45 .",
    "we now investigate whether we can confirm this by providing the solution at infinite @xmath1 , for arbitrary mass @xmath45 , i.e continue our solution ( [ self ] ) beyond the larkin length .      we now show that one can connect the two regimes , i.e.  the regime for @xmath431 where an analytic solution exists to the asymptotic one , for @xmath117 , studied in the previous section . this can be done here because of the full integrability of the infinite-@xmath1 limit and provides a rare and non - trivial insight into what happens around the larkin scale .",
    "it is instructive to start our analysis with the specific power law models with lr correlations ( [ corrlr ] ) , together with the case of sr correlations ( [ corrsr ] ) , in the form of a gaussian .",

    "the authors defined , for each configuration of the disorder , an `` effective random potential '' @xmath698 for a given mode ( e.g.  the zero mode ) . starting from the mp solution ( [ mpproba ] ) , they computed the second cumulant of @xmath699 and showed that it exhibits a non - analyticity , reminiscent of the one found in the frg .",

    "reexpressed in the variables of the present work , the result of @xcite reads : @xmath711 where @xmath712 is a constant .",
    "because of the different rescaling , the non - analytic term has a coefficient growing with the system size , which expresses again that it is not an effective action .",
    "however , since the @xmath713 term is simply the bare disorder , and the non - analytic term involves only the larkin scale @xmath700 , it seems that this carries information for and only for the physics below and around the larkin length , and does not contain any information about large scale behavior .",
    "thus , despite exhibiting shock behavior at the larkin scale , we think it has little to do with the frg as a perturbative method to obtain large scale behavior . not surprisingly then , @xmath710 is non - perturbative in @xmath2 , contrarily to the one obtained in standard frg , which is of order @xmath714 .",
    "another important difference with the present approach is the scaling with @xmath1 .",
    "the approach of @xcite used the unperturbed mp saddle point and thus , as was extensively discussed in the previous section , it focuses on @xmath715 while we focus on @xmath716 , ( i.e.  @xmath717 there and @xmath718 here ) .",
    "further work is needed to connect these regimes . on the other hand it seems that the thermal boundary layer can be found within this approach .",
    "in this paper we have studied the frg at large @xmath1 . from an exact saddle point calculation of the replicated effective action at large @xmath1 we have derived the exact renormalization group equation , valid in any dimension @xmath0 for infinite @xmath1 , for the field theory of pinning .",
    "it is expressed as the @xmath25-function for the second cumulant of the disorder correlator , and is exact as the second cumulant satisfies a remarkably simple closed equation . to order @xmath19",
    "it agrees with the one derived by balents and fisher .",
    "this result teaches us a lot about how the frg works and helps put the frg approach to the @xmath21 expansion on more solid grounds . since here",
    "the frg flow equation is formally equivalent to a self - consistent saddle point equation , it is fully integrable , i.e.  one can follow the rg flow from any initial condition .",
    "it is thus possible to examine in detail what happens around the larkin length and how the disorder correlator develops the non - analyticity .",
    "let us emphasize that this is the first time that the emergence of non - analytic behaviour in the frg is proven rigourously , beyond perturbative calculations .",
    "indeed , the 1-loop frg is insufficient per se to provide such a proof since the runaway of @xmath719 could very well be argued to be the analog of the famous landau ghost , i.e.  a flow to a strong coupling fixed point without the need , or better the possibility , for renormalization within a non - analytic functional space .",
    "here we demonstrate that this is not the case , at least for infinite @xmath1 .",
    "if we had restricted the analysis to the self - consistent equation , the continuation beyond the larkin scale would have seemed quite problematic .",
    "remarkably , the frg equation , equivalent below the larkin scale , provides an unambiguous way to continue the flow equation beyond the larkin scale .",
    "even more remarkably , its solution reproduces exactly the small overlap result of the full rsb solution of mp , a non - trivial result which , within mp , can not be obtained without constructing the full rsb solution .",
    "the mechanism for this seems to be that the frg solution in that case naturally satisfies the so - called marginality condition .",
    "in fact , it turns out to be equivalent to it , and we were able to find a formula yielding the complete rsb solution for all overlaps .",
    "this is striking since we did not make any assumption about parisi rsb .",
    "we avoided the issue altogether by using a method where rsb is not spontaneous , but explicit .",
    "given that the validity of the parisi ansatz , e.g.  for the sk model , has not yet been proven ( despite recent progress @xcite ) , it is interesting to find a method which does _ not _ rely on rsb .",
    "in fact there may well be deeper connections to be unveiled between the parisi algebra of ultrametric matrices and the type of singular differential equations arising in the frg .",
    "another example where a rsb solution can equivalently be obtained via an rg type equation is the derrida spohn solution of the dp on the cayley tree @xcite .",
    "this has inspired a similar solution for a model with translationally invariant disorder in @xcite .",
    "we have thus shown agreement with the main results of the full and the marginal one - step rsb solutions of mezard - parisi .",
    "this is also interesting since it has been widely debated @xcite whether the rsb method captures the physics : our results raise no doubt for infinite @xmath1 .",
    "more puzzling is the situation for sr disorder . there mp find both a stable replica symmetric solution and a 1-step solution where minimization over the breakpoint has to be enforced ( marginality condition violated ) . for gaussian disorder",
    "both solutions of mp have @xmath720 .",
    "similarly the frg naturally finds the finite temperature rs solution with @xmath720 ( and one fixed point solution at @xmath16 with @xmath416 ) .",
    "a non - analytic solution also seems to exist in the frg , and work is in progress to analyze it further and elucidate whether it is related to the non - marginal 1-step solution of mp .",
    "let us note that in @xmath13 we essentially know that ( apart from @xmath489 ) rsb does not hold at finite @xmath1 ( the phase transition predicted by the gvm in that case must go away at finite @xmath1 , @xmath281 ) . so there is little doubt that the correct branch at finite @xmath1 is the rs one , as also given by the frg .",
    "for the dp problem with @xmath8 on the other hand , it is not yet clear whether both branches ( a @xmath16 fixed point starting from @xmath416 or a finite @xmath44 non - analytic solution with @xmath720 ) can coexist .",
    "one scenario is that they would cross over at some lower value of @xmath721 yielding the upper critical dimension of kpz .",
    "the calculation of the frg @xmath25-function to next order in @xmath12 should shed light on this question , and is thus of high interest .",
    "it is presented in @xcite .",
    "our method thus provides a unique candidate for a field theory of the strong - coupling phase .",
    "to summarize , the present method is promising in solving mean field models , by using explicit rather than spontaneous rsb .",
    "it would be of interest to investigate whether other models like the sk - model could be solved via the same route .",
    "more importantly , it may open an alternative road to tackle disordered systems from a different direction than expanding around rsb saddle points , a task which still has to be accomplished .",
    "of course , in the end , the same difficulties may be in store .",
    "they could hide in the subtelties due to the non - analytic behaviour of the @xmath25-function at large @xmath1 .",
    "however we are optimistic , since we have understood the infinite-@xmath1 limit , at least in the full - rsb case .",
    "also , a solution has been found for @xmath9 to two @xcite and three loop order @xcite , and for finite @xmath1 at 2-loop order .",
    "let us close by indicating that many extensions of this work are possible and some in progress .",
    "one example is the random field problem , still under intense debate @xcite , for which we have also computed @xcite the effective action at large @xmath1 , and at 2-loop order .",
    "finally , the same method applies to the dynamics , classical or quantum : it has been shown @xcite that the mode - coupling approximation in glasses @xcite identifies with ( non - marginal ) mean field ( large @xmath1 ) dynamics , exhibiting aging solutions .",
    "however this picture leaves out thermally activated processes , and our @xmath12 method may be promnising there too .",
