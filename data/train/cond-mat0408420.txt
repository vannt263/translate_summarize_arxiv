    "the renormalization group and associated flow equations @xcite is one of the cornerstones of modern physics and one of the very few potentially non - perturbative techniques available to us .",
    "not only does the renormalization group allow the construction of low - energy effective theories for interacting quantum systems , but it also allows us to probe the phase structure of such systems .",
    "it is probably for this reason that considerable interest was generated in the flow equations recently proposed by wegner @xcite and independently by glazek and wilson @xcite as well as its demonstrated close relation to the renormalization group @xcite .",
    "further applications of the flow equations , based on successive infinitesimal unitary transformations , to diverse quantum mechanical problems followed , which included the treatment of the electron - phonon coupling @xcite , the spin - boson hamiltonian @xcite , the hubbard model @xcite , the sine - gordon model @xcite and the foldy - wouthuysen transformation @xcite .",
    "the lipkin model has been particularly prominent among applications @xcite , probably because it is a many - body model that can be solved numerically quite easily , but which exhibits a non - trivial quantum phase transition @xcite and could therefore shed light on the practical implementation of these flow equations in a simple , and yet non - trivial setting .",
    "one difficulty encountered in the practical implementation of the renormalization group and flow equations is that the hamiltonian does not preserve its form under the flow and that additional operators , not present in the original hamiltonian , are generated @xcite .",
    "the generic situation therefore yields an infinite set of nonlinear coupled differential equations for the coupling constants , and some form of truncation is required .",
    "one way of doing this is through a perturbative implementation of the renormalization group equations , which corresponds to a systematic expansion in the coupling constant .",
    "of course this procedure becomes invalid when flow to strong coupling occurs and non - perturbative aspects of the problem at hand can not be probed in this way . in the context of the wegner flow equation",
    "this issue has been dealt with in all the applications mentioned above by parameterizing the flowing hamiltonian and then attempting to close on a finite set of equations through some approximation .",
    "this procedure failed completely in situations where the system exhibited non - perturbative features , such as the quantum phase transition in the lipkin model @xcite , where the coupling simply flows to infinity .",
    "a more detailed discussion on the role of truncation in the accuracy of the flow equation can be found in @xcite .    in a previous paper one of",
    "the present authors suggested a self - consistent implementation of the wegner flow equation which yielded good results in both phases of the lipkin model @xcite .",
    "the central idea of this approach was a systematic expansion of the flow equation in the fluctuations around the ground state expectation value , which is controlled by the inverse of the number of particles in the system , instead of the coupling constant .",
    "this resulted in an effective non - perturbative implementation of the flow equation , explaining its success in describing both phases of the lipkin model .",
    "however , the approach as outlined in @xcite made use of specific features of the lipkin model and was only successful in describing the low - energy behaviour , while it fails in producing the excitation energies of higher states correctly .",
    "here we describe a generalization of this approach which can be applied to any finite dimensional hamiltonian ( see the next section for further elaboration ) and which succeeds in producing the full spectrum and expectation values correctly .    to set the scene and the notation we start with a brief review of the wegner flow equation .",
    "the central idea behind the flow equation is to diagonalize the hamiltonian with a family of successive infinitesimal unitary transformations , @xmath0 , parameterized by a flow parameter @xmath1 and generated by some appropriate anti - hermitian operator @xmath2 , i.e. , @xmath3 . the resulting equation that determines the flow of the transformed hamiltonian @xmath4 is @xmath5\\,.\\ ] ]    in wegner s original formulation the generator @xmath2 was chosen as the commutator of the diagonal part of the flowing hamiltonian @xmath6 in some basis with the hamiltonian itself , i.e. , @xmath7 $ ] and it was shown that the final hamiltonian @xmath8 will be diagonal in the chosen basis @xcite . here",
    "we allow a slightly more general formulation of the flow equation and consider a generator @xmath9 $ ] where it is assumed that the eigenvalues and eigenstates of @xmath10 are known ( note that @xmath10 is @xmath1 independent ) .",
    "it is easy to prove that the final hamiltonian @xmath8 is diagonal in the basis of @xmath10 if the spectrum of @xmath10 is non - degenerate , else it will assume a block diagonal structure .",
    "the proof rests on the following observation : @xmath11^\\dagger[h_0,h(\\ell)])<0.\\ ] ] thus @xmath12 is a monotonically decreasing function of @xmath1 which is bounded from below by zero .",
    "this implies that the derivative must vanish in the @xmath13 limit , and since the right - hand side of ( [ diagproof ] ) is simply the trace norm of @xmath14 $ ] this in turn implies that @xmath15=0 $ ] .",
    "furthermore it can be shown @xcite that the eigenvalues of @xmath16 , as they appear on the diagonal of @xmath8 , have the same ordering as the eigenvalues of @xmath10 .    in section 2",
    "we describe the general parameterization on which our approach is based and outline the general derivation of the flow equation as an expansion in terms of the fluctuations .",
    "we briefly discuss the general properties of the resulting flow equation , which now takes the form of an ordinary ( in contrast to operator valued ) nonlinear partial differential equation , and describe how the spectrum and expectation values can be computed . in section 3",
    "we apply this method to the lipkin model where the calculations can be done simply and explicitly . in section 4 the results obtained by solving the resulting flow equation",
    "numerically are compared in detail with the exact results .",
    "the flow equation provides some interesting new perspectives on the phase transition and the general properties of the spectrum in the second phase .",
    "we conclude in section 5 with a summary , an outline of future applications and outstanding issues .",
    "the technicalities and proofs are given in three appendices .",
    "we consider the flow of a real , hermitian operator @xmath6 which acts on a finite dimensional hilbert space @xmath17 . here",
    "we have in mind applications to systems with a finite ( but large ) number of degrees of freedom such as interacting fermions or spins on a finite sized lattice where one is in particular interested in studying the behaviour of the system as a function of size . for the moment",
    "we only consider systems in which there is no breaking of time reversal symmetry .",
    "breaking of time reversal symmetry can be dealt with at the expense of a generalization of the expansion ( [ fexpandflux ] ) and correspondingly the relations ( [ 2ndorder ] ) discussed below .",
    "the restriction to a finite dimensional hilbert space is made here since the expansion ( [ expansion ] ) below is easily proven in this case ( see [ appa ] ) .",
    "it is , however , by no means essential .",
    "if the hilbert space is infinite dimensional the expansion ( [ expansion ] ) still applies to bounded operators @xcite and one may study the flow of a bounded function of the hamiltonian , instead of the hamiltonian itself . alternatively one can introduce a cut - off in some basis , e.g. , a momentum cut - off and study the behaviour of the system as a function of the cut - off .    as mentioned in the introduction the usual method of closing the flow equation",
    "consists of replacing @xmath6 by an approximate parameterized form , and then solving for the parameters as functions of @xmath1 .",
    "this approach invariably fails at large coupling or when the system exhibits non - perturbative features as the approximate parameterization of @xmath6 breaks down .",
    "we abandon this approach in favour of a representation for @xmath6 which is both exact and very general .",
    "let @xmath10 and @xmath18 be hermitian operators acting on @xmath17 which together form an irreducible set .",
    "what follows holds for any irreducible set , however , the case of two operators appear naturally in flow equations as the hamiltonian can be written in the form @xmath19 where the spectrum and eigenstates of @xmath10 are known .",
    "note that if @xmath10 and @xmath18 are reducible on @xmath17 , but irreducible on a proper subspace of @xmath17 , the problem can be restricted to this smaller subspace making the irreducibility of @xmath10 and @xmath18 a very natural requirement .",
    "in [ appa ] it is shown that any operator acting on @xmath17 can be written as a polynomial in @xmath10 and @xmath18 .",
    "in particular this holds for @xmath6 so we may write @xmath20 where each @xmath21 coefficient is a function of @xmath1 and repeated indices indicate sums over @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "since @xmath6 is both hermitian and real it follows that the @xmath24 s are invariant under the reversal of indices : @xmath25 now define @xmath26 as the fluctuation of @xmath27 around the expectation value @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is some arbitrary state . by setting @xmath30 in equation ( [ genparamh ] )",
    "we obtain @xmath6 as an expansion in these fluctuations @xmath31 where @xmath32 and so forth .",
    "note that @xmath33 , when viewed as a function of @xmath1 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 , encodes information about all the expansion coefficients @xmath21 appearing in equation ( [ expansion ] ) .",
    "a natural strategy that presents itself is to set up an equation for @xmath33 as a function of @xmath1 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 in some domain @xmath36 of the @xmath34@xmath35 plane , determined by the properties of the operators @xmath10 and @xmath18 .",
    "in particular we require that this domain includes values of @xmath34 ranging from the largest to the smallest eigenvalues of @xmath10 .",
    "for this purpose we require a family of states @xmath37 parameterized by a continuous set of variables @xmath38 such that as @xmath39 is varied over the domain @xmath40 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 range continuously over the domain @xmath36 . a very general set of states that meets these requirements are coherent states @xcite . in this representation we may consider @xmath34 and @xmath35 as continuous variables with each @xmath33 a function of @xmath34 , @xmath35 and the following relations hold generally : @xmath41 coefficients with three or more indices can not be written in this way , since , for example , @xmath42 need not be equal to @xmath43 .",
    "the general relationship between the true coefficients and derivatives of @xmath33 are @xmath44 where the sum over @xmath45 is over all the distinct ways of ordering @xmath46 zeros and @xmath47 ones .",
    "for example @xmath48 replacing @xmath49 by the left - hand side of the equation above is equivalent to approximating @xmath49 by the average of @xmath49,@xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "in general this amounts to approximating @xmath52 by the average of the coefficients corresponding to all the distinct reorderings of @xmath53 .    to set up an equation for @xmath54 we insert the expansion ( [ expansion1 ] ) into the flow equation ( [ flow ] ) with @xmath9 $ ] and",
    "take the expectation value with respect to the state @xmath37 .",

    "are naturally functions of @xmath39 and may be written as functions of @xmath34 and @xmath58 by inverting the equations @xmath59 to obtain @xmath60 . with an appropriately chosen state , such as a coherent state ,",
    "the higher orders in the fluctuation can often be neglected , as the expansion is controlled by the inverse of the number of degrees of freedom ( see [ appc ] for an explicit example ) . upon doing this",
    "we note that replacing the @xmath61 s with more than two indices by a derivative will introduce corrections in ( [ flow1 ] ) of an order higher than the terms already listed , or , on the level of the operator expansion , corrections higher than second order in the fluctuations . working to second order in the fluctuations we can",
    "therefore safely replace @xmath61 by the derivatives of a function @xmath62 and write for @xmath6 : @xmath63 where @xmath64 denotes the anti - commutator and @xmath65 this turns the flow equation ( [ flow1 ] ) into a nonlinear partial differential equation for @xmath66 , correct up to the order shown in ( [ flow1 ] ) .",
    "the choice of coherent state , the corresponding calculation of the fluctuations appearing in equation ( [ flow1 ] ) and the identification of the parameter controlling the expansion are problem specific",
    ". therefore we focus for the rest of this paper on a specific example , namely the lipkin model , where all the calculations can be done explicitly .",
    "we would , however , like to emphasize that the results obtained here for the lipkin model go well beyond any results previously obtained for the lipkin or any other model within the context of the wegner flow equations .    before embarking on the discussion of the lipkin model",
    ", there are a number of general statements that can be made about the flow equation ( [ flow1 ] ) and the behaviour of @xmath66 . the first property to be noted is that since @xmath8 is diagonal in the eigenbasis of @xmath10 it should become a function of only @xmath10 , provided that the spectrum of @xmath10 is non - degenerate .",
    "this is reflected in the behaviour of @xmath67 by the fact that @xmath68 should be a function of @xmath34 only .",
    "this is indeed borne out to high accuracy in our later numerical investigations .",
    "this function in turn provides us with the functional dependence of @xmath8 on @xmath10 .",
    "keeping in mind the unitary connection between @xmath8 and @xmath69 this enables us to compute the eigenvalues of @xmath69 straightforwardly by inserting the supposedly known eigenvalues of @xmath10 into the function @xmath70 .",
    "a second point to note is that the considerations above apply to the flow of an arbitrary real hermitian operator .",
    "it is easily verified that the transformed operator @xmath71 satisfies the flow equation : @xmath72\\,\\ ] ] where the same choice of @xmath2 as for the hamiltonian has to be made , i.e. , @xmath9 $ ] .",
    "the expansion ( [ fexpandflux ] ) can be made for both operators @xmath6 and @xmath73 .",
    "denoting the corresponding function for @xmath73 by @xmath74 the flow equation ( [ flow2 ] ) turns into a linear partial differential equation for @xmath74 containing the function @xmath66 , which is determined by the nonlinear partial differential equation ( [ flow1 ] ) .",
    "the expectation value of @xmath75 in an eigenstate @xmath76 of @xmath69 can be expressed as @xmath77 where @xmath78 . in the limit",
    "@xmath13 the states @xmath79 are simply the eigenstates of @xmath10 , which are supposedly known . in this way the computation of the expectation value @xmath80 can be translated into the calculation of expectation values of the operator @xmath81 , obtained by solving the flow equation ( [ flow2 ] ) , in the known eigenstates of @xmath10 .",
    "the lipkin model describes @xmath82 fermions distributed over two @xmath83-fold degenerate levels separated by an energy of @xmath84 .",

    "as suggested by the notation , we choose to represent flowing operators in terms of @xmath10 and @xmath18 as described in section [ genrepsec ] .",
    "however @xmath124 is not an irreducible set , since both leave the subspace spanned by @xmath125 invariant .",
    "as pointed out earlier this is easily remedied by restricting ourselves to this subspace .",
    "however , it turns out that in this case an expansion of the form ( [ expansion ] ) can , as a consequence of the particular choice of the generator , even be found in the reducible case .",
    "indeed , we may write @xmath6 as @xmath126 where the @xmath127 s and @xmath128 s are the diagonal and off - diagonal coefficients respectively . this can be verified by inspection of the flow equation which shows that no new terms are generated .",

    "this statement can be made precise as follows .",
    "since the flowing hamiltonian is extensive @xmath67 should be proportional to @xmath140 , as is the case with @xmath34 and @xmath35 . to keep track of the orders of @xmath140 we introduce the scaleless variables @xmath141 , @xmath142 and @xmath143 . when taking the inner - product with respect to @xmath144 on both sides of ( [ lipkinhexp ] ) the linear terms fall away and we obtain @xmath145 each term is , up to a constant factor , of the form @xmath146 where @xmath147 denotes some arbitrary product of @xmath148 fluctuations . using the results of [ appc ] we see that such a term is at most of order @xmath149 in @xmath140 .",
    "the leading order term corresponds to @xmath150 , i.e. the scalar term @xmath67 .",
    "we conclude that @xmath67 is the leading order contribution to @xmath139 , expressed not as a function of @xmath151 and @xmath152 , but rather of the averages @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",

    "it is assumed that @xmath154 is a hermitian operator constructed in terms of @xmath10 and @xmath18 .",
    "furthermore @xmath156 must be a rational function of @xmath140 , which ensures that when taking derivatives of @xmath157 no additional factors of @xmath140 are generated .",

    "in section [ lipkinflow ] it was mentioned that @xmath6 retains its band diagonal structure during flow , which meant that @xmath18 appeared only linearly in the representation of @xmath6 .",

    "recall that in the @xmath209 limit @xmath6 flows toward a diagonal form , furthermore the eigenvalues appear on the diagonal in the same order as in @xmath10 , i.e. increasing from top to bottom .",
    "this implies that the @xmath210 eigenvalue of @xmath69 is given by @xmath211 where @xmath212 corresponds to the ground state energy . as @xmath6 flows towards a diagonal form the terms of expansion ( [ expand2 ] ) containing @xmath18 will disappear and eventually @xmath8 and @xmath67 will become functions of @xmath10 and @xmath34 only .",

    "since @xmath18 does not appear we see that when taking the inner product with @xmath214 only the scaler term , @xmath67 , will survive .",
    "the results of this procedure appear in section [ numspectrum ] .",
    "next we return to the arbitrary operator @xmath154 introduced earlier , and show how its expectation values with respect to the eigenstates of @xmath69 may be calculated . as examples we consider the first and second moments of @xmath218 in the ground state .",
    "the former is simply related to the order parameter @xmath83 discussed in section [ lipkinmodel ] .",
    "suppose @xmath154 is a hermitian operator having the properties mentioned in section [ flowinf ] .",
    "the aim is to calculate @xmath80 where @xmath76 is the ( unknown ) eigenstate of @xmath111 corresponding to the energy @xmath108 .",
    "we can formulate this calculation in terms of a flow equation by noting that @xmath77 where @xmath78 , @xmath219 and @xmath0 is the unitary operator associated with the flow of @xmath6 .",
    "this equation holds for all @xmath1 , and particularly in the @xmath13 limit .",
    "since @xmath123 it follows that @xmath220 and we conclude that the expectation value of @xmath154 in the @xmath210 eigenstate of @xmath69 is simply the @xmath210 diagonal element of @xmath81 in the @xmath10 basis .",
    "furthermore @xmath221 has the character of a generating function in the sense that @xmath222 thus knowing @xmath180 , which is just @xmath221 up to leading order in @xmath140 , is sufficient to obtain all the matrix elements of @xmath73 with high accuracy .",
    "however , unless an analytic solution for @xmath180 is known , we are limited to numerical calculations for the low lying states .",
    "in particular , the ground state expectation value is found by setting @xmath223 .",
    "consider the case where @xmath224 and @xmath225 . here",
    "@xmath73 will flow from a diagonal form to one containing high powers of @xmath18 .",
    "having no knowledge about the form of @xmath180 we must solve the flow equation directly as a linear pde in 3 variables .",
    "for numerical implementation we again change to the variables @xmath45 , @xmath182 and solve on the strip @xmath226 $ ] , @xmath227 $ ] . as before we impose the boundary condition @xmath228 .",
    "it turns out that the solution for @xmath229 is virtually independent of the boundary condition imposed at @xmath230 ( this is in fact also true for @xmath67 or @xmath184 and @xmath185 ) and in this case we simply allow the solution to evolve freely at @xmath230 .",
    "the results of this calculation is shown in section [ numorder ] .",
    "the ability to calculate expectation values for the class of operators discussed above allows us to probe the eigenstates in a variety of ways .",
    "we will consider diagonal operators of the form @xmath231 where @xmath232 is a smooth , @xmath140-independent function defined on @xmath233 $ ] . since @xmath10 is non - degenerate its powers span the space of diagonal operators , and so @xmath234 can always be expressed as a function of @xmath10 . in order to apply the flow equation to @xmath234 we must find the initial condition for equation ( [ couplesetforhandn ] ) , which is given by @xmath235 the expansion coefficients for the coherent state in the @xmath106 basis are given by @xcite @xmath236 which , together with a change of variables from @xmath237 to @xmath238 , lead to @xmath239 this is recognized as the bernstein polynomial @xcite for @xmath240 of degree @xmath241 on the interval @xmath233 $ ] .",
    "it is well known that in the @xmath153 limit this polynomial approximation converges uniformly to @xmath240 , from which we conclude that the boundary condition of the flow equation is simply @xmath242 .",
    "+ suppose @xmath243 is the eigenstate under consideration , in which case @xmath244 this leads to the interpretation of the expectation value as an average of the expansion coefficients @xmath245 , weighted by the function @xmath240 .",
    "it may appear that choosing @xmath234 to be the projection operator onto some basis state @xmath246 provides the most direct means of calculating the contributions of individual states .",
    "however the projection operator does not fall within the class of operators for which equation ( [ couplesetforhandn ] ) was derived .",
    "this follows from the fact that when taking derivatives of @xmath247 new factors of @xmath140 are generated , which is equivalent to the observation that no continuous function @xmath240 exists such that @xmath248 for all @xmath140 .",
    "instead we choose @xmath249 where @xmath250 $ ] and @xmath251 .",
    "this weight function focuses on the contribution of those basis states @xmath246 for which @xmath252 lies in a narrow region centered around @xmath253 .",
    "considered as functions of @xmath253 , it is expected that @xmath254 would approximate @xmath255 up to a constant factor , provided that the latter varies slowly on the scale of @xmath256 in the region of @xmath253 .",
    "clearly @xmath257 controls the accuracy of this method , and also determines the scale on which the structure of the eigenstates can be resolved .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     against the background of the discussion above , the presence of a point of inflection at higher energies for values of @xmath258 presents the interesting interpretation of a quantum phase transition at higher energies . to illustrate that this is indeed a sensible interpretation we show the expectation value @xmath259 at @xmath260 as a function of @xmath168 , i.e. , as evaluated in the excited states , in figure [ orderex ] ( b ) .",
    "one clearly sees a change in the behaviour at the point of inflection . indeed , after this point the behaviour of this quantity is linear , as is to be expected in the first phase , so that one can think of this point as a transition from the second phase , present at lower energies , to the first phase at still higher energies .",
    "this interpretation is summarized in a phase diagram in figure [ orderex ] ( c ) which shows the @xmath102 dependancy of a subset of the negative , even eigenvalues . for @xmath261",
    "the eigenvalues are confined between @xmath22 and @xmath262 .",
    "as @xmath102 increases first the groundstate ( shown in bold ) and then the excited states begin to cross the @xmath263 phase boundary until eventually , in the large coupling limit , only the @xmath264 state retains its first phase character . for finite @xmath140 successive eigenvalues",
    "show avoided level crossings on the phase boundary . in the thermodynamic limit",
    "one would , however , expect that successive eigenvalues will coalesce as they cross the phase boundary ; signalling a vanishing gap .",
    "keeping in mind the symmetry @xmath265 , these remarks can easily be adapted for the positive half of the spectrum as well .",
    "next we present results for the expectation values , computed according to the method described in section [ expval ] .",
    "figure [ gr1 ] ( c ) shows the order parameter @xmath266 as a function of @xmath102 together with the exact values for @xmath267 .",
    "again we find excellent agreement , even at the phase transition , with absolute errors in the range of @xmath268 .",
    "the second moment of @xmath106 is found by choosing @xmath269 , for which @xmath270 .",
    "proceeding as before we obtain the expectation value of @xmath154 as a function of @xmath102 , which appears , together with the exact result for @xmath267 , in figure [ gr1 ] ( d ) .",
    "note that the computation of the expectation values of different operators entails solving the _ same _ partial differential equation , but with different initial conditions . in this sense",
    "the flow equation only knows about the operator being computed through the initial conditions .",
    "+    we follow the strategy discussed in section [ eigenstates ] and consider the flow of the operator @xmath271 for @xmath249 and @xmath272 .",
    "the resulting ground state expectation values for @xmath273 and a range of @xmath253 values appear in figure [ eigstruc ] .",
    "the exact values of @xmath274 , calculated from direct diagonalization , are shown as functions of @xmath168 . since",
    "the ground state lies within the subspace spanned by even basis states we completely neglect the coefficients corresponding to odd states . as before the flow equations can not distinguish these two subspaces on this level , and only provide information on the average contribution of a range of both even and odd basis states .",
    "as expected , larger values of @xmath257 provide a more accurate probing of the eigenstate , and for @xmath275 we obtain a good approximation for the form of the absolute wave function at large @xmath140 in the @xmath106 basis .    in the first phase a very small subset of basis states has nonzero overlap with the ground state .",
    "this implies that , as a function of @xmath168 , @xmath276 will vary on a length scale which can not easily be probed using this method .",
    "however , by considering @xmath277 and keeping in mind that @xmath278 we conclude from figure [ gr1 ] ( c ) and ( d ) that @xmath279 is approximately equal to @xmath280 when @xmath281 .",
    "we have shown that the flow equations based on continuous unitary transformations can be cast in the form of a general nonlinear partial differential equation involving one flow and two system specific auxiliary variables .",
    "this approach is based on the observation that operators acting on finite dimensional hilbert spaces , or bounded operators acting on infinite dimensional hilbert spaces , may be written as polynomials in a set of irreducible operators , specifically two in the case of the flow equation . making an expansion to second order in the fluctuations yields the aforementioned flow equation .",
    "it is shown how the spectrum and expectation values can be extracted from the solution of this equation .",
    "the method is applied to the lipkin model where all the calculations can be done easily and explicitly .",
    "excellent results for the full spectrum and expectation values are obtained .",
    "it was illustrated how properties of the eigenstates can be investigated by considering the flow of certain diagonal operators .",
    "further information about the eigenstates , for example the relative phases of expansion coefficients , could possibly be obtained by extending this strategy to off - diagonal operators , or by considering the flow of @xmath0 itself .",
    "the flow equation also provides some interesting new insights into the nature of the quantum phase transition .",
    "a further possible extension of this approach is to study time dependent problems .",
    "of course , once the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions have been obtained to a reliable accuracy one can , in principle , determine the time dependency of the system .",
    "we would , however , like to find a more economical way of computing the time dependency .",
    "further possible applications to lattice models are currently being investigated . in particular one - dimensional lattice models",
    "should be amenable to this approach as they are in structure very similar to the lipkin model .",
    "indeed , the lipkin model can be viewed as a lattice model with position dependent hopping amplitude and a linear potential .",
    "the authors acknowledge financial support from the national research foundation of south africa .",
    "we also acknowledge useful discussions with h b geyer and w d heiss .",
    "in section [ genrepsec ] we made use of the fact that any flowing operator may be expressed in terms of operators coming from an irreducible set which contains the identity .",
    "now we show why this is the case , using a result by von neumann .",
    "first we establish some notation .",
    "let @xmath17 be a finite dimensional hilbert space and denote by @xmath282 the set of all matrix operators acting on it .",
    "the commutant @xmath283 of a set @xmath284 is defined as the set of operators which commute with all the elements of @xmath285 .",
    "the double commutant of @xmath285 is defined by @xmath286 .",
    "the following theorem @xcite provides the key :    * the double commutant theorem : * _ if @xmath287 is a subalgebra of @xmath282 which contains the identity and is closed under hermitian conjugation then @xmath288 .",
    "_    now suppose @xmath289 is an irreducible set of hermitian operators , one of which is the identity , and @xmath287 the subalgebra of @xmath282 spanned by all the products of operators from @xmath290 . by schur",
    "s lemma @xmath291 and thus @xmath292 .",
    "it follows from the theorem above that @xmath293 , i.e. any operator acting on @xmath282 may be written in terms of operators coming from @xmath290 .",
    "define @xmath294 where @xmath295 is the unnormalized coherent state .",
    "the differential operator representations for the @xmath90 generators are given by @xcite : @xmath296 we will always consider @xmath151 and @xmath152 to be distinct variables , and that @xmath297 is a function of @xmath152 only .",
    "when calculating expectation values of the double commutators in section [ genrepsec ] , one encounters expressions of the form @xmath298 where @xmath299 .",
    "these can easily be computed by replacing each operator by its differential representation to obtain @xmath300 where the orders of the operators have been reversed . as a result",
    "these expectation values can be expressed as some rational function of @xmath301 and @xmath302 . applying this method to @xmath34 and @xmath35",
    "we obtain @xmath303 using these equations to express @xmath237 and @xmath199 in terms of @xmath304 we may consider expectation values of the form of equation ( [ genexp ] ) as functions of these averages .",
    "for example @xmath305,(\\delta h_0)^2]|z\\rangle=8jxy , \\label{cancelexample}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath306 and @xmath307 .",
    "we wish to show that @xmath308 from direct calculation this is found to hold for @xmath309 , and we employ induction to obtain the general result . assuming that this holds for all products of @xmath310 fluctuations , the induction step consists of adding either @xmath57 or @xmath311 to a general product @xmath312 and then proving the result for @xmath313 .",
    "+ first we add an extra @xmath57 . using the results from the previous section we may write @xmath314 where ( [ hifuncrt ] ) and @xmath315 were used .",
    "it should be remembered that @xmath316 contains a @xmath151 dependency through the average appearing in each @xmath317 .",
    "dividing by @xmath318 leads to @xmath319 the last term can be rewritten using @xmath320 which is just the product rule , to obtain @xmath321 note the important cancellation of terms proportional to @xmath322 . from the induction hypothesis , and the fact that @xmath323 is polynomial in @xmath140 , the first term in ( [ finform ] ) will be of order @xmath324 .",
    "the second term becomes @xmath325 taking into account the expressions for @xmath326 and @xmath327 , we conclude that each term in equation ( [ ee ] ) will have order @xmath328 , which reduces to @xmath329 in both the cases where @xmath330 is odd and even .",
    "thus , for any product @xmath316 of @xmath330 fluctuations we arrive at @xmath331 which concludes the induction step .",
    "exactly the same procedure is followed when adding a @xmath311 , although more algebra is required as @xmath332 now contains second order derivatives to @xmath151 .",
    "the final result remains unchanged : @xmath333    in this case these results make exact the general notion that relative fluctuations scale like powers of one over the system size .",
    "finally we mention that when calculating the expectation values of a double commutator there is often a cancellation of leading order terms .",
    "this can be seen in equation ( [ cancelexample ] ) , where the sum of terms of order @xmath334 turns out to be of order @xmath140 .",
