    "the weak neutral current was a critical prediction of the electroweak standard model ( sm )  @xcite . following its discovery in 1973 by the gargamelle and hpw experiments , there were generations of ever more precise wnc experiments , typically at the few  % level .",
    "these included pure weak @xmath2 and @xmath3 scattering processes , and weak - electromagnetic interference processes such as polarized @xmath4 or @xmath5 , @xmath6 ( hadron or charged lepton ) cross sections and asymmetries below the @xmath0 pole , and parity - violating effects in heavy atoms ( apv ) .",
    "there were also early direct observations of the @xmath1 and @xmath0 by ua1 and ua2 .",
    "the early 1990 s witnessed the very precise @xmath0-pole experiments at lep and the slc , in which the lineshape , decay modes , and various asymmetries were measured at the 0.1% level .",
    "the subsequent lep 2 program at higher energies measured , searched for the higgs and other new particles , and constrained anomalous gauge self - interactions .",
    "parallel efforts at the tevatron by cdf and dled to the direct discovery of the @xmath7 and measurements of  and , while a fourth generation of weak neutral current experiments continued to search for new physics to which the ( more precise ) @xmath0-pole experiments were blind .",
    "the program was supported by theoretical efforts in the calculation of qcd , electroweak , and mixed radiative corrections ; the expectations for observables in the standard model , large classes of extensions , and alternative models ; and global analyses of the data .",
    "the precision program has established that the standard model ( sm ) is correct and unique to first approximation , establishing the gauge principle as well as the sm gauge group and representations ; shown that the sm is correct at loop level , confirming the basic principles of renormalizable gauge theory and allowing the successful prediction or constraint on @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and the higgs mass @xmath10 ; severely constrained new physics at the tev scale , with the ideas of unification favored over tev - scale dynamics or compositeness ; and yielded precise values for the gauge couplings , consistent with ( supersymmetric ) gauge unification .",
    "even before the beginning of the @xmath0-pole experiments at lep and slc in 1989 , the precision program had established  @xcite-@xcite :    * global analyses of all data carried more information than the analysis of individual experiments , but care has to be taken with systematic and theoretical uncertainties . * the sm is correct to first approximation .",
    "the four - fermion operators for @xmath11 , @xmath3 , and @xmath12 were uniquely determined , in agreement with the standard model , in model ( i.e. , gauge group ) independent analyses .",
    "the @xmath1 and @xmath0 masses agreed with the expectations of the gauge group and canonical higgs mechanism , eliminating more complicated alternative models with the same four - fermi interactions as the standard model .",
    "* qcd evolved structure functions and electroweak radiative corrections were necessary for the agreement of theory and experiment . * the weak mixing angle ( in the on - shell renormalization scheme ) was determined to be = 0.230 @xmath13 ; consistency of the various observations , including radiative corrections , required @xmath14 gev . *",
    "theoretical uncertainties , especially in the @xmath15 threshold in deep inelastic weak charge current ( wcc ) scattering , dominated . *",
    "the combination of wnc and wcc data uniquely determined the @xmath16 representations of all of the known fermions , i.e. , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , as well as the @xmath19 and @xmath20 components of the @xmath21 and @xmath15  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the left - handed @xmath22 and @xmath23 were the lower components of @xmath16 doublets , implying unambiguously that the @xmath7 quark and @xmath24 had to exist .",
    "this was independent of theoretical arguments based on anomaly cancellation ( which could have been evaded in alternative models involving a vector - like third family ) , and of constraints on  from electroweak loops . *",
    "the electroweak gauge couplings were well - determined , allowing a detailed comparison with the gauge unification predictions of the simplest grand unified theories ( gut ) .",
    "ordinary was excluded ( consistent with the non - observation of proton decay ) , but the supersymmetric extension was allowed , `` perhaps even the first harbinger of supersymmetry ''  @xcite .",
    "* there were stringent limits on new physics at the tev scale , including additional @xmath25 bosons , exotic fermions ( for which both wnc and wcc constraints were crucial ) , exotic higgs representations , leptoquarks , and new four - fermion operators .",
    "the lep / slc era greatly improved the precision of the electroweak program .",
    "it allowed the differentiation between non - decoupling extensions to the sm ( such as most forms of dynamical symmetry breaking and other types of tev - scale compositeness ) , which typically predicted several % deviations , and decoupling extensions ( such as most of the parameter space for supersymmetry ) , for which the deviations are typically 0.1% .",
    "the first phase of the lep / slc program involved running at the @xmath0 pole , @xmath26 and @xmath27 . during the period 1989 - 1995 the four lep experiments aleph , delphi , l3 , and opal at cern observed @xmath28 bosons .",
    "the sld experiment at the slc at slac observed some @xmath29 events . despite the much lower statistics , the slc had the considerable advantage of a highly polarized @xmath30 beam , with @xmath31 75% .",
    "there were quite a few @xmath0 pole observables , including :    * the lineshape : @xmath32 and the peak cross section @xmath33 . * the branching ratios for @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "one could also determine the invisible width , @xmath36 , from which one can derive the number @xmath37 of active ( weak doublet ) neutrinos with @xmath38 , i.e. , there are only 3 conventional families with light neutrinos .",
    "@xmath36 also constrains other invisible particles , such as light sneutrinos and the light majorons associated with some models of neutrino mass .",
    "* a number of asymmetries , including forward - backward ( fb ) asymmetries ; the @xmath23 polarization , @xmath39 ; the polarization asymmetry @xmath40 associated with @xmath41 ; and mixed polarization - fb asymmetries .    the expressions for the observables are summarized in  @xcite , and the experimental values and sm predictions in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "the precision of the @xmath0 mass determination was extraordinary for a high energy experiment .",
    "these combinations of observables could be used to isolate many @xmath0-fermion couplings , verify lepton family universality , determine in numerous ways , and determine or constrain , , and .",

    "the simplest non - supersymmetric unification is excluded by the precision data . for the mssm , and assuming no new thresholds between 1 tev and the unification scale , one can use the precisely known @xmath196 and @xmath221 to predict @xmath269 and a unification scale @xmath270 gev  @xcite .",
    "the  uncertainties are mainly theoretical , from the tev and gut thresholds , etc .",
    "is high compared to the experimental value , but barely consistent given the uncertainties .",
    "@xmath271 is reasonable for a gut ( and is consistent with simple seesaw models of neutrino mass ) , but is somewhat below the expectations @xmath272 gev of the simplest perturbative heterotic string models .",
    "however , this is only a 10% effect in the appropriate variable @xmath273 .",
    "the new exotic particles often present in such models ( or higher ka - moody levels ) can easily shift the @xmath273 and  predictions significantly , so the problem is really why the gauge unification works so well .",
    "it is always possible that the apparent success is accidental ( cf . ,",
    "the discovery of pluto ) .",
    "the precision @xmath0-pole , lep  2 , wnc , and tevatron experiments have successfully tested the sm at the 0.1% level , including electroweak loops , thus confirming the gauge principle , sm group , representations , and the basic structure of renormalizable field theory .",
    "the standard model parameters @xmath274 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 were precisely determined .",
    "in fact ,  was successfully predicted from its indirect loop effects prior to the direct discovery at the tevatron , while the indirect value of , mainly from the @xmath0-lineshape , agreed with more direct qcd determinations .",
    "similarly ,  and @xmath275 were constrained .",
    "the indirect ( loop ) effects implied @xmath276 gev , while direct searches at lep  2 yielded @xmath277 gev , with a hint of a signal at 116 gev .",
    "the combined direct and indirect data imply @xmath278 gev at 95% c.l .",
    "this range is consistent with , but does not prove , the expectations of the supersymmetric extension of the sm ( mssm ) , which predicts a light sm - like higgs for much of its parameter space .",
    "the agreement of the data with the sm imposes a severe constraint on possible new physics at the tev scale , and points towards decoupling theories ( such as most versions of supersymmetry and unification ) , which typically lead to 0.1% effects , rather than new tev - scale dynamics or compositeness ( e.g. , little higgs , dynamical symmetry breaking or composite fermions ) , which usually ( but not always ) imply deviations of several % , and often large flavor changing neutral currents .",
    "finally , the precisely measured gauge couplings were consistent with the simplest form of grand unification if the sm is extended to the mssm .",
