    "observations of the temperature anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , particularly those from the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) @xcite , form the foundations of the remarkably successful `` concordance '' cosmological model @xcite .",
    "an essential ingredient of this model is the assumption that the primordial density fluctuations that seeded the formation of galaxies and large - scale structure were statistically homogeneous and gaussian .",
    "versions of the inflation scenario based on the idea of a single slow - rolling scalar field predict levels of non - gaussianity too small to be observed . on the other hand ,",
    "multi - field inflation models , and models with a non - standard kinetic term for the inflaton , may yield larger non - gaussian effects which could in principle be detected in current or next - generation observations @xcite .",
    "analysis of currently available wmap data provide strong limits on the level of non - gaussianity @xcite . on the other hand , @xcite recently reported a detection of primordial non - gaussianity at greater than 99.5% significance .",
    "further detailed analyses of non - gaussianity are clearly necessary in order to reconcile and understand the various constraints and claimed detections .",
    "the greatest barrier to the detection of non - gaussianity , or other departures from the framework of the concordance cosmological model , is the presence of residual foreground contamination or other systematic errors .",
    "since our own galaxy emits at microwave frequencies , the emission from local foregrounds must be carefully cleaned before a map can be obtained that is suitable for analysis .",
    "one way of avoiding this problem is to cut out regions near the galactic plane where contamination is particularly severe , but this throws away the advantage of having full coverage .",
    "it is therefore important to produce maps that are as clean as possible over the whole sky for many purposes .",
    "however , such cleaning is inevitably approximate and biases are bound to occur @xcite .",
    "circumstantial evidence exists that may be interpreted as being due to the presence of residual galactic foregrounds in the wmap data , or some other artefact of the cleaning process @xcite , but in the absence of a more complete characterization of the galactic emission the situation remains unclear .    in this",
    "_ article _ we propose and test a simple diagnostic analysis that offers the possibility of identifying foreground - related biases and systematics in all - sky maps of the cmb .",
    "the statistical variation of the cmb temperature , @xmath4 , over the celestial sphere can be conveniently decomposed into spherical harmonic modes : @xmath5 where the @xmath6 are spherical harmonic functions , defined in terms of the legendre polynomials , @xmath7 , using @xmath8 and the @xmath9 are complex coefficients which can be expressed with @xmath10 where @xmath11 are the phases @xcite .",
    "we have adopted the condon - shortly phase definition in the spherical harmonic decomposition .",
    "the spherical harmonics functions , @xmath12 , can be visualized by considering their _ nodal lines _ , i.e. the set of points @xmath13 on the sphere where the spherical harmonics vanish , i.e. where @xmath14 .",
    "nodal lines are circles , which are either in the latitude or longitude direction with respect to the coordinate system being used ; in the case of cmb maps this is usually the galactic coordinate system .",
    "the number of nodal lines of each type is determined by the number of zeros of @xmath12 in the latitudinal and longitudinal directions independently .",
    "the associated legendre functions @xmath7 possess @xmath15 zeros in the latitude direction , whereas the trigonometric @xmath16 and @xmath17 functions possess @xmath18 zeros in the longitude direction .",
    "two specific orders @xmath1 are of particular interest at a given @xmath0 in the context of this work : these denote the _ zonal _ modes , with @xmath3 , and the _ sectoral _ modes , with @xmath19 . in the former case",
    "there are no zero - crossings in the longitude direction , so contours of equal temperature run parallel to latitude lines ; in the latter the contours run parallel to longitude lines .",
    "examples are shown in figure 1 . in the intermediate cases with @xmath20",
    "there are zero - crossings in both directions , giving rise to a patchwork appearance ; these are usually called _ tesseral _ modes .    statistically isotropic gaussian random cmb temperature fluctuations on a sphere , of the type that result from the simplest versions of the inflationary paradigm , possess spherical harmonic coefficients ( @xmath9 ) whose real and imaginary parts are mutually independent and both gaussian @xcite .",
    "the statistical properties of the fluctuations are then completely specified by the angular power spectrum , @xmath21 , where @xmath22 since @xmath23 is always real , the complex vectors of the @xmath9 on the argand plane for @xmath24 are mirror images of those with @xmath25 with respect to @xmath26 axis for even @xmath1 , and with respect to @xmath27 axis for odd @xmath1 .",
    "writing @xmath28 we note that the variances of the real and imaginary parts of @xmath9 for @xmath25 are equal @xmath29 which depends only on @xmath30 .",
    "the distributions of @xmath31 and @xmath32 are independent gaussians with these variances and zero mean .",
    "the amplitudes @xmath33 for these modes therefore have a rayleigh distribution with random phases @xcite . for @xmath3 ,",
    "the imaginary part of @xmath9 must be zero , so this mode always has zero phase @xmath34 .",
    "this is because the phase relates to the variation around the polar axis only .",
    "however , the distribution @xmath31 for @xmath3 should be equal to that of the other real parts at a given @xmath30 , namely a gaussian with zero mean and stated variance .",
    "statistical analysis of the spherical harmonics of cmb maps usually involves using all modes in an equivalent manner .",
    "however , since the zonal modes in particular have such a special relationship to the galactic coordinate system , it is worth looking at their properties independently to see whether they hold any clues to possible residual contamination aligned with the galactic plane .    in order to construct a test which involved the smallest possible number of assumptions , and in particular avoided the need to make estimates of the power - spectrum @xmath21 along the way , we focused on the modes with maximum or minimum amplitude at a given @xmath30 .",
    "if all modes are statistically equivalent then the different orders @xmath1 at a given @xmath30 are equally likely to furnish the maximum ( or minimum ) amplitude @xmath33 . a preference for modes with @xmath3 to display the maximum ( or minimum ) amplitude",
    "might therefore be plausibly interpreted as evidence that the zonal modes are either contaminated with residual foreground , or that foregrounds have been excessively subtracted .",
    "both of these possibilities are supported by other evidence @xcite .",
    "the maps analyzed in this paper are the 1-year @xcite , 3-year @xcite , and 5-year @xcite internal linear combination ( ilc ) maps from the wmap team , the 1 and 3 year maps from @xcite and the harmonic ilc map by @xcite ( hereafter ilc1 , ilc3 , ilc5 , toh1 , toh3 and hilc ) .",
    "we apply three tests to these maps , which are described in detail below .      for our first test",
    ", we analyze the value of @xmath1 associated with the largest ( or smallest ) amplitude @xmath33 for a given @xmath30 in the ranges @xmath35 $ ] and @xmath36 $ ] .",
    "since the @xmath9 for all orders @xmath1 at a given @xmath30 should have the same variance in the null hypothesis ( of a stationary gaussian random field ) , the minimum or maximum value of @xmath33 should not occur preferentially at any particular value of @xmath1 .",
    "we use a very straightforward method to establish whether this is the case .",
    "for each map we simply count the number of occurrences ( i.e. numbers of separate degrees @xmath30 within the range analyzed ) for which the minimum or maximum value amplitude occurs at @xmath3 ( the zonal mode ) or @xmath19 ( the sectoral mode ) .",
    "these counts are recorded in table [ tabnum ] .",
    "what we have done is to identify , at each degree @xmath30 , the value of @xmath1 which has the minimum ( or maximum ) value of @xmath33 .",
    "if the minimum is at @xmath3 then this contributes to the count in column 3 of the table ; if the maximum is @xmath3 it contributes to the count in column 4 ; likewise occurrences of extrema at @xmath19 contribute to the counts in the following two columns . for results where the maximum @xmath30 = 10 the counts are out of a total of 11 and for maximum @xmath30 = 20 they are out of a total of 21 .",
    ".this table shows , for the various cleaned all - sky maps described in the text , the maximum value of the degree @xmath30 considered , and , in the following four columns , the number of times ( i.e. number of values of @xmath30 ) for which the minimum ( or maximum ) amplitude @xmath9 is at @xmath3 ( zonal mode ) or @xmath19 ( sectoral mode ) . for example , the @xmath37 and max @xmath30 = 20 result for toh3 means that 11 out of 21 different values of the degree @xmath38 $ ] have the lowest value of the amplitude @xmath33 at @xmath3 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the trend reinforced again in this table seems to be that the anomalous result becomes increasingly significant as the maps supposedly improve .",
    "we have presented a simple statistical analysis based on properties of the zonal modes of cosmic microwave background maps , i.e. those aligned parallel to the galactic plane .",
    "an application of the test to various cleaned cmb maps gives interesting results .",
    "at the 95 per cent level , no significant anomalies appear in the wmap ilc maps @xcite but there seems to be a significant tendency in some other maps @xcite to have zonal modes with systematically lower amplitudes than would be expected in the concordance model .",
    "intriguingly , the maps that provide the most significant departures from the behavior expected under the null hypothesis are those based on later issues of the wmap data .",
    "we have also showed that the low variance of the maps is more significant where you consider only the zonal amplitudes .",
    "this shows that zonal modes have a notable contribution towards this low variance . finally , we considered the distribution of maxima and minima in zonal maps which again reinforced the earlier finding that the anomalies increase with later data releases",
    ". the question of whether this is due to increasing over subtraction , or whether decreasing noise is revealing an underlying anomaly such as a systematic problem , can not be distinguished with current data .    of course",
    "the maps themselves are _ _ not statistically independent . indeed ,",
    "if the cleaning processes involved were perfect then they would all be identical .",
    "the different results we have found for the different maps are attributable to the nature of the zonal modes and their extra sensitivity to the structures associated with the galactic plane .",
    "the appearance of significant anomalies in some maps rather than others is not a statistical fluke but is clear evidence that some cleaning methods leave artifacts in the distribution of mode amplitudes .",
    "it must be noted that the probabilities we quote of around 98 to 99 percent are not overwhelming , so the results we have obtained are indicative rather than decisive .",
    "this is not surprising , given the relatively small number of modes we used .",
    "however , we repeated the analysis for a coordinate system aligned with the ecliptic , rather than galactic plane , and found no significant results at all .",
    "this lends further credence to our interpretation of the outcome of our analysis in terms of an effect related to over - subtraction of galactic emission @xcite , which becomes increasingly pronounced with each data release .",
    "a more definitive result will have to wait until more detailed foreground subtraction can be attempted , such as will be the case with the _ planck _ satellite .",
    "jo short receives support from a science & technology facilities council ( stfc ) doctoral training grant .",
    "we would like to thank pavel naselsky for interesting discussions .",
    "we gratefully acknowledge the use of the healpix package @xcite .",
