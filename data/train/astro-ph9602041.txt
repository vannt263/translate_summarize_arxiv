    "the images of faint galaxies taken with the wide field and planetary camera ( wfpc2 ) on the hubble space telescope ( hst ) have provided invaluable information on the morphology of galaxies when the universe was about half its present age . with these data ,",
    "reliable morphological classification is possible down to a magnitude limit of @xmath7 , and we have identified the morphological nature of the galaxies which dominate the number counts at faint magnitudes ( i m et al .",

    "( 1995c ) find evidence for mild luminosity evolution and no strong merging activity at @xmath6 , using the observed size and colour distributions . likewise ,",
    "the hst observations of e / s0 galaxies in clusters at moderate and high redshifts show little sign of strong luminosity evolution ( dickinson 1995 ) .",
    "lilly et al . ( 1995a ) and ellis et al .",
    "( 1995 ) have shown luminosity functions of the total or colour - divided galaxy population at different redshifts and tried to constrain the evolution of faint galaxies up to @xmath8 .",
    "in particular , lilly et al .",
    "( 1995a ) divided the galaxies into two subsamples according to their colors ( red or blue ) , and then showed that the luminosity of red galaxies evolves mildly , in contrast with the blue galaxies .",
    "this result on the red galaxies is consistent with the hst observations of ellipticals , but because of the lack of morphological classification for most of the galaxies in the lilly et al .",
    "sample , detailed constraints on the luminosity evolution of e / s0 galaxies have not been obtained in their study .",
    "the hst data can provide such morphological information , and we will thus construct luminosity functions of _ e / s0 galaxies _ at moderate to high redshifts in order to study their evolution .",
    "our selection of elliptical galaxies comes from the full hst mds which observes random fields using wfpc2 , and we have also included generically similar archival data from a strip of sky originally surveyed in primary mode by groth et al .",
    "all of these fields were observed in both the @xmath9 and @xmath10 bands ( f606w and f814w ) .",
    "the detection limit for each field covers the range @xmath11 and @xmath12 . for each object",
    "detected , the observed image is fitted with simple model profiles ( point source , @xmath13 profile and exponential profile ) using a 2-dimensional maximum likelihood technique ( ratnatunga et al 1995 ) .",
    "we identify e / s0 galaxies via ( i ) morphology and ( ii ) luminosity profile .",
    "point ( ii ) is an important step which is needed in order to exclude dwarf elliptical galaxies ( de ) from our sample .",
    "the de galaxies have different photometric properties from normal ellipticals ( e.g , see i m et al .",
    "1995b and references therein ) . from 56 hst wfpc2 fields ,",
    "we find 376 elliptical galaxies at @xmath14 , the same sample as that used in the previous study of number counts and constraints on cosmological parameters using these galaxies ( i m et al .",
    "for a dozen ellipticals in our sample , spectroscopic observations were obtained with the kpno 4 meter using the cryogenic camera and rc spectrograph with multi - slit masks during observing runs in october 1994 and april 1995 .",
    "sufficiently high signal - to - noise spectra were obtained during 2 to 3 hour exposures in order to measure redshifts .",
    "redshifts were generally determined through identification of the caii h&k absorption feature in each spectrum , at a rest wavelength of @xmath15 .",
    "redshifts for 11 e / s0s in the archived hst data from the groth - westphal field at 14h+52@xmath16 were taken from lilly et al.(1995b ) .",
    "these latter redshifts were extremely useful since they covered the range from @xmath17 to @xmath18 .",
    "previous studies have shown that the spectral energy distribution of present - day normal e / s0 galaxies can be well fitted by a single starburst model with an age of more than 10 gyr ( bruzual & charlot 1993 ; arimoto & yoshii 1986 ; guiderdoni & rocca - volmerange 1987 ) .",
    "according to these models , the color of e / s0 galaxies is quite insensitive to luminosity evolution up to @xmath4 ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "we therefore use the @xmath19 color of e / s0 galaxies to estimate redshifts .",
    "the use of the hst @xmath9 and @xmath10 bands is advantageous in this respect since they are relatively insensitive to the detailed shape of individual spectra , owing to their broad widths .",
    "we also use the half light radii of the e / s0s in order to complement the photometric estimation of redshifts . for a given apparent magnitude ,",
    "galaxies with lower surface brightness ( or larger angular sizes ) are likely to be at higher redshifts than galaxies with higher surface brightness ( or smaller angular sizes ) because of the @xmath20 surface brightness dimming effect ( i m et al . 1995a ) .    in fig.2 ,",
    "we show estimated photometric redshifts vs. spectroscopic redshifts for a subsample of e / s0 galaxies .",
    "the photometric redshifts estimated using colors and sizes are accurate to within an error of about 0.08 at low redshifts and about 0.13 at high redshifts .    in order to calculate absolute magnitudes , the k - correction has been applied , but no evolutionary correction was used since our intention is to measure the degree of evolution of the luminosity function .",
    "the error in @xmath21 leads to an uncertainty of about 0.5 mag in the absolute magnitudes at @xmath22 .",
    "we have constructed the luminosity function of e / s0 galaxies using the @xmath24 technique ( huchra & sargent 1973 ; lilly et al .",
    "1995a ) within three redshift bins , i ) @xmath0 , ii ) @xmath25 , and iii ) @xmath2 under the assumption of two different sets of cosmological parameters : a ) @xmath26 , and b ) @xmath27 .",
    "each redshift bin contains about 120 galaxies , and this gives about @xmath28 galaxies available within each absolute magnitude bin for the determination of the luminosity functions ( lfs ) .",
    "the calculated lfs are plotted in fig.3 . and fig.4 .",
    ", along with the e / s0 lf from the cfa redshift survey ( marzke et al .",
    "the error on each point is obtained by a bootstrap algorithm .",
    "there is a clear trend that the lf moves towards brighter magnitudes with increasing redshift , i.e. we observe luminosity evolution .",
    "taking into account the uncertainty of about 0.5 in the estimate of absolute magnitudes , there thus appears to be luminosity evolution by @xmath29 in i magnitude from @xmath30 to @xmath31 , and @xmath32 magnitude brightening from @xmath30 to @xmath4 .",
    "the corresponding expected luminosity evolution at @xmath4 from spectral evolution models is about 0.7 to 1.4 ( @xmath33 ) , consistent with our findings ( bruzual & charlot 1993 ; colin et al 1993 ; i m et al .",
    "1995c ; roche et al .",
    "it is not clear whether there is luminosity evolution from z=0 to z=0.4 , because of the uncertainty in the value of @xmath34 for the local elliptical lf ( marzke et al .",
    "1995 ; loveday et al . 1992 ; zucca et al .",
    "1994 ) as well as the 0.5 magnitude uncertainty in our lf , but the models predict about 0.3 magnitude of brightening at this redshift .",
    "there is observational evidence for the existence of intermediate age stellar populations in cluster e / s0s , implying that there were secondary bursts of star formation ( e.g. , couch & sharples 1987 ) .",
    "starbursting e / s0s may look more irregular and bluer than the normal ellipticals , which are not found in our sample .",
    "hence , our result does not necessarily exclude such models of e / s0s with the secondary starbursts ( charlot & silk 1994 ) .    to show the completeness of our sample",
    ", we list @xmath24 values and the number of ellipticals used in table 1 .",
    "when @xmath35 , the sample can be considered complete and there is then no strong bias in the estimate of the lf ( huchra & sargent 1973 ; zucca et al .",
    "1994 ) . in table 1 , we find that @xmath36 for most cases except for a few outliers , and we conclude that our result is not affected by any bias due to the incompleteness of the sample . also , we find that the @xmath24 is distributed uniformly from 0 to 1 ( not shown in this paper ) .",
    "the elliptical galaxies live preferentially in clusters and the derived lf could be biased by ellipticals in a few large clusters .",
    "if this is the case , the @xmath24 would be clumped around the certain value where the cluster lies .",
    "we do not find this kind of trend , thus our result is not affected by large clusters .    in order to provide a more quantitative result , we have also estimated parameters for the lfs using the sty method ( sandage , tamman , & yahil 1979 ; loveday et al . 1992 ; marzke et al .",
    "1995 ) , on the assumption that they are described by the schechter form ( schechter 1976 ) .",
    "because of the lack of a sufficient number of galaxies to fit the lf over a reasonable magnitude range , the estimated parameters ( @xmath37 ) are rather unstable , and the apparent steepening of the estimated slope at high redshift should not be considered seriously ( first and second rows of table 2 ) . in order to obtain a more stable fit , we therefore used a fixed @xmath38 ( marzke et al .",
    "1995 ) and estimated the change in @xmath34 .",
    "the third row of table 1 shows @xmath34 estimates by this method , and we clearly see the brightening of @xmath34 with redshift .",
    "we also note that the observed i magnitude is roughly equivalent to the rest frame b - magnitude at @xmath4 within a few tenths of magnitude ( lilly et al .",
    "for this reason , we constructed the luminosity function at @xmath4 without applying k - correction , and estimated the @xmath39 using @xmath38 .",
    "this way , we get @xmath40 ( note that @xmath41 at z=0 : efstathiou et al . 1988 ; marzke et al.1995 ) consistent with our finding of the luminosity evolution in i magnitude ( fifth row of the table 2 ) .",
    "if , as a result of mergers , the average mass of ellipticals is a decreasing function of look - back time , our result is also consistent with strong luminosity evolution ( @xmath42 ) at z=1 .",
    "however , this is unlikely since the strong merging activity accompanies the remarkable decrease of the number density as a function of redshift , which is not observed in our data ( however , see discussions below for a possible loophole in this argument ) .    in order to quantify the possible number evolution of e / s0s",
    ", we tried to estimate @xmath43 using the parameters in the third row of table 2 and the observed lfs in fig.3 .",
    "the observed lfs show @xmath43 may have decreased by about 50 % since z=1 if @xmath44 .",
    "if @xmath45 , the @xmath43 value hardly changes as a function of redshift , probably by less than 30 % ( see the fourth row of table 2 ) . if the value of @xmath43 is indicative of the number density evolution ( i.e , @xmath34 is fixed : see i m et al .",
    "1995c ) , we expect that about 4  20 % of the present day galaxies are produced via major merging since @xmath46 , adopting the present day merger rate to be @xmath47 ( carlberg 1995 ) and the look - back time of @xmath48 . today , roughly 20  25 % of galaxies in the volume limited sample are e / s0s ( buta et al .",
    "1994 ; lauberts & valentijn 1989 ) , thus we expect the number evolution of more than 16  100 % to be observed if the ellipticals are the products of major merging . similarly , we get the upper limit of the `` major merger rate '' ( defined here the fraction of interacting pairs per unit time ) to be roughly @xmath49 using our lower limit of @xmath50 . if the merger rate evolved as strongly as @xmath51 , the number density of ellipticals at z=1 would be much less than 70 % of the present day value .",
    "hence models with the strong major merger rate evolution seem to be excluded ( e.g. , carlberg 1992 ) .",
    "however , the strong merger rate evolution with strong luminosity evolution could be reconciled with our data if the value of @xmath52 is locally low .",
    "the local low density universe has been suggested to explain the high value of @xmath53 with @xmath54 ( e.g. , wu et al .",
    "1995 ) . in order to reconcile the latest estimates of @xmath53 with the @xmath54 universe",
    ", one can assume that our local universe ( @xmath55 ) has a mass density only 10 @xmath56 20 % of the total mass density of the universe .",
    "thus , at sufficiently high redshift ( @xmath57 ) , the mass density needs to be about 5 to 10 times higher than that in our local universe , and the same for the number density of galaxies if the ratio of dark to luminous matter is roughly constant .",
    "our result appears to show the number density of e / s0s increases as a function of look - back time z=0 when @xmath54 , but not as much as the factor of 510 .",
    "the local low density universe appears to be excluded , but the apparent deficit of e / s0s at @xmath4 could simply be due to the strong number evolution caused by the strong major merger rate evolution . in that case , the local low density universe @xmath58 the strong merger rate evolution may be consistent with our data ( but for observational evidences against the strong major merger rate evolution , see neuschaefer et al . 1995 , 1996 ; woods et al . 1995 ) .",
    "we have constructed the luminosity functions of elliptical galaxies using data from hst mds and archived hst surveys .",
    "redshifts of these e / s0s have been determined using @xmath19 colors and sizes to an accuracy of @xmath59 up to @xmath4 . from the constructed luminosity functions , we find luminosity evolution of about @xmath32 mags at @xmath60 . on the other hand ,",
    "we exclude strong number evolution of elliptical galaxies , and our data are consistent with a merger rate of @xmath61 with very weak major merger rate unless the mass density of the universe is locally low .",
    "this latter result supports our earlier findings ( i m et al .",
    "1995c ) on the basis of the size and colour distributions of e / s0s .",
    "this paper is based on observations with the nasa / esa hubble space telescope , obtained at the space telescope science institute , which is operated by the association of universities for research in astronomy , inc .",
