    "we may also filter the floer complexes by action values @xmath181 : @xmath182 this is a quotient complex of @xmath183 if @xmath184 .",
    "observe that increasing @xmath185 gives a subcomplex , @xmath186 for @xmath187 .",

    "standard methods show that @xmath190 , and we denote by @xmath191 and @xmath192 the cohomologies of these complexes .",
    "one might hope that the continuation method of floer homology can be used to define a homomorphism between the floer complexes @xmath193 and @xmath194 obtained for two hamiltonians @xmath195 .",
    "this involves solving the parametrized version of floer s equation @xmath196 where @xmath197 are @xmath99compatible almost complex structures of contact type and @xmath198 is a homotopy from @xmath199 to @xmath200 ( i.e. an @xmath201dependent hamiltonian with @xmath202 for @xmath203 and @xmath204 for @xmath205 ) .",
    "if @xmath127 and @xmath206 are respectively @xmath115-periodic orbits of @xmath207 and @xmath208 , then we can define a moduli space @xmath179 of such solutions @xmath148 which converge to @xmath127 and @xmath206 at the ends .",
    "this time there is no freedom to reparametrize @xmath148 in the @xmath201variable .",
    "the action @xmath209 along such a solution @xmath148 will vary as follows @xmath210 so the action decreases if @xmath198 is monotone decreasing , @xmath211 .",
    "the energy is @xmath212 so an a priori bound will hold if @xmath213 outside of a compact set in @xmath87 .",
    "if @xmath214 on the collar and @xmath215 , then a maximum principle for @xmath158 as before will hold on the collar ( we refer to @xcite for a very clear proof ) and therefore it automatically guarantees a bound on @xmath216 and thus an a priori energy bound .",
    "thus , if outside of a compact in @xmath87 we have @xmath214 and @xmath215 , then ( after a generic @xmath114-small time - dependent perturbation of @xmath217 ) the moduli space @xmath179 will be a smooth manifold with a compactification @xmath218 by broken trajectories and a continuation map @xmath219 can be defined : on a generator @xmath220 , @xmath221 where @xmath177 is the @xmath178dimensional part of @xmath179 and @xmath222 depends on orientations .",
    "standard methods show that @xmath223 is a chain map and that these maps compose well : given homotopies from @xmath199 to @xmath224 and from @xmath224 to @xmath200 , each satisfying the condition @xmath225 outside of a compact in @xmath87 , then the composite @xmath226 is chain homotopic to @xmath223 .",
    "so on cohomology , @xmath227 equals the composite @xmath228 .",
    "for example , a `` compactly supported homotopy '' is one where @xmath198 is independent of @xmath145 outside of a compact ( @xmath229 for @xmath205 ) .",
    "continuation maps for @xmath198 and @xmath230 can then be defined and they will be inverse to each other up to chain homotopy .",
    "we change coordinates from @xmath82 to @xmath94 , so the collar is now @xmath231 and @xmath232 .",
    "take a hamiltonian @xmath233 with @xmath234 for @xmath235 , such that @xmath236 as @xmath237 .",
    "the symplectic cohomology is defined as the cohomology of the corresponding floer complex ( after a @xmath114-small time - dependent perturbation of @xmath238 ) , @xmath239 the technical difficulty lies in showing that it is independent of the choices @xmath238 .",
    "similarly one defines the groups @xmath240 , but these now depend on the choice of @xmath233 . however , for @xmath241 , taking the direct limit as @xmath242 yields @xmath243 since @xmath244 are subcomplexes exhausting @xmath245 as @xmath242 .",
    "if we use action bounds , then it is sometimes possible to vary the hamiltonian without using continuation maps .",
    "let @xmath246 for @xmath247 , and suppose @xmath248 for @xmath247 .",
    "let @xmath249 on @xmath250 and @xmath251 with @xmath252 for @xmath247 ( e.g. if @xmath253 ) .",
    "then @xmath254 are equal as complexes : the orbits in @xmath255 get discarded by the action bounds ; the orbits agree in @xmath256 since @xmath257 there ; and the differential on these common orbits is the same because the maximum principle forces the floer trajectories to lie in @xmath250 , where @xmath257 , so the floer equations agree .",
    "for example , let @xmath258 on @xmath259 , so @xmath260 .",
    "take @xmath249 on @xmath261 and extend @xmath262 linearly on @xmath263 . then @xmath264 . by this trick",
    ", @xmath265 can be computed by a hamiltonian which is linear at infinity , and so @xmath266 can be computed as a direct limit using hamiltonians which are linear at infinity and whose slopes at infinity become steeper and steeper .",
    "we now make this precise .",
    "consider hamiltonians @xmath113 which equal @xmath267 for @xmath235 .",
    "we assume that the slope @xmath268 does not occur as the value of the period of any reeb orbit . if @xmath198 is a homotopy from @xmath199 to @xmath200 among such hamiltonians , i.e. @xmath269 for @xmath270 , then the maximum principle ( and hence a priori energy bounds for continuation maps ) will hold if @xmath271 suppose that @xmath272 , satisfying @xmath273 for @xmath274 and @xmath275 for @xmath276 , and suppose that the action values @xmath277 of @xmath115-periodic orbits @xmath127 of @xmath278 never cross the action bounds @xmath279",
    ". then a continuation map can be defined , @xmath280 these maps compose well : @xmath281 is chain homotopic to @xmath223 ( where to define @xmath282 , @xmath283 we use @xmath284 varying from @xmath285 to some @xmath286 , @xmath287 varying from @xmath286 to @xmath288 , and the analogous assumptions as above hold ) .",
    "for example if we vary only @xmath289 , and not @xmath286 , then @xmath290 outside of a compact and the continuation map @xmath223 for @xmath198 can be inverted ( up to chain homotopy ) by using the continuation map for @xmath230 .",
    "thus , up to isomorphism , @xmath191 is independent of the choice of the constants @xmath289 in @xmath291 .",
