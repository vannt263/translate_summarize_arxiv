    "during the last years the scientific community has shown that many relevant properties of communication systems , social networks and other biological and technological systems may be described in terms of complex network properties , including structural and dynamical properties and the interplay between them ( see , for example , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite or @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "the emergence of these appealing results has forged the complex networks analysis as an attractive and multidisciplinary branch of research that includes topics of sociology ( social networks ) , biological sciences ( including metabolic and protein networks , genetic regulatory network and many others ) , neuro - sciences ( neural interaction networks , cortical networks ) engineering ( phone call networks , computers in telecommunication networks , internet , the world wide web ) , theoretical physics and applied mathematics .",
    "the working objects of the complex networks analysis are graphs ( which are called _ complex networks _ ) which occasionally prove unable to capture the details present in some real - life problems .",
    "one example of this situation can be found in sociology .",
    "social networks analysis is used in the social and behavioral sciences , as well as in economics , marketing , and industrial engineering ( @xcite ) , but some questions related to the structure of social networks have been not understood properly . from the fact that a social network can be understood as a set of people or groups of people with some pattern of contacts or interactions between them ( @xcite,@xcite ) - think of the facebook network - it might seem that all the connections or social relationships between the members of that network take place at the same level .",
    "but the real situation is far from this .",
    "the real relationships amongst the members of a social network take place ( mostly ) inside of different groups ( levels ) and therefore it can not be modeled properly if only the natural local - scale point of view used in classic complex network models is taken into account .",
    "this phenomenon is related to the fact that several real - life complex systems have a community structure @xcite that takes place in a scale that lies between the local and the global one and that gives information about the structure - functionality relationship .",
    "the problem of finding and analyzing the community structure of a complex network is one of the _ hot spots _ of the complex network analysis , since these meso - scale structures reveal valuable information about roles of groups of nodes @xcite .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to present the concept of multilevel network as a new model useful to analyze with detail complex systems that has some structures in the mesoscale level . as we pointed out before ,",
    "this kind of networks are present in many real - life situations , not only in social networks , but also in communication networks and all the other examples that exhibit a community structure .",
    "the introduction of a sharp mathematical model that fits this new structures may prove crucial to properly analyze the dynamics that take place in these complex systems which are far from being completely understood .",
    "an example of these phenomena is the dissemination of culture in social networks by using the axelrod model that has been recently studied by using meso - scale networks @xcite . yet",
    "the study of other meso - scaled complex networks and their dynamics is one of the scientific challenges of the nowadays complex network analysis .",
    "there are other mathematical models that consider non - local structures such as the hypergraphs ( or hypernetworks ) @xcite or the hyper - structures @xcite but they are not able to combine the local scale with the global and the mesoscale structures of the system .",
    "for example , if we want to model how a rumor is spread within a social network , it is necessary to have in mind not only that different groups are linked only through some of their members but also that two people who know the same person do nt have necessarily to know each other , and , in fact , these two people may belong to different groups or levels .",
    "if we try to model this situation with hyper - networks , then we will only be taking into account the social groups and not the actual relationships between their members ; in contrast if we use the hyper - structure model , then we wo nt possibly know to which social group each contact between two nodes belongs .",
    "after multilevel networks are defined , we present a structural analysis of these objects in terms of the clustering coefficient and the metric structure which must be properly defined in this setting .",
    "we will compare these parameters with the corresponding ones for the underlying projection networks and we will present the analytical relationships between them . despite the fact that there are sharp connections between the structural properties of the multilevel network and the properties of their projection and layer ( or slice ) networks , we will present some examples that exhibit the deep differences between the classic complex network approach and this new point of view .",
    "finally , in section 3 , we will give several growing models to produce multilevel random networks , inspired by the barabsi - albert preferential attachment model of complex networks @xcite .",
    "these methods are inspired by the bipartite networks models introduced by ramasco _",
    "_ @xcite and by m.peltomki and m.alava @xcite , but in this case we have to take into account the meso - scale nature of the multilevel structure .",
    "the use of growing random models is natural since many of the examples in real life that can be modeled by multilevel networks , such as social or transportation networks , are dynamic models whose structure grow in time by addition of new nodes , links and layers . by using these models",
    "we perform several random testings that show that we can get very different multilevel networks ( i.e. with very different meso - scale structure ) which still have similar local and global structures when considered as classic complex network .",
    "for example , we exhibit a multilevel network that at the meso - scale is like an erds - rnyi random network , but it has a scale - free structure if we consider it as a complex network .",
    "these random testings reinforce the idea that in many cases we must take into account the meso - scale structure in order to get deep understanding of the structure and dynamics of many complex systems .",
    "as we pointed out in the previous section , a sort of naive approach to complex systems with structures in the mesoscale could suggest that hyper - networks and hyper - structures fit perfectly to these real - life systems . the key - point that makes these mathematical model not to be the best solution for systems with structures in the mesoscale has to do with the fact that both hyper - networks and hyper - structures are node - based models , while many real systems combine a node - based point of view with a link - based perspective .",
    "for example , if we have a look again at a social network with structures in the mesoscale ( such as several social groups within its structure ) , when we consider a relationship between two members of one social group(or several ) , we have to take into account not only the social groups that hold the members , but also the social group that holds the relationship itself , i.e. , if , for example , there is a relationship between two people that share the same working group and the same sport group , we have to highlight if the relationship is due to sharing the same group of work or it has sport nature .",
    "this fact is not particular of social networks with structures in the mesoscale and a similar situation occurs , for example , in public transportation systems , where a link between two stations belonging to several transport lines can occur as a part of different lines .    in order to avoid this node - based nature of hyper - networks and hyper - structures",
    ", we propose to introduce the following concept that combines the node - based with the link - based perspective :    let @xmath0 be a network .",
    "multilevel network _ is a triple @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is a family of subgraphs @xmath3 of @xmath4 such that @xmath5 i.e. @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the network @xmath4 is the _ projection network _ of @xmath8 and each subgraph @xmath9 is called a _",
    "slice _ of the multilevel network @xmath8 .",
    "this mathematical model perfectly suits social systems ( as well as other complex systems ) with structures in the mesoscale , since each social group can be understood as a _ slice graph _ in a _ multilevel network _ ; thus we are simultaneously taking into account the nature of the links ( i.e. relationships ) and the nodes involved .",
    "it is easy to check that this new mathematical object extends both the classic complex network model and also the hyper - network model @xcite .",
    "let us point it out very briefly .",
    "on the one hand , if @xmath0 is a network , then it can be easily seen as a multilevel network by considering @xmath1 , where @xmath10 .    on the other hand",
    "if @xmath11 is an hyper - network ( i.e. @xmath12 is a non - empty set of nodes and @xmath13 is a family of non - empty subsets of @xmath12 , each of them called and _ hyper - link _ of @xmath14 ) , then it can be seen as the multilevel set @xmath15 , given by @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the complete network obtained by linking every pair of nodes of @xmath18 and @xmath19 by using similar arguments we can show that every hyper - structure @xcite can be understood as a particular multilevel network , by considering one slice network for each hyper - link in the hyper - structure and each slice graph being a set of isolated nodes .",
    "once we have introduced this new and novel mathematical object , we have to give suitable structural parameters to analyze it",
    ". we can give natural extensions of many of the usual tools of the complex networks analysis , such as the clustering coefficient , an adjacency matrix / tensor , a natural network representation as a tripartite network or a geodesic structure , among many others .",
    "in this subsection we extend the graph clustering coefficient introduced by watts and strogatz in @xcite to multilevel networks and we establish some relationships between the clustering coefficient of a multilevel network , the clustering coefficient of its slices and the clustering coefficient of its projection network .",
    "recall that given a network @xmath20 the clustering coefficient of a given node @xmath21 is defined as @xmath22 we take @xmath23 to be @xmath24 for every number @xmath25 . thus , if we think of three people @xmath21,@xmath26 and  @xmath27 with mutual relations between @xmath21 and @xmath26 as well as between @xmath21 and  @xmath27 , the clustering coefficient of @xmath21 is supposed to represent the likeliness that @xmath26 and @xmath27 are also related . the clustering coefficient of @xmath4 is usually defined as the average of the clustering coefficients of all nodes .",
    "in order to give a definition os the clustering coefficient of a node in a multilevel network @xmath1 , where @xmath28 and @xmath3 for every @xmath29 , we need to introduce some notation . for every node @xmath30 call @xmath31 the set of all neighbors of the node @xmath21 in the projection graph @xmath4 . for",
    "every @xmath32 we will denote @xmath33 and @xmath34 the subgraph of the slice @xmath35 generated by @xmath36 , i.e. @xmath37 , where @xmath38 similarly we will define @xmath39 as the subgraph of the projection network @xmath4 generated by @xmath31 , i.e. @xmath40 , where @xmath41 in addition the complete graph generated by @xmath36 will be denoted as usual by @xmath42 note that the largest possible number of links between the nodes of @xmath36 is precisely the number of links in @xmath43 , i.e. @xmath44 where @xmath45 stands as above for the cardinality of @xmath36 . with the previous notation we give the following    let @xmath1 be a multilevel network .",
    "the _ clustering coefficient of a given node _",
    "@xmath21 in @xmath8 is defined as @xmath46 the _ clustering coefficient _ of @xmath8 is the average of all @xmath47 over the set of nodes .",
    "notice that the clustering coefficient might have been defined differently .",
    "for instance we might have considered the clustering coefficient of each @xmath35 , say @xmath48 , and then take the average over the set @xmath49 .",
    "however we have opted for a definition that embodies the following idea : it is possible for a given node @xmath21 to have two neighbors @xmath50 with @xmath51 , @xmath52 with @xmath53 and such that there is a link @xmath54 with @xmath55 .",
    "this is a natural situation when we think of social networks ; indeed , one person @xmath21 knows @xmath26 from the aerobic class , @xmath21 also knows @xmath27 from her reading club while @xmath26 and @xmath27 know each other from the supermarket .",
    "this sort of situation produces more links in the subgraphs @xmath34 defined above than those already present in the slice @xmath35 . taking the alternative definition based on the clustering coefficients of the slices",
    "would not help to discriminate such situations ; in contrast the definition proposed does .",
    "the following example should clarify this situation and justifies the restrictions of theorem [ multiclustering ] .",
    "[ slide - ex ] if we consider the multilevel network @xmath1 where @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath4 is as in the next figure , it is easy to check that @xmath58 for all @xmath59 but however @xmath60 for all @xmath59 and @xmath61 .        as we have seen in the last example , the clustering coefficient of the projected graph @xmath4 and the clustering coefficient of each slice of @xmath8 may be very different",
    ". however we are interested in establishing relations between the clustering coefficient of the multilevel network , @xmath47 , and the clustering coefficient in the projected network , @xmath62 , if possible .",
    "that is the target of the next theorem :    [ multiclustering ] let @xmath1 be a multilevel network and @xmath30 . if we consider @xmath63 and we denote @xmath64 , then @xmath65 furthermore , if @xmath8 is homogeneous , then @xmath66    let us start with the left - hand inequality in ( [ e : multiclustering ] ) . using that @xmath67 for every @xmath29 and @xmath68",
    ", we get that @xmath69 since @xmath70    in order to prove the remaining inequality notice that the number of links in the complete graph built up on the set of nodes @xmath71 never exceeds the sum over @xmath72 of the numbers of links of the complete graphs built up on the sets of nodes @xmath36 plus all the links possibly obtained by joining nodes of @xmath73 to nodes of  @xmath74 where @xmath27 and @xmath26 are chosen among all possible pairs @xmath75 with @xmath76 , i.e. @xmath77 terms .",
    "notice also that we can always assume , by rearranging if necessary , that @xmath78 for @xmath79 .",
    "in addition to this , observe finally that @xmath80\\\\ & \\le ( p-1)\\sum_{q=1}^p ( |\\mathcal{n}_q(i)|-1)|\\mathcal{n}_q(i)| .",
    "\\end{split}\\ ] ] thus , since @xmath81 for every @xmath29 and by using ( [ e : nodos_capa_proyeccion ] ) @xmath82 notice that if @xmath76 , then @xmath83 now if we combine the last formula with ( [ e : aristascapa_aristastotal ] ) , we get that @xmath84 it is easy to check that if @xmath85 , then @xmath86 , which makes that @xmath87 hence @xmath88 since if @xmath85 , then @xmath89 , while if @xmath90 , then @xmath91 .",
    "finally , if we use the last upper bound , we obtain that @xmath92    on the other hand , if @xmath8 is homogeneous , then the same techniques as before shows that @xmath93 . since @xmath8 is homogeneous , then @xmath94 and @xmath81 for every @xmath29 .",
    "therefore we conclude that @xmath95    the definition of @xmath96 shows that the estimation in the previous theorem gets coarser as the number of slices for which @xmath21 has strictly less than two neighbors ( possibly zero ) increases ; in a `` normal '' scenario this situation will not occur and the estimation will involve a polynomial of degree two in @xmath97 . anyway , since @xmath98 and the function @xmath99 is increasing in @xmath100 , then the last result ensures that @xmath101 where @xmath102 is of order @xmath103 with @xmath104 $ ] , but still it is not obvious whether the exponent 2 can be lowered .",
    "as it was said above there are other possible definitions for the clustering of a node in a multilevel network , based on the clusterings of that node in the slices , and then it is natural to have then related by means of estimations .",
    "however a remark is in order .",
    "notice that it is possible to construct a network whose slices have clustering coefficients zero for every node while the clustering coefficient of the projection network is @xmath105 for every node .",
    "indeed , if we consider the example [ slide - ex ] as our multilevel network @xmath8 , then it is straightforward to check that for a given node  @xmath21 , its clustering coefficient in each of the slices , @xmath48 , is zero , and hence every convex combination of them , while the clustering coefficient @xmath47 is @xmath105 .",
    "this means that we can not expect to estimate @xmath47 from convex combinations of @xmath106 .",
    "still it makes sense to give a _ `` slicewise '' _ definition for the clustering coefficient of the node  @xmath21 in a multilevel network @xmath8 and find estimations by means of the clustering already defined . again",
    "some notation is required .",
    "call @xmath107 and @xmath108 , where @xmath109 note that @xmath110 is the subgraph of the slice @xmath35 generated by @xmath111 .",
    "thus the following definition is proposed .",
    "[ slicewisedefinition ] let @xmath1 be a multilevel network and @xmath21 be a given node of @xmath8 .",
    "the _ slice clustering _ coefficient of @xmath21 is defined as @xmath112    notice that @xmath110 is a subgraph of @xmath34 as was illustrated in the example above .",
    "accordingly @xmath113 and hence the largest possible number of links between neighbours of @xmath21 in the @xmath114-slice , can not exceed the corresponding largest possible number of links between neighbours of @xmath21 in @xmath36 .",
    "as above we have the relation @xmath115 terms .",
    "also we can assume , after rearrangement , that @xmath116 for all @xmath29 .",
    "thus by mimicking the proof of theorem [ multiclustering ] , we can get a relationship between the clustering coefficient in the projected network @xmath62 and the slice clustering coefficient @xmath117 .",
    "let @xmath1 be a multilevel network and @xmath21 be a given node of @xmath8 .",
    "call @xmath118 and @xmath64 .",
    "then @xmath119    notice that there are other possible variations for the definition of the slice clustering coefficient of a node @xmath21 .",
    "for example , the average over the clustering coefficients @xmath48 of the slides : @xmath120    the relation between this definition and definition [ slicewisedefinition ] @xmath121 is easily derived from the following lemma .    if @xmath122 and @xmath123 , then @xmath124    it is straightforward since @xmath125    the following examples illustrate the behavior of the different concepts of clustering previously introduced .",
    "as it can be seen , if each one is separately evaluated one gets extremely different values .",
    "consider @xmath1 with @xmath126 and the slices @xmath127 and @xmath128 . in this case @xmath129 while @xmath130 we see that the two local clustering coefficients dramatically differ for @xmath131 .",
    "on the other hand , consider @xmath1 with @xmath132 , @xmath133 , @xmath134 , @xmath135 , @xmath136 if @xmath137 , @xmath138 .",
    "then @xmath139 @xmath140 while @xmath141 also in this case the two local clustering coefficients are very different for @xmath131 .",
    "consider @xmath1 , where the slice @xmath142 is defined by @xmath143 and @xmath144 for @xmath145 , @xmath146 , @xmath147 .",

    "then @xmath176 while @xmath177    we conclude this section with a final observation .",
    "all what has been said refers to local clustering coefficients .",
    "the aggregation of the local quantities into a global one , or clustering of @xmath8 , can naturally be considered .",
    "we left the details to the reader .",
    "if we want to introduce metric tools in a multilevel network @xmath1 , we first have to give the notion of _ path _ and _ length_. a _ path _",
    "@xmath178 in @xmath1 is a set of the form @xmath179 such that    * @xmath180 is a path in @xmath181 , * @xmath182 is a sequence of slice graphs @xmath183 , * for every @xmath184 , we have that @xmath185 is an edge in the slice graph @xmath186 .    by using this concept we can introduce a metric structure in a multilevel graph @xmath1 as follows .",
    "let @xmath1 be a multilevel network , @xmath187 fixed and @xmath179 be a path in @xmath8 . the _ length _ of @xmath178 is the nonnegative value @xmath188 where @xmath189 the _ distance _ in @xmath8 between two nodes @xmath190 is the minimal length among all possible paths in @xmath8 from @xmath21 to @xmath26 .",
    "if we take @xmath191 , the previous definition gives the natural metric in the projection graph , while if @xmath192 , we introduce new metrics that take into account , not only the global structure of the projection network , but also the interplay between the slice networks , that help to model the multi - scale nature of real - life social networks .",
    "one way to calculate the distance matrix , that is a matrix @xmath193 that contains in each position @xmath194 the distance in @xmath8 between vertices @xmath21 and @xmath26 in @xmath12 , is to consider an auxiliary graph in the following way .",
    "every vertex of the multilevel network @xmath8 is represented by a vertex in the auxiliary graph and , if a vertex in @xmath8 belongs to two or more slice graphs in @xmath8 , then we duplicated it as many times as the number of slide graphs it belongs to .",

    "each of the remaining @xmath247 nodes of @xmath241 will be a new node with probability @xmath233 and an existing node with probability @xmath248 .",
    "if we have to add an already existing node , we will uniformly and independently choose it at random .",

    "first , we link all the nodes to the coordinator node in order to warrant that the new layer is connected . in addition to this , we set new links between each pair of nodes , say @xmath245 and @xmath252 ( with @xmath253 ) by using a random linking probability @xmath254 that we will present later . at the end of this step",
    "we have defined completely the new layer @xmath241 . * finally , we repeat steps _ ( iii ) _ and _ ( iv ) _ until the number of nodes of the multilevel network is at least @xmath231 .",
    "these rules define a family of growing models for multilevel random networks that cover a wide range of different networks with different meso - scale structure , simply by changing the _ linking strategy _ , @xmath254 , at each step . the simplest choice for this strategy is @xmath255 , _",
    "i.e. _ an all - to all strategy , thus linking all the nodes in the new slice . in this way",
    ", we recover a model similar to the ramasco _",
    "model @xcite , that can be used to produce hyper - networks with a meso - scale structure similar to that found in scientific collaboration systems .    in this paper",
    "we will focus on the following three different linking strategies :    1 .",
    "_ erds - rnyi type strategy ( _ model i_)_. we fix a value @xmath256 $ ] so that we add each link @xmath257 randomly and independently with probability @xmath258 , for every @xmath259 .",
    "note that this strategy does not take into account the meso - scale structure of the multilevel network , since the existence of the link @xmath257 is independent of the nodes @xmath260 in other slices of the multilevel network . clearly , this is a _ toy model _ inspired by the classic erds - rnyi model .",
    "assortative linking strategy ( _ model ii_)_. for every @xmath259 , we add randomly the link @xmath257 proportionally to the number of common slices that hold simultaneously @xmath261 and @xmath262 .",
    "hence if we denote by @xmath263 the number of slices that hold simultaneously @xmath261 and @xmath262 at time step @xmath240 ( including @xmath241 ) and by @xmath264 the number of slices that hold @xmath261 at time step @xmath240 ( also including @xmath241 ) , thus the probability of linking node @xmath261 with node @xmath261 is given by @xmath265 for every @xmath259 .",
    "the heuristic behind this strategy comes from social networks , since in this type of networks the relationships in a new social group are correlated with the previous relationships between the actors in other social groups @xcite .",
    "hence , on the one hand , if two actors that belong to the new social group coincide in many ( previous ) social groups , then the probability of linking in this new social group is big and , on the other hand , when two new actors join their first social group , the probability of establishing a relationship between them it is also high .",
    "+   nodes per slice .",
    "the distribution of each type of network and size of slice is computed for 100 random networks of 5000 nodes each one.,scaledwidth=80.0% ] 3 .",
    "_ disassortative linking strategy ( _ model iii_)_. if we take @xmath259 , the probability of linking @xmath261 with @xmath262 in the slice @xmath241 is inversely proportional to the number of slices that hold simultaneously @xmath261 and @xmath262 , i.e. if we denote by @xmath254 such probability , then @xmath266 by using the same notation as in the assortative strategy ( _ model ii _ ) .",
    "now , the heuristic inspiring this strategy lies in some transportation networks , such as the airline networks , where the links in a new line try to connect nodes that are not connected in previous lines . by using the last expression , the newcomer nodes of the slice",
    "will be linked to old nodes that belong to many slices with high probability , while the newcomers will not be linked between them also with high probability .",
    "this strategy prevents the multiple reiteration of the same link in different slices and stresses the dissasortativity between newcomer nodes and nodes that belong to many slices .",
    "once we have introduced the three linking strategies , we now present some numerical results to shows that , despite the fact that the above tree rules produce hyper - graphs with similar projection networks , the structures found in the mesoscale can be quite different .     scale ) for different number of nodes @xmath232 in each slice for 100 random networks of 5000 nodes each one .",
    "the case @xmath267 is on the left , @xmath268 is centered and @xmath269 is on the right , combined with some numerical approximation in each case.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]    let us start by showing in figure [ f : dist_grado ] the degree distribution , @xmath270 , of the projection network .",
    "it is clear that the degree distribution of the projection network obtained in three models display heavy - tailed profiles , and this fact is more relevant if the number of nodes of each slice is low , since in this case the big number law s make that the degree distribution behaves as a power - law , @xmath271 with @xmath272 .",
    "note that a discretizacion effect appears in all the distribution presented in figure  [ f : dist_grado ] that makes that the degree distribution are oscillatory .",
    "this is due to the fact that each slice has the same number of nodes , and all of them are linked to the coordinator node , which makes that the degree of the nodes are concentrated in some values modulus @xmath232 . in order to avoid this effect",
    ", we could modify step _",
    "( i ) _ replacing @xmath232 by a non - negative integer random variable that prevents that the degree of each node increases modulo @xmath232 .",
    "this discretization effect is present in the three models and increases when the size of the slices is large , but it is more persistent in model iii , since in this case the dissasortative character of the model stresses this phenomenon .",
    "in addition to the degree distribution of the projection network , in figure  [ f : dist_hiper ] we show the distribution @xmath273 of the number of slices that hold each node ( we call it _ hyper - degree distribution _ for consistency with the hyper - graph theory notation ) . obviously , from this figure we observe that the hyper - degree distribution is only depending on the number of nodes @xmath232 of each slide and it is not correlated with the linking model used to construct the network . on the other hand ,",
    "the behavior of @xmath273 depends quite strongly on the particular value of @xmath232 .",
    "in particular , while @xmath273 can be approximated by a truncated power law for @xmath267 ( figure [ f : dist_hiper].a ) , it presents an exponential decay in the cases @xmath268 and @xmath269 ( figures [ f : dist_hiper].b and [ f : dist_hiper].c ) .",
    "is in panel @xmath274 ( on the left ) , while the case @xmath275 is in panel @xmath276 ( on the right ) , both for models i , ii and iii . ]",
    "figures [ f : dist_grado ] and [ f : dist_hiper ] has shown that either the structure of the projection network and hyper - degree distribution are quite similar for the three random models presented",
    ". however , they are very different if we analyze their mesoscale structure , as figure [ f : histo ] shows .",
    "this figure shows , for @xmath269 and @xmath275 , the probability of finding a node connected to @xmath277 nodes within a randomly chosen slice of the network .",
    "it is straightforward to check that since the erds - rnyi type strategy is used in model  i , then the resulting distribution @xmath278 is a binomial distribution with parameters @xmath232 and @xmath258 ( asymptotically a poisson distribution ) .",
    "however , note that in figure  [ f : dist_grado ] we found that the degree distribution of the projection network is scale - free .",
    "correspondingly , models  ii and iii display totally different mesoscale properties as shown by their corresponding distributions @xmath278 .",
    "on one hand in model  ii we observe that @xmath278 tend to accumulate around the maximum possible value of @xmath277 , @xmath232 , due to the assortative character of the linking strategy used .",
    "conversely , in model  iii the association between the nodes belonging to the same slice is much lower due to the disassortativity of the model .",
    "again , while both models  ii and iii gives two different bimodal averaged distributions @xmath278 , the corresponding distribution for their projection networks are also of scale - free type .",
    "therefore , these results illustrate that many different multilevel networks ( with different mesoscale structures ) can produce similar projection networks and therefore that we should take into account the mesoscale structure in order to give sharper models of many real - life problems .",
