    "tev gamma - rays from extra - galactic sources suffer absorption due to photon - photon interactions with the inter - galactic infrared background radiation  @xcite .",
    "according to recent measurements of the infrared background  ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) and predictions of the optical depth for tev gamma - rays  @xcite , gamma - rays at energies above 10  tev from mrk  421 are expected to be suppressed , since they interact with mid- to far - infrared photons of @xmath0100  @xmath8 m .",
    "mrk  421 became active in 2000 and 2001 , especially at the beginning of 2001  @xcite . during this period",
    ", northern hemisphere observers measured the energy spectrum with good statistics in the region from several hundred gev to @xmath010  tev and reported cutoffs at 36  tev @xcite .",
    "the cutoff energy is consistent with , or slightly smaller than , that measured for mrk  501 during its flaring state in 1997  @xcite . as mrk  501",
    "has a similar redshift ( @xmath9 ) to mrk  421 , this suggests the cutoffs may be due to infrared absorption of tev gamma - rays .",
    "we observed mrk  421 during the 2001 high state with the cangaroo - ii 10  meter telescope , at very large zenith angles of @xmath070@xmath1 .",
    "similar observations have been reported by the durham group for mrk  501 in the high state of 1997  @xcite . for these observations , an effective collecting area @xmath010 times larger than that for observations near the zenith",
    "is obtained , with an accompanying increase in the gamma - ray energy threshold to @xmath010  tev .",
    "the observations were made with the cangaroo - ii 10  meter telescope  @xcite , located near woomera , south australia , australia ( 136@xmath147@xmath10e , 31@xmath106@xmath10s ) .",
    "the telescope consists of 114 segmented optical mirrors , each of 80  cm diameter  @xcite .",
    "the camera contains 552 half - inch photomultiplier tubes , arranged at 0@xmath1.115 intervals , and covering a field of view of @xmath03@xmath1 .",
    "mrk  421 was observed for ten nights in early 2001 ; january 24 , 26 , 27 , 30 , 31 and february 1 , and march 14 ( all dates in ut ) , when the source was extremely active . from the cangaroo - ii telescope site ,",
    "mrk  421 culminates at a zenith angle of 69@xmath1.3 .",
    "approximately two hours observations were made per night .",
    "off source data were taken with the right ascension suitably offset .",
    "an event trigger was registered when 3 individual pixels exceeded a threshold of @xmath02.5 photoelectrons . after rejecting data affected by clouds and those at zenith angles greater than 71@xmath1.5",
    ", 14.34  hours on source data and 16.65  hours off source data remain .",
    "a software trigger was applied in order to reduce the effect of pixels randomly triggered by the night sky background .",
    "pixels with pulse - heights of greater than @xmath03.3 photoelectrons , pixel trigger times within 40  nanoseconds of the central value for the event , and three or more adjacent pixels were required .",
    "finally , four or more pixels surviving these cuts were required in each event .",
    "large zenith angle observations are well - suited to searching for gamma - ray signals at higher energies , as a much larger effective area can be achieved compared to observations near the zenith  @xcite , though with a higher energy threshold . from monte carlo simulations  @xcite , an effective area of @xmath11 at @xmath12  tev was estimated for observations at 70@xmath1 , with the area increasing to @xmath13 for higher energies .",
    "a threshold energy ( where the gamma - ray detection rate is maximized ) of @xmath011  tev was derived for a @xmath14 spectrum .",
    "this is an increase by a factor of @xmath030 in comparison with observations near zenith .",
    "the energy threshold changes by @xmath151  tev if the spectral index is varied by @xmath20.5 .",
    "the selection of the gamma - ray events is based on the parameterization of the elongated shape of the cherenkov light image using the standard parameters : @xmath16 , @xmath17 ( shape ) , @xmath18 ( location ) , @xmath19 ( direction ) , and @xmath20 ( orientation angle )  @xcite . instead of the conventional parameterization cuts",
    ", we adopted the likelihood method  @xcite , which has a higher efficiency of gamma - ray discrimination than the conventional parameterization technique .",
    "the likelihood method uses a single parameter , @xmath21 $ ] , where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the probabilities for the event having been initiated by a gamma - ray from the source or a background event , respectively .",
    "they are the products of individual probabilities for @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath19 , which are derived from the probability density functions , including the energy dependence .",
    "these functions were obtained using gamma - ray simulations for the signal and the observed off source events for the background .",
    "@xmath24 ranges from 0  to  1 , and the probability of a gamma - ray origin for an event increases as @xmath24 becomes closer to 1 , though the gamma - ray acceptance does not significantly decrease in the range of @xmath25  0.5 .",
    "we adopted a relatively loose cut of @xmath26  0.4 with an additional requirement of @xmath27 . with these cuts and a further cut excluding events with @xmath28 ,",
    "86  % of background events are rejected while 63  % of gamma - ray events are expected to be retained .    the resulting event distribution of @xmath20 is shown in figure  [ fig : alpha ]  ( a ) ( left panel ) .",
    "a clear excess over the background is apparent around the source direction .",
    "the excess is broadly distributed , up to @xmath0  30@xmath1 , due to the deterioration of the pointing resolution , caused by the shrinkage of the gamma - ray shower image .",
    "this spread in @xmath20 distribution is consistent with simulations , as shown in the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : alpha ] .",
    "the off source distribution was normalized to that of the on source by the ratio of the number of the events in @xmath29 ( 0.88 ) , which is consistent with the ratio of observation times ( 0.86 ) , within statistical errors .",
    "an excess of 298@xmath252  events , with a significance of 5.7  @xmath3 ( calculated using the method of @xcite ) was obtained in the region of @xmath30 . for the confirmation of the detected signal ,",
    "the conventional parameterization cuts of 0@xmath1.2@xmath311@xmath1.1 , 0@xmath1.06@xmath320@xmath1.18 , and 0@xmath1.03@xmath330@xmath1.14 were applied to the data , and a signal of 286@xmath255  events was obtained with 5.2  @xmath3 significance .",
    "since the observations were undertaken at large zenith angles , @xmath0  70@xmath1 , we carefully examined the data and the simulations in more detail :    \\1 .",
    "the shrinkage of the shower image , which is problematic for large angle observations , was studied by a comparison between simulations and data using the background events due to cosmic - ray hadrons .",
    "figure  [ fig : para ] shows the imaging parameters @xmath17 and @xmath16 , observed at large ( @xmath070@xmath1 ) and small ( @xmath015@xmath1 ) zenith angles , respectively .",
    "the hadron simulations were made using the corsika code ( version 6.004 )  @xcite , considering the cosmic - ray abundance in the tev region  @xcite .",
    "the resultant distributions of the simulations agree with the data for both small and large angles .",
    "it is also noted that our high resolution imaging camera , which has a pixel spacing size of 0.115@xmath1 , helped to separate the smaller images of gamma - ray events from those of background events .",
    "the expected @xmath17 and @xmath16 distributions of the gamma - ray events , simulated with the spacing size of 0@xmath1.115 and 0@xmath1.230 , are shown in the bottom panels of figure  [ fig : para ] . with the larger pixel size , the reconstructed image size increases and",
    "becomes more similar to those of hadrons , with an estimated @xmath050  % decrease in the separation efficiency .",
    "although gamma - ray detection is still possible with the larger spacing , the higher resolution imaging camera is more advantageous for large zenith angle observations .",
    "the @xmath18 distribution of the gamma - ray selected events was compared to those from simulations .",
    "the location of cherenkov images due to gamma - ray cascades in the field of view has a particular distribution , while those due to hadron showers are uniformly distributed . for large zenith angle observations in particular , as the observed distances of gamma - ray shower images decrease",
    ", there is a substantial difference with the background distribution .",
    "figure  [ fig : distance ] shows the @xmath18 distribution of the gamma - ray selected events , which is obtained by subtracting the off source distribution from the on source distribution after the likelihood and @xmath20 cuts were applied .",
    "the resulting distribution has a clear peak around 0@xmath1.7 from the source direction , which agrees reasonably well with simulations and differs from that of the cosmic ray background , which provides additional confirmation of the detection of tev gamma - rays .",
    "the `` standard candle '' at tev energies , the crab nebula , was observed at relatively large zenith angles of @xmath055@xmath1 in november and december 2000 , and the gamma - ray flux was measured for the confirmation of the analysis method and the estimation of the systematic error in the energy scale .",
    "using the same analysis technique as that used for mrk  421 , the differential energy spectrum was derived over the energy range from 2  tev to @xmath020  tev  @xcite , which agrees well with other experiments  @xcite , within a @xmath015  % error in the energy scale .",
    "these consistencies provide robust supporting evidence for the detection of @xmath4  tev gamma - rays from mrk  421 .",
    "figure  [ fig : energyflux ] ( inserted panel ) shows the raw energy spectrum of the observed gamma - ray events from mrk  421 .",
    "the gamma - ray energy was assigned from the pulse - height sum of the individual pixels , using a relation obtained from the simulations .",
    "this method is similar to that described in @xcite , and an energy resolution of @xmath031  % is estimated .",
    "the excess events are distributed in the energy range 745  tev , however one must take care of the spill - over effect from the lower energies due to the finite energy resolution . in order to take this effect into account , simulated gamma - ray spectra , with the spectral indexes and cutoff energies varied , were compared to the data and the observed spectral parameters were determined from the values which minimized the value of @xmath34 . with the assumption of a power - law spectrum ,",
    "the differential flux was fitted by      with @xmath34=2.5/2  @xmath36 the cut dependence on @xmath24 and @xmath20 parameters , and the trigger conditions in the simulation , were considered as sources of the systematic uncertainties .",
    "the systematic errors giving rise to uncertainty in the energy scale such as cherenkov photon scattering in the atmosphere are not included here , but are considered in more detail later . the derived spectrum is steeper than those observed at lower tev energies .",
    "the spectral shape was tested with a cutoff spectrum of @xmath37 , as was derived from the measurements by the whipple and hegra - ct groups , with the spectral index being the hardest one observed during the strong flaring period  @xcite .",
    "the fitting result did not improve compared to that with the power - law assumption ( @xmath34=5.0/3  @xmath36 ) , as an excess of events above 20  tev is apparent , as shown in fig  [ fig : alpha ]  ( b ) .",
    "an excess of 103@xmath226 ( 4.0  @xmath3 ) was observed with @xmath38 , while 11  events are expected for the cutoff spectrum , based on an estimation using the event ratio between 1020  tev and over 20  tev .",
    "however , if a cutoff energy of 8  tev is assumed , the consistency with the data becomes better ( 48 events expected for @xmath39 ) .",
    "this cutoff energy is at the high end of the range allowed for mrk  501  ( @xcite , see also @xcite ) .",
    "since these two agns have similar redshifts , the cutoff energies in both spectra are expected to be similar , assuming the attenuation is predominantly due to infrared absorption .",
    "as there is only a 2@xmath3 difference between our observations and this prediction , our result falls in the acceptable range of the absorption hypothesis due to the cosmic infrared background .",
    "figure  [ fig : energyflux ] ( main panel ) shows the measured energy flux , assuming the power - law spectrum .",
    "data for the whipple  @xcite and hegra - ct groups  @xcite , observed during a similar period of the flaring state ( january  march 2001 ) are also shown .",
    "the observation periods were not exactly the same and the source varied significantly during this high state , therefore the absolute fluxes are expected to differ at some level .",
    "the absolute flux level determined from the cangaroo - ii data is within the observed range of the flux variation reported by the whipple group  @xcite , and the spectral slope around 10  tev is consistent with that of these two groups , supporting the roll - over from the flatter spectrum measured at lower energies .    for large zenith angle observations , a large uncertainty in the energy scale , due to the absorption of cherenkov photons in the atmosphere ,",
    "is inevitable .",
    "only rayleigh scattering was considered in the simulation code to avoid over - estimating the gamma - ray energies .",
    "the inclusion of mie scattering and ozone absorption would affect the energy scale by @xmath030  % and @xmath03  % , respectively , based on numerical estimations using the program code of @xcite .",
    "we stress that these effects increase the energy scale .",
    "the use of the `` flat - earth '' approximation for the atmosphere in the simulations requires a @xmath06  % correction which has already been taken into account in the discussion above .",
    "the measurement of spectra at large zenith angles was verified by observations of the crab nebula up to the zenith angles of @xmath055@xmath1 , although calibration using the crab nebula at the same zenith angles as the mrk  421 observations ( @xmath070@xmath1 ) is unfortunately impractical with the current instrumental sensitivity .",
    "the strong gamma - ray emission of mrk  421 ( @xmath0  3 times that of crab nebula ) enabled us to detect the source in only 14  hours . in order to detect the crab nebula at the same significance level , more than 150  hours observations would be required .    in summary , owing to the large effective area and the high resolution performance of the cherenkov imaging camera , e@xmath4010  tev gamma - rays from mrk  421 were detected at a high confidence level at zenith angles of @xmath070@xmath1 with 14  hours of observations .",
    "the derived spectrum in the region of 1030  tev is steeper than that around 1  tev , which supports the cutoff spectrum of mrk  421 measured in the 0.210  tev range by other groups .",
    "the excess observed above 20  tev is strongly suggestive of a higher cutoff energy , @xmath08  tev , compared to the lower energy observations .",
    "these observations confirm , with the support of detailed simulations , the viability of the large zenith angle technique .",
    "large zenith angle observations provide a unique method of measuring the spectrum in the important energy range above 10  tev with a relatively short observation time .",
    "the authors thank f.  krennrich and d.  horns for kindly providing flux data .",
    "this project is supported by a grant - in - aid for scientific research of ministry of education , culture , science , sports and technology of japan and australian research council . the receipt of jsps research fellowships is also acknowledged .",
