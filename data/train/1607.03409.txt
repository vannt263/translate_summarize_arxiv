    "the electrical control of magnetization dynamics has been a central issue in the field of spintronics@xcite , owing to its possible applications in magnetic memory devices with low power consumption .",
    "a particularly promising mechanism for the electrical control is to utilize the spin hall effect@xcite ( she ) in a normal metal ( nm ) , such as pt or ta , to convert an electric current into a spin current , and subsequently to magnetization dynamics in an adjacent magnet via mechanisms such as spin - transfer torque@xcite ( stt ) . in reverse , the inverse spin hall effect@xcite ( ishe ) can convert the spin current generated by certain means , for instance spin pumping@xcite , into an electric signal .",
    "a particularly intriguing phenomenon that involves both she and ishe is the spin hall magnetoresistance@xcite ( smr ) , in which a charge current in an nm causes a spin accumulation at the edge of the sample due to she , yielding a finite spin current at the interface to a ferromagnet . through ishe",
    ", the spin current gives an electromotive force along the original charge current , effectively changing the magnetoresistance of the nm .",
    "the two major ingredients that determine smr are the spin diffusion@xcite in the nm and the spin current at the nm / ferromagnet interface .",

    "this approach solves the spin diffusion equation in the presence of she and ishe in a self - consistent manner , where the spin current at the nm / fmi interface serves as a boundary condition .",
    "however , the interface spin current remains an external parameter for which experimental or numerical input is needed@xcite .",
    "on the other hand , a quantum tunneling formalism has emerged recently as an inexpensive tool to calculate the interface spin current from various material properties such as the insulating gap of the fmi and the interface @xmath3 coupling@xcite . the quantum tunneling theory",
    "also successfully explains@xcite the reduced spin pumping spin current when an additional oxide layer is inserted between nm and fmi@xcite .",
    "it is then of fundamental importance to combine the spin diffusion approach with the quantum tunneling formalism for the interface spin current to give a complete theoretical description of the smr , in particular to quantify how various material properties influence the smr .    in this article",
    "we provide a minimal formalism that bridges the quantum tunneling formalism to the spin diffusion approach .",
    "we focus on the smr in nm / fmi bilayer realized in pt / yig , and the nm / ferromagnetic metal ( nm / fmm ) bilayer realized in pt / co and ta / co@xcite . the spin diffusion in the nm is assumed to be described by the same formalism of chen _",
