    "this magnetic field component is perpendicular to the applied magnetic field and is generated by the sample magnetization in a way that depends on the sample shape and spatial distribution of the magnetization .",
    "the proportionality constant is not known @xmath89 .",

    "these data are seen to be linear in temperature and to intercept the temperature axis at @xmath102 k , a value smaller than @xmath103 due to local demagnetization effects .",
    "we determine the prefactor @xmath91 from the slope of independently measured squid magnetometer data .",
    "we then fix @xmath104 by shifting @xmath64 along the temperature axis so that the measured @xmath64 extrapolated to zero temperature coincides with the squid data .",

    "in essence , this procedure yields a value for the function @xmath100 which expresses the non - mean - field non - pure - system physics , thereby enabling a cross - comparison between different samples and between experiment and theory @xcite .",

    "<S> recent interest in dipolar magnetism has focused on systems in which quantum fluctuations of the spins compete with the dipolar long range order . </S>",
    "<S> of particular interest in this context are the single molecule magnets ( smm ) composed of molecules of transition - metal ions that behave as single , rigid magnetic entities with a large ground - state spin and a strong uniaxial anisotropy , leading to ising - like behavior . </S>",

    "<S> the solid green line shows the result for the case with no tilt angle ( tfifm ) . ]    in summary , these studies demonstrate that the magnetic susceptibility of mn@xmath0-ac - meoh follows the behavior expected for a transverse field ising ferromagnet , in marked contrast with mn@xmath0-ac . </S>",
    "<S> the temperature dependence of the susceptibility and the dependence of the ( extrapolated ) weiss temperature on applied transverse field are different for the two materials . </S>",
    "<S> more broadly , the availability of these two very similar smms with distinct types of magnetism provides unique opportunities for experimental studies of the effect of randomness on quantum phase transitions and magnetic relaxation . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , large transverse fields ( @xmath88 t ) that enhance pure quantum tunnel relaxation ( tunneling relaxation without the need for thermal activation ) will enable equilibrium susceptibility studies down to very low temperature ( mk ) . </S>",
