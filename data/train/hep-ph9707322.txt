    "<S> the negative binomial fits are satisfactory in narrow pseudorapidity intervals but for @xmath67 the nbd fails to reproduce the observed shape of @xmath0 . according to widespread opinion the failure of the nbd is caused by the much quoted shoulder structure . in narrow bins </S>",
    "<S> this is not visible but for @xmath67 some kind of structure can indeed be seen in the tail of @xmath0 . however , the dominant source of discrepancy between the nbd and observations has nothing to do with the shoulder . </S>",
    "<S> it was demonstrated already in  [ 16 ] that the real difficulty for wide @xmath68-intervals is the pronounced narrow peak of the heavy tailed distributions . </S>",
    "<S> performing hnbd fits reveals clearly that the @xmath13 special case is unable to reproduce a highly skewed shape which is so characteristic of the ua5 data for @xmath67 . but letting @xmath29 to vary freely in the fits it turns out that the @xmath46 , @xmath47 limiting case of the hnbd , i.e. the poisson transformed log - normal distribution , yields reasonable description of @xmath0 possessing a narrow peak and extended tail . </S>",
    "<S> the results for full phase - space and wide @xmath68-windows are collected in table  3 . </S>",
    "<S> although systematic deviations between the experimental and theoretical @xmath0 inevitably occur due to the shoulder structure ( the hnbd is unimodal ) the overall shape of the multiplicity distributions can be reproduced remarkably well by the two - parameter poisson transformed log - normal law . for the full phase - space data the fit </S>",
    "<S> is illustrated in fig .  1 .    interestingly , the log - normal limit of the hnbd was found to be successful also in @xmath1 annihilations at the @xmath69 peak . in ref .  [ 7 ] the results of three - parameter hnbd fits were presented favouring @xmath70 for the full phase - space multiplicity distributions . </S>",
    "<S> here we provide the outcome of two - parameter poisson transformed log - normal fits , see table  4 . </S>",
    "<S> the analysed data sets now include the aleph data with updated systematic errors and the opal data corresponding to @xmath71  gev  [ 17 ] . </S>",
    "<S> as is seen the quality of fits are satisfactory for each experiment . </S>",
    "<S> similar results can be obtained for the aleph data measured in central rapidity windows  [ 18 ] , these are quoted in table  5 . </S>",
    "<S> we have to mention that the delphi data in @xmath72-intervals exhibit significant shoulder structure which can not be reproduced by unimodal distributions and therefore the hnbd fails as well .    </S>",
    "<S> the importance of the log - normal distribution to approximate @xmath0 in @xmath1 and @xmath4 collisions has already been stressed in the literature  [ 19 ] . </S>",
    "<S> one may think that the observed success of the poisson transformed log - normal law is only another manifestation of the above cited results . </S>",
    "<S> but the widely known and accepted evidences for the log - normality of @xmath0 at present energies are not rarely questionable </S>",
    "<S> . their comparison to our findings ( which indicate that log - normality emerges asymptotically ) will be treated in a separate paper  [ 20 ] .    in conclusion , we have investigated the h - function extension of the nbd obtained by the poisson transform of the generalized gamma distribution  eq .  </S>",

    "<S> ( 2 ) involves as special and limiting cases many classical probability densities , the hnbd is expected to obey high degree of flexibility . </S>",
    "<S> our applications confirmed this expectation . </S>",
    "<S> fitting the hnbd to various multiplicity data claimed to be in disagreement with the pure nbd we have obtained satisfactory results . according to these findings , </S>",
    "<S> two major types of departure from @xmath13 arise in multiparticle production . for inelastic @xmath3 and deep - inelastic @xmath2 scattering </S>",
    "<S> the dominant source of discrepancy is the less steep rise of @xmath0 at small multiplicities caused by the diffractive component of the underlying dynamics ( at least for @xmath3 data ) . </S>",
    "<S> the multiplicity distributions can be reproduced successfully by the weibull case of the hnbd with @xmath63 . </S>",
    "<S> the other @xmath16 type behaviour arises in non - diffractive @xmath4 collisions at @xmath61  gev where the nbd is incompatible with the highly skewed shape of @xmath0 for @xmath67 . </S>",
    "<S> these heavy tailed distributions with a narrow peak are best described if @xmath46 and @xmath47 , i.e. by the log - normal limit of the hnbd . despite of the absence of skew multiplicity curves , the same type of departure from the pure nbd has been observed also in @xmath1 annihilations at lep energies . </S>",
    "<S> this remarkable ubiquity of the @xmath46 limit for the @xmath1 and @xmath4 data at top energies has a natural explanation based on renormalization group arguments for asymptotic kno scaling  [ 20 ] </S>",
    "<S> . it will be interesting to see how precisely can the poisson transformed log - normal law reproduce the forthcoming @xmath4 data at @xmath73 gev at tevatron .    </S>",
    "<S> the observed success of the hnbd indicates that the majority of existing multiplicity data can be interpreted on the basis of the asymptotic kno scaling form of the negative binomial distribution with the extension of its validity to positive powers of the scaling variable . </S>",
    "<S> it is hoped that in the next 25 years the hnbd will provide a helpful unifying framework to study the nb regularity and the origin of possible deviations . </S>"
