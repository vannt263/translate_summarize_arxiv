    "this paper reviews some recent results on a topic with a considerable history : the periodic forcing of limit cycles .",
    "some 80 years ago , van der pol and van der mark observed that irregularities developed when certain electrical circuits exhibiting stable oscillations were periodically forced @xcite .",
    "their work stimulated a number of analytical studies ; see _ e.g. _ @xcite .",
    "another classical example of driven oscillators is the fitzhugh - nagumo neuron model  @xcite ; the response of this and other models of biological rhythms to external perturbations have been extensively studied ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) . as a topic of mathematical study , the dynamics of forced oscillations",
    "is well motivated : oscillatory behavior are ubiquitous in physical , biological , and engineered systems , and external forcing , whether artificially applied or as a way to model forces not intrinsic to the system , is also commonplace .    in this article",
    ", we are not concerned with modeling specific physical phenomena .",
    "instead , we consider a generic dynamical system with a limit cycle , and seek to understand its qualitative behavior when the system is periodically disturbed . to limit the scope of the problem , we restrict ourselves to periodic _ kicks _ , or forcings that are turned on for only short durations , leaving the limit cycle ample time to restore itself during the relaxation period .",
    "we are interested in large - time behavior , particularly in questions of stability and chaos .",
    "as we will show , one of the properties of the limit cycle that plays a key role in determining whether the kicked system is stable or chaotic is _ shear _ , by which we refer to the differential in speed ( or angular velocity ) for orbits near the limit cycle .",
    "a central theme of this article is that under suitable conditions , the impact of a kick can be substantially magnified by the underlying shear in the unforced system , leading to the formation of horseshoes and strange attractors .",
    "this does not always happen , however : some limit cycles are more vulnerable , and some types of kicks are more effective than others .",
    "these ideas are discussed in @xcite and @xcite , the material which forms the basis of the present review .",
    "even though we seek to provide insight into dynamical mechanisms that operate under general conditions , we have found the ideas to be most transparent in a very simple linear shear model , to which we will devote a nontrivial part of the paper .",
    "1 introduces this example and familiarizes the reader with the various parameters ( including the one which measures shear ) ; it also reports on results of a numerical study on lyapunov exponents .",
    "2 and 3 are organized around explaining these simulation results . along the way",
    ", we take the opportunity to review a number of mathematical ideas which clearly go beyond this one example . some of the rigorous results reviewed , notably those on srb measures for a relevant class of strange attractors @xcite , are recent developments . with the main ingredients of the linear shear model and the relevant mathematical background in hand , we return to a discussion of general limit cycles in the final section .",
    "this section introduces the main example we use in this review , and acquaints the reader with the various parameters in the model and how they impact the dynamics .",
    "of particular interest to us is the effect of increasing _",
    "numerically computed lyapunov exponents as functions of shear are presented in sect .",
    ". they will serve as a focal point for some discussions to follow .",
    "our main example is the periodic kicking of a linear shear flow with a hyperbolic limit cycle .",
    "this 2d model was studied rigorously in  @xcite and numerically in  @xcite .",
    "though exceedingly simple in appearance , it already exhibits rich and complex dynamical behaviors .",
    "the model is given by @xmath0 \\dot{y } & = & -\\lambda y~+~a\\cdot \\sin(2\\pi\\theta ) \\cdot\\sum_{n=-\\infty}^\\infty \\delta(t - n\\tau)\\ , \\\\",

    ". we will refer to eq .",
    "( [ model1 ] ) with @xmath6 as the _ unforced equation _ , and the term involving @xmath7 as the _ forcing _ or the _ kick_. here @xmath8 is the usual @xmath8-function , that is to say , the kicks occur instantaneously at times @xmath9 .",
    "more precisely , let @xmath10 denote the flow corresponding to the unforced equation .",
    "it is easy to see that for all @xmath11 , @xmath12 tends to the limit cycle @xmath13 as @xmath14 .",
    "the precise meaning of eq .",
    "( [ model1 ] ) is as follows : let @xmath15 be the kick map ; it represents the action of the forcing term . then assuming we start with a kick at time @xmath16 , the time-@xmath4 map of the flow generated by eq .",
    "( [ model1 ] ) is @xmath17 and the evolution of the system is defined by iterating @xmath18 .",
    "we generally assume that @xmath4 is not too small , so that during the relaxation period between kicks , the flow @xmath10 of the unforced equation  restores \" the system to some degree",
    ".    the parameters of interest are : @xmath19 our aim in the remainder of this section is to understand  via geometric reasoning and numerical simulations  the meanings of these quantities , and the roles they play in questions of stability and chaos .",
    "our line of reasoning follows @xcite and @xcite .",
    "a simple way to gain intuition on the geometry of @xmath18 is to study the @xmath18-image of @xmath20 , the limit cycle of the unforced system .",
    "we will do so by freezing some of the parameters and varying others .",
    "* effects of varying @xmath21 , and @xmath7 *    to begin with , let us freeze @xmath22 @xmath23 and @xmath4 . to fix ideas ,",
    "let us take @xmath24 to be relatively small , so that the rate of contraction is weak , and choose @xmath4 large enough that @xmath25 is a nontrivial contraction .",
    "this is when the effects of shear are seen most clearly . in fig .  1 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 .",
    "here @xmath28 because the limit cycle @xmath20 has period @xmath29 and @xmath4 is an integer multiple of this period ; for non - integer @xmath4 the picture is shifted horizontally .",

    "the larger @xmath30 , the greater the difference in velocity between two points with different @xmath31 coordinates .",
    "this applies in particular to the highest and lowest points in @xmath32 in fig .",
    "for @xmath30 small enough , order in the @xmath33-direction is preserved , _",
    "i.e. _ , for @xmath34 and @xmath35 , @xmath36 will continue to have a slightly smaller @xmath33-coordinate than @xmath37 .",
    "as @xmath30 increases , some points in @xmath20 may  overtake \" others , spoiling this order . as @xmath30 gets larger still",
    ", the total distances traveled in @xmath4 units of time vary even more , and a fold develops .",

    ", title=\"fig : \" ] +  @xmath33 + ( b ) the attractor @xmath45    * smale s horseshoes *    horseshoes are likely present starting from @xmath30 somewhere between @xmath46 and @xmath29 for @xmath4 large enough .",
    "an example of an easily recognizable horseshoe for @xmath47 and @xmath27 is shown in fig .",
    "the larger @xmath30 , the easier it is to give examples .",
    "3(a ) illustrates how proofs of horseshoes or uniformly hyperbolic invariant sets are often done : one first  spots \" a horseshoe with one s eyes , namely one or more boxes that map across themselves in a characteristic way , and then proves that the set of points that remain in these boxes forever has the required splitting into expanding and contracting directions .",
    "when @xmath48 is large , @xmath49 expands strongly in the @xmath33-direction for most values of @xmath33 ; contraction is guaranteed since @xmath50 .    given @xmath51 , @xmath18 has a horseshoe if @xmath52 is sufficiently large .",
    "the presence of horseshoes is sometimes equated with dynamical complexity or chaos in the literature , and that is entirely justified insofar as one refers to the _ existence _ of chaotic orbits .",
    "one must not confuse the existence of these orbits with chaotic behavior starting from  most \" or ",
    "typical \" initial conditions , however : a system can have a horseshoe ( which attracts a lebesgue measure zero set ) , and have all other points in the phase space tending to a sink . or , the horseshoe can be part of a",
    " strange attractor \" , with @xmath53 .",
    "the presence of a horseshoe alone does not tell us which of these scenarios will prevail .",
    "we will say more about strange attractors _ versus _ sinks in sect .  3.1 .",
    "suffice it to observe here that horseshoes clearly exist for most of the parameters in fig .",

    "* sinks from homoclinic tangencies *    for larger shear , the attractor can be quite complicated ; see fig .",
    "3(b ) . yet",
    "in figs .",
    "2(d ) , ( e ) , and even ( f ) , sinks can also occur as noted .",
    "the following is purely theoretical , in the sense that we do not know exactly where the sinks are in these specific systems , but it is a general fact in two dimensions that near homoclinic tangencies of dissipative saddle fixed points (  dissipative \" means @xmath55 ) , sinks form easily , meaning one can perturb the map and find one near such a tangency ; see @xcite .",
    "furthermore , tangencies persist once the stable and unstable manifolds of a horseshoe are shown to meet tangentially somewhere . while no results have been proved for this particular model , the  turns \" made by unstable manifolds ( see fig .",
    "3(b ) ) suggest the abundance of opportunities for such tangencies .",
    "in this section we focus on the case of _ positive _ lyapunov exponents , having discussed negative and zero values of @xmath54 in section 2 .",

    "the setting of this subsection is as follows : let @xmath56 be a riemannian manifold or simply @xmath57 .",

    "we will adopt the viewpoint that _ observable events are represented by positive lebesgue measure sets , _ and are interested in invariant measures that reflect the properties of lebesgue measure , which we denote by @xmath64 . for chaotic systems , the only invariant measures known to have this property are srb measures .",
    "( the terms lebesgue and riemannian measures will be used interchangeably in this article . )",
    "an @xmath59-invariant borel probability measure @xmath65 is called an srb measure  if    \\(a ) @xmath66-a.e . ,",
    "and    \\(b ) the conditional measures of @xmath65 on local unstable manifolds have densities with    respect to the riemannian measures on these manifolds .",
    "recall from the multiplicative ergodic theorem  @xcite that lyapunov exponents , in particular @xmath54 , are defined @xmath65-a.e .",
    ", so ( a ) makes sense ; in general , these quantities may vary from point to point .",
    "the meaning of ( b ) can be understood as follows . for an invariant measure to reflect the properties of @xmath64",
    ", it is simplest if it has a density with respect to @xmath64 , but that is generally not possible for attractors : all invariant measures in @xmath61 must live on @xmath45 , and if @xmath59 is volume decreasing , which is often the case near an attractor , then @xmath67 .",
    "the idea of srb measures is that if @xmath65 can not have a density , then the next best thing is for it to have a density in unstable directions , the intuition being that the stretching of phase space in these directions leads to a smoothing of distributions .",
    "the main result on srb measures is summarized in the next proposition , followed by a sketch of its proof .",
    "the ideas in the proof will explain how srb measures , which are themselves singular , are related to lebesgue measure .",
    "recall that for an ergodic measure @xmath65 , @xmath54 is constant @xmath65-a.e .",
    "we will denote this number by @xmath68 .",

    "it remains to show that the set of points @xmath31 that are connected to @xmath65-typical points as above has positive @xmath64-measure , and that is true by the absolute continuity of the stable foliation @xcite .    a little bit of history : srb measures were invented by sinai , ruelle and bowen in the 1970s , when they constructed for every attractor satisfying smale s axiom a @xcite a special invariant measure with the properties in definition 3.1 ( @xcite )",
    "this special invariant measure has a number of other interesting properties ; see _ e.g. _ @xcite for more information . at about the same time , building on oseledec s theorem on lyapunov exponents @xcite , pesin @xcite and ruelle @xcite extended the uniform theory of hyperbolic systems , also known as axiom a theory , to an almost - everywhere theory in which positive and negative lyapunov exponents replace the uniform expansion and contraction in axiom a. the idea of an srb measure was brought to this broader setting and studied there by mostly ledrappier and young ; see _ e.g. _  @xcite .",
    "* the existence problem *    while the idea and relevant properties of srb measures were shown to make sense in this larger setting , existence was not guaranteed .",
    "indeed for an attractor outside of the axiom a category , no matter how chaotic it appears , there is , to this day , no general theory that will tell us whether or not it has an srb measure .    here",
    "is where the difficulty lies : by definition , an axiom a attractor has well - separated expanding and contracting directions that are invariant under the dynamics , so that tangent vectors in expanding directions are guaranteed some amount of growth with every iterate . in general , an attractor that appears chaotic to the eye must expand somewhere ; this is how instabilities are created .",
    "but since volume is decreased , there must also be directions that are compressed . without further assumptions , for most points @xmath79 and tangent vectors @xmath83",

    "the absence of cancellations between expansion and contraction is what sets axiom a attractors apart from general chaotic attractors .",
    "this subsection reviews some work by wang and young @xcite on a class of strange attractors .",
    "these attractors have a single direction of instability and strong contraction in all complementary directions . among systems without _ a priori _ separation of expanding and contracting directions ( or invariant cones ) , this is the only class to date for which progress has been made on the existence of srb measures .",
    "the idea is as follows : one embeds the systems of interest in a larger collection , letting @xmath86 denote an upper bound on their contraction in all but one of the directions ( more precisely the second largest singular value of @xmath87 ) .",
    "one then lets @xmath88 in what is called the _ singular limit_. _ if _ this operation results in a family of well defined 1d maps , and _",
    "if _ some of these 1d maps carry strong enough expansion , then one can try to conclude that for small but positive @xmath86 , some of the systems have srb measures . obviously , this scheme is relevant only for attractors that have a 1d character to begin with . for these attractors ,",
    "what is exploited here is the fact that 1d objects , namely those in the singular limit , are more tractable than the original @xmath85-dimensional maps .",
    "since it is not illuminating to include all technical details in a review such as this one , we refer the reader to @xcite , sect .  1 , for a formal statement , giving only enough information here to convey the flavor of the main result :",

    "we further limit the scope of our discussion in the following two ways : ( i ) kicks that are too weak will not be considered ; such kicks produce invariant curves and sinks for the same reasons given in sect .",

    "what is different here is that unlike our earlier example , where the propensity for shear - induced chaos is determined entirely by parameters in the unforced equation , namely @xmath30 and @xmath24 , we see in this more general setting that it matters how the kick is applied .",
    "_ it is the geometry of the action of @xmath183 on the limit cycle @xmath20 in relation to the strong stable foliation @xmath202 that determines the stability or chaos of the kicked system . _ * the case of stronger contraction is more tractable mathematically for the following reason : when the contraction in @xmath18 is weak , as with @xmath215 in fig .  4 , one has to deal with the cumulative effects of multiple kicks , which are difficult to treat .",
    "when the image @xmath216 is pressed more strongly against @xmath20 , as in the case of @xmath217 , cumulative effects of consecutive kicks are lessened .    we illustrate some of the ideas above in the examples below .    * linear shear - flow examples *    * the 2d system in eq .",

    "let us assume @xmath228 , _",

    "as noted in item ( i ) above , kick components orthogonal to @xmath231 are `` dissipated '' and do not have much effect .",
    "if @xmath232 constant , then @xmath233 simply permutes the @xmath202-planes and again no chaotic behavior will ensue .",
    "to produce horseshoes and strange attractors , a sufficient amount of _ variation _ in @xmath33 for @xmath214 is needed as noted in item ( ii ) above ; that variation must come from @xmath234 .",

    "finally , given @xmath236 constant , to maximize the variation of @xmath214 in @xmath33 for large @xmath4 , the discussion above suggests kicking in a direction @xmath237 that maximizes @xmath238 . under the conditions above , this direction is unique and is given by @xmath239 .",
    "notice that this need not be the direction with the least damping or the direction with maximal shear , but one that optimizes the combined effect of both .    * on analytic proofs *    when @xmath18 contracts strongly enough , the system falls into the _ rank one _ category as defined in sect .",
    "3.2 , independently of the dimension of the phase space .",
    "this comes from the fact that @xmath10 carries all points back to @xmath20 , which is a one - dimensional object .",
    "if the folding ( as described in item ( ii ) above ) is significant enough for the amount of contraction present , then horseshoes can be shown to exist .",

    "as always , these conditions need to be verified from example to example .",
    "we have reviewed a set of results on the periodic kicking of limit cycles .",
    "the main message is that the effect of the kick can be magnified by the underlying shear in the unforced system to create an unexpected amount of dynamical complexity .",
    "it is an example of a phenomenon known as _ shear - induced chaos_.    a similar geometric mechanism is used to prove the existence of strange attractors in ( a ) certain examples of slow - fast systems @xcite ; ( b ) periodic kicking of systems undergoing supercritical hopf bifurcations ( see @xcite for details , and @xcite for results applicable to evolutionary pdes ) ; and ( c ) periodic forcing of near - homoclinic loops @xcite . see also @xcite .",
    "all of these results pertain to strong - contraction regimes ; proofs are perturbative and rely on the theory of rank one attractors reviewed in sect .",
    "a welcome extension of the results reviewed here is to remove the strong - contraction assumption for strange attractors , but this is likely to be challenging : one has to either develop non - perturbative techniques or go about the problem in a less direct way .    _",
    "random forcing _ is a future direction we believe to be both interesting and promising .",
