    "the term  quantum turbulence \" or  superfluid turbulence \" refers to a tangle of interacting quantized vortex lines , which are formed , for example , in superfluid @xmath0he , @xmath1he or in bose - einstein condensates of ultra - cold atoms .",
    "the vorticity in superfluids is restricted to a set of vortex lines around which the circulation is quantized to multiples of the circulation quantum @xmath2 . here",
    "@xmath3 is plank s constant and @xmath4 is mass of either atoms with integer spin , like @xmath0he or cooper pairs of @xmath1he atoms .",
    "the creation of sustained quantum turbulence can be achieved by either mechanical excitations @xcite , or by heat currents ( so - called counterflow turbulence ) .",
    "experimental studies of thermal counterflow , initiated almost sixty years ago by vinen @xcite , became the most extensively studied forms of quantum turbulence  @xcite    in the context of the popular two - fluid model of superfluids the phenomenon of thermal counterflow may be considered as consisting of two interpenetrating fluid flows - a normal viscous component flowing in the direction of the temperature gradient and carrying the heat flux , and an inviscid superfluid component flowing in the opposite direction to keep a zero total mass transfer .",
    "these two components may have different velocity and density fields .",
    "more sophisticated arrangements  @xcite allow one to realize ( mechanically driven ) pure super - flows in a relatively wide ( 7 - 10 mm ) channel , with the normal fluid component practically at rest .",
    "in both arrangements , a dense vortex tangle is excited under the influence of the velocity difference between the two components quantum turbulence .",
    "some statistical properties of quantum vortex tangles in counter- and super - flows were studied experimentally and numerically @xcite , among seminal contributions to these studies we should mentioned again a pioneering work by vinen @xcite , in which he also suggested a phenomenological description of counterflow turbulence , eq .",
    "( 17 ) and by schwarz @xcite , who established some important bridge - relationships between mean characteristics of the vortex tangle and pioneered numerical simulations of the counterflow turbulence mainly in the local induction approximation ( see sec .",
    "later adachi , fujiyama , and tsubota @xcite demonstrated that for an adequate numerical study of the counterflow turbulence one has to relax this approximation and to use the biot - savart equation ( 10a ) , according to which each point of the vortex line is swept by the velocity field produced by the entire tangle .",
    "the development of the field was recently reviewed in @xcite .",
    "the intensity of quantum turbulence is usually characterized by the vortex line density per unit volume , sometime referred as vld and denoted by @xmath5 .",
    "another related characteristic is the intervortex distance @xmath6 .",
    "other properties of the tangle , such as the mean curvature , scale with @xmath7  @xcite .    during temporal evolution vortex lines can collide and reconnect changing the tangle s topology .",
    "thus vortex loops can merge or break up into smaller loops .",
    "these reconnections occur on scales comparable with the vortex core radius and were studied in the approximation of the gross - pitaevskii equation @xcite .",
    "this approximation is adequate when the vortex core radius exceeds significantly the interatomic distance , like in @xmath1he , but not in the @xmath0he .",
    "recently the reconnection events were visualized experimentally @xcite .",
    "reconnections play a crucial role in the vortex dynamics .",
    "in particular they directly affect the steady state value of @xmath7 . in typical experimental conditions",
    "the vortex tangle is dense in the sense that the intervortex distance @xmath7 is much smaller than the characteristic size of the experimental cell @xmath8 , which is about 1 cm . at the same time",
    "the tangle is sparse enough such that @xmath7 is much larger than the vortex core radius @xmath9 , which is of the order of @xmath10  cm in @xmath0he . to follow the evolution of the vortex tangle at the intermediate scales @xmath11 , schwarz @xcite proposed to use a vortex filament method ( sometime referred to as vfm ) in which minor core variations of the quantized vortices are ignored and the vortices are approximated as directional lines with a predefined core structure .",
    "if so , the time evolution of these vortex lines is governed by the biot - savart equation  .",
    "numerically vortex lines may be approximated as a set of small straight vortex filaments described by a directional set of connected points placed at distances much smaller than @xmath7 .",
    "the biot - savart equation for quantized vortices does not describe the vortex reconnections .",
    "they are included in vortex filament methods as an additional artificial procedure that changes the connectivity of pairs of points according to some reconnection criterion .",
    "reconnection criteria are based on a physical intuition and the results of numerical simulations .",
    "since the method introduction by schwarz @xcite , a number of different criteria @xcite were introduced and modified over time . currently , three criteria are frequently used to trigger the reconnections during the evolution of the vortex tangle .",
    "these are based either on geometrical proximity @xcite or on the dynamics of vortex filaments  @xcite , leading to a different number of reconnections and various changes in the vortex tangle topology .",
    "the presence of variety of artificial reconnection procedures in vortex filament methods and the spread in values of basic characteristics of the tangle , such as the vortex reconnection rates and steady - state vortex line density @xmath12 , resulted in the superfluid community sharing an opinion that was made explicit recently by skrbek and sreenivassan  @xcite :  while it is clear that the full biot - savart approach is certainly better [ than the local - induction approximation ( lia ) , see below ] , there are still other aspects such as approach to vortex reconnections and influence of possible normal fluid turbulence that make the predictive power of these simulations limited at the best . \"    in this paper we consider this strong statement as a research challenge , turning it to our main question :  to what extent can one state that the statistical properties of the developed vortex tangles obtained by vortex filament methods ( in a wide range of parameters ) are robust under changes of the reconnection procedures and other implementation details ? \" . to answer this question we report in this paper the results of comprehensive numerical simulations of counterflow turbulence for a wide range of parameters : at low , medium and high temperatures @xmath13 ( 1.3 , 1.6 and 1.9 k ) and the counterflow velocities @xmath14 ranging from @xmath15 to @xmath16  cm / s . for all combinations of temperatures and velocities",
    "we compared results of vortex filament method with three different reconnection criteria  @xcite .",
    "we found which properties are strongly affected by the choice of the reconnection criteria ( e.g. the reconnection rate differs more than in order of magnitude for different criteria ) , which properties only relatively weakly depend on this choice ( such as mean properties of the tangle ) and which are insensitive to it ( such as probability distribution functions of local properties ) .",
    "our results partially agree with preliminary observations by baggaley  @xcite who recently compared the values of the vortex line density calculated with a number of reconnection criteria for @xmath17 and @xmath18cm / s and concluded that the values of @xmath19 are insensitive to the choice of the criterion for these parameters .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ s : stat ] we describe mean and local statistical characteristics of vortex tangle beginning with a summary of the main notations and abbreviations used in the paper .",

    "a more advanced description of continuous media was reached in statistical physics and kinetics in the framework of probability distribution functions , pdfs , ( e.g. maxwell - boltzmann pdf of atomic velocities ) and correlation functions ( e.g. of atomic positions ) .",
    "similarly , the measurable mean characteristics of the vortex tangle provide important but very limited information on the tangle properties .",

    "we find that on average the tangle is slightly polarized and this polarization @xmath187 depends on the intervortex distance @xmath7 , but not on the temperature : see fig.[f:16]c where we plot @xmath187 as a function of @xmath7 for three temperatures .",
    "the value of @xmath7 at given @xmath13 was varied by the counterflow velocity . here",
    "again there is no noticeable difference in the values and dependencies of @xmath183 and @xmath187 for different reconnection criteria , therefore only gec case is displayed .",
    "the most important observation in fig.[f:16]c is that @xmath188 i.e. is vanishingly small with respect to unity .",
    "this means that there is no coherent contribution ( of many vortex lines ) to the velocity field at large scales ( much above @xmath7 ) .",
    "therefore the energy spectrum of the turbulent vortex tangle , @xmath189 , has to be determined by contributions of individual vortex lines even for @xmath190 , up to the box size .",
    "in this section we present a summary of the result obtained here and in other studies of counterflow turbulence .        in analogy to classical hydrodynamic turbulence ,",
    "the basic models of counterflow turbulence are based on the assumption of spatial homogeneity of the problem . in laboratory experiments on counterflow in @xmath0he",
    "this can be realized to some extent in a wide channel or a pipe of transverse size @xmath8 that significantly exceeds the intervortex distance @xmath7 .",
    "for example , in the super flow experiments of ref .",
    "@xcite the largest @xmath191 cm , while @xmath7 varies ( approximately ) from 0.1 to @xmath192 cm ( for @xmath193cm / s ) .    in numerical simulations ( like ours )",
    "the homogeneity can be simply reached with periodic boundary conditions . again",
    "the size of the box @xmath8 ( cube in our case ) should be larger than @xmath7 . in our simulations",
    "@xmath194 cm , while @xmath7 varies from @xmath195 cm to @xmath196 , as seen in fig .",
    "[ f:5 ] .    one additional simplifying assumption made in our study ( and many others ) is that the flow of the normal component is laminar . in numerical simulations ( including ours ) this simply requires @xmath197const . in experiments",
    "this is achieved to some extent in a core of a wide - channel counterflow , when @xmath14 is below some critical value @xmath198 , above which the normal fluid flow is expected to become turbulent .",
    "probably a better realization of the laminarity assumption in laboratory experiments is achieved in the  pure \" super flow , where normal fluid flow is prevented by super leaks , a kind of ( e.g. silver ) porous medium with sub - micron size pores to prevent a net flow of the viscous normal component through the channel on any experimentally relevant flow time scale , see e.g. ref .",
    "now , if one neglect the @xmath199 dependence on the ( transverse ) distance to the wall , the entire problem can be approximated as spatially homogeneous .    in order to relax the assumption of space homogeneity one has to develop a theory ( or a model ) of superfluid wall - bounded flow which will find and account for an actual laminar super- and normal - fluid velocity profiles across a channel .",
    "this is still an open problem .",
    "even more sophisticated and challenging open problem is a superfluid wall - bounded turbulence at large counterflow velocities , when both the normal and the superfluid components are turbulent and their mean - velocity and turbulent - energy profiles have to be found self - consistently , accounting for the mutual friction between the components .",
    "detailed information about the vortex tangle structure , found and analyzed in this paper , is required to successfully approach this problem .",
    "this was one of the important motivations for the present study .",
    "it is generally accepted that the classical hydrodynamic turbulence is almost isotropic at small scales @xmath200 due to the isotropization effect that is observed going from the outer scale @xmath8 toward the small scales @xmath163 .",
    "the theory of small scale turbulence then simplifies . in the counterflow case",
    "there is no energy cascade and the superfluid counterfow turbulence is inherently anisotropic due to the built - in direction of the counterflow velocity @xmath119 .",
    "this anisotropy is of principal importance and can not be ignored at all .",
    "indeed , in the isotropic case there is no friction force between the normal- and superfluid components and the counterflow does not create a vortex tangle .",
    "one can formally see this from the following argument : consider the parameter @xmath201 that quantifies the mutual friction and @xmath62 that determines the vortex tangle density ( sects .",
    "[ sss : phen - an ] and [ sss : fric ] ) .",
    "both are proportional to the anisotropy parameter @xmath95 , which is equal to zero in the isotropic tangle .    nevertheless , in a spatially homogeneous case with the only relevant direction @xmath119 one expects to see axial symmetry around @xmath119 . indeed , in our simulations the coefficient @xmath202 [ defined by eq",
    "] , which is responsible for the axial asymmetry , is close to zero .",
    "the second parameter is the vortex core radius @xmath9 . in @xmath0he @xmath205 cm . in the theory of counterflow turbulence @xmath9",
    "appears in the combination with the intervortex distance @xmath7 as a dimensionless parameter @xmath206 .",
    "more accurate definition of @xmath207 is given by eq .",
    ", where we also introduced @xmath208 .",
    "the parameter @xmath209 naturally appears in the equations of motion for the vortex line in the local induction approximation .",
    "table  [ t:1 ] shows that in actual experimental situations @xmath209 is very close to unity .",
    "additional dimensionless parameters are @xmath136 and @xmath122 which determine the mutual friction force [ according to eq .  ] .",
    "of the two @xmath136 is more important , being responsible for the dissipative part . as one sees in tab .",
    "[ t:1 ] , @xmath136 varies in the relevant temperature range by a favor of 8 , being much smaller than unity ( @xmath210 ) at @xmath211 and approaching unity , when @xmath13 is close to @xmath212 , see tab .",
    "[ t:1 ] .",
    "we have also to mention the ratio of normal and superfluid densities @xmath213 .",

    "it varies about ten times ( from 0.045 to 0.42 , see tab .",
    "[ t:1 ] ) in the studied temperature range .",
    "having so many dimensionless parameters that essentially deviate from unity and vary significantly with temperature , one may think that dimensional reasonings are useless in our problem .",
    "however , as we have shown in the paper , they are still useful . being supplemented with simple physical arguments they give quite reasonable results , for example to determine the @xmath14 dependence of the basic tangle characteristics , see below .    [",

    "as one sees in the figures mentioned above , the results of our numerical simulations agree well with all these expected @xmath14 dependencies .",
    "notice that the numerical values of the corresponding dimensionless parameters ( presented above ) are not always of the order of unity but often smaller by an order of magnitude .",
    "some understanding of the reason for that can be obtained with the explicit form of the bridge relations of schwartz s obtained using the local interaction approximation as discussed next .",
    "using the equation of motion   in the local interaction approximation schwartz  @xcite analytically derived the bridge relations that connect some of the parameters mentioned above . in our dimensionless notations",
    "these are :            these bridge relations are fulfilled with reasonable accuracy in our simulations ( with the full biot - savart equation ) , especially for low temperatures . for higher temperatures the discrepancy increases , but",
    "overall the order of magnitude of these coefficients is close to those calculated by schwarz ( with @xmath219 , @xmath95 and @xmath103 obtained by lia simulations ) and agree with available experimental data .",
    "this allows us to believe that the local - induction approximation may be successfully used in analytical studies of counterflow turbulence in spite of the fact that it fails in numerical simulations .",

    "however detailed statistical information of the random vortex tangle statistics is hardly expected in foreseeable experiments . because of their importance for better understanding the basic physics of counterflow turbulence we put some efforts to clarify it numerically . in particular , we studied :    the pdf of the vortex - loop length @xmath48 and showed that its core ( that contains about @xmath240 of the total loops ) can be described by a simple exponential form   as seen in fig .",

    "we show that @xmath49 may be well described by an exponential form   without fitting parameters , just involving the rms curvature @xmath101 .",
    "this allowed us to find the ratio between the structural parameters @xmath244 .",
    "last but not least : the characteristics of the vortex tangle in the form of the autocorrelation function of the vortex orientation @xmath245 , defined by eq .  .",
    "figures  [ f:16 ] shows that @xmath245 practically vanishes at distances about @xmath7 .",
    "this means that vortex lines is reminiscent of a random walk with a correlation length of the order of the intervortex distance .",
    "this fact has many important consequences , e.g. for the energy spectra in counterflow turbulence .",
    "[ [ ssres - dynamical - and - statistical - characteristics - vs .- reconnection - criteria ] ]   [ ss : res ] dynamical and statistical characteristics vs. reconnection criteria ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    we carried out full biot - savart simulations of the evolution of the vortex tangle within the vortex filament method in a wide range of parameters .",
    "we compared the statistical and geometrical properties of the dense tangles using three different reconnection criteria ( geometrical g , geometrical - energetic ge and dynamical d ) and identified which properties are robust and which are sensitive to the choice of the criterion .",
    "we found the following :    the reconnection rate is a property directly related to the choice of the criterion .",
    "we concluded that the reconnection rate is similar for * ge * and * d * criteria albeit their different physical interpretations .",
    "on the other hand , in simulations with gc the reconnection rate is significantly higher .",
    "the detailed analysis shows that most of the reconnections according to gc lead to an increase of the total length and to the creation of a very large number of small loops and loop fragments .",
    "the small loops removal procedure is therefore an essential part of the algorithm for this criterion .",
    "one of the main parameters , @xmath12 , depends on the choice of the reconnection criterion for high temperature and strong counterflow velocities , when the tangle become dense .",
    "gc lead to sparser tangle , while dc gives the most dense tangle for the same @xmath13 and @xmath169 . as a consequence ,",
    "the coefficient @xmath62 differs beyond measurement errors .",
    "our results for @xmath62 agree well with available data .",
    "thus the sensitivity of @xmath12 to the choice of the reconnection criterion may explain the spread of the results for @xmath62 as found in literature .    in agreement with previous studies we found that the vortex tangle is oblate and isotropic in the direction perpendicular to the counterflow .",
    "we observed a slight @xmath169 dependence of @xmath246 for @xmath247 and @xmath248  k for * g * and * ge * criteria .",
    "for all temperatures the tangle was most oblate for gc and least oblate for dc .",
    "the tangle drift velocity and the mutual friction force density depend on the choice of the reconnection criterion at moderate and high temperatures , with the corresponding coefficients being largest for dc and smallest for gc .",
    "this is similar to the behavior of the vortex line density .",
    "despite some clear differences in some results obtained with different reconnection criteria , vortex filament methods may be considered robust and well suited for the description of the steady state vortex tangle in the counterflow provided the results are interpreted having in mind the found values of the spread due to particular details of implementation .",
