    "studying the role of phase in quantum mechanics has a long history ( for a review on the phase concepts , see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "its importance in today s problems is also apparent .",
    "for example , phase in atomic systems has recently been used for storing quantum information @xcite , and phase and photon number measurements have been considered as a basis in some quantum teleportation schemes @xcite . notwithstanding the various phase - dependent effects in quantum physics , phase itself has not been uniquely measured and its very definition as physical quantity has been subject to many disputes . whereas for highly excited ( quasi - classical ) states different approaches give similar results , the various concepts differ in the phase properties of quantum states close to vacuum .",
    "therefore the question has been arisen of what are the differences between these approaches and how relevant are they experimentally . in this paper",
    "we concentrate on the canonical phase and its relation to @xmath0-parametrized phase - space functions , with special emphasis on the measurability of its exponential moments by `` weighted '' averaging of measured phase space functions .",
    "the canonical phase distribution @xmath5 of a radiation field mode ( harmonic oscillator ) prepared in a quantum state described by a density operator @xmath6 is defined by @xmath7 where the fock state expansion of the ( unnormalizable ) phase states @xmath8 reads latexmath:[\\ ] ] for small @xmath43 , the dominant contribution to this integral comes from large @xmath90 .",
    "we can replace @xmath153 by the asymptotic formula ( [ omegaas ] ) and absorb the prefactors into @xmath198 , @xmath199 .",
    "\\label{kasint}\\ ] ] change of the variable according to @xmath200 yields @xmath201 the integration region of ( [ b9 ] ) can be divided in two parts , @xmath202 @xmath203 and @xmath202 @xmath204 , with @xmath205 @xmath184 @xmath206 . for small @xmath43 ,",
    "the dominant contribution stems from the latter part where the approximation @xmath207 can be used , and we find that @xmath208 the integral is finite for @xmath43 @xmath46 @xmath23 , and thus @xmath209 the logarithm singularity in the denominator is very weak in comparison to the polynomial one in the numerator .",
    "only the polynomial divergence is relevant in eq .",
    "( [ psi ] ) , because it determines whether the integral is convergent or not .",
    "thus we need not consider the logarithmic part , so that eq .",
