    "lattice gauge theory and qcd sum rules ( qcdsr ) are two areas of research which have been widely employed to deepen the understanding of systems governed by the strong interactions . in this paper",
    "we combine both methods following the pioneering work of leinweber @xcite . utilising known results in qcd sum rules",
    "we apply them to lattice gauge theory in order to check that the two are compatible .",
    "we begin by following the analysis of refs .  @xcite . in this work",
    ", the continuum model ( often used in qcdsr analyses @xcite ) is tested using lattice monte carlo data .",
    "the continuum model replaces the discrete spectrum of excited states with a continuum of states of a certain spectral density .",
    "this spectral density is calculated using a wilson ope expansion of the relevant correlators in the small and intermediate time separation regime .",
    "it has been argued that this continuum model may be a good approximation to the actual situation of a large set of discrete excited states @xcite .",
    "we extend the work of refs .",
    "@xcite by including mesonic states .",
    "we also apply our analysis to several @xmath0 values ( corresponding to different lattice spacings ) , and to two actions with different lattice artefacts ( namely the wilson action @xcite and the `` clover '' sheikholeslami - wohlert ( sw ) improved action @xcite ) .",
    "thus we are able to study the effects of lattice artefacts in the calculation .",
    "the lattice data we use in this study is from the ape collaboration . as in the analysis of @xcite",
    ", we use zero - momentum correlation functions . at first sight",
    "the analysis suggests that the qcdsr continuum model is in reasonably good agreement with the lattice data , confirming the results of @xcite .",
    "however , this agreement is ambiguous since we also find that the naive ( non - relativistic ) quark model predicts essentially the same behaviour as the continuum model .",
    "furthermore , because we have data at different lattice spacings , we are able to test the continuum scaling behaviour . we find that the parameter introduced to take account of lattice distortions in the continuum model does not scale towards its predicted value as the lattice spacing is reduced .",
    "thus we conclude from our analysis that there are reservations regarding the validity of the qcdsr continuum model ( but confirmation of the quark model ) .",
    "we also test the relativistic quark model against our data and find poorer agreement .    through this study of the qcdsr continuum model",
    ", we have defined a procedure which enables lattice correlation functions to be fitted at small ( euclidean ) time values .",
    "this can be usefully employed in the case of correlation functions that have numerical problems in the isolation of the ground state properties at large time separations . by fitting the lattice correlation function data to a term representing the ground state contribution , plus a term representing the contributions of the excited states ,",
    "we show that accurate ground state parameters can be extracted even when the fitting window is very close to the source .",
    "we explicitly show that these qcdsr - inspired fitting functions reproduce the parameters of the ground state better than the conventional , double - exponential fitting procedure .    recently , some other researchers have also used continuum model ideas to study lattice correlation functions @xcite .",
    "they study hadronic correlation function , but use configuration space ( i.e. point - to - point functions ; see also @xcite ) rather than the momentum space correlation functions analysed here .",

    "there is a discussion and conclusion",
    ". an earlier version of this work appeared in @xcite .",
    "the lattice data used in this study is from the ape collaboration and uses the quenched approximation .",
    "specifically it is data which has been used primarily in the study of weak matrix elements such as @xmath1 and @xmath2 @xcite , and , more recently , for light hadronic spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "a list of the simulation parameters is presented in table [ tab_latt_params ] . for full details of the simulations ,",
    "see the corresponding reference .",
    "all errors in the results were obtained using the jacknife method with 10 configurations eliminated per cluster .    the lattices in this study span a range of @xmath0-values which correspond to different lattice spacings , @xmath3 . in table",
    "[ tab_latt_params ] and throughout this paper , @xmath3 is set from the @xmath4 and @xmath5 masses following the approach described in @xcite .",
    "this method avoids any chiral extrapolation and uses data at the simulated values of the quark masses , i.e. at around the strange mass .",
    "it is therefore preferable than other methods , e.g. obtaining @xmath6 from the @xmath7-mass etc .",
    "note that the lattice spacings are smaller than those used in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite and so clearly lattice artefacts should be smaller .",
    "typically each simulation was performed with three different values of the hopping parameter , @xmath8 .",
    "only one of these ( for each simulation ) was chosen to be included in this study .",

    "it introduces extra states in the correlation functions which are not present when the usual full sum over @xmath27 it taken .",
    "these unwanted states have large energy corresponding to large spatial momentums and do not affect the conventional extraction of the ground state properties @xcite .",
    "this is because at the ( relatively large ) times where there is ground state dominance , the higher energy states have decayed away .",

    "concentrating on the comparison of the ground state parameters , @xmath50 and @xmath53 , from the `` cont '' fit with those from the `` 1-exp '' fit , we see good agreement for the mesonic states .",
    "this is particularly encouraging because very small time values were included in the fitting window . and",
    "@xmath53 values typically underestimate the real errors due to correlations in the data @xcite .",
    "] however , for the baryons , poorer agreement is observed .",
    "in fact the agreement between the @xmath50 and @xmath53 values from the continuum model and `` 1-exp '' fit becomes worse as @xmath0 increases ( i.e. as the continuum limit is approached ) .",
    "overall , these fits suggest that the qcd continuum model is a reliable method of extracting ground state information in the mesonic case , but that there is some question about its validity for the baryons .",
    "note that leinweber , who studied baryons only , found good agreement @xcite .",
    "a possible explanation for this is that he used data at a larger lattice spacing and with poorer statistics than those studied here .",
    "note also that the baryonic data is `` thinned '' which will obviously affect the normalisation of the higher mass states .",
    "this could conceivably also affect the ground state fitting parameters in the `` cont '' fits .",
    "the results for @xmath50 and @xmath53 for the `` 2-exp '' fits require careful interpretation . comparing the `` 2-exp '' and `` 1-exp '' fits we see that the values for both @xmath50 and @xmath53 for the `` 2-exp '' fits are larger than those in the `` 1-exp '' fit _ in every case_.",
    "this presumably means that the introduction of a `` raw '' second exponential biases the parameters of the asymptotic state .",
    "also , it can be seen that in every case except one ( the wilson @xmath86 , pseudoscalar meson ) the `` cont '' values for @xmath50 and @xmath53 reproduce the `` standard values '' ( i.e. the `` 1-exp '' values ) better than the `` 2-exp '' do .",
    "we can understand this bias in the case of the `` 2-exp '' fit as follows .",
    "the true set of states that contributes to the spectrum includes the ground state and many excited states . in the case of the `` 2-exp '' fit , all the excited states are modelled as a single state .",
    "clearly the values of @xmath91 and @xmath92 from this fit will be some average over all the excited states .",
    "this means that the @xmath91 value will be larger than the _ first _ excited state s mass .",
    "however , of the excited states , it is this first excited state that is the most significant correction to the ground state at intermediate values of @xmath68 ( i.e. at @xmath68 values large enough so that the excited states are no longer dominant , and small enough so that the ground state also has not yet dominated the correlation function ) .",
    "this means that the correlation function for the `` 2-exp '' fit will be too small in these intermediate values of @xmath68 . to adjust for this mismatch , the value of the ground state s mass , @xmath53 ( and @xmath50 since they are correlated )",
    "will be shifted slightly higher in the `` 2-exp '' fit .",
    "obviously , in order to avoid this bias , correct account must be taken of all the excited states in the spectrum .",
    "the continuum model is one way of modelling these states , and thus should overcome at least part of the above shortcomings of the `` 2-exp '' fit .",
    "the agreement of the ground state parameters , @xmath50 and @xmath53 , between the continuum model and `` 1-exp '' fit confirms this hypothesis .      turning to the @xmath84 values",
    ", the first thing to note is that the @xmath93 for the `` cont '' and `` 2-exp '' fits can be as much as 10 or 100 . at first sight",
    "this is a worrying feature , especially since the @xmath84 is calculated ignoring correlations between timeslices .",
    "( the presence of correlations canonically lowers the uncorrelated @xmath93 to below unity . )",
    "however , the correlation function data at small times has relatively tiny errors compared with large times .",
    "( typically the correlation function has statistical errors of one part in a thousand at the beginning of the fitting window , and around one part in ten at the end of the window . )",
    "therefore any small discrepancy between the fitting functions and the data at small times leads to a very large contribution in the @xmath84 .",
    "it is unreasonable to expect that the small time behaviour of the correlation functions could possibly be reproduced _ at the level of these tiny statistics _ by any model containing only four parameters , no matter how well physically motivated .",
    "it is also worth bearing in mind that the meson correlation functions fall by from 3 to as much as 7 orders of magnitude in the region fitted in the `` cont '' and `` 2-exp '' cases . in the case of the baryons the correlation functions can fall by as much as 13 orders of magnitude . fig .",
    "[ fig_logc ] shows the ( natural ) logarithm of the correlation function for the vector meson in the wilson , @xmath90 case ( which is a representative mesonic example ) .",
    "the plot shows the fits from all three methods above .",
    "this figure illustrates the points made above ; the errors in the data for small times are clearly tiny .",
    "we have argued that the absolute values of the @xmath93 values might reasonably be expected to be large for the `` cont '' and `` 2-exp '' fits .",
    "however their _ relative values _ should correspond to the relative quality of fits of the two methods . from tables",
    "[ tab_proton],[tab_p5],[tab_vi ] & [ tab_at ] we see that the @xmath84 for the `` cont '' fit are smaller than ( or , at worse , similar to ) the `` 2-exp '' fit in every case . in some cases ( particularly for the pseudoscalar meson ) the @xmath84 value for the `` cont '' case is as much as an order of magnitude smaller than the `` 2-exp '' case .",
    "this is again evidence that the `` cont '' fitting functions are an improvement over the traditional `` 2-exp '' functions .    as examples of the quality of the fits , figs .",
    "[ fig_effm1 ] , [ fig_effm2 ] and [ fig_effm3 ] show the effective mass plots for the clover , @xmath94 , pseudoscalar case , the wilson , @xmath90 , vector meson case , and the wilson , @xmath86 , nucleon case respectively .",
    "the central values of the effective mass from the three methods : `` 1-exp '' ; `` cont '' ; and `` 2-exp '' are shown .",
    "( note that the effective mass has been corrected for the effect of the backward moving state and should therefore be constant at large times approaching the middle of the lattice . ) in these figures the `` 2-exp '' fit can be seen to give a reasonable reproduction of the monte carlo data , however , the `` cont '' method performs a little better .",
    "in particular the effect discussed in sect .",
    "[ gnd_state ] at intermediate time values can be seen in the `` 2-exp '' case .",
    "these three cases are a representative sample of all the cases studied , and support the conclusions above regarding the relative merits of the `` 2-exp '' and `` cont '' approaches .",
    "further evidence that the `` cont '' method is an improvement over the `` 2-exp '' case can be seen in figs .",

    "( the `` 1-exp '' fit using @xmath97 is shown as the solid horizontal line . )",
    "as can be seen from the fits , the `` cont '' method converges much faster to the true mass value compared with the `` 2-exp '' case .",
    "other channels show a similar behaviour .",
    "clearly it is not sufficient for the `` cont '' fits to reproduce the ground state parameters @xmath50 and @xmath53 , and to have a sensible @xmath84 , they must also give values for the continuum parameters , @xmath44 and @xmath54 , which are acceptable within the assumptions of the qcdsr continuum model .    in table",
    "[ tab_s0 ] the values for @xmath44 ( in @xmath9 ) are listed for all the cases studied .",
    "these values must satisfy two criteria : ( i ) since @xmath44 corresponds to a physical threshold , they should be constant ( in @xmath9 ) for each channel as @xmath0 is varied ; and ( ii ) they should be large enough to be in a region where perturbation theory is valid .",
    "the second criterion is required so that the perturbative expression for the quark propagator , eq .",
    "( [ eq : qprop ] ) , is valid . from table",
    "[ tab_s0 ] , it is clear that the @xmath44 values are roughly constant in @xmath0 for the mesons , but not for the nucleon ( particularly the clover case ) .",
    "also , for the pseudoscalar meson , the @xmath44 values are arguably too small ( @xmath98 ) for perturbation theory to be considered reliable .",
    "thus only the vector and axial mesons convincingly pass the criteria above .",
    "we now turn to the values for @xmath54 .",
    "note that this parameter was introduced to parametrise the distortions introduced in the lattice formalism .",
    "it should therefore be unity in the continuum limit @xcite .",
    "table  [ tab_xi ] displays the various values of @xmath54 from the `` cont '' fits .",
    "clearly , in the case of the axial meson , the @xmath54 values are not `` @xmath99 '' .",
    "the large size of these @xmath54 is because the leading term in the continuum part of @xmath37 for this channel is @xmath66 ( see eqs .",

    "this implies that @xmath54 values several orders of magnitude larger than the other channels ( which have @xmath100 terms in @xmath37 ) are required .    in conclusion , the results of the continuum parameters , @xmath44 and @xmath54 , cast doubt over the applicability of the `` cont '' model , since the values obtained from the fits are not consistent with the assumptions made in the qcdsr continuum model .",
    "note , it is not possible to compare directly the values for @xmath54 for wilson , nucleon data with those in ref .",
    "this is because the baryonic channels studied here have `` thinned '' correlation functions ( see the discussion in sect .",
    "[ lat_details ] ) .",
    "this affects the short - time region only , due to the presence of extra high energy states , and thus conceivably alters the values of @xmath54 .",

    "there are naively 6 degrees of freedom , with 9 degrees of freedom for baryons . however , there are 4 constraint equations .",

    "we have then searched for a model that reproduces a similar functional form as the qcd continuum model , but which does not have the same restrictions on its parameters . both the non - relativistic and relativistic quark models were studied . by using a fitting function which interpolated between the two , it was found that the non - relativistic quark model was qualitatively better that its relativistic counterpart for the quark mass studied . in the case of the pseudoscalar meson ,",
