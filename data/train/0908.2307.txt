    "the discovery that most local spheroids contain massive black holes ( mbh ) in their centres has renewed the interest in the physical properties of active galactic nuclei . a number of correlations , such as the one between the masses of mbh and the properties of the host galaxies ( e.g. gebhardt et al .",
    "2001 , merritt & ferrarese 2001 ) and the proportionality between the mass and the velocity dispersion of the stars , suggest a direct link between the formation@xmath9growth of the black hole and the stellar mass of the galaxy spheroid .",
    "the availability of major facilities in the submm ( e.g. scuba on the james clerk maxwell telescope and mambo on iram ) led to the discovery of a large population of luminous infrared galaxies at high redshifts ( e.g. hughes et al .",
    "1998 , bertoldi et al .",
    "2000 , borys et al .",
    "followup observations in co molecular gas - line emission suggest that such galaxies are in fact massive ( e.g. greve et al .",
    "2005 , chapman et al .",
    "2008 ) . the launch of the spitzer space telescope ( sst , werner et al .",
    "2004 ) has shed new light into luminous dusty high redshift galaxies .",
    "sensitive mid - infrared observations have unveiled the presence of obscured agn whose properties would have otherwise remained unnoticed ( e.g. lacy et al . 2004 , stern et al .",
    "2005 , alonso - herrero et al .",
    "2006 hereafter ah06 , donley et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "there are two obvious ways one can investigate the coeval formation of black holes and galactic bulges .",
    "one approach is to follow up on known mm@xmath9submm sources with x - rays .",
    "somewhat surprisingly , however , only a small fraction of smgs contain a visible luminous qso ( e.g. fabian et al .",
    "1999 , almaini et al .",
    "such a result implies that the epoch of black hole formation does not coincide with the epoch of major star - forming activity .",

    "( 2005 ) found that @xmath1075% of the chapman et al .",
    "( 2005 ) scuba sources do contain an agn however , the bolometric output is dominated by intense star formation .",
    "this claim has more recently been confirmed by mid - infrared studies of submm - luminous sources by pope et al .",
    "the second approach is to select `` obscured agn '' and follow them up in the submillimetre wavelengths .",
    "such an approach has already been adopted by page et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , archibald et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and , stevens et al .",
    "( 2005 ) with encouraging results .",
    "these authors selected targets from the rosat surveys ( e.g. page et al .",
    "2001 ) , xmm - newton and chandra ( e.g. page et al . 2003 ) that span the redshift range 1@xmath11z@xmath113 , luminosity range 44.1@xmath11log l@xmath1244.4 and absorbing column densities 21@xmath11log n@xmath13@xmath1123 .",
    "the advantage of the present work is that we are using a sample of `` heavily '' x - ray absorbed ( log n@xmath14 23 @xmath15 ) and very luminous ( log l@xmath16 44 erg s@xmath1 ) agn , the so called type-2 qsos , located in the chandra deep field south ( cdf - s ) and selected from szokoly et al . ( 2004 ) .",
    "the first submm detection of such a heavily absorbed qso has been reported in mainieri et al .",
    "( 2005 ) .    in this paper",
    "we combine the submm observations of the entire sample of eight type-2 qsos with observations obtained with sst .",
    "we discuss the spectral energy distribution of the sources and compare them with local templates .",
    "we investigate a possible link between type-2 qsos and smgs , especially those known to contain a black hole .",
    "we explore the origin of the mid - infrared and submillimeter emission and finally discuss a possible evolutionary scheme for type-2 qsos . throughout the paper",
    "we assume a cosmology @xmath17 , @xmath18 and h@xmath19 = 70 km s@xmath1 mpc @xmath1 .",
    "the deep ( @xmath101 msec ) chandra survey of the chandra deep field south ( cdf - s , giacconi et al .",
    "2002 ) resulted in the discovery of a unique sample of heavily x - ray absorbed ( log n@xmath13 @xmath4 22 @xmath15 ) and very luminous ( log @xmath20 44 erg s@xmath1 ) agn , the so - called type-2 qsos .",
    "the type-2 qsos for this program have been selected from the deep ( @xmath10 1 msec ) survey of the cdf - s ( szokoly et al .",
    "2004 ) . from the 10 objects contained in the original list ,",
    "7 objects were observed with the jcmt within the allocated time . to this sample ,",
    "source xid 901 , was added .",
    "although the source does not meet the formal @xmath21 criterion dscribed above , it is a heavily absorbed object at @xmath22 . in table 1 we list properties of the sample of type-2 qsos studied here : names , coordinates , redshifts , x - ray luminosities and absorbing column densities .",
    "we note that x - ray luminosities are corrected for absorption ( values taken from tozzi et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     finally , following marconi et al .",
    "( 2004 ) we estimate bolometric luminosities based on rest - frame absorption corrected l@xmath23 .",
    "assuming that l@xmath24 = l@xmath25 , where l@xmath25 is the eddington luminosity we report ( table 3 ) lower limits on the black hole masses .",
    "a different approach to the relative importance of agn and star formation activity is provided by comparing the submillimetre ( 850 @xmath7 m ) to x - ray ( 2 kev ) spectral slope ( @xmath8 ) of our type-2 qsos to those of template nearby galaxies .",
    "we have , therefore , calculated the @xmath8 values for our sample galaxies using : + @xmath26 \\times 0.163 $ ] + where f@xmath27 is the observed flux density at 2 kev ( kev @xmath15 s@xmath1 kev@xmath1 ) , calculated from the full - band flux using the estimated photon index , and f@xmath28 is the observed flux density at 850 @xmath7 m ( mjy ) .",
    "figure 4 shows the estimated @xmath8 values as a function of redshift for our sample type-2 qsos . in the same plot",
    "we also show template seds for : an unabsorbed quasar , quasars with varying degrees of absorption ( n@xmath13 = 10@xmath29 , 10@xmath30 @xmath15 and compton - thick with 1% of the nuclear emission scattered ) , a mean starburst and an arp220-like .",
    "the templates used here are discussed in more details in almaini et al .",
    "the type-2 qsos yield values ranging between 1.41 ( for cdfs-901 ) to 1.17 ( for cdfs-45 ) .",
    "larger values of @xmath8 indicate stronger submillimetre emission relative to the x - ray emission .",
    "the @xmath8 indices are clearly incompatible with unabsorbed agn .",
    "the @xmath8 index for cdfs901 , cdfs54 , cdfs51 and cdfs112 are compatible with the mean starburst and arp220 templates .",
    "it is of interest to note that of these four sources three are best fit by the arp220 template ( see discussion in section 3 ) .",
    "the remaining sources cdfs263 , cdfs 27 and cdfs45 , have indices that are close to the spectral index of a compton - thick agn in which only 1% of the nuclear emission is seen through scattering ( the properties of cdfs263 have already been discussed in mainieri et al .",
    "2005 ) . for comparison",
    "we report in figure 4 the spectral indices calculated for the submillimetre sources studied by alexander et al .",
    "these sources show a wide range in indices similar to what we reported for our type 2 qsos . in terms of absolute @xmath8 value , the four type-2 qsos we discussed before are indistinguishable from the submillimetre sources .",
    "another approach to assess the relative importance of the two components ( agn and starburst ) is to examine the x - ray - to - far - infrared luminosity ratio . while this ratio is in principle quite similar to the @xmath8 spectral index , it is independent of the x - ray spectral slope ( which one has to assume when converting broad band to monochromatic flux densities ) . in figure 5",
    "we plot the @xmath21 vs @xmath31 ratio for the present sample of type-2 qsos ( with values taken from tables 2 and 3 ) and literature galaxies which also host obscured agn .",
    "such a comparison is instructive with the caveat that the @xmath31 estimates may originate from a variety of measurements ( e.g mid - infrared , submm , etc ) . in the same plot",
    "we show a mean  starburst  @xmath32 ratio ( adapted from the work of david , jones and forman 1992 ) and the same ratio for quasars ( from elvis et al .",
    "it is difficult to define the same `` mean '' @xmath32 ratio for agn since they show such a huge dispersion in their values .",
    "additionally , we have marked the location of arp220 , mrk231 and ngc 6240 .",
    "the submillimetre sources ( in particular those whose x - rays originate from an agn , alexander et al .",
    "2005 ) display values very similar to those of the present type-2 qsos .",
    "for further comparison we have also marked the location of the sdss optically selected type-2 qsos ( zakamska et al .",
    "these show a wide spread in their @xmath32 , spanning from values as low as those displayed by starbursts all the way to the quasar values .",
    "none of the type-2 qsos have @xmath32 values larger than those of the quasars presented in elvis et al .",
    "this finding implies that type-2 qsos are likely to experience some level of star - formation activity which could be responsible for the @xmath33 and submillimetre emission . in turn",
    ", such star - forming processes could well contribute to the total bolometric output although , at this stage we can not accurately attribute a specific fraction . within our very small sample",
    "we do , however , see a range in the strength of the starburst which may reflect the evolutionary stage of each object . in the next section",
    "we investigate in more detail a possible evolutionary scheme for these sources .",
    "it has been suggested that the early phases of qso evolution are characterised by substantial absorption ( e.g. fabian 1999 ) . in such models",
    "the main obscured growth phase of the qso coincides with the formation of the galaxy spheroid .",
    "once this phase is completed then the qso blows away the obscuring material and starts its luminous unobscured phase ( e.g. silk & rees 1998 ) .",
    "such models deviate from the traditional view of the `` unified scheme '' for local agn ( e.g. antonucci et al . 1993 ) whereby the absorbing material is present in all objects in the form of a toroidal structure .",
    "based on simulations of galaxy mergers that include black holes ( e.g. di matteo et al . 2005 ; springel et al . 2005 ) , hopkins et al .",
    "( 2005 ) determine the intrinsic lifetime of the strong accretion phase and , taking into account obscuration , infer a lifetime for the qso .",
    "they find that the optical qso phase is rather short compared to the intrinsic lifetime of the quasar .",
    "additionally , their model suggests the presence of an obscured phase ( type 2 qsos ) that occurs immediately before the dust is completely blown away .    by contrasting the x - ray@xmath9submillimetre properties of an x - ray absorbed , compton - thin qso sample with that of a matched unabsorbed sample of qsos , page et al .",
    "( 2004 ) and stevens et al .",
    "( 2005 ) provided observational evidence for the last two stages of the evolutionary scenario described above . the x - ray absorbed qsos",
    "are observed during the transition phase , where the qso is still actively forming stars ( formation of the galactic bulge ) while at the same time accretes material that assists the formation of the central black hole .",
    "once the black hole has reached a mass @xmath34 few @xmath35 10@xmath36m@xmath6 the qso enters its unobsucred luminous phase , slowly switching off the star - forming process and eventually evolving into relaxed elliptical galaxies ( e.g. kukula et al .",
    "2001 , dunlop et al .",
    "2003 ) .    with bolometric luminosities in excess of @xmath37 , obscuring column densities n@xmath1410@xmath29@xmath15",
    ", the present type-2 qso sample can be used to further investigate the qso evolutionary scheme . in section 3",
    "we compared the seds of type-2 qsos with those of local ulirg templates ir22491 and arp220 .",
    "local ulirgs are characterised by extremely high bolometric luminosities and similarly large column densities .",
    "if we convert the estimated a@xmath38 of ulirgs ( e.g. from genzel et al . 1998 ) to expected n@xmath13 that results in n@xmath13 values in excess of 10@xmath29@xmath15 . given the high obscuration , the present ( albeit limited at the moment ) detections in the submillimetre , large dust masses ( and consequently gas ) and high redshifts , the present sample of type-2 qsos could be candidates for the initial highly obscured phase of qso evolution .",
    "a pre - requisite for any qso to be `` caught '' in this phase is of course submillimetre emission . during this phase the black hole",
    "must be accreting rapidly in order to achieve a mass of @xmath1010@xmath36m@xmath6 and thus should also reach x - ray luminosities in excess of 10@xmath0 ergs@xmath1 . and",
    "likewise the local ulirgs , the properties of qsos in this initial phase of evolution are not homogeneous in terms of luminosity , submillimetre brightness , even the starburst@xmath9agn contribution .",
    "is there a link between type-2 qsos and submm - bright galaxies ? in section 4 we compared the mid - infrared properties of the two samples and found that they show certain similarities .",
    "additional evidence was provided in figures 4 and 5 through the comparison of the @xmath8 indices and the x - ray - to - far - infrared luminosity . for more than half of the type-2",
    "qsos their @xmath8 index is identical to that measured for submillimetre - bright objects from the alexander et al .",
    "( 2005 ) sample .",
    "it is thus quite possible that a fraction of the submm - luminous sources are in fact caught during this initial highly absorbed and actively star - forming phase in the qso evolution .",
    "the evidence provided by alexander et al .",
    "( 2005 ) on the existence of black holes in a fraction of the submillimetre - bright population gives further support to this claim .",
    "likewise , we have found that the l@xmath39l@xmath40 ratio of the present type-2 qsos is smaller than that found for the well studied quasars of elvis et al .",
    "( or objects that are purely agn dominated ) .",
    "we have presented some evidence for the initial stages of qso evolution by reporting measurements of submillimetre emission from a sample of highly absorbed type-2 qsos discovered through deep x - ray surveys .",
    "two out of the eight targets have firm detections ( @xmath414 ) and a further three objects are marginally detected .",
    "these submillimetre detections coupled with their overall similarities to local ulirgs suggest that these type-2 qsos may be experiencing co - eval growth of their spheroid component while at the same time maintaining an accretion rate high enough to form a black hole of m@xmath4210@xmath36m@xmath6 .",
    "once this is achieved , the qso will blow away the obscuring material revealing its luminous qso and following a passive evolution into the present - day ellipticals .",
    "future sensitive submillimetre observations are clearly needed to further strengthen this claim .",
    "deep sensitive surveys at 250 , 320 and 520 @xmath7 m with herschel and scuba -2 ( 450 and 850 @xmath7 m ) will be crucial in delineating the shape of the far - infrared@xmath9submm part of the sed of type-2 qsos and provide firm evidence of their submillimetre emission .",
