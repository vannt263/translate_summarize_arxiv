    "the intracluster media of clusters of galaxies can be probed directly by their x - ray emission and at the same time indirectly through the morphologies of the radio sources associated with cluster members .",
    "the physical nature of radio galaxies is reflected in the structure of their emission .",
    "studies of radio galaxies have led to a better understanding of both radio emission processes and galaxy environments .",
    "one class of interesting radio sources is the wide - angle - tailed ( wat ) sources .",
    "originally defined by owen & rudnick ( 1976 ) , wats are characterised by a radio structure composed of twin jets separated by a wide opening angle and are associated with the dominant member of a cluster of galaxies .",
    "they are radio sources with intermediate radio luminosities in the range @xmath1 to @xmath2ergs@xmath3(odonoghue 1990 ) , comparable to the fanaroff - riley ( 1974 ) break between the fr class i and ii .",
    "wats are ideally suited for the study of galaxy / environment interactions .",
    "they are known to favour x - ray poor environments and almost never found in regions with cooling flows ( norman _ et al .",
    "_ 1988 ; burns 1990 ; zhao _ et al .",
    "_ 1990 ) despite being associated with galaxies most likely to be found in cooling flow regions .",
    "this implies that the radio emission and cluster gas are associated in some way .",
    "the southern galaxy cluster a2717 has a central d galaxy which is associated with a wat source .",
    "a2717 has been studied extensively in the optical ( eg . colless _",
    "_ 1987 , 1989 ) .",
    "the known properties of the cluster and its central d galaxy are summarised in table  [ t:2717cltab ] and  [ t:2717galtab ] .",
    ".optical data for the cluster a2717 [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]     the cluster surface brightness was obtained by first subtracting the point x - ray sources from the x - ray photon events file and producing a sky subtracted azimuthally averaged count rate profile ( see figure 2 ) . since the pspc has a much lower background level in the hard band and the cluster emission tends to dominate the hard band , we have chosen only the data between channels 42 to 201 ( @xmath4 0.4 - 2 kev ) to produce the surface brightness profile .",
    "s [ f : sx ]    the radially averaged x - ray surface brightness profile after the deconvolution of the psf , was well fitted by a function of the form : @xmath5^{-3\\beta + 1/2 } \\label{eq : sx}\\ ] ] with @xmath6 and core radius @xmath7 or 0.047 mpc .",
    "in this section we will described the method we used to deduce the cluster total mass , gas mass and other associated physical parameters from the x - ray data and compare some of these parameters ( e.g. velocity dispersion ) with the optical data available .",
    "we will assume that the gas is in hydrostatic equilibrium and isothermal .",
    "the x - ray surface brightness given in equation  [ eq : sx ] corresponds exactly to a gas distribution of @xmath8^{-3\\beta/2 } \\label{eq : gas}\\ ] ] if the gas extends all the way to infinity . through the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium",
    ", the gas distribution is related to the cluster gravitational potential @xmath9 as follows : @xmath10 \\label{eq : rho}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 is the gas temperature , @xmath12 is the proton mass and @xmath13 is the mean molecular weight of the gas in proton mass units . thus the cluster gravitational potential corresponding to the gas distribution of equation  [ eq : gas ] is given by @xmath14 .",
    "\\label{eq : pot}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 is the central 3-d velocity dispersion and is related to @xmath16 through @xmath17 .",
    "thus from poisson s equation the total mass density is given by : @xmath18^{2 } }    \\label{eq : bind}\\ ] ] and the cluster total mass is given by : @xmath19    from the x - ray spectral data , we found the best estimate emission measure and temperature assuming raymond - smith spectra .",
    "thus we have the x - ray flux , @xmath20 , within a radius of @xmath21 ( i.e. 0.65 mpc ) over the _ rosat",
    "_ energy band of [ 0.1,2.4 ] kev , from the spectral data .",
    "the x - ray surface bightness profile given in figure 2 gives the shape of the profile , namely @xmath16 and @xmath22 .",
    "the central electron density @xmath23 can then be estimated from @xmath20 , @xmath16 and @xmath22 ( see table  [ t : x2717 ] ) .",
    "the cluster total mass and gas mass within the radius of @xmath24 ( or 1.3 mpc ) , i.e. the maximum extent where there is still detectable x - ray emission from the surface brightness profile , are given in table  [ t : x2717 ] .",
    "the radius of @xmath24 ( or 1.3 mpc ) is chosen such that no extrapolation would be necessary in calculating the masses from the x - ray data .",
    "the total x - ray luminosity calculated up to the same radius of 1.3 mpc was found to be consistent with the @xmath25 relation given by ebeling ( 1993 ) .",
    "[ f : galx ]    we compare the x - ray deduced velocity dispersion of the cluster with the measured galaxy velocity dispersion . from jean s equation for a spherical , steady state system with isotropic velocity distribution , we can deduce the 3-d velocity dispersion @xmath26 from the potential given in equation  [ eq : pot ] and the total mass density ( equation  [ eq : bind ] ) if the galaxy number distribution follows that of the total mass .",
    "thus the 3-d velocity dispersion in this case is given by @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the 3-d radius in core radius units and @xmath15 is the 3-d velocity dispersion at the centre . in producing the above analytic expression",
    ", we have assumed that the cluster extends to infinity and that the galaxies can be treated as test particles in the cluster potential with a distribution that follows the mass .",
    "figure 3 shows the galaxy number count isocontours overlaid on the x - ray image .",
    "the southern structure in the isopleth map was identified with a background group ( colless 1987 ) .",
    "note also the coincidence between the x - ray emission and the optical structures .",
    "since the cluster is fairly regular , it can be circularly averaged to produce a galaxy number density distribution .",
    "we found that the galaxy density distribution thus deduced agreed well with the shape of the projected mass distribution , thus justifying the mass - follows - light assumption .",
    "the line of sight velocity dispersion @xmath29 , can be projected from the 3-d dispersion through ( merritt 1987 ) : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the projected mass density , @xmath32 is the projected radius in core radius units .",
    "therefore , the line of sight velocity dispersion @xmath29 is given by @xmath33 \\sigma_{0}^{2}\\ ] ] ( see appendix of mellier _ et al _ 1994 , but note there is a misprint ) .",
    "however , the measured velocity dispersion in most cases is the average of @xmath29 within a certain radius .",
    "we derive the @xmath34 from the above and obtain @xmath35 we can thus estimate @xmath36 from @xmath16 and @xmath11 and deduce @xmath37mpc@xmath38 kms @xmath3 . note that @xmath39mpc@xmath40 , thus the difference is significant and the usual assumption of a constant velocity dispersion with radius could easily produce the difference between @xmath41 and @xmath42 noted in many clusters ( sarazin 1988 ) . however , in the case of a2717 , this difference is still not large enough to obtain consistency .",
    "the measured @xmath34 of a2717 from the galaxies within a radius of 2 mpc was @xmath43 km s@xmath3(colless _ et al .",
    "thus the measured galaxy velocity dispersion was slightly higher than that deduced from the x - ray data .",
    "as mentioned in colless _",
    "( 1987 ) , there is evidence of foreground and background groups that may have contaminated the measurements and thus overestimate the velocity dispersion .",
    "given the electron density and gas temperature we can calculate the central cooling time , @xmath44 , given by @xmath45 ( sarazin 1988 ) and for a2717 , it amounts to @xmath46 gyr which is smaller than the hubble time ( @xmath47 gyr ) .",
    "thus in the absence of heating , cooling occurs within the centre of the cluster with a cooling radius of @xmath48 kpc .",
    "pending further evidence of the existence of a cooling flow , this maybe one of the few cases where a wat is found in a cooling flow cluster ( c.f . burns 1990 ) .",
    "the wat identified with the central d - galaxy was observed at the molonglo observatory synthesis telescope ( most ) at 843 mhz with a resolution of @xmath49 in 1988 , at the vla at 1.4 ghz in the b / c configuration ( resolution of @xmath50 ) and at 4.9 ghz in the c / d configuration ( resolution of @xmath51 ) in 1989 .",
    "the central parts of the source was also imaged at the australia telescope at a high resolution ( @xmath52 ) with a 6 km array in 1992 . in this paper",
    ", we will concentrate on the vla images .",
    "the 1.4 ghz image was calibrated using 3c48 as the primary calibrator , but a different primary calibrator 3c286 was used for the 4.9 ghz observation .",
    "the images were processed using the standard aips package for radio synthesis data .",
    "figure 4 shows the 1.4 ghz image superimposed on the x - ray image .",
    "the two tails are reasonably symmetrically located around the centre of the cluster and are bending southwards .",
    "the 4.9 ghz image smoothed to the same resolution as the 1.4 ghz image is shown in figure 5 .",
    "the eastern tail disappears below the sensitivity limit in this image , due to the steepness of the spectral index in the tail .",
    "the spectral index steepens dramatically from the flat core ( @xmath53 ) to the lobes where @xmath54 .",
    "the linear size of the wat was estimated from the 1.4 ghz image to be @xmath55 kpc .",
    "the total radio luminosity of the wat at 1.4 ghz is estimated to be @xmath56 w hz@xmath3 , which is just below the fr break .",
    "such moderate radio powers are typical of radio sources associated with cluster dominant galaxies ( heckman 1980 ) and of medium sized wats ( burns 1986 ) .",
    "a comparison of the redshifts of the d - galaxy and the cluster shows that the d - galaxy is moving away from us at a speed of @xmath57 km s@xmath3 . in general the galaxies with which the wats are associated move through the intracluster medium ( icm ) very slowly , if at all , rarely obtaining velocities greater than about a half their stellar dispersion ( which corresponds to @xmath58 200kms@xmath3 ) with respect to the cluster centre ( burns 1982,eilek 1984,bothun 1990 ) .",
    "wats were thought to be bent by the icm through their slow motion in the medium .",
    "however , recent detailed studies by odonoghue _ et al . _",
    "( 1993 ) have shown that this standard model breaks down when examined in detail using the current theories of the physics of the jets .",
    "alternative models suggest that tails may be bent by the bulk flow of velocities @xmath59 km@xmath3s in the icm due to subcluster mergings ( burns _ et al .",
    "_ 1986 ; odonoghue _ et al .",
    "_ 1993 ; roettiger _",
    "_ 1993 ) .",
    "[ f : rad21 ]    [ f : rad6 ]",
    "the thermal pressure due to the intracluster medium can be calculated from the pspc x - ray data by assuming that the gas is isothermal and that the ion and electron temperatures are the same .",
    "thus the thermal pressure is approximated by @xmath60 , where @xmath11 and @xmath61 are estimated from the x - ray surface brightness profile and the x - ray spectra in section  [ s : xray ] .",
    "figure 6 shows the thermal pressure as a function of radius .",
    "the radio data enable the minimum internal pressure of the tails to be calculated ( burbidge 1958 ) .",
    "the tails would be at a minimum pressure when the equipartition condition is satisfied , namely the energy density of the relativistic particles is equal to that of the magnetic field ( pacholczyk 1970 ) . indeed given the thermal pressure of the surronding medium , we can verify if the tails are in equipartition .",
    "we have adopted the method given by killeen _",
    "( 1988 ) for calculating the minimum pressure .",
    "the following assumption were made : 1 ) the jets are perpendicular to the line of sight and the magnetic field lines are perpendicular to the line of sight ; 2 ) the energy ratio @xmath62 between relativistic electrons and relativistic protons plus thermal particles is 1 ; 3 ) the source spectra is a power law extending from 10 mhz to 100 ghz with a spectral index of @xmath63 ; 4 ) the filling factor is 1 . amongst the above assumptions , the two most uncertain factors are @xmath62 and the filling factor .",
    "the parameter @xmath62 can range from 1 to 2000 ( pacholczyk 1970 ) and a factor of 100 in k produces roughly an order of magnitude difference in @xmath64 . the filling factor can easily be @xmath65 . however , an increase in @xmath62 increases @xmath64 and a decrease in the filling factor increases @xmath64 .",
    "thus by choosing @xmath66 and filling factor @xmath67 , we have really calculated the minimum @xmath64 .",
    "[ f : press ] s    in order to calculate the internal pressure exerted by the particles in the radio source , the 1.4 ghz image was smoothed with a circular beam of @xmath68 and gaussians were fit to slices perpendicular to the jet to estimate the peak flux density and size of each slice .",
    "the minimum radiation pressure was calculated for each slice using a program kindly supplied by geoff bicknell ( see figure 6 ) . an average spectral index of @xmath69 was used for each slice of the tails . given the uncertainties involved , figure 6 shows that the minimum pressure deduced from the radio data is in good agreement with the x - ray pressure , i.e. within a factor of 2 - 3 .",
    "this suggests that the tails are likely to be in equipartition , if we assume that the tails are in pressure equilibrium with the x - ray gas .",
    "note that the minimum pressure plotted are truly the lower limits , due to the choice of @xmath62 and filling factor .",
    "( 1992 ) showed in a study of @xmath70 tailed radio sources , including wats and nats , that the thermal pressure is always either comparable to or higher than the minimum @xmath64 .",
    "a study of 22 low radio luminosity sources by morganti _",
    "( 1988 ) had found a similar result , suggesting that low luminosity radio sources can be confined by thermal pressure alone .",
    "we have presented the x - ray , radio data of the cluster a2717 and analysed the data along with the optical data available in the literature .",
    "the cluster has a total x - ray luminosity of @xmath71 ergs@xmath3within a radius of 1.3 mpc and a well determined temperature of @xmath0 k. the x - ray determined total mass was @xmath72 m@xmath73 within 1.3 mpc , comparable to the virial mass given all the uncertainties .",
    "the gas mass was found to be @xmath74% of the total mass .",
    "the thermal pressure from the icm was found to be comparable to the minimum pressure in the tails of the radio galaxy associated with the central d galaxy , suggesting that the wat is most likely to be in equipartition with the surrounding media .",
    "the x - ray image of the cluster gas at the pspc resolution was almost structureless and no obvious interaction between the wat and the icm was seen . to obtain detailed morphological information that would show the possible interaction between the radio galaxy and the x - ray medium , as seen in the case of ngc 1275 ( bhringer _ et al .",
    "_ 1993 ) , we need a higher resolution x - ray image",
