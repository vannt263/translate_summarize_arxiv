    "motivated by the progress of experimental researches on unstable nuclei , the interest on proton and neutron ( @xmath11 ) pair correlations has been revived in these years , and @xmath11 pairing in proton - rich nuclei near the @xmath12 line has been intensively investigated .",
    "the importance of the @xmath11 pairing has been discussed for a long time ( see refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) . in the recent studies of the @xmath11 pairing",
    ", the competition between isosalar @xmath4 pairing and isovector @xmath8 pairing has been attracting a great interest .",
    "moreover , the possibility of the @xmath4 and @xmath8 mixed pairing has been studied with the recently developed mean - field approaches including the isospin mixing@xcite .",
    "the @xmath11 pairing has been also discussed in relation with the wigner energy in even - even nuclei , and more explicitly , its role in four - nucleon @xmath13-like correlations has been investigated in recent works @xcite .",
    "the competition between @xmath4 pairing and @xmath8 pairing is one of the essential problems in @xmath14 nuclei .",
    "as well known , the nuclear interaction in free space is more attractive in the @xmath4 spin - triplet even ( @xmath15e ) channel than in the @xmath8 spin - singlet even ( @xmath16e ) channel , as known in the fact that the @xmath4 @xmath11 system forms a bound state , deuteron .",
    "since the @xmath4 interaction is considered to be stronger than the @xmath8 interaction also in nuclear medium and at the nuclear surface , it is expected naively that the deuteron - like @xmath4 pair is more favored than the @xmath8 pair . nevertheless , as seen in the ground state spins of the odd - odd nuclei ,",
    "the @xmath8 pairing is often favored than the @xmath4 pairing except for light nuclei @xcite .",
    "many theoretical calculations have been achieved to investigate the competition between the @xmath4 and @xmath8 pairing and suggested that the @xmath8 pairing rather than the @xmath4 pairing occurs in the ground states of many @xmath12 medium - mass nuclei @xcite .",
    "the origin of the suppression of the @xmath4 pairing has been discussed from the standpoint of the coupling of single - particle angular momenta , and the important role of the spin - orbit force in the @xmath4 and @xmath8 pair competition has been pointed out @xcite .",
    "namely , the spin - orbit potential tends to suppress more the @xmath4 @xmath17 pairing than the @xmath8 @xmath18 pairing because the @xmath19-wave component of the relative motion between two nucleons in the @xmath20 configuration is much smaller for the @xmath4 @xmath17 pair than for the @xmath8 @xmath18 pair .    on the other hand ,",
    "it has been theoretically suggested that , in rotational states , the @xmath4 pairing is more favored than the @xmath8 pairing in the high spin region @xcite .",
    "recently , a spin - aligned @xmath11 pair in medium - mass @xmath21 nuclei has been reported in the experimental work @xcite which has stimulated the subsequent theoretical studies @xcite .",
    "the trend of the @xmath11 pairing condensation can be understood by the feature of one @xmath11 pair .",
    "that is , a @xmath4 @xmath11 pair is suppressed in low spin states while it can persist in a rotating system . in the recent work by tanimura _",
    "@xcite , the @xmath11 correlation in a single pair around a core has been systematically studied within the three - body potential model calculation , and it has been shown that the spin - orbit potential plays an important role in the suppression of the @xmath11 pair in the @xmath4 @xmath5 state .",
    "it means that the properties of a @xmath11 pair around a core reflects the basic feature of the @xmath11 correlation , and the study of one @xmath11 pair can be helpful to understand the @xmath11 pairing phenomena in nuclei .",
    "our aim is to investigate features of a @xmath11 pair around a core nucleus and clarify the mechanism how the spin - orbit field affects the @xmath11 pair . in the present work ,",
    "we discuss the effect of the spin - orbit force from the standpoint of the two - nucleon cluster ( dinucleon ) picture .",
    "let us consider a proton and a neutron in the potential given by the core nucleus .",
    "it is expected that the proton and the neutron form a deuteron - like @xmath4 pair at the nuclear surface because of the nucleon - nucleon attraction in the @xmath15e channel . if there is no spin - orbit potential , the @xmath4 pair should be the pure spin - triplet @xmath22 state . similarly to the @xmath23 pair , because of the @xmath16e attraction a proton and a neutron in the @xmath8 state may form a @xmath24 pair , which is the analog state of the @xmath25 pair in a system of two neutrons around a core .",
    "the @xmath4 and @xmath8 @xmath11 pairs are not necessarily same as the two - nucleon ( quasi)bound states in free space , but the pairs are regarded as virtual bound states of spatially correlating two nucleons confined in the central potential from the core .",
    "we regard such a pair as a dinucleon cluster .    in the central potential without the spin - orbit potential , the hamiltonian for two nucleons is invariant with respect to the internal parity transformation of the pair , which is equivalent to the exchange of the coordinates of the first and the second nucleons @xmath26 in the pair .",
    "the lowest @xmath4 and @xmath8 states of two nucleons are the @xmath23 and @xmath24 states which are pure even - parity states without the odd - parity mixing because of the symmetry of the hamiltonian .",
    "then , considering the spin - orbit potential as a perturbative field , we discuss how the @xmath4 and @xmath8 @xmath11 pairs are affected by the external perturbative field .",
    "this picture is different from the usual mean - field picture in the @xmath27 coupling scheme , in which single - particle orbits in the central and spin - orbit potentials are considered and pair correlations are caused by the residual @xmath11 interaction ( see appendix [ sec : app1 ] ) .",
    "the present work is based on the following idea in the dinucleon picture .",
    "suppose that two nucleons in the @xmath23 pair are localized around a position on the @xmath28 axis and they have parallel intrinsic spins oriented to the @xmath29 axis ( see lower panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : pn - pair ] ) . when the perturbative field of the spin - orbit potential is imposed , two nucleons in the pair are boosted to have finite momenta along the @xmath30 axis , i.e. , the finite orbital angular momenta around the core so as to gain the spin - orbit potential energy .",
    "the boosting of two nucleons in the same direction does not cause the internal structure change of the pair but it changes only the center of mass ( c.m . ) motion of the pair . in the total system , the c.m .",
    "motion of the pair along the @xmath30 axis corresponds to the rotational mode of the pair around the core .",
    "it means that high spin states gain the spin - orbit potential energy without the internal energy loss of the pair . on the other hand",
    ", the low spin state with zero orbital angular momentum @xmath31 can not gain the spin - orbit potential .",
    "thus the dinucleon picture provides a simple interpretation for the feature that the @xmath4 @xmath11 pair can persist in a rotating system but it may be relatively unfavored by the spin - orbit force in the low spin state .    moreover , based on the dinucleon picture , we find further interesting phenomenon concerning the symmetry breaking of the @xmath8 @xmath11 pair , that is , the parity mixing in the @xmath8 pair .",
    "suppose that two nucleons in the @xmath24 pair are localized around a position on the @xmath28 axis and they have antiparallel intrinsic spins oriented to the @xmath29 axis ( see upper panels of fig .  [",
    "fig : pn - pair ] ) .",
    "when the spin - orbit potential is imposed , the internal parity symmetry is explicitly broken by the perturbative field , because the spin - orbit potential is not invariant with respect to the transformation @xmath26 for the spin - up and -down nucleons in the pair .",
    "actually , in the potential with the spin - orbit field , spin - up and -down nucleons in the pair are boosted along the @xmath30 axis in the opposite direction so as to gain the spin - orbit potential energy . as a result of the boosting in the opposite direction , the internal structure of the pair changes and the odd - parity component mixes into the dominant even - parity component in the internal pair wave function .",
    "namely , the parity mixing of @xmath24 and @xmath32 occurs in the @xmath8 pair .",
    "since the odd - parity mixing causes the internal energy loss of the pair , the odd - parity component is determined by the competition between the spin - orbit potential energy gain and the internal energy loss .",
    "strictly speaking , the @xmath11 pair of antiparallel spin nucleons contains the @xmath4 component as well as the @xmath8 component , and in principle , the parity mixing of @xmath23 and @xmath33 may also occur in the @xmath4 pair because of the spin - orbit potential energy gain .",
    "however , as shown in this paper , the spin - orbit potential energy gain with the parity mixing is suppressed in the @xmath4 channel because the @xmath4 pair tends to lose much internal energy than the @xmath8 pair even in the case of the same @xmath15e and @xmath16e attractions .    similar phenomenon of parity mixing of pairs has been discussed recently in the condensed matter physics @xcite .",
    "the parity mixing of cooper pairs has been suggested to occur because of the spin - orbit interaction in noncentrosymmetric superconductors having the breaking of inversion symmetry in the crystal structure .",
    "the mechanism of the parity mixing is analogous to that of the two - nucleon pair caused by the spin - orbit field at the nuclear surface .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the structure of @xmath0f with the microscopic wave function based on a three - body @xmath34 model and discuss the behavior of the @xmath11 pair around @xmath1o . in the present model ,",
    "two nucleons are treated as gaussian wave packets around @xmath35 which is assumed to be the inert core written by the harmonic oscillator ( h.o . ) @xmath2-shell closed configuration .",
    "the antisymmetrization between 18 nucleons and the recoil effect of the core are exactly taken into account , and the energy spectra of @xmath0f are calculated using phenomenological effective nuclear forces . in that sense ,",
    "the @xmath0f wave function used in the present work is fully microscopic one .",
    "one of the advantages of the present model is that the expression of the gaussian wave packets for valence nucleon wave functions provides the direct link with the @xmath36 @xmath11 cluster formation and its breaking at the nuclear surface .",
    "moreover , the internal wave function and the c.m .",
    "motion of the pair are separable .",
    "it is also helpful to consider a classical picture for the position and momentum of valence nucleons in the pair .",
    "based on the dinucleon picture , we analyze the effect of the spin - orbit potential on the @xmath11 pair around the @xmath1o core and discuss the parity mixing of the @xmath11 pair considering the spin - orbit potential from the core as the perturbative external field .",
    "we also discuss the effect of the spin - orbit potential on the four - nucleon correlations , i.e. , the breaking of the @xmath13 cluster around @xmath1o in association with that on the @xmath11 pair .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we describe the present model of the microscopic three - body @xmath1o+@xmath2+@xmath3 model . in [ sec : results ] , the calculated results for @xmath0f obtained by the gcm calculations of the @xmath1o+@xmath2+@xmath3 model are shown .",
    "we discuss the behavior of the @xmath11 pair focusing on the effect of the spin - orbit potential in [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "we also study the four - nucleon correlation at the surface of the @xmath1o core based on the @xmath1o+@xmath37 model in [ sec:4-nucleon ] .",
    "a summary is given in [ sec : summary ] .",
    "in the appendix , the mechanism of the breaking of the parity symmetry in the pair in the spin - orbit potential is described in appendix [ sec : app1 ] , and the mathematical relation between the @xmath11 cluster wave function and the shell - model wave function is described in appendix [ sec : app2 ] .",

    "[ fig : pn - pair],width=245 ]",
    "to investigate the structure of @xmath0f system focusing on the internal structure of the @xmath11 pair at the surface around the @xmath1o core , we adopt a three - body cluster model of @xmath1o+@xmath2+@xmath3 with the form of gaussian wave packets for two valence nucleons , @xmath40 here @xmath41 is the @xmath1o wave function given by the h.o . @xmath2-shell",

    ", @xmath41 is approximately written by the @xmath45 brink - bloch wave function with the @xmath13-@xmath13 distance small enough to express the shell - model limit .",
    "@xmath46 is the spin - isospin function labeled by @xmath47 proton or neutron and @xmath48 or @xmath49 , and @xmath50 is the antisymmetrizer for all nucleons .",
    "the total wave function is the microscopic 18-body wave function .",
    "the spatial parts of single - particle wave functions for valence nucleons are specified by the complex parameters @xmath51 @xmath52 which stand for the centers of gaussian wave packets in the phase space .",
    "one of the merits of the present model with the wave packet form is that the internal wave function and the c.m .",
    "motion of the pair are separable , @xmath53 and therefore , the internal structure of the pair can be easily analyzed if we omit the antisymmetrization effect from the core .",
    "moreover , the recoil effect on the core is exactly taken into account when we set the mean position of the c.m . of @xmath1o to @xmath54 .",
    "note that the valence nucleon wave function given by the localized gaussian form can be expanded by the h.o .",
    "shell - model basis around the origin and , in the @xmath55 limit , the single - nucleon wave function after the antisymmetrization becomes equivalent to a h.o .",

    "coordinates @xmath57 and @xmath58 to the jaccobi coordinates @xmath59 and @xmath60 , we can switch over from the single - particle orbit picture to the @xmath11 cluster picture .",
    "another merit of the wave packet form is that the mean position and momentum of a nucleon are described simply by the real part @xmath61 and the imaginary part @xmath62 of the gaussian center parameter @xmath63 ( @xmath61 and @xmath64 are real vectors ) , @xmath65 and also those for the c.m . of the @xmath11 pair @xmath66    in case of @xmath67 , which corresponds to @xmath68 ,",
    "the wave function describes the simplest case that two nucleons form the ideal @xmath11 cluster having the @xmath36 configuration .",
    "the superposition of the @xmath36 @xmath11 cluster wave functions with various @xmath69 parameters is equivalent to the the generator coordinate method ( gcm ) of the two - body @xmath1o+@xmath70 cluster model , in which @xmath69 is treated as the generator coordinate describing the relative motion between the @xmath11 cluster and @xmath35 . because of the fermi statistics , the @xmath36 @xmath11 cluster with the isospin @xmath4 is the pure spin - triplet ( @xmath22 ) state , while that with @xmath8 is the spin - singlet ( @xmath71 ) state . in the two - body @xmath1o+@xmath70 cluster model ,",
    "the @xmath4 and @xmath8 states of @xmath0f are composed of the @xmath23 and @xmath72 @xmath11 clusters , respectively .    in reality",
    ", the ideal @xmath36 @xmath11 cluster is broken at the nuclear surface because of the effect from the core .",
    "therefore we extend the two - body @xmath1o+@xmath70 cluster model to the three - body @xmath1o+@xmath2+@xmath3 model by taking into account @xmath73 cases and treat the parameter @xmath74 as an additional generator coordinate to incorporate more general states of the @xmath11 pair having internal excitations . in the present calculation",

    "it means that the odd - parity term of the @xmath8 component contains the @xmath92 and @xmath325 components in equal weight , while the even - parity term @xmath326 contains only the @xmath92 component . as a result",
    ", the odd - parity component is suppressed in the @xmath92 projected state , and the ratio of the odd - parity to the even - parity components in the @xmath8 pair is reduced to be half of the intrinsic state . on the other hand , for the @xmath4 pair , there is no reduction of the odd - parity component in the @xmath313 projection , and the ratio in the @xmath4 pair is the same as that in the intrinsic state , in other words , the even - parity component is relatively enhanced in the @xmath92 projection for the @xmath8 state , while such the enhancement of the even - parity component does not occur in the @xmath313 projection for the @xmath4 state .",
