    "it is well known that red early - type galaxies exhibit a tight sequence on colour - magnitude diagrams , which is called the colour - magnitude relation ( cmr ) ( e.g. , visvanathan & sandage 1977 ; @xcite ) . in nearby clusters ,",
    "the cmrs extend down to at least @xmath5 magnitude fainter than the brightest cluster galaxies ( e.g. , terlevich , caldwell & bower 2001 ) . the small colour scatter around the cmr is indicative of the homogeneity of early - type galaxies in clusters ( e.g. , bower et al .  1992 , 1998 ) . at high redshifts ,",
    "the cmr has already been well established in clusters at least out to @xmath6 as far as the bright end is concerned ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; 2001 ; blakeslee et al .",
    "2003 ; stanford et al .  2006 ; mei et al .",
    "2006a , b ) .",
    "the faint end of the cmr , however , has been much less explored and still highly uncertain .",
    "some recent deep studies of distant galaxy clusters have shown a relatively small number of galaxies at the faint end of the cmr compared to local clusters . de lucia et al .",
    "( 2004 , 2007 ) showed such a deficit of faint red galaxies in @xmath7 clusters observed by the eso distant cluster survey ( ediscs ; @xcite ) .",
    "a similar result was shown in stott et al .",
    "they compared the faint end of the luminosity functions of red galaxies in @xmath8 clusters from massive cluster survey ( macs ; ebeling et al .",
    "2001 ) with those of @xmath9 clusters from las campanas / aat rich cluster survey ( larcs ; pimbblet et al .",
    "@xcite analysed the rxj0152.71357 cluster ( hereafter rxj0152 ) at @xmath10 based on wide field data taken with the subaru prime focus camera on the subaru telescope ( suprime - cam ; miyazaki et al .",
    "2002 ) , and they also showed a deficit of faint red galaxies on the cmr . based on these results , de lucia et al .",
    "( 2004 , 2007 ) and @xcite discussed that the faint end of the cmr well visible in the present - day universe was established at relatively later epochs as faint blue galaxies stopped their star formation after @xmath11 in contrast to much earlier ( @xmath12 ) termination of star formation in massive galaxies .",
    "@xcite classified galaxy environment into `` cluster '' , `` group '' and `` field '' , and examined the environmental dependence of the faint end of the cmr as well .",
    "they suggest that the build - up of the cmr depends also on environment in the sense that it is more delayed in lower - density environment .",
    "the deficit of the faint end of the cmr is often discussed in the line of a currently favoured observational phenomenon called `` down - sizing '' .",
    "this trend was first noted for field galaxies by cowie et al .",
    "they showed in their hawaii deep field that most massive galaxies tend to show low star formation rates while less massive galaxies still show on - going star formation activity at @xmath13 .",
    "such a trend has been extended in both redshift space and magnitude range .",
    "kauffmann et al .",
    "( 2003 ) showed in the local sdss data that massive galaxies are dominated by red old galaxies .",
    "by contrast , less massive galaxies show bluer colours due to some on - going star formation , and galaxies below a few times @xmath14 in stellar mass are predominantly blue .",
    "a very similar trend was reported at @xmath6 by kodama et al .",
    "they looked in the subaru / xmm deep field and showed the distribution of galaxies at @xmath6 on the colour - magnitude diagram .",
    "a clear bi - modality on the colour - magnitude diagram was observed again . since then , a large number of papers have discussed this interesting issue .",
    "one of the most convincing cases is based on @xmath158,000 galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts within @xmath16 in the deep2 survey ( bundy et al .",
    "they derived stellar mass functions of red and blue galaxies and showed that the mass where the dominant contribution is switched from red to blue galaxies shifts to smaller masses as time goes on .",
    "this down - sizing trend is found also in clusters as already mentioned above .",
    "recently , however , andreon ( 2006 ) claimed that the faint end of the cmr is fully in place in the rich cluster ms10540321 ( hereafter ms1054 ) at @xmath10 and questioned the universality of the deficiency of faint red galaxies at @xmath0 .",
    "a critical problem is that the number of galaxy clusters having deep enough imaging data so that we can discuss the faint end of the cmr is still very limited at high redshifts .",
    "in fact , so far only a few clusters at @xmath0 ( of which some are optically - selected clusters ) have been studied in this respect ( i.e. , ms1054 by @xcite , rxj0152 by @xcite , and some optically - selected clusters by ediscs in @xcite , 2007 ) .",
    "therefore , it is crucial to increase the number of clusters and see if the deficit of faint red galaxies is universally observed or not and see what determines the degree of the deficit . in this paper , we examine another cluster at @xmath3 , rxj1716.4 + 6708 ( hereafter rxj1716 ) , in order to obtain a more general picture of @xmath11 clusters .",
    "we will also discuss a possible origin of the cluster - to - cluster variations .",
    "the structure of this paper is the following . in section 2 , we introduce our pisces project , and also summarize the properties of the rxj1716 cluster shown by some previous works .",
    "we present a deficit of faint red galaxies in section 3 , and we discuss the environmental dependence of the nature of faint galaxies in section 4 .",
    "finally , we summarize our results in section 5 . throughout this paper",
    "we use @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 km s@xmath20mpc@xmath20 .",
    "magnitudes are all given in the ab system , unless otherwise stated .",
    "our new data for the rxj1716 cluster which we use in this paper were obtained as part of the pisces programme ( panoramic imaging and spectroscopy of cluster evolution with subaru ) and the details of this project are given in kodama et al .",
    "( 2005 ) . here",
    "we repeat only the basic concepts of the project .",
    "the subaru telescope has both great light - collection power and superb image quality . at the same time , the subaru prime focus camera ( suprime - cam ; miyazaki et al .",
    "2002 ) has a very wide field of view of @xmath21 .",
    "this unique combination has enabled us to conduct a deep and wide study of distant galaxy clusters out to @xmath22 .",
    "in particular , we are able to view from cluster cores to the surrounding general field all at once .",
    "our aim is to probe when and where cluster galaxies form , and how galaxies evolve afterwards depending on environment and galaxy mass .",
    "we study more than 10 x - ray detected distant clusters at various redshifts ( @xmath23 ) , hence at various stages , of galaxy evolution ( kodama et al .",
    "we first map out large scale structure on a comoving scale of 1015  mpc based on photometric redshifts , and then by studying the properties of galaxies as functions of environment and time in detail , we try to make a link between the evolution of galaxies and the growth of large scale structures through environmental effects .",
    "some clusters have already been observed and analysed and the results have been published in several papers ( e.g. , kodama et al .",
    "2001 , 2004 , 2005 ; tanaka et al .",
    "2005 , 2006 , 2007ab ; nakata et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "we obtained an imaging data set of rxj1716 on 2005 may 5 and 6 .",
    "properties of this cluster are summarized in section 2.3 .",
    "the observing conditions were very good , and the seeing size was stable at @xmath24 during the nights .",
    "we observed this cluster in the @xmath25 filters .",
    "exposure times and limiting magnitudes are shown in table  1 .",
    ".exposure times and limiting magnitudes ( ab ) of the suprime - cam data . limiting magnitudes correspond to 5@xmath26 detection limits and measured in a 2@xmath27 aperture . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     as summarized above , the definitions of cluster member galaxies and the colours used to define the cmr are not the same among different studies of the @xmath0 clusters .",
    "however , as shown in @xcite , the results would not be significantly affected whether we do or do not apply photometric redshifts for member selection . at the same time , the difference in the colours used to define the red sequence does not cause a problem when selecting red galaxies at @xmath0 because all colours used to define the red sequence in the papers have sensitivity to 4000  break feature at @xmath0 .",
    "the studied surface area of the clusters differ from author to author . to quantify this effect , we changed the radius of cluster regions for rxj1716 between @xmath28 , but we do not see any significant difference in the luminosity function within the error . therefore , the surface area of cluster region would not affect our conclusions strongly , as long as the dense region of each cluster is properly covered .",
    "below , we compare luminosity functions and luminous - to - faint ratios of the @xmath11 clusters .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : lf_hikaku ] , we compare the luminosity functions of the red - sequence galaxies of the above clusters available in the literature .",
    "note that the depths of the data for rxj1716 , rxj0152 and ms1054 are about the same and @xmath29 mag deeper than that of the ediscs clusters .",
    "we can see a decline of the luminosity function at @xmath30 in rxj1716 , rxj0152 , and the ediscs clusters in @xcite , while no such decline is seen in ms1054 .",
    "the `` deficit '' means that the faint end of the cmr has not been fully established , while `` no deficit '' means the faint end of the cmr has been already well populated by @xmath0 . as claimed by @xcite",
    ", the deficit of the faint red galaxies may not be an universal phenomenon .",
    "we calculate the luminous - to - faint ratios of the red - sequence galaxies for rxj0152 and ms1054 using the same definition of `` luminous '' and `` faint '' galaxies as defined in section  3.3 .",
    "the dividing magnitude of `` luminous '' and `` faint '' is @xmath31 and it corresponds to @xmath32 .",
    "we obtain lum / faint= @xmath33 for rxj0152 and @xmath34 for ms1054 .",
    "the numbers of luminous and faint galaxies of rxj0152 are taken from @xcite , and those of ms1054 are read off from the number counts plotted in fig .  4 of @xcite .",
    "note that the luminous - to - faint ratio for ediscs clusters in @xcite is not shown here because their data are not deep enough for us to calculate the luminous - to - faint ratio in the same definition ( our data is @xmath151 mag deeper than those in @xcite ) . in terms of luminous - to - faint ratio , rxj0152 has a similar value to that of rxj1716 ( @xmath35 ) within errors , while ms1054 has a significantly smaller value .",
    "we also obtain lum / faint @xmath36 for the coma cluster in the same definition , using the luminosity function of red - sequence galaxies of the coma cluster shown in fig .",
    "7 of @xcite .",
    "therefore , the local rich cluster coma has even smaller luminous - to - faint ratio than those of any @xmath0 clusters discussed in this paper including the richest cluster ms1054 ( see below and table  2 ) .",
    "in fact , coma has a `` rising '' faint end in the luminosity function of red galaxies , compared to the flat or declining faint ends seen in ms1054 and the other @xmath0 clusters ( fig .",
    "this may indicate evolution in the faint end of luminosity functions of red galaxies between @xmath0 and the present day .",
    "however , we do not go further on this issue in this paper , because comparing clusters at different redshifts is not trivial , given the expected evolution in the richness of clusters themselves by accretion of surrounding systems .    here",
    ", we focus on the difference in the faint end of ms1054 from the other clusters at @xmath0 . what causes this difference ?",
    "ms1054 is a very rich , massive cluster , and this may have some impact on the build - up of the cmr .",
    "cluster richness and mass are well correlated with the x - ray properties such as luminosity @xmath37 and temperature @xmath38 . @xcite",
    "presented the x - ray properties of rxj1716 , rxj0152 and ms1054 clusters based on chandra data .",
    "we summarize them in table  2 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : lum / faint ] , the luminous - to - faint ratios are plotted against the x - ray luminosities .",
    "although only three clusters are currently available , it is interesting to note that the richest system with the highest @xmath37 , ms1054 , has the lowest luminous - to - faint ratio .",
    "a similar trend was seen in a super - rich cluster at a slightly lower redshift , the cl0016 cluster at @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "in fact , this cluster is one of the richest systems ever known at intermediate redshifts and it has @xmath40  erg s@xmath20 and @xmath41  kev ( @xcite ) .",
    "interestingly , this cluster shows no deficit of the faint red galaxies in the cluster core , which is the same trend as the rich cluster ms1054 .",
    "the fact that we see no deficit in cl0016 may not be simply due to its lower redshift or later evolutionary stage , but it is also possible that rich systems tend to have many faint red galaxies .",
    "we therefore suggest that the build - up of the cmr is dependent not only on redshift but also on cluster richness , in the sense that richer systems have had earlier galaxy evolution even for faint galaxies and the faint end of the cmr has already been well developed .",
    "this is similar to what tanaka et al .",
    "( 2005 ) found in their analysis by separating galaxies into three environmental bins ( cluster / group / field ) . in the current analysis , we now suggest that even within the cluster environment , the evolutionary stage of faint galaxies still depends on the richness of clusters .",
    "@xcite recently investigated the environmental dependence of the luminous - to - faint ratios of the red sequence galaxies by dividing the clusters into two classes according to their velocity dispersions at @xmath42 km s@xmath20 .",
    "however , the luminous - to - faint ratios of the two classes do not show a significant difference .",
    "it should be pointed out , however , that the rxj1716 , rxj0152 and ms1054 clusters studied in this paper have much larger velocity dispersions compared to the ediscs clusters .",
    "the velocity dispersion is @xmath43 km s@xmath20 for rxj1716 ( see section 2.3 ) , @xmath44 km s@xmath20 for ms1054 ( tran et al . 1999 ) , @xmath45 km s@xmath20 for rxj0152(n ) and @xmath46 km s@xmath20 for rxj0152(s ) ( demarco et al . 2005 ) .",
    "the velocity dispersion of rxj0152 estimated from all the cluster galaxies is @xmath47 km s@xmath20 ( demarco et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "difference in the faint end of the red sequence may be seen only at the richest end of clusters , and the cmr may be fully established toward the faint end only in the super rich environment at @xmath0 . in order to confirm the relationship between the `` deficit '' of faint red galaxies and cluster richness , we definitely need a larger sample of clusters at high redshifts .",
    "using a deep , multi - colour , panoramic imaging data set of the distant cluster rxj1716.4 + 6708 at @xmath3 , newly taken with the prime focus camera ( suprime - cam ) on the subaru telescope , we have carried out an analysis of red - sequence galaxies with a care for incompleteness .",
    "we have found that there is a sharp decline in the number of the red galaxies toward the faint end of the cmr below @xmath4 .",
    "we compared our results with those for other clusters at @xmath0 taken from the literature , by calculating the luminous - to - faint ratio to quantify the degree of the `` deficit '' and by combining the information on richness of the individual clusters from x - ray properties .",
    "we suggest that the deficit of faint red galaxies is dependent on the richness or mass of the clusters in the sense that poorer systems show stronger deficits .",
    "this indicates that the evolutionary stage of less massive galaxies depends critically on environment . in order to confirm this interesting trend",
    ", we need a much larger sample of galaxy clusters over a wide range in richness , and not only at similar redshifts but also at other redshifts .",
