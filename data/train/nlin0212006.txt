    "the morphology of the nodal sets of wave functions depends crucially on whether the underlying classical dynamics is integrable or chaotic .",
    "this was first proposed in @xcite and was followed by the study of various features of the nodal lines , such as the distribution of its curvatures @xcite .",
    "recently , the counting statistics of nodal domains for integrable and chaotic systems were investigated in @xcite , and it was shown that in the chaotic case , the statistics follow the predictions derived by assuming that the wave functions are random superpositions of plane waves @xcite . local effects due to boundary conditions , and the corresponding modifications of the random wave ensembles were also studied @xcite .",
    "the interest in the properties of the nodal set is not confined to the physics literature only .",
    "most of the mathematics literature on this subject is concerned with solutions of the helmholtz equation in the interior of compact domains in @xmath0 with dirichlet or neumann boundary conditions .",
    "courant @xcite and later pleijel @xcite pioneered these studies , and computed an upper bound on the number of nodal domains .",
    "krahn @xcite provided a lower bound for the area of a nodal domain .",
    "other authors gave estimates on e.g. , the length of the nodal sets @xcite , and addressed the general properties of the nodal network @xcite .",
    "uhlenbeck s theorem @xcite states that the nodal lines of  generic \" wave functions do not intersect ( this statement will be further discussed in the next section ) . an important class of exceptions of this rule , are the eigen - functions of separable systems , where the nodal lines form a grid , and the number of intersections equals the number of nodal domains .",
    "the purpose of the present work is to provide a _ quantitative measure _ of the degree by which nodal lines avoid each other .",
    "we shall associate the _ avoidance range _ to each avoided crossing , and will compute their distribution for the random waves ensemble .",
    "the avoidance range vanishes for an intersection , and therefore , the avoidance range distribution for separable functions is proportional to a dirac @xmath1 at zero . we also show that eigen - functions of classically chaotic systems display an avoidance range distribution which is similar to the one obtained for a random waves ensemble , while for an intermediate system , the avoidance distribution differs substantially from either of the extreme distributions mentioned above .",
    "the nodal structure for a few representative wave functions can be seen in figure ( [ fig : wavefunctions ] ) .",
    "the wave function of a rectangle ( a ) displays a perpendicular grid of nodal lines typical of separable systems .",
    "an equilateral triangle ( b ) is classically integrable , but not separable , and the wave function shows a few crossings and avoided crossings of the nodal lines .",
    "the domain in ( c ) is a sinai billiard where the classical dynamics is chaotic . with the exception of the boundary crossings",
    ", the nodal set displays a characteristic set of avoided crossings .",
    "the paper is organized in the following way : we shall begin the next section by discussing the nodal structure of general solutions of the helmholtz equation .",
    "we shall then identify avoided crossings of the nodal lines , and define the corresponding avoidance range .",
    "the avoidance range distribution will be written down explicitly . in section ( [ sec : avoid - dist ] ) we shall define the random wave ensemble and compute explicitly the expected distribution of the avoidance ranges .",
    "the resulting expression will be compared with the avoidance distributions obtained numerically for high lying eigen - functions of a chaotic domain . for dirichlet problems , the boundary belongs to the nodal set , where nodal intersections occur at a density which is approximately @xmath2 intersections per wavelength .",
    "this property can not be reproduced by the uniform random wave ensembles , which are expected to account for bulk properties .",
    "this problem , in the context of the avoided crossing distribution , is discussed at the end of section [ sec : avoid - dist ] .",
    "we consider real solutions of the helmholtz equation in a domain @xmath3 which can be expressed as linear superpositions of regular solutions of the equation in the entire plane . they can be expressed in terms of either plane or cylindrical waves , and the two representations are equivalent . in the plane waves representation",
    "the wave function is written as    @xmath4    with wave vectors ( @xmath5 ) directed at an angle @xmath6 and coefficients which ensure that the series ( [ eq : planewave ] ) converges absolutely ( we require @xmath7 to render @xmath8 real ) . using the expansion of a plane wave in cylindrical coordinates we get    @xmath9    with    @xmath10    the infinite sums in both ( [ eq : planewave ] ) and ( [ eq : cylwaves ] ) can be truncated , when one considers domains of finite area .",
    "semiclassical arguments show that the necessary number of terms is @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the perimeter of the domain . for reasons which will become clear in the sequel",
    ", we prefer to use the cylindrical wave representation in the present work .",
    "the expansion ( [ eq : cylwaves ] ) refers to a particular choice of the origin . using graf s addition theorem @xcite the origin",
    "can be shifted to @xmath13 , and the wave function retains its form ,    @xmath14    where    @xmath15    with @xmath16 , and the angle @xmath17 is measured from the direction defined by @xmath13 .",
    "the translated coefficients @xmath18 are related to the wave - function and its derivatives computed at the point @xmath13 :    @xmath19    in the close vicinity of @xmath13 , where @xmath20 , and to second order in @xmath21    @xmath22    where @xmath23 are the phases of @xmath24 . if @xmath25 , @xmath13 is a nodal point .",
    "it can not be an isolated zero since the second term vanishes on the line segment through @xmath13 which is oriented at the direction @xmath26 .",
    "hence , the nodal set consists of lines",
    ". two nodal lines intersect at @xmath13 if both @xmath27 and @xmath28 , while @xmath29 .",
    "the intersection is perpendicular since @xmath30 vanishes along two perpendicular lines which intersect at @xmath13 .",
    "for the time being we shall continue the discussion assuming that @xmath29 .",
    "the more general case will be commented on at the end of this section .",
    "an _ avoided crossing _ occurs at @xmath13 when @xmath31 and @xmath32 . in other words , when @xmath13 is a _ saddle point _ of the wave function .",
    "this can be easily seen by writing the equation of the zero set of ( [ eq : secondord ] ) in terms of the local coordinates @xmath33 ,    @xmath34    this is a hyperbola ( ellipse ) if @xmath35 is larger ( smaller ) than @xmath36 . at an avoided crossing ,",
    "the scaled distance between the two branches is    @xmath37    this is the _ avoidance range _ associated with the avoided crossing at @xmath13 .",
    "a few comments are in order :    _ i_. at a nodal intersection @xmath38 .",
    "_ ii_. at a saddle point @xmath39 in terms of @xmath8 and its cartesian derivatives reads    @xmath40    _ iv_. consider an elliptic critical point of the wave function . in the quadratic approximation",
    "the area of the elliptic nodal domain is @xmath41 this area is always larger than @xmath42 .",
    "theorem @xcite gives @xmath43 as the maximal lower bound to the area of any nodal domain , where @xmath44 is the first zero of the bessel function @xmath45 .",
    "the lower bound @xmath46 is smaller but not very far from krahn s exact value and thus consistent .",
    "so far we considered the intersections of two nodal lines .",
    "however , higher order intersections may occur .",
    "in general , if the first non vanishing coefficient at @xmath13 is @xmath47 , then @xmath13 is a nodal point of order @xmath48 , where @xmath48 nodal lines intersect at angles @xmath49 .",
    "the higher @xmath48 , the more rare are the intersections , since more conditions are to be satisfied by the coefficients .",
    "this explains uhlenbeck s theorem @xcite mention above . from now on we shall discuss the most common intersections with @xmath50 , and comment about the higher order intersections whenever necessary .    up to now we discussed individual avoided crossings , and defined the associated avoidance ranges . in the next section",
    "we shall consider the distribution of the avoidance ranges of a wave function in the domain of its definition , and compute its mean for random waves ensembles .",
    "the number of the critical points of @xmath8 in the domain @xmath51 is given by    @xmath52    with @xmath53 the jacobian .",
    "using ( [ eq : invderiv ] ) we get    @xmath54 and obtain    @xmath55    combining ( [ eq : nsp ] ) and ( [ avoiddist ] ) , the number of avoided crossings with avoidance ranges less than @xmath56 is    @xmath57    and the fraction of the total number is @xmath58 .",
    "this counting function , and its associated density @xmath59 are the distributions which characterize the avoided crossings of the nodal set .",
    "the range of @xmath56 is @xmath60 $ ] .",
    "@xmath61 is normalized such that it takes the value @xmath62 at @xmath63 .",
    "one can easily check that an avoided crossing of order @xmath48 is counted in ( [ eq : iofz ] ) with a multiplicity @xmath64 .",
    "the number ( including multiplicity ) of nodal crossings provides the value of @xmath65 .",
    "the effective multiplicity of nodal crossings of the boundary is reduced by a factor one half .",
    "numerically computed @xmath66 are shown in figure [ fig : iofz ] for the three wave functions plotted in figure [ fig : wavefunctions ] .",
    "the computed @xmath66 do not take into account the nodal crossings of the boundary .",
    "for the separable billiard all the saddle points have zero avoidance range , and the function @xmath66 is trivially equal to one in all the @xmath56 range . in the triangular billiard",
    "there are still some saddle points with zero avoidance range ( nodal crossings ) , but most of them have a finite avoidance range . for the chaotic billiard ,",
    "all the calculated saddle points have a finite avoidance range .",
    "for the three wave functions plotted in figure 1 : rectangle ( dash - point line ) ; triangle ( dashed line ) ; sinai ( full line ) . ]",
    "one of the main goals of the present work is to show that the properties of the nodal set of chaotic billiards , as detected by the distribution of avoidance ranges , are reproduced by the distributions computed for the random wave ensembles .",
    "because wave functions are subject to boundary conditions , it is expected that the predictions of the isotropic random wave ensemble used e.g. in @xcite , are relevant only to the bulk of the domain , and will do poorly in the @xmath67 vicinity of the boundary .",
    "this was observed and discussed in @xcite .",
    "the isotropic random wave ensemble is the ensemble of wave functions ( [ eq : cylwaves ] ) where the real parameters @xmath68 and @xmath69 are independent , identically distributed random gaussian variables with zero mean and unit variance for all @xmath70 . because @xmath71 the variance of @xmath72 is twice that of all the others .",
    "the ensemble average of a function @xmath73 will be denoted by @xmath74 .",
    "the local coefficients @xmath75 were derived from the original ones by a unitary transformation .",
    "hence , they are also independent identically distributed gaussian variables , and the ensemble averages of the number of critical points ( [ eq : ncp ] ) , the number of saddle points ( [ eq : nsp ] ) and the mean distribution of avoidance ranges ( [ eq : iofz ] ) can be computed by considering gaussian integrations with respect to the variables @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "a straightforward integration gives ,    @xmath78    where @xmath79 is the area of the domain .",
    "the average number of saddle points is a half of the number of critical points .",
    "the other half are the points were the wave function has either a minimum or a maximum .    the mean number of saddle points with an avoidance range less than or equal to @xmath56 can be also computed ,    @xmath80    the normalization gives trivially the mean number of saddle points in the ensemble .",
    "therefore we can define the probability    @xmath81    with a corresponding density    @xmath82    these results served to test the conjecture that the bulk properties of the nodal sets of chaotic wave functions are reproduced by the predictions of the isotropic random wave ensemble . for this purpose we computed numerically the first 2400 eigen - functions of the sinai billiard shown in figure [ fig : wavefunctions].c . for each wave - function the critical points were found by a numerical search .",
    "the saddles which correspond to boundary intersections were excluded .",
    "the avoidance range ( [ avoid1 ] ) was computed for each saddle . in figure",
    "[ fig : irw ] we plot the cumulative histogram of the avoidance ranges for the 2000th eigen - state in full line ( 1102 saddle points ) , compared with formula ( [ intprobz ] ) in dashed line . even for a single eigen - state",
    "the agreement is very good . averaging the avoidance range distributions over a group of neighboring",
    "eigen - states the numerical histogram and the theoretical curve approximately coincide .",
    "the inset in figure [ fig : irw ] shows the differences between the random wave prediction and the mean avoidance range distributions computed for two groups of eigen - states .",
    "the difference is small , and shows no systematic deviations .     for the @xmath83 eigen - state of the sinai type billiard ( full thin line ) ,",
    "compared with the random wave prediction ( [ izrw ] ) ( dash line ) .",
    "inset : difference between the average counting function over the @xmath84 = ( 1800 , 2000 ) eigen - states and the random wave prediction ( dark line ) ; the same for @xmath84 = ( 2200 , 2400 ) eigen - states ( light line ) . ]",
    "another distribution which we compared to the prediction of the random waves ensemble is the number of saddle points .",
    "normalizing the number of saddle points by the prediction of the isotropic random wave ensemble , we observe as @xmath85 increases that the numerical computation approach the predicted value ( see figure [ fig : nsp ] ) .",
    "the systematic deviation observed at finite @xmath85 is due to boundary effects .",
    "following @xcite we compute the effect of an infinite straight dirichlet line , which is reproduced by the wave ensemble    @xmath86    where the @xmath87 are real coefficients taken as independent random gaussian distributed variables .",
    "not entering into the details of the calculation , the computed mean density of saddle points approach the bulk expression ( [ meansp ] ) as the distance from the dirichlet line increases .",
    "the integrated density in the perpendicular direction shows a global deficiency of saddle points relative to the bulk value .",
    "it diverges logarithmically as a function of the distance from the dirichlet line @xcite .",
    "we compared the results of the ensemble ( [ eq : pwaves ] ) to the number of saddle points counted for highly exited eigen - states of a chaotic billiard with sufficiently smooth boundaries . the integral along the boundary multiplies the density by the perimeter of the billiard @xmath88 .",
    "the perpendicular integral must be truncated in view of the logarithmic divergence mentioned above .",
    "a sensible choice of the truncation distance is @xmath89 .",
    "the resulting estimate for the mean number of saddle points is    @xmath90    with @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "the deficiency of saddle points is explained by the effect of the dirichlet boundaries that affects the statistics .",
    "the dashed line in figure [ fig : nsp ] represents the equation ( [ eq : nspdirich ] ) and the agreement is definitely improving .",
    "however , the domain of low values @xmath93 is not in complete agreement .",
    "this deficiency can be associated with the corners of the billiard , to its curvature , or to the finiteness of the dirichlet line that the ensemble ( [ eq : pwaves ] ) can not reproduce .",
    "these possible causes will be studied elsewhere .",
    ", as a function of the wave number @xmath85 .",
    "dashed line : equation ( [ eq : nspdirich ] ) for the anisotropic random wave ensemble ( [ eq : pwaves ] ) . ]    in conclusion we can say that the properties of the nodal set of chaotic wave functions which were investigated in this work , are very well reproduced by the isotropic random waves ensemble in the semiclassical domain .",
    "these findings are consistent with previous works on the subject , and add support to the random waves conjecture .",
