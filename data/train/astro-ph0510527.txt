    "`` debris disks '' surrounding young stars are composed of optically thin dust ( see the reviews by artymowicz 2000 ; lagrange , backman , & artymowicz 2000 ; zuckerman 2001 ) .",

    "a few disks are close enough to resolve in images , either in scattered starlight ( e.g. , smith & terrile 1984 ; schneider et al .",
    "1999 ; kalas , graham , & clampin  2005 ) or in thermal emission ( e.g. , telesco et al .",

    "the remains of an optically thick , gas - rich disk from a previous herbig ae or t tauri phase ?",
    "or is it maintained in equilibrium  continuously removed by processes such as poynting - robertson drag and replenished by the comminution of larger , colliding parent bodies ?",
    "a third possibility is that the observed dust represents the transient aftermath of recent cataclysmic events .",
    "dust might be freshly generated , unequilibrated debris from the catastrophic destruction of large planetesimals ( su et al .",
    "2005 ; song et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "the debris disk encircling the young m dwarf au microscopii is a promising place to investigate these questions .",
    "it is well resolved in scattered light from optical to near - infrared wavelengths ( kalas , liu , & matthews 2004 ; krist et al .",
    "2005 , hereafter k05 ; liu 2004 ; metchev et al .",
    "2005 ) . of central relevance to our study is the disk s surface brightness profile . within a projected distance @xmath0 from the star of 43 au",
    ", the surface brightness sb falls approximately as @xmath14 ( k05 ) .",
    "we refer to this region as the `` inner disk . ''",
    "outside 43 au , in the `` outer disk , '' the slope of the profile changes dramatically : sb @xmath15 ( k05 ) .",
    "this break is observed independently by other researchers ( liu 2004 ; metchev et al .",
    "the shape of the profile is all the more significant because it resembles that of the debris disk surrounding @xmath16 pictoris @xcite , and of the recently discovered disk encompassing hd 139664 @xcite .",
    "au mic s disk is also detected in unresolved thermal emission @xcite .",
    "the disk s infrared spectrum peaks at a wavelength of @xmath17@xmath18 and exhibits no excess at @xmath19 ; this behavior suggests that the disk contains an inner hole @xcite .",
    "here we offer a theory that explains these observations quantitatively .",
    "the reason why the surface brightness profile breaks at 43 au is that a narrow ring of parent bodies , analogous to the solar system s kuiper belt , orbits the star at a stellocentric radius @xmath20 .",
    "the subscript `` br '' refers to our term for the belt of parent bodies , the `` birth ring , '' wherein micron - sized dust grains are born through collisions of larger planetesimals .",
    "grain creation is balanced in steady state by destructive grain - grain collisions and removal by corpuscular and poynting - robertson ( cpr ) drag .",
    "] corpuscular drag exerted by the young m dwarf s wind is probably at least a few times more effective at removing dust than poynting - robertson drag in the au mic system , a possibility first pointed out by plavchan , jura , & lipscy ( 2005 , hereafter pjl05 ) .",
    "the outer disk comprises grains that are only tenuously bound , moving on orbits rendered highly eccentric by stellar wind and radiation forces ( e.g. , lecavelier des etangs et al .  1996 ; augereau et al .",
    "these barely bound grains dominate scattering of starlight in the outer disk .",
    "by contrast , unbound grains escape the system too quickly for their steady - state population to contribute appreciably to the surface brightness .",
    "the inner disk is populated by grains that migrate inward by cpr drag quickly enough to evade collisional destruction . in cpr - dominated ( what we refer to as `` type a '' ) disks , a large fraction of grains meets this condition , unlike in collision - dominated ( `` type b '' ) disks .",
    "similar classifications were put forward by @xcite and @xcite in their considerations of disks composed of single - sized grains .",
    "we calculate simultaneously the steady - state spatial and size distributions of dust particles , and derive how the outer disk s optical depth scales with radius for type a and type b disks .",
    "our analysis accounts for destructive grain - grain collisions and the detailed dynamics of cpr drag , which reduces not only the orbital semi - major axes of grains but also their orbital eccentricities ( wyatt & whipple 1950 ) . the reduction of orbital eccentricity is not often considered but is a key component of our theory .",
    "whether type a or type b conditions apply to au mic s disk is determined in part by the strength of the stellar wind , which according to previous works is uncertain by orders of magnitude . in this work ,",
    "we place a novel constraint on the stellar mass loss rate and decide the appropriate disk type by comparing our theoretical models to the observations .    in  [ oom ] , we lay down basic parameters of the au mic system : stellar properties , disk optical depths , timescales for grain - grain collisions , and how the star s wind and radiation alter orbits of dust grains . in ",
