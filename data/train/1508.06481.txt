    ". however , these materials are greatly sensitive to weak perturbations ( e.g. single - ion anisotropy , dipolar interaction or quantum fluctuations ) beyond the nearest - neighboring exchange , which results in unconventional low - temperature magnetic and thermodynamic properties .",
    "one famous phenomenon is the classical spin - ice state in ho@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 and dy@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 ( with effective ferromagnetic exchange and ising anisotropy).@xcite at low temperatures , their moments have an ising anisotropy due to the strong crystal field with the local easy axis along the [ 111 ] axis .",
    "the ground states have a macroscopically degenerate `` 2-in , 2-out '' spin configuration in each tetrahedron . an interesting finding in the spin - ice materials",
    "is that the magnetic excitations could be emergent magnetic monopoles.@xcite once the flipping of a spin occurs , a local `` 3-in , 1-out '' or `` 3-out , 1-in '' spin configuration forms , which is equivalent to yielding two opposite magnetic monopoles in the adjacent tetrahedra.@xcite    for dy@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 , the external magnetic field along different directions can easily break the degenerate spin - ice state and induce various magnetic states.@xcite for example , with increasing magnetic field along the [ 100 ] axis , the system enters a q = 0 state at @xmath14 0.5 t.@xcite this state has a single spin configuration chosen from the degenerate spin - ice ground state , with all the spins on each tetrahedron having a component along the field direction and actually forming a long - range order .",
    "when the field is along the [ 110 ] direction , the system enters a q = x state at @xmath14 0.4 t.@xcite the spin system is separated into two sets of chains parallel ( @xmath15 ) and perpendicular ( @xmath16 ) to the field , with long - range ferromagnetic order and short - range antiferromagnetic order , respectively.@xcite a more complicated case occurs when applying field along the [ 111 ] direction .",
    "there are two successive transitions from the spin - ice state to the kagom - ice state and then to the fully - polarized state at @xmath9 0.3 and 0.9 t , respectively.@xcite another notable characteristics of the spin - ice materials is the very slow spin dynamics at low temperatures , demonstrated by the dc magnetization , ac susceptibility , and specific - heat measurements , etc.@xcite due to the slow spin dynamics , these field - induced magnetic transitions show significant irreversibility , which has been probed by the magnetization and neutron scattering.@xcite    yb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 has been proposed to be a good candidate for the quantum version of spin ice.@xcite the crystal - field structure of the yb@xmath17 ion is a ground - state kramers doublet well - separated from the first excited doublet .",

    "a coherent propagating of monopoles was also indicated by the terahertz spectroscopy and microwave cavity techniques.@xcite however , more detailed studies on the temperature and field dependencies of thermal conductivity are desperately needed for establishing a complete understanding of the heat transport properties .    in this work , we study in details the low-@xmath3 thermal conductivity of dy@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 and yb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 single crystals in magnetic fields up to 14 t along the [ 111 ] , [ 100 ] and [ 110 ] directions .",

    "the @xmath4 isotherms for three samples were measured at different temperatures and the irreversibilities were also probed with the measurements done in changing field ( from zero after zero - field cooling ) up and down in the step mode .",
    "the speed of changing field is slow enough to avoid observable heating effect from the eddy current .",

    "a remarkable finding is that these @xmath4 curves still exhibit clear or strong field dependencies when the field is above 7 t , which have not been achieved in those earlier works.@xcite at subkelvin temperatures , the @xmath4 for @xmath8 [ 111 ] and [ 100 ] show a broad - valley - like feature ; that is , after arriving a minimum at several tesla , the @xmath0 gradually increases in high magnetic fields . in particular , at 0.36 k , the @xmath0 at 14 t @xmath44 [ 100 ] is already larger than that at 0.5 t , where the thermal conductivity was taken for the phononic background in a recent work.@xcite in addition , the @xmath4 for @xmath8 [ 111 ] and [ 100 ] are not yet saturated in 14 t.    it is notable that the high - field @xmath4 behave rather differently for @xmath8 [ 110 ] .",

    "could be observed in a different measurement process , in which the magnetic field was continuously swept.@xcite    the relaxation of @xmath0 is the most significant for @xmath8 [ 100 ] . as shown in fig .",
    "5(c ) , although there is no sizeable relaxation effect after cooling in zero field , decreasing field to zero from high field ( 1 t or higher ) results in a slow relaxation .",
    "this is very different from the case of [ 111 ] field shown in fig .",
    "in addition , in non - zero fields , the relaxation could be very strong and is related to the history of applying field .",

    "furthermore , the @xmath0 slowly relaxes towards larger values in the case of decreasing field to 0.1 t , while it slowly relaxes towards smaller values if increasing field to 0.15 t. such differences demonstrate that the hysteresis of @xmath4 is directly related to the relaxation effect , as discussed in the following text .",
    "the time dependence of @xmath0 can be fitted by a single exponential function , @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the characteristic time constant , and @xmath50 and @xmath51 are time independent parameters . the time constant @xmath49 could be as large as 11001600 min .",
    "the situation for @xmath8 [ 110 ] is very similar to that for @xmath8 [ 100 ] , but the relaxation is a bit weaker .",
    "for example , the time constants @xmath49 are about 900 min and the @xmath0 changes about 5 % with decreasing field to 0.1 t , as shown in fig .",
    "the slow spin dynamics of the spin ice has been probed by other experiments on dy@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 , such as the dc magnetization , ac susceptibility , and specific heat.@xcite it has been found that the spin relaxation time in the spin - ice state showed an exponential increase at low temperatures and is greater than 10@xmath27 s at @xmath42 0.45 k. the current explanations are mainly in terms of diffusive motion of monopoles . after cooling in zero field to a low but finite temperature , the density of monopoles decreases gradually with time .",
    "this could induce a slow relaxation with large time scale .",
    "however , it is notable in the present @xmath0 measurements that cooling in zero field does not lead to a significant relaxation of @xmath0 .",
    "this means that the monopole dynamics does not have close correlation with the heat transport of dy@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 . on the other hand ,",

    "when field reaches 0.9 t , the spin 2 in fig .",

    "similar to the case of dy@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 , the thermal conductivity is nearly isotropy for the heat current along the [ 100 ] , [ 110 ] and [ 111 ] axes .",
    "the peak at 13 k is the typical feature of a phonon transport in insulators .",
    "moreover , there are two notable features of these data .",

    "this is likely related to the first - order transition of magnetism .",
    "second , at subkelvin temperatures , the @xmath0 do not show the @xmath36 dependence , which is expected for phonon thermal conductivity in the boundary scattering limit . actually , the @xmath0 nearly follow the @xmath97 dependence from about 2 k to 200 mk .",
    "this is consistent with a recent report.@xcite although the well - known @xmath36 ballistic behavior of phonons has been rarely observed in the transition - metal compounds , including the high-@xmath98 cuprates , the multiferroic manganites and the low - dimensional quantum magnets,@xcite the @xmath0 can usually exhibit the temperature dependence rather close to @xmath36 . in dy@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 , as shown in fig .",
    "2 , the @xmath33 dependence of @xmath0 is observed at temperatures of several hundreds of millikelvins . in yb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 , however , the @xmath97 dependence differs too much from the @xmath36 behavior .",
    "there are two possible reasons for this deviation from the boundary scattering limit .",
    "if there are sizeable scattering effects on phonons even at the lowest temperature , the phonon mean free path is significantly smaller that the sample size and @xmath36 behavior can not be observed .",
    "another possibility is the presence of the other term of heat conductivity , for example , from the magnetic excitations . in any case",
    ", the estimation of phonon mean free path can provide some useful information .    with the @xmath16 value (= 1.61 @xmath99 j / k@xmath27mol ) from the specific - heat data,@xcite the phonon mean free path can be calculated assuming the @xmath0 is purely phononic .",
    "the inset to fig .",
    "9 shows the temperature dependencies of the ratio @xmath41 .",
    "it is found that the @xmath41 ratios are only about 0.30.4 at the lowest temperatures , indicating that the boundary scattering limit of phonons is not established and there are still some microscopic scattering of phonons .",
    "it should be noted that the above calculation is based on the assumption of a purely phononic heat transport .",
    "if there were a magnetic term of heat transport , the phonon mean free path would be even smaller .",
    "nevertheless , it is clear that the phonon scattering is stronger in yb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 , compared to dy@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "it is understandable from the magnetic scattering since yb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 is known to have strong spin fluctuations.@xcite    all the zero - field @xmath10 curves show a kink - like decrease at 200 mk with lowering temperature .",
    "it might be that some term of thermal conductivity disappears when entering the low-@xmath3 state .",
    "this is likely a signature that the magnetic excitations ( monopoles ) in the quantum spin - ice state ( at @xmath21 200 mk ) can act as heat carriers.@xcite      ti@xmath1o@xmath2 crystals at low temperatures .",

    "the data have two remarkable features .",
    "first , with increasing field , the @xmath0 exhibits strong changes in low fields , followed by a quick increase , and finally becomes field independent in high fields .",
    "it naively indicates that there are magnetic scattering effects on phonons that can be suppressed in high fields , where the spins are polarized .",
    "this is consistent with the zero - field @xmath10 data and the small phonon mean free path .",
    "the strong spin fluctuations revealed by the neutron scattering is most likely the source of phonon scattering in zero field .",
    "second , the low - field behaviors are somewhat different for different directions of magnetic field . for @xmath8 [ 100 ] , the @xmath0 increase monotonically with field when @xmath42 200 mk , but show a low - field valley when @xmath21 200 mk . the position of dip field shifts to higher field with increasing temperature . for @xmath8 [ 110 ] or [ 111 ] , the @xmath4 isotherms at the lowest temperatures show a  dip \" at 0.5 t. in particular , the dip is very sharp for @xmath8 [ 110 ] , reminiscent of a field - induced transition . in this regard , the absence the  dip \" for @xmath8 [ 100 ] indicates that either there is no field - induced transition or the transition field is very low ( smaller than 0.1 t , which is the step size of our @xmath4 measurements ) .",
    "as suggested in a recent work , the low - field decrease of @xmath0 at @xmath21 200 mk may be due to the suppression of monopole heat transport in magnetic field.@xcite however , it should be pointed out that the mechanism of monopole transport is far from well understood .",
    "the present @xmath4 data with field along three different directions show some peculiar phenomenon . to illustrate , at @xmath21 200 mk the low - field behavior of @xmath0 are qualitatively different for different field directions .",
    "the position of dip field shifts to higher field with increasing temperature for @xmath8 [ 100 ] , while it changes very weakly for @xmath8 [ 110 ] and [ 111 ] .",
    "this anisotropic behavior calls for a more precise theoretical description of the monopole transport .",
    "qualitatively , a low - field valley and a strong enhancement at high field in @xmath4 are also similar to the paramagnetic scattering effect.@xcite it is known that the yb@xmath17 ions have a kramers doublet of the lowest crystal - field level . in magnetic fields ,",
    "a zeeman splitting of the doublet can produce resonant scattering on phonons and give both a low - field suppression and a high - field recovery of @xmath0.@xcite a simplified calculation has shown the qualitative behaviors of @xmath4 in the case of paramagnetic scattering ; one important feature is that the position of the @xmath4 minimum shifts to higher field with increasing temperature.@xcite since the changes of low - field valley with increasing temperature are not in good consistency with this calculation , the paramagnetic scattering may not be important in yb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "the low - field behavior of @xmath0 at @xmath42 200 mk displays different characteristics from the data at @xmath21 200 mk .",
    "the low-@xmath3 magnetization measurements have indicated that the ground state is ferromagnetic with the spin easy - axis in the [ 100 ] direction , but the residual spin fluctuations are evidenced.@xcite these results indicated that the spins are easily polarized in a rather weak field . in this regard ,",
    "the quick increase of @xmath0 with field seems closely related to the spin polarization , which suppresses the spin fluctuations . in the field along the [ 110 ] direction ,",
    "neutron scattering has revealed a field - induced transition at 0.5 t.@xcite with field lower than 0.5 t , there is significantly diffuse scattering intensity originated from the spin fluctuations . with increasing field ,",
    "the diffuse scattering intensity is weakened and well - defined spin - wave excitations appear at 0.5 t , indicating a long - range ordered state ( spin polarization).@xcite since the spin waves are gapless at the critical field of 0.5 t , they can be well populated by the thermally excitations even at very low temperatures and strongly scatter phonons .",
    "this can explain the sharp 0.5t-dip \" of @xmath4 curves .",
    "although there is no experimental investigations on this field - induced transition with field along other directions , the 0.5t-dip \" of @xmath4 curves with @xmath8 [ 111 ] may have the same origin .",
    "ti@xmath1o@xmath2 crystals in zero field and in 8 t along different directions .",

    "( d ) temperature dependencies of the ratio of the phonon mean free path @xmath34 to the averaged sample width @xmath35 , calculated from the 8 t data.,width=321 ]    in most cases , the magnetic scattering can be suppressed by strong magnetic field and the @xmath0 would be independent of field in high fields and display a @xmath36 dependence at low temperatures .",
    "however , yb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 was found to be exceptional .",
    "figure 11 shows the @xmath10 with 8 t along three different directions .",
    "it can be seen that these data do not exhibit the expected @xmath36 behavior even at @xmath42 100 mk ; instead , the data follows a @xmath33 dependence at temperatures lower than 200 - 300 mk .",
    "the phonon mean free paths are calculated and are found to be smaller than the sample sizes , as shown in fig .",
    "11(d ) , which means that there are still some kind of microscopic scattering on phonons and the boundary scattering limit is not achieved .",
    "this temperature dependence of @xmath0 in 8 t field is a peculiar phenomenon that is not easy to understand . since high field",
    "can effectively suppress spin fluctuations , there should be some other factor damping the phonon transport .",
    "firstly , there is no strong evidence for the large heat transport of monopoles in the spin - ice compound dy@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2",
    ". actually , most of the experimental data , including the zero - field @xmath10 , the @xmath4 with different field directions , the high - field behaviors , and even the relaxation phenomenon , are more or less incompatible with the supposition of large monopole transport in zero field .",
    "the quantitative analysis using some phenomenological theory gives a qualitative description of the low - field decrease of @xmath0 for @xmath100 , but it fails to explain the nearly isotropic behavior with @xmath8 [ 111 ] for @xmath0 along the field and perpendicular to it.@xcite furthermore , the calculations show that very high speeds ( @xmath6 10@xmath27 m / s ) of monopole propagating are required to describe the experimental data .",
    "this is unlikely since the monopole excitations are dispersionless and in principle they can only transport diffusively with a small averaged velocity . in the case of yb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 , the kink - like feature of @xmath10 at 200 mk is a clear signature of considerable monopole transport at the quantum spin - ice state ( @xmath21 200 mk ) . since the quantum monopoles are dispersive",
    ", it is possible they have a highly mobile characteristic .",
    "secondly , judging from the @xmath10 data and the estimation of phonon mean free path , dy@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 does not exhibit strong phonon scattering in zero field , while yb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 has rather strong scattering effect by the spin fluctuations .",
    "the high - field behaviors also demonstrate this difference .",
    "the main reason is that the monopole excitations are difficult to be thermally excited at very low temperatures due to the sizeable energy barrier ( @xmath9 4.35 k ) .",
    "thirdly , the field dependencies of @xmath0 are much more complicated in dy@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "one phenomenon is that the low - field transitions have strongest effect and cause step - like decreases of @xmath0 . since both the qualitative and quantitative analysis based on the assumption of large monopole heat transport can not describe the experimental results , some unknown phonon scattering processes are relevant . in yb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 ,",
    "the field dependencies are mainly determined by the suppression of spin fluctuations when the spins are polarized , and the field - induced transitions can cause a sharp dip - like anomaly in @xmath4 .",
    "fourthly , for dy@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 , the @xmath0 in low fields exhibit a strong relaxation effect and irreversibility . these phenomenon",
    "are not observed in the @xmath0 measurements of yb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "this is mainly related to the extremely slow spin dynamics in the low - field states of dy@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "fifthly , there are some peculiarity in the high - field heat transport of both materials .",
    "dy@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 displays strong field dependencies of @xmath0 in high field up to 14 t , which is quite anomalous considering the spins are polarized above @xmath9 2 t.@xcite yb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 shows field independent @xmath0 in the polarized state .",
    "however , the @xmath33 behavior of high - field @xmath10 is not expectable if the magnetic scattering of phonons are completely suppressed .",
    "these indicate that besides the impacts associated with the low - field magnetic transitions and spin fluctuations , some other factors are also important .    one factor can affect the phonon transport is the magnetostriction and magnetoelastic coupling in these materials .",
    "for example , at the transition from the kagom - ice phase to the saturated state with @xmath8 [ 111],@xcite the ultrasound measurement revealed sharp anomalies of the sound velocity and sound attenuation.@xcite furthermore , there is a low - field phenomenon of dy@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 that is not mentioned in the above discussions . for @xmath8 [ 100 ] or [ 110 ] and at very low temperatures , the weaker and broader step - like decreases of @xmath0 at 12",
    "t could not be related to any magnetic transitions and should have a different origin .",
    "in fact , all the earlier experimental results of magnetization and neutron scattering have not found any magnetic transition or anomaly at 12 t for @xmath8 [ 100 ] or [ 110 ] . instead",
    ", this phenomenon may be related to the magnetostriction , which exhibited a small anomaly at 2 t along the [ 100 ] direction.@xcite in this regard , the lower - field ( @xmath5 1 t ) transitions can affect the @xmath0 in the same way since they show stronger effect on crystal lattice.@xcite the high - field behavior of yb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 may be related to magnetoelastic coupling as well . in the spin - liquid tb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 ,",
    "a magnetoelastic mode is formed by the hybridization of the first excited crystal - field level and the transverse acoustic phonons.@xcite as a result , the phonon transport of tb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 is so strongly damped that it behaves like a glassy state.@xcite in yb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 , the coupling of the sound wave to quantum fluctuations has been investigated by the sound - velocity and sound - attenuation measurement.@xcite some anomalies in temperature and field - dependent sound velocity and attenuation were observed and were attributed to the first - order phase transition .",
    "moreover , these measurements ( down to 20 mk ) have found that both the sound velocity and sound attenuation change continuously with field up to 5 t , without showing any signature of saturation.@xcite this indicated that the magnetoelastic coupling is significant even in high fields . the structural distortions caused by the magnetoelastic coupling would prevent the phonons from transporting ballistically .    in summary , the low-@xmath3 thermal conductivity of spin - ice dy@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 and quantum spin - ice yb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 are studied .",
    "the detailed temperature and field dependencies of @xmath0 indicate that the mechanisms of heat transport in these materials are rather complicated .",
    "the phonons are the main heat carriers and several factors including the magnetic - monopole excitations , the field - induced magnetic transitions , the phonon scattering by spin fluctuations , and probably the structural distortions caused by the magnetoelastic coupling are involved .",
    "one conclusion is that the monopoles in dy@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 play a minor role , while the quantum monopoles in yb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 may make a sizable contribution in carrying heat .",
    "the comprehensive theories for quantitatively describing the experimental results are called for and would be very useful for understanding the exotic magnetisms of these materials .",
    "further experimental investigations on the magnetoelastic coupling in high fields are also indispensable .",
