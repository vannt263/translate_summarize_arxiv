    "standard cosmology relies on the assumption that dark matter ( dm ) represents around @xmath5 of the cosmic energy budget and behaves as a pressureless component .",
    "this behavior allows the gravitational clustering of the dm particles ( once they are decoupled from relativistic species at the early universe ) in order to form dark halos that host galaxies .",
    "such large scale structure supports the hypothesis that dm is composed of weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) @xcite though the real nature of this component is still unknown .",
    "however , the wimp scenario faces several challenges at galactic scales @xcite .",
    "the real nature of the dark matter is unknown , i.e. we do not know what it consists of .",
    "one possibility is the existence of dark scalar particles ( i.e. a spin-@xmath6 bosons ) . in this case",
    ", the scalar field @xmath7 associated with such particles has its dynamics governed by the potential @xmath8 which encloses all the interactions of such system .",
    "hence , if dark matter particles are bosons they can form , at some critical redshift @xmath9 , a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) , i.e. ground state interacting bosons trapped by an external potential @xcite .",
    "such bec stage of the dark matter was proposed in refs . @xcite and it has been widely studied in the literature @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .    in condensed matter physics the mean - field approximation is widely used . in such case ,",
    "bec systems are studied through the time - dependent generalized gross - pitaevskii equation @xcite @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the macroscopic wavefunction of the condensate , @xmath12 is the mass of the particle , @xmath13 is the trapping potential .",
    "the non - linearity term reads @xmath14 where the quadratic term accounts for the two - body interparticle interaction with @xmath15 .",
    "the term @xmath16 is strength of the three - body interparticle interaction which is neglected in numerous works on bec .",
    "the quartic term becomes important only in the case of higher densities @xcite . in the standard approach one",
    "considers the case where @xmath17 .",
    "the free parameters are the boson - boson scattering length ( @xmath18 ) and the mass of the particle ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "the application of bec physics in astrophysics has become much more clear in ref .",
    "@xcite where the authors have assumed an arbitrary non - linearity term with @xmath19 being described by the so - called madelung representation @xcite , @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the density of the condensate .",
    "hence , it comes out that bec dark matter can be described in terms of a non - relativistic newtonian fluid with barotropic equation of state that obeys the energy and momentum balances .",
    "the bec pressure is given by @xcite @xmath22    in the standard approach of bec systems @xmath23 , the effective pressure of the condensate becomes @xmath24 . within this approach",
    "remarkable results concerning galaxy curve rotation @xcite , dynamics of galaxy clusters @xcite , the core - cusp problem @xcite and galactic vortices @xcite were obtained ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "an important issue that should be addressed is whether the background evolution and the large scale structure of the universe can be affected by the existence of such bec phase of the dark matter . in reference",
    "@xcite it was assumed that the bec takes place via a first order phase transition once the temperature of the bose gas reaches the critical value @xmath25 .",
    "the cosmological parameters at the moment in which such event occurs ( i.e. density of the bose gas , the temperature and redshift ) were also established in terms of the free parameters of the bec , namely the mass of the dark matter particle @xmath12 and @xmath18 .    the growth of bec dark matter perturbations was also considered in references @xcite .",
    "the general conclusion is that assuming a positive scattering length ( that means a repulsive self - interaction ) the growth of bec dark matter inhomogeneities is faster than the standard cdm case ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "this would lead to an excess of power at small scales though the bottom - up structure formation scenario still works . in principle , such excess drives the large scale in a different way resulting in a different power spectrum @xmath27 . as an example , ultra light bosonic dm models ( @xmath28 ) are able to leave very small imprints into the acoustic peaks of the cmb @xcite .",
    "however , it has been claimed that although a different small scale clustering the collapsed bec structures ( bosons stars , black holes , etc ) behave as cold dark matter at large scales without modifying the large scale power spectrum @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to investigate more carefully the consequences of a bec dark matter cosmology for the matter power spectrum . does a bose - einstein condensate leave imprints into the @xmath27 ? using the 2dfgrs power spectrum data @xcite we will be able to investigate scales @xmath29 that still belong to the linear perturbation theory .",
    "we will assume a cosmological background evolution as proposed in @xcite , where bec dark matter coexists with baryons and cosmological constant .",
    "we reproduce such model in section 2.1 . in section 2.2",
    "we introduce the cosmological perturbation theory using the neo - newtonian equations . in order to compute the matter power spectrum , perturbations in both dark matter and baryons have to be taken into account . indeed , the observable power spectrum is the statistical distribution of the visible matter ( baryons ) which has been driven by the dark matter gravitational field .",
    "this step has not yet been done for the bec scenario . in section 3",
    "we compare the bec matter power spectrum with the data assuming different model parameters .",
    "we conclude in section 4 . throughout this paper",
    ", we shall assume @xmath30 .",
    "after the bec forms its effective pressure can assume a polytropic equation of state such as @xmath31 if one assumes an arbitrary non - linearity term .",
    "the exact value of @xmath32 is defined by the non - linear contribution of the gross - pitaevskii equation which in its standard form leads to @xcite @xmath33 the scattering length ( @xmath34 ) and the mass ( @xmath12 ) of the dark matter particle determine the dynamics of the fluid . assuming that the condensate does not interact with any other form of energy the above pressure leads , via the conservation balance , to @xmath35 the current value of the scale factor @xmath36 is @xmath37 and the current fractional density of the bec dark matter is @xmath38 where @xmath39 the critical density . combining the above relations we obtain the equation of state parameter of the bec dark matter @xmath40    a crucial quantity in this model",
    "is the moment @xmath9 at which the condensation takes place ( i.e. the transition from the `` normal '' dm phase to the bose - einstein state ) .",
    "note that before the transition the bosonic dm particles have decoupled from the primordial plasma and have formed an isotropic gas in thermal equilibrium . from kinetic theory the pressure of a non - relativistic gas in this regime",
    "is given by @xcite @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the number of spin degrees of freedom , @xmath43 is the planck constant , @xmath44 is the momentum of the particle that has energy @xmath45 with distribution function @xmath46 . for the velocity dispersion @xmath47 we assume a mean velocity square @xmath48 , leading to @xmath49 @xcite . by imposing the continuity of the pressure at @xmath9 as the thermodynamical condition to be satisfied at the critical redshift",
    ", we obtain @xcite @xmath50 the quantity @xmath51 plays the role of the dark matter equation of state parameter for @xmath52 .",
    "however , the usual approach in cosmology considers `` normal '' dm as a standard pressureless fluid .",
    "since we will assume positive scattering lengths ( @xmath53 ) the equation of state parameter @xmath54 can be negative if @xmath55 .",
    "this can occur in the past .",
    "however , typical values of the free parameters produces @xmath56 .",
    "this means that @xmath57 for @xmath58 . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath56 also implies that @xmath59 .",
    "this means that once the condensate takes place its equation of state is always positive .    assuming that the transition occurs during the matter dominated phase the radiation fluid can be ignored .",
    "the cosmic background expansion @xmath60 after @xmath9 is given by @xmath61 , \\label{h}\\ ] ] where @xmath62 is the hubble constant . assuming the wmap7 results @xcite , the current fractional density of the baryonic component is @xmath63 and the density parameter of the cosmological constant is @xmath64 .",
    "we will assume that the transition occurs suddenly at the redshift @xmath9 .",
    "this means that the effective expansion before such time is governed by the standard cosmology where @xmath65 .",
    "actually , this assumption is not exactly true .",
    "the first order transition occurs at a fixed temperature but it takes some time @xmath66 to fully convert normal dark matter into the bec state .",
    "however , as shown in @xcite for typical values of the bec parameters the full conversion takes @xmath67 .",
    "this value can be relevant at high redshifts but as we will show , concerning the matter power spectrum , the present model displays more appreciable features if the transition happens at low redshift where @xmath67 is negligible .      at scales larger than the horizon the newtonian theory fails and the full relativistic equations should be adopted .",
    "however , cosmology can be understood within the newtonian framework if we properly interpret the physical quantities like velocity , energy density and gravitational potential .",
    "such approach is known as newtonian cosmology that is a useful aproximation for a einstein - de sitter universe . however , if the inertial effects of the pressure become relevant as for example during the radiation phase or at the onset of the accelerated expansion , newtonian cosmology also fails and we need a more appropriate set of equations .",
    "the inclusion of pressure in the newtonian cosmology in order to make it relevant for the homogeneous and isotropic background gave rise to the neo - newtonian cosmology @xcite .",
    "a relativistic component sources the gravitational field through the energy - momentum tensor @xmath68 contracting @xmath69 with @xmath70 and @xmath71 we obtain , respectively @xmath72 @xmath73 since in the neo - newtonian cosmology it is assumed that the effective energy of the fluid is the trace of @xmath69 , then the pressure comes into play .",
    "moreover , the gravitational interaction occurs via the modified poisson equation @xmath74 equations ( [ continuity]-[poisson ] ) were used in @xcite in order to study cosmological perturbations .",
    "however , it is expedient to expose a cautionary remark .",
    "the neo - newtonian first - order perturbation dynamics and its relativistic counterpart coincide in the case of a vanishing sound speed only @xcite .",
    "hence , one may expect that the correct relativistic results are reproduced by the neo - newtonian perturbation dynamics on all perturbation scales at least for small values of the sound speed .",
    "the cosmological constant does not fluctuate in the standard approach .",
    "both the bec dark matter and the baryons obey separately the equations ( [ continuity ] ) and ( [ euler ] ) .",
    "the r.h.s of the poisson equation will include the contributions from all components .",
    "our set of equations will be composed of five equations .",
    "we introduce perturbations in such equations writing each quantity @xmath75 as @xmath76 where the symbol `` ^ '' ( hat ) means a first order quantity .",
    "this allows to calculate the matter density contrast @xmath77 that will be used to compute the power spectrum .",
    "collecting the first order terms and fourier transforming the perturbations as @xmath78 , with @xmath79 being the wavenumber of the perturbation , we end up with ( details of such calculations can be found in @xcite )    @xmath80    @xmath81+\\frac{3w_{be}^{\\prime}}{a(1+w_{be})}+\\frac{\\left(k / k_0\\right)^{2}c^{2}_{s}}{h^{2}a^{4}}-\\frac{3}{2}\\frac{\\omega_{be}}{h^2a^2}(1 + 3c^{2}_{s})(1+w_{be})\\right\\}\\delta_{be } = \\frac{3}{2}\\frac{\\omega_{b}}{h^{2}a^{2}}(1+c^{2}_{s})\\delta_{b},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath82 is the present hubble length . in equations",

    "the speed of sound @xmath86 of the condensate fluid is @xmath87 which is a fundamental quantity for the power spectrum .",
    "if the bec behaves as standard cold dark matter , equations ( [ deltab ] ) and ( [ deltabec ] ) admit the usual solution @xmath88 . in the next section",
    "the above set of equations will be solved for different values of the parameters @xmath18 and @xmath12 .",
    "the matter ( baryonic ) power spectrum is defined as @xmath89 where @xmath90 is baryonic density contrast calculated in equations ( [ deltab ] ) and ( [ deltabec ] ) at the present time . the baryonic agglomeration @xmath84 is driven by the gravitational field which is sourced by all the forms of energy .    in order to solve equations ( [ deltab ] ) and ( [ deltabec ] ) we need to set the initial conditions for @xmath84 and @xmath85 and their derivatives at @xmath9 where the condensate takes place . since @xmath91 for each chosen couple of values @xmath92 we need different initial conditions .    assuming a primordial harrison - zeldovich power spectrum @xmath93 and evolving it with the appropriate growth function and the bbks transfer function @xcite we obtain the theoretical expression for the power spectrum today .",
    "we will denote such result by @xmath94 . as the @xmath95cdm model also fits the data we then integrate back in time the perturbed @xmath95cdm equations from @xmath96 ( where the spectrum @xmath94 is assumed ) until @xmath97 . with this approach",

    "now , we are able to evolve equations ( [ deltab ] ) and ( [ deltabec ] ) from @xmath9 until today .",
