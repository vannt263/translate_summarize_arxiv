    "quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) is believed to be the correct quantum field theory for the strong interactions in the standard model with quark and gluons as degrees of freedom . however , at low energies , due to the strong coupling of qcd , quarks do not show up individually but in bound states called hadrons . in the regime where the light hadron spectrum is observed ,",
    "a perturbative approach is not feasible .",
    "many efforts have been done to study this sector in the past years .",
    "chiral perturbation theory @xcite as the correct effective field theories of the standard model at low energies and simulations of qcd performed numerically on a finite lattice discretizing space and time are the most used ones .",
    "in particular , lattice simulations have made huge progress in the light quark sector employing quark masses corresponding to pion masses as low as @xmath2mev or even physical masses ( see , for example , @xcite ) . in case",
    "the simulation does not use physical values for the masses one needs a certain extrapolation to the physical point , extrapolation that is performed nowadays in different ways .",
    "the most elaborated once relies on chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) which provides the correct analytic structure of amplitudes in terms of several a priori undetermined constants , the so - called low - energy constants ( lecs ) , independent of the light quark masses by construction .",
    "the number of lecs increases with the order of the expansion in chpt also increases .",
    "it is therefore impossible to extract all of them from experimental data .",
    "lattice calculations offer a new scenario for determining lecs since one can tune the quark masses in a lattice simulation .",
    "state - of - the - art lattice studies use next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) chpt for chiral extrapolations , determining for example several lecs at this @xmath3 order .",
    "nnlo chpt results have only been used recently for the interpretation of lattice data @xcite .    for comparison with lattice calculations ,",
    "the explicit dependence on the masses should be known .",
    "we propose analytic approximations of chiral @xmath0 amplitudes for the extrapolation of lattice data to the physical masses and to determine nlo and nnlo lecs through a more interesting approach than a polynomial .",

    "propagators and vertices carry the full tree structure associated with the lowest - order lagrangian . ]",
    "the most compact representation of chpt in the meson sector is in terms of the generating functional of green functions @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "analogous to the chiral lagrangian , the generating functional permits a systematic chiral expansion :    @xmath7    the nnlo functional @xmath8 of @xmath9 is itself a sum of different contributions shown pictorially in fig .",
    "[ skeletonp6 ] .",
    "in addition to tree diagrams of @xmath9 ( diagram g ) , there are two classes of contributions requiring separate treatments : irreducible ( diagrams a , b , d ) and reducible ( diagrams c , e , f ) contributions . for simplicity",
    ", we expose here the irreducible case ( the reducible one can be found in @xcite ) . with dimensional regularization ,",
    "the irreducible diagrams have both double- and single - pole divergences .",
    "moreover , the single - pole divergences of each irreducible diagram are in general non - local .",
    "renormalization theory guarantees , however , that the sum of the three diagrams has only local divergences @xcite , i.e. , polynomials in momenta and masses in momentum space .",
    "chiral symmetry guarantees that these divergences can be absorbed by the lecs of @xmath9 via diagram g. in this process an arbitrary renormalization scale @xmath10 is generated .",

    "the chiral counting suggest that the nlo to be of the order of @xmath29 , the nnlo of the order @xmath30 and the nnnlo of the order @xmath31 .",
    "that counting suggests that a good approximation to the nnlo amplitude should have an accuracy not worse than @xmath32 which would correspond to the higher order not considered in the approximation .",
    "this criterion will be applied for the @xmath1 quantity in the next subsection .",
    "the above approximation is motivated by large @xmath33 behavior but some of the terms not included in the approximate functional ( [ eq : logapp ] ) have a known analytical form . in practice",
    ", one may include those terms , i.e. , the products of one - loops amplitudes from diagrams a and c in fig .",
    "[ skeletonp6 ] , to improve the accuracy of the approximation for certain observables . this second approach ( called approximation ii ) should also satisfy the accuracy criteria .",
    "we now apply the analytic approximations approximation i and approximation ii to the ratio @xmath1 of meson decay constants .",
    "@xmath1 is a suited quantity for our exploratory exercise for several reasons : at @xmath34gev the genuine two - loop accounts less than @xmath35 and it is known numerically ( @xcite ) allowing a direct evaluation of the approximation ; the bmw collaboration @xcite provides 13 lattice points ( considering only @xmath36mev ) for that ratio .    the full nnlo calculation at physical meson masses tells us that @xmath37 at @xmath3 . at @xmath4",
    "there are three different contributions : tree level , 1-loop@xmath38 , 2-loops and contribute to @xmath39 with @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 respectively .    in our approximation ,",
    "the @xmath3 and the tree level and 1-loop@xmath38 at @xmath4 are exact by construction .",
    "our estimation for the genuine 2-loops piece amounts , using @xmath43 , @xmath44 using approximation i and @xmath45 using the approximation ii . in both cases , the criteria of applicability is fulfilled .",
    "we can now proceed on fitting the 13 data points with our approximations for @xmath1 .",

    "is found to be @xmath46    in good agreement with the result @xmath47 of ref",
    "our errors take only into account the statistical error of the lattice values for @xmath1 but not the systematical once since we do not pretend to improve on the accuracy of the result but show the feasibility of the lattice data to explore the @xmath4 chiral lagrangian .",
    "we have include the nlo lec @xmath48 in our fit because it is the only lec that appears at this order and also because at nnlo , @xmath49 is the leading piece in @xmath50 counting .",
    "we use the common fit10 @xcite values for the other @xmath51 appearing at nnlo .",
    "the residual dependence on the scale @xmath22 is evaluated by setting @xmath43 ( the lattice value ) and varying this scale by @xmath52 . in doing this ,",
    "both @xmath1 and @xmath48 remain again unchanged while the lecs of @xmath4 vary within two standard deviations .",
    "the approximations proposed here have also been applied to two more quantities .",
    "the first one is the ratio @xmath53 in chiral @xmath0 to obtain a value for the lec @xmath54 and for the chiral parameter @xmath20 , both badly known .",
    "the comparison of our approximations in that case with the numerical available results , @xcite are encouraging .",
    "the second example is the @xmath55 vector form factor @xmath56 .",
    "the particular case @xmath57 is of interest to obtain a prediction for the ckm parameter @xmath58 .",
    "the approximations discussed here do not appear very promising in this case : the chiral expansion shows an unusual behavior and the approximations do not match with the available numerical results of refs .",
    "we have proposed analytic approximations for chiral @xmath0 amplitudes starting from the structure of the generating functional of green functions to @xmath59 in such a way that only tree - level and one - loop diagrams are needed .",
    "our proposal provides useful formulas for the extrapolation of lattice data and also allows , due to their renormalization scale independence , for the determination of the lecs at nnlo otherwise difficult to extract from experimental data .",
    "these approximations are superior to the nlo amplitudes and to the well - known double - log approximations @xcite . concerning the @xmath50 expansion , these amplitudes contain all the leading and next - to - leading terms and all the chiral logarithms .",
    "this approach is specially useful in cases where the genuine two - loop contributions are small , in accordance to the large-@xmath33 counting .",
    "the particular case of the quantity @xmath1 has this property .",
    "we fit the approximated expression of @xmath1 to recent lattice data where we obtain a value for @xmath1 in agreement with the analysis of ref .",
    "we also obtain a value for @xmath48 and for the lecs of @xmath4 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 . while both @xmath1 and @xmath48 are insensitive to the approximation made , the lecs of @xmath4 are consistent with expectations but subject to uncertainties exceeding the lattice errors .",
    "all in all that suggests the potentiality to explore higher - orders on the chiral expansion using lattice data with an approximation that provides with more insight than for example a simple polynomial .",
