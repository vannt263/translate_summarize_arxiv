    "more and more evidence supports the paradigm that galaxies form hierarchicallly , i.e. that present day galaxies have been built up over cosmological time scales by the coalescence of many smaller , less massive galactic systems @xcite . for a particular galaxy",
    "this process is described by the so - called merger tree : the accumulation of dark matter mass over time into a final halo .",
    "these merger trees are extracted from numerical comological simulations and only describe the merging of dark matter haloes in a robust manner .",
    "many properties of galaxy populations including current star - formation rates , luminosity functions , the tully - fisher relation , morphology segregation , and the variation of star - formation histories with environment are explained by semi - analytical , hierarchical models .",
    "however , the role and fate of the gas and stars in this merging process is not well understood due to an incomplete understanding of the relevant physics , the simplicity of the hydrodynamical codes and the lack of numerical resolution .",
    "the behaviour of the baryons in these merging dark matter haloes is often described with semi - analytical techniques @xcite ( see also baugh et al .",
    "( this volume ) ) . in this scheme ,",
    "the physics of galaxy formation is encoded in a set of rules that are either physically motivated or have been designed to reproduce the results of numerical simulations e.g. the consequences of galaxy mergers .",
    "a merger tree ( the `` family history '' ) of a dark matter halo is either generated using monte carlo techniques or is extracted from an n - body simulation .",
    "the uppermost branches of the tree are filled with gas that is shock heated to the virial temperature of these progenitor halos , and a set of rules is followed to describe the subsequent evolution of this gas .",
    "apart from the issue of properly modelling the fate of the baryons , it is also true that the typical shape of a galaxy merger tree has not been confirmed robustly from observations .",
    "observationally , the galaxy mass functions and the merger rates as a function of redshift are largely unknown .    in this picture",
    "there still are several key questions that need to be addressed .",
    "these are :    * when and how quickly did the gas settle into the dark matter potential wells ? * where , when and how did the gas get converted into stars ? * when and how did the merging process of small galaxies develop ? * what is the relative importance of gas accretion versus galaxy merging ?",
    "* are galaxies still ( trans)forming today ?    in order to address these questions it is necessary to have a census of galaxies and their properties over a large range of environments and as large a possible range of cosmic time or redshift .",
    "while the stellar content of galaxies can be probed using optical and nir imaging and spectroscopy using the best facilities on the ground and in space , the only way to probe the cold gas content of galaxies is to use a radio telescope , either at very short wavelengths to measure molecular line emission ( see also blain et al .",
    "this volume on molecular lines ) , or at long wavelengths to measure the h0.1emi  emission using the 21-cm line . to do this out to redshifts of @xmath1 , since when",
    "considerable evolution may have taken place @xcite , requires a radio telescope tenfold larger ( in collecting area ) than any of the existing facilities .",
    "the ska is such a telescope and the purpose of this chapter is to review the current state of affairs , from both the observational and theoretical points of view , and to outline how the ska will be instrumental in answering the above questions to which we do not yet have firm answers .",
    "equally as important , ska can probe the star formation rates in galaxies using the radio continuum emission .",
    "the radio continuum emission provides an estimate of the star formation density with redshift independent of other tracers such as optical or ultraviolet light which is affected by extinction .",
    "the caveat is that the relation between the non - thermal radio emission and the star formation rate is assumed not to vary significantly with cosmic time .",
    "the framework for the discussion in this chapter will be the hierarchical structure formation models of baugh et al .",
    "( this volume ) , who use the technique of semi - analytic modelling to predict the evolution of the hi mass function and the number of star forming radio galaxies , both signposts of evolution to be probed with ska .",
    "this follows a widely accepted idea of how galaxies form , based on the success of the cold dark matter ( @xmath2cdm ) simulations .",
    "although @xmath2cdm has proven to be very succesful in reproducing the wmap results and resulting large scale structure , ska will observe the baryonic component of the universe directly .",
    "predictions of what we should observe are still wide open , as recent hydrodynamical simulations indicate that some of the basic assumptions of the semi - analytic models , i.e. that the gas gets heated quickly to the virial temperature , may not be correct . in the semi - analytic modelling",
    "the assumption is that the gas gets immediately shock heated to the virial temperature as it flows into the dark matter potential wells .",
    "recently binney @xcite , katz et al .",
    "@xcite and murali at al .",
    "@xcite have pointed out that hydrodynamical simulations suggest that most of the gas is not heated to the virial temperature but accretes slowly in a cool phase from the surrounding large scale structure filaments .",
    "the consequence is that galaxies grow through accretion of gas rather than merging of dark matter halos . at redshifts beyond @xmath3",
    "this cool mode of accretion appears to dominate over merging as the main process for galaxy formation .",
    "because these two scenarios differ in the evolutionary scenario of the gas , ska is the ultimate telescope for distinguishing these from one another .",
    "we will first discuss the properties of radio continuum emission from galaxies and in this context the first luminous objects in the universe .",
    "then we will discuss the subsequent evolution of galaxies following the theoretical scenarios , and finally connect this with the evolution of galaxies which is still ongoing and observable at the present time in the local universe .",
    "when and how the first episodes of star formation took place remains a key question of modern cosmology .",
    "much effort has been devoted to measuring the integrated cosmic star formation rate ( sfr ) of the universe as a function of redshift or look - back time , initially at ultraviolet wavelengths @xcite , and more recently in the millimetre and radio regimes @xcite . unlike ultraviolet or optical light , radio continuum emission is unaffected by dust , which eliminates the need for uncertain extinction corrections .",
    "ska will detect the radio continuum emission from very large numbers of agn and star  forming galaxies at redshifts @xmath4 .",
    "however , we caution that the conversion between a measured radio continuum flux and a derived a global sfr requires the adoption of canonical scaling relations @xcite which remain valid out to at least @xmath51 @xcite but , as we discuss below , may not be directly applicable to primordial star - forming systems at @xmath4 .    in the models considered here , the radio continuum emission from star  forming galaxies",
    "is computed using the spectro - photometric code grasil written by silva et al.@xcite .",
    "this code takes star  formation histories generated by galform , including bursts of star formation , and produces a full spectral energy distribution , ranging from the far - uv to the radio .",
    "the radio emission includes both synchroton radiation by electrons accelerated in supernova remnants and free  free emission from hii regions .",
    "the plots presented in this section are for a model very similar to that of baugh et al .",
    "( this volume ) .",
    "note that beyond redshifts of @xmath6 inverse compton losses against the cosmic microwave background will begin to affect the synchrotron emission .",
    "the non - relativistic , thermal emission is not affected @xcite so that radio continuum emission still is a very good tracer of star formation at high redshifts , albeit in another regime .",
    "little is currently known about the properties of star  forming objects at redshifts above z@xmath8 but the next few years are likely to see rapid progress in this area .",
    "several recent results suggest substantial star formation at high redshift @xcite .",
    "studies of the stellar ` fossil record ' of nearby galaxies for example ( e.g. @xcite ) imply that the star  formation rate in the most massive galaxies increases with redshift and peaks at z=3 or higher .",
    "the recent detection of qsos at redshifts with z@xmath76 @xcite , in which the gas appears to have solar or above - solar metallicity @xcite suggests that the massive first stars in the universe had already formed by z=8 or even earlier .",
    "observations with the hst and ground  based optical / ir telescopes have begun to provide direct measurements of the number of star  forming galaxies at @xmath5 56 @xcite .",
    "these studies find typical surface densities of @xmath9deg@xmath10 for star  forming galaxies at @xmath11 .",
    "so it appears that the global star  formation rate at @xmath11 is roughly similar to that at @xmath534 , though with substantial uncertainities because the distribution of high  redshift galaxies appears to be clustered on scales comparable to the diameters of the individual fields studied to date @xcite .    at even higher redshift ,",
    "the detections of individual ( gravitationally  lensed ) galaxies at @xmath12 @xcite and @xmath13 @xcite have recently been reported , but the density of star  forming galaxies at @xmath14 is essentially unknown at present .",
    "ska will be a sensitive probe of high - redshift star formation through the detection of radio continuum emission from star  forming regions and the radio afterglows of gamma ",
    "ray bursts ( grbs ) , many of which are now known to arise from the supernova explosions of massive stars .",
    "models for dwarf galaxies forming in the vicinity of high  redshift qsos imply likely star  formation rates of 3060 m@xmath15/yr for these objects @xcite .",
    "deep continuum surveys at 1.4ghz with ska will reach detection limits of 100njy in 8hr , and as low as 10njy in longer integrations of @xmath161000hr @xcite .",
    "this should allow objects with star ",
    "formation rates as low as 10 m@xmath15/yr to be detected at redshifts up to z@xmath164 ( 8hr ) and z@xmath1611 ( in 1000hr ) respectively ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : sf_flux ] ) . individual globular clusters forming at high redshift may also be detectable by ska , though there are currently few available predictions for the star ",
    "formation rates in such objects .",
    "ska will be able to detect very faint ( 10100njy ) radio continuum sources , i.e. 23 orders of magnitude fainter than those seen by present ",
    "day telescopes .",
    "it is therefore important to keep in mind that simulations of the likely surface density , angular size and redshift distribution of these faint sources require extrapolations from our current knowledge ( as well as assumptions about the cosmic evolution of each population )",
    ". nevertheless , the work done so far ( e.g. @xcite ) gives us some valuable ideas about what to expect . at 100njy , the surface density of continuum sources will be very high ( @xmath16200,000deg@xmath10 ) , with `` normal '' , starburst and active galaxies all contributing over a wide range in redshift .",
    "simulations by hopkins et al .",
    "@xcite imply that very high  redshift ( @xmath17 ) agn and starburst galaxies will have surface densities of @xmath161,000deg@xmath10 and @xmath167,000deg@xmath10 respectively in surveys with a detection limit of 100njy at 1.4ghz .",
    "although star  forming galaxies dominate the radio source counts at flux densities below about 1mjy , active galaxies still account for a significant fraction of the population at levels of a few @xmath18jy @xcite .",
    "the problem of distinguishing star  forming galaxies from agn is discussed by garrett et al .",
    "several parameters measurable by the ska itself ( including brightness temperature , morphology , time variability and possibly polarization ) can be used , and garrett et al.@xcite show that radio continuum observations with high spatial resolution ( @xmath19mas ) can reliably distinguish agn from star forming galaxies at faint flux levels .",
    "this would require the ska to have good sensitivity on baselines of at least 3000 km .",
    "high spatial resolution is also required because of the likely source density at flux levels of @xmath1610njy , which may be as high as 3arcsec@xmath10 @xcite .",
    "+      because of their transient nature , which makes them easy to recognize , and because they appear to be associated with the supernova explosions of young , very massive stars , grbs may be one of the most direct tracers of star formation at very high redshifts .",
    "ska , with its wide field of view , should be able to detect the radio afterglows of many ` orphan ' grb events in which the jet is misaligned with the observer s line of sight , and thus remains undetected in gamma ",
    "rays ( e.g. frail et al @xcite ) .",
    "bromm & loeb @xcite predict that at least 50% of grbs originate at redshift @xmath17 , and berger et al.@xcite find that grb host galaxies have typical star ",
    "formation rates of at least 100m@xmath20/yr . in the next decade , therefore , grbs are likely to become increasingly common probes of high  redshift star formation up to ( and perhaps even within ) the epoch of reionization .      although ska will be able to detect many millions of star  forming galaxies over a very wide range in redshift , recognizing the highest  redshift objects will not be straightforward . for most star  forming galaxies with z@xmath213 , redshifts should be available from the large  area hi surveys which ska itself will carry out .",
    "alternatives at higher redshift include : +",
    "( i ) hi absorption lines ( @xcite ; see also kanekar and briggs , this volume ) .",
    "+ ( ii ) co emission ",
    "line redshifts , using either the low order transitions observed with ska , or higher  order transitions observed with alma .",
    "( see blain et al .",
    "this volume ) + ( iii ) radio photometric redshifts based on the spectral slope between 1.4ghz and 350 ghz @xcite .",
    "this would require matching high - frequency observations from alma .",
    "+ ( iv ) photometric redshift estimates from wide - field multicolour optical / ir images , or spectroscopic measurements in the optical / ir for small samples of particular interest .",
    "in this section , we examine the assumptions underlying the use of the radio continuum to measure sfr , and assess their validity at the high redshifts where ska will be able to make a unique contribution .",
    "we also outline new simulations which will enable us to better interpret the planned deep surveys .    because of the far - infrared / radio ( fir - r ) correlation ( e.g. @xcite )",
    ", it is straightforward to show that the radio luminosity in evolved luminous starbursts varies only with sfr @xcite .",
    "the radio continuum emission below about 10ghz is dominated by non - thermal emission , which is thought to be proportional to the supernova rate @xmath22 .",
    "although the mechanism linking @xmath22  to the non - thermal radio luminosity is complex , depending on poorly understood physics of cosmic - ray confinement and diffusion operating over @xmath23yr , radio continuum surveys have been used to constrain co - moving sfr locally , and at redshifts of up to z@xmath1612 @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , standard conversion of the radio continuum may not properly estimate the sfr for all galaxies .",
    "low - luminosity dwarf galaxies , particularly bcds , have higher sfrs than would be estimated by applying canonical relations @xcite and also have globally flatter radio spectral indices , clearly reflecting a dominant thermal component @xcite . in these galaxies , particularly those of low metal abundance",
    ", the sfr derived assuming the standard mix of thermal / non - thermal contributions is underestimated by a factor of five or more @xcite .",
    "while rare locally ( see @xcite ) , low - metallicity low - mass galaxies might be much more frequent at early times and high redshifts , given the predictions of the hierarchical merger models ( e.g. baugh et al .",
    "( this volume ) , @xcite . indeed",
    ", such objects may represent the primordial `` building blocks ''  or `` sub - galaxies '' @xcite  in hierarchical scenarios of galaxy formation .",
    "consequently , at redshifts @xmath4 , it is possible that the canonical scaling of sfr with radio continuum does not apply .",
    "such a systematic mis - estimate of sfr could strongly skew our interpretation of deep radio continuum surveys .",
    "while the ubiquity of the radio / far - infrared ( rfir ) correlation is well documented ( e.g. @xcite , it is also clear that the slope of the relation depends on the characteristics of the sample .",
    "samples dominated by low - luminosity galaxies have steeper than unit slopes @xcite but unit or flatter slopes are obtained for high - luminosity samples ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this is equivalent to saying that the ratio of fir - to - radio luminosity @xmath24 ( @xcite ) : @xmath25\\ ] ] ( with fir = @xmath26 $ ] ) increases with decreasing luminosity @xcite , as shown in figure [ fig : q ] .",
    "the slope inflection of the fir - r correlation at low luminosities probably stems from a number of factors involving both the radio continuum and the infrared sed .",
    "moreover , there is some evidence that both the radio continuum and fir underestimate the sfr at low luminosities @xcite .",
    "as noted above , thermal emission increasingly dominates the radio spectrum of galaxies with low luminosity and low metallicity in general , and this is reflected in their flatter radio spectral indices @xcite . the same trend is seen in galaxies with very young star - forming regions , where non - thermal radio emission is virtually absent @xcite .",
    "the sfr estimated by assuming a purely thermal spectrum is roughly ten times higher than inferred from a `` standard '' mainly non - thermal spectrum @xcite .",
    "moreover , optically thick hii regions are very likely to be prevalent in young starbursts @xcite .",
    "this means that instead of a flat thermal spectrum , we would see a rising or highly - absorbed spectrum at @xmath161ghz , which would again alter the standard assumptions .",
    "such an effect would also be expected to vary with redshift .",
    "if non - thermal radio emission is suppressed in low - luminosity galaxies , the disk magnetic field must either be absent or substantially weaker than in galaxies with higher luminosities ( see @xcite ) .",
    "if the starbursts are young , it could also mean that there has not been enough time to set up the usual @xmath27yr diffusion of cosmic ray electrons @xcite .",
    "if the radio emission is also compact ( @xmath21200pc ) , such as that in many bcds ( e.g. , sbs0335@xmath28052 ) , there can be no @xmath16kpc large - scale diffusion .",
    "this means that any non - thermal emission must be produced by a different mechanism ( e.g. evolved supernovae expanding in a dense medium @xcite ; young supernova remnants ; etc . ) .    in any case , the inescapable implication of the radio spectral differences as a function of luminosity , metallicity , or age is that the _ conversion of radio continuum to sfr may change as a function of redshift .",
    "_ while this is probably not an issue with current facility surveys which probe only a limited redshift regime , deep ska surveys will be able to detect not only the most luminous radio sources at each redshift , but also adequately sample the statistically dominant `` normal '' star - forming population out to redshifts of 10 or so .",
    "changes in the conversion factors as a function of redshift need to be considered when mapping cosmic star formation .",
    "the integrated star - formation history of the universe ( the madau diagram ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : heavens ] ) is likely to be accurately mapped out fairly soon .",
    "this tells us _ how much _",
    "star  formation occurred at a given cosmic epoch , but to understand galaxy evolution we need to know more than this .",
    "in particular , _ where _ and in what range of environments , did star formation occur at each epoch ?",
    "did most stars form in galaxies undergoing `` quiescent''star formation , or in galaxies undergoing violent starbursts , and how does this vary with redshift ? how important a role do mergers play in triggering star formation ? in the local universe ,",
    "star formation occurs in a wide range of environments , and in galaxies with star ",
    "formation rates ranging over at least five orders of magnitude ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sfdensity ] ) .",
    "there is no reason to suppose that the high  redshift universe is any less diverse .",
    "understanding the evolving stellar content of galaxies , and the chemical enrichment of the interstellar and intergalactic medium which accompanies this , requires a multi - wavelength approach .",
    "alma is sure to have a big impact , and will be a powerful tracer of star  forming galaxies over a wide redshift range , detecting large numbers of normal star  forming galaxies out to z@xmath163 and arp 220like starbursts to z@xmath1610 ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "but ska can equally well chart out such luminous star burst galaxies at almost any redshift and has the great advantage of a much larger field of view and hence superior survey capabilities .",
    "moreover , unlike alma , the sensitivity of ska to star formation does not depend on the presence of metals .",
    "since the first stars must form in a primordial metal - free environment , molecular clouds would not be expected to contain co or other molecules beyond molecular hydrogen .",
    "hence ska will provide a much `` cleaner '' less biased view of high - redshift star formation .",
    "ska has the unique ability to trace the transformation of hi gas into stars ( and into the enriched hot gas which future x  ray missions will detect ) in a wide range of environments and over a large fraction of cosmic time .",
    "the fact that hi observations trace the depth of a galaxy s potential , and so can relate star ",
    "formation to halo mass as well as to luminosity , is also important because it allows direct tests of galaxy evolution models which deal with mass as well as light .",

    "line observations typically require a brightness sensitivity of a few kelvin , which in practice limits the angular resolution . for ska",
    "this implies the following : if one takes as a guideline a @xmath30 sensitivity of @xmath31 kelvin in a @xmath32 beam at 1.4 ghz ( so baselines out to at most a few hundred km ) , then one can detect @xmath33 galaxies out to a redshift of @xmath34 in a 12 hour integration . although the current design goals require a field of view of one square degree at 1.4 ghz , a much wider field of view appears technically feasible , and would provide an impressive gain in survey speed ( see also blake et al .",

    "<S> the unsurpassed sensitivity and resolution of the square kilometer array ( ska ) will make it possible for the first time to probe the continuum emission of normal star forming galaxies out to the edges of the universe . </S>",
    "<S> this opens the possibility for routinely using the radio continuum emission from galaxies for cosmological research as it offers an independent probe of the evolution of the star formation density in the universe . </S>",
    "<S> in addition it offers the possibility to detect the first star forming objects and massive black holes </S>",
    "<S> .    in deep surveys ska will be able to detect h0.1emi  in emission out to redshifts of @xmath0 and hence be able to trace the conversion of gas into stars over an era where considerable evolution is taking place . </S>",
    "<S> such surveys will be able to uniquely determine the respective importance of merging and accreting gas flows for galaxy formation over this redshift range ( i.e. out to when the universe was only one third its present age ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is obvious that only ska will able to see literally where and how gas is turned into stars .    </S>",
    "<S> these and other aspects of ska imaging of galaxies will be discussed . </S>"
