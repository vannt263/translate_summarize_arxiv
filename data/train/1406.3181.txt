    "the balance between excitatory and inhibitory elements is of great relevance for processes of self - organization in various neurological structures @xcite .",
    "synchronization is one prominent phenomenon that is critically influenced by the balance of excitation and inhibition @xcite and is itself an important mechanism involved in processes such diverse as learning and visual perception on the one hand @xcite and the occurrence of parkinson s disease and epilepsy on the other hand @xcite .",
    "exploring the preconditions for synchronization on a theoretical level can be effectively performed within the framework of complex dynamical networks  a field that has gained much attention during the last decades @xcite .",
    "the influence of a particular network architecture can be rich and is widely studied .",
    "however , the interaction between the elements of the network can be modeled not only by the strength of the connecting links , but in addition , time - delayed coupling can be incorporated to take into account finite signal transmission times .",
    "a single constant delay time , referred to as discrete time - delay , already influences the system s dynamics @xcite and its synchronization properties @xcite dramatically . yet",
    ", more complex concepts of time - delay have been considered recently to achieve a better correspondence between the model and natural systems @xcite .",
    "a distribution of delay - times arises naturally , if a model is constructed from experimental data .",
    "for instance , the delay distribution in a specific avian neural feedback loop can be well approximated by a gamma distribution @xcite .",
    "additionally , time - dependent delay - times can as well be represented by distributed delay , if the delay - time varies rapidly compared to intrinsic time - scales of the system @xcite .",
    "recent theoretical studies of systems with distributed delay have addressed amplitude death @xcite and non - invasive stabilization of periodic orbits @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we study the effects of distributed time - delay on synchronization in a network model with inhibitory nodes .",
    "the stability of synchronization is investigated using the master stability function ( msf ) approach @xcite . with this technique",
    "the effect of the network topology can be separated from the dynamics of the network s constituents , which is described by the master stability function of a complex parameter @xmath0 .",
    "the eigenvalues of the coupling matrix representing the network structure then yield the stability for a specific network when they are inserted for the parameter @xmath0 .",
    "thus , distributed delay , which affects the dynamics , and inhibition , which alters the eigenvalue spectrum of the coupling matrix , can both be investigated independently .",
    "this work extends previous works @xcite on inhibition - induced desynchronization in time - delayed networks in two ways .",
    "first , distributed delay is considered instead of discrete delay .",
    "second , a more realistic network model based on inhibitory nodes instead of inhibitory links is proposed and studied",
    ". such a model might be more appropriate especially in the context of neuroscience , where for the majority of neurons it is established that the same set of neurotransmitters is released at each synapse , a rule which is often referred to as dale s law .",
    "thus , it is reasonable to assume that in most cases a neuron either excites all its neighbors or inhibits all its neighbors , and not a combination of both .",
    "in contrast to previous work @xcite where the inhibitory links have been added randomly , we develop a highly symmetric model , which has two main advantages . first , the eigenvalue spectrum of the coupling matrix is real and can be calculated analytically .",
    "second , in networks with randomly added inhibition , the increase of inhibition is accompanied by the increase of asymmetry .",
    "thus , it is not possible to study the pure effect of inhibition , but only a combined effect of asymmetry and inhibition .",
    "this difficulty does not arise in the network model proposed here .    as the network",
    "s constituents we choose stuart  landau oscillators .",
    "in contrast to simple phase - oscillators like the kuramoto oscillator , this paradigmatic non - linear oscillator has an additional radial degree of freedom , which leads to more complex dynamics , i.e. , coupled amplitude and phase dynamics .",
    "further , it can be used to describe generally any system close to a hopf bifurcation , which occurs in a variety of prominent systems used to model e.g. , semiconductor lasers @xcite , neural systems like the fitzhugh - nagumo model @xcite or the morris - lecar model @xcite .",

    "we derive and characterize the eigenvalue spectrum of its coupling matrix .",
    "in section [ sec_sync ] , we investigate the existence of synchronous oscillations with respect to the distributed delay parameters .",
    "subsequently , we analyze their stability in section [ sec_stable ] . in section [ sec_trans ] , we discuss how the interplay of distributed delay and inhibitory nodes influences the stability for the specific network model proposed here .",
    "the robustness of our results against asymmetric perturbations of the network topology is investigated numerically in section [ sec_asym ] .",
    "we conclude our work in section [ sec_conc ] .",
    "the topology of a network is encoded in its coupling matrix @xmath1 . here , we consider networks without self - coupling @xmath2 and normalized row sum @xmath3 which allows for the existence of synchronous solutions . as",
    "the stability of the synchronous state depends on the eigenvalue spectrum of @xmath1 , we are interested in the question how the balance between excitatory and inhibitory nodes influences the latter .    it is known that inhibition corresponding to negative entries in the coupling matrix increases the spreading of the eigenvalue distribution in the complex plane @xcite . for a symmetric network with excitatory nodes only ,",
    "all eigenvalues are real and located within the interval @xmath4 $ ] due to gershgorin s circle theorem @xcite . adding inhibition can cause the existence of eigenvalues with absolute values larger than one .",
    "furthermore , introducing inhibition randomly causes asymmetric coupling matrices that have complex eigenvalues .",
    "these two effects are usually intertwined .",
    "however , it is desirable to investigate the effects of inhibition independently from the effect of asymmetry .    to this end",
    ", we introduce a simple network model with excitatory and inhibitory nodes , whose coupling matrix has a real eigenvalue spectrum that can be calculated analytically .",
    "thus , it is capable of providing clear statements about the influence of inhibitory nodes that underline similar numerical results found previously @xcite .",

    "[ fig_desync]c . since for stability",
    "all eigenvalues of the coupling matrix are required to lie inside the stability regions , the gap of the eigenvalue spectrum of @xmath1 is crucial . it must contain the stability gap of the msf in order to induce resynchronization above the critical inhibition ratio .",

    "[ fig_desync]d .",
    "the last two examples illustrate how crucial the delay distribution width is for the stability of synchronization in a network with inhibitory nodes . depending on the distribution width",

    "thus , we can conclude universal statements from the msfs by categorizing them into the five distinct regimes listed above .",
    "this procedure is independent of the specific form of the distribution .",
    "for instance , the msf for the @xmath70-distribution can be categorized by the same means . in the @xmath120-plane of the topological eigenvalue @xmath0 and the standard deviation @xmath116 of the delay distribution , evaluated at different time - offsets @xmath53",

    "the network model considered here has the advantage that it can be treated analytically due to its high degree of symmetry .",
    "however , real - world networks will typically possess a certain degree of asymmetry .",
    "thus , it is interesting to investigate whether the qualitative nature of the synchronization  desynchronization transitions observed for this specific network model is robust against asymmetric perturbations of the network topology .    in order to address this question , we propose a rewiring algorithm which breaks the network symmetry and investigate the synchronization  desynchronization transitions for those perturbed networks .    for an arbitrary asymmetric network the stability of synchronization can no longer be calculated analytically since the topological eigenvalues of the coupling matrix are not known in closed form and have to be computed numerically .",
    "they are complex and thus have to be compared to the master stability function evaluated in the @xmath121-plane .",
    "we choose a rewiring algorithm that leaves the number of inhibitory and excitatory nodes constant such that the inhibition ratio @xmath32 remains a characteristic network parameter . to this end",

    "in this paper we have introduced a dynamic network model , where the influence of the excitatory - inhibitory node balance could be directly tracked in the eigenvalue spectrum of the coupling matrix . for this model",
