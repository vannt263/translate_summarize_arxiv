    "studying the kinematics of the satellites of the milky way ( mw ) allows us to adddress various fundamental issues such as the origin and evolution of this satellite system ( and the mw itself ) , the role of tidal interactions in the evolution of the local group ( lg ) and the matter distribution of the latter ( including that of the dark matter , thus allowing tests of some cosmological predictions @xcite ) .",
    "this requires tracing their positions back in time , by integrating their orbits , which , in turn , requires knowing their current positions and their full 3-d space velocities .",
    "while radial velocities for lg galaxies are known to better than @xmath35  km  s@xmath5 , and their distances to @xmath310% , the biggest source of uncertainty rests on their proper motions ( pms ) .    in the year 2000",
    "we started a ground - based program aimed at determining the absolute pm of three southern dwarf spheroidal ( dsph ) galaxies , carina , fornax and sculptor , with respect to background quasars ( qsos ) , used as inertial reference points .",
    "three to four epochs of homogeneous ccd data were obtained using a single telescope+detector setup over a period of eight years : ours is the first entirely optical ccd / ground - based pm study of an external galaxy other than the magellanic clouds .    in mndez",
    "et al . ( 2010 , hereafter paper  i ) , we presented a detailed description of our methods , as well as our first results for the pm of fornax , based on one qso field ( qj0240 - 3434b ) . in this paper",
    "we present our final pm for fornax based on measurements from five qso fields in the background of fornax . in section  [ obs ]",
    "we present a summary description of our observational material , in section  [ pms ] we explain how we obtained our pms , and , finally , in section  [ comp ] we compare our results to previous studies and present our main conclusions .    the fornax dsph galaxy , at a distance of 147  kpc ( e.g. , pietrzyski et al .",
    "2009 ) , is relatively isolated , luminous and well - resolved into individual stars .",
    "it seems to be dark matter dominated , and has an estimated total mass of @xmath6  m@xmath7 ( e.g. , walker et al . 2007 ) . unlike other dwarf galaxies , fornax harbours five globular clusters @xcite , and it appears to have a complex stellar substructure in the form of shell - like features indicative of recent merger activity ( coleman et al .",
    "2004 , coleman & da costa 2005 , olszewski et al .",
    "furthermore , results by @xcite suggest that the ancient stellar population in the centre of fornax is not in equilibrium ( apparent as a non - gaussian , double peaked velocity distribution ) , which also points to a relatively recent accretion of external material , such as gas accretion due to the merger with another smaller stellar system .",
    "all observations were carried out with the `` superb seeing imager '' , susi2 , attached to one of the nasmyth focii of the eso 3.5  m ntt telescope at la silla observatory in chile .",
    "the overall characteristics of the detector are fully described in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we followed exactly the same observational , reduction , and calibration procedures for all of our qso fields as described in paper  i. therefore , in as much as possible , our dataset is homogeneous from this point of view ( for certain limitations to this statement , see section  [ pms ] ) .",
    "susi2 is a mosaic of two 2k@xmath84k eev 44 - 82 chips ( called # 45 , on the west side , and # 46 , on the east side , for the adopted rotator angle of 0 ) .",
    "as explained in paper  i , we always placed our qsos at a nominal pixel position near @xmath9 , close to the middle of chip # 46 , and only data from this chip was subsequently used for our astrometry .",
    "all of the astrometric observations , including those required to compute the differential chromatic constants ( dcr - see paper  i , section  3.3 . ) , were acquired through a bessel r filter , whereas for the blue frames needed to construct color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) we used the bessel b filter , both of which are part of the standard set of filters available for susi2 .",
    "our initial list of qsos in the background of fornax comprised all eleven distinct qsos ( one , reported in paper  i , forms a gravitational lens pair ) reported by @xcite ( their table  5 ) and @xcite ( his table  1 ) .",
    "unfortunately , several of them proved to be useless for astrometry : deep , good - seeing ( fwhm@xmath30.5  arcsec ) images taken during the first epoch revealed that they were either too faint for our required astrometric @xmath10 ( @xmath11 integrated over the psf fitting radius ; see paper  i , section 3.2 and figure  4 ) , had a noticeably elongated structure ( and therefore had a different , usually more extended , psf than that of the stars ) , had a very nearby ( usually stellar - like ) bright companion , or were definitely blended with field stars . as explained at length in paper  i , any of these features render these targets unsuitable for high - accuracy relative astrometry .",
    "these problematic qsos were dropped from the observing list in subsequent epochs , and we concentrated on `` clean '' ( as far as we could determine with a seeing of @xmath30.5  arcsec ) qsos . our final list of five qsos , from which we were able to determine the pm of fornax , is given in table  [ tbl1 ] , where we also show the full list of known qsos behind fornax from the above - cited references .    in figure  [ fields ]",
    "we show the stellar configuration in the immediate surroundings of each of our five selected qsos .",
    "all of these images were acquired on the first epoch , when we consistently had very good seeing ( fwhm@xmath30.5  arcsec ) .",
    "the only potentially problematic case was that of qj0239 - 3420 which has a faint companion to the nw , at a distance of @xmath12  arcsec .",
    "fortunately , this nearby source is very dim ( with a star / qso peak brightness ratio smaller than 0.1 ) , and far enough ( farther than @xmath13 , adopted as the psf fitting radius , see paper  i , section  3.2 and figure  4 ) that , even on our worse frames ( with a fwhm of @xmath14  arcsec ) , it did not pose a problem for the astrometric solution , and so it was fully included in our analysis below .",
    "table  [ tbl2 ] contains a summary of the observational material that was , in the end , used to compute our pms .",
    "we note that more data was acquired for these qso fields , but proved to be useless on account of bad seeing , poor image quality ( deteriorating the astrometric solution ) , or bad sky transparency .",
    "as explained in paper  i , at the start of our program we adjusted the exposure time on the basis of seeing ( typical values were between 300  s and 900  s ) , but later , it was decided to use a fixed integration time of 900  s in all cases for simplicity .",
    "to determine the pms we used the same procedure described at length in paper  i. a flow - chart summary of the full process is presented in figure  [ flow ] .",
    "we refer the reader to paper  i for further details on the methodology and precise meaning of all steps . even though in our pm solutions we only included frames acquired within @xmath15  hr . from the meridian ( see table  [ tbl2 ] ) , all of our coordinates were ( pre)-corrected for ( continuous ) atmospheric refraction and dcr as described in paper  i. we also excluded from the pm solution all frames with a @xmath16  arcsec , as they clearly deteriorated the linear fit of baricentric position _",
    "vs. _ epoch diagram ( see , e.g. , fig .",
    "12 in paper  i ) , where these frames stand - out due to their large scatter .",
    "all pm data were treated as homogenously as possible , including the following constraints :    * all stars with @xmath17  @xmath1 in our initial local reference system ( lrs , basically a set of `` high - quality '' reference stellar images , eventually bona - fide fornax stars - see paper  i ) , indicating that they are either foreground galactic stars , or that they have a high ( pseudo)-pm , possibly due , e.g. , to a faint unresolved companion or another problem in the image ) , were purged from the lrs .",
    "the full geometric registration ( and pms ) for the remaining lrs stars and the qso were re - computed in an iterative process , * all lrs stars that exhibited a registration residual @xmath18 of the formal rms of the two - dimensional geometric registration in the @xmath19 or @xmath20 coordinates in at least four ( not necessarily consecutive ) frames , were eliminated from the lrs . for registration we used a full 3@xmath21 order polynomial fit , which has been justified in paper  i , * all lrs stars with @xmath22  @xmath1",
    "were excluded from the lrs .",
    "the cut value , @xmath23 , was estimated for each field based on the distribution of pm errors _ vs. _ magnitude ( see table  [ tbl3 ] ) , * lrs stars exhibiting a pm error larger than that of the bulk of the lrs stars at a given magnitude ( even if they , individually , had @xmath24 ) were eliminated .",
    "this cut was done visually , on plots of pm error vs. magnitude for each qso field , * finally , we expunged objects that in the cmd appeared not to belong to fornax .",
    "this photometric cleansing was done by first calibrating our instrumental photometry following the procedure described in paper  i ( section  4 ) , and then by comparing our resulting cmd with that of @xcite , which defines the main features of the fornax cmd .    in table",
    "[ tbl3 ] we show a summary of what results from applying the above criteria to the initial set of lrs stars for each of our five qso fields . after applying all previously described cuts",
    ", we verified that we ended with a uniform @xmath25 distribution of the lrs stars ( see , e.g. , figure  15 in paper  i ) , and with a reasonable distribution in magnitude and color .",
    "the resulting cmds for the lrs stars and the respective qso are shown in figure  [ cmd ] .",
    "we note that in paper  i we calibrated our photometry approximately by adopting a color of @xmath26 for the red - clump from @xcite and the qso blue magnitude from the works by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "however , we noticed that , probably as result of uncertainties in the blue photographic magnitudes for the qsos ( and/or possible qso variability ) , the ordinate in these figures had a large zero - point variation from field to field , and hence the red - clump did not fall at the same apparent @xmath27 magnitude for the five fields , as is expected .",
    "we therefore decided to adopt a calibration based on the color of the red - clump ( as before ) , but fixing , instead , the magnitude of the red - clump at @xmath28 , also from the photometry by stetson ( 1997 , his figure  7 ) .    in figures",
    "[ posepoch ] and  [ vpd ] we show , respectively , the barycentric position _ vs. _ epoch and the vector - point diagrams for our five fields , for the final lrs stars and the corresponding background qso .",
    "after processing all of the qso fields following the protocols described in the previous paragraphs , we computed pms for the five qso fields presented in the upper part of table  [ tbl1 ] .",
    "the results are summarized in table  [ tbl4 ] , and are plotted in figure  [ pmind ] .",
    "table  [ tbl4 ] gives the pm in ra and dec as well as the overall rms of the linear fit of the barycentric coordinates _",
    "vs. _ epoch .",
    "we recall that the slope of this linear fit gives us the pm of the fornax stars with respect to the qso , as explained in paper  i. figure  [ pmind ] clearly shows that our five measurements scatter more widely than would be expected from their error bars , and therefore computing a weighted mean does not seem appropriate for these data . instead , and not knowing the source of the additional uncertainty affecting our proper motion measurements , we opted for computing an unweighted mean over the resulting values for all five qso fields . from table  [ tbl4 ] we thus arrive at the following values for the pm of the fornax dsph galaxy ( and the standard deviation of the mean ) : @xmath29  @xmath1 , and @xmath30  @xmath1 .",
    "only two astrometric determinations of the pm for the fornax dsph galaxy are available , namely that by @xcite , based on a combination of ground - based plates and hubble - wfpc data , and that based exclusively on hst data by piatek et al .",
    "( 2007 , hereafter pi07 ) , who present revised values to those reported earlier ( pre - ccd charge transfer inefficieny corrections ) in @xcite .",
    "figure  [ pmind ] compares our results from individual qsos , to those obtained by pi07 .",
    "we have three qso fields in common with pi07 ; their values , along with our measurements , are given in table  [ tbl5 ] . from this table",
    "we see that the difference of the mean pms derived from the qsos in common between these two studies is less than @xmath31 of our error in the mean in both , ra and dec . on the other hand ,",
    "the overall weighted mean value reported by pi07 , based on 4 qsos ( their table  3 ) of @xmath32  @xmath1 , and @xmath33  @xmath1 differs by about @xmath31 from our overall unweighted - mean pm values .",
    "even though our results are not statistically inconsistent with those of pi07 , it is apparent from figure  [ pmind ] that our individual results do exhibit a much larger scatter than their results ( @xmath34  @xmath1 and @xmath35  @xmath1 vs. @xmath36  @xmath1 and @xmath37  @xmath1 for pi07 ) .",
    "we have no explanation for these differences .",
    "the pm values published so far , along with our own value are given in table  [ tbl6 ] .",
    "more recently , @xcite have used a non - astrometric method called `` perspective rotation '' which is also included in the table ( for details about this method see paper  i ) , because it provides a completely independent measurement of the tranverse motion of fornax ( albeit with a larger error than the more recent astrometric determinations ) .",
    "all of these values are plotted , for comparison , in figure  [ pmwei ] . from the plot and figure",
    "we can see that , in general , there is a good agreement between all measurements ; indeed , none of them depart by more than @xmath38 from the straight average of the values in table  [ tbl6 ] , with our result being however the most extreme in this sense . also , averaging the results from all of the authors , we find that the pm in dec shows a larger scatter ( @xmath39  @xmath1 ) than that in ra ( @xmath40  @xmath1 ) .",
    "this would suggest that ( some of ) these measurements are affected by unaccounted systematic effects .",
    "of the obvious culprits , we can mention that ground - based astrometric data are affected by dcr . in the case of fornax data ( dec@xmath41 ) acquired from the southern hemisphere ,",
    "dcr should however mostly affect ra pms ( we stress that our data have been corrected for this effect as far as possible , see paper  i ) .    on the other hand , hst data ,",
    "while not affected by dcr , can be affected by `` charge transfer inefficiency '' ( cti ) in the ccd detectors due to the very low sky background which is insufficient to fill - in the empty charge traps on the detector .",
    "these traps evolve in time because they are produced by in - flight radiation damage , and induce systematic ( time dependent ) position shifts in the detected sources ( for details see , e.g. , @xcite , especially his figure  10 ) .",
    "hst data has also been corrected for this effect , again , as best as they could ( compare , e.g. , table  3 from @xcite ( cti - uncorrected ) and pi07 ( cti - corrected ) ) .",
    "we note however that , since the hst cameras were not oriented exactly along dec in the parallel readout direction , which is the direction mostly affected by cti ( see , e.g. , figures  2 , 3 and  4 in pi07 ) , it is difficult to ascribe the dec scatter to this problem .",
    "also , as mentioned previously , hst data shows a much smaller intrinsic scatter than our measurements ( figure  [ pmind ] ) , thus suggesting small remaining systematics due to cti .",
    "one of the ultimate goals of these studies is a determination of a reliable orbit for fornax .",
    "it is interesting to compare the impact of the different values given in table  [ tbl6 ] on the kinematical and orbital parameters that can be derived from these measurements .",
    "table  [ tbl7 ] gives the heliocentric pms and the corresponding tangential velocities in galactic coordinates for the different values reported in table  [ tbl6 ] . from this table , it is clear that our pm value will render one of the most energetic orbits yet derived for fornax .    for illustration purposes , and also as a key ingredient to compute and interpret the orbit of fornax from the above motions in galactic coordinates , we have computed velocities in the heliocentric ( hc ) and galactocentric ( gc ) reference systems . for a detailed description of these various reference systems , and the equations relating them , the reader is referred to @xcite .",
    "they are shown in table  [ tbl8 ] , along with model - independent kinematical and orbital parameters derived from the pm values taken from different studies .",
    "given the large values of @xmath42 in comparison with the @xmath43 derived from all pm measurements , it is clear that fornax must be close to perigalaticon at this time . also , given the rather small ratio of @xmath44 it is clear that there must be significant excursions of fornax away from the galactic plane , regardless of the adopted pm values .",
    "we note again that , of all measurements available , our pm measurement yields the most extreme orbit .",
    "we have computed galactic orbits for fornax by integrating back in time the equation of motion under a realistic three - component ( disk , halo and spheroid ) model galactic potential @xcite , and using the current position and velocity ( and their uncertainties , in a monte carlo scheme ) as initial conditions .",
    "details of the integrator , and the monte carlo simulations , are discussed in @xcite .",
    "a particularly important feature of the integrator used is its care to conserve energy and total angular momentum , obvious features that are howevever sometimes tricky to achieve over the full orbit , particularly when the number of integration steps ( @xmath3several thousands in our case ) is large .",
    "the adopted gravitational potential is strictly axi - symmetric , and it does not include the galactic bar , nor the mw spiral pattern .",
    "recent numerical simulations by @xcite , that include these non axi - symmetric components , indicate however that their effect , in particular in the orbits of galactic globular clusters ( and therefore also in the case of the more external satellite galaxies ) , is minimal , and it should not alter our conclusions importantly .",
    "the results of these integrations are shown in table  [ tbl9 ] and in figure  [ xyz ] . in table",
    "[ tbl9 ] the meaning of the different columns is rather obvious , except perhaps for the last two columns that correspond to the crossing ( vertical ) velocity of fornax through the galactic plane ( @xmath45 ) and the total speed at perigalacticon ( @xmath46 ) . as it can be seen , regardless of what pm values one adopts , comparing the @xmath46 values to the @xmath42 in table  [ tbl8 ] confirms that the current fornax position lies indeed near perigalacticon ( see also figure  [ dgct ] , top panel ) .",
    "actually , all pms indicate that the minimum distance , projected into the galactic plane , happened 200 to 300  myr ago ( figure  [ dgct ] , bottom panel ) .",
    "this is a very interesting quantity , because @xcite have found evidence of at least three distinct stellar components in fornax : a young population ( few 100  myr old ) concentrated in the centre of the galaxy , visible as a main sequence in the cmd ; an intermediate age population ( 2 - 8  gyr old , possibly related to a shell structure in fornax , described in the next paragraph ) ; and an ancient population ( @xmath47  gyr ) .",
    "more recently , @xcite have also found ( see , e.g. , their figure  2 ) evidence of enhanced star formation in the range 200 - 300  myr .",
    "one could therefore conclude that the latest episode of star formation on fornax may have been indeed triggered by its perigalacticon passage .    when tracing the galaxy back in time , the uncertainty in the computed position increases as time goes on , for a given uncertainty in the initial conditions , and , as we extrapolate further back in time , different pm values lead to quite different orbits .",
    "this is clearly shown in figure  [ dgct ] , which shows the distance of fornax from the galactic center ( @xmath48 , top panel ) and the same distance projected onto the galactic plane ( @xmath49 , bottom panel ) as a function of time from now .",
    "initially all pm values produce a similar @xmath48 , @xmath49 _ vs. _ time , but the solutions diverge afterwards . as mentioned before",
    ", our value renders the most extreme solution , basically indicating that in a hubble time fornax has not completed an orbit yet .",
    "this is at odds with all of the other solutions which , while being different among themselves , do indicate nevertheless several perigalacticon passages in the last 10  gyr .",
    "if , as argued before , perigalacticon has had an influence on enhancing star formation , the stellar population results by @xcite favour a rather long orbital period , thus supporting our solution .",
    "we note here that the 2  gyr population belonging to the shell structure found by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite has been interpreted by these authors as the product of a merger with a smaller , gas - rich system , and may not bear any relation to the interaction between fornax and the mw .",
    "we are thus seemingly left with two significant star formation episodes , one at ( 200 - 300  myr ) , close to perigalacticon , and another one at age  @xmath47  gyr , which again argues for a longer orbital period ( interestingly , from figure  [ dgct ] we see that @xmath50  gyr mark the most recent apogalactic position for fornax for the pi07 and @xcite orbits ) .",
    "our extended orbit implies that fornax would belong to one of the `` hypervelocity '' satellites of the mw , as argued by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ( results all based on the same hst data set ) .",
    "one could perhaps wonder that the late infall nature of fornax s orbits ( assuming our pms ) is possibly related to the fact that it is the only satellite dwarf galaxy of the mw ( mateo 1998 ) , along with the spatially dissipated sagittarius dwarf ( law & majewski 2010 ) , that harbour a globular cluster population .    a final word of caution regarding the above discussion is that",
    ", from table  [ tbl9 ] , we see that current pm measurements for fornax implies that the range of derived orbital parameters is quite broad , and it seems adventurous to extract strong conclusions from them . as already mentioned , of particular concern is the possible existence of yet unaccounted systematic effects in the pm measurements .",
    "only high - accuracy future astrometric satellite measurements , like gaia , with expected uncertainties of a few @xmath51arc - sec ( average over many stars ) could help resolve this issue .",
