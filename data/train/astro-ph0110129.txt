    "since the demise of the comptel instrument on cgro , the medium energy gamma - ray region of the spectrum ( 0.450 mev ) has been left unattended and will not be adequately covered by currently - planned missions .",
    "while the integral mission ( 2002 ) will provide pointed observations of line and continuum sources up to 10 mev and the agile ( @xmath0 ) and glast ( @xmath1 ) missions promise great advances at energies above 100 mev , an advanced compton telescope ( act ) mission , with all - sky survey capabilities and a narrow line sensitivity of @xmath2 photons @xmath3 s@xmath4 ( a factor of 100 better than comptel ) , lies at least a decade in the future .",
    "figure  [ fig - goal ] shows the sensitivities of past and planned gamma - ray missions .",
    "it is obvious that , at high energies , technological advances have produced three `` generations '' of instruments ( cos - b , egret , and glast ) , each with a factor of @xmath5 improvement in sensitivity . in a similar fashion , using technology that is available today , a second - generation medium energy mission could provide an intermediate step toward act and improve the sensitivity of comptel by a factor of 10 ( indicated by the dashed line in figure  [ fig - goal ] ) .",
    "beginning this project now would allow a launch in @xmath1 and permit simultaneous observations with glast ; such broadband spectral coverage was shown by cgro to be invaluable .",
    "the medium energy gamma - ray astronomy ( mega ) project at mpe aims to provide this intermediate step .",
    "the medium energy gamma - ray band is of particular importance for a wide variety of important high - energy astrophysical problems , specifically those involving nuclear , non - thermal , and relativistic processes . the production of elements in massive stars and supernovae results in unstable isotopes , such as @xmath6al and @xmath7ti , that produce radioactive decay lines in the mev range .",
    "compact objects , including black hole binaries and gamma - ray pulsars , possess doppler - shifted nuclear de - excitation lines as well as continuum spectral slopes , breaks , and cutoffs in the gamma - ray band that are characteristic of relativistic particle acceleration and are highly variable . outside the galaxy , active galactic nuclei ( agn )",
    "are prodigious producers of gamma - rays , some especially so in the mev range .",
    "these sources are also highly variable , and therefore must be monitored constantly .",
    "continuous monitoring is also needed to study gamma - ray bursts , which produce the bulk of their energy around 1 mev .",
    "in addition to such discrete sources , both galactic and extra - galactic diffuse gamma - ray emission exists as well . the former arises from both cosmic - ray interactions in the interstellar medium and radioactive material ejected from supernovae ; the latter is likely the superposition of distant agn",
    ". the combined instruments of cgro provided a first taste of all these phenomena , but many were only marginally detected .",
    "for example , @xmath8co line emission from sn1991 t , the only supernova type ia possibly seen in gamma - rays , was detected by comptel at the 34 @xmath9 level ( morris et al .",
    "1998 ) , and about half of the 10 `` mev blazars '' are also seen near comptel s detection threshold . larger samples with higher significance of all these phenomena , together with continuous monitoring ,",
    "are needed to learn more .",
    "achieving the desired improvment in sensitivity for an instrument with good imaging and spectroscopy abilities in the mev range is a difficult task . at these energies",
    "the overall interaction cross section goes through a minimum , and the primary photon interaction produces long - range secondary photons and/or electrons . at about 8 mev ( in silicon , for example ) the most likely interaction changes from compton scattering to pair production . in order to make full use of all interacting photons one",
    "then requires both sufficient material depth to achieve high detection efficiency and good spatial and energy resolution to track the secondary particles .",
    "solutions to this problem that are available with today s technology include xenon time projection chambers ( aprile et al .",
    "2000 ) , stacks of germanium detectors ( boggs & jean 2000 ) , and combinations of solid - state detectors and scintillators ( oneill et al .",
    "2000 ) .    the basic mega telescope design in shown in figure  [ fig - principle ] .",
    "it consists of a _",
    "tracker _ , in which the primary compton scatter or pair creation event takes place , and a _ calorimeter _ , which absorbs and measures the secondary particles .",
    "the tracker contains 32 layers of double - sided si strip detectors ( @xmath10 wafers of 6 cm @xmath11 6 cm each , 500 @xmath12 m thick , with a pitch of 470 @xmath12 m ) .",
    "the tracker is enclosed on five sides by the calorimeter , made of csi cells ( 5 mm @xmath11 5 mm cross section , 8 cm long on the bottom , 4 cm long on the sides ) read out by si pin diodes . for",
    "incident photon energies above @xmath13 mev the compton recoil electron in most events receives enough energy to be tracked through multiple silicon layers ; the origin of the photon can then be constrained to lie on only a small segment of the standard compton event circle ( `` reduced event circle '' in figure  [ fig - principle ] ) , reducing background in crowded fields .",
    "electron - positron pairs may be similarly tracked .",
    "the locations and energy deposits of all interactions may be analyzed to reconstruct a most likely sequence for each event , which leads to very efficient suppression of background events .",
    "the entire mega assembly is further surrounded by a plastic anticoincidence shield .",
    "simulations based on the mega prototype ( see section  [ sec - prototype ] ) using geant3 indicate an effective area of about 100 @xmath14 at 2 mev for the full mega telescope , with an angular resolution of @xmath15 fwhm and an energy resolution of @xmath16% fwhm at 2 mev .",
    "the field of view is quite large , @xmath17 fwhm , allowing all - sky survey operations .",
    "replacing the pin diodes in the calorimeter with low - noise silicon drift diodes could improve the angular resolution to @xmath18 and the energy resolution to @xmath19% .",
    "an exciting prospect for an instument based on compton scattering through large angles is high sensitivity to polarization .",
    "our calculations indicate that mega should be sensitive to polarization levels of @xmath20% for energies less than 1 mev from a crab - like source after 100 hours of observation .",
    "the baseline mega experiment has been considered in a pre - phase a study for a small satellite mission . based on this study , the detector will have a mass of @xmath21 kg and dimensions of 1.3 m diameter by 1.1 m length .",
    "placed on a standard small satellite platform , the launch payload mass is about 950 kg with a diameter of 2 m and a length of 2.4 m. the electrical power requirement is @xmath22 w , and the average telemetry rate 50 kbit s@xmath4 .",
    "the development time of mega to launch would be about 5.5 years , after which a mission lifetime of 35 years is forseen .",
    "this would allow considerable overlap with the glast mission , a highly desirable goal that should be pursued if at all possible .",
    "mega would be placed in a low earth orbit ( 500 - 550 km ) in as low an inclination as possible in order to provide a low - background environment .",
    "mega would be operated in a zenith - pointing mode , performing a continuous all - sky survey .",
    "the wide field of view provides a nearly complete scan with each orbit and allows the constant monitoring of variable sources .",
    "real - time satellite telemetry is planned through the tdrss demand access system .",
    "the data will be analyzed promptly for bursts and transients , and appropriate alert messages will be sent to initiate follow - up observations .",
    "the survey sensitivity of mega has been derived from simulations by calculating the relative number of source and background counts falling within a circular area on the sky with width @xmath23 of the angular resolution .",
    "figure  [ fig - sens ] shows the results for continuum and narrow line sources .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^ , > \" , ]     the mega in - orbit background was assumed to be equivalent to 3 times the in - flight spectrum recorded by comptel at 5 gv cutoff rigidity , including events that appear as gamma - rays but are in fact caused by local background ( concentrated in a bump in the nuclear line region of 18 mev ) .",
    "this background assumption will have to be checked carefully once the instrument and satellite mass model and orbit have been precisely defined .",
    "a preliminary estimate of the number of sources detectable by mega in a 3-year survey predicts that , within the galaxy , about 100 unidentified egret sources should be seen .",
    "the number of pulsars observed at mev energies should grow to about 10 , and about a dozen black hole binaries like cyg x-1 should be detected .",
    "although exact numbers are highly model - dependent , we also expect to discover several young supernova remnants through their @xmath7ti line emission , while a few novae should be detectable through their lines each year . outside the galaxy ,",
    "about 100 blazars and more than 10 radio and seyfert galaxies should be visible .",
    "a gamma - ray burst will occur and be imaged in the large field of view of mega every @xmath24 days .",
    "we should also see 23 supernovae per year .",
    "far more detailed mapping of the spatial and spectral distribution of diffuse emission , both lines and continuum , will be possible than was the case with comptel .",
    "thus much larger samples will be available of all medium energy gamma - ray astronomical objects , allowing the first glimpse provided by cgro to be expanded and explored .",
    "the tantalizing marginal results of comptel will be unambiguously confirmed or denied , and science beyond mere detection will be possible .",
    "a prototype of the mega telescope has been constructed in the laboratory at mpe , and is shown in figure  [ fig - proto ] .",
    "the prototype tracker has 10 layers of @xmath25 si wafers each , and the calorimeter will comprise 20 modules of csi detectors , each with a 10 @xmath11 12 array of crystals either 2 cm , 4 cm , or 8 cm deep ( schopper et al . 2000 ) .",
    "the 8 cm crystals have pin diodes on both ends , which allows the depth of the photon interaction to be determined by the ratio of output light .",
    "both the tracker and calorimeter detectors are read out by identical front - end asic chips ( ta1.1 chip by ide , self - triggering with 128 channels ) , custom - made front - end control units , and laboratory vme and nim electronics .",
    "the individual detector units must be calibrated individually using laboratory radioactive sources , and then the entire telescope may be tested using higher energy sources and a coincident trigger .",
    "each recorded event is reconstructed according to the most likely sequence of interactions in the tracker ( electrons ) and calorimeter ( scattered photons ) .",
    "images are reconstructed using a list - mode maximum - likelihood expectation - maximization method adapted from wilderman et al .",
    "figure  [ fig - image ] shows an image of a @xmath26y source ( 1.836 mev ) , located @xmath27 cm from the detector , constructed using only those events which produced tracks in the silicon layers .",
    "only eight calorimeter modules were in place for this measurement .",
    "these results prove that the mega concept is viable and that the detector technology and data analysis techniques are presently available to construct a next - generation gamma - ray telescope .    in february 2002",
    "the mega prototype will be taken to duke university s high intensity gamma - ray source for calibration measurements .",
    "this facility produces a gamma - ray beam with tunable energy between 2 mev and 55 mev using compton back - scattering of uv laser photons in an electron storage ring .",
    "the beam is highly polarized , providing an additional , valuable test of mega s sensitivity as a polarimeter . in june 2002",
    "we plan to fly the mega prototype on a cnes balloon flight from gap , france ( in collaboration with cesr ) to measure background and test detector performance under flight conditions .",
    "if all goes well , the mega concept will have proven itself suitable for a space mission ."
