    "the origin of high - energy cosmic rays is one of the open questions in astroparticle physics .",
    "the fully ionized atomic nuclei reach the earth from outside the solar system with energies from the gev range up to @xmath0  ev . most of them are assumed to originate in the milky way . at the highest energies , exceeding @xmath1  ev , the particles are usually considered of extragalactic origin .",
    "this review focuses on galactic cosmic rays . to distinguish between different models of the cosmic - ray origin requires detailed measurements of the energy spectrum , mass composition , and arrival direction of charged cosmic rays .",
    "additional and complementary information is obtained through the measurements of high - energy photons up to tev energies .",
    "this review starts with a short overview on detection methods typically applied to measure the composition of cosmic rays on satellites , balloons , and at ground level ( ) .",
    "the propagation of cosmic rays through the galaxy is in the focus of .",
    "recent progress concerning the sources and acceleration of the high - energy particles is described in .",
    "one of the headstones in understanding the origin of galactic cosmic rays is to know the reasons for the knee in the energy spectrum . in recent measurements of the all - particle energy spectrum , the mean mass , and spectra for individual elements",
    "are compiled and their impact on the contemporary knowledge of the origin of galactic cosmic rays is discussed .",
    "the end of the galactic cosmic - ray spectrum and the transition to an extragalactic component is briefly illuminated in .",
    "the energies of cosmic rays extend from the gev domain up to @xmath0  ev . within this range",
    "the particle flux decreases by about 30 orders of magnitude .",
    "this has implications on the accuracy to determine the mass composition of cosmic rays . at low energies",
    "the flux is large enough to build sophisticated detectors with an active area of a few 100  @xmath2 to measure the abundance of individual isotopes . on the other hand , at the highest energies , where only a few particles are expected per km@xmath3 and century , huge ground based installations are necessary to measure secondary products generated by cosmic rays in the atmosphere and the ( average ) mass",
    "can be estimated coarsely only .",
    "the situation is sketched figuratively in .    at energies in the mev range sophisticated silicon detectors , operated in outer space , like",
    "the ulysses het @xcite or the ace / cris ( 0.025  m@xmath3sr ) @xcite experiments can identify individual isotopes , fully characterized by simultaneous measurements of their energy , charge , and mass @xmath4 .",
    "since the particles have to be absorbed completely in a silicon detector this technique works up to energies of a few gev only .    in the gev domain particles",
    "are registered with magnetic spectrometers on stratospheric balloons , like the bess instrument @xcite .",
    "they are the only detectors discussed here which are able to identify the sign of the particles charge .",
    "all other detectors rely on the fact that the specific ionization loss is @xmath5 , thus @xmath6 is derived from the measurements .",
    "magnet spectrometers are the only detectors suitable to distinguish between matter and antimatter as e.g. @xmath7 , @xmath8 , or @xmath9 .",
    "the particle momentum is derived from the curvature of the trajectory in a magnetic field , which limits the usage of these detectors to energies approaching the tev scale .    at higher energies particles",
    "are measured with balloon borne instruments on circumpolar long duration flights @xcite .",
    "individual elements are identified , characterized by their charge and energy .",
    "@xmath6 is determined through @xmath10 measurements .",
    "experimentally most challenging is the energy measurement . in calorimeters",
    "the particles need to be ( at least partly ) absorbed .",
    "the weight of a detector with a thickness of one hadronic interaction length ( ) and an area of 1  m@xmath3 amounts to about 1  t. due to weight limitations actual detectors like atic @xcite or cream @xcite have to find an optimum between detector aperture and energy resolution , resulting in relatively thin detectors with a thickness of 1.7  ( atic ) or 0.7  ( cream ) only .",
    "the measurement of transition radiation from cosmic - ray particles allows to build large detectors with reasonable weight .",
    "the largest cosmic - ray detector ever flown on a balloon , the tracer experiment @xcite has an aperture of 5  m@xmath3sr . during a long duration balloon flight over antarctica @xcite and another flight from sweden to alaska @xcite , up to now an exposure of 70",
    "m@xmath3srd has been reached with this experiment . with such exposures",
    "the energy spectra for individual elements can be extended to energies exceeding @xmath11  ev .    to access higher energies very large exposures are necessary . at present",
    "reached only in ground based experiments , registering extensive air showers . in the tev regime ( small )",
    "air showers are observed with imaging telescopes such as the hegra @xcite , hess @xcite , magic @xcite , or veritas @xcite experiments .",
    "these instruments image the trajectory of an air shower in the sky with large mirrors onto a segmented camera .    for primary particles with energies exceeding @xmath11  ev",
    "the particle cascades generated in the atmosphere are large enough to reach ground level , where the debris of the cascade is registered in large arrays of particle detectors .",
    "two types of experiments may be distinguished : installations measuring the longitudinal development of showers ( or the depth of the shower maximum ) in the atmosphere and apparatus measuring the density ( and energy ) of secondary particles at ground level .",
    "the depth of the shower maximum is measured in two ways .",
    "light - integrating detectors like the blanca @xcite or tunka @xcite experiments are in principle arrays of photomultiplier tubes with light collection cones looking upwards in the night sky , measuring the lateral distribution of light at ground level .",
    "the depth of the shower maximum and the shower energy is derived from these observations .",
    "imaging telescopes as in the hires @xcite or auger @xcite experiments observe an image of the shower on the sky through measurement of fluorescence light , emitted by nitrogen molecules , which had been excited by air shower particles .",
    "these experiments rely on the fact that the depth of the shower maximum for a primary particle with mass @xmath12 relates to the depth of the maximum for proton induced showers as @xmath13 where @xmath14  2 is the radiation length in air @xcite .",
    "an example for an air shower array is the kascade - grande experiment @xcite , covering an area of 0.5  km@xmath3 .",
    "the basic idea is to measure the electromagnetic component in an array of unshielded scintillation detectors and the muons in scintillation counters shielded by a lead and iron absorber , while the hadronic component is measured in a large calorimeter @xcite .",
    "the total number of particles at observation level is obtained through the measurement of particle densities and the integration of the lateral density distribution @xcite .",
    "the direction of air showers is reconstructed through the measurement of the arrival time of the shower particles in the individual detectors . measuring the electron - to - muon ratio in showers ,",
    "the mass of the primary can be inferred . a heitler model of hadronic showers @xcite yields the relation @xmath15    this illustrates the sensitivity of air shower experiments to @xmath16 .",
    "to measure the composition with a resolution of 1 unit in @xmath16 the shower maximum has to be measured to an accuracy of about 37  2 ( see ) or the @xmath17 ratio has to be determined with an relative error around 16% ( see ) . due to the large intrinsic fluctuations in air showers , with existing experiments at most groups of elements",
    "can be reconstructed with @xmath18 .",
    "the exposure achieved by several experiments is shown in .",
    "the integral cosmic - ray flux roughly depends on energy as @xmath19 .",
    "hence , the grey lines ( @xmath19 ) serve to compare the exposure of detectors in different energy regimes .",
    "it can be recognized that the different experiments , despite of their huge differences in physical size , ranging from the @xmath20  @xmath2 cris space experiment to the @xmath21  km@xmath3 auger air shower experiment , have about equal effective sizes when the decreasing cosmic - ray flux is taken into account .",
    "the propagation of cosmic rays in the galaxy can be described quantitatively , taking into account energy loss , nuclear interactions , radioactive decay , spallation production , and production by radioactive decay , using the equation @xcite @xmath22 @xmath23 is the flux of species @xmath24 after propagating through an amount of matter @xmath25 @xmath262@xmath27 $ ] subject to the reduction of @xmath28 , that represents the source term .",
    "the other parameters are : @xmath10 , the rate of ionization energy loss ; @xmath29 , the total inelastic cross section for species @xmath24 ; @xmath30 , the mean lifetime at rest for radioactive decay for species @xmath24 ; @xmath31 , the cross section for production of species @xmath24 from fragmentation of species @xmath32 ; @xmath33 , the mean lifetime at rest for decay of species @xmath32 into species @xmath24 ; @xmath34 , avogadro s number ; @xmath35 , the mean atomic weight of the interstellar gas ; and @xmath36 , the lorentz factor .",
    "the exact spatial distribution of the matter traversed becomes important only when considering radioactive isotopes , since the distance traversed in a time @xmath37 is @xmath38 .",
    "abundances of stable secondary nuclei ( produced during propagation ) indicate the average amount of interstellar medium traversed during propagation before escape . because secondary radioactive cosmic - ray species will be created and decay only during transport , their steady - state abundances are sensitive to the confinement time if their mean lifetimes are comparable or shorter than this time .    at low energies around 1  gev / n",
    "the abundance of individual elements in cosmic rays has been measured .",
    "a compilation of data from various experiments is presented in .",
    "the data are compared to the abundance in the solar system .",
    "overall , a good agreement between cosmic rays and solar system matter can be stated . however , there are distinguished differences as well , giving hints to the acceleration and propagation processes of cosmic rays .",
    "the elements lithium , beryllium , and boron , the elements below iron ( @xmath39 ) , and the elements below the lead group ( @xmath40 ) are significantly more abundant in cosmic rays as compared to the solar system composition ( ) . this is attributed to the fact , that these elements are produced in spallation processes of heavier elements ( fourth term in ) during the propagation through the galaxy .    measured ratios of secondary to primary nuclei , namely boron / carbon and ( scandium+vanadium)/iron , are shown in @xcite .",
    "these ratios can be used to estimate the matter traversed by cosmic rays in the galaxy @xcite .",
    "the data can be successfully described using a leaky box model , assuming the escape path length for particles with rigidity @xmath41 and velocity @xmath42 as @xmath43 with @xmath44 @xcite .",
    "the lines in correspond to this function with a path length at 2  gev / n around 13  2 decreasing to @xmath45  2 at 100  gev / n .    however , at high energies a path length according to decreases as @xmath46 and reaches extremely small values .",
    "they should result in large anisotropies of the arrival direction of cosmic rays , not observed by experiments @xcite . to sustain a suitable path length at high energies",
    "a residual path length model has been proposed , assuming the relation @xmath47 $ ]  2 for the escape path length @xcite .",
    "recent measurements of the tracer experiment yield an upper limit for the constant term of 0.15  2 @xcite .",
    "the spallation processes during the cosmic - ray propagation influence also the shape of the spectra . usually , it is assumed , that the energy spectra of all elements have the same slope , i.e. the same spectral index at the source .",
    "taking the energy dependence of the spallation cross sections and the pathlength of the particles in the galaxy into account , it is found that at earth the spectra of heavy nuclei should be flatter as compared to light elements @xcite .",
    "for example , the spectral index for iron nuclei should be about 0.13 smaller than the corresponding value for protons .",
    "indeed , direct measurements indicate that the spectra of heavy elements are flatter as compared to light elements @xcite , e.g. the values for protons @xmath48 and iron @xmath49 differ as expected .",
    "this effect could be of importance for the propagation of ultra - heavy nuclei and their possible contribution to the all - particle spectrum to explain the second knee around 400  pev @xcite .    during the propagation",
    "also radioactive secondary nuclei are produced ( fifth term in ) .",
    "their abundance can be used to estimate the spatial distribution of the matter traversed or the cosmic - ray confinement time in the galaxy if the half - life time is comparable to the confinement time @xcite .",
    "measuring the abundance of the isotopes @xmath50be ( @xmath51  yr ) , @xmath52al ( @xmath53  yr ) , @xmath54cl ( @xmath55  yr ) , and @xmath56 mg ( @xmath57  yr ) with the acre / cris experiment , the propagation time in the galaxy has been determined to be @xmath58  yr @xcite .    in the leaky box model , the product @xmath59 is proportional to the escape path length @xmath60 .",
    "knowing @xmath61 and @xmath62 , thus allows to determine the average density of the interstellar matter .",
    "measurements of the cris experiment yield an average hydrogen number density in the interstellar matter @xmath63 h atoms/@xmath64 .",
    "a comparison to the average density in the galactic disc @xmath65/@xmath64 indicates that cosmic rays spend most of their propagation time outside the galactic disc , diffusing in the galactic halo .",
    "the height of the diffusion region into the halo has been estimated by @xcite with measurements of the @xmath50be/@xmath66be - ratio by the isomax experiment to be a few ( @xmath67  kpc ) .",
    "direct evidence of cosmic rays propagating in the galactic halo is obtained from the observation of the diffuse @xmath36-ray background , extending well above the disc , by the egret experiment @xcite .",
    "the @xmath36-ray energy spectrum exhibits a structure in the gev region , which is interpreted as indication for the interaction of propagating cosmic rays with interstellar matter ( cr+ism@xmath68 ) @xcite .    at energies in the air shower domain measurements of the boron - to - carbon ratio ( or other ratios of secondary to primary elements )",
    "are not feasible any more .",
    "however , in this energy region propagation models can be constrained by information about the arrival direction of cosmic rays .",
    "an anisotropy is expected due to the motion of the observer ( at the earth ) relative to the cosmic - ray gas , known as the compton getting effect @xcite .",
    "such an anisotropy , caused by the orbital motion of the earth around the sun has been observed for cosmic rays with energies of a few tev @xcite .",
    "the super - kamiokande experiment investigated large - scale anisotropies in the arrival direction of cosmic rays with energies around 10  tev @xcite .",
    "a @xmath69 excess ( `` taurus excess '' ) is found with an amplitude of @xmath70 at right ascension @xmath71 and declination @xmath72 . on the other hand ,",
    "a deficit ( `` virgo deficit '' ) is found with an amplitude of @xmath73 at @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "the anisotropy observed is compatible with a compton getting effect caused by a velocity of about 50  km / s relative to the rest frame . this velocity is smaller than the rotation speed of the solar system around the galactic center ( @xmath76  km / s ) .",
    "this implies that the rest frame of cosmic rays ( presumably the galactic magnetic fields ) is corotating with the galaxy .",
    "the tibet experiment reports anisotropies in the same regions on the sky @xcite . for energies below 12  tev",
    "the large - scale anisotropies show little dependence on energy , whereas above this energy anisotropies fade away , consistent with measurements of the kascade experiment in the energy range from 0.7 to 6  pev @xcite .",
    "a compton getting effect caused by the orbital motion of the solar system around the galactic center would cause an excess at @xmath77 , @xmath78 and a minimum at @xmath79 , @xmath80 with an amplitude of 0.35% .",
    "however , the measurements at 300  tev yield an anisotropy amplitude of @xmath81 , consistent with an isotropic cosmic - ray intensity .",
    "hence , a galactic compton getting effect can be excluded with a confidence level of about @xmath82 .",
    "this implies , similar to the result of the super - kamiokande experiment , that galactic cosmic rays corotate with the local galactic magnetic field environment .",
    "upper limits of anisotropy amplitudes in the pev region are compatible with the anisotropies expected from diffusion models of cosmic - ray propagation in the galaxy , while leaky box models predict a too high level of anisotropy ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    ". in particular , a model by @xcite , based on an approach of @xcite , is well compatible with the measurements @xcite .",
    "the energy density of cosmic rays amounts to about @xmath83  ev/@xmath64 .",
    "this value is comparable to the energy density of the visible star light @xmath84",
    "ev/@xmath64 , the galactic magnetic fields @xmath85  ev/@xmath64 , or the microwave background @xmath86  ev/@xmath64 .",
    "the power required to sustain a constant cosmic - ray intensity can be estimated as @xmath87  erg / s , where @xmath62 is the residence time of cosmic rays in a volume @xmath88 ( the galaxy , or the galactic halo ) . with a rate of about three supernovae per century in a typical galaxy",
    "the energy required could be provided by a small fraction ( @xmath89 ) of the kinetic energy released in supernova explosions .",
    "this has been realized already by @xcite .",
    "the actual mechanism of acceleration remained mysterious until @xcite proposed a process that involved interaction of particles with large - scale magnetic fields in the galaxy . eventually , this lead to the currently accepted model of cosmic - ray acceleration by a first - order fermi mechanism that operates in strong shock fronts which are powered by the explosions and propagate from the supernova remnant ( snr ) into the interstellar medium @xcite .",
    "diffusive , first - order shock acceleration works by virtue of the fact that particles gain an amount of energy @xmath90 at each cycle , when a cycle consists of a particle passing from the upstream ( unshocked ) region to the downstream region and back . at each cycle",
    ", there is a probability that the particle is lost downstream and does not return to the shock .",
    "higher energy particles are those that remain longer in the vicinity of the shock and have enough time to achieve the high energy .",
    "after a time @xmath37 the maximum energy attained is @xmath91 , where @xmath92 is the velocity of the shock .",
    "this results in an upper limit , assuming a minimal diffusion length equal to the larmor radius of a particle of charge @xmath93 in the magnetic fields @xmath94 behind and ahead of the shock . using typical values of type ii supernovae exploding in an average interstellar medium yields @xmath95  tev @xcite .",
    "more recent estimates give a maximum energy up to one order of magnitude larger for some types of supernovae @xmath96  pev @xcite . as the maximum energy depends on the charge @xmath97 , heavier nuclei ( with larger @xmath97 ) can be accelerated to higher energies .",
    "this leads to consecutive cut - offs of the energy spectra for individual elements proportional to their charge @xmath97 , starting with the proton component .",
    "the overall similarity between cosmic rays and matter in the solar system , as already seen in , indicates that cosmic rays are `` regular matter '' , but accelerated to extreme energies .",
    "detailed information on the composition at the source can be obtained from measurements of the abundance of refractory nuclei .",
    "they appear to have undergone minimal elemental fractionation relative to one another during the propagation process .",
    "the derived abundance at the source is presented in versus the abundance in the solar system @xcite .",
    "the two samples exhibit an extreme similarity over a wide range .",
    "of the 18 nuclides included in this comparison , only @xmath98fe is found to have an abundance relative to @xmath99si that differs by more than a factor of 1.5 from the solar - system value . when uncertainties are taken into account ,",
    "all of the other abundances are consistent with being within 20% of the solar values .",
    "this indicates that cosmic rays are accelerated out of a sample of well mixed interstellar matter .",
    "the time between synthesis of cosmic - ray material and its acceleration to high energies has been estimated by measurements of the abundances of @xmath100ni and @xmath100co by the ace / cris experiment @xcite .",
    "these nucleides form a parent - daughter pair in a radioactive decay which can occur by electron capture only .",
    "this decay can not occur once the nuclei are accelerated to high energies and striped of their electrons .",
    "the measured abundances indicate that the decay of @xmath100ni to @xmath100co has occurred , leading to the conclusion that a time longer than the @xmath101  yr half - life time of @xmath100ni elapsed before the particles were accelerated .",
    "such long delays indicate the acceleration of old , stellar or interstellar material rather than fresh supernova ejecta . for cosmic - ray source material to have",
    "the composition of supernova ejecta would require that these ejecta not undergo significant mixing with normal interstellar gas before @xmath102  yr have elapsed",
    ".    ratios of individual cosmic - ray elemental abundances to the corresponding solar system abundances seem to be ordered by the first ionization potential ( fip ) of the elements . in the gev energy range elements with a fip below @xmath103  ev",
    "are about ten times more abundant in the cosmic - ray sources than are elements with a higher fip @xcite .",
    "it has also been found that the abundance ratios of galactic cosmic rays to the solar system values scale with the condensation temperature @xmath104 .",
    "refractory elements ( @xmath105  k ) are more abundant than volatile elements ( @xmath106  k ) . a model which could perhaps account for the fip effect would have a source ejecting its outer envelope for a long period with a fip selection effect ( as the sun does ) followed by a supernova shock which sweeps up and accelerates this material .",
    "it has been proposed that the fip effect is due to non - volatiles being accelerated as grains , while the volatiles are accelerated as individual nuclei @xcite .",
    "recent measurements of the tracer experiment allow to investigate these effect at higher energies , namely at 100  gev / n and 1000  gev / n @xcite .",
    "in the abundance at the cosmic - ray sources relative to the solar system abundances are shown as function of the first ionization potential and as function of condensation temperature . the decreasing ratio as function of fip and the increase as function of condensation temperature , known from lower energies ,",
    "is also pronounced at energies as high as 1000  gev / n , as can be inferred from the figure .",
    "the theory of acceleration of ( hadronic ) cosmic rays at shock fronts in supernova remnants , mentioned above , is strongly supported by recent measurements of the hess experiment @xcite , observing tev @xmath36-rays from the shell type supernova remnant rx j1713.7 - 3946 , originating from a core collapse supernova of type ii / ib . for the first time",
    ", a snr could be spatially resolved in @xmath36-rays and spectra have been derived directly at a potential cosmic - ray source .",
    "the measurements yield a spectral index @xmath107 for the observed @xmath36-ray flux .",
    "the photon energy spectrum of the supernova remnant rx j1713 is depicted in .",
    "measurements in various energy ranges ( atca at radio wavelengths , asca x - ray , egret gev @xmath36-ray , cangaroo and hess tev @xmath36-ray ) are compared to predictions of a model by @xcite .",
    "the solid line below @xmath108  ev indicates synchrotron emission from electrons ranging from radio frequencies to the x - ray regime .",
    "the observed synchrotron flux is used to adjust parameters in the model , which in turn , is used to predict the flux of tev @xmath36-rays .",
    "an important feature of the model is that efficient production of nuclear cosmic rays leads to strong modifications of the shock with large downstream magnetic fields ( @xmath109 g ) . due to this field amplification",
    "the electrons are accelerated to lower maximum energy and for the same radio / x - ray flux less electrons are needed .",
    "consequently , the inverse compton and bremsstrahlung fluxes are relatively low only .",
    "the solid line above @xmath108  ev reflects the spectra of decaying neutral pions , generated in interactions of accelerated hadrons with material in the vicinity of the source ( hadr + ism @xmath110 ) .",
    "this process is clearly dominant over electromagnetic emission generated by inverse compton effect and non - thermal bremsstrahlung , as can be inferred from the figure .",
    "the results are compatible with a nonlinear kinetic theory of cosmic - ray acceleration in supernova remnants and imply that this supernova remnant is an effective source of nuclear cosmic rays , where about 10% of the mechanical explosion energy are converted into nuclear cosmic rays @xcite . further quantitative evidence for the acceleration of hadrons in supernova remnants is provided by measurements of the hegra experiment @xcite of tev @xmath36-rays from the snr cassiopeia  a @xcite and by measurements of the hess experiment from the snr `` vela junior '' ( snr rx j0852.0 - 4622 ) @xcite .",
    "as discussed above , in the standard picture of galactic cosmic rays , it is assumed that the particles gain energy in supernova remnants and propagate diffusively through the galaxy ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the nuclei are accelerated up to a maximum energy , being proportional to their charge . during propagation",
    "some particles leak out of the galaxy and the leakage probability is a function of the nuclear charge as well .",
    "this implies that the energy spectra for individual elements should exhibit a break ( or knee structure ) at energies being proportional to the elemental charge .",
    "the situation is sketched in .",
    "the lines indicate energy spectra for groups of elements following power laws with a break proportional to @xmath97 . in the particular example",
    "the cut - off energy is assumed as @xmath111  pev , according to the poly - gonato model @xcite and a possible contribution of ultra - heavy elements ( @xmath112 ) is shown as well .",
    "summing up the fluxes of all elements yields the all - particle flux , indicated as `` galactic '' in the figure .",
    "the all - particle flux follows a power law with a spectral index @xmath113 up to about 4.5  pev and then exhibits a kink , the _ knee _ in the energy spectrum and continues with an index @xmath114 at higher energies .",
    "this scenario agrees well with the flux measured with detectors above the atmosphere and with air shower experiments , shown in the figure as well . in the measured spectrum some structures can be recognized , indicating small changes in the spectral index @xmath36 .",
    "the most important are the _ knee _ at @xmath115  pev , the _ second knee _ at @xmath116  pev@xmath117 , where the spectrum exhibits a second steepening to @xmath118 , and the _ ankle _ at about 4  eev , above this energy the spectrum seems to flatten again to @xmath113 . to understand the origin of these structures is expected to be a key element in understanding the origin of cosmic rays .",
    "various scenarios to explain the knee are proposed in the literature , for an overview see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "the most popular approaches ( maximum energy attained and leakage ) , just described above , are modeled with varying details , resulting in slightly different spectra .",
    "but , also other ideas are discussed , like the reacceleration of particles in the galactic wind , the interaction of cosmic - ray particles with dense photon fields in the vicinity of the sources , interactions with the neutrino background assuming massive neutrinos , the acceleration of particles in @xmath36-ray bursts , or hypothetical particle physics interactions in the atmosphere , transporting energy in unobserved channels , thus faking the knee feature .",
    "all scenarios result in spectra for individual elements with a break at energies being either proportional to the nuclear charge @xmath97 or to the nuclear mass @xmath12 which yield certain structures in the sum spectrum . to distinguish between the different models , measurements of the ( average ) mass of cosmic rays as function of energy",
    "are required , or  even better  the measurement of spectra of individual elements or at least elemental groups .",
    "frequently , the ratio of the number of electrons and muons is used to determine the mass composition , see .",
    "muons with an energy of several 100  mev to 1  gev are used by the experiments casa - mia @xcite , eas - top @xcite , grapes-3 @xcite , or kascade . to study systematic effects two hadronic interaction models",
    "are used to interpret the data measured with grapes-3 and kascade @xcite .",
    "high energy muons detected deep below rock or antarctic ice are utilized by the eas - top / macro @xcite and spase / amanda @xcite experiments .",
    "also , the correlation between the hadronic and muonic shower components has been investigated , e.g. by the kascade experiment @xcite .",
    "the production height of muons has been reconstructed by hegra / crt @xcite and kascade @xcite .    results from various experiments measuring electrons , muons , and hadrons at ground level are compiled in .",
    "the same experimental data are presented in the upper and lower graphs , where they are compared to different models . at low energies the values for the mean logarithmic mass",
    "are complemented by results from direct measurements . a clear increase of @xmath119 as function of energy can be recognized .",
    "however , individual experiments exhibit systematic differences of about @xmath120 unit .",
    "such fluctuations in @xmath119 are expected according to the simple estimate , assuming that the ratio of the electromagnetic and muonic shower components can be measured with an accuracy of the order of 16% .",
    "this uncertainty is a realistic value for the resolution of air shower arrays .",
    "of particular interest are the investigations of the kascade and grapes-3 experiments : interpreting the measured data with two different models for the interactions in the atmosphere results in a systematic difference in @xmath119 of about 0.7 to 1 .",
    "the experimental values in follow a trend predicted by the as indicated by the grey lines in the figure which implies that the increase of the average mass with energy is compatible with subsequent breaks in the energy spectra of individual elements , starting with the lightest species .",
    "the experimental values are compared to astrophysical models for the origin of the knee in the figure .",
    "the top panel shows models which explain the knee due to the maximum energy achieved during the acceleration process . in the lower panel predictions from propagation models ( including reacceleration during propagation )",
    "are compiled .",
    "details of the individual models will be discussed below . in general , all these predictions indicate an increase of the mean mass as function of energy very similar to the measured values .    another technique to determine the mass of cosmic rays is to measure the average depth of the shower maximum ( ) .",
