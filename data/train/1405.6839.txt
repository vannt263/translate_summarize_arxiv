    "in this note , i am going to address a rather classical problem of the low - temperature physics and the theory of bose - systems specifically .",
    "the excitation spectrum of a bose - liquid was an important element in the formulation of the theory of superfluidity of liquid helium-4 .",
    "phenomenologically formulated by landau @xcite , the spectrum was microscopically derived by bijl @xcite , bogoliubov @xcite , feynman and cohen . in the following decades , numerous works on this subject appeared , just to mention a few .",
    "experimental observation of the bogoliubov excitations in exciton  polariton bose - condensates was reported by utsunomiya _",
    "such systems @xcite constitute another group for probing bose - condensation , alongside dilute alkali gases .",
    "approaches based on the hamiltonian of an interacting bose - system by bogoliubov and zubarev were used by the present author to calculate the effective mass of the @xmath0he atom and the excitation spectrum of liquid helium-4 @xcite . in this work ,",
    "yet another method is proposed allowing for a proper treatment of the long - wavelength domain of the excitation spectrum .",
    "this approach is tested both for helium-4 with a self - consistently derived interatomic potential @xcite and for a bose - liquid with the yukawa potential .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : green ] contains all the required definitions of the hamiltonian and two - temperature green s functions , which are further applied in the calculations .",
    "decouplings for green s functions are suggested in section  [ sec : decoupling ] and general expressions for the excitation spectrum are obtained there .",
    "results of calculations for two systems ( liquid helium-4 and the yukawa bose - liquid ) are given in section  [ sec : results ] .",
    "a short discussion in section  [ sec : disc ] concludes the paper .",
    "let us consider the hamiltonian of a bose - system of @xmath1 particles in the volume @xmath2 interacting via pairwise @xmath3 and three - particle @xmath4 potentials [ eq : h ] h = - _ j=1^n _ j + _",

    "3(*r*_j,*r*_l,*r*_s ) , where @xmath5 is the mass of a particle and @xmath6 is the laplace operator with respect to the @xmath7th coordinate @xmath8 .",

    "hamiltonian ( [ eq : h ] ) becomes as follows : [ eq : hrho ] h & = & _ 0 + & & + _ + 0 , where @xmath9 is the free - particle energy , @xmath10 is the particle density , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the fourier transforms of the pairwise and three - particle potentials , respectively , and _",
    "k = _ k + n_3(,- ) -_0_3 ( , ) .    with operators @xmath13 and @xmath14 written in the heisenberg representation ,",
    "the two - time temperature green s functions are defined as @xcite = i(t - t ) , where @xmath15 is the heaviside step function and @xmath16 $ ] denotes the commutator .    in the case of @xmath17 ,",
    "the equations of motion in the frequency representation are given by = + , which upon simple transformations with eq .",
    "( [ eq : hrho ] ) leads to the following set : & & = -_k + 2_k + & & - _ + 0 , + [ -6pt ] [ eq : hwgreen ] + & & = + _ k + n_k + & & + _ + 0 .",
    "dropping off three - operator green s functions , i.e. in the random phase approximation ( rpa ) , one obtains the following expression for one of the solutions of set ( [ eq : hwgreen ] ) : = immediately yielding the bogoliubov spectrum from the poles of green s functions with respect to @xmath18 : [ eq : ekrpa ] e_k = _ k_k , _",
    "k=(1 + 2n_k/_k)^1/2",
    ".    while it is also possible to derive the equations of motion for three - operator functions as well , no closed - form expression for the excitation spectrum can be obtained with them .",
    "so , another option leading to easier calculations of the spectrum is considered in the next section .",
    "since green s functions of the @xmath19 type are used to calculate averages of triple products @xmath20 , the following decoupling can be used = ( 1,2)+(1,2 ) with [ eq : lambda_mu ] ( 1,2 ) = ( 1- ) , ( 1,2 ) = , where the value of the parameter @xmath21 will be fixed on a later stage .",
    "the following two approximation for averages were tested c_3a_1b_2_s = 16 ( ca_1cb_2ab_3 + ) with six items in the parentheses , hence the `` @xmath22 '' index , and c_3a_1b_2_f & = & 14with four items in the parentheses .    to decouple the functions entering eqs .",
    "( [ eq : hwgreen ] ) the following averages are required : _",

    "the calculations of the excitation spectrum were made for two bosonic systems .",
    "the first one is the liquid helium-4 and the second one is the yukawa bose - liquid with parameters corresponding to the nuclear matter . as data about the details of three - particle interactions in these systems are rather scarce , the contributions of @xmath12 are neglected .",
