    "recently , there has been a great deal of interest in ginsparg - wilson fermions  @xcite , because it is now realised that they allow the calculation of chirally symmetric physics without having any doubling problem  @xcite .",
    "we also know that because of its chiral properties the ginsparg - wilson fermion matrix is automatically an @xmath0 improved action @xcite , in exactly the same sense that the clover action is an improved action .",
    "if we are interested in going beyond spectrum calculations to compute improved matrix elements , for example for structure functions and decay constants , we also need to know how to improve fermion operators .",
    "when we compute forward hadronic matrix elements , it is enough if the operators are improved for on - shell quantities .",
    "however , some methods of doing non - perturbative renormalisation @xcite require calculations of off - shell green s functions , with a virtuality large enough that we can reasonably compare with continuum perturbation theory . to do this well",
    ", we would like to be able to remove @xmath0 effects from off - shell green s functions too .",
    "in this paper we find several ways of improving operators for the ginsparg - wilson action , both for on - shell and off - shell green s functions .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in sect .",
    "2 we first study the fermion propagator , and in sect .  3 we test the results in the free case for a particular realisation of ginsparg - wilson fermions . in sect .",
    "4 we then turn to our main subject , operator improvement .",
    "the major outcome is that , in the simplest form , the improved operators do not require any coefficients to be tuned non - perturbatively . in sect .",
    "5 we briefly comment on the ward identities , and in sect .",
    "6 we conclude .",
    "in this section we review some known results concerning the ginsparg - wilson propagator , as preparation for our consideration of bilinear fermionic operators . the basic ginsparg - wilson condition is @xcite @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the ginsparg - wilson fermion matrix .",
    "the fermion matrix does not anti - commute with @xmath3 , but there is nevertheless a form of chiral symmetry present @xcite .",
    "let us now look more closely at the ginsparg - wilson matrix . from the matrix @xmath2 we can define a related matrix @xcite @xmath4 we will discuss later what happens when @xmath2 has an eigenvalue equal to @xmath5 .",
    "this implies @xmath6 the eigenvalues of @xmath2 lie on a circle of radius @xmath7 and centre @xmath7 , while the eigenvalues of @xmath8 lie on the imaginary axis .",
    "the relationship between the eigenvalues of the two matrices is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : gw ] .",
    "if we substitute eq .",
    "( [ dsub ] ) into the condition ( [ gw_condition ] ) we find that @xmath9 the chiral properties of @xmath8 are even closer to those of the continuum dirac operator than @xmath2 .",
    "the fermion propagator we really want to use is the propagator calculated with @xmath8 .",
    "the propagator calculated from @xmath2 has contact terms of @xmath0 , which mean that if we fourier transform it we will find @xmath0 lattice artifacts when we are off - shell .",
    "a propagator calculated from @xmath8 contains no contact terms : it satisfies chirality even at zero distance .",
    "therefore it will be improved off - shell too .",
    "we want to write down improved green s functions for the massive as well as for the massless theory .",
    "when we consider massive fermions , we will use the fermion matrix @xcite @xmath10 this is the usual choice when working with ginsparg - wilson fermions , and it has the advantage of giving a simple linear relationship between bare and renormalised fermion masses .",
    "most other ways of adding a quark mass lead to non - linear relationships of the form @xmath11 .",
    "however , despite the slightly more complicated form of the answer , the improvement schemes we suggest in this paper also work with minor modifications for other choices of @xmath12 , for example @xmath13 .",
    "the fermion propagator @xmath14 still contains contact terms violating chiral symmetry .",
    "the fermion propagator with the correct chiral symmetry properties is the propagator corresponding to @xmath8 , i.e. @xmath15 we will always use @xmath16 to denote improved quantities .",
    "the improved green s functions have the correct chiral properties , and we therefore know that they are free of @xmath0 discretisation errors .",
    "this is because any @xmath0 term in a green s function has the opposite chirality to the leading term , so checking chirality is a simple way of testing for @xmath0 discretisation errors . the improved propagator ( [ sheur ] ) can be calculated in terms of the fermion matrix @xmath12 . inserting the definition ( [ kdef ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ sheur ] ) we find @xmath17 with improvement coefficients @xmath18 we use the lattice delta function @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the dimensionless kronecker delta function . although the propagators @xmath21 and @xmath22 in eq .",
    "( [ sstardef ] ) are of course gauge - dependent , the improvement coefficients @xmath23 and @xmath24 are gauge independent .    note that although we have used @xmath8 at intermediate stages in the discussion , our final result ( [ sstardef ] ) only involves inverting the fermion matrix @xmath12 .",
    "as noted before , @xmath8 is not well defined if @xmath2 has eigenvalues exactly equal to @xmath5 , which will happen in topologically non - trivial configurations . on the other hand , the fermion matrix @xmath12 has no such problems .",
    "it is always invertible for @xmath25 , so eq .  ( [ sstardef ] ) can be applied even in configurations with a non - trivial winding number .",
    "our improved green s functions will always be of such a form that only @xmath26 appears as a propagator .",
    "an identity equivalent to eq .",
    "( [ sstardef ] ) that will often prove useful is @xmath27    now that we have defined a propagator , we can look for an expression for the chiral condensate .",
    "the natural choice of order parameter for chiral symmetry is to take the trace of the improved propagator @xmath22 , @xmath28 the final form of the improved chiral condensate is the same as that given in @xcite .",
    "in this section we consider one explicit realisation of the ginsparg - wilson condition ( [ gw_condition ] ) , namely neuberger s dirac operator @xcite . we show that the formulae we derived do indeed lead to results free of @xmath0 effects .",
    "starting from the massless wilson fermion matrix @xmath29 , neuberger introduces the matrix @xmath30 , defined by @xmath31 it can then be shown that the operator @xmath32 satisfies the ginsparg - wilson condition ( [ gw_condition ] ) .    in the free theory ,",
    "the wilson matrix is diagonal in momentum , and has the value @xmath33 where we use @xmath34 calculating @xmath35 , the ginsparg - wilson matrix corresponding to @xmath29 , we find @xcite @xmath36 and @xmath37 if we expand @xmath38 for small @xmath39 , we find @xmath40 so @xmath35 still has discretisation errors of @xmath0 .    however , when we calculate @xmath41 according to the formula ( [ kdef ] ) , we find @xmath42 finally in @xmath41 we have an operator which anti - commutes with @xmath3 .",
    "when we expand it for small @xmath39 , we find @xmath43 which has lattice errors of @xmath44 .",
    "however , @xmath45 does have problems of its own .",
    "it diverges when @xmath46 and @xmath47 , which occurs at the ` doubler ' momenta @xmath48 .",
    "because it has poles in momentum space , it would also be an extremely non - local matrix if fourier transformed back into position space .",
    "this is , of course , inevitable : the nielsen - ninomiya theorem tells us that a fermion matrix that anti - commutes with @xmath3 and has no doubling must be non - local .",
    "the improved propagator does not have these difficulties .",
    "it is @xmath49 the denominator has no zeroes if @xmath50 , and if @xmath51 the only zero is at @xmath52 .",
    "the numerator vanishes at the ` doubler ' momenta .",
    "if we expand this propagator as a power series in @xmath53 , we see that there is no @xmath0 term : the discretisation errors of @xmath22 are of @xmath44 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : prop ] we compare the trace of the various lattice propagators with the correct continuum result .",
    "the wilson propagator and the unimproved ginsparg - wilson propagator @xmath26 both deviate from the correct result when @xmath54 , but the improved propagator @xmath22 is good up to @xmath55 .",
    "next we want to improve the green s function corresponding to a flavour non - singlet operator @xmath56 where @xmath57 can include dirac structure and covariant derivatives .",
    "covariant derivatives can be represented by the usual formulae @xmath58 ,    \\nonumber \\\\   { \\bar f } { \\stackrel{\\leftarrow}{d}}_\\mu   & = & \\frac{1}{2 a } \\left [     { \\bar f}(x + \\hat{\\mu } )   u_\\mu^\\dagger(x )    - { \\bar f}(x - \\hat{\\mu } )   u_\\mu ( x - \\hat{\\mu } ) \\right ] ,   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] or by any other expression with discretisation errors of @xmath44 .",
    "we want our improved green s function to be @xmath59 this will have discretisation errors of @xmath44 , because the propagators used have been improved , and the usual discretisation of @xmath57 is valid up to terms of @xmath44 .",
    "we need a formula analogous to eq .",
    "( [ sstardef ] ) , giving @xmath60 in terms of @xmath26 .",
    "the simplest way to construct such an identity is by using eq .",
    "( [ kdident ] ) , which gives @xmath61 where @xmath62 equation  ( [ goffshell ] ) is written with the same wave function improvement factor as eq .",
    "( [ sstardef ] ) , because the quantity of physical interest is always the ratio @xmath63 , and we want the wave function factors to cancel .",
    "equation  ( [ goffshell ] ) is not the most general expression for @xmath60 .",
    "we can use the equation of motion @xmath64 to show that this is equivalent to the expression @xmath65 ,    \\label{gw3pt_2}\\ ] ] where @xmath66 with @xmath67 there are two free parameters in this system of equations .",
    "the improvement coefficients @xmath68 and @xmath69 can take any value , but once it is chosen , the values of the other improvement coefficients are fixed .",
    "this freedom comes from the equations of motion , which allow us to compensate for a change in one of the improvement coefficients by adjusting the other coefficients .",
    "for an example of this in the clover action see  @xcite .",
    "the terms proportional to @xmath70 and @xmath71 can be interpreted as contact terms .",
    "the green s function we are interested in has the form @xmath72 . on the lattice",
    "we should expect to see a contact term of the form @xmath73 , with a coefficient of @xmath0 , and a ` double contact term ' of the form @xmath74 , with a coefficient of @xmath44 .",
    "if we are looking at the operator green s function on - shell , these contact terms are irrelevant , because the fermion fields will all be well separated in position , and so the delta functions are all zero . in this case",
    "we can use any values of @xmath68 and @xmath69 , as long as we use the correct @xmath75 value .    on the other hand ,",
    "if we look at the off - shell green s functions , we have to take the contact terms into account .",
    "one possibility would be that as well as computing @xmath76 one would also compute @xmath70 and @xmath71 and add them with the coefficients @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "a more elegant procedure would be to use eq .",
    "( [ goffshell ] ) , i.e. to choose @xmath68 and @xmath69 so that the contact terms are absent , and @xmath76 is improved both on- and off - shell .",
    "the improvement coefficients for this special case are @xmath79 note that , as in the previous section , the matrix @xmath8 is only used heuristically . to find the improved green s functions @xmath22 and @xmath60 , the only matrix that we really have to invert is @xmath12 .",
    "finally , we mention another way to calculate the improved green s functions @xmath22 and @xmath60 of eqs .",
    "( [ sstardef ] ) , ( [ ggoal ] ) . from eq .",
    "( [ kdident ] ) we can write the improved propagator as @xmath80 since @xmath2 and @xmath12 commute , this can be rewritten in the more symmetric form @xmath81 this formula gives exactly the same improved propagator as eq .",
    "( [ sstardef ] ) , but it lends itself to a somewhat different interpretation . in eq .",
    "( [ sstardef ] ) we subtract an unwanted contact term present in the unimproved propagator , while eq .",
    "( [ srot ] ) can be interpreted as the propagator of a ` rotated ' fermion field , which is similar to the picture of clover improvement presented in @xcite .",
    "similar formulae can be written for the improved green s functions , where instead of adding irrelevant higher dimension terms to @xmath57 we perform a ` rotation ' of the fermion fields .",
    "the resulting formula is @xmath82 where @xmath83 using the identity ( [ kdident ] ) it is easy to see that eq .",
    "( [ grot ] ) is equivalent to eq .",
    "( [ ggoal ] ) .",
    "the rotation approach requires us to take the square root of a matrix , which is not needed in the irrelevant operator approach , so it might be more costly to implement .",
    "as with the propagator , we can illustrate the effects of improving the green s function by looking at a simple case in the free theory , namely the green s function @xmath84 for the local vector current @xmath85 . here",
    "@xmath86 is a flavour matrix , @xmath87 , normalised so that @xmath88 . as in the case of the propagator , the most sensitive test is to look at the scalar part of the green s function , which is shown in fig .  [ fig : gammamu ] .",
    "we have chosen the quantity @xmath89,\\ ] ] which has the value @xmath90 in the continuum .",
    "again , the wilson action and the unimproved ginsparg - wilson green s function deviate significantly from the desired continuum result at @xmath54 , while the improved green s function only has errors of @xmath44 and remains reliable until @xmath55 .    as a final example in the free case ,",
    "let us take an operator with a derivative , namely @xmath91 with @xmath92 .",
    "this is an operator that can be used to compute the flavour non - singlet moment @xmath93 of a hadronic structure function . in the continuum , the free green s function for this operator has the value @xmath94 the improved lattice green s function found by applying the formulae in sect .  [",
    "sect : impop ] is @xmath95 where the explicit form of @xmath96 is given in eq .",
    "( [ sstarfree ] ) .",
    "since the discretisation errors of @xmath22 are @xmath44 it is clear that the difference between @xmath97 and @xmath98 is also of @xmath44 .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : freex ] , where we plot the trace of @xmath99 .",
    "in the continuum chiral symmetry relates the scalar part of the fermion propagator to the forward green s function for the non - singlet pseudoscalar operator @xmath100 : @xmath101 on the lattice we can check that the improved green s functions of sect .  [ sect : impop ] satisfy the same ward identity : @xmath102 one might naively expect that this ward identity would be violated at @xmath44 by the discretisation errors , but in fact it holds exactly , even though both the left hand side and the right hand side have discretisation errors of @xmath44 .    note that all the green s functions needed for ward identities , like eq .",
    "( [ lattward ] ) , can be computed on the lattice .",
    "so we can hope to use them to determine the improvement coefficients in other improved theories , such as clover fermions , where we can not calculate them analytically from first principles .",
    "we see that using the ginsparg - wilson action there are many ways of constructing propagators and green s functions which are correct to @xmath44 , both on - shell and off - shell . in this paper",
    "we have considered both , improvement by adding the green s functions of irrelevant operators , and by rotating the fermion fields .",
    "the idea is very simple . in eqs .",
    "( [ sheur ] ) and ( [ ggoal ] ) we have the green s functions we wish to obtain , with the correct chiral symmetries , and therefore free from all @xmath0 errors .",
    "however , there they are expressed in terms of the associated matrix @xmath8 , defined in eq .",
    "( [ kdef ] ) .",
    "fortunately , it is easy to find equivalent expressions in terms of the well - defined matrix @xmath12 , so we never need to find or invert @xmath8 explicitly .",
    "the improvement coefficients are universal .",
    "it makes no difference which theory is being considered , abelian or non - abelian gauge theory , or a theory with no gauge symmetry , or what value of the coupling is being used .",
    "it does not even matter which operator is being considered .",
    "operator improvement for other improved actions , such as clover fermions , will certainly not be so simple .",
    "the improvement coefficients in that case will certainly be functions of the coupling , and depend on the theory considered .",
    "nevertheless , ginsparg - wilson fermions may give some hints as to what sort of improvement terms are needed , and what sort of contact terms are to be expected .",
