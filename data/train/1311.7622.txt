    "the decrease of the amplitude of this bunching signal in a transverse magnetic field of a few tens of mt ( fig .",
    "[ fig9](a ) ) confirms that the pl intermittency results mainly from fluctuations of the mn spin .    to model this bunching signal",
    ", we have to take into account the spin dynamics of the mn and x - mn . in a simplified level scheme ,",
    "we neglect the hyperfine splitting within the x - mn complex and we consider that a single exciton state , @xmath73 , is laser coupled to the mn spin states @xmath56 with a generation rate @xmath74 .",
    "the dynamics of the mn spin in an empty qd is described by the time evolution of @xmath51 and the relaxation time @xmath54 describing the coupling by spin - flips of one unit the different spin states @xmath48 .",
    "the 24 x - mn levels are obtained from the diagonalization of @xmath75 .",
    "x - mn can optically recombine along a mn spin conserving channel with a lifetime @xmath59 for the bright exciton or @xmath76 for the dark exciton .",
    "x - mn can also relax along channels involving a change of the spin by one unit with a characteristic time @xmath77 .",
    "this relaxation path , combined with an optical recombination of the exciton , permits a transfer of population from the exciton state @xmath78 to any other spin state of the mn @xmath48 . to describe the main x - mn spin relaxation channel revealed by the resonant pl spectra ( _ i.e _ relaxation of the exciton with conservation of the mn spin observed in fig.[fig5 ] ) , we consider a transfer rate between bright excitons with a characteristic time @xmath79 .    at finite temperature , the intraband relaxation rates @xmath80 between the different states of the x - mn complex depend on their energy separation @xmath81 .",
    "here we use @xmath80=1/@xmath82 if @xmath83 and @xmath80=1/@xmath84 if @xmath85 ( @xmath86 corresponding either to @xmath77 or @xmath79 ) @xcite .",
    "this describes a partial thermalization among the 24 x - mn levels during the lifetime of the bright or dark excitons , as observed experimentally ( see fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) .    in this model",
    "we also consider that for a magnetic field lower than a few hundreds mt , the zeeman energy of the exciton can be neglected since it is much smaller than the x - mn exchange interaction .",
    "we only take into account the effect of the magnetic field on the mn in the empty qd ( last term of @xmath51 ) .    using this level scheme",
    ", we can calculate the time evolution of the 60x60 density matrix describing the population and the coherence of the 36 states of the mn alone ( empty qd described by @xmath51 ) and the 24 x - mn states described by @xmath75 . to model the auto - correlation of the resonant pl , the initial state of the system is set to @xmath56 and one monitors the time evolution of the population of @xmath87 ( low energy line ) for an excitation of @xmath78 ( high energy line ) with a generation rate @xmath74 .",
    "when normalized to one at a long time delay , this time evolution accounts for the auto - correlation function of the transition associated with the level @xmath87 .    .",
    "the curves are obtained after convolution with the response of the hbt setup ( @xmath88 ) .",
    "the inset shows the calculated autocorrelation at short time delay before convolution with the response set - up .",
    "the parameters used in the calculation are : @xmath89 , @xmath65 , @xmath90 , @xmath66 , @xmath91 @xmath67 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , d@xmath53=1.5@xmath33 , e = d@xmath53/3 and the qd parameters of qd3 ( see table [ table1]).,width=336 ]    auto - correlation signals calculated with and without transverse magnetic field are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig9](b ) . in a weak transverse magnetic field ( inset of fig .",

    "the calculated curves are convoluted with the response of the system ( fig .",
    "[ fig9](b ) ) . as in the experiment",
    ", the calculated auto - correlation presents a large bunching at short time delay with a typical half width at half maximum of about 4 ns . this short mn spin memory is due to its precession in the hyperfine field of its nuclei @xcite . at low excitation intensity and at zero magnetic field ,",
    "the width of the experimental photon bunching is well reproduced by the model .    in a weak transverse magnetic field ,",
    "the amplitude of the bunching signal decreases significantly .",
    "the transverse magnetic field dependence of the shape of the calculated bunching signal ( width and amplitude ) is in qualitative agreement with the experiment ( fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] ) .",
    "a magnetic field of a few tens of @xmath92 has no effect on the x - mn system and do not change the contribution of the x - mn dynamics on the bunching amplitude .",
    "the observed and calculated decrease of the bunching amplitude is then induced by the precession of the mn spin in the transverse magnetic field when the qd is empty .",
    "this confirms that in our experiments the bunching signal at zero field is mainly controlled by the dynamics of the coupled electronic and nuclear spins of the mn in a weak residual crystal field .",
    "the width of the bunching signal measured at low excitation power is in good agreement with the calculated mn spin dynamics . however , at high excitation intensity a reduction of the width and the amplitude of the bunching is observed ( fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] ) .",
    "this reduction can not be explained by the presented model and it likely comes from a perturbation of the mn spin by non - resonantly injected free carriers in the vicinity of the qd .",
    "a similar increase of the mn spin relaxation rate was already observed for much confined cdte / znte qds under non - resonant excitation @xcite .",
    "we have incorporated and optically probed individual mn atoms in strain free cdte qds formed by interface fluctuations in thin quantum wells . despite the weak lateral confinement and a possible valence band mixing induced by an anisotropic shape of the confinement potential in these natural qds",
    ", we have shown that an individual mn atom can be optically addressed by a resonant optical excitation . magnetic field dependence and auto - correlation of the photoluminescence signal obtained under resonant excitation of the qd",
    "ground state show that , in these strain free structures , an isolated mn atom experiences a residual weak crystal field splitting likely due to local alloy fluctuations .",
    "an efficient optical pumping the mn spin is obtained under a weak magnetic field in the faraday geometry .    despite this residual crystal field ,",
    "strain free magnetic qds are promising systems to probe the coherent dynamics of the coupled electronic and nuclear spins of a mn atom in zero or weak magnetic field .",
    "these strain free mn - doped qds could also be included in photonic structures such as optical planar micro - cavities to increase the number of collected photons and their interaction with light .",
    "this would open the possibility to realize an optical coherent control of an individual mn spin in a weak transverse field using the optical stark effect or to probe and control the dynamics of the nuclear spin of the mn atom .",
