    "<S> these circumstances are naturally unfavorable for the formation of common abrikosov vortices and hence the character of the mixed state in magnetic fields close to @xmath1 may be very different from that adopted at lower fields .    </S>",
    "<S> in this paper we consider that in magnetic fields close to @xmath1 , the natural alternative to the conventional vortex structure is the formation of superconducting filaments , embedded in the matrix of the normal metal . </S>",
    "<S> the properties of such superconducting filaments may be analyzed by numerically solving the g - l equations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> first , we consider a single cylindrical superconducting filament in an infinitely extended normal metal . </S>",

    "<S> so far , we have considered a single superconducting filament in a normal metal matrix and we now consider the interaction between the filaments . because the current density in the normal metal between the filaments is zero </S>",
    "<S> there is no long - range interaction between them and the contribution to the free energy due to filament - filament interaction is zero unless the neighboring filaments are very close to each other . in order to show that the short - range interaction between the filaments is repulsive , we introduce the velocity of superconducting electrons @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the supercurrent , @xmath37 is the speed of light , and @xmath38 is the electron charge . in our case </S>",

    "<S> several solutions of the g - l equations are shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 . in this case , the order parameter vanishes with a non - zero derivative and we may introduce the radius of the filament as the value of @xmath43 at the point where @xmath44 .    as may be seen in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 , the diameter @xmath45 of the filament decreases with decreasing value of @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> the important consequence of the g - l equations is that the diameter @xmath45 of the filament can not be smaller than a certain minimal value @xmath46 . </S>",

    "<S> as may be seen , @xmath57 , which is the period of the triangular lattice of the filaments , is considerably larger than the equivalent quantity @xmath58 for the vortex structure .    </S>",
    "<S> the dependencies of @xmath31 and @xmath59 on the magnetic field for an equilibrium filament configuration practically coincide with those calculated in the single - filament approximation for @xmath60 ( see figs . </S>",
    "<S> 2(a ) and 2(b ) ) .    </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4(b ) shows the free energy of the system of filaments as a function of @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> the energy was calculated assuming that the filaments are cylindrical . </S>",
    "<S> we have to adopt this approach , in order to use one - dimensional g - l equations which are the basis of our consideration . </S>",
    "<S> it is obvious , however , that , because of their mutual interaction , the filaments should adopt a hexagonal rather than a circular cross - section . </S>",
    "<S> we note , however , that this simplification may only result in free energy values that are slightly higher than the actual ones .    </S>",
    "<S> = 0.6    as we have argued , the system of quantized vortices is not the only way to realize the mixed state of type - ii superconductors which may also be established by an ensemble of superconducting filaments . at low magnetic fields , where the equilibrium diameter of filaments @xmath61 , the filaments are unstable against the formation of a vortex line in the center of the filament . in order to identify the stable arrangement in higher fields , </S>",
    "<S> the free energies for these two configurations should be compared . to our knowledge </S>",
    "<S> the only study in which the two - dimensional g - l equations have been solved for the vortex lattice is presented in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> 5 shows the results of our calculations of the order parameter amplitude @xmath62 versus @xmath49 for filaments , together with the results of ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . in the high - magnetic - field limit , </S>",
    "<S> the term proportional to the magnetic moment in the gibbs free energy may be neglected and the density of the free energy reduces to @xmath63 . as may clearly be seen in fig . 5 , </S>",
    "<S> the amplitude of @xmath12 for the vortex lattice is considerably smaller than that for the filaments and the ratio @xmath64 increases with increasing magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> thus , in sufficiently high magnetic fields , the free energy for the configuration of superconducting filaments is expected to be lower than that for the vortex lattice .    </S>",
    "<S> the properties of a mixed state consisting of superconducting filaments are quite different from those of the abrikosov vortices . </S>",
    "<S> first , because the filaments are always separated by normal conducting regions , the sample resistance for currents perpendicular to the direction of the magnetic field never vanishes and the true zero - resistance superconducting state may be achieved only after the transition to the vortex structure . </S>",
    "<S> second , in the case of filaments , the magnetic flux faces no barriers to move in or out of the sample and the magnetization of the sample must be reversible , independent of whether the filaments are pinned or not .    </S>",
    "<S> the analysis presented in this paper shows that , in magnetic fields close to @xmath1 , the mixed state may well consist of a triangular lattice of superconducting filaments separated by regions where the superconducting order parameter @xmath44 . with decreasing external magnetic field , the configuration of superconducting filaments necessarily has to undergo a transition to the conventional mixed state , involving abrikosov vortices . </S>",
    "<S> the value of the transition field is determined by the free - energy balance between these two configurations which can not be determined without more precise calculations of the free energy for both cases . the transition from one type of mixed state to </S>",
    "<S> the other involves a complete change of topology and must be accompanied by discontinuities in both the resistivity and the magnetic moment of the sample . </S>",
    "<S> we also expect some hysteresis , as well as a latent heat , dictated by the discontinuity of the magnetization . </S>",
    "<S> in other words , this transition is expected to exhibit all the features of a first - order phase transition . </S>",
    "<S> such transitions are observed in high temperature superconductors at @xmath65 and are usually attributed to the melting of the vortex lattice @xcite .    ` `    we wish to thank r. monnier for numerous stimulating discussions . </S>"
