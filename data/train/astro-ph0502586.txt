    "massive stars ( m@xmath1 @xmath2 8 - 10 m@xmath3 ) conclude their stellar evolution as red supergiants before exploding as type ii supernovae .",
    "vy cma ( hd 58061 ; m5eia ) is one of the best studied supergiants . at a distance of 1.5 kpc @xcite ,",
    "vy cma maintains a luminosity of l@xmath0 = 2 - 5 @xmath4 10@xmath5 l@xmath6 @xcite , suggesting it is a massive star ( m @xmath7 15 m@xmath6 ) that will explode as a supernovae within 10@xmath5 yr @xcite .",
    "it is losing mass at a rate @xmath8 2 - 4 @xmath4 10@xmath9 m@xmath6 yr@xmath10 @xcite which produces the optically thick , dusty envelope enshrouding the star , thus hiding many clues to the nature of this enigmatic supergiant .",
    "there are many mysteries regarding supernova physics including why a core collapse event produces an explosion releasing @xmath810@xmath11 erg of kinetic energy and why some pulsars have space velocities as high as 1000 km s@xmath10 @xcite .",
    "both of these effects may be explained by anisotropies @xcite .",
    "indeed , many core collapse supernova remnants show strong polarization ( 4% for sn1997x ; @xcite ) , indicating a high degree of asphericity .",
    "vy cma exhibits asymmetries on scales from 10 - 10,000 r@xmath0 ( 0@xmath121 - 100@xmath13 ) and , therefore , is a good candidate for investigating the origin and nature of asymmetries in supergiants .",
    "early on , @xcite showed that at optical wavelengths the nebula surrounding vy cma appeared irregularly shaped with apparent structures within the bright central core of the nebulosity . at large scales ( @xmath8 3 pc ) ,",
    "vy cma s outflow is influencing the dynamics of the nearby h ii region s310 @xcite .",
    "recent visible and near - infrared ( near - ir ) images of vy cma from the hubble space telescope ( hst ) display a complex distribution of knots and filaments embedded in a one - sided reflection nebula extending @xmath8 4@xmath13 from the star @xcite toward the southwest . on small scales , using near - ir aperture masking techniques , @xcite have shown that the inner dust shell at @xmath8 15 r@xmath0 is highly one - sided and consistent with the hst results .",
    "even the molecular emission as traced by sio is much brighter and more extended to the southwest @xcite .",
    "additionally , the spatial and redshift distribution of h@xmath14o maser emission is not consistent with a simple spherical outflow , but rather appears elongated in the same direction as the near - ir emission @xcite .",
    "however , the point - spread - function ( psf ) subtracted 8.4 and 9.8 @xmath15 images of vy cma by @xcite give the appearance of a bipolar structure within 2@xmath13 east and west of the central source in apparent disagreement with the other observations .",
    "compared to the mass - loss envelope s structure , little is known about the inner layers ( @xmath16 10 r@xmath0 ) of vy cma s atmosphere where the dust condenses and mass is driven out due to radiation pressure on the dust and subsequent drag on gas molecules . since the star is concealed within an optically thick mass - loss envelope , only the longest wavelengths can possibly probe the inner atmosphere of vy cma .",
    "@xcite found that the 8.4 ghz emission measured by the vla is @xmath8 6 times that expected from photospheric emission of the supergiant and suggested that the excess may be due to an extended , 10,000 k ionized chromosphere as had been hypothesized for the nearby ( d @xmath8 130 pc ) supergiant @xmath17 ori @xcite .",
    "however , recent observations of @xmath17 ori revealed its atmosphere is dominated by cool ( few @xmath4 1000 k ) gas @xcite .",
    "further , @xcite , using the vla in the a - configuration , found that @xmath17 ori was resolved at 43 ghz with a radius of @xmath8 44 mas and partially resolved at 8.4 , 15 , and 22 ghz .",
    "the radius at 43 ghz corresponds to a size of nearly twice the stellar radius of 22.5 mas ( 3 au ; @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite , using the flux density and visibility measurements from various authors and a modified version of the mira radio photosphere model by ( @xcite ; hereafter rm97 ) , created a semi - empirical model of the temperature and density distributions out to @xmath8 14 r@xmath0 that fit the radio measurements of @xmath17 ori .",
    "we have obtained vla radio observations of vy cma to test possible emission scenarios and probe for asymmetries at radio frequencies .",
    "we find that a radio photosphere model similar to rm97 and @xcite fit the observed data .",
    "we use this model to interpret the physical characteristics of the inner ( 1 - 10 r@xmath0 ) atmosphere of vy cma .",
    "we also present new mid - ir observations of vy cma at 11.7 and 17.9 @xmath15 and show that the thermal mid - ir emission from the envelope is consistent with that seen in optical and near - ir observations .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in @xmath18 2 we describe the observations of vy cma we have obtained with the vla ( @xmath18 2.1 ) and the keck observatory ( @xmath18 2.2 ) .",
    "we then discuss , in @xmath18 3 , the origin of the radio emission by first identifying emission models that do not fit the data well and then in @xmath18 3.1 present an atmospheric model containing a radio photosphere that reproduces the observed flux densities . a description of the analysis and discussion of our mid - ir data is contained in @xmath18 4 . in @xmath18 5",
    "we present our conclusions and suggest possible future observations .",
    "we observed vy cma with the nrao very large array ( vla ) on 2001 oct . 2 at 43 ghz ( q - band ) in the hybrid dnc configuration and on 2002",
    "21 and 23 at 22 ghz ( k - band ) and 15 ghz ( u - band ) in the cnb configuration ; see table [ vla_obs ] for details .",
    "we used the standard continuum observation technique , employing four 50 mhz bands ( right- and left - circular polarization at two frequencies ) .",
    "the central frequencies observed were 43315 and 43365 mhz , 22435 and 22485 mhz , and 14915 and 14965 mhz for q - band , k - band , and u - band , respectively .",
    "pointing was verified about every hour .",
    "for the 22 ghz and 15 ghz data , we employed fast - switching to remove the tropospheric phase fluctuations .",
    "the flux density scale was set using observations of 3c 48 for the 43 ghz observations , and 3c 286 for the 22 ghz and 15 ghz observations .",
    "the secondary calibrator , 0650 - 166 , was used to calibrate the interferometric amplitudes and phases of vy cma at all frequencies .",
    "table [ vla_cal ] lists the assumed calibration source flux densities .",
    "calibration and imaging of the visibilities followed the procedures recommended for vla data with the astronomical image processing system ( aips ) . specifically , we imaged vy cma at each wavelength with maps of 256 by 256 pixels and pixel scales of 0@xmath1214 , 0@xmath121 , and 0@xmath121 at 43 , 22 , and 15 ghz , respectively .",
    "due to the low declination of the source , we used hybrid vla configurations with a a slightly longer northern arm which produced synthesized beams that are slightly elongated in the east - west direction : 1@xmath127 @xmath4 1@xmath125 with pa = -83@xmath19 at 43 ghz ; 1@xmath120 @xmath40@xmath1278 with pa = -70@xmath19 at 22 ghz ; and 1@xmath125 @xmath4 1@xmath120 with pa = 80@xmath19 at 15 ghz . at 43 and 15",
    "ghz , vy cma appears marginally larger than the beam , with deconvolved geometric - mean sizes of 1@xmath124 and 1@xmath127 , respectively ; at 22 ghz the source is unresolved .",
    "however , because the position angles for the elliptical gaussian fits to the sources do not match those of the beam , we consider vy cma to be unresolved at all three observed frequencies .",
    "we list the peak flux density measurements in table [ vla_vy ] , with formal errors that combine a 20% systematic error and the rms noise error estimated from the background .",
    "we note that the integrated flux densities , from a gaussian fit to the source , tend to be greater than the peak flux densities by as much as 20% .",
    "this is likely the result of poor phase calibration due to the @xmath2 10@xmath19 separation between vy cma and the secondary calibrator .",
    "we consider the peak flux density to be a better estimate of the flux since the source is unresolved at each wavelength .",
    "we observed vy cma with the long wavelength spectrograph ( lws ; @xcite ) , a facility instrument at the w.m .",
    "keck observatory , on 2000 feb . 5 at 11.7 @xmath15 ( @xmath20 = 1.0 @xmath15 ) and 17.9 @xmath15 ( @xmath20 = 2.0 @xmath15 ) .",
    "lws uses a 128 @xmath4 128 pixel boeing si : as detector and has a plate scale of 0@xmath1208 pixel@xmath10 , resulting in a 10@xmath122 @xmath4 10@xmath122 field of view .",
    "we employed the `` chop - nod '' mode of observing , with a chop throw of 10@xmath13 north .",
    "the irtf ir standard @xmath17 aur ( n = -1.94 ; q = -1.93 ; @xcite ) was used to calibrate the flux of vy cma and to measure the psf .",
    "the full - width - at - half - maximum of @xmath17 aur was measured to be 0@xmath1258 at 11.7 @xmath15 and 0@xmath1248 at 17.9 @xmath15 .",
    "we measure fluxes of 8600@xmath211700 jy at 11.7 @xmath15 and 9300@xmath211900 jy at 17.9 @xmath15 for vy cma .",
    "the 20% errors are derived from the variability of the calibrator s flux throughout the night .",
    "our measured flux density at 11.7 @xmath15 is consistent with the color corrected @xcite iras 12 @xmath15 flux of 8729 jy and with the mean dirbe 12 @xmath15 flux of 9295.5 jy .",
    "as we have not resolved vy cma at radio wavelengths , we can not comment on any asymmetry in the inner atmosphere , except to say that if one exists , it must be on scales smaller than @xmath8 1@xmath13 = 1500 au .",
    "the question we now ask is : what is the source of the radio emission from vy cma ?    in table",
    "[ vla_vy ] , we have compiled the radio flux densities of vy cma in the frequency range 8.4 - 43 ghz from this work and the literature . from vla monitoring of vy cma at 8.4 ghz from september 1990 to may 1991 ,",
    "@xcite find that vy cma may be variable by about a factor of 2 on an irregular timescale , but they note that within the errors , this variability is tentative . @xcite",
    "measured a flux density of 0.26 mjy for vy cma in january 1991 , consistent with the mean value of @xcite .",
    "our measurement of vy cma s flux density at 22 ghz of 0.66 @xmath21 0.20 mjy is about 1/2 the 1.3 @xmath21 0.3 mjy measured by @xcite in the early 1990 s at this frequency .",
    "this suggests that vy cma has some significant variability at radio frequencies in addition to the irregular variability seen at optical wavelengths @xcite and the semi - regular variability seen in maser emission @xcite .",
    "further observations will be necessary to confirm any variability .    fitting a mean power law to the flux densities listed in table [ vla_vy ] gives a spectral index of @xmath17 @xmath8 1.4 @xmath21 0.2 ( s@xmath22 @xmath23 @xmath24 ) , but given the possible variability , this value is uncertain since the phase at each observation is unknown .",
    "if we break up the data into the 1990 s set and the 2000 s set , where the former set is comprised of the @xcite and @xcite data and the latter of the data presented herein , we find the spectral index of each set is 1.7 @xmath21 0.3 , which is similar to that found for the radio spectra of mira variables ( @xmath17 = 1.86 ; rm97 ) .",
    "this spectral index is also close that expected from the stellar photosphere ( @xmath17 = 2 ) , however , the flux density levels we measure are about twice that expected from a star with photospheric temperature of t@xmath0 = 2800 k and radius r@xmath0 = 2.25 @xmath4 10@xmath25 cm ( 15 au ; @xcite ) at the distance of vy cma ( see figure [ spec ] , solid line ) .    the sub - millimeter spectrum of vy cma was modeled by @xcite ; hereafter ksr93 ) using small circumstellar dust grains ( a@xmath26 = 2000  ; @xmath27 = 3.5 g @xmath28 ) with an emissivity index @xmath29 = 0.9 .",
    "they derive a dust mass - loss rate of 2 @xmath4 10@xmath30 m@xmath3 yr@xmath10 within a region of radius 10@xmath31 cm . assuming all the emission above the expected photospheric emission at radio frequencies is due to dust with the ksr93 parameters ,",
    "then we calculate the total dust mass using @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the total measured flux density from the source , @xmath34 is the expected photospheric flux density , @xmath35 is the distance to vy cma , @xmath36 is the grain emissivity , and @xmath37 is the temperature in the envelope .",
    "we use the ksr93 function for the emissivity : @xmath38 where @xmath39 = 5.65 @xmath4 10@xmath9 at @xmath40 = 274.6 ghz . the color corrected iras fluxes @xcite at 60 and 100",
    "@xmath15 are 1119 jy and 304.5 jy , respectively , and the ratio of the iras fluxes gives an envelope temperature of 235 k. thus , our 43.3 ghz flux density of 2.8 mjy , after subtraction of 1.2 mjy from the expected photospheric emission , implies a dust mass of 1.3 @xmath4 10@xmath41 m@xmath6 within our unresolved source of radius @xmath8 0@xmath125 .",
    "however , using the dust mass - loss rate and outflow velocity from the ksr93 model , the total mass expected to reside within a radius of 0@xmath125 is only 1.8 @xmath4 10@xmath9 m@xmath6 , a factor of @xmath8 7 less than that calculated from the 43.3 ghz data .",
    "that is , there would need to be more dust closer to the star than is predicted by the ksr93 model .",
    "it may be possible to fit the observed radio flux densities with a second population of dust grains closer to the star .",
    "we now turn to an alternative source of radio emission : a radio photosphere . in their attempt to model radio spectra of mira stars , rm97 find that at long wavelengths their observations of these long period variables are well fit by radio photospheres with radii @xmath8 2 r@xmath0 .",
    "the opacity in the extended radio photosphere model is predominately provided by free - free absorption from the interaction between neutral atomic and molecular hydrogen and free electrons supplied mostly by na , al , k , and ca ( elements with low ionization potentials ) .",
    "we have applied this opacity model to vy cma .",
    "given a temperature and density profile for the stellar atmosphere as a function of radius outward from the surface , at each layer in the star s atmosphere we assume thermodynamic equilibrium and solve the saha equation simultaneously for na , al , k , and ca to determine the total electron density and pressure ( p@xmath42 ) .",
    "following rm97 , we use solar abundances , ionization potentials , and partition functions from @xcite .",
    "we use dissociation coefficients given by @xcite to calculate the densities of atomic and molecular hydrogen ( @xmath43(@xmath44 ) and @xmath43(h@xmath45 ) ) . to evaluate the absorption coefficients for h@xmath46 and h@xmath45 free - free emission ( @xmath47(h@xmath46 ) and @xmath47(h@xmath45 ) ) for temperatures @xmath16 3000 k ,",
    "we use the third order polynomials in temperature given in rm97 . for temperatures",
    "higher than 3000 k , we assume the atmosphere is composed entirely of atomic hydrogen , and solve for the absorption coefficient , @xmath47(h@xmath46 ) , by numerically evaluating the equations given in @xcite .",
    "the absorption coefficients are proportional to the inverse square of the frequency and have units of @xmath48 dyn@xmath10 .",
    "we then calculate the optical depth increment @xmath49 p_e dl\\ ] ] where @xmath50 is the step size through the atmosphere .",
    "the brightness temperature , @xmath51 , at an optical depth @xmath52 in the supergiant s atmosphere is computed from @xmath53 which is the formal solution to the radiative transfer equation in the rayleigh - jeans limit .",
    "we numerically integrate along the line - of - sight toward the center of the star and then repeat the integrations moving perpendicular to the line - of - sight with step size @xmath54 to evaluate the center - to - limb brightness temperature profile , @xmath55 .",
    "the total flux density , s@xmath22 , is calculated assuming azimuthal symmetry using @xmath56 we use a model s total flux density values at all four observed radio frequencies compared to those observed to evaluate the validity of a model and its respective inputs result .    as a simple approximation",
    ", we assume an isothermal atmosphere and compute the density structure for a range of input temperatures .",
    "the density profile for an isothermal atmosphere is that required by hydrostatic equilibrium out to the critical radius ( @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the isothermal sound speed , @xmath59 is the gravitational constant , @xmath60 is the effective stellar mass , and @xmath61 is the mean molecular weight of the gas ) even if there is a radiation pressure driven wind @xcite . we have used the term @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the opacity , to account for the alteration of the effective stellar mass due to radiation pressure .",
    "we take the temperature- and density - dependent planck mean opacity values from @xcite as upper limits to the opacity and consider this to be more accurate for the optically thin stellar atmosphere than the rosseland mean opacities @xcite . at temperatures higher than @xmath8 3000 k the rosseland mean opacities are essentially equivalent to the planck mean opacities @xcite . the density as a function of radius , @xmath64 , for an atmosphere in hydrostatic equilibrium",

    "for the t = 1600 k model atmosphere , the density drops so quickly that the optical depth toward impact parameters @xmath2 r@xmath0 is very small and , therefore , the radius of the radio star is not much larger than r@xmath0 .",
    "since s@xmath22 is a sum over the radio radius , this results in flux density values too low to be consistent with those measured for vy cma .",
    "we find that the two warmer atmospheres produce radio photospheres whose model flux densities bracket those observed for vy cma .",
    "the model output flux density values from the radio photosphere for both these models are listed in table [ vla_vy ] and are represented as the dashed and dot - dashed lines in figure [ spec ] .",

    ", the supergiant lacks any uv lines which would hint at the existence and temperature of a stellar chromosphere .",
    "recent modeling of high resolution uv spectra of the supergiant @xmath17 ori s atmosphere produced a temperature fit to the h@xmath17 lines not in excess of 5500 k @xcite .",

    "further , monitoring of vy cma in the ir as proposed by @xcite and @xcite to follow evolution of structures and the general shape of the mass - loss envelope will provide insight into the orientation and dynamics of the central star and may help constrain the dust mass - loss parameters .",
