    "[ spectrum2 ] the one - particle spectra for up - spin electrons , @xmath72 , are shown at @xmath73 .",
    "we recall that the zeeman splitting due to the magnetic field pushes @xmath72 down to the negative - frequency side , so that the peak position at @xmath61 $ ] is shifted below the fermi level , and thus the insulating gap is closed .",
    "this is indeed observed in the results for @xmath74 in fig .",
    "[ spectrum2 ] . upon introduction of @xmath15 ,",
    "there appear two notable features .",
    "first , the effective zeeman shift is increased in the presence of @xmath15 , which is seen in the high frequency region of fig .",
    "[ spectrum2 ] .",
    "this is caused by the competition between the kondo and rkky couplings .",
    "for @xmath74 , the kondo - singlet formation suppresses the effect of the zeeman shift .",
    "since the rkky interaction enhances spin fluctuations of @xmath0-electrons , it makes the kondo effect weaker , thus reviving the large zeeman shift .    .",
    "]    another important feature is the characteristic low - energy behavior .",
    "for example , in the low - energy region for @xmath70 , the dispersion is highly renormalized to form a flat band around @xmath75 , which can not be explained in terms of the effective zeeman shift mentioned above .",
    "such behavior is seen more clearly in the quasi - particle dispersion of @xmath13-electrons , @xmath76 , plotted in fig .",
    "[ dispersion ] .",
    "this remarkable effect is regarded as the mass enhancement caused by critical @xmath0-spin fluctuations .",
    "in fact , the system at @xmath70 is very close to the quantum phase transition , as discussed momentarily below .",
    "conduction electrons scattered by such critical @xmath0-spin fluctuations get heavier , resulting in the flat dispersion . the corresponding gap is shown in fig . [ gap ] as a function of the field . in the absence of the rkky - interaction , the gap",
    "is reduced linearly and closed at the field corresponding to the gap size @xmath77 . as the rkky - interaction",
    "is increased , the gap can persist up to larger fields reflecting the renormalization effect mentioned above .    in order to see how @xmath0-spin fluctuations behave in magnetic fields , we plot the field dependence of the imaginary part of the dynamical susceptibility @xmath78 , \\omega)$ ] @xmath79 in figs .",
    "[ fig_a1 ] and [ fig_a2 ] . comparing the susceptibility for @xmath80 and 0.3 at @xmath54",
    ", one can see that @xmath81 $ ] triplet modes are softened in the presence of the rkky interaction . as the magnetic field",
    "is introduced , the longitudinal ( @xmath19-component ) and the transverse ( @xmath82-component ) susceptibilities exhibit different properties . since @xmath83 , \\omega)$ ] excites an @xmath84 triplet mode , its peak position is mostly unchanged even at finite fields , as is seen both for the @xmath80 and @xmath85 cases . on the other hand , the transverse susceptibility @xmath86 , \\omega)$ ] shows a splitting in the spectrum , corresponding to @xmath87 triplet modes .",
    "the peak in the higher - energy side is smeared considerably by the life - time effect .",
    "it should be noticed here that the peak structure , which is shifted to lower frequencies , gets sharper as @xmath18 increases , and this tendency becomes more significant as @xmath15 becomes large .",
    "for example , for the @xmath70 case , although weak magnetic fields ( @xmath88 ) merely suppress spin fluctuations and thus reduce the spin - triplet peak , larger magnetic fields ( @xmath89 ) increase the peak intensity again , signaling that the system approaches the antiferromagnetic instability . to see the antiferromagnetic instability directly , we show the transverse static susceptibility of localized @xmath0-spins , @xmath90)$ ] , in fig . [ sus ] . for smaller rkky couplings ( @xmath91 )",
    "there is no indication of the instability as the magnetic field increases .",
    "we can see the rapid increase of @xmath90)$ ] for @xmath70 reflecting the antiferromagnetic instability : the system is driven to the transverse antiferromagnetic phase ( @xmath82-@xmath92 plane ) with finite values of @xmath19-components ( canted order ) .",

    "the above characteristic properties also affect the static quantities in magnetic fields .",
    "for instance , we plot the magnetization curve in fig .",
    "[ magnet ] . at @xmath74 , @xmath94 ( @xmath93 ) has a relatively large ( small ) response to the field . as the strength of the rkky interaction increases",
    ", @xmath94 is suppressed whereas @xmath93 is enhanced .",
    "although the sharp spin - gap behavior in the magnetization is somehow obscured for the parameters exploited here , the above magnetic - field dependence indeed comes from the competition between the kondo coupling and the rkky interaction , as explained below .",
    "the increase of @xmath15 has a tendency to suppress the kondo singlet formation , so that the conduction electrons start to polarize rather freely for finite @xmath15 , increasing the magnetization . on the other hand ,",
    "@xmath94 is generally suppressed with the increase of @xmath15 .",
    "such behavior is consistent with the change of the density of states ( dos ) shown in fig .",
    "[ dos ] . comparing the dos between the cases of @xmath74 and 0.3",
    ", we see that the effective zeeman shift in conduction electrons is somewhat enhanced for @xmath70 , which is clearly observed around @xmath99 .",
    "this shift gives rise to the increment of @xmath93 as seen in fig .",
    "[ magnet ] .",
    "finally , we make a comment on the low - energy behavior of the dos in fig .",
    "[ dos ] . if we look at the dos around @xmath100 , the shift of the peak structure is smaller for @xmath70 than @xmath74 contrary to the effective zeeman shift .",
    "this is what we have claimed as the mass renormalization effect due to critical transverse @xmath0-spin fluctuations in fig .",
    "[ spectrum2 ] ; it is a typical correlation effect between conduction electrons and @xmath0-spins , which is beyond the naive mean - field picture .",
    "we have studied the klm with the rkky exchange interaction among local @xmath0-spins in the presence of a magnetic field . for this purpose",
    "we have exploited an extended version of dmft combined with nca .",
    "this approach enables us to treat inter - site spin correlations dropped in the dmft framework . by investigating the one - particle spectral function and the dynamical spin susceptibility ,",
    "we have confirmed that the rkky - interaction has a tendency to enhance field - induced magnetic instability to the transverse magnetic order of @xmath0-spins , as should be expected .",
    "we have clarified two characteristic features caused by the competition of the kondo and rkky interactions in magnetic fields .",
    "one is a simple mean - field type effect : the rkky interaction enhances the zeeman shift for conduction electrons , which modifies the profile of the one - particle spectrum at high frequencies as well as the magnetization curve .",
    "another important feature is a renormalization effect observed in the low - energy region : the quasi - particle spectrum gets renormalized to form heavy quasi - particles when the system is close to the phase transition point .",
    "this effect appears as if the rkky interaction protects the kondo insulating gap in magnetic fields .",
    "anyway , this remarkable feature at low energies is a typical correlation effect beyond the mean field picture , which characterizes the critical region of the field - induced phase transition in the kondo insulator .",
    "field - induced transitions to the transverse antiferromagnetic order should be observed in heavy - fermion kondo insulators .",
    "unfortunately , there have been few examples of such transitions reported so far .",
    "recently , it has been experimentally found @xcite that a typical filled - skutterdite , @xmath101 , which may be classified as an kondo insulator , exhibits a field - induced magnetic phase transition . this transition could be a transition to the transverse antiferromagnetic phase discussed here , although more detailed study should be done since the above skutterdite has rather complicated electronic structure including orbital degrees of freedom .",
    "we think that a variety of compounds exhibiting such field - induced transitions may be found in the class of heavy fermion kondo insulators .",
