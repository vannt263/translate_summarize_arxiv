    "the recent discovery of extrasolar giant planets orbiting around nearby solar  type stars ( marcy & butler 1998 , 2000 ; mayor & queloz 1995 ) has stimulated renewed interest in the theory of planet formation .",
    "the objects observed so far have masses , @xmath2 , that are characteristic of giant planets , i.e. @xmath3 , m@xmath4 denoting a jupiter mass .",
    "the orbital semi - major axes are in the range @xmath5 , and orbital eccentricities in the range @xmath6 ( marcy & butler 2000 ) .",
    "it is a challenge to formation theories to explain the observed masses and orbital element distributions .",
    "there are two main theories of giant planet formation ( see papaloizou , terquem & nelson 1999 and references therein ) .",
    "one is the core instability scenario . in this , a solid core of several earth masses is built up in the protostellar disc , at which point it is able to begin to accrete gas and evolve to become a giant planet .",
    "once massive enough it is able to open a gap in the disc and undergo orbital migration through disc protoplanet interactions ( e.g. lin & papaloizou 1993 ) .",
    "it has been suggested that the high orbital eccentricities for extrasolar planets might be explained by disc - protoplanet interactions ( artymowicz 1992 ) .",
    "recent simulations of protoplanets in the observed mass range ( kley 1999 , bryden et al . 1999 ,",
    "lubow , seibert & artymowicz 1999 ) interacting with a disc with parameters thought to be typical of protoplanetary discs , but constrained to be in circular orbit , indicate gap formation and upper mass limit consistent with the observations .",
    "however , simulations by nelson et al .",
    "( 2000 ) that relaxed the assumption of fixed circular orbits found inward migration and that the disc - protoplanet interaction leads to strong eccentricity damping .",
    "thus the observed eccentricities of apparently isolated extrasolar planets are so far unexplained by this scenario .",
    "the other possible formation mechanism is through fragmentation or gravitationnal instability in a protostellar disc ( e.g. cameron 1978 , boss 2000 ) .",
    "this may occur early in the life of a protostellar disc surrounding a class  0 protostar on a dynamical timescale .",
    "such discs have been observed ( see , e.g. , pudritz et al . 1996 ) and the characteristic size is about 100  au .",
    "it is unlikely that such a process would operate at distances smaller than about 50  au from the central star as , in the optically thick parts of the disc , non axisymmetric density waves redistibute mass and angular momentum before fragmentation can proceed ( eg .",
    "papaloizou & savonije 1991 , laughlin & bodenheimer 1994 ) .",
    "fragmentation is more likely when cooling is efficient , as may occur in the optically thin parts of the disc , beyond about 50  au ( papaloizou et al  1999 ) .",
    "however , the detailed conditions required for it to occur are unclear and may require constraining influences from the external environment ( pickett et al 2000 ) .",
    "note that fragmentation may also occur before a disc is completely formed , during the initial collapse of the protostellar envelope .",
    "such opacity limited fragmentation has been estimated to produce objects with a lower mass limit of 7 jupiter masses ( masunaga  & inutsuka 1999 ) , but there is no definitive argument to rule out somewhat smaller masses ( bodenheimer et al .",
    "it is possible that both a disc and fragments may form simultaneously out of the envelope , the relative importance of the two processes depending for instance on the angular momentum content of the envelope , on the strength of any magnetic field ( so far neglected in disc fragmentation calculations ) and possibly on the initial clumpiness .",
    "note that large scale observations of class  0 envelopes so far do not rule out the presence of clumps with masses smaller than about 10 jupiter masses ( motte & andr 2001 ) .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to investigate the evolution under gravitational interactions of a distribution of @xmath7 massive planets which we assume to have been formed through a fragmentation process rapidly enough that their orbits can undergo subsequent dynamical relaxation on a time scale of hundreds of orbits . in common with related work on orbital evolution",
    "ocuring after assummed formation in a disc ( eg .",
    "weidenschilling & mazari 1996 , rasio & ford 1996 , lin & ida 1997 ) we shall neglect the effects of any remnant disc gas so that apart from tidal interactions with the central star there are only gravitational interactions .",
    "thus this work complements studies of the initial fragmentation process in a gaseous medium .",
    "it turns out that the resulting evolution leads to similar end states independently of whether the initial configuration is assumed to be in the form of a spherical shell or a disk  like structure .",
    "the motivations for this work are firstly the suggestion by black ( 1997 ) and stepinski  & black ( 2000 ) that massive extrasolar planets on highly eccentric orbits could actually be the low  mass tail of the low  mass companion distribution to solar  like stars produced by fragmentation processes . here",
    "we wish to investigate to what extent planets with orbital elements similar to those observed can be produced and in particular whether hot jupiters orbiting close to the star can be formed .",
    "secondly we consider the recently detected population of free - floating planets and its relationship to that of planets orbiting solar  type stars ( lucas & roche 2000 , zapatero osorio et al . 2000 ) .",
    "it is of interest to know to what extent free - floating planets could be produced as a result of ejection from the neighbourhood of a star .",
    "we have considered the orbital evolution of @xmath7 bodies with masses in the giant planet range , which are assumed to be formed rapidly , using up the gas in a protostellar disc or envelope around a solar mass star , so that they can undergo subsequent dynamical relaxation on a timescale @xmath1 orbits .",
    "we have performed calculations with @xmath8    in all the runs we performed , most of the planets where ejected from the system and at most 3 planets remained bound to the central star .",
    "we found that close encounters with the central star occured for about 10% of the planets for all values of @xmath7 considered .",
    "such close encounters early in the evolution tended to result in collisions .",
    "these tended to be avoided at later times so that tidal interaction might then result in orbital circularization at fixed pericentre distance leading to the formation of a very closely orbiting giant planet .",
    "typically the runs ended up with either ( i ) one potential hot jupiter plus up to two external companions , i.e. planets orbiting near the outer edge of the initial distribution ; ( ii ) one or two external planets or even none at all ; ( iii ) one planet on an orbit with a semi  major axis 10 to a 100 times smaller than the outer boundary radius of the inital distribution together with an external companion .",
    "apart from the potential hot jupiters , all these objects are on highly eccentric orbits .",
    "we found that , apart from the close orbiters , the probability of ending up with a planet orbiting at a given distance from the central star increases with the distance .",
    "the objects that become unbound may contribute to a population of freely floating planets ( lucas & roche 2000 , zapatero osorio et al .",
    "2000 ) which could be several times larger than that of giant planets found close to the central star .",
    "thus the dynamical relaxation process considered here may operate in some cases to produce giant planets with high orbital eccentricity at several astronomical units from their central star as well as closely orbiting planets . in all cases a population of loosely bound planets",
    "is also expected .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in section [ mod ]",
    "we describe the model and basic equations used . in section [ ini - bc ] the initial conditions are formulated and in section [ relax2 ] the physics of the relaxation process is discussed . in section [ results ]",
    "we present our numerical results and in section [ disc ] we summarize and discuss them .",
    "we consider a system consisting of @xmath7 planets and a primary star moving under their gravitational attraction .    as we are interested in possible close approaches to , or collisions with , the central star we adopt a spherical polar coordinate system @xmath9 with origin at the stellar centre .",
    "the planets and central star are treated as point masses .",
    "however , to take into account possible losses of orbital energy and angular momentum to the stellar material , a simple model for taking into account the tidal interaction between the star and a closely approaching planet is also included .",
    "the equations of motion are @xmath10 here @xmath11 and @xmath12 denote the mass of the central star , the mass of planet @xmath13 the position vector of planet , @xmath13 and @xmath14 respectively .",
    "the acceleration of the coordinate system based on the central star ( indirect term ) is @xmath15 and that due to tidal interaction with planet @xmath16 is @xmath17    in the situation envisaged here , tidal interactions occur when a planet has a close encounter with the star .",
    "when this occurs , the planet approaches from large distances on an almost parabolic orbit .",
    "the time between a subsequent encounters will then be long compared to that for the tidal interaction itself .",
    "accordingly we approximate the process as a sequence of independent energy and angular momentum transfers that occur at each periastron passage .",
    "we utilize the results of press & teukolsky ( 1977 ) who calculated these transfers in the small perturbation limit for a non rotating star modelled as a polytrope and a perturber on a parabolic orbit .",
    "we shall neglect the effects of tides acting on the planet itself .",
    "accordingly our model is simplified .",
    "however , it does enable us to include tidal effects and demonstrate how they start to lead to orbital circularization and gravitational decoupling of an inner planet from the others as it moves onto a close orbit .",
    "however , it is only applicable while the planet orbit has high eccentricity .",
    "we adopt a form for @xmath18 that is able to approximately give the correct angular momentum and energy exchanges with the star on a close approach but which is negligible at larger distances from the central star .",
    "@xmath19    here @xmath20 is the specific angular momentum of planet @xmath13 @xmath21 is the stellar radius , @xmath22 is the distance of closest approach of planet @xmath16 assuming a parabolic orbit , @xmath23 and @xmath24    the equations of motion are here integrated using the bulirsch - stoer method ( eg .",
    "press et al 1993 ) .    using ( [ ftidal ] )",
    "we can derive the energy lost to the star during a close encounter of planet @xmath16 , assumed on a parabolic orbit as @xmath25 where , because of the rapid convergence of the integral , the limits are extended to @xmath26 this gives @xmath27 which gives values coinciding approximately with values given by press & teukolsky(1977 ) .",
    "we comment that acording to ( [ de ] ) a star grazing encounter on a parabolic orbit results in a final semi - major axis @xmath28 for a central solar mass with @xmath29 and @xmath30 @xmath31  au .",
    "thus bound orbits with @xmath32  au are significantly modified if they have a close encounter with the central star .",
    "note too that the energy exchange rates are small for the planetary mass objects considered here giving some justification for the linear approximation used to calculate them .",
    "the simulations performed here were begun by placing @xmath7 planets in some specified volume in a random location chosen to give a monte - carlo realization of a prescribed density distribution .",
    "we considered both the case of a uniform density spherical shell with @xmath33 and that of a thick annulus with @xmath33 occupying @xmath34 with a density @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the spherical radius and @xmath37 the co  latitude .",
    "for the calculations presented here , @xmath38 and @xmath39 for the annulus and the spherical shell , respectively .",
    "the planets were then given the local circular velocity in the azimuthal direction .",
    "note that because of the spatial placements the initial orbits are not coplanar . in some cases",
    "the planets were taken to have equal mass @xmath2 while in others each planet was allocated a mass @xmath40 where @xmath41 was a random number between zero and one . in the latter case",
    "the mass distribution of the protoplanets does not correspond to the specified density distribution indicating some redistribution of mass among the embryos .    in general",
    "the various initial conditions we have considered lead to the same qualitative evolution .",
    "however , it must be emphasized that the systems are chaotic with the consequence that very small detailed changes to the initial conditions or the integration procedure will in general lead to very different results in detail . to deal with this issue",
    "one can adopt the notion of shadow orbits ( quinlan & tremaine 1992 ) . according to this",
    ", one can expect that although inevitable small errors lead to a significant deviation of the numerical solution from the actual one , there is another solution of the real system obtained with slightly different initial conditions that remains close to the numerical one .",
    "thus we should be able to identify qualitative trends in the evolution of an ensemble of systems of the type we consider and we restrict ourselves to that .",
    "we comment that the equations we solve , incorporating tidal effects , have a radial scale invariance .",
    "thus all radii may be mutiplied by some factor @xmath42 while the timescales are multiplied by @xmath43 the size of the central star has to be scaled by the factor @xmath42 also . here",
    "we shall take the unit of length to be @xmath44 .",
    "then the stellar radius is specified through @xmath45 the time unit is the period of a circular orbit at @xmath46 @xmath47 the interactions amongst the planets lead to some escaping the system",
    ". objects with positive energy which had reached a distance @xmath48 were considered to be escapers . we have considered @xmath49 and @xmath50 which both lead to the same qualitative picture .",
    "even the systems which have a small number of bodies are found to interact strongly and to undergo relaxation like a stellar system ( binney & tremanine 1987 ) .",
    "for such a system the realaxation time is @xmath51 here the root mean square velocity is @xmath52 @xmath53 is the mass density of interacting bodies assumed for simplicity to have equal mass @xmath2 , and @xmath54    using @xmath55 @xmath56 and adopting the orbital period @xmath57 this becomes    @xmath58    thus for @xmath59 and @xmath60 the relaxation time is about @xmath61 orbits . for systems with @xmath62 in the @xmath61  au to @xmath63  au range this time is around @xmath64  y which is within the estimated lifetimes of protostellar discs .",
    "the evolution we obtain is similar to that undergone by spherical star clusters ( binney & tremaine 1987 ) .",
    "the relaxation , due to binary encounters , causes some objects to attain escape velocity while others become more bound .",
    "eventually all either escape or end up in extended orbits , except for one body which takes up all the binding energy .",
    "this is a generic result provided that close encounters with the star can be avoided .",
    "however , for the parameter range of interest such encounters are likely .",
    "the situation resembles that of accretion of stars from a spherical star cluster by a black hole ( eg",
    ". frank & rees 1976 ) . at a location with radius @xmath65 the fractional volume of phase space containing orbits that would collide with the star if unperturbed is @xmath66 ( this being the ratio of the square of the angular momentum below which an impact is expected to the square of the mean angular momentum ) . if an object can not diffuse out of this volume before impact , the mean time before diffusion into the effective volume produces an impact , for a particular object , is @xmath67 however , the time to diffuse out of the effective volume is @xmath68",
    "if this time is less than the crossing time @xmath69 the expected mean time to impact is @xmath70 this time is just the crossing time divided by the probability of being in the effective volume of phase space which is regularly sampled because of the effective diffusion ( see frank & rees 1976 ) .    in our calculations the innermost most tightly bound object undergoes relaxation or phase space diffusion which can lead to close encounters . for @xmath71",
    "au , @xmath72  y , and @xmath73  cm , @xmath74  y. thus we can expect close encounters to occur within the general relaxation process .",
    "in some cases these can lead to a strong tidal interaction which can circularize the orbit and potentially lead to the formation of a hot jupiter.",
    "we here describe a sample of our results which illustrate the characteristic behaviour exhibited by the systems we consider .",
    "the calculations presented are listed in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "we note that if @xmath44 = 100  au , @xmath75 or @xmath76 corresponds to @xmath77 or 3  r@xmath78 , respectively , which is the radius of a protostar with a mass around 1  m@xmath78 in the early stages .",

    "each line corresponds to a different planet . during the run 3 planets",
    "escape , a line terminating just prior to an escape .",
    "for this case @xmath92 so that there was no tidal interaction with the central star .",
    "the initial relaxation time for this and other similar cases is on the order of @xmath93 , in agreement with equation  ( [ relax1 ] ) . the evolution of @xmath94 @xmath95 being the pericentre distance and @xmath96 being the eccentricity , is also shown in figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "we see that approaches to within @xmath97 of the central star occur for the innermost object on a timescale of the same order of magnitude as the relaxation time .",
    "this is a common feature of the simulations presented here .",
    "note that for @xmath98  au , the closest approach is to within @xmath99  cm , which is comparable to a solar radius .",
    "after about @xmath100 , the main relaxation is over with nearly all the binding energy being contained within one object with @xmath101 and @xmath102 however , after about @xmath103 , the two innermost planets have a close approach which results in their position being exchanged and one of them being ejected .",
    "the end result of this run is then two planets on well separated orbits .",
    "the innermost planet has @xmath101 and @xmath104    a plot of the evolution of the semi  major axes and pericenter distances versus time ( measured in units of @xmath91 ) for run  2 in table  [ tab1 ] is given in figure  [ fig2 ] .",
    "for this run the initial number of planets is @xmath105 and @xmath106 so that tidal effects operate .",
    "after about @xmath107 , there are only two planets still bound to the star .",
    "the others have been ejected .",
    "the innermost planet which is left has @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",
    "if @xmath110  au , this corresponds to @xmath111  au .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] shows the evolution of the semi  major axes and pericenter distances versus time ( measured in units of @xmath91 ) for run  3 in table  [ tab1 ] . for this run @xmath105 and @xmath112 the plot terminates at about @xmath113 , just before the innermost planet has a close encounter with the star .",
    "the evolution toward the end of the run is zoomed on in figure  [ fig3b ] .",
    "we see that the semi  major axis decreases significantly , down to about @xmath114 , whereas the pericenter distance varies much less .",
    "this indicates a tidal interaction with the star .",
    "the run if continued much further becomes innaccurate because of our crude treatment of tides , as mentionned in section  [ mod ] .",
    "we expect at that point the orbit to circularize at fixed pericentre distance .",
    "evolution of this type which is also quite common in our simulations could potentially lead to a hot jovian mass planet.    figure  [ fig4 ] shows the evolution of the semi  major axes and pericenter distances versus time ( measured in units of @xmath91 ) for run  4 in table  [ tab1 ] . in this case @xmath115,@xmath116 and the masses were selected uniformly at random in the interval @xmath117 here again , after about @xmath118 there are only two planets still bound to the star .",
    "the innermost planet has @xmath119 and @xmath120 , which would correspond to 4  au in a 100  au annulus .",
    "we now consider runs with larger @xmath121 figure  [ fig5 ] shows the evolution of semi - major axes and pericenter distances versus time ( measured in units of @xmath91 ) for run  5 in table  [ tab1 ] . in this case @xmath122 and @xmath123 . in that case",
    "also there are only two planets bound to the star after about @xmath124 .",
    "the others have either been ejected or have collided with the central star .",
    "our treatment of tides is too crude to be certain about the orbital evolution of planets on very eccentric orbits which have grazing approaches to the star . in our simulations ,",
    "such approaches result in the planet being lost .",
    "as far as the subsequent evolution of the system is concerned however , it does not matter whether the planet indeed hits the star of gets circularized on a close orbit . in this run",
    ", evolution occurs on a shorter timescale due to the larger number of planets . here",
    "the innermost planet has @xmath125 and @xmath126 , which is 3  au if @xmath110  au .",
    "figure  [ fig6 ] shows the evolution of the semi  major axes versus time ( measured in units of @xmath91 ) for the only 2 planets in the system which have not either been ejected or collided with the central star after about 180  @xmath91 , for run  6 in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "also shown are the pericenter distance and the apocenter distance for these planets . here",
    "@xmath127 , @xmath123 and the masses were selected uniformly at random in the interval @xmath128 we see from figure  [ fig6 ] that at a time of about @xmath129 the apocenter and the pericenter of the innermost and outermost planets , respectively , are very close to each other .",
    "the innermost planet then suffers a gravitational scattering by the more massive outermost planet which results in an increase of its eccentricity and eventually a collision with the central star .",
    "we are then left with one planet with @xmath130 and @xmath131 .",
    "we have considered the orbital evolution of @xmath7 bodies with masses in the giant planet range , which are assumed to have formed rapidly enough that they can undergo subsequent dynamical relaxation on a timescale @xmath1 orbits .",
    "we have considered @xmath132 we assume that rapid formation may occur as a result of fragmentation triggered by gravitational instabilities or clumping , either in a spherical envelope during the initial protostellar collapse phase or in a disc like configuration ( e.g. pudritz et al 1996 ) as that forms . but note that as magnetic fields may play a role the disc may not be entirely centrifugally supported .",
    "we have considered initial distributions of planets with masses in the range 5 to 10 jupiter masses that are in the form of a sphericalshell or are disc like .",
    "however , final outcomes are independent of this . in our calculations , along with previous work related to the core accretion model ( weidenschilling & mazari 1996 , rasio & ford 1996 , lin & ida 1997 ) we neglect the effects of gas , thus the efficiency of fragmentation is assumed to be maximal .    although our results can be applied to different radial scales , we focus the discussion below on distributions with an outer radius of 100  au this is the dimension of observed protostellar discs in class 0 objects ( eg . pudritz et al 1996 )",
    ".    this work has been partly motivated by the suggestion by black ( 1997 ) and stepinski  & black ( 2000 ) that some massive extrasolar planets could actually belong to the low  mass tail of the distribution of low  mass companions to solar  like stars .",
    "that suggestion is derived from the observation that extrasolar planets far enough from the star that tidal circularization does not operate tend to have highly eccentric orbits and that these could be produced by a relaxation process of the type we consider .",
    "altogether we have run about 25 cases with @xmath133 and many more with @xmath134",
    ". we have described six representative runs in detail in the paper .",
    "independently of how many planets we began with , the initial set up and the technical details of the computation , we obtained the same sets of characteristic behaviour and end states . in every case",
    "most of the planets where ejected from the system and at most 3 planets remained bound to the central star after a time typically on the order of a few @xmath135 outer periods @xmath91 .",
    "the dynamical relaxation phase is shorter when the initial number of planets is larger , but when the number of planets is reduced to less than 10 the system evolves in the same way as the systems which had a smaller intital number of planets .",
    "we found that close encounters with the central star often occured ( for about 10% of the planets ) for all values of @xmath7 considered . at an early stage these tended to result in direct collisions .",
    "when a direct collision is avoided , tidal interaction between the star and planet on a very ecentric orbit may result in orbital circularization at fixed pericentre distance which might ultimately lead to the formation of a very closely orbiting giant planet .",
    "as far as we could monitor the runs presented here , we did not find any physical collisions between the planets themselves .",
    "this is consistent with lin  & ida ( 1997 ) who found that such collisions were very rare when , as here , mutual tidal interactions between the planets were assumed to be ineffective .",
    "if physical collisions were to occur , they would not be expected to affect the typical outcome of our runs .",
    "typically the runs ended up with either ( i ) one potential hot jupiter plus up to two external companions , i.e. planets orbiting near the edge of the initial distribution ; ( ii ) one or two external planets or even none at all since a gravitational scattering between two planets may result in one being ejected and the other one colliding with the star ; ( iii ) one planet on an orbit with a semi  major axis 10 to a 100 times smaller than the inital distribution , e.g. @xmath13610  au for a 100  au distribution , plus one external companion .",
    "apart from the potential hot jupiters , all these objects are on highly eccentric orbits .",
    "we found that , apart for the hot jupiters , the probability of ending up with a planet orbiting at a given distance from the central star increases with the distance .",
    "thus , this scenario produces a decreasing number of planets as we go from 100  au down to 0.1  au .",
    "this is expected since a planet on a highly eccentric orbit has more chance of colliding with the central star as it gets closer to it .",
    "paradoxically the action of the central star tends to clear out a large cavity around it .",
    "we now turn to the characteristics of some of the extrasolar planets detected so far .",
    "we restrict our attention to those with a projected mass @xmath137  m@xmath4 , consistent with the larger masses expected for formation through fragmentation .",
    "there are 7 such isolated objects around hd  190228 , ua3 , hd  2222582 , hd  10697 , 70  vir , hd  89744 and hd  114762 .",
    "all have an eccentricity larger than 0.12 , and for 6 of them @xmath138 .",
    "major axis is in the range 0.882.5 for 5 of the objects , while the others have @xmath139 and 0.43 , respectively .",
    "the characteristics of these planets might be accounted for by our scenario though the two cases with small @xmath90 would only occur with a small probability .    amongst the hot jupiters detected so far , @xmath140 boo is particularly massive with @xmath141 this planet is clearly a candidate for being produced by a mechanism of the type we consider .    the objects expelled as a result of the type of relaxation process we consider may produce a population of freely floating planets ( lucas & roche 2000 , zapatero osorio et al .",
    "2000 ) which is several times larger than that of giant planets close to the central star .",
    "this population would be expected to be typically at least 10 times larger than the population of massive planets orbiting around the star , and depends on the initial number of planets in the distribution .",
    "however , note that the population of planets orbiting central stars that went through a relaxation process of the type we consider may be significantly smaller than the total if planets are also independently formed through a core accretion process .",
    "the model we have considered in this paper has of course some limitations .",
    "in particular , we have not included the effect of gas which is probably still significant in the early stages of evolution of these systems , and which may result in more planets orbiting at smaller distances from the central star .",
    "also we have not considered the effects of roche lobe overflow for the planets which have a close encounter with the central star ( trilling et al .",
    "1998 ) which may significantly reduce their mass .",
    "the considerations above lead to the suggestion that there may be two populations amongst the extrasolar planets detected so far .",
    "some of the more massive objects may be produced through fragmentation of an envelope or a disc  like structure followed by dynamical relaxation .",
    "other predominantly lower mass objects could be produced in a disc as a result of the core accretion model .",

    "<S> following the suggestion of black(1997 ) that some massive extrasolar planets may be associated with the tail of the distribution of stellar companions , we investigate a scenario in which @xmath0 planetary mass objects are assumed to form rapidly through a fragmentation process occuring in a disc or protostellar envelope on a scale of 100  au . </S>",
    "<S> these are assumed to have formed rapidly enough through gravitational instability or fragmentation that their orbits can undergo dynamical relaxation on a timescale @xmath1 orbits .    under a wide range of initial conditions and assumptions </S>",
    "<S> the relaxation process ends with either ( i ) one potential hot jupiter plus up to two external companions , i.e. planets orbiting near the outer edge of the initial distribution ; ( ii ) one or two external planets or even none at all ; ( iii ) one planet on an orbit with a semi  major axis 10 to a 100 times smaller than the outer boundary radius of the inital distribution together with an external companion . </S>",
    "<S> most of the other objects are ejected and could contribute to a population of free floating planets . </S>",
    "<S> apart from the potential hot jupiters , all the bound objects are on highly eccentric orbits . </S>",
    "<S> we found that , apart from the close orbiters , the probability of ending up with a planet orbiting at a given distance from the central star increases with the distance . </S>",
    "<S> this is because of the tendency of the relaxation process to lead to collisions with the central star .    </S>",
