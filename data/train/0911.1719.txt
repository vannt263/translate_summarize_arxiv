    "group field theories ( gft s ) or quantum field theories over group manifolds were introduced in the beginning of the 90 s @xcite as generalizations of matrix and tensor field theories @xcite .",
    "they are currently under active investigation as they provide one of the most complete definition for spin foam models , themselves acknowledged as good candidates for a background independent quantum theory of gravity @xcite .",
    "also they are more and more studied _ per se _ as a full theory of quantum gravity @xcite .",
    "gft s are gauge invariant theories characterized by a non - local interaction which pairs the field arguments in a dual way to the gluing of simplicial complexes . hence , the feynman diagrams of a gft are fat graphs , and their duals are triangulations of ( pseudo)manifolds made of vertices , edges , faces and higher dimensional simplices discretizing a particular spacetime .",
    "the first and simplest gft s @xcite have feynman amplitudes which are products of delta functions on the holonomies of a group connection associated to the faces of the feynman diagram .",
    "these amplitudes are therefore discretizations of the topological bf theory .",
    "but the gft is more than simply its perturbative feynman amplitudes .",
    "a quantum field theory formulated by a functional integral also assigns a precise weight to each feynman graph , and should resum all such graphs .",
    "in particular , it sums over different spacetime topologies thus providing a so - called `` third quantization '' .",
    "however a difficulty occurs , shared by other discrete approaches to quantum gravity : since a gft sums over arbitrary spacetime topologies , it is not clear how the low energy description of such a theory would lead to a smooth and large manifold , namely our classical spacetime ( see @xcite for more details ) .    in order to overcome this difficulty we propose to include the requirement of renormalizability as a guide @xcite .",
    "the declared goal would be to find , using a novel scale analysis , which of the gft models leads to a physically relevant situation after passing through the renormalization group analysis .",
    "let us mention that a number of non - local noncommutative quantum field theories have been successfully renormalized in the recent years ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "even though the gft s graphs are more complicated than the ribbon graphs of noncommutative field theories , one can hope to extend to gft s some of the tools forged to renormalize these noncommutative quantum field theories .",
    "recent works have addressed the first steps of a renormalization program for gft s @xcite and for spin foam models @xcite combining topological and asymptotic large spin ( also called `` ultraspin '' ) analysis of the amplitudes .",
    "a first systematic analysis of the boulatov model was started in @xcite .",
    "the authors have identified a specific class of graphs called `` type i '' for which a complete procedure of contraction is possible .",
    "the exact power counting for these graphs has been established .",
    "they also formulated the conjecture that these graphs dominate in the ultraspin regime .",
    "the boulatov model was also considered in @xcite as well as its freidel - louapre constructive regularization @xcite . here , feynman amplitudes have been studied in the large cutoff limit and their optimal bounds have been found ( at least for graphs without generalized tadpoles , see appendix below ) .",
    "these bounds show that the freidel - louapre model is perturbatively more divergent than the ordinary one . at the constructive field theory level ,",
    "borel summability of the connected functions in the coupling constant has been established via a convergent `` cactus '' expansion , together with the correct scaling of the borel radius .",
    "these two seminal works on the general scaling properties in gft @xcite were restricted to three dimensions .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to extend the perturbative bounds of @xcite to any dimension .",
    "a difficulty ( which was overlooked in @xcite , see the appendix of this paper ) comes from the fact that the power counting of the most general topological models is governed by `` generalized tadpoles '' .    in the mean time , a fermionic colored gft model possessing a @xmath10 symmetry in dimension",
    "@xmath11 has been introduced by gurau @xcite , together with the homology theory of the corresponding colored graphs . in contradistinction with the general bosonic theory ,",
    "the `` bubbles '' of this theory can be easily identified and tadpoles simply do not occur .",
    "apart from the @xmath10 symmetry , these nice features are shared by the bosonic version of this colored model , which is the one considered in this paper .",
    "we prove that a vacuum graph of such a theory is bounded in dimension 4 by @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the `` ultraspin '' cutoff and @xmath14 the number of vertices of the graph . for any dimension",
    "@xmath11 , similar bounds are also derived .",
    "we also take the first steps towards the constructive analysis of the model .",
    "the paper s organization is as follows .",
    "section 2 is devoted to the definition of the colored models , the statement of some properties of their feynman graphs , and the perturbative bounds which can be proved in any dimension .",
    "section 3 further analyses the model by integrating out two particular colors .",
    "this leads to a matthews - salam formulation which reveals an interesting hidden positivity of the model encouraging for a constructive analysis .",
    "a conclusion is provided in section 4 and an appendix discusses the not yet understood case of graphs with tadpoles in general gft s .",
    "in this section , we introduce the colored ooguri model or colored @xmath15 bf theory in four dimensions is chosen here for simplicity .",
    "the @xmath16 or @xmath17 @xmath18 theories could be treated along the same lines .",
    "supplemented with plebanski constraints they are a starting point for four dimensional quantum gravity . ] . some useful ( feynman )",
    "graphical properties are stated and allow us to bound a general feynman amplitude .",
    "these bounds are then generalized to any dimension .",
    "the dynamical variables of a @xmath11 dimensional gft are fields , defined over @xmath11 copies of a group @xmath19 . for the moment , let us specialize to @xmath20 and @xmath21 , hence to ooguri - type models .    in the colored bosonic model ,",
    "these fields are themselves @xmath22 complex valued functions @xmath23 , @xmath24 . the upper index @xmath25 denotes the color index of the field @xmath26 .",

    "the corresponding monomials @xmath35 and @xmath36 are @xmath37 invariant . in the bosonic model , this invariance",
    "is lost as the monomials are only invariant under transformations with permanent 1 , which do not form a group .",

    ", we illustrate the particular features of this duality in the above colored model .    associating the field @xmath23 to a tetrahedron or 3-simplex with its group element arguments @xmath49 representing its faces ( triangles )",
    ", then it is well known that the order of arguments of the fields in the quintic interactions ( [ action ] ) follows the pattern of the gluing of the five tetrahedra @xmath50 , along one of their faces in order to build a 4-simplex or pentachore ( see fig.2 ) .",
    "besides , the propagator can be seen as the gluing rule for two tetrahedra belonging to two neighboring pentachores . for the bf theory this gluing is made so that each face is flat . in the present situation , the model ( [ action ] ) adds new features in the theory : the fields are complex valued and colored .",
    "consequently , we can represent the complex nature of the fields by a specific orientation of the propagators ( big arrows in fig.1 ) and the color feature of the fields is reflected by a specific numbering ( from 1 to 5 , see fig.2 ) of the legs of the vertex .",
    "hence , the only admissible propagation should be between a field @xmath51 and @xmath23 of the same color index , and `` physically '' it means that only tetrahedra of the same color belonging to two neighboring pentachores can be glued together .",
    "finally , given a propagator with color @xmath52 , it has itself sub - colored lines ( called sometimes `` strands '' ) that we write cyclically @xmath53 , and the gluing also respects these subcolors ( because our model does not include any permutation symmetry of the strands ) .",
    "let us enumerate some useful properties of the colored graphs .",
    "the following lemmas hold .",
    "[ lem1 ] given a @xmath54-point graph with @xmath14 internal vertices , if one color is missing on the external legs , then    1 .",
    "@xmath14 is a even number ; 2 .",
    "@xmath54 is also even and external legs have colors which appear in pair .    *",
    "* let us consider a @xmath54-point graph with @xmath14 internal vertices .",
    "consequently , one has @xmath14 fields for each color .",
    "since one color is missing on the external legs , and since by parity , any contraction creating an internal line consumes two fields of the same color , the full contraction process for that missing color consumes all the @xmath14 fields of that color and an even number of fields .",
    "hence @xmath14 must be even .",
    "this proves the point @xmath55 .",
    "we prove now the point @xmath56 .",
    "we know that the number @xmath14 of internal vertices is even .",
    "now , if a color on the external legs appears an odd number of times , the complete internal contraction for that color would involve an odd number of fields hence would be impossible .",
    "an interesting corollary is that for @xmath58 the conclusions of lemma [ lem1 ] must hold .",
    "in particular the colored theory in dimension @xmath11 has no odd point functions with less than @xmath11 arguments .",
    "for example , the colored ooguri model in four dimensions has no one and three point functions .",
    "this property is reminiscent of ordinary even field theories like the @xmath59 model which has also neither one nor three point functions .",
    "it may simplify considerably the future analysis of renormalizable models of this type .",
    "we recall that in a colored gft model ,    1 .   a face ( or closed cycle )",
    "is bi - colored with an even number of lines ; 2 .",
    "a chain ( opened cycle ) of length @xmath60 is bi - colored .",
    "this is in fact the definition of a face in @xcite but can also be easily deduced from the fact that each strand in a line @xmath61 joining a vertex @xmath62 to a vertex @xmath63 possesses a double label that we denote by @xmath64 ( see fig .",
    "2 ) : @xmath65 is the color index of @xmath61 and @xmath66 denotes the color of the line @xmath67 after the vertex @xmath68 , where the strand @xmath69 will propagate . in short ,",
    "a vertex connects in a unique way , the strand @xmath69 of the line @xmath70 to the strand @xmath71 of the line @xmath72 .",
    "the point is that , in return , the strand @xmath71 belonging to @xmath67 can only be connected to a strand of the form @xmath69 in a line @xmath73 through another vertex @xmath74 .",
    "hence only chains of the bi - colored form @xmath75 ( for closed cycles ) and @xmath76 ( for open chains ) could be obtained .",
    "closed cycles include clearly an even number of lines . @xmath57",
    "a generalized tadpole is a @xmath77-point graph with only one external vertex ( see fig.3 ) .    in the case of a generalized tadpole with one external leg , that external leg must contract to a single vertex , creating a new tadpole but with four external legs .",
    "[ theo1 ] there is no generalized tadpole in the colored ooguri group field model",
    ".    * proof .",
    "* by definition , a generalized tadpole is a @xmath77-point graph , meaning that at least one of the colors is missing on the external legs .",
    "then , lemma [ lem1 ] tells us that @xmath54 should be even ( @xmath78 or @xmath79 ) and the external colors appear in pairs .",
    "having in mind that , still by definition , an ordinary vertex of the colored theory has no common color in its fields , the external vertex of a generalized tadpole having colors appearing in pairs can not be an ordinary colored vertex .",
    "@xmath57    hence , the colored ooguri model has no generalized tadpole and so , _ a fortiori _ , no tadpole .",
    "this property does not actually depend on the dimension .",
    "the same strategy as in @xcite is used in order to determine the types of vertex operators from which the feynman amplitude of a general vacuum graph will be bounded in the next subsection .",

    "hence this method opens a constructive perspective for colored gft in any dimension .",
    "this perspective is distinct or could be a complement to the freidel - louapre approach .",

    "we have shown that , in dimension @xmath11 , the scaling of the amplitude of any vacuum graph , in the `` ultraspin '' cutoff @xmath13 , behaves like @xmath253 where @xmath14 is the number of vertices .",
    "in addition , it has been revealed that , by an integration of two colors , the model is positive if the coupling constant is purely imaginary .",
    "we did not need further regularization procedure , such as an inclusion of a freidel - louapre interaction term which in return may be more divergent than the ordinary theory . using a loop vertex expansion ,",
    "we have reached the property that for at least the constant modes of the fields the forest - tree formula leads to a convergent series ( which should be the borel - le roy sum of appropriate order of the ordinary perturbation series ) .",
    "these results are encouraging for a constructive program .",
    "the bounds obtained in this paper for colored gft models should now be completed into a more precise power counting and scaling analysis .",
    "they should also be extended to the physically more interesting models in particular the so called eprl - fk model @xcite .",
    "we recall that the most simple divergencies of the eprl - fk model have been studied in @xcite .",
    "this work analyzes the elementary `` bubble '' ( built out of two vertices ) corresponding to the one - loop self - energy correction and the `` ball '' ( built out of five vertices ) , corresponding to the one - loop vertex correction .",
    "the authors prove that putting the external legs at zero spin , the degree of divergence in the cutoff of the ball could be logarithmic .",
    "this result sounds very promising from the renormalization point of view .",
    "the first step in this program is to establish the power counting of a simplified colored ooguri model with commutative group , which we call `` linearized '' colored ooguri model .",
    "we checked that power counting in this case is given by a homology formula @xcite .",
    "then we intend to perform a similar analysis of the colored linearized eprl - fk model , and find out the analogs of the multiscale renormalization group analysis in this context .",
    "this should help for the more complicated study of the  non - linear  models in which homotopy rather than homology should ultimately govern the power counting .",
    "the work of j.b.g . is supported by the laboratoire de physique thorique dorsay ( lpto , universit paris sud xi ) and the association pour la promotion scientifique de lafrique ( apsa ) . discussions with r. gurau are gratefully acknowledged , which in particular lead to the representation of section 3 .",
    "in this appendix , we give some precisions on the scaling properties of amplitudes of graphs containing generalized tadpoles as occur in the non colored gft",
    ". we will restrict the discussion to the case of dimension 3 @xcite but similar properties definitely appear in greater dimension .    referring to @xcite ,",
    "the vertex operators of boulatov s model are bounded by @xmath174 such that any connected vacuum graph without generalized tadpoles is bounded by @xmath254 ( omitting the overall trace factor ) , @xmath14 being as usual the number of vertices .",
    "however , nothing more can be said in the case of graphs with generalized tadpoles .",
    "for instance , there exist non - planar tadpoles ( see fig.9 ) which contribute more than @xmath174 per vertex .",
    "indeed , in the typical situation of fig.9 , these tadpoles cost a factor @xmath255 per vertex , and violate the ordinary vertex bound .",
    "finally , one concludes that the bounds of @xcite are correct for vacuum graphs without generalized tadpoles , such as the vacuum graphs that occur in the colored models , but that , when tadpoles are present , they are wrong for the most general model . in any non - colored case and any dimension , we can expect similar features .",
