    "one - dimensional ( @xmath2d ) quantum systems are known to be very peculiar due to strong quantum fluctuations that prohibit long - range order and can give rise to unusual phases of matter . in this context , it is remarkable that quantum spin chains fall generically into two classes regarding their low - energy properties  @xcite : ( i ) critical behavior where gapless low - energy excitations can be described in the framework of tomonaga - luttinger liquid ( tll ) theory ; ( ii ) gapped behavior .",
    "nevertheless , condensed - matter experiments are mostly done on _",
    "quasi_-@xmath2d materials , hence the role of small inter - chain couplings ( as compared to the dominant 1d energy scale @xmath3 ) may become important at low - enough temperature ( eventually leading to magnetic ordering ) .",
    "conversely , at high temperature ( @xmath4 ) , quantum fluctuations vanish so that a classical picture emerges . as a consequence , for realistic experimental systems the validity of a universal @xmath2d tll regime is not granted and should be checked in some unbiased way . in particular , understanding the intermediate temperature regime @xmath5 , highly relevant to understand several experimental data , is a great theoretical challenge regarding dynamical observables .    in this paper , we focus on nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) for quantum spin systems  @xcite , and more specifically on the @xmath0 spin - lattice relaxation rate .",
    "indeed , this quantity contains lots of information on the dynamical properties of the system since it is directly related to dynamical spin - spin correlations .",
    "moreover , being a local quantity ( a crucial property of nmr technique ) , we will argue that reliable data can be obtained even though we will simulate finite spin chains .",
    "being of fundamental interest , the low-@xmath6 behavior of the nmr relaxation rate has been investigated for several 1d or quasi-1d quantum magnets .",

    "another route to tll behavior is to apply an external magnetic field on gapped materials such as spin-@xmath2 haldane gap compound  @xcite ( ch@xmath8)@xmath13nni(no@xmath7)@xmath8 or dimerized spin-@xmath1 chains  @xcite . for such systems ,",

    "@xmath0 measurements could be interpreted either as coming from magnon ( respectively spinon ) excitations in the gapped ( respectively gapless ) @xmath2d phase , and the quantum critical regime was also argued to be universal .",
    "most importantly , the whole temperature range , including @xmath2d as well as @xmath15d regimes , was discussed .    experimentally , when decreasing temperature , the nmr relaxation rate @xmath0 has been found to diverge in the tll regime , with power - law governed by a characteristic exponent .",

    "however , given that we are generically dealing with quasi-@xmath2d materials , critical fluctuations and @xmath15d ordering will limit the low - energy @xmath2d regime , and a genuine tll critical behavior is observable only within some finite window in temperature .",

    ", it becomes increasingly difficult to reach low temperatures .",
    "indeed , one expects a volume - law entanglement entropy ( _ i.e. _ linear with the system size @xmath117 ) due to the auxiliary sites which are used to purify the thermal state . as a consequence ,",
    "the number of kept states @xmath127 needed to describe accurately the system will grow exponentially as the temperature @xmath6 decreases .    on the other hand , the maximal ( real ) time that can be reached is of the order of few tens of @xmath149 typically , for similar reasons as discussed above , namely the linear growth of entanglement entropy with time  @xcite .",

    "last , although its use did not prove to be systematically reliable in our case , we would like to mention the possibility to use so - called _ linear prediction _ technique , coming from data analysis  @xcite which aims at predicting `` longer time '' behavior from the knowledge of dynamical correlations at `` intermediate time '' .",

    "indeed , the mps estimates agree perfectly with the exact expressions ( see appendix  [ app : xx ] ) .    first of all , we consider the local dynamical correlation of the site in the middle of the chain reducing de facto boundary effects .",

    "[ fig : dtn_t1_para ] , the 3d bec ordering observed in dtn  @xcite for @xmath214 at @xmath215 occurs _ above _ the asymptotic regime where the genuine tll power - law behavior is expected .",
    "it is therefore impossible to directly extract tll exponents in dtn , because of interchain effects that eventually lead to an ordering of the coupled tlls .",

    "concerning the difficulty to obtain reliable data at high temperature for the longitudinal @xmath109 , it is well known that this is due to spin diffusion - like behavior  @xcite .",
    "therefore , measurements should in principle depend explicitly on the nmr frequency @xmath64 .",
    "performing time - dependent numerical simulations at finite temperature on @xmath2d systems to compute the nmr relaxation rate @xmath0 , we have discussed the temperature range validity of analytical predictions for two models ( i ) the paradigmatic example for tomonaga - lutinger liquids : the spin-@xmath1 xxz chain for various ising anisotropies , and ( ii ) a more realistic @xmath36 hamiltonian , relevant for experiments on the dtn compound as a function of an external magnetic field .    both models present in some regime a gapless phase that can be described by tll `` _ _ low - energy _",

    "we observed that the expected power - law behavior occurs only below @xmath219 , thus defining the low - energy limit of validity of tll theory an order of magnitude below the energy scale @xmath220 of the system .",
    "it is important to be able to define this limit as tll predictions are often used experimentally on quasi-1d compounds to extract the value of @xmath19 . as a consequence",
    ", we believe that it remains experimentally challenging  @xcite , and often impossible , to explore a genuine critical @xmath2d regime in quasi-@xmath2d compounds when @xmath220 is small and @xmath15d ordering prevents a wide tll regime .",
    "for instance , we have shown that for dtn , the bec ordering temperature is larger than the crossover temperature towards tll behavior .",
    "we have also studied the transverse relaxation rates of these two models in other regimes than tll theory .",
    "first , we considered high temperatures , with a peculiar non - monotonic behavior in the @xmath54 xxz model in the repulsive regime at high @xmath6 , which does not exist for the 1d @xmath36 model of dtn .",
    "however , such a non - monotonic dependence with temperature at high @xmath6 is experimentally observed in dtn .",
    "we showed that this effect comes from the parallel contribution of the relaxation rate @xmath109 dominating at high temperature over the transverse part .",
    "finally , we verified that in gapped phases the relaxation rates are exponentially suppressed @xmath221 and can indeed lead to accurate determinations of the spin gap , at least in a regime of temperature @xmath222 since other relaxation mechanisms can change the activated behavior at higher temperature .    we want to emphasize again the role of @xmath15d ordering at finite temperature , preventing the observation of a @xmath2d tll regime .",
    "as discussed for the particular case of dtn , one needs a hierarchy of energy scale @xmath216 to be able to directly extract the tll exponent @xmath19 from the divergence of @xmath61 with @xmath6 .",
    "concerning future advances for quasi-1d systems , we can envision trying to simulate imaginary - time dynamics using quantum monte - carlo techniques , provided that the model has no minus - sign problem .",
    "while it will be necessary to perform a numerical analytic continuation ( using for instance maximum entropy techniques ) , we have some hope that this could lead to reliable results to quantitatively capture the influence of interchain effects . for 1d chains",

    ", our extensive @xmath2d results could serve as useful benchmarks for that too .",
