    "the observed ratio of the ultraviolet   uv emission flux ( 2000@xmath03000   ; hereafter ( uv ) ) to that of the resonance doublet at 2800   in broad - line regions ( blrs ) of quasars has a strong potential for being a fundamental cosmological metallicity indicator . in models of galactic chemical evolution ,",
    "the ratio of fe to @xmath1-element ( o , ne , mg ) abundances constrains the ages of star - forming systems ( wheeler et al .",
    "the fe/@xmath1 age constraint follows from a different enrichment timescale , namely : @xmath1-elements are produced in supernova explosions of short - lived massive stars ( primarily sn type ii ) , while fe has a large contribution from the longer - lived intermediate - mass binaries that produce type ia supernovae .",
    "predictions indicate that the fe/@xmath1 abundance ratio should increase by more than an order of magnitude for stellar systems older than 1 gyr ( hamann & ferland 1993 ; yoshii et al .",
    "however , if star formation has a significant contribution from very massive objects ( @xmath3 ) as suggested recently ( heger & woosley 2002 ) , then substantial fe production can occur at times earlier than 1 gyr",
    ". the answer to whether the fe/@xmath1 abundance ratio has a sharp break at 1 gyr has important consequences not only for the evolution of the elements , but possibly for understanding the formation of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) as well .",
    "whether the fe/@xmath1 enrichment is due to sn ia or sn ii explosions is a key problem to be addressed in constructing our picture of galactic evolution in the early universe .",
    "the delay time in fe enrichment can be estimated from observations by plotting the observed ( uv)/ emission ratio ( or the fe / mg abundance ) as a function of redshift .",
    "recent ( uv)/ emission ratio measurements ( e.g. iwamuro et al .",
    "2002 ; dietrich et al . 2002 ; freudling et al .",
    "2003 ) show a wide range of values .",
    "that obscures any dependence on redshift .",
    "it is still unclear : ( 1 ) whether a dependence on redshift exists ; and ( 2 ) whether the derived observed / values are sensitive to other physical parameters besides fe abundance .",
    "how the observed ( uv)/ emission ratio varies with physical conditions must be resolved before one can develop a reliable model that accurately predicts the emission line spectra in the blrs of luminous agns .",
    "the large velocity dispersion of emission in blrs , the large number of overlapping lines , and the overall richness of the spectrum ( verner et al . 1999 ) form broad emission blends , producing a `` pseudo - continuum '' and/or prominent features from the uv through visual ( 4000@xmath06000   ; hereafter  ( optical ) ) to ir .",
    "this necessitates a complete simulation of the physical processes affecting the fe@xmath2 ion to deduce how the emission varies with properties of the radiation field , density , temperature , and fe abundance in the emitting regions . to investigate what really makes emission strong in the rest - uv",
    ", we have used a new fe@xmath2 model ion .",
    "the model includes 830 atomic levels for fe@xmath2 ( up to @xmath4 ) and represents an expansion of the previous model of verner et al .",
    "( 1999 ) .    in this paper",
    "we evaluate how ( uv)/ and ( uv)/(optical ) emission ratios vary due to extreme changes of the radiation field .",
    "then , for the given density and radiation field , we investigate the emission properties within a reasonable range of fe abundance and microturbulence .",
    "our earlier 371-level fe@xmath2 ion model ( for energies below 11.6 ev ) , incorporated into the code cloudygary / cloudy ] , predicts the emission fluxes of 68,635 lines ( verner et al .",
    "this 371-level model , plus accurate knowledge of the radiation field in a low - density plasma successfully predicted emission in the lower density environments of the orion nebula and eta carinae ejecta ( verner et al .",
    "2000 ; verner et al .",
    "comparison of observations with model results indicates that anomalously strong emission lines can be the result from line pumping due to coincidence of transitions with strong emission lines of other abundant ions ( , , , , etc . ; hartman & johansson 2000 ) .",
    "the higher radiation and particle density regimes in the blrs of quasars favor the population of higher energy levels in fe@xmath2 .",
    "consequently , we expanded the original fe@xmath2 model to 830 levels ( energies below 14.06 ev yeilding 344,035 transitions ) and included more accurate atomic data  new experimental energy levels ( johansson 2002 , private communication ) and a - values from the amsterdam database ( see also raassen & uylings 1998 ) .",
    "where a - values were absent for many semi - forbidden transitions , and rate coefficients uncertain for ly@xmath5 pumping channels and primary cascades , we have inserted reasonable estimates .",
    "the complete simulation of the physical processes affecting the fe@xmath2 ion makes it possible to deduce the density , temperature , plus predict iron abundance in the emitting regions . to accurately model the emission and fe abundances",
    ", we must quantify the effects of the radiation field , and , only then , use ( uv)/ ratios to determine relative abundances .",
    "this approach is especially important for high redshift quasars where selection effects due to the luminosity may play a significant role .",
    "thus , our knowledge about radiative excitation in fe@xmath2 is crucial to predict the spectrum and fe abundances at high redshifts .",
    "the questions is , `` can we use the observed ( uv)/ and ( uv)/(optical ) ratios to derive fe abundances ? ''      in our modeling , we have chosen physical conditions where lines from low - ionization species like dominate the emission .",
    "we adopt a range of fe abundance and a constant density , @xmath6 = 10 @xmath7 @xmath8 , with a total hydrogen column density , @xmath9 = 10@xmath10@xmath11 .",
    "we further assume that the flux of hydrogen ionizing photons at the illuminated face is 10@xmath12@xmath11 s@xmath13 .",
    "these parameters for blr conditions are within the range of values taken from verner et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , and verner ( 2000 ) .",
    "we employ the characteristic agn continuum described in korista et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , which consists of a uv bump peaking near 44 ev , a @xmath14 x - ray power law , and a uv to optical spectral index , @xmath15 .",
    "for the adopted parameters , we have investigated how variations in abundance and microturbulence alter the intrinsic emission ratios of ( uv)/ and ( uv)/(optical ) .",
    "the differences in the predicted spectrum calculated using 371 levels and 830 levels are negligible for lower densities and radiation field with depleted iron abundances ( e.g. orion nebula ) .",
    "differences in the predicted spectra from the two models become more significant with increased radiation field and iron abundance . moreover",
    ", the shape of the radiation field in agns leads to increased population of higher energy levels in .",
    "since densities are higher and the radiation field is more intense in blrs , these upper levels provide additional excitation channels in the far uv ( energies higher than 12 ev ) .",
    "figure 1 compares the predictions using our 371- and 830-level models for the pseudo - continuum appropriate for blr physical conditions in qsos .",
    "the plotted spectra are given as flux versus wavelength , where flux is @xmath16 , in units of erg  @xmath11  s@xmath13 .",
    "the comparison clearly shows how the increased number of atomic levels produces a stronger pseudo - continuum in qso spectra .",
    "the 830-level ion model is far more accurate than the previous best efforts ( wills et al .",
    "1985 ; verner et al .",
    "the increased number of fe@xmath2 energy levels influences not only the spectrum but lines of other elements and the whole energy budget also .",
    "however , the complete study of the new theoretical emission spectrum is not a subject of this paper .",
    "table 1 shows the predicted ( uv)/ and ( uv)/ ( optical ) ratios for 830-level and 371-level models of versus contributions from the radiation field for a solar iron abundance and microturbulence of 1 km s@xmath13 .",
    "the models were calculated for radiative continuum pumping and for pure collisional excitation .",
    "there is almost no change in predictions of 371-level and 830-level models for pure collisional excitation , if pumping by the radiation field is ignored .",
    "however , the predicted ratios are strongly influenced by the radiation field and are sensitive to contributions from the upper levels in .",
    "figure 2 demonstrates the predicted spectrum due to collisions and radiative pumping .",
    "how does the emission depend upon microturbulence ?",
    "the first successful models were developed by netzer & wills ( 1983 ) who also demonstrated that the emission strength is sensitive to the turbulent velocitiy .",
    "this sensitivity was confirmed by modeling by verner et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , who showed that the predicted uv emission indeed became stronger with increased microturbulence . to explore how microturbulence affects the observed ( uv)/ measurements , we calculated models with different microturbulence parameters ( @xmath17 km  s@xmath13 ) .",
    "figure 3 shows ( uv)/ and ( uv)/(optical ) ratios as a function of microturbulence . for small values of @xmath18 and with solar abundance ,",
    "the ( uv)/ ratio is smaller than that of ( uv)/(optical ) .",
    "the ratios are the same at @xmath19  km  s@xmath13 . however , the ( uv)/ ratio grows faster than that of ( uv)/(optical ) as a function of microturbulence .",
    "the uv transitions often arise from levels at high excitation energies , and the density of levels increases substantially above 10 ev .",
    "thus , the uv transitions are closer in energy than those in the optical range , and their strengths are more affected by microturbulence than those of optical lines .",
    "although both the ( uv)/ and ( uv)/(optical ) ratios increase with microturbulence , dependencies are not identical .",
    "our calculations demonstrate that the most reasonable values for ( uv)/ ratios correspond to @xmath19  @xmath0  10  km  s@xmath13 .",
    "is there any specific feature , line or spectral index in agn spectra that can be used to derive the iron abundance accurately ? to probe the effect of varying abundance , we repeated the calculation with one and five times solar iron abundance , keeping the microturbulence constant at @xmath20 km  s@xmath13 .",
    "we define the iron abundance sensitivity ratio as ( i()@xmath21 - i()@xmath22)/i()@xmath22 and signify integrated fluxes i()@xmath22 and i()@xmath21 for abundances of solar and five times solar .",
    "calculations with @xmath23 km  s@xmath13 ( figure 4 ) show that this sensitivity ratio has the same slope as it has with @xmath20 km  s@xmath13 .",
    "we find that the uv lines are generally less sensitive to abundance than those in the optical range .",
    "energy levels responsible for uv and optical lines are not populated proportionally with increasing abundance .",
    "the structure of the fe@xmath2 ion favors the production of more optical emission through cascades from upper levels .",
    "figure 5 shows how ( uv)/ and ( uv)/(optical ) emission ratios change with iron abundance ( 1 , 5 , and 10 solar ) .",
    "the increase in  ( optical ) emission with the fe abundance is stronger than that in ( uv ) emission .",
    "comparisons of radiation and/or turbulence effects confirm that the abundance is not the only factor that affects the ( uv)/ ratio",
    ". a factor of 5 in abundance increases the ( uv)/ ratio by factor less than 2 . by using ( uv)/ in combination with the ( uv)/(optical ) emission ratio , we can deduce abundances while accounting for microturbulence and radiation field effects .",
    "table 2 shows predictions for models with different microturbulence ( @xmath24  km  s@xmath13 ) and iron abundance ( 1  @xmath0  10 of solar ) .",
    "the columns are the following : microturbulence , abundance , and calculated ( uv)/ and ( uv)/ ( optical ) ratios .",
    "by applying the new 830-level model ion for fe@xmath2 , which is incorporated into detailed photoionization calculations , we have probed the feasibility of using the strong emission seen in quasar spectra to derive accurate fe / mg abundance enrichments",
    ". this emission would be especially important in determining the enrichment as a function of redshift and the nature of star formation in the early universe .",
    "we conclude that abundance is not the only factor that makes emission strong over a wide range of wavelengths and is not even the strongest factor .",
    "our modeling indicates that microturbulence also leads to preferential strengthening of the emission in uv .",
    "in contrast to recent observational / measurements , we emphasize the need for low - z quasar observations to calibrate detailed modeling as used here .",
    "our model clearly demonstrates that a simple template can not be applied for all quasars , because the fe ii sensitivity to radiation and turbulence is much stronger than that of the doublet . only detailed modeling that includes the all these effects",
    "can provide more accurate fe ii templates .",
    "due to strong fe ii line overlap , we must adopt a wavelength band approach to get constraints on density , radiation field , and turbulence in blrs .",
    "this approach is more complex , but the computational tools are readily available .",
    "further modeling , beyond that presented here , is necessary .",
    "model comparisons with high s / n observations of quasars , and of even higher resolution observations of objects like @xmath25 car , will produce better atomic parameters , and more detailed understanding of the effects of the radiation field in astronomical objects .",
    "future work using improved atomic data to fully explore effects of the radiation field is in progress .",
    "these results clearly illustrate that the continuum of agns is greatly affected by fe ii .",
    "the spectrum of fe ii simply can not be ignored .",
    "understanding fe ii is crucial for obtaining realistic modeling of restframe agn spectra from the uv through the ir .",
    "studies in the expanded spectral range , much wider than used in any previous efforts , are required .",
    "we suggest that our model is to be applied to low - redshift quasars spanning both a wide luminosity range , and the 1,000  @xmath0  10,000   restframe wavelength range . as the first step in this direction",
    ", the stis and nicmos capabilities can be used immediately to study low - redshift quasars .",
    "the near infrared spectrograph ( nirspec ) on board the james webb space telescope ( jwst ) would make it possible to measure spectra from 0.6 to 5 micron with resolving power in the range needed to obtain ( uv ) and ( optical ) bands from low - redshift to high - redshift quasars .",
