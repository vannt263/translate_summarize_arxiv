    "the goal of the present article is to attract attention to the problem of systematic evaluation of the large-@xmath0 asymptotics of random matrix averages of the form @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are sets of complex parameters .",
    "the angular brackets here and henceforth denote the average over the ensemble of real - symmetric @xmath6 matrices @xmath7 with gaussian entries characterised by the probability density @xmath8 and known as the gaussian orthogonal ensemble ( goe ) .",
    "note that the correlation functions involving products of square roots of the characteristic polynomials in the numerator can be always reduced to the above form by multiplying and dividing both the numerator and the denominator with the same corresponding factors .",
    "although there are reasons to suspect that the correlation functions ( [ 1 ] ) may have a nice mathematical structure even for finite @xmath0 , perhaps not unlike those determinantal or pfaffian structures discovered in @xcite for similar objects involving only integer powers ( see also @xcite for an alternative derivation ) we were not yet able to reveal such structures beyond the simplest case @xmath9 , see ( [ 8 ] ) below .",
    "instead we are mainly concentrating on the large-@xmath0 limit of a few simplest , yet nontrivial examples of the correlation function of the type ( [ 1 ] ) .",
    "we start with considering correlation functions with two square roots in the denominator , and with one or two characteristic polynomials in the numerator , that is @xmath10 and @xmath11 , and then treat a special case of the correlation function involving four square roots in the denominator , and two determinants in the numerator , that is @xmath12 in our notation . as it should be clear from the examples given below the most physically interesting ( bulk ) scaling regime in the large-@xmath0 limit",
    "arises when all spectral parameters are close to some value @xmath13 by a distance of the order of the mean spacing between neighbouring eigenvalues in the bulk , i.e. @xmath14 . correspondingly we define the scaled version of the correlation function as @xmath15 and @xmath16 where the approximate equality sign above should be understood in the sense of extracting the leading asymptotic dependence on the parameters @xmath17 and @xmath18 when @xmath19 .",
    "our results for the above correlation functions are given in eqs .",
    "( [ c1same ] ) and ( [ c1diff ] ) for @xmath20 and in eqs .",
    "( [ c2same ] ) and ( [ c2diff ] ) for @xmath21 . in eq .",
    "we provide the result for a special limit ( see eq . ) of @xmath22 .",
    "these objects are already rich enough to provide answers for quantities arising in applications of random matrices in the field of quantum chaos in closed and open ( scattering ) systems .",
    "we discuss such relations in much detail below .    although our methods are specifically tailored for dealing with the goe we expect our results in the bulk scaling limit to be universal and shared by a broad class of invariant measures on real symmetric matrices @xmath7 @xcite and by so - called wigner ensembles of random real symmetric matrices with independent , identically distributed entries satisfying relevant moments conditions @xcite .      to explain the origin of interest in the correlation functions ( [ 1 ] ) we start with recalling that the phenomenon of quantum chaos attracted considerable theoretical and experimental interest for more than three decades and remains one of the areas where applications of random matrix theory are most fruitful and successful @xcite .",
    "the applications are based on the famous bohigas - giannoni - schmit ( bgs ) @xcite conjecture claiming that in appropriately chosen energy window sequences of highly excited discrete energy levels of generic quantum systems whose classical counterparts are chaotic are statistically indistinguishable from sequences of real eigenvalues of large random matrices of appropriate symmetry .",
    "although not yet fully rigorously proven , this conjecture has an overwhelming support in experimental , numerical and analytical work of the last decades @xcite .",
    "inspired by this analogy as well as by the fact of _ universality _ of many random matrix properties ( i.e. insensitivity to the particular choice of the probability measure on the matrix space ) , see @xcite and references therein , one of the common strategies for predicting universal observables of quantum chaotic systems has been expressing them in terms of resolvents of underlying hamiltonians , then replacing the actual hamiltonians by random matrices taken from analytically tractable ( usually , gaussian ) ensembles of @xmath6 random matrices .",
    "the characteristic functions of the probability densities of the observables under consideration can be frequently computed explicitly by appropriate ensemble averages .",
    "note that the eigenvalues of the standard gaussian ensembles , unitary ( gue , @xmath23 ) , orthogonal ( goe , @xmath24 ) or symplectic ( gse , @xmath25 ) are independent of the eigenvectors , with the matrix of @xmath0 orthonormal eigenvectors being uniformly distributed over the haar s measure of the unitary @xmath26 , orthogonal @xmath27 or symplectic @xmath28 group , correspondingly . to that end",
    "it is natural to evaluate the corresponding characteristic functions by performing first the ensemble average over the eigenvectors . for the @xmath23 case",
    "the average can be frequently done exactly for any @xmath0 by employing the so - called itzykson - zuber - harish - chandra @xcite formula , which is not yet available for @xmath29 group averages .",
    "nevertheless , one is able to perform the eigenvector averages in the limit @xmath30 by using a heuristic idea ( going back to @xcite ) that the set of eigenvectors essentially behaves for @xmath30 as if their components were independent , identically distributed gaussian variables with mean zero and variance @xmath31 .",
    "one can rigorously justify this procedure if only a number @xmath32 of eigenvectors is involved in the set , see e.g. @xcite , but in general a rigorous justification of such a step requires some nontrivial estimates on the resolvents . the heuristic procedure is widely employed in theoretical physics for rmt applications to quantum chaos using the properties of the standard gaussian integrals over complex or real variables . in this way the analysis of many distributions of practical interest is reduced to correlation functions of products and ratios involving _ integer _ ( for @xmath33 ) or _ half - integer _ ( for @xmath24 ) powers of characteristic polynomials of random matrices .",
    "similar averages arise if one is interested in statistics of the matrix elements of the resolvents computed in the basis of random gaussian vectors , as it is frequently done in applications to scattering systems with quantum chaos , see e.g. the recent paper @xcite for an example and further references . for those and",
    "other reasons averages of products and ratios of powers of characteristic polynomials of random matrices attracted much interest over the years . when only _ integer",
    "_ powers are involved in the average the corresponding theory was developed for @xmath23 in @xcite and extended to @xmath29 in @xcite .",
    "the case of half - integer powers for @xmath24 remains however outstanding , despite the fact that it is most relevant for an overwhelming majority of experiments in quantum chaos due to the preserved time - reversal invariance of the underlying hamiltonians .",
    "additional interest to this type of averages gives the fact that they are closely related to the problem of evaluating averages of quantities involving _ absolute values _ of characteristic polynomials due to the relation @xmath34 valid for matrices @xmath7 with real eigenvalues .",
    "such averages emerge , for example , when studying the statistics of the so - called `` level curvatures '' in quantum chaotic systems @xcite , see eq .",
    "( [ 3 ] ) below , as well as in the problem of counting the number of stationary points of random gaussian surfaces , see @xcite .    to support the above picture we describe below explicitly a few examples of relations between the characteristic functions of the physical observables of interest in quantum chaotic systems which can be related to particular instances of the correlation function ( [ 1 ] ) .",
    "the list is almost certainly not exhaustive ( for example , when writing this article we have learned that the square roots of characteristic polynomials emerged very recently in @xcite ) , but hopefully representative .",
    "* * ldos distribution .",
    "* one of the first examples of that sort which is worth mentioning is related to the statistics of the local density of states ( ldos ) @xmath35 at a point @xmath36 of a quantum system with energy levels broadening @xmath37 due to a uniform absorption in the sample .",
    "mathematically the ldos is defined in terms of the diagonal matrix element of the resolvent as @xmath38 , and one is interested in understanding the statistics of the ldos assuming a random matrix goe hamiltonian @xmath7 of size @xmath6 , with the parameter @xmath37 being fixed when @xmath19 .",
    "the laplace transform for the probability density @xmath39 of the ldos can be expressed in the large-@xmath0 limit as @xcite @xmath40}{\\det^{1/2}\\left[(e - h)^2+\\frac{\\eta^2 } { n^2}+\\frac{\\eta s}{n}\\right ] } \\right\\rangle_{goe , n \\to \\infty}.\\ ] ] evaluation of the above random matrix average ( which in our notation is a particular case of @xmath22 ) attempted in @xcite resulted in a quite impractical 5-fold integral , and to this end remains an outstanding rmt problem .",
    "note however that the density @xmath39 has been found via a different route avoiding ( [ 2 ] ) as a sum of two - fold integrals in @xcite .",
    "* * probability distribution of `` level curvatures''*. consider a perturbation @xmath41 of the hamiltonian @xmath7 where @xmath42 is a control parameter and @xmath43 is a real symmetric matrix .",
    "`` level curvatures '' are defined as second derivatives of the eigenvalues @xmath44 ( interpreted as energy levels of a quantum - chaotic system ) with respect to the external parameter @xmath42 : @xmath45 . assuming the perturbation @xmath43 to be taken as well from the goe one can show that the probability density @xmath46 of the level curvatures for goe matrices @xmath7 with eigenvalues @xmath47 and mean density of eigenvalues @xmath48 can be represented as@xcite @xmath49 where the required random matrix average in the right - hand side was independently evaluated by several alternative methods in @xcite .",
    "note that heuristic arguments appealing to gaussianity of goe eigenvectors in the large-@xmath0 limit suggest universality of the level curvature distribution for a `` generic '' choice of @xmath43 , and a rigorous proof of this fact is under consideration@xcite . *",
    "* statistics of s - matrix poles . * various questions related to the statistics of quantum chaotic resonances ( poles of the scattering matrix in the complex energy plane @xcite ) in the regime of a weakly open scattering system can be related to evaluation of the averages @xmath50 where @xmath51 is considered as @xmath0-independent parameter .",
    "the first of these averages features in the statistics of resonance widths change under influence of a small perturbation of the hamiltonian @xmath52 akin to that considered above for the level curvature case .",
    "such change reflects the intrinsic non - orthogonality of the associated resonance eigenfunctions @xcite .",
    "another manifestation of the same non - orthogonality is the statistics of the so - called petermann factor which again can be related to random matrix averages involving half - integer powers of characteristic polynomials , see @xcite .",
    "the second average in ( [ 4 ] ) arose in a recent attempt of clarifying the statistics of resonance widths beyond the standard first - order perturbation theory , see @xcite .",
    "evaluating both averages featuring in ( [ 4 ] ) in a uniform way by a systematic procedure was one of our motivations behind writing the present paper . *",
    "* statistics of wigner @xmath2-matrix .",
    "* in the theory of quantum chaotic scattering the wigner @xmath2-matrix is essentially defined as a certain projection of the resolvent of @xmath7 .",

    "we believe with due effort such analysis can be done with full mathematical rigor , see e.g. a recent paper @xcite , but we do not attempt it here concentrating on explaining the gross structures of the saddle - point analysis which yield the correct results .",
    "for the case of different signs the saddle points of the integrand are given by @xmath202 for @xmath203 and @xmath204 only solutions with positive real parts are contributing to the asymptotics .",
    "there is no such restriction for @xmath169 or @xmath205 and @xmath206 , respectively , and we have two saddle points contributing in each of these variables .",
    "hence for @xmath207 the final expression is given by the sum of two different saddle - point contributions .",
    "for @xmath208 there are in principle four different contributions",
    ". however , the contributions from the saddle points satisfying @xmath209 are actually negligible due to the factor @xmath210 in the integrand .",
    "moreover the integrand is invariant under exchanging @xmath205 and @xmath206 , and hence the two remaining contributions are identical",
    ". it therefore suffices to choose for @xmath211 the solution with positive real part and for @xmath212 the one with negative real part .",
    "one may further notice that the integrand itself vanishes when evaluated at the saddle points due to the factors @xmath213 and @xmath214 .",
    "this fact makes it necessary to expand the integrand to a higher order around the saddle points .",
    "the corresponding calculation is rather tedious , but managable . we refrain from presenting it here and refer the interested reader to @xcite for technical detail .",
    "the outcome of the analysis are precisely the formulae given in eqs . and .",
    "the case of same signs looks quite different . here",
    "the saddle points are given by @xmath215 where @xmath216 .",
    "again we must choose @xmath217 and @xmath218 to have a positive real part , so that two contributions arise for @xmath20 and four for @xmath21 .",
    "however , the term @xmath219 is only nonvanishing if we choose @xmath220 , contributions for all other choices becoming subdominant . for @xmath21",
    "the same arguments as before suggest to choose for @xmath211 the solution with positive real part and for @xmath212 with negative real part neglecting the other three contributions .",
    "while the integrand still vanishes at he saddle points due to the factor @xmath221 and for @xmath21 due to the factors @xmath222 , the saddle point analysis is now much simpler than in the previous case . indeed , when extracting the leading - order contribution one has to replace @xmath223 ( with @xmath224 parametrizing the integration around the relevant saddle point ) and similarly for the other variables , and then expand the @xmath0-independent part of the integrand to zero - th order in @xmath224 etc .",
    "( apart from the factors which come naturally in first order like @xmath225 ) .",
    "it is then readily seen that the corresponding integrals yield a nonvanishing contribution rather straightforwardly without need to expand the integrand to higher orders like it was necessary in the previous case of opposite signs .",
    "the results of such saddle - point analysis is then much simpler and is given in eqs . and .",
    "for the correlation function ( [ c4special ] ) associated with the distribution of an individual off - diagonal @xmath2-matrix element we consider for simplicity only the perfect coupling case @xmath111 and @xmath226 , see eq . ) . for evaluating the ensemble average we first tried to follow the same method as described in the previous section . in this way we started with writing @xmath227 and @xmath228 and then replaced the square roots of characteristic polynomials in the denominator by four gaussian integrals over real commuting vectors and those in the numerator by gaussian integrals over two vectors with anticommuting components .",
    "the ensemble averaging then yields a @xmath229 @xmath168-matrix , but we found no efficient ways of evaluating the ensuing group integral over the diagonalizing matrices .",
    "we also attempted a direct saddle - point analysis for large @xmath0 along the same lines as before , and found it to become very tedious as not only the zero - th and first , but also the second order of the integrand expansion in fluctuations around the relevant saddle points turned out to be vanishing at the saddle points .",
    "expanding to an even higher order with the group integrals still present did not seem to us as a viable option .    confronted with those difficulties we followed a different method ( inspired by the insights from @xcite ) which avoids introducing anticommuting variables altogether .",
    "we demonstrate it first for the correlation function @xmath20 .",
    "for brevity we will consider only the simplest case @xmath111 where such object can be written as @xmath230 we start with representing only the denominator by a gaussian integral over a real @xmath0-component vector @xmath231 and hence get @xmath232 where @xmath233 \\right\\rangle_{goe , n\\to \\infty}.\\ ] ] note that the above integral is well - defined only for @xmath96 and @xmath97 having different signs , otherwise the term @xmath234 would render the integral divergent",
    ".    let us further assume that @xmath235 , such that the linear term @xmath236 vanishes .",
    "such assumption is not necessary to make the method functional but helps to simplify the presentation considerably .",
    "next we parametrize the vector @xmath231 of integration variables as @xmath237 , where @xmath238 $ ] is an @xmath0-dimensional unit vector and @xmath239 is an orthogonal matrix : @xmath240 .",
    "since both the determinant factor and the goe probability density @xmath241 in ( [ phi ] ) are invariant under orthogonal transformations @xmath242 the matrices @xmath243 can be omitted .",
    "the term @xmath244 then suggests that it is advantageous to decompose @xmath7 as @xmath245 where @xmath246 is a real @xmath247-component vector , @xmath248 is the @xmath249 subblock of @xmath7 and @xmath250 is the first element of @xmath7 .",
    "with such a decomposition one is able to integrate out the variable @xmath250 as well as the vector @xmath246 , which leads to @xmath251,\\ ] ] where we have introduced the short - hand notations @xmath252 and @xmath253 where the ensemble average should be performed over the @xmath254 goe matrix @xmath248 .",
    "moreover , it actually suffices to know only @xmath255 since @xmath256 . as is well - known @xmath255 is proportional to the hermite polynomial : @xmath257 , so that asymptotically we have @xmath258 .",
    "it remains to perform the @xmath231-integration for which it is advantageous to introduce rescaled polar coordinates , such that @xmath259 .",
    "the problem then reduces to performing the single integral @xmath260.\\ ] ] for large @xmath30 it is easy to verify that the leading contribution to the integral can be written as @xmath261 \\nonumber \\\\    & \\propto ( e^{\\frac{\\omega_f}{j}}+(-1)^n e^{-\\frac{\\omega_f}{j } } ) \\omega_f k_0(\\tfrac{|\\omega_b|}{j})+(e^{\\frac{\\omega_f}{j}}-(-1)^n e^{-\\frac{\\omega_f}{j } } ) |\\omega_b| k_1(\\tfrac{|\\omega_b|}{j}),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which indeed coincides with the earlier derived expression for @xmath262 from eq .",
    "now we follow the same route for evaluation of the correlation function ( [ c4special ] ) .",
    "we will only outline the key steps and differences from the previous case , but refrain from presenting intermediate results relegating them to @xcite .",
    "one starts with replacing only the square roots of the characteristic polynomials in the denominator by gaussian integrals , which leads us to @xmath263 where @xmath264 and @xmath265 are two real @xmath0-component vectors , and @xmath266 in contrast to a single vector @xmath231 in the previous case we now have to deal with two real vectors @xmath264 and @xmath265 , which we can conveniently combine into the matrix @xmath267 .",
    "such a rank - two @xmath6 matrix has two nonzero eigenvalues which we call @xmath268 and @xmath269 , all other @xmath270 eigenvalues being identically zero .",
    "being real symmetric @xmath267 can be diagonalised by an orthogonal transformation : @xmath271 and the orthogonal matrices can be omitted from the integrand by the same invariance reasons as before .",
    "owing to this structure we can conveniently decompose @xmath7 into its upper left @xmath179 block , its lower right @xmath272 block @xmath273 and the two ensuing off - diagonal blocks .",
    "it is easy to integrate out all variables apart from those entering @xmath273 and get , with a slight abuse of notations : @xmath274 @xmath275+\\frac{2}{c_1c_2(a_1+a_2 ) } \\left[3\\mbox{tr}a^2-(\\mbox{tr}a)^2\\right ] \\right.\\ ] ] @xmath276 where we used the notations @xmath277    the result then reduces to performing ensemble averages over expressions @xmath278 multiplied with various powers of traces of the inverse matrices @xmath279 for a few instances of positive integers @xmath280 .",
    "one may notice that all the required averages can be represented as derivatives of the correlation function of two goe characteristic polynomials , using e.g. the identities @xmath281\\ ] ] @xmath282\\ ] ] and similarly for the higher powers .",
    "as a result for the object featuring in ( [ psi ] ) we have : @xmath283 where the differential operator @xmath284 is explicitly given by @xmath285    the ensemble average of the product of two goe characteristic polynomials is known and for large @xmath0 is given asymptotically by ( see e.g. @xcite ) @xmath286 using this result , and taking the necessary derivatives and the limits @xmath287 , we finally get an explicit expression for @xmath288 .",
    "the last step is to perform the integrals over @xmath264 and @xmath265 , see eq . .",
    "in the previous case we could reduce integration over @xmath264 to a single integration in polar coordinates .",
    "similarly we can now exploit the invariance of the integrand and exploit the identity . in this way we can restrict the integration to the manifold of positive definite real symmetric @xmath179 matrices with eigenvalues @xmath268 and @xmath269 .",
    "extracting the leading large-@xmath0-asymptotics is then a straightforward exercise and we finally end up with the integral representation @xmath289 \\\\   & \\times \\exp \\left[-\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{q_1}+\\frac{1}{q_2}+\\frac{(q_1+q_2)(x^2+\\epsilon^2)}{2j^2}\\right)\\right ] \\\\    & \\times\\bigg\\{\\frac{(1+q_1)(1+q_2)}{q_1 ^ 2 q_2 ^ 2}+ \\frac{3}{(q_1+q_2)^2 } + \\frac{2}{q_1 q_2 ( q_1+q_2 ) } \\bigg\\}.   \\end{split}\\ ] ] note that here the limit @xmath290 is implied , which can now trivially be performed .",
    "it turns out that this rather complicated - looking integral is actually proportional to @xmath291 a way to verify this claim is to differentiate both equations ( assuming for definiteness @xmath292 , @xmath112 ) with respect to @xmath36 .",
    "the derivative of eq .",
    "is @xmath293 , and the derivative of is @xmath36 times a certain two - fold integral which with some efforts can be shown to be proportional to @xmath294 .",
    "the details of this calculation are relegated to @xcite .",
    "in this paper we have started the program of systematic evaluation of correlation functions ( [ 1 ] ) involving half - integer powers of the characteristic polynomials of @xmath6 goe matrices .",
    "motivated by diverse applications outlined in the introductory section we mainly concentrated on extracting the asymptotic behaviour of several objects of that type as @xmath19 .",
    "our calculations were based on variants of the supersymmetry method or related techniques .",
    "the method in a nutshell amounts to replacing the initial average involving the product of @xmath2 characteristic polynomials divided by @xmath181 square roots of characteristic polynomials of @xmath6 goe matrices @xmath7 with an average over the sets of @xmath295 matrices @xmath147 and @xmath296 matrices @xmath297 with gaussian weights augmented essentially with the factors @xmath298 and @xmath299 raised to powers of order @xmath0 , see e.g. ( [ c2withq ] ) .",
    "as we are eventually mostly interested in @xmath300 fixed but @xmath19 this replacement is very helpful as it allows to employ saddle - point approximations . in this paper we managed to perform all steps of such a procedure successfully only for relatively small values of @xmath2 and @xmath181 , but we hope that the general case can eventually be treated along similar lines .",
    "one reason and guiding principle for a moderate optimism is as follows .",
    "an inspection of a somewhat simpler example of @xmath23 shows , see in particular @xcite , that the success of our method is deeply connected to the existence of the so - called _ duality relations _ for gaussian ensembles , see @xcite for a better understanding of such dualities .",
    "in particular , the proposition 7 of the latter paper shows that one of such duality relations exists for general gaussian @xmath301-ensembles with @xmath85 for an object involving the ensemble average of the product of the corresponding characteristic polynomials raised to the power @xmath302 . for the goe with @xmath24",
    "that object ( see proposition 2 in @xcite ) is exactly the particular case of ( [ 1 ] ) with @xmath303 and arbitrary integer @xmath181 which makes a contact to the present context ; e.g. one can employ such a duality to reproduce the relation ( [ fyokeat ] ) in an alternative way",
    ". a deeper understanding of connections between the supersymmetric approach and the duality relations for gaussian ensembles will certainly be helpful in dealing efficiently with asymptotics of ( [ 1 ] ) for arbitrary integer values @xmath2 and @xmath181 .",
    "the problem of revealing possible pfaffian - determinant structures behind ( [ 1 ] ) for finite matrix size @xmath0 remains at the moment completely outstanding .",
