    "the experimental study of nuclei around the doubly - magic @xmath8sn nucleus is of special interest .",
    "such new data allow us to test ingredients of shell - model ( sm ) calculations far away from the valley of stability .",
    "for instance , a realistic effective interaction to be used in the @xmath9 valence shell was derived from the cd - bonn nucleon - nucleon potential and has been tested in several nuclei having few proton particles and neutron holes away from the doubly - magic core : @xmath10te@xmath11 , @xmath12sn@xmath13 , @xmath14sb@xmath15 and @xmath16te@xmath13  @xcite .",
    "the experimental energy levels of these four nuclei are well reproduced showing that such an approach for determining the two - body matrix elements could provide an accurate description of nuclear structure properties .",
    "more recently , the experimental high - spin states of five @xmath17 isotones  @xcite were described using this interaction  @xcite , named sn100pn .",
    "nevertheless because of their neutron magic number , only the proton parts of the interaction take place in such sm calculations . in order to assess more precisely the quality of this realistic effective interaction",
    ", the results of sm calculations have to be compared to experimental data in other nuclei .",
    "for instance all the parts of the effective interaction can be tested using nuclei having neutron holes in presence of a few proton particles , such as the @xmath18te isotopes with @xmath19 .",
    "yrast excitations in several heavy - mass te isotopes have been already experimentally obtained using deep - inelastic reactions , the states of @xmath20te being identified up to spin ( 23/2 ) and those of @xmath21te up to spin ( 12 ) or ( 14 )  @xcite , i.e. , up to the breaking of the first @xmath7 pair .",
    "more recently , a new level scheme of @xmath22te has been established , showing an isomeric state at 4.4  mev excitation energy  @xcite .",
    "the use of binary fission induced by heavy ions allows us to extend the yrast line to higher - spin states , particularly those coming from the breaking of several pairs .",
    "thus , in this work , the @xmath0te isotopes have been produced as fragments of two fusion - fission reactions .",
    "their level schemes have been built from the @xmath5 high - fold events and @xmath23 angular correlations have been analyzed in order to assign spin and parity values to most of the states .",
    "in addition , the half - lives of isomeric states have been measured from the delayed coincidences between a fission fragment detector and the gamma array , or from the timing of the ge detectors .",
    "several te isotopes with heavier masses were also observed in the c+u reaction .",
    "the identification of their complementary fragments by means of the cross coincidences of their @xmath5-rays indicates that they are not produced from the same reaction channel as @xmath0te , but from fissions following transfer or incomplete fusion .",
    "many other nuclei belonging to the @xmath24 region have also singular partners , implying that they are produced from the same mechanism .",
    "in the last part of this paper , all the yrast states of @xmath0te are firstly discussed in comparison with the general features known in this mass region .",
    "the predictions from sm calculations using the sn100pn effective interaction  @xcite then are presented , starting from the description of the high - spin states of several sn isotopes in which the breakings of several neutron pairs occupying the @xmath7 orbit were experimentally identified  @xcite . with regard to the te isotopes ,",
    "the sm calculations are done in the full valence space in four cases , @xmath25te and the theoretical predictions are compared to the experimental results . in addition , the detailed analysis of the wave functions of the high - spin states shows the effects of the proton - pair breaking along the yrast lines of the heavy te isotopes .",
    "the @xmath18te isotopes of interest were obtained as fission fragments in two experiments .",
    "first , the @xmath1c + @xmath2u reaction was studied at 90 mev incident energy , with a beam provided by the legnaro xtu tandem accelerator .",
    "second , the @xmath3o + @xmath4pb reaction was studied with a 85 mev incident energy beam provided by the vivitron accelerator of ires ( strasbourg ) .",
    "the @xmath5 rays were detected with the euroball array  @xcite .",
    "the spectrometer contained 15 cluster germanium detectors placed in the backward hemisphere with respect to the beam , 26 clover germanium detectors located around 90@xmath26 and 30 tapered single - crystal germanium detectors located at forward angles .",
    "each cluster detector consists of seven closely packed large - volume ge crystals  @xcite and each clover detector consists of four smaller ge crystals  @xcite . in order",
    "to get rid of the doppler effect , both experiments have been performed with thick targets in order to stop the recoiling nuclei ( 47 mg/@xmath27 for @xmath2u and 100 mg/@xmath27 for @xmath4pb targets , respectively ) .    the data of the c+u experiment were recorded in an event - by - event mode with the requirement that a minimum of five unsuppressed ge detectors fired in prompt coincidence .",
    "a set of 1.9@xmath28 three- and higher - fold events was available for a subsequent analysis .",
    "for the o+pb experiment , a lower trigger condition ( three unsuppressed ge ) allowed us to register 4@xmath29 events with a @xmath5-fold greater than or equal to 3 . the offline analysis consisted of both multigated spectra and three - dimensional cubes built and analyzed with the radware package  @xcite .",
    "more than one hundred nuclei are produced at high spin in such experiments , and this gives several thousands of @xmath5 transitions which have to be sorted out .",
    "single - gated spectra are useless in most of the cases .",
    "the selection of one particular nucleus needs at least two energy conditions , implying that at least two transitions have to be known .",
    "it is worth noting that prompt @xmath5 rays emitted by couples of complementary fragments are detected in coincidence  @xcite .",
    "because the isotopes of interest are produced from two different fissioning compound nuclei in this work , the complementary fragments are different in the two reactions .",
    "this gives a fully unambiguous assignment of transitions seen in both experiments .",
    "the relative intensity of the lowest transitions of the even-@xmath30 te isotopes have been measured in spectra in double coincidences with two transitions emitted by one partner . then , we have used the spectra in double coincidences with one low - lying transition of the te isotope of interest and one transition of a partner .",
    "finally , for determining the intensity of the weak transitions , we have analyzed spectra in double coincidences with two transitions of the te level schemes and normalized the obtained results by using relative intensities extracted from the spectra mentioned above .",
    "as reported in previous papers  @xcite , another experiment was performed using the saphir heavy - ion detector  @xcite , here composed of 32 photovoltaic cells , in order to identify new isomeric states in the fission fragments .",
    "placed in the target chamber of euroball , saphir was used to detect the escaping fission - fragments of the @xmath1c ( 90  mev ) + @xmath2u reaction from a thin 0.14 mg/@xmath27 uranium target .",
    "the detection of the two fragments in coincidence providing a clean signature of fission events was used as the trigger for euroball .",
    "the euroball time window was [ 50  ns@xmath31s ] , allowing detection of delayed @xmath5-rays emitted during the de - excitation of isomeric states .",
    "time spectra between fragments and @xmath5-rays were analyzed in order to measure the half - life of isomeric levels , in a range of several tens to several hundreds of nanoseconds .",
    "it is well known that the @xmath5 rays emitted by fusion - fission fragments do not show any anisotropy in their angular distributions with respect to the incident beam .",
    "however , angular correlations of two successive transitions are meaningful . in order to determine the spin values of excited states ,",
    "the coincidence rates of two successive @xmath5 rays are analyzed as a function of @xmath32 , the average relative angle between the two fired detectors .",
    "the euroball spectrometer had @xmath33=28441 combinations of two crystals , out of which @xmath34 2000 involved different values of relative angle within 2@xmath26 . therefore , in order to keep reasonable numbers of counts , all these angles have been gathered around three average relative angles : 22@xmath26 , 46@xmath26 , and 75@xmath26 . the coincidence rate increases between 0@xmath26 and 90@xmath26 for the dipole - quadrupole cascades , whereas it decreases for the quadrupole - quadrupole or dipole - dipole ones .",
    "the theoretical values of several coincidence rates for the euroball geometry have been already given in previous papers  @xcite .",
    "the method has been checked by correctly reproducing the expected angular correlations of @xmath5-transitions having well - known multipole orders and belonging to various fission fragments .    when the statistics of our data are too low to perform such a measurement , the spin assignments are based upon ( i ) the already known spins of some states , ( ii ) the assumption that in yrast decays , spin values increase with the excitation energy , ( iii ) the possible existence of cross - over transitions , and ( iv ) the analogy with the level structures of the other isotopes .",
    "the @xmath5-rays emitted by the low - lying states of @xmath35te isotopes have been observed in both fusion - fission reactions used in the present work . regarding @xmath36te and @xmath8te , their yield are so low that only the decays of their low - lying yrast states are observed and the transitions of their partners could not be identified in gated spectra . on the other hand ,",
    "we have measured many new @xmath5-rays emitted by the high - spin states of @xmath0te .",
    "the results are presented in the two following sections . in the third one , we discuss the particular cases of @xmath37te which have been only observed in the @xmath1c + @xmath2u reaction .",
    "previous information of the medium - spin excited states of @xmath39te comes from results of the ( @xmath40,2n@xmath5 ) reaction  @xcite .",
    "the positive - parity yrast band was identified up to the @xmath41 state at 3152  kev and the negative - parity one up to the @xmath42 state at 3987  kev .",
