    "[ sec : intro ] motivated by the question how much honey can be kept on a breakfast knife by rotating the knife about its long axis , moffatt studied the destabilisation of a film on the outside of a rotating horizontal cylinder and the subsequent development of regular patterns of azimuthal rings @xcite .",
    "he also gives a lubrication equation that incorporates gravity and viscosity effects but neglects surface tension and inertia .",
    "it is based on a model by @xcite which includes surface tension .",
    "related questions had been studied before by @xcite employing a rotating horizontal cylinder which is at the bottom immersed in a liquid bath .",
    "i.e. , in contrast to @xcite the amount of liquid on the cylinder is not an independent control parameter .",
    "the related case of a liquid film covering the inner wall of a horizontal rotating cylinder was first studied by @xcite who discussed experiments performed with water employing an inviscid model incorporating gravitational and centrifugal forces .    since the early experimental results engineers and scientists alike have studied flows of free - surface films of liquid on the inner or outer wall of resting or rotating horizontal cylinders in a number of different settings .",
    "the studied systems are of high importance for several coating and printing processes where rotating cylinders transport the coating material in the form of liquid films . in the present contribution we will discuss the analogy between film flow and drop motion on a rotating horizontal cylinder on the one hand and on heterogeneous substrates with regular wettability patterns on the other hand .",
    "first , however , we will give a short account of the seemingly disconnected fields .",
    "the theoretical analyses given by @xcite and @xcite for the flow on / in a rotating cylinder were based on linear stability considerations based on the full hydrodynamic equations for momentum transport , i.e. , the navier - stokes equations .",
    "their studies were extended later on , e.g. , by @xcite who considered inviscid film flow on the in- and outside of the cylinder in a unified manner , and @xcite whose analysis includes viscous film flow at small and large reynolds numbers .    however , most analyses of the non - linear behaviour are based on a long - wave or lubrication approximation @xcite valid for the case where the thickness of the liquid film @xmath0 is small as compared to the radius of the cylinder @xmath1 . the resulting evolution equation for the film thickness profile @xmath2 + h\\right\\ } { \\label{eq : film - puk}}\\ ] ]",
    "was first given by @xcite and used by @xcite ( without capillarity effects , i.e. , @xmath3 ) .",
    "in the dimensionless eq .",
    "( [ eq : film - puk ] ) , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the scaled dimensionless surface - tension and gravity parameter , respectively @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that both depend on the angular velocity of the rotation @xmath6 , the dynamic viscosity @xmath7 , the cylinder radius @xmath1 , and the ratio @xmath8 of mean film thickness @xmath9 and @xmath1 .",
    "the remaining material constants are surface tension @xmath10 and density @xmath11 , and @xmath12 is the gravitational acceleration .",
    "the angle @xmath13 determines the position on the cylinder surface and is measured anti - clockwise starting at the horizontal position on the right .",
    "the force @xmath14 corresponds to the component of gravity parallel to the cylinder surface .",
    "the long - wave equation ( [ eq : film - puk ] ) including surface tension effects has been studied in detail by , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "note that for the parameter ranges where eq .",
    "( [ eq : film - puk ] ) applies , it is valid without difference for films on the outside and inside of the cylinder ( cf .",
    ", e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "a preliminary comparison of the long - wave approach to results obtained with the stokes equation is given by @xcite .",
    "various extensions of eq .",
    "( [ eq : film - puk ] ) were developed .",
    "see , in particular , @xcite for a discussion of hydrostatic effects .",
    "other higher order terms related to gravity , inertial and centrifugal effects have been included @xcite . in particular , @xcite and @xcite",
    "present a systematic derivation of several such higher order models and give also detailed comparisons to a number of previous studies as e.g. , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . the film stability and non - linear evolution of a film on the outside of a non - isothermal horizontal cylinder",
    "was considered without @xcite and with @xcite rotation .",
    "most of the aforementioned studies consider two - dimensional situations .",
    "the fully three - dimensionional problem is studied for the cases without @xcite and with @xcite rotation .    the second system that we would like to discuss are liquid drops and films on heterogeneous solid substrates as studied experimentally , e.g.  by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "although in principle the heterogeneity may result from substrate topography or chemical heterogeneities we focus here on the case of a smooth flat substrate with chemical heterogeneities , i.e. , we assume the substrate wettability depends on position .",
    "horizontal heterogeneous substrates are often considered in connection with micro - patterning of soft matter films via thin film dewetting @xcite .",
    "another application are free - surface liquid channels in microfluidics @xcite .",
    "often one employs thin film evolution equations obtained through a long - wave approximation to study the dynamics of dewetting for an initially flat film or to analyse steady drop and ridge solutions and their stability on such patterned substrates ( see , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "static structures may also be studied using a variational approach @xcite .",
    "more recently a model system was introduced to study the dynamics of drops on heterogeneous inclined substrates .",
    "the models apply also to such drops under other driving forces along the substrate @xcite .",
    "the corresponding dimensionless evolution equation for the one - dimensional film thickness profile ( i.e. , describing a two - dimensional drop ) is of the form @xmath15   + \\tilde{\\mu}\\right\\ } , { \\label{eq : film - depin}}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 represents the lateral driving force ( @xmath17 in the case of an inclined substrate , where @xmath18 is the inclination angle ) .",
    "the position - dependent disjoining pressure @xmath19 models the heterogeneous wettability of the substrate .",
    "one notices at once that eqs .",
    "( [ eq : film - depin ] ) and ( [ eq : film - puk ] ) are rather similar : identifying @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 , eq .",

    "( [ eq : film - depin ] ) . here",
    ", we use the analogy to study drops or films on a rotating cylinder .",
    "in particular , we show that drops on a rotating cylinder may show rather involved depinning dynamics analogeous to the behaviour of drops on heterogeneous substrates @xcite .    to illustrate the behaviour we choose the case of drops of a partially wetting liquid on a substrate with a periodic array of localised hydrophobic wettability defects @xcite .",
    "on a horizontal substrate one finds steady drops that are positioned exactly between adjacent defects , i.e. , the drops stay on the most wettable part . at a small lateral driving force @xmath18 the @xmath24 symmetry of the system",
    "is broken . however , the drops do not slide continuously along the substrate as they do in the case of a substrate without defects @xcite",
    ". their advancing contact line is blocked by the next hydrophobic defect , i.e. , one finds steady pinned drops at an upstream position close to the defect . as the driving force",
    "is increased , the drops are pressed further against the defect . as a result",
    "the steady drops steepen . at a finite critical value @xmath25 the driving force allows the drop to overcome the adverse wettability gradient and the drop depins from the defect and begins to slide . in a large part of",
    "the parameter space spanned by the wettability contrast and the drop size the point of depinning at @xmath25 corresponds to a saddle - node infinite period ( sniper ) bifurcation . beyond @xmath25",
    "the drops do not slide continuously down the incline .",
    "they rather perform a stick - slip motion from defect to defect @xcite .",
    "however , in another region of the parameter space the depinning can occur via a hopf bifurcation , i.e. , with a finite frequency .",
    "in particular , this happens in the case of rather thick wetting layers .",
    "the aim of the present contribution is to elucidate under which conditions a similarly intricate ` depinning ' behaviour can be found for a pendant drop underneath a horizontal cylinder when increasing the speed of rotation . in the following section [ sec : model ]",
    "we will discuss our scaling and introduce a long - wave model for a film of partially wetting liquid on a rotating cylinder .",
    "it allows ( even without gravitation ) for the coexistence of drops and a wetting layer .",
    "we discuss several physical situations it can be applied to .",
    "next , section [ sec : res ] presents steady state solutions depending on the non - dimensional rotation velocity for several thicknesses of the wetting layer and discusses the depinning scenario in the case of the partially wetting liquid .",
    "finally , we conclude and give an outlook in section  [ sec : conc ] .",
    "[ sec : model ] before we introduce our long - wave model we discuss our scales . in the non - dimensionalisation",
    "used in most works studying eq .",
    "( [ eq : film - puk ] ) the angular velocity of the cylinder rotation @xmath6 is not reflected in a single dimensionless parameter but both dimensionless parameters are inversely proportional to @xmath6 . furthermore , the time scale depends on @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "this and a further re - scaling of the equation for steady drop and film states , that absorbs the flow rate into both dimensionless parameters and also into the thickness scale , implies that the existence of two steady solutions for identical parameters ( thin capillary film and pendant drop with through - flow ) , shown analytically by @xcite and numerically by @xcite , actually refers to solutions of different liquid volume .",
    "such a scaling is not convenient for our study as we would like to investigate the change in system behaviour for fixed liquid volume when increasing the rotation speed of the cylinder from zero , i.e. , @xmath6 should only enter a single dimensionless parameter that will be our main control parameter . a scaling fit for our purpose",
    "is the one based on the scales of the gravity - driven drainage flow employed by @xcite .",
    "note also that in particular @xcite and to a lesser extent @xcite represent some of their solutions in a way that misrepresents their findings and , in general , the concept of an equation in long - wave approximation . whenever one shows the solutions as a thickness profile on a cylinder one has to pick a particular radius @xmath1 _ and _ smallness ratio @xmath26 for the representation ( cf .",
    "[ fig : rot - steady - prof ] , [ fig : rot - prof ] and [ fig : rot - wetting - prof ] below ) .",

    "it is always only an approximation to a real physical situation where @xmath26 is finite .",

    "the angle @xmath13 is defined in clockwise direction starting at the upper vertical position , i.e. , a pendant droplet underneath the resting horizontal cylinder has its centre of mass at @xmath40 .",
    "the evolution equation is derived from the navier - stokes equations with no - slip boundary conditions at the ( rotating ) cylinder , and tangent- and normal force equilibria at the free surface using the long - wave approximation @xcite .",
    "note that here we furthermore assume that the ratio @xmath41 and the physical equilibrium contact angle are both of @xmath42 ( cf .",

    "although here we do not consider such other physical effects explicitly , we will explore the effect of corresponding thick wetting layers by adapting the parameters of our disjoining pressure accordingly . a thick wetting layer that coexists with droplets might",
    ", for instance , result from the interplay of a destabilising thermal or electrical effect and a stabilising long - range van der waals interaction .",

    "our equation corresponds also to that of @xcite when the disjoining pressure is added to their equation .    to analyse the system behaviour we determine in the following steady - state solutions that correspond , e.g. , to pendant droplets .",

    "as the present work aims at establishing the qualitative correspondence between the behaviour of a depinning drop on a heterogeneous substrate and the one of a droplet on a rotating cylinder we restrict our results to one partially wetting case ( choosing @xmath108 and @xmath109 ) and the completely wetting case ( @xmath110 ) . for comparison ,",

    "[ sec : conc ] based on the observation that the equations in long - wave approximation that govern film flow and drop motion ( i ) on or in a rotating cylinder and ( ii ) on a heterogeneous substrate are rather similar , we have explored whether the analogy can be exploited , i.e. , whether it allows results obtained for one system to be transferred to the other one . in particular , we have found that indeed for drops on a rotating cylinder there exists a counterpart of the rather involved depinning dynamics described recently for drops on heterogeneous substrates .    to study the effect we have introduced an alternative scaling .",
    "this has been necessary because the commonly used scaling contains the angular velocity of the cylinder rotation in both dimensionless parameters and in the time scale .",
    "together with a further re - scaling of the steady state equation involving the flow rate @xcite this does not allow for an investigation of either the system behaviour when increasing the rotation speed of the cylinder from zero or the existence of multiple solutions for fixed rotation speed and liquid volume .",
    "the scaling employed here does allow for such studies as the rotation speed only enters a single dimensionless parameter .",
    "furthermore , it allows us to discuss the analogy between the two systems of interest in a rather natural way .",
    "in particular , downward gravitation and rotation speed for the drop on the rotating cylinder correspond to the heterogeneous wettability and lateral driving force , respectively , for drops on heterogeneous substrates .    guided by this analogy",
    "we have studied the behaviour of drops of partially wetting liquid on the rotating cylinder . as a result",
    "it has been shown , how ` switching on ' gravity ( increasing the bond number ) without rotation changes the solution behaviour dramatically as the ` gravitational heterogeneity ' along the cylinder surface effectively suppresses multidrop solutions until only the single pendant droplet underneath the cylinder survives .",
    "we have furthermore found that increasing the rotation from zero to small values , the drop is dragged along to a stable equilibrium position where downwards gravity and upwards drag compensate . at a critical speed , however , the retaining downwards force is too small and the drop is dragged above the left horizontal position .",
    "it then continuously moves with the rotating cylinder in a non - constant manner .",
    "close to the transition the drop shows stick - slip motion .",
    "an analysis of the time - dependent behaviour has shown that the frequency related to the periodic motion goes to zero at the threshold following a power law with power @xmath134 .",
    "this and the related bifurcation diagram show that the observed transition corresponds to depinning via a sniper bifurcation .",
    "the behaviour found is rather generic for the case of partial wetting .",
    "although , here we have presented results for particular parameter values , it can be observed in a wide range of parameters , in particular , bond number , equilibrium contact angle and wetting layer thickness .",
    "however , we have also found that the behaviour changes dramatically when strongly decreasing the equilibrium contact angle , i.e. , when approaching the completely wetting case that is normally studied in the literature . when increasing the velocity of rotation in this case we have seen a transition from pendant drops underneath the cylinder to a nearly uniform film around the cylinder as @xcite .",
    "the presented results indicate that it may be very fruitful to further explore the analogy of films / drops on rotating cylinders and heterogeneous substrates .",
    "we expect that the recent exploration of the three - dimensional case for depinning drops @xcite and for the various transitions between ridge , drop and rivulet states @xcite based on tools for the continuation of steady and stationary solutions of the two - dimensional thin film equation ( physically three - dimensional system ) @xcite is also relevant for the case of a rotating cylinder .",
    "a future study could , e.g. , elucidate the relation between the formation of azimuthal rings , pendant ridges and sets of drops .",
    "the present circular cylinder is an analogy to a sinusoidal wettability profile .",
    "cylinders with other cross sections , for instance , an elliptical cylinder @xcite would correspond to more localised defects of the corresponding heterogeneous substrate .",
    "however , the analogue system turns out to be more complicated as a rotating non - circular cylinder introduces the aspect of a time - periodic non - harmonic forcing parallel to the substrate into the heterogeneous substrate system .",
    "our equation ( [ eq : film - sca ] ) is derived under two conditions : ( i ) the mean ( and also the maximal ) film thickness has to be small as compared to the radius of the cylinder ; and ( ii ) the local surface slope ( e.g. , the physical equilibrium contact angle ) has to be small .",
    "here we have assumed that the two related smallness parameters are of the same order of magnitude . in a next step",
    "one may introduce two different smallness parameters and discuss a number of distinct limits in dependence of their ratio .",
    "such a systematic asymptotic study would also permit to discuss the influence of other effects on the depinning behaviour like , for instance , the effects of the hydrostatic pressure @xcite , centrifugal forces @xcite and inertia @xcite .",
