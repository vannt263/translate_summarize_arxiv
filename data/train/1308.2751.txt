    "dynein and kinesin are two such proteins which perform directed motion on microtubules , in opposite directions . while a complete understanding of the process remains an open question , various plausible mechanisms leading to the directed transport",
    "have been discussed in the literature@xcite .",
    "motor - driven cargo transport on cytoskeletal network interests biologists and physicists alike because of its relevance in understanding spatial organization of various organelles inside eukaryotic cells and because of the opportunities it provides for detailed quantitative modeling@xcite .",
    "although the primary purpose of molecular motors would appear to be fast unidirectional transport , many motor driven cargoes on microtubule filaments are found to move in bidirectional fashion@xcite . while tug - of - war ( tow ) model explains bidirectional transport as a natural consequence of motors of opposite polarity ( eg .",
    ", kinesin and dynein ) being simultaneously active and exerting forces on the cargo@xcite , regulated coordination model presumes the presence of a coordinating complex in the cargo which permits only one set of motors to be active at any point of time .",
    "a typical bidirectional cargo is hauled by several motors of opposite directionality , and would have a definite drift towards the plus or minus end of the filament .",
    "a characteristic trajectory of bidirectional cargo hauled by five dyneins and a kinesin , generated in our simulations is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1](a ) ( see ref.@xcite for details ) .",
    "such a motion may be visualized as a biased random walk @xcite , with unidirectional runs separated by pause states . in a recent in vitro experimental study , presence of memory in bidirectional motion",
    "was observed @xcite , wherein a bidirectional cargo stalled by an optical trap while moving was found to move preferentially in the pre - stall direction after detachment from the filament under the influence of the trap . while a detailed study of this experiment is outside the scope of the present paper , it is pertinent to ask : is motor protein - powered bidirectional organelle transport a markovian random walk ?    in the present paper ,",
    "we study the history dependence of bidirectional cargo motion powered by molecular motors within the framework of the stochastic tow model .",
    "our rigorous mathematical calculations , supported by stochastic simulations , show that bidirectional motor - mediated transport is a non - markovian random walk , characterized by multi - exponential waiting time distributions .",
    "interestingly , a recent theoretical work @xcite has studied the effects of pre - assigned memory in transition rates on bidirectional cargo transport , but does not discuss its origins .",
    "by contrast , our work shows explicitly how memory emerges as a consequence of the degeneracy of the states of motion of the cargo , when hauled by multiple motor teams .",
    "we also find that correlation between run directions is likely to extend to several tow events in typical experimental situations .",

    "however , typically in such cases , the underlying mechanism behind persistence of direction is not precisely known .",
    "bidirectional cargo transport by molecular motors , on the other hand , can be reconstituted in vitro and the number of cargo - bound motors estimated using optical trap ; therefore , it is a much more controllable system compared to the previous examples .",
    "further , the underlying fundamental processes ( binding and unbinding of individual motors ) are markovian , and therefore , the present system constitutes a fine illustration of how apparent non - markovian behavior emerges from purely markovian state transitions underneath .",
    "the stochastic tow model @xcite , assumes a fixed number of minus - moving dyneins ( @xmath0 ) and plus - moving kinesins ( @xmath1 ) on a cargo .",
    "each motor on the cargo binds to and unbinds from the microtubule stochastically with rates @xmath2 and @xmath3 respectively , with @xmath4 subscript for kinesin and @xmath5 for dynein , while it is assumed that the motors always remain bound to the cargo .",
    "when opposite - polarity motors engage simultaneously with the track , each filament - bound motor exerts force on the cargo in their respective direction , resulting in a net force on the cargo in one of the directions . this net force experienced by both sets of motors",
    "is called ` load ' and is generally assumed to be shared equally among all the motors which move in same direction .",
    "it is now well - established that the detachment rates @xmath3 depend on the load per motor , while the attachment rates are generally found to be independent of load . based on kramers rate theory ,",
    "it is generally assumed that this load - dependence of detachment rates is exponential , i.e. , @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is usually called the detachment force and @xmath8 is the load per motor .",
    "however , recent investigations@xcite have shown that the load - dependence of the dissociation rate of dynein ( but not kinesin@xcite ) deviates significantly from exponential behavior in the super - stall regime .",
    "therefore , we adopt the exponential load - dependence for kinesin s detachment rate , whereas for dynein , we assume exponential dependence up to the stall force , beyond which the rate is insensitive to load@xcite . this model is roughly consistent with in vitro experimental observations@xcite , and has been attributed to a catch - bond situation in the motor - filament interaction@xcite .",
    "further details of the model , especially regarding its implementation in numerical simulations may be found in @xcite , as well as our earlier paper@xcite .",
    "the load - dependence of the detachment rates significantly affects the properties of bidirectional cargo motion , and is a necessary feature in the model so as to reproduce experimentally observed features of the saltatory motion of cargoes , e.g. , lipid droplets in _ drosophila_@xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it turns out from our study that it is not crucial to understand the origin of memory in bidirectional transport .",
    "for this reason , we first develop our formalism with load - independent detachment rates and include load dependence in numerical simulations in the later stages , where we study biologically relevant situations .",
    "as it turns out , load - dependence of motor detachment rate introduces only a quantitative modification of the parameters of interest in this context .    in the stochastic tow model , with the elapse of time , the number @xmath9 of actively hauling dyneins ( kinesins ) change , such that @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "it may be noted that for a given source state @xmath12 of the cargo , there are between two to four possible target states : @xmath13 and @xmath14 , subject to the bounds above .",
    "consequently , the cargo switches between different states : plus - moving state(s ) when only kinesins are active , minus - moving state(s ) when only dyneins are active , tow state(s ) when both kind of motors are active together and finally , the detached state when all the motors are inactive on the cargo@xcite . in fig.[fig :",
    "fig1](b ) corresponding motility states of cargo are shown for two simple cases @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "we should notice that , when two dyneins and a kinesin are hauling a cargo , both minus - run ( @xmath17 and @xmath18 ) and tow state ( @xmath19 and @xmath20 ) become _ degenerate_. in general , both run and pause states of the cargo become degenerate when more than one motor is used in one or either directions .",
    "let @xmath21 represent the set of all minus - moving states of the cargo , @xmath22 represent all plus - moving states , @xmath23 represent all tow states and @xmath24 represent the completely detached state .",
    "let @xmath25 be the probability that a cargo in plus - run enters a tow ( without detaching from the filament ) and then switches direction , with unspecified durations spent in plus run and tow ; this may hence be defined as the direction reversal probability for the plus state , while @xmath26 gives the same for the minus state .",
    "then , direction preserving probabilities are given by the normalization conditions @xmath27    given these probabilities , we define the memory parameter@xcite @xmath28    such that @xmath29 means no memory , while @xmath30 means that the probability of finding the cargo in a certain run state is dependent on its run direction preceding the tow",
    ". memory of direction , as defined above , is distinct from a possible overall bias in the motion of cargo towards plus or minus directions .",
    "the bias parameter may be defined as    @xmath31    where @xmath32 and @xmath33 give the probabilities for a tow to terminate in plus and minus run , respectively .",
    "intuitively , it appears likely that memory must affect the bias in transport , however no general relation between the two is known , to the best of our knowledge .",
    "nevertheless , it can be shown that , if the probability of cargo dissociating completely from microtubule is very small , @xmath34 ( see eq.[eq : eq12 ] later , and also appendix b ) , where we define    @xmath35    as the asymmetry coefficient in the transport . in the present problem ,",
    "however , there is a non - zero probability for the cargo to completely detach from the filament , and therefore the above relation holds only in situations where this can be neglected .    if the plus and minus run lengths are constants and have the same value , then @xmath36 alone determines the average direction of motion of the cargo , i.e. , the sign of the drift velocity @xmath37",
    "this is a standard assumption in most mathematical studies of the persistent random walk , but is unrealistic in our case , as the plus and minus run durations are strongly dependent on the binding and unbinding rates of the motors@xcite , which also determine @xmath38 and @xmath36 . in the present paper ,",
    "we focus on memory , bias and directional correlations as appropriate to a random walk - like picture of the motion ; a complete characterization of bidirectional motion also requires identification of the different regimes of transport as well as a detailed study of drift and diffusion coefficients of the walk .",
    "we certainly hope to address these issues in a later publication .",
    "we now develop the mathematical formalism required to derive explicit expressions for the memory parameter . from a state @xmath39 of a cargo ,",
    "the probability of transition to another state @xmath40 at a time between @xmath41 and @xmath42 is @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the ( constant ) rate for the @xmath45 transition and @xmath46 is the _ survival probability _ , defined as the probability for the cargo to stay in state @xmath39 during the interval @xmath47 $ ] .",
    "because the active / inactive configuration of cargo - bound motors determine the state @xmath39 , @xmath48 can be expressed in terms of survival probability of a motor in active state , i.e. , @xmath49 and inactive state , i.e. , @xmath50 , on the cargo .",
    "the probability of the transition is @xmath51 , and its steady state limit @xmath52 , is a two - point green function ( ` bare ' propagator ) , which is fundamental to our analysis .",
    "one may , similarly , define a 3-point green function @xmath53 in the problem , i.e. , the probability for the system to trace a certain a history of states @xmath54 during a time interval @xmath47 $ ] , having started from @xmath39 at @xmath55 .",
    "given the markovian nature of the underlying process , this probability is expressed in the form of a convolution in time : @xmath56 .",
    "it follows that , in the long time limit , the steady state probability @xmath57 is expressed as the product : @xmath58    it is now important to define a set of generalized two - point green functions @xmath59 , which , for ease of distinction , we shall refer to as ` dressed ' propagators .",
    "the difference between the bare and dressed propagators may be explained with an example : whereas @xmath60 is the probability for the cargo to be in a tow state @xmath61 , after having spent an unspecified duration of time in the minus - moving state @xmath62 ( with no other state transitions in between ) , @xmath63 includes an indefinite number of cyclic transitions between the various ( degenerate ) @xmath64 states , but fixed initial and final states @xmath62 and @xmath61 . from both types of propagators , higher order green functions",

    "the two - point green functions immediately follow : @xmath71 the direction reversal of plus - run through a tow corresponds to the transition path @xmath72 while that of minus - run corresponds to the path @xmath73 , with @xmath74 and @xmath75 being the respective three - point green functions representing the processes . on the other hand , @xmath76 and @xmath77",
    "paths correspond to direction preserving transitions through a tow of a plus and minus run respectively ( with green functions @xmath78 and @xmath79 ) .",

    "the corresponding survival probabilities are @xmath92 and @xmath93 . from these probabilities , and with the identification of the relevant rates , the bare propagators follow : @xmath94 however , because of the possibility of cyclic transitions between degenerate states , in the present case , the dressed propagators @xmath59 are more useful , which are related to their bare counterparts through equations analogous to dyson s equation in quantum field theory . for example , it is easily seen that , for @xmath95 , @xmath96 , where @xmath97 is the probability for the cyclic transition @xmath98 .",

    "random walk models have found a large number of applications in modeling various kinds of biological transport phenomena ( see e.g. , @xcite for a review ) .",
    "the bidirectional transport of cargoes like mitochondria , lipid droplets , endosomes , phagosomes etc in eukaryotic cells is also akin to a random walk on microtubule filaments .",
    "it is clear that for functional reasons , this walk is likely to be biased ; certain cargoes need to be moved to the interior of the cell , while certain others may need to be transported to the outer cell membrane",
    ". the underlying molecular mechanisms of bidirectional transport have been studied in a great deal of detail , both experimentally and via biophysical modeling . however , barring a few papers , much less attention has been paid to the statistical properties of the walk itself , which motivated us to undertake this study .",
    "our focus here was on understanding correlations between successive run directions of a cargo moving bidirectionally , being transported by two opposing teams of kinesins and dyneins . by studying a memory parameter constructed using direction reversal probabilities",
    ", we showed that memory in direction is a generic property of this motion , which appears when at least one team of motors has more than one member .",
    "tow between two single motors on either side , however , results in a biased random walk of the cargo without memory .",
    "interestingly , the memory parameter is found to be a non - monotonic function of the number of motors and , for fixed binding / unbinding rates , is maximized for a certain motor number .",
    "we also find that the effective interaction between the opposing motor teams which emerges out of the load - dependence of the individual unbinding rates , enhances this memory .",
    "for one set of experimentally measured binding and unbinding rates for dynein and kinesin ( in vitro studies using motor proteins from _",
    "d. discoideum _ , see table [ tab : tab1 ] ) , we estimated that the correlation in run direction could persist up to 2 - 3 tow events for typical motor numbers ( in this case , the upper limit corresponds to 1 - 2 kinesins and 8 - 12 dyneins ) .",
    "correlated random walks with memory and persistence have been the subject of a large number of mathematical studies@xcite . in the models studied in these papers , at each instant",
    ", the walker takes a step of fixed size in a certain direction , the probability for which depends on one ( usually ) or more previous steps that have been taken .",
    "it has been shown that , in one dimension , after appropriate limiting procedures , the equation that describes the asymptotic properties of such a walk is the telegraphers equation@xcite , which reduces to ( a ) the standard diffusion equation in the long - time limit , and ( b ) the wave equation in the short - time limit . the demarcation of these regimes is determined by the time scale over which the steps remain correlated .",
    "the bidirectional transport model studied in this paper , clearly falls under the class of a correlated random walk , but with some additional and unique features : ( a ) the run duration , equivalent to the step size of the random walk , is not a constant , but determined by binding and unbinding rates of the motors ( b ) the tow / pause state can have a non - zero velocity ( but small compared to run states ) depending on the number of opposing motors ( c ) the cargo may detach as a whole from the filament , which rules out steady state behavior of the green functions , even in the long - time limit .",
    "it would be interesting to see if a continuum equation , analogous to the telegraphers equation , could be constructed for the present problem in the long - time limit , taking into account these modifications , and to study its properties .",
    "it is also pertinent to note that given the finite size of the cell , the biologically relevant time regime need not necessarily be the long - time limit mentioned above , but could be the memory - dominated short - time limit .",
    "if this is true , the presence of multiple motors in a team could function as a mechanism to provide a semi - deterministic character to the cargo motion .",
    "the implications of this conjecture , as well as its systematic verification remain to be done and are among our future goals",
    ".    the mathematical and computational results in this paper should be verifiable in experiments .",
    "detailed time - traces of cargo trajectories in bidirectional motion have been obtained from both in vitro and in vivo experiments@xcite . by analyzing such trajectories",
    ", it should be possible to measure the memory parameter @xmath38 and correlate it with the number of motors estimated by other means ( eg .",
    "optical trap stalls ) . in in vivo situations ,",
    "our results and methods may be found useful in the estimation of the number of motors involved in the transport process . above all",
    ", we believe that our study will stimulate further interest in understanding the statistical properties of bidirectional cargo motion .",

    "the calculation of direction reversal or direction preserving probabilities ( @xmath127 ) in this paper utilizes the concept of dressed propagators @xmath59 , which we had constructed using the more fundamental bare propagators @xmath128 .",
    "the dressed propagator @xmath129 includes infinite cyclic transitions between degenerate @xmath39 states ( @xmath130 ) of the cargo , for given initial and final states . in the present formalism , the modification of the bare propagators by these cyclic transitions involved summing a geometric series .",
    "however , this method is not the unique ; @xmath59 can be also determined using a somewhat different method called ` method of splitting probabilities ' @xcite .",
    "let us consider a stochastic process with more than one absorbing state .",
    "the splitting probability for a certain absorbing state is defined as the probability that the system reaches it before reaching the others . in other words , it is the transition probability to one of its absorbing states . as the system has to be absorbed in one of these states in the long - time limit , the sum of all splitting probabilities is equal to unity .",
    "the bare propagators @xmath131 , defined in @xmath15 and @xmath16 cases are indeed splitting probabilities as they are the transition probabilities between a starting state @xmath39 and a final state @xmath40 , the latter being treated temporarily as an absorbing state .",
    "the dressed propagators @xmath129 defined in @xmath16 case are higher order splitting probabilities in this sense , and can be constructed out of the bare propagators .",
    "it is known that the splitting probabilities follow certain identity relations@xcite , which are specific to each problem . here",
    ", we exploit this feature to determine the dressed propagators @xmath129 for the case @xmath16 .",
    "let , @xmath132 or @xmath133 , and @xmath134 or @xmath133 such that @xmath135 .",
    "then , the splitting probabilities @xmath136 and @xmath137 ( @xmath102 ) can be easily seen to satisfy the identities    @xmath138    solving which , it follows that    @xmath139    which are seen to be identical to the relations in eq.[eq:3++ ] , for all combinations of initial and final states .",
    "starting from the definition in eq.[eq : eq1++ ] , for a @xmath16 system , we have @xmath140 ( @xmath141 ) . using the parameters @xmath142 defined in sec .",
    "iii a , we arrive at the following relation :    @xmath143    from eq.[eq : eq7 ] , we have    @xmath144    the following normalization conditions clearly apply :    @xmath145    where the terms @xmath146 and @xmath147 give the probability of complete detachment of the cargo , from initial states @xmath90 and @xmath62 respectively .",
    "let us now assume @xmath148 , and use the identity @xmath149 in eq.[eq : eq21a ] , which leads to @xmath150 .",
    "finally , using eq.[eq : eq21b ] in eq.[eq : eq6b ] and using the relation @xmath151 leads to a second relation @xmath152 . using these approximate relations in eq.[eq : eq24c ]",
    ", we arrive at the equation    @xmath153    the substitution of which in eq.[eq : eq23 ] leads to the expression in eq.[eq : eq12 ] , after realizing that @xmath154 and using the definition of the asymmetry coefficient @xmath155 in eq.[eq : eq1 + ] .",
    "further , using the relation @xmath156 along with the condition of normalization ( @xmath157 ) in eq.[eq : eq22 ] , it can also be shown that ,    @xmath158",
