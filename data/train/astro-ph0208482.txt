    "in an attempt to develop a unified understanding of the different morphological classes of dwarf galaxies , efforts have been made to relate the various observed types through some evolutionary scheme .",
    "a number of scenarios have been proposed ( see skillman & bender 1995 , ferrara & tolstoy 2000 for excellent reviews ) .",
    "one possibility is that the gas - rich dwarf irregulars ( dis ) go through an extremely strong burst of star formation , lose the majority of their gas after the starburst event , and eventually fade and evolve into the gas - poor dwarf ellipticals ( des ) . during the bursting phase",
    ", the dis would resemble massive hii regions .",
    "another possibility is that the dis and des have common progenitors but have evolved differently because of environmental effects .",
    "although these schemes are highly debated , they form a good context for investigating the comparative structural properties of the different classes of dwarfs .",
    "several questions arise when considering these evolutionary scenarios .",
    "can _ any _ di initiate a large star - formation episode and appear as a bcd ?",
    "in other words , is the bcd phenomenon a stage of galaxy evolution common to all gas - rich dwarfs or only to a select sub - sample with special characteristics ?",
    "further , do the progenitor galaxies go through repeated intense bursts of activity , or is the bursting phase unique in the object s lifetime ?",
    "if the bursts repeat , then what fraction of the time is the galaxy bursting ( i.e. , what is the duty cycle ) ? answers to these questions can also help us to determine if starbursting dwarfs can be used as a fair tracer of the more general population of low - mass galaxies . since starbursting dwarfs are far more easily detected than their quiescent counterparts ,",
    "this issue is of great importance to investigations of the faint - end / low - mass tails of the luminosity / hi mass functions , and to studies of large - scale structure , particularly since low - mass galaxies may be less biased and better tracers of the overall mass distribution ( e.g. santiago & da costa 1990 , loveday et al .",
    "1995 , lee et al .",
    "1999 ) .    within this context ,",
    "it is interesting to study the hi properties of low luminosity star - forming galaxies , since the quantity of hi indicates the amount of fuel available for driving a starburst .",
    "additional constraints may be placed on the star - formation history and chemical evolution of bursting dwarfs when hi data are used in conjunction with the star - formation rates and abundances inferred from optical spectroscopy .",
    "also , dynamical masses of these systems may be estimated from the velocity widths of hi profiles . with this combination of optical and radio information ,",
    "it is possible to assess the plausibility of gas - rich dis as progenitors of bursting dwarfs , and to attempt to answer the questions posed above .",
    "one can further study the differences in the distribution of hi in various morphological types by obtaining hi interferometric maps .",
    "this is generally only done after initial single - dish hi observations have been made and viable candidates for interferometric mapping have been identified .",
    "hence , observations of the neutral gas content of bursting dwarfs is an important step toward a more complete understanding of this class of galaxy .",
    "previous 21-cm observations of star - forming dwarf galaxies ( thuan & martin 1981 ; gordon & gottesman 1981 ; staveley - smith , davies & kinman 1992 ; thuan et al .",
    "1999 ; smoker et al .",
    "2000 ; salzer et al .",
    "2002 ) have been fruitful in establishing the properties of their neutral gas .",
    "however , the samples used in these previous studies are comprised of objects from a number of different catalogs .",
    "for example , thuan and martin ( 1981 ) used a combination of dwarfs from the markarian , haro and zwicky catalogs , while salzer et al .",
    "( 2002 ) selected dwarfs from the michigan , wasilewski and case surveys , in addition to the catalogs used by thuan and martin .",
    "hi observations are needed for a complete , uniformly selected sample of dwarf galaxies since the studies which are based on such heterogeneous collections of objects may be biased in unrecognized ways .",
    "to remedy this situation , we have obtained hi observations for a new , ultra - deep , complete sample of actively star - forming , low luminosity galaxies using the arecibo observatory 305-m radio telescope .",
    "our sample consists of low luminosity ( m@xmath13 ) , nearby ( @xmath1411,000 km s@xmath2 ) , h@xmath3 selected galaxies from the first survey strip of the kpno international spectroscopic survey ( kiss ) ( salzer et al .",
    "2000 , hereafter paper i ; salzer et al .",
    "2001 , hereafter kiss red 1 [ kr1 ] ) , a new objective prism survey for extragalactic emission - line objects . in this paper",
    ", we present the 21-cm hi line observations of the overall sample .",
    "the remaining sections are organized as follows .",
    "an overview of the sample and observational procedures are given in @xmath15 2 .",
    "the hi data are presented @xmath15 3 , and the hi properties are described in @xmath15 4 . finally , our conclusions are summarized in @xmath15 5 .",
    "suggestions for further work involving the dwarf candidates in this sample are given throughout the paper .",
    "all distance dependent quantities assume h@xmath1675 km s@xmath2 mpc@xmath2 .",
    "objective - prism surveys which select objects on the basis of line - emission , like the kpno international spectroscopic survey ( kiss , see paper i & kr1 ) , are excellent sources of low luminosity galaxies . because the equivalent - widths of the targeted lines generally become larger",
    "as the luminosity of the host galaxy decreases , this technique is extremely effective at detecting intrinsically faint objects and partially helps to overcome the constraints imposed by the malmquist effect on surveys which are magnitude - limited ( see figure 8 in kr1 ) .",
    "in particular , since kiss is the first wide - field objective - prism survey to take advantage of the capabilities of ccd imaging , it has yielded a sample of emission - line galaxies ( elgs ) which is at least two magnitudes fainter than previous line - selected schmidt surveys , providing us with one of the deepest available samples of dwarfs ( see table 2 in paper i ) .",
    "our sample of low luminosity star - forming galaxies is taken from list 1 of the kiss catalog ( kr1 ) .",
    "the portion of sky covered by list 1 was chosen to overlap the century redshift survey ( geller et al .",
    "1997 , wegner et al .",
    "2001 ) , so that comparison with a deep magnitude - selected survey would be possible .",
    "this area is a 1.3 deg wide strip centered on @xmath4b@xmath5 spanning the range @xmath6b@xmath7 to @xmath6b@xmath8 .",
    "the elgs are h@xmath3 selected and have been cataloged in a uniform way ( paper i ) .",
    "the overall sample from list 1 has a well - understood selection function which is based on the line plus continuum flux at h@xmath3 ( gronwall et al .",
    "2002 , also see discussion in @xmath154.5 ) .",
    "we initially specified selection criteria that required targets to have : ( 1 ) spectra characteristic of star - forming galaxies ( hii - region - like spectra which exhibit strong narrow emission lines superimposed on a stellar continuum which rises towards the blue ) , ( 2 ) @xmath17 km s@xmath2 , and ( 3 ) @xmath0 .",
    "when hi observations for this sample began in may 2000 , however , follow - up slit spectral observations had not been completed for the entire list 1 catalog . at that time target selection",
    "was based on the objective - prism estimates of the redshifts for those galaxies that lacked slit spectra .",
    "recessional velocities derived from the coarse ( 24  / pixel ) survey spectra have a 1@xmath18 error of @xmath19830 km s@xmath2 .",
    "about 40% of the galaxies in our original hi sample did not have follow - up spectra .    slit spectral data was subsequently obtained at various telescopes for the remainder of the hi sample over the following spring observing season ( melbourne et al . 2002 ;",
    "wegner et al . 2002 ; salzer et al . 2003 ) .",
    "when redshifts and blue absolute magnitudes were recalculated from the new data , it was found that 9 of our original targets no longer met our luminosity and/or recessional velocity criteria .",
    "however , three of these galaxies had absolute magnitudes only nominally brighter than @xmath20 , so we decided to retain these in the sample ( see table 1 and figure 1 ) .",
    "an additional 5 galaxies which were not in our original sample were then found to be within the specified limits .",
    "these were added to the sample towards the end of our 2001 observing run .",
    "the final hi sample contains a total of 109 galaxies .",
    "when compared with the overall kiss sample , the hi sub - sample has a brighter median @xmath21 ( 17.54 versus 18.08 ) , which indicates that the low - luminosity galaxies are generally found nearby .",
    "this is due in large part to the velocity limit of 11,000 km s@xmath2imposed on the hi sample .",
    "the median velocity of the hi sample ( 7809 km s@xmath2 ) is only @xmath1140% the median velocity of the full kiss sample ( 18,407 km s@xmath2 ) . for comparison ,",
    "the median m@xmath22 of the salzer et al .",
    "( 2002 ) hi sample of dwarf star - forming galaxies is 15.7 , while that of galaxies observed in the staveley - smith et al.(1992 ) study is 15.1 . in other words ,",
    "our current sample is substantially fainter than those found in all previous studies of this class of galaxy .",
    "the median @xmath23 color of the kiss hi sample , 0.51 , is much bluer than that of the parent sample , which has a median @xmath23 of 0.67 , the typical color of an sb galaxy ( roberts & haynes 1994 ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that the value of 0.51 is comparable to the median @xmath23 of 0.54 for the [ oiii]-selected university of michigan objective - prism survey ( salzer et al .",
    "this is one indication that the low - luminosity , low - metallicity galaxies preferentially found in [ oiii ] surveys are also included in h@xmath3 selected surveys ( see paper i , @xmath154 for further discussion ) .",
    "the luminosity distribution of the hi sample ( figure 1 ) has a median of @xmath2416.87 , which is about the luminosity of the small magellanic cloud ( van den bergh 2000 ) .",
    "overall , our targets are brighter that those found in hi surveys of dwarf galaxies such as that of salzer et al .",
    "( 2002 ) which has median @xmath25 of @xmath2416.1 , and staveley - smith et al .",
    "( 1992 ) who imposed a luminosity limit of @xmath2616.0 .",
    "hi observations of 109 local ( @xmath17 km s@xmath2 ) , low luminosity ( @xmath0 ) kiss emission - line galaxies were carried out with the arecibo observatory 305-m radio telescope during may 2000 and from may to july 2001 .",
    "approximately 90% of our data was taken with the l - narrow receiver at the upgraded gregorian feed .",
    "this receiver functions at an average system temperature of 30 k. the less sensitive l - wide receiver ( t@xmath27 38 k ) was used for three nights in may 2000 , when the l - narrow receiver was off - line .",
    "the four subcorrelator boards were each configured with 2048 channels and centered at the recessional velocity found from the target s optical spectrum .",
    "nine - level sampling was used .",
    "two boards were operated in a `` lower - resolution mode '' using a 25 mhz bandwidth , resulting in a channel spacing of 2.6 km s@xmath2at 1420 mhz , while two boards were used in a `` higher - resolution mode '' using a 12.5 mhz bandwidth , resulting in a channel spacing of 1.3 km s@xmath2at 1420 mhz .",
    "the boards in each of the resolution modes recorded signals in independent , opposite circular polarizations , which are subsequently combined in the reduction process .",
    "observations were made in total power mode with 5 minute on - source , 5 minute off - source pairs , followed by 10 second on - off noise diode calibration pairs . during the integrations ,",
    "data dumps occurred every 6 seconds .",
    "this high sampling rate allowed for spurious , intermittent radio frequency interference ( rfi ) to be excised during the reduction process without sacrificing large amounts of integration time . with the exception of a few particularly strong lined sources , a minimum of 4 on - off pairs were taken for each target .    when possible , observations were made after astronomical sunset to avoid problems with solar interference . however , since many of our time blocks were scheduled to begin around sunset , about 10% of our observations show its effects and have sinusoidal variations in their baselines .",
    "( for example , see kissr 1 in the first panel of figure 2 . )",
    "notes on other galaxies similarly affected are given in table 2 .",
    "system checks were performed at the beginning of each run by observing strong , non - variable continuum point sources from an unpublished list of unconfused calibrator sources prepared from the nrao vla sky survey ( nvss ) by jim condon and qi feng yi , which is made available to observers through a catalog in the arecibo telescope control gui .",
    "the data were reduced with the analyz software package , using appropriate l - band gain , zenith angle and azimuth corrections for the refurbished arecibo dish and standard averaging and calibration routines .",
    "intermittent broadband interference , such as the gps l3 signal at 1381 mhz , were removed by entirely omitting the 6-second scans in which they appeared from the averaging procedure .",
    "narrow single - channel interference spikes were manually removed and the average value of the two adjacent channels was substituted . in both cases ,",
    "rfi was removed only when it appeared within 500 km s@xmath2 of the center of the observed line .",

    "of these 97 , eight are weak detections with 2.5 @xmath46 5.8 .",
    "our non - detections are generally objects that were added to the sample towards the end of our arecibo observing run in 2001 ( see @xmath152.1 ) and that suffered from solar interference and/or insufficient integration times .",
    "they are not preferentially galaxies that have weak 21-cm signals .",
    "it is important to pay careful attention to the possibility of source confusion within the arecibo beam for this particular sample .",
    "this is because the majority of targets are very small compared to the @xmath47 half power beam width , and the linear distance subtended by the beam at the average recessional velocity for our sample ( @xmath118000 km s@xmath2 ) is 0.1 mpc , which is on the order of the mean projected separation of a loose association of dwarf galaxies .    to check for possible contamination of the observed fluxes by nearby companions ,",
    "the area within a radius of 7  of each of the targets was searched for potential neighbors .",
    "this examination , which was performed on the kiss composite @xmath29 and @xmath30-band survey images , covers an area which includes both the telescope s main beam and first sidelobe , whose peak is located @xmath48 away from the peak of the main lobe and has a relative intensity of @xmath115% ( heiles et al .",
    "our determination of actual confusion was based on three factors : ( 1 ) the transverse distance of the neighbor to the target , ( 2 ) the optical brightness of the neighbor compared with the target , and ( 3 ) the velocity difference between the neighbor and the target .",
    "the kiss catalog , century redshift survey catalog and the nasa extragalactic database ( ned ) were all searched for redshifts of the potential neighbors .    after the first round of examinations , it was concluded that neighboring objects which appeared within the sidelobes , but outside of the main beam , did not significantly contribute to the observed flux of the target .",
    "this conclusion was based on examples of bright galaxies that appeared within the sidelobes and were offset from the target velocity by several hundred km s@xmath2 , but did not produce observable emission at the velocity reported in the literature .",
    "the clearest illustrations of this are in the spectra of kissr 96 and kissr 97 .",
    "ugc 7836 , an edge - on scd galaxy with @xmath21 = 14.83 , is located 55 to the ne of kissr 96 and 56 to the se of kissr 97 at 9337 km s@xmath2 . as anticipated",
    ", this galaxy has a strong , broad ( @xmath49 480 km s@xmath2 ) double - horned profile ( haynes et al .",
    "1997 ) , characteristic of a gas - rich , late - type spiral .",
    "however , in the spectrum of kissr 96 , there is only one narrow line centered on 9200 km s@xmath2 with no emission appearing above @xmath119300 km s@xmath2 .",
    "meanwhile , in spectrum of kissr 97 , although there _ is _ a double - horned profile , it is centered on the optical velocity of the target .",
    "further , the hi profile of kiss 97 is fairly narrow ( @xmath49 190 km s@xmath2 ) compared to the width of u7836 s 21-cm line , and no emission appears below @xmath11 9300 km s@xmath2 .",
    "cgcg 159 - 053 , an interacting galaxy pair which is 54 e of kissr 97 at 6905 km s@xmath2 , is not detected either .",
    "therefore , since the sidelobe companions of all of the other targets in our sample are substantially fainter than u7836 or cgcg 159 - 053 , they were not considered to be sources of contamination .",
    "thus , observations are considered to be confused only if the companions ( 1 ) are within the main beam , ( 2 ) have optical brightnesses greater than or comparable to the target and ( 3 ) have published redshifts that place them within 200 km s@xmath2 of the target . in this sample , there are 10 galaxies that meet these criteria .",
    "they are kissr 146 , 148 , 256 , 257 , 265 , 356 , 401 , 404 , 405 , and 1013 . for five of these galaxies ( 256 , 257 , 265 , 404 , 405 ) we list conservative upper - limits for the flux in table 1 , while for two of the galaxies ( 356 , 1013 ) we list fluxes which have been revised based on additional available information ( see @xmath15 3.3 ) .",
    "no data are listed in table 1 for three targets ( 146 , 148 , 401 ) that are confused with sources much brighter than the targets themselves .",
    "instead , the results of observing these confused regions are given in our notes on individual galaxies in table 2 . in table 2",
    ", observations are cited as possibly , but not likely to be confused if the target has companions which are within or on the outer periphery of the main beam , but are dimmer than the target galaxy and have no published redshift .",
    "twenty - four galaxies have been noted as possibly , but unlikely to be , confused .",
    "the fluxes reported in table 1 for these galaxies are the original observed quantities .",
    "alternate names for our targets given by other catalogs are also listed in table 2 .",
    "upper limits on the fluxes of the 12 targets which were undetected in hi were calculated by assuming rectangular profiles with heights corresponding to 3@xmath18 fluctuations in the baseline and widths based on the boundary of points in the log(m@xmath22)-log(w@xmath39 ) plane ( figure 4 ) . in figure 4 , the dashed line indicates the upper envelope of observed widths in this sample . an undetected target s luminosity",
    "is used to find its upper - limit width using these lines .",
    "for 5 of the 10 confused sources , the observed composite hi flux was taken as the upper - limit . in the spectra of kissr 265",
    ", there is contamination from kissr 266 ( @xmath31 = 9495 km s@xmath2 ) , which is not in the hi sample , and from another previously unobserved galaxy 17 sw from the target .",
    "all of these galaxies are comparable in brightness , and the observed flux itself is taken as an upper limit . kissr 404 and 405 are separated by 04 and are of comparable optical brightness and diameter .",
    "two independent pointings at each of these targets produce lines that are similar in strength and shape .",
    "so , it is possible that one of the sources is responsible for all of the flux .",
    "again , we assign the observed flux as the upper limit for both kissr 404 and 405 .",
    "the same reasoning holds for kissr 256 and 257 , which are separated by 19 .",
    "no data are listed in table 1 for three targets that are confused with neighboring sources which are much brighter than the targets themselves ( kissr 146 , 148 , 401 ) . in the spectra of kissr 146 and 148 ,",
    "the measured flux is a combination of emission from three galaxies , kissr 146 , kissr 148 and ugc 8033 ( = kissr 147 ) , a large spiral galaxy which is most likely producing the majority of the emission .",
    "the hi profile of kissr 401 is clearly a superposition of multiple lines and is due to the target itself plus two other kiss galaxies not in this sample , kissr 399 and 400 .",
    "the target is the faintest optical source among the trio . observed fluxes and widths from the confused regions are instead given in the notes in table 2 .",
    "for the remaining two confused sources , the observed fluxes are revised based on information available in the optical images and in the shape of the 21-cm line . in the field of kissr 356 , there is a neighboring high - inclination spiral galaxy of comparable optical brightness within the beam .",
    "although this spiral galaxy does not have a published redshift , there are several other galaxies outside the main beam which have observed velocities that cluster around 10,500 km s@xmath2 .",
    "thus , there is a strong possibility that the unidentified spiral companion is a member of this group and has a similar velocity .",
    "furthermore , the observed profile of kissr 356 appears to be a superposition of a narrow - peaked source and a broad - lined source .",
    "thus , we assume that the broad portion of the profile originates from the spiral companion and that the flux due to the target is contained within the narrow portion of profile .",
    "the flux and widths reported for kissr 356 are measured by fitting a baseline to the top of the broad portion of the profile , and integrating over the narrow peak . for kissr 1013 ,",
    "arguments for the revised flux are in the inverse sense of those just given for kissr 356 . in this case",
    "the target is a high - inclination disk - like system while the neighbor is lsb dwarf without a published redshift , and the radio spectrum again appears to be a superposition of broad and narrow emission - lines .",
    "the reported flux and widths for kissr 1013 is based on a measurement of the area within the broad portion of the profile .",
    "corrections to the observed flux for beamwidth are not necessary for the majority of galaxies in the sample since the apparent sizes of the galaxies are considerably smaller than the arecibo beam . galaxies for which the correction factor has been determined to be greater than 3% are listed in table 3 .",
    "these factors have been calculated following the methods of staveley - smith et al .",
    "( 1992 ) and thuan & martin ( 1981 ) , where the hi distribution is modeled as an elliptical gaussian .",
    "the correction for the source to beam size ratio is given by : @xmath50 \\big[1 + \\big(\\frac{b_{hi}}{\\theta}\\big)^2 \\big]\\ ] ] where @xmath51 is the half - power beamwidth ( hpbw ) of the telescope , @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the half - power major and minor axes diameters of the neutral gas distribution , and all quantities are expressed in units of arcminutes .",
    "the beam shape of the arecibo telescope is elliptical with major and minor axes aligned with azimuth and zenith angle directions . at @xmath54 ,",
    "the hpbw@xmath55 is a minimum at 366 and the hpbw@xmath56 is a maximum at 314 , so @xmath51 is taken as 33 ( heiles 2001 ) .",
    "the hi distribution is assumed to follow that of the optical light , and the hi diameters are taken to be twice the optical diameters measured at a 25 @xmath29-mag arcsec@xmath57 ellipse .",
    "this value for @xmath58 and @xmath59 is based on the hi interferometric mapping of blue compact dwarfs by van zee et al .",
    "( 1998 , 2001 ) .    with the exception of kissr 1048 ( ugc 10445 ) ,",
    "the beam correction factors in table 3 are all less than 33% ( @xmath60=1.33 for kissr 73 , a nearby diffuse low surface brightness galaxy ) , with @xmath61 ) . for kissr 1048 ,",
    "we have computed a factor of 2.07 , which yields a corrected flux integral of 36.71 jy km s@xmath2 . in comparison , haynes et al .",

    "we note that the three most metal - poor galaxies ( 12 + log(o / h)@xmath98 ) in this sample have an additional _ systematic _ uncertainty associated with their reported metallicities .",

    "this is particularly true for low luminosity galaxies where sites of recent star formation may only be a small fraction of the stellar mass , but contribute a much larger fraction of the total light than in high - luminosity objects . in dwarf",

    "so although the general characteristics of the class of low luminosity galaxies can be established with @xmath102 and @xmath86 , similar analyses with observable quantities more representative of the mass are needed to investigate the specific relationships between the different morphological classes of dwarf galaxies .",
    "a clearer picture may be gained by repeating the above analyses with near - infrared or redder photometry , since the light in these wavebands is less affected by recent star - formation and dust , and is a better measure of the total stellar mass .",
    "two examples of this are in the papers by schombert , mcgaugh & eder ( 2001 ) who examine the relationship between @xmath86 and @xmath25 in the i - band for low surface brightness dwarf galaxies from the second palomar sky survey ( reid et al .",

    "a metal - rich stellar population will contain stars which are both cooler and less luminous than one which is metal - poor , if all other variables , such as the imf are held constant .",
    "this is because an increased metal abundance leads to a greater opacity which will increase the pressure in a star , so that for a given luminosity , the radius is forced to increase and the effective temperature is forced to decrease . in particular , a lower temperature in o and early - type b stars will shift the spectral distribution such that fewer ionizing photons are produced .",
    "thus , metal - poor stars will emit a substantially larger fraction of ionizing photons than higher metallicity stars of the same bolometric luminosity .",
    "therefore , fewer o and b stars , and consequently , a correspondingly lower total mass of formed stars , are required to produce the same amount of h@xmath113 emission in a low metallicity system . since low luminosity star - forming galaxies tend to be metal poor , we would expect the above h@xmath3-based sfr to over - estimate the true sfr for galaxies in this sample .    to compute an approximate metallicity - based correction to the sfr computed in eq . 5",

    "this range represents the ages during which systems are luminous enough in h@xmath3 to be observable by kiss , assuming that 0.45 h@xmath3 photons are produced for every lyman continuum photon and that the kiss detection limit is nearly zero at @xmath119ergs s@xmath2 ( gronwall et al .",
    "the range of ratios of ionizing photons is largest for the lowest metallicity model , which varies from 1.5 to 9 , and smallest for the super - solar model , which varies from 0.4 to 0.6 .",
    "we choose to evaluate sfr(z ) at 15 myr and take the errors in @xmath120 as the spread in @xmath121 with age as shown in figure 10 .",
    "values for @xmath118 are found by linearly interpolating between the points given by the starburst99 .",
    "note that we have linearly extrapolated beyond the lowest metallicity model point of @xmath115 = 0.001 ( 12 + log(o / h)= 7.62 ) , to extract correction factors for 3 objects in our sample with 0.0006 @xmath122 0.001 ( i.e. @xmath123 ) .",

    "the dotted line shows a linear least - squares fit to the solar metallicity based sfrs , while the solid line shows a fit to the sfrs to which correction have been applied .",
    "when metallicity effects are taken into account , the best - fit line for the sample is depressed by @xmath110.5 dex .",
    "the strong correlation between the two plotted variables is also expected , since in dwarf starbursting galaxies , newly - formed stars will dominate the integrated blue light , so that @xmath25 is essentially an indicator of the sfr .",
    "this relation will not necessarily hold for more luminous normal galaxies with lower star formation rate densities .",
    "finally , the effect of the metallicity on the hi gas depletion timescale is considered .",
    "this quantity indicates how much longer a galaxy can continue to sustain its present sfr before its supply of fuel is exhausted .",
    "the distributions of @xmath125 are shown in figure 12 .",

    "the points and their associated ranges show that ( 1 ) the distribution of @xmath127 , when binned by 0.25 dex , does not change significantly when corrections to the sfr are made for burst age , and that ( 2 ) small shifts of the peak of the distribution to larger timescales are more probable than shifts to smaller timescales .",
    "thus , the tendency for metallicity to increase the gas depletion timescale can not be erased by the variation of @xmath125 with burst age , and the difference between the two distributions seems to be real .    when the metallicity is accounted for in the determination of the star formation rate , a much smaller fraction of this sample has gas depletion timescales which constrain their star - formation histories to be composed of short bursts . whereas @xmath126 is smaller than 5 gyr for half of the sample , the corresponding fraction for @xmath127 is only about 10% .",
    "alternatively , many more galaxies can sustain their present sfrs for another hubble time . although @xmath126 is larger than 10 gyr for only @xmath1120% of the sample , it rises to over 70% when metallicity corrections are applied .",
    "these differences emphasize the importance of accurately determined sfr in the application of gas depletion timescales to our understanding of the evolutionary histories of strongly star - forming dwarf galaxies .",
    "blue compact dwarfs , as defined by thuan ( 1991 ) as the set of galaxies with @xmath128 and hii region - like spectra , have been commonly argued to have star - formation histories comprised of short bursts which last @xmath129 yrs interspersed by quiescent periods of @xmath130 yrs .",
    "this picture was based in large part on the need to make the derived solar - metallicity based sfrs ( @xmath131 ) compatible with the observed hi masses ( @xmath132 ) .",
    "our analysis shows that this constraint on the star formation histories is not needed for the overwhelming majority of star - forming dwarf galaxies of the type cataloged by kiss . in other words , star - formation histories which are less bursty , and involve more nearly continuous star formation can and should be considered for these objects . adopting less bursty star - formation histories",
    "also reduces the long standing problem of locating the post - burst counterparts of bcds , which should be very common if the burst duty cycle is as low as 10% , but are not found in existing galaxy samples .    as argued by van zee ( 2001 )",
    ", these longer timescales can be evidence for `` quasi - continuous '' star formation .",
    "however , the quantities as defined above assume that star formation will cease only when _ all _ the hi gas in the galaxy has been processed , and also neglect to account for consumption of molecular gas",
    ". the amount of hi available for star - formation will likely be less than the total hi in the galaxy , since the distribution of hi in low luminosity star - forming galaxies often extends beyond the optical radius , where it exists in a low density state .",
    "corrections for the amount of hi available for star - formation and the molecular gas will therefore work in opposite directions .",
    "although a rough estimate of the fraction of hi involved in star - formation can be made from hi synthesis maps ( e.g. van zee et al 1998 , 2001 ) , a comparable estimate can not be made for the molecular hydrogen content .",
    "this is due to the current difficulty of detecting co in dwarfs and because of our poor knowledge of the co to h@xmath133 conversion factor in these metal deficient systems ( e.g. taylor et al .",
    "thus , the degree to which these two factors will offset each other will not be known until our understanding of the h@xmath133 content of dwarf galaxies is improved .      since",
    "this data set has been cataloged in a uniform way and has well - understood completeness limits , we are able to investigate how the sub - population of low luminosity star - forming galaxies contributes to the overall hi mass function ( himf ) .",
    "the himf describes the number density of objects with differing neutral hydrogen gas masses as a function of that mass . integrating over the himf yields the hi density in the local universe ( @xmath134 ) , which is an important observational constraint on models of galaxy evolution and cosmology .",
    "the fraction of the himf due to low luminosity star - forming galaxies is particularly interesting in light of some reports of a trend of increasing m@xmath67/l@xmath22 with decreasing l@xmath22 ( see section 4.3 ) coupled with indications of a possible upturn at the low - mass end of the himf ( schneider et al .",
    "1998 , rosenberg & schneider 2002 ) .",
    "the standard @xmath135 ( 1/@xmath136 ) method ( schmidt 1968 ) is used to determine the himf for the kiss hi sample . within each hi mass bin , this technique sums the reciprocals of the volumes corresponding to the maximum distances at which galaxies can be placed and still remain in the sample . since we are interested in the himf for a specialized subset of the general population , the calculation of v@xmath137 will be dependent upon the selection function of the survey method which originally produced the subset . in this case ,",
    "emission - line strength is the primary characteristic that determines whether an object is included in kiss , while a velocity limit of 11,000 km s @xmath2 determines whether a kiss elg is included in the hi sample .",
    "therefore , @xmath136 is taken to be the smaller of : ( 1 ) the object s limiting volume in kiss , based on @xmath138 , the sum of the h@xmath3 flux and the flux in the continuum under the line , or ( 2 ) the volume corresponding to 11,000 km s @xmath2 cut - off .",
    "completeness of the sample has been assessed through an @xmath139 ( schmidt 1968 ; huchra & sargent 1973 ) analysis of @xmath138 , which uses the fact that a uniformly distributed sample of objects will have @xmath140=0.5 for all flux levels at which the sample is complete .",
    "this analysis for the kiss galaxies , as well as the computation of limiting volumes in kiss , is fully described in gronwall et al .",
    "we briefly summarize the results here .    in gronwall et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , kiss is shown to be 100% complete to @xmath141 ( for convenience , @xmath138 is placed on a magnitude scale using the relation @xmath142 log @xmath143 , where the zero point of the magnitude scale is arbitrary ) .",
    "@xmath139 is stable to better than 10% between @xmath144 , where it varies between 0.6 and 0.55 , and it remains close to a value of 0.50 to @xmath145 , where the completeness of the sample is 70% . at magnitudes fainter than 15.1 , @xmath139 and the completeness decrease rapidly .",
    "galaxies with @xmath146 ( n=12 ) have been excluded from the computation of the himf .",
    "corrections for incompleteness have been applied for galaxies with @xmath147 . to summarize : @xmath148 where @xmath60 is the completeness fraction given in gronwall et al .",
    "2002 , and volumes have been computed based on a survey area of 62.16 square degrees and @xmath149 .    as a conservative measure ,",
    "three galaxies with @xmath150 km s@xmath2(kissr 73 , 314 , 1048 ) have also been excluded from the sample .",
    "this is because radial velocity is not a reliable indicator of distance for such nearby objects since peculiar velocities can be comparable to recessional velocities in the local neighborhood",
    ". these errors in distance can translate into errors in the derived hi mass which are larger than our chosen bin size of @xmath151 ( discussed further below ) .",
    "figure 13 presents our computed himfs for the low luminosity kiss hi sample .",
    "the filled squares represent the himf calculated from the @xmath135 ( 1/@xmath136 ) method for this sample , where all upper limit hi masses have been included by using the value of the upper limit to determine bin placement .",
    "the error bars show 1-@xmath18 poissonian confidence limits .",
    "the bins are chosen in a way that maximizes the number of galaxies within them while still producing a minimum of five evenly spaced himf points .",
    "of course , each of the upper - limits may actually belong to any of the bins below the one in which it was placed . as a result",
    ", the true low - mass end slope may be steeper than implied by the filled squares .",
    "thus , we have also investigated the extreme case where all the upper - limit data points represent galaxies with hi masses which place them in the lowest mass bin present in the kiss sample .",
    "this second himf is represented by the open stars .",
    "two other himfs computed from hi blind surveys are also plotted for comparison .",
    "open circles show results from zwaan et al .",
    "( 1997 ) while open squares show results from rosenberg & schneider ( 2002 ) .",
    "the two lower panels show the distribution of hi masses used in the computation of the kiss himfs .",
    "the top histogram corresponds to the number of galaxies used to compute each of the points given by the filled squares , and the bottom histogram corresponds to the open stars .",
    "the unshaded portions of these histograms represent upper - limit detections , while the shaded areas represent true detections .    the fitted curves in the figure are schechter ( 1976 ) functions : @xmath152 where the free parameters are @xmath3 , the slope of the low - mass end , @xmath153 , the characteristic mass that defines the `` knee '' in the curve , and @xmath154 , the normalization factor . the parameterizations given by the best - fit curves reported in rosenberg & schneider ( 2002 ) and zwaan et al .",
    "( 1997 ) are log@xmath155)=9.88 , @xmath154=0.005 mpc@xmath85 , and @xmath1561.53 and log@xmath155)=9.80 , @xmath154=0.0059 mpc@xmath85 , and @xmath1561.2 , respectively .    minimizing @xmath157 for the filled squares yields",
    "log@xmath155)=8.96 , @xmath154=0.0087 , and @xmath3=-0.60 ( solid curve ) .",
    "this himf has a rapidly decreasing low - mass slope , especially when compared with the values of @xmath3 derived from the two hi blind surveys cited above .",
    "again however , the true slope may be considerably steeper than -0.60 since galaxies with upper - limit detections may actually belong to any one of the lower mass bins .",
    "repeating the fitting procedure for the stars ( where all of the upper - limits have been deposited in the lowest mass bin ) , gives a schechter function with a larger slope , as expected ( log@xmath155)=9.09 , @xmath154=0.0046 mpc@xmath85 , and @xmath1560.94 ; dotted curve ) .",
    "however , this himf is still is not as steep as the himf predicted for the overall population of galaxies . finally , noting that fit to the stars is pulled down by the point at log(m@xmath67/m@xmath9)=8.42",
    ", we have also performed the fit omitting this particular point so that the steepest possible @xmath3 permitted by the data may be found . even in this most extreme case @xmath3",
    "does not rise above @xmath241.06 ( with log@xmath155)=9.05 and @xmath154=0.0063 mpc@xmath85 ; dot - dashed curve ) .",
    "thus , from this discussion it is clear that if the himf of the universe does indeed have a steeply rising low - mass slope , it is not caused by a large population of low luminosity star - forming galaxies .",
    "still , we may consider the potential effect of the 12 galaxies with @xmath146 that have been excluded from the analysis .",
    "these galaxies are kissr 55 , 61 , 85 , 97 , 105 , 120 , 193 , 471 , 856 , 1014 , 1091 , and 1112 .",
    "for this set , the average and median @xmath25 ( -15.81 and -15.97 respectively ) are lower by about a magnitude than the parent sample , which is not surprising .",
    "since the hi mass distribution of the 12 galaxies is similar to that of the complete sub - sample ( @xmath158 of 8.6 versus 8.8 ) , the lower blue luminosities lead to a slightly higher average gas - richness ( @xmath159 compared to -0.13 ) .",
    "these trends are consistent with the weak correlation between @xmath101 and @xmath102 shown in @xmath154.3 . from this cursory analysis",
    ", one would expect that the shape of the himf given above would not appreciably change even if it were computed using data from a deeper emission - line survey .",
    "we note , however , that when the himf is recomputed by including the 10 galaxies with @xmath146 which have hi detections , the low - mass slope does become significantly steeper with @xmath160 .",
    "because of the small volumes associated with many of the faint @xmath161 galaxies and the large incompleteness correction factors that are required , this result is inconclusive .",
    "as always , newer , deeper , statistically complete surveys will test the worked based on its shallower predecessors .    to find the contribution of the kiss hi sample to the total himf",
    ", we first integrate over all masses : @xmath162    using the parameters given by solid curve in figure 13 , we find @xmath163(kiss m@xmath164 mpc@xmath85 , or @xmath165 , with a statistical error of 20% .",
    "results for the parameters given by the dashed and the dot - dashed curves are @xmath166 mpc@xmath85 ( @xmath167 ) and @xmath168 mpc@xmath85 ( @xmath169 ) respectively .",
    "comparison with the total hi gas density computed from the hi blind survey from zwaan et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , shows that the low luminosity star - forming galaxies found in kiss contain about 15% of the overall neutral hydrogen in the universe .",
    "this percentage decreases to 10% if the total hi gas density is instead computed from the rosenberg & schneider himf .",
    "direct comparison of the number densities given by the himfs over a range confined to lower masses yields one measure of the fraction of dwarf galaxies currently undergoing an episode of strong star formation .",
    "first , let us restrict our attention to @xmath12 .",
    "comparison with the number densities from the zwaan et al .",
    "( 1997 ) himf implies that nearly one out of every two dwarf galaxies with hi masses in this range is bursting .",
    "if number densities from the rosenberg & schneider ( 2002 ) himf are instead used , the ratio decreases to about 1 out of 4 .",
    "extrapolation of the schechter functions to lower masses implies that the fraction of bursting dwarfs decreases with decreasing hi mass .",
    "this is consistent with the result that gas richness ( @xmath86 ) does not increase at a significant level with decreasing galaxy luminosity .",
    "there is a large variation in the _ rates _ of decline implied by the different himfs . if the solid kiss himf is taken relative to the rosenberg & schneider ( 2002 ) himf , the fraction of the population which is strongly star forming is already only 1% at @xmath170 .",
    "but if the dot - dashed kiss himf is taken relative to the zwaan et al .",
    "( 1997 ) himf , the fraction is still @xmath171 at @xmath170 . the burst fraction at masses below @xmath68 can only be clarified when statistics at the low - mass end of the overall himf are improved . as noted by rosenberg & schneider ( 2002 ) ,",
    "this will not be resolved within the context of blind hi surveys in the near future because of the practical observational limits of currently available facilities .",
    "however , we will be able to gradually improve statistics for the specialized population of low hi - mass star - forming galaxies .",
    "since star - forming systems with @xmath172 are intrinsically rare and can only be detected if they are nearby , large areas of sky must be observed to find these galaxies .",
    "it is thus reasonable that we did not find any extremely low hi mass objects within the small swath covered by kr1 ( 62.2 deg@xmath173 ) .",
    "the completion of additional kiss fields and deep hi observations of the nearest and faintest emission - line galaxies found in these areas will help to put more stringent constraints on the incidence of star - forming systems at low hi masses .",
    "a complete sample of 109 low luminosity ( @xmath128 ) , nearby ( @xmath174 km s@xmath2 ) , h@xmath3-selected star - forming galaxies from the kiss catalog have been observed at 21-cm .",
    "our detection rate is 89% ( 97/109 ) . by examining the kiss composite @xmath29 and @xmath30-band survey images ,",
    "we have found that 9% ( 10/109 ) have companions of comparable or greater optical brightness within the @xmath175 arecibo beam .",
    "we find that our non - detections and upper - limits for confused sources do not bias the sample in terms of @xmath102 or @xmath176 .",
    "the hi properties of this sample are as follows :    1 .",
    "our sample includes true dwarf galaxies as well as larger but heavily - extincted edge - on spiral galaxies .",
    "this is reflected in our broad distribution of hi line width ( 39 km s@xmath2 to 311 km s@xmath2 , median=132 km s@xmath2 , mean=139 km s@xmath2 , uncorrected for inclination ) .",
    "the range of hi gas richness for this sample ( as defined by @xmath86 ) is the same as in previous hi surveys of late - type galaxies .",
    "we report weak anti - correlations between the gas - richness and metallicity , and the gas - richness and blue luminosity .",
    "this is consistent with previous results for different samples of dwarf galaxies .",
    "3 .   using the models of ferrara & tolstoy ( 2000 ) ,",
    "our galaxies are shown to have a large range of dark - to - visible mass fractions ( 0 @xmath177300 ) .",
    "the median hi gas depletion timescale for this sample increases from @xmath115 gyr to @xmath1113 gyr when a metallicity - dependent sfr is used to calculate timescales instead of a solar - metallicity sfr .",
    "accounting for metallicity is important since the galaxies in this sample have low luminosities , and tend to be metal - poor .",
    "one interpretation of these statistics is that these galaxies will not deplete their gas supplies for another hubble time , if they continue to form stars at their current rate .",
    "these results also lift the requirement that bcds have star formation histories dominated by short bursts of activity , and show that a more nearly continuous mode of star formation is possible .",
    "5 .   by computing an hi mass function for this sample",
    ", it is shown that the low luminosity star - forming galaxies in kiss contain 10 - 15% of the overall neutral hydrogen in the universe .",
    "we find that @xmath178 mpc@xmath85 , or @xmath165 with a @xmath179 statistical error .",
    "the himf of this sub - population does not exhibit a steeply rising slope at low - masses .",
    "this is consistent with the result that gas richness ( @xmath86 ) does not increase at a significant level with decreasing galaxy luminosity . in the range @xmath12 , we find that 25 - 50% of all galaxies are currently undergoing a strong episode of star formation .",

    "<S> new hi observations are presented for a complete sample of 109 low luminosity star - forming galaxies taken from the kpno international spectroscopic survey ( kiss ) , the first ccd - based wide - field objective - prism survey for emission - line galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> this sample consists of all star - forming galaxies with @xmath0 and @xmath1 11,000 km s@xmath2 from the first h@xmath3-selected survey list . </S>",
    "<S> the galaxies in this list lie within a 1.3 deg wide strip centered on @xmath4b@xmath5 that spans the range @xmath6b@xmath7 to @xmath6b@xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> overall , 97 out of 109 galaxies have been detected in hi . </S>",
    "<S> we confirm the weak trend of increasing gas richness with decreasing luminosity found by previous authors . </S>",
    "<S> gas richness is also shown to be weakly anti - correlated with metallicity . </S>",
    "<S> the dependence of star formation rates ( sfrs ) and hi gas depletion timescales on metallicity is examined . </S>",
    "<S> the median solar metallicity based sfr and gas depletion timescale are 0.1639 m@xmath9 yr@xmath2 and 5 gyrs , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> corrections for variations in metallicity decreases sfrs by @xmath10 dex and increases gas depletion timescales by an average of @xmath118 gyrs . </S>",
    "<S> the majority of galaxies in this sample still have large reservoirs of hi gas , and despite their large current star formation rates , could have formed stars in a quasi - continuous manner for a hubble time . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we present the first hi mass function for low luminosity star - forming galaxies and show that this subpopulation contributes 10 - 15% of the overall hi density in the local universe . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that if the hi mass function of the universe does indeed have a steeply rising low - mass slope as suggested by previous authors , it is not due to the population of low luminosity star - forming galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> comparison of the number densities from the himfs in the range @xmath12 implies that 25 - 50% of galaxies in this regime are currently undergoing a strong episode of star formation . </S>"
