    "in relativistic heavy ion collisions , bulk fluctuations of conserved charges observed by event - by - event analyses are among unique hadronic observables which carry information on the thermal property of the medium in the early stage @xcite ; see a recent review ref .",
    "in particular , the non - gaussianity of fluctuations characterized by higher order cumulants has acquired much attention recently @xcite .",
    "active measurements of fluctuations have been performed at relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) and the large hadron collider ( lhc ) @xcite .",
    "measurements will also be carried out in future experiments , such as the beam - energy scan ii ( bes - ii ) program at rhic @xcite and future facilities , fair @xcite , nica @xcite , and j - parc @xcite .",
    "conserved - charge fluctuations can also be investigated in numerical experiments on the lattice @xcite .",
    "the comparison between the real and virtual experiments by means of fluctuations will deepen our knowledge on statistical and dynamical aspects of relativistic heavy ion collisions .    in the comparison of fluctuations measured by event - by - event analyses with those obtained by theoretical analyses ,",
    "however , there is a difficulty associated with the phase space in which the fluctuation are defined @xcite . on the theoretical side including lattice qcd numerical simulations , the cumulants characterizing fluctuations are usually calculated on the basis of statistical mechanics @xcite .",
    "the cumulants calculated in this formalism correspond to those in a finite _ spatial volume _ in equilibrium ; the phase space is defined in _",
    "coordinate space _ after integrating out the momentum @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , in heavy ion collisions experimental detectors can not observe the position of particles in the medium .",
    "instead , they can only measure the momentum of particles in the final state .",
    "therefore , the phase space defining fluctuations inevitably has to be chosen in _ momentum space_.    the fluctuations in a momentum phase space observed experimentally are usually regarded as a proxy of the one in a coordinate space as follows @xcite .",
    "first , assuming the bjorken space - time evolution the ( momentum - space ) rapidity @xmath0 of a _ fluid element _ is equivalent to the coordinate - space rapidity @xmath1 of the fluid element because of boost invariance , where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are time and the longitudinal coordinate , respectively .",
    "second , by assuming that the rapidities of _ individual particles _ in the fluid element is equivalent to the rapidity of the fluid element , rapidities of particles are identical with @xmath4 .",
    "then , by measuring fluctuations in a rapidity window @xmath5 after integrating out the transverse momentum , the phase space is regarded as the one in the coordinate space in a coordinate - space rapidity window @xmath6 , where transverse coordinates , @xmath7 and @xmath0 , are integrated out .    this argument",
    ", however , relies on two nontrivial assumptions ; ( 1 ) validity of the bjorken picture and ( 2 ) that the relative velocities of individual particles against the fluid element are negligible .",
    "though the former may be justified for sufficiently high energy collisions , the latter can be invalidated by thermal motion irrespective of collision energy .",
    "because of the thermal motion , the correspondence between the two rapidities @xmath0 and @xmath4 for individual particles becomes at most an approximate one .",
    "the measurement of fluctuation in @xmath5 thus receives a blurring effect when the results are to be interpreted as fluctuations in @xmath8 . in this study",
    ", we call this effect as thermal blurring , and investigate its effect on fluctuation observables quantitatively .",
    "we note that the existence of the thermal blurring effect has been pointed out in earlier studies @xcite . the same problem is recently investigated in a slightly different context in ref .",
    "the purpose of the present study is to investigate this effect on cumulants quantitatively .",
    "we discuss the centrality dependence of the thermal blurring effect , and extend the argument to non - gaussian fluctuations .",
    "the main results of this paper are presented in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in this study",
    ", we estimate the thermal blurring effect by assuming that individual particles are emitted from the medium at kinetic freezeout .",
    "the thermal motion of individual particles at kinetic freezeout is deduced from a simple blastwave model for particle yields in @xmath9 space .",
    "we show that the thermal blurring effect becomes more prominent as the rapidity window @xmath5 becomes narrower , and at the maximal coverage of the rapidity window of star detector the observed fluctuations are significantly modified owing to this effect .",
    "because we consider the thermal blurring at kinetic freezeout , our argument relates fluctuations observed experimentally to those in @xmath8 at kinetic freezeout .",
    "when one wants to compare the experimental results with thermal fluctuations generated in much earlier stage , one has to take account of the time evolution of fluctuations before kinetic freezeout @xcite .",
    "the time evolution is basically the diffusion process toward the equilibrium . in this paper",
    "we discuss that the thermal blurring can be regarded as a part of the diffusion process .",
    "one thus can use the mathematical results in refs .",
    "@xcite directly to understand the thermal blurring effects .",
    "we argue that the modification of fluctuations due to thermal blurring and diffusion can be experimentally understood by studying the rapidity window @xmath5 dependences of the cumulants as discussed for the case of diffusion in refs .",
    "the centrality dependence of net - electric charge fluctuation observed by alice collaboration @xcite is also discussed on the basis of this picture .    throughout this paper , we assume the bjorken space - time evolution . at lower energy collisions , this picture does not hold and our discussion would be significantly modified .",

    "the particle spectrum emitted from freezeout surface per unit rapidity @xmath0 per unit transverse momentum @xmath34 is given by @xmath35 using @xmath36 and by integrating out the transverse momentum , we obtain the particle distribution per unit rapidity as @xmath37 where we have used the rotational invariance with regard to @xmath3 axis , i.e. the longitudinal axis . the proportionality coefficient of @xmath11 is determined so as to satisfy @xmath38 .",

    "[ fig : alice ] , we plot the @xmath5 dependence of @xmath134 with blastwave parameters for centrality bins @xmath155 , @xmath156 , and @xmath157 for alice experiment @xcite for @xmath151 and @xmath158 . in the figure",
    ", we also show the d - measure observed by alice collaboration with a translation @xmath159 @xcite . here , we emphasize that @xmath149 is the d - measure in the initial condition , while @xmath134 is the experimentally observed one with a rapidity window @xmath5 , which takes a different value from @xmath149 owing to thermal blurring .",
    "the figure shows that the results for @xmath160 agrees with the experimental data within the error for all centrality bins .",
    "more accurate experimental data , however , is required to obtain a more quantitative conclusion .",
    "it , however , is notable that the qualitative centrality dependence observed in ref .",
    "@xcite is already well reproduced by thermal blurring and centrality independent @xmath149 .",
    "up to now , we have estimated the magnitude of thermal blurring assuming that the particles are emitted from the hot medium at kinetic freezeout time . in this argument , the distribution of @xmath59 in @xmath4 space at _ kinetic freezeout _ is related to the experimentally - observed one after thermal blurring . on the other hand , the experimentally - observed fluctuations are usually compared with thermal fluctuations in earlier stage , such as chemical freezeout time or much earlier , in the literature . in this case , the modification of the event - by - event fluctuations in a rapidity window @xmath8 before kinetic freezeout has to be taken into account besides the thermal blurring effect .",
    "we emphasize that the coordinate - space rapidities @xmath4 of individual particles and accordingly @xmath59 in each event are changing before the kinetic freezeout because of the nonzero velocity of individual particles along longitudinal direction @xcite .",
    "if the motion of particles in @xmath4 space before kinetic freezeout is well approximated by diffusion process , a particle at @xmath161 at some early proper time @xmath162 is distributed at kinetic freezeout time @xmath163 in @xmath4 space by a gauss distribution @xmath164 with the diffusion distance @xmath165 .",
    "note that @xmath165 is related to the @xmath166 dependent diffusion coefficients @xmath167 and @xmath168 in cartesian and bjorken coordinates , respectively , as @xcite @xmath169    after the diffusion in @xmath4 space , particles are observed at some rapidity @xmath0 through thermal blurring .",
    "then , the probability that a particle located at @xmath161 at @xmath162 is found at a rapidity @xmath0 in the final state after thermal blurring , @xmath170 , is given by the convolution integral @xmath171    generally , the probability eq .",
    "( [ eq : p_drift ] ) of the diffusion motion for different particles can be correlated because the scattering of particles can give rise to such a correlation .",
    "we also note that the above argument does not take account of the possibility of pair creations and annihilations of particles .",
    "when one considers the baryon number for sufficiently large @xmath172 , however , the correlation should be well suppressed because baryons in the hadronic medium almost exclusively interact with pions @xcite .",
    "the chemical freezeout picture also suggests that the pair creations and annihilations hardly occur after chemical freezeout time . when these conditions are satisfied , the total effect due to the diffusion in @xmath4 space and thermal blurring can be described by simply replacing @xmath173 in eq .",
    "( [ eq:<q^n > ] ) with @xmath174 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : d+b ] ) . as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : num - dy ] , the effect of non - gaussianity of @xmath11 is well suppressed . by approximating @xmath11 by a gauss distribution ,",
    "@xmath175 given by the convolution of two gauss ones also becomes gaussian .",
    "the total effect due to the diffusion and blurring then can be regarded as if it were from a single diffusion process , although the diffusion length , or the width of the gauss distribution , includes both effects . in this picture , the results in figs .",
    "[ fig : dy ] and [ fig : alice ] should be interpreted as the results with minimal diffusion lengths .",
    "we also note that the hadronic decays @xcite give rise to diffusion of charges in rapidity space , and thus would be treated as a part of the diffusion and blurring to a good approximation .",
    "finally , we note that the same conclusion on thermal blurring is also applicable to the interpretation of the balance function and correlation along rapidity direction @xcite measured experimentally .",
    "in this study , we investigated the thermal blurring effect , i.e. the effect arising from the use of rapidity @xmath0 in substitution for the coordinate - space rapidity @xmath4 , on cumulants of conserved charges measured by the event - by - event analysis in relativistic heavy - ion collisions quantitatively .",
    "our analysis suggests that the thermal blurring affects fluctuation observables significantly at the maximal rapidity coverage of star detector , @xmath50 , and not negligible even with @xmath142 the maximal rapidity coverage of alice detector .",
    "when one compares the event - by - event fluctuation observed in these experiments with theoretical results obtained on the basis of statistical mechanics , therefore , the correction arising from the thermal blurring effect should be taken into account seriously .",
    "although we assumed the bjorken space - time evolution throughout this paper , at low energy collision this picture does not hold any more .",
    "for lower energy collisions the effect of global charge conservation will also show up @xcite .",
    "these effects have to be considered seriously in the interpretation of experimentally - observed fluctuations at bes - ii energy region @xcite . throughout this study we also assumed that the transverse momentum is integrated out . in real experiments , however , the particles are observed in a finite transverse momentum acceptance .",
    "the understanding of the effect of the momentum cut @xcite on fluctuations is another important issue . the comparison and estimate of the thermal blurring effects based on the dynamical models @xcite are also interesting subjects for future study .",
