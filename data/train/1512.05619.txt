    "the aim of this paper is to develop a mathematical framework to explain and capture the emergence of joint improvisation between two individuals playing the mirror game , and generate a model - driven virtual player able to interact and coordinate its motion with that of a human subject .",
    "we take the mirror game as a paradigmatic example of joint action . in",
    "so doing we propose a theoretical model of joint improvisation in the mirror game .",
    "we show that such a model is able to account for the onset of movement synchronization in joint - action tasks between two players and to guarantee that a model - driven computer avatar interacts successfully in real - time with a human player generating , for the first time in the literature , new jointly improvised movements .",
    "human social interactions give rise to a variety of self - organized and emergent motor behaviors @xcite .",
    "a typical example is joint improvisation between two humans performing some task together , as engaging in a conversation or performing social dancing  @xcite .",
    "experimental results suggest that interpersonal synchrony in joint actions unconsciously fosters social rapport and promotes a sense of affinity between two individuals  @xcite .    to investigate the mechanisms behind the emergence of social interaction between two individuals ,",
    "the human dynamic clamp ( hdc ) paradigm has been recently proposed in  @xcite where a model - driven avatar ( or virtual player ) replaces one of the two humans . in so doing ,",
    "the features of the motion of the virtual player can be manipulated in order to understand whether and how the interaction with the human subject is affected .    here",
    "we present a new model to explain and analyze the emergence of joint improvisation between two players .",
    "we focus on the mirror game , a paradigm of joint human interaction which was recently proposed in  @xcite .",
    "contrary to previous approaches where models were typically used to generate simple oscillatory motion or to reproduce the motion of a human subject @xcite , we present a model able to capture the complex movements generated by human subjects playing the game and generate new motion .",
    "furthermore , we show that the model can capture and reproduce the essential kinematic features of the movement of a reference human subject as encoded by the individual motor signature recently introduced in  @xcite , opening the possibility of testing _ in - silico _ the interaction between different individuals in a number of different configurations .",
    "we also use our model to design an enhanced model - driven avatar ( or virtual player ) able not only to interact with a human subject but also to generate jointly improvised movement with him / her .",
    "the predictions of the model and its ability to drive a computer avatar in real - time are tested and validated via an exhaustive experimental investigation , accompanied by a mathematical analysis of its convergence .",
    "as a simple yet effective paradigm to study interpersonal coordination between two individuals we use the mirror game  @xcite .",
    "specifically , as shown in fig  [ fig1 ] , two players facing each other are asked to coordinate the motion of two balls mounted on two respective parallel strings .",
    "the players can be asked to play in a leader - follower condition ( lf ) , where one is instructed to follow the motion of the other , or in a joint improvisation condition ( ji ) , where they are instructed to imitate each other , create synchronized and interesting motions and enjoy playing together , without any designation of leader and follower .    * mirror game between two human players at university of montpellier , france . *",
    "two participants face each other and are asked to perform synchronized motion by moving two balls along a string to which they are respectively attached . ]",
    "as suggested in @xcite , the motion of each individual in the mirror game is characterized by different kinematic features that can be accounted for by examining the velocity profile of the player s motion during the game .",
    "the velocity profile comprises a velocity frequency distribution , termed in @xcite as individual motor signature ( ims ) , and can be used to classify and distinguish the movement generated by different human subjects . to acquire the ims of a human subject , we asked him / her to play the mirror game in a solo condition , i.e. in the absence of the other participant . in this condition ,",
    "the human subject was asked to generate interesting complex motion for 60 seconds .",
    "the position time series were recorded during the experiment , and were next used to estimate the velocity pdf of the player s motion .",
    "we use two experimental set - ups to carry out experiments .    * set - up 1 ( shown in fig  [ fig1 ] ) consists of two parallel strings , with a ball that can slide on each .",
    "two human players are asked to move their own ball back and forth along the strings , respectively , while seated .",
    "the position of the balls are detected by cameras disposed around the two participants .",
    "details of the set - up can be found in @xcite . *",
    "set - up 2 ( schematically shown in fig  [ fig2 ] ) employs a cheap leap motion controller to detect the fingertip position of the human player ( hp ) . + * experimental setup of the mirror game between a hp and a vp . *",
    "the position of the human fingertip @xmath0 is detected by a leap motion controller , and the sampled position @xmath1 is sent to the computer , while the position @xmath2 of the vp is generated by implementing the numerical algorithm of the single model .",
    "two circles are shown on the computer screen , which correspond to the end effectors position of the hp ( blue circle ) and the vp ( green circle ) , respectively.,scaledwidth=80.0% ] + both the leap motion controller and a laptop computer ( employed to implement and run the theoretical model driving the computer avatar ) are placed on a table .",
    "the hp is asked to wave his / her own index finger horizontally over the leap motion controller with a horizontal range of around @xmath3 .",
    "the fingertip position of the hp is mapped into the interval @xmath4 $ ] and visualized as a blue solid circle on the computer screen . a green solid circle , whose movement is computed from the model presented in this paper , is also visualized to represent the position of the virtual player ( vp ) .",
    "the advantage of using this simple set - up , consisting of cheap off - the - shelf elements , is its accessibility and ease of implementation .      to assess the level of coordination between the players we use the following metrics .    * _ temporal correspondence . _",
    "the root mean square ( rms ) of the normalized position error between the two players defined as @xmath5 is used to describe their tracking accuracy ( temporal correspondence ) during the game . here",
    "@xmath6 refers to the range of admissible positions ( e.g. the length of the strings in the set - up shown in fig  [ fig1 ] or the range of motion detected by the leap motion controller ) , @xmath7 is the number of sampling steps in the simulation , and @xmath8 and @xmath9 denote the positions of two participants at the @xmath10-th sampling step , respectively . * _ distance between imss . _",
    "the earth mover s distance ( emd ) is used to quantify differences between the velocity pdfs of the two players motion ( e.g. to assess how similar / dissimilar their imss are ) .",
    "it is a proper metric in the space of pdfs  @xcite and is computed as follows : @xmath11 where @xmath12 denotes the integration domain , and @xmath13 denotes the cumulative distribution function of the distribution @xmath14 .",
    "furthermore , we normalize the emds with the maximal @xmath15 given by the length of the integration domain @xmath16 . * _ relative phase distribution . _",
    "the pdf of the relative phase @xmath17 between the players motion ( estimated by means of wavelet coherence  @xcite ) is used to check the directionality of the interaction during the game ( i.e. if one player is leading or following the other ) .      to establish a benchmark dataset to compare with model predictions , we obtained data from 8 different human dyads .",
    "data from each dyad contains 3 solo trials for each human participant and 3 joint trials between them in ji condition .",
    "description of all the available data can be found in section [ sec : availabledata ] .",
    "a representative example of the data collected in mirror game between two hps ( dyad 1 , hps ji trial 3 ) is shown in fig  [ fig3 ] .",

    "in particular , fig  [ fig3]a shows the trajectories of the first solo trial of hp@xmath18 ( light red ) and the third solo trial of hp@xmath19 ( dark red ) , while fig  [ fig3]d shows the trajectories of the two hps interacting in ji condition ( light and dark blue ) . additionally , we show the velocity pdfs estimated from each of the respective position time series : panels b - c from solo and panels e - f from ji between the two hps .    in order to visualize the relations between the distributions , we used multidimensional scaling ( mds ) , a data mining and visualization technique  @xcite that uses distances/ dissimilarities between objects to represent them as points in a geometric space .",
    "an example of such a geometric representation of the relations between the pdfs of the players velocities is shown in fig  [ fig4]a .",
    "different velocity pdfs are denoted with different markers : @xmath20 ( red dots ) indicates the motor signature of the @xmath21-th human player when playing solo ; @xmath22 ( blue dots ) indicates the velocity pdfs of the @xmath21-th human player during runs of the mirror game with the other player .",

    "b : pdf of relative phase @xmath17 between the two hps . ]    in agreement with previous studies @xcite , we found that the velocity pdfs of the two hps ( fig  [ fig4]a , light and dark blue dots ) move away from their respective motor signatures ( fig  [ fig4]a , light and dark red dots ) when they are improvising together because of mutual imitation , adaptation and synchronization that results in their velocity pdfs moving towards each other during the game .",
    "the values of the distances between the velocity pdfs depicted in fig  [ fig4]a were computed to be @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 .    finally , in fig",
    "[ fig4]b , we plot the distribution of the relative phase between the two players .",
    "we found that it is quite broad and centered around 0 , indicating that neither of the two players was clearly leading the interaction during the game .",
    "the players , as instructed , were generating jointly improvised motion for most of the time .",
    "similar results were obtained for all the trials of every dyad ( fig  [ fig5 ] ) .",
    "each panel of fig  [ fig5 ] corresponds to a single dyad . for each dyad , three pdfs of relative phase from the three respective ji trials are shown with different scales of blue .",
    "it is possible to appreciate how all the pdfs are quite broad and centered around 0 .",
    "the only exception is dyad 7 where the maximum of the relative phase pdf is shifted on the right for all the three trials indicating that , despite the instruction given to the two participants , one player consistently ended up leading the game ( fig  [ fig5]g ) .",

    "our first result is a mathematical model of joint improvisation .",
    "our experimental observations of two hps playing the mirror game suggests that their interaction in a ji condition is driven by three key factors : ( i ) their will to synchronize each other s movement ; ( ii ) the tendency of each player to exhibit some individual preferred movement features ( or ims ) ; and ( iii ) the attempt each player makes to imitate the way the other moves ( or mutual imitation ) .",
    "as shown in fig  [ fig6 ] , we proposed to map each of these three factors onto a specific behavioral goal .",
    "in particular , _ synchronization of joint movements _ can be translated into the goal of minimizing the position mismatch between the balls moved by the two participants , which is related to the temporal correspondence ( tc ) between their positions . _",
    "spontaneous motion _ preferences arise from the tendency of each participant to move according to his / her own ims . finally , _ mutual imitation _ can be achieved by the participants minimizing their velocity mismatch ( velocity tc ) during the mirror game .",
    "we captured each of these properties into a new mathematical model of interaction during ji formulated as the following optimal control problem .    * theoretical model of joint improvisation .",
    "* three key factors in the emergence of ji ( from left to right ) : 1 . movement synchronization , corresponding to temporal correspondence ( tc ) between positions of the players end effectors ; 2 . preferred movement , captured by their respective ims ; 3",
    ". mutual imitation , modeled by temporal correspondence between their velocities . ]    specifically , following the approach of  @xcite , we modeled the motion of each of the players using a nonlinear haken - kelso - bunz ( hkb ) oscillator  @xcite of the form @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 denote position and velocity of player @xmath21 , @xmath31 is the coupling function through which player @xmath21 modulates its motion according to that of the other player , while @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 are intrinsic parameters determining the intrinsic properties of the player s motion , such as speed of reaction and settling time .",
    "we represented the coupling function @xmath31 as a nonliner control input that each player computes by minimizing the following cost function over each sampling period @xmath36 the whole trial duration is being split into .",
    "namely , the problem is that of finding the inputs @xmath31 such that @xmath37 where @xmath38 with @xmath39 being tunable control parameters satisfying the constraint @xmath40 . here , @xmath20",
    "encodes the ims of player @xmath21 as his / her velocity time series during solo trials .",
    "the cost function described in eq  ( [ vcost ] ) contains four terms .",
    "the first three terms correspond to each of the three factors characterizing ji shown in fig  [ fig6 ] , while the fourth aims at minimizing the control effort over each sampling period .",
    "the tunable weights in the cost function can be used to change the balance between the four terms described above .",
    "the optimal control framework allows to incorporate into the same cost function all key factors identified to govern the emergence of joint improvisation . in what follows we will refer to each of the players modelled by eq from ( [ vplayer ] ) to ( [ vcost ] ) as a",
