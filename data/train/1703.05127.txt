    "the development of short pulse lasers at relativistic intensities have aroused exciting progress in high energy density physics ( hedp ) .",
    "especially , relativistically intense laser solid interactions are of crucial importance to many great applications , such as fast ignition of fusion energy @xcite , hadron therapy @xcite , proton radiography @xcite , high quality ion beam source @xcite .",
    "when an intense laser beam irradiates a solid target , relativistic electrons can be produced in front of the target through the direct - laser - heating / acceleration mechanism .",
    "these energetic electrons can propagate through the bulk solid and trigger abundant plasma - atomic processes , which typically include resistive return current , resistive electric and magnetic fields @xcite , bulk heating and ionization dynamics @xcite , bremsstrahlung x - ray generation @xcite and also ion accelerations @xcite .    in the last decades ,",
    "there are many worldwide research groups focusing on direct - laser - heating of energetic electrons and their transportation in solid target , both experimentally and theoretically .",
    "these studies can be roughly categorised into two subjects , determined by whether it is the intense laser fields or the solid - density effects that play the dominant roles .",
    "when an intense laser beam irradiates a bulk solid , it is reflected back by the encountered high density plasmas .",
    "the two conflicting laser pulses can efficiently accelerate electrons therein in front of the target @xcite .",
    "this direct - laser - heating / acceleration of energetic electrons is a pure plasma physics process , which can be well investigated by the widely used particle - in - cell ( pic ) codes .",
    "typically , temperature of these energetic electrons can be described by @xmath4 heating mechanism , which had already been well formulated by beg s scaling law @xcite or wilks scaling law @xcite . however , when there exists large - scale preformed plasma in front of the solid target , the electron heating is beyond predictions of beg s scaling law or wilks scaling law .",
    "one has to take into account the synergetic effects of both self - generated charge separation electric fields and laser fields , in order to understand the generation of energetic electrons @xcite . in a recent work @xcite ,",
    "a two - stage electron acceleration model was proposed for relativistically intense laser - solid interactions in the presence of large scale pre - plasmas .",
    "the dependence of the electron heating efficiency on both the pre - plasma scale - length and the laser intensity was figured out .",
    "a scaling law of energetic electrons with @xmath5 was obtained , where @xmath6 is laser intensity and @xmath7 is pre - plasma scale - length .    in front of the target , it is the intense laser fields that dominate the interactions .",
    "however except the electromagnetic dynamics , some atomic processes might also play important roles , like field ionization ( multi - photon ionization , tunnelling ionization and barrier - suppression ionization ) @xcite and quantum - electrodynamics ( qed ) @xcite . in our recent works",
    "@xcite , both field ionization and qed models had been established and implemented into the pic code . however the greatest challenge of pic simulations is the fact that one has to include the regions where solid - density effects also dominate .",
    "the transportation of energetic electrons through the bulk solid could trigger a lot of coupled physical ( plasma and atomic ) processes . to trace these dynamics ,",
    "several hybrid simulation frameworks were established @xcite . in hybrid simulations ,",
    "the energetic electrons are treated kinetically using the vlasov fokker - planck approach and the bulk solid is regarded as a resistive fluid .",
    "the most recent work @xcite also invoked the saha boltzmann model @xcite ( or thomas fermi model @xcite ) to synchronously update the ionization of the bulk solid .",
    "note for the existing hybrid simulations , the laser - plasma - interactions have not been considered directly . instead , the energetic electrons are injected with a temperature obeying certain scaling laws .",
    "most of all , the correctness of the hydrodynamic and hybrid methods is based on a very strong assumption , i.e. , equilibrium - state assumption .",
    "although the hydrodynamic and hybrid methods have acting as workhorses for several decades in the inertial confinement fusion ( icf ) research , the time scale of laser - solid interactions at relativistic intensities is much much shorter than that of the icf studies .",
    "the time scale of icf is on the order of nano - second .",
    "the typical time scale of laser - solid interactions at relativistic intensities is on the order of peco - second or even feto - second , therefore the equilibrium - state assumption is no longer correct any more .    in order to figure out the above dynamics which share significant non - equilibrium features ,",
    "a very first principle approach should be constructed from the very beginning . here",
    ", in this paper , we have presented a full pic framework , which enables us to calculate intense laser - solid interactions in a `` first principle '' way , covering almost `` all '' the coupled physical mechanisms .",
    "furthermore , the numerical self - heating of pic simulations which usually appears in solid - density plasmas is also well controlled by the proposed `` layered - density '' method .",
    "this method can be easily implemented into the state - of - the - art pic codes .    as an application , the electron heating / acceleration at relativistically intense laser - solid interactions influenced by large scale",
    "pre - formed plasmas is re - investigated by this pic code .",
    "results indicate that collisional damping ( even though it is very week ) can significantly influence the electron heating / acceleration in front of the target .",
    "furthermore the bremsstrahlung radiation will be enhanced by @xmath0 times when the solid is dramatically heated and ionized .",
    "for the considered laser of intensity @xmath1 and solid aluminium ( al ) target with pre - plasmas scale - length of @xmath2 , collision damping coupled with ionization dynamics and bremsstrahlung radiations is shown to lower the `` cut - off '' electron energy by @xmath3 .",
    "in addition , the resistive electromagnetic fields due to ohmic - heating also play a non - ignorable role and must be included in realistic laser solid interactions .",
    "although the pic method is a first principle scheme derived from the vlasov and the coupled maxwell s equations , it is a tool originally designed to describe plasmas at high temperature and low densities .",
    "typical plasmas of high temperature and low density are fully dominated by the electromagnetic effects .",
    "however for solid density plasmas ( matter ) , advanced atomic models need to be taken into account .",
    "these models should allow to calculate ionizations in a much more natural manner than equilibrium models .",
    "these models should also allow to directly describe the close interactions in the plasmas and thus , accounts for the multi - particle nature of real plasmas .",
    "in addition , pic method is a kind of numerical schemes , which usually suffer significant self - heating . in general , it is challenging for a pic code to simulate extremely dense and low temperature ( less than 1 kev ) plasmas .",
    "this is because the grid size of pic is restricted by the plasma debye length , @xmath8 , in order to avoid the numerical self - heating @xcite . due to the great demand of huge number of grids and/or particles in the pic simulations of solid - density - plasmas , it is not realistic to perform even with the current fastest super - computers",
    ". therefore , in the research fields of relativistically intense laser - solid interactions , to distinguish the pic approach , one has to solve the facing challenges , both physically and numerically .",

    "<S> direct studies of intense laser - solid interactions is still of great challenges , because of the many coupled physical mechanisms , such as direct laser heating , ionization dynamics , collision among charged particles , and electrostatic or electromagnetic instabilities , to name just a few . here </S>",
    "<S> , we present a full particle - in - cell simulation ( pic ) framework , which enables us to calculate laser - solid interactions in a `` first principle '' way , covering almost `` all '' the coupled physical mechanisms . apart from the mechanisms above , the numerical self - heating of pic simulations , which usually appears in solid - density plasmas , is also well controlled by the proposed `` layered - density '' method . </S>",
    "<S> this method can be easily implemented into the state - of - the - art pic codes . </S>",
    "<S> especially , the electron heating / acceleration at relativistically intense laser - solid interactions in the presence of large scale pre - formed plasmas is re - investigated by this pic code . </S>",
    "<S> results indicate that collisional damping ( even though it is very week ) can significantly influence the electron heating / acceleration in front of the target . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore the bremsstrahlung radiation will be enhanced by @xmath0 times when the solid is dramatically heated and ionized . </S>",
    "<S> for the considered case , where laser is of intensity @xmath1 and pre - plasma in front of the solid target is of scale - length @xmath2 , collision damping coupled with ionization dynamics and bremsstrahlung radiations is shown to lower the `` cut - off '' electron energy by @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the resistive electromagnetic fields due to ohmic - heating also play a non - ignorable role and must be included in realistic laser - solid interactions . </S>"
