    "we concluded the radio ( r - agn / cr ) samples are not drawn from the same population as their radio - faint control samples at @xmath196 confidence : the presence of an agn increases the scale size of a galaxy in red light relative to blue light , on average .",

    "we found an excess of blue cores in radio - loud galaxies as compared to radio - quiet , ` early - type ' galaxies , implying the increased @xmath10 may be due to star formation in the central few kpc , in contrast with feedback models which predict the suppression of star formation near an agn .",
    "spectroscopic selection of our samples rules out major merger events , as starbursts can be triggered by the accretion of gas / tidal interactions .",
    "we also found radio agn hosts to have larger red scale lengths in relation to their blue light and note this to be a contributing factor in an increased @xmath10 .",
    "we can not definitively discern whether a small blue core or larger distribution of red light is the driving factor in this result .",

    "<S> we construct a sample of 3,516 radio - loud host galaxies of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) from the optical sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) and faint images of the radio sky at twenty cm ( first ) . </S>",
    "<S> these have 1.4ghz luminosities in the range @xmath0whz@xmath1 , span redshifts @xmath2 , are brighter than @xmath3mag and are constrained to ` early - type ' morphology in colour space ( @xmath4mag ) . optical emission line ratios ( at @xmath5 ) are used to remove type 1 agn and star - forming galaxies from the radio sample using bpt diagnostics . for comparison </S>",
    "<S> , we select a sample of 35,160 radio - quiet galaxies with the same @xmath6-band magnitude - redshift distribution as the radio sample . </S>",
    "<S> we also create comparison radio and control samples derived by adding the nrao vla sky survey ( nvss ) to quantify the effect of completeness on our results .    </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the effective radii of the surface brightness profiles in the sdss @xmath7 and @xmath8 bands in order to quantify any excess of blue colour in the inner region of radio galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> we define a ratio @xmath9 and use maximum likelihood analysis to compare the average value of @xmath10 and its intrinsic dispersion between both samples . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath10 is larger for the radio - loud agn sample as compared to its control counterpart , and we conclude that the two samples are not drawn from the same population at @xmath11 significance . </S>",
    "<S> given that star formation proceeds over a longer time than radio activity , the difference suggests that a subset of galaxies has the predisposition to become radio loud . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss host galaxy features that cause the presence of a radio - loud agn to increase the scale size of a galaxy in red relative to blue light , including excess central blue emission , point - like blue emission from the agn itself , and/or diffuse red emission . </S>",
