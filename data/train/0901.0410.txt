    "a leading model for the central engine of grbs is the formation of a black hole ( bh ) and an accretion disk , following the gravitational collapse of a massive star whose main sequence mass ( @xmath15 ) is at least as large as @xmath16 ( for reviews , see woosley & bloom 2006 ; nomoto et al . 2007 ) . a relativistic flow generated by neutrino annihilation ( woosley 1993 ;",

    "a link between ( a class of ) grbs and type ic supernovae ( sne ic ) has been established observationally .",
    "the most convincing cases for the supernovae associated with grbs ( hereafter grb - sne ) have been provided by spectroscopic detection of supernova features in an optical afterglow of a grb or at the position consistent with a grb .",

    "optical observations of these grb - sne are well explained by an explosion of a carbon - oxygen ( co ) star , which has evolved from a massive star ( @xmath17 ) and has lost its h- and he - envelopes during the hydrostatic evolutionary phase ( iwamoto et al .",

    "2003 ; maeda 2004 , nagataki , mizuta , & sato 2006 ; tominaga 2007a ; tominaga et al . 2007b ; and tominaga 2009 ) , it has not been clarified what fundamentally determines the properties of resulting sne and in what ways .",
    "also , the numerical investigations have been restricted in the parameter space .",
    "aiming to overcome these problems , this study is complementary to the past numerical studies .",
    "our goal in this paper is to express theoretically expected features of sne resulting from the wind / jet - driven explosion , as a function of rates of the mass and energy ( @xmath26 and @xmath27 , where the subscript `` w '' denotes `` wind '' , or @xmath1 and @xmath0 , referring to the isotropic equivalent values ) generated and injected from the central system ( i.e. , a black hole plus a disk ) into the surrounding stellar mantle ( in this paper , stellar `` mantle '' refers to the stellar materials above the central remnant , i.e. , the outermost layer of the fe core , and the si- and co - layers ) .",
    "our strategy is the following .",
    "( 1 ) we first clarify what are main ingredients of the wind / jet - driven sn explosion (  2 ) . we develop a simplified description for the shock propagation and nucleosynthesis in the explosion (  3 ) . we especially focus on the production of @xmath10ni , addressing how two proposed sites for the @xmath10ni production , a shocked stellar mantle and a disk wind ( macfadyen & woosley 1999 ; see maeda & nomoto 2003 for a review ) , can be distinguished .",
    "( 2 ) we then compare the results with observations of sne associated with a grb , in order to constrain @xmath1 and @xmath0 in these sne (  4 ) . the required values for @xmath1 and @xmath28 then should be regarded as conditions that any models for the central engine should satisfy . in other word , by constraining @xmath1 and @xmath0 , we aim to provide useful constraints in studying the properties of the central engine of grbs .",
    "we consider a situation that a supernova explosion is driven by outflow of materials ( e.g. , a disk wind ; macfadyen & woosley 1999 ) from the vicinity of a central remnant ( likely a black hole ) .",
    "this energy input can be different from the relativistic jet producing a grb ; the wind can either be relativistic or non - relativistic at its injection from the central remnant into the surrounding stellar mantle .    a schematic picture of the problem considered in this paper ( and most of the past numerical studies ) is shown in figure 1 .",
    "throughout this paper , we adopt @xmath29 and @xmath30 progenitor models from nomoto & hashimoto ( 1988 ) . following the treatment of the past numerical studies ,",
    "the wind / jet ( we hereafter frequently call it simply a wind ) is injected by hand at a certain radius ( @xmath31 in this paper ) .      in a one - dimensional hydrodynamic problem ,",
    "three independent variables must be specified ( two for thermodynamic variables and one for a hydrodynamic variable ) as initial / boundary conditions . for simplicity , we assume that the wind is dominated by the kinetic energy",
    ". this does not drastically defeat our results , since it is expected that the thermal energy deposited at the root of the wind , near the central remnant , is quickly converted to the kinetic energy well below @xmath31 .",
    "thanks to this simplification , only two independent variables at @xmath31 are required to determine the hydrodynamic evolution of the system .",
    "the choice of the independent variables can be arbitrary , thus we take the energy injection rate ( @xmath27 ) and the mass injection rate ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "the lorentz factor of the wind / jet at the injection ( at @xmath31 ) is expressed as a function of these two independent variables , i.e. , @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the speed of light .",
    "hereafter , quantities expressing the properties of the wind at injection ( at @xmath31 ) are denoted by the subscript `` w '' .",
    "trivially , the wind is initially highly relativistic only if @xmath34 , where @xmath35 erg s@xmath36 and @xmath37 s@xmath36 .",
    "our analysis is based on a one - dimensional radial flow ; the collimation of the wind is taken into account with a geometrical factor @xmath38 .",
    "@xmath39 relates the wind intrinsic properties and isotropic equivalents as @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the intrinsic total energy ( i.e. , the injected energy integrated over time ) , and the subscript `` iso '' refers to isotropic equivalent values .",
    "@xmath39 is a measure of the collimation angle of the wind at @xmath31 : when the wind is a spherically symmetric flow , @xmath42 .",
    "the wind is more narrowly collimated at the injection for smaller @xmath39 .    for the temporal history of the wind properties , we focus on the situation that the wind is injected at @xmath31 , with @xmath27 and @xmath26 constant in time for @xmath43 , and then terminated at @xmath44 , so that @xmath45 some of the following results , however , do not rely on this assumption .",
    "the first function we have to consider is the dynamical effect (  3.1 ) of the wind to the collapsing stellar mantle ; the overlying stellar mantle continues to collapse onto the central remnant , and the wind does not always have a sufficiently large momentum to overcome the ram pressure of the infalling materials ( fig .",
    "the importance of the dynamical effect to determine the outcome of a wind / jet - driven supernova explosion was pointed out by maeda ( 2004 ) and numerically examined by maeda ( 2004 ) and tominaga et al .",
    "( 2007b ) .",
    "some numerical calculations have included the dynamical effect self - consistently ( e.g. , maeda & nomoto 2003 ; maeda 2004 ; tominaga et al .",
    "2007b ; tominaga 2009 ) , while others have not ( e.g. , maeda et al .",

    "2003 ) .",
    "once the shock wave is launched , it propagates outward into the stellar mantle ( fig .",
    "the kinetic energy is now converted to the thermal energy following the shock wave propagation .",
    "the temperature behind the shock wave is initially so high that the nuclear burning converts the initial stellar composition ( mostly oxygen and silicon ) mainly to @xmath10ni (  3.2.1 )",
    ". the temperature decreases as the shock wave moves outward ; once the temperatures drops below @xmath46 k , then the efficiency of the production of @xmath10ni decreases rapidly .    at the same time , the temperature of the injected wind itself may also be sufficiently high so that a fraction of this material may be converted to @xmath10ni (  3.2.2 ) . in most of the past numerical studies , the production of @xmath10ni in shocked stellar mantle has been investigated in detail .",
    "the ejection of @xmath10ni in the wind has been examined by a different kind of numerical simulations involving the innermost part of the collapsing star ( e.g. , macfadyen & woosley 1999 ; nagataki et al .",
    "however , in such simulations , it is practically difficult to follow the dynamics of the shock wave propagating into the stellar mantle ; thus , it has not been yet clear how the amount of @xmath10ni synthesized in the wind is connected to properties of the progenitor star and of the resulting supernova .",
    "finally , the properties of the wind affect the shape of the supernova ejecta , as the shock wave propagates through the stellar mantle .",
    "this has been directly examined in the past numerical studies , but restricted in the parameter space . in this paper",
    ", we derive a simple estimate of the shape , in terms of the properties of the wind (  3.3 ) .",
    "in this section , we examine dynamical effect of the wind on the collapsing stellar mantle ( fig .",
    "we follow analysis similar to that given by fryer & mszros ( 2003 ) for a standard neutrino - driven delayed explosion for ( canonical ) supernovae .    we evaluate outcome of the interaction between the wind and the infalling materials at radius @xmath47 cm ( for @xmath48 ) and @xmath49 cm ( @xmath50 ) , where the presupernova enclosed mass ( @xmath51 ) is @xmath52 .",

    "if the trajectory of the infalling materials is that of free fall , the density ( @xmath54 ) and velocity ( @xmath55 ) of the infalling materials at @xmath31 are written as @xmath56 the subscript `` presn '' is used for the pre - collapse initial values for the material at the mass coordinate @xmath51 .",

    "however , such an explosion with a long - lived energy injection results in the extremely bipolar explosion , since the outward shock wave can reach the stellar surface before the energy injection is terminated : this argues against the wind - origin of @xmath10ni in sn 1998bw .",

    "the region is relatively large in terms of @xmath0 and @xmath1 , and the features of supernovae are insensitive to @xmath0 and @xmath1 ; this can explain why these three grb - sne are similar in the optical properties .    *",

    "here , @xmath10ni is mainly produced within the wind materials .",
    "the bipolar explosion results from the central energy source being active for a long time period ( c.f .",

    ", ( 1 ) the mass of @xmath10ni produced within the shocked stellar mantle is small , and ( 2 ) the wind should be massive to initiate the explosion ( to provide the sufficiently large momentum in the non - relativistic regime ) . as a result",

    "a supernova can never be triggered .",
    "* ( d ) bipolar sn with the ejected mass @xmath181  grbs 060505 and 060614 ? : * in the parameter region d , only a small amount of materials ( @xmath182 ) near the surface of the co layer are ejected .",
    "the supernova ejecta are essentially bipolar in this case .",

    "the expected luminosity is thus diverse , depending on @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",

    "in this paper , we discussed theoretically expected characteristics of a supernova driven by the wind / jet .",
    "we found that the resulting supernova features can be categorized as a function of @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "thus , it is possible to constrain the nature of the central engine of grbs by observations of associated supernovae .",
    "results of the past numerical studies can be understood as a limiting case .",
    "for example , nakamura et al .",
    "( 2001b ) showed that @xmath24(@xmath10ni ) is larger for larger @xmath28 . in this paper , we have clarified that it holds true only for the limiting case where @xmath137 and thus @xmath138 .",
    "for an another example , tominaga et al .",
    "( 2007b ) showed that @xmath0 determines @xmath24(@xmath10ni ) . in this paper , we have shown that this behavior appears as a limiting case where @xmath115 , and the dependence is different when @xmath127 .    for sn 1998bw , we find that observations are reproduced only if @xmath92 and @xmath169 ( if @xmath7 ) , or @xmath125 ( if @xmath9 ) ( region a in fig .",
    "we favor the shocked stellar mantle as the main site of the production of @xmath10ni .",
    "furthermore , the observed diversity of supernovae associated ( or not associated ) with grbs can be accounted for by the diverse properties of the wind from the central remnant ( @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) .",
    "it is shown that the different wind properties can potentially explain the diversity of supernovae associated with grbs .",
    "further diversity can arise from different progenitors ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "irrespective of @xmath15 , the expected features of the wind - driven supernovae can be categorized as we did for @xmath57 (  4 ) , i.e. , regions a ",
    "e. the positions of the boundaries between different regions , as well as maximum @xmath24(@xmath10ni ) at the high end of @xmath0 and @xmath1 , are dependent on @xmath15 . for @xmath50 ,",
    "the boundary between regions a and d is located at @xmath186 ( for @xmath7 ) or @xmath187 ( for @xmath9 ) , smaller than for @xmath48 by about one order of magnitude ( fig .",
    "3 ) . using @xmath166 and @xmath62 , maximum @xmath24(@xmath10ni ) is @xmath188 even if @xmath189 .",
    "thus , @xmath50 never yield bright sn 1998bw - like sne .",
    "we therefore confirmed that the prototypical grb - sn 1998bw and the similar sne 2003dh and 2003lw must have originated from a massive progenitor ( @xmath190 ) from the nucleosynthesis argument .",
    "also , the diversity arising from @xmath15 may be important to explain the sub - luminous supernovae possibly associated with grbs 040924 and 041006 .",
    "these can be explained by @xmath190 with smaller @xmath0 and @xmath1 than for sn 1998bw .",
    "alternatively , it is also possible that the central engine provides @xmath0 and @xmath1 similar to sn 1998bw , but the progenitor mass is smaller than sn 1998bw ( i.e. , region a for @xmath191 ) .",
    "it is thus important to derive @xmath15 for these sub - luminous cases , by spectroscopic and light curve modeling , to distinguish these possibilities .    on the other hand ,",
    "the diversity in terms of @xmath15 is not important in interpreting no detection of supernovae associated with grbs 060505 and 060614 .",
    "if they are the outcome of the core collapse of a massive star , the properties of the wind / jet should fall in the low end of @xmath27 and @xmath26 ( region e ) , or region d with @xmath192 .",
    "if this is not the case , we should have detected associated supernovae . note that tominaga et al .",
    "( 2007b ) showed that the wind / jet - driven explosion with small @xmath0 `` can '' account for the non - detection of supernovae in these grbs , while this study has shown that @xmath0 and/or @xmath1 `` must '' be small in the central engine of these grbs .",
    "these grbs highlight our suggestion that we can constrain the properties of the central engine by observations ( non - detection , in this case ) of associated supernovae .",
    "the present analysis is based on one - dimensional calculations .",
    "we predict that the different categories ( a  e ) are divided rather sharply in terms of @xmath1 and @xmath0 , while in reality this may well be smoothed by the jet - accretion interaction ( maeda & nomoto 2003 ; tominaga et al . 2007 ) .",
    "although the jet - accretion interaction should create a non - radial flow , key conclusions in the present paper are not defeated .",
    "for example , our model can explain the qualitative behaviors found in the past numerical study , and can reach at least rough quantitative agreement for the important quantity like @xmath24(@xmath10ni ) ( for limited parameter space as investigated by numerical study ; see also maeda & nomoto 2003 ) .",
    "the largest uncertainty involved in the present analysis is in the treatment of nucleosynthesis within the wind material , specifically , the assumption that 20% of the wind materials become @xmath10ni .",
    "surman , mclaughlin , & hix ( 2006 ) concluded that the @xmath10ni mass fraction could be as large as @xmath193% for the wind / jet with the entropy in the range between 10 and 30 .",
    "this does not affect our conclusion for @xmath194 , as the mass of the wind materials is anyway small in this case .",
    "the only conclusion possibly affected by this uncertainty is the supernova feature in the region b. from equation 16 , we see that the entropy of the wind materials falls into the range @xmath195 if @xmath196 .",
    "this line crosses the vicinity of region b , and lead to the contribution of the wind materials for the @xmath10ni production comparable to that of the shocked mantle in this region . as such , @xmath24(@xmath10ni ) is this region may have a significant contribution from the wind materials .",
