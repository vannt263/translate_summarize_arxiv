    "since the complement in @xmath8 of the open ball of radius @xmath21 centered at @xmath31 is path - connected , being homeomorphic to the product @xmath51 , a curve can be drawn from @xmath33 to @xmath34 such that the distance from @xmath31 to every point along the curve is at least @xmath21 . however , by the intermediate value theorem , for some point @xmath15 on the curve , @xmath52 .",
    "the fiber containing @xmath31 therefore has diameter at least @xmath21 , and so can not be small .",
    "we now show that the small fiber lemma places restrictions on the union of small fibers for real - valued functions .",
    "let @xmath0 be a continuous map where @xmath1 .",
    "when @xmath3 , the union of small fibers is bounded ; when @xmath4 the union of small fibers can be unbounded .",
    "[ second theorem ]    we begin with the case where @xmath3 .",
    "recall that a fiber is small if its diameter is less than @xmath21 .",
    "if the union of all small fibers is contained in an open ball of radius @xmath21 , then of course the union of small fibers is bounded .",
    "if the union of all small fibers is not contained in an open ball of radius @xmath21 , then there must exist points @xmath53 such that both belong to small fibers and such that @xmath54 .",
    "it then follows from the small fiber lemma that for any point @xmath15 belonging to any small fiber , either @xmath55 or else @xmath56 .",
    "the set of all such points is of course bounded .",
    "when @xmath4 , a simple example shows that the union of small fibers of @xmath2 can be unbounded .",
    "consider the continuous map @xmath0 given by : @xmath57 note that fibers of @xmath2 are ( @xmath58)-spheres with centers along the @xmath59 axis .",
    "the union of all small fibers is the set of points whose distance to the @xmath59 axis is less than @xmath60 .",
    "although the union of small fibers is bounded when @xmath3 , two small fibers can be located arbitrarily far apart .",
    "consider for example the urysohn - like function @xmath17 , for @xmath18 , given by @xmath61 for distinct points @xmath33 and @xmath31 ; an example in the case @xmath62 is illustrated in figure [ threesets ] . with one exception ,",
    "all fibers of @xmath2 are ( @xmath63)-spheres whose centers lie on the line that passes through @xmath33 and @xmath31 , but not on the segment @xmath64 .",
    "an additional fiber is the perpendicular bisector of @xmath64 , a hyperplane that becomes a sphere when the point at infinity is adjoined .",
    "the spherical fibers are smallest when their centers are closest to @xmath64 , and grow as their centers move away from it .",
    "the distance between the sets of small fibers can be made arbitrarily large by moving @xmath33 and @xmath31 arbitrarily far apart .     given by ( [ urysohn - equation ] ) .",
    "all small fibers are contained in two regions centered near @xmath33 and @xmath31 ; these regions can be located arbitrarily far apart . ]",
    "aside from illustrating that small fibers can be located arbitrarily far apart , figure [ threesets ] also highlights a general property of continuous real - valued functions with small fibers . in particular",
    ", we can use an approach similar to that used in proving the small fiber lemma to show the following .",
    "let @xmath17 be a continuous function where @xmath18 .",
    "if @xmath2 has a small fiber , then @xmath2 is bounded from above or from below .",
    "further , if @xmath65 both belong to small fibers and @xmath54 , then @xmath2 is bounded from above and below .",
    "[ third theorem ]    if @xmath2 has a small fiber @xmath66 , then this fiber is contained in some closed ball @xmath67 of radius @xmath21 ; since @xmath67 is closed , @xmath2 is bounded on it . if @xmath2 is unbounded from above and from below , then there exist points @xmath68 such that @xmath69 . as in the proof of the small fiber lemma ,",
    "since the complement of @xmath67 in @xmath8 is path - connected , a curve can be drawn in it from @xmath33 to @xmath31 . by the intermediate value theorem",
    "there exists a point @xmath15 on that curve such that @xmath70 , and so the fiber over @xmath16 is not small , contradicting our assumption .",
    "the second part of the theorem can be proven in a similar manner .",
    "if @xmath65 both belong to small fibers and @xmath54 , then @xmath25 and @xmath26 must be distinct ; without loss of generality , suppose @xmath71 .",
    "consider the closed ball @xmath67 of radius @xmath21 centered at @xmath31 .",
    "since @xmath67 is closed , @xmath2 is bounded on it . if @xmath2 is unbounded from above",
    ", then there exists a point @xmath72 such that @xmath28 . as above",
    ", a curve can be drawn from @xmath33 to @xmath34 such that the distance from @xmath31 to every point along the curve is at least @xmath21 . by the intermediate value theorem",
    ", there exists a point @xmath15 along that curve such that @xmath73 . since @xmath74 , @xmath31 can not belong to a small fiber , contradicting our assumption and showing that @xmath2 must be bounded from above .",
    "an analogous argument shows that @xmath2 is bounded from below .",
    "note that discontinuous functions , even those that are bounded , integrable , and decay to zero , need not have fibers of arbitrarily large diameter .",
    "consider , for example , the following function @xmath75 : @xmath76 here @xmath2 takes a unique rational value on each unit square in the plane , and so every nonempty fiber of @xmath2 has diameter @xmath77 .",
    "note that @xmath2 tends to 0 as @xmath78 tends to @xmath79 .",
    "moreover , @xmath2 is in @xmath80 and @xmath81 , and hence in @xmath82 for all @xmath83 .",
    "this example can be generalized for arbitrary @xmath1 , with a suitable choice of prime numbers .",
    "the analysis above provides a cautionary tale for data science analysts .",
    "the use of continuous maps to reduce the dimension of point sets in high - dimensional euclidean spaces entails what we might call the `` curse of continuity ''  there will exist points arbitrarily far apart that are identified under such maps .",
    "not only will knowledge of @xmath84 not allow us to recover @xmath15 exactly , but we will generally be unable to determine @xmath15 to within any finite error . under suitable restriction of the domain this issue",
    "might be avoided , but knowledge of such restrictions is not always available a priori .",
    "in contrast , discontinuous mappings suffer no such inherent limitations .",
    "equation ( [ lp ] ) , for example , can be scaled such that its fibers are @xmath36-dimensional cubes of edge length @xmath85 .",
    "the diameter of each fiber is then precisely @xmath86 .",
    "knowledge of @xmath84 then allows us to determine @xmath15 to within a maximal error @xmath86 .",
    "an application highlighting some limitations of continuous maps in analyzing structure in large point sets can be found in @xcite . in computational materials",
    "science research , continuous `` order parameter '' mappings are often constructed to summarize structural information near each particle in a system of particles .",
    "this order parameter is subsequently used to identify larger - scale structural features of the system .",
    "the continuity of the order - parameter entails that points arbitrarily far apart in a relevant configuration space will map to the same order - parameter value .",
    "consequently , continuous order - parameters regularly fail to distinguish structurally distinct configurations of points , making automated analysis difficult or impossible . in that paper , the authors suggest a discrete order - parameter , based on voronoi cell topology , which largely avoids this degeneracy .",
    "we note that theorem [ first theorem ] can be obtained as a consequence of corollary 0.3 in @xcite , though the proof here is simpler .",
    "also , a similar result for proper mappings can be found as a consequence of an exercise presented at the end of section 3.3 in @xcite .",
    "finally , theorem [ first theorem ] can also be obtained as a simple corollary of what larry guth has called the `` large fiber lemma '' ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 7.6 ) , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 6 ) , itself a corollary of the lebesgue covering lemma which is used in topological dimension theory .",
    "if @xmath87^n \\rightarrow \\mathbb{r}^m$ ] is a continuous map where @xmath1 , then one of the fibers of @xmath2 has diameter at least 1 .",
    "[ largefiberlemma ]    the technique used in the proof of theorem [ first theorem ] can also be used to strengthen this lemma in two ways .",
    "first , we can replace the unit @xmath36-cube with the inscribed @xmath88-sphere of unit diameter .",
    "second , the inequality of the conclusion becomes an equality .",
    "this paper is concerned with fibers in @xmath8 equipped with the standard euclidean metric .",
    "it is easily shown that theorem [ first theorem ] can fail when @xmath8 is equipped with other metrics . for example , we can map @xmath89 homeomorphically to the cylinder capped by a half - sphere on one end and unbounded on the other .",
    "if the origin is mapped to the center of the spherical cap , then fibers of the distance function to the origin are circles whose diameters are all bounded by that of the cylinder .",
    "thus , one might wonder about necessary and sufficient conditions on the metric for theorem [ first theorem ] to hold .    in this paper",
    ", we proved that the union of small fibers can have unbounded diameter when @xmath4 .",
    "however , one might ask if there must exist a line through the origin in @xmath8 onto which the projection of this set is bounded .",
    "if so , is there a lower bound on the number of such orthogonal lines , depending on @xmath36 and @xmath42 ?",
    "the authors would like to thank the anonymous referee for numerous helpful remarks on an earlier draft ."
