    "since the discovery of 51  pegasi  b in 1995 @xcite , the search for and discovery of extrasolar planets has broadly changed our understanding of planetary systems .",
    "direct imaging allows for the discovery of planets on solar system - scale orbits , provides new insight into the formation and characteristics of extrasolar systems , and enable direct spectroscopic observations of their atmospheres . despite decades of efforts to image young jupiter - mass exoplanets still luminous as a result of their formation process , only a handful of extrasolar planets have ever been directly imaged .",
    "examples of such planets include 2m1207b @xcite , @xcite , the hr8799 system @xcite , @xmath0  pic  b @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , 51 eri b @xcite , and hd 131399 ab @xcite .",
    "@xmath0  pictoris ( @xmath0  pic , hd 39060 ) is a @xmath11myr @xcite , a6v star located at a distance of @xmath12pc @xcite .",

    "the disk is seen edge - on and shows an asymmetric structure that has been attributed to planetary perturbations @xcite .",
    "the planet @xmath0  pic  b was first detected by vlt / naco @xcite . since then",
    ", its orbit has been constrained via careful astrometric monitoring @xcite .",
    "the atmospheric properties of the planet have been estimated from photometric and spectroscopic measurements using a number of adaptive optics ( ao ) fed instruments such as gemini / nici @xcite , magellan ao @xcite , gemini / gpi @xcite , and vlt / sphere @xcite .    because of the presence of a dynamically perturbed debris disk , along with well documented constraints on its age @xcite , the @xmath0  pic planetary system is an ideal laboratory to understand the formation and evolution of sub - stellar objects near the planet / brown dwarf limit .",
    "the luminosity and colors of @xmath0  pic  b are indeed similar to early - type brown dwarfs @xcite .",
    "however , constraints from radial velocity observations place its dynamical mass well below the value expected for an isolated field object of the same luminosity @xcite . the recently identified population of young isolated brown dwarfs with low - surface gravity is a more appropriate sample to compare to @xmath0  pic  b. recent work has provided a preliminary look at the near - infrared low resolution spectrum of @xmath0  pic  b @xcite and has highlighted the similarities between @xmath0  pic  b and low - gravity brown dwarfs in young associations and moving groups .",
    "such results naturally lead to questions regarding the formation mechanisms underlying these two type of objects that have apparently very different dynamical origins ( isolated vs. orbiting another star ) and yet look similar from a spectro - photometric standpoint @xcite .    in this paper",

    "observations performed during the instrument commissioning period ( november",
    "2013 - november 2014 ) were not all taken in a stable science environment , and various operational modes were used during a specific data set to evaluate performance of the instrument .",
    "for instance , during the 2013 november 18 observations , 32 individual 59.6s images were obtained in coronagraphic mode , with the cryocoolers operating at a reduced power level to reduce the effects of vibration introduced into the telescope @xcite .",
    "observations taken for testing purposes including changes in the ao performance parameters and the vibrations levels of the ifs cryocoolers affect the shape and stability of the gpi point spread function ( psf ) on a shorter time scale than would be expected from typical stable operations of gemini .    _",
    "y_-band data were obtained as part a gemini large and long program focused on the study of debris disks with gpi ( gs-2015b - lp-6 ) .",
    "these observations occurred when the planet had already moved significantly inwards , resulting in a higher level of noise in the estimated spectrum .",
    "the average seeing measured using a differential image motion monitor ( dimm ) , total exposure times , and instrument configurations of the observations presented in this paper are listed in table  [ tbl : observations ] , along with the specifics of the data - sets that were obtained during verification and commissioning .",
    "each of these data sets was individually and independently reduced using the gpi pipeline , with standard recipes provided by the gpi data reduction pipeline @xcite .",
    "a short arc lamp exposure was taken with each science observation set to account for offsets of the lenslet spectra due to flexure within the ifs .",
    "the gpi data reduction pipeline was used to reduce all images by applying dark corrections , fitting and removing vibration - induced microphonics noise @xcite , removing bad pixels , fitting satellite spot locations @xcite , and extracting each microspectra to create a 37-channel spectral cube . for _ k_-band data sky frames",

    "high - contrast imaging surveys for faint substellar companions typically use angular differential imaging ( adi , @xcite ) and/or spectral differential imaging ( sdi , @xcite ) .",

    "previous studies have used forward modeling approaches where a negative version of the psf is injected into the reduced images prior to psf subtraction to estimate the flux and position of faint companions detected in psf - subtracted images ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for this study",
    ", we use a different forward modeling approach that analytically models the effect of stellar psf subtraction on the psf of the planet to find the best planet spectrum that matches the signal of the planet after stellar psf subtraction .",
    "we use the generalized method klip - fm , described in @xcite , which combines the karhunen - love image projection algorithm ( klip , @xcite ) and forward modeling .",
    "@xcite demonstrated the effectiveness of klip - fm at reducing the systematic biases inherent in adi / sdi psf subtraction by injecting and recovering point sources with known spectra into into gpi _",
    "j_-band @xmath0  pic data .",
    "klip - fm has also been used to measure the astrometry of @xmath0  pic  b with gpi at milliarcsecond precision @xcite .",
    "the final psf - subtracted images of @xmath0  pic  b in each of the five gpi filters are shown in figure  [ fig : image_gallery ] .",
    "as described in @xcite , we use the four satellite spots in each spectral channel to estimate the psf of @xmath0  pic  b. when using such a psf fitting method , biases on the spectrum can arise due to a mismatch between the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the planet and model psfs . such a mismatch can occur as a result of the preliminary high - pass filter step before the klip psf subtraction , carried out in order to mitigate the impact of the residual atmospheric halo .",
    "we calibrated this effect in an _ ad - hoc _ fashion by exploring an increasing sequence of high - pass filtering cutoff frequencies .",
    "typically the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) of the planet increases with a more aggressive filter that eliminates the residual ao halo , but such filtering schemes create spurious slopes in the spectrum since they affect the morphology of the planet psf and of the satellite spots differently .",
    "fortunately , in all data sets considered here the planet snr is high enough so that there exists a large range of high - pass filtering parameters for which the planet spectrum is stable ( between 8 and 15px , as defined in @xcite ) .",
    "the resulting spectrum that minimizes the residuals at the location of @xmath0  pic  b was then estimated by forward modelling , normalized by the average satellite spot intensity in each wavelength channel .",
    "an 8000k , @xmath13[dex ] @xcite bt - nextgen model @xcite convolved to the resolution of gpi , was used to approximate the a6v stellar spectrum of @xmath0  pic  a. this allows the instrumental and telluric features under identical conditions to be estimated for the planet spectrum and then removed . to exclude low snr data at the edges of the filter band - passes , we trim the @xmath0  pic  b spectrum to exclude wavelength channels where the filter transmission is below 80% , excluding 27 of the 185 channels of the full spectrum",
    "the average snr per resolution element of the final trimmed spectrum , plotted in figure  [ fig : sed ] , was 3 in _ y _ , 17 in _",

    "the bolometric luminosity of @xmath0  pic  b was reassessed using the new spectroscopic measurements presented in section  [ sec : obs_data_reduction ] , which significantly improves the sampling of its spectral energy distribution ( sed ) in the @xmath17 ( 0.981.13 ) and @xmath18 ( 1.912.38 ) bands .",
    "the procedure is similar to that employed by @xcite .",
    "the gpi spectrum was combined with band - averaged photometry at 3.31 , 3.34 , @xmath19 ( 3.80 ) , 4.10 , and @xmath20 ( 4.72 ) , the values for which are given by @xcite .",
    "the @xmath21 ( 0.985 ) and @xmath18 ( 2.27 ) photometry measurements used by @xcite were rejected from this analysis due to the significant overlap with the new gpi spectrum presented in figure  [ fig : sed ] .",
    "the measured sed ( 0.984.72 ) was extended to shorter and longer wavelengths using two blackbody functions .",
    "the optical blackbody ( 0.010.97 ) was normalized to the integrated flux of the gpi @xmath17-band spectrum , while the infrared blackbody ( 4.731000 ) was normalized to the @xmath20 photometric point .",
    "the bolometric luminosity was then measured by integrating the synthetic spectrum formed by the combination of the measured sed and the two blackbody functions .",
    "the final luminosity and its uncertainty were estimated using a monte carlo approach by repeating the integration @xmath22 times .",
    "random draws were made for each trial from each of the band - average photometric points .",
    "the individual gpi spectra were varied by drawing from a normal distribution created from a quadratic sum of the band - averaged uncertainty and the satellite spot ratio uncertainty .",
    "conservatively , each point within an individual gpi spectrum was adjusted by the same amount to account for correlation between the spectral channels .",
    "the temperature of the two blackbody functions was drawn from a uniform distribution between 1500 and 1900k for each trial , and were normalized as described previously . despite the large range of temperatures ,",
    "there was no correlation between the choice of temperature for the blackbody extensions and the resulting luminosity . using the median and 1@xmath23 range of the @xmath22 trials , the bolometric luminosity of @xmath0  pic  b was found to be @xmath24[dex ] , consistent with the value reported in @xcite .",
    "while the choice of a blackbody function is a simplistic one , it only has a small contribution to the total flux of @xmath0  pic  b , with the short- and long - wavelength blackbody extensions contributing @xmath25% and @xmath26% , respectively .",
    "the bolometric luminosity of @xmath0  pic  b and the age estimate for the system of @xmath11  myr @xcite were compared to the hot - start evolutionary models to derive a model - dependent estimate of the mass ( @xmath27 ) , temperature ( @xmath28 ) , radius ( @xmath29 ) , and surface gravity ( @xmath30 ) of @xmath0  pic  b. a monte carlo procedure was used to propagate the uncertainty of the luminosity ( @xmath31 ) and age ( @xmath32 ) to the four derived parameters . at each step , a random luminosity and age were drawn from two normal distributions , one in @xmath33 and the other in @xmath32 .",
    "the model grid was linearly interpolated first in @xmath34 to the randomly selected age , and then in @xmath35 to an arbitrarily high resolution .",
    "interpolation was performed in @xmath33 , @xmath36 , @xmath29 , and @xmath37 due to their behavior as a function of @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "the randomly selected luminosity was then used to select a model within the interpolated grid .",
    "this process was repeated @xmath22 times yielding @xmath38@xmath2 , @xmath39k , @xmath40@xmath5 , and @xmath6[dex ] ( figure  [ fig : params ] ) .",
    "these are consistent consistent with the results of a previous analysis by @xcite , who reported a mass , effective temperature , and radius for @xmath0  pic  b of @xmath41@xmath2 , @xmath42k , and @xmath43@xmath5 , respectively .",
    "the spectrum of @xmath0  pic  b was compared with a library of 1600 m- , l- , and t - dwarf spectra compiled from the spex prism library @xcite , the irtf spectral library @xcite , the montreal spectral library ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and the sample of young ultracool dwarfs presented in @xcite .",
    "the spectral types for the objects within the library were obtained from a number of literature sources , and are given for the individual objects described later in this section .",
    "the near - infrared spectral type was used for objects with both an optical and near - infrared spectral type .",
    "the literature was also searched to obtain the surface gravity classifications for each object , using either of the schemes outlined by ( @xmath44 , @xmath0 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , in descending order of surface gravity ) , or @xcite ( fld - g , int - g , vl - g , similarly ) .",
    "briefly , both classification schemes categorize ultracool dwarfs into three groupings : field surface gravity consistent with that seen for old field dwarfs ( @xmath44 , fld - g ) , intermediate surface gravity ( @xmath0 , int - g ) , and very low surface gravity consistent with that seen for young brown dwarfs ( @xmath45 , vl - g ) . define a fourth classification , @xmath46 , for objects which exhibit even stronger low - gravity features in their spectra than those classified as @xmath45 .",
    "the spectrum of each object was degraded to the spectral resolution of gpi ( between @xmath47 at @xmath17 and @xmath48 at @xmath49 ) by convolution with a gaussian function of the appropriate width .",
    "the uncertainties were similarly degraded , normalized by the effective number of spectral channels within the convolution window .",
    "the spectrum of @xmath0  pic  b was compared to this library using three different procedures .",
    "first , the five gpi bands were fit independently to explore the sensitivity of each bandpass to the spectral type and surface gravity of @xmath0  pic  b. second , the five bands were fit simultaneously but were each normalized independently and without constraint to account for both the dispersion in near - infrared colors of young low - gravity brown dwarfs ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and for the uncertainty in the photometric calibration of the gpi data .",
    "third , the five bands were fit simultaneously as before , but the normalization of each band was restricted by the uncertainty of the photometric calibration of the gpi data @xcite .",
    "we find that all three methods yield similar results in terms of the spectral type of @xmath0  pic  b , and provide strong evidence for a low surface gravity .",
    "the spectrum of @xmath0  pic  b in each of the four near - infrared bands ( _ yjhk _ ) was fit to the corresponding spectrum of each comparison object within the library .",
    "k_-band spectrum of @xmath0  pic  b was created by combining the gpi _",
    "k1 _ and _ k2 _ spectra , discarding the overlapping spectral channels within the _ k1 _ spectrum due to systematics in the _ k1 _ spectrum .",
    "the spectrum of the comparison object was multiplied by a scaling factor to account for the different distance and radius between that object and @xmath0  pic  b. the optimal scaling factor was found analytically for each object and band ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the uncertainty on the spectrum of @xmath0  pic  b and the comparison object were added in quadrature .",
    "the number of degrees of freedom was typically 29 for _ y _ band , 32 for _ j _ band , 34 for _ h _ band , and 56 for _ k _ band .",

    "k_-band spectra to surface gravity is apparent in figure  [ chi2a ] , with the low - surface gravity objects typically providing a better fit to @xmath0  pic  b than field - gravity objects of the same spectral type .",
    "given the low resolution of the gpi data , this sensitivity is primarily due to differences in the shape of the continuum between field and low - gravity objects @xcite , rather than differences in the strengths of gravity - sensitive absorption lines .",
    "the difference between the spectra of field and low - gravity objects is most pronounced in the _ h _ and _ k _ bands , where the minimum @xmath50 of the low - surface gravity objects is significantly lower than that of field - gravity objects of the same spectral type ( fig .",
    "[ chi2a ] ) .",
    "we estimated the spectral type of @xmath0  pic  b in each band by a comparison to the spectra of field surface gravity standards @xcite , and low - surface gravity standards @xcite .",
    "the weighted average of the numerical spectral types of the standards , weighted according to the ratio of their @xmath51 to the minimum @xmath51 of all the standards ( e.g. , @xcite ) , was adopted as the spectral type .",
    "a systematic uncertainty of one half subtype was assumed for the standards .",
    "this process was repeated for both surface gravity subsets , and for each of the five bands .",
    "the adopted spectral type and corresponding uncertainty for @xmath0  pic  b are given for each band in figure  [ chi2a ] , ranging from l2 to l6.5 for the field surface gravity standards and from l1.5 to l2.5 for the low - surface gravity standards , both rounded to the nearest half subtype .",
    "the full gpi spectrum of @xmath0  pic  b was then fit to each object within the library .",
    "each band of the spectrum was scaled independently to account for the dispersion in near - infrared colors seen for brown dwarfs of a given spectral type @xcite , and for the uncertainty in the absolute flux calibration of the gpi data @xcite .",

    "the @xmath99 statistic for each model in comparison to the spectral data was calculated using the method described in section  [ sec : comparison_w_field_ojb ] and using equation  , where @xmath66 is the flux of model spectrum in the same channel and band .",
    "the @xmath50 statistic was calculated for each band , and for the spectral bands a punitive factor to account for the uncertainty on the satellite spot ratio in that band was used .",
    "we compute this best fit result using only the existing photometry points and for the photometry points combined with the gpi spectrum .",
    "the best fit results span a range of grid models from 17001800k , with a @xmath37  @xmath100@xmath101[dex ] and a @xmath102@xmath103@xmath5 .",

    "the grids were also interpolated using a bilinear interpolation scheme which produced similar results .",
    "we ran the same analysis as above and find that the best fit results span a range of grid models from 16511815k , with a @xmath37  @xmath109@xmath110[dex ] and a @xmath111@xmath112@xmath5 .",

    "these confidence intervals only represent the uncertainty on these parameters for this specific model .",
    "the observed sed was also compared with the combined evolutionary and atmospheric models of @xcite using the same fitting procedure as with the previous grids .",
    "these models differ from the atmosphere - only models in that the grid was computed in terms of the mass and initial entropy of the planet , rather than the effective temperature and surface gravity .",
    "the @xcite grid is bound by the canonical low - entropy `` cold - start '' ( 8@xmath118/baryon ) , and high - entropy `` hot - start '' ( 13@xmath118/baryon ) models ( c.f .",

    ", the initial entropy describes how efficiently heat was radiated away from the forming planet during accretion ; formation through gravitational instability may result in a significantly higher initial entropy than formation through core accretion .",
    "these evolutionary models were then coupled with an atmospheric model @xcite to create synthetic spectra at each grid point .",
    "the atmospheric model used either a solar ( @xmath119 ) or super - solar ( @xmath120 ) metallicity , and either cloud - free or with a linear superposition of cloudy and cloud - free models ( hybrid clouds ) . in total , four grids of synthetic spectra were compared to the sed of @xmath0  pic  b , spanning this range of atmospheric properties . as the age of @xmath0  pic  b is well - constrained , the sed of the planet was only fit to the 25myr models within each of the four grids .",
    "as with the fits to the atmospheric models in section  [ sec : atmo_models ] , two fits of the sed of @xmath0  pic  b were made to each grid .",
    "the first using only the photometry presented in @xcite , and the second combining this with the gpi spectrum presented in this study .",
    "the results from these fits are given in table  [ tbl : best_fit_results_entropy ] and the best fit spectrum for each of the different models for both photometry only and gpi spectrum and photometry are shown in figure  [ fig : sed_entropy ] .",
    "the results of the fit to only the photometry of @xmath0  pic  b are consistent with that of @xcite , with a best fit model at a mass of 14.0@xmath2  and an initial entropy of 9.75@xmath118/baryon for each grid . including the gpi spectrum slightly changed the best fit in each case , to a lower initial entropy for the cloud - free models , and to a higher mass for both the cloud - free and hybrid cloud models . in general , the quality of the fit to the spectrum was poor , with a minimum @xmath50 of 6.0 ( figure  [ fig : sed_entropy ] ) , compared with a minimum @xmath50 of 1.8 for the model atmosphere fits presented in section  [ sec : atmo_models ] . including the gpi spectrum in the fit significantly increases the @xmath50 for the cloud - free models , and as such they are not discussed further .",
    "this process was repeated on an interpolated version of the grid to explore the effects of the finitely sampled grid on the results . as in section",
    "[ sec : atmo_models ] , a @xmath50 surface was calculated for each model grid for both of the data sets .",
    "these surfaces , shown in figure  [ fig : entropy_mass ] , suggest that the global minimum may have been missed by @xcite due to the spacing of the grid points in mass . using only the photometry",
    ", we find a minimum at a significantly higher initial entropy of 13@xmath118/baryon and a lower mass of 13.5@xmath2 , compared with 9.75@xmath118/baryon and 14.0@xmath2  reported by @xcite .",
    "the 1@xmath23 confidence interval extends between 1013@xmath118/baryon , but is tightly constrained in terms of mass .",
    "the fits to the hybrid cloud models including the gpi spectrum are consistent with those from the coarse grid described previously , however the @xmath50 surface is similar to that from the photometry - only fit .",
    "while the minimum is at an intermediate entropy ( 9.75@xmath118/baryon ) and high mass ( 15@xmath2 ) , this extends to lower masses ( 13.5@xmath2 ) at a range of entropies ( 1013@xmath118/baryon ) .",
    "this complex minimum is also seen when fitting the empirical luminosity of @xmath0  pic  b given in section  [ sec : bol_lum ] to the luminosity of each model grid calculated by integrating the synthetic spectra ( figure  [ fig : entropy_mass ] , top row ) .",
    "these higher initial entropies are consistent with previous comparisons to evolutionary models showing that the initial entropy is higher than 10.5@xmath118/baryon at the 95% confidence level @xcite .",
    "we present the spectrum of @xmath0  pic  b in _ y _ , _ j _ , _ h _ , and _",
    "k _ bands as observed with the gemini planet imager between 2013 and 2016 using images which were taken as part of the verification and commissioning process , as part of an astrometric monitoring program , and as part of a gemini large and long program using gpi .",
    "not all of the presented data was originally intended to be used for spectral extraction of the planet , but it is of sufficient quality and is valuable as it improves our understanding of the emission spectrum of @xmath0  pic  b. using the standard gpi data reduction pipeline and klip - fm to extract the spectrum , we recover the planet at a high snr in @xmath17 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath18 bands allowing a nearly full sample across the near - ir .",
    "we compare the spectral energy distribution of @xmath0  pic  b to that of young , cool , low - surface gravity brown dwarfs , and to several grids of model atmospheres that are valid over the temperature and surface gravity range expected for these objects . compared with the near - infrared spectra of brown dwarfs in young moving groups and the field , we find that the best fit spectra are those of young low - gravity objects .",
    "of all the objects compared the spectrum of @xmath0  pic  b best matches that of 2mass  j03552337 + 1133437 , a confirmed member of the @xmath55myr ab doradus moving group that exhibits strong indicators of low surface gravity @xcite . based on our fits to the low - gravity standards of @xcite",
    ", we adopt a spectral type and gravity classification of l@xmath121 for @xmath0  pic  b.    combining the gpi spectrum with literature photometry spanning from @xmath122 ( 0.985 ) to @xmath20 ( 4.72 ) , we directly measure the bolometric luminosity of the planet to be @xmath24[dex ] , consistent with previous estimates derived from photometry alone @xcite .",
    "comparing to `` hot - start '' evolutionary models yields model - dependent estimates for the physical properties of @xmath0  pic  b of @xmath38@xmath2 , @xmath39k , @xmath40@xmath5 , and @xmath6[dex ] .",
    "the full sed of @xmath0  pic  b was also compared to atmospheric and evolutionary model grids spanning a range of atmospheric properties and formation scenarios .",
    "the best atmospheric fits we find are to a drift phoenix model atmosphere with an @xmath104@xmath105k , @xmath37  @xmath106[dex ] , and @xmath107@xmath5(@xmath108 ) .",
    "these values are consistent with those derived from the bolometric luminosity , and with empirical spectral type to effective temperature relations derived for young low - gravity brown dwarfs ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    comparing to the combined atmospheric and evolutionary models of @xcite yielded a best fit at a mass of 15@xmath2and an intermediate entropy of 9.75 @xmath118/baryon , with models including a cloudy atmosphere being strongly preferred over those with a clear atmosphere .",
    "while the best fit was found at an initial entropy that is intermediate to the predictions of the `` cold - start '' and `` hot - start '' formation scenarios , the @xmath50 surface for the interpolated version of the grid has a complex structure with a minimum extending to lower masses ( @xmath123@xmath2 ) at a range of initial entropy values between between @xmath12410 and 13 @xmath118/baryon , the higher value being similar to that predicted by the  hot - start  formation scenarios . although the points on the finer grid are based on an interpolation of the coarse grid , this analysis suggests that the choice of grid point location and spacing may significantly impact the resulting best fit . if the grid were sampled more finely or shifted by 0.5@xmath2 , and assuming the interpolated points are a reasonable representation of the `` true '' model with those parameters , @xcite would have reported a higher entropy as the best fit model .",
    "the empirical bolometric luminosity presented here combined with the dynamical mass constraints from @xcite , and the comparison to the atmospheric and evolutionary models of @xcite both suggest a `` hot - start '' high - entropy formation scenario for @xmath0  pic  b , and are consistent with the prediction that `` cold - start '' low - entropy formation is an unlikely formation mechanism for wide - orbit giant planets ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) . as @xmath0  pic",
    "b heads towards maximum elongation in 2023 it will become separated enough from its host star to be resolved by the near- and mid - ir instruments on the upcoming _ james webb space telescope_. combining the measurements presented here with mid - ir spectroscopy would provide further insight into the atmospheric properties and evolutionary history of the planet .",
    "interpretation of a well - sampled sed spanning over a decade in wavelength would be extremely well - suited for retrieval techniques ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) rather than by fitting to finitely - spaced model grids .",
