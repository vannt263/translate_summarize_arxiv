    "in this paper we discuss new developments in the @xmath4 skyrme model @xcite and its generalization to the case where the physical space is a @xmath0-sphere of radius @xmath2 .",
    "the skyrme model is a nonlinear field theory of mesons whose field configurations are labelled by an integer , the topological charge .",
    "this charge can be identified with the baryon number @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "static field configurations which minimize the energy of the skyrme model for a given baryon number @xmath5 are called skyrmions .",
    "when the theory is quantized , the skyrme model not only describes the proton and the neutron reasonably well @xcite but also larger nuclei @xcite .",
    "however , in order to be able to perform the quantization it is important to reach a good understanding of the classical solutions . in @xcite skyrmions were calculated numerically for small baryon number @xmath5 , and it was shown that they have certain discrete symmetries .",
    "these symmetries have been confirmed by the rational map ansatz @xcite which also reproduces the energies of the skyrmions with good accuracy .    from a mathematical point of view",
    ", field configurations in the skyrme model are represented by maps from @xmath6 to @xmath7 .",
    "therefore , it is natural to generalize the model such that physical space is a @xmath0-sphere of radius @xmath2 . from a physical point of view , a skyrmion on a @xmath0-sphere describes a finite baryon density @xcite . reducing @xmath2 increases the baryon density .",
    "varying @xmath2 the @xmath1 model exhibits phenomena such as localization  delocalization transitions and the restoration of chiral symmetry .",
    "these results can be compared with skyrme crystal calculations @xcite , but are also interesting in their own right .    in this paper",
    "we only consider static configurations and their energies .",
    "in particular , we generalize the rational map ansatz to describe skyrmions on @xmath1 .",
    "the energies of our ansatz are the lowest ones known so far .",
    "moreover , these approximations have a well defined limit for @xmath8 , namely , the rational map skyrmions in flat space .",
    "geometric considerations lead to an analytic ansatz for the shape function which is completely specified by a small set of parameters .",
    "we show that this ansatz agrees well with the numerical solution and captures the behaviour of skyrmions on @xmath1 .    in the following section we review the skyrme model on general @xmath0-dimensional manifolds .",
    "the first part focuses on the geometrical meaning of the skyrme energy .",
    "the next part clarifies the relationship between the geometric formulation in flat space and the standard formulation in terms of the lie group @xmath4 . in section [ rationalmaps ]",
    "the model is generalized to the @xmath0-sphere .",
    "we describe the rational map ansatz in detail and also recall the doubly axially - symmetric ansatz @xcite . in section [ conformalmap ]",
    "we derive an analytic ansatz for the shape function and discuss its symmetries . for special values of @xmath5",
    "the energy can be calculated explicitly as a function of the radius @xmath2 . in section [ numericalresults ]",
    "we calculate the shape function numerically .",
    "we also compare the numerical shape function to the analytic shape function of the previous section . finally , we use the analytic shape function to approximate skyrmions in @xmath9 . in section [ phasetransitions ]",
    "we discuss chiral symmetry and phase transitions .",
    "in this section we describe static solutions of the skyrme model on general @xmath0-dimensional manifolds .",
    "we follow manton s approach @xcite and present a geometric point of view .",
    "first , we introduce the geometric notion of the strain tensor and construct the skyrme energy for general manifolds .",
    "then we discuss the properties of the energy density and derive some formulae which will be important in the following sections .",
    "finally , we show that in flat space the geometric energy density is equivalent to the standard energy density .",
    "a field configuration is a map @xmath10 from a physical space @xmath11 to a target space @xmath12 .",
    "both @xmath11 and @xmath12 are @xmath0-dimensional riemannian manifolds which are connected and orientable , and their metrics are @xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively .",
    "we denote by @xmath15 a point in @xmath11 and @xmath16 its image in @xmath12 .",
    "choosing dreibeins @xmath17 on @xmath11 and @xmath18 on @xmath12 , we can define the jacobian matrix @xmath19 the matrix @xmath20 is a measure of the deformation induced by the map @xmath10 at the point @xmath15 in @xmath11 .",
    "however , it is not unique since a rotation of the dreibeins @xmath18 does not affect the geometrical deformation .",
    "this leads us to define the strain tensor @xmath21 which only depends on the metric on @xmath12 . here and in the following we suppress the direct reference to @xmath15 .",
    "the strain tensor is symmetric and positive semi - definite is non - degenerate so that @xmath22 is positive definite .",
    "however , there are submanifolds of zero baryon density , i.e. @xmath23 . for further discussion see @xcite . ] but it is not invariant under rotation of the dreibeins @xmath24 .",
    "in fact , under an orthogonal transformation @xmath25 , @xmath22 transforms into @xmath26 . a well known result from linear algebra",
    "is that the characteristic polynomial @xmath27 is invariant under orthogonal transformations .",
    "denoting the non - negative eigenvalues of the strain tensor @xmath22 by @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 we obtain the following invariants of @xmath22 : @xmath31 as we will demonstrate in this section , choosing the energy of a field configuration to be the integral of the following sum of these invariants generalizes the skyrme model to arbitrary manifolds @xmath11 and @xmath12 : @xmath32 where the integration measure is @xmath33 .",
    "the first three terms are only quadratic in the derivatives and correspond to the `` sigma model term '' .",
    "the configurations which are minimizing this term are known as harmonic maps @xcite .",
    "geometrically , @xmath10 induces a linear map @xmath34 mapping the unit vector @xmath24 which is formed by the @xmath35th dreibein to the vector @xmath36 .",
    "the sum of the squared lengths of these vectors is the `` sigma model term '' .",
    "thus , only the lengths of the vectors @xmath37 are important .",
    "the geometric meaning of the quartic terms can be understood by considering the area element @xmath38 formed by two dreibeins .",
    "this area element is mapped to the following area element in @xmath12 : @xmath39 the sum of the squares of these area elements is proportional to the `` skyrme term '' .",
    "this term is also a measure of the angular distortion of the map @xmath34 .",
    "so far only the first two invariants of the strain tensor have been used .",
    "the third invariant is the square of the determinant of the jacobian , @xmath40 .",
    "since the manifolds @xmath11 and @xmath12 are orientable , @xmath41 is globally well defined so that we can set @xmath42 .",
    "@xmath43 locally changes the integration measure on @xmath11 into the measure on @xmath12 .",
    "therefore , the integral of @xmath43 over @xmath11 is equal to the volume @xmath44 times the degree of the map @xmath10 .",
    "the degree of a map is a topological invariant which , roughly speaking , measures how many preimages a point @xmath16 of @xmath12 has in @xmath11 , and hence takes integer values .",
    "any field configuration can be labelled by its degree . in the skyrme model",
    "the degree of the map @xmath10 is identified with the baryon number @xmath5 , and we obtain @xmath45 we will call classical field configurations which minimize the energy ( [ egeo ] ) skyrmions .",
    "it is worth pointing out that there is an alternative expression for equation ( [ egeo ] ) . by `` completing the square ''",
    "we can rearrange the @xmath46 in the following way : @xmath47 either the upper or the lower signs are chosen such that the integral over the last term in equation ( [ egeo2 ] ) is non - negative .",
    "applying equation ( [ bgeo ] ) , this integral is just @xmath48 .",
    "therefore , the energy is bounded below by the so - called faddeev - bogomolny bound @xcite : @xmath49 equation ( [ egeo2 ] ) also gives rise to two sets of three bogomolny equations which are satisfied if and only if the faddeev - bogomolny bound is attained , @xmath50 the only non - trivial solutions of both sets of equations are @xmath51 , and it follows that @xmath52 .",
    "therefore , the strain tensor is the identity map , and the map @xmath10 is an isometry . for @xmath53 , this case can only occur if the physical space is a @xmath0-sphere of radius @xmath54 .",
    "this has already been proven in @xcite .",
    "the relative importance of the `` sigma model term '' and the `` skyrme term '' can be seen from their scaling behaviour . for this purpose",
    "we consider a family of metrics @xmath55 where @xmath2 is a constant length scale .",
    "the dreibeins @xmath24 are , informally speaking , the square roots of the inverse metric @xmath56 of @xmath11 . therefore , they are proportional to @xmath57 so that the eigenvalues @xmath58 of the strain tensor @xmath59 are proportional to @xmath60 .",
    "since the measure @xmath61 scales with @xmath62 , the `` sigma model term '' scales like @xmath2 , whereas the skyrme term scales like @xmath57 . for large radius @xmath2",
    "one might expect the `` sigma model term '' to be dominant . yet , this is not the case because , as we shall see , the skyrmion becomes localized and  just as in flat space  both of these terms are equally important .",
    "however , for small radius @xmath2 the configuration is delocalized , and the `` skyrme term '' will become dominant .    in the following , we relate this geometric formulation to the standard skyrme model in flat space . for",
    "the remainder of this section @xmath11 will correspond to the flat space @xmath9 and @xmath12 to the lie group @xmath63 .",
    "the basic field is the @xmath4 valued field @xmath64 where @xmath65 are the pauli matrices which are hermitian and satisfy the algebra @xmath66 . since @xmath67 is an element of @xmath4 , the fields @xmath68 and @xmath69 obey the constraint @xmath70 .",
    "it is worth noting that @xmath69 in ( [ u ] ) play the same role as the coordinates @xmath71 in the discussion above , and @xmath68 is just a function of those coordinates",
    ". the static solutions of the skyrme model can be derived by varying the following energy @xcite : @xmath72[r_i , r_j ] \\right )   \\right ) { \\rm d}^3 { \\bf x}\\ ] ] where @xmath73 is an @xmath74 valued current .",
    "a static solution of the variational equations could also be a saddle point .",
    "only solutions which minimize the energy are called skyrmions . in order to show that the energies ( [ egeo ] ) and ( [ estandard ] ) are equivalent , we first relate the strain tensor @xmath59 to the current @xmath75 .",
    "since @xmath68 is determined by @xmath69 we can calculate the induced metric @xmath14 on the target space @xmath12 in terms of the fields @xmath69 : @xmath76 starting from equation ( [ straintensor ] ) and noting that in flat space the dreibeins can be chosen to be kronecker deltas we obtain the following expression : @xmath77 equation ( [ d2 ] ) follows from ( [ d1 ] ) by using the chain rule and the formula for the metric ( [ metrictau ] ) .",
    "conceptually , the step from equation ( [ d2 ] ) to equation ( [ d3 ] ) is very important .",
    "the metric @xmath14 is expressed with the group multiplication and the trace which provides a scalar product in @xmath74 .",
    "this is the transition from geometric to lie group language .",
    "equation ( [ d4 ] ) is a trivial consequence of definition ( [ u ] ) , and the last equation follows from @xmath78 .",
    "now , we can show that the two energy densities are equal .",
    "since @xmath75 is an @xmath74 current , and therefore anti - hermitian , it can be expressed as @xmath79 .",
    "we start with the energy density in ( [ estandard ] ) and expand @xmath75 in terms of pauli matrices : @xmath80 r_i^{\\mu^\\prime } r_j^{\\nu^\\prime }   [ i \\tau_{\\mu^\\prime},i \\tau_{\\nu^\\prime } ] \\right ) \\\\ \\nonumber \\\\",

    "the last equality follows from the definition of the trace .",
    "equation ( [ ed5 ] ) is the energy ( [ egeo ] ) because of ( [ deftrace ] ) .",
    "therefore , we have shown the equivalence of the two approaches for @xmath83 .",
    "it is worth noting that in the geometric picture the `` skyrme term '' is related to the square of an area element , whereas in the standard approach it depends on the structure constants of the lie algebra @xmath74 .",
    "both interpretations lead to generalizations .",
    "while in our geometric interpretation it is natural to consider different @xmath0-dimensional manifolds for @xmath11 , and maybe for @xmath12 , the lie algebra approach leads to generalizing the lie group @xmath4 for example to @xmath84 .",
    "in the previous section we have established the equivalence of the two energies ( [ egeo ] ) and ( [ estandard ] ) in @xmath9 . in this section",
    "we will use ( [ egeo ] ) to generalize the model to @xmath85 such that from now on physical space is a 3-sphere of radius @xmath2 .",
    "this includes the original model if we take the limit @xmath86 .",
    "we also fix @xmath87 .",
    "the skyrme model can not be solved analytically either in flat space , or on @xmath88 , apart from the case if @xmath54 and @xmath89 as mentioned above . however , in flat space there are analytic anstze which give good qualitative and quantitative agreement with exact solutions obtained numerically . by ansatz we mean a test function that minimizes the energy within a given class of test functions .",
    "the lower the energy the better we expect the ansatz to approximate the exact solution . in the following",
    "we will generalize the rational map ansatz @xcite , which has been very successful in flat space , to @xmath88 .",
    "a rational map is a holomorphic function from @xmath90 . treating each @xmath91 as a riemann sphere , with complex coordinates @xmath92 and @xmath93 , respectively ,",
    "a rational map can be written as @xmath94 where @xmath95 and @xmath96 are polynomials in @xmath92 which are assumed to have no common factors .",
    "it has been shown by donaldson @xcite , and also by jarvis @xcite , that there is a one - to - one correspondence between rational maps and monopoles . in flat space",
    "it has been found that many solutions of the skyrme equation with baryon number @xmath5 look rather like monopoles with monopole number equal to @xmath5 .",
    "therefore , rational maps can be used to approximate skyrmions .",
    "a point @xmath15 on @xmath88 is labelled by polar coordinates @xmath97 such that @xmath98 where @xmath99 , @xmath100 $ ] , and @xmath101 $ ] and @xmath102 is the unit vector on @xmath91 .",
    "the @xmath0-sphere can be thought of as a collection of @xmath103-spheres with varying radius equal to @xmath104 . with the stereographic projection",
    "@xmath105 the @xmath91 can be identified with a riemann sphere using a single complex coordinate @xmath92 .",
    "alternatively , we can express the unit vector @xmath106 in terms of @xmath92 : @xmath107 similarly , points in the target @xmath1 can be labelled by @xmath108 where @xmath109 is an angular variable analogous to @xmath99 , and @xmath93 is a complex coordinate .",
    "the rational map ansatz simply states that @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "this is only consistent if @xmath112 vanishes where @xmath113 does , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath114 and @xmath115 .",
    "the integer @xmath116 is a topological invariant and can not be changed by deforming @xmath117 smoothly . in order to have a good limit for @xmath8 we fix @xmath117 such that @xmath118 and set @xmath119 . in analogy to flat space we define a skyrmion to have @xmath120 , whereas for an anti - skyrmion @xmath121 .",
    "since skyrmions and anti - skyrmions are related by reflection we will only consider skyrmions from now on .",
    "therefore , our complete boundary conditions are : @xmath122 in contrast to the flat case these boundary conditions do not follow from a regularity argument .",
    "they are an artifact of our ansatz and have to be handled with care ( see @xcite for a discussion ) .",
    "if we now use the notation of equation ( [ u ] ) we can write the skyrme field in the following way : @xmath123 where @xmath124 is as in equation ( [ normalv ] ) .",
    "equation ( [ urat2 ] ) looks quite similar to the well known spherically symmetric hedgehog ansatz @xcite .",
    "in fact , the hedgehog ansatz corresponds to the special case @xmath125 .",
    "now , we can apply the formulae of the previous section .",
    "the rational map ansatz gives rise to the following eigenvalues @xmath58 of the strain tensor ( [ straintensor ] ) : @xmath126 the minus sign in the expression for @xmath127 is a consequence of our definition of positive baryon number in ( [ bc ] ) .",
    "one advantage of the rational map ansatz is the decoupling of the radial and the angular strains .",
    "starting from formula ( [ bgeo ] ) the baryon number @xmath5 can be written as a product of two integrals , one over @xmath99 and one over @xmath92 and @xmath128 in the following way : @xmath129 the integral over @xmath99 is the integer @xmath130 . the second integral",
    "is the pull - back of the area form on the target sphere of the rational map @xmath131 .",
    "taking the normalization into account this is just the degree @xmath132 of the rational map @xmath131 .",
    "in fact , it can be shown that if @xmath95 has the degree @xmath133 and @xmath96 has the degree @xmath134 then @xmath135",
    ".    the energy can now be obtained from formula ( [ egeo ] ) : @xmath136 \\frac{2i~{\\rm d } z { \\rm d } { \\bar z } } { ( 1 + |z|^2)^2 } l^3 \\sin^2 \\mu~{\\rm d}\\mu.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] similarly to the baryon density , the integration over @xmath92 and @xmath137 and the integration over @xmath99 factorizes . therefore , formula ( [ erational0 ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath138 where @xmath132 is the degree of the rational map , and @xmath139 is the following special function on the space of rational maps : @xmath140 to minimize @xmath141 for a given baryon number @xmath142 , one should first minimize @xmath139 over the space of rational maps of degree @xmath132 .",
    "this calculation was performed in @xcite , and the result is displayed in table [ tablea1 ] in the appendix . then the profile function @xmath117 is found by solving the following euler - lagrange equation : @xmath143 where @xmath139 now takes the constant value in table [ tablea1 ] .",
    "we require @xmath117 to be a solution of ( [ euler ] ) non - singular in @xmath144 $ ] .",
    "equation ( [ euler ] ) has to be solved numerically .",
    "it has regular singular points at the end points , _",
    "i.e. _ close to these points the solution has the following power law behaviour : @xmath145 for @xmath146 and @xmath147 for @xmath148 .",
    "here @xmath149 and @xmath150 and @xmath151 are arbitrary constants .",
    "the solution @xmath117 is regular if the exponent is equal to @xmath152 at both end points",
    ".    equation ( [ erational ] ) has an important discrete symmetry .",
    "the transformation @xmath153 transforms a solution of ( [ euler ] ) into a solution which is also compatible with the boundary conditions ( [ bc ] ) .",
    "geometrically , @xmath154 is a reflection at the plane through the equator in physical space , whereas @xmath155 is a reflection in target space .",
    "this means that a solution which is localized for example at the south pole @xmath156 is transformed to a solution which is localized at the north pole @xmath157 .",
    "therefore , for fixed @xmath5 there are two degenerate solutions unless the transformation ( [ fsymmetry ] ) is a symmetry of @xmath117 in which case there is only one symmetric solution . the symmetry ( [ fsymmetry ] ) does not have an analogue in flat space . also note that the transformations @xmath158 and @xmath159 take a skyrmion with baryon number @xmath5 into an anti - skyrmion with baryon number @xmath160 .    when we derived the energy of the rational map ansatz we used equation ( [ egeo ] ) .",
    "this could be transformed into equation ( [ egeo2 ] ) by `` completing the square '' .",
    "having now calculated the integral over the rational map , we can complete the square in a different way and re - express ( [ erational ] ) as @xmath161 { \\rm d }",
    "\\mu \\\\ \\nonumber \\\\ \\label{erat }   - 8 \\pi(2 n_r+\\sqrt{{\\cal i } } ) \\int_0^\\pi   f^\\prime \\sin^2 f~   { \\rm d } \\mu . \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the second integral in ( [ erat ] ) can be evaluated using @xmath162 and @xmath163 .",
    "since the first integral in ( [ erat ] ) is positive the second integral provides us with the energy bound @xmath164 the last inequality is valid because @xmath165 which can easily be shown by applying the schwartz inequality .",
    "therefore , inequality ( [ bograt ] ) `` improves '' the faddeev - bogomolny bound ( [ bogbound ] ) where @xmath166 and @xmath167 .",
    "this rational map bound ( [ bograt ] ) is valid , if the fields obey the rational map ansatz .",
    "exact solutions satisfy neither the rational map ansatz nor necessarily the bound ( [ bograt ] ) .",
    "we will discuss this bound further in section [ numericalresults ] .    before ending this section",
    "we review one further ansatz .",
    "the symmetry group of @xmath88 , which is @xmath168 , contains an @xmath169 subgroup .",
    "et al _ used this symmetry to obtain doubly axially - symmetric anstze for skyrmions of various baryon numbers @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "in order to make best use of the symmetry it is convenient to parameterize the @xmath0-sphere with a different set of angles @xmath170 . with these",
    "coordinates a point on @xmath88 can be written as @xmath171 where @xmath172 $ ] and @xmath173 $ ] .",

    "note that these boundary conditions for @xmath182 imply that @xmath185 . in @xcite",
    "the energy for a given baryon number @xmath5 was also minimized with respect to the radius @xmath2 .",
    "some of the results are displayed in figure [ fig5 ] of section [ numericalresults ] .",
    "it was shown that the solutions are only stable as long as @xmath2 is smaller than a @xmath5-dependent critical length @xmath186 .",
    "moreover , for large baryon number @xmath5 the minimal energy for the optimal radius @xmath2 is larger than the energy of @xmath5 well separated skyrmions in @xmath9 .",
    "therefore , in this situation the ansatz fails badly .",
    "however , for small baryon number @xmath5 and small radius @xmath2 the ansatz is quite successful .",
    "for @xmath89 it agrees with the known @xmath168 symmetric solution .",
    "for @xmath187 it predicts an @xmath169 symmetric solution with a very low energy .",
    "given that the exact @xmath187 solution in flat space possesses an @xmath188 symmetry this configuration is likely to be the exact solution on @xmath1 .",
    "one particular feature of configurations of the form ( [ o(2)ansatz ] ) is that the following order parameter @xmath189 vanishes : @xmath190 where @xmath191 means the average over the physical @xmath88 .",
    "it also turns out that configurations with @xmath192 attain their minimal energy at particularly small values of @xmath2 .",
    "moreover , for @xmath192 the solution has a symmetry similar to ( [ fsymmetry ] ) .",
    "the transformation @xmath193 transforms solutions of the euler - lagrange equation for the energy ( [ eo(2 ) ] ) into each other .",
    "we will need these properties in section [ phasetransitions ] .",
    "we discuss next the shape function @xmath117 of the rational map ansatz .",
    "since solving equation ( [ euler ] ) numerically provides little insight we derive an analytic shape function .",
    "this ansatz approximates the numerical shape function fairly accurately and also confirms geometric ideas .    in @xcite manton",
    "approximated the shape function of the @xmath89 skyrmion by a conformal map . with this ansatz",
    "he showed that a delocalized @xmath89 skyrmion on a @xmath0-sphere is unstable for @xmath194 . in this section",
    "we will generalize this idea for higher baryon number @xmath5 . using the rational map ansatz",
    "we will derive an ansatz for the shape function which is conformal in an average sense and which we will call quasi - conformal . in the following section",
    ", we will show that this quasi - conformal ansatz is a good approximation to the numerically calculated shape function .",

    "firstly , since @xmath117 is a function of @xmath99 only , we consider a conformal factor @xmath199 which is also only a function of @xmath99 .",
    "secondly , we recall that according to equation ( [ brational ] ) the integral over the target @xmath91 is just @xmath200 times the degree @xmath132 of the rational map .",

    "since @xmath117 is independent of @xmath92 and @xmath128 it can only detect the averaged value . with these approximations equation ( [ econformal ] ) can be simplified : @xmath201 eliminating @xmath202 from equation ( [ quasiconf ] ) we obtain the following differential equation for @xmath117 : @xmath203 we are interested in solutions which obey the boundary conditions ( [ bc ] ) .",
    "it is convenient to replace @xmath112 by @xmath204 before taking the square root : @xmath205 for the negative sign the solution of equation ( [ confeq2 ] ) diverges at the boundary and can therefore be discarded .",
    "equation ( [ confeq2 ] ) is solved by separation of variables , and we obtain @xmath206 where @xmath207 is a positive integration constant .",
    "a negative @xmath207 would lead to a negative baryon number and is incompatible with the boundary conditions ( [ bc ] ) whereas @xmath208 is just the trivial solution with baryon number @xmath209 .",
    "the quasi - conformal shape function ( [ confansatz ] ) satisfies our boundary conditions ( [ bc ] ) if and only if @xmath210 .",
    "with equation ( [ b = nfnr ] ) we obtain @xmath211 . the shape function ( [ confansatz ] )",

    "using the identity @xmath212 it is easy to show that for @xmath213 the shape function ( [ confansatz ] ) is invariant under the discrete symmetry ( [ fsymmetry ] ) : @xmath214 this means that for @xmath213 the solution is neither localized at the south pole nor at the north pole . for @xmath215",
    "the solution is delocalized over the whole sphere whereas for @xmath216 it is rather localized at the equator @xmath217 . by taylor expanding equation ( [ confansatz ] ) near @xmath218 we find that the shape function @xmath117 behaves like @xmath219 .",
    "recall that for the exact solution of the euler - lagrange equation ( [ euler ] ) we obtained @xmath220 where @xmath221 .",

    "this is consistent with the fact that for @xmath294 these configurations are bad approximations .",
    "another possible order parameter would be @xmath372 .",
    "this parameter @xmath373 is motivated by the fact that enhanced chiral symmetry , that is a symmetry that mixes @xmath68 and @xmath71 , could result in a vanishing of @xmath373 .",
    "for @xmath89 the situation is well understood . both parameters @xmath189 and @xmath373",
    "vanish at the same time .",

    "the chiral symmetry will be a subgroup of @xmath375 .",

    "for this special case we checked numerically that the symmetry is actually a symmetry of the shape function @xmath182 : @xmath379 this gives rise to a symmetry between @xmath68 and @xmath380 and leads to the vanishing of the order parameter @xmath373 .",

    "@xmath141 has a global minimum at an optimal radius @xmath273 .",
    "when the radius @xmath2 is further increased there is a bifurcation point at a critical length @xmath186 : below @xmath186 the skyrmion is symmetric under reflection at the plane through the equator of @xmath1 . above @xmath186",

    "one particular property of the quasi - conformal shape function is that it becomes more and more localized around the equator as the baryon number increases . to be more precise",
    ", the derivative of the shape function , which is connected to the baryon density , has a peak at the equator .",
    "since this ansatz was derived with the assumption that the map between the metrics is `` as conformal as possible '' we have found a geometric explanation of why skyrmions on the @xmath0-sphere are shell - like . in flat space",
    "the map can not be conformal .",
    "however , one `` half '' of the skyrmion in flat space resembles `` half '' a skyrmion on a @xmath0-sphere with optimal radius .",
    "this fits well with the observation in section [ numericalresults ] that the parameter @xmath320 which is a measure of the size of the skyrmion agrees well with the optimal length @xmath347 .",
    "this line of thought can be carried even further .",
    "skyrmions on the @xmath0-sphere might be a reasonable model for nuclei , once they are quantized .",
    "the main advantage of this model is that on the @xmath0-sphere one - loop corrections are expected to play a far less important role than in flat space . in particular , if the skyrmion lives on the @xmath0-sphere with the optimal radius we expect these corrections to be so small that the predictions of the skyrme model could be compared with experiment .",
    "the main motivation for this claim are the promising results in @xcite for the @xmath89 skyrmion on the @xmath0-sphere , and the fact that they predict a different value for the skyrme coupling which is in agreement with one - loop calculations performed in @xcite and the skyrme coupling therein .",
    "the author is grateful to n s manton for suggesting the problem , and also wants to thank the participants of the damtp soliton seminar for fruitful discussions .",
    "the author thanks pparc for a research studentship and the studienstiftung des deutschen volkes for a phd scholarship .",
    "table [ tablea1 ] shows the minimal value of the integral @xmath139 in equation ( [ cali ] ) as a function of @xmath132 , as has been calculated in @xcite .",
    "`` approx '' is the energy of the rational map ansatz for flat space skyrmions where the corresponding variational equation for the shape function has been solved numerically .",
    "the column `` true '' shows the value of the energy obtained by a numerical solution of the full set of partial differential equations .",
    "the next column `` sym '' shows the symmetries of the skyrmions .",
    "the numerical solutions and the rational map ansatz give the same symmetry .",
    "note that the respective values for @xmath330 in table [ tablea1 ] are taken from @xcite .",
    "there is evidence that for @xmath330 the symmetry and the other respective values in the table are different from the ones cited in @xcite .",
    "the last two columns are the optimal length @xmath273 and the optimal energy @xmath393 which are displayed in figure [ fig7 ] and [ fig6 ] , respectively .",
    "as described in chapter [ numericalresults ] , @xmath393 has been obtained by using the rational map of table [ tablea1 ] and calculating the shape function numerically .",
    "following @xcite we also include the values for @xmath394 . in this case",
    "the solution in flat space has marginally lower energy than @xmath346 .",
    "however , we still expect that the rational map ansatz is a good approximation even in this situation .",
    ".values of @xmath139 , the energies in flat space ( approx , true ) , the symmetry ( sym ) , and the optimal length @xmath273 and energy @xmath346 on @xmath1 .",
    "all values are given for baryon number @xmath327 for @xmath352 and @xmath395.[tablea1 ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     table [ tablea2 ] can be used to estimate which combination of @xmath130 and @xmath132 might be more stable for a given baryon number @xmath5 .",
    "it turns out that for @xmath382 the bound is lower for @xmath383 than for @xmath326 .",
    "it is also probable that the @xmath396 skyrmion has lower energy than the @xmath397 skyrmion .",
