    "starting with choptuik s investigation of scalar field collapse @xcite , and since then generalised to many other systems @xcite , critical collapse is concerned with the threshold of black hole formation in the space of initial data .",
    "a practical way of investigating this threshold is to pick any one - parameter family of asymptotically flat initial data , with parameter @xmath5 , such that for @xmath6 the data form a black hole , and for @xmath7 they do not .",
    "more specifically , `` type ii '' critical collapse is concerned with the case where the black hole mass can be made arbitrarily small at the threshold . a necessary condition for this to happen",
    "is that the system of einstein equations and matter evolution equations is scale - invariant , or effectively scale - invariant on sufficiently small length scales . as far as we know ,",
    "exact scale - invariance is also sufficient for the existence of type ii critical collapse .    in type ii critical collapse in @xmath8 spacetime dimensions , for @xmath7 ( `` subcritical '' data ) , the maximum value of curvature ( say the ricci scalar ) achieved on the spacetime scales as @xmath9 where in @xmath10 @xmath11 the relation ( [ deltafromgamma ] ) follows essentially from dimensional analysis , with @xmath12 the dimension ( in gravitational units @xmath13 ) of mass ( or energy ) .",
    "the exponent @xmath14 depends on the type of matter and spacetime dimension , but is universal for all 1-parameter families of initial data .    in a small spacetime region just before the point of maximum curvature , or just before the formation of an apparent horizon , the spacetime and matter field are approximated by a `` critical solution '' which is again universal for a given system and spacetime dimension .",
    "the critical solution has three defining properties : it is regular , scale - invariant ( continuously self - similar , css ) or scale - periodic ( discretely self - similar , dss ) , and it has precisely one unstable mode .",
    "continuous self - similarity means that there is a conformal killing vector field @xmath15 such that @xmath16 . in coordinates",
    "@xmath17 adapted to css and spherical symmetry ( but otherwise general ) , such that @xmath18 , this means that the metric takes the form @xmath19 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 is an arbitrary length scale .",
    "this functional form of the metric is invariant under gauge transformations of the form @xmath21 [ in dss , in adapted coordinates , the metric takes the same form , with @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 ( and @xmath26 , @xmath27 ) now depending periodically on @xmath28 with some scale - echoing period @xmath29 . ]",
    "the most general ansatz for a massless scalar field that is compatible , via the einstein equations with @xmath30 , with continuous self - similarity of the metric is the christodoulou ansatz @xcite @xmath31 for some constant @xmath32 .",
    "[ for dss , @xmath33 depends also on @xmath28 with period @xmath29 . ]",
    "the constant @xmath32 does not depend on the choice of similarity coordinates .",
    "the spherical scalar field critical solution in higher dimensions is dss with @xmath34 but , as we shall see later , in 2 + 1 dimensions it seems to be css with @xmath35 .    in a spherically symmetric critical solution , the regular centre corresponds to one value of @xmath36 .",
    "@xmath37 ( for all @xmath36 ) represents a single spacetime point at the centre , the accumulation point , where the curvature blows up .",
    "another value of @xmath36 corresponds to the past lightcone ( or soundcone , for fluid matter ) of the accumulation point , where the critical solution must also be regular .",
    "the critical solution can be continued in @xmath36 to the future lightcone of the accumulation point . beyond the future lightcone",
    ", there is no unique continuation , but that part of the critical solution is not relevant for critical collapse .    if we choose @xmath28 to be timelike or null , we can interpret it both as a time coordinate on spacetime and as the logarithm of scale in renormalisation group theory . from self - similarity and the existence of precisely one unstable mode , using a little dynamical systems theory and dimensional analysis , one can then derive both universality and the above scaling relations .",
    "@xmath14 turns out to be the inverse lyapunov exponent of the one unstable mode .",
    "this scaling argument @xcite goes roughly as follows : the closer @xmath5 to @xmath38 , the smaller the initial value of the one growing mode , the longer ( larger @xmath28 ) the spacetime stays close to the critical solution .",
    "but larger @xmath28 also means scalar field variation on smaller length scales , and hence larger curvature , before the solution either starts dispersing or forms an apparent horizon .    for a spherically symmetric massless scalar field in the presence of a negative cosmological constant",
    ", critical collapse has been investigated in 3 + 1 dimensions @xcite . in higher dimensions",
    ", critical collapse has been investigated in @xcite for @xmath30 , and in @xcite for @xmath1 .",
    "a cosmological constant ( of either sign ) obviously breaks scale - invariance , but one would expect it to become negligible in regions of sufficiently large curvature , and hence in the regime where type",
    "ii critical phenomena are seen .",
    "indeed this seems to be the case in 3 + 1 and higher dimensions .",
    "a further effect of a negative cosmological constant is to replace asymptotic flatness with asymptotically anti - desitter ( ads ) boundary conditions .",
    "the only boundary conditions for a massless scalar field compatible with the einstein equations are totally reflecting . as a consequence",
    ", it appears that arbitrarily weak generic initial data collapse after sufficiently many reflections off the boundary .",
    "( but see @xcite for exceptions to this ) . however , at the thresholds @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 for black hole formation after zero , one , two , and so on , reflections the same type ii critical phenomena are seen as in asymptotically flat spacetime . because of the reflecting boundaries , all the mass must fall into the black hole eventually , but the mass of the apparent horizon when it first forms does scale , with the same @xmath14 as the black hole mass in asymptotically flat spacetime .",
    "the situation is quite different in 2 + 1 dimensions .",
    "first , this is the critical dimension for the wave equation , meaning that the scalar field energy ( @xmath42 integrated over @xmath43 space dimensions ) is dimensionless .",
    "similarly , for gravity the black hole mass and the 2 + 1 dimensional equivalent of the hawking mass are dimensionless .",
    "this already indicates that any mass scaling can not be derived using the standard dimensional analysis argument . secondly ,",
    "in the absence of a cosmological constant there are no black hole solutions , and finite mass regular initial data can not form an apparent horizon dynamically .",
    "standard gauge choices in spherical symmetry in @xmath44 spacetime dimensions are polar - radial coordinates @xmath45 , @xmath46 where the area radius @xmath47 is a coordinate , and double null coordinates @xmath48 , @xmath49 where @xmath47 is a metric coefficient . with @xmath50 and @xmath51 , this can also be written as @xmath52 [ in @xmath8 dimensions , the same coordinate choices exist , with @xmath53 replaced by the line element on the unit @xmath54-sphere . ]    in 2 + 1 dimensions , the field equations @xmath55 , \\quad \\nabla^2\\phi=0\\ ] ] for the metric ( [ metricuvr ] ) are @xmath56 these are the field equations that we will use in the theory section  [ section : theory ] below .    in 2 + 1 dimensions , if @xmath30 , then from ( [ rbuveqn ] ) @xmath57 . in a region containing a regular centre",
    ", one can then make the same gauge choice @xmath58 as in flat spacetime .",
    "but , always in 2 + 1 dimensions , the coefficients of the spherical wave equation ( [ phiuveqn ] ) depend only on @xmath47 , not on @xmath59 , and so the matter evolution equation is not modified by curvature .",
    "this is one intuitive way of seeing why gravitational collapse can not occur in 2 + 1 with @xmath30 .",
    "however , in the presence of a negative cosmological constant @xmath60 black holes do exist in 2 + 1 spacetime dimension , and can be formed from regular data .",
    "these black holes are the btz solutions , which in polar - radial coordinates are given by @xmath61 although this looks similar to the schwarzschild - ads solution in higher dimensions , it is locally flat .",
    "this is because in 2 + 1 dimensions , the ricci tensor determines the weyl tensor , and so a vacuum region is not only ricci - flat but flat .",
    "the btz solution with @xmath62 is the @xmath44-dimensionsonal ads spacetime .",
    "all other btz solutions with @xmath63 have a naked conical singularity , while the btz solutions with @xmath64 are black hole solutions .",
    "this mass gap between the ground state and the smallest black hole is another feature of 2 + 1 dimensions .",
    "regular initial data with @xmath65 can not form a black hole ( although they can develop arbitrarily large curvature @xcite . )",
    "there seems to be a dilemma for type ii critical collapse : in order to form a black hole at all , a cosmological constant is needed , but for curvature and mass scaling to occur , it must be dynamically negligible .",
    "it is convenient to introduce the local mass function @xmath66 defined by @xmath67 this is the 2 + 1 dimensional equivalent of the hawking mass for spherical symmetry in 3 + 1 dimensions , and has similar properties : it is constant in vacuum , while in the presence of matter it increases with @xmath68 on any spacelike surface in regions where @xmath69 . a spherically symmetric marginally outer - trapped surface ( mots ) is given by @xmath70 , and so its mass is given by @xmath71 , as is the mass of the btz horizon .",
    "the first numerical simulations of critical collapse of a spherically symmmetric scalar field in 2 + 1 dimensions with a negative cosmological constant were carried out by pretorius and choptuik @xcite and husain and olivier @xcite .    in order to avoid the complications associated with the reflecting boundary conditions , pretorius and choptuik , like others in 3 + 1 and higher dimensions after them , focused on the scaling of maximum curvature and the mass of the apparent horizon when it first appears .",
    "they found that for each of several one - parameter families of initial data they examined , there was a @xmath38 such that the maximum of the ricci curvature scaled as ( [ ricciscaling ] ) where @xmath72 .",
    "they also gave evidence for a universal css critical solution .",
    "they claimed also that the apparent horizon mass at first appearance scales as @xmath73 with @xmath74 , although their figs .",
    "4 and 5 correctly suggest a mass scaling exponent somewhere between 0 and 1 .",
    "[ we use the terminology fmots for for `` first marginally outer trapped surface '' , as the terminology `` apparent horizon mass '' is ambiguous in this context ; see sec .",
    "[ section : massscaling ] below . ]",
    "their theoretical argument for @xmath74 is that the dimensionless mass @xmath75 and area radius @xmath68 of an apparent horizon are related by @xmath76 , and @xmath77 should scale as suggested by its dimension .",
    "we shall correct this argument in sec .",
    "[ section : deltaderivation ] .",
    "husain and olivier found apparent horizon mass scaling with @xmath78 , consistent with our results , but their data are fairly far from criticality .    on the grounds that @xmath79 should be dynamically negligible in critical collapse",
    ", garfinkle @xcite looked for exactly css solutions for @xmath30 that are analytic between the two values of @xmath36 corresponding to the centre and to the past lightcone of the accumulation point ( the standard procedure in higher dimensions ) . as we shall review in sec .",
    "[ section : garfinkle ] , he found a family of these parameterised by @xmath80 .",
    "the @xmath81 solution is the friedmann - robertson - walker solution . in hindsight",
    "it is surprising that these solutions exist , as we have seen that with @xmath30 gravity does not affect the scalar field and so can not regularise it , something that is essential for the existence of regular css solutions in higher dimensions .",
    "the garfinkle solution is also in closed form , whereas critical solutions for spherical massless scalar field collapse in higher dimensions can only be constructed numerically ( but see @xcite for an existence proof of the choptuik critical solution in 3 + 1 dimensions ) .",
    "garfinkle @xcite noted that the @xmath0 solution showed good agreement with the numerical data of pretorius and choptuik inside the lightcone .",
    "however , the lightcone is also an apparent horizon , whereas the critical solution in higher dimensions has no trapped surfaces .",
    "furthermore , the analytic continuation of the garfinkle solution through the lightcone has a spacelike central curvature singularity , for all @xmath82 .",
    "this means that it is the css equivalent of a black hole , rather than a critical solution .",

    "[ section : garfinklepert ] , they found that the garfinkle solution with parameter @xmath82 has @xmath83 unstable modes .",

    "there are the twin complications that a scalar wave that disperses initially can collapse after one or more reflections at the outer boundary , and that more scalar field can fall into an initially small black hole after reflection .",

    "three clear observations in near - critical evolutions of generic initial data were that the critical solution outside the lightcone appears to have @xmath340 , @xmath342 and @xmath612 .",
    "as we have seen , these are exact properties of the null continuation , but the null continuation is a solution only for @xmath30 .",

    "<S> this approximation is only @xmath2 at the lightcone and has three growing modes . </S>",
    "<S> we _ conjecture _ that pointwise it is a good approximation to a yet unknown true critical solution that is analytic with only one growing mode ( itself approximated by the top mode of our amended garfinkle solution ) . with this conjecture </S>",
    "<S> , we predict a ricci - scaling exponent of @xmath3 and a mass - scaling exponent of @xmath4 , compatible with our numerical experiments . </S>"
