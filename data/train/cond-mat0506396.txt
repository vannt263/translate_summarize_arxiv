    "the phenomenon of unconventional cooper pairing of fermions , i.e. , the formation of cooper pairs with nonzero angular momentum was theoretically predicted  @xcite in 1959 as a mechanism of superfluidity in fermi liquids . in 1972 the same phenomenon - unconventional superfluidity due to a @xmath1-wave ( spin triplet ) cooper pairing of  @xmath2he atoms ,",
    "was experimentally discovered in the mk range of temperatures ; for details and theoretical description see refs .",
    "note that , in contrast to the standard @xmath3-wave pairing in usual ( conventional ) superconductors where the electron pairs are formed by an attractive electron - electron interaction due to a virtual phonon exchange , the widely accepted mechanism of the cooper pairing in superfluid @xmath2he is based on an attractive interaction between the fermions ( @xmath2he atoms ) as a result of a virtual exchange of spin fluctuations .",
    "certain spin fluctuation mechanisms of unconventional cooper pairing of electrons are assumed also for the discovered in 1979 heavy fermion superconductors ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) as well as for some classes of high - temperature superconductors ( see , e.g. , refs .  @xcite ) .",
    "the possible superconducting phases in unconventional superconductors are described in the framework of the general ginzburg - landau ( gl ) effective free energy functional  @xcite with the help of the symmetry groups theory .",
    "thus a variety of possible superconducting orderings were predicted for different crystal structures  @xcite .",
    "a detailed thermodynamic analysis  @xcite of the homogeneous ( meissner ) phases and a renormalization group investigation  @xcite of the superconducting phase transition up to the two - loop approximation have been also performed ( for a three - loop renormalization group analysis , see ref .",
    "@xcite ; for effects of magnetic fluctuations and disorder , see  @xcite ) .",
    "we shall essentially use these results in our present consideration .      in 2000",
    ", experiments  @xcite at low temperatures ( @xmath4 k ) and high pressure ( @xmath5 gpa ) demonstrated the existence of spin triplet superconducting states in the metallic compound uge@xmath0 .",
    "the superconductivity is triggered by the spontaneous magnetization of the ferromagnetic phase that occurs at much higher temperatures .",
    "it coexists with the superconducting phase in the whole domain of its existence below @xmath4 k ; see also experiments from refs .",
    "@xcite , and the discussion in ref .",
    "the same phenomenon of existence of superconductivity at low temperatures and high pressure in the domain of the @xmath6 phase diagram where the ferromagnetic order is present was observed in other ferromagnetic metallic compounds ( zrzn@xmath0  @xcite and urhge  @xcite ) soon after the discovery  @xcite of superconductivity in uge@xmath0 .    in superconducting ternary and chevrel compounds",
    "the influence of magnetic order on superconductivity is also substantial ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) but in the newly found ferromagnetic substances the phase transition temperature ( @xmath7 ) to the ferromagnetic state is much higher than the phase transition temperature ( @xmath8 from ferromagnetic to a mixed state of coexistence of ferromagnetism and superconductivity .",
    "for example , in uge@xmath0 , @xmath9 k while the critical temperature of the phase transition from paramagnetic to ferromagnetic state in the same material is @xmath10 k  @xcite .",
    "it can be assumed that in these substances the material parameter @xmath11 defined as the usual critical temperature of the second order phase transition from normal to uniform ( meissner ) supercondicting state in a zero external magnetic field is much lower than the phase transition temperature @xmath12 .",
    "the above mentioned experiments on the compounds  uge@xmath13 , urhge , and zrzn@xmath0 do not give any evidence for the existence of a standard normal - to - superconducting phase transition in a zero external magnetic field .",
    "it seems that the superconductivity in the metallic compounds mentioned above always coexists with the ferromagnetic order and is enhanced by it . in these systems , as claimed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the superconductivity probably arises from the same electrons that create the band magnetism and can be most naturally understood rather as a triplet than spin - singlet pairing phenomenon .",
    "metallic compounds uge@xmath13 , urhge , and zrzn@xmath0 , are itinerant ferromagnets .",
    "an unconventional superconductivity is also suggested  @xcite as a possible outcome of recent experiments in fe  @xcite , in which a superconducting phase has been discovered at temperatures below @xmath14 k and pressures between 15 and 30 gpa .",
    "there both vortex and meissner superconductivity phases  @xcite are found in the high - pressure crystal modification of fe with a hexagonal close - packed lattice for which the strong ferromagnetism of the usual bcc iron crystal probably disappears  @xcite .",
    "it can be hardly claimed that in hexagonal fe the ferromagnetism and superconductivity coexist but the clear evidence for a superconductivity is also a remarkable achievement .",
    "the reasonable question whether these examples of superconductivity and coexistence of superconductivity and ferromagnetism are bulk or surface effects can be stated .",
    "the earlier experiments performed before 2004 do not answer this question .",
    "recent experiments  @xcite show that surface superconductivity appears in zrzn@xmath0 and its presence depends essentially on the way of preparation of the sample .",
    "but in our study it is important that bulk superconductivity can be considered well established in this substance .",
    "the important point in all discussions of the interplay of superconductivity and ferromagnetism is that a small amount of magnetic impurities can destroy superconductivity in conventional ( @xmath3-wave ) superconductors by breaking up the ( @xmath3-wave ) electron pairs with opposite spins ( paramagnetic impurity effect  @xcite ) . in this aspect the phenomenological arguments  @xcite and",
    "the conclusions on the basis of the microscopic theory of magnetic impurities in @xmath3-wave superconductors  @xcite are in a complete agreement with each other ; see , e.g. , refs .  @xcite .",
    "in fact , a total suppression of conventional ( @xmath3-wave ) superconductivity should occur in the presence of an uniform spontaneous magnetization @xmath15 , i.e. , in a standard ferromagnetic phase  @xcite .",
    "the physical reason for this suppression is the same as in the case of magnetic impurities , namely , the opposite electron spins in the @xmath3-wave cooper pair turn over along the vector @xmath15 in order to lower their zeeman energy and , hence , the pairs break down .",
    "therefore , the ferromagnetic order can hardly coexist with conventional superconducting states .",
    "especially , this is valid for the coexistence of uniform superconducting and ferromagnetic states where the superconducting order parameter @xmath16 and the magnetization @xmath15 do not depend on the spatial vector @xmath17 .",
    "but yet a coexistence of @xmath3-wave superconductivity and ferromagnetism may appear in uncommon materials and under quite special circumstances .",
    "furthermore , let us emphasize that the conditions for the coexistence of nonuniform ( `` vertex '' , `` spiral '' , `` spin - sinosoidal '' or `` helical ''  @xcite ) superconducting and ferromagnetic states are less restrictive than those for the coexistence of uniform superconducting and ferromagnetic orders",
    ". coexistence of nonuniform phases has been discussed in details , both experiment and theory , in ternary and chevrel - phase compounds where such a coexistence seems quite likely ; for a comprehensive review , see , for example , refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "in fact the only two superconducting systems for which the experimental data allow assumptions in a favor of a coexistence of superconductivity and ferromagnetism are the rare earth ternary boride compound errh@xmath18b@xmath18 and the chervel phase compound homo@xmath19s@xmath20 ; for a more extended review , see refs .  @xcite",
    "in these compounds the phase of coexistence appears in a very narrow temperature region just below the curie temperature @xmath7 of the ferromagnetic phase transition . at lower temperatures the magnetic moments of the rare earth 4@xmath21",
    "electrons become better aligned , the magnetization increases and the @xmath3-wave superconductivity pairs formed by the conduction electrons disintegrate",
    ".      we shall not consider all important aspects of the long standing problem of coexistence of superconductivity and ferromagnetism rather we shall concentrate our attention on the description of the newly discovered coexistence of ferromagnetism and unconventional ( spin - triplet ) superconductivity in the itinerant ferromagnets uge@xmath0 , zrzn@xmath0 , and urhge . here",
    "we wish to emphasize that the main object of our discussion is the superconductivity of these compounds and at a second place in the rate of importance we put the problem of coexistence .",
    "the reason is that the existence of superconductivity in itinerant ferromagnets is a highly nontrivial phenomenon . as noted in ref .",
    "@xcite the superconductivity in these materials appears to be difficult to explain in terms of previous theories  @xcite and requires new concepts to interpret the experimental data .",
    "we have already mentioned that in ternary compounds the ferromagtetism comes from the localized 4@xmath21 electrons while the s - wave cooper pairs are formed by conduction electrons . in uge@xmath0 and urhge the 5@xmath21 electrons of u atoms form both superconductivity and ferromagnetic order  @xcite . in zrzn@xmath0",
    "the same double role is played by the 4@xmath22 electrons of zr .",
    "therefore , the task is to describe this behavior of the band electrons at a microscopic level .",
    "one may speculate about a spin - fluctuation mediated unconventional cooper pairing as is in case of @xmath2he and heavy fermion superconductors .",
    "these important issues have not yet a reliable answer and for this reason we shall confine our consideration to a phenomenological level .    in fact , a number of reliable experimental data as the coherence length and the superconducting gap measurements  @xcite are in favor of the conclusion about a spin - triplet cooper pairing in these metallic compounds , although the mechanism of pairing remains unclear .",
    "we shall essentially use this reliable conclusion .",
    "this point of view is consistent with the experimental observation of coexistence of superconductivity only in a low temperature part of the ferromagnetic domain of the phase diagram ( @xmath23 ) , which means that a pure ( non - ferromagnetic ) superconducting phase is not observed , a circumstance , that is also in favor of the assumption of a spin - triplet superconductivity .",
    "our investigation leads to results which confirm this general picture .    on the basis of the experimental data and conclusions presented for the first time in refs .",
    "@xcite and shortly afterwards confirmed in refs .",
    "@xcite one may reliably accept that the superconductivity in these magnetic compounds is considerably enhanced by the ferromagnetic order parameter @xmath15 and , perhaps , it could not exist without this `` mechanism of ferromagnetic trigger , '' or , in short , `` @xmath15-trigger '' ; see refs .",
    "@xcite where this concept has been introduced for the first time .",
    "the trigger phenomenon is possible for spin - triplet cooper pairs where the electron spins point parallel to each other and their turn along the vector of the spontaneous magnetization @xmath15 does not produce a breakdown of the spin - triplet cooper pairs but rather stabilizes them and , perhaps , stimulates their creation .",
    "we shall describe this phenomenon at a phenomenological level .      a phenomenological theory that explains the coexistence of ferromagnetism and",
    "unconventional spin - triplet superconductivity of gl type has been developed recently in  @xcite where possible low - order couplings between the superconducting and ferromagnetic order parameters are derived with the help of general symmetry group arguments . on this basis",
    "several important features of the superconducting vortex state of unconventional ferromagnetic superconductors were demonstrated  @xcite .    in our review",
    "we shall follow the approach from refs .",
    "@xcite to investigate the conditions for the occurrence of the meissner phase and to demonstrate that the presence of ferromagnetic order enhances the @xmath1-wave superconductivity .",
    "we also establish the phase diagram of ferromagnetic superconductors in a zero external magnetic field and show that the phase transition to the superconducting state can be either of first or second order depending on the particular substance .",
    "we confirm the predictions made in refs .",
    "@xcite about the symmetry of the ordered phases .",
    "in our study we use the mean - field approximation  @xcite and known results about the possible phases in nonmagnetic superconductors with triplet ( @xmath1-wave ) pairing  @xcite .",
    "our results  @xcite show that taking into account the anisotropy of the spin - triplet cooper pairs modifies but does not drastically change the thermodynamic properties of the coexistence phase , especially in the temperature domain above the superconducting critical temperature @xmath11 .",
    "the effect of crystal anisotropy is similar but we shall not make an overall thermodynamic analysis of this problem because we have to consider concrete systems and crystal structures  @xcite for which there is no enough information from experiment to make conclusions about the parameters of the theory .",
    "our results confirm the general concept that the anisotropy reduces the degree of ground state degeneration , and depending on the symmetry of the crystal , picks up a crystal direction for the ordering .",
    "there exists a formal similarity between the phase diagram we obtain and the phase diagram of certain improper ferroelectrics  @xcite .",
    "we shall make use of the concept in the theory of improper ferroelectrics , where the trigger of the primary order parameter by a secondary order parameter ( the electric polarization ) has been initially introduced and exploited ; see ref .",

    "important conclusions about the shape of the @xmath6 diagram can be made from the form of the @xmath297 diagram without an additional information about the values of the relevant material parameters @xmath415 , @xmath416 ) and their dependence on the pressure @xmath71 .",
    "one should know also the characteristic temperature @xmath11 , which has a lower value than the experimentally observed  @xcite phase transition temperature @xmath417 to the coexistence fs  phase .",
    "a supposition about the dependence of the parameters @xmath70 and @xmath418 on the pressure @xmath71 was made in ref .",
    "our results for @xmath419 show that the phase transition temperature @xmath12 varies with the variation of the system parameters @xmath420 from values which are higher than the characteristic temperature @xmath11 down to zero temperature .",
    "this is seen from fig .",
    "5 .    in systems",
    "where a pure superconducting phase is not observed for temperatures @xmath421 or @xmath422 , we can set @xmath423 in eq .",
    "neglecting @xmath11 in eq .",
    "( 21 ) and assuming that @xmath424 we obtain that @xmath425 .",
    "note that the first @xmath426-correction to this result has a negative sign which means that a suitable dependence of the characteristic temperature @xmath427 on the pressure p may be used in attempts to describe the experimental shape of the fm - fs phase transition line in the @xmath6 diagrams of uge@xmath0 and zrzn@xmath0 ; see , for example , fig . 2 in ref .",
    "@xcite , fig . 3 in ref .",
    "@xcite , fig . 4 in ref .",
    "the experimental phase diagrams indicate that @xmath428 is a smooth monotonically decreasing function of the pressure @xmath71 and @xmath428 tends to zero when the pressure @xmath71 exceeds some critical value @xmath429 gpa . postulating the respective experimental shape of the function @xmath428 one may try to give a theoretical prediction for the shape of the curve @xmath430 .",
    "the lack of experimental data about important parameters of the theory forces us to make some suppositions about the behavior of the function @xmath431 .",
    "the phase transition temperature @xmath430 will qualitatively follow the shape of @xmath428 provided the dependence @xmath431 is very smooth .",
    "this is in accord with the experimental shapes of these curves near the critical pressure @xmath432 where both @xmath7 and @xmath430 are very small .",
    "the substantial difference between @xmath7 and @xmath430 at lower pressure ( @xmath433 ) can be explained with the negative sign of the correction term to the leading dependence @xmath434^{1/2}$ ] mentioned above and a convenient supposition for the form of the function @xmath431 .",
    "( 21 ) presents a rather simplified theoretical result for @xmath435 because the effect of @xmath436 coupling is not taken into account .",
    "but following the same ideas , used in our discussion of eq .  (",
    "21 ) , a more reliable theoretical prediction of the shape of fm - fs phase transition line can be given on the basis of eq .",
    "( 23 ) . with the help of the experimentally found shape of @xmath428 and the definition of the parameters @xmath226 and @xmath216 by eq .  ( 11 ) we can substitute @xmath437 in eq .",
    "( 23 ) . in doing this",
    "we have applied the following approximations , namely , that @xmath423 for any pressure @xmath71 , @xmath438 and for substantially lower pressure ( @xmath433 ) , @xmath439 .",
    "then near the critical pressure @xmath432 , we easily obtain the transition temperature @xmath440 , as should be . for substantially lower values of the pressure there exists an experimental requirement @xmath441 . using the latter",
    "we establish the approximate formula @xmath442 the same formula for @xmath443 can be obtained from the parameter @xmath444 given by eq .",
    "the pressure dependence of the parameters included in this formula defines two qualitatively different types of behavior of @xmath445 at relatively low pressures ( @xmath446 ) : ( a ) @xmath447 below some ( second ) critical value of the pressure ( @xmath448 ) , and ( b ) finite @xmath445 up to @xmath449 .",
    "therefore , we can estimate the value of the pressure @xmath448 in uge@xmath0 , where @xmath450",
    ". it can be obtained from the equation @xmath451 provided the pressure dependence of the respective material parameters is known .",
    "so , the above consideration is consistent with the theoretical prediction that the dashed line in fig .",
    "5 crosses the axis @xmath258 and for this reason we have the opportunity to describe two ordered phases at low temperatures and broad variations of the pressure .",
    "our theory allows also a description of the shape of the transition line @xmath445 in zrzn@xmath0 and urhge , where the transition temperature @xmath430 is finite at ambient pressure . to avoid a misunderstanding ,",
    "let us note that the diagram in fig .",
    "5 is quite general and the domain containing the point @xmath258 of the phase transition line for negative @xmath216 may not be permitted in some ferromagnetic compounds .    up to now",
    "we have discussed experimental curves of second order phase transitions .",
    "our analysis gives the opportunity to describe also first order phase transition lines .",
    "our investigation of the free energy ( 12 ) leads to the prediction of triple ( @xmath391 ) and tricritical points ( @xmath452 and @xmath398 ) ; see figs . 3 and 5 .",
    "we shall not consider the possible application of these results to the phase diagrams of real substances , for which first order phase transitions and multicritical phenomena occur ; see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite , where first order phase transitions and tricritical points have been observed .",
    "the explanation of the phase transition lines in refs .",
    "@xcite requires further theoretical studies that can be done on the basis of a convenient extension of the free energy ( 12 ) .",
    "for example , the investigation of vortex phases in ref .",
    "@xcite requires to take into account the gradient terms ( 4 ) .",
    "another generalization should be done in order to explain the observation of two fm phases  @xcite .",
    "note , that the experimentalists are not completely certain whether the fs phase is a uniform or a vortex phase , and this is a crucial point for the further investigations .",
    "but we find quite encouraging that our studies naturally lead to the prediction of the same variety of phase transition lines and multicritial points that has been observed in recent experiments  @xcite .",
    "our analysis demonstrates that when the anisotropy of cooper pairs is taken into account , there will be no drastic changes in the shape the phase diagram for @xmath171 and the order of the respective phase transitions .",
    "of course , there will be some changes in the size of the phase domains and the formulae for the thermodynamic quantities .",
    "it is readily seen from figs .  6 and 7 that the temperature domain of first order phase transitions and the temperature domain of stability of fs above @xmath11 essentially vary with the variations of the anisotropy parameter @xmath453 .",
    "the parameter @xmath453 will also insert changes in the values of the thermodynamic quantities like the magnetic susceptibility and the entropy and specific heat jumps at the phase transition points .",
    "besides , and this seems to be the main anisotropy effect , the @xmath453- and @xmath454-terms in the free energy lead to a stabilization of the order along the main crystal directions which , in other words , means that the degeneration of the possible ground states ( fm , sc , and fs ) is considerably reduced .",
    "this means also a smaller number of marginally stable states .",
    "the dimensionless anisotropy parameter @xmath455 can be either positive or negative depending on the sign of @xmath456 . obviously when @xmath457 , the parameter @xmath453 will be positive too and will be in the interval @xmath458 w@xmath459 to ensure the positiveness of parameter @xmath460 from eq .",
    "when @xmath461 , the latter condition is obeyed if the original parameters of free energy ( 3 ) satisfy the inequality @xmath462 .",
    "we should mention here that a new phase of coexistence of superconductivity and ferromagnetism occurs as a solution of eqs .",
    "it is defined in the following way : @xmath463,\\ ] ] @xmath464,\\ ] ] and @xmath465 in the present approximation the phase  ( 42 ) - ( 44 ) is unstable , but this may be changed when the crystal anisotropy is taken into account .",
    "we shall write the equations for order parameters @xmath162 and @xmath113 of fs phase in order to illustrate the changes when @xmath466 @xmath467 and @xmath468m\\pm \\frac{\\gamma r}{2}=0,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the meaning of the upper and lower sign is the same as explained just below eq .",
    "the difference in the stability conditions is more pronounced and gives new effects that will be explained further , @xmath469 @xmath470 and @xmath471    the calculations of the phase diagram in ( @xmath472 ) parameter space are done in the same way as in case of @xmath312 and show that for @xmath473 there is no qualitative change of the phase diagram .",
    "quantitatively , the region of first order phase transition widens both with respect to @xmath216 and @xmath226 as illustrated in fig .",
    "6 . on the contrary , when @xmath474 the first order phase transition region becomes more narrow but the condition  ( 47 ) limits the stability of fs for @xmath126 .",
    "this is seen from fig .",
    "7 where fs is stable above the straight dotted line for @xmath227 and @xmath170 .",
    "so , purely superconducting ( meissner ) phases occur also as ground states together with fs and fm phases .",
    "we investigated the m - trigger effect in unconventional ferromagnetic superconductors .",
    "this effect arises from the @xmath475-coupling term in the gl free energy and provokes the appearance of superconductivity in a domain of the system s phase diagram that is entirely occupied by the ferromagnetic phase .",
    "the coexistence of unconventional superconductivity and ferromagnetic order is possible for temperatures above and below the critical temperature @xmath11 , that corresponds to the standard second - order phase transition from normal to meissner phase  usual uniform superconductivity in a zero external magnetic field which occurs outside the domain of existence of ferromagnetic order .",
    "our investigation is mainly intended to clarify the thermodynamic behavior at temperatures @xmath476 where the superconductivity can not appear without the mechanism of m - triggering .",
    "we describe the possible ordered phases ( fm and fs ) in this most interesting temperature interval .",
    "the cooper pair and crystal anisotropies are investigated and their main effects on the thermodynamics of the triggered phase of coexistence is established . of course , in discussions of concrete real materials the respective crystal symmetry should be considered .",
    "but the low symmetry and low order ( in both @xmath162 and @xmath24 ) @xmath289-term in the free energy determines the leading features of the coexistence phase and the dependence of essential thermodynamic properties on the type of crystal symmetry is not so considerable .    below the superconducting critical temperature @xmath11 a variety of pure superconducting and mixed phases of coexistence of superconductivity and ferromagnetism exists and the thermodynamic behavior at these relatively low temperatures is more complex than in improper ferroelectrics .",
    "the case @xmath477 also needs a special investigation .",
    "our results are referred to the possible uniform superconducting and ferromagnetic states .",
    "vortex and other nonuniform phases need a separate study .",
    "the relation of the present investigation to properties of real ferromagnetic compounds , such as uge@xmath0 , urhge , and zrzn@xmath0 , has been discussed throughout the text . in these compounds",
    "the ferromagnetic critical temperature is much larger than the superconducting critical temperature @xmath478 and that is why the m - triggering of the spin - triplet superconductivity is very strong .",
    "moreover , the @xmath308-term is important to stabilize the fm order up to the absolute zero ( 0 k ) , as is in the known spin - triplet ferromagnetic superconductors .",
    "ignoring  @xcite the symmetry conserving @xmath308-term does not allow a proper description of the real substances of this type .",
    "more experimental information about the values of the material parameters ( @xmath479 ) included in the free energy ( 12 ) is required in order to outline the thermodynamic behavior and the phase diagram in terms of thermodynamic parameters @xmath78 and @xmath71 .",
    "in particular , a reliable knowledge about the dependence of the parameters @xmath70 and @xmath418 on the pressure @xmath71 , the value of the characteristic temperature @xmath11 and the ratio @xmath480 at zero temperature are of primary interest .",
