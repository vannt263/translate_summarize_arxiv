    "black holes are amongst the most striking predictions of einstein s theory of general relativity",
    ". one of the most important effects of the black hole is its tendency to accrete , and hence several aspects of the spherical accretion onto the black hole have been actively investigated in detail over the last four decades ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "accretion is the term used by astrophysicists to describe the inflow of matter towards a central gravitating object or towards the center of the mass of an extended system .",
    "it may be pointed that accretion of matter onto black holes is one of the most promising ideas explaining the highly luminous active galactic nuclei ( agns ) and quasars .",
    "the first study of spherical accretion onto compact objects dates back more than forty years in the seminal paper due to bondi @xcite . in this classic work",
    ", the hydrodynamics of polytropic flow is studied within the newtonian framework , and it is found that either a settling or transonic solution is mathematically possible for the gas accreting onto compact objects . note that the accretion rate is highest for the transonic solution .",
    "the relativistic version of the same problem was solved by michel @xcite twenty years later .",
    "michel @xcite investigated the steady state spherically symmetric flow of a test gas onto a schwarzschild black hole in the framework of general relativity .",
    "he showed that accretion onto the black hole should be transonic .",
    "michel s relativistic results attracted several researchers @xcite .",
    "spherical accretion and winds in the context of general relativity have also been analyzed using equations of state other than the polytrope .",
    "other extensive studies include the calculation of the frequency and luminosity spectra @xcite , the influence of an interstellar magnetic field in ionized gases @xcite , and the changes in accreting processes when the black hole rotates @xcite .",
    "several radiative processes have been included by blumenthal and mathews @xcite , and brinkmann @xcite .",
    "in addition malec @xcite considered general relativistic spherical accretion with and without back - reaction , and showed that relativistic effects increase mass accretion when back - reaction is absent .",
    "accretion of a perfect fluid with a general equation of state onto a schwarzschild black hole has been investigated in @xcite , and a similar analysis for a charged black hole has been done in @xcite .",
    "accretion processes related to a charged black hole were analyzed in @xcite and investigated further in @xcite .",
    "the main aim of these studies is to obtain the net energy output emitted by infalling gas with application of black hole accretion to several classes of astrophysical sources .",
    "it is understood that accretion onto a black hole might be an important source of radiant energy .",
    "this may be related to the accretion rate @xmath2 , and we may expect that an increase in @xmath2 should lead to an increase in the luminosity @xcite . in this paper , we consider the steady state spherical accretion onto a black hole that has a cloud of strings in the background .",
    "we thereby generalize the previous work of michel @xcite .",
    "it may be noted that the study of einstein s equations coupled with a _ string cloud _ may be very important as the relativistic strings at a classical level can be used to construct applicable models @xcite .",
    "also , the universe can be represented as a collection of extended ( nonpoint ) objects and 1-dimensional strings are the most popular candidate for such fundamental objects . hence the study of the gravitational effects of matter , in the form of clouds of both cosmic and fundamental strings , has generated considerable attention @xcite .",
    "cosmic strings are a generic outcome of symmetry - breaking phase transitions in the early universe @xcite , and further motivation comes from a potential role in large scale structure formation @xcite .",
    "strings may have been present in the early universe , and they play a role in the seeding of density inhomogeneities @xcite .",
    "the magnitude of such strings are determined by the dimensionless parameter @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the energy scale of string and @xmath8 is the planck mass . for the nambu - goto string model , using the planck data , it has been shown that a constraint on the string tension of @xmath9 at @xmath10 percent confidence that can be improved to @xmath11 on inclusion of high-@xmath12 cmb data @xcite .    it may be also pointed out that strings have become a very important ingredient in many physical theories , and",
    "the idea of strings is fundamental in superstring theories @xcite .",
    "the apparent relationship between counting string states and the entropy of the black hole horizon @xcite suggests an association of strings with black holes .",
    "furthermore the intense level of activity in string theory has lead to the idea that many of the classic vacuum scenarios , such as the static schwarzschild point black hole , may have atmospheres composed of a fluid or field of strings @xcite .",
    "many authors have found exact black hole solutions with string cloud backgrounds , for instance , in general relativity @xcite , in einstein - gauss - bonnet models @xcite , and in lovelock gravity @xcite , thereby generalizing the pioneering work of letelier @xcite who modified the schwarzschild black hole for the string cloud model .",
    "glass and krisch @xcite pointed out that allowing the schwarzschild mass parameter to be a function of radial position creates an atmosphere with a string fluid stress - energy tensor around a static , spherically symmetric object .",
    "interestingly , it turns out that the mass accretion rate @xmath2 increases with the string cloud as a background in comparison to the standard black hole .",
    "also note that the mass accretion rate is affected by the presence of higher dimensions @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii we review the action , the energy momentum tensor for a cloud of strings , and the corresponding black hole solution . in sec .",
    "iii the analytic general relativistic accretion onto a schwarzschild black hole is appropriately generalized to model spherical steady state accretion onto a black hole surrounded by a cloud of strings .",
    "we calculate how the presence of a string cloud would affect the mass accretion rate @xmath2 of a gas onto a black hole .",
    "we also determine analytic corrections to the critical radius , the critical fluid velocity and the sound speed , and subsequently to the mass accretion rate .",
    "we then obtain expressions for the asymptotic behavior of the fluid density and the temperature near the event horizon in sect .",
    "finally we conclude in sec .",
    "v.    we use the following values for the physical constants for numerical computations and plots : @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 .",
    "in this model , we assume a spherically symmetric metric , and steady state flow onto a nonrotating black hole of mass @xmath4 at rest . recall that the non - relativistic model was discussed by bondi @xcite , and the standard 4-dimensional general relativistic version was developed by michel @xcite .",
    "the known analytic relativistic accretion solution onto the schwarzschild black hole by michel @xcite is generalized by considering a cloud of strings in the background . to achieve this",
    ", we first briefly review the theory on a cloud of strings ( see @xcite for further details ) and the corresponding modified schwarzschild black hole .",
    "the nambu - goto action of a string evolving in spacetime is given by @xmath20 where @xmath21 is a positive constant that characterizes each string , @xmath22 is a parametrization of the world sheet @xmath23 with @xmath24 and @xmath25 being timelike and spacelike parameters @xcite , and @xmath26 is the determinant of the induced metric on the string world sheet @xmath23 given by @xmath27 and @xmath28 = det @xmath29 .",
    "associated with the string worldsheet we have the bivector of the form @xmath30 where @xmath31 denotes the two - dimensional levi - civita tensor given by @xmath32 . within this setup ,",
    "the lagrangian density becomes @xmath33^{1/2}.\\ ] ] further , since @xmath34 , we obtain the energy momentum tensor for one string as @xmath35 hence , the energy momentum tensor for a cloud of string is @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the proper density of a string cloud .",
    "the quantity @xmath38 is the gauge invariant quantity called the gauge - invariant density .",
    "the general solution of einstein s equations for a string cloud in 4-dimensions takes the form @xmath39 where we have set @xmath40 in this paper . here",
    "@xmath4 arises as an integration constant which is identified as the black hole mass and is not a function of @xmath5 .",
    "the event horizon for the metric ( [ stringmetric ] ) has radius @xmath41 in the limit @xmath42 , we recover the schwarzschild radius , and close to unity the event horizon radius tends to infinity . in general the string cloud parameter @xmath43 .",
    "we note that the case of static spherical symmetry restricts the value of the gauge - invariant density to @xmath44 @xcite , and thereby @xmath5 is a positive constant .",
    "however , for the realistic model under consideration here the string cloud parameter is restricted to @xmath45 . on the other hand , the cloud of strings alone ( @xmath46 ) does not have a horizon ; it generates only a naked singularity at @xmath47 .",
    "this solution was first obtained by letelier @xcite and the metric represents the black hole spacetime associated with a spherical mass @xmath4 centered at the origin of the system of coordinates , surrounded by a spherical cloud of strings . furthermore it can be interpreted as the metric associated with a global monopole . in the string cloud background , the schwarzschild radius of the black hole is displaced by the factor @xmath48 .",
    "we now present the basic relations in spherical symmetry with accreting matter , and describe the flow of gas into the modified schwarzschild black hole ( [ stringmetric ] ) .",
    "also we probe how the string cloud background affects the accretion rate @xmath2 , the asymptotic compression ratio , and the temperature profiles .",
    "we consider the steady state radial inflow of gas onto a central mass @xmath4 by following the approach of michel @xcite and shapiro @xcite .",
    "the gas is approximated as a perfect fluid described by the energy momentum tensor @xmath49 where @xmath37 and @xmath50 are the fluid proper energy density and pressure respectively , and @xmath51 is the fluid 4-velocity which obeys the normalization condition @xmath52 we also define the proper baryon number density @xmath53 , and the baryon number flux @xmath54 .",
    "all these quantities are measured in the local inertial rest frame of the fluid .",
    "the spacetime curvature is dominated by the compact object and we ignore the self - gravity of the fluid . the accretion process is based on two important conservation laws .",
    "firstly , if no particles are created or destroyed then particle number is conserved and @xmath55 secondly , the conservation law is that of energy momentum which is governed by @xmath56 the non - null components of the 4-velocity are @xmath57 and @xmath58 . since @xmath59 , and",
    "the velocity components vanish for @xmath60 , we have @xmath61^{1/2}.\\ ] ] equation ( [ baryoncons ] ) can be written as @xmath62 our assumptions of spherical symmetry and steady state flow make ( [ momencons ] ) comparatively easier to tackle .",
    "the @xmath63 component is @xmath64 = 0.\\ ] ] the @xmath65 component can be simplified to @xmath66 the above equations are generalization of the results obtained for the standard schwarzschild black hole @xcite .",
    "the accretion of matter onto black holes remains a classic problem of contemporary astrophysics , as it does on the related problems of active galactic nuclei and quasars , the mechanism of jets , and the nature of certain galactic x - ray source .",
    "let us consider spherical steady state accretion onto a schwarzschild black hole of mass @xmath4 in a string cloud background to obtain the mass accretion rate from a qualitative analysis of ( [ baryoncons1 ] ) and ( [ momencons1 ] ) .",
    "for an adiabatic fluid there is no entropy production and the conservation of mass - energy is governed by @xmath67 which may be put in the form @xmath68 we define the adiabatic sound speed @xmath69 via @xcite @xmath70 and we have used equation ( [ slaw1 ] ) . using ( [ soundspd ] ) , the baryon and momentum conservation equations can be written as @xmath71 with @xmath72 where a dash ( @xmath73 ) denotes a derivative with respect to @xmath74 . with the help of the above equations , we obtain the system @xmath75 where    [ def ] @xmath76 , \\\\ \\label{def:2 } n_2 & = \\frac{1}{v } \\left(\\frac{2v^2}{r } - \\frac{m}{r^2 }   \\right ) , \\\\",

    "the flow is subsonic i.e. @xmath77 and since the sound speed must be subluminal , i.e. , @xmath78 , we have @xmath79 . the denominator ( [ def:3 ] )",
    "is therefore @xmath80 and so @xmath81 as @xmath82 if we demand @xmath83 . at the event horizon @xmath84 , and we have @xmath85 under the causality constraint @xmath86 , we have @xmath87",
    ". therefore @xmath88 should pass through a critical point @xmath3 where it goes to zero .",
    "as the flow is assumed to be smooth everywhere , so @xmath89 should also vanish at @xmath3 , i.e. , to avoid discontinuities in the flow , we must have @xmath90 at the radius @xmath3 .",
    "this is nothing but the so - called _",
    "sonic condition_. hence , the flow must pass through a critical point outside the event horizon , i.e. , @xmath91 . at the critical point",
    "the system ( [ def ] ) satisfies the condition @xmath92 where @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "the quantities with a subscript @xmath95 are defined at the critical point or the sonic points of the flow .",
    "it can be clearly seen that the critical velocity in this model is modified by the factor @xmath96 , and the physically acceptable solution @xmath97 is ensured since @xmath98 .    to calculate the mass accretion rate , we integrate ( [ baryoncons1 ] ) over a 4-dimensional volume and",
    "multiply by @xmath99 , the mass of each baryon , to obtain @xmath100 where @xmath2 is an integration constant , independent of @xmath74 , having dimensions of mass per unit time .",
    "it is similar to the schwarzschild case .",
    "equations ( [ baryoncons1 ] ) and ( [ momencons0 ] ) can be combined to yield @xmath101 which is the modified relativistic bernoulli equation for the steady state accretion onto black holes surrounded by a cloud of strings .",
    "equations ( [ accrate ] ) and ( [ bernoulli ] ) are the basic equations that characterize accretion onto a black hole with parameter @xmath5 where we have ignored the back - reaction of matter . in the limit @xmath102",
    ", our results reduce to those obtained in @xcite for the standard schwarzschild black hole .      in order to calculate @xmath2 explicitly and all the fundamental characteristics of the flow ,",
    "( [ accrate ] ) and ( [ bernoulli ] ) must be supplemented with an equation of state which is a relation that characterizes the state of matter of the gas .",
    "following bondi @xcite and michel @xcite , we introduce a polytropic equation of state @xmath103 where @xmath104 and the adiabatic index @xmath105 are constants . on inserting ( [ eos ] ) into the energy equation ( [ secondlaw ] ) and integrating ,",
    "we obtain @xmath106 where @xmath107 is an integration constant obtained by matching with the total energy density equation @xmath108 , where @xmath109 is the rest - mass energy density of the baryons and @xmath110 is the internal energy density . equations ( [ eos ] ) and ( [ rho ] ) give @xmath111 using ( [ rho ] ) and ( [ inter ] ) we can easily rewrite the bernoulli equation ( [ bernoulli ] ) as @xmath112 at the critical radius @xmath3 , using the relation ( [ sonic ] ) and inverting the above equation , we get @xmath113 it must be noted that , in general , the bernoulli equation is modified due to a string cloud background . however at the critical radius , the form remains unchanged from the schwarzschild case @xcite .",
    "for large but finite values of @xmath74 , i.e. @xmath114 the baryons will be non - relativistic , i.e. , @xmath115 for neutral hydrogen . in this regime",
    "we should have @xmath116 .",
    "expanding ( [ berson ] ) up to second order in @xmath117 and @xmath118 , we obtain @xmath119 we thus obtain the critical radius @xmath3 in terms of the black hole mass @xmath4 and the boundary condition @xmath118 from ( [ sonic ] ) and ( [ sonsound ] ) : @xmath120 also , for @xmath121 , we get from ( [ inter ] ) @xmath122    we are now in a position to evaluate the accretion rate @xmath2 . since @xmath2 is independent of @xmath74 , ( [ accrate ] ) must also hold for @xmath123 .",
    "we use the critical point to determine the bondi accretion rate @xmath124 . by virtue of eqs .",

    "however , the accretion rate still scales as @xmath128 which is similar to that of the newtonian model @xcite as well as the relativistic case @xcite . in the limiting case @xmath102",
    ", we obtain the well known relations derived in @xcite for the schwarzschild black hole . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , we have plotted the logarithm of the accretion rate @xmath2 against the string cloud parameter @xmath5 for various polytropic indices @xmath105 . here @xmath2 is calculated in ergs / sec .",
    "we see that @xmath2 increases rapidly with increasing @xmath5 ( @xmath129 ) , and interestingly @xmath130 as @xmath131 .    [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "in the last section , we found that the accretion rate at some sonic point @xmath123 far away from event horizon , i.e. , @xmath132 is not influenced by nonlinear gravity .",
    "next we estimate the flow characteristics for @xmath133 and at the event horizon @xmath134 .      at distances below the bondi radius",
    "the gas is supersonic so that @xmath136 when @xmath135 . from ( [ ber1 ] )",
    "we find the upper bound on the radial dependence of the gas velocity @xmath137 we can now estimate the gas compression on these scales . with the help of ( [ accrate ] ) ,",

    "we have @xmath141 . as the flow is supersonic since we are well below the bondi radius , it is reasonable to assume that the fluid velocity is approximated by @xmath142 . at @xmath143 , @xmath144 ,",
    "i.e. , the flow speed at the horizon is always less than the speed of light .",
    "therefore , using the fact @xmath145 , we obtain the gas compression at the event horizon from ( [ gascomp ] ) : @xmath146 again assuming the presence of a maxwell - boltzmann gas , @xmath147 , we find the adiabatic temperature profile at the event horizon using ( [ temp ] ) and the horizon assumption : @xmath148^{\\gamma -1},\\ ] ] where , following @xcite , we have re - introduced the speed of light @xmath149 in the above expressions .",
    "the limit @xmath150 in the above equation gives us the corresponding result of accretion of the fluid onto the schwarzschild black hole @xcite .",
    "historically the accretion problem with a polytropic equation of state was addressed by bondi @xcite .",
    "he showed that subsonic flow far from a black hole will inevitably become supersonic , and that the requirement of a smooth traversal of the sonic surface uniquely specifies the accretion rate as a function of two thermodynamic variables , namely the density and temperature of the gas at infinity .",
    "the relativistic version of the same problem was solved by michel @xcite twenty years later , after the discovery of celestial x - ray sources .",
    "he showed that accretion onto the black hole should be transonic .",
    "accretion onto compact objects such as black holes and neutron stars is the most efficient method of releasing energy ; up to 40 percent of the rest - mass energy of the matter accreting on the black hole is liberated .",
    "recent developments in the theory of accretion are significant steps toward understanding various astronomical sources that are believed to be powered by the accretion onto black holes .",
    "spherical accretion onto a black hole is generally specified by the mass accretion rate @xmath2 which is a key parameter , and there is evidence that a higher accretion rate can provide higher luminosity values . in view of this , we analyzed the steady state and spherical accretion of a fluid onto the schwarzschild black hole in a string cloud background .",
    "we determined exact expressions for the mass accretion rate at the critical radius .",
    "it turns out that this quantity is modified so that @xmath151 with @xmath152 .",
    "thus the accretion rate by the black hole in a string cloud background is higher than that for a schwarzschild black hole .",
    "thus the parameter @xmath5 can be introduced in the problem of accretion onto black hole to extend the work of michel @xcite , and this quantity determines the accretion rate and other flow parameters . in principle , the accretion rate and other parameters still have same characteristics as in the schwarzschild black hole ; in this sense we may conclude that the familiar steady state spherical accretion solution onto the schwarzschild black hole is stable . in the limit @xmath42 , our results reduce exactly to those obtained in @xcite for the standard schwarzschild black hole .",
    "we can attempt to work out the effect of string cloud background on the luminosity , the frequency spectrum and the energy conversion efficiency of the accretion flow .",
    "it is possible to deviate from spherical symmetry , e.g. , include rotation , which may lead to a higher accretion rate .",
