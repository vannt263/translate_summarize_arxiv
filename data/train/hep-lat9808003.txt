    "@xmath26 is a critical exponent . for the @xmath27 model , where the @xmath2 transition is generally trusted , @xmath28 .",
    "on the other hand , renormalization group considerations and numerical evaluations of @xmath29 yield the bound @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "it is well known that in the @xmath0 model there is not a good numerical evidence of the onset of the asymptotic scaling regime . in  @xcite",
    "the authors find that in this model the numerical data for the ratio @xmath31 with @xmath28 can be well fitted with a constant , while the ratio @xmath32 is clearly decreasing .",

    "@xcite it has been shown however that @xmath31 is not constant . to do this , the 0loop symanzik improved action was numerically simulated at high statistics ( @xmath33 measurements ) , including corrections to asymptotic scaling up to 3 loops . in  @xcite we claimed that the discrepancy on the constancy of @xmath31 between  @xcite and  @xcite originates from the higher resolution of the data in  @xcite .",
    "arguments against these conclusions has been raised based on possible distorting effects of the antiferromagnetic coupling present in the improved action .",
    "here we want to perform an analogous study , at high statistics too , on the @xmath0 model with standard action where such a coupling is absent .    for completeness we will show the results for @xmath13 , @xmath14 and the @xmath32 ratio obtained from our data .",

    "although the present note is mainly concerned on the existence of a phase transition at a finite temperature , we give for completeness also the results for @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath32 .    by using eq .",

    "[ fig : figxi ] we plot with empty symbols the ratio @xmath45 versus @xmath19 , adding scaling corrections up to four loops  @xcite ( we have taken into account the corrections of  @xcite ) .",
    "it is apparent that we are not in an asymptotic scaling regime , although the non  universal scaling corrections provide a systematic improvement . in the best ( 4loop ) case",
    "the lack of asymptotic scaling is around @xmath46 .",
    "we have also used an effective scheme  @xcite defined by the perturbative expansion of the energy  eq .",

    "[ fig : figxi ] . here",
    "the lack of asymptotic scaling is still large : about 78% in the best case .    starting from eq .",

    "[ fig : figchi ] between the monte carlo result and the ( @xmath51 ) analytical prediction is similar to that of the correlation length in fig .",

    "here we see an excellent agreement between the monte carlo data at 4loops and the @xmath51 approximation .",
    "we do not know how good is the @xmath51 approximation to @xmath14 .",
    "therefore we avoid drawing optimistic conclusions about the approach to the asymptotic scaling regime in this case .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : figrpt ] we plot the logarithm of the ratio @xmath32 versus the logarithm of the correlation length . again",
    "the full ( open ) symbols correspond to the effective ( standard ) scheme .",
    "we see that data can not be considered constant , although corrective terms give a systematic improvement .",
    "we stress the fact that further corrections and further statistics do not worsen the results . from the larger @xmath19 and considering the errors coming altogether from the 234 loop corrections , we get @xmath54 which , by using eq .",
    "( [ eq : cxi ] ) , leads to the prediction @xmath55 .",
    "this value however must be regarded as an upper bound because data in fig .",
    "[ fig : figrpt ] are still descending .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : figrkt ] we plot the main result of the present paper : the ratio @xmath31 versus @xmath56 in a log  log scale . as it already happened for the symanzik action",
    ", the shape of the curve indicates a non - constant ratio , contradicting the claims of  @xcite .",
    "in calculating this figure we have omitted the power @xmath57 , see  eq .  ( [ eq : rkt ] ) .",
    "had the model to undergo a phase transition at finite coupling @xmath23 , the correlation length @xmath56 should behave like @xmath58 if we try to fit our data to such functional form we obtain very unstable results ( including more or less data points in the fit , the results for @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath23 vary strongly ) .",
    "the fit to the form eq .",
    "( [ eq : fxi ] ) is much more stable .",
    "this phenomenon has a simple interpretation : @xmath23 is so large that eq .",
    "( [ eq : xikt ] ) can be approximated to @xmath61 and therefore we are fitting actually the combination @xmath62 .",
    "if @xmath23 is so large and recalling that @xmath63 , then the power @xmath64 is almost constant within the narrow interval of our working @xmath19 s .",
    "this is why we omitted such a factor in the calculation of @xmath31 .",
    "notice that the shape of the curve for @xmath31 can be obtained by using the perturbative expressions in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : fxi],[eq : fchi ] ) . owing to the incomplete asymptotic scaling ,",
    "we obtain a 20% difference in the overall scale in the best case ( 4 loops and energy scheme ) .",
    "however the position of the minimum is well predicted : the perturbative expansion at 4 loops and energy scheme display a minimum at @xmath65 while the curve in fig .  4 has minimum at @xmath66 ( the error has been estimated by interpolating the top and bottom values of the error bars in the data of fig .",
    "the prediction of @xcite is that the @xmath3 model behaves like the @xmath27 model for @xmath67 .",
    "therefore the set of critical exponents of @xmath27 should also apply for @xmath0 .",
    "however one could imagine a set of slightly different exponents ( after all , the @xmath0 and @xmath27 models have different numbers of degrees of freedom ) .",
    "following this idea , we have made further fits on the data for @xmath56 to functional forms similar to eq .",
    "( [ eq : xikt ] ) but with other powers of @xmath68 . in all cases",
    "the only sensible conclusion was that @xmath23 is very large .",
    "one can also try other versions of the ratio @xmath31 by varying @xmath26 .",
    "the tendency is that for larger ( smaller ) @xmath26 the curve acquires a positive ( negative ) slope for all points .",
    "we could not find a value of @xmath26 for which the whole set of points in fig .",
    "[ fig : figrkt ] flattens out .",
    "we have done a monte carlo simulation for the standard action of the @xmath0 non  linear @xmath1model in 2-dimensions .",
    "we have improved the statistics with respect to previous work taking advantage of the recently calculated corrections to scaling  @xcite and energy  @xcite .",
    "we have tested the perturbation theory predictions in both the standard and effective schemes .    in figs .",
    "13 we have plotted our results for @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath32 as a function of @xmath19 .",
    "we see that the use of an effective scheme improves the asymptotic scaling in a sensible way . however , in the best case , we are still far from asymptotic scaling by roughly 10% .",
    "much closer approaches to the scaling region were obtained by using the symanzik action  @xcite .",
    "it is remarkable that in all cases , the 4loop correction in the effective scheme is negligible and that if we trust the @xmath49 estimate of @xmath14 then our data have reached the scaling regime after including 3 or 4 loops .    as for our main result , fig .",
    "[ fig : figrkt ] , it does not give any support to the @xmath2scenario .",
    "the plot has the same shape than for the symanzik action  @xcite and this indicates that distorting effects due to the antiferromagnetic coupling are quite unlikely .",
    "in fact , in  @xcite we worked with @xmath69 in order to avoid any strong coupling effect .",
    "as already shown in  @xcite , the ratio @xmath32 is not constant but further corrections straighten it .",
    "this tendency is not satisfied for the @xmath31 ratio if we increase the statistics . in conclusion ,",
    "we think that the main claim in  @xcite can not be maintained within the present status of numerical simulations because either @xmath23 is too large to see any effect of the @xmath2transition or even it is infinity .",
    "b.a . wishes to thank the theory group of the hacettepe university for their kind hospitality .",
    "to obtain the results displayed in figs .  13 , we have used the corrected values for the finite integrals published in  @xcite needed for the 4loop beta function .",
    "we notice that these corrected values do not change appreciably the results shown in  @xcite . for instance , for the @xmath70 model with standard action and energy scheme",
    "it was shown in  @xcite that @xmath44 differs from eq .",
    "( [ eq : cxi ] ) by 0.5% ; after the corrections of  @xcite this difference becomes 0.40.5% .",
