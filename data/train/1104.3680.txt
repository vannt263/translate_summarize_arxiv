    "it is generally agreed that estimating the number of bound states of the schrdinger equation is a problem of great practical importance . a substantial effort was devoted for evaluating the upper and lower limits on the number of bound states for a given central potential . v. bargmann @xcite and j. schwinger @xcite",
    "seem to be the first who tackled this problem .",
    "since then many authors have contributed to the study of this problem . among them",
    "we would like to refer to the works @xcite and to emphasize particularly the contribution of f. calogero and f. brau @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the current contribution is to present a systematic approach to the investigation of quantum states with zero energy .",
    "these transition states appear between the discrete part of the spectrum of negative energies and the continuum part of positive energies .",
    "we study transition states by solving the proper schrdinger equation for short range central potentials possessing specific sets of critical parameters . to this end , we develop two exact methods for solving the zero energy schrdinger equation , and for obtaining the values of the associated critical parameters .",
    "we apply these methods to find the critical parameters of an improtant class of central potentials including among others the gaussian and the yukawa interactions .",
    "a few examples of potentials admitting the analytic solutions for the transition states are exhibitted and the associated critical parameters are presented in analytic form .",
    "we provide numerical results in the form of tables of the critical parameters .",
    "these results enable one to obtain the exact number of bound states for these potentials without any additional computations .    analyzing our results",
    "we have observed the following universal properties of the solutions of the schrdinger equation with central potentials : ( a ) for a given orbital angular momentum quantum number @xmath0 the @xmath2 critical value of the universal parameter @xmath3 of any potential behaves as @xmath4 for large @xmath1 .",
    "( b ) for a given number @xmath1 of bound states the critical parameter @xmath3 grows as @xmath5 with increasing @xmath0 .",
    "both results can be explained with the help of the wkb approximation .",
    "( c ) the ordering of the energy levels with various @xmath6 depends on the potential singularity at the origin .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : shroedinger ] we briefly discuss the schrdinger equation and the properties of short range potentials .",
    "the asymptotic behavior of the solution at the origin and at infinity is discussed in sections [ sec : origin],[sec : asymptotic ] , respectively . in section [ sec : riccati ] we introduce a phase - kind equation for the transition states , and in section [ sec : wkb ] we describe the wkb approximations for calculation of the critical parameters .",
    "the analytic asymptotic expressions for the critical parameters are presented in section [ sec : asymptotics ] .",
    "numerical results and conclusions then follow in sections [ sec : results ] and [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "let us start this section with a quotation from section  18 in the landau & lifshitz textbook on quantum mechanics @xcite : _",
    "`` if the field diminishes as @xmath7 at infinity , with @xmath8 , then there are not levels of arbitrarily small negative energy .",
    "the discrete spectrum terminates at a level with a non - zero absolute value , so that the total number of levels is finite''_.    we notice , that the statement expounded in the first sentence of the above quotation is doubtful .",
    "it contradicts our practical experience and also section  133 of the same book @xcite .",
    "the conclusion made in the second sentence proves to be true .",
    "therefore , we shall consider central potentials @xmath9 satisfying the corresponding boundary condition at infinity : @xmath10 near the origin , the boundary condition for an _ attractive _ potential can be written in a similar form @xmath11 to avoid fall of a particle to the center @xcite (   18,35 ) .",
    "we shall consider the class of potentials which can be presented in the form : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the coupling constant which determines the strength of the interaction .",
    "note that according to condition ( [ 2 ] ) the power @xmath14 must satisfy the inequality @xmath15 where @xmath16 corresponds to the leading term in series expansion of function @xmath17 near the origin @xmath18 it should be realized that the definition ( [ 3 ] ) describes a wide class of potentials such as , e.g. , square well , exponential , hulthen , gaussian , yukawa , woods - saxon and many others .",
    "the radial part of the schrdinger equation for a single particle moving in a central potential field takes the form @xcite(32 ) : @xmath19 -\\dfrac{l(l+1)}{r^2 } \\right\\rbrace \\chi=0,\\ ] ] where @xmath20 is the reduced mass , and @xmath21 is the reduced radial part of the wave function for a stationary state with angular momentum @xmath0 and energy @xmath22 .",
    "changing the potential parameters the appearance of a new bound state is accompanied with a new solution of eq.([5 ] ) for @xmath23 . as we limit our discussion to potentials of the form ( [ 3 ] ) , we rewrite eq.([5 ] ) for zero energy in the form @xmath24   \\chi(r).\\ ] ] the scale transformation @xmath25 leads to the equation : @xmath26 \\overset{\\sim}{\\chi}(x).\\ ] ] it is seen that the potentials @xmath27 and @xmath28 have equivalent solutions of eq.([5 ] ) .",
    "thus , we are interested in solving the equation @xmath29 where @xmath30 @xmath31 now our choice of the form ( [ 3 ] ) for central potentials becomes clear .",
    "the solutions of eq.([8 ] ) for a given angular momentum quantum number @xmath0 depend effectively , ( see , e.g.,@xcite ) only on one parameter @xmath32 eq.([8 ] ) is a differential equation of a second order . in order to solve it",
    "both analytically and numerically one needs to know the behavior of its solution near the origin and at infinity .",
    "at first , let us consider the solution of eq.([8 ] ) near the origin . expanding the potential into a power series and keeping only the leading term we obtain @xmath33 \\chi(r),\\ ] ] where @xmath34 and @xmath35 is defined by eq.([3a ] ) .",
    "the particular solution of eq.([11 ] ) , satisfying the boundary condition @xmath36 has the form @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the bessel function of the first kind , and @xmath39 is an arbitrary constant . keeping the first two terms in the series expansion of the function ( [ 15 ] ) , one obtains @xmath40.\\ ] ] in general , for integer and half - integer @xmath35 the solution of eq.([8 ] ) satisfying the boundary condition ( [ 14 ] ) can be presented by the following infinite series @xmath41.\\ ] ] for integer @xmath35 all of the @xmath42-coefficients should be zero .",
    "it follows from eq.([16 ] ) that @xmath43 substituting the representation ( [ 17 ] ) into eq.([8 ] ) , and then equating the expansion coefficients of the same powers of @xmath44 for the left - hand ( lhs ) and right - hand sides ( rhs ) of eq.([8 ] ) , one can calculate any finite number of the subsequent coefficients @xmath45 and @xmath46 with @xmath47 .",
    "for an eigenfunction @xmath48 belonging to the discrete part of the spectrum , the integral @xmath49 , taken over all space , is finite .",
    "this certainly means that @xmath50 decreases quite rapidly , becoming zero at infinity .",
    "the motion of the system is limited to a finite range , and it is said to be in a bound state . for wave functions belonging to the continuous part of the spectrum , the integral @xmath49 diverges due to the fact that @xmath50 does not become zero at infinity ( or becomes zero insufficiently rapidly ) .    on the other hand @xcite (   18 ) ,",
    "the spectrum of negative eigenvalues of the energy is discrete , i.e. all states with @xmath51 in the field which vanishes at infinity are bound states .",
    "the positive eigenvalues @xmath52 , on the other hand , form a continuous spectrum .    in other words , for the bound states the eigenvalues of the energy @xmath51 , and the eigenfunctions must satisfy the boundary condition @xmath53 in contrary , for a free state that belongs to the continuous spectrum the energy eigenvalues @xmath52 and @xmath50 does not become zero at infinity ( or becomes zero insufficiently rapidly ) .    for the * transition states * with @xmath23 the asymptotic behavior ( @xmath54 ) of the eigenfunctions remains unclear .",
    "the important step is to realize that the * boundary condition * ( [ 20 ] ) * must be valid for the transition states * ( @xmath23 ) as well .",
    "thus , for these states @xmath50 achieves zero at infinity . however , we note that it may tend to zero too slowly to ensure the convergence of the integral @xmath49 .    in the following",
    "we shall rely on the boundary condition ( [ 20 ] ) for the transition states .",
    "for @xmath55 the asymptotic boundary condition ( [ 1 ] ) enables us to neglect the potential @xmath56 in eqs.([8])-([9a ] ) at large enough @xmath44 .",
    "the general solution of the resulting equation has a form @xmath57 where @xmath58 and @xmath59 are arbitrary constants . as @xmath60",
    ", one should put @xmath61 in order to satisfy the asymptotic condition ( [ 20 ] ) .",
    "thus , we get @xmath62 expressing the latter equation in the form @xmath63 , we obtain the following condition for the first derivative : @xmath64\\equiv   \\lim_{r\\rightarrow\\infty}\\left[lr^{l-1}\\chi_l(r)+r^l \\chi'_l(r ) \\right]=0.\\ ] ] it is clear that the asymptotic behavior of the solution @xmath65 of eq.([8 ] ) depends on the parameter @xmath66 of the effective potential ( [ 9 ] ) .",
    "thus , according to eq .",
    "( [ 23 ] ) , the solution @xmath67 of eq.([8 ] ) fulfills the asymptotic condition @xmath68=0\\ ] ] for the critical parameters @xmath69 . here",
    "@xmath1 is a number of zeros of the function @xmath70 for the given potential ( [ 9 ] ) .",
    "hence , by definition , if for a given @xmath0 the potential @xmath9 is characterized by the parameters meeting @xmath71 then the proper _ number of bound states _",
    "equals @xmath1 .",
    "the asymptotic condition ( [ 24 ] ) was derived assuming that the orbital quantum number @xmath55 .",
    "however , it is easy to show that eq.([24 ] ) preserves its validity also for @xmath72 . a typical graph of the function @xmath70 is presented in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] .",
    "the straightforward solution of the second order differential equation ( [ 8 ] ) with the boundary conditions ( [ 16 ] ) and ( [ 24 ] ) presents our * first method * for calculating the critical parameters @xmath73 of a given attractive potential ( [ 3 ] ) satisfying the boundary conditions ( [ 1 ] ) and ( [ 2 ] ) .",
    "this method is especially effective and accurate for small values of @xmath0 .",
    "for a few potentials , such as the exponential , the hulthen and the woods - saxon , one can derive analytical expressions for the critical parameters using this method ( see appendix ) . however , this is possible only for @xmath74-states ( @xmath72 ) , when eq.([8 ] ) with the potentials mentioned above has a general analytical solution .",
    "we are familiar with only one form of central potential which admits an analytical solution of eq.([8 ] ) for @xmath75 .",
    "it is a cut - off potential ( described in the appendix ) for which the finite square well potential presents its particular case .",
    "let us add one important comment .",
    "we refer to eq.([24 ] ) as the asymptotic behavior condition . however , the solution ( [ 21 ] ) , and therefore - condition ( [ 24 ] ) , correspond to the assumption that the potential @xmath9 is negligible in comparison with the centrifugal term @xmath76 . therefore , the condition ( [ 24 ] ) is applicable at a distance @xmath44 when the condition @xmath77 is satisfied .",
    "it was mentioned in the preceding section that the straightforward method for calculating the critical parameters of central potentials loses its accuracy with increasing angular momentum quantum number @xmath0 . in this section",
    "we propose another method for calculating these parameters .",
    "this method is based on the logarithmic derivative @xmath78 of the reduced radial wave function introduced earlier .",
    "the final equations are close to , but differ from the so called phase equations presented in @xcite .",
    "let us start with the trivial identity @xmath79 and transform the radial schrdinger equation ( [ 8 ] ) into a riccati type equation for the corresponding logarithmic derivative @xmath80 : @xmath81 the asymptotic behavior of the logarithmic derivative for @xmath55 @xmath82 follows from the asymptotic representation ( [ 22 ] ) .    to deduce the asymptotic behavior of the logarithmic derivative for the transition @xmath74-states ( @xmath72 )",
    "let us start with the fact that for this case the rhs of eq.([31 ] ) equals @xmath9 .",
    "let us then consider central potentials with the asymptotic behavior @xmath83 where @xmath84 according to the boundary condition ( [ 1 ] ) . the general solution of the proper schrdinger equation ( [ 8 ] ) has a form : @xmath85 , \\ ] ] with @xmath86 it is seen that for @xmath84 the argument of the bessel function goes to zero as @xmath54 .",
    "thus , using series expansion for the bessel functions , it is easy to show that one should put @xmath87 in order to satisfy the boundary condition ( [ 20 ] ) .",
    "taking then the logarithmic derivative for the resulting @xmath88 , and once more using a series expansion for the bessel functions , one obtains : @xmath89 it is clear that the asymptotic solution ( [ 34b ] ) of the riccati equation ( [ 31 ] ) for @xmath72 satisfies the following inequality : @xmath90 the asymptotic solution of the schrdinger equation ( [ 8 ] ) with the exponential potential is presented in the appendix ( see eq.([a12a ] ) ) for @xmath72 .",
    "the corresponding logarithmic derivative @xmath91 satisfies the inequality ( [ 34c ] ) .",
    "it is easy to show that the asymptotic representation ( @xmath54 ) of the hulthen and the woods - saxon potentials reduces to the exponential forms @xmath92 and @xmath93 , respectively .",
    "hence , the asymptotic solution of the corresponding eq.([31 ] ) can be presented by the rhs of eq.([34d ] ) for the hulthen potential , and by @xmath94 for the woods - saxon potential .",
    "the latter logarithmic derivatives certainly obey the inequality ( [ 34c ] ) as well .",
    "it is reasonable to suggest that inequality ( [ 34c ] ) is valid for all of the short range potentials ( may be excluding only the cut - off potentials ) . in this case",
    ", one can neglect the square of the logarithmic derivative in the lhs of eq.([31 ] ) .",
    "the solution of the latter equation with @xmath72 can be obtained then in the explicit form @xmath95 for potentials with the asymptotic behavior ( [ 33 ] ) , formula ( [ 35 ] ) gives the asymptotic representation ( [ 34b ] ) . for the exponential potential , the rhs of eq.([35 ] )",
    "leads to ( [ 34d ] ) .    for the yukawa and gaussian potentials eq.([35 ] )",
    "yields : @xmath96 for deriving the latter expressions we used the leading terms of the asymptotic expansions of the incomplete gamma function @xmath97 and the complementary error function erfc@xmath98 obtained as the results of integration in eq.([35 ] ) .",
    "it is easy to check that the asymptotic logarithmic derivatives ( [ 36 ] ) satisfy the inequality ( [ 34c ] ) .",
    "it is seen from eq.([41 ] ) that the stabilizing function @xmath115 can be applicable only in case of its nodeless character , otherwise , the simplest choice is @xmath117 .",
    "the technique described above in this section is sufficient for presentation of the * second method * for calculating the critical parameters of central potentials of the from ( [ 3 ] ) .",
    "however , we would like to make some additional remarks that can be useful .",
    "eqs.([41 ] ) , ( [ 42 ] ) , along with the boundary condition ( [ 43])-([44 ] ) , provide a stable and accurate solution to the problem of critical potentials for both small and large values of @xmath0 .    a typical graph of function @xmath118 has a staircase form .",
    "it is presented in fig.[f2 ] .",
    "the abscissas of the points of the staircase function intersections with lines @xmath119 give the desired critical parameters @xmath120 .    as an additional useful information",
    "it can be shown that @xmath121 this is because of the following .",
    "setting @xmath122 , the second term disappears from the rhs of eq.([41 ] ) .",
    "the analytic solution to the resultant equation has a form : @xmath123 condition ( [ 1 ] ) thus provides @xmath124 for @xmath122 and @xmath72 according to eq.([46 ] ) .",
    "putting @xmath122 in eq.([42 ] ) , the latter loses the term with @xmath125 .",
    "the resultant equation has analytic solution of the form : @xmath126 for arbitrary finite real @xmath127 , @xmath128 presented in eq.([47 ] ) approaches 1 as @xmath129 .",
    "the resultant expression thus reduces to @xmath130 .",
    "in this section we apply the first - order and the second - order wkb approaches to calculating the critical parameters of central potentials . unlike the exact methods presented earlier these methods are certainly approximate but they are also much simpler .",
    "specific modification of the first - order wkb approach presented below can not provide results of high precision .",
    "however , its accuracy grows rapidly with increasing the number @xmath1 of bound states .",
    "it is important to note that this method can be applied to transition states with any orbital quantum number @xmath131 .",
    "the accuracy of the second - order wkb method grows with increasing @xmath0 .",
    "for example , the relative error for @xmath132 can be less than @xmath133 .",
    "this enables one to test the results obtained by the phase kind method ( sec.[sec : riccati ] ) for large @xmath0 . on the other hand",
    ", this method can be used by itself if a very high accuracy is not needed .",
    "the disadvantage of this method is its inapplicability for the transition @xmath74-states ( @xmath72 ) .",
    "a modification of the first - order wkb method , where the centrifugal potential is excluded from the quasiclassical momentum @xcite , can be applied for calculating the critical parameters under consideration . according to this approach",
    ", the quantization condition for the transition states ( @xmath23 ) reduces to : @xmath146 where @xmath147 in accordance to its definition ( [ 3a ] ) , the parameter @xmath35 is ruled by the behavior of the central potential near the origin .",
    "the cut - off potential ( [ a1 ] ) presents an exclusion .",
    "the exact analytic solution for this case is presented in the appendix .",
    "it was shown in the previous sections that in general the critical parameters for central potentials can be calculated numerically .",
    "for a few special cases , presented in the appendix , one can deduce the analytical results .",
    "in this section it will be shown that it is possible to derive the analytical expressions for the asymptotic form of the critical parameters @xmath148 . in so doing ,",
    "asymptotic implies a situation where either the number of bound states @xmath1 approaches infinity for a given finite @xmath0 , or the orbital angular momentum quantum number @xmath0 goes to infinity for a given finite @xmath1 .",
    "the first order wkb approach is applied to solve this problem .",
    "first , let us consider the case of finite @xmath1 where @xmath149 .",
    "numerical calculations demonstrate that the distance between turning points @xmath150 reaches zero as @xmath0 approaches infinity .",
    "this result can be explained and supported by the following arguments . according to eqs.([wkb ] ) , ( [ 49 ] ) the standard bohr - sommerfeld quantization condition for the transition states reads @xmath151 this means that the effective potential @xmath108 must be negative in the range @xmath152 $ ] .",
    "hence , according to eq.([9 ] ) the critical parameter @xmath66 must tend to infinity as @xmath5 or faster for @xmath153 .",
    "the latter in turn implies that the integrand in the lhs of eq.([56 ] ) approaches infinity as @xmath153 , whereas the rhs of eq.([56 ] ) remains finite .",
    "the above contradiction can be eliminated only by setting @xmath154 for the limits of integration , which proves the statement .",
    "it is clear that the point @xmath155 of minimum of the effective potential @xmath108 is localized in the region @xmath152 $ ] , that is @xmath156 therefore , for @xmath0 approaches infinity @xmath155 tends to the point where the turning points @xmath137 and @xmath138 merge .",
    "hence , in order to calculate @xmath157 it is enough to solve the following set of equations : @xmath158 substituting the explicit form ( [ 9 ] ) into ( [ 60 ] ) and eliminating @xmath66 and @xmath0 , one obtains the following simple equation for @xmath159 : @xmath160 now , any of the two equations ( [ 60 ] ) gives the required asymptotic expression : @xmath161 with @xmath162    .the asymptotic representations of critical parameters @xmath163 and   + @xmath164 .",
    "the numerical results for @xmath165 and   + @xmath166 are presented for comparison .

    "it is seen from this table that the values of @xmath169 are very close to the values of @xmath170 for the lowest ( nodeless ) energy states ( @xmath171 ) and @xmath172 .",
    "it is worth noting that even though the yukawa and gaussian potentials are very different , their asymptotic behaviors are coincident ( @xmath173 ) .    notice that a set of equations ( [ 60 ] ) for calculating @xmath159 can not be applied to the cut - off potential ( [ a1 ] ) .",
    "the correct result ( [ a14 ] ) can be obtained by setting @xmath174 , that is by equating the merging point @xmath159 and the matching point @xmath175 .",
    "now let us consider the case of @xmath176 ( @xmath0 is finite ) . to this end",
    ", one can successfully employ the modified wkb method @xcite presented in the previous section . according to the authors of @xcite , their method is  exact in the asymptotic limit @xmath177  , where @xmath178 .",
    "our numerical results confirm this assertion .",
    "thus , using directly the quantization condition ( [ 54 ] ) , one obtains : @xmath179 where @xmath180 and the parameter @xmath181 is defined in eq.([55 ] ) .    for the fsw - like potential eq.([65 ] ) gives @xmath182 , which certainly coincides with the analytic solution presented in the @xmath183 section of the appendix .",
    "in general , it is easy to check that the asymptotic expressions for the analytic solutions presented in the appendix coincide with the results of this section .",
    "the second derivatives @xmath184 of the asymptotic critical parameters ( [ 64 ] ) are presented in table [ tl ] along with values of @xmath166 which approximate the general second derivative @xmath185 numerically .",
    "it is seen that for the numerical second derivative @xmath186 the speed @xmath187 of a convergence to the asymptotic value @xmath169 ( @xmath153 ) depends on the number of bound states @xmath1 .",

    ", the fastest convergence corresponds to the smallest @xmath72 .",
    "moreover , table [ tl ] shows that @xmath187 far exceeds @xmath188 .    using the first and second methods described in sections [ sec : asymptotic ] and [ sec : riccati ] , respectively , we have computed the critical parameters for a few widely used central potentials included in the nonrelativistic schrdinger - equation .",
    "the results for the exponential , hulthen , yukawa and gaussian potentials are presented in tables [ t1]-[t4 ] , respectively .",
    "the critical parameters for the woods - saxon potential with @xmath192 and @xmath193 are exhibited in tables [ t5 ] and [ t6 ] , respectively .",

    "are proportional to the squares of zeros of the corresponding special functions ( see appendix ) .",
    "it is worth noting that the critical parameters for the hulthen potential ( @xmath72 ) have an especially simple form .",
    "they are equal to @xmath4 where the number of bound states equals @xmath1 .",
    "all these parameters are displayed in tables [ t1 ] , [ t2 ] , [ t5 ] and [ t6 ] for convenient comparing with the cases of @xmath55 .",

    "the critical parameters for the cut - off potential of the form ( [ a1 ] ) are not numerically presented here , because there is no problem to provide the proper calculations according to eq.([a7 ] ) for any orbital quantum number @xmath0 and parameter @xmath14 .",

    "one should notice that all computations were performed by means of the simplest mathematica-7 codes using the standard ( default ) working precision .",
    "it is possible , of course , to enhance the calculation accuracy using , e.g. , the better working precision .    due to lack of space",

    "for the gaussian potential we have found only the results of the binding energy calculations ( see , e.g. , ref.@xcite ) .",
    "these energies were computed for @xmath204 and were completely consistent with the critical parameters presented here in table [ t6 ] .",
    "in conclusion , we would like to emphasize that the critical parameters are not of some particular character .    first , they present some _ universal characteristics _ of central potentials .",
    "second , using the tables of these parameters , one can answer the following questions :    \\1 ) what is the number @xmath1 of bound states for the given central potential and given orbital quantum number @xmath0 .",

    "it is important to realize that for any two sets @xmath206 and @xmath207 it follows from inequality @xmath208 for the given central potential that @xmath209 therefore , from the presented tables we can deduce the following important properties of the discrete energy spectrum of the considered central potentials : @xmath210 this probably relates to the fact that the hulthen and the yukawa potentials are singular at the origin .",
    "it was established that the leading terms of the asymptotic expansions of the critical parameters @xmath3 have the following forms : @xmath211 where the general analytic expressions for the factors @xmath212 and @xmath213 are presented in section [ sec : asymptotics ] .",

    "<S> transition states or quantum states of zero energy appear at the boundary between the discrete part of the spectrum of negative energies and the continuum part of positive energy states . </S>",
    "<S> as such , transition states can be regarded as a limiting case of a bound state with vanishing binding energy , emerging for a particular set of critical potential parameters . in this work </S>",
    "<S> we study the properties of these critical parameters for short range central potentials . to this end </S>",
    "<S> we develop two exact methods and also utilize the first and second order wkb approximations . using these methods </S>",
    "<S> we have calculated the critical parameters for several widely used central potentials .    </S>",
    "<S> the general analytic expressions for the asymptotic representations of the critical parameters were derived for cases where either the orbital quantum number @xmath0 or the number @xmath1 of bound states approaches infinity .    </S>",
    "<S> the above mathematical models enable us to answer the following physical ( quantum mechanical ) questions : i ) what is the number of bound states for a given central potential and given orbital quantum number @xmath0 ; ii ) what is the maximum value of @xmath0 which can provide a bound state for the given central potential ; iii ) what is the order of energy levels for the given form of the central potential .    </S>",
    "<S> it is revealed that the ordering of energy levels depends on the potential singularity at the origin . </S>"
