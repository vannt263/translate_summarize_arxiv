    "boutet de monvel s calculus @xcite provides a pseudodifferential framework which encompasses the classical differential boundary value problems . in an extension of the concept of lopatinski and shapiro , it associates to each operator two symbols : a pseudodifferential principal symbol , which is a bundle homomorphism , and an operator - valued boundary symbol .",
    "ellipticity requires the invertibility of both . in this case",
    ", the calculus allows the construction of a parametrix . if the underlying manifold is compact , elliptic elements define fredholm operators , and the parametrices are fredholm inverses .",
    "boutet de monvel showed how then the index can be computed in topological terms .",
    "the crucial observation is that elliptic operators can be mapped to compactly supported k - theory classes on the cotangent bundle over the interior of the manifold .",
    "the topological index map , applied to this class , then furnishes an integer which is equal to the index of the operator .    for the construction of the above map , boutet de monvel combined operator homotopies and classical ( vector bundle ) k - theory in a very refined way .",
    "it therefore came as a surprise that this map  which is neither obvious nor trivial  can also be obtained as a composition of various standard maps in k - theory for c@xmath0-algebras  which was not yet available when @xcite was written .",
    "in fact , it turns out to be basically sufficient to have a precise understanding of the short exact sequence induced by the boundary symbol map , @xcite , see also @xcite .    in the spirit of the classical result of atiyah and singer @xcite we introduce and consider in this article _ families _ of operators in boutet de monvel s calculus , an issue that has not been addressed in @xcite .",
    "more specifically , we consider a compact manifold @xmath1 with boundary and then a fiber bundle @xmath2 with fiber @xmath1 over a compact hausdorff space @xmath3 .",
    "we are then studying fiberwise ( elliptic ) boutet de monvel operators , depending continuously on @xmath4 . in order to be able to use the powerful tools of c@xmath0-algebra k - theory we define such an operator family @xmath5 over @xmath3 as a continuous section of a bundle of c@xmath0-algebras over @xmath3 , a concept which is slightly more general than that of atiyah and singer , who equip the set of operators with a frchet - space topology .",
    "in fact , restricted to the case without boundary , our algebra of continuous families @xmath6 contains that of @xcite as a dense subalgebra .    while the analytic index @xmath7 of such an elliptic family @xmath5 as an element of @xmath8 is easily defined following atiyah @xcite and jnich @xcite , cf .",
    "definition [ ani ] below , it is less obvious how to obtain the topological description .",
    "similar to boutet de monvel s approach , the essential step is the construction of a map which associates to an elliptic family an element of the compactly supported k - theory of the total space of the bundle of cotangent spaces over the interior of the underlying manifolds .",
    "we regard this map as a homomorphism defined on @xmath9 , where @xmath10 denotes the ideal of continuous families which have values in compact operators . in its definition",
    ", we use a fact which builds upon an observation of boutet de monvel : there exists a natural subalgebra @xmath11 of @xmath6 for which @xmath12 so that each elliptic family @xmath5 in @xmath6 can be represented by a class @xmath13 .",
    "moreover , @xmath14 is commutative which allows us to make the connection to classical ( vector bundle ) k - theory",
    ". then @xmath15 is defined by applying the classical construction of the topological index to @xmath16 , compare definition [ indt ] .",
    "our main result is then that these two indices are equal . to prove this , we reduce to the classical families index theorem of atiyah and singer @xcite .",
    "we assign in a canonical way to @xmath5 an index problem on a bundle of closed manifolds , namely the double of our original bundle of manifolds with boundary .",
    "we then show that this associated family has the same analytic as well as topological index as @xmath5 . in this step",
    "we make once more use of the isomorphism @xmath17 .",
    "it is perhaps worth stressing that our index theorem does not use the boutet de monvel index theorem for boundary value problems , which can actually be obtained from ours by taking @xmath3 equal to one point . taking the families index theorem for granted ,",
    "albin and melrose derived a more refined formula for the chern character of the index bundle in terms of symbolic data ( * ? ? ? * theorem 3.8 ) .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : section  [ sec : bdm_single ] starts with a review of the boutet de monvel calculus for a single manifold .",
    "we introduce the c@xmath0-algebra @xmath18 of boutet de monvel operators of order and class zero and the boundary symbol map @xmath19 .",
    "section  [ sec1 ] gives the technical introduction of operator families in boutet de monvel s calculus over a compact hausdorff space @xmath3 .",
    "we define them as the continuous sections into a bundle of operator algebras whose typical fiber is the c@xmath0-algebra @xmath20 . in order to keep the exposition simple , we first treat the case where @xmath21 is trivial one - dimensional and @xmath22 .",
    "we introduce @xmath19 as the fiberwise symbol map and extend the results on the kernel and image of @xmath19 to the family situation .",
    "while in the single operator case this was sufficient to compute the k - theory of @xmath23 , the situation is more complicated in the families case .",
    "in fact , an important ingredient in @xcite is that fact that whenever @xmath1 is connected and @xmath24 there exists a continuous section of @xmath25 .",
    "this is no longer true in the families case .",
    "instead , we prove in theorem [ kth ] the fact alluded to above : for @xmath22 we define @xmath11 as the c@xmath0-algebra generated by all sections whose pseudodifferential part is independent of the co - variable at the boundary and whose singular green part vanishes .",
    "then @xmath14 is commutative .",
    "moreover , we use a mayer - vietoris argument to show that the inclusion map induces an isomorphism @xmath26    in section  [ index ] we study the index problem .",
    "again , we confine ourselves first to the case of trivial one - dimensional bundles . we introduce the analytic and topological index and , as our main result , prove that the analytic and the topological index are equal . to achieve this ,",
    "we reduce with the help of a doubling procedure to the case of families of closed manifolds .",
    "this reduction is based on the fact that we can use the isomorphism in to represent any element of @xmath9 as a @xmath27-class of @xmath28 . in section  [ sec : non - trivial_bundles ] we finish by explaining the arguments needed for the general situation .",
    "two appendices give technical details about the structure group of our families and about the knneth theorem we are using .",
    "in this section , we introduce notation and recall the case of single operators .",
    "details can be found in the monographs of rempel and schulze @xcite and grubb @xcite as well as in the short introduction @xcite .",
    "let @xmath1 be a compact manifold of dimension @xmath29 with boundary @xmath30 and interior @xmath31 .",
    "we equip @xmath1 with a _ collar _ ( i.e , a neighborhood @xmath32 of the boundary and a diffeomorphism @xmath33 ) which then induces the _ boundary defining function @xmath34 _ the variables of @xmath30 will be denoted @xmath35 .",
    "the collar is used to provide the double @xmath36 of @xmath1 with a ( noncanonical ) smooth structure .",
    "recall that @xmath36 is the union of two copies @xmath37 and @xmath38 of @xmath1 quotiented by identification of the two copies of @xmath30 .",
    "an element in boutet de monvel s calculus is a matrix of operators @xmath39 acting between sections of vector bundles @xmath40 over @xmath1 and @xmath41 over @xmath30 . in this article",
    "we shall focus on the case of endomorphisms , where @xmath42 and @xmath43 . for convenience ,",
    "we choose a riemannian metric @xmath44 on @xmath45 and hermitean metrics on @xmath46 to later obtain fixed hilbert spaces structures , although the results do not depend on these choices .",
    "the operator @xmath47 in the upper left corner is a truncated pseudodifferential operator , derived from a ( classical ) pseudodifferential operator @xmath48 on @xmath36 .",
    "given @xmath49 , @xmath50 is defined as the composition @xmath51 .",
    "here @xmath52 extends @xmath53 by zero to a function on @xmath36 , to which @xmath48 is applied .",
    "the result then is restricted ( via @xmath54 ) to @xmath1 .",
    "in general it is not true that @xmath55 . in order to ensure this ,",
    "@xmath48 is required to satisfy the _",
    "transmission condition _ : if @xmath56 is the asymptotic expansion of the local symbol @xmath57 of @xmath48 into terms @xmath58 , which are positively homogeneous of degree @xmath59 in @xmath60 one requires that , for @xmath61 and @xmath62 one has @xmath63 . as for the remaining entries ,",
    "@xmath64 is a singular green operator , @xmath65 a trace operator , @xmath66 a potential operator , and @xmath67 a pseudodifferential operator on the boundary .",
    "operators in boutet de monvel s calculus have an _ order _ and a _ class _ or _ type_. there are invertible elements in the calculus which allow us to reduce both , order and class , to zero .",
    "the operators then form a @xmath68-subalgebra of the bounded operators on the hilbert space @xmath69 .    [",
    "a ] let @xmath70 denote the algebra of the ( polyhomogeneous ) boutet de monvel operators of order and class zero on @xmath71 , endowed with its natural frchet topology , and @xmath72 its c@xmath0-closure in the algebra of all bounded operators on @xmath73 .",
    "we write @xmath74 and @xmath72 if @xmath75 is trivial one - dimensional and @xmath22 .",
    "let @xmath76 be given as in .",
    "for each entry @xmath77 we have a symbol .",
    "this is the usual one for @xmath48 and @xmath67 , while @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 can be considered as operator - valued pseudodifferential operators on @xmath30 with classical symbols in the sense of schulze @xcite .",
    "these are defined as follows , see @xcite : the principal pseudodifferential symbol @xmath78 of @xmath5 is the restriction of the principal symbol of @xmath48 to the cosphere bundle over @xmath1 . in order to define the boundary principal symbol @xmath79 we first denote by @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 , and @xmath84 the principal symbols of @xmath48 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 , respectively .",
    "we let @xmath85 be the pullback of @xmath86 to the normal bundle of @xmath1 , lifted to @xmath87 . for fixed @xmath87",
    ", @xmath88 is a function on the conormal line in @xmath89 , acting on @xmath90 .",
    "it induces a truncated pseudodifferential operator @xmath91 in local coordinates near the boundary we then define the boundary principal symbol @xmath92 by @xmath93 with @xmath94 indicating that we let the symbol act as an operator with respect to the variable @xmath95 only . note that the operator @xmath96 is compact and that @xmath97 , @xmath98 and @xmath99 even have finite rank .",
    "the operator @xmath100 on the other hand is a toeplitz type operator ; it will not be compact unless @xmath101 .    denoting by @xmath102 the ideal of compact operators on @xmath103 , one has the following important estimate based on work by gohberg @xcite , seeley @xcite and grubb - geymonat @xcite , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* , theorem 1 ) for a proof : @xmath104 where the sup - norms on the right hand side are over the cosphere bundles in @xmath1 and @xmath30 , respectively .",
    "this estimate implies , in particular , that both symbols extend continuously to c@xmath0-algebra homomorphisms defined on @xmath105 . for fixed @xmath89 the range @xmath106 forms an algebra of wiener - hopf type operators .",
    "it also follows from this estimate that @xmath19 vanishes on @xmath107 .",
    "since the entries of @xmath108 induced by @xmath81 , @xmath83 , @xmath82 and @xmath84 are ( pointwise ) compact while that induced by @xmath80 is not ( unless @xmath101 ) , we conclude that a boutet de monvel operator @xmath5 belongs to @xmath109 if and only if @xmath78 vanishes at the boundary .",
    "based on this observation ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section  2 ) for details ) one can show that @xmath110 induces an isomorphism @xmath111    the k - theory of the range of @xmath112 was described in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section  3 ) .",
    "let @xmath113 denote the c@xmath0-homomorphism that maps @xmath44 to @xmath114 , where @xmath115 is the operator of multiplication by a function @xmath116 whose restriction to @xmath30 equals @xmath44 .",
    "then b induces a k - theory isomorphism .",
    "to simplify the exposition , we shall assume in this section that @xmath117 is the trivial one - dimensional line bundle and @xmath22 .",
    "let @xmath118 denote the group of diffeomorphisms of @xmath1 , equipped with its usual frchet topology . recall that @xmath119 is the collar fixed at the beginning of section [ sec : bdm_single ] .",

    "we are going to use two properties that each @xmath124 satisfies : the boundary defining function is preserved ( @xmath125 for @xmath126 ) , and the canonical map @xmath127 , defined by @xmath128 where @xmath129 are the two canonical embeddings of @xmath1 in @xmath36 , is a diffeomorphism of @xmath36 .    throughout this paper , @xmath130 will denote a fiber bundle over the compact hausdorff space @xmath3 with fiber @xmath1 and structure group @xmath64 .",
    "note , however , that this choice of structure group is just for convenience and can always be ( essentially uniquely ) arranged for a general bundle with typical fiber @xmath1 , see the appendix [ sec : structgroup ] for details .",
    "we denote @xmath131 .",
    "each @xmath132 is a smooth manifold with boundary , non - canonically diffeomorphic to @xmath1 .",
    "the restriction of @xmath133 to @xmath134 is a fiber bundle @xmath135 with fiber @xmath30 and structure group @xmath136 .",
    "next we define a bundle of hilbert spaces , and later a c@xmath0-algebra which will act on its space of sections .",
    "this is a bit delicate , as it depends on some further choices ; therefore we give the details .",
    "we choose a continuous family of riemannian metrics @xmath137 with corresponding measures @xmath138 on @xmath132 and define @xmath139 .",
    "recall that such a family @xmath140 exists : we can patch them together using trivializations of the bundle and a partition of unity on @xmath3 , as the space of riemannian metrics on @xmath1 is convex .    the union @xmath141 is a fiber bundle of topological vector spaces over @xmath3 , canonically associated to @xmath130 , with trivializations induced from the trivializations of @xmath133 in the obvious way .",
    "the structure group is the group of invertible bounded operators on @xmath73 , _ equipped with the strong topology_.    that we obtain here the strong topology and not the norm topology comes from the fact that the changes of trivialization are implemented by pullback with the diffeomorphisms of @xmath64 , and this is continuous in the strong , but not the norm topology .",
    "this makes our considerations about bundles of operators later quite cumbersome and requires to use the fact that we deal with pseudodifferential operators .",
    "moreover , the choice @xmath137 gives rise to a continuous family of inner products on @xmath142 inducing the given topology of the fibers @xmath143 .",
    "let @xmath144 be the boutet de monvel algebra of order and class zero on @xmath145 .",
    "we want to define the bundle of boutet de monvel algebras @xmath146 as locally trivial bundle with structure group the automorphism group of the c@xmath0-algebra @xmath72 with the _ norm topology _ , associated to @xmath2 . to achieve this",
    ", we need the diffeomorphism invariance of the boutet de monvel algebra in a precise form .",
    "given @xmath124 , let @xmath147 denote the bounded operator on @xmath148 defined by @xmath149 .",

    "this corresponds to ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 1.3 ) .",
    "in fact , even if @xmath1 is closed , atiyah and singer consider a slightly different situation in that they close @xmath74 with respect to the operator norm of the action on all sobolev spaces , while we only use the operator norm on @xmath152 .",
    "their argument still applies verbatim , since they treat the action on each sobolev space separately .",
    "indeed , the proof of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 1.3 ) uses only a number of formal properties of the algebra of pseudodifferential operators which are also satisfied by the boutet de monvel algebra , and therefore applies in the same way to our general situation . to be more specific , let us list these properties :    1 .",

    "moreover , for a sufficiently small open neighborhood of @xmath157 , the image has uniformly bounded norm .",
    "the proof of this fact as given in @xcite works for compact manifolds with boundary exactly the same way as for closed manifolds .",

    "@xmath565 we have @xmath566 . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath567 is , for @xmath509 small enough , invertible on @xmath568 $ ] with uniform bound on the norm of the inverse ( and with better bounds if we choose @xmath509 smaller ) , and @xmath569 which is uniformly bounded , independent of @xmath509 . by choosing @xmath509 small enough",
    ", therefore @xmath570 will be linearly independent from @xmath571 and so @xmath572 is a submersion for all @xmath573 .",
    "we check that we actually constructed diffeomorphisms .",
    "we made our construction such that all the maps @xmath572 are submersions which map the boundary to itself , therefore the image is an open subset of @xmath1 .",
    "as @xmath1 is compact , the image is also closed , and the map being a local diffeomorphism , is a covering map .",
    "because it is homotopic to the diffeomorphism @xmath507 , it is a trivial covering map and therefore a diffeomorphism .",
    "it is obvious that @xmath490 and @xmath574 lies in the variant of @xmath64 where @xmath575 is replaced by @xmath576 .",
    "next , we compose with a family of reparametrizations of the collar @xmath577 which stretches @xmath578 to @xmath579 such that in the end we really map to @xmath64 . note that our construction is carried out in such a way that for @xmath580 , where @xmath507 was already in @xmath64 , @xmath581 for all @xmath564 , although , because of the last reparametrization step , not necessarily @xmath582 .",
    "therefore , finally , we choose a function @xmath583 $ ] which is @xmath157 outside @xmath32 and @xmath527 on @xmath492 and replace the homotopy @xmath572 with @xmath584 .",
    "this yields the desired homotopy from @xmath490 to an @xmath491 taking values in @xmath64 .",
    "moreover , the mapping is constant on @xmath492 .",
    "by the `` knneth formula '' , we mean the following theorem of schochet @xcite :    [ ks ] let a and b be c@xmath0-algebras with @xmath5 in the smallest subcategory of the category of separable nuclear c@xmath0-algebras which contains the separable type i algebras and is closed under the operations of taking ideals , quotients , extensions , inductive limits , stable isomorphism , and crossed product by @xmath585 and by @xmath586 .",
    "then there is a natural @xmath587-graded exact sequence @xmath588    we use this theorem to prove a statement made in the proof of theorem [ biso ] :    [ kun ] @xmath589 is an isomorphism , @xmath206 .",

    "as explained in the introduction of @xcite , @xmath593 can be regarded as a c@xmath0-subalgebra of @xmath594 , where @xmath595 denotes the toeplitz algebra . since @xmath595 belongs to the category defined in the statement of theorem [ ks ] ( see examples 5.6.4 and 6.5.1 in @xcite ) , we may apply schochet s theorem for @xmath596 and for @xmath592 .",

    "we can map ( [ kas ] ) to the corresponding sequence obtained by replacing @xmath246 with @xmath593 .",
    "since the maps induced by @xmath598 are isomorphisms , it follows from the five - lemma that the maps induced by @xmath599 are also isomorphisms . @xmath232",
