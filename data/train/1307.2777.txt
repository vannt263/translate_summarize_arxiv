    "a topological insulator ( ti ) @xcite is a system supporting helical states @xcite at its edges .",
    "these states , characterized by strong coupling between their spin degree of freedom and direction of propagation , appear as kramers pairs and have zero gap as a consequence of the @xmath1-invariance . at the same time",
    "the bulk states have a finite gap .",
    "therefore , these systems represent a phase of matter with coexisting metallic edge and insulating bulk .",
    "importantly , the helical states are necessarily edge states ( one- or two - dimensional ( 2d ) ) of a bulk system ( two- or three - dimensional ( 3d ) ) and do not exist in truly one - dimensional or 2d systems since the @xmath1-invariance requires for fermions an even number of dirac points .",
    "one - dimensional helical states have been experimentally implemented in semiconductor quantum wells @xcite where the quantum spin hall effect has been observed in the regime of the inverted band structure supporting dissipationless edge currents @xcite .    of particular interest for the present study",
    "are 3d tis supporting 2d helical states @xcite .",
    "these surface states have been experimentally observed , _",
    "e.g. _ , in bi@xmath2te@xmath3 @xcite , where a single nondegenerate dirac cone is located at the @xmath4 point of the surface brillouin zone . the isotropic conic dependence of the electron energy on the momentum inherent to low - energy states breaks at higher energies . here",
    "cubic in momentum terms reduce the continuous rotational symmetry down to the discrete threefold rotational symmetry . as a result",
    ", the shape of constant energy contours becomes hexagonal @xcite as observed in experiments @xcite .",
    "this anisotropic energy - momentum dependence may lead to fundamentally new behavior of physical observables .",
    "in particular , in ref . it has been predicted that the dielectric function obtained within the random phase approximation may become anisotropic in the momentum space .",
    "here we address an alternative issue related to the existence of the helical states and explore their impact on other degrees of freedom , namely lattice vibrations , with a special focus on the cherenkov sound ( cs ) excited by helical particles on a surface of a 3d ti .    the cherenkov effect @xcite is a fundamental physical phenomenon having both optic @xcite and acoustic @xcite manifestations . in particular , in the acoustic cherenkov effect a medium emits a forward sound , distributed within the cherenkov cone , under the impact of an electron whose velocity is larger than the sound velocity of this medium .",
    "this situation may change when there appears a strong coupling between the orbital and spin electronic degrees of freedom .",
    "it has been shown in ref . that in a 2d system with the rashba @xcite spin - orbit interaction electrons can excite anomalous cs , which propagates outside the cherenkov cone in forward and backward directions .",
    "here anomalous cs appears in a homogeneous system due to interchiral transitions specific to spin - orbit coupled systems .",
    "this outstanding property of the cs in systems with strong spin - orbit coupling provides a platform for new applications in acoustic amplification based currently mainly on the normal cs .",
    "these more conventional applications include , _",
    "e.g. _ , acoustic amplification in confined systems such as si / sige / si heterostructures @xcite or the cherenkov emission in polar bulk semiconductors @xcite such as gaas .",
    "it is important to mention that in optics an anomalous cherenkov effect may appear in the absence of spin - orbit coupling but due to strong inhomogeneity of systems as has been achieved , _",
    "e.g. _ , in photonic crystals @xcite .    turning to the cs on a surface of a 3d",
    "ti one might expect a picture similar to the one in a 2d rashba gas .",
    "indeed , as a result of a strong spin - orbit coupling , anomalous cs must appear due to interchiral transitions and propagate forward and backward .",
    "however , this scenario can not be realized : since the velocity @xmath5 on the dirac cone is much larger than the sound velocity @xmath6 , @xmath7 , interchiral transitions do not contribute and the cs is of pure intrachiral nature .    as has been demonstrated in ref .",
    ", in this case there can be excited only normal cs with the standard features : 1 ) the sound is located within the cherenkov cone whose angle @xmath8 is ( because of @xmath7 ) close to @xmath0 , @xmath9 ; 2 ) its strictly forward propagation is forbidden .    here",
    "we demonstrate that the discrete threefold rotational symmetry of the system drastically changes this standard picture and leads to fundamentally new features of the cs propagating on a surface of a ti . among these features",
    "are 1 ) strictly forward propagation and its remarkable and valuable for experiments dependence on the anisotropy of the helical states ; 2 ) anomalous propagation outside the cherenkov cone , _",
    "i.e. _ , for angles @xmath10 ; 3 ) localization into a finite number of normal and anomalous beams in the regime of strong anisotropy .    these remarkable features of the cs distinguish tis from other systems such as , _ e.g. _ , graphene .",
    "indeed , the strictly forward sound is obviously absent in graphene because in this system the spinor components have the same absolute value while on a surface of a ti they have different absolute values ( see the next section ) .",
    "in other words , what physically distinguishes the cs on a surface of a ti is the finite out - of - plane spin polarization of this surface .",
    "a recent investigation of the cs in graphene and its application to hypersonic devices may be found for example in ref . .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ phys_mod ]",
    "we present a physical model able to capture the cs propagation on a surface of a 3d ti .",

    "second , the phonon anisotropy , @xmath157 , is much weaker than the cs anisotropy ( several orders of magnitude ) .",
    "therefore , the contribution of the phonon anisotropy to the total anisotropy of the cs will be negligible .    the estimate above clearly demonstrates that the cs on a surface of a 3d ti and its unique features explored here may really be accessed and utilized in modern experiments and future electronic devices based on 3d ti .",
    "another aspect making the cs fundamentally important is dissipation unavoidable in realistic devices coupled to external environments .",
