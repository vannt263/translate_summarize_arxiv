    "the presence of multiple stellar populations in globular clusters ( gcs ) has been widely established both by photometric and by spectroscopic studies .",
    "more than 40 years ago the red giant branch ( rgb ) of @xmath3 centauri ( ngc 5139 ) was found to have a photometric spread in color ( woolley 1966 ) , associated with a metallicity spread ( freeman & rodgers 1975 , norris & bessel 1975 ) , but the first real challenge to the traditional picture of gcs as simple stellar populations came from the discovery of abundance anomalies among stars within the same gcs ( e.g. , kraft 1979 ) .",
    "all galactic gcs studied so far show na - o anti - correlations ( e.g. , carretta et al .",
    "2009a ) , indicative of contamination from products of proton - capture reactions at high temperature ( denisenkov & denisenkova 1989 , langer et al .",
    "moreover , the presence of such anti - correlations in unevolved main sequence ( ms ) stars ( e.g. , gratton et al .  2001 ; ramirez & cohen 2002 ) , which have not yet reached sufficiently high temperatures in their interiors , suggests that more than one generation of stars has formed within galactic gcs ( see gratton et al .",
    "2004 for a review ) , possibly in combination with accretion onto low - mass stars of ejecta from either intermediate - mass stars ( dantona et al .  1983",
    "; renzini 1983 ) , fast - rotating massive stars ( e.  g.  , decressin et al .",
    "2007 ) , or massive binaries ( de mink et al .  2009 ) .",
    "clear evidence of a complex star - formation history in gcs has come from high - precision hubble space telescope ( _ hst _ ) photometry , which showed unequivocally that the phenomenon of multiple sequences in the color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) of gcs is not confined to the special case of @xmath3 centauri ( for which see , e.g. , anderson 1997 , bedin et al .",
    "split or spread mss have been observed in ngc 2808 , 47 tucanae ( ngc 104 ) , and ngc 6752 ( piotto et al .  2007 , anderson et al .",
    "2009 , milone et al .",
    "2010 ) , while splits in the subgiant branches ( sgbs ) have been detected in ngc 1851 , ngc 6656 ( m22 ) , 47 tuc , and at least five other gcs ( milone et al .  2008 , marino et al .",
    "2009 , anderson et al .",
    "2009 , piotto 2009 ) .",
    "the splitting of the red - giant branch ( rgb ) has been observed in all the gcs studied to date with appropriate photometric bands ( e.g. , marino et al .",
    "2008 ; yong et al .",
    "2008 , lee at al .",
    "2009 , lardo et al .",
    "the photometric investigations definitively confirm that it is common for gcs to contain multiple stellar populations .",
    "more recently it has been possible to connect the photometrically observed multiple sequences with differences of chemical composition among the stars in the same cluster .",
    "the aim of such studies has been to understand how successive generations of stars could have formed in a gc , and what could be inferred about the nature of the polluters from their chemical imprint on the second - generation stars .",
    "the first notable results were by piotto et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , who showed that the bluer ms in @xmath3 centauri is more metal - rich than the redder one .",
    "the only way to reconcile the photometric and spectroscopic results is to assume that the bluer ms is strongly he - enhanced .",
    "other examples are given by marino et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , who showed that the presence of two groups of stars with different c , n , na , and o content is at the root of the difference in the @xmath4 color of the rgb stars in ngc 6121 ( m4 ) .",
    "na - poor ( cn - weak ) giants define a sequence bluer than the one occupied by the na - rich ( cn - strong ) ones .",
    "yong et al .",
    "( 2008 ) found that rgb spreads are present in a large number of gcs , when using the strmgren @xmath5 index , which is a powerful tracer of the n abundance .",
    "in general , stellar evolutionary models suggest that observed multiple mss should correspond to stellar populations with different he abundance , the bluer sequences having a higher helium abundance than primordial ( e.g. , norris 2004 ; dantona et al .  2005 ; piotto et al .  2005 , 2007 ; di",
    "criscienzo et al .  2010 , 2011 ) .",
    "according to this picture , the triple ms in ngc 2808 can also correspond to the three groups of stars with different oxygen and sodium abundances observed among the rgb stars ( carretta et al .",
    "2006 ) , likely to come from three successive episodes of star formation .",
    "in fact , hydrogen burning at high temperatures through the cno cycle and subsequent proton captures result in a he enrichment , and at the same time in an enhancement of n , na , and al , and a depletion of c , o , and mg .",
    "this scenario has been nicely confirmed for ngc 2808 by bragaglia et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , who measured chemical abundances of one star on the red ms and one on the blue ms , and found that the latter shows an enhancement of n , na , and al , and a depletion in c and mg . to date",
    "there are no spectroscopic studies of stars on the middle branch of the ms , however .",
    "finally , theoretical models have proposed that the sgb split observed in some gcs could be due to two stellar groups with either an age difference of 12 gyr or a different c+n+o content ( cassisi et al .  2008 ,",
    "ventura et al .  2009 ) . in support of the chemical - content scenario ,",
    "a bimodality in the @xmath6-process elements and in the cno has been detected in ngc 1851 and m22 ( yong et al .",
    "2009 , marino et al .  2011a ) .    summarizing",
    "the observational and theoretical scenarios :    * split mss suggest helium enrichment , and also correspond to different groups of stars in the na - o anticorrelation ; *   multiple sgbs might be ascribed to different total abundance of c+n+o or to different age ; * photometrically multiple rgbs might be due to differences in c , n , o content , via the different strengths of the corresponding molecular features ; * there appears to be no strong indication of any significant spread in [ fe / h ] ( except for a few clusters :  @xmath3 centauri , m22 , terzan 5 , and ngc 2419 ) .",
    "multiple stellar populations with different helium abundance also offer an explanation for the complex , extended , and clumpy hb morphology exhibited by some clusters ( e.g. , dantona et al .",
    "2005 , dantona & caloi 2008 , catelan , valcarce , & sweigart 2009 , gratton et al .",
    "a direct confirmation of a connection of the hb shape with the chemical content of the hb comes from recent work by marino et al.(2011b ) , who have found that stars on the blue side of the instability strip of the cluster m4 are na - rich and o - poor , whereas stars on the red hb are all na - poor .",
    "while the presence of multiple stellar populations in gcs as revealed by multiplicities of the ms , sgb , rgb , or hb has been clearly established in many clusters , efforts to unequivocally connect the various evolutionary stages of each individual stellar generation have met with only modest success so far , because individual sequences appear to merge and even cross each other in some parts of the cmd , strongly depending on the photometric bands used to build the cmd .",
    "connecting the various branches from the ms to the hb would greatly help to fully characterize each individual stellar generation , in terms of composition and age .    in the present paper",
    "we attack this problem by applying high - precision _ hst _ photometry to the globular cluster 47 tucanae ( go-12311 , pi piotto ) .",
    "this is one of the gcs in the milky way where multiple stellar populations have recently been detected and studied both photometrically and spectroscopically . from the analysis of a large number of archival _ hst _ images of the inner @xmath7 arcmin , anderson et al .",
    "( 2009 ) found that the sgb is spread in magnitude , with at least two distinct branches :  a brighter one with an intrinsic broadening in luminosity , and a second one about 0.05 mag fainter that includes a small fraction of the stars .",
    "anderson et al .  were also able to study the ms in a less crowded field 6 arcmin from the center and found an intrinsic broadening that increases towards fainter magnitudes .",
    "they interpreted the ms spread in terms of a variation of helium abundance of @xmath80.03 .",
    "di criscienzo et al .",
    "( 2010 ) suggested that a spread in helium of @xmath8 might be responsible for both the luminosity spread of the bright sgb and the hb morphology , whereas an increase in the overall c+n+o abundance could be responsible for the faint sgb . in substantial agreement with the above estimates of the differences in helium content in 47 tuc , nataf et al .",
    "( 2011 ) have estimated a helium difference of @xmath9 between two sub - populations of this cluster , based on the strength and luminosity of the rgb bump and on the luminosity of the hb .",
    "they also noted that the helium - rich population is more centrally concentrated .    since the early seventies",
    ", spectroscopic investigations have shown that rgb stars in 47 tuc exhibit large star - to - star variations in cn band strength ( e.g. , mcclure & osborn  1974 , bell , dickens , & gustafsson 1975 ) , with two distinct groups of stars showing different cn content ( norris & freeman 1979 , briley 1997 ) ; this dichotomy is also present among ms stars ( cannon 1998 , harbeck et al .",

    "this paper is organized as follows : in section  [ data ] we describe the data and the reduction .",
    "section  [ sec : ms ] reveals a split in the ms , and in section  [ ycnoms ] we explore possible theoretical interpretations .",
    "sections  [ sec : sgb ] , [ sec : rgb ] , and [ sec : hb ] return to the pursuit of multiple sequences along the sgb , the rgb , and the hb respectively , and also explore their interpretation .",
    "the spatial distribution of multiple stellar populations is investigated in section  [ sec : rd ] , while in section  [ sec : con ] we attempt to connect the multiple sequences that we have found along the ms , the sgb , the rgb , and the hb , and to trace the cmd of each of the two stellar generations . a summary and some final discussion",
    "follow in section  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "for our study of the stellar populations in 47 tuc , we used data sets from two different telescopes . for the crowded central regions of the cluster we used _",
    "images taken with the wide field channel of the advanced camera for surveys ( acs / wfc ) and the uvis channel of wide field camera 3 ( wfc3/uvis ) , while to study the spatial distribution of the populations we made use of _ u _ , _ b _ , _ v _ , and _ i _ ground - based photometry from the data base of 856 original and archival ccd images from stetson ( 2000 ) . among them , 480 images were obtained with the wide - field imager of the eso / mpi 2.2 m telescope , and 200 with the 1.5 m telescope at cerro tololo inter - american observatory , while the remaining 176 images come from various other telescopes .",
    "these observations are described in detail in bergbusch & stetson ( 2009 ) .",
    "they were reduced following the protocol outlined in some detail by stetson ( 2005 ) and are calibrated on the landolt ( 1992 ) photometric system .",
    "table  1 summarizes the characteristics of the _ hst _ images that we used , while fig .",
    "[ footprint ] shows their footprints .",
    "the acs images , and a number of the wfc3 images , were archival , except that the images of go-12311 ( pi piotto ) were taken expressly for this project , and were crucial to its success .",
    "the acs / wfc images were reduced by using the software described in anderson et al .",
    "it consists of a package that analyzes all the exposures simultaneously to generate a catalog of stars over the whole field of view .",
    "stars are measured in each image independently by using for each filter a spatially variable point - spread - function model from anderson & king ( 2006 ) plus a `` perturbation psf '' that allows for the effects of focus variations .",
    "the photometry was put into the vega - mag system following the recipes of bedin et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and using the encircled energy and zero points of sirianni et al .",
    "( 2005 ) .",
    "star positions and fluxes in the wfc3 images were measured with software that is mostly based on img2xym_wfi ( anderson et al .",
    "2006 ) ; this will be presented in a separate paper .",
    "star positions and fluxes were corrected for pixel area and geometric distortion by using the solution given by bellini & bedin ( 2009 ) and bellini , anderson & bedin ( 2011 ) , and were calibrated as in bedin et al .",
    "the work that we present here is based mainly on high - precision photometry , for which our next step was to select a high - quality sample of stars that are relatively isolated and have small photometric and astrometric errors , and are also well fit by the psf . for this",
    "we used the quality indices that our photometry software produces , in a procedure that is described in detail by milone et al .",
    "( 2009 , sect .",
    "finally we corrected our photometry for some remaining position - dependent errors , due to small inadequacies in our psfs that were quite small but were different for each filter .",
    "since all the uses of our photometry would depend on colors , we generated the 36 colors that can be derived from our 9 filters .",
    "for each of these colors we drew the main - sequence ridgeline in the corresponding cmd ; then for each star we identified its 50 closest well - measured neighbors , and found their median color offset from the main - sequence ridgeline . since this constituted a good estimate of the systematic color error at the position of the target star , for that pair of filters we corrected the observed color of the star by that amount .",
    "[ tabdata ]",
    "as already mentioned in section  [ introduction ] , the initial evidence that the ms of 47 tuc is not consistent with a single stellar population comes from the recent work by anderson et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , who detected an intrinsic spread in the @xmath12 color ranging from @xmath13 mag near @xmath14 19.0 to @xmath8 mag around @xmath15 .",
    "our present data set , however , allowed us to study the main sequence with higher precision than was possible for anderson et al . with the data available at that time .",
    "an inspection of the large number of cmds that we obtain from the data set listed in table 1 showed that the multiple populations along the ms are best recognized and separated from photometry that combines @xmath16 with @xmath17 .",
    "the left - hand panel of fig .",
    "[ ms ] shows the hess diagram of @xmath18 vs.  @xmath19 , after the quality selection and photometric corrections described in the previous section .",
    "we immediately note a widely spread rgb , a bimodal sgb , and a double ms . to examine these more closely ,",
    "in the right - hand half of the figure we show a cmd that is zoomed around the upper ms , the sgb , and the start of the rgb . we defer discussion of the sgb and rgb to later sections , and concentrate here on the main - sequence morphology .",
    "the cmd in the right - hand panel suggests that the ms of 47 tuc is bimodal , in analogy with the multiple mss observed in @xmath3 centauri , ngc 2808 , and ngc 6752 . in 47 tuc",
    ", however , the majority of ms stars populate the blue component ( hereafter msb ) , while a small but significant fraction of the stars lie on a redder ms branch ( msa ) .",
    "the two sequences merge close to the turn - off , but on the ms the separation of the two components increases towards fainter magnitudes , from 0.08 mag at @xmath20 to 0.15 mag at @xmath21  as illustrated in more detail in figure  [ msnor ] .",
    "such large , clear separations allow us to exclude any possibility that the ms split might be due to measuring errors .",
    "we note here that the `` verticalizing '' of the ms in fig .",
    "[ msnor ] is a process that we will carry out several times in the course of this paper , and we now explain it once and for all : we first designated msb as our target sequence , by means of a hand - drawn first approximation to its ridge line , and we also chose a limited color range around this line .",
    "we then put a spline through the median colors in successive short intervals of magnitude , and did an iterated sigma - clipping of outliers ; the result was a fiducial sequence for msb .",
    "the verticalization then consisted of subtracting from the color of each star the color of the fiducial sequence at the magnitude of that star .",
    "[ msnor ] allows us to estimate the fractions of msa and msb stars by assigning to each star a verticalized color ( left panel of the figure ) , as explained above .",
    "the right - hand panels of the figure show the color histograms for five magnitude bins ; in each bin we fitted the histogram with a pair of gaussians , shown in magenta and green .",
    "these colors will be used consistently hereafter , to distinguish these two sequences and their post - ms progeny . from the areas under the gaussians we estimate that 82% of the stars belong to msb and 18% to msa ; within the statistical uncertainties of these numbers they have the same values in each of the magnitude intervals .",
    "we also note that msa can not be ascribed to a sequence of binaries .",
    "the dashed line in fig .  [ ms ] is the equal - mass - binary sequence that corresponds to the fiducial sequence of msb . interpreting the stars of msa as binaries would require making the outlandish hypothesis that about a fourth of the ms stars in 47 tuc are in binary systems with mass ratio in the narrow interval 0.70.8 .",
    "in addition , assuming that all msa stars are binaries would imply a binary fraction ( @xmath2215% ) , in sharp contrast with recent estimates of a 2% binary fraction by milone et al .",
    "( 2008 , 2011 ) . in view of this",
    ", we expect that binaries do not affect the following discussion in any significant way .",
    "the double ms is also evident in cmds that use a different combination of magnitude and color , as shown in the @xmath17 vs.  @xmath23 hess diagram and cmd of fig .",
    "it is important to note that in this color system the less populous ms component is _ bluer _ than the other ms stars .",
    "since these two cmds from the filter set f275w , f336w , f435w behave so differently , we construct the two - color diagram that is shown on the left side of figure  [ 2c ] .",
    "there is a clear separation between the two populations , and in the right panel the stars on opposite sides of the dividing line have been colored green and magenta to identify stars of msa and msb , respectively .    with high - accuracy photometric measurements in nine bands ,",
    "36 different cmds could be generated , if we were to use all possible combinations of magnitude and color . in the upper panels of figure [ mscriteria ] we show three of the most representative of these cmds , zoomed around the ms region , with each star colored green or magenta , according to its membership in msa or msb as shown in fig .",
    "[ 2c ] . in the bottom panels of fig .",
    "[ mscriteria ] the same cmds are replicated , and superimposed on the observed cmds are the fiducial ridge lines of msa and msb , derived for each cmd using the method described above .",
    "the fiducials for the two mss are then shown again in fig .",

    ".  [ fid336 ] ( @xmath17 vs.  @xmath26 or @xmath27 ) , and fig .  [ fid814 ] ( @xmath28 vs.  @xmath29 ) , where @xmath30 is indicated on the ordinate of each of row of figures .",
    "we note that msa is redder than msb in most of these cmds , but the color ordering of the two fiducial lines is otherwise in some of them : msa stars become bluer than msb stars in the @xmath26 colors ( fig .",
    "[ mscriteria ] , lower right panel , and fig .",
    "[ fid336 ] ) .",
    "surely the bizarre behavior of the two branches of the ms in our various cmds is telling us something about the physical origin of the split . in hopes of clarifying the complicated observational picture , we will focus on a critical subset of the data",
    ", then we will compare the observations against synthetic spectra that have been calculated for atmospheres with various chemical compositions .",
    "the challenge of choosing a critical subset from our mass of observational results is similar to the one faced by bellini et al .",
    "( 2010 ) in their multicolor study of @xmath3 centauri ; we follow their lead , and look at the separation of the sequences as a function of the color index in which they are observed .",
    "figure [ at12 ] shows the separation of msa and msb in each of eight colors ; the figure also compares these observational separations of the sequences with calculated separations , from three theoretical scenarios that we will describe below .    on the theoretical side ,",
    "multiplicity of mss has been attributed to differences in helium content ( e.g. , norris 2004 , dantona et al .",
    "2005 , piotto et al .  2005 , 2007 ) or in light - element abundances ( e.g. , sbordone et al .",
    "2011 ) , so we will explore both of these possibilities , by making three different choices for the abundances of he , c , n , and o. we will calculate synthetic colors for msa and msb stars for each of these options , seeking the composition that best reproduces all the observed color differences between the two mss .",
    "all three of the options use the same abundance mixture for msa . for he in msa",
    "we choose the primordial he abundance , @xmath31 , and , following cannon et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , we choose [ c / fe ] = 0.06 and [ n / fe ] = 0.20 , which are typical for cn - weak stars . as for [ o / fe ] , we take 0.40 , typical for first - generation stars ( carretta et al .",
    "2009a , b ) . for msb stars we try three different options . in option",
    "i we assume that helium is the only cause of the ms split , and adopt @xmath32 . in option",
    "ii we keep helium the same in the two populations but instead change the light - element abundances , adopting the values listed in table 2 .",
    "finally , in option iii we adjust both helium and the light elements , again as given in table 2 .",
    "we chose to characterize the fiducial sequences by measuring the color difference between msa and msb at the reference magnitude of @xmath33 , that is , the magnitude level indicated by the horizontal lines in fig .  [ fid814 ] .",
    "for an assumed distance modulus @xmath34 and a reddening @xmath35 , this corresponds to an absolute magnitude of @xmath36 .",

    "( 2009 ) . to compare the observations against synthetic photometry",
    ", we adopted the isochrones from the teramo group ( pietrinferni et al .",
    "2004 , 2006 ) specifically calculated for the populations listed in table 2 , then determined @xmath40 and @xmath41 for ms stars at @xmath36 . these temperatures and gravities were then used to calculate model atmospheres with the atlas12 code ( kurucz 2005 , castelli 2005 , sbordone 2005 , sbordone et al .",
    "2007 ) , which allows us to use arbitrary chemical compositions .",
    "spectral synthesis from 2000   to 10000   was then performed using the synthe code ( kurucz 2005 , sbordone et al .",
    "2007 ) , and the resulting synthetic spectra were integrated over the transmission of each of our nine filters to produce the synthetic magnitudes and colors .",
    "we did this separately for an msa star and for an msb star , using for the latter each of the three composition options that table 2 lists for msb .",
    "we concentrate here on the eight @xmath42 colors , comparing the synthetic msa @xmath38 msb color differences with the observed ones shown in figure  [ at12 ] .",
    "the results of our synthetic - spectrum calculations for option i are shown in the figure as blue squares . at wavelengths",
    "longer than @xmath43   there is good agreement with the observed color differences between the two mss , but sizable discrepancies appear at shorter wavelengths , in particular in the f336w band , and we conclude that helium alone can not account for the observed ms split .",
    "the colors that result from option ii ( same helium but different cno proportions ) are plotted as gray triangles in figure  [ at12 ] .",
    "again there is a strong discrepancy between the simulated and the observed color differences in the two near - uv bands ( f336w and f390w ) , but now in the opposite direction . turning instead to option iii , with differences in both helium and the cno elements , we see that the red asterisks in figure  [ at12 ] are in fair agreement with all of the observed color differences .",
    "the agreement is somewhat poorer for the f275w filter , but note that we have not fine - tuned the composition differences between the two mss , and that uv colors can be very sensitive to the adopted mix of he and the cno elements .",
    "the effect of chemical composition differences on ms colors can be summarized as follows .",
    "the main effect of increased helium is to increase the temperatures , making all colors bluer .",
    "the effects of cno are more subtle , since a specific molecule affects some bands but not others .",
    "thus nitrogen affects the near - uv f336w and f390w bands via the nh band and cn bands , respectively , whereas oxygen affects the f275w band , via the oh band .",
    "this is illustrated in the top panel of figure  [ spettri12 ] , showing the synthetic spectra of an msa and an msb star as calculated for option iii ( in green and magenta respectively ) .",
    "the difference between the two is shown in the middle panel , while the band - passes of our filters are plotted in the bottom panel .",
    "these results indicate that the observed color differences between msa and msb can be understood by assuming that msa corresponds to a first stellar generation , with primordial he , and o - rich / n - poor stars , whereas msb corresponds to a population that is enriched in he and n but depleted in o. this need for differences in both helium and cno to account for all the color differences fits quite well with nucleosynthesis expectations , as helium - enriched stellar regions are also inevitably oxygen - depleted and nitrogen - enriched , and vice versa  for example , in the layers subject to the _ second dredge - up _ , at the beginning of the agb phase , or those subject to the so - called envelope - burning process , later during this phase ( renzini & voli 1981 , ventura & dantona 2009 ) .",

    "then , was as follows : since our use of the f275w and f336w bands had separated the rgba and rgbb stars , we took those two samples of stars and examined their behavior in the many different diagrams that can be plotted using only the four bands that have ground - based equivalents , in order to see if we could find a surrogate for the two missing bands . as a result",

    "as in similar situations encountered earlier , we draw a fiducial line for rgbb , by putting a spline through the median colors in successive short intervals of magnitude , and doing an iterated sigma - clipping of outliers .",

    "the corresponding two - gaussian fit to the color distributions of the resulting rgba and rgbb stars is shown in the right panel of the figure .",
    "finally , in figure  [ 3mag ] , which is analogous to figure  [ rgbhst2c ] , we use @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath59 magnitudes to separate rgba and rgbb stars in our entire ground - based field , in exactly the same way as we demonstrated with our _ hst _ photometry using the corresponding f336w , f435w , and f814w passbands .",
    "then we calculate the difference between the @xmath62 value of each star and the value of the fiducial line at the magnitude of the star , @xmath63 .",

    "having developed a method of using ground - based filters for separating populations , we now study the spatial distribution of the two rgb components , by dividing our ground - based field of view into three annuli , each containing about the same number of rgb stars , and applying the procedure described above to each group separately .",
    "the histograms of the @xmath64 distributions are shown in figure  [ rdrgb ] .",

    "these results on 47 tuc and ngc 6121 provide direct evidence that the hb morphology of these gcs is strictly related to the multiple stellar generations they host , and suggest that the multiple sequences discovered in the cmds of many gcs may be connected with the hb morphology .      in order to better understand the origin of the multicolor distribution of sgb and hb stars , we present here an analysis similar to that described in section  [ ycnoms ] for ms stars , using a number of synthetic spectra over the wavelength range of interest ( i.  e. , @xmath73   ) .",
    "they were computed using the kurucz ( 1993 ) model atmospheres ( with the overshooting option switched off ) , and line lists from the kurucz cd - roms .",
    "although these lists may be incomplete , especially in the uv , and the models adopt the 1-dimensional approximation , the resulting model atmospheres are still useful for the present purposes , which consist of identifying the major spectroscopic features that can affect the photometry of stars in 47 tuc . in the rest of this discussion , we limit ourselves to consideration of differential effects between stars that should have very similar spectra unless their chemical compositions differ : a subgiant star with @xmath74  k and @xmath75 , and a red hb star with @xmath76  k and @xmath77 .",
    "one set of synthetic spectra was computed with the typical abundance pattern observed in metal - poor stars in the field , [ c / fe ] = [ n / fe ] = 0.0 , [ o / fe ] = 0.4 ; spectra computed with these parameters are called `` n - poor '' .",
    "they should mimic the composition of the stars that carretta et al.(2009a ) call primordial - generation .",
    "we computed another pair of spectra for the same atmospheric parameters , now with [ c / fe ] = @xmath380.2 , [ n / fe ] = + 1.3 , and [ o / fe ] = @xmath380.1 , but with the other element abundances the same as in the `` n - poor '' stars .",

    "figure  [ f : band ] compares a pair of synthetic spectra ( those corresponding to subgiant stars ) , and shows the transmissions of the filters .",
    "this figure shows that the differences between the `` n - poor '' and `` n - rich '' spectra are essentially due to different strengths of the molecular bands : the oh band ( in the wavelength range 26003200  ) , is stronger in `` n - poor '' stars and falls within the f275w band ; the nh band at @xmath71 3400   is stronger in the `` n - rich '' spectra and falls within the f336w band .",
    "the cn violet bands ( stronger in n - rich spectra ) at 3883    and 4216   , and the ch g - band ( stronger in n - poor spectra ) falls in the f390w band .",
    "the last two molecular bands are also within the f435w pass - band . as a consequence ,",
    "the flux predicted for both the f336w and the f390w bands is smaller for the `` n - rich '' spectra than for the `` n - poor '' ones . the difference is greater for the f336w band , where it can be as much as 0.1 mag .",
    "the opposite holds for the f275w band .",
    "abundance variations of c , n , o elements do not appreciably affect the stellar flux for passbands at longer wavelengths .",
    "we can now compare our theoretical values of three uv colors with the observed ones :    * @xmath19 : this color index is predicted to be larger ( redder ) for n - poor and smaller ( bluer ) for n - rich stars ; this is the combined effect of less oh absorption in the f275w band and more nh absorption in the f336w band in n - rich compared to n - poor stars .",
    "if n varies while he and mg do not , the predicted color difference for the abundances given above is 0.17 mag for the subgiant , and 0.19 mag for the red hb star .",
    "* @xmath48 : this index is larger ( redder ) for the n - rich and smaller ( bluer ) for the n - poor stars , again a result of stronger nh absorption in the f336w band . if there is again no difference in he and mg , the predicted color difference is 0.09 mag for the subgiant and 0.10 mag for the red hb star . *",
    "@xmath78 : this index is larger ( redder ) for the n - rich and smaller ( bluer ) for the n - poor star , again due to stronger nh and especially cn absorption in the f390w band , and less ch absorption in the f435w band . if there is no difference in he and mg , the predicted color difference is 0.05 mag for the subgiant and 0.07 mag for the red hb star .",
    "these predicted differences are indeed similar to those observed in the two - color diagram in panels _ b _ and _ c _ of fig .",
    "[ hbhst ] .",
    "it is of course a complication that additional differences are expected if the abundances of he and/or mg are also different .",
    "the f275w band includes the very strong resonance doublet of mg ii , so that the impact of mg is appreciable ( up to @xmath71 0.05  mag ) .",
    "the main effect of a helium difference is a change in the effective temperatures of the stars :  n - rich stars that are also he - rich are expected to be warmer and bluer . even a small temperature difference has a quite dramatic effect on the uv bands : a difference of 100  k ( corresponding to a change of @xmath71 0.07 in @xmath79 ) makes @xmath19 bluer by a further @xmath71 0.2 mag , and more than offsets the difference in @xmath80 color between n - rich and n - poor stars .",
    "such a large difference is clearly excluded by the photometry of 47 tuc , which on the whole agrees quite well with only a minimal variation in helium ( @xmath81 0.015 ) , as suggested in sect .",

    "but the same data were further analyzed by hartwick & mcclure ( 1980 ) , who found no evidence of differences in radial distribution of stars with different cn strength .",
    "norris & smith ( 1981 ) found cn - strong stars in the majority in the inner @xmath71 3 arcmin , a nearly equal fraction of cn - strong and cn - weak stars between @xmath71 3 and @xmath71 15 arcmin , and a predominance of cn - weak stars at larger radial distances .",
    "langer et al .  (",
    "1989 ) concluded that because of the small sample size the results of norris & freeman ( 1979 ) should be considered inconclusive .",
    "finally , briley ( 1997 ) studied the radial distribution of the cn - strong and cn - weak populations on the basis of @xmath71 300 rgb stars with radial distances larger than 4 arcmin .",
    "he found that the relative numbers of cn - rich and cn - poor stars are roughly constant within @xmath71 13 arcmin of the cluster center , while the distribution exterior to 13 arcmin is clearly biased toward cn - poor stars , thus confirming the radial gradient first detected by norris & freeman ( 1979 ) .",
    "an obvious advantage of photometric measurements is that we can study more stars and therefore get better statistics . in the following",

    "for the rgb and hb this fraction falls to about 60% in the outer parts of the cluster .",
    "thus the rgbb and hbb populations , which likely represent a second generation , appear to be more centrally concentrated .",
    "an integration of the @xmath82 population ratio , adopting a king model appropriate for 47 tuc , reveals that globally the _ first generation _",

    "the third population presumably makes up some small fraction of the parts that we call @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "such a global predominance of the second generation sets strong constraints on scenarios for the formation of multiple populations in gcs , and actually for the formation of gcs _ tout court_. the fact that the second generation is much more centrally concentrated has also been observed in other gcs ( such as @xmath3 centauri , sollima et al .",
    "2007 , bellini et al .  2009 ) and suggests that much of the first generation ( whatever it was ) might have been tidally stripped from the progenitor of 47 tuc .",

    "finally , the main properties of the two populations are summarized in table  [ popolazioni ] .",
    "we have analyzed a large set of _ hst _ and ground - based images of the galactic globular cluster ngc 104 ( 47 tuc ) in nine photometric bands , finding multiple sequences throughout the various cmds , from the main sequence all the way to the horizontal branch . exploiting this wealth of _ hst _ data to investigate the behavior of the multiple populations",
    "as seen in several different combinations of magnitudes and colors , we found that among the rainbow of possible cmds , those involving the f275w and f336w filters are particularly effective in separating components of otherwise entangled cluster populations .",
    "taking a cue from _ hst _ , we were able to construct a color system based on the @xmath56 band that exhibited a similarly effective separation of the populations in ground - based data .",
    "we found that the distribution of stars along the ms , sgb , rgb , and hb was in every case bimodal in the @xmath87 vs.  @xmath48 two - color diagram , and we finally put together the groups of stars that we had separated in this way , so as to draw a continuous connection between their successive evolutionary phases .    near the cluster center",
    "all evolutionary phases split into two near - parallel sequences , with the richer one making up about 80% of the cluster stars , and the poorer one the remaining 20% .",
    "wide - field ground - based photometry allowed us to identify and separate the two sub - populations at larger radial distances from the cluster center , with the result that the majority population is more centrally concentrated , but its relative fraction decreases outward and approaches 50/50 in the outskirts of the cluster .",
    "globally , the majority population accounts for @xmath83 of the whole population of 47 tuc , most of the remainder consisting of the minority population . radial gradients in the stellar populations of this cluster have been known for a long time , with a cn - strong population more centrally concentrated than the cn - weak one .",
    "this suggests that the numerically dominant population is cn - strong .",
    "along these same lines , we used cn band strengths and na and o abundances that are available from the literature for some rgb and hb stars of both populations , to investigate their chemical content .",
    "it appears that the more populous rgbb and hbb sequences consist of cn - strong / na - rich / o - poor stars , while the bulk of the cn - weak / na - poor / o - rich stars belong to the numerically poorer rgba and hba .    on the theoretical side , we calculated synthetic spectra of main - sequence stars with different chemical compositions , derived the corresponding colors for our filter set , and compared them with the observed colors in the two distinct populations .",
    "the colors of the minority population are well reproduced by stars with primordial helium abundance and an oxygen - rich / nitrogen - poor composition that is typical of halo stars of metallicity similar to that of 47 tuc . on the other hand ,",
    "the colors of the majority population stars are well reproduced by a composition in which nitrogen is greatly enhanced , along with a slightly increased helium , while carbon and oxygen are depleted .",
    "synthetic spectra for rgb and hb stars confirm this result .",
    "the most straightforward interpretation of these differences is that the minority population is the remnant of the first stellar generation , which formed out of the interstellar medium of its time , and shared its chemical composition .",
    "the chemical composition of the majority population , by contrast , carries the signatures of cno and proton - capture processing at high temperatures , such as depletion of oxygen in favor of nitrogen and sodium , accompanied by helium enhancement .",
    "therefore the majority population should be regarded as the second stellar generation of 47 tuc , which formed out of material that had been partly processed through stars of the first generation .",
    "since both populations share the same iron abundance , one can exclude from the enrichment history of the second - generation material any significant contribution by massive stars , exploding as core - collapse supernovae .",
    "this leaves intermediate - mass stars of the first generation as the obvious candidates for having processed the material that is now incorporated into the second generation , a view that is indeed widely entertained in the literature .",
    "furthermore , it is certainly striking that the second generation is today more populous than the first .",
    "this sets strong constraints on the nature of the progenitor of the present cluster 47 tuc , and on the initial mass of the first generation , which must have been one to two orders of magnitude more massive than the portion that is still bound to the cluster .",
    "finally , we must again remind the reader that besides the two populations that we have called first and second , we have found unmistakable evidence for the presence of a third population , including some @xmath2 of the stars , which we can distinguish it only on the sgb , but it appears to have the abundance distribution of the `` b '' population .",
    "this remains as a strident reminder that the stellar populations in 47 tuc are more complex than the two - generation picture that we have just sketched .",

    "<S> we suggest that the different strengths of molecular bands of oh , cn , ch and nh , falling in different photometric bands , are responsible for the color splits of the two populations . near the cluster center , in each portion of the color - magnitude diagram the population with primeval abundances makes up only @xmath0 of the stars , a fraction that increases outwards , approachng equality in the outskirts of the cluster , with a fraction @xmath1 averaged over the whole cluster . </S>",
