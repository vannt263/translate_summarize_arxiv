    "neutrinos are very elusive particles that are difficult to detect .",
    "even so , physicists have over the last decades successfully studied neutrinos from a wide variety of sources , either natural , such as the sun and cosmic objects , or manmade , such as nuclear power plants or accelerated beams .",
    "spectacular results have been obtained in the last few years for the flavour mixing of neutrinos obtained from atmospheric , solar , reactor and accelerator sources and interpreted in terms of the survival probabilities for the beautiful quantum phenomenon of neutrino oscillations @xcite . the weak interaction eigenstates @xmath12 @xmath13 are written in terms of mass eigenstates @xmath14 @xmath15 as @xmath16 , where @xmath17 are the mixing angles among the three neutrino families and @xmath8 is the @xmath18 violating phase .",
    "neutrino mass differences and the mixings for the atmospheric @xmath19 and solar @xmath20 sectors have thus been determined .",
    "the third connecting mixing @xmath21 is bounded as @xmath22 from the chooz reactor experiment @xcite . the third angle , @xmath23 , as well as the cp - violating phases @xmath8 , remain thus undetermined .",
    "besides the approved experiments double chooz @xcite , t2k @xcite and nova @xcite , a number of experimental facilities to significantly improve on present sensitivity have been discussed in the literature : neutrino factories ( neutrino beams from boosted - muon decays )  @xcite , superbeams ( very intense conventional neutrino beams )  @xcite improved reactor experiments  @xcite and more recently @xmath24-beams @xcite . the original standard scenario for beta beams with lower @xmath25 and short baseline @xmath4  km from cern to frejus with @xmath26 and @xmath27 ions could be improved using an electron capture facility for monochromatic neutrino beams @xcite .",
    "new proposals also include the high @xmath28 value @xmath29 and @xmath30 isotopes in a @xmath31 facility @xcite . in this paper",
    "we discuss the physics reach that a high energy facility for both beta beams @xcite and ec beams may provide with the expected sps upgrade at cern . in section  2",
    "we discuss the virtues of the suppressed oscillation channel @xmath32 in order to have access to the parameters @xmath23 and @xmath8 .",
    "the interest of energy dependence , as obtainable in the ec facility , is emphasized . in section  3",
    "we compare the beta beam capabilities at different energies and baselines using two ions , one for neutrinos , the other for antineutrinos . in section  4",
    "we present new results on the comparison between ( low energies , short baseline ) and ( high energies , long baseline ) configurations for an ec facility with a single ion .",
    "section  5 gives our conclusions and outlook .",
    "the observation of @xmath18 violation needs an experiment in which the emergence of another neutrino flavour is detected rather than the deficiency of the original flavour of the neutrinos . at the same time , the interference needed to generate cp - violating observables can be enhanced if both the atmospheric and solar components have a similar magnitude .",
    "this happens in the suppressed @xmath33 transition .",
    "the appearance probability @xmath34 as a function of the distance between source and detector @xmath35 is given by @xcite @xmath36 where @xmath37 .",
    "the three terms of eq .",
    "( [ prob ] ) correspond , respectively , to contributions from the atmospheric and solar sectors and their interference .",
    "as seen , the @xmath18 violating contribution has to include all mixings and neutrino mass differences to become observable .",
    "the four measured parameters @xmath38 and @xmath39 have been fixed throughout this paper to their mean values @xcite .",
    "neutrino oscillation phenomena are energy dependent ( see fig.[proba ] ) for a fixed distance between source and detector , and the observation of this energy dependence would disentangle the two important parameters : whereas @xmath21 gives the strength of the appearance probability , the @xmath18 phase acts as a phase - shift in the interference pattern .",
    "these properties suggest the consideration of a facility able to study the detailed energy dependence by means of fine tuning of a boosted monochromatic neutrino beam . as shown below , in an electron capture facility the neutrino energy is dictated by the chosen boost of the ion source and the neutrino beam luminosity is concentrated at a single known energy which may be chosen at will for the values in which the sensitivity for the @xmath40 parameters is higher .",
    "this is in contrast to beams with a continuous spectrum , where the intensity is shared between sensitive and non sensitive regions .",
    "furthermore , the definite energy would help in the control of both the systematics and the detector background . in the beams with a continuous spectrum",
    ", the neutrino energy has to be reconstructed in the detector . in water - cerenkov detectors ,",
    "this reconstruction is made from supposed quasielastic events by measuring both the energy and direction of the charged lepton .",
    "this procedure suffers from non - quasielastic background , from kinematic deviations due to the nuclear fermi momentum and from dynamical suppression due to exclusion effects @xcite .    from general arguments of cpt invariance and absence of absorptive parts",
    "the cp - odd probability is odd in time and then odd in the baseline l ( formally ) .",
    "vacuum oscillations are only a function of @xmath41 so that , at fixed @xmath42 , the cp - odd probability is odd in the energy ( formally ) .",
    "this proves that the study of neutrino oscillations in terms of neutrino energy will be able to separate out the cp phase @xmath8 from the mixing parameters .",
    "a control of this energy may be obtained from the choice of the boost in the ec facility with a single ion . in order for this concept to become operational it is necessary to combine it with the recent discovery of nuclei far from the stability line , having super allowed spin - isospin transitions to a giant gamow - teller resonance kinematically accessible @xcite .",
    "thus the rare - earth nuclei above @xmath43 have a small enough half - life for electron capture processes .",
    "this is in contrast with the proposal of ec beams with fully stripped long - lived ions @xcite .",
    "we discuss the option of short - lived ions @xcite .",
    "a first question to be answered is : is the sensitivity to cp violation and @xmath23 changing with energy at fixed baseline ?",
    "fixing the baseline to cern - frejus ( @xmath4  km ) @xcite , one notices that , for @xmath44 , the sensitivity to both @xmath23 and @xmath8 changes rather slowly because the flux at low energies in the continuous spectrum does not reduce significantly .",
    "then it is not advantageous to increase the neutrino energy unless the baseline is correspondingly scaled to remain close to the atmospheric oscillation maximum as suggested by the @xmath41 dependence .    with the present sps of cern the maximum energy reachable for the @xmath26 ion corresponds to @xmath45 .",
    "fixing this value of @xmath46 for both @xmath26 and @xmath27 we may ask : is the sensitivity to @xmath23 and @xmath8 changing with the baseline ?",
    "particularly for the cp phase @xmath8 , @xmath47  km is clearly favoured @xcite .",
    "there is neither an existing nor an envisaged laboratory at this particular distance from cern .    equipped with these previous results , it is of interest to make a comparison between the physics reach for two different beta beam setups . with the same @xmath46 for both neutrino and antineutrino sources , setup",
    "i corresponds to @xmath3 , @xmath4  km ( frejus ) , whereas setup ii is for @xmath5 , @xmath6  km ( canfranc ) .",
    "setup ii needs the upgrade of the sps until proton energies of @xmath48  gev .",
    "the associated determinations of @xmath23 and @xmath8 are presented in fig .",
    "[ fit - betabeams ] .",
    "the main conclusion is that setup ii is clearly better for the cp violating phase .",
    "not only the high energy setup provides a better precision , but it is able to resolve the degeneracies . in @xcite",
    "one may find the associated sensitivities of these setups for each parameter @xmath23 and @xmath8 . as a consequence ,",
    "a @xmath49 effort to design beta beams for the upgraded cern sps ( @xmath50  gev ) appears justified .",
    "for the setups i ) and ii ) , as explained in the text.,width=245 ]",
    "electron capture is the process in which an atomic electron is captured by a proton of the nucleus leading to a nuclear state of the same mass number @xmath51 , replacing the proton by a neutron , and a neutrino .",
    "its probability amplitude is proportional to the atomic wavefunction at the origin , so that it becomes competitive with the nuclear @xmath1 decay at high @xmath52 .",
    "kinematically , it is a two body decay of the atomic ion into a nucleus and the neutrino , so that the neutrino energy is well defined and given by the difference between the initial and final atomic masses @xmath53 minus the excitation energy of the final nuclear state . in general ,",
    "the high proton number @xmath52 nuclear beta - plus decay @xmath54 and electron - capture @xmath55 transitions are very `` forbidden '' , i.e. , disfavoured , because the energetic window open @xmath56 does not contain the important gamow - teller strength excitation seen in ( p , n ) reactions .",
    "there are a few cases , however , where the gamow - teller resonance can be populated ( see fig.[dy ] ) having the occasion of a direct study of the `` missing '' strength . for the rare - earth nuclei above @xmath43 , the filling of the intruder level",
    "@xmath57 for protons opens the possibility of a spin - isospin transition to the allowed level @xmath58 for neutrons , leading to a fast decay .",
    "our studies for neutrino beam preparation have used the @xmath59 ion with half live of 7.2 min , a branching ratio to neutrino channels of @xmath60 ( fully by ec ) and neutrino energy of @xmath61  mev in the c.m .",

    "the measured energy distribution as a function of angle @xmath65 and lorentz gamma @xmath66 of the ion at the moment of decay can be expressed as @xmath67 $ ] .",
    "the angle @xmath68 in the formula expresses the deviation between the actual neutrino detection and the ideal detector position in the prolongation of one of the long straight sections of the decay ring .",
    "the neutrinos are concentrated inside a narrow cone around the forward direction .",
    "if the ions are kept in the decay ring longer than the half - life , the energy distribution of the neutrino flux arriving to the detector in absence of neutrino oscillations is given by the master formula    @xmath69    with a dilation factor @xmath70 .",
    "it is remarkable that the result is given only in terms of the branching ratio and the neutrino energy and independent of nuclear models . in eq .",
    "( [ master ] ) , @xmath71 is the total number of ions decaying to neutrinos . for an optimum choice with @xmath72 around the first oscillation maximum , eq .",
    "( [ master ] ) says that lower neutrino energies @xmath64 in the proper frame give higher neutrino fluxes .",
    "the number of events will increase with higher neutrino energies as the cross section increases with energy . to conclude , in the forward direction the neutrino energy is fixed by the boost @xmath73 , with the entire neutrino flux concentrated at this energy . as a result",
    ", such a facility will measure the neutrino oscillation parameters by changing the @xmath46 s of the decay ring ( energy dependent measurement ) and there is no need of energy reconstruction in the detector .    for the study of the physics reach associated with such a facility , we combine two different energies for the same @xmath59 ion using two setups . in all cases we consider @xmath74 decaying ions / year , a water cerenkov detector with fiducial mass of @xmath75  kton and both appearance ( @xmath76 ) and disappearance ( @xmath77 ) events .",
    "setup i is associated with a five year run at @xmath9 ( close to the minimum energy to avoid atmospheric neutrino background ) plus a five year run at @xmath10 ( the maximum energy achievable at present sps ) , with a baseline @xmath4  km from cern to frejus .",
    "the results for setup i are going to be compared with those for setup ii , associated with a five year run at @xmath10 plus a five year run at @xmath11 ( the maximum achievable at the upgraded sps with proton energy of @xmath48  gev ) , with a baseline @xmath6  km from cern to canfranc .    for the setup",

    "as observed , the principle of an energy dependent measurement ( illustrated here with two energies ) is working to separate out the two parameters . with this configuration",

    "qualitatively , one notices that the precision in the mixing is somewhat ( but no much ) better than that in setup i. on the contrary , the precision reachable for the cp phase is much better than that for setup i. one should emphasize that this improvement in the cp phase has been obtained with the neutrino channel only , using two appropriate different energies .",

    "ii it could happen that the connecting mixing @xmath23 is already known from the approved experiments for second generation neutrino oscillations , like double chooz , t2k and nova . to illustrate the gain obtainable in the sensitivity to discover cp violation from the previous knowledge of @xmath23 we present in fig .",

    "\\2 ) the best @xmath41 in order to have a higher sensitivity to the mixing @xmath7 is not the same than that for the cp phase . like the phase - shifts , the presence of @xmath8 is easier to observe when the energy of the neutrino beams enters into the region of the second oscillation .",
    "the mixing is better seen around the first oscillation maximum , instead .    in particular , setup ii in ec beams ,",
    "i.e. , with @xmath89 between @xmath90 and @xmath75 and a baseline @xmath6  km ( canfranc ) , has an impressive sensitivity to cp violation , reaching precisions around @xmath86 , for @xmath82  cl , or better ( if some knowledge on the value of @xmath23 is already established ) .",
