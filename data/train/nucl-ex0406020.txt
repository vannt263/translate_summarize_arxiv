    "in free space , a @xmath8 particle decays dominantly associated with a pion in the final state as @xmath8 @xmath9 . in the case of @xmath8 bound in a nucleus , a @xmath8 hypernucleus , @xmath8 is not only possible to decay as in the free space ( mesonic weak decay ) , but is also able to stimulate a nucleon in the nucleus as @xmath8``@xmath10''@xmath11 ( non - mesonic weak decay , nmwd ) .",
    "the nmwd gives a unique opportunity to study the weak interaction between baryons , because this strangeness non - conserving process is purely attributed to the weak interaction .    in the nmwd of a @xmath8 hypernucleus",
    ", there are two decay channels , @xmath12 @xmath13 ( @xmath6 ) and @xmath14 @xmath15 ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "the ratio of those decay widths , @xmath4/@xmath6 , is an important observable used to study the isospin structure of the nmwd mechanism . for the past 40 years",
    ", there has been a longstanding puzzle that the experimental @xmath4/@xmath6 ratio disagrees with that of theoretical calculations based on the most natural and simplest model , the one - pion exchange model ( ope ) . in this model ,",
    "the @xmath16 reaction is expressed as a pion absorption process after the @xmath17 decay inside the nucleus .",
    "since the ope process is tensor - dominant and the tenser transition of the initial @xmath18 pair in the @xmath19-state requires the final @xmath20 pair to have isospin zero , the @xmath21 ratio in ope process becomes close to 0 .",
    "however , previous experimental results have indicated a large @xmath21 ratio ( @xmath221 ) @xcite .",
    "this large discrepancy between the ope - model predictions and the experimental results has stimulated many theoretical studies : the heavy meson exchange model @xcite , the direct quark model @xcite and the two - nucleon ( 2@xmath10 ) induced model ( @xmath23 ) @xcite .",
    "after k. sasaki @xmath24 pointed out an error about the sign of the kaon exchange amplitudes in 2000 @xcite , those theoretical values of the @xmath21 ratio have increased to the level of 0.4@xmath220.7 @xcite .    on the other hand",
    ", the experimental data still have large errors ( @xmath21 = 0.93 @xmath25 0.55 for @xmath0he @xcite ) , and it is hard to draw a definite conclusion on the @xmath21 ratio . so far , several nucleon energy spectra from hypernuclear decay have been reported .",
    "most of the experiments measured only the proton energy spectra , because of the difficulty in detecting neutrons .",
    "the @xmath21 ratio has been estimated through a comparison of the measured proton spectrum with that of the intra - nuclear cascade calculation by changing the @xmath21 ratio @xcite . in this method , there are large uncertainties due to the indirect evaluation of neutrons .",
    "recently , the neutron energy spectra from @xmath1c and @xmath26y were measured with high statistics @xcite . for @xmath1c ,",
    "the @xmath21 ratio was extracted from the neuron - to - proton yield ratio , @xmath27 , estimated by the neutron energy spectrum combined with a proton energy spectrum measured in another experiment @xcite .",
    "the energy loss of protons in the target , however , was not able to be corrected for .",
    "since there were ambiguities coming from different detection energy thresholds in the two measurements , the value might be affected by a large systematic error .",
    "we therefore simultaneously measured the neutron and proton spectra from the decay of @xmath8 hypernuclei with a proton energy loss correction , and with much higher statistics over those of previous experiments .",
    "when we compare the `` measured '' @xmath21 ratio with that obtained in theoretical calculations , the most serious technical problem was a treatment of the re - scattering effect in the residual nucleus , the so - called final state interaction ( fsi ) . the nucleon energy spectrum emitted from the two - body nmwd process , @xmath16 , must originally have a broad peak at half of the q - value ( @xmath22 76 mev ) .",
    "the fsi effect distorts the nucleon spectra enhancing the low energy region , in which the strength of the effect depends on the mass number of the hypernuclei . in order to minimize the fsi effect , we selected a light @xmath19-shell hypernucleus , @xmath0he . in the @xmath19-shell hypernucleus",
    ", initial relative @xmath18 states must be @xmath28 states , whereas in a @xmath29-shell hypernucleus it is possible to be @xmath30 states . according to ref .",
    "@xcite , the transitions coming from the @xmath30 states were predicted to be small , though we need experimental confirmation for that . in order to investigate the @xmath29-wave effect",
    ", we also performed the same experiment for a typical light @xmath29-shell hypernucleus , @xmath1c . in this paper , we show those energy spectra for both hypernuclei and present the neuron - to - proton yield ratios , @xmath27 , with a high energy threshold ( 60 mev ) in order to get rid of the contribution from the fsi effect",
    ".    on the other hand , the nucleon yields in the low energy region should be sensitive to the strength of the fsi effect .",
    "in the proton measurement there is a cutoff energy , typically at 30 @xmath22 40 mev , due to the energy loss inside the target and the detector , whereas in the neutron measurement we have experienced sensitivity in the whole energy region . in this paper",
    ", we also show the mass number dependence of the `` neutron '' energy spectra for a = 5 and 12 , with that for a = 89 @xcite , which provides valuable information to investigate the fsi effect .",
    "the possible existence of a multi - nucleon induced process in which the q - value can be distributed over three or more nucleons in the final state has been discussed theoretically ( such as 2@xmath10-induced process ) , though there has been no experimental evidence so far ; the nucleons emitted from this process should also distribute in the low energy region .",
    "thus , the whole shape of the neutron energy spectrum also brings useful knowledge on the multi - nucleon induced nmwd mechanism .",
    "the present experiments ( kek - ps e462/e508 ) were carried out at the 12-gev proton synchrotron ( ps ) in the high energy accelerator research organization ( kek ) .",
    "hypernuclei , @xmath0he and @xmath1c , were produced via the ( @xmath2,@xmath3 ) reaction at 1.05 gev/@xmath31 on @xmath32li and @xmath33c targets , respectively . since the ground state ( g.s . ) of @xmath34li is above the threshold of @xmath0he @xmath35 , the g.s .",
    "promptly decays into @xmath0he emitting a low - energy proton .",
    "the @xmath36li ( @xmath2,@xmath3 ) @xmath34li reaction was therefore employed to produce @xmath0he .",
    "the hypernuclear mass spectra were calculated by reconstructing the momenta of incoming @xmath2 and outgoing @xmath3 using a beam - line spectrometer composed of the qqdqq system and the superconducting kaon spectrometer ( sks ) @xcite , respectively .",
    "particles emitted from the decays of @xmath8 hypernuclei were detected by the decay - particle detection system , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : e462setup ] .",
    "it was composed of plastic scintillation counters ( t1 , t2 , t3 and t4 ) and a multi - wire drift chamber ( pdc ) .",
    "the neutral particles , neutrons and gammas , were identified by means of the time - of - flight ( tof ) technique between t1 and t4 ; in addition , t3 was used as a veto counter in order to reject charged particles .",
    "the charged particles , protons and charged pions , were identified by utilizing @xmath37 on t2 , total energy deposit on sequentially fired counters ( t2 , t3 and t4 ) , and the tof between t2 and t3 .",
    "their trajectories were measured by pdc .",
    "figure [ fig : ex ] shows the inclusive excitation - energy spectra of @xmath34li and @xmath1c .",
    "peak is clearly seen in our excitation spectra for both hypernuclei .",
    "we selected events from the hypernuclear production by gating the g.s .",
    "peak , as shown in the figure .",
    "the yields of @xmath0he and @xmath1c are , respectively , about 4.6 @xmath38 10@xmath39 and 6.2 @xmath38 10@xmath39 , which were one order - of - magnitude higher than those of previous experiments .",

    "peak ; the background for @xmath0he and @xmath1c within the g.s .",
    "gate were estimated to be as small as 8% and 3% , respectively .",

    "since @xmath45 can not be determined for each event individually , we replaced @xmath45 with the mean lifetime of the hypernuclei to avoid a systematic energy shift in the neutron energy spectra . here , we used the lifetimes of @xmath46 ps for @xmath0he and @xmath47 ps for @xmath1c , improved through the lifetime analysis of the present experiment @xcite .",

    "it seems that the neutron spectra for both hypernuclei have a similar shape to those of protons above the proton energy threshold of 30 mev , and the neutron yields were about twice higher than those of protons .",
    "thanks to the event - by - event energy - loss correction for proton , we can directly compare the neutron energy spectra with those of the protons at the same energy threshold .",
    "captypefigure    it should be noted that the partial decay rate of the @xmath0he @xmath72 process , which emits a monochromatic high - energy neutron ( @xmath22 135 mev ) , is not negligible .",

    "though it is hard to observe the corresponding peak due to the limited resolution , @xmath74 mev ( fwhm ) at such a high - energy region , one can see an appreciable neutron yield at the high - energy region ( 120 @xmath22 150 mev ) in the neutron spectra of @xmath0he , which can be considered to be the events from this process .    the fsi process and the possible multi - nucleon induced process ( such as the 2@xmath10-induced process ) tend to enhance the low - energy region in the nucleon energy spectra . in order to reduce the effects from those processes",
    ", we set the energy threshold to be as high as 60 mev , which is near to half of the q - value ( @xmath22 76 mev ) of the @xmath16 decay process .",
    "the ratios of the yields between neutrons and protons , @xmath27 , for @xmath0he and @xmath1c above 60 mev , were obtained respectively as follows : @xmath75 where we set the upper energy limit of 110 mev only for @xmath0he in order to avoid the contamination from the @xmath0he @xmath72 process .",
    "systematic errors are predominantly coming from an ambiguity of the absolute neutron detection efficiency ( @xmath226% ) . due to the similar spectrum shape for neutrons and protons , the @xmath27 ratios of both hypernuclei are quite stable for a change of the energy thresholds . recently ,",

    "the result excludes earlier experimental results that the @xmath21 is close to unity @xcite .",

    "one is a three - body reaction in which the q - value can be distributed over three nucleons in the final state .",
    "the other is based on the correlated two - nucleon absorption of a virtual pion emitted from the weak vertex of @xmath85 , in which the energy of the emitted nucleon is small , since the virtual pion is close to on - shell @xcite . since most of the q - value in this 2@xmath10-induced process",
