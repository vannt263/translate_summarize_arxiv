    "one of the most promising means by which to observe the high redshift universe in the cosmic `` dark ages '' is through the 21-cm wavelength hyperfine transition of the neutral hydrogen that is abundant prior to reionization ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". motivated by the prospect of new radio telescopes that will be able to observe such a signal , several specific observational techniques have been proposed . among these",
    "are the angular fluctuations on the sky ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite  isfm hereafter ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , features in the frequency spectrum of the signal averaged over a substantial patch of the sky and studies of absorption features in the spectra of bright , high - redshift radio sources ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .    for most of these techniques , with the exception of foreground absorption against bright radio sources ,",
    "the 21-cm signal must be distinguished from the cmb , which is only possible if the 21-cm level population corresponds to a spin temperature @xmath6 , which differs from the temperature , @xmath7 , of the cmb . since radiative excitation and",
    "stimulated emission of this transition by cmb photons tends to drive the value of @xmath6 toward @xmath7 , some competing mechanism must exist to decouple @xmath6 from @xmath7 .",
    "there are two main physical mechanisms by which the spin temperature is decoupled from the cmb temperature : `` ly@xmath5 pumping , '' or absorption of radiation with a wavelength in the ly@xmath5 transition , followed by decay into one of the hyperfine levels of the ground state ( the `` field - wouthuysen effect '' ",
    "@xcite ) , and spin exchange during collisions between neutral hydrogen atoms @xcite .",
    "the efficiency of ly@xmath5 pumping depends upon the intensity of the uv radiation field at the ly@xmath5 transition , whereas the efficiency of collisional coupling depends upon the local gas density and temperature .    for @xmath8 , these mechanisms are ineffective at decoupling @xmath6 from @xmath7 , since the kinetic temperature of the gas , @xmath9 , is coupled to @xmath7 by inverse compton scattering , and sources of uv radiation have not yet formed to initiate ly@xmath5 pumping . at @xmath10 , however , @xmath9 drops below @xmath7 and , for @xmath11 , gas at the mean density is sufficiently dense for collisions to couple @xmath6 to @xmath9 . during the `` dark ages , '' therefore ,",
    "when there is no ly@xmath5 pumping , the mean 21-cm signal against the cmb will be zero at @xmath8 , then in absorption at @xmath12 .    at lower redshift , collisions become negligible for gas at or below the cosmic mean density , and such gas becomes invisible until its spin temperature is again decoupled from the cmb by ly@xmath5 pumping due to an early uv background from the first stars and quasars . even though collisional decoupling is ineffective for @xmath13 for gas at the _ mean _ density , gas in overdense and/or heated regions can still be collisionally - decoupled .",
    "in particular , the gas density within `` minihalos ''  virialized halos of dark and baryonic matter with masses @xmath14 and virial temperatures @xmath15 which are too low to collisionally ionize their h atoms  is sufficiently high so as to decouple its gas spin temperature from the cmb , with @xmath16 in general , causing it to appear in emission ( isfm ) .",
    "isfm predicted the mean and angular fluctuations of the corresponding 21-cm signal by a semi - analytical calculation which integrated the equation of transfer through individual minihalos of different mass at different redshifts ( @xmath17 ) and summed these individual halo contributions over the evolving statistical distribution of minihalo masses in the @xmath3cdm universe .",
    "@xcite extended these results to include non - linear biasing effects .",
    "these authors concluded that the fluctuations in intensity across the sky created by minihalos were likely to be observable by the next generation of low - frequency radio telescopes .",
    "such observations could confirm the basic cdm paradigm and constrain the shape and amplitude of the power spectrum at much smaller scales than previously possible .",
    "since then , @xcite have suggested that shocked , overdense gas in the diffuse igm ( prior to the onset of ly@xmath5 radiative pumping ) is also capable of producing a 21-cm emission signal and that this igm contribution to the mean signal will dominate over that from gas inside minihalos .",
    "their conclusion is based on an extension of the press - schechter approximation ( @xcite ) that is used to determine the fraction of baryons in the diffuse igm that are hot and dense enough to produce a 21-cm emission signal .",
    "we will address this question here .    in order to quantify these effects ,",
    "we have computed the 21-cm signal both from minihalos and the igm at @xmath4 for the first time using high - resolution cosmological n - body and hydrodynamic simulations of structure formation .",
    "we have assumed a flat , @xmath3cdm cosmology with matter density parameter @xmath18 , cosmological constant @xmath19 , baryon density @xmath20 , hubble constant @xmath21 , linearly - extrapolated @xmath22 and the `` untilted '' harrison - zeldovich primordial power spectrum .    in this paper",
    ", we present detailed , high - resolution gas and n - body simulations which predict the 21-cm signal at @xmath23 due to collisional decoupling from the cmb before the uv background is strong enough to make decoupling due to ly@xmath5 pumping important . because the ly@xmath5 pumping efficiency is expected to fluctuate strongly until enough sources form to make the efficiency uniform ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the results presented here will also be relevant for isolated patches of the universe during reionization itself , which would depend upon the location and abundance of the first sources of uv radiation .",
    "within such regions , we focus on properly resolving the gasdynamics of structure formation at small scales through the use of high resolution gasdynamic and n - body simulations .",
    "we test the semi - analytical prediction of the halo model of isfm for the contribution to the mean signal from gas in minihalos , and investigate the extent to which igm gas may provide a non - negligible contribution to the total fluctuating signal , as suggested by @xcite .",

    "we have shown , in this section , that the 21-cm differential brightness temperature @xmath99 can be calculated by a simple average of individual contributions from gas at different locations in a simulation box , as long as optical depths are small ( eq . [ [ eq - proof ] ] ) .",
    "care needs to be taken , however , when gas achieves considerable optical depth . in ",
    "[ sub : minihalos ] , we describe how one can calculate the signal from optically - thick media , which are mostly located inside minihalos .",
    "minihalos which start to emerge at @xmath85 have temperature and density high enough to produce a significant emission signal ( isfm ) .",
    "as the optical depth through each minihalo is not negligible , the full radiative transfer equation ( eq .",
    "[ [ eq - rad - trans ] ] ) should be solved through individual minihalos .",
    "once individual halo contribution @xmath100 is obtained for each given halo mass @xmath101 , one can calculate @xmath102 from all the minihalos at redshift @xmath30 by integrating over the halo mass function @xmath103 : @xmath104 where @xmath105 , @xmath106 , and @xmath107 refer to the parameters of the individual virialized halo , @xmath108 , @xmath106 is the face - averaged differential brightness temperature at line center , and @xmath107 is the projected surface area of the halo .",
    "isfm based their calculation on the nonsingular , truncated isothermal sphere ( tis ) model for cdm halos by @xcite and @xcite , in which the halo density profile and virial temperature are fully specified by the halo mass and redshift , and the press - schechter ( 1974 ) mass function , which determines the number density of halos at a given redshift .",
    "the minimum minihalo mass @xmath109 is set by the jeans mass @xmath110 for @xmath111 , isfm used the mass for which the virial temperature is @xmath112 : @xmath113 the neutral baryonic fraction of halos with mass above @xmath111 is uncertain , because hydrogen will be partially ionized due to collisions and photoionization by internal sources .",
    "thus , the mass range from @xmath109 to @xmath111 naturally defines the mass range of minihalos which are fully neutral .",
    "figure  [ fig - anal ] depicts the predicted signals from unperturbed gas as well as from minihalos .",
    "we show results for both the press - schechter and the sheth - tormen mass functions ( @xcite ) .",
    "we have run series of cosmological n - body and gasdynamic simulations to derive the effect of gravitational collapse and the hydrodynamics on the predicted 21 cm signal from high redshift .",
    "our computational box has a comoving size of @xmath114 , which is optimal for adequately resolving both the minihalos and the small - scale structure - formation shocks .",
    "we used the code described in @xcite , which uses the particle - mesh ( pm ) scheme for calculating the gravity evolution and an eulerian total variation diminishing ( tvd ) scheme for hydrodynamics .",
    "we generated our initial conditions for the gas and dark matter distributions using the publicly available software cosmics @xcite .",
    "the n - body / hydro code uses an @xmath115 grid and @xmath116 dark matter particles . in order to check the convergence of our results we ran simulations at different spatial resolutions , with grid sizes",
    "@xmath117 , @xmath118 , @xmath119 , and @xmath120 , which we denote by c1 , c2 , c3 , and c4 , respectively .",
    "we report our results in   [ sec : result ] based on our highest - resolution simulation c4 and discuss the convergence of the results in   [ conv_sect ] .",
    "after the decoupling of cmb photons from the baryonic gas , the igm gas cools adiabatically due to cosmic expansion ( eq . [ [ eq - tk - igm ] ] ) .",
    "equation ( [ eq - tk - igm ] ) agrees , for instance , with the solution to the equation ( 1 ) in @xcite which describes how @xmath121 evolves exactly .",
    "this temperature , @xmath122 , was used in the simulation to set the minimum temperature of baryonic gas , to avoid negative temperatures .",
    "if a gas cell is cooled below @xmath122 , its temperature is set back to @xmath122 .",
    "such a temperature `` floor '' may overestimate the gas temperature of underdense regions , but because of their low density and temperature , @xmath123 is small in these regions .",
    "this implies that the spin temperature @xmath6 would be very close to @xmath7 , and their contribution to @xmath124 would also be negligible , whether the kinetic temperature @xmath9 is calculated accurately or not .",
    "in addition to the total 21-cm signal from our simulations , @xmath125 , we are also interested in the relative contribution of the virialized minihalos and the igm to the total signal , the sum of which gives the total 21-cm signal , @xmath126 .",
    "first , we calculate the total mean signal as a simple average over the simulation cells , @xmath127 .",
    "the minihalo contribution is given by @xmath128 , where @xmath129 is the fraction of the dm mass in a cell @xmath130 which is part of a halo .",
    "the igm contribution can then be obtained as @xmath131    in order to calculate the minihalo contribution to the total differential brightness temperature , @xmath132 , one needs to first identify the halos in the simulation volume .",
    "we identified the halos using a friends - of - friends ( fof ) algorithm @xcite with a linking length parameter of @xmath133 .",
    "the fof algorithm applies to the dark matter",
    "n - body particles , rather than the gas in grid cells .",
    "once this halo catalogue is processed for each time - slice of our n - body results , the baryonic component of each halo is identified for the grid cells of the hydrodynamics simulation which are contained within the volume of the halos in our fof catalogue .",
    "we do this as follows .",
    "first , the density in each cell contributed by each dm particle is determined by the triangular - shaped cloud assignment scheme .",
    "for each cell in which mass is contributed by the dm particles of a given halo , the gaseous baryonic component in that cell is assumed to contribute a fraction @xmath129 of its mass given by the fraction of the total dm mass in that cell which is attributed to the halo dm particles .",
    "accordingly , each cell @xmath130 contributes an amount @xmath134 to the signal attributed to halo gas , while @xmath135 is assumed to be the signal from the igm outside of the halo , where @xmath136 is calculated from the cell as a whole .",
    "our numerical simulations have sufficiently high resolution to find all halos in the computational box and the large - scale structure formation shocks , but not to resolve the internal structure of the minihalos themselves .",
    "however , as isfm have shown , in order to obtain the correct 21-cm signal from minihalos one needs to do a full radiative transfer calculation through each individual minihalo density profile since , unlike the igm gas , minihalos have a non - negligible optical depth at the 21-cm line .",
    "hence , we can refine our estimate of the minihalo contribution to the total 21-cm signal by combining our numerical halo catalogers with the semi - analytic calculation of individual minihalo contribution as found by isfm . in their approach , as described in   [ sub : minihalos ] , the gas density of each minihalo is assumed to follow a tis profile @xcite , radiative transfer calculations are performed to determine the @xmath124 for different impact parameters , and , finally , the face - averaged @xmath124 is calculated ( see isfm , for details ) .",
    "the halo mass function , @xmath103 , is provided by the halo catalogue we construct from the simulation .",
    "each individual halo contribution , @xmath137 , depends on its mass and redshift of formation ( isfm ) .",
    "once we calculate @xmath137 , we then obtain the halo contribution using equation  ( [ eq - dtb ] ) .",
    "in this section , we describe the results from our simulations . in figure",
    "[ maps ] we show ( unfiltered ) maps of the differential brightness temperature obtained directly from our numerical data for our highest - resolution simulation ( c4 ) , as described in   [ sec : calculation ] .",
    "we show the total signal , as well as the separate contributions from minihalos and igm , derived as we described in   [ sec : numerical - simulations ] , at redshifts @xmath138 , 20 , and 10 . at @xmath138 ,",
    "the earliest redshift shown ( top row ) , most of the diffuse igm gas is still in the quasi - linear regime and cold , thus largely in absorption against the cmb . at redshift @xmath139 ( middle row ) , the diffuse gas is still largely in absorption , while the ( relatively few ) halos that have already collapsed are strongly in emission .",
    "the combination of the two contributions creates a complex , patchy emission / absorption map , and absorption and emission partially cancel each other in the total mean signal . finally , at @xmath140 ( bottom row ) , including its diffuse component , gas heated above @xmath7 is widespread leading to a net emission against the cmb .",
    "the bulk of this 21-cm emission comes from the high - density knots and filaments .",
    "although both the halo and igm contributions come from roughly the same regions , the minihalo emission is significantly more clustered , while the igm emission is quite diffuse .    in figure",
    "[ fig - accudelt ] , we have plotted the volume - weighted probability distribution functions ( pdfs ) for the gas density @xmath141 and the differential brightness temperature contributions @xmath82 as functions of each other .",
    "the pdfs for gas density show that , while the highest overdensities ( @xmath142 ) are typically found inside minihalos and the lower overdensities ( @xmath143 ) and underdensities ( @xmath144 ) are typically associated with the igm , there is some overlap of the distributions for these two components .",
    "a small fraction of the volume contains lower density minihalo gas and higher density igm gas .",
    "however , the cumulative distributions show that these volumes hardly affect the total mean brightness temperature contributed by each component . similarly",
    ", the pdfs for the brightness temperature show that , while the volume which contributes the highest brightness temperatures is predominantly inside minihalos and that which contributes the lower brightness temperatures is predominantly located in the igm , there is , once again , some overlap of the pdfs . a small part of the igm volume exhibits high brightness temperature , while a small part of the minihalo volume shows low brightness temperature . once again",
    ", however , the cumulative distributions show that these regions hardly affect the total mean brightness temperatures contributed by each component .    in figure  [ fig-0.25-numerical",
    "] , we quantify the relative contributions of the minihalos and diffuse igm to the total mean 21-cm signal averaged over the whole computational box and their evolution .",
    "the evolution roughly follows the naive analytical estimates , as was shown in figure  [ fig - anal ] .",
    "the total signal is deep in absorption , with @xmath145 mk at @xmath146 .",
    "the 21-cm signal is completely dominated by the igm contribution at this stage .",
    "the absorption signal follows the analytical prediction for the unperturbed universe in ",
    "[ sub : unperturbed ] well , since the density fluctuations are still small and the uniform - density assumption is reasonably accurate .",
    "the absorption continually decreases as significant nonlinear structures start forming and portions of the gas became heated due to this structure formation .",
    "the net signal goes into emission after redshift @xmath147 , reaching up to @xmath148 mk by @xmath149 .",
    "the emission signal at @xmath150 is due to both collapsed halos and the clumpy , hot igm gas . in terms of their relative contributions ,",
    "the minihalos dominate over the diffuse igm at all times when the overall signal is in emission , below @xmath151 .",
    "we find that the relative contributions to the total signal , @xmath152 where @xmath153 means either `` halo '' or `` igm , '' is nearly constant over two different redshift regimes : for @xmath154 , @xmath155 , while for @xmath156 , @xmath157 . in the transition region , @xmath158 the relative contributions exhibit more complex behavior , approximately canceling each other out , resulting in a total signal which is close to zero .      as we discussed in ",
    "[ sub : improvements ] , we can improve our purely numerical estimate of the minihalo 21-cm signal by replacing each halo s flux with the value obtained by detailed radiative transfer calculations .",
    "we obtain the total minihalo signal from equation  ( [ eq - dtb ] ) , with the theoretical mass function @xmath103 replaced by the actual , numerical halo catalogue obtained from our simulations , and the individual minihalo contributions , @xmath137 , calculated by modeling each halo as a tis .",
    "we find that the resulting 21-cm signal from halos is stronger than the `` raw '' numerical signal obtained directly from the simulated halos and dominates the overall emission signal even more ( fig .",
    "[ fig-0.25-improved ] ) .",
    "this is despite the fact that our consideration of the more centrally - concentrated analytical density profiles increases the optical depth of each halo .",
    "we attribute this non - intuitive behavior to the fact that the density profiles of the minihalos found in our simulations are not fully resolved . by modeling the halo density profiles in detail ,",
    "the local density inside halos is boosted , which significantly increases the coupling constant @xmath123 , which , in turn , increases the total emission signal , even though the optical depth through each halo also increases simultaneously .",
    "note that we use the same population of halos for both estimates , and only the internal halo properties are modified .    in figure  [ fig - conv_halo ]",
    ", we show the total minihalo collapsed fraction obtained from the simulations compared to that from the theoretical ps and st halo mass functions .",
    "we also show the minihalo contribution to the total differential brightness temperature signal .",
    "we see that the collapsed fraction in minihalos in our simulation roughly agrees with the analytical predictions , mostly lying between the ps and st results . on the other hand , the minihalo contribution to the total 21-cm background obtained directly from the simulation is below the theoretical predictions based on either ps or st mass functions .",
    "the agreement is restored , however , when we replace each minihalo contribution to the total flux by its analytically - modeled value .",
    "this , once again , underscores the importance of resolving the internal halo structure for correct predictions of their 21-cm emission .",
    "we now compare cases c1 , c2 , c3 , and c4 to check the robustness of our results with respect to numerical convergence . in figure",
    "[ fig - conv ] , we show the differential brightness temperature signals for our three lower - resolution simulations , c1 , c2 and c3 , in terms of the signal obtained from our highest resolution simulation , c4 .",
    "we show the total signal , as well as each separate contribution , from either the halos or the igm gas . at @xmath154",
    "most of the gas density fluctuations are still linear , and a change in the resolution barely affects the results .",
    "thus a modest - resolution simulation , or even the analytical estimate for an unperturbed igm , suffices to obtain reliable results . in contrast , at lower redshifts ( @xmath159 ) the results depend strongly on the resolution . the low - resolution simulations c1 and c2 underestimate the resulting 21-cm signal significantly , by factors of up to a few .",
    "the results from these simulations improve somewhat at lower redshifts , below @xmath140 , but results are still below the ones from c4 by @xmath160 and @xmath161 for simulations c1 and c2 , respectively .",
    "this is true for either the minihalo , igm or the total signal .",
    "the results from our medium - resolution simulation c3 , on the other hand , are much closer to the ones from the high - resolution simulation c4 , with the two generally agreeing to better than 10% .",
    "this indicates convergence of our results to within a few per cent for simulation c4 .",
    "such behavior could be navely expected , since at @xmath159 non - linear structures , both collapsed halos and mildly nonlinear , shocked igm gas , form in abundance at the scales we are investigating , and thus high resolution is required to resolve these properly , as our simulations confirm .",
    "the relative contributions of the minihalo and the igm signals , on the other hand , show a more robust convergence . in all cases of different resolutions , we find that the minihalo signal dominates the igm signal at @xmath162 while the igm signal dominates the minihalo signal at @xmath154 .",
    "for the purely numerical result , the relative contribution of minihalos to the emission signal is about 70% at @xmath163 , peaks to 100% at @xmath164 , and drops to 50% at @xmath165 . the exact value of the transition redshift varies slightly with resolution . for @xmath166",
    ", minihalos contribute @xmath167 of the emission signal . for the case of semi - analytical calculation of the minihalo contribution based on the simulated halo catalogues ,",
    "the relative contribution to the emission signal is slightly higher , @xmath168 .",
    "we have run a set of cosmological n - body and hydrodynamic simulations of the evolution of dark matter and baryonic gas at high redshift ( @xmath169 ) . with the assumption that radiative feedback effects from the first light sources are negligible , we calculated the mean differential brightness temperature of the redshifted 21-cm background at each redshift .",
    "the mean global signal is in absorption against the cmb above @xmath170 and in overall emission below @xmath171 . at @xmath154 ,",
    "the density fluctuations of the igm gas are largely linear , and their absorption signal is well approximated by the one that results from assuming uniform gas at the mean adiabatically - cooled igm temperature . at @xmath159 , nonlinear structures become common , both minihalos and clumpy , hot , mildly nonlinear igm , resulting in an overall emission at 21-cm with differential brightness temperature of order a few mk .    by identifying the halos in our simulations , we were able to separate and compare the relative contributions of the halos and the igm gas to the total signal .",
    "we find that the emission from minihalos dominates over that from the igm outside minihalos , for @xmath13 .",
    "in particular , the emission from minihalos contributes about @xmath172 of the total emission signal at @xmath173 , peaking at 100% at @xmath164 , and balancing the absorption by the igm gas at @xmath165 .",
    "in contrast , the absorption by cold igm gas dominates the total signal for @xmath154 .",
    "these results appear to contradict the suggestion by @xcite , that the 21-cm emission signal would be dominated by the contribution of shocked gas in the diffuse igm .",
    "they used the press - schechter formalism to estimate the fraction of the igm outside of minihalos , which is shock - heated , by adopting a spherical infall model for the growth of density fluctuations and assuming that all gas inside the turn - around radius is shock - heated .",
    "this method is apparently not accurate enough to describe the filamentary nature of structure formation in the igm .    on the other hand ,",
    "our results are consistent with the analytical estimates of the mean 21-cm emission signal from minihalos by isfm .",
    "this indicates that the statistical prediction of the collapsed and virialized regions identified as minihalos by the press - schechter formalism ( or its refinement in terms of the st formula ) , with virial temperatures @xmath174 , with halos characterized individually by the tis model , is a reasonably good approximation for the mean 21-cm signal for minihalos at all redshifts and a good estimator even for the total mean signal including both minihalos and the diffuse igm at @xmath175 .",
    "this encourages us to believe that the angular and spectral fluctuations in the 21-cm background predicted by isfm based on that model will also be borne out by future simulations involving a much larger volume than was simulated here .",
    "the current simulation volume is too small to be used to calculate the fluctuations in the 21-cm background because current plans for radio surveys to measure this background involve beams which will sample much larger angular scales ( @xmath176 arcminutes ) than are subtended by our current box ( @xmath177 , where @xmath178 ) and bandwidths ( @xmath179 mhz ) which are too large to resolve the depth of our simulation box in redshift - space ( i.e. @xmath180 $ ] ) .",
    "according to isfm and @xcite , the fluctuations in the 21-cm background from minihalos are significantly enhanced by the fact that minihalos are biased relative to the total matter density fluctuations .",
    "a larger simulation volume than ours will also be necessary to sample this minihalo bias in a statistically meaningful way .",
    "this bias is likely to affect the minihalo contribution to the 21-cm background fluctuations substantially more than it does the diffuse igm contribution , thereby boosting the relative importance of minihalos over the igm even above the ratio of their contributions to the mean signal .",
    "we have considered the limit in which only collisional pumping is available to decouple the spin temperature from that of the cmb , and sources of radiative pumping have not yet emerged to compete with this process .",
    "the possibility exists , however , that an x - ray background built up as sources formed inside some halos , which heated the igm while only partially ionizing it ( e.g. @xcite ) . this heating might have boosted the kinetic temperature of the igm and enhanced the effect of collisional pumping there ( e.g. @xcite ) pumping they might contribute . ] .",
    "such x - ray heating would also have raised the minimum mass of minihalos which formed thereafter , filled with their fair share of neutral h atoms .",
    "when stellar sources began to form and build up the uv background at energies below the lyman limit of hydrogen , ly@xmath5 pumping could then have radiatively coupled @xmath6 to @xmath9 , as well .",
    "the same sources presumably emitted uv radiation above the h lyman limit , too , which ionized both the igm and the minihalos within the hii regions surrounding these sources ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "such hii regions would have created holes in the 21-cm background , which then originated only in the remaining neutral regions .",
    "minihalos could have lost the neutral hydrogen gas responsible for their 21-cm emission , not only by `` outside - in '' photoionization by an external source , but also by `` inside - out '' photoionization by internal pop iii star formation ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the @xmath181 formation required for minihalos to form stars , however , is likely to have been suppressed easily by photodissociation in the lyman - warner bands by the background of uv radiation created by the very first minihalos which formed stars , when the ionizing radiation background was still much too low to cause reionization ( @xcite ) . in that case",
    ", most minihalos would have remained intact until they were ionized from without . in the future",
    ", we plan to improve upon the current calculation by incorporating this more complicated physics .",
    "we also intend to run simulations with larger simulation boxes .",
    "this would allow us to predict the 21-cm fluctuation signal ( e.g. isfm ) and determine whether the relative contribution of minihalos to the total signal , which we find to be about 70  75 % at @xmath175 for the mean signal , varies as the mean signal fluctuates .",
