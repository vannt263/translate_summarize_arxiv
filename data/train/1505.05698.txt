    "two - dimensional ( 2d ) layered materials have received a lot of research activities since the discovering of graphene .",
    "new materials such as transitional metal dichalcogenides , especially mos@xmath0@xcite , and black phosphorus @xcite with one or several atomic layers were synthesized . field effect transistors ,",
    "photo detectors and light emitting diodes were fabricated to demonstrate the potential applications of these materials .",
    "high speed radio frequency devices are fabricated which make full use of the ultrahigh electron mobility in graphene@xcite .",
    "carrier mobility is one of the key parameters for semiconductors to be used in the high speed or high frequency devices .",
    "graphene has ultrahigh mobility , but it is intrinsically metallic .",
    "it is possible to open a gap at the dirac cone , but usually the gap is tiny , and required extra parameters , for example , external electric fields@xcite , which is not easy to fully integrate it with present semiconductor processes . when it was used in logical devices , the on / off ratio is small , and the power consumption is large at the off - state .",
    "monolayer mos@xmath0 has a direct band gap about 1.7 ev .",
    "however , the electron mobility at room temperature is only up to ten @xmath1v@xmath2s@xmath2 .",
    "there are quite a lot of efforts to improve the carrier mobility .",
    "the mobility can be enhanced by even 20-fold to @xmath3200 @xmath1v@xmath2s@xmath2 when encapsulated with a high-@xmath4 dielectric layer @xcite .",
    "this mobility enhancement was attributed to screening of the charged impurity scattering by the dielectric layer@xcite . on the device level",
    ", the mobility can be engineered by electron doping .",
    "wse@xmath0 monolayer with a direct band gap about 1.65 ev was explored after mos@xmath0@xcite , which shows high field - effect mobility about 140 @xmath1v@xmath2s@xmath2 .",
    "it is already substantially higher than that of most of the reported room - temperature mobility values of mos@xmath0 .",
    "1h - mote@xmath0 has a direct band gap a little above 1.0 ev .",
    "the room temperature electron mobility was found to be about 30 @xmath1v@xmath2s@xmath2 without gating@xcite .",
    "this is already comparable with that of mos@xmath0 .",
    "according to the work of yoon@xcite , due to the heavier electron effective mass and a lower mobility , mos@xmath0 is not ideal for high - performance semiconductor device applications .",
    "a natural question arises : can we find 2d materials with larger carrier mobility ? and how far can we go to improve the mobility in the reported materials ? both of these questions can be answered by theoretical calculations .",
    "the ultramost mobility can be reached is limited by the intrinsic scattering .",
    "phonon scattering is the one which can not be avoided at temperatures other than zero .",
    "there are quite some works to calculate the phonon - limited carrier mobility in 2d materials .",
    "the value in mos@xmath0 was first calculated by kaasbjerg _",
    "et al _ @xcite .",
    "the contributions from acoustic and optical phonons are included and electron - phonon coupling matrices are calculated by the frozen phonon method .",
    "electron - phonon , as well as piezoelectric interactions , are taken into account .",
    "the calculated room temperature mobility is about 410 @xmath1v@xmath2s@xmath2 which sets the upper bound of electron mobility .",
    "this value estimated by restrepo _ et al._@xcite is 225 @xmath1v@xmath2s@xmath2 .",
    "li@xcite _ et al .",
    "_ developed the method to calculate the electron - phonon interactions based on the density functional perturbation theory and obtained similar results .",
    "the phonon limited electron mobility in single - layer mos@xmath0 is dorminated by the acoustic phonons at low field , while the degeneration by the optical phonons happens at high field according to the results of monte carlo simulations using the corresponding deformation potentials@xcite . very recently ,",
    "kim _ et al . _",
    "@xcite calculated the phonon limited electron and hole mobility of four monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides : mos@xmath0 , mose@xmath0 , ws@xmath0 and wse@xmath0 .",
    "ws@xmath0 provides the best performances of electrons and holes with high mobilities .",
    "it was also found that p - type wse@xmath0 shows hole mobilities comparable or even larger than that of bulk silicon at room temperature .",
    "our previous work shows that mote@xmath0 , zrse@xmath0 and hfse@xmath0 have the largest electron mobility if only long wave acoustical phonon scattering was taken into account@xcite .",
    "however , as shown in the work of kaasbjerg@xcite , the optical phonon may also play equally important role in mos@xmath0 in the room - temperature range due to the low optical phonon frequencies . in this work ,",
    "we take these effects into account , and try to screen out mx@xmath0 type 2d monolayer semiconductors with possible high electron mobility .",
    "we performed electronic calculations of the selected semiconductors with composition of mx@xmath0 , where m (= mo w , sn , hf , zr or pt ) is the transitional metal , and x is s , se or te . in order to fast screen out the materials with high performances , mobility limited by long wave phonons",
    "was estimated by calculating the corresponding deformation potentials .",
    "we found that out of the 14 compounds , wse@xmath0 with 1h - structure and ptse@xmath0 with 1t - structure , are promising regarding to their mobility and sizable band gap .",
    "we can see that due to the optical phonon scatter , only pts@xmath0 and ptse@xmath0 with the 1t - structure can have electron mobility larger than 1500 @xmath1v@xmath2s@xmath2 .",
    "out of the icsd database , only 16 compounds with mx@xmath0 are semiconductors@xcite .",
    "there are more layered compounds with more chemical elements .",
    "the complexity may hinder their practical applications .",
    "we selected 14 mx@xmath0 compounds which crystallizes into two different hexagonal crystal structures .",
    "one is the same as mos@xmath0 and the other is cdi@xmath0 .",
    "they are also called 1h and 1 t structure , respectively .",
    "the difference is that the anion hexagonal nets are a - a stacked in mos@xmath0 , while they are a - b stacked in cdi@xmath0 as shown in fig.[fig : str ] .",
    "thus , the first one has a mirror plane of the metals and is lack of inversion , while the second one has the inversion center .",

    "the calculations were performed mainly with pseudo - potential code pwscf@xcite , and crosschecked by the full - potential local - orbital code ( fplo)@xcite in its current version with the default basis settings .",
    "all calculations were done within the scalar relativistic approximation .",
    "the local density approximation ( lda ) functional was chosen to be that parameterized by perdew and wang@xcite .",
    "the plane - wave kinetic energy cutoff was set to 90 ry with density cut - off of 900 ry .",
    "a shifted @xmath7 monkhorst - pack mesh was used to perform brillouin zone integration in order to ensure the convergence of the results .",
    "convergence of the total energy was set to be better than 10@xmath8 hartree . a vacuum layer with thickness of 30 a.u .",
    "was used to model the 2d - nature of the compounds .",
    "forces on the atoms are limited within 0.001 ry / a@xmath9 to obtain the ground states and total energy after full geometry relaxation .",
    "phonon frequencies and phonon eigenvectors of at the @xmath10-point were calculated in a @xmath11 @xmath12-grid under the density functional perturbation theory ( dfpt ) .",
    "the electron mobilities ( @xmath13 ) were calculated by summation of the contributions of different scattering sources : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the longitudinal acoustic phonon determined mobility , @xmath16 is the longitudinal optical phonon and @xmath17 is the piezoelectricity determined ones , respectively .",
    "the electronic structures have been discussed in our previous work@xcite .",
    "the most important parameters related here is the effective masses of electron . as seen in the previous works , the compounds with the 1t - structure are mostly anisotropic , while the one with mos@xmath0 structure are more or less isotropic .",
    "the effective electron masses ( m@xmath18 ) and the lda bandgap are listed in table [ table : me ] .",
    "the m@xmath18 of mox@xmath0 are about half of that of the free electron ( m@xmath19 ) .",
    "the values of wx@xmath0 are even lighter which are only about @xmath20 of m@xmath19 . with the increase of atomic number of x",
    ", it slightly increases .",
    "there is a sizable lda bandgap in all of these compounds ranging from 0.31 ev in zrse@xmath0 to 1.99 ev in wse@xmath0 , although it is usually systematically underestimated by lda . the electronic band structure and the atomic projected density of states ( pdoss )",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bands_h ] and [ fig : bands_t ] for the two structures . in the 1t - compounds ,",
    "the conduction band minimum is located at the @xmath21-point except ptx@xmath0 .",

    "the effective mass in the @xmath23 direction for the mos@xmath0 structure and @xmath22 direction for the cdi@xmath0 structure is calculated . [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the total mobility and the lda band gap are shown in fig.[fig : mu_eg ] .     the total electron mobility and lda band gap of the 14 compounds with 1h and 1 t structure . ]    among the compounds with the 1h structure , ws@xmath0 and wse@xmath0 have mobilities of 968 and 734 @xmath1v@xmath2s@xmath2 , respectively .",
    "the lda band gap is about 1.8 ev , which is only half of that of si ( @xmath31750 @xmath1v@xmath2s@xmath2 ) .",
    "the well - studied mos@xmath0 has the upper limit of 237 @xmath1v@xmath2s@xmath2 according to our calculation .",
    "the experimental value achieved now is about 200 @xmath1v@xmath2s@xmath2 , which is already quite near this theoretical upper limit .",
    "however , in the ws(se)@xmath0 compounds , the experimental values are only about tens of @xmath1v@xmath2s@xmath2 , which is far below our theoretical limit .",
    "the electron mobilities of mo compounds are low , which is mainly caused by optical phonon scattering .",
    "this is in agreement with previous calculation and analyses by kaasbjerg _",
    "et al . _    in the compounds with 1t - structures , the piezoelectric scattering is lacking .",
    "two compounds pts@xmath0 and ptse@xmath0 show the upper limits of electron mobilities of 1759 and 2916 @xmath1v@xmath2s@xmath2 , respectively . as can be seen from the above sections , the lda band gaps are 1.69 and 1.25 ev .",
    "these compounds are thus promising when compared with si .    in this work , we have considered only the long wave longitudinal acoustic and optical phonon scattering .",
    "the initial and final states of the scattered electrons are limited to the bottom of the conduction band .",
    "that is to say , only the intravalley scattering is included .",
    "there are other scattering processes , such as interband scattering , and other scattering sources like impurities , electrons and so on .",
    "the mobility will be limited by any one of these mechanisms .",
    "there are uncertainties to precisely determine the contributions from each of these mechanism , both experimentally and theoretically , so that we can not predict the mobilities precisely .",
    "however , by computing selected scattering sources , the upper bound of the mobility can be set .",
    "we thus can say , it is hopefully that we can find compounds with possible high mobility among the selected ones with larger upper bounds .",
    "it is not possible to find larger mobility in the compounds which are predicted to have lower theoretical upper bounds .",
    "more sophisticated calculations are needed to aim more precisely within the reduced number of compounds . however , these calculations are time consuming and not suitable for screening within the large amount of candidates .    according to our estimation , the mobility of wse@xmath0 and ws@xmath0 may be larger than mos@xmath0 .",
    "the mobility order is ws@xmath24 wse@xmath24mos@xmath24mose@xmath0 , which is the same as more elegant results by kim _ et al._@xcite .",
    "recently , mobilities of wse@xmath0 and mos@xmath0 are extracted from the transfer character curves of field - effect transistors @xcite .",
    "it is shown that the electron mobility in wse@xmath0 is about 110 @xmath1v@xmath2s@xmath2 , while that of mos@xmath0 is about 25 @xmath1v@xmath2s@xmath2 .",
    "these experimental results can be a preliminary confirmation of our prediction .",
    "in this work , the electron mobility of 14 mx@xmath0 type two dimensional semiconductors were calculated where only elastic scattering from long wave acoustic and optical phonons were taken into account by the deformation potential approximation .",
    "the piezoelectric scattering was included in compounds lack of inversion center and treated as the acoustic phonon - like deformation potential .",
    "we found that the total electron mobility in ws@xmath0 can reach 968 @xmath1v@xmath2s@xmath2 , which is the highest value among the compounds with the 1h - structures .",
    "the value of 2916 @xmath1v@xmath2s@xmath2 can be reached in ptse@xmath0 with the 1t - structure , where the inversion center is presented and the piezoelectric scattering is prohibited .",
    "ws@xmath0 is a direct band gap semiconductor with band gap of 1.99 ev at the k - point , while ptse@xmath0 is an indirect band gap of 1.25 ev from the @xmath10-point to the middle of @xmath10-m line .",
