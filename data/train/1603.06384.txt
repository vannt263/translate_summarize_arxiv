    "the characterization of the mechanical properties of a material is a key step in the development of new materials , as well as in tests of existing materials for industrial applications and in quality control programs , e.g. during production .",
    "mechanical tests typically consist in imposing a strain to the sample while measuring the resistance force exerted by it , or , alternatively , in measuring the strain for a given applied force .",
    "this is the case , e.g. , of tensile tests , where a universal traction machine ( utm ) imposes a tensile strain and measures the associated tensile force .",
    "these tests yield basic information on both the linear elasticity ( e.g. via the young modulus @xmath0 ) and the sample behavior beyond the linear regime , up to mechanical failure .",
    "the latter may occur due to a sudden breakage , as in the fracture of fragile materials , or may stem from a very large , irreversible plastic deformation , as in ductile materials .",
    "more insight on the material behavior can be gained by coupling these macroscopic measurements to more local ones .",
    "a popular example is the measurement of the full , mesoscopic strain field , rather than the global , macroscopic strain alone .",
    "this can be achieved using stereo - digital image correlation methods  @xcite .",
    "a stereo - correlation bench ( scb ) consisting in a pair of cameras takes pictures of the sample surface during the mechanical test .",
    "the surface is treated in such a way to create a contrasted pattern , e.g. by spray - painting it with a dotted pattern .",
    "digital imaging correlation ( dic ) techniques are subsequently used to compute the strain field by following the displacement of regions of interests ( rois )  @xcite . by examining the strain maps",
    "valuable information can be obtained , e.g. by detecting small deviations from the uniform strain field expected in the linear regime , which may reveal at an early stage strain localization that eventually will result in macroscopic damage , such as necking .",
    "spray - painting , however , comes with some limitations : for some materials , it may be difficult to select a suitable paint coat  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the paint film may partially detach from its substrate , especially for large strains  @xcite , leading to artifacts in the measurement of the actual strain field .",
    "an appealing alternative is to illuminate the sample with laser light . due to the coherence of the laser source , light backscattered or back - reflected by the sample forms a random interference pattern , termed speckle pattern  @xcite .",
    "the speckle pattern has a contrasted , grainy appearance and the speckle size can be easily tuned by changing the aperture stop of the objective lens used to image the sample .",
    "any displacement of the sample is mirrored by a displacement of the speckle pattern , so that the strain field may be reconstructed by using the same techniques as in conventional image correlations methods .",
    "however , this speckle pattern is extremely sensitive not only to a rigid displacement of the sample , but also to the relative motion of its constituents , on length scales that for turbid , multiply scattering materials can be as small as a fraction of nm  @xcite . as a consequence , contrary to the pattern obtained by spray painting , not only does the laser speckle pattern of a strained sample deform , but it also decorrelates .",
    "while the decorrelation of the speckles in a sample under stress limits the possibility of following its macroscopic strain  @xcite , it also provides an opportunity for characterizing the deformation field at the microscopic level .",
    "this has been recognized since the early developments of diffusing wave spectroscopy ( dws ) , a scattering technique in the multiple scattering regime  @xcite . in dws ,",
    "the decorrelation of the speckle pattern generated by a turbid sample illuminated by a laser beam can be quantitatively related to the relative motion of the objects responsible for the scattering .",
    "the latter may be , e.g. , tracer particles in a fluid or embedded in a solid matrix , or , more generally , the fluctuations of the refractive index associated with variations of the local density or composition of the sample . while most studies have been devoted to the case where the microscopic dynamics is induced by thermal energy , as for brownian motion , the case where the dynamics result predominantly from an applied strain or stress has also been investigated .",
    "wu and coworkers have related the speckle decorrelation measured by dws to the shear rate in a fluid under poiseuille laminar flow  @xcite .",
    "bicout et al .",
    "have generalized the approach of ref .",
    "@xcite to an arbitrary deformation  @xcite , expressing the speckle patter decorrelation as a function of the strain tensor .",
    "their formalism has been used to analyze experimental speckle decorrelation data for a random close packing of sub - millimeter glass spheres subject to thermal expansion  @xcite .",
    "this experiment has highlighted the extreme sensitivity of the technique , since relative dilations as small as @xmath1 could be measured .    in refs .",
    "@xcite the speckle field was analyzed in the far field , such that the detector was illuminated by light issued from the whole scattering volume , with no spatial selectivity . in this configuration ,",
    "the evolution of the speckle pattern is only due to the relative motion of the scatterers .",
    "a different approach has been introduced in a subsequent series of experiments by the group of j. crassous  @xcite , where the speckle patter was collected in an imaging geometry , such that different areas of the 2d detector corresponded to different regions of the sample , a slab of a solid material loaded on one side with a blade in a plane stress configuration .",
    "the measurements of  @xcite were performed well within the linear regime , for extremely small strains of order @xmath2 to @xmath3 , such that the sample was essentially immobile in the laboratory frame of reference and the strain field could be considered to be purely affine .     in this work",
    ", we apply space - resolved dws to investigate the behavior of semi - crystalline and amorphous polymers during tensile stress tests .",
    "in contrast to refs .",
    "@xcite , we explore both the linear and non - linear regime , with strains up to about 10% .",
    "this has two consequences : first , the sample is macroscopically deformed , the side held by the mobile grip of the umt being displaced over several millimeters . we show that under these conditions pci - dws can be used to measure strain maps comparable to those obtained by conventional stereo - digital image correlation methods .",
    "second , unlike in  @xcite , the microscopic dynamics stems not only from the affine deformation associated with elastic response , but also from additional rearrangements .",
    "we show that these additional rearrangements allow one to detect plasticity at an early stage , before the onset of its macroscopic manifestation ( necking ) .",

    "part of this uncertainty may be due to slight fluctuations of the pulling velocity during the test , since @xmath69 is calculated by analyzing the 100 cmos frames available during a 10 s interval , as opposed to @xmath70 for which only two frames are used .",
    "moreover , in our tests the illumination conditions were not optimized for pci - dws , due to the need to perform simultaneous measurements with both techniques . in particular , some white light from the scb illumination leaked onto the pci - dws cmos , introducing flare that further reduced the contrast of the speckle images , as seen in figs .",
    "[ fig : setup]d - e .",

    "indeed , both methods use cross - correlation techniques to detect the motion of a pattern ; however , the painted pattern imaged by the scb is essentially unmodified when stretching the sample , while the speckle pattern decorrelates quite rapidly , as a result of the microscopic motion associated with sample strain .",
    "accordingly , it is more difficult to follow precisely the displacement of the speckle pattern than that of the painted surface .",

    "@xcite , although with an opposite trend , since the microscopic strain was found to be about 5 times _ smaller _ than the macroscopic one .",
    "as argued in  @xcite , these differences may also stem from the approximations introduced in the dws formalism ( see e.g.  @xcite for more details ) , which result in some uncertainty on the precise value of the numerical prefactor @xmath106 in eq .",
    "[ eq : fu ] .",
    "we thus conclude that dws correctly captures the time dependence of the strain evolution and that eqs .",
    "[ eq : g2m1dr2]-[eq : fu ] allow one to retrieve the microscopic strain rate quantitatively , to within a factor of 2 .",
    "the dws data taken during the first stretching phase can then be used as a benchmark against which comparing the measurements for the successive stretching phases , in order to detect the onset of plasticity .     and the spatially - averaged relaxation time as a function of roi position .",

    "figure  [ fig : dwsnecking2 ] shows the absorption - corrected correlation functions for various stretching phases , for two rois , located at @xmath108 ( a ) , close to the fixed grip ) and @xmath109 ( b ) , close to where necking eventually occurs ) . to better appreciate the changes of the dynamics ,",
    "@xmath60 is plotted in a semilogarithmic scale , for which the ballistic motion associated with a purely affine deformation corresponds to a straight line .",
    "close to the fixed grip ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dwsnecking2]a ) , the dynamics are overall consistent with ballistic motion up to the stretching phase @xmath110 .",
    "the decay becomes increasingly steeper up to @xmath111 , although the change is modest . beyond @xmath111 ,",
    "the decay rate follows an opposite trend : the dynamics are increasingly slower , in spite that the macroscopically imposed strain rate remains the same .",
    "for @xmath112 the dynamics strongly deviate from those expected for an affine deformation and the microscopic displacements are far more restricted than what expected from the imposed strain rate . for the roi at @xmath109 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dwsnecking2]b ) the scenario is completely different : the dynamics speed up continuously and significantly from one stretching phase to the next one , such that the relaxation rate for @xmath112 is 2.6 times faster than that during the first stretching phase .",
    "the data shown in fig .  [ fig : dwsnecking2]a , b ) suggest that additional microscopic displacements , most likely due to plastic activity , enhance the dynamics since the earliest stretching phases .",
    "however , as the accumulated strain grows , these dynamics become increasingly heterogeneous : plasticity tends to concentrate in the rois close to the region that eventually will form a neck , which in turn leads to a decrease of the dynamical activity in the other regions of the sample .",
    "this scenario is confirmed by inspecting the @xmath25 dependence of @xmath113 , the difference between the local relaxation time of @xmath60 and its spatial average , as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : dwsnecking2]c [ @xmath114 is defined by @xmath115 .",
    "remarkably , the changes of the microscopic dynamics and their localisation are observed since the first few stretching phases , earlier than the appearance of macroscopic heterogeneity in the strain and necking .",
    "these observations suggest that a convenient indicator of the onset of plasticity at the microscopic level may be obtained by quantifying the spatial heterogeneity of the dynamics . to this end",
    ", we measure for each roi the relaxation time , and plot in fig .  [",
    "fig : dwsnecking2]c ) @xmath116 , the standard deviation of @xmath114 over all rois , normalized by its mean , as a function of the stretching phase @xmath90 ( left axis and solid squares ) .",
    "the growth of this indicator for @xmath107 reflects the increasing localization of the rearrangement dynamics : @xmath114 decreases in the region that eventually will develop a macroscopic neck , while it grows in the other rois . for the sake of comparison , the open circles of fig .",
    "[ fig : dwsnecking2]c ) show the standard deviation of the strain rate obtained from the scb data shown in fig .",
    "3b . note that the changes in the strain rate are much smaller than those of the relative relaxation time ( see the difference between the scales of the left and right @xmath74 axes ) .",
    "furthermore , a clear change of regime is seen only for @xmath117 , significantly later than for the dws data .",
    "therefore , these data demonstrate the great interest of pci - dws as a tool for investigating the non - linear material properties in mechanical tests .",
    "we have introduced an original setup that couples space - resolved light scattering ( pci - dws ) to stereo - digital image correlation methods to characterize the mechanical behaviour of polymer specimens undergoing tensile loading .",
    "light scattering allows one to measure both the mesoscopic sample displacement , yielding space - resolved strain maps , and the microscopic dynamics .",
    "the strain maps obtained by pci - dws are fully consistent with those issued from the stereo - correlation bench .",
    "contrary to scb , light scattering measurements of the displacement field do not require the surface of the sample to be spray - painted , which is particularly interesting when there are concerns on the feasibility of spray coating ; moreover , dws - pci probes the full thickness of the sample , and not only its surface , as for scb .",
    "thus , the method presented here is less sensitive to artifacts that may arise from a differential deformation of the surface _ vs. _ the bulk or from a loss of stability of the spray coating , especially at large strains .",
    "in the tests presented here , the resolution on the displacement field retrieved by pci - dws is somehow worse than that of scb , although there is certainly room for improvements , e.g. by optimizing the illumination conditions .",
    "a unique feature of dws is the possibility of quantifying the microscopic dynamics down to length scales smaller than a nm . here",
    ", the microscopic dynamics measured by dws during the earlier traction phases was shown to be consistent with that expected for affine deformation .",
    "by contrast , as the strain is increased , pci - dws reveals deviations from linear elasticity and localized plastic activity , well before any macroscopic evidence of plasticity .",
    "the requirements on the sample optical properties are those typical of dws : as for the experiments presented here , photons should penetrate in the sample , as opposed to be reflected from its surface ; @xmath22 should be much smaller than the sample thickness @xmath118 , so that multiple scattering conditions are met ; the absorption length @xmath48 should be larger than @xmath22 , in order for the backscattered intensity to be high enough to be conveniently detected .",
    "many materials such as semicrystalline or amorphous polymers and elastomers meet these criteria . for other materials , the method proposed here could also be used , with some modifications .",
    "for example , the mesoscopic strain field could be easily measured for reflecting objects such as metals , provided that their surface be rough on the micron scale , in order to backscatter light . in this case , however , no information on the microscopic bulk deformation may be retrieved .",
    "nearly - transparent materials , for which @xmath119 , could also be studied . in this case , the backscattered intensity would arise essentially from single scattering alone , as in dynamic light scattering ( dls  @xcite ) .",
    "space - resolved dls has already been applied to investigate the strain field of soft colloidal gels  @xcite and biological gels  @xcite under the action of gravity or internal stresses : it should be straightforward to extend it to harder materials such as plastics .",
    "since single scattering probes microscopic motion on length scales larger than dws , we expect dls to be less sensitive to the microscopic rearrangements .",
    "while this is a disadvantage if one is interested in detecting the microscopic precursors of plasticity , such a lesser sensitivity allows a higher precision to be attained on the mesoscopic strain maps .",
    "the work presented here highlights the great potential of pci - dws as a complementary tool to investigate the response of a material to a mechanical drive , both at the mesoscopic and microscopic level .",
    "further developments of this method may include its application to other kinds of perturbations , such as temperature jumps or thermal cycling .",
