    "@xmath4    in this talk i shall discuss mainly the light and broad @xmath1 , which was picked by matts roos and myself@xcite from the particle data group wastebasket 4 years ago , having been there for over 20 years .",
    "today an increasing number of papers , many of which have been reported at this meeting@xcite , are quoting its parameters , with a pole position near 500-i250 mev ( see the table 1 ) .",
    "an important question today is : does this broad resonance really exist ? and",
    "if so , what is its nature , together with the other light scalar mesons in the 1 gev region ?",
    "the naive quark model ( nqm ) , which works reasonably well for the vectors and heavier multiplets , definitely fails for the scalars taken as @xmath5 and @xmath6 .    0.1 in    .",
    "_ @xmath1 pole position . _ [ cols=\"<,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ extab2 ]    in some of the channels of table 3 the resonance is below threshold and the widths vanish at the resonance mass .",
    "however , the coupling constants have then been determined through a loop diagram from @xmath7 and @xmath8 ( albeit in a somewhat model dependent way ) by the novosibirsk group . for channels where the phase space is large",
    ", it is important that one includes a form factor related to the finite size of physical mesons . in the quark pair creation ( @xmath9 )",
    "model a radius of 0.8 fm leads to a gaussian form factor , as in the formula below , where @xmath10 gev / c ( as was found in the uqm@xcite ) . thus the widths are computed from the formula : ( m)=_isospin e^-[k^cm(m)/k_0]^2  .    as can be seen from table 3",
    "most of the couplings are not far from experiment .",
    "the main exception is the @xmath11 coupling and width , but this is extremely sensitive to the ideal mixing angle . if one choses @xmath12 this mixing angle nearly vanishes ( @xmath13 ) together with the @xmath11 coupling ( c.f .",
    "eq.4 ) . from our experience with the uqm@xcite the couplings , when unitarized , are very sensitive to especially the nearby @xmath14 threshold . similarily the @xmath15 peak width is reduced , because of the @xmath14 theshold , by up to a factor 5 .",
    "therefore one can not expect that the tree level couplings should agree better with data than what those of table 3 do .",
    "in fact , i was myself astonished by the fact that the agreement turned out to be this good .",
    "after all , this is a very strong coupling model ( @xmath16 , leading to large @xmath17 ) and higher order effects should be important .",
    "in summary , i find that the linear sigma model with three flavours works , at the tree level , much better than expected .",
    "it works , in my opinion , just as well as the naive quark model works for the heavier nonets .",
    "one should of course include higher order effects , i.e. , the model should be unitarized phenomenologically , e.g. , along the lines of the uqm@xcite , whereby a more detailed data comparison becomes meaningful .",
    "those working on chiral perturbation theory and nonlinear sigma models usually point out that the linear model does not predict all low energy constants correctly .",
    "however , one should remember that the energy regions of validity are different for the two approaches .",
    "chiral perturbation theory usually breaks down when one approaches the first scalar resonance .",
    "the linear sigma model , on the other hand , includes the scalars from the start and can be a reasonable interpolating model in the intermediate energy region near 1 gev , where qcd is too difficult to solve .",
    "these results strongly favour the interpretation that the @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 belong to the same nonet , and that they are the chiral partners of the @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 .",
    "if the latter are believed to be unitarized @xmath26 states , so are the light scalars @xmath27 @xmath28 @xmath29 @xmath21 , and the broad @xmath18 should be interpreted as an existing resonance .",
    "the @xmath1 is a very important hadron indeed , as is evident in the sigma model , because this is the boson which gives the constituent quarks most of their mass and thereby it gives also the light hadrons most of their mass .",
    "it is the higgs boson of strong interactions .",
