    "the measurement of the angular power spectrum of the cmb anisotropies , @xmath0s , has become one of the most important tools in modern cosmology . as long as they remain in the linear regime , the fluctuations predicted by most inflationary scenarii @xcite lead to gaussian anisotropies on the cmb .",
    "thus the angular power spectra in temperature and polarization contain all the cosmological information on the cmb sky .",
    "cosmological parameters and other physical quantities of interest in the early universe can be directly derived from them . in parallel to the explosion of cmb datasets both in size and quality ( wmap @xcite , archeops @xcite , boomerang @xcite , maxima @xcite , dasi @xcite , vsa @xcite , cbi @xcite , acbar @xcite ) , fast codes have been developed to estimate the cmb angular power spectrum ( cmbfast @xcite , camb @xcite ) allowing us to compare fast and efficiently theory and observations using powerful statistical tests ( cmbeasy @xcite , cosmomc @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , huge efforts are undertaken to ease the estimation of the angular power spectrum from input cmb maps in order to cope with larger , deeper and more complex sky surveys in a reasonable amount of computing time .",
    "excluding very specific methods  for example those which are under study for the planck satellite mission and which take advantage of the planck ring scanning strategy @xcite  most cmb power spectrum estimators can be grouped into two categories  : maximum likelihood and ` pseudo'-@xmath0 estimators . a complete review and comparison between the two methods",
    "can be found in @xcite , here we just discuss the key points of each of them .",
    "maximum likelihood methods for temperature anisotropies @xcite are based on the maximization of the quadratic likelihood .",
    "the method estimates the sky angular power spectrum from the angular correlation function of the data .",
    "error bars for the power spectrum are generally computed directly from the likelihood function which is either fully sampled in the range of interest or approximated by a quadratic form .",
    "dealing with an inhomogeneous coverage of the sky involves a great computational complexity where @xmath1 is the number of pixels of the input map .",
    "therefore , these methods are very cpu time consuming for current large datasets like wmap and probably not well adapted @xcite for future satellite missions like planck which will produce maps of the sky of more than @xmath2 pixels . a generalization of these methods to the analysis of cmb polarization is discussed in @xcite .    alternatively",
    ", the so - called ",
    "pseudo-@xmath0 s estimators compute directly the _ ` pseudo ' _ angular power spectrum from the data .",
    "then , they correct it for the sky coverage , beam smoothing , data filtering , pixel weighting and noise biases .",
    "a comprehensive description of this method was first given by @xcite and an application to the angular clustering of galaxies can be found in @xcite .",
    "more recently , several approaches to this method have been developed . among them , spice @xcite and its extension to polarization @xcite compute in the real space first the correlation function to correct for the sky coverage bias and then the power spectrum from the latter .",
    "a pseudo-@xmath0 estimator in the spherical harmonic space applied to cmb experiments is given in @xcite and @xcite ( master ) .",
    "they computes directly the power spectrum before correct it for the different biases .",
    "an approach applied to apodised regions of the sky is presented in @xcite and extended to polarization in @xcite .",
    "these estimators can be evaluated using fast spherical harmonic transforms @xmath3 and therefore provide fast and accurate estimates of the @xmath0s .",
    "however , they require an accurate knowledge of the instrumental setup and noise in order to correct them for the biases discussed previously .",
    "in fact , they use an estimation of the power spectrum of the noise in the map , generally computed via monte - carlo simulations , which is subtracted from the original power spectrum .",
    "this is also used to estimate the error bars in the power spectrum by calculating the variance of the @xmath0s over the set of simulations .    in this paper , we describe a method to estimate the @xmath0s by computing the cross - power spectra between a collection of input maps coming either from multiple detectors of the same experiment or from different instruments .",
    "the ` pseudo ' cross - power spectra are explicitly corrected for incomplete sky coverage , beam smoothing , filtering and pixelization . assuming no correlation between the noise contribution from two different maps , each of the corrected cross - power spectra is an unbiased estimate of the @xmath0s .",
    "analytical error bars are derived for each of them .",
    "the cross - power spectra , that do not include the classical _ auto_-power spectra , are then combined using a gaussian approximation of the likelihood function . in the same way",
    ", we can also compute the estimate of the common angular power spectrum , @xmath4 , of sky maps from different experiments . +",
    "a similar method also based on the combination of a set of cross - power spectra has been first used to obtain recent results from the first year wmap data @xcite .",
    "the main difference between the method presented is this paper and the wmap one is the determination of the cross - correlation matrix ( see  sect.[correlation ] ) of the corrected cross - power spectra used both for the combination of these into a single power spectra and for the estimation of the error bars on the latter .",
    "the wmap team estimates the cross - correlation matrix from a model of the data .",
    "this includes specific terms related to the wmap data such as the contribution from point sources and the uncertainties on the beam window functions as well as a term related to the cmb anisotropies which is estimated from a fiducial model .",
    "the wmap cross - correlation matrix , used for the combination of the cross - power spectra , does not incorporate the effects of mode coupling . in a further step , they account for the mode coupling and the dependence on the fiducial cmb model for the computation of the uncertainties on the final power spectrum .",
    "by contrast , the method presented here computes the cross - correlation matrix directly from the cross - power spectra estimated from the data .",
    "this allows us to include naturally the mode coupling in this matrix .",
    "further , this permits the computation of analytical error bars ( as described in sect .",
    "[ correlation ] ) which are very compatible with those obtained from simulations ( see sect .  [ archeops ] ) .",
    "because of the above , this method can be applied without modification to the estimation of the power spectrum of the correlated signal between a set of maps of the sky coming from multiple instruments with potentially different sky coverages .",
    "for example , we have used this method on archeops data for the estimation of the cmb angular power spectrum and the contribution from foregrounds to this one @xcite .",
    "we have also used it for the estimation of the foreground emission at the sub - millimeter and millimeter wavelength by cross - correlating the archeops data with foreground dust templates .    in sect .",
    "[ cross ] , we remind to the reader the computation of the cross - power spectra from ` pseudo ' cross - power spectra . in sect .",
    "[ correlation ] , we specify the correlation between cross - power spectra and between multipoles . analytical expressions for the error bars and the covariance matrix for each cross - power spectra are derived .",
    "section  [ combination ] discusses the combination of the cross - spectra from either a single full data set ( sect .",
    "[ lincomb ] ) or several independent experiments ( sect .",
    "[ common ] ) .",
    "finally , xspect is applied to simulations of the archeops balloon - borne experiment in sect .",
    "[ archeops ] .",
    "under the assumption of uncorrelated noise between detectors , the cross - power spectrum computed from sky maps is a non noise - biased estimate of the angular power spectrum . in general , when computing the @xmath0s , other instrumental effects as beam smoothing , incomplete sky coverage and time ordered data filtering need to be taken into account .",
    "these effects and the way to correct them have been deeply covered in the literature for classical ` pseudo-@xmath0 ' estimators @xcite which are noise biased as they use directly the auto power spectrum of each detector map .",
    "as shown in the following , these corrections can be extended to the case of cross - power spectra .",
    "the cmb temperature anisotropies , @xmath5 , over the full - sky can be decomposed into spherical harmonics as follows , @xmath6 where the coefficient @xmath7 are given by @xmath8    the cmb temperature field @xmath5 predicted by most inflationary models @xcite is in general gaussian distributed so that the ensemble average of the @xmath7 coefficients are @xmath9    an unbiased estimate of the cmb temperature power spectrum @xmath10 is therefore given by @xmath11    ground - based and balloon - borne cmb experiments present an inhomogeneous sky coverage .",
    "on the other hand , satellite experiments like cobe , wmap and planck , although they provide full - sky maps , residuals of foreground contamination in the galactic plane and point sources contamination make impossible to use the complete maps when computing the cmb angular power spectrum .",
    "furthermore , for most cmb experiments , the noise properties vary considerably due to different redundancies between pixels of the same map . so obtaining an estimate of the power spectrum",
    "requires a differential weighting of pixels within the same map which translates into an effective inhomogeneous sky coverage .",
    "the decomposition in spherical harmonics of the observed temperature anisotropies including weighting can be written for a single detector as follows @xmath12 where @xmath13 for equal pixels ( as in healpix pixelization , @xcite ) and @xmath14 is the mask applied to the input sky temperature @xmath15 .",
    "this temperature can be decomposed into signal and noise , @xmath16 which are assumed to be uncorrelated , _",
    "@xmath17    the effect of a non - homogeneous coverage of the sky can be described in spherical harmonics @xcite by a mode - mode coupling matrix @xmath18 which depends only on the angular power spectrum of the weighting scheme ( hereafter weighting mask ) applied to the sky to account for the incomplete coverage , the removal of the galactic plane and the inhomogeneous noise properties of the detector .",
    "thus , the ` pseudo-@xmath0 ' estimator @xmath19 is defined as follows @xmath20    the relation that links the ` pseudo ' power spectrum , directly measured on the sky , and the power spectrum @xmath0 of the cmb anisotropies is given by @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the beam transfer function describing the beam smoothing effect ; @xmath23 is the transfer function of the pixelization scheme of the map describing the effect of smoothing due to the finite pixel size and geometry ; @xmath24 is an effective function that represents any filtering applied to the time ordered data ; and @xmath25 is the noise power spectrum .",
    "an unbiased estimate of the cross - power spectrum @xmath26 between the full sky maps of two independent and perfect detectors @xmath27 and @xmath28 can be obtained from @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the coefficients of the spherical harmonic decomposition of maps @xmath27 and @xmath28 respectively .    in the same way",
    ", we can compute the ` pseudo ' cross - power spectrum @xmath32 between any two detectors @xmath27 and @xmath28 by generalizing eq .",
    "[ pseudo_cl ] @xmath33 each of the terms in eq .",
    "[ pseudo_cross ] is described in more details in the following subsections .",
    "the main advantage of using cross - power spectra is that the noise is generally uncorrelated between different detectors @xmath35 this assumption will be maintained throughout this paper .",
    "thus , the cross - power spectra are straightforward estimates of the angular power spectrum on the sky and for two different detectors ( _ i.e. _ @xmath36 ) , the ` pseudo ' cross - power spectrum reads @xmath37      the coupling kernel matrix @xmath18 , introduced in eq .",
    "[ pseudo_cl ] and described in details in @xcite , reads @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the power spectrum of the mask .",
    "it takes into account the mask applied to the data where mask represents both the sky coverage and the weighting scheme .",
    "equation  [ mll_master ] can be easily generalized to the case of two different masks applied respectively to each map of the two detectors involved in the cross - power spectrum calculation .",
    "replacing the quadratic terms @xmath41 by @xmath42 in the computation of eq .",
    "[ mll_master ] leads to @xmath43 where @xmath44 , the cross - power spectrum of the masks .",
    "this property allows us to deal with independent masks representing different sky coverages and to apply an appropriate specific weighting scheme to each detector map .",
    "note that the correction in the multipole space discussed here is fully equivalent to an appropriate normalization of the cross correlation between the two sky masked maps in real space .",
    "this analogy is important as it helps to understand why no fully overlapping masks for the input maps can be considered .",
    "the filter function @xmath24 accounts for the filtering of the time ordered data which is generally needed in most cmb experiments either to avoid systematic effects or to reduce correlated low frequency noise . the time domain filtering is performed along a preferred direction on",
    "the sky ( scanning direction ) and so leads commonly to an anisotropic sky even if the assumption of initial isotropic temperature fluctuations holds .",
    "in this case , the estimates of the angular power spectrum provided by eq .  [ pseudo_cl ] and eq .",
    "[ pseudo ] are not exact any more and should be corrected for a function both in @xmath46 and @xmath47 , @xmath48 . obtaining accurate estimates of such",
    "a correction is particularly complex and for most cases , as proposed by @xcite , the correction for an effective @xmath49 is good enough for the accuracy required in the reconstruction of the cmb power spectrum",
    ". the @xmath49 function can be , for example , computed via monte - carlo simulations of the sky from which mock time ordered data are produced for each of the detectors involved and then filtered .    from an initial theoretical cmb power spectrum , we compute a large number of realizations of the sky using the healpix software _ synfast _",
    "@xcite and compute mock time ordered data from the scanning strategy of each detector .",
    "maps are then computed with and without filtering before re - projection .",
    "the @xmath24 function is obtained from the mean ratio of the ` pseudo ' power spectra of the filtered and not filtered maps .",
    "the latter are obtained using the healpix software _",
    "anafast_.    in the case of the cross - power spectra and considering the previous approximation , an effective filter function @xmath50 will be considered in the following .",
    "as defined , the effective filtering function allows us to consider detectors for which the time domain filtering is different .",
    "note that , for nearly white noise and all - sky surveys such as wmap or planck missions , filtering may not be required and thus @xmath51 .",
    "the beam window function @xmath22 describes the smoothing effect of the main instrumental beam under the hypothesis of circularity .",
    "the latter does not hold in general as for most experiments the main beam pattern is asymmetric . as beam uncertainties have become the most important source of systematic errors , taking into account the asymmetry of the beam pattern is necessary .",
    "several solutions have been proposed either circularizing the beam @xcite or assuming an elliptical gaussian beam @xcite .",
    "the work of @xcite presents how to convolve _ exactly _ two band limited but otherwise arbitrary functions on the sphere - which can be the 4-@xmath53 beam pattern and the sky descriptions . an analytic framework for studying the leading order effects of a non - circular beam on the cmb power spectrum estimation",
    "is proposed in @xcite .",
    "the authors of this paper present _ asymfast _ @xcite , a general method to estimate an effective @xmath22 function taking into account the asymmetry of the main beam and the scanning strategy .",
    "_ asymfast _ is based on a decomposition of the main beam pattern into a linear combination of gaussians which permits fast convolution in the spherical harmonic space along the scanning strategy .",

    "figure  [ error_simuarcheops ] shows analytic estimates of the error bars in the final angular power spectrum compared to the dispersion for each multipole bin over the 500 monte - carlo simulations .",
    "the archeops sky coverage is very inhomogeneous due to the particular choice of the scanning strategy which tries to maximize the area of the sky observed ( @xmath128% ) in a very reduced amount of observation time ( less than 12  hours ) .",
    "archeops performs large circles on the sky that leads to a quasi ring - like coverage with a large uncovered region at the center of the ring as shown on fig .",
    "[ archeops_cover ] .",
    "this implies that the approximation used to obtain eq .",
    "[ xi_approx ] is not valid , especially at low multipoles , and therefore the error bars obtained analytically ( red solid line ) are underestimated up to @xmath133 at very low @xmath46 with a mean of @xmath139 . by computing @xmath140 as given by eq .",
    "[ xi ] , the analytic error bars ( yellow solid line ) increase as expected and fit much better the dispersion in the simulations ( black dashed line ) .",
    "the agreement is then within @xmath141 over the full range of multipoles with a mean of @xmath142 .",
    "equivalent results are obtained using non noisy simulations .     sky coverage and",
    "weighting scheme applied to the sky map ( @xmath143 ) obtained from the archeops most sensitive detector at 143  ghz .",
    "we observe a ring - like structure with a large uncovered area in the center and highly redundant areas on the edges of the ring . ]",
    "xspect has been applied to the data from the last archeops flight campaign using the six most sensitive bolometers as in the simulations presented above .",
    "the results of this analysis is presented in a collaboration paper @xcite .",
    "cross - correlation with wmap maps is also under study in order to assess the electromagnetic spectrum of the cmb anisotropies from 40 to 217  ghz .",
    "in this paper , we have presented a method , xspect , for the obtention of the cmb angular power spectrum with analytical error bars based on four main steps :    1 .",
    "given @xmath63 independent input sky maps from different detectors either from a single experiment or from multiple ones , we estimate @xmath64 ` pseudo ' cross - power spectra as well as @xmath63 ` pseudo ' auto - power spectra using the healpix package @xcite .",
    "cross - power spectra are obtained by correcting the ` pseudo ' power spectra for weighting scheme , beam smoothing and filtering as discussed in section  [ cross ] . in the same way",
    ", we compute auto - power spectra with noise .",
    "xspect can deal with different and complex weighting schemes for each of the detectors involved .",
    "the coupling matrix , beam and filtering transfer functions are precomputed for each pair of detectors .",
    "we compute the full cross - correlation matrix , @xmath144 , between cross - power spectra @xmath70 ( @xmath36 ) and @xmath71 ( @xmath145 ) ( section  [ correlation_matrix ] ) from which we can extract the covariance matrix and the error bars for each cross - power spectra ( sect  [ covpercross ] ) .",
    "4 .   finally",
    ", the corrected cross - power spectra are combined into a single angular power spectrum using their cross - correlation matrices which are assumed to be diagonal in multipole space .",
    "the gaussian approximation of the likelihood function is fully justified in the large multipole range . in addition ,",
    "analytical estimates for the error bars and for the covariance matrix are computed ( section  [ combination ] ) .",
    "the covariance matrix can be used to check the degree of correlation between multipoles .    as",
    "this method estimates the angular power spectrum using ` pseudo ' cross - power spectra , we can obtain a non noise - biased power spectrum avoiding the estimation of the noise power spectra which requires heavy monte - carlo simulations .",
    "equally , this permits the estimation of analytical error bars which are compatible to those computed from simulations .",
    "furthermore , xspect allows us to obtain the angular power spectrum of common sky fluctuations between two or more experiments .",
    "associated to other surveys used as templates , it can provide estimations of systematic residuals or astrophysical contaminations .",
    "nevertheless , xspect computes only the common structures between maps , assuming a single physical component .",
    "this means that , for cmb purposes , foregrounds and systematics must be subtracted beforehand .",
    "xspect has been successfully applied to simulations of the archeops experiment which presents an inhomogeneous sky coverage and detectors with unequal sensitivities . even for a balloon - borne experiment that can be compared to satellite missions neither in noise level nor in sky coverage , the analytical estimates of the errors computed with xspect are accurate within few percents .",
    "this property is of great interest when producing monte carlo simulations in the process of testing and improving the estimation of the @xmath0s or when checking the robustness of the data analysis with respect to the various choices of mask , filtering or binning .",
    "the application of xspect to the archeops data set will be published by the archeops collaboration shortly @xcite .    for the wmap satellite , which covers the full sky in a very homogeneous way , it was also interesting to check the analytical estimates of the error bars .",
    "xspect analytical errors are equivalent to those provided by the wmap team within 15% with a mean of 1.8% .",
    "this agreement is satisfactory as our analysis was more basic than the one used to derive the first year wmap results presented in @xcite .",
    "in particular all maps at all multipoles were used without any point - source specific treatment and only two weighting schemes were applied .",
    "the extension of xspect to cmb polarization maps is under development . as for the temperature power spectrum ,",
    "the @xmath146 and @xmath147 power spectra obtained directly from a single set of i , q and u maps via a pseudo power spectrum estimator are noise biased .",
    "a pseudo cross - power spectrum estimator adapted to polarization can solve this problem by using independent sets of i , q and u maps .",
    "authors are grateful to j - ch .  hamilton for discussions in the initial stage of this work in our team .",
    "we also want to thank f.x  dsert for useful discussions on the method and for corrections of this paper .",
    "the healpix package @xcite was used extensively .",
