    "during the last fifteen years , spin ladders have attracted a lot of attention both from theoretical and experimental physicists ( for an early review , see ref .  [ ] ) .",
    "on one hand , they provide a calculationally tractable system interpolating between one - dimensional and two - dimensional quantum spin physics . on the other hand ,",
    "existing spin ladder compounds allow for a detailed comparison of theoretical predictions and experimental results .",
    "the interpolation between one and two dimensions is however not smooth : while half integer spin ladders with an even number of legs @xmath2 show a gapped spectrum for spin excitations , ladders with odd @xmath2 are believed to be gapless ( like the spin-1/2 heisenberg chain ) .    for odd @xmath2-ladders with half - integer spins , applying periodic boundary conditions in the transverse direction of the ladder ( forming thus a _ spin tube _",
    ") yields an even more intriguing situation : in this case , for antiferromagnetic couplings , the ground state of an isolated ring is fourfold degenerate ( twofold in spin- and twofold in chirality - space ) and the low - energy physics of weakly coupled rings therefore involves both spin and chirality degrees of freedom .",
    "a number of theoretical studies have investigated effective low - energy hamiltonians for weakly coupled rings by means of bosonization  @xcite , density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg )  @xcite , mean field theory  @xcite , and exact diagonalization ( ed )  @xcite .",
    "all of them conclude that the ground state is dimerized , displaying a gap for both spin and chirality excitations .",
    "the details of the gaps depend however on the frustration of the inter - ring coupling  @xcite .",
    "two experimental candidates for spin tubes are currently available : the vanadium oxide na@xmath0v@xmath1o@xmath3  @xcite , probably a nine - leg spin tube but with only threefold rotational symmetry , and the three - leg compound [ ( cucl@xmath0tachh)@xmath1cl]cl@xmath0  @xcite .",
    "none of these examples is in the regime of weak coupling between the rings , intra- and inter - ring coupling constants being of the same order .",
    "it is therefore a very important first question to ask whether the low - energy physics of these realistic spin tubes may still be described by the above mentioned spin - chirality models . in both experimental realizations ,",
    "neighboring rings are not coupled by one single antiferromagnetic bond , but by at least two competing bonds .",
    "this leads to additional frustration and raises the second question as to how much this frustration can change the physics .",
    "we address both questions by considering the example of a three - leg tube with antiferromagnetic intra - ring couplings and two frustrating antiferromagnetic inter - ring couplings which forms a minimal setup including chirality and additional frustration .",
    "this model represents directly the compound [ ( cucl@xmath0tachh)@xmath1cl]cl@xmath0 , but the main results are expected to apply to other frustrated spin tubes as well . regarding the properties , we will concentrate on the presence or absence of a spin gap , on the nature of the low - lying excitations , and on the magnetization curve .",

    "the starting point is the hamiltonian of the frustrated antiferromagnetic spin-1/2 heisenberg model on a three - leg spin tube : @xmath4 the index @xmath5 runs along the tube , @xmath6 around the tube , and @xmath7 is the spin operator for a spin 1/2 . the tube can be viewed as series of triangles ( see fig .",
    "[ fig - reseau ] ) .",
    "each corner of such a triangle is coupled to two corners on the previous and the next triangle . in the absence of the @xmath8 coupling ,",

    "the lieb schultz mattis ( lsm ) theorem  @xcite is one of the few exact results on frustrated spin systems .",
    "since its proof is quite general , it can be applied to a wide variety of systems with short - range interactions  @xcite , in particular , to the spin tube hamiltonian  ( [ eq - ham ] ) .",
    "an explicit proof of the lsm theorem for this case can be found in ref .",
    "the theorem states that half - integer spin chains have either a degenerate ground state or a gapless spectrum due to a zero - energy mode with momentum @xmath10 relative to the ground state .",
    "it is interesting to note that both situations are realized in the three - leg spin tube system .",
    "we first discuss them in two limiting cases .      in the limit @xmath11 , the system consists of weakly interacting triangles .",

    "note that the nature of the second order corrections to @xmath29 and @xmath30 does not seem to frustrate the effective spin-3/2 chain .",
    "it is therefore reasonable to argue that the spin-3/2 state is stabilized at least up to @xmath22 even though this value lies beyond the perturbative limit .",

    "the ratio of the couplings does not change drastically even by increasing @xmath34 up to @xmath35 .",
    "the physics of the effective hamiltonian  ( [ reduced quadruplet ] ) is therefore dominated by the heisenberg ( @xmath29 ) term , which is known to belong to the universality class of a luttinger liquid @xcite , and therefore has a gapless spectrum .",
    "we believe that small biquadratic or bicubic interactions will not immediately open a gap @xcite and we expect the low energy theory to remain stable .",
    "note that these gapless excitations are in sharp contrast to the gapped spectrum of the spin - chirality hamiltonian  ( [ reduced chirality ] ) .",
    "based on the preliminary arguments of subsections [ weakly coupled triangles ] and [ strongly coupled triangles ] , we expect the frustrated spin - tube hamiltonian  ( [ eq - ham ] ) to undergo at least one quantum phase transition as we move from weakly coupled ( @xmath11 ) to strongly coupled ( @xmath36 ) triangles .",

    "<S> motivated by the recent discovery of the spin tube [ ( cucl@xmath0tachh)@xmath1cl]cl@xmath0 , we investigate the properties of a frustrated three - leg spin tube with antiferromagnetic intra - ring and inter - ring couplings . </S>",
    "<S> we pay special attention to the evolution of the properties from weak to strong inter - ring coupling and show on the basis of extensive density matrix renormalization group and exact diagonalization calculations that the system undergoes a first - order phase transition between a dimerized gapped phase at weak coupling that can be described by the usual spin - chirality model and a gapless critical phase at strong coupling that can be described by an effective spin-3/2 model . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that there is a magnetization plateau at 1/3 in the whole gapped phase and slightly beyond . </S>",
    "<S> the implications for [ ( cucl@xmath0tachh)@xmath1cl]cl@xmath0 are discussed , with the conclusion that this system behaves essentially as a spin-3/2 chain . </S>"
