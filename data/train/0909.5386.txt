    "their variances obey a heisenberg uncertainty relation , @xmath2 , with the vacuum noise variance normalized to 1/4 .",
    "a squeezed state is realized if the quantum noise of one quadrature is _ squeezed _ below the vacuum noise level , at the expense of increased noise of the other quadrature . for an overview",
    "we refer to ref .",
    "the relation between the quadrature operators and the photon number operator @xmath3 is revealed by the hamilton operator of the quantized harmonic oscillator : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the reduced planck constant and @xmath6 the light s angular frequency .",
    "one can think of the two expressions in equation  ( [ hamiltonian ] ) corresponding to the particle picture and the wave picture of quantum physics respectively . these can be used to calculate the mean photon number of squeezed states .",
    "note , that this number is always greater than zero .",
    "consider now a squeezed state without displacement in phase - space .",
    "such a state is called a squeezed _ vacuum _ state , and one can write @xmath7 . if such a state is pure , i.e. has minimum uncertainty , only _ even _ photon numbers can be observed @xcite .",
    "furthermore , if the squeezing effect is strong a so - called odd - even _ photon number oscillation _ is realized , that includes not just the existence of photon pairs but also the existence of higher even - numbers of quantum - correlated photons .",
    "+ this article presents the generation and characterization of squeezed vacuum states with strong odd - even photon number oscillations revealing a significant contribution of correlated photon numbers up to 10 and higher .",
    "this result is made possible because our squeezed vacuum states show unprecedented quality , i.e. are strongly squeezed , are of high purity , and are in a well - defined spatial gaussian fundamental mode .",

    "the optical kerr effect has recently enabled the observation of nearly 7db squeezing @xcite . in the regime of continuous - wave laser radiation ,",
    "squeezing of vacuum fluctuations by up to 10db was observed utilizing optical parametric oscillation ( opo ) below threshold @xcite .",
    "+ the squeezed vacuum states investigated here were produced via type i opo below threshold in a nonlinear standing wave cavity , similar to the experimental set - up in @xcite . in order to observe high levels of squeezing the entire experiment was optimized for low phase fluctuations and low optical loss .",
    "a schematic diagram of the experimental setup is shown in fig.[experiment](a ) .",
    "the main light source was a 2 watt continuous wave laser at 1064 nm .",
    "it was used to generate a second harmonic light field to pump the parametric squeezed light source and to provide the local oscillator ( lo ) beam for balanced homodyne detection .",
    "both laser fields were sent through travelling wave filter cavities that were kept on resonance using pound - drever - hall modulation - demodulation control schemes .",
    "the filter cavities therefore acted as optical low - pass filters that reduced potential phase noise and provided clean gaussian fundamental modes .",
    "the filtered second - harmonic pump beam had a power of up to 600mw and was subsequently injected into the opo cavity .",
    "+ in order to minimize the internal optical loss of the squeezed light source we designed the opo as a monolithic ( bi - convex ) cavity , similar to the resonator used in @xcite .",
    "it was made from a 7% doped mg : o linbo@xmath8 crystal measuring 6.5@xmath92@xmath92.5mm@xmath10 in dimensions with end faces of 8 mm radii of curvature ( see inlay in fig .  [ experiment ] ) . while the back of the crystal had a high reflection coating for both the wavelengths involved , we chose a rather low power reflectivity of 88% at 1064 nm ( and @xmath111% at 532 nm ) for the coupling front face in order to increase the ratio of out - coupling rate and cavity round trip loss .",
    "the crystal was controlled to keep its phase matching temperature close to 60c using peltier elements , and the main laser frequency was tuned to match the resonance condition of the opo cavity .",
    "an assembly drawing of the crystal mounting is shown in fig . [ experiment](b ) . +",
    "no control fields at or near the fundamental wavelength of 1064 nm were injected into the squeezed light source during data taking . thus all photons around 1064 nm leaving the opo cavity originated from the parametric down - conversion process .",
    "the out - coupled squeezed states , i.e. the photons at 1064 nm , were separated from the 532 nm pump upon reflection at a dichroic beam splitter ( dbs ) and subsequently analyzed by means of balanced homodyne detection . to this end",
    "the bright and spatially filtered lo beam was precisely adjusted to the spatial mode of the squeezed beam .",
    "we achieved a fringe visibility of 99.8% at the homodyne detector s 50/50 beam splitter , which proves that the squeezed states were indeed in a well - defined gaussian fundamental mode .",
    "+ a homodyne detector is the only known means to observe and characterize strongly squeezed states .",

    "the former results in an admixture of the vacuum state and the latter results in a mixture of phase space rotated states @xcite . here",
    ", we make the attempt to describe all the three squeezed states measured by a fixed amount of optical loss assuming zero phase noise .",
    "this approach is reasonable for the following reasons , i ) previous investigations have shown that our set - up is stable and phase noise is low @xcite , ii ) in contrast to squeezing in the audio - band @xcite , at mhz fourier frequencies no displaced or thermal states are present that could mix into the state , and iii ) no evidence was found for a non - gaussian statistic in our measured data .",
    "all 3 pairs of variances observed can then be consistently calculated using @xmath25 , where @xmath26 represent the pure state variances before any decoherence has occurred .",
    "here , @xmath27 represents the overall contribution of the vacuum state , in power . the detection efficiency @xmath28 accounts for all losses outside the squeezed light source and @xmath29",

    "figure  [ wignerfct ] presents the wigner function @xcite of the squeezed vacuum state with variances of -11.5db and 16db with respect to the vacuum noise variance .",

    "the wigner function is a phase - space _ quasi_-probability distribution , since the quadratures can not simultaneously have precisely defined values .",

    "this is also true for a mixture of a squeezed vacuum state with the ordinary vacuum state . for strongly squeezed states",
    "not just the detection of photon pairs but also of higher - order photon pairs is expected .",
    "however , the overall loss of photons must be sufficiently low to enable such an observation . since the wigner function represents the full quantum information of a state it can be used to calculate the state s density matrix @xmath36 in the photon number ( fock ) basis , which is another complete description of the state .",

    "the density matrix in the photon number basis of our -11.5db squeezed state not only reveals strong photon number oscillations but also quantum correlations between photons in the following way : whenever a photon was photo - electrically detected by the homodyne detector , there was an almost unity probability that an additional , odd number of photons were physically realized and were detected by the same detector . in photon counting experiments our squeezed state might therefore be used to overcome the problem of insufficient photon counter efficiencies .",

    "<S> squeezed states of light constitute an important nonclassical resource in the field of high - precision measurements , e.g. gravitational wave detection , as well as in the field of quantum information , e.g. for teleportation , quantum cryptography , and distribution of entanglement in quantum computation networks . </S>",
    "<S> strong squeezing in combination with high purity , high bandwidth and high spatial mode quality is desirable in order to achieve significantly improved performances contrasting any classical protocols . here </S>",
    "<S> we report on the observation of the strongest squeezing to date of 11.5db , together with unprecedented high state purity corresponding to a vacuum contribution of less than 5% , and a squeezing bandwidth of about 170mhz . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis of our squeezed states reveals a significant production of higher - order pairs of quantum - correlated photons , and the existence of strong photon number oscillations . </S>"
