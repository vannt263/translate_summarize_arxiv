    "spatial multiplexing ( v - blast ) using @xmath5 transmit antennas achieves the full - rate of @xmath5 symbols per channel use .",

    "we refer to mimo systems that simultaneously achieve both fr and fd as frfd mimo systems .",
    "one way to achieve frfd in mimo systems is to employ non - orthogonal stbcs @xcite-@xcite , which offer the full - rate of @xmath5 symbols per channel use by having @xmath6 symbols in one @xmath7 stbc matrix , and full - diversity under ml decoding .",
    "the @xmath1 golden code with 4 symbols in one stbc matrix is a well known non - orthogonal stbc for 2 transmit antennas @xcite .",
    "a drawback with frfd - achieving non - orthogonal stbcs is their high decoding complexities , because ml decoding of these stbcs involves joint decoding of @xmath6 symbols .",
    "ml decoding in v - blast , on the other hand , involves joint decoding of only @xmath5 symbols .",
    "the inability of v - blast to achieve transmit diversity can be overcome through the use of precoding at the transmitter @xcite-@xcite .",

    ", frfd can be achieved in v - blast @xcite . however , in limited feedback precoding schemes in v - blast , fd is achieved , but with some loss in rate @xcite-@xcite . for e.g. , the precoding scheme in @xcite",
    "is based on grassmannian subspace packing , which does not allow simultaneous transmission of more than @xmath8 streams ( i.e. , achievable rate is @xmath9 symbols per channel use ) . in a @xmath1 mimo system",
    ", this means a rate loss of 50% .",
    "the same is true with any other grassmannian subspace packing based scheme or transmit antenna selection based scheme @xcite .",
    "our contribution in this paper is two fold :    * first , we present a _ limited feedback _ ( lfb ) based precoding scheme for v - blast _ which achieves frfd _ in small systems like @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 mimo .",
    "since the proposed scheme is not based on subspace packing or antenna selection , there is no loss in rate .",
    "the proposed scheme involves the design of a codebook having a finite number ( @xmath10 ) of unitary precoding matrices , which are generated from a unitary matrix ( @xmath11 ) parametrized by a single angular parameter , @xmath12 the receiver chooses the precoding matrix which maximizes the minimum distance with ml decoding , and sends the corresponding index to the transmitter .",
    "we refer to the proposed scheme as frfd - vblast lfb scheme . * second , we present a ber performance comparison between the two frfd - achieving schemes , namely , the proposed frfd - vblast - lfb scheme and non - orthogonal stbc mimo using golden / perfect codes under ml decoding .",
    "our simulation results show that in a @xmath1 mimo system with 4-qam/16-qam , the proposed frfd - vblast - lfb scheme outperforms the golden code by about 0.6 db . in @xmath2 and @xmath3 mimo ,",
    "the performance of frfd - vblast - lfb scheme is comparable to the performance of perfect codes .",
    "the proposed frfd - vblast - lfb scheme is attractive because 1 ) ml decoding becomes less complex compared to that of non - orthogonal stbcs , 2 ) the number of feedback bits required to achieve the above performance is small , 3 ) in slow - fading channels it is adequate to send feedback bits only occasionally , and 4 ) in most practical wireless systems feedback channel is often available ( e.g. , for adaptive modulation , rate / power control ) .",

    "particularly , the coding gain attained by the proposed scheme over golden code is about 0.7 db at a ber of @xmath110 .",

    "[ fig4 ] for @xmath2 system shows that the proposed scheme achieves the same diversity as that of @xmath2 perfect code , but is inferior to perfect code in terms of coding gain .",
    "this performance gap , however , is small ( about 0.3 db ) . in @xmath3 system in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , the performance gap in terms of coding gain is about 1 db . this suggests that better precoding strategies for larger @xmath5 can be investigated to achieve close to perfect code performance .",
    "a likely approach can be to consider multiple parameter based precoder designs .",
    "a key advantage of the proposed precoder approach compared to the non - orthogonal stbc approach is its lesser decoding complexity .",

    "[ fig6 ] does not include the complexity involved in the optimization to choose the optimum precoding matrix at the receiver .",

    "we presented a simple , single angular parameter based codebook design for limited feedback precoding in v - blast .",

    "the decoding complexity in the proposed scheme was shown to be much less compared to that of golden / perfect codes .",
    "it is noted that the feedback channel is an additional resource required in precoding schemes .",
    "however , given that a feedback channel is often available in most practical wireless systems ( e.g. , for adaptive modulation , rate / power control , etc . ) , and that the feedback bandwidth required will be very less in slow fading , the proposed scheme can be quite attractive for its full - rate , full - diversity , and low - complexity attributes .",
