    "in this paper we present a general operational description of measurements performed with the help of the eight  port homodyne detector .",
    "this experimental setup has been extensively used in the past years in connection with the homodyne detection of optical signals @xcite and the determination of the phase of quantum states of light@xcite .",
    "the series of beautiful experiments , performed by noh , fougres and mandel ( nfm ) has provided a fully operational approach to the measurement of the quantum phase of a single mode light field .",
    "these experiments have inspired a lot of further theoretical works devoted to a general operational approach to quantum measurements in quantum optics .",
    "the nfm experiments have been treated theoretically in many different ways @xcite , however our approach will be entirely based on the concept of the operational phase space _ propensity _ @xcite and on the associated with it operational quantum observables @xcite .",
    "such a formulation , which is one of many possible descriptions of realistic measurements , is closely connected with the concept of the positive operator valued measure ( povm ) . in the operational formulation",
    "the povm replaces the spectral measure of the intrinsic quantum observable @xcite .",
    "the operational formalism has been applied to the nfm experimental device in the context of the operational definition of the hermitian phase operator @xcite . in the framework of such an approach ,",
    "the so called quantum trigonometries for the optical fields have been constructed @xcite .",
    "recently the operational theory has been applied to the homodyne detection scheme with a fixed or a random phase of the local classical oscillator@xcite .",
    "the advantage of using the operational measurement theory is that we can easily and naturally take into account the influence of the experimental device on the measured system .",
    "for example , the eight port homodyne detector is characterized by the efficiency of the detectors , the reflectance and the transmittance of the beam splitters , and the state of the quantum field entering the unused ports of the device .",
    "this additional `` noise '' field plays a fundamental role , if the nfm device is used to investigate the phase of quantum optical fields .",
    "in such a setup the impact of the correlations on the probe field and the noise field plays a crucial role in the operational definition of the quantum phase .",
    "this particular interplay between the quantum signal and the quantum noise , leaking through the unused port in the nfm device , provides the framework of the operational approach to the quantum phase .",
    "the case of the noise field being the vacuum state has been analyzed , in the spirit of the operational formalism , in ref.@xcite .",
    "these results have been generalized for the case of the squeezed vacuum state @xcite . in this paper",
    "we give a more detailed discussion of the squeezed vacuum state case and present general results obtained for an arbitrary noise field .    in section",
    "ii we shortly review the operational approach to the measurement in quantum mechanics .",
    "in section iii we derive the operational probability density  propensity for an arbitrary noise field in the nfm apparatus . in section",
    "iv we derive the operational homodyne observables for the eight - port homodyne detection scheme .",
    "section v is devoted to the discussion of the quantum trigonometry , generated in the operational phase measurements in the nfm device , with the noise being a squeezed vacuum .",
    "finally , some concluding remarks are presented .",
    "the approach to the quantum mechanical theory of measurement that will be used in this paper was described in details in ref .",
    "below we just recall the main results of this work in order to make the paper self - contained .",
    "the statistical outcomes of an ideal measurement of a certain observable @xmath0 : @xmath1 are described by the spectral measure @xcite : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the state vector of the measured system .",
    "it is known that the spectral measure contains all the relevant statistical information about the investigated system but it makes no reference to the apparatus employed in the actual measurement . due to this property @xmath0",
    "will be called an _ intrinsic quantum observable_.    the description of more realistic measurements necessarily involves additional degrees of freedom such as , for example , the unused ports of the beam splitters or the local oscillator being the phase calibrating device . in such an approach , in order to describe the quantum mechanical measurement , we have to work in the _ extended _ hilbert space @xmath4 , containing both the hilbert space of the investigated system @xmath5 and the hilbert space @xmath6 of all the additional measuring devices , which will be called for short a _ filter_. the process of measurement is described by the interaction between the system and the filter . because we are interested only in the properties of the system",
    ", we shall reduce the degrees of freedom by tracing the dynamical evolution in the combined hilbert space over the filter hilbert space obtaining in such a way an operational _ propensity _ @xmath7 , which is nothing else but a probability distribution of a certain classical quantity @xmath8 measured in a real experiment .",
    "this propensity , for arbitrary density operator @xmath9 of the system , is @xmath10 with the normalization condition @xmath11 where @xmath12 is a filter dependent povm .",
    "we see that in a realistic measurement , involving a filter , the spectral decomposition of @xmath0 is effectively replaced by a positive valued measure @xmath13 @xcite .    in view of the linear relation between the propensity and the povm , the operational statistical moments of the measured quantity @xmath14",
    "define uniquely an algebra of _ operational operators _",
    "@xmath15 where @xmath16 these operators are called operational operators , because they represent quantities measured in a real experiment i.e. , described by a dynamical coupling of the measured system and the filter . as a rule ,",
    "the algebraic properties of the set @xmath17 differ significantly from those of the powers of @xmath0 .",
    "for instance , @xmath18 .",
    "this property will have important consequences in the discussion of the uncertainty introduced by the measurement .",
    "it is seen that the propensity and the operational operators are natural equivalents of the spectral probability distribution and the intrinsic operators .",
    "the difference being that the operational observables carry information about the system under investigation and the selected measuring device , which is represented in this paper by the eight - port homodyne detector .",
    "in this section we derive a general formula for the povm that describe the nfm device with an arbitrary noise filed leaking through the unused port of the beam splitter .",
    "we shall assume that the nfm apparatus has unit detectors efficiency , that a 50%:50% beam splitters are used and that the local oscillator is classical .",
    "we assume that we want to measure an observable @xmath19 .",
    "in general such an observable requires additional informations about the particular ordering of the boson creation @xmath20 and annihilation @xmath21 operators .",
    "for example the quantum observable that corresponds to the polar decomposition of the amplitude of a field mode could be defined as @xmath22 , however this formula is not unique because of the possible different ordering of the boson operators . due to the ordering problem , there is no canonical way of selecting the right , i.e. , the physically justified ordering .",
    "the operational approach removes this ordering ambiguity .",
    "we shall perform a measurement of this observable using the nmf device . in this case",
    "the filter hilbert space is reduced to a hilbert space @xmath23 , where @xmath24 denotes the quantized mode leaking through the unused port . in the extended filter ",
    "system space @xmath25 the observable @xmath26 will be the following function of the creation and annihilation operators @xmath27 where the operators @xmath28 represent the probe field and the operators @xmath29 describe the noise field , i.e. the filter degrees of freedom . in this extended space ,",
    "the combination @xmath30 do commute with @xmath31 and such operators can be measured simultaneously . in the case of the unimodular phase operator",
    "the combination @xmath32 is operationally unique and the extended field modes can be simultaneously measurable .",
    "a similar approach to the measurement of a simple quantum system , using an extension by an additional degree of freedom , has been used by einstein podolsky and rosen @xcite . in their case",
    "the particle system with the non commuting position and momentum operators @xmath33 and @xmath34 has been extended to commuting observables @xmath35 and @xmath36 , where @xmath37 and @xmath38 can be seen as the momentum and the position of the filter .",
    "this physical procedure has a counterpart in mathematics , and is called the naimark extension of the povm into a projective measure on a larger hilbert space @xcite .",
    "the set of operational operators corresponding to the powers of the operator @xmath0 in the extended filter ",
    "system are defined as @xmath39 we will assume that the noise field density matrix @xmath40 can be expressed in the normally order form i.e. , all the annihilation operators are to the right of the creation operators .",
    "this is true for all physically interesting cases discussed in the literature .",
    "provided that this condition is fulfilled we can rewrite the above expression , using the coherent state decomposition of unity , in the following way @xmath41 this formula gives us the form of the povm for the experimental nfm setup with arbitrary noise : @xmath42 with the normalization : @xmath43 such a result has a simple meaning in terms of shifts in the coherent state phase space of the signal field . in order to measure the signal mode we have to probe it with a filter state shifted in the phase space by the amount @xmath44 , and sum up over all possible manifolds of shifts@xcite .    as an example of this general approach",
    "we find explicitly the povm for several interesting cases of the filter state .",
    "for the vacuum state @xmath45 the corresponding povm is @xmath46 where we employed the following identity @xcite @xmath47}:\\:,\\ ] ] and have denoted the normal ordering by semicolons .",
    "this result has been obtained already in ref .",
    "another interesting state is the squeezed vacuum state @xcite @xmath48 } : \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which leads to the povm in the form @xmath49 which has been derived in ref .",
    "the squeezed state is generated from the ground state by the action of the squeezing operator @xmath50 and the glauber displacement operator @xmath51 .",
    "similarly , for the fock state @xmath52 we obtain @xmath53 which equals to the povm from the ref .",
    "@xcite introduced in the context of the operational position and momentum measurement .",
    "as a first application of the above described formalism we shall discuss the operational measurement of the homodyne quadratures .",
    "such a discussion has already been carried in @xcite , for a homodyne detection in the standard configuration i.e. , with one beam splitter and two detectors . here",
    "we present the operational observables associated with the joint measurements of two field quadratures with the help of the nfm apparatus .",
    "we will also slightly generalize our previous considerations , assuming that the beam splitter , which mixes the probe field with the noise field has an arbitrary transmittance coefficient @xmath54 and that the noise filed is a squeezed vacuum .",
    "as before , we shall assume that the local oscillator is a strong coherent filed described by @xmath55 .    in the extended filter ",

    "the second factor of the generating operators may be seen as an operator ordering parameter introduced by cahill and glauber @xcite . by varying the filter parameters we can select a particular ordering , for example for @xmath68 the creation and the annihilation operators",
    "are ordered antinormally @xmath69 for the discussed experimental nfm scheme , no selection of the parameters can lead to a normal ordering .",
    "the operational quadratures might be calculated explicitly @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the @xmath60-th hermite polynomial and we have scaled the results by setting @xmath72 . for the purpose of further discussion",
    "we write explicitly the first two operational moments for both quadratures @xmath73 we see that for @xmath74 or @xmath75 we are restricted to the measurement of either @xmath76 or @xmath77 , which are , in this case , equal to the powers of the intrinsic operators .    for simplicity , let assume that the phase of the squeezing vacuum is such that @xmath78 , then the functions @xmath79 becomes simpler @xmath80 and the operational spread defined as @xmath81 reads for both quadratures @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the intrinsic quantum dispersion .    we note that for the selected filter parameters one of the operational quadratures is squeezed and the second one is enhanced .",
    "this behavior is the same as for the intrinsic quadratures @xcite , however the measuring device introduces an additional factor contributing to the whole operational spread .",
    "each operational spread contains two parts , the first part is the intrinsic uncertainty weighted by the factor @xmath54 ( or @xmath84 ) and the second part is the noise with the weight @xmath84 ( or @xmath54 ) introduced by the experimental device . the origin of these additional terms is clear .",
    "the nfm experimental setup enables us to perform a _ joint _ measurement of two quadratures in the extended hilbert space . in the reduced space of the signal mode",
    "we pick up an additional noise due to the leaking noise mode through the unused ports in the nfm apparatus .    by changing the transmittance coefficient we can select which quadrature",
    "will be measured and how precise this measurement will be .",
    "if we set @xmath75 or @xmath74 we measure only one quadrature and the moments of the operational operators equal to the powers of the intrinsic homodyne observables .",
    "the operational result reduces to the intrinsic observable in this case because we have assumed perfect photodetectors with 100% efficiency .",
    "the non ideal detectors can be described by a homodyne setup with perfect detectors , and a beam splitter with a certain effective transmittivity .",
    "the beam splitter mixes the incoming signal with the vacuum field and the results of the calculations are formally the same as those carried on for the non ideal detector @xcite .",
    "it s worth to notice that in fact the nfm experimental scheme may be used for such a description of a quadrature measurement with a non ideal photodetector .",
    "in such a case we may forget about the upper right part of the nfm apparatus and see that the setup reduces to the situation described in @xcite .",
    "in such a scheme there is a beam splitter in front of a pair of ideal detectors .",
    "if we put the squeezing parameter equal to 0 , the operational observables obtained in this paper reduce to those obtained in@xcite .",
    "we see that there are two possible and mathematically equivalent descriptions of the operational measurement performed with help of the nfm device . in one description",
    "the experiment is a simultaneous measurement of two operational quadratures with the help of ideal photodetectors with the nfm apparatus noise . in the other description ,",
    "we perform a standard homodyne experiment , with a non unit quantum efficiency of the photo - detectors simulated by the beam splitter .",
    "such a beam splitter is mixing the probe signal with the vacuum state and the effective transmittance coefficient plays the role of the photodetector efficiency .",
    "another possible choice of the parameters leads us to the operational momentum and position operators derived in @xcite , indeed for @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 our results can be reduced to the special case of the results from this reference , with the filter being in the vacuum state .",
    "the of operational operators @xmath76 become then the operational moments of the position operator whereas @xmath77 the operational moments of the momentum operator .",
    "originally the nfm experiments have been devoted to the measurement of the relative phase between a high  intensity classical field and a low  intensity laser field .",
    "the quantities which were investigated in these experiments were built out of the field quadratures ( [ quad1 ] ) and ( [ quad2 ] ) ( with transmittance @xmath85 ) .",
    "these operators have been constructed in such a way that they can play the role of the commuting `` sine '' and `` cosine '' operators . as a result",
    "the phase of the quantum probe field has been defined operationally , avoiding all the problems associated with the construction of a hermitian phase operator in quantum mechanics@xcite .",
    "it was shown @xcite that one can associate with the nfm experiment an operational phase operator .    in this section",
    "we extend this theoretical analysis for the case of the noise field being in a squeezed vacuum state ( the original nfm experiments have been done with the vacuum state ) .",
    "we will show how to define an operator corresponding to any function of the phase . as a example we derive operators corresponding to the trigonometric functions .",
    "these operators form the squeezed quantum trigonometry of operational observables for the nmf setup .",
    "we shall start our discussion , introducing an amplitude marginal of the povm for the nfm device @xmath88    from this povm , we construct the corresponding phase propensity @xmath89 which is a periodic function of phase , normalized to unity @xmath90      we define here the set of operational operators , which in the classical limit can be reduced to the fourier expansion basis . the problem of constructing the operators corresponding to the classical phase dependent quantities has been solved in ref . @xcite .",
    "because every periodic function can be expressed in terms of its fourier decomposition @xmath91 we will construct the operational quantum analogs of @xmath92  so called _ phasors _  in the following way @xmath93 the reality of the propensity implies @xmath94 because of the normalization condition ( [ normalization ] ) we have @xmath95 .    as we have seen in the previous sections",
    ", the function @xmath96 corresponds in the nfm device to the following operational operator @xmath97 which is a function of the boson creation and annihilation operators of the probe field .",
    "because we have derived the povm operator @xmath98 for the nfm setup with an arbitrary noise field ( [ filter ] ) , we can derive the explicit expression for the phasor @xmath99 straight from the definition ( [ op_operator ] ) .",
    "once these operators are known , the operational quantum operator can be calculated using a fourier series expansion . because of this we will call the set @xmath100 the phasor basis .",
    "the definition of the phasors introduced in @xcite requires , that these operators become in the classical limit functions of the phase only .    in order to find the phasor basis we start with the formula obtained in @xcite @xmath101 where we have replaced the vacuum state of the filter by the squeezed vacuum state .",
    "the complex number @xmath44 denotes the amplitude of the classical reference field of the local oscillator .",
    "the unitary operator @xmath102 is defined as follows @xmath103 where @xmath104 are given by ( [ quad1 ] ) and ( [ quad2 ] ) with the beam splitter transmittivity @xmath85 .",
    "simple algebra gives @xmath105 we recognize in this expression the unimodular operator ( [ unimodular ] ) . in this way we obtain an equivalent expression for @xmath99 @xmath106^{\\frac{k}{2 } } } \\hat{s}(s,\\phi)|0\\rangle\\langle 0|\\hat{s}^{\\dagger}(s,\\phi ) \\right\\},\\ ] ] with @xmath107 .",
    "negative values of @xmath108 in ( [ phasor ] ) may be derived using ( [ reality ] ) .    because operator @xmath102 obeys the assumptions imposed on the operator @xmath109 defined in ( [ o ] ) we can write the formula for the phasor using ( [ o_operational ] ) as follows : @xmath110 is the povm associated with the described experimental scheme .",
    "it is clear , that the povm , contrary to spectral measure , depends on experimental device .",
    "in fact , for each value of squeezing parameter @xmath111 we obtain a different propensity a different povm and a different phasor basis , even though the probe field remains unchanged .",
    "an exact formula for the phasor may be derived straight from ( [ phasor - int ] ) , @xmath112^{\\frac{k}{2 } } \\vdots \\hat{s}^{\\dagger}(s,-\\phi).\\ ] ] where @xmath113 denotes the antinormal ordering .",
    "when the squeezing parameter @xmath111 tends to zero the above formula reduces to the one from @xcite .      in this section",
    "we find various phase space representations for the simple combinations of the phasor basis .",
    "using these relations we derive the trigonometric operational operators .",
    "these trigonometric operators will be defined in accordance with ( [ fourier ] ) .",
    "we have the following operators @xmath114 that correspond to the trigonometric functions @xmath115 and @xmath116 respectively . as it was stressed earlier and follows from definition of the phasors @xmath117 .",
    "consequently , the pythagorean theorem @xmath118 is obeyed by @xmath119 , but not by @xmath120 and @xmath121 .",

    "such a dramatic change of the cosine quadratures occurs because in the limit of small @xmath149 , purely quantum effects of the squeezed vacuum are important .",
    "the squeezing allows one of the quadratures to be reduced below the vacuum level represented by a uniformly distributed random phase .",
    "the uniform distribution of the phase corresponding to the vacuum state leads to an operational wigner function for @xmath159 equal to @xmath175 . for a squeezed vacuum ,",

    "those results are even more clear in view of our previous analysis of operational quadratures ( [ quad1 ] ) and ( [ quad2 ] ) .",
    "we see straight from the definition of @xmath102 ( [ u - def ] ) , that operational operators @xmath151 and @xmath150 are just normalized homodyne quadratures , so their dependence on squeezing phase and @xmath111 may be understood as if they were homodyne quadratures .",
    "these operators are also quantum analogs of certain classical functions of the phase of the electromagnetic field . because of this they posses a much richer structure and this enable , for example , to investigate the phase properties of the quantum optical fields .",
    "we have presented an operational theory of the eight - port homodyne detection scheme .",
    "for such a measuring apparatus , we have derived the operational quadrature operators for an arbitrary noise field leaking through the unused port . in the framework of the operational approach we have derived the quantum propensity , the povm and the corresponding operational observables for the nfm device . for the noise field being the squeezed vacuum",
    "we have constructed the quantum trigonometry and the corresponding wigner functions .",
