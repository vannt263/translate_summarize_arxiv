    "the @xmath0 scattering is a process thoroughly studied experimentally and , in fact , we have experimental data since sixties . from the theoretical point of view , it is the basic hadronic process involving baryons and one of the most important test ground for chiral perturbation theory with baryons ( bchpt ) . the first attempt to study this process using bchpt",
    "was performed by gasser , sainio and svarc in their seminal work using a fully covariant approach . in this work",
    ", they realized that when one deals with nucleons , a new heavy scale appears in the chpt formalism that does _ not vanishes in the chiral limit _ and spoils the standard power counting of chpt . in order to solve this problem ,",
    "jenkins and manohar invented the heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory approach hbchpt , which integrates out the heavy degrees of freedom of the nucleon expanding the lagrangian in series @xmath3 , with @xmath4 the nucleon mass .",
    "this formalism describes well the low - energy physical region at the cost of losing lorentz invariance , although it does not converge in the subthreshold region .",
    "this means that we can not check some chiral symmetry predictions for qcd ( low energy theorems ) . in order to solve this problem of convergence ,",
    "becher and leutwyler invented the infrared regularization scheme ( ir ) @xcite , that recovers the standard power counting of chpt keeping manifest lorentz invariance .",
    "this improves the convergence with respect to hbchpt and converges in the subthreshold region .",
    "however , as was show in , the one - loop representation is not precise enough to allow an accurate extrapolation of the physical data to the cheng - dashen point to extract the value of @xmath5 .",
    "later works showed that the ir description of the phase shifts are of the same quality as those of hbchpt @xcite , although a _ huge _ and _ strongly scale dependent _ goldberger - treiman ( gt ) relation deviation is found in this scheme .",
    "in fact , the scale dependence is one of the main characteristics of ir .",
    "another important limitation of ir comes out when we reach energies that can make the mandelstam variable @xmath6 ( this energy corresponds to @xmath7  gev for @xmath0 scattering ) , because in this case the amplitudes develop an unphysical cut that limits the high energy description and , therefore , the applicability of unitarization methods @xcite .",
    "this unphysical cut is also responsible for a bad prediction for the magnetic moments when using this scheme @xcite . in order to overcome the problems that one encounters in the ir scheme keeping the good analytical properties of a covariant approach , we calculated de @xmath0 scattering amplitude in chpt up to @xmath8 in the chiral expansion , using the so - called _ extended - on - mass - shell _ scheme ( eoms )",
    "this scheme recovers the spirit of the full covariant approach performed by but keeping the standard power counting of chpt through a renormalization of the low energy constants ( lecs ) that appear in the lagrangian .",
    "so , the eoms scheme can be considered as a second renormalization in the sense that the first renormalization would be the @xmath9 renormalization that cancel the infinities that come from the loop diagrams , and the eoms renormalization is the renormalization that cancel the power counting breaking terms ( pcbt ) that appear in the covariant approach .",
    "the proof that this renormalization can cancel _ all _ the pcbt comes form the ir formalism because becher and leutwyler proved that all the pcbt are contained in what they called the _ regular part _ of the loop integral , that is analytical in the quark masses and momenta , so that means that can be absorbed in the most general lagrangian .",
    "the advantages of this scheme over the ir one are @xcite : 1 ) we do _ not _ have to deal with any scale dependence , 2 ) the contribution of the loop diagrams to the gt deviation is very small ( @xmath10 ) that is of the size of what we would expect from explicit symmetry breaking , 3 ) our amplitudes are free from unphysical cuts , what means that they have the right analytical properties in the whole energy plane . in this proceeding",
    "we will focus on the comparison between both covariant methods : eoms and ir .",
    "to compare fairly both methods we proceed with eoms in the same way as we did with ir , so we perform the perturbative study as in @xcite .",
    "we considered the partial wave analyses ( pwas ) of the karlsruhe group @xcite ( ka85 ) and the current solution of the george washington university group @xcite ( wi08 ) , assigning the same errors as we did in @xcite .",
    "the results of the fits are shown in fig .",
    "[ ka85-pert ] and fig .",
    "[ wi08-pert ]    .comparison between lecs and the resulting @xmath11 in the different approaches of bchpt .",
    "[ lecs ] [ cols= \" > , > , > , > , > , > \" , ]     the fitted values of the lecs are given in table [ lecs ] . in this table",
    "one can compare the eoms results with those of the ir and hbchpt methods .",
    "one can see that the eoms results for the lecs are compatible with both approaches being able to give a better description than ir ( lower @xmath12 ) . at this point",
    "it is important to stress two things : first , we see in fig .",
    "[ ka85-pert ] and fig .",
    "[ wi08-pert ] that with the eoms scheme we do not have the problems that we encountered in @xcite when we tried to fit the @xmath13 phase shift of wi08 with the ir scheme ( dashed line fig .",
    "[ wi08-pert ] ) .",
    "second , and more important , with the eoms scheme we solved the problem of the huge @xmath11 of the ir scheme that jeopardized the applicability of chpt to the @xmath0 system . within the eoms scheme we can _",
    "extract from data _",
    "values for @xmath11 compatible with the ones reported by the corresponding pwas . although the values presented in table [ lecs ] for the eoms result may be consider not very accurate and quite large for ka85-eoms , it is important to stress that these results can be considerably improved once we include explicitly the @xmath14 in our eoms calculation @xcite . in this case we obtain very accurate predictions for @xmath11 that are perfectly compatible with their corresponding pwas @xcite . for a deeper understanding of what is happening in the covariant methods",
    ", we will explain briefly the method used for the extraction of the gt deviation .",
    "as we did in @xcite , the method consist in taking the limit :    @xmath15    where @xmath16 and @xmath17 mean the full amplitude calculated up to @xmath8 and @xmath18 respectively . in chpt @xmath11 is directly related to the lec @xmath19 plus a higher order contribution due to the loops ( @xmath20 ) :    @xmath21    from fits to pwas one obtains a natural value for @xmath19 from both covariant schemes ( eoms and ir ) , but when one calculates explicitly the value of @xmath20 it turns out that the ir scheme gives huge values that depend strongly on the renormalization scale ( @xmath22 ) @xcite while eoms gives a _ scale - independent value that is of the size that we would expect form explicit chiral symmetry breaking _ ( @xmath10 ) , solving the long standing problem that covariant bchpt had with this observable .",
    "this means that the huge @xmath11 is due to the ir prescription , not to a problem of bchpt .",
    "another limitation that we encountered in the ir scheme concerns to the applicability of unitarization techniques to the perturbative calculation . in ir we found that unitarization techniques are limited up to @xmath23  gev due to the unphysical cut that this scheme introduces @xcite .",
    "so , it is interesting to study if a covariant calculation without this unphysical cut could improve the description of the phase shifts . with this aim",
    "we implement unitarity to the eoms - bchpt @xmath0 amplitude and take care of the analyticity properties associated with the right - hand cut writing our unitarized amplitude @xmath24 by means of an interaction kernel @xmath25 and the unitary pion - nucleon loop function @xmath26 :    @xmath27    where @xmath24 is the amplitude with definite isospin @xmath28 , total angular momentum @xmath29 and orbital angular momentum @xmath30 . written in this form",
    ", @xmath24 satisfies unitarity _ exactly _ and the interaction kernel @xmath25 can be obtained by matching order by order with the perturbative result . on the other hand ,",
    "the subtraction constant @xmath31 contained in the unitary pion - nucleon loop function @xmath26 is fixed by requiring that @xmath32 vanishes in the nucleon pole @xmath33 so in this point we recover the perturbative calculation and keep the @xmath13 nucleon pole in its right position . on the other hand , in order to take into account the contribution of the @xmath14 we introduce , in the @xmath34 partial wave , a castillejo - dalitz - dyson pole ( cdd ) that is a pole that conserves the discontinuities of the partial wave amplitude across the cuts . for this partial wave ,",
    "the unitarized amplitude reads : @xmath35 , where the cdd corresponds to @xmath36 , and gives rise to a zero at @xmath37 in @xmath38 .    in both fig .",
    "[ ka85-uni ] and fig .",
    "[ wi08-uni ] one can see how the kernel calculated in the eoms scheme provides a good description of the phase shifts up to @xmath39  gev while ir can only reproduce them up to @xmath23  gev due to the unphysical cut that this scheme introduces .",
    "this corresponds to an increase of @xmath40  mev in @xmath2 compared to ir . on the other hand",
    "the cdd is able to reproduce perfectly the raise of the @xmath34 phase shift due to the @xmath14 , and if one compares the description of the unitarized and the perturbative amplitudes , one finds a drastic increase in the energy region of the data ( @xmath1  mev in @xmath2 ) .",
    "in summary , the @xmath0 scattering is a fundamental process that provides the basic test for chpt with baryons .",
    "there have been many attempts to describe this process in bchpt but every approach has had their own problems : _ lack of convergence , unphysical cuts , unphysically large gt deviation _ , etc .",
    "these problems questioned the applicability of chpt to the @xmath0 system . in this work we showed that bchpt in the eoms scheme",
    "solves these issues providing a chiral representation that converges , and giving rise to a gt violation in good agreement with phenomenology .",
    "this and other important quantities such as the @xmath5 can be extracted form pwas accurately and reliably once we introduce explicitly the contribution of the @xmath14 in our calculations , as we showed in @xcite , and that part will be explained in @xcite .",
    "it is also very interesting to show the potential of the unitarization techniques applied to a kernel with good analytical properties . in this work",
    "we show that with this unitarization method we could increase the range of our description up to @xmath39  gev , that means an improvement of @xmath1  mev in @xmath2 with respect to the perturbative calculation .",
    "compared with ir , the unitarized eoms amplitudes achieve a good description up to energies @xmath40  mev higher in @xmath2 ."
