    "lhcb  @xcite , one of the four main experiments at the lhc , is designed to make measurements of cp violation and rare b decays in the forward region ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "however , it can also make precision electroweak measurements at high rapidities which enable it to probe the proton parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) in hitherto unmeasured regions .    part of lhcb s pseudorapidity range ( @xmath1 ) overlaps that of atlas and cms , however measurements made at @xmath2 are unique to lhcb .",
    "other distinguishing features are the lower luminosity which reduces the number of pile - up events ( one year of nominal running should collect 2 fb@xmath3 of data ) , and the ability to trigger on low transverse momentum muons , @xmath4 , down to 1 gev / c .",
    "we describe results of simulation studies  @xcite that show lhcb will be able to trigger on and reconstruct z and w bosons with high efficiency and purity .",
    "phenomenologically lhcb differs from the other experiments since the production of w and z here occurs predominantly through sea - valence interactions , in contrast to the sea - sea interactions in the central region  @xcite .",
    "we also present studies of the drell - yan production of low - mass muon pairs which suggest that lhcb can isolate such events down to invariant masses , @xmath5 , of 5 gev / c@xmath6 .",
    "we discuss the implications that such measurements will have on constraining the proton pdfs : in particular , the drell - yan final states allow us to probe values of the parton momentum fraction , @xmath7 , down to @xmath8 , a previously unexplored region .",
    "z boson decays to dimuons possess a distinctive signature that allow them to be triggered  @xcite and reconstructed with high efficiency and purity .",
    "the dimuon trigger at lhcb is very loose and requires two muon candidates whose summed transverse momentum exceeds 1.6 gev / c .",
    "offline selections suppress background processes by requiring : that both muons candidates have little activity in the hadronic calorimeter ; that the higher and lower transverse momentum muons are greater than 20 gev / c and 15 gev / c respectively ; that both have impact parameters consistent with the primary interaction ; and their combined invariant mass lies within 20 gev / c@xmath6 of the z mass .",
    "backgrounds have been studied  @xcite from other electroweak processes ( @xmath9 decays , @xmath10 decays , w + jet production , ww production ) ; quark production ( @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and single top ) ; and pions and kaons misidentified as muons .    for z bosons decaying to two muons which are within the lhcb acceptance ,",
    "the selection efficiency is @xmath14% and the purity is estimated to be @xmath15 % with the dominant background ( @xmath16% ) being mis - identified hadrons whose contribution will be precisely determined from data . after just 50 pb@xmath3 of data ,",
    "the cross - section measurement will be limited by systematic uncertainties to about 1% , assuming the machine luminosity can be precisely determined .",
    "the dominant uncertainty in the theoretical prediction comes from knowledge of the pdfs and is from 2 - 5% depending on rapidity , and thus an experimental measurement of the z cross - section will constrain the pdfs .",
    "r0.65     the sensitivity of the pdfs to a measurement of the z cross - section can be seen in figure  [ zpred ] where we have plotted the variation in the differential cross - section produced using the mcfm generator  @xcite with @xmath17 variations in each of the 20 eigenvectors  @xcite in the mstw07 parametrisation  @xcite .",
    "superimposed upon these are the expected experimental uncertainties with 1fb@xmath3 of data , assuming that the luminosity is known .",
    "current estimates for the precision on a luminosity determination are from 1 to 3% using the beam - gas technique  @xcite , or by measuring the elastic two - photon production of leptons  @xcite .",
    "however , even in the absence of a precise luminosity determination , information about the pdfs can be derived from the _ shape _ of the differential distribution @xmath18 ; only the overall normalisation is fixed by the luminosity .",
    "w boson decays to a lepton plus neutrino have previously been observed at hadron colliders by observing high momentum leptons in association with missing transverse energy , a quantity that can not be measured well at lhcb since it is only instrumented in the forward region .",
    "nonetheless , our studies indicate that the presence of a single high transverse momentum muon which makes up the dominant observed activity in the event , is sufficent to select a rather clean samples of ws .",
    "first we require the presence of a high transverse momentum muon , . defining the asymmetry , @xmath19 , between two quantities @xmath7 and @xmath20 to be we compare the muon momentum , @xmath21 , to the summed momentum of every other charged particle detected in lhcb , @xmath22 , and require that @xmath23 . whereas the signal is peaked towards 1 , backgrounds coming from semi - leptonic b decays or mis - identified pions are strongly peaked towards -1 .",
    "the combination of these requirements has an overall selection efficiency of about 33% and a purity of 83% .",
    "again , the dominant background is due to misidentifying a pion as a muon .",
    "it is noteworthy that in lhcb , z decays form a small ( 3% ) but irreducible background , caused when only one of the dimuons enters the lhcb acceptance .",
    "a full study of systematic errors is ongoing though it is expected that a similar experimental precision to the z channel ( 1% ) can be obtained .",
    "the comparison to the theoretical prediction is complicated by the fact that the w boson itself can not be reconstructed .",
    "consequently we have compared our distributions to the theoretical expectations for the differential distributions expressed as a function of lepton rapidities .",
    "once again knowledge of the pdfs are the dominant uncertainties ( ranging from 2% to 4% for mstw07 ) and so the experimental data can constrain the pdfs .    the uncertainty due to luminosity",
    "can be removed by comparing ratios and asymmetries of the @xmath24 and @xmath25 differential cross - sections in such a way as to minimise or maximise the dependence on the pdfs  @xcite .",
    "the ratio @xmath26 is then almost independent of pdf uncertainties and thus constitutes a precise electroweak prediction for the lhc .",
    "the ratio @xmath27 has an uncertainty that rises from @xmath28 at @xmath29 to 20% at @xmath30 and at high rapidities , which only lhcb can measure , is sensitive to the large-@xmath7 @xmath31 ratio of partons .",
    "measuring the asymmetry @xmath32 will greatly constrain the pdfs since the current theoretical uncertainty on this quantity is about 10% at all rapidities .",
    "dimuons produced below the z resonance can be recorded down to an invariant mass of using the dimuon trigger . however , isolating the signal from the order - of - magnitude larger backgrounds coming from semileptonic heavy quark decays and pion misidentification is challenging . considering the topology of",
    "the signal leads us to consider five observables : the momenta of each of the muons ( @xmath33 ) ; the summed momenta of all particles found within a cone of one unit of phi and pseudorapidity about each muon ( @xmath34 ) ; and the summed momenta of any other activity in the event ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "five asymmetries are defined : ; ; ; ; ; whose shapes are almost independent of the invariant mass of the muons .",
    "these variables are combined to form a likelihood .",
    "cutting progressively harder on this likelihood increases the purity of the signal though at the expense of efficiency .",
    "our studies show that above a dimuon invariant mass of 10 gev / c@xmath6 , purities above 95% can be obtained retaining between 15% and 50% of triggered signal events , so that the total number of selected events per mass bin is roughly constant . below 10 gev / c@xmath6 pure signals",
    "can not be obtained although measurements of the cross - section may be possible down to 5 gev / c@xmath6 where 5% of the signal events can be retained with a purity of 70% .",
    "r0.39     the experimental precision obtainable on the double differential distribution , @xmath36 , is compared with the current theoretical uncertainties due to the pdfs in figure  [ dyth ] . with 1 fb@xmath3 of data , and with bins of 0.1 in rapidity and 2 gev / c@xmath6 in mass , a statistical precision of a few percent per bin",
    "is obtainable , though systematic uncertainties remain to be determined and could be larger at low masses where the backgrounds are greater .",
    "the theoretical uncertainties at low invariant masses is substantial and driven by knowledge of the small-@xmath7 gluon , approaching 60% at high rapidities for @xmath37gev / c@xmath6 .    within the first year of data - taking ,",
    "lhcb should thus start to constrain the gluon pdf and make significant improvements on current knowledge after a few years . at high rapidities and values of @xmath38gev / c@xmath6",
    ", lhcb will be able to probe @xmath7 values down to @xmath8 where the pdfs are currently unknown .",
    "the lhcb experiment can access a unique range of @xmath7 and q@xmath6 at the lhc .",
    "ratios and asymmetries of the w and z cross - sections will be experimentally determined to 1% constraining the pdfs which currently have a theoretical uncertainty of 2 - 5% at @xmath39gev / c@xmath6",
    ". studies of low invariant mass drell - yan dimuon states indicate that lhcb can rapidly improve the knowledge of pdfs down to @xmath7 values of @xmath8 and q@xmath6 of 5 gev / c@xmath6 and significantly improve our knowledge of the small-@xmath7 gluon .",
