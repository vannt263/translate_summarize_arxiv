[ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      in the previous sections , we have shown that for the trn metric , relativistic images in the braneworld are slightly fainter for relativistic images around supermassive black holes and are greatly enhanced for primordial black holes .",
    "the distinction between the results in the case of primordial and supermassive black holes benefits from looking at the two components in eq .",

    "the two component magnifications are termed tangential magnification ( @xmath78 ) and radial magnification ( @xmath79 ) and are defined as    @xmath80    @xcite approximates both of these quantities and puts them in analytical form :    @xmath81    from eq .",
    "( [ eq : mut ] ) , the tangential magnification of a relativistic image is directly proportional to the image position of the relativistic image .",
    "this will always be larger when using a braneworld metric because of the strengthened gravity in the braneworld metric .",

    "so , the tangential magnification is always larger in the braneworld scenario , sometimes considerably greater .    the variation in behavior of braneworld magnifications as mass changes comes from the radial magnification . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : mur ] ) , it is apparent that for small radial magnifications ( which is always the case for relativistic images ) , radial magnifications are proportional to :    @xmath85    this relation can be physically motivated- @xmath36 is a measure of the photon sphere s size .",
    "this is because the coordinate of relativistic image is close to the location of the photon sphere .",
    "magnification of the relativistic image is @xmath86 , so when @xmath87 is rescaled to reflect a larger photon sphere , the derivative becomes larger as well .",
    "the term @xmath88 defines how quickly images decay towards towards the photon sphere for the n@xmath89 image .",
    "if @xmath88 is greater , the image will shift more with a change in source position and therefore , the radial magnification will be brighter .",

    "[ fig : sfo ] , the quantity @xmath90 is equal to 1 for a schwarzschild metric and becomes smaller as @xmath94 becomes large and asymtotes to @xmath95 . the quantity @xmath96 in a schwarzschild spacetime , but asymptotes to @xmath97 for a 5 dimensional spacetime .",
    "therefore , @xmath88 ( for @xmath98 ) varies from @xmath99 in the schwarzschild limit to @xmath100 in the @xmath101 limit .",
    "when tidal charge is weaker ( supermassive black hole ) , @xmath36 is not much larger than the @xmath102 value , the smaller @xmath88 term dominates and the relativistic image is demagnified .",
    "when there is a great deal of tidal charge ( @xmath84 ) , the great increase in @xmath36 makes up for the @xmath88 term and the relativistic image is brighter compared to its schwarzschild counterpart .    for all black holes , relativistic images will be at a larger image position when using a braneworld metric , because the photon sphere of a braneworld metric is larger than its schwarzschild counterpart .",
    "hence , the tangential magnification is always higher using a braneworld . radial magnification , as we have shown , depends on the value of the tidal charge . for a given source and lens position ,",
    "the radial magnification is lower bounded , even as @xmath93 gets very large , but the tangential mangification is not upper bounded . for a large enough tidal charge , magnification will be enhanced for a braneworld image .",
    "in sec . [ sec : sfl ] , constructing a logarithmic approximation for the bending angle depends on the relationship in eq .",
    "( [ eq : relation ] ) between the impact parameter and the minimum radial coordinate . when expanding @xmath103 in orders of @xmath39 and @xmath40 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : firstorder ] ) is obtained by truncating at the first non - zero term in both @xmath104 and @xmath22 .",
    "however , the relationship between @xmath40 and @xmath39 is not being considered at an infinitesimal distance from the photon sphere .",
    "for example , in a schwarzschild geometry , the first relativistic einstein ring occurs with approximately @xmath105 @xcite , which corresponds to @xmath106 .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath107 . to be able to approximate the bending angle with a logarithmic term",

    "our goal in this section is to perform a general analysis of the higher order terms in the general case and then apply it to show the validity of the logarithmic approximation in the case of the trn metric . to analyze the general case , we will expand out eq .",

    "we can evaluate the performance of the approximation in the limit of large tidal charge : @xmath121 this shows that for any amount of negative tidal charge , the approximation will be worse than in the schwarzschild case , but only marginally so .",
    "this is borne out by an actual comparison of results obtained by both methods .",
    "as @xmath40 gets larger , the validity of the approximation falls off quicker in the trn spacetime . as @xmath101 ,",

    "( [ eq : limit ] ) shows that the strong deflection limit is accurate for the trn metric and for the myers - perry metric . for any spherically symmetric metric , one test for this approximation scheme can be the examination of @xmath118 in that spacetime .",
    "in this paper , we have shown various properties of relativistic images and how the qualitative features of black hole lensing for a braneworld black hole depend on the size of the black hole .",
    "we have introduced a new parameterization of  tidal charge \" for the tidal rn metric and have thereby uncovered a richer phenomenology of braneworld black hole structure in the strong deflection limit .",

    "while the lensing properties of such a small black hole can not be calculated using the geometric optics approach employed in this paper , there is good reason to suspect that lensing behavior in the braneworld will be dramatically different than schwarzschild behavior .",
    "we have shown that relativistic images are greatly enhanced by the braneworld geometry , but it remains an open question whether there are observational consequences to the image enhancement .",
    "we also confirm that the analytical method serves as an accurate probe of relativistic images , within a reasonable margin of error . at this stage , when the observational possibilites for relativistic images are more about the observation of the images than cataloguing the exact positions and magnitudes , a qualitative description of relativistic images is enough to explore this topic further .",
    "an advantage of the analytical approximation is that it allows for the calculation of certain observables more easily then using the numerical method .",
    "for example , the sum of the magnitude of all relativistic images after the first ( which should appear unresolved ) is easily accomplished using the analyitical methodology .",

    "both the weak and strong deflection approximations fail and evaluating integrals numerically is required for accurate calculation of primary and secondary image properties .",
    "hence , both methodologies will be relevant for the calculation of potentially observable consequences of relativistic images .",
    "it has been less than 10 years since the possibility of observing relativistic images and other strong field images has been considered in @xcite , and these images represent a promising source for knowledge about gravity in its full strength .",
