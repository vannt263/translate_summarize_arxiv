    "with the ability to manipulate single atoms and photons in a cavity came a renewed interest in the models that describe their behaviour .",
    "the hamiltonian for matter and field interactions can be written in two equivalent forms  @xcite , viz . , the one associated to the multipolar expansion @xmath2 where the first term describes the atomic field , the second the dipole interaction with the electric field , and the third the radiation field itself ; and the one related to the radiation gauge @xmath3 where the long wavelength approximation is considered , and which contains a so - called _ diamagnetic term _",
    "quadratic in the electromagnetic vector potential @xmath4 .",
    "they are both related via the ( unitary ) gauge transformation  @xcite @xmath5\\ , , \\ ] ] i.e. , both hamiltonians give rise to the same physical predictions when treated correctly .",
    "when approximating to @xmath6-level systems , the multipole hamiltonian gives rise to the well known dicke model ( dm )  @xcite .",
    "this describes the interaction of a single mode quantized radiation field with a sample of @xmath0 two - level atoms , located inside an optical cavity , in the dipolar approximation ( i.e. , located within a distance smaller than the wavelength of the radiation ) , and has the form @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the field frequency , @xmath9 is the atomic energy separation , @xmath10 denote the one - mode creation and annihilation photon operators respectively , @xmath11 the atomic relative population operator , and @xmath12 the atomic transition operators .",
    "we have taken @xmath13 .",
    "the interaction hamiltonian ( third and fourth terms on the right hand side ) contains , respectively , the _ rotating _ and _ counter - rotating _",
    "terms , with coupling constant @xmath14 .",
    "note that we have divided the hamiltonian by the total number of particles @xmath0 , having in this way an intensive hamiltonian operator .",
    "this is convenient for the thermodynamic limit is found by just taking @xmath15 , though our interest is to study the behaviour at _ finite _ @xmath0 .",
    "the approximation to @xmath6-level systems of the radiation hamiltonian @xmath16 , however , yields a _ different _",
    "hamiltonian @xmath17 which contains the diamagnetic term and which is _ not _ gauge - equivalent to @xmath18 .",
    "this is summarised in the following non - commutative diagram @xmath19^{2-level\\ approx } \\ar[d]_-u & h_d \\ar@{-->}[d]^{\\exists \\!\\!\\!/ } \\\\",
    "\\ar[r]_{2-level\\ approx } & h_{r\\,2\\ell }   } \\ ] ] where the downward dashed arrow signifies that no gauge transformation exists between the two .",
    "we stress here the distinction between @xmath18 and @xmath17 because there has been confusion in the literature . an important feature of the dicke hamiltonian @xmath18 is the presence of a phase transition from the normal to a _ super - radiant _ behaviour  @xcite .",
    "this is a collective effect involving all @xmath0 atoms in the sample , where the decay rate is proportional to @xmath20 instead of @xmath0 , the expected result for independent atom emission .",
    "this phenomenon was observed experimentally in optically pumped hf gas  @xcite .",
    "however , the transition from the normal to the super - radiant regime has been much debated in the literature , mainly because when using @xmath17 the thomas - reiche - kuhn sum rule would place contradictory bounds to the parameters of the model ( cf .",
    "e.g.  @xcite ) , and because it was believed that gauge invariance _ requires _ the presence of the diamagnetic term  @xcite .",
    "( the essence behind these arguments lies in the fact that the coupling strength @xmath14 is much smaller than the atomic level separation @xmath21 , for optical systems . ) at variance with this common belief , it has more recently been argued that the dicke model does give a consistent description of the interaction of a one - mode light field with the internal excitation of atoms inside a cavity  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , recent experimental results indicate that it can actually be observed  @xcite by using raman transitions between ground states in an atomic ensemble , thus circumventing the obstacle @xmath22 .",
    "in general , if we write @xmath23 , with @xmath24 $ ] the evolution operator for @xmath25 , then , since @xmath26 $ ] and @xmath27 $ ] , we have @xmath28    when @xmath8 and @xmath21 are close to one another ( as when in or close to resonance ) , and of the order of optical frequencies ( @xmath29 ) , the terms of the form @xmath30 vary rapidly in a time - scale of @xmath31 with an average close to zero , and may be neglected .",
    "this is the well - studied tavis - cummings  @xcite model ( tcm ) ( cf .",
    "e.g. @xcite ) , and the approximation is called the _ rotating wave _ approximation .",
    "figure  [ evol ] shows this very clearly  @xcite , where the time evolution of the excited state @xmath32 of one atom has been plotted for @xmath33 ( left ) , and @xmath34 ( right ) , with @xmath35 the rabi frequency of the atom ; here , the time scale has been taken in units of @xmath36 .",
    "as @xmath21 increases , the evolution approaches the harmonic oscillations that can be obtained analytically in this approximation .",
    "[ evol ]    the tcm model has more recently been generalised  @xcite , and considered to describe cavity qed with bose - einstein condensates  @xcite .",
    "the simplest case @xmath37 in the rotating - wave approximation is known as the jaynes - cummings model ( jcm )  @xcite .",
    "many theoretical predictions of this latter model , such as the existence of collapse and revivals in the rabi oscillations  @xcite , the formation of macroscopic quantum states , or measures of entanglement associated with spin - squeezed states , have been confirmed , and many experimental studies of rydberg atoms with very large principal quantum number within single - mode cavities have been realised  @xcite .",
    "together , the jcm and the tcm have served as a guide to understand several quantum optics phenomena .    in this work",
    "we will consider the full dicke model , with rotating and counter - rotating terms , and for simplicity we define @xmath38 .",
    "we shall also measure frequencies in units of the field frequency , i.e. @xmath39 , so that @xmath40 and @xmath41 are all adimensional .",
    "the coupling parameter @xmath42 is given , in terms of physical quantities of the system , as @xmath43 , where @xmath44 denotes the density of atoms in the volume of quantisation , @xmath45 is the excitation matrix element of the electric dipole operator of a single atom , and @xmath46 the polarisation vector .",
    "we will show how to calculate the phase transition of the dicke model for a _",
    "number @xmath0 of atoms , via @xmath1 different methods : i ) numerical diagonalisation of the hamiltonian and the use of the fidelity between neighbouring states ; ii ) variational test states that are a direct product of coherent heisenberg - weyl ( @xmath47)-states ( for the electromagnetic field ) , and @xmath48-states ( for the atomic field )  @xcite ; and iii ) the use of projection operators on the coherent states in ( ii ) to obtain states which obey the parity symmetry in the total excitation number , present in the hamiltonian .",
    "it will be seen that the _ symmetry - adapted _ states ( iii ) constitute a much better approximation ( than the simple coherent states ) to the exact quantum ground and first - excited states , apart from offering the localisation of a _ precursor _ of the quantum phase transition for _ finite _ @xmath0 ( usually referred to in the literature as a quantum phase transition in a finite system  @xcite ) .",
    "it is rather surprising that the three different approaches mentioned above lead to universal parametric curves for the expectation values of both the first quadrature of the electromagnetic field , and the atomic relative population , as functions of the atom - field coupling parameter .",
    "these are valid for the ground- and first - excited states , and are also presented .    finally , using these procedures , the critical value of the atom - field coupling parameter @xmath49 may be found as a function of the number of atoms @xmath0 , from which its critical exponent may be derived .",
    "the systems described by eq.([hamiltonian ] ) are non - integrable and must be solved via numerical diagonalisation for specific scenarios , but good semiclassical approximations that mimic well the exact quantum behaviour have been constructed  @xcite .",
    "one of these is to take as a test state a direct product of coherent @xmath47-states @xmath50 ( for the electromagnetic field ) , and @xmath48-states @xmath51 ( for the atomic field ) : @xmath52 here @xmath53 represents the eigenvalues of the photon number operator @xmath54 , @xmath55 those of the atomic relative population operator @xmath11 , and @xmath56 those of the squared total angular momentum operator @xmath57 .",
    "we can calculate the expectation values of the field and matter observables by using the representation of the angular momentum and weyl generators with respect to the tensorial product @xmath58  @xcite .",
    "acting with the operator @xmath59 on an arbitrary state @xmath60 and projecting it onto the @xmath48 coherent state @xmath51 , we obtain @xmath61 where we have used @xmath62 , and written @xmath63 for the unnormalised state .",
    "the second term in parenthesis may be calculated as the operator @xmath64\\ ] ] so that , substituting above , we get @xmath65 i.e. , the representation for @xmath59 in the basis of coherent states is @xmath66 similarly , for the other operators we have @xmath67    the _ energy surface _ is then easily found by taking the expectation value of the dicke hamiltonian with respect to @xmath58 , and the best variational approximation to the ground state energy of the system , as well as its corresponding eigenstate , are obtained from it . in our case the energy surface has the form @xmath68 where we have defined @xmath69 and where @xmath70 correspond to the expectation values of the radiation field quadratures , and @xmath71 determines a point on the bloch sphere .",
    "critical points which minimise the energy surface are obtained via the catastrophe formalism  @xcite @xmath72 where @xmath73 .",
    "this defines the _ separatrix _ of the phase transition , as shown in fig .",
    "[ separatrix ] .",
    "note that , for the cs used , it is independent of @xmath74 .",
    "[ separatrix ]    figure  [ qgammatheta_cs ] ( left ) shows the critical value for the ( normalised ) field quadrature @xmath75 as a function of the interaction strength @xmath42 .",
    "the presence of a phase transition from the normal ( where this quantity vanishes ) to the super - radiant phase is evident . from the expressions for the critical points we obtain , in the super - radiant region , @xmath76 figure  [ qgammatheta_cs ] ( right ) shows this relationship ; the normal regime is described only by the origin @xmath77 .",
    "the rest of the curve belongs to the super - radiant regime . note that this curve is valid for _ all _ @xmath78 ( as this parameter drops out from the equation above ) .",
    "it is also valid for _ any _ number @xmath0 of atoms .",
    "we shall see in what follows that this curve is universal .",
    "a natural variable to define is @xmath79 , and the energy at the minima take the values @xmath80 one may study the statistical properties of the variational states by calculating the expectation values of linear matter and field observables with respect to the cs , at the minima , as well as their fluctuations  @xcite .",
    "for instance , for the eigenvalues",
    "@xmath81 of the excitation number operator @xmath82 , we have @xmath83                  \\label{lambda}\\ ] ] the fluctuations @xmath84 are zero in the normal region , and in the super - radiant phase take the form @xmath85    a complete table for the expectation values and fluctuations of the most important matter and field observables is given in @xcite .",
    "many of these resemble very well the results that one would obtain by solving numerically the hamiltonian eigenvalue equation for the ground and first - excited states ( more on this later ) .",
    "the real beauty of it all is that analytic expressions can be obtained for all these values . but some of them , however , fail to approximate the exact quantum results .",
    "notably , the fluctuations of the quadrature operator @xmath86 and of the atomic transition operator @xmath87 , obtained from the cs , show an erroneous behaviour . the reason can be traced down to the fact that , while the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) shows a parity symmetry given by @xmath88 = 0          \\label{symmetry}\\ ] ] the coherent states mix states with opposite symmetry .",
    "considering the unitary transformations @xmath89 , and using the relations @xmath90 , @xmath91 , we find @xmath92 so we have a _ symmetry transformation _ for @xmath93 . i.e. , @xmath94 is invariant under the group @xmath95 .",
    "this symmetry allows for the classification of the hamiltonian eigenstates in terms of the parity of the eigenvalues @xmath96 of @xmath97 , whereas states with opposite symmetry are strongly mixed by the variational cs states considered in the last section .",
    "we may , however , obtain _ symmetry - adapted states _ ( sas )  @xcite by projecting with @xmath98 , i.e. , @xmath99\\      \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath100 the normalisation factors for the _ even _ @xmath101 and _ odd _ @xmath102 states .",
    "the _ surface energy _ takes a more complicated form @xmath103 and the critical points which minimise it can be obtained , this time numerically , following the same method as for the coherent states ( cs ) . in this case @xmath104 and @xmath105 and @xmath106 now depend strongly on @xmath0 . [ note : one could still obtain analytic expressions if , as usually done in many - body physics , one were to use the critical points for the cs energy surface , in order to obtain the trial state which approximates the two lowest symmetry - adapted energy states , and in which to evaluate the expectation values of the observables . around the phase transition",
    "there would be observable differences , however , and one should calculate the critical points of ( [ symad ] ) as we do here . for the first approach see  @xcite ] .",
    "figure  [ q_vs_gamma_sas ] ( left ) shows the behaviour of @xmath105 vs. @xmath42 for the ground ( even , blue , discontinuous upper curve ) and first - excited ( odd , red , continuous lower curve ) states .",
    "the discontinuity in the phase space variable for the even state marks the phase transition  @xcite .",
    "this discontinuity arises from a competition for the global minimum in the even energy surface between two local minima , as @xmath42 crosses the phase transition region , which can be seen in fig .",
    "[ discontinuity ]  @xcite . in the case of the odd states , an inflection point marks the transition from one regime to the other .",
    "if we compare the minimum points @xmath105 associated to the energy surfaces of the cs and the even sas , the discontinuity mentioned above translates into a forbidden range of values for @xmath106 ( @xmath107 ) when @xmath105 is plotted against it in fig .",
    "[ q_vs_gamma_sas ] ( right ) .",
    "but it is interesting to note that , in the allowed @xmath108-region , both fall along the same curve .",
    "the odd sas state is also plotted , falls along the same curve , has no forbidden regions , and is indistinguishable from that of the coherent state .",
    "finally , it must be mentioned that the sas states have been successfully used to study phase transitions through the rnyi - wehrl entropy  @xcite .",
    "in order to study exact quantum solutions we propose the correspondence @xmath109 , @xmath110 , where @xmath111 corresponds to @xmath112 . as the system is not integrable , we solve numerically the hamiltonian eigenvalue equation for the ground and first - excited states , separating the even- and odd - parity cases .",
    "the quantum phase transition may be found through the fidelity between neighbouring states  @xcite  @xcite @xmath113 which at the transition acquires its minimum value . an associated , more precise method , is to use the _ fidelity susceptibility _ ( the second derivative of the fidelity function given above ) which is maximum at the phase transition region  @xcite .",
    "the dependence with @xmath42 of the quadrature ( or expectation value of the number operator ) is shown in figure  [ exact_sas_cs_univ ] ( left ) , for @xmath114 ( bottom continuous gray dotted line ) and @xmath115 ( top continuous black dotted line ) .",
    "these are compared with those for the sas state at the same values of @xmath0 ( discontinuous dotted lines ) and with the result for the cs ( top continuous line ) .",
    "note that the quantum and sas solutions agree at @xmath116 , and approximate very well beyond the phase transition , while the cs fails to reproduce results well enough in the normal region .",
    "recall that the sas curves are discontinuous at the phase transition due to a competition for the global minimum in the even energy surface between two local minima , as explained in the last section .",
    "after the discontinuity , the curves for any value of @xmath0 become indistinguishable with the cs curve , as the figure shows . as @xmath0 increases , @xmath117 and",
    "the jump in the sas curves becomes smaller ; these curves approach more and more their quantum counterparts .",
    "also , for greater values of @xmath42 all curves tend to one and the same curve .",
    "one can also plot @xmath105 vs. @xmath106 ( or @xmath118 vs. @xmath119 ) for the quantum state ( fig .",
    "[ exact_sas_cs_univ ] ( right ) ) falling indistiguishably on the same universal curve together with the cs and sas even and odd states .",
    "a function @xmath120 is called _ homogeneous _ if , for all values of @xmath81 , we have @xmath121 .",
    "the function @xmath122 is called the _ scaling function _ and must be of the form @xmath123 ; @xmath124 is called the _ critical exponent_. the scaling hypothesis states that the singular part of many potentials are homogeneous functions near second - order phase transitions ; this is true , for instance , for all thermodynamic potentials  @xcite .",
    "critical exponents thus serve to describe the behaviour of important observables of a system near phase transitions and , although in most cases their properties are only supported by experimental data , they are believed to be universal with respect to physical systems .    our treatment for _ finite _ @xmath6-level systems in a cavity , in the presence of a radiation field , allows us to study the critical value of the atom - field coupling parameter @xmath49 as a function of the number of atoms @xmath0 , from which its critical exponent may be derived .",
    "figure  [ gamma_vs_j ] shows this relationship for the exact , quantum ground ( left ) and first - excited ( right ) states .",
