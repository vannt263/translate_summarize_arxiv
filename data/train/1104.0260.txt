    "<S> we introduce the idea of actually cooling quantum systems by means of incoherent thermal light , hence giving rise to a counter - intuitive mechanism of `` cooling by heating '' . in this effect </S>",
    "<S> , the mere incoherent occupation of a quantum mechanical mode serves as a trigger to enhance the coupling between other modes . </S>",
    "<S> this notion of effectively rendering states more coherent by driving with incoherent thermal quantum noise is applied here to the opto - mechanical setting , where this effect occurs most naturally . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss two ways of describing this situation , one of them making use of stochastic sampling of gaussian quantum states with respect to stationary classical stochastic processes . </S>",
    "<S> the potential of experimentally demonstrating this counter - intuitive effect in opto - mechanical systems with present technology is sketched .    </S>",
    "<S> cooling in quantum physics is usually achieved in just the same way as it occurs in classical physics or in common everyday situations : one brings a given system into contact with a colder bath . </S>",
    "<S> coherent driving of quantum systems can effectively achieve the same aim , most prominently in instances of laser cooling of ions or in its opto - mechanical variant , cooling mechanical degrees of freedom using the radiation pressure of light . </S>",
    "<S> the coherence then serves a purpose of , in a way , rendering the state of the system `` more quantum '' . in any case , in these situations , the interacting body should first and foremost be cold or coherent . in this work , we introduce a paradigm in which thermal hot states of light can be used to significantly cool down a quantum system . to be specific , we will focus on an opto - mechanical @xcite implementation of this idea : this type of system seems to be an ideal candidate to demonstrate this effect with present technology ; it should however be clear that several other natural instances can well be conceived . intuitively speaking </S>",
    "<S> , it is demonstrated that due to the driving with thermal noise , the interaction of other modes can be effectively enhanced , giving rise to a `` transistor - like '' effect @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we flesh out this effect at hand of two approaches following different approximation schemes . </S>",
    "<S> the first approach is essentially a weak coupling master equation , while the second approach makes use of stochastic samplings with respect to colored classical stochastic processes @xcite , which constitutes an interesting and practical tool to study such quantum optical systems of several modes in its own right .    </S>",
    "<S> the observation made here adds to the insight that appears to be appreciated only fairly recently , in that quantum noise does not necessarily only give rise to heating , decoherence , and dissipation , providing in particular a challenge in applications in quantum metrology and in quantum information science . </S>",
    "<S> when suitably used , quantum noise can also assist in processes thought to be necessarily of coherent nature , in noise - driven quantum phase transitions @xcite , quantum criticality @xcite , in entanglement distillation @xcite or in quantum computation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it turns out that thermal noise , when appropriately used , can also assist in cooling . </S>",
    "<S> alas , this counterintuitive effect is not in contradiction to the laws of thermodynamics , as is plausible when viewing this set - up as a thermal machine or heat engine @xcite operating in the quantum regime .        _ </S>",
    "<S> the system under consideration . </S>",
    "<S> _ we consider a system of two optical modes at frequencies @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively , that are coupled to a mechanical degree of freedom at frequency @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the hamiltonian of the entire system is assumed to be well - approximated by @xmath3 , where the free part is given by @xmath4 , and the interaction can be cast into the form @xmath5 it is convenient to move to a rotating interaction picture with respect to @xmath6 . the radiation pressure interaction is invariant under this transformation , while @xmath7 simplifies to @xmath8 where @xmath9 . for most of what follows , the frequencies are chosen such that @xmath10 , </S>",
    "<S> as we will see is the optimal resonance for cooling the mechanical resonator . </S>",
    "<S> this can be realized by tuning the mechanical degree of freedom or the cavity mode splitting . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , this is exactly the setting proposed in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite as a feasible three - mode optoacoustic interaction , in an idea that can be traced back to studies of parametric oscillatory instability in fabry - perot interferometers @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , with systems of high - finesse optical cavities coupled to thin semi - transparent membranes @xcite , of double - microdisk whispering - gallery resonators @xcite or of opto - mechanical crystals @xcite such a situation can be achieved . </S>",
    "<S> surely numerous other architectures are well conceivable .    </S>",
    "<S> in addition to this coherent dynamics , the system is assumed to undergo natural damping and decoherence  unavoidable in the opto - mechanical context . </S>",
    "<S> the quantum master equation governing the dynamics of the entire system embodying the two optical modes and the mechanical degree of freedom is given by @xmath11 + ( \\mathcal l_a+\\mathcal l_b+\\mathcal l_c)\\rho ,   \\label{master}\\ ] ] with the generators being defined by @xmath12 and @xmath13 making use of the notation for a generator in lindblad form @xmath14 here , we allow the optical bath of mode @xmath15 to be in a gibbs or thermal state having an arbitrary temperature .    </S>",
    "<S> this type of damping reflects the plausible mechanism of loss . </S>",
    "<S> for the mechanical motion , we are primarily interested in the regime where @xmath16 , such that the damping mechanism of quantum brownian motion based on some spectral density is virtually indistinguishable from the quantum optical markovian damping as for an optical mode @xcite . for that reason , for coherence of presentation , the same type of dissipative dynamics has been chosen for the optical and mechanical modes .    </S>",

    "<S> the second one involves sampling over colored classical stochastic processes . these methods </S>",

    "<S> , the coherence or purity of the state of @xmath15 does not play a dominant role , and hence even thermal noise can give rise to cooling . </S>",
    "<S> this is referred to as `` good noise '' . </S>",
    "<S> the second term corresponds to the fluctuations of the radiation pressure of mode @xmath15 and it is a source of  bad \" noise which heats the mechanical mode .    similarly , this effect can be studied at hand of the stochastic picture of description 2 , when observing eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ dv ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the intrinsic quantum noise described by @xmath81 , stochastic fluctuations of @xmath58 generate an additional heating noise given by the matrix @xmath82 . </S>",

    "<S> one quite impressively encounters the effect of cooling by heating , for increasing photon number and hence effective temperature of this optical mode . </S>",
    "<S> for very large values of the photon number , the `` bad noise '' eventually becomes dominant , resulting again in a heating up of the mechanical mode . </S>",
    "<S> note that needless to say , the effective temperature of the optical mode @xmath15 is usually larger than the mechanical one by many orders of magnitude ( approximately @xmath87k for reasonable parameters ) .    </S>",

    "<S> _ in this work , we have established the notion of cooling by heating , which means that cooling processes can be assisted by means of incoherent hot thermal light . </S>",
    "<S> we focused on an opto - mechanical implementation of this paradigm . </S>",
    "<S> we also introduced new theoretical tools to grasp the situation of driving by quantum noise , including sampling techniques over stochastic processes . to experimentally demonstrate this counterintuitive effect should be exciting in its own right . </S>",
    "<S> putting things upside down , one could also conceive settings similar to the one discussed here as demonstrators of small heat engines @xcite operating at the quantum mechanical level , where @xmath15 takes the role of an `` engine '' and mode @xmath18 of a `` condenser '' . to fully explore these implications for feasibly realizing quantum thermal machines </S>",
    "<S> constitutes an exciting perspective . </S>",
    "<S> it would also be interesting to fully flesh out the potential for the effect to assist in generating non - classical states @xcite . </S>",
