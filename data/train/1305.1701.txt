    "the nanodiamond has build - in nitrogen - vacancy ( nv ) centers , and electron spins associated with diamond nv centers make good qubits for quantum information processing as they have nice coherence properties even at room temperature @xcite . with assistance of a strong magnetic field gradient from a nearby magnetic tip , strong coupling between the nvspin and the mechanical oscillation of the nanodiamond can be achieved . using this coupling ,",

    "although the ground state cooling is most effective in a strong trap , to generate large spatial separation of the wave packets it is better to first lower the trap frequency by tuning the laser intensity for the optical trap . while it is possible to lower the trap frequency through an adiabatic sweep to keep the phonon state unchanged , a more effective way is to use a non - adiabatic state - preserving sweep @xcite , which allows arbitrarily short sweeping time .",

    "this rate is small compared with the experimental time scale of @xmath134  ms .",

    "in addition , with the built - in electronic states of the nv  center , the internal temperature of the diamond can be reduced through laser cooling @xcite . as @xmath144",
    ", this allows further significant suppression of the decoherence rate .",
    "for the current discussion of @xmath95 nm particle in the @xmath67mhz trap , the gravity induced decoherence is estimated to be in the order of @xmath145 hz for the superposition of fock states @xcite , and @xmath146 hz for spatial superposition states with displacement @xmath147 nm @xcite , and can be neglected .",
    "our proposed scheme is more relevant for testing objective collapse models @xcite .",
