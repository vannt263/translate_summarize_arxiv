    "to meet the fast growing mobile data volume driven by applications such as smartphones and tablets , the traditional wireless network architecture based on a single layer of macro - cells has shifted to one composed of smaller cells such as pico / femto cells with more densely deployed access points ( aps ) . therefore , cloud radio access network ( c - ran ) @xcite has recently been proposed and drawn a great deal of attention . in a c - ran , the distributed aps , also termed remote radio heads ( rrhs ) , are connected to the baseband unit ( bbu ) pool through high bandwidth backhaul links , e.g. optical transport network @xcite , to enable centralized processing , collaborative transmission , and real - time cloud computing . as a result , significant rate improvement can be achieved due to reduced pathloss along with joint scheduling and signal processing .",
    "however , with densely deployed aps , several new challenges arise in c - ran .",
    "first , close proximity of many active aps results in increased interference , and hence the transmit power of aps and/or mobile users ( mus ) needs to be increased to meet any given quality of service ( qos ) .",
    "second , the amount of energy consumed by a large number of active aps @xcite as well as by the transport network to support high - capacity connections with the bbu pool @xcite will also become considerable .",
    "such facts motivate us to optimize the energy consumption in c - ran , which is the primary concern of this paper . in particular , both downlink ( dl ) and uplink ( ul ) transmissions are considered jointly .",
    "the studied c - ran model consists of densely deployed aps jointly serving a set of distributed mus , where comp based joint transmit / receive processing ( beamforming ) over all active aps is employed for dl / ul transmissions . under this setup ,",
    "we study a joint dl and ul mu - ap association and beamforming design problem to minimize the total energy consumption in the network subject to mus given dl and ul qos requirements .",
    "the energy saving is achieved by optimally assigning mus to be served by the minimal subset of active aps , finding the power levels to transmit at all mus and aps , and finding the beamforming vectors to use at the multi - antenna aps .",
    "this problem has not been investigated to date , and the closest prior studies are @xcite . however , the prior studies have all considered mu association and/or active ap selection problems for various objectives from the dl perspective .",
    "in particular , the problems studied in @xcite can be treated as the dl - only version of our considered joint dl and ul problem , in which the transmit beamforming vectors and the active set of aps are jointly optimized to minimize the power consumption at all the aps .",
    "note that the mu association and/or active ap selection based on dl only may result in inefficient transmit power of mus or even their infeasible transmit power in the ul considering various possible asymmetries between the dl and ul in terms of channel , traffic and hardware limitation .",
    "furthermore , with users increasingly using applications with high - bandwidth ul requirements , ul transmission is becoming more important .",
    "for example , the upload speed required for full high definition ( hd ) @xmath0p skype video calling is about @xmath1 mbps @xcite .",
    "therefore , we need to account for both dl and ul transmissions while designing the mus association and active ap selection scheme . the ul - only mu association problem has also been considered extensively in the literature @xcite ; however , their solutions are not applicable in the context of this work due to their assumption of one - to - one mu - ap association .",
    "it is worth noting that the joint mus association and active ap selection is mathematically analogous to the problem of antenna selection in large multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) systems @xcite , which aims to reduce the number of radio transmission chains and hence the energy consumption and signal processing overhead .",
    "the connection between these two problems can be recognized by treating the c - ran as a distributed large mimo system .    in terms of other related work , there have been many attempts to optimize the energy consumption in cellular networks , but only over a single dimension each time , e.g. power control @xcite , ap `` on / off '' control @xcite , and coordinated multi - point ( comp ) transmission @xcite . to avoid an infeasible power allocation ,",
    "it was suggested in @xcite to gradually remove the mus that can not be supported due to their limited transmit power budgets .",
    "in addition to achieving energy saving from mus perspective , @xcite proposed to switch off the aps that are under light load to save energy by exploiting the fact that the traffic load in cellular networks fluctuates substantially over both space and time due to user mobility and traffic burstiness .",
    "cooperation among different cells or aps could be another possible way to mitigate the interference and achieve energy - efficient communication .",
    "for example , if a certain cluster of aps can jointly support all the mus , the intercell interference can be further reduced especially for the cell - edge mus @xcite .",
    "a judicious combination of these techniques should provide the best solution , and this is the direction of our work .",
    "unfortunately , the considered joint dl and ul mu - ap association and beamforming design problem in this paper involves integer programming and is np hard as shown for a similar problem in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 1 ) . to tackle this difficulty , two different approaches , i.e.",
    ", group - sparse optimization ( gso ) and relaxed - integer programming ( rip ) , have been adopted in @xcite and @xcite , respectively , to solve a similar dl - only problem , where two polynomial - time algorithms were proposed and shown to achieve good performance through simulations . in particular , the gso approach is motivated by the fact that in the c - ran with densely deployed aps , only a small fraction of the total number of aps needs to be active for meeting all mus qos . however , due to the new consideration of ul transmission in this paper , we will show that the algorithms proposed in @xcite can not be applied directly to solve our problem , and therefore the methods derived in this paper are important advances in this field .",
    "the contributions of this paper are summarized as follows :    1 .   to optimize the energy consumption tradeoffs between the active aps and mus , we jointly study the dl and ul mu - ap association and beamforming design by solving a weighted sum - power minimization problem . to our best knowledge",
    ", this paper is the first attempt to unify the dl and ul mu - ap association and beamforming design into one general framework .",
    "2 .   due to a critical scaling issue in the ul",
    "receive beamforming design , the gso based algorithm @xcite and the rip based algorithm @xcite can not be applied to solve our joint dl and ul design directly . to address this issue",
    ", we establish a virtual dl transmission for the original ul transmission in c - ran by first ignoring the individual ( per - ap and per - mu ) power constraints based on the celebrated ul - dl duality result @xcite .",
    "consequently , the considered joint dl and ul problem without individual power constraints can be transformed into an equivalent dl problem with two inter - related subproblems corresponding to the original and virtual dl transmissions , respectively . with the equivalent dl - only formulation ,",
    "we extend the gso based and rip based algorithms to solve the relaxed joint dl and ul optimization problem .",
    "3 .   considering the fact that the optimal solution to the ul sum - power minimization is component - wise minimum , there is no tradeoff among different mus in terms of power minimization in the ul .",
    "consequently , we are not able to establish the duality result for the per - mu power constraints in the ul , which are thus difficult to incorporate into our developed algorithm . to resolve this issue , we propose a price based iterative method to further optimize the set of active aps while satisfying the per - mu power constraints .",
    "finally , we verify the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms by extensive simulations from three perspectives : ensuring feasibility for both dl and ul transmissions ; achieving optimal network energy saving with mu - ap association ; and flexibly adjusting various power consumption tradeoffs between active aps and mus .",
    "it is worth pointing out that as the baseband processing is migrated to a central unit , i.e. , bbu pool , the data exchanged between the aps and the bbu pool includes oversampled real - time digital signals with very high bit rates ( in the order of gbps ) . as a result ,",
    "the capacity requirement for the backhaul / fronthaul links becomes far more stringent in the c - ran .",
    "given finite backhaul capacity , the optimal strategy for backhaul compression and quantization has been studied recently in e.g. @xcite . in this paper , however , we focus on addressing the energy consumption ( including both transmission and non - transmission related portions ) issue in the c - ran , which is also one of the major concerns for future cellular networks , by assuming that the backhaul transport network is provisioned with sufficiently large capacity .",
    "note that the optical network has been widely accepted as a good option to implement the high - bandwidth backhaul transport network @xcite .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec : system model ] introduces the c - ran model , and the power consumption models for the aps and mus .",
    "section [ sec : problem formulation ] presents our problem formulation , introduces the two existing approaches , namely gso and rip , and explain the new challenges in solving the joint dl and ul optimization .",
    "section [ sec : joint ul dl ] presents our proposed algorithms based on the virtual dl representation of the ul transmission .",
    "section [ sec : numerical ] shows numerical results .",
    "finally , section [ sec : conclusion ] concludes the paper .",

    "the distribution of a circularly symmetric complex gaussian ( cscg ) random vector with mean vector @xmath6 and covariance matrix @xmath7 is denoted by @xmath8 ; and @xmath9 stands for `` distributed as '' .",

    "the set of distributed aps jointly support @xmath17 randomly located mobile users ( mus ) , denoted by the set @xmath18 , for both downlink ( dl ) and uplink ( ul ) communications . in this paper , for the purpose of exposition , we consider linear precoding and decoding in the dl and ul , respectively , which is jointly designed at the bbu pool assuming the perfect channel knowledge for all mus .",
    "the results in this paper can be readily extended to the case of more complex successive precoding / decoding , e.g. dirty - paper coding ( dpc ) @xcite and multiuser detection with successive interference cancelation ( sic ) @xcite , with fixed coding orders among the users .",
    "we also assume that each ap @xmath19 , @xmath20 , is equipped with @xmath21 antennas , and all mus are each equipped with one antenna .",
    "it is further assumed that there exist ideal low - latency backhaul transport links with sufficiently large capacity ( e.g. optical fiber ) connecting the set of aps to the bbu pool , which performs all the baseband signal processing and transmission scheduling for all aps .",
    "the centralized architecture results in efficient coordination of the transmission / reception among all the aps , which can also be opportunistically utilized depending on the traffic demand .",
    "we consider a quasi - static fading environment , and denote the channel vector in the dl from ap @xmath19 to mu @xmath22 and that in the ul from mu @xmath22 to ap @xmath19 as @xmath23 and @xmath24 , respectively .",

    "there are two main techniques for separating dl and ul transmissions on the same physical transmission medium , i.e. , time - division duplex ( tdd ) and frequency - division duplex ( fdd ) .",
    "if tdd is assumed , channel reciprocity is generally assumed to hold between dl and ul transmissions , which means that the channel vector @xmath27 in the ul is merely the transpose of that @xmath28 in the dl , i.e. , @xmath29 . however , if fdd is assumed , @xmath30 s and @xmath27 s are different in general .      in dl transmission ,",
    "the transmitted signal from all aps can be generally expressed as @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the beamforming vector for all aps to cooperatively send one single stream of data signal @xmath33 to mu @xmath22 , which is assumed to be a complex random variable with zero mean and unit variance .",
    "note that @xmath34",
    ". then , the transmitted signal from ap @xmath19 can be expressed as @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the @xmath19th block component of @xmath37 , corresponding to the transmit beamforming vector at ap @xmath19 for mu @xmath22 .",

    "from ( [ eq : dl transmit signal from ap n ] ) , the transmit power of ap @xmath19 in dl is obtained as @xmath41 we assume that there exists a maximum transmit power constraint for each ap @xmath19 , i.e. , @xmath42    the received signal at the @xmath22th mu is then expressed as @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the receiver noise at mu @xmath22 , which is assumed to be a circularly symmetric complex gaussian ( cscg ) random variable with zero mean and variance @xmath45 , denoted by @xmath46 . treating the interference as noise ,",
    "the signal - to - interference - plus - noise ratio ( sinr ) in dl for mu @xmath22 is given by @xmath47      in ul transmission , the transmitted signal from mu @xmath22 is given by @xmath48 where @xmath49 denotes the transmit power of mu @xmath22 , and @xmath50 is the information bearing signal which is assumed to be a complex random variable with zero mean and unit variance . with @xmath51 denoting the transmit power limit for mt @xmath22 , it follows that @xmath52    the received signal at all aps is then expressed as @xmath53 where @xmath54 denotes the receiver noise vector at all aps consisting of independent cscg random variables each distributed as @xmath55 .",
    "let @xmath56 denote the receiver beamforming vector used to decode @xmath57 from mu @xmath22 .",
    "then the sinr in ul for mu @xmath22 after applying @xmath58 is given by @xmath59 let @xmath60 denote the @xmath19th block component in @xmath58 , corresponding to the receive beamforming vector at ap @xmath19 for mu @xmath22 .",
    "we thus have @xmath61^{t}$ ] , @xmath40 .      the total energy consumption in the c - ran comprises of the energy consumed by all aps and all mus .",
    "from ( [ eq : dl transmit signal from all aps ] ) and ( [ eq : ul transmit signal from mu i ] ) , the total transmit power of all aps in dl and that of all mus in ul can be expressed as @xmath62 and @xmath63 , respectively .    besides the static power consumption at each ap @xmath19 due to e.g. real - time a / d and d / a processing , denoted as @xmath64 , in c - ran with centralized processing",
    ", the extensive use of high - capacity backhaul links to connect all aps with the bbu pool makes the power consumption of the transport network no more negligible @xcite .",
    "for example , consider the passive optical network ( pon ) to implement the backhaul transport network @xcite .",
    "the pon assigns an optical line terminal ( olt ) to connect to a set of associated optical network units ( onus ) , which coordinate the set of transport links connecting all the aps to the bbu pool , each through a single fiber . for simplicity",
    ", the resulting power consumption in the pon can be modeled as @xcite @xmath65 where @xmath66 and @xmath67 are both constant and denote the power consumed by the olt and the transport link associated with ap @xmath19 , respectively .",
    "moreover , we consider that for energy saving , some aps and their associated transport links can be switched into sleep mode @xcite ( compared with active mode ) with negligible power consumption ; thus , the total static power consumption of ap @xmath19 , denoted by @xmath68 , @xmath20 , can be saved if ap @xmath19 and its associated transport link are switched into sleep mode for both transmission in dl and ul . for convenience ,",
    "we express the total static power consumption of all active aps as @xmath69 where @xmath70 , @xmath20 , is an indicator function for ap @xmath19 , which is defined as @xmath71 note that in practical pon systems , the olt in general can not be switched into sleep mode as it plays the role of distributor , arbitrator , and aggregator of the transport network , which has a typical fixed power consumption of @xmath72w @xcite .",
    "we thus ignore @xmath66 since it is only a constant . from ( [ eq : on off condition ] ) , mu @xmath22 is associated with an active ap @xmath19 if its corresponding transmit and/or receive beamforming vector at ap @xmath19 is nonzero , i.e. , @xmath73 and/or @xmath74 . under this setup",
    ", it is worth pointing out that each mu @xmath22 is allowed to connect with two different sets of aps for dl and ul transmissions , respectively , e.g. @xmath73 but @xmath75 for some @xmath20 , which is promising to be implemented in next generation cellular networks @xcite .",
    "furthermore , from ( [ eq : on off condition ] ) , ap @xmath19 could be switched into sleep mode only if it does not serve any mu .",
    "we aim to minimize the total energy consumption in the c - ran , including that due to transmit power of all mus ( but ignoring any static power consumption of mu terminals ) as well as that due to transmit power and static power of all active aps .",
    "therefore , we consider the following weighted sum - power as our design metric : @xmath76 where @xmath77 is a weight to trade off between the total energy consumptions between all the active aps and all mus .",
    "to minimize the weighted power consumption in ( [ eq : weighted sum power ] ) , we jointly optimize the dl and ul mu - ap association and transmit / receive beamforming by considering the following problem .",
    "@xmath78 where @xmath79 and @xmath80 are the given sinr requirements of mu @xmath22 for the dl and ul transmissions , respectively . in the rest of this paper , the constraints in ( [ eq : uldl dl power constraint ] ) and ( [ eq : uldl ul power constraint ] )",
    "are termed per - ap and per - mu power constraints , respectively .",
    "problem ( p1 ) can be shown to be non - convex due to the implicit integer programming involved due to indicator function @xmath70 s in the objective . prior to solving problem ( p1 ) , we first need to check its feasibility .",
    "since the dl and ul transmissions are coupled only by the objective function in ( [ eq : uldl objective function ] ) , the feasibility of problem ( p1 ) can be checked by considering two separate feasibility problems : one for the dl and the other for the ul , which have both been well studied in the literature @xcite and thus the details are omitted here for brevity . for the rest of this paper , we assume that problem ( p1 ) is always feasible if all aps are active .    as mentioned in section [ sec : introduction ] , the problem of joint mu - ap association and transmit beamforming subject to mus qos and per - ap power constraints for power minimization in the dl - only transmission has been recently studied in @xcite using the approaches of gso and rip , respectively , where two different polynomial - time algorithms were proposed and shown to both achieve good performance by simulations .",
    "in contrast , problem ( p1 ) in this paper considers both dl and ul transmissions to address possible asymmetries between the dl and ul in terms of channel realization , traffic load and hardware limitation .",
    "furthermore , considering that mus are usually powered by finite - capacity batteries as compared to aps that are in general powered by the electricity grid , we study the power consumption tradeoffs between aps and mus by minimizing the weighted sum - power @xmath81 in ( p1 ) . therefore",
    ", the problems considered in @xcite can be treated as special cases of ( p1 ) .    in the following ,",
    "we show that due to the new consideration of ul transmission , the algorithms proposed in @xcite based on gso and rip for solving the dl optimization can not be applied directly to solve ( p1 ) , which thus motivates us to find a new method to resolve this issue in section [ sec : joint ul dl ] .",
    "given the fact that the static power , i.e. , @xmath82 , is in practice significantly larger than the transmit power at each ap @xmath19 , to minimize the total network energy consumption @xcite , it is conceivable that for the optimal solution of ( p1 ) only a subset of @xmath15 aps should be active . as a result , a `` group - sparse '' property can be inferred from the following concatenated beamforming vector : @xmath83,\\cdots,[\\hat{\\mathbf{w}}^{\\text{dl}}_n,\\hat{\\mathbf{v}}^{\\text{ul}}_n]\\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in which @xmath84 $ ] and @xmath85 $ ] , @xmath86 , i.e. , the beamforming vectors are grouped according to their associated aps . if ap @xmath19 is in the sleep mode , its corresponding block @xmath87 $ ] in ( [ eq : group sparsity ] ) needs to be zero . consequently , the fact that a small subset of deployed aps is selected to be active implies that the concatenated beamforming vector in ( [ eq : group sparsity ] ) should contain only a very few non - zero block components .",
    "one well - known approach to enforce desired group sparsity in the obtained solutions for optimization problems is by adding to the objective function an appropriate penalty term .",
    "the widely used group sparsity enforcing penalty function , which was first introduced in the context of the group least - absolute selection and shrinkage operator ( lasso ) problem @xcite , is the mixed @xmath88 norm . in our case ,",
    "such a penalty is expressed as @xmath89\\right\\|.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the @xmath88 norm in ( [ eq : uldl penalty ] ) , similar to @xmath90 norm , offers the closest convex approximation to the @xmath91 norm over the vector consisting of @xmath92 norms @xmath93\\right\\|\\right\\}^{n}_{n=1}$ ] , implying that each @xmath94\\right\\|$ ] is desired to be set to zero to obtain group sparsity .    more generally , the mixed @xmath95 norm has also been shown to be able to recover group sparsity with @xmath96 @xcite , among which the @xmath97 norm , defined as @xmath98 has been widely used @xcite . compared with @xmath88 norm ,",
    "@xmath97 norm has the potential to obtain more sparse solution but may lead to undesired solution with components of equal magnitude . in this paper",
    ", we focus on the @xmath88 norm in ( [ eq : uldl penalty ] ) for our study",
    ". we will compare the performance of @xmath88 and @xmath97 norms by simulations in section [ sec : numerical ] .    according to @xcite , at first glance",
    "it seems that using the @xmath88 norm , problem ( p1 ) can be approximately solved by replacing the objective function with @xmath99 where @xmath100 can be treated as a convex relaxation of the indicator functions in ( [ eq : weighted sum power ] ) , and @xmath101 indicates the relative importance of the penalty term associated with ap @xmath19 .",
    "however , problem ( p1 ) with ( [ eq : scaling problem objective ] ) as the objective function is still non - convex due to the constraints in ( [ eq : uldl dl sinr constraint ] ) and ( [ eq : uldl ul sinr constraint ] ) .",
    "furthermore , since the ul receive beamforming vector @xmath58 s can be scaled down to be arbitrarily small without affecting the ul sinr defined in ( [ eq : ul sinr ] ) , minimizing ( [ eq : scaling problem objective ] ) directly will result in all @xmath58 s going to zero . to be more specific ,",
    "let @xmath102 and @xmath103 denote the optimal solution of problem ( p1 ) with ( [ eq : scaling problem objective ] ) as the objective function .",
    "then , it follows that @xmath104 and @xmath105 , preserves the `` group - sparse '' property where the non - zero block components correspond to the active aps .",
    "two issues thus arise : first , the ul does not contribute to the selection of active aps ; second , the set of selected active aps based on the dl only can not guarantee the qos requirements for the ul . as a result ,",
    "the @xmath88 norm penalty term in ( [ eq : scaling problem objective ] ) or more generally the @xmath95 norm penalty does not work for the joint dl and ul ap selection in our problem , and hence the algorithm proposed in @xcite , which involves only the dl transmit beamforming vector @xmath37 s , can not be modified in a straightforward way to solve our problem .",
    "next , we reformulate problem ( p1 ) by introducing a set of binary variable @xmath106 s indicating the `` active / sleep '' state of each ap as follows .",
    "@xmath107 where @xmath108 is a constant with arbitrary value .",
    "note that the active - sleep constraints in ( [ eq : bigm onoff ] ) are inspired by the well - known big-@xmath109 method @xcite : if @xmath110 , the constraint ( [ eq : bigm onoff ] ) ensures that @xmath111 ; if @xmath112 , the constraint has no effect on @xmath113 and @xmath114 , as @xmath115 represents an upper bound on the term @xmath116 .",
    "notice that @xmath117 can be chosen arbitrarily due to the scaling invariant property of ul receive beamforming vector @xmath58 s . with the active - sleep constraints in ( [ eq : bigm onoff ] )",
    ", the equivalence between problems ( p1 ) and ( p2 ) can be easily verified .    in @xcite , a similar problem to ( p2 )",
    "was studied corresponding to the case with only dl transmission . for problem ( p2 ) without @xmath58 and @xmath118 and their corresponding constraints , the problem can be transformed to a convex second - order cone programming ( socp ) by relaxing the binary variable @xmath106 as @xmath119 , \\forall n \\in \\mathcal{n}$ ] . under this convex relaxation ,",
    "a bnc algorithm , which is a combination of the branch - and - bound ( bnb ) and the cutting plane ( cp ) methods @xcite , was proposed in @xcite to solve the dl problem optimally . however , the computational complexity of bnb is prohibitive for large networks in practice , which grows exponentially with the number of aps . to obtain polynomial - time algorithm with near - optimal performance , in @xcite",
    ", the authors further proposed an incentive measure based heuristic algorithm to determine the set of active aps .",
    "the incentive measure reflects the importance of each ap to the whole network and is defined as the ratio of the total power received at all mus to the total power expended for each ap .",
    "however , with both dl and ul transmissions , it is observed that problem ( p2 ) can no longer be transformed to a convex form by relaxing @xmath106 s as continuous variables due to the constraints in ( [ eq : uldl ul sinr constraint ] ) .",
    "furthermore , because of the scaling invariant property of ul receive beamforming vectors , solving the relaxed problem of ( p2 ) will result in all @xmath58 s going to zero , similar to the case of gso based solution .",
    "particularly , the value of the relaxed indicator @xmath120 , will not be related to @xmath58 s , which in fact contributes to the penalty incurred in the objective due to the static power of ap @xmath19 , i.e. , @xmath121 .",
    "finally , it is nontrivial to find an incentive measure that reflects the importance of each ap to both dl and ul transmissions .",
    "in this section , we provide two efficient algorithms to approximately solve problem ( p1 ) based on the gso and rip approaches , respectively .",
    "first , we consider the approach of gso and present a new method to address the joint dl and ul optimization . to obtain an efficient solution for problem ( p1 ) , we first assume that all the aps and mus have infinite power budget , i.e. , @xmath122 , @xmath123 and @xmath124 . the resulting problem is termed ( p1 - 1 ) .",
    "an equivalent reformulation of problem ( p1 - 1 ) is then provided to overcome the receive beamforming scaling issue mentioned in section [ sec : problem formulation ] . then , we discuss the challenges of dealing with finite per - ap and per - mu power constraints and provide efficient methods to handle them .",
    "first , we consider the following transmit sum - power minimization problem in the ul :    @xmath125    from @xcite , it follows that problem ( [ eq : ul power minimization ] ) can be solved in a virtual dl channel as    @xmath126    where @xmath127 is the virtual dl transmit beamforming vector over @xmath15 aps for mu @xmath22 .",
    "denote @xmath128 , @xmath129 and @xmath130 , @xmath131 as the optimal solutions to problems ( [ eq : ul power minimization ] ) and ( [ eq : virtual dl power minimizatin ] ) , respectively .",
    "then from @xcite it follows that @xmath128 and @xmath130 can be set to be identical , @xmath132 , and furthermore @xmath133 .    by establishing a virtual dl transmission for the ul transmission based on the above ul - dl duality",
    ", we have the following lemma .    [ lemma:1 ] problem ( p1 - 1 ) is equivalent to the following problem .",
    "@xmath134    for any given feasible solution to problem ( p3 ) , we can always find a corresponding feasible solution to problem ( p1 - 1 ) achieving the same objective value as that of problem ( p3 ) , and vice versa , similar as ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 1 ) ; thus , problems ( p1 - 1 ) and ( p3 ) achieve the same optimal value with the same set of optimal dl / ul beamforming vectors .",
    "lemma [ lemma:1 ] is thus proved .    since problem ( p3 )",
    "is a dl - only problem that has the same `` group - sparse '' property as ( p1 - 1 ) , it can be approximately solved by replacing the objective function with @xmath135 comparing ( [ eq : reformulate problem objective ] ) and ( [ eq : scaling problem objective ] ) , we have successfully solved the scaling issue of ul receive beamforming vector , @xmath58 s , by replacing them with the equivalent dl transmit beamforming vector , @xmath136 s , since from ( [ eq : virtual dl power minimizatin ] ) it follows that the virtual dl sinr of each mu @xmath22 is no more scaling invariant to @xmath136 s .    furthermore , since any arbitrary phase rotation of the beamforming vectors does not affect both ( [ eq : reformulate problem objective ] ) and the sinr constrains in ( [ eq : dl sinr r ] ) and ( [ eq : vdl sinr r ] ) , ( p3 ) with ( [ eq : reformulate problem objective ] ) as the objective function can be reformulated as a convex socp @xcite , which is given by    @xmath137    where @xmath138 $ ] , @xmath139 $ ] , and @xmath140 s are auxiliary variables with @xmath141 and @xmath142 indicating that ap @xmath19 is in active and sleep mode , respectively",

    "consequently , most existing studies in the literature have transformed the dl problem to its virtual ul formulation for convenience .",
    "the motivation of exploiting the reverse direction in this work , however , is to overcome the scaling issue of ul receive beamforming in gso , so that we can solve the ap selection problem jointly for both dl and ul transmissions .",

    "the iterative update given in ( [ eq : iterative update ] ) is designed to make small entries in @xmath171 converge to zero .",
    "furthermore , as the updating evolves , the penalty associated with ap @xmath19 in the objective function , i.e. , @xmath172 , will converge to two possible values : @xmath173 in other words , only the active aps will incur penalties being the exact same values as their static power consumption , which has the same effect as the indicator function in problem ( p1 - 1 ) or ( p1 ) .",

    "the component - wise minimum power allocation indicates that it is not possible to further reduce one particular mu s power consumption by increasing others , i.e. , there is no tradeoff among different mus in terms of power minimization .",
    "consequently , solving problem ( [ eq : ul power minimization with per mu ] ) requires only one additional step compared with solving problem ( [ eq : ul power minimization ] ) , i.e. , checking whether the optimal power solution to problem ( [ eq : ul power minimization ] ) satisfies the per - mu power constraints . if this is the case , the solution is also optimal for problem ( [ eq : ul power minimization with per mu ] ) ; otherwise , problem ( [ eq : ul power minimization with per mu ] ) is infeasible .    next , we present our complete algorithm for problem ( p1 ) with the per - ap and per - mu power constraints .",
    "compared to the algorithm proposed for problem ( p1 - 1 ) in section [ sec : without ] without the per - ap and per - mu power constraints , the new algorithm differs in the first step , i.e. , to identify the subset of active aps .",
    "the main idea is that a set of candidate active aps is first obtained by ignoring the per - mu power constraints but with a new sum - power constraint in the ul ( or equivalently its virtual dl ) , i.e. , we iteratively solve the following problem similarly as in the first step of solving problem ( p1 - 1 ) in section [ sec : without ] .",

    "specifically , in each iteration , for those aps that are not in the candidate set each will be assigned a price @xmath182 , which is defined as @xmath183 where @xmath184 .",
    "the price @xmath185 is set to be the normalized ( by its corresponding static power consumption ) weighted - sum power gains of the channels from ap @xmath186 to all the mus that have their power constraints being violated .",
    "the weights are chosen as the ratios of mus required additional powers to their individual power limits . according to the definition of @xmath185 in ( [ eq : price ] ) ,",
    "the ap having smaller static power consumption and better channels to mus whose power constraints are more severely violated will be associated with a larger price .",
    "the candidate set is then updated by including the ap that corresponds the largest @xmath185 as @xmath187 with updated @xmath178 , the feasibility of the ul transmission needs to be re - checked by obtaining a new set of power allocation , which will be used to compute the new @xmath185 s in next iteration if further updating is required .",
    "the above process is repeated until all the mus power constraints are satisfied .",

    "<S> the cloud radio access network ( c - ran ) concept , in which densely deployed access points ( aps ) are empowered by cloud computing to cooperatively support mobile users ( mus ) , to improve mobile data rates , has been recently proposed . </S>",
    "<S> however , the high density of active aps results in severe interference and also inefficient energy consumption . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the growing popularity of highly interactive applications with stringent uplink ( ul ) requirements , e.g. network gaming and real - time broadcasting by wireless users , means that the ul transmission is becoming more crucial and requires special attention . therefore in this paper , </S>",
    "<S> we propose a joint downlink ( dl ) and ul mu - ap association and beamforming design to coordinate interference in the c - ran for energy minimization , a problem which is shown to be np hard . due to the new consideration of ul transmission </S>",
    "<S> , it is shown that the two state - of - the - art approaches for finding computationally efficient solutions of joint mu - ap association and beamforming considering only the dl , i.e. , group - sparse optimization and relaxed - integer programming , can not be modified in a straightforward way to solve our problem . leveraging on the celebrated ul - dl duality result </S>",
    "<S> , we show that by establishing a virtual dl transmission for the original ul transmission , the joint dl and ul optimization problem can be converted to an equivalent dl problem in c - ran with two inter - related subproblems for the original and virtual dl transmissions , respectively . based on this transformation , </S>",
    "<S> two efficient algorithms for joint dl and ul mu - ap association and beamforming design are proposed , whose performances are evaluated and compared with other benchmarking schemes through extensive simulations .    cloud radio access network , green communication , uplink - downlink duality , group - sparse optimization , relaxed - integer programming , beamforming .
