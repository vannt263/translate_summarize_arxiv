    "understanding the full infrared spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of galaxies is essential for a complete picture of star - formation in the universe",
    ". measurements of the cosmic background radiation allow us to infer that about half the energy ever generated by stars was reprocessed by dust into the infrared ( see * ? ? ?",

    "this emission is increasingly important at higher redshifts where the star - formation density of the universe is larger than today .",
    "modelling the contribution of different galaxy populations to the cosmic infrared background ( cib ) requires detailed knowledge of the seds of star - forming galaxies .",
    "the variation in sed shapes is a key uncertainty when comparing populations selected at different wavelengths or testing galaxy evolution models .",
    "+ in this paper , we discuss the full infrared sed ( @xmath111000@xmath0 m ) , which roughly spans the wavelengths between stellar and synchrotron - dominated emission . traditionally , studying this entire range at once has been difficult , since mid - ir ( @xmath1060@xmath0 m ) observations could not reach much beyond the local universem  observations which peak at @xmath9@xmath10.7 @xcite ] , while sub - mm observations also only exist for very local , ir - bright , galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or else the blank - sky sub - mm common user bolometer array ( scuba ) sources which peak at @xmath9@xmath123 @xcite .",
    "the latter typically have only one or two other wavelength detections in addition to the scuba ( 850@xmath0 m ) one , which makes their interpretation particularly dependent on the sed model assumed ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review ) . due to these past observational limitations , we still do not know ( beyond some generalized trends ) the full range of galaxy sed shapes , how exactly they are related to the underlying physical conditions in the galaxy , and therefore how they may vary across cosmic time as the galaxies evolve .",
    "+ with the advent of the _ spitzer _ space telescope @xcite we can for the first time observe the mid - ir properties of large numbers of sources over a cosmologically significant extent in redshift ( e.g.  lonsdale et al .",
    "_ spitzer _ covers the range 3160@xmath0 m .",
    "the obvious next step toward characterizing the full infrared seds of galaxies is therefore to link _ spitzer _ observations with longer wavelength samples , especially including sub - mm observations . in this regard ,",
    "the quality and quantity of the available sub - mm data are the limiting factor .",
    "+ the sample discussed here is selected from the 170@xmath0 m  firback ( far - ir background ) elais - n1 catalog @xcite .",
    "the selection is based on an existing radio detection , which we followed - up with both deep near - ir and sub - mm observations ( scott et al .",
    "2000 ; sajina et al .",
    "2003 , hereafter s03 ) .",
    "we find that in terms of the mid - ir properties , the sample selection is largely unbiased with respect to the firback population as a whole .",
    "our previous studies suggest that the sample consists primarily of @xmath9@xmath100.3 ordinary , spiral - like galaxies , rich in cold ( @xmath11@xmath1040k ) dust , with @xmath11/6 of the sample consisting of ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( uligs ) at @xmath9@xmath10.51 .",

    "we fit these seds with a phenomenological model motivated by different physical origins for the emission .",
    "these fits allow us to discuss the physical characteristics of our galaxies as well as trends within the sample .",

    "+ throughout the paper we assume a flat universe with @xmath12=75  km  s@xmath13  mpc@xmath13 , @xmath14=0.3 , and @xmath15=0.7 .",
    "the galaxies we focus on come from a sub - sample of firback sources with radio detections which were observed with scuba . the full sample of 30 targets was first presented in s03 where details of the sample selection as well as the near - ir ( _ k _ ) and sub - mm observations and data reduction are given . in particular , in s03 we addressed the question of whether or not the radio detection requirement introduces a bias and found that apart from potential hyligs ( @xmath4@xmath16@xmath17@xmath18 ) at @xmath9@xmath11.5 , and spurrious sources , the radio detection does not bias us with respect to the firback catalogue as a whole .",

    "the observed sed of a galaxy depends on the properties of the stellar populations ( e.g. ages and metallicities ) , the dust model ( e.g. composition , size distributions ) , and the relative geometry of the two .",
    "the full range of possible combinations of all these is such that , fully accounting for all possible processes is todate not possible .",
    "radiative transfer models where stars form inside giant molecular clouds and gradually disperse into the diffuse medium exist @xcite , but tend either to have too many free parameters , or not cover the full range in seds observed .",
    "self - consistent models of the stars and dust ( i.e. energy absorbed equals energy emitted ) have been done on local galaxies @xcite ; however , require exceptionally well sampled seds from the uv to the sub - millimeter .",
    "we choose a modelling approach ( see section  3.2 ) that is data - driven : i.e. our model is no more complicated than our data allow us to fit , yet is flexible enough to describe the full range of seds observed in the sample .",
    "such a simple phenomenological model has the effect of smoothing over the underlying messiness of galaxy seds , while providing us with best - fit parameters ( such as opacity and dust temperature ) those values are some characteristic or average values of an underlying distribution .",
    "the approach is therefore well suited to broadband data , such as presented for our sample in the previous section , which is , in essence , spatially integrated over the entire galaxy , including its quiescent ( i.e. cirrus ) and potentially active ( i.e. starburst ) environments .",
    "+ the main limitation in interpreting our results in terms of the physical nature of our galaxies is due to the fact that , as discussed in the previous section , the available optical / uv data ( _ u _ , _ g _ , and _",
    "r _ ) for our sample are quite scarce and thus here we only discuss the spectral properties of our galaxies longward of and including the near - ir ( @xmath12@xmath0 m ) , which automatically precludes us from _ directly _ discussing young stars .",
    "thus our restriction of fitting only the @xmath282@xmath0 m  spectra means that : 1 ) we can not balance the energy absorbed in the optical / uv with the energy re - emitted in the infrared , 2 ) we can not explicitly discuss either the star - formation history or age distribution of the stellar populations of our galaxies , and 3 ) we can not constrain multiple optical depths ( e.g. molecular cloud and cirrus ) .",
    "these limitations are largely addressed post - fitting , i.e. in the interpretation of the best - fit model parameters and how they are used to infer underlying physical characteristics .",
    "for example , we confine our stellar model to an old stellar population template ( see section  3.2 ) , but when deriving stellar mass , we use mass - to - light ratios which include the effect of young stars on the _ k_-band ( section  4.3 ) . we know that young stars form inside dense molecular clouds and later disperse into the diffuse disk environment . thus the characteristic optical depth absorbing",
    "the young stars power is likely not the optical depth we derive in the near - ir which is dominated by the older stellar populations .",
    "we address this in section  5.2 , where the dust masses are derived both from emission ( predominantly young stars ) and absorption ( predominantly old stars in our case ) .",
    "+ with the above philosophy in mind , we proceed with the model procedure outlined below .",
    "as discussed above , our modelling approach is driven by the desire to have a phenomenological model which fits known nearby galaxy seds robustly and yet has the flexibility ( i.e. number of phenomenological parameters only slightly less than the number of data points we are trying to fit ) which allows us to fit a wide range of sed types , and in addition we want to be able to extract physical parameters with meaningful uncertainties ( in particular such that degeneracies between parameters can be highlighted ) . with these goals clearly in mind , our choice of detailed sed model is dependent on the quality and wavelength coverage of the data , while the statistical approach we use is the markov chain monte carlo method .",
    "+ we model the sed as a sum of stellar emission , pah emission , power - law emission , and thermal grey - body emission .",
    "this is based on the mid - ir model used in sajina , lacy , and scott  ( 2005 ) .",
    "+ the stellar emission is accounted for by a 10gyr - old , solar metallicity , salpeter imf , single stellar population ( ssp ) spectral template generated with the pegase2.0 spectral synthesis code ( fioc et al .",
    "the specific stellar model used here is not important , being merely a stand - in for old stars. for any population older than about 1gyr , the near - ir spectrum looks essentially the same ( through a couple of broadband filters ) , the differences being in the shorter wavelengths . since our sources are largely @xmath9@xmath10 , with a tail extending up to @xmath9@xmath11 , this can be thought of as : all of our sources include _ some _ stars that are as old as the universe at the observed epoch .",
    "+ we use the neutral pah emission template of lee & draine ( 2003 ) .",
    "the only modification we make is the addition of the newly discovered 17@xmath0 m  feature ( smith et al .",
    "our broadband data do not allow us to investigate the probable variations in relative pah feature strength , and therefore any reasonable pah template can be used here , with the understanding that it is only an approximiation for any given galaxy .",
    "a power - law , @xmath29@xmath30@xmath31 , is a proxy for the warm , small grain emission ( roughly @xmath1060@xmath0 m ) .",
    "this is cut - off as @xmath32@xmath33@xmath34 in order not to interfere with the far - ir / sub - mm wavelength emission , which is described by a thermal , @xmath29@xmath30@xmath35^{-1}$ ] , component .",
    "since we typically only have the 24@xmath0 m  point to constrain this component , we fix @xmath36 at 3.0 , which smoothly connects this to the greybody component .",
    "extinction , parameterized by @xmath6 , is applied using the @xmath37=3.1 milky way - type extinction curve of draine ( 2003 ) .",
    "this includes the 9.7@xmath0 m  si absorption feature , which thus becomes noticeable in this model at high opacities .",

    "as expected , there is a greater range in sed shapes than accounted for by the data uncertainties .",
    "however , there are natural groupings , for example one can easily distinguish uligs ( e.g.  n1 - 064 , n1 - 078 ) from ligs ( n1 - 015 , n1 - 039 ) and from normal galaxies ( e.g. n1 - 002 , n1 - 009 ) .",
    "the grey shading in fig .  [ seds ] gives a sense of the uncertainty of the sed fits . without prior assumptions on the shape of the sed ( s.a . by using templates ) as in this case , if we do not have constraints on both sides of the thermal peak ( e.g. n1 - 078 ) , a wide range of sed shapes and consequently temperatures , luminosities etc .",
    "are acceptable .    in fig .",
    "[ coldspec ] , we address the question of what is the ` typical ' normal / cold galaxy spectrum based on our model fits . in order to minimize redshift bias",
    ", we construct a composite spectrum from all sources with redshifts below 0.1 , and for which 24@xmath0 m  data are available . to minimize luminosity effects",
    ", we also normalize the spectra at 4.5@xmath0 m  ( which point resulted in the least amount of scatter across the sed ) and effectively is a normalization in stellar mass .",
    "this procedure is consistent with results for _ iso _ key project normal galaxies , where the stellar+pah seds were found to be fairly constant @xcite . comparing the results with a number of common sed models",
    ", we find that our sample is best described by fairly cold spectra with low mid - ir / far - ir ratios . in fig .",
    "[ seds ] , we see that the ligs ( i.e.  presumably starbursts ) also have fairly cold spectra , unlike that of the ` prototypical ' starburst m82 ( this was already noted in d05 ) .    even more surprisingly , this cold trend does not appear to reverse for the highest luminosity sources including uligs .",
    "it must be noted however that it is not clear how common are such seds for uligs in general as we only have two spectroscopic uligs in our sample and our far - ir selection likely biases us toward colder sources . in fig .",
    "[ uligs ] we show the best - fit seds for the two spectroscopically confirmed @xmath9@xmath10.51.0 sources @xcite .",
    "the dotted line is an arp220 template @xcite at the appropriate redshift . in both cases",
    "the sub - mm data are well fit by the arp220 template , but the mid - ir data differ by an order of magnitude . our photometric highest-@xmath9 source ( n1 - 78 ) shows similar trends .",
    "note that the pah features in the best - fit n1 - 064 spectrum are not constrained by any data point and therefore a model with no pah emission is quite acceptable as well ( see the spread in fig .",
    "[ seds ] ) . despite it being poorly constrained for the few highest-@xmath9 sources , we find clear evidence for prominent pah emission for nearly all sources in our sample , regardless of redshift ( and hence luminosity ) .",
    "the weak mid - ir continua , and strong pah emission of our sources suggest that they are star - formation rather than agn dominated ( see e.g.  sajina , lacy , scott 2005 ) .      in table  [ props ] , we present both the total infrared power output of our sources ( @xmath40 ) , as well as the luminosity due to pah emission alone .",
    "the overall luminosities we derive are typically a few@xmath33@xmath41@xmath18  for our lower-@xmath9 targets , consistent with roughly @xmath42 galaxies .",
    "@xmath5 is obtained by integrating under the pah component alone .",
    "we find the @xmath43 fraction to be typically 515% .",
    "this is consistent with the results for the _ iso _ key project galaxies @xcite .",
    "since such well - sampled seds are rare , to obtain the overall infrared luminosity , extrapolations from the mid - ir are common .",
    "however , the coldness of our sources means that , if such sources are the norm , prior relations might not be applicable . in fig .",
    "[ lums ] we compare our results on the mid - ir / total - ir relation with previous , _ iras_-based , results ( e.g.  takeuchi et al .  2005 ) .",
    "the solid line is the best - fit for our sample , which is : @xmath44 our rest - frame 24@xmath0 m  fluxes are below those expected from the _ iras _ relation by @xmath10.4dex .",
    "although we have too few sources at the high-@xmath45 end to claim this conclusively , it appears that the relation drops even further for these sources .",
    "more likely , however , this is just an indication of the underlying scatter in the relationship due to variations in the sed shape .",
    "this discrepancy with the earlier relation is most likely a selection bias .",
    "the sample used for the _ iras _ relation is flux - limited to all four _ iras _ bands , leading to a bias toward sources with stronger warm continuum , unlike our 170@xmath0 m  selection where the bias is toward the presence of cold dust instead .",
    "we return to this point in section  5.1 .",
    "about 70% of the sample have @xmath46@xmath1011 , while the remaining 30% have @xmath46@xmath1611 .",
    "this can be thought of as the break - up between fairly quiescent and more actively starforming galaxies ( we address the mode of star - formation of our galaxies in detail in section  5.3 ) .",
    "the total infrared luminosity is well known to trace the current sfr of a galaxy ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we use the kennicutt relation here which is : @xmath47 note the slightly different definition of @xmath4 , which is accounted for here ( i.e.  81000@xmath0 m  rather than 31000@xmath0 m ) .",
    "typically our galaxies have sfr of @xmath15@xmath48/yr , which is slightly enhanced with respect to local quiescent spirals .",
    "as expected , the sfrs rise to a few hundred @xmath48/yr for our few uligs .",
    "as part of our sed model fitting we estimate the @xmath49-corrected , and dust corrected near - ir stellar emission .",
    "the near - ir is preferred for deriving stellar mass as it is fairly robust against both uncertainties in the dust obscuration level ( a factor of @xmath110 less so than in the optical ) , and to the details of the stellar population and sfh ( being largely sensitive to the red giant population only ) . without sufficient optical coverage , we can not properly account for the possible contribution of young stars .",
    "we merely calculate the un - extincted , restframe @xmath50 , and convert this to stellar mass by assuming an appropriate _ k_-band mass - to - light ratio , @xmath51 . despite its relative insensitivity to young stars , the near - ir mass - to - light ratio does increase as the fraction of young / massive stars in the galaxy increases .",
    "in addition , a degeneracy exists in that a more massive and dustier galaxy can appear similar to a less massive and less obscured one .",
    "the significance of this effect grows for sources without _ j_-band data or with poor near - ir snr , both of which are more common for the higher-@xmath9 sources .",
    "however , since the optical depth is a free parameter in our model , it is already accounted for in the resulting markov chains . the uncertainty in mass - to - light",
    "ratio however is not included .",
    "the additional uncertainty on the stellar mass is : @xmath52=@xmath53 .",
    "a mean value of @xmath51=0.6 was found by @xcite for their sample of spiral galaxies , while @xcite find @xmath51 to be @xmath10.92 for their sample of starburst and hii galaxies .",
    "@xcite consider a wide range of reasonable population models , finding @xmath54@xmath10.2dex ( although this is smaller if the _ b__k _ colour is known , due to the effect of the young stars ) .",
    "the sfrs derived for our sources in the previous section suggest enhanced star - formation activity compared with normal spirals .",
    "therefore , the gil de paz et al value of @xmath51=0.92 is likely more appropriate for our sample , while we assume the bell&de jong uncertainty ( from the unknown sfhs ) of 0.2 . adding this in quadrature to the mcmc derived errors suggests that more realistic uncertainties here are about twice the quoted ones .    with the above set of assumptions , we find @xmath55@xmath12@xmath3310@xmath56@xmath57 , values are @xmath13@xmath3310@xmath56@xmath57 . ] with the @xmath46@xmath1011 sources and those with @xmath46@xmath1611 differing by @xmath10.6dex .",
    "note , however , that from the above discussion we expect that somewhat higher values for @xmath58 are appropriate for the more luminous ( higher sfr ) galaxies , and vice versa for the lower luminosity ones . taking this into account , the observed difference in mass",
    "may be even largely in reality .    for most sources ,",
    "we find modest levels of dust extinction ( 0@xmath10@xmath27@xmath105 , peaking at @xmath13 ) for most sources .",
    "this assumes a screen geometry , and would increase in a uniform mixture of dust and stars .",
    "the amount of extinction generally increases for @xmath9@xmath280.3 sources , with n1 - 040 requiring the greatest optical depth , consistent with its near - ir faintness ( note however that the mean - likelihood and mcmc approaches disagree on the optical depths of the high-@xmath9 sources  see appendix  a ) .",
    "the values of @xmath27 we find for the bulk of the firback n1 galaxies , is consistent with the average @xmath27@xmath13 found from the @xmath59 ratio of the firback - south galaxies @xcite .",
    "this means that , typically , the optical depths to which the light of old and young stars is subjected do not differ dramatically when integrated across the galaxy ( see also section  5.2 ) .",
    "the single greybody approach we take ( see section  [ secmodel ] ) in modeling the dust emission of these galaxies , although in common use and the only one possible when just a few data points are available , is clearly an approximation ( see also * ? ? ?",

    "more realistically , a distribution of dust grain characteristics , such as optical properties and geometry , results in a distribution of effective temperatures and @xmath3 s . in addition , degeneracies arise in fitting this model due to the functional form and spectral sampling ( see appendix  [ secgrey ] for further discussion ) .

    "these sizes are consistent with those of large spirals .",
    "in this section , we use the results of the previous section in attempting to arrive at a consistent picture of the physical properties of our sources .",
    "we particularly focus on three related questions .",
    "why are all our galaxies , including the uligs , colder than expected ?",
    "can we say something about the spatial distribution of the star - formation activity  i.e. is there indication of centrally concentrated starbursts surrounded by older stellar haloes , or is the star - formation by contrast distributed throughout the galaxy ? and finally , is the typical firback galaxy actually starbursting ? .",
    "both our general inspection of the seds and the derived dust temperatures for our sample suggest that fairly cold spectra with weak ( compared with _ iras _ galaxies ) mid - ir emission describe our entire sample , despite three orders of magnitude variation in bolometric luminosity .",
    "this can be seen directly by examining the @xmath45@xmath2 relation ( see * ? ? ?",
    "this relation is of particular significance to far - ir / sub - mm selected samples , as in principle it can reveal something of the nature of the sources based on only a few spectral points ( enough , for example , for a single greybody fit ) , because it is simply a relation between the location of the far - ir peak and its overall strength . in fig .",
    "[ lum_td ] , we compare the location of our sample in the ( @xmath45 ,  @xmath2 ) plane with other infrared - selected samples , namely the scuba - selected high-@xmath9 sources @xcite and the bright _ iras_-selected galaxies @xcite .",
    "we overplot empirical relations appropriate for merging and quiescent galaxies @xcite .",
    "these can be understood intuitively by recalling that ideally , @xmath45@xmath30@xmath72 .",
    "this leads to luminosity increasing with temperature if the size is kept constant , or conversely to a more concentrated starburst being hotter than a galaxy of the same luminosity but with more spread - out star - formation ( as in throughout the full disk ) . with a few exceptions ,",
    "our sample is consistent ( within the uncertainties , and given the different selection from that of _ iras _ galaxies ) with the relation for quiescent galaxies ( for further discussion of the relation see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and consistent with our size results in section  4.5 .",
    "the above discussion , taken a step further , suggests that our cold uligs might show extended star - formation activity , rather than the usual nuclear - concentration seen in the late stages of major mergers @xcite .",
    "such a scenario has in particular been proposed for some scuba galaxies @xcite .",
    "locally , only nuclear starbursts appear capable of reaching the requisite sfr / luminosity .",
    "however , at high-@xmath9 , where presumably the progenitors are less evolved and more gas rich ( i.e. with lower stability thresholds ) , it is possible that a major merger results in a disk - wide starburst ( or rather many pockets throughout the disk ) instead @xcite",
    ". alternatively , a cause of cold uligs might be extreme opacity around a nuclear starburst and/or agn .      in the previous section",
    ", we argue that the coldness of our sources , including both ligs and uligs , might be due to star - formation spread over an extended cold disk , rather than a nuclear starburst surrounded by an old stellar halo . here",
    "we apply two independent tests of this scenario .",
    "our first test is based on the assumption that the ir emission is dominated by power absorbed by the dust from young stars , while the dust responsible for the near - ir opacity traces the old stellar population .",
    "the two should match in a disk - wide star - formation picture , while there is no reason for a correlation in a nuclear starburst . in section  4.4",
    "we derived the dust mass based on the far - ir emission of our galaxies . in principle , the optical depth derived in section  4.3 can also be converted to dust mass , provided the surface area of the optical region is known .",
    "we do this using the following equation , adapted from @xcite by using @xmath73=1.3@xmath74 and assuming the geometry is an inclined disk : @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the the inclination , such that 0@xmath77 is face - on and 90@xmath77 is edge - on .    in section  4.5 , we presented the effective radii of our sources as derived from the irac images .",
    "we found no difference between the 4 irac bands and therefore it is safe to assume that these radii represent the spatial extent of the old stellar population . in fig .",
    "[ tau_md ] , we compare this optically derived dust mass and the ir - derived dust masses . the two clearly correlate , as expected . however , the best - fit slope is 0.86 unlike the expected 1.00 .",
    "the arrows define the directions in which either increasing disk inclination or increasing @xmath64 push the points .",
    "note that increasing inclination is equivalent to decreasing the size of the region contributing the bulk of the ir emission ( i.e. towards nuclear starburst ) .",
    "therefore at the high - mass end , the good agreement suggests that the dust ( behind the ir emission in particular ) is distributed throughout the entire disk rather than being concentrated in the nuclear region ( see next section ) .",
    "somewhat contradictory , the high values of @xmath27 we find are also fully consistent ( but the lower values implied by the likelihood analysis are not  see appendix  a ) .",
    "the two can be reconciled by a more complex geometry .    at the low mass end",
    "we find consistently higher dust masses than expected from the above formula and the derived optical depths ( hence the shallower slope ) .",
    "this may merely indicate that the highest - sfr regions responsible for the dust emission are behind a foreground screen of much less obscured older stars which are responsible for the near - ir emission .",
    "another interpretation , is that our ir - based dust mass is overestimated .",
    "adopting the extreme end of @xmath64 values in the literature @xcite , @xmath64@xmath10.2 , will decrease our estimates by about 0.4dex , making the two estimates much more consistent .",
    "the inclination can not reconcile them as it only affects the points to the right of the dashed line ( face - on case ) .",
    "this relation should probably not be over interpreted , since both expressions are approximations to much more complex systems and seeking a perfect agreement between them is therefore unrealistic . within the uncertainties , we are gratified that our two independent estimates of the dust content agree as well as they do .    given the above uncertainties , and especially if @xmath64 is underestimated , it is still possible that some of our sources ( especially among the higher-@xmath45 ones ) are primarily powered by nuclear starbursts",
    ". we can determine the actual sizes of the star - forming / bursting regions in our galaxies by using the well known relation between gas surface density and sfr surface density @xcite .",
    "the implied universality of the star - formation efficiency has been demonstrated observationally over many orders of magnitude in sfr density @xcite .",
    "the slope of the relation sfr@xmath30@xmath78 is @xmath79=1.4 ( the kennicutt relation ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , the dependence of both quantities on radius is the same ( since sfr and gas mass are derived from integrated properties , their respective surface densities are simply @xmath30@xmath80 ) , meaning that a change in the effective radius takes the form of a translation along a line of slope @xmath79=1.0 .",
    "thus , assuming that the efficiency of star - formation is indeed universal , any departure from the kennicutt relation could be attributed to a difference in effective radius .",
    "we estimate the gas mass by assuming the milky way gas - to - dust ratio of 100 @xcite , although the derived values , for external galaxies especially , show a large spread of about an order of magnitude ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . with these estimates , in fig .",
    "[ gas_sfr ] , we overplot our sources onto the original kennicutt sample of normal spirals , and ir - bright starbursts .",
    "most of our galaxies lie on this relation ( within the errors ) somewhat above the spirals , consistent with the sfrs found in section  4.2 .",
    "this suggests that the bulk of our sample is indeed forming stars throughout their extended disk , although slightly more actively ( due to more gas - rich disks ) than in local spirals .",
    "+ the good agreement between our sample and the kennicutt relation suggests that both the estimated radii and the assumed standard dust - to - gas ratio are approximately correct .",
    "the inset in fig .",
    "[ gas_sfr ] gives the size distribution of the sample , which is roughly consistent with that of local spiral galaxies @xcite .",
    "an _ hst_-based study of the size distributions of slightly higher redshift ( @xmath9@xmath10.21 ) disk galaxies suggests effective radii in the same range with the peak moving from @xmath16kpc to @xmath14kpc as the redshift decreases @xcite .    as a final test , we double check the above conclusions by looking at the relation between @xmath4 and @xmath81 ( which should scale with luminosity , for simple geometries ) .",
    "as expected we find a good correlation between the two .",
    "the linear fit gives : @xmath82 where @xmath45 is in @xmath83 , @xmath11 is in k , and @xmath84 is in kpc .",
    "there are no obvious outliers ( the rms is 0.4 ) , again suggesting that given the cool temperatures derived , the radii inferred from the 8@xmath0 m  images are appropriate ( to within a factor of 2 ) .      in the previous section",
    ", we found that the typical firback galaxy has modest sfr , typically @xmath15@xmath57@xmath85 , but this is somewhat enhanced activity compared with local quiescent spiral galaxies .",
    "our investigations so far suggest disk - like star - formation , with no indication of mergers , especially for the low-@xmath9 sample .",
    "now we would like to address the question of whether this enhanced star - formation could reasonably be described as a ` starburst ' .",
    "there is no single absolute definition of a starburst , but some commonly used indicators @xcite include : a high intensity of star - formation ; a high birthrate parameter ( sfr/@xmath86 ) ; or a low ratio of the gas depletion timescale to the dynamical timescale .",
    "the question is  when is ` high ' high enough , and when is ` low ' low enough .",
    "we now discuss each criterion in turn .",
    "the intensity of star - formation , was indirectly addressed in fig .",
    "[ gas_sfr ] .",

    "the highest-@xmath9 sources ( n1 - 064 , and n1 - 078 ) are apparently the only unambiguous starbursts .",
    "the region occupied by the bulk of our _ entire _ galaxies is in fact also the locus of the _ centres _ of disk galaxies alone @xcite .",
    "so , is the star - formation in our galaxies fairly smoothly distributed across the disk or in a collection of bursting knots sprinkled throughout ?",
    "are we diluting our results by assuming a smooth disk here ?",
    "it appears that the intensity argument is inconclusive when applied to unresolved galaxies except in the most extreme cases .",
    "the birthrate parameter is slightly misleading , because of its dependence on the epoch of observation ( although this is not too severe for our sample ) .",
    "a related quantity , which we examine next , is the specific sfr ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which is equivalent to the birthrate assuming a uniform epoch .",
    "the best way to interpret this is through comparison with other samples whose properties are already known , and for this purpose we use the compilation of @xcite .",
    "however , such comparisons should be carried out with some caution , since the samples are selected in very different ways and their quoted sfrs are based on different indicators .",
    "the main distinction here is that these other samples are based on the strength of the h@xmath36 emission line , while ours are based on the overall ir emission .",
    "the two are comparable , but not identical ( largely due to the effects of dust extinction on the line strength at the high-@xmath45 end and possible contribution of older stars to the ir emission at low luminosities ) . here",
    "we use the empirical relation of @xcite to convert our ir - based sfrs to h@xmath36-based ones .",

    "the two outliers are the two uligs n1 - 064 , and n1 - 078 which are predictably both massive and active .",
    "we finally turn to the ratio of the gas depletion timescale ( @xmath87 ) to the dynamical timescale ( @xmath88 ) of a galaxy . unlike the above two considerations , the starburst criterion is clearer here . if the current rate of sfr is such that , if sustained , the available gas reservoir will be exhausted in a time shorter than the dynamical time , then the source is bursting .",

    "we have addressed these issues from a number of ( admittedly not always independent ) perspectives and concluded that the bulk of the sample is consistent with @xmath1@xmath95 mass galaxies , which are forming stars somewhat more actively than local spirals , but are likely not actually starbursting according to the usual definition .",
    "their mode of star - formation is consistent with slightly enhanced activity in the disk , rather than the nuclear bursts associated with major mergers .",

    "this is the approach we take when returning to the effect of priors in section  a.2 . for now , flat priors are assumed for all parameters , and therefore from now on the posterior and likelihood distributions are used synonymously .    in principle ,",
    "arbitrary shapes of the posterior distribution can be sampled using a simple monte carlo approach .",
    "however for multi - dimensional problems , where the ratio of high - probability volume to total volume is very small , this can quickly become computationally prohibitive .",
    "the basic idea behind mcmc is to effectively sample this distribution by building up chains of random guesses of parameter values , where each successive guess is chosen from some much smaller proposal distribution , @xmath109 , around the previous chain link .",
    "this move is accepted or rejected according to some criterion , which both pushes the chain toward higher probability regions , and allows for some random deviation from the straight gradient descent - type path .",

    "we assume that the likelihood of a given solution is the usual expression given by : @xmath116 where the second term is the @xmath117 .",
    "the probability ( @xmath118 ) that the system finds itself in a given state is given by the boltzman factor , where the ` energy ' is @xmath117 , and thus @xmath119 is @xmath120 ( this is called the ` odds ' of the given solution ) .",
    "the temperature , @xmath11 , has effectively the same function as the width of the proposal distribution , in that it determines how easy it is for the system to jump a particular distance from its current state .",
    "since brute - force mcmc is a fairly slow procedure , rather than initialize the chain at some random point we begin with some reasonable guess at the best model .",
    "other possibilities would include simulated annealing , such as used in @xcite , or equivalently using variable widths of the proposal distribution , or using any other optimization technique to find the high probability regions quickly .",
    "for our purposes here , starting with a reasonable guess is deemed sufficient since we still explore the full region of physically plausible solutions .",
    "the numerical parameters which need to be set are : the width of the proposal distribution for each parameter ( the @xmath109-width ) ; the temperature ; and the overall length of the chain . too low a @xmath109-width , will tend to acceptance of too many trials , while too high a value will give some jumps far outside the high probability regions , resulting in low acceptance rates .",
    "trial - and - error has shown that an acceptance ratio in the range 1030% is reasonable ( this is supported by empirical studies which show that @xmath125% acceptance rate in problems with @xmath162 dimensions minimizes internal correlations in the resulting chain @xcite ) . to find the appropriate @xmath109-width",
    ", we make shorter ( 30,000 ) runs , where we vary only one parameter at a time .",
    "we start with a guess at the @xmath109-widths for each and incrementally adjust them until the resulting acceptance rates are 5080% ( which is appropriate for 1-dimensional problems ) . by trial and error",
    "we have found that this leads to acceptance rates in the desired 10 - 30% range when all seven parameters are varied simultaneously .",
    "this approach works better for our sample than fixing the widths a priori , since the dynamic range for the various parameters is too high .",
    "such optimization of the proposal distributions before the main run speeds up the process , while preserving the ergodicity of the mcmc algorithm @xcite .",
    "we set @xmath11 to 0.9 , which results in points @xmath121@xmath117@xmath11 away from the best solution to be accepted with 30% probability .",
    "note however , that since increasing the temperature increases the acceptance rate as well ( preserving the @xmath122 ratio ) and vice versa , in principle the temperature and @xmath109-width are degenerate , and therefore the exact value of the temperature chosen is not crucial as it will be compensated for in the above width adjustment . for the overall length of the chain , we need to find the length which both samples the posterior probability distribution well and at the same time ( for practical reasons ) is not much longer than what is just needed to accomplish this .",
    "we use 600,000 iterations , since our experience shows that the posterior probability around the best solution is well - sampled by this time .",
    "this procedure still leaves us with little sensitivity to highly disjointed solutions of equal goodness - of - fit , although this is not of concern here as such solutions will most likely converge onto unphyiscal values .",
    "since we start at a high - probability part of the parameter space , the ` burn - in ' period is less well defined than when starting at a random position , and we therefore do not formaly subtract a ` burn - in ' part of the chain .",

    "[ demo ] shows an example of the resulting chain in various projections .      as discussed above",
    ", the mcmc procedure samples the likelihood surface , which is proportional to the posterior probability distribution of interest .",
    "we use flat priors , where negative values are not accepted for any parameter .",
    "in addition , upper limits are set for the temperature ( 100k ) , optical depth ( 30 ) , and @xmath3 ( 3 ) .",
    "the latter is necessary , since for many sources the snr in the sub - mm data is very low , leading to the difference in overall @xmath117s for unphysically large values of @xmath3 to be small , and the chain can get stuck in such regions . since @xmath3 is believed , both on theoretical and observational grounds , to be in the range @xmath112 ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) , we believe our 03 prior is reasonable . the temperature limit is also necessary because of the above difference in snr .",
    "the optical depth limit is only relevant for the few sources with higher @xmath124 and faint near - ir / irac detections ( e.g. n1 - 040 , n1 - 064 ) .",
    "these limits are imposed by returning the chain to the vicinity of its initial state in order to avoid getting stuck at the edge .",
    "we come back to the effects of the prior below .",
    "the chains obtained above allow for two distinct routes to obtaining the probability distributions for each parameter .",
    "the first is the easier straight marginalization of the given parameter over all the others .",
    "this is represented by : @xmath125 which in practice is just counting the number of times the chain visits a particular bin of values for the given parameter @xmath126 .",
    "however , since we record the @xmath117 value for each chain link , we can also directly obtain the likelihood distribution ( see eq - n  [ likeq ] ) for the parameter . in practice , a simplified form of this is the mean likelihood distribution @xcite . the idea is to calculate the average @xmath117 for each bin and then compare this with the minimum @xmath117 achieved by the chain as @xmath127,\\ ] ] where @xmath128 is the mean @xmath117 in the @xmath129 bin .    in fig .",
    "[ erdist ] , we show the distributions for all parameters obtained using both methods for the whole sample . note that since we have applied a @xmath117 cut ( see above ) , secondary features in the marginalized distributions , such as blended peaks and tails , are still fairly likely . for example , in the case of n1 - 101 , @xmath2@xmath125k is the preferred solution , but @xmath2@xmath140k is still quite likely .",
    "the uneven error - bars indicate this .",
    "note that in table  [ props ] , for simplicity , we quote the average error only , but indicate the different error - bars in the figures . however , due to its definition , applying a @xmath117 cut when estimating the mean likelihood tends to flatten the distributions .",
    "therefore in that case , the most ` peaked ' distributions possible are obtained if the whole of the chains are used .",
    "this means that parameters poorly constrained by the @xmath117 are clearly visible in the likelihood curves ( e.g. @xmath5 for the highest-@xmath9 sources n1 - 064 , and n1 - 078 ) .",
    "the best - fit values we use are merely the peaks of the above distributions . to obtain the uncertainties on those we define a desired confidence level and , starting from the peak of the distribution , move to incrementally lower equal probability bins on each side of it until the area covered is equal to the total area times the desired confidence level .",
    "thus unsymmetric errorbars are indicative of asymmetric probability distributions .    in fig .",
    "[ erdist ] , we see that in general the marginalized and mean likelihood distributions agree reasonably well with each other . however , there are two instances where they disagree substantially .",
    "one is for @xmath3 , where the likelihood tends toward unphysically high values .",
    "the origins of this are discussed in appendix  c. our imposed prior confines the marginalized distribution to more reasonable values .",
    "we also find significant differences between the two approaches for @xmath27 .",
    "here we are again clearly affected by our choice of prior .",
    "[ tau_prior ] shows how our uniform prior - based distribution transforms into the mean likelihood distribution by application of the jeffreys prior ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "note that the offsets in the pah luminosity and stellar mass values are also due to this difference . for the highest-@xmath9 sources , n1 - 064 and n1 - 078",
    ", the marginalized distributions result in essentially unconstrained @xmath27 ( no clear peak in the distributions ) , thus the values listed in table  2 are fairly meaningless .",
    "for these two cases , we find the mean - likelihood distribution to be more indicative , in both cases a clear , although fairly broad , peak exists at @xmath27@xmath15 .",
    "we discuss the effects of this discrepancy as appropriate .",
    "the most common approach to photometric redshift estimates is template fitting .",
    "its effectiveness is obviously strongly dependent on the templates used and the data available ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* for a discussion ) .",
    "our multi - component sed model ( described in section  [ secmodel ] ) effectively represents a large and flexible template library .",
    "therefore , we here describe the results of fitting this model , while keeping the redshift a free parameter .",
    "the results we present use the full ir sed , however , we note that the near - ir and irac data are the most constraining in terms of redshift determination .",
    "this is particularly true for @xmath9@xmath960.3 where the major pah features leave the irac 8@xmath0 m  band . with sufficiently good snr",
    ", the approach also works at somewhat higher redshifts due to the 1.6@xmath0 m  stellar peak being probed by the near - ir data ( although in our case the irac data is not sufficiently sensitive to do this reliably at @xmath9@xmath11 ) .",
    "we use model spectra which are generated on a logarithmic grid in wavelength , where @xmath130=0.005 .",
    "this leads to a minimum redshift resolution ( @xmath131 ) of 0.01 , which is adequate for our purposes .",
    "+    in order to adapt our earlier model - fitting to this problem , a few modifications are needed .",
    "first , our results in section  4.4 suggest that @xmath3@xmath12 adequately described the far - ir / sub - mm emission of our galaxies .",
    "therefore , here we fix @xmath3=2 .",
    "next , to avoid some clearly unphysical solutions , we restrict the code to the range 0.1@xmath10@xmath132@xmath100.9",
    ". this condition is fully satisfied by all our sources when the spectroscopic redshifts are used ( except n1 - 040 , where pah emission is apparently completely absent ) , and moreover is required if the rest - frame sources are to agree with our simulated irac colour - colour plot in @xcite .",
    "lastly , due to the @xmath133 degeneracy , the temperature parameter we vary here is @xmath133 .",
    "this last step removes the strongest correlation in the resulting chains .",
    "however , we find that the results are subject to additional degeneracies of redshift with other parameters , including : a negative correlation with the stellar amplitude ; a positive correlation with the pah amplitude ; and a negative correlation with optical depth",
    ". these are clearly not independent .",
    "[ zphot_prob ] shows the marginalized distributions we obtain for photometric redshift fits .",
    "note that the mean likelihood distributions here are poorly constrained , most likely due to the above degeneracies .",
    "overall , the agreement between our mcmc estimates and the spectroscopic redshifts ( where available ) is quite good .",
    "the worst case is n1 - 040 where the near - ir / irac data have very low snr and moreover the source is apparently devoid of pah emission , thus the constraint comes entirely from the far - ir / sub - mm which is not very accurate , as can be seen in this case ( see also @xcite ) . we have left out n1 - 064 , whose high redshift ( 0.91 ) is in a different regime ( the pah features have completely left the irac bands ) and therefore an accurate redshift can not be obtained with the above method .",
    "n1 - 078 is also believed to be at @xmath9@xmath11 ( s03 ) and has an sed very reminiscent of n1 - 064",
    ". therefore we will assume it to be at @xmath9=0.91 as well , although note that the uncertainty is @xmath10.5 .",
    "[ zphot_prob ] shows that there is a bias in the model towards preferring somewhat higher redshifts compared with the spectroscopic ones .",
    "the above degeneracies result in double - peaked distributions ( e.g.  n1 - 001 , n1 - 007 ) , and in some cases the ` wrong ' peak is preferred ( n1 - 004 , n1 - 031 ) .",
    "all of these issues suggest that the model , although working in general , is imperfect at this point .",
    "improvements are needed in minimizing the remaining degeneracies , which must involve including additional constraints .",
    "two obvious steps are the use of the relation between absorption - derived and emission - derived dust mass , as discussed in section  5.2 ( this requires the effective sizes of galaxies ) , and the use of distance dimming .",
    "the latter for example effectively excludes the higher-@xmath9 solution for n1 - 004 , but not for n1 - 031 . for n1 - 040",
    ", the distance dimming argument would in fact support the wrong solution , which was brought about largely by the imposition of ` typical ' stars - to - pah ratios .",
    "therefore , the range in galaxy sed types needs to be known better and accounted for here before these steps can be implemented .",
    "after accounting for all these issues , we find that the average uncertainty of our estimated redshifts is @xmath134\\rangle$]=0.06 .",
    "thus in summary we adopt the following redshifts : n1 - 013(0.46 ) , n1 - 045(0.18 ) , n1 - 068(0.16 ) , n1 - 077(0.20 ) , and n1 - 083(0.31 ) .",
    "based on optical template fitting @xcite derived the following redshifts : n1 - 013(0.58 ) , n1 - 045(0.09 ) , n1 - 068(0.23 ) , n1 - 077(0.19 ) , and n1 - 083(0.51 ) . assuming these are correct , our results on average are uncertain to @xmath134\\rangle$]=0.07 , which is slightly worse than the above quoted uncertainty as expected when comparing against other photometric redshift estimates . for simplicity",
    ", we are going to ignore the uncertainty on the estimates and treat these redshifts as fixed .",
    "a common approach , especially with a limited number of far - ir / sub - mm data points , is to fit a greybody function with characteristic temperature and emissivity .",
    "there are three main questions arising from the practice and interpretation of these fits : + 1 ) what degeneracies are present in the usual formulation , and therefore what are the optimal parameters to fit ?",
    "+ 2 ) given that this is only an approximation to the true shape of the sed , what effect does the spectral sampling ( such as due to redshift ) have on the results obtained ?",
    "+ 3 ) how does one disentangle physical correlations from said degeneracies ?    for further discussion",
    ", see also @xcite and the alternative parameterization of @xcite .",
    "in essence , the function one is fitting has the form : @xmath135@xmath33@xmath136 , where @xmath136 is the planck function : @xmath137    the parameters to determine here are @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and the nuisance parameter @xmath138 ( or some equivalent normalization ) .",
    "we wish to disentangle any correlations between the three . to begin with , to understand how degeneracies arise between the various parameters , we need to consider what it is that the code is actually fitting .",
    "intuitively , to first order this is the overall amplitude of the dust emission , the position of the peak , and the slope in the rayleigh - jeans tail .",
    "the first of these functional parameters is the bolometric dust flux , @xmath139 , which is given by @xmath140 where @xmath141 is the complete gamma function , and @xmath142 is the riemann zeta function is @xmath601 for any positive value of @xmath3 , so does not affect the result much .",
    "the quantity @xmath143 is closely approximated by 0.69(1 + 0.69@xmath3 ) , which we use . ] . rearranging the above and",
    "substituting for @xmath144 in @xmath29 removes the bulk of the degeneracies of the normalization parameter ( which is now taken to be @xmath139 ) .",
    "nevertheless , the temperature and @xmath3 are still correlated . as stated above , the fitting process",
    "is also concerned with the position of the peak in the emission . by solving @xmath145=0",
    "we obtain : @xmath146 - 3.\\ ] ] this equation provides a good fit to the observed correlation at higher values of @xmath3 ( see fig .",
    "c1 ) , but fails as @xmath3 approaches 1 .",
    "the reason for this is obvious ",
    "apart from the peak , we also need to match the rayleigh jeans tail .",
    "the sub - mm data do not allow @xmath3 to become arbitrarily shallow , although it can be compensated by increasing the temperature ( which pulls the planck function the other way ) .",
    "the constraint coming from the rayleigh - jeans tail can be parametrized with the sub - mm spectral index , @xmath147 which is related to @xmath3 , but in the rayleigh - jeans approximation the temperature dependence falls out leaving : @xmath148 looking at our data ( when the snr at 450@xmath0 m  was high ) , we find typical values of @xmath147@xmath15 , which means @xmath3@xmath11.5 from eq - n .",
    "[ alphasubmm ] , which is in fact often adopted for sub - mm sources .",
    "the joint constraint on the spectral index leads to : @xmath149+\\alpha_{\\rm{submm}}-2\\log\\left(\\frac{850}{450}\\right)-6.\\ ] ] in fig .",
    "c1 , we show how the above two constraints act together and therefore how the available data drive the @xmath3 and temperature values found .",
    "for example , in data without well determined peak position , assuming a low value of @xmath3 ( say , 11.5 ) will automatically lead to the conclusion of hotter temperatures .",
    "conversely , in data with cool temperatures and well determined peak , but poorly sampled sub - mm data , the conclusion will always be that @xmath3 is high ( even @xmath162 if the fit is allowed to go there ) .",
    "better sampling ( which could mean better snr or more spectral points ) in the sub - mm ( relative to the peak ) would likely change that un - physical conclusion .",
    "conversely , as the redshift is increased , our data increasingly sample the peak rather than the tail of the thermal emission , and this has the same effect .",
    "this degeneracy is empirically well known @xcite .",
    "apart from this degeneracy arising from the functional form used , there has also been suggestions that a physical inverse relationship exists as well . in particular , this was seen when the best - fit temperature and @xmath3 values for different milky way environments were compared by @xcite .",
    "the relative homogeneity of our sample ( see fig .",
    "[ betat ] ) does not allow us to firmly support or reject this relationship ( although the apparently warmest source , n1 - 078 , supports it ) . a wider range of galaxy types with well sampled seds",
    "would be needed to address this firmly .",
    "however , we note that ( as discussed above ) as the peak of the sed shifts , the combined @xmath3,@xmath11 distribution moves as well .",
    "but in the dupac et al .",
    "sample the shortest wavelength is 100@xmath0 m , thus whenever the peak is shortward of that ( corresponding to @xmath130k for @xmath3@xmath12 ) , the sub - mm index begins to dominates the fit , flattening the distribution . at the other extreme for example , as the peak reaches the coldest observed values ( corresponding to peaks at @xmath1200@xmath0 m ) , we are sampling a distribution where @xmath11@xmath115k for @xmath3@xmath12 ( see fig .",
    "therefore , it appears that this correlation is easily explained as a sequence of progressively colder / hotter environments .",
    "the apparent @xmath3@xmath11 correlation is merely a combination of the intrinsic correlation between @xmath2 and @xmath3 for individual sources and limited wavelength coverage .",
    "that being said , a physical correlation here is to be expected from the different optical properties of grains at different temperatures .",
    "but it is unclear that the single greybody approach is capable of testing this adequately ."
