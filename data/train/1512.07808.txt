    "the other two fields were observed much longer post - grb , and indeed the hosts in these cases are brighter , so any afterglow contamination should be negligible .      to verify that the photometric analysis presented here is robust and the results are independent of the specific procedure followed , we carried out an independent analysis of the images using the pipeline developed by the brightest of reionizing galaxies ( borg ) survey , which searched for high-@xmath25 galaxies ( see * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",

    "in short , we first derived variance ( rms ) maps from the weight maps produced by astrodrizzle , then ran sextractor in dual - image mode for a preliminary identification of the sources . finally , we normalized the rms maps to account for correlated noise by measuring the background in random positions that are not associated to any source , and ran sextractor with the normalized rms maps to construct the final catalogue .    for grb 050904 and grb 130606a ,",

    "the net result is a sample of @xmath167 hosts for which @xmath168 have redshifts and all but @xmath169 of the remainder have photometric constraints placing them at @xmath170 @xcite .",
    "beyond @xmath171 the tough sample suffers from small number statistics , and we supplement it with additional hosts for which photometry is available in the literature .",
    "although these additional data are more subject to optical selection effects , and include some non-_swift _ grbs , the larger sample size likely does provide a fuller picture of the host luminosity distribution at higher redshifts .",
    "the @xmath172 uv luminosities of tough vii @xcite , @xcite and @xcite are plotted in figure  [ fig:5 ] together with our new hosts . to ensure that the samples of tough vii and @xcite are comparable , we re - analyzed the latter sample using the methodology of tough vii @xcite .",
    "we also plot @xmath145 as a function of redshift . at low redshifts ( @xmath173 )",
    "the bulk of hosts are sub-@xmath143 , as expected if grbs trace primarily sub - solar metallicity star formation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . from @xmath174",
    "to @xmath12 the break of the luminosity function evolves rather little . while some hosts are found with @xmath175 up to @xmath176 , at higher redshifts such bright hosts",
    "are absent , consistent with a steepening galaxy luminosity function ( c.f .",
    "* ) , with star formation predominantly occurring in faint galaxies .",
    "we have presented deep ( @xmath177 ) _ hst_/f140w observations of the fields of grbs 130606a , 050904 , and 140515a and have identified galaxies coincident with each grb afterglow location . based on low ( @xmath7 ) chance of coincidence of low-@xmath25 interlopers ,",
    "we conclude that these are very likely the grb host galaxies . at @xmath12 , these are the most distant grb host galaxies detected to date .",
    "it is significant that we are now detecting grb hosts at the end of the era of reionization ( a fuller statistical analysis of the high - z grb hosts , including non - detections , will be presented in a future paper , in which we will address their implications for the galaxy luminosity function at @xmath28 ) .    with rest - frame uv ( @xmath178 ) luminosities in the range of @xmath9 , and half - light radii of @xmath11 ,",
    "our three host grb galaxies are consistent with those found from deep _ hst _ studies of lbgs in the same redshift range .",
    "we find that the grbs themselves are located within the rest - frame uv light of their hosts , as is usually the case for grbs at lower redshifts @xcite .",
    "the power of grb selection is that spectroscopy of the afterglows can provide detailed information about the gas and dust properties of the hosts . in this instance , it tells us that all three galaxies have low metallicity ( @xmath13\\la-1 $ ] ) and low dust extinction ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "these galaxies are considerably brighter than the upper limits for the five @xmath179 hosts ( excluding grb 050904 itself ) reported by @xcite .",
    "of course , these studies remain limited to relatively small samples , but it would have been surprising had our new program not begun to make some detections , given that canonical lfs suggest that @xmath180 of star formation at @xmath12 should be occurring in galaxies brighter than @xmath181 @xcite .",
    "the small sample size also precludes assessing whether there are any correlations between the properties of the hosts in emission and their properties derived from the afterglows , although it is interesting to note that grb 140515a , whose afterglow revealed a low foreground gas column , is also the faintest of the three hosts and the one where the burst occurred at the greatest offset from the host centre .",
    "significantly , as illustrated in figure  [ fig:4 ] , we would expect _ james webb space telescope _",
    "spectroscopy to provide high signal - to - noise measurements of the rest - frame optical emission lines for potentially all three hosts , especially grb 130606a .",
    "this will allow comparison of emission - line metallicity and extinction diagnostics with the detailed values obtained from the afterglows , which are potentially important for testing the applicability of these diagnostics to this redshift regime .",

    "for our analysis it is important to establish the locations at which the grbs occurred on our _ hst_/wfc3 images , at least well enough to give confidence in the identification of the hosts . to achieve this we made use of observations made shortly after the grb events , on which the afterglows were detected , and calculated the transformation between these images and the _ hst _ frames using a number of field sources .",
    "the precision with which this can be achieved depends on a number of factors , in particular the detection significance of the afterglows and the number and brightness of field sources visible on the _ hst _ frames and comparison frames .",
    "the precision with which the afterglows can be centroided is then estimated by :      where @xmath183 is the photometric detection significance ( here obtained from aperture photometry ) . the error introduced by the coordinate transformation",
    "is best estimated by the object to object scatter ( the plate scale , orientation and distortion mapping should be reliable from the pipeline processing of each image , especially over the small _ hst _ fields , and we therefore only fit for a zero - point translation ) . here",

    "these wide field images are astrometrically calibrated to the two micron all - sky survey ( 2mass ) system .",
    "we made use of @xmath186 field stars which were well detected in the wfcam images and visible in the _ hst _ fields .",
    "in this case our primary astrometric comparison was with several ukirt / wfcam images taken in the @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath185 bands , which we co - added to increase the signal - to - noise .",
    "a rather higher scatter in the mapping to the _ hst _ image was noticed for stars in this field , possibly due to small proper motions during the intervening decade from the burst occurrence .",
    "we therefore utilized @xmath187 compact galaxies as well as @xmath188 stars to make the astrometric comparison .",
    "we used gemini - north gemini multi - object spectrograph ( gmos ) imaging as the astrometric comparison , utilising @xmath189 stars that were also on our _ hst _ images .",
