    "the jet of 3c273 was observed with high resolution by merlin @xcite , by the hubble space telescope @xcite and chandra @xcite at the radio , optical and x - ray bands correspondingly . through this work @xmath2 km / s / mpc",
    ", so @xmath3 corresponds to @xmath4 kpc at the distance of 3c273 @xcite .",
    "in the radio band the jet indicates a cocoon structure. the intensity in the jet increases in the direction away from 3c273 . in the optical band @xmath5-jet is most narrow . within this jet knots that are",
    "location shocks occur where electrons are accelerated at relativistic speeds .",
    "shocks can arise by kelvin - helmholtz instability at the boundary between jet matter and ambient .",
    "these knots have almost identical brightness and size @xmath6 .",
    "the first knot is detected at the distance @xmath7 from the core . to indicate the knots we used notation introduced into practice by bahcall et al . @xcite .",
    "the knots a3 , in1 , in2 , ex1 might not belong to the jet because they are not detected in the radio and x - ray jet images @xcite . in the x - ray band",
    "the jet has length of @xmath8 .",
    "only two optical knots can be found in it .",
    "the remaining jet region has low constant x - ray intensity ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "the possibilities for the origin of the x - rays might be @xcite : 1 ) synchrotron emission from a second , more energetic population of electron ; 2 ) inverse compton scattering ( ic ) of photons external to the jet ; 3 ) ic of radio - optical synchrotron photons .",
    "these theories can not explain why the ratio of x - ray to radio observed intensities decreases with distance from 3c273 .",
    "but this fact can be important for study of the jet conditions . and so , in our work it is mostly crucial .",
    "the most plausible mechanism of x - ray emission is ic .",
    "the observed intensity distribution was taken from work @xcite .",
    "it shows that two x - ray intensity peaks correspond to the nearest to the quasar optical knots , a1 and b1 .",
    "then this intensity decreases to a lower level but it is still detectable until it reaches the terminating optical knot .",
    "while in the optical band the knots have almost identical intensities .",
    "thus , the idea of explaining the x - ray intensity distribution observed along the jet of 3c273 is the following @xcite . in different jet regions scattering photons have different origin . for the nearest to the quasar jet region",
    "there is a heterogeneous radiation field .",
    "while for the remaining jet the homogeneous radiation field predominates . in this case , x - ray emission of the two nearest knots originates from ic of quasar photons . for the remaining knots x - rays arise from the same scattering of cosmic microwave background photons .",
    "thus , the basic term was formulated ( [ eq1 ] ) : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the energy density of quasar emission , @xmath11 is the energy density of cosmic microwave background , @xmath12 is the project distance from the quasar in arcseconds , @xmath13 was taken because after this distance from 3c273 the x - ray emission have almost constant value ( see fig.1 ) .    using the energy densities ,",
    "the integral values can be considered .",
    "the observed intensity decline from the knot a1 to knot b1 might be due to the fact that the ratio of electron concentration in these knots is @xmath14 .",
    "electron concentration in remaining knots does not change .",
    "taking into account that the x - ray intensity can be defined , as : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the physical distance from the quasar , and knowing the energy density of the cosmic microwave background @xmath11 and the ratios of observed intensities at jet knots , @xmath17 , hence , the energy density of quasar emission at the knot a1 was found : @xmath18 the distance @xmath16 from the knot a1 to 3c273 being known , the quasar luminosity @xmath19 has been obtained @xmath20 .",
    "it is consistent with the observed one .",
    "hence , this assumption is believable .",
    "jets enclose the thermal plasma that provides the main contribution to the jet mass . but",
    "due to its low concentration it can not be detected directly .",
    "the collisions between particles of the thermal plasma can provoke absorption of the emission .",
    "the absorption coefficient is @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the the plasma frequency , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the concentration and the charge of electrons , @xmath25 is the effective collision frequency .    in this case",
    "the energy density of quasar emission is : @xmath26,\\ ] ] where @xmath27 is the project distance from the quasar to jet begining , @xmath28 is the project distance from the quasar , @xmath29 is the the angle between jet axis and line of sight .",
    "if the absorption of the quasar emission in the jet does not exist , then the basic term ( [ eq1 ] ) is true for @xmath30 .",
    "taking into account that the jet electrons have a lorenz factor of @xmath31 , only the photons having the frequency @xmath32hz before scattering can fall into the chandra frequency range @xmath33hz .",
    "the estimates of the lowest temperature and biggest concentration of the thermal electrons have been made when the absorption coefficient tends to zero .",
    "we have obtained values for @xmath34 @xmath35 and @xmath36 k.    if @xmath37 , then the basic term ( [ eq1 ] ) is true when there is absorption of quasar emission along the jet .",
    "the absorption coefficient should be of the order of @xmath38 @xmath39 .",
    "using the ( [ eq1 ] ) , ( [ eq3 ] ) the inequality is : @xmath40 we found that either @xmath41 @xmath35 for @xmath42 k or @xmath43 @xmath35 for @xmath44 k. using ( [ eq2 ] ) and the expressions for energy densities of the quasar emission at the knots a1 , b1 and c1 @xmath45 @xmath46,\\ ] ] @xmath47,\\ ] ] ( where @xmath48 is the distance from 3c273 to knot a1 , @xmath49 is the distance from the knot a1 to knot b1 and the distance between knots b1 and c1(see fig.1 ) ) , the following inequalities were obtained : @xmath50 @xmath51 they mean that the energy density of quasar emission appears to predominate at the knot b1 , while the energy density of cosmic microwave background appears to predominate at the knot c1 . from these inequalities the constraint on @xmath29 value was found : @xmath52 .",
    "we have investigated the images of the jet of 3c273 in the different spectral bands to determine mechanism of x - ray emission from this jet . having supposed , that the x - ray emission from the nearest to the quasar knots a1 and b1 are produced by inverse compton scattering ( ic ) of quasar photons .",
    "the x - rays from the jet region with constant x - ray intensity are due to the same scattering of cosmic microwave background photons . assuming this the concentration and temperature of the thermal electrons in the jet of 3c273 were estimated .",
    "obtained values are consistent with theoretical ones for such objects .",
    "hence , in the such framework we can estimate not only the angle between the jet axis and the line of sight , but also the concentration and the temperature of thermal electrons in the jet of 3c273 .",
    "we can perform this by comparing jet images in the x - ray , optical and radio bands .",
