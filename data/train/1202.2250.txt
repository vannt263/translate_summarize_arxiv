    "the general thema of this paper is the following :    let @xmath1 be two real random variables , of standard gaussian distribution law .",
    "suppose that @xmath4 and @xmath5 are independent .",
    "let @xmath0 be a measurable _ non - negative _ function .",
    "then the random variable @xmath3 has a gaussian distribution law if and only if @xmath0 is constant .",
    "actually , cantelli has originally mentioned this as a question , asking whether it is possible to have a non - constant function @xmath0 , in his paper  @xcite , but later it became known as cantelli conjecture .",
    "this conjecture has been previously studied by different authors .",
    "first , tortorici  @xcite has given some restriction on the function @xmath0 to satisfy the conjecture .",
    "to do that , he has developed @xmath0 in a hermite series and has approached the solution ( via a truncation of the series ) .",
    "then , tricomi  @xcite has used analytical tools in order to describe some properties satisfied by the function @xmath0 ( through the characteristic function ) . in the same paper , he has also given a survey on this subject .",
    "later , dudley  @xcite has exposed two unsolved problems about finite - dimensional gaussian measures .",
    "one of them was cantelli conjecture .",
    "dudley said about it `` the problem seems to be a mere curiosity , but that will perhaps be unclear until it is solved '' .",
    "letac has also worked on this problem and has emphasized this question , in his exercise book with malliavin  @xcite .",
    "indeed , they have suggested an exercise , showing that the decomposition of @xmath0 with respect to the hermite polynomials , that is @xmath6 ( in the @xmath7 sense ) is such that @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 almost everywhere .",
    "finally , this striking question has been mentionned by de meyer , roynette , vallois and yor  @xcite . actually , they answered a related question , asked by tortrat .",
    "consider a standard @xmath11brownian motion , denoted by @xmath12 .",
    "can one find an a.s",
    ". bounded random variable @xmath13 , non - constant and @xmath14measurable , such that @xmath15 has a gaussian distribution law ?",
    "de meyer et al . have proved the existence of a linear standard @xmath16brownian motion @xmath12 , and a stopping time @xmath17 ( w.r.t .",
    "@xmath16 ) which is bounded by 1 , non - constant and such that @xmath18 has a gaussian distribution law .",
    "thanks to this result , they have shown that the random variable @xmath19 has a gaussian distribution law . in their example , @xmath20 is @xmath14measurable , bounded and non - constant .",
    "however , one can not write @xmath20 as a function of @xmath21 . so this construction does not contradict the cantelli conjecture .    before turning to the results of this paper",
    ", we would like to mention two problems , that turn out to be closely related to the brownian transport notion , which is an essential part of our proof : the skorokhod embedding problem and the stefan problem .",
    "the skorokhod embedding problem is the following .",
    "for a given centered probability measure @xmath22 with finite second moment and a brownian motion @xmath23 , one looks for an integrable stopping time @xmath17 such that the distribution law of @xmath18 is @xmath22 .",
    "several authors have developed different techniques to solve this problem , which has stimulated research in probability theory since the first formulation of skorokhod  @xcite .",
    "a survey has been written by oblj  @xcite on this subject .",
    "some properties of stopping times or skorokhod stopping have also been intensively studied in the 70 s and 80 s ( see for instance  @xcite ) . in this paper",
    ", we will give a solution to a somehow similar problem , and construct ( under some assumptions ) a stopping time @xmath17 which is a function of the brownian motion : @xmath24 such that @xmath25 .",
    "our problem can actually be reduced to a pde problem of the stefan type ( see for instance rubinstein  @xcite ) , as we will explain later .",
    "stefan problem is an old question , first considered in 1831 by lam and clapeyron .",
    "it is actually a free boundary problem , initially used to predict ice formation / melting . for a historical survey on the problem ,",
    "we refer the reader to vuik  @xcite",
    ".      our main result will be the following    [ t : main ] there exists a measurable non - constant function @xmath26 such that for two independent standard gaussian variables @xmath27 , the random variable @xmath3 is also gaussian .",
    "in fact , as we will see from the construction in section  [ s : construction ] , the function @xmath0 can be taken to be a `` choice '' between two continuous functions : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is a cantor set of positive lebesgue measure and @xmath30 .",
    "actually , the function @xmath0 we construct here is discontinuous .",
    "we believe that cantelli conjecture is true if we impose the continuity of the function @xmath0 , but we have no proof for that .    in the proof of theorem  [ t : main ] , there is a notion that naturally appears , the one of a new mass transport , that we name brownian transport    let @xmath31 be two probability measures , with the same mean and square integrable .",
    "we say that there exists a _",
    "brownian transport _ from @xmath32 to @xmath33 if , for a random process @xmath34 such that @xmath35 and @xmath36 ( where @xmath23 is a real brownian motion independent of @xmath32 ) , one can find a stopping time @xmath17 with finite expectation , and a function @xmath37 such that    1 .",
    "@xmath38 , 2 .",
    "a.s . @xmath39 .",
    "we say that @xmath37 is the _ stopping funtion _ of this transport .",
    "if moreover the time @xmath17 is a.s . bounded , we say that there exists a _ bounded brownian transport _ from @xmath32 to @xmath33 .",
    "its study seems highly interesting on its own ( see  [ s : b - transport]-[s : b - transport - interval ] ) .",
    "however , in this paper , we will prove only two existence theorems , and their assumptions are clearly far from being optimal : we prove the results that would suffice to conclude the proof of theorem  [ t : main ] .",
    "we point out that such a transport does not always exist .",
    "in particular , a brownian transport can not exist if the target measure @xmath33 is atomic ( unless @xmath32 has atoms at the same place ) .",
    "moreover , we can not for instance transport the uniform measure on @xmath40 $ ] to the uniform measure on @xmath41 $ ] : the variance can not be decreased by a brownian transport . the bounded brownian transport is even more restrictive : for instance , it can not create `` holes '' inside the support of the measure , a necessary condition for its existence is that supp@xmath42 supp@xmath43 .",
    "we will discuss the existence of a brownian transport later , in section  [ s : construction ] . nevertheless , to construct a counter - example to cantelli conjecture , we will consider probability measures such that a bounded brownian transport exists ( and the proof of its existence is an essential step in the construction ) .",
    "the second main result here is the following    [ thm : bt - line ] let @xmath31 be two centered probability measures , square integrable and which support is @xmath44 .",
    "suppose that , for any @xmath45 large enough , the troncated probability measures @xmath46}}{\\mu_0([-r , r])}$ ] and @xmath47}}{\\mu_1([-r , r])}$ ] satisfy :    1 .",
    "@xmath48 and @xmath49 are absolutely continuous with respective densities @xmath50 and @xmath51 , 2 .",
    "there exist @xmath52 such that for all @xmath53 , we have @xmath54 and @xmath55 , 3 .",
    "there exists @xmath56 such that for any @xmath57 $ ] , we have @xmath58 .",

    "for any @xmath59 , we have @xmath60)\\ \\mathrm{d}s>0 $ ] , 2 .   @xmath61 .",
    "then , there exists a brownian transport from @xmath32 to @xmath33 , with a possibly unbounded stopping time @xmath17 .",
    "moreover , this brownian transport is given by the first intersection time with the graph of some continuous function @xmath37 .",
    "we can actually suppose in the latter theorem that the measures @xmath31 have the same mean ( instead of being centered ) .",
    "an analogous question can be asked also for measures supported on an interval .",
    "this question , on one hand , turns out to be a bit simpler than the real line one ( due to the compactness and lack of effects at infinity ) . on the other hand ,",
    "it becomes one of the steps in our proof of theorem  [ thm : bt - line ] : the function @xmath37 is constructed as a limit of a subsequence of functions @xmath62 corresponding to a `` cut - off '' problem .",
    "the corresponding theorem is    [ thm : bt - interval ] let @xmath31 be two probability measures , with the same mean , square integrable and which support is an interval @xmath63 .",
    "suppose that they satisfy the hypotheses :    1 .",

    "@xmath71 in some inner neighborhood @xmath72 .",
    "then , there exists a bounded brownian transport from @xmath32 to @xmath33 , given by the first intersection time with the graph of some continuous function @xmath37 .",
    "the proof of these two results will be done in several steps .",
    "first , we will do some a priori estimates and transformations , answering the question `` assuming that such a transport exists , how should it look like ? '' .",
    "the understanding coming from these steps will leave us with some kind of a pde problem , of the stefan type .",
    "however we could not establish the existence theorems for this problem directly , by pde methods ( in fact , it seems to be an interesting question to us ) , we establish them via a discretization procedure : we solve an analogous discrete problem and pass to the limit as the mesh goes to 0 .",
    "this part is rather technical and is postponed to   [ s : b - transport - interval ] .",
    "some assumptions of theorems  [ thm : bt - line ] and  [ thm : bt - interval ] seem non restrictive , such as the positivity of @xmath73 inside @xmath74 for theorem  [ thm : bt - interval ] .",
    "indeed , a necessary condition is that the function @xmath75 is non - negative ( see corollary  [ l : pos - phi ] ) .",
    "though , in the case of a non - negative function @xmath75 that is not positive everywhere inside @xmath74 , one can simply split the interval @xmath74 into the intervals of positivity of @xmath75 ( see lemma  [ l : decomp - i ] ) .",
    "other assumptions , such as  , seem unavoidable in order to assure the uniform boundedness of the stopping time .",
    "indeed , otherwise , the first intersection measure of the brownian motion with the graph of an unbounded function @xmath37 , say @xmath76 , would satisfy the assumptions of the theorem .",
    "but it is very likely that it can not be obtained by means of a bounded brownian transport .",
    "finally , some assumptions ( such as the absolute continuity of @xmath32 or the lower bound for its density ) surely can be weakened .",
    "it is highly interesting to study what are the  correct assumptions \" for the existence of a brownian transport .",
    "but we are not doing it in the present work : the statement of theorem  [ thm : bt - interval ] suffices for our construction .",
    "let us indicate how the rest of the paper is organized . in section  [ s : construction ] , we present a construction of a counter - example to the cantelli conjecture , based upon the existence of a certain bounded brownian transport .    next , in section  [ s : ideas ] , we are doing some a priori estimates : assuming that a brownian transport exists , we deduce some conclusions describing it . in particular here , the function @xmath75 defined in theorem  [ thm : bt - line ] naturally appears ( and becomes one of the main objects of our consideration ) .",
    "we will also explain how it is naturally related to a pde of the stefan type . in ",
    "[ ss : ideas - line ] , using these estimates , we deduce from theorem  [ thm : bt - line ] that the brownian transport ( that we refer to in our counter - example construction ) is indeed a bounded one ( checking the behaviour of the corresponding function @xmath37 at the infinity ) .",
    "this completes the construction of our counter - example ( modulo theorem  [ thm : bt - line ] ) .",
    "in section  [ s : bt - exists ] , we are proving theorems  [ thm : bt - line ] and  [ thm : bt - interval ] .",
    "first , in ",
    "[ s : b - transport ] , considering the restriction on the intervals @xmath77 $ ] and passing to the limit , we prove the existence of a brownian transport for measures on the real line , deducing theorem  [ thm : bt - line ] from theorem  [ thm : bt - interval ] .",
    "then , in  [ s : b - transport - interval ] , by means of the discretization technique , we establish the existence of a brownian transport on an interval , proving theorem  [ thm : bt - interval ] .",
    "the first step in the proof of theorem  [ t : main ] is the following idea , close to  @xcite . consider the standard brownian motion @xmath12 , and let @xmath78 be a stopping time ( w.r.t .",
    "the standard family @xmath79 of @xmath80-algebras ) , such that @xmath81 almost surely for some constant @xmath82 .",
    "then , @xmath83 where the random variable @xmath84 is a standard gaussian variable @xmath2 and is independent from @xmath18 due to the markov property .",
    "now note that @xmath85 is a gaussian random variable , so @xmath86 compare it to what we need to prove theorem  [ t : main ] ( and hence to disprove the cantelli conjecture ) : @xmath87 this comparison immediately gives us the following conclusion :    [ p : time ] let @xmath78 be a non - constant stopping time for the standard brownian motion @xmath12 , and assume that the following holds :    1 .",
    "@xmath88 ; 2 .",
    "the law of @xmath18 is the standard gaussian law : @xmath89 ; 3 .",
    "[ i : function ] there exists a measurable function @xmath90 , such that almost surely @xmath91 .    then , the function @xmath92 provides us a counter - example to the cantelli conjecture .",
    "there is one subtlety with the property  [ i : function ] ) that we would like to emphasize .",
    "while this property _ says _ that the stopping moment @xmath17 should be equal to a function of the place @xmath18 where the process was stopped , it _ does not _ say that we should stop the process immediately once the equality @xmath93 is satisfied .",
    "moreover , for the construction in the proof of theorem  [ t : main ] , it is _ not _ true that @xmath94 .",
    "this is where the brownian transport notion naturally appears .",
    "the assumption of this proposition can be rephrased as the existence of a brownian transport from the dirac measure @xmath95 to the gaussian measure @xmath96 , with a non - constant bounded stopping time @xmath17 .",
    "in fact , the brownian transport notion will appear further in even more `` clear '' way , see problem  [ pb:1 ] below .",
    "we can now describe how the stopping time @xmath17 , satisfying the assumptions of proposition  [ p : time ] , will be constructed .",
    "we will fix a moment @xmath97 and choose in a small neighborhood of the origin a cantor set @xmath98 of positive lebesgue measure ( with some restrictions on its geometry ) , such that on this set the density of the law @xmath2 is everywhere upper bounded by the density of the law @xmath99 : @xmath100 then , at the moment @xmath101 , for any @xmath102 , we stop @xmath103 s part of all the trajectories passing through @xmath104 at this moment . to do so , one can either use a probabilistic markov time , modifying the initial probability space of the brownian motion by multiplying it by [ 0,1 ] , or note that the random variable @xmath105 has a continuous conditional distribution w.r.t .",
    "any condition @xmath106 , and hence , denoting by @xmath107 the @xmath108-quantile of the corresponding conditional distribution , we can put @xmath109 this stopping ensures that the transport time @xmath17 and the corresponding function @xmath37 are non - constant : there is something left to transport .",
    "the following problem now remains . at the moment",
    "@xmath101 , there is a conditional distribution of not yet stopped trajectories , with the density : @xmath110 where @xmath111 .",
    "now , we are left with the following problem .",
    "we want to stop these trajectories at a bounded stopping time @xmath17 , such that    1 .",
    "@xmath91 , 2 .",
    "the law of @xmath18 conditionally to @xmath112 is the restriction ( to @xmath113 ) of the standard gaussian law @xmath114 .    in other words",
    ", we are looking for a solution of the following    [ pb:1 ] find a bounded brownian transport from @xmath115 , given by  , to @xmath33 which is the conditional distribution of @xmath2 on @xmath113 .    indeed , once problem  [ pb:1 ] is solved with the bounded stopping time @xmath116 such that @xmath117 , we can take for the original problem @xmath118 where @xmath116 is evaluated on the trajectory @xmath119 .",
    "we then have @xmath120    it is important to note that , due to the choice of the  target measure \" @xmath33 , the stopping point of the process @xmath121 a.s .",
    "does not belong to @xmath29 .",
    "hence , even though in  , the function @xmath37 on @xmath29 does not coincide with @xmath122 , the equality @xmath91 still a.s .",
    "holds for the trajectories not yet stopped at time @xmath101 .",
    "actually , problem  [ pb:1 ] is a particular case of a wider question , closely related to the skorokhod embedding problem , that we state below .",
    "this question seems very interesting to us , but , at the best of our knowledge , it has not been studied until now .",

    "find a bounded brownian transport from @xmath32 to @xmath33 .",
    "it is obvious that such a brownian transport does not always exist .",
    "evidently , one has to ask @xmath123 and @xmath124 .",
    "however , these two hypotheses are clearly insufficient .",
    "we will study this question in the next section and find a stronger necessary condition , and , what is more important , a sufficient one .",
    "moreover , under this sufficient condition , the function @xmath37 can be taken to be continuous , with the moment @xmath17 being the first intersection time of the trajectory @xmath34 with the graph of @xmath37 : @xmath125 problem  [ pb:1 ] will then be deduced as a result of an application of this sufficient condition .",

    "moreover , for this cantor set , an even stronger estimate holds : @xmath134 for some universal constant @xmath108 .",
    "once such a set @xmath29 is constructed , the above arguments allow us to deduce theorem  [ t : main ] from theorem  [ t : sol - pb ] .",
    "so the task of disproving the cantelli conjecture is reduced to proving theorem  [ t : sol - pb ] .",
    "in the following , for a regular time - space function @xmath135 @xmath136 , we denote by @xmath137 its time - derivative .",

    "we wish to emphasize that the above description is absolutely unrigorous .",
    "it can not be used without proving the corresponding existence theorems that do not seem to have an obvious direct proof .",
    "so , we will prove them in section  [ s : bt - exists ] , via the discretization procedure .",
    "however , it gives an explanation why theorems  [ thm : bt - line ] and  [ thm : bt - interval ] should hold .",
    "moreover , this description can be ( for the case of an absolutely continuous measure @xmath32 ) rephrased in terms of stefan - type problem .",

    ", we could not prove the existence theorem here by pde methods ( though it would be interesting to find such a direct proof ) .",
    "however , we would like to emphasize here that the system   seems analogous to the stefan problem of melting ice ( see  @xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "even though we have not yet established the existence of the process described by the above rules , for the rest of this paragraph , we will in order to understand the ideas before passing to the technical part assume that it exists , and will study its behaviour .",
    "note that one of the questions appearing ( and that will be answered below ) is the following one : does @xmath184 vanish everywhere in finite time ? to answer this question , it is natural to consider the connected components of @xmath185 and to study their evolution .",
    "in fact , to prove theorem  [ t : sol - pb ] , we have to show that any of them disappears in a finite time .",
