    ", misunderstandings in the definition of basic properties are still matter of research and debate @xcite .",
    "for example , the choice of the most suitable stochastic calculus ( ito , stratonovich , klimontovich ) in physical applications is still matter of debate @xcite , although wong - zakai theorem @xcite and the consistency of a thermodynamic description @xcite support the stratonovich approach ( related to this debate see also @xcite ) .",
    "similarly , it is still open the issue of the most appropriate extensions of brownian motion in a relativistic framework ( different model exist , the relativistic brownian motion , the relativistic ornstein - uhlenbeck process ) possessing similar steady - state distributions ( the juttner distribution ) , but completely different dynamic properties @xcite .",
    "sometimes , controversies arise due to the fact the same diction and terminology is used to indicate qualitative different stochastic phenomenologies , and _ vice versa _ ( as we shall see in the remainder of this article ) .",
    "therefore , great attention should be posed in seeking the level of highest clarity in assumptions and definitions , distinguishing between fundamental results of general validity and phenomenologies deriving from particular models , in the strive of constructing a coherent picture of the physical reality upon stochastic models .",
    "this imperative is particularly compelling in contemporary research , at least for two classes of reasons . from one hand , experimental research at micro- and nanoscales permits to obtain accurate measurements of the trajectories of single microsized colloidal particles @xcite , and to analyze transport phenomena ( thermal problems ) at extremely short time - scales ( picosecond and attosecond physics ) @xcite . on the other hand , new advancements of non - equilibrium physics ( fluctuation - dissipation theorems far from equilibrium @xcite , stochastic thermodynamics @xcite , extended thermodynamics @xcite ) ,",
    "stimulate the research on more general stochastic processes , and their connection with non - equilibrium phenomena , capable of solving the shortcomings and limitations of the existing theories .",
    "this article deals with a class of stochastic processes , the generalized poisson - kac ( gpk , for short ) processes recently introduced in @xcite , and their basic properties .",
    "gpk processes , briefly reviewed in section [ sec_2 ] , emerge as a generalization of the stochastic model proposed by mark kac @xcite , based on poissonian fluctuations , representing the stochastic counterpart of the one - dimensional cattaneo diffusion equation with memory @xcite .",
    "poisson - kac processes solve the unpleasant feature of wiener processes , and wiener - driven langevin equation , of possessing infinite propagation velocity .    in the physical literature ,",
    "poisson - kac processes are known and studied under the dictions of `` dichotomous noise '' , `` two - level bounded noise '' , and they have been used essentially as a simple and analytically approachable model of colored noise , because of the exponential decay in time of the correlation function @xcite . although a huge literature has studied the dichotomous noise , the overwhelming majority of the existing contributions deal with one - dimensional spatial models , with the exception of @xcite and of a series of significant mathematical works by kolesnik and coworkers @xcite on two - dimensional systems and their complex statistical description .",
    "the importance of poisson - kac processes in physics goes far beyond their `` colored '' ( in the meaning of _ colored noise _ ) applications . as originally observed by gaveau et al .",
    "@xcite , and subsequently elaborated by other authors @xcite , poisson - kac processes provide a stochastic interpretation to the relativistic dirac equation for the free electron ( in the first paper @xcite , the one - dimensional dirac equation is considered ) , via analytic continuation of the temporal variable .",
    "moreover , under certain conditions , referred to as the kac limit , poisson - kac processes converge to a langevin equation driven by wiener fluctuations @xcite .",
    "these two properties , gathered together , are extremely appealing in theoretical physics ( field theories , matter - radiation interaction , fluctuation theory at micro- and nanoscales ) . on the one hand ,",
    "all the classical results of stochastic langevin theory can be recovered ( in the kac limit ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the finite propagation velocity characterizing these processes provides a key for the stochastic modeling of electromagnetic fluctuations ( zero - point energy , spontaneous emission and adsorption of radiation , etc . ) .",
    "the latter property is relevant in the development of a stochastic field theory of field - matter interactions as the fundamental mechanism of irreversibility and of the exotic properties of matter at the atomic and subatomic scale grounded on stochastic electrodynamics @xcite .",
    "there is another field in which gpk process can be conveniently used , namely _ extended thermodynamics _",
    "gpk processes provide a firm stochastic ground on the generalization of the thermodynamic formalism referred to as _ extended thermodynamics _ of non - equilibrium processes @xcite , pioneered by muller and ruggeri and subsequently elaborated by many other authors , especially jou , casas - vazquez and lebon @xcite . extended thermodynamic theories represent a highly valuable contribution in generalizing the classical theories of irreversible phenomena @xcite essentially in two main directions : ( i ) by including explicitly thermodynamic fluxes in the representation of the thermodynamic state functions in far - from - equilibrium conditions and , ( ii ) in connecting this generalization with the requirement of finite propagation velocity .",
    "nevertheless , the existing formulations of extended thermodynamics and the related transport theories still suffer some basic conceptual issues , that should be addressed and solved in order to toughen and make fully consistent the formal apparatus of these theories .",
    "the theory , originated by the grad 13-moment expansion of the boltzmann equation @xcite is essentially based , as mathematical building block , on the multidimensional cattaneo equation . in space dimensions",
    "higher than one , the cattaneo equation is not probabilistically consistent , in the meaning that there is no stochastic process for which the cattaneo equation is the evolution equation for its probability density function .",
    "this property implies in turn that the higher - dimensional cattaneo equation does not preserve non - negativity @xcite , which is highly unpleasant when this equation is applied to describe the space - time evolution of molecular concentrations , absolute temperature fields , or probability density functions , which by definition attain strictly non - negative values .",
    "recently , we have started a systematic study of poisson - kac processes and of their higher - dimensional extensions ( gpk ) with the fundamental goals just mentioned above @xcite . in developing such a research program ,",
    "one encounters some delicate issues related to the very basic properties of poisson - kac and gpk processes , that require a careful dissection in order to avoid misunderstanding and misinterpretations .",
    "one of this issues is the markovian nature of these processes .",
    "this and related issues are analyzed in the present article . in point of fact , starting from the understanding of general concepts , new formalisms and novel results are developed .",
    "this article is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec_2 ] briefly reviews gpk processes and their properties that are useful in the remainder .",
    "section [ sec_3 ] discusses their markovian nature , and from the extended markovian condition , the adjoint formalism for gpk processes is developed , tracking the analogy with the classical kolmogorov theory of forward and backward fokker - planck equations .",
    "section [ sec_4 ] discusses the emerging fractality of these processes versus their local ( short - term regularity ) , analyzing some of their implications in stochastic energetics ( section [ sec_5 ] ) .",
    "closely , related to these issues is the concept of completeness of stochastic description , addressed in section [ sec_6 ] .",
    "finally , [ sec_7 ] discussed the role of correlations in poisson - kac processes . comparing a poisson - kac dynamics with the evolution of a langevin equation driven by wiener fluctuations , possessing the same exponentially decaying correlation function , it is shown that the two model do possess radically different qualitative properties .",
    "this observation can be further elaborated in order to describe qualitatively different tunneling phenomenologies in stochastic dynamics .",
    "the classical prototype for poisson - kac processes is represented by the stochastic differential equation driven by poisson noise @xcite , that , in one - dimensional spatial systems , attains the form @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a deterministic velocity field , @xmath2 is the characteristic velocity of the stochastic fluctuations , and @xmath3 is a poisson process possessing transition rate @xmath4 .",
    "the stochastic contribution @xmath5 switches between @xmath6 and @xmath7 , and this is the reason why this model is often referred to as `` dichotomous noise '' or `` two - level noise '' @xcite .",

    "ascertained from the above analysis that the colored nature of the stochastic perturbation is not the cause of its peculiar behavior ( compactly supported stationary probability density ) , the natural question is to understand its physical - mathematical origin .",
    "the answer to this question is essentially related to the tunneling dynamics exhibited in correspondence to the critical points @xmath372 , where @xmath400 , ( @xmath373 ) , and @xmath401 , ( @xmath374 ) , vanish .",
    "consider @xmath373 , as the analysis of @xmath374 is perfectly mirror - symmetric , interchanging the forward wave with the backward one .",
    "the impossibility for the forward wave ( and consequently for the entire process ) to perform a tunneling across @xmath373 towards values of @xmath240 greater than @xmath272 is a consequence exclusively of trajectory regularity .",

    "this is the case of poisson - kac processes , and this simple argument supports the statement that trajectory regularity and the boundedness of the velocity ( corresponding to the fact that @xmath427 in eq .",
    "( [ eq7_4 ] ) admits an upper bound ) are the two conditions preventing tunneling effects .",
    "therefore , tunneling barriers , controlling e.g. the occurrence of multiple stationary invariant densities in poisson - kac model , as discussed in @xcite , are the consequence of trajectory regularity which , in turn , is implied by the finite propagation velocity of these stochastic perturbations .",
    "this observation opens up interesting observations in quantum mechanical problems : non - relativistic quantum - particles , obeying the schrdinger equation , possess completely different tunneling properties of their relativistic counterpart obeying the dirac equation ( see e.g. the klein paradox in the relativistic case ) @xcite .",
    "since the two quantum models , the non - relativistic schrdinger , and the relativistic dirac equations are related , via analytic continuation in the time variable , to wiener and poisson - kac processes , respectively , it is not surprinsing , in the light of what above discussed , their completely different tunneling behaviors , which ultimately can be predicted from their stochastic counterparts .",
    "the case of tunneling is probably the indicator of something more basic : the analogy schrdinger / wiener processes vs dirac / poisson - kac fluctuations in connection with tunneling phenomena is just the first point of attack in order to unveil the deep connections between stochastic fluctuations and quantum world at a fundamental physical level , i.e. , beyond the simple mathematical claim that a purely formal analogy exists between these processes .",
    "we hope to analyze this issue in future works .",
    "starting from the analysis of some basic properties ( markovian nature , regularity of the trajectories ) , we have derived some general results for poisson - kac and gpk processes .    the extended markovian nature and the notion of stochastic completeness",
    "can be viewed as two faces of the same coin .",
    "if information on the stochastic heat bath , perturbing the system , in retained in the statistical description , it is rather intuitive to expect that the markovian nature of the process can not be expressed as a strict markovian condition involving solely the probability density function @xmath428 , but it should be stated in an extended form using a vector - valued system of partial probability densities .",
    "this is the case of gpk processes .",
    "the description involves a finite number @xmath29 of partial probability densities , just because the underlying stochastic process ( the @xmath29-state finite poisson process ) attains solely a finite number of states . as discussed in @xcite , if this description is generalized to an infinite number of states , then the corresponding complete stochastic description of the process involves a infinite - dimensional vector of partial probabilities .",
    "the other relevant issue , thoroughly addressed in the article , is the almost everywhere regularity of the trajectories of gpk processes .",
    "the smoothness of the trajectories influences the thermodynamic formalism , as it permits to define the notion of local power ( time derivative of work ) delivered by the heat bath to the system .",
    "it influences deeply the long - term qualitative properties . in section [ sec_7 ] , this qualitative difference between a poisson - kac process and a similar process driven by colored wiener fluctuations has been connected to the compactness of the support of the unique stationary density function . using other classes of deterministic biasing fields - different from a pure elastic force -",
    "this difference can be related to striking qualitative differences , such as ergodicity - breaking and the occurrence of multiple stationary invariant densities , as discussed thoroughly in @xcite , enforcing a deterministic bias giving rise to boundary - layer polarization .    as discussed in section [ sec_7 ] ,",
    "the compactness of the stationary probability density in the poisson - kac processes is one - to - one with the tunneling capabilities of these stochastic systems which , in turn , is related essentially to trajectory regularity and not on the colored nature ( correlation properties ) of these stochastic perturbations ( which is also a by - product of trajectory regularity ) .",
    "the quantum implications of this result , especially as regards the relativistic case ( the dirac equation ) will be addressed elsewhere . in point of fact , the relativistic implications of poisson - kac and gpk process are essentially based on their trajectory regularity , i.e. , on the fact that their velocities are intrinsically bounded , which is the fundamental physical requirement imposed by the constant value of light velocity _ in vacuo_. the use of poisson - kac processes in relativistic applications will be addressed in future works .",
