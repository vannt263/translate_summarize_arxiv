    "quasi - elastic rayleigh scattering is a powerful method for studying the molecular orientational fluctuations in liquid crystals @xcite .",

    "as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite for the director aligned along @xmath9 direction , the intensity of depolarized light scattered by fluctuations of wave vector @xmath10 is given by @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the components of @xmath10 in a bend and a splay mode respectively , and @xmath14 is an external electric field .",
    "the scattering geometry was arranged such that one wave - vector mode can be probed at a time , i.e. @xmath15 for a bend mode and @xmath16 for a splay mode in eq .  ( [ intensity ] ) .",
    "however in the light scattering theory for the ferroelectric free standing liquid crystals the existence of the ionic impurities dissolved in the materials was ignored .",
    "@xcite reported the ionic impurity effect on the ferroelectric free standing film qualitatively , by analyzing the change of the 2@xmath17 wall texture due to the external electric field .",
    "the relaxation time of the impurity ion fluctuations in a thin film is given by @xcite @xmath18 where @xmath19 is conductivity , @xmath20 is the thickness of a film , @xmath21 is a wave vector , and @xmath22 is a diffusion constant . using the typical values of liquid crystals , the conduction term in eq .",

    "the space charge due to divergence of the spontaneous polarization is screened on very slow time scales by impurity ions dissolved in ferroelectric liquid crystals .",
    "similarly , slow variation in the local charge concentration due to ionic diffusion is rapidly screened by reorientation of the spontaneous polarization field , which causes reorientation of the director . in the bulk ferroelectric liquid crystals ,",
    "@xcite reported a very slow relaxation mode compared to a fast decay by autocorrelation measurements , which is consistent with diffusion times associated with ionic motions . in subsequent papers , they examined the coupling between the director distortions and impurity ion motions in a ferroelectric liquid crystal theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite .    in this paper , we study the dynamics of the ion - director coupling in free standing ferroelectric liquid crystal films in the 2d limit theoretically .",
    "we consider the limit of slow ion dynamics , and electric field quenching of the rapid orientation fluctuations , and find that the field induced change in light scattering intensity must include terms due to the quasi - static distribution of ions during the short applied field pulse . without the added terms ,",
    "the field quench technique produces invalid results .",
    "additional experiments are needed to take account of this term quantitatively .",
    "they will be reported elsewhere .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in the next section we present the free energy of the smectic film including frank elasticity , the coupling of the external electric field to the space charge , the energy associated with fluctuations in the ionic impurity concentration , and the electrostatic energy of the space and ionic charges . in sec .",
    "iii we analyze the relaxational dynamics of the coupled director and ionic degrees of freedom , and provide physical insight into the central result of this analysis using a simple spring  based model .",

    "we consider temperatures sufficiently below the sm@xmath27 transition so that the tilt angle fluctuations are small and we need only study fluctuations in the azimuthal angle @xmath28 .",

    "average alignment of the molecules is achieved by an external electric field small enough so as not to suppress the thermal fluctuations . in a bend mode of the @xmath1 director ,",
    "the divergence of the transverse dipoles gives rise to space charge .",
    "the variation of the space charge due to the azimuthal fluctuations causes diffusion of the free ions dissolved in the film .",
