    "self - trapping of light in photonic lattices optically induced in nonlinear photorefractive crystals , such as strontium barium niobate ( sbn ) has attracted a considerable amount of attention , ever since its theoretical inception @xcite and experimental realization @xcite .",
    "this is perhaps primarily because it constitutes a setting where it is very natural to consider the competing effects of nonlinearity with diffraction and to study the effects of periodic `` potentials '' on solitary waves ; here the role of the `` potential '' is played by the ordinary polarization of light forming a waveguide array in which the extra - ordinarily polarized probe beam evolves .",
    "this setting has provided a fertile ground for the experimental realization and detailed examination of many interesting concepts of nonlinear wave physics , including , for instance , the formation of discrete dipole @xcite , necklace @xcite solitons and even stripe patterns @xcite , rotary solitons @xcite , discrete vortices @xcite or the realization of photonic quasicrystals @xcite and anderson localization @xcite .",
    "it is clear from these findings that this setting can serve not only as a host for the examination of localized structures that may be usable as carriers and conduits for data transmission and processing in all - optical communication schemes ; it is also relevant as an experimentally tunable playground where numerous fundamental issues of solitons and nonlinear waves can be explored .",
    "it is interesting to mention in passing that in parallel ( and nearly concurrently ) to this direction of photorefractive crystal lattices , a number of other venues were developed in optical and atomic physics , where the interplay of nonlinearity with periodicity is important for the observed dynamics .",
    "such contexts involve on the optical end , the numerous developments on the experimental and theoretical investigation of optical waveguide arrays ; see e.g. @xcite for relevant reviews . on the atomic physics end ,",
    "the confinement of dilute alkali vapors in optical lattice potentials @xcite has similarly offered the opportunity to examine many fundamental phenomena involving spatial periodicity , including the manifestation of modulational instabilities , bloch oscillations , landau - zener tunneling and gap solitons among others ; see @xcite for a recent review .    in the present study , motivated by sbn crystals and photorefractive lattices , we focus on two - dimensional periodic , nonlinear media . in such settings ,",
    "the vast majority of studies has centered around focusing nonlinearities ; the reason for this is two - fold : on the theoretical end , the topic of focusing solitary waves is interesting due to the collapse ( and concomitant arrest by the lattice ) phenomena in the case of cubic nonlinearity @xcite . on the other hand , in the photorefractive case ,",
    "collapse is absent due to the saturable nature of the nonlinearity ; however , in the latter case , it is technically easier to work with voltages that are in the regime of focusing rather than in that of the defocusing nonlinearity ( in the latter case , sufficiently large voltage , which is tantamount to large nonlinearity , may cause damage to the crystal ) .",
    "hence , the only coherent structure that appears to be explored in the defocusing regime experimentally appears to be that of fundamental gap solitons excited in the vicinity of the edge of the first brillouin zone @xcite .",
    "more complex gap structures appear not to have been studied systematically , perhaps partially due to the above reasons . in an earlier work @xcite , motivated by the above lack of results",
    ", we considered more complicated multipole ( i.e. , dipole and quadrupole ) and vortex structures in the defocusing case for a standard discrete dynamical lattice ( namely , the discrete nonlinear schrdinger equation with cubic nonlinearity @xcite ) .",
    "this provided us with an analytically tractable and numerically accessible roadmap for the study of some of the relevant solutions . in the present work ,",
    "we employ a continuum model involving a periodic potential and a saturable nonlinearity as associated with the sbn crystals .",
    "in particular , we demonstrate both experimentally and numerically multipole ( dipoles and quadrupoles ) solitons in 2d square lattices induced with a self - defocusing nonlinearity .",
    "we numerically analyze both the existence and the stability of these structures and follow their dynamics , in the cases where we find them to be unstable .",
    "we also qualitatively compare our findings with the roadmap provided by the _",
    "model @xcite .",
    "our presentation is structured as follows . in section 2",
    ", we present our theoretical setup ( related to our experiments ) .",
    "dipole solutions with the two excited sites in adjacent wells of the periodic potential ( nearest - neighbor dipoles ) are studied in section 3 .",
    "subsequently , we do the same for next - nearest - neighbor dipoles ( excited in two diagonal sites of the square lattice ) in section 4 .",
    "section 5 addresses the case of quadrupoles , and section 6 presents our experimental results for the structures examined .",
    "finally , in section 7 , we summarize our findings , posing some interesting questions for future study .",
    "for our theoretical considerations , we use the non - dimensionalized version of the photorefractive model with the saturable nonlinearity , as developed in detail in @xcite , in the following form : @xmath1 in the above expression @xmath2 is the slowly varying amplitude of the probe beam normalized by the dark irradiance of the crystal @xmath3 , and @xmath4 is a square optical lattice intensity function in units of @xmath3 . here",
    "@xmath5 is the lattice peak intensity , @xmath6 is the propagation distance ( in units of @xmath7 , @xmath8 are transverse distances ( in units of @xmath9 ) , @xmath10 is the applied dc field voltage ( in units of @xmath11 ) , @xmath12 is the lattice spacing , @xmath13 is the wavenumber of the laser in the vacuum , @xmath14 is the wavelength , @xmath15 is the refractive index along the extraordinary axis , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 is the electro - optic coefficient for the extraordinary polarization . in line with our experiment , we choose the lattice intensity @xmath18 ( in units of @xmath3 ) . a plot of the optical lattice is shown in fig .",
    "[ lattice ] , also for illustrative purposes regarding the location where our localized pulses will be `` inserted '' .",
    "in addition , we choose other physical parameters consistently with the experiment as @xmath19 thus , in this paper , one @xmath20 or @xmath21 unit corresponds to 7.96 @xmath22 m , one @xmath6 unit corresponds to 3.66 mm , and one @xmath10 unit corresponds to 12.76 v / mm in physical units . in the experiments ,",
    "the applied voltage is @xmath23v/@xmath24 mm , which gives @xmath25 in our numerical simulations .",
    "it should also be noted here that in our experimental results the diffraction length can be approximately evaluated ( for the beams widths and wavelengths that we typically used ) as being @xmath26 mm .",
    "as our crystal extends over @xmath27 mm in the z - direction , it is clear that the patterns that we observe are over a few ( roughly 4 ) diffraction lengths and hence if they are self - supported within such length scales , this will indicate that they are indeed self - trapped beams . on the other hand , as we will see in what follows ( in our numerical simulations ) , for all the configurations that we will find to be unstable , the instability development will arise typically for dimensionless propagation distances of @xmath28 . since these distances are considerably longer ( in dimensional units ) than the propagation distance in our crystal , all of the patterns presented in sections 3 - 5 below ( even the most unstable ones ) should , in principle , be experimentally observable in our setting .",
    "this is corroborated by our experimental results in section 6 .",
    "the numerical simulations are done with a uniform spatial mesh with @xmath29 and domain size @xmath30 , i.e.  @xmath31 grid points for most configurations ( see fig .",
    "[ lattice ] for a schematic of the spatial configurations ) .",
    "for some of the configurations , a larger domain was required , in which case a domain of size @xmath32 , i.e.  @xmath33 grid points , was used .",

    ", it is also relevant to summarize the results of the _ discrete _ nls defocusing model of @xcite that we will use for comparison with the findings below .",
    "these results are incorporated in table 1 , where the stability of all the possible combinations of in - phase and out - of - phase , nearest - neighbor and next - nearest - neighbor configurations is quantified in terms of their relevant eigenvalues of linearization .",
    "the configurations are dubbed unstable when they possess ( for all parameter values ) real eigenvalue pairs , whereas they are considered marginally stable , when they do not always have such pairs .",
    "however , the latter configurations typically , in this setting , possess imaginary eigenvalues with negative krein signature ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) , which practically means that if these collide with other eigenvalues , as @xmath22 is varied , complex eigenvalue quartets will emerge out of hamiltonian - hopf bifurcations @xcite , destabilizing the relevant solution .",

    "our experimental results agree with the theoretical predictions .",
    "different dipole and quadrupole configurations were realized in the experiment in a photorefractive crystal with limited propagation length , even the most unstable ones .",

    "since the framework of defocusing equations has been studied far less extensively than their focusing counterparts , it would be particularly interesting to extend the present considerations to other structures .",
