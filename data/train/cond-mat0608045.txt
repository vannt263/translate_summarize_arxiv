    "low - dimensional hole systems provide an interesting playground for engineering spin properties of charge carriers . in typical semiconductors ,",
    "quantum confinement affects the physical properties of holes much more strongly than those of electrons  @xcite .",
    "this is because subband quantisation causes an energy splitting between heavy - hole ( hh ) and light - hole ( lh ) bands , and modifies their residual coupling .",
    "the zeeman splitting of 2d hole systems for in - plane magnetic fields is a good example ; it is suppressed for hh states  @xcite but doubled for lh states  @xcite . on the most basic level , this behaviour can be understood by noting that the heavy and light - hole bands belong to a quadruplet of states having total angular momentum @xmath2 .",
    "more detailed theory  @xcite based on the luttinger description  @xcite of the valence band provides realistic values for the land @xmath1-factors of 2d holes , including the in - plane zeeman - splitting anisotropy in low - symmetry heterostructures .",
    "the competition between confinement - induced band mixing and hh - lh energy splitting also determines the physical properties of hole quantum wires  @xcite , dots  @xcite , and localised acceptor states  @xcite .",
    "recently , transport measurements in hole wires  @xcite and point contacts  @xcite have become possible , opening up new possibilities to investigate electronic and spin properties of quasi-1d hole systems .",
    "here we investigate the confinement dependence of hole @xmath1-factors in quasi-1d structures , mapping the crossover between the weakly confined 2d and symmetrically confined 1d limits .",
    "the hh and lh bands are distinguished by the quantum number @xmath3 of projection of total angular momentum along the quantisation ( @xmath4 ) axis : @xmath5 for hhs , @xmath6 for lhs .",
    "their dynamics is described by the luttinger hamiltonian  @xcite , which forms the basis for our investigation of quasi-1d hole systems . while the effect of remote bands ( split - off , conduction , etc . )",
    "may need to be included to achieve reasonable quantitative accuracy  @xcite , we do not expect it to change the qualitative features of the 2d - to-1d crossover focussed on in this work . in the following , we use atomic units ( @xmath7 ) and adhere to the hole picture for energy bands .",
    "we also find it useful to employ a universal representation  @xcite of the luttinger hamiltonian as a sum over tensor invariants where all information about band structure is contained in the luttinger parameters  @xcite @xmath8 , and coordinate - system - dependent constants @xmath9 .",
    "the most general @xmath0 valence - band hamiltonian  @xcite also includes terms describing spin splitting due to the zeeman effect or arising from bulk ( b ) and/or structural ( s ) inversion asymmetry ( ia ) .",
    "it reads @xmath10 { \\hat{\\mathbf k}}^2 -\\gamma_{\\mathrm s } \\left(\\hat{\\mathbf k } \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf j } \\right)^2 + \\gamma_\\delta\\sum_j",

    "we include the isotropic zeeman term @xmath17 with bulk - hole @xmath1-factor @xmath18 but neglect spin splitting due to ia .",
    "we consider a rectangular hard - wall confining potential @xmath19 in the @xmath20 plane , characterised by quantum - well widths @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "hence we adopt the wire axis as the quantisation axis of total angular momentum . as we are interested in describing the properties of hole point contacts realised by lateral confinement in a 2d hh system  @xcite , we assume a strong confinement in @xmath23 direction and consider only the lowest orbital quantum - well bound state .",
    "results obtained in the spherical approximation ( i.e. , for @xmath24 ) serve to illustrate that the crossover between the 2d and symmetrically confined 1d limits ( realised for @xmath25 and @xmath26 , respectively ) is concomitant with a monotonous change from hh to lh character for the lowest quasi-1d subbands . as recent hole point contacts  @xcite were realised in quantum wells grown in the low - symmetry [ 113 ] direction , we also present results for quasi-1d hole states calculated from the full luttinger hamiltonian , including axial and cubic corrections .",
    "in the spherical approximation for the kinetic energy , the hamiltonian for a hole quantum wire can be written as @xmath27 .",
    "these terms correspond to quantised 1d bound - state energies ( sb ) , a coupling between heavy and light holes arising from asymmetric 1d confinement ( hl ) , the quadratic energy dispersion for hole motion along the wire ( 1d ) , and a term that accounts for additional inter - subband mixing between heavy and light holes ( mix ) . introducing total - angular - momentum ladder operators @xmath28 ,",

    "as we are only interested in hole - wire subbands at energies well below the 2d lh subband edge , we can neglect the hh - lh mixing between different quantised levels , in particular also those arising from @xmath34 .",

    "land @xmath1-factors for fields parallel to the @xmath46 directions can be extracted from the corresponding zeeman spin splittings .",
    "we focus here on the states at quasi-1d subband edges , i.e. , for @xmath47 .",
    "it turns out that the @xmath1-factors are only functions of the subband energy , i.e. , have no explicit dependence on the wire s aspect ratio and quasi-1d - level quantum number . hence , within the spherical approximation , the hole @xmath1-factor is the same for all quasi-1d subbands when they pass the fermi energy in a point contact .",
    "we show corresponding values in figure  [ fig:2 ] . again",
    ", space limitations prevent us from giving analytical results .",
    "the simple spherical model discussed in the previous section captures the qualitative 2d - to-1d crossover expected in a hole qpc .",
    "however , for a proper quantitative description of the zeeman splitting , we need to include axial and cubic terms as well . for example",
    ", cubic terms are providing the leading contribution to the @xmath1-factor for in - plane field directions in 2d hh systems  @xcite and , hence , can also be expected to be dominant for wide hole wires .",
    "hence , the dependence of @xmath1-factors on wire width will be strongly influenced by the axial and cubic parts .",
    "as before , we find the hole @xmath1-factors by diagonalising the sum of the luttinger hamiltonian ( now including axial and cubic terms ) with confinement and the zeeman term , again neglecting hh - lh coupling between different quantised orbital levels .",
    "our results for a quantum - wire geometry realised in recent experiment  @xcite are shown in figure  [ fig:3 ] . with cubic corrections",
    "included , the @xmath1-factors obtained for in - plane magnetic - field directions in the 2d limit ( @xmath25 ) are finite .",
    "their values agree quite well with those given previously  @xcite , even though our approach neglects hh - lh mixing between different quantised 1d orbital levels and , hence , could have been rather bad for describing the 2d limit .",
    "most interestingly , though , we find that the in - plane @xmath1-factor anisotropy changes character during the 2d - to-1d crossover .",
    "the crossing of the dashed and dotted curves in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] indicates that the confinement - induced hh - lh mixing eventually results in a larger zeeman splitting for in - plane fields perpendicular to the hole wire as compared with fields parallel to the wire , effectively reversing the situation encountered in the 2d limit .",
    "we calculated quasi-1d subbands and @xmath1-factors for laterally confined 2d hh systems .",
    "confinement - induced band mixing causes a strongly wire - width - dependent zeeman splitting .",
    "future work needs to consider the effect of a nonuniform lateral confinement and address many - body effects .",
