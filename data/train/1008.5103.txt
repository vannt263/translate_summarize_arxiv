    "<S> we show a detailed investigation of the split kondo effect in a carbon nanotube quantum dot with multiple gate electrodes . </S>",
    "<S> two conductance peaks , observed at finite bias in nonlinear transport measurements are found to approach each other for increasing magnetic field , to result in a recovered zero - bias kondo resonance at finite magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> surprisingly , in the same charge state , but under different gate - configurations , the splitting does not disappear for any value of the magnetic field , but we observe an avoided crossing . we think that our observations can be understood in terms of a two - impurity kondo effect with two spins coupled antiferromagnetically </S>",
    "<S> . the exchange coupling between the two spins can be influenced by a local gate , and the non - recovery of the kondo resonance for certain gate configurations is explained by the existence of a small antisymmetric contribution to the exchange interaction between the two spins .    the kondo effect , </S>",
    "<S> the screening of a localized magnetic impurity by a surrounding fermi gas , is one of the most prominent examples of correlated electron systems @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the observation of the kondo effect in quantum dots has sparked renewed interest in the exploration of this correlation effect , as quantum dots are highly tunable , and a lot of different parameter regimes of a kondo state can be realized @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> single - wall carbon nanotubes can be used for the production of quantum dot devices , and allow for the study of the kondo effect , as they usually show a strong confinement potential , a fact that leads to a large kondo energy scale @xmath0 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> carbon nanotubes can moreover be contacted by superconducting @xcite and ferromagnetic @xcite electrodes , and therefore allow the production of hybrid devices incorporating non - normal metal contacts . </S>",
    "<S> one aspect in which carbon nanotube quantum dots are less versatile than e. g. lateral quantum dots , that are also widely used to study the kondo effect , is the control over the contact transparencies and their asymmetry , two key parameters for the kondo effect . </S>",
    "<S> the total transparency is usually given after production of a cnt quantum dot , and can only be changed in a small range by driving the backgate over a large voltage . </S>",
    "<S> the contact asymmetry can vary slightly between different charge states @xcite , but up to now can not be controlled systematically .    here , we report on an experiment performed on a carbon nanotube quantum dot with two additional , local gate electrodes . </S>",
    "<S> the local gates , fabricated as topgates on a thin , high-@xmath1 oxide layer were placed above the interface between the metal contact and the carbon nanotube , in an attempt to localize their gating effect to the area close to the metal - nanotube interface . </S>",
    "<S> the coupling of the quantum dot to the leads is in the intermediate regime , where coulomb interactions and kondo correlations dominate the electronic transport . </S>",
    "<S> we observe a split kondo resonance , with a zero field splitting of @xmath2 120  @xmath3ev . </S>",
    "<S> as we will point out below , this observation is consistent with a two - impurity kondo effect , with two electrons coupled to each other antiferromagnetically . in this sense , </S>",
    "<S> our experimental situation is similar to previous experiments on lateral quantum dots @xcite , although in our case , the two - spin configuration is more accidental .    a device schematic together with a scanning electron micrograph of a device equivalent to the one that was measured is presented in figure [ fig1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> single - wall carbon nanotubes are grown on thermally oxidized silicon wafers by the chemical vapor deposition method . </S>",

    "<S> the aluminum contacts are superconducting below @xmath10  k , but we will in the following concentrate on electrical transport under a magnetic field @xmath11 , that is applied in the plane of the wafer , under an angle of about @xmath12 to the nanotube axis as indicated in figure [ fig1]b . </S>",

    "<S> the values of @xmath6 for which this occurs shift with @xmath16 . the slope of the resulting lines in the colorscale plot of @xmath20 in figure  [ fig2]a is not constant , however , but we observe regions where two resonances approach and the differential conductance between them increases ( dashed frames ) . </S>",
    "<S> we shall see that this can be attributed to a kondo resonance whose energy and characteristics can be tuned by @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> charge rearrangements leading to jumps in the electrostatic potential of the quantum dot can be seen as discontinuities in the colorscale plot of @xmath20 in figure  [ fig2]a . </S>",
    "<S> as these jumps occur more frequently in the present device compared to devices without topgates , we assume that they are due to trapped charge in the topgate oxide . </S>",

    "<S> in addition , a ridge of high differential conductance shows up around zero bias , which we identify as signature of the spin-@xmath25 kondo effect .    </S>",

    "<S> we show a measurement of the nonlinear conductance @xmath28 for a range of gate voltages that are indicated by the slanted dashed line in figure  [ fig2]b and that correspond to the middle of the charge state denoted as * o*. we can follow the development of the kondo feature from a zero bias peak ( @xmath29  mv ) into two peaks at finite voltage ( @xmath30  mv ) . </S>",
    "<S> the width of the peak at @xmath29  mv is of the order of @xmath31v , corresponding to a kondo temperature of about @xmath32  k.     along the slanted dashed line in figure  [ fig2]b at @xmath22  t. @xmath6 and @xmath16 are driven simultaneously so that the dot chemical potential stays constant in the middle of the charge state . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig3],width=377 ]    to gain more insight into the origin of the splitting observed in figure  [ fig3 ] , we have measured the nonlinear conductance @xmath28 as a function of magnetic field @xmath11 for three fixed gate configurations , corresponding to three different points on the dashed line in figure  [ fig2]b . in figure  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4]a , we present data for ( @xmath29  mv , @xmath33  v ) . at low field , superconductivity dominates electrical transport , preventing the appearance of the kondo effect . for @xmath34  t </S>",
    "<S> , superconductivity is suppressed , and we can follow the evolution of the two spin components of the kondo ridge in the external magnetic field . from the slope of these lines </S>",
    "<S> , we estimate @xmath35 , a value that is consistent with a free electron g - factor plus some small orbital magnetic moment contribution that could be present @xcite , as the magnetic field was applied under an angle of @xmath36 to the axis of the nanotube . </S>",
    "<S> the kondo resonance is recovered only at a finite magnetic field of @xmath37  t. note that except for a very small shift of @xmath38  t , that is probably due to flux trapping in the superconducting magnet , the data for positive and negative magnetic field are equivalent . extrapolating the high conductance lines towards @xmath39 , we find a zero field splitting of @xmath40 .    </S>",
    "<S> a qualitatively different picture evolves at two other positions in the @xmath41-plane of figure  [ fig2]b : for ( -9  mv/-0.456  v ) ( figure  [ fig4]b ) and ( -12  mv/-0.453  v ) ( figure  [ fig4]c ) , the kondo resonance is not recovered for any value of magnetic field , but instead the two high conductance lines only approach each other up to a minimum distance of about @xmath31v , giving an anti - crossing like behavior . </S>",
    "<S> note that both of these points correspond to the middle of the same charge state as the measurement in figure  [ fig4]a . extrapolating to @xmath39 gives roughly the same zero field splitting @xmath42ev , and the slope of the two high conductance lines , taken at higher magnetic fields , is the same as for the data in figure  [ fig4]a .     for different values of ( @xmath16,@xmath6 ) . </S>",
    "<S> a linear background is subtracted from the data for better visibility . </S>",
    "<S> white dots correspond to maxima in @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4],width=377 ]    at first sight our data bear a striking resemblance to data obtained on a carbon nanotube quantum dot with ferromagnetic contacts @xcite . in this experiment , </S>",
    "<S> a splitting of the kondo resonance at @xmath39 as well as its recovery at finite magnetic field could be explained with the presence of an exchange field , that is induced by the magnetization of the ferromagnetic electrodes @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> an avoided crossing similar to the one in figures  [ fig4]b / c had been observed in some samples in @xcite , and was explained with a small misalignment of the exchange field with respect to the external magnetic field , a situation which would expose the impurity spin to a finite magnetic field for all values of the external magnetic field , and therefore prevent the recovery of the kondo resonance . </S>",
    "<S> this misalignment is however given by the domain structure of the ferromagnetic electrodes , and can not be changed by gate voltages . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the existing theories for a ferromagnetic exchange field acting on a single spin in a quantum dot @xcite predict the induced exchangefield to always be parallel ( or anti - parallel ) to the magnetization of the electrodes , a misalignment of the two is not possible . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , we have not deliberately introduced any ferromagnetic parts into our sample , and therefore have to discard an explanation in terms of a ferromagnetic exchange field .    </S>",
    "<S> there have been reports of a split kondo effect in cnt quantum dots @xcite , where the coupling to a ferromagnetic catalyst particle , that is needed to synthesize the carbon nanotube @xcite , has been discussed as the origin of a ferromagnetic exchange field that could split the kondo resonance at @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> however , as the catalyst particles normally stick to the end of the nanotube ( at several @xmath3 m distance from the quantum dot ) , and are extremely small ( 1 - 2  nm , equivalent to the nanotube diameter ) , we do not think that they can account for an exchange field on the dot of the order of @xmath43  t. we believe that the nonlinear temperature dependence of the equilibrium conductance at @xmath39 reported in @xcite rather points to a two - impurity kondo effect as the origin of the observed splitting of the kondo resonance .    </S>",
    "<S> the kondo effect in the presence of two magnetic impurities has been investigated first theoretically @xcite and later experimentally @xcite . in quantum dots , </S>",
    "<S> a two - impurity kondo effect can occur in a parallel double quantum dot or in a single dot with two near - degenerate levels . </S>",
    "<S> two electrons ( impurities ) that can interact with each other via exchange interaction , and that interact independently with the fermi sea in the leads , are considered . </S>",
    "<S> depending on temperature , magnetic field , strength and sign of the inter - impurity exchange interaction , the occurrence of the kondo effect is qualitatively different from the simple spin-@xmath25 kondo effect . here </S>",
    "<S> we will consider a situation where one of the impurities is fixed , and does nt participate in transport , e. g. an electron localized in a trap state in the gate oxide close to the nanotube . </S>",
    "<S> however , it will still interact with the spin of the second impurity via some exchange interaction @xmath44 such a situation has been realized in a serial triple quantum dot device @xcite , where the two outer dots held the impurity spins , and the larger middle dot functioned as a small fermi reservoir , mediating a tunable ruderman - kittel - kasuya - yoshida ( rkky ) like exchange interaction . </S>",
    "<S> this experiment has been described theoretically in refs . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> common to both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic exchange interaction between the two impurities is a suppression of conductance at @xmath17 for zero magnetic field , which results in a split kondo resonance . to distinguish between ferro- and antiferromagnetic exchange between the two electrons </S>",
    "<S> , one has to look at the magnetic field dependence @xcite , as only for antiferromagnetic exchange ( @xmath45 ) the two peaks approach each other with increasing magnetic field , and the kondo resonance can be recovered at finite b. in case of ferromagnetic exchange ( @xmath46 ) , the magnetic field dependence of the two maxima in @xmath28 is much weaker , and a more complicated two stage kondo effect will occur at low enough temperature . in the case of @xmath45 , </S>",
    "<S> the antiferromagnetic interaction between the two unpaired spins is competing with the kondo screening , the two impurities are locked into a singlet , and the kondo effect is inactive , which leads to a suppression of conductance at @xmath17 . only for larger energies , when transition from the singlet into the lowest triplet state can take place , </S>",
    "<S> the kondo screening will be reestablished and two maxima in @xmath28 at @xmath47 will occur @xcite . as the two maxima in this case </S>",
    "<S> correspond to a singlet / triplet degeneracy point , they will change their position with magnetic field and allow for a recovery of the kondo resonance at the magnetic field induced crossing between the singlet and lowest triplet state .    with this scenario in mind , we can explain the data shown in figure  [ fig4]a . </S>",
    "<S> the observed zero - field splitting of @xmath48ev would correspond to the exchange constant between the electron spin and an additional spin , that is fixed , either in a second dot somewhere on the nanotube , or at a defect in the gate oxide close to the nanotube . </S>",
    "<S> an exchange constant @xmath49 of the order of @xmath50ev is realistic @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the approaching of the two maxima and the recovery of the kondo resonance at @xmath51  t also correspond to the theoretical prediction , and are qualitatively similar to experimental results reported previously @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the effects of a fixed impurity spin have also been investigated in two recent experiments on carbon nanotube quantum dots @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> to explain the data of figures  [ fig4]b / c in this scenario , we have to extend the inter - impurity exchange interaction by an antisymmetric , dzyaloshinskii - moriya ( dm ) type component @xmath52 @xcite , which would prevent the complete anti - parallel alignment of the two spins , having the same effect as a misaligned exchange field in a dot with ferromagnetic contacts @xcite . as the presence of a second , fixed spin , and the exchange interaction of this fixed spin with the dot spin in our sample is not well controlled and rather accidental , such a situation is imaginable . </S>",
    "<S> similar to the exchange constant @xmath49 , the vector @xmath53 is a property of the two - spin system and in the case of the dm interaction is determined by spin - orbit interaction . </S>",
    "<S> it is therefore possible that the direction and length of @xmath54 are sensitive to the electrostatic environment of the two spins , so that @xmath55 can be gate dependent . to our knowledge </S>",
    "<S> , there are no previous reports of antisymmetric exchange interactions in quantum dots , although there is some theoretical work on electronic transport through a molecular magnet that is composed of two spins with dm interaction @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this work however examines the level spectrum of the molecular magnet as observed from excited state lines in sequential tunneling through a weakly coupled quantum dot . </S>",
    "<S> a two - impurity kondo effect with spin - orbit coupled conduction electrons has been investigated in @xcite , and the kondo effect in a quantum dot with an even number of electrons in the presence of spin - orbit interaction has been investigated in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , we are however not aware of any theoretical work that corresponds to our experimental situation with an odd number of electrons on the dot and on - site spin - orbit interaction .    to support the explanation in terms of a two - impurity kondo effect , a detailed determination of the temperature dependent conductance would be desirable . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , due to the bad electrostatic stability on longer timescales , this has not been possible for the present device . </S>",
    "<S> we note , however , that the non - monotonic temperature dependence observed in @xcite corresponds to the prediction for a two - impurity kondo effect , as given e. g. in @xcite .    in conclusion , </S>",
    "<S> we have shown a split kondo effect in a carbon nanotube quantum dot with additional , locally acting gates . </S>",
    "<S> the zero - bias kondo resonance can be recovered at a finite magnetic field , a situation consistent with a two - impurity kondo effect of two spin 1/2 particles that are linked by an antiferromagnetic exchange interaction . </S>",
    "<S> a slight deformation of the dot confinement potential by one of the local gates led to a situation where the kondo resonance could no longer be recovered , but where the two high conductance lines form an anti - crossing , with a minimum distance of about @xmath31ev . we speculate that this anti - crossing might be due to the occurrence of a small antisymmetric component in the exchange interaction between the two kondo impurities , which becomes active for certain gate voltages and prevents a complete compensation of the impurity spin by the fermi sea in the leads . further experimental and theoretical work will be needed to unambiguously support this picture . </S>"
