    "the specific interaction of neutron with two or more nuclei appears from the quantum problem of scattering of a light particle on the subsystem of heavy particles  @xcite .",
    "the neutron - nucleus scattering has a lot of resonances at low energy region extending up to hundreds of @xmath0  @xcite . in the few - body system",
    "there is a more complicated resonance behavior with a distinctive feature such as the additional dependence on distances between the nuclei , i.e. on the lattice parameter - @xmath1 .",
    "the few - body resonance arises at the certain value of @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) , and disappears if the parameter @xmath1 becomes somewhat less , or , conversely , more than the resonance value .",
    "usually the neutron resonances of elastic scattering are accompanied with resonances in neutron capture channel . and",
    "the elastic and inelastic amplitudes are resonantly enhanced at the same values of the neutron energies and @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "note that the values of @xmath4 are much smaller than the size of atoms , but much larger than the size of nuclei .",
    "thus , for neutrons with energies @xmath5 100 kev , the resonances arise when @xmath6 50 fm , and for @xmath5 100 ev , @xmath6 400 fm .",
    "such distances between the nuclei can not be achieved under normal conditions .",
    "they appear only in the overdense crystalline structures of envelopes of neutron stars where mass densities are @xmath7 for outer crust , and @xmath8 for inner crust .    in the outer crust nuclei",
    "are completely stripped , and due to the energy gain of the system form an almost perfect coulomb crystal in the degenerate electron fermi gas .",
    "the pressure of degenerate electron fermi gas is opposed to the giant gravitational pressure striving to compress the matter . in the lower layers of the outer crust nuclei",
    "begin to capture electrons with emission of neutrinos .",
    "these reactions lead to the formation of neutron - rich nuclei .",
    "deeper , in the inner crust , neutron - rich nuclei start to emit free neutrons  @xcite .",
    "note that the reactions of electron capture give a lot of new nuclei not only in ground state but also in exited states .",
    "the excited nuclei interact nonlinearly between each other as the result of overlaps of their wave functions and tunneling effects .",
    "nonleniar interactions stimulate the high harmonic generation , i.e. production of photons with energies many times greater than the excitation energy of a single source  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the energetic photons emitted by group of exited nuclei are able to heat the surrounding layers and produce the neutrino - antineutrino pairs interacting with electrons , and even knock the nucleons out from other nuclei .",
    "it means that free neutrons can appear in the overdense crystal almost immediately after the beginning of electron capture reactions in the corresponding layers of neutron star envelopes .    in this case",
    "the resonance forces can change the balance of gravitational and coulomb forces , which leads to the oscillations in the local layers .",
    "it is clear that pressures created by the various forces should compensate each other , for example , the balance of gravitational and coulomb forces gives @xmath9 . denote @xmath10 as the equilibrium value of the lattice parameter in this case .",
    "note that the forces and pressures increase monotonically with the depth in the crystal structure , and the values of @xmath10 is monotonically decreasing .",
    "the resonance forces give a new relationship : @xmath11 .",
    "pressure is determined by expression  @xcite : @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the volume per one baryon , @xmath14 is the total energy density of the respective forces .",
    "the relevant effective energy can be determined with the hellmann - feynman relationship : @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the effective interaction between the lattice nuclei , @xmath17 is a neutron .",
    "then , using @xmath18 - the wave functions of a neutron in the potential well the expression can be rewritten as @xmath19 , highlighting @xmath20 - the number density of free neutrons in the local layer .    in general , to determine @xmath21 as a whole in the structure the sum of the energies of all states @xmath17 close to this resonance level must be taken . and",
    "besides , it is necessary to make summation over all other resonant levels that appear in this layer .    in turn",
    ", @xmath16 can be defined in the problem of neutron scattering on subsystem of few heavy nuclei .",
    "figure 1 shows the resonance behaviour of @xmath16 in the lattice of @xmath22 . and",
    "for @xmath23 analytical solutions can be obtained in the born - oppenheimer approximation with the neutron - nucleus @xmath24-matrices taken in the separable or breit - wigner form  @xcite , @xmath25 is a nuclide , @xmath26 - its number in the system .     for ( @xmath27)-system .",
    "the solid and dashed lines correspond to the real and imaginary parts of @xmath16 , respectively .",
    "only the two - body ( @xmath28)-resonance with energy @xmath29 and width @xmath30 is taken into account , the neutron energy @xmath31 .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ]    for the pair @xmath32-matrix : @xmath33 , relationship with the breit - wigner resonances is determined in a simple form @xmath34 ,  @xmath35 - the initial neutron energy , @xmath36 - the energy and width of neutron - nucleus resonance , and @xmath37 for @xmath38 .",
    "we use the symbolic notation @xmath39 and units @xmath40 , for simplicity .",
    "then , the effective interaction between the nuclei is : @xmath41 where @xmath42 , and @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the coordinates of the scattering centers at input and output of a neutron from the system , measured from the point of symmetry between the two nuclei .    the amplitude @xmath45 and its components @xmath46 the elements of the matrix @xmath47 , where by definition @xmath48 , and @xmath49 is the fourier transform of the born interaction in the three - body system : @xmath50 the zeros of the determinant @xmath51 in the complex plane @xmath52 correspond to resonant states of the system and @xmath53 .",
    "figure 2 shows the deviation of the equilibrium values of @xmath10 - in the absence and @xmath54 in the presence of neutron resonances in the local layers of the crystalline structure .",
    "the resulting local oscillations give reason to assume that the radiation accompanying the structural neutron resonances will also have oscillatory behavior .",
    "the value of @xmath55 is almost everywhere close to zero , and becomes significant near the @xmath56 .",
    "that is , each nuclide and each resonant level in the ( @xmath57)-subsystem correspond to a certain segment of layers , where @xmath58 and , consequently , the density @xmath59 .",
    "this is an important characteristic of the resonance strength .",
    "it is interesting that @xmath54 may appear in the region where the resonance interaction becomes vanishingly small . in this case",
    ", the balance will settle without the participation of resonance forces , and the density of local layers will tend to return to its original value : @xmath60 .",
    "however , as before , if @xmath10 comes close to @xmath61 , the resonance forces will rise again and change the balance of power , again leading to @xmath62 .",
    "this mechanism can result in local oscillations of density and generate a radiation in this area with form of the comb , which may explain the complicated microstructure of the impulses of some pulsars .",
