    "the solutions of einstein s field equations suitable for black holes as the schwarzschild- and the kerr - metric do not hold for neutron stars because those have a solid surface and are therefore oblate when rapidly rotating .",
    "the second difficulty is the possible existence of an intrinsic magnetic field .",
    "a new solution has been strongly needed including the two parameters of the kerr - metric , mass and angular momentum , and three additional ones , the mass quadrupole moment due to the oblateness of the star , the electric charge ( which is of no importance for astrophysical objects ) and the magnetic dipole moment . after more than ten years of work manko",
    "et al . found a space - time meeting all criteria .",
    "these parameters are in a mathematical sense formally independent , but in an astrophysical sense , the mass quadrupole moment is a function of the mass and the angular momentum . to find these dependencies we use numerical results found by cook et al . .",
    "they solved the general relativistic structure equations for an axisymmetric rotating star for 14 different equations of state ( eos ) and three sequences and presented certain quantities for the stars in a tabulated form for five of them . by comparing those with the analytical values we get correlations for the parameters of the new solution .",
    "this was also done by sibgatullin & sunyaev , but with another metric @xcite and only three eos with low stiffness .",
    "these authors investigated their found models in further publications ( the most recent is sibgatullin & sunyaev ) .",
    "this metric , however , did not permit the rational function representation  the reason why manko et al .",
    "continued their search for a new solution  and could not be written in a concise form which is more useful for analytical examinations .",
    "furthermore the same procedure  but in opposite order  was done for this new metric extended to all five eos and all three sequences .    with fixed parameters",
    "this new solution is highly useful to improve the models of rapidly rotating neutron stars e.g. in accretion disc calculations for which the schwarzschild- or kerr - metric are still used at this time .",
    "these introduce large errors because of their significant deviations to real neutron stars due to symmetry simplifications which are now not necessary anymore .",

    "these were computed numerically for all eos and sequences as a function of the rotation parameter @xmath52 .",
    "if @xmath60 only one point singularity arises in the origin as expected for the schwarzschild limiting case .",

    "the singularities merge again to one single ring singularity at a critical @xmath61 ( fig .",
    "[ sing_fpsns ] ) , but the data of cook et al .",

    "again the results shown apply only to non - magnetized stars . in the presence of magnetic fields",

    "the schwarzschild space - time is of course no limiting case anymore . increasing @xmath52 ,",
    "the singularities approach each other , merge at a critical rotation @xmath64  but not in the origin ",
    "( sign change of @xmath1 while @xmath63 ) and seem to change their roles ( sign change of @xmath2 ) at @xmath65 .",

    "the resulting condition is @xmath68 @xmath1 plays in this coordinate system the role of the weyl radius .",
    "the singularities are located at @xmath69 .",
    "therefore the solution hurts the `` cosmic censorship hypothesis '' .",
    "but because of the fact that all singularities are within the stellar surface this is irrelevant .",
    "the same procedure as shown in section [ fit ] was already performed  in the opposite order  by sibgatullin & sunyaev , but only with the normal sequences of eos a , eos au and eos fps and with an older analytic solution found by manko et al . which did not permit a rational function representation and could not be written in a concise form .",
    "these three eos are of lower stiffness .",
    "these authors arrived at the conclusion that it is sufficient to include only the mass quadrupole moment and no higher multipole moments  a result we could not confirm for all , especially not for the stiffest eos l and m. the fact that the accuracy is high in the case of the redshift , but much poorer in describing the radius of the marginally - stable - orbit which is more sensitive to higher multipole moments of the space - time ( see comparison to kerr in the figures ) , seems to show that higher multipole moments have to be included , especially for rapid rotation and stiffer eos , to improve the form of the exterior gravitational field of neutron stars .",
    "but until a new exterior solution is found , this new self - consistent relativistic model of rapidly rotating neutron stars , we present here , is a great improvement in comparison to the schwarzschild- and kerr - solutions sometimes used to describe also rapidly rotating stars .",
    "it is clear that a vacuum solution is not able to describe the interior of the star . for each eos",
    "the parameters have to be adjusted to match both regions .",
    "therefore this solution can not claim to be global and the presence of ( naked ) singularities which are always inside the stellar surface is irrelevant for astrophysics .",
    "however they help to interprete the exterior field as a space - time created by a configuration with two ring currents ( fig .",
    "[ ringcurrent ] ) .",
    "these mass- and angular momentum currents arise as singularities in the curvature tensor . coupled by the einstein equations to the energy - momentum - tensor of the electromagnetic fields these sources should also appear in the electric and magnetic field - distributions . because of charge neutrality the ring currents must have different rotation directions and therefore create also weak electromagnetic quadrupole fields .",
    "as discussed in section [ erg ] it seems to be common that the ergoregion is not completely enclosed by the stellar surface .",
    "the fact that it leak from the interior of the star only in the polar regions could have very interesting consequences for the acceleration of particles and propagation of light ."
