    "as it is well known , the formulation of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) on the lattice substantially contributed to the theoretical understanding of nonperturbative properties of strong interactions on the distance of the order of one fermi , like confinement of quarks or spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry , and opened way for calculation of many properties of hadrons and of the quark - gluon plasma by means of numerical simulation .",
    "this success of lattice qcd is due , among other things , to the asymptotic freedom of qcd , which provides a unique prescription how to reach the limit of continuum spacetime .",
    "this leads naturally to the question what results have been obtained by means of the lattice regularization and numerical simulation in the study of nonperturbative properties of field theories that are not asymptotically free .    in this report",
    ", i concentrate on the discussion of results obtained by our research group in aachen for abelian gauge theories .",
    "the most important example of such theories is quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) , describing interaction of a u(1 ) gauge field with charged fermions .",
    "but relevant is also electrodynamics with charged scalar field and with both such fields simultaneously .    though qed is phenomenologically the most successful field theory , until now it is not clear , what are its properties at very short distances .",
    "as qed is not asymptotically free , the running fine structure constant increases with energy scale , and according to the perturbative results diverges in the landau pole .",
    "therefore , qed is not defined by a perturbation series at energies comparable and larger then the position of this pole . in the case of u(1 )",
    "gauge theories with other charged fields the situation is similar to qed .",
    "what really happens around the landau pole is a nonperturbative question .",
    "it might seem to be irrelevant phenomenologically , since in qed the landau pole lies far beyond the planck scale .",
    "however , it is a very interesting question from the fundamental point of view and for the search of new gauge theories applicable to physics beyond the standard model .",
    "these reasons also motivated our choice of the so - called compact formulation of the abelian gauge theory on the lattice , as here the nonperturbative phenomena are particularly rich and analogous to nonabelian theories .",
    "lattice regularization of field theories usually uses the euclidean spacetime , which is discretized by a hypercubic lattice with the lattice constant @xmath0 , corresponding to the energy - momentum cutoff @xmath1 .",
    "derivatives of fields are replaced by differences of their values at the neighbour points @xmath2 divided by @xmath0 . in a lagrangian there",
    "arise products of fields at neighbour points of the type @xmath3 for charged fields the gauge invariance requires an insertion of the quantity @xmath4 , which under the u(1 ) gauge transformation @xmath5 transforms as @xmath6 i.e. like the parallel transporter @xmath7 in continuum . here",
    "@xmath8 is the vector potential and @xmath9 is the bare charge of the fermion field @xmath10 . for infinitesimal @xmath0",
    "one can imagine @xmath4 as being @xmath11 which gives the term proportional to @xmath8 in the covariant derivative .",
    "quantities @xmath4 , called link variables , are on the lattice the most suitable variables for the description of the gauge field , as they allow an easy construction of gauge invariant expressions like ( [ nn ] ) when @xmath0 is not infinitesimal . in difference to @xmath12 the values of @xmath4 are from the compact manifold of the u(1 ) group .",
    "this substantially simplifies the definition of the path integrals with various functions of fields @xmath13 , @xmath14 since it is not necessary to fix the gauge .",
    "formulation of abelian gauge theories on the lattice which uses for description of the gauge field the link variables @xmath4 is called compact .",
    "it is also possible to stay on the lattice with the variables @xmath15 , which results in the noncompact formulation .",
    "the difference is physically substantial at intermediate and strong coupling .",
    "the path integral ( [ pi ] ) has a form similar to a partition function of many systems in statistical mechanics , for example of spin models on the lattice .",
    "this similarity reflects the fundamental relationship between the quantum field theory and statistical physics , which makes possible the use of methods of statistical physics for a solution of nonperturbative problems in the field theory .",
    "this in particular includes the use of the renormalization group in the wilson formulation .",
    "formally the temperature is replaced in ( [ pi ] ) by the planck constant @xmath16 ( everywhere else we use units in which @xmath17 ) , which physically means substituting thermal fluctuations by quantum ones .",
    "action @xmath18 in the path integral ( [ pi ] ) is chosen mainly on the basis of the requirements of gauge invariance and of the usual form in the limit @xmath19 , @xmath20 these requirements do not determine @xmath18 on the lattice uniquely ; it is usually expected , however , that various choices of @xmath18 give the same continuum limit of the path integrals ( [ pi ] ) . in the language of the renormalization group",
    "this means the same universality class .",
    "however , sometimes it happens that different choices of @xmath18 or different values of parameters in @xmath18 lead to different continuum limits .",
    "usually the choice of @xmath18 for gauge field is based on the simplest gauge invariant product of link variables along the shortest closed paths formed by the rands @xmath21 of elementary squares ( plaquets ) on the lattice , @xmath22 real part of this product fulfills all the formal requirements on @xmath18 , and therefore the choice of @xmath18 is , as suggested by k. wilson , @xmath23 using ( [ u ] ) it is easy to verify that @xmath24 @xmath25 requirement ( [ scont ] ) is fulfilled by the choice @xmath26 so that @xmath27 in ( [ s ] ) has the physical meaning of the inverse square of the bare coupling constant .",
    "perturbative expansion holds for large @xmath27 .",
    "the remarkable property of the described lattice gauge theory is the selfinteraction of the gauge field , illustrated by the second term in the expansion ( [ sexpanded ] ) .",
    "it is a consequence of the compact formulation , which becomes relevant for @xmath28 and , as we shall see , leads to interesting and mostly still open field theoretical questions .",
    "formulation of nonabelian gauge theories is made in an analogous way , the values of the link variables taken from the compact manifolds of the corresponding gauge groups .",
    "the properties of these theories are rather simple and well understood in the whole interval @xmath29 , which is the basis of all the success of the lattice qcd .",
    "formulation of the scalar field theories on the lattice is straightforward and does not lead to substantially new insights . as for the fermions , in this overview we use the so - called staggered fermions , fully including their dynamics ( `` unquenched '' fermions ) .",
    "we can only mention that conceptual problems with lattice fermions burdened the lattice field theory for a long time . in the last years",
    ", a substantial progress has been achieved , however . in the case of qcd",
    "the main remaining problem now is the high cost of realistic calculations for quark fields .",
    "the primary issue of every lattice field theory is the procedure how to construct the limit @xmath30 for ratios of path integrals of the type ( [ pi ] ) , which are related to various physical observables .",
    "this corresponds to the removal of the cutoff and thus the return to the continuum spacetime .",
    "the procedure is a variant of the renormalization group methods .",
    "it has been formulated by wilson and is consequently nonperturbative .",
    "the most important steps are the following :    some given theory on the lattice contains parameters @xmath31 .",
    "an example is @xmath27 in the action ( [ s ] ) .",
    "multiplying by suitable powers of the lattice constant @xmath0 it is possible to define all @xmath31 dimensionless .",
    "for example , a bare mass @xmath32 of some field enters the theory only in the form @xmath33 .",
    "then the only dimensionful parameter is @xmath0 .",
    "let us imagine that for various values of the parameters @xmath31 it is possible to calculate two- and other n - point functions , which allow to determine masses and other observables .",
    "for dimensional reasons these observables must be proportional to some powers of @xmath0 .",
    "for example masses have the form @xmath34 where @xmath35 are dimensionless numbers depending on @xmath31 . in statistical mechanics these @xmath35",
    "are called correlation lengths , as they determine the asymptotic exponential decay of two - point functions with the distance @xmath36 between both points expressed in units of @xmath0 , @xmath37 by inserting into this relation @xmath35 obtained from eq .",
    "( [ mass ] ) , we obtain the typical asymptotic behaviour of the field theoretic propagator of a particle of the mass @xmath38 .    it is clear from eq .",
    "( [ mass ] ) that if the mass @xmath38 should have a sensible finite value in the limit @xmath30 , it is necessary to assure that @xmath39 this means that the value of @xmath0 decreases when the parameters @xmath31 are tuned to some critical point .",
    "thus the fundamental requirement for the construction of a continuum limit is the existence of a continuous phase transition , i.e. of a transition of second or higher order , for some critical values @xmath40 .",
    "phase transitions of first order do not possess a divergence of the type ( [ xi ] ) .",
    "next important condition for renormalizability is the validity of a scaling behaviour when the parameters approach the critical point @xmath41 , @xmath42 correlation lengths in statistical physics , and thus masses in lattice field theories , usually have the scaling behaviour of the type @xmath43 or if @xmath44 , @xmath45 here we assume for simplicity that it is sufficient to tune one parameter @xmath46 . if one of the sets of relations ( [ scalpot ] ) , ( [ scalexp ] ) holds , it is possible to perform the limit ( [ kkc ] ) for masses with the result @xmath47 in this way the ratios between the masses are determinded .",
    "assuming some value in gev for some mass @xmath48 ( taken for example from the experiment ) , we obtain a prediction for the other masses in gev in the continuum limit .",
    "in addition , we gain the information about the size of the lattice constant @xmath0 in physical units ( gev)@xmath49 in the vicinity of the critical point . in the case",
    "( [ scalpot ] ) it is @xmath50 this is a very important information , as practical calculations , both numerical and analytical , can not be performed directly at the critical point , but only in its vicinity .",
    "other physical quantities , like coupling constants and condensates , are treated in a similar way .    in the case of lattice",
    "qcd the situation is , due to the asymptotic freedom , clear and quite simple : the critical point is at @xmath51 , and the scaling behaviour of the type ( [ scalexp ] ) holds , with a known value of the coefficient @xmath52 . with these certitudes",
    "it is possible in the lattice qcd to extrapolate various quantities into the limit @xmath30 quite reliably even if the used sizes of @xmath0 are not very small .",
    "in the case of the abelian lattice gauge theories the situation is much more complicated . for large values of @xmath27 , which according to the relation ( [ beta ] ) correspond to small values of the bare charge @xmath9 , these theories ( in four - dimensional spacetime ) have properties known from the perturbative expansion in qed .",
    "for example the gauge ( photon ) field is massless , static charges act on each other by the coulomb force , and also higher order results hold .",
    "this is satisfactory , but at the same time it means that here the problem of the landau pole remains the same as in continuum .    for small values of @xmath27 ,",
    "the properties of these theories are quite different from those at large @xmath27 . using standard methods of statistical physics , in particular the expansion in powers of @xmath27 , usually called the strong coupling or high temperature expansion ,",
    "a lot of surprising results can be derived .",
    "gauge field is massive and forms states called gauge balls , similar to the glueballs in qcd .",
    "its configurations exhibit frequently properties of magnetic monopoles . electric charges , if they are not screened , act on each other by forces that are independent on the distance , which means that the confinement takes place .",
    "the vacuum has a complex structure , as it contains a condensate of the monopoles .",
    "this explains the confinement as a dual meissner effect from superconductivity .",
    "if charged fermions are present , the vacuum also contains a fermion condensate .",
    "if the bare fermion mass is zero , the corrresponding chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken , fermions acquire mass , and a massless pseudoscalar goldstone boson is present .",
    "it is an example of a dynamical symmetry breaking , i.e. without help of a higgs field .",
    "the conclusion is , that compact abelian gauge theories on the lattice have ( at least ) two phases with very different properties . for large @xmath27 , it is the couplomb phase , where everything we have ever thought about abelian theories holds . for small @xmath27",
    "it is the phase with confinement and other properties resembling in many aspects qcd .",
    "both phases are separated by a phase transition expected in the region in which both expansions cease to be applicable , i.e. at @xmath53 its existence follows from the fact that it is not possible to connect analytically phases which are so different .    the crucial question concerning",
    "the confinement phase is , whether its properties are only an artefact of the lattice regularization or whether it is possible to construct here a continuum limit preserving these properties .",
    "the second case would mean the existence of a continuum abelian gauge theory , defined by this limit , which has not yet been formulated as a lagrangian theory directly in continuum .",
    "from the point of view of quantum field theory this is a very interesting possibility .    as follows from the considerations in the preceeding chapter , for such a construction we need a critical point .",
    "the just described phase transition between the confinement and coulomb phases is an obvious candidate , and it is thus necessary to assess its properties .",
    "however , this phase transition is outside the region of reliability of analytic methods which are available .",
    "its position ( [ betac ] ) is just `` between '' these regions and its study is reserved for numerical methods . by means of these methods",
    "it is easy to verify its existence and to determine its position ( in agreement with the expectation ( [ betac ] ) ) .",
    "but it is very difficult ( for reasons well known to statistical physicists ) to decide whether it is a continuous phase transition or a `` weak '' first order transition .",
    "results of numerical simulations are not conclusive .",
    "many our results suggest second order [ 1 - 6 ] , and some of them we shall see in a moment , but the question remains open .    in the cases of the pure gauge field or with a charged fermion field",
    ", no other phase transition is available .",
    "this means that it is still not clear whether the confinement phase exists in these theories in the continuum limit .",
    "unanswered remains also the question of the landau pole in qed .",
    "its study on the lattice has to be performed in the coulomb phase , where an approach to the landau pole corresponds to the approach to @xmath54 . here",
    "the perturbative approach cesses to be valid .",
    "should the transition be of second order , and if in addition certain scaling behaviour holds , it would imply that actually qed does not have a landau pole . in my opinion , all attempts to clarify the situation in numerical simulations do not yet allow a reliable statement about the short distance properties of qed .",
    "do there exist abelian lattice gauge theories with some further phase transitions ?",
    "one new possibility arises in the theory with a charged scalar field .",
    "this is the scalar qed including a selfcoupling of the scalar field , i.e. the u(1 ) higgs model .",
    "this model has in a broad interval of @xmath27 also the higgs phase transition .",
    "several research groups , including ours , investigated whether it is not possible to construct also a continuum limit different from that which agrees with the perturbation theory .",
    "if this were so , it would substantially influence our understanding of the higgs mechanism .",
    "these nonperturbative studies confirmed quite reliably that the perturbative understanding of the higgs mechanism is sufficient .",
    "this means , in particular , that there exists an upper energy bound for the validity of the elecroweak sector of the standard model .",
    "this bound has been calculated both perturbatively and numerically and decreases with the growing higgs boson mass .",
    "unexpected and interesting nonperturbative results have been obtained in the abelian lattice gauge theory containing simultaneously fermion and scalar fields of the same charge , called @xmath55@xmath56 model [ 7 - 10 ] . in the confinement phase with dynamically broken chiral symmetry the scalar field",
    "does not condensate ( thus it is not a higgs field in this phase ! ) , but suppresses the chiral condensate , the more the lighter it is .",
    "( for experts : imagine qcd with an additional scalar `` quark '' . ) for certain values of the parameters of the theory chiral symmetry gets restored through a phase transition . for small values of @xmath27",
    "this new phase transition is doubtlessly of second order , and thus it is possible to consider the continuum limit here .",
    "we have studied this phase transition in the @xmath55@xmath56 model with considerable effort .",
    "one of the numerical results , expected on the basis of the strong coupling expansion in powers of @xmath27 , is that , for @xmath57 , this transition belongs to the same universality class as the nambu  jona - lasinio ( njl ) model of the four - fermion interaction . here",
    "the @xmath55@xmath56 model is practically equivalent to this well known model , accessible to analytical studies by means of the schwinger - dyson equations .",
    "we have found , however , that at @xmath58 ( again so far away that the strong coupling expansion is not applicable ) there exists a particular type of phase transition , the so - called tricritical point .",
    "here it is possible to construct a continuum limit which is essentially different from the njl model .",
    "it is a new type ( universality class ) of dynamical chiral symmetry breaking and mass generation , not yet predicted by any analytic method .",
    "we shall describe it in more detail later .",
    "since this model is interesting from the general point of view of quantum field theory , we have investigated it also in other spacetime dimensions . in two dimensions @xcite",
    "the @xmath55@xmath59 model belongs to the same universality class as the popular gross - neveu model in the same dimension .",
    "this means , for example , that it is asymptotically free . in three dimensions",
    "@xcite the @xmath55@xmath60 model at small values of @xmath27 has a continuum limit belonging to the universality class of the gross - neveu model in three dimensions and is thus nonperturbatively renormalizable . for intermediate and even large values of @xmath27",
    "the properties of the @xmath55@xmath60 model remain rather mysterious .",
    "perturbative expansion does not hold . here",
    "the @xmath55@xmath60 model merits further nonperturbative investigation , in particular because it is similar to some models proposed for the high temperature superconductivity @xcite .    in the next three chapters",
    "we shall illustrate some of the described phenomena by several concrete numerical results .",
    "we shall skip all the technical details , however , as these can be easily found in the cited papers .",
    "these papers also contain references to many important works of other authors .",
    "in any quantum field theory with cutoff the choice of action is not unique because it is possible to add rather arbitrarily terms proportional to the inverse powers of this cutoff .",
    "such a nonuniqueness allows us to choose the action with some particular virtues .",
    "for example , in the case of the u(1 ) lattice gauge field instead of ( [ s ] ) one can use other periodic functions of @xmath61 with the expansion ( [ sexpanded ] ) .",
    "the choice of the periodic gaussian function ( villain action ) allows a very simple duality transformation of the gauge field , which reveals the second nature of the u(1 ) gauge field with compact link variables ( [ u ] ) : its nonperturbative properties are governed by magnetic monopoles arising as a consequence of the selfinteraction ( [ sexpanded ] ) as topologically nontrivial configurations of the gauge field .",
    "properties of these monopoles in the vicinity of the phase transition must be studied numerically @xcite .",
    "their most interesting property is the scaling behaviour . in figs .",
    "[ monoscale ] and [ condlog ] we show some numerical data and the fits using formula ( [ scalpot ] ) .",
    "similar , though not that accurate , is the scaling behaviour ( [ scalpot ] ) of several gauge balls in the confinement phase @xcite and also of some thermodynamic quantities @xcite .",
    "the observed validity of the scaling behaviour is a support for the conjecture , that in the case of the pure gauge theory it is possible to construct a continuum limit , and thus an interesting nonperturbatively defined renormalized u(1 ) gauge theory , in which the magnetic monopoles play an important role .",
    "the problem is , however , that this conjecture is based only on the numerical data , which can be obtained only in a limited interval of the correlation lengths @xmath35 .",
    "it is not possible to prove numerically the validity of the scaling behaviour in the limit ( [ xi ] ) . nor is it possible to disprove this hypothesis , since even if one succeeded to demonstrate , that for certain choice of the action the phase transition is of first order , it would not exclude that there exists another , more suitable choice , where the continuum limit really exists .",
    "these considerations illustrate the fundamental difficulty of the nonperturbative studies on the lattice of field theories which are not asymptotically free . without reliable predictions about the existence and properties of critical points",
    "they have only a suggestive character .",
    "situation analogous to the pure u(1 ) gauge theory arises also in the vicinity of @xmath54 in the lattice u(1 ) gauge theory with fermions , i.e. compact lattice qed @xcite .",
    "the difference is that because of the expensiveness of calculations with fermions the data are much less precise and presently even a mere suggestion is not yet apparent .",
    "the problem of the landau pole in qed remains open .",
    "this is so even if in the noncompact formulation of qed the existence of the landau pole should be confirmed , as the compact formulation might provide a more appropriate nonperturbative definition of qed .",
    "this u(1 ) lattice gauge theory @xcite contains simultaneously a fermion field @xmath10 and a scalar field @xmath62 of the same charge .",
    "a yukawa coupling between the fields @xmath10 and @xmath62 is absent due to the charge conservation .",
    "still , the model is quite complicated and contains several parameters .",
    "the most important are @xmath27 , given by eq .",
    "( [ beta ] ) , bare mass @xmath33 of the field @xmath10 in the units of @xmath0 , and a dimensionless parameter @xmath63 which is a monotonous function of the bare mass squared @xmath64 of the scalar field @xmath62 such that @xmath65 for @xmath66 the scalar field is negligible , whereas for larger values of @xmath67 this field condenses and substantially influences the properties of the model .",
    "the phase diagram , which we have investigated in some detail [ 7 - 9 ] , is shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : pd4d3 ] . in the plane",
    "@xmath68 the model has a global u(1)@xmath69u(1)@xmath70 chiral symmetry .",
    "many properties of the @xmath55@xmath56 model can be deduced if we imagine the model as a compact lattice qed with added field @xmath62 , or as a u(1 ) higgs model with added field @xmath10 . in the first case",
    "it is clear that similar to qed the model has , for small @xmath27 and @xmath67 in the chiral limit @xmath68 , a phase of spontaneously broken chiral symmetry , which we call nambu phase . in this phase",
    "the charges are confined . as follows from the relation ( [ kappa ] ) , @xmath64 is large positive . with increasing @xmath67 the influence of the scalar field increases as @xmath64 decreases .",
    "therefore the chiral condensate decreases , and for certain values of @xmath67 we observe a second order phase transition , indicated in fig .  [",
    "fig : pd4d3 ] by the line ne .",
    "if we start with the u(1 ) higgs model , we conclude that for any @xmath71 and sufficiently large @xmath27 there exists a higgs phase transition of the first order , indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : pd4d3 ] by the approximately horizontal surface .",
    "it is known that the higgs transition in the higgs model ends around @xmath72 with a critical point .",
    "these points for different @xmath33 form the critical lines e@xmath73e and e@xmath74e roughly in the @xmath33 direction .    by extensive numerical investigation",
    "we have found a solid evidence that these three critical lines intersect at one point e. as follows from the theory of such tricritical points in statistical physics , scaling behaviour in their vicinity is substantially different from that in the vicinity of the critical lines .",
    "this means that at the point e the model has a continuum limit which is different from that obtained on the line ne , where the njl model is obtained .",
    "the existence and properties of the point e do not yet have any analytic explanation .",
    "from the scaling behaviour indicated by the numerical studies the continuum limit constructed at the point e from the nambu phase might have the following properties @xcite :    * confinement of both charged fields @xmath10 and @xmath62 , which means that the spectrum does not contain particles belonging to these fields . *",
    "dynamical breaking of the chiral symmetry u(1)@xmath69u(1)@xmath70 and nonzero fermion condensate @xmath75 . * goldstone boson @xmath76 ( `` pion '' ) of the mass @xmath77 and a coupling constant @xmath78 .",

    "but the analogous scalar boson ( `` @xmath86 '' ) has not been observed .    if we imagine , that for example the subgroup u(1)@xmath87 of the broken chiral symmetry is gauged , then the corresponding u(1)@xmath87 chiral gauge symmetry is broken by the fermion condensate @xmath75 , and the vector boson corresponding to this gauge field is massive .",
    "this example together with the listed properties show that the @xmath55@xmath56 model has properties similar to the higgs - yukawa sector in the spontaneously broken chiral gauge theories with fermions ( like the standard model ) .",
    "the @xmath55@xmath56 model in the vicinity of the point e is thus a prototype of a possible nonperturbative alternative to the higgs - yukawa mechanism of the mass generation .",
    "its disadvantage is a great dynamical complexity : the new vectorlike u(1 ) gauge theory introduced for this purpose would have to be strongly interacting in order to induce the required dynamical breaking of the chiral symmetry .",
    "such modifications of the standard model have been considered for example in connection with the idea of top - quark condensate caused by a new strong gauge interaction .",
    "a weird property from the point of view of possible experimental distinction between both mechanisms is the fact that though our model does not have a higgs boson ( `` @xmath86 '' ) , it has a new scalar @xmath18 .",
    "however , this scalar is only weakly coupled to fermions , hopefully being thus distinguishable from the higgs boson .",
    "a model analogous to that described in the previous section , but now in three dimensions , is the @xmath55@xmath60 model @xcite . for small @xmath27",
    "its scaling behaviour is very similar to that of the gross - neveu model in three dimensions , and it is thus presumably nonperturbatively renormalizable in the same sense as that model . thus it possesses a continuum limit with two phases , one with broken symmetry , which is a certain analogue to the chiral symmetry , ( nambu phase ) , and one phase with this symmetry restored ( higgs phase ) . though these results are remarkable for a strongly coupled gauge theory , they also mean that the @xmath55@xmath60 model for small @xmath27 is nothing really new .    for intermediate and even large @xmath27",
    "the situation is different .",
    "the current status of our understanding of the @xmath55@xmath60 model in the chiral limit @xmath68 is described by fig .",
    "[ fig : pd ] .",
    "we show two possibilities for the position of the chiral phase transition for @xmath88 , as we currently can not decide which one is correct .",
    "therefore we do not know whether in the region denoted x the symmetry is broken or not .",
    "the substance of the problem is very interesting .",
    "because it concerns a region with small @xmath67 , one can neglect the scalar field nearly in the whole region x. then the question is what are the properties of compact qed@xmath60 at large @xmath27 and one would expect that these are well known .",
    "this is not the case , however , because the perturbation expansion fails to grasp important properties of that theory even for @xmath89 .",
    "already in the case of pure gauge field one finds even for arbitrarily large @xmath27 confinement of static charges by a constant force .    on the basis of analytic arguments",
    "it is expected that if @xmath90 charged fermions are added , then for small @xmath91 the chiral symmetry is broken in the whole range of @xmath27 including @xmath89 , whereas for @xmath92 the symmetry gets restored with increasing @xmath27 at some finite @xmath27 .",
    "this are properties similar to qcd@xmath56 . for qed@xmath60",
    "one expects @xmath93 .",
    "however , in calculations with @xmath94 we have found for @xmath95 an indication of a phase transition ( vertical line in fig .",
    "[ fig : pd ] ) , which would mean a substantially smaller value of @xmath96 than expected . naturally ,",
    "because of the small sizes of our lattices , we can not exclude that the condensate rapidly but analytically decreases around @xmath95 to a small but nonvanishing value .",
    "it is very difficult to distinguish numerically such a decrease from a genuine phase transition .",
    "therefore the chiral phase transition could also take place on the horizontal line in fig .",
    "[ fig : pd ] .",
    "apart from these possibilities it seems also plausible that , as in the @xmath55@xmath56 model , there is a tricritical point around @xmath97 .",
    "we have not yet started a search for it .",
    "the questions of the position of the chiral phase transition and existence of a tricritical point in the @xmath55@xmath60 model on the lattice are not merely technical , as they decide about the existence of the continuum limit and about properties of the corresponding abelian gauge theory in three dimensions , about the existence of fixed points in such a theory , etc . apart from the importance for the general quantum field theory",
    ", these properties might be relevant in connection with the high temperature superconductivity @xcite .",
    "there are models for this phenomenon based on strongly coupled gauge theory with analogies to the fields @xmath10 and @xmath62 , called spinons and holons .",
    "a better understanding of the @xmath55@xmath60 model on the lattice might contribute to a dynamical justification or rejection of such models .",
    "numerical studies of abelian lattice gauge theories indicates that new renormalized abelian gauge theories might exist , with properties quite different from abelian theories defined by means of the usual perturbative expansion . because of the coupling strength o(1 ) in such theories , confinement and dynamical breaking of both global and local symmetries at short distances would appear .",
    "a dynamical generation of particle masses , both of bosons and fermions would take place .",
    "such theories might , in principle , constitute an alternative to the higgs - yukawa mechanism .    of course , the fundamental difficulty of the numerical investigation is the inherent restriction of the results on the nonvanishing values of the lattice constant @xmath0 .",
    "the observed scaling behaviour has to be extrapolated to the limit @xmath30 without a theoretical justification of such an extrapolation .",
    "the described results thus are not conclusive but only suggestive .",
    "nevertheless , they can , as it is sometimes useful in quantum field theory , inspire new hypotheses about properties of gauge field theories which are not asymptotically free . in any case",
    ", the observed scaling behaviour can be used for a construction of effective field theories valid in a finite interval of the values of a cutoff . that this is not a small achievement is illustrated by the highly priced current theory of electroweak interactions , which is `` merely '' an effective theory , too .",
    "could such speculations about nonperturbative abelian gauge theories be relevant phenomenologically ?",
    "probably not if the higgs boson and supersymmetric particles will be confirmed experimentally , because then the further development will continue on the perturbative road according to the existing plans .",
    "however , plans sometimes do not get fulfilled .",
    "this lecture has been delivered in prague in honor of the memory of prof .",
    "v. votruba .",
    "i thank j. hoej and other organizers of this meeting for warm hospitality .",
    "i am grateful to j. hoek for discussions on the dynamical symmetry breaking and for drawing my attention to a relationship between our work and some models of high temperature superconductivity ."
