    "the main purpose of the present paper is to review a new development in studies of non - hermite operators . the review is mostly based on the work by the present author in collaboration with nelson  @xcite and the works following it  .",
    "in addition , i report a new numerical result for a non - hermitian ladder system .",
    "non - hermite operators appear frequently in dynamical systems as liouville operators .",
    "although less frequently , they also appear in the context of quantum mechanics as hamiltonian operators in the schrdinger equation .",
    "a well - known example is the optical potential , which is a complex scalar potential that effectively describes multiple scattering and absorption .",
    "a non - hermite hamiltonian can also emerge when one relates a @xmath0-dimensional classical statistical system to a @xmath1-dimensional quantum system by path - integral scheme or the suzuki - trotter transformation  @xcite . as a classic example",
    ", mccoy and wu  @xcite showed that equilibrium classical statistical mechanics of a two - dimensional asymmetric vertex model can be described by imaginary - time quantum dynamics of a non - hermitian @xmath2 spin chain . in this case , the non - hermiticity of the spin chain is originated in an external field that generates a diagonal flow of edge spins of the vertex model .",
    "the new development reviewed here resulted from introduction of _ quenched randomness _ into non - hermitian quantum systems .",
    "a delocalization phenomenon was found for an especially simple class of random non - hermite hamiltonians even in one and two dimensions .",
    "the hamiltonian contains a constant _ imaginary _ vector potential and a real _ random _ scalar potential . as the imaginary vector potential increases ,",
    "all of originally localized eigenfunctions get delocalized one by one .",
    "one of the remarkable features is that a complex eigenvalue of the hamiltonian indicates the delocalization of the corresponding eigenfunction .",
    "thus we can study the delocalization phenomenon simply by investigating the energy spectrum of the non - hermite hamiltonian .",
    "the delocalization phenomenon has a physical realization as flux - line depinning in type - ii superconductors .",
    "basic correspondence between the delocalization and the depinning is described in the next section . in section  [ spectra ] , i discuss the complex - energy spectrum of the random non - hermitian system , using numerical data for a non - hermitian anderson model .",
    "a new result for a non - hermitian ladder system is also reported .",
    "section  [ meissner ] presents an interesting application of mott s variable - range hopping to the non - hermitian quantum mechanics .",
    "non - hermite matrices with randomness have recently attracted much attention from other viewpoints as well .",
    "the spectrum of the fokker - planck operator with a random velocity field has been studied in refs .",
    "non - hermitian random matrix theory has seen great progress recently  . the present review , however , does not cover these topics .",
    "a typical hamiltonian which i treat here is @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the momentum operator , @xmath5 is a constant real vector referred to as a non - hermitian field , and @xmath6 is a random potential . a lattice version of the above hamiltonian is given by a non - hermitian anderson model on a hypercubic lattice , @xmath7,\\ ] ] where @xmath8 is the hopping amplitude , the vectors @xmath9 are the unit lattice vectors , and @xmath10 is an on - site random potential following a probability distribution @xmath11 .",
    "periodic boundary conditions are applied to wave functions in both cases .",
    "note that the non - hermitian field @xmath5 plays a role of an _ imaginary _ vector potential .    in the hermitian case @xmath12 , eqs .",
    "( [ 12020 ] ) and  ( [ 41010 ] ) are reduced to the standard hamiltonians for the anderson localization .",
    "it is widely accepted for @xmath12 that all eigenfunctions are localized in one and two dimensions .",
    "the present author and nelson recently found  @xcite that all of the localized eigenfunctions get delocalized one by one as the non - hermitian field @xmath5 is increased and that appearance of complex eigenvalues indicates the delocalization transition .",
    "as is exemplified in the study of mccoy and wu  @xcite , a non - hermite hamiltonian can have physical relevance when it is mapped to a classical statistical - mechanical system with path - integral mapping . by identifying the imaginary - time - evolution operator @xmath13 of the hamiltonian  ( [ 12020 ] ) as the transfer matrix of a classical system",
    ", we can transform  @xcite the matrix element of the time - evolution operator between the initial and final vectors , @xmath14 into the partition function of an elastic string in a @xmath0-dimensional space , @xmath15}/\\hbar}\\ ] ] with the energy of the string given by @xmath16 \\equiv\\int_{0}^{l_{\\tau}}\\d\\tau \\left [ \\frac{m}{2 } \\left(\\frac{\\d\\vec{x}}{\\d\\tau}\\right)^{2 } -\\vec{g}\\cdot\\frac{\\d\\vec{x}}{\\d\\tau } + v(\\vec{x } ) \\right].\\ ] ] the first term of the energy describes the elasticity of the string .",
    "( see appendix for details of the above transformation . )",
    "the energy  ( [ 00000 ] ) of the elastic string is re - interpretation of the imaginary - time action of the quantum particle .",
    "the imaginary - time axis @xmath17 of the quantum system is identified as an additional spatial axis of the classical system .",
    "hence the imaginary time @xmath18 becomes the system size of the classical system in the @xmath17 direction .",
    "the world line of the quantum particle , @xmath19 , is identified as a spatial configuration of the classical elastic string subject to thermal fluctuations .",
    "the temperature of the classical system is given by the planck parameter @xmath20 .",
    "the integral @xmath21 denotes the summation over all possible configurations of the world line , or the elastic string .",
    "note that the random potential does not depend on @xmath17 .",
    "hence the elastic string is put on a random washboard  potential ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the potential tries to trap the elastic string in particularly deep valleys and thereby to align the string along the @xmath17 direction . on the other hand ,",
    "the second term of the energy  ( [ 00000 ] ) , which comes from the non - hermitian field @xmath5 , tries to tilt the string away from the @xmath17 direction as is explained below .",
    "( in fact , if the random potential is not present , the energy is optimized when the string is tilted by the angle @xmath22 . )",
    "the competition between the above two effects results in a pinning - depinning transition of the string from the random washboard potential .",
    "this in turn indicates a localization - delocalization transition of the quantum particle subject to the non - hermitian field and the random potential .",
    "the reason why the non - hermitian field @xmath5 in the quantum system has the effect of tilting the elastic string may be explained in the following way .",
    "a vector potential @xmath23 generally induces a current in a quantum system because of the coupling @xmath24 in the hamiltonian .",
    "the current would be expressed by the world lines of quantum particles running diagonally in the _ real - time_-space .",
    "since the present non - hermitian field plays a role of an _ imaginary _ vector potential , it induces an _ imaginary current_. the imaginary current is expressed by tilted world lines in the _ imaginary - time_-space . hence the field @xmath5 tries to tilt the world line , or the elastic string .",
    "the situation described by eq .",
    "( [ 00000 ] ) is realized in type - ii superconductors with extended defects . in a harmonic approximation",
    ", nelson and vinokur  @xcite derived a phenomenological hamiltonian of a flux line in a superconductor with extended defects .",
    "the hamiltonian takes the form of eq .",
    "( [ 00000 ] ) with @xmath25 denoting the pinning potential due to the defects .",
    "when an electric current is applied to a pure sample of a type - ii superconductor in the mixed phase , magnetic flux lines penetrating the sample are moved by electromagnetic forces , dissipate energy , and thus destroy the superconductivity . randomly located ( but mutually parallel ) extended defects such as columnar defects ( typically created by bombardment of heavy ions ) and twin boundaries ( planer defects in the anisotropic ybco )",
    "pin the flux lines efficiently as long as the flux lines are almost parallel to the defects  @xcite . when the external magnetic field is tilted away from the defects , but its transverse component @xmath26 is still small , we may expect that the bulk part of the flux line remains pinned ( fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) ) .",
    "this is referred to as the _ transverse meissner effect _",
    "@xcite , because the system in this region exhibits perfect bulk diamagnetism in the transverse direction .",
    "when one increases the tilt angle ( fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) ) , a depinning transition occurs at a certain strength of the transverse magnetic field , namely @xmath27 .",
    "( see section  [ meissner ] for further details . )",
    "the above depinning transition can be explained in a clear - cut way in terms of delocalization in the random non - hermitian quantum mechanics  @xcite .",
    "the depinning of the flux line corresponds to delocalization of the relevant wave function of the quantum system ; see table  [ tab1 ] for other correspondence .",
    ".correspondence between the random non - hermitian system and the flux - line system . [ cols=\"<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     i first argue that a complex eigenvalue indicates a delocalized wave function .",
    "consider the imaginary - time dynamics of a wave function @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the eigenvalue of the eigenfunction @xmath30 .",
    "the above equation shows that the imaginary part of the eigenvalue , if it exists , gives rise to an oscillatory behavior of the system in the imaginary - time direction .",
    "in fact , the oscillatory behavior comes from the world line wrapping around the system as a helix ( fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) .",
    "note here that periodic boundary conditions in the space directions are imposed on the quantum system .",
    "hence a quantum particle , when it is delocalized , circulates around the system .",
    "this yields a helical flow ascending in the imaginary - time direction of the @xmath0-dimensional imaginary - time - space .",
    "the pitch of the helix corresponds to the reciprocal of the imaginary part of the energy .",
    "it follows from the above argument that a wave function of the periodic system acquires a complex eigenvalue as soon as it gets delocalized , or the corresponding flux line gets depinned and tilted . thus observing the energy spectrum of the non - hermite hamiltonian",
    "is a convenient way of investigating the flux - line depinning .",
    "# 1#2 # 1#2#1#2 # 1#2#3 next , i explain the delocalization criterion @xmath31 in table  [ tab2 ] . for this purpose ,",
    "i introduce the _ imaginary _ gauge transformation  @xcite .",
    "suppose that we obtain an eigenfunction of the hamiltonian for @xmath12 with a real energy eigenvalue : @xmath32 since the non - hermitian field @xmath5 is equivalent to an imaginary vector potential , we may be able to gauge out the field from the non - hermite hamiltonian @xmath33 . in other words ,",
    "the eigenfunction of the hamiltonian @xmath33 corresponding to @xmath34 may be given by @xmath35 and the eigenvalue @xmath36 may remain the same .",
    "the above transformation is valid only in a certain range of @xmath5 .",
    "assume that the wave function for @xmath12 is asymptotically given by @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is a constant .",
    "equation  ( [ 20 ] ) then takes the form @xmath39 this wave function is ( asymmetrically ) localized for @xmath40 . in this region",
    "the function  ( [ 30 ] ) satisfies periodic boundary conditions asymptotically in the infinite - system - size limit .",
    "hence the imaginary gauge transformation is valid for @xmath40 and eq .",
    "( [ 20 ] ) is indeed the eigenfunction of the non - hermite hamiltonian @xmath33 with the real eigenvalue @xmath36 .",
    "in fact , closer inspection of the spectrum in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] would reveal that the real eigenvalues in the wings  of the spectrum does not depend on @xmath41 .",
    "this rigidity reflects the transverse meissner effect of the corresponding flux - line system .",
    "for @xmath42 , on the other hand , the function  ( [ 30 ] ) does not satisfy periodic boundary conditions , because it blows up in the direction of @xmath5 in this region .",
    "thus eq .",
    "( [ 20 ] ) is no longer an eigenfunction of the non - hermite hamiltonian @xmath33 .",
    "it is in this region that the eigenfunction is delocalized and acquires a complex eigenvalue .",
    "( equation  ( [ 20 ] ) _ is _ an eigenfunction if we impose _ open _ boundary conditions .",
    "all the eigenvalues remain real in this case , although the eigenfunctions are nonetheless delocalized .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that the helix in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] never appears if the boundaries are open in the spatial directions . )",
    "according to the above argument , the eigenstates that belong to the bubble in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] are delocalized , while those in the wings of the real eigenvalues are localized .",
    "hence the two vertices of the bubble , @xmath43 and @xmath44 , are mobility edges .",
    "the complex energy eigenvalues appear first in the middle of the energy band because , in the one - dimensional anderson model ( @xmath45 ) , @xmath38 is the smallest for the eigenstate at @xmath46 , as exemplified below .",
    "table  [ tab2 ] provides a convenient method of estimating the inverse localization length for @xmath45 .",
    "it is deduced from the delocalization criterion that a state at a mobility edge for a value @xmath47 of the non - hermitian field has the inverse localization length @xmath48 for @xmath45 . a numerical calculation of @xmath38 by this method was presented in ref .",
    "@xcite for the one - dimensional lattice model with a box distribution . using the analytic result  ( [ 2006 ] ) , we can also calculate the inverse localization length of the lloyd model  @xcite ( the one - dimensional anderson model ( @xmath45 ) with the lorentzian random distribution ) as a function of the energy , by solving @xmath49 the solution @xmath50 reproduces the exact result obtained by hirota and ishii  @xcite and thouless  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig5 ] shows the function @xmath51 for @xmath52 .    if we apply to the system the non - hermitian field of the value , say , @xmath53 as indicated by a dotted line in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , the eigenstates below the dotted line ( @xmath54 ) get delocalized and form a bubble in the spectrum , while those above the line ( @xmath55 and @xmath56 ) remain localized and stay in the wings of the spectrum .      feinberg and zee  @xcite introduced an interesting limit of the lattice hamiltonian  ( [ 41010 ] ) in one dimension , namely the one - way model : @xmath57 in other words , they took an extremely non - hermitian limit , @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "exact calculations of the spectral curve @xmath60 and the mobility edge @xmath43 become possible for various random distributions including the box distribution , the binary distribution and even diluted randomness .",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite for details .    in figure  [ fig6",
    "] , i show a numerical result of the energy spectrum of a ladder system ,    = 0.495    ( a )    = 0.495    ( b )     + = 0.495    ( c )    = 0.495    ( d )    @xmath61    where @xmath62 and @xmath63 is the non - hermitian anderson hamiltonian for each leg of the ladder while the last term denotes hopping between the legs ; @xmath64  and @xmath65  denote a site on the first and second leg , respectively . alternatively we may regard the labels 1 and 2 as an additional degree of freedom such as spin or flavor . on the basis of the argument in the previous subsection , we can deduce from the result in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] that there are two minima of @xmath51 in the hermitian ladder system .",
    "the above numerical calculation was immediately followed by zee s analytic calculation of the spectrum for the lorentzian randomness  @xcite .",
    "just as in the one - dimensional case  ( [ 2006 ] ) , the averaged spectrum is squeezed towards the real axis as the randomness is increased .",
    "thereby we can exactly calculate @xmath51 for the ladder lloyd model .",
    "the result is simply superposition of two functions of the form  ( [ 2008 ] ) .",
    "this is consistent with the above numerical result for the box distribution .",
    "note that , except in the case of the single chain , @xmath51 thus calculated is an upper bound of what is referred to as the inverse localization length  in the context of the anderson localization  @xcite .",
    "the geometric average of the green s function is taken in defining the anderson - localization length , while the arithmetic average is taken in the above analytic calculation .",
    "( the argument that yielded table  [ tab2 ] is still valid for _ each _ realization of the random potential . )",
    "finite - size calculations of the energy spectrum of the non - hermite hamiltonian  ( [ 41010 ] ) for @xmath66  @xcite appeared to suggest the following three regions of the non - hermitian field @xmath5 .",
    "first , it is widely accepted for @xmath12 that all eigenstates of two - dimensional random systems are localized with finite localization lengths .",
    "hence , by using the imaginary gauge transformation again , we can conclude that there is a finite region of small @xmath5 where all states remain localized .",
    "this is consistent with the finite - size data  @xcite . as @xmath5 is increased , delocalized states with complex eigenvalues appear as in the one - dimensional case .",
    "for intermediate values of @xmath5 , however , the energy spectrum shows much more complicated structure than in the one - dimensional case ; see ref .",
    "@xcite for details . for larger @xmath5 ,",
    "the spectrum becomes similar to the one of the system without impurities , as was the case in @xmath67 .",
    "nelson and shnerb  @xcite suggested that the third region of @xmath5 disappears in the thermodynamic limit . for a very large @xmath5 , or a very large transverse magnetic field @xmath26",
    ", the flux line lies nearly sideways in the superconductor .",
    "when we project the flux line and the columnar defects onto a two - dimensional plane from above , the problem is approximately reduced to a string lying on a plane with point impurities .",
    "nelson and shnerb analyzed this reduced problem in terms of burger s equation with noise  @xcite ( or the kardar - parisi - zhang equation  @xcite ) and predicted a fractal geometry of the flux - line configuration .",
    "this fractality may cause the complicated energy spectrum observed in the second region of @xmath5 .",
    "the fractal geometry does not emerge until the system size becomes larger than a certain crossover length , which can explain the appearance of the third region of @xmath5 in the finite - size data  @xcite .",
    "the above theoretical prediction is consistent with numerical results in ref .",
    "@xcite , although the numerical estimate of the exponent characterizing the fractal geometry is somewhat different from the theoretical value predicted by nelson and shnerb  @xcite",
    ".    note , however , that a different conclusion may be suggested by zee s analytic calculation of the two - dimensional spectrum for the lorentzian random potential  @xcite . in the case of the lorentzian random distribution , just as in one dimension , the averaged spectrum is squeezed towards the real axis as the randomness is increased . in the process , the spectrum keeps the regular structure of the spectrum of the non - random system .",
    "one of the interesting issues in the context of the flux - line depinning is how the transverse meissner effect breaks down as the depinning point is approached from the side of the pinning phase . as is shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , the pinning breaks first near the surface .",
    "this is also observed in numerical results  @xcite .",
    "thus we can define a penetration depth @xmath68 for the transverse meissner effect as the typical thickness of the sub - surface region where the flux line is deflected from the pinning center .",
    "( note that @xmath68 is different from the penetration depth of the underlying superconductivity . )",
    "the penetration depth @xmath68 diverges with a certain exponent , as we increase @xmath26 , or @xmath5 .",
    "this divergence leads to the breakdown of the bulk pinning .",
    "the conclusion of refs .",
    "@xcite is @xmath69 where @xmath27 is the depinning field .",
    "note that the dimensionality of the superconductor is @xmath70 .",
    "since we regard the flux line as the world line of a quantum particle in the framework of the non - hermitian quantum mechanics , the deflection of the flux line is interpreted as hopping of the quantum particle from a strong impurity ( the localization center ) to weaker impurities . near the delocalization point @xmath71(@xmath72 ) , mott s argument of variable - range hopping  @xcite is readily applicable even to the non - hermitian case . minimizing a hopping matrix element near the surface leads to eq .",
    "( [ 3000 ] ) .",
    "a class of random non - hermitian quantum systems has been found to be relevant to various physical systems and to show intriguing properties . in particular , the delocalization phenomenon of the random non - hermitian system is equivalent to the depinning of a flux line in type - ii superconductors .",
    "we can investigate the delocalization just by observing the energy spectrum of the non - hermite hamiltonian .",
    "various depinning phenomena may be understood in a similar way .",
    "interesting future problems include many - band non - hermitian anderson models , detection of the fractality in the spectrum of the two - dimensional system , and generalization of the theory to the case of interacting systems .",

    ". there are various ways of formulating the path - integral mapping .",
