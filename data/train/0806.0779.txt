    "the systems under consideration in the present study consist of an array on @xmath1 independent qubits initially entangled due to a previous , arbitrary , interacting process .",
    "each qubit in the composite system is coupled to its own environment ; in this local environment formulation there is no communication and the entanglement between the subsystems can not increase because of the locality of the involved operations .",

    "the corresponding pair of kraus operators @xmath20 for each channel is given by :    @xmath21    where @xmath22 give us the bit flip , @xmath23 the phase flip , and @xmath24 the bit - phase flip .",

    "@xcite , the factor of 2 in eq .",
    "( [ bf - kraus ] ) guarantees that at @xmath25 the ignorance about the occurrence of an error is maximal , and as a consequence , the information about the state is minimum .",
    "in this section we study the decay of entanglement of maximally entangled multiqubit pure states . there exist various measures that aim to quantify and characterize different features of the multipartite entanglement phenomenon .",
    "we stress that by maximally entangled states we mean those states maximizing an appropriate entanglement measure under the requirement that entanglement is ( at least approximately ) uniformly shared among all the system s components .",
    "these states may seem easy to characterize : all their reduced density matrices must be maximally mixed .",
    "a good example of a state complying with this requirement is the 3 qubit @xmath0 state . alas , for systems with more than three qubits the @xmath0 or _ cat state _ is no longer the maximally entangled state ( at least , not in the aforementioned sense ) .",
    "the characterization and quantification of maximally entangled states for systems of @xmath26 qubits has recently been the focus of an intensive research activity @xcite .",
    "one of the most popular measures proposed to quantify such multipartite entanglement is based on the use of a bipartite measure , which is averaged over all possible bipartitions of the system .",
    "it is mathematically expressed by :    @xmath27 } \\sum_{m=1}^{[n/2 ] } e^{(m ) } , \\\\",

    "two states may , for instance , share the same value of @xmath35 and have very different values of @xmath36 .",
    "a state may even maximize @xmath35 while exhibiting very low values of @xmath36 .",
    "it is clear that all the entanglement measures @xmath29 have to be computed in order to describe the entanglement properties of a multipartite state as comprehensively as permitted by the present bi - partitions based approach .",
    "however , it is also desirable to try to characterize with one single number the `` total '' amount of entanglement associated with the state . alas",
    ", any such attempt will inevitably exhibit some degree of arbitrariness for the very fact that multipartite entanglement is a highly complex phenomenon whose description can not be `` compressed '' into a single number . in the present work we adopted the global multiqubit entanglement measure ( [ ent - measure ] ) , given by the average of the @xmath37 $ ] different @xmath29 associated with a state @xmath38 .",
    "an alternative procedure would be to compute the entanglement corresponding to each of the @xmath39 possible bipartitions and then evaluate directly their average , skipping the intermediate step of computing the quantities @xmath29 .",
    "however , this scheme implies a strong bias towards the most balanced bipartitions because they are more numerous than the unbalanced ones ( see table [ tb : eq.ncuts ] ) . we have performed numerical experiments using both the aforementioned ways of computing the global amount of entanglement of a multi - qubit state and found that the main conclusions reported in the present work are valid in both cases .",
    "we will use the negativity as our bipartite measure of entanglement because we are dealing with mixed states .",

    "our interest is focused on maximally entangled states that are able to retain during their dynamical evolution a larger amount of entanglement @xmath40 than the one kept by other states with the same initial @xmath41amount . following the robustness - definition introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite , we will refer to these states as _ robust entangled ones _ and use the notation @xmath42 for them , where @xmath1 is the number of qubits of the system .",
    "we compute the entanglement dynamics of these states under the influence of the various decoherence channels introduced in the previous section , and compare such dynamics with that of the entanglement decay of the n - qubit @xmath0 and @xmath43 states .    to find initial states @xmath44 exhibiting robust entanglement under a decoherence channel @xmath2 we use an iterative numerical search scheme akin to the well - known simulating annealing algorithm .",
    "during the search process a series of initial states @xmath45 of increasing robustness is generated ( here the word  initial \" refers to the decoherence - evolution , not to the search algorithm ) . at each step of the search process , a ( random ) new",
    "state @xmath46 slightly different from the previous one @xmath47 is generated .",
    "if the entanglement of the state @xmath48 is larger than the entanglement of @xmath49 , the new state @xmath46 is kept .",
    "otherwise , the new state is rejected and a new , tentative state is generated .",
    "this iterative process is repeated until it converges to an initial state @xmath44 maximizing the entanglement of the corresponding evolved state @xmath50 .",
    "notice that the entanglement that we are maximizing is not the entanglement of @xmath44 itself , but the entanglement of the state @xmath51 resulting from the action of the decoherence channel @xmath2 upon @xmath44 .",
    "since we use the negativity as our measure of entanglement , the quantity to be maximized is the negativity of the mixed state obtained after applying the decoherence channel @xmath2 to the initial state @xmath44 .",
    "instead of studying states @xmath44 that maximize the entanglement @xmath52 $ ] present at a later time @xmath53 , one could consider initial states @xmath44 optimizing the ratio @xmath52/e[\\rho(0)]$ ] .",
    "however , this ratio may adopt large values ( that is , values close to one ) for states with little initial ( and final ) entanglement that are not interesting as resources for quantum information processes .",
    "as a result of the above numerical search process we were able to ascertain that some of the maximally entangled multiqubit states that can be found in the literature are already robust .",
    "however , for some systems we have found new states exhibiting a higher degree of entanglement robustness than the one associated with previously known states .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ] , title=\"fig : \" ]    at this point we begin the explanation of our novel results for the highest dimensional system studied in this work , that composed of 6 qubits .",
    "we find that the robust state @xmath54 turns out to be precisely that maximally entangled state encountered by some of the authors on a previous work @xcite .",
    "no pure state of 6 qubits has been found that evolves to a mixed state with a higher amount of entanglement . in fig .",
    "[ fig_states]a one observes that for the pd channel the negativity of @xmath55 is almost a straight line , and a similar behavior is observed for the @xmath43 state .",
    "instead , @xmath0 quickly loses entanglement vis - a - vis the preceding examples . a qualitatively similar decay of entanglement is obtained in the case of the pf channel . for the bf - one ( plotted in fig . [ fig_states]b ) and also for the bpf channel , the entanglement of the @xmath0 is more robust than that for the preceding channels .",
    "it remains always higher than the one associated to @xmath43 , although lower than that of @xmath54 .",
    "finally , the depolarizing channel is the only one for which the initial entanglement seems to be the only important factor in our scenario , the entanglement - decay of all our states ( equally entangled initially ) sharing such a behavior .",
    "this means that any state belonging to the set of initially maximally entangled states , those equivalent under lu operations to @xmath54 , is robust according to the depolarizing channel .    for lower dimensional systems",
    "the overall picture resembles that of the 6 qubits case , but some particularities must be pointed out . for 5 qubit systems , the robust state @xmath56 that we find is not so good as the one for 6 qubits .",
    "its entanglement decay is just maximal for four out of the six channels under analysis .",
    "for the two channels ( bf and bpf ) for which is not maximal its entanglement becomes lower than that of other states for large @xmath8 values .",
    "the explicit form of @xmath56 is given by    @xmath57 denotes a member of the computational basis for a system of 5 qubits , which can be identified by expressing the integer @xmath58 in binary notation .",
    "for instance , @xmath59 is a short hand notation for @xmath60 .    for systems of 4 qubits ,",
    "it was proved in @xcite that a pure state exhibiting the theoretically maximum amount of entanglement ( that is , having all its marginal density matrices maximally mixed ) does not exist . in ref .",

    "this conjecture has later received support from several numerical studies @xcite .",
    "the entanglement decay of ( [ hs - state ] ) resembles that of @xmath54 and its entanglement is always larger than that of any other state tested in our samplings .",
    "contrary to what could be expected , the 3 qubit case is the most complex one .",
    "the small number of parameters needed to characterize a 3 qubit state is low enough to perform the numerical optimization process in a very short time , allowing us to identify states which are robust for different channels .",
    "the main difference between 3-qubit systems and the higher dimensional systems considered previously is that there is no 3-qubit robust state that simultaneously maximizes the entanglement for all the decoherence channels .",
    "all 3-qubit states optimizing the entanglement - robustness for a given channel quickly lose their entanglement when evolving under other decoherence maps .",
    "the @xmath0 provides a clear illustration of the peculiar features exhibited by three qubit systems .",
    "the entanglement of this state is robust under the action of the bf channel .",
    "however , for example , in the bpf channel s instance , the entanglement of the @xmath0 remains large for small @xmath8 values , but it then decays below the expected pattern until it almost vanishes for @xmath63 .",
    "a similar behavior occurs with other channels , even when using alternative states which are robust for some channels but whose entanglement very quickly decays under the action of other decoherence processes .",
    "in this section we are going to consider the decoherence behavior of systems initially prepared in states equivalent ( under local unitary operations ) to the @xmath0 state .",
    "in particular , we are going to determine ( for different decoherence channels ) which one of the aforementioned states exhibits the most robust entanglement .    by recourse to a numerical survey of the behavior of states equivalent to the @xmath0 one , we found that ( among the alluded states ) the one exhibiting the most robust entanglement for the phase damping and phase flip decoherence channels is the @xmath1-qubits state    @xmath64    obtained by applying the hadamard gate @xmath65 on each of the qubits of an @xmath1-qubits @xmath0 state . in equation ( [ elsime ] ) , @xmath66 and @xmath67 stand , respectively , for states @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "the decay of the amount of entanglement corresponding to various initial four - qubits states is depicted in fig . 2 for the phase damping , depolarizing , bit flip , and bit phase flip decoherence channels , respectively .",
    "the four - qubits states considered in fig .",
    "2 are the @xmath0 , the @xmath70 provided by eq .",
    "( [ elsime ] ) , as well as 1000 states generated applying random local unitary transformations to the @xmath0 states .",
    "we also plot the decay of entanglement for the robust state @xmath71 previously introduced in eq .",
    "( [ hs - state ] ) .",
    "excepting the @xmath71 state , all these states are equivalent under local unitary transformations to @xmath0 .",
    "as we mentioned in the previous section , the @xmath71 state is the most robust 4-qubit state for all the considered channels .",
    "we note that for the depolarizing channel the decay of entanglement only depends on the initial amount of entanglement .",
    "the decay of entanglement for the @xmath0 and @xmath70 states under the pf , bf , and bpf channels is somehow equivalent , in the sense that the decay for the @xmath0 for the pf is the same than the decay of the @xmath70 for the bf .",
    "this is the reason why we only plot one of these channels , as the other one is equivalent .",
    "this behavior is easily explained because the unitary transformation @xmath65 that maps the state @xmath0 into the @xmath70 is the same that transforms the bf channel into the pf .     vs. @xmath0 states for a 4 qubits system .",
