    "the fundamental nature of einstein equations as well as beautiful discovery of the existence of a large class of two - dimensional completely integrable systems made very natural various expectations and conjectures of the integrability of the einstein equations , at least for the space - times with an abelian two - dimensional isometry group , when the reduced dynamical equations are effectively two - dimensional .",
    "first of all , this concerned the einstein equations for gravitational fields in vacuum , which integrability was conjectured and even motivated partially long ago ( see the papers of geroch , maison )  .",
    "however , the actual discovery of very rich internal structure of these equations and development of effective methods for the construction of infinitely large classes of their solutions actually have been started more then twenty years ago .",
    "it is necessary to mention here a variety of more or less general and well known now methods and results , such as belinskii and zakharov formulation of the inverse scattering method and their construction of vacuum @xmath0-soliton solutions , the constructions of bcklund transformations of harrison and of neugebauer , the infinite dimensional algebra of internal symmetries of stationary axisymmetric electrovacuum einstein - maxwell equations , found by kinnersley and chitre and `` exponentiation '' of some of these symmetries made by hoenselaers , kinnersley and xanthopoulos .",
    "later it was shown , that besides the vacuum case , the integrability properties are possessed by two - dimensional space - time symmetry reductions of einstein equations in the presence of the massless matter fields  the electromagnetic fields ( kinnersley and chitre , hauser and ernst , ga ) , or / and weyl massless two - component spinor ( neutrino ) field ( ga ) , or / and minimally coupled scalar field , or / and stiff fluid with @xmath1 ( belinskii ) , or electromagnetic field with dilaton ( belinski and ruffini ) , as well as of some string theory induced gravity models with axion , dilaton and electromagnetic fields ( e.g. , bakas , sen , galtsov and kechkin ) .",
    "in this communication we present a sketch of general approach to the analysis and solution of all mentioned above integrable space - time symmetry reductions of einstein equations ( of both , hyperbolical and elliptical types ) .",
    "this approach , called a `` monodromy transform approach '' , is based on and it develops the results of the author s papers  @xcite@xmath2@xcite .",
    "it leads a ) to a definition in the most general context of a convenient set of functional parameters ",
    "`` monodromy data '' , which analytical properties on the spectral plane are closely related to various physical and geometrical properties of solutions , and b ) to a construction of pure linear integral equations ( of cauchy and then , of fredholm types ) equivalent to the original reduced field equations and admitting a construction of their general local solutions in terms of homogeneously converging functional series   for the metric components ) .",
    "the corresponding rigorous proof can be found in the recently published paper of hauser and ernst ( i.  hauser , f.j .",
    "ernst , gr - qc/9903104 ) , where many closely related statements were proved in fullest detail , but in a different context of the analysis of the group structure of the solution space of the ernst equations and characteristic initial value problem . ] .",
    "various applications of this approach to a classification of solutions , exact linearization of various boundary value problems and to explicit construction of new classes of exact solutions are expected to be considered elsewhere .",
    "the space - time symmetry ansatz of existence of an abelian two - dimensional space - time isometry group , provided all field components and potentials also possess this symmetry , provides a reduction of all mentioned above cases or eventually , of einstein - maxwell - weyl equations to generalized form of the ernst equations , except for axion - dilaton gravity , which leads ( as it is already known ) to a matrix analog of these equations . in the differential form notation",
