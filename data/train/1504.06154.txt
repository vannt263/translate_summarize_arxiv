    "the quantum mechanics of a wide variety of physical systems can be quite accurately described by an appropriately chosen ensemble of complex fields ( also called , classical or c - fields ) @xcite .",
    "examples include quantum gases of ultracold atoms , coherent light fields , and solid state polariton systems .",
    "a common feature is the appearance of collective behavior such as high amplitude phase fluctuations and superfluid defects , that strongly fluctuate away from the mean field .",
    "though the term `` classical '' is used , we are talking about the opposite regime to the usual gas of classical _",
    "particles_. here it is the collective _ field _ that has classical properties such that each member of the ensemble could be non - destructively tracked , while the particles lose their individual identity .",
    "examples of such approaches include classical field ensembles @xcite , the stochastic gross - pitaevski equation @xcite , the truncated wigner representation @xcite for ultracold atoms , and the open stochastic classical field equations for polaritons @xcite .",
    "related approaches for fermions include stochastic mean field theory in e.g. heavy ion collisions@xcite , and effective field theories for the pairing order parameter@xcite .    in the absence of sufficient _ in situ _ experimental resolution , the approach is also commonly used like a flight recorder to give information on the dynamics of the system before its detection in destructive time - of - flight images .",
    "its applications are growing in importance given advances in the experimental investigation of spontaneous superfluid defects and phase fluctuations , such as @xcite . in quantum many - body systems with collective nonlinear phenomena , such ensembles of complex fields are often the only practical way to obtain theoretical information on fluctuations , full distribution functions , and  especially  on typical single realizations with superfluid defects or quasicondensate phase fluctuations @xcite .",
    "however , their use has usually been accompanied by lingering doubt on whether the results are quantitative or qualitative . from an operational perspective , two major contributing factors to that have been ( 1 ) a visible dependence of some results on the high energy cutoff that is chosen , and ( 2 ) different optimum cutoff values found in the literature @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to identify a regime where c - fields are in fact quantitatively accurate , so that they can be used there with confidence .",
    "qualitatively , the condition for the applicability of classical fields to bosons is that the relevant physics can be captured by considering only the highly occupied single - particle modes , without the need for a condensate @xcite .",
    "poorly occupied modes are not described well , and those above an energy cutoff need to be discarded to avoid pathological behavior such as the uv catastrophe known since late 19th century physics .",
    "however , the matter of just where to draw the line and how accurate the description is , has been a matter of much contention and ambiguity .",
    "the history of applying classical fields to ultra cold atomic gases teaches us that accuracy has depended quite strongly on the choice of the high energy cutoff and the observables studied .",
    "past numerical benchmarking @xcite , careful comparisons to experiment @xcite , and also analytical @xcite and purely mathematical studies @xcite of various single observables have found that it is possible to achieve good to very good agreement , but the details of the recipe vary from study to study @xcite .    here",
    ", we intend to clarify these dependencies , and will show that under the right conditions the classical field approximation can be treated as more than just a qualitative guide , but gives predictions that are correct within small error bounds for a wide range of observables",
    ".    we will concentrate first on the case of an ideal gas as a baseline , reasoning that well described interacting regimes can be found at temperatures that are already well - described in the ideal gas",
    ". then we will confirm that accuracy seen in the ideal gas carries over into the weakly interacting regime under appropriate conditions .",
    "we will work in the local density approximation ( lda ) in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "that is , we will consider pieces of the gas cloud having a certain _ local _ density , which allows us to remain general in terms of trap geometry . in the lda",
    ", it is natural to work in the grand canonical ensemble ( gce ) , where the rest of the system acts as the particle and thermal reservoir .",
    "such a model underpins more general behavior , and it will be seen that several important conclusions can be reached .    in sec.[appr ]",
    "we will describe our approach .",
    "further , in sec.[eigen ] , we will find the temperature dependent `` eigen '' cutoffs that allow the classical fields to correctly match the density and one other observable .",
    "subsequently , in sections [ rms ] and [ rms ] we will determine the resulting errors in other observables and the cutoff that minimizes the systematic error across the whole range of observables .",
    "this will tell us about the temperature range over which an accurate complex field description of the system is possible . finally , via numerical benchmarking of a weakly interacting gas in 1@xmath0 to the exact yang and yang solution @xcite we will show in sec.[inter ] that the ideal gas results carry over largely unchanged into that regime .",
    "we conclude in sec.[conc ] .",
    "the essence of the classical fields method is to replace annihilation ( creation ) operators @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) of single particle modes in the field operator by complex amplitudes   @xmath5   ( @xmath6 ) , which is warranted when occupation is macroscopic",
    ". then we can write : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the wave function for the @xmath9th mode and @xmath10 denotes the low energy subspace . since we will be considering uniform sections of the gas , plane wave modes @xmath11 are the most convenient , with momentum cutoff @xmath12 so that only modes @xmath13 are included in @xmath10 .",
    "in general , it should be understood that @xmath14 corresponds to an ensemble @xmath15 of complex field realizations , each with its own set of amplitudes @xmath5 .",
    "the full ensemble preserves the gauge symmetry of the quantum thermal state that corresponds to a set of many experimental realizations .",
    "this is despite the  virtual \" symmetry breaking done by each member of the ensemble similarly to a single experimental realization @xcite .",
    "the properties of the uniform dilute gas can be encapsulated by two dimensionless parameters .",
    "the first is @xmath16 with density @xmath17 and contact interaction strength @xmath18 , and the second is a reduced temperature   @xmath19 which depends on the density @xmath17 , but not on the interaction strength .",
    "we choose the thermal de broglie wavelength @xmath20 as our length scale , so that the reduced temperature is @xmath21 here , @xmath22 is the usual quantum degeneracy temperature in @xmath0 dimensions that corresponds to one particle per region of volume @xmath23 .",
    "it is a natural scale for our investigation because then @xmath24 corresponds to the point at which the highest mode occupation is @xmath25 , and this constitutes the intuitive ultimate upper bound on temperature for which classical field descriptions make sense .",
    "it is convenient to also scale the cutoff in these units : @xmath26 a value of @xmath27 corresponds to a cutoff at the plane waves with thermal de broglie wavelength @xmath28 .",
    "we will henceforth work in the following units : @xmath29 and @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the mass of particles .",
    "note that the cutoff in terms of single particle energy is @xmath32    in the ideal gas limit ( @xmath33 ) that we consider first , there is only one physical parameter characterizing the system  the density - dependent reduced temperature @xmath19 , and one technical parameter @xmath34 for the classical fields description .",
    "phase space density equal to one occurs at @xmath35 in 1@xmath0 , 2@xmath0 and 3@xmath0 respectively , while the bec critical temperature in @xmath36 is @xmath37 .",
    "the great majority of experiments concentrate on low order observables such as phase , density or their fluctuations .",
    "we will analyze the following :    1 .",
    "@xmath17  density .    2 .",
    "@xmath38  kinetic energy per particle .    3 .",
    "@xmath39  phase grain length .",
    "+ this is the size of a coherent region , which we will calculate   via   @xmath40 .",
    "in the quasicondensate regime , when @xmath41 , @xmath39   equals the phase coherence   length   @xmath42 .    4 .",
    "@xmath43  normalized local density fluctuations .",
    "+ while these are of much theoretical interest , they are rarely measured _ in situ _ because imaging resolution is usually much worse than the intrinsic density correlation length of the system .    5 .",
    "@xmath44  coarse - grained density fluctuations . +",
    "this quantity is defined as @xmath45 } + 1 $ ] , where @xmath46 is the atom number in a region much larger than the density correlation length .",
    "in contrast to @xmath47 , this intensive thermodynamic quantity often appears in experimental work @xcite and it gives the ratio of the measured fluctuations in a pixel to poisson shot noise .",
    "it is equal to the static structure factor at @xmath48 , i.e. @xmath49 .    6 .",
    "@xmath50  condensate fraction .    7 .",
    "@xmath51  coherence half width .",
    "+ in the presence of a true condensate , @xmath39 ( and @xmath44 ) ceases to be a good thermodynamic quantity , diverging because @xmath52 . in light of this",
    "we need another measure of the width of phase fluctuations , and will define it by the half width of the peak of @xmath53 , i.e. @xmath54 .",
    "it is worth noting that the kinetic energy per particle in itself is not a typical subject of measurement , but its consideration has here its own justifications .",
    "if typical observable quantities are described correctly , but @xmath55 is not , then this will quickly come out as errors in the dynamics .",
    "a major consideration in our work here has been to remain independent of trap geometry .",
    "this basically requires working in the local density approximation ( lda ) . as an example of variations with geometry that can occur without an lda approach , optimal energy cutoffs found on the basis of the distribution of condensate fraction for a whole cloud in the canonical ensemble were @xmath56 in a uniform box , but @xmath57 for a harmonically trapped gas @xcite . in the end in sec .",
    "[ disc]a , we will see that the results of the lda approach can be largely reconciled with the harmonically trapped canonical ensemble results .    when considering a relatively uniform section of a larger gas , it is not only possible , but also essential to work in the grand canonical ensemble ( gce ) rather than the canonical one .",
    "in such a situation the rest of the system acts as a particle and thermal reservoir , while the uniform gce section describes the properties that are local to the region .",
    "this approximation is acceptable provided the physical length scales such as @xmath39 are shorter than the length scale on which the density changes . such conditions generally prevail for quasicondensates or a 3@xmath0 gas above the condensation temperature .",
    "use of the gce in a truly condensed system such as the 3@xmath0 gas below @xmath58 or the finite - size 2@xmath0 gas at extreme low temperatures , requires some care and background to get our bearings .",
    "it is known that for the ideal gas the usual thermodynamic equivalence between ensembles is lost in the presence of condensation .",
    "particularly glaring differences are seen in the fluctuations of condensate fraction between the canonical and grand canonical ensemble  a matter that has been much studied @xcite and is sometimes known as the `` fluctuation catastrophe '' for the gce . in fact , a uniform condensed system in the gce has anomalous fluctuations of the number of condensed particles ( i.e. their variance grows faster than the mean number ) , which implies that some quantities such as @xmath44 diverge .",
    "technically this signals the point of the breakdown of the theory @xcite , but in reality this kind of behavior can not actually occur . physically",
    "the growth of diverging quantities is braked by other effects .",
    "usually , the causes can be traced to either a breakdown of the thermodynamic limit due to finite size effects , or a suppression of fluctuations due to interactions ( see @xcite for a detailed discussion ) .",
    "the primary difference between the grand canonical and microcanonical or canonical treatments of an ideal condensed system has been pointed out quite early @xcite by studying the ground state number fluctuations .",
    "they are huge in the gce ( the occupation @xmath59 of the ground state is exponentially distributed @xmath60 ) but small in the other thermodynamical ensembles . in contrast , there is no such difference for excited level occupations .",
    "this suggests that the majority of observables are not pathological .",
    "even the mean condensate fraction does not diverge nor break equivalence between ensembles , unlike its fluctuations .",
    "hence , it is legitimate to benchmark classical fields in the gce provided that we exclude from consideration those observables that are known to be deviant . in particular , when condensation is present neither condensate fraction @xmath50 nor the main coherence decay described by @xmath51 are pathological , so we will use these instead of @xmath44 and @xmath39 .",
    "the suppression of anomalous condensate fluctuations due to interactions can occur even at very weak interactions .",
    "this can be seen from a simple argument : consider the gce partition function of the condensate mode : @xmath61 with @xmath18 the interaction strength , and @xmath62 a geometry - dependent factor @xcite . in this form",
    "it is now a gaussian distribution of the condensate occupation with mean @xmath63 and relative condensate number fluctuations @xmath64 .",
    "it means that the relative magnitude of the number fluctuations is related to the ratio of the temperature to the interaction energy of the _ entire _ system , @xmath65 .",
    "the latter very quickly suppresses the grand canonical fluctuation catastrophe as the size of the system becomes appreciable , leaving only a tiny low temperature region at @xmath66 with anomalous fluctuations , that shrinks as @xmath67 .",
    "the above considerations are distinct from the separate matter of what ensemble should be considered for the _ entire _ system . if one were to nondestructively follow a single realization of the system over time and assume ergodic evolution , then the correct ensemble would be the microcanonical one that has the system isolated from particle and energy exchange .",
    "this has been considered in many works @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", actual experimental studies usually deal with an ensemble over many independent realizations created by cooling a new cloud each time , and independently measuring each destructively .",
    "then the fluctuations of the number of particles between different realizations can in fact be of the same order as the mean number of particles over the whole experimental series .",
    "due to the large number fluctuations between shots , a sequence of single clouds is likely to be more closely described by the gce than the ce .    to wrap up this section , once correlation length scales are short enough for the lda to be valid ,",
    "the approach used here is relevant also to global properties of the system when the gce fluctuation catastrophe is suppressed .",
    "this can happen because of any of the following : ( 1 ) lack of a true condensate , ( 2 ) observables that do not depend on fluctuations of the condensate fraction , ( 3 ) weak but sufficient interaction for @xmath65 of the entire system to be large compared to the temperature , ( 4 ) an experimental data set that consists of an ensemble of many independent realizations , except for the cases with strong post - selection on particle number .",
    "such conditions prevail in a very wide range of systems of interest . keeping these in mind ,",
    "let us proceed .      we will compare the classical field predictions for the observables in sec .",
    "[ obs ] to the exact bose gas values in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "for the ideal gas they can mostly be obtained analytically .",
    "to proceed , the lda approximation requires first the density to be correct , in the sense that an ideal gas with density @xmath17 ( i.e. reduced temperature @xmath19 ) should be compared to a classical field ensemble with the same density .",
    "this is also essential in practice regardless of the lda , since @xmath17 is the most basic observed quantity in experiments . to match ideal gas and classical field densities ,",
    "firstly chemical potentials @xmath68 and @xmath69 , respectively , must be chosen .",
    "a sum over gibbs factors gives the exact bose gas density @xmath70 and the density estimate @xmath71 in classical fields as functions of their grand canonical chemical potentials .",
    "we invert these , and with the help   of   eq .",
    "( [ eq_tau ] ) obtain @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "other observables e.g. @xmath74 and @xmath75 can then be expressed as functions of @xmath19 and @xmath34 as well .    in general ,",
    "for the bose ideal gas , @xmath19 and the choice of units specify all properties of the system . in classical fields ,",
    "in addition to @xmath19 , the system description requires a technical parameter @xmath34 .",
    "there , we can fit both densities @xmath76 and @xmath77 to @xmath19 , but also we can make one other quantity agree exactly by an appropriate choice of @xmath34 .",
    "for several observables as   a   function of temperature @xmath19 ( @xmath38  blue line , @xmath51  purple line , @xmath39  green line , @xmath44  red line , @xmath50  orange line ) .",

    "[ eigfc ] shows how such cutoffs matched to different observables ( which we will call _ eigen _ cutoffs ) behave as a function of temperature .",
    "the density is already matched due to the lda as explained above , and is not shown .",
    "we have also not shown results for @xmath47 because it is always correctly predicted to be @xmath79 for every cutoff in the ideal gas .",
    "this property will not hold any more when interactions are present . indeed , then the local density fluctuations manifest a dependence on cutoff .    the high temperature behavior is qualitatively similar in all dimensions .",
    "the eigen cutoffs matched to energy per particle @xmath80 and to coherence half width @xmath81 rise to constant values , while the eigen cutoff matched for density fluctuation @xmath82 drops to zero ( this will be commented on later in sec .",
    "[ disc]b ) .",
    "the @xmath83 takes intermediate values and is almost constant .",
    "an unexpected feature is the similar behavior of cutoffs corresponding to @xmath51 and @xmath38 rather than the @xmath51 and @xmath39 that are more related physically .",
    "the crossover to low temperature behavior is around @xmath24 , as expected . in the low temperature regime ,",
    "most eigen cutoffs collapse to a common value ( @xmath84   and   @xmath85 , in 1@xmath0 and 2@xmath0 , respectively ) , except for @xmath86 which prefers the higher values @xmath87   and   @xmath88 . in 3@xmath0 ,",
    "the cutoffs at   @xmath89 are @xmath90 , @xmath91 , and @xmath87 for @xmath38 , @xmath51 , and @xmath50 , respectively .",

    "two other noteworthy points are that : ( @xmath101 ) in 2@xmath0 , the eigen cutoff @xmath102 that gives the correct phase grain length   @xmath39 does not depend on temperature , and ( @xmath103 ) the wave - like behavior of @xmath81 in 1@xmath0 ( as well as in 2@xmath0 ) , that comes from oscillations of @xmath104 with distance , is caused by the sharp cutoff in momentum space in classical fields .",
    "now , how does a non - optimal choice of @xmath34 affect the observables , and their systematic error ?",
    "this is very relevant for practical considerations .",
    "for one thing , in a nonuniform system , when the cutoff is matched in one spatial region , it is good to know the sensitivity of results in other regions with a different density on this choice of   @xmath34",

    "the first observation is that the relative error of energy per particle has an opposite trend to the other quantities .",
    "the resulting mismatch turns out to be the strongest restriction on the @xmath34 range for which all @xmath108 errors are small .",
    "secondly , in 1@xmath0 the known fact @xcite that @xmath104 and @xmath109 do not depend on cutoffs at low @xmath19 , is reflected in small errors in @xmath39 , @xmath44 , and @xmath51",

    "the cutoffs found for the harmonically trapped canonical ensemble of the ideal gas based on condensate fraction distribution at low @xmath19 @xcite correspond in our notation to values of in 1 , 2 , and 3@xmath0 , respectively .",
    "these are quite close to the gce values of opt@xmath161 found here ( figs .",
    "[ bigrmsdim1]-[bigrmsdim3 ] ) .",
    "this further reinforces the view that results obtained with the lda are also relevant for nonuniform gases , even when the entire cloud does not have particle exchange with an environment .",
    "a certain exception is the canonical ensemble in a box whose cutoffs were also studied in @xcite and found to be much lower @xmath162 .",
    "this indicates that this is a special case which describes very different physics .",
    "the matter of which ensemble should be used to describe the recently achieved box potentials @xcite is still open .",
    "if the interaction is not too strong , then shot - to - shot fluctuations in energy and particle number can be appreciable and so a grand canonical approach may be warranted for the whole gas ( if one is concerned with ensemble rather than time - averaged properties ) .",
    "the reason for the drop of @xmath163 to zero at high @xmath19 provides an instructive example of how the classical field description breaks down .",
    "generally the explanation comes down to different statistics of particle numbers @xmath164 in the modes .",
    "both the fully quantum bose gas and the classical field have an exponentially decaying particle number distribution : @xmath165 in each mode .",
    "however , in the exact treatment , @xmath164 can only take on discrete values @xmath166 , while in the classical fields the non - integer part of the distribution is also needed .",
    "this peculiarity very strongly increases fluctuations especially when the bulk of the distribution is in this region , i.e. the mean number of particles is @xmath167 .",
    "the above observations are transfered to @xmath44 in the following way : for the exact bose gas , the distribution is poissonian when @xmath168 , giving @xmath169~=~\\langle n^{\\rm(id)}_{\\mathbf{k}}\\rangle$ ] for each mode , while the exponential distribution in classical fields gives @xmath170~=~\\langle n^{\\rm(cf)}_{\\mathbf{k}}\\rangle^2 $ ] . due to having independent modes , @xmath171\\ / \\sum_{\\mathbf{k } } \\langle n_{\\mathbf{k}}\\rangle$ ] , and in the exact treatment @xmath172 directly . to obtain the same with classical fields , occupations @xmath173 are necessary to make @xmath174\\approx \\langle n_{\\mathbf{k}}\\rangle$ ] .",
    "these are much greater than in the bose gas .",
    "so to also simultaneously match overall density of the many - mode gas , the cutoff must be made much lower than the bose gas momentum width @xmath175 so as to get the same area under the distribution of density in k - space . from ( [ eq_fc ] ) , this immediately implies @xmath176 . with such a great modification of @xmath177 , correctly matching additional observables like",
    "@xmath38 with classical fields becomes out of the question .",
    "a similar breakdown can be expected whenever the physics is captured by low - occupied independent modes .",
    "for example , such discrepancies were seen between experiment and classical fields in the quantum bogoliubov regime of the _ interacting _ gas at very low temperatures @xcite .",
    "an obvious question is whether the ideal gas results carry over into the interacting gas . to address this ,",
    "we have benchmarked the classical field description in 1@xmath0 system with the yang - yang exact solution for the uniform interacting bose gas @xcite for a sequence of increasing interaction strengths that cover the crossover from the ideal gas to an interaction - induced quasicondensate .",
    "the exact values for @xmath178 , as well as system energy @xmath179 in a segment of length @xmath180 can be obtained via the self - consistent numerical solution of the integral equations given in the original yang - yang paper @xcite .",
    "the hellmann - feynman theorem was used by kheruntsyan _",
    "_ to obtain @xmath181 from the yang - yang solution for pressure @xmath182 @xcite , which can be readily evaluated numerically .",
    "for the contact - interacting gas the expression for the interaction energy in the system is @xmath183 . from this",
    ", one obtains the kinetic energy per particle : @xmath184 .",
    "the coarse - grained density fluctuations can also be found via @xmath185 , based on the expression for @xmath186 $ ] in @xcite .    to obtain classical field results ,",
    "we generate ensembles of classical field realizations @xmath187 using a metropolis algorithm , in a way conceptually similar to the work of witkowska _ et al . _",
    "@xcite but using grand canonical ensemble weights @xmath188/k_bt}$ ] .",
    "the numerical lattice is chosen to have a box of length @xmath180 with periodic boundary conditions that is wide enough for the density and phase correlations to decay to zero before wrapping around .",
    "the number of points was @xmath189 , which is easily sufficient for the maximum numerical lattice wavevector to be many times larger than the cutoffs @xmath12 imposed on the field in k - space .",
    "this ensures that no aliasing problems appear for the evaluation of the interaction energy term , as has been discussed in the context of the padded lattice in the pgpe and truncated wigner methods @xcite .",
    "classical field values for observables at a given cutoff are calculated using @xmath190 ensemble members .    for each cutoff",
    ", the observables are benchmarked against exact yang - yang values for systems having the same values of @xmath157 , @xmath18 , and density @xmath17 as the classical field ensemble .",
    "it remains true for the interacting gas that @xmath44 and @xmath191 have the most extreme behavior among the set of observables that now also include the interaction energy per particle and @xmath47 .",
    "the latter two have a cutoff - dependent behavior that is somewhat similar to @xmath44 .",
    "hence , we continue to use the same global accuracy indicator ( [ eqbigrms ] ) as for the ideal gas , using the kinetic energy per particle @xmath191 and coarse - grained fluctuations @xmath44 .",

    "the ideal gas values for cutoff carry over onto the interacting gas unchanged , to within available statistical precision .",
    "the global accuracy @xmath121 actually improves .",
    "one concludes then that in this regime at least the optimum cutoff and degree of accuracy found in the ideal gas applies very well to a wide swath of the interacting gas as well .",
    "this is not an _ a priori _ obvious result , but certainly a convenient and encouraging one for those who want to make calculations using classical fields .",
    "to conclude , we have judged the goodness of classical fields for describing the ideal bose gas in 1@xmath0 , 2@xmath0 , and 3@xmath0 using all the usually measured observables .",
    "we have shown that @xmath132 or better accuracy for the whole set of observables simultaneously is possible in 1@xmath0 up to temperatures of @xmath212 with the cutoff prescription @xmath213 and in 3@xmath0 up to @xmath214 with @xmath215 .",
    "the essence of the matter can be captured by the indicator @xmath116 based on kinetic energy per particle and coarse grained density fluctuations , which are the observables that are the hardest to mutually satisfy .    in 2@xmath0 , we have found a surprising feature that classical fields remain incapable of properly describing all the observables together in the ideal gas even as @xmath67 .",
    "one suspects that finite size effects and/or weak interactions may improve agreement here .",
    "the indication is that something is going on in 2@xmath0 that warrants further study .",
    "when a system is correctly described with a classical ensemble of complex fields as here , the observation of many `` intrinsically quantum '' effects that rely on wave - particle duality or a discretization of the basis is ruled out .",
    "this includes things such as stronger - than - classical correlations , heisenberg uncertainty relations , mode entanglement , epr and bell inequality violation , antibunching , and noncommuting observables .",
    "all in line with the difference between classical optics on the one hand and quantum optics and quantum information theory on the other .",
    "thus , for parameters in which the weakly interacting bose gas is described by the classical field to some level of @xmath116 , observation of the above intrinsically quantum effects with typical observables will also be suppressed to a level of the same order as @xmath116 .",
    "of course , large @xmath116 is not sufficient to imply quantum effects .",
    "two results lead to optimistic conclusions for the practical application of classical fields to ultra cold gases .",
    "firstly , the optimum cutoffs in the ideal gas are almost unchanged with @xmath19 in the whole region where accuracy is good .",
    "this means that even for a nonuniform cloud with a common global temperature , a single cutoff value is close to optimal in the entire degenerate region .",
    "this goes a long way towards pacifying one of the leading practical worries .",
    "secondly , our study of the crossover into the interacting gas in sec .",
    "[ inter ] shows that the cutoff that optimizes the ideal gas is also valid for a part of the interacting gas , including a region where the quasicondensate is dominated by interactions .",
    "the degree of accuracy seen in the ideal gas is also preserved .",
    "this is a nontrivial but very encouraging result .",
    "a more detailed study of the situation for the whole range of interaction strengths in 1@xmath0 is in progress and will be reported on in future .",

    "<S> we determine the regime where the widespread classical field description for quantum bose gases is quantitatively accurate in 1@xmath0 , 2@xmath0 , and 3@xmath0 by a careful study of the ideal gas limit . </S>",
    "<S> numerical benchmarking in 1d shows that the ideal gas results carry over unchanged into the weakly interacting gas . </S>",
    "<S> the optimum high energy cutoff is in general shown to depend strongly on the observable in question ( e.g. energy , density fluctuations , phase coherence length , condensate fraction ) . </S>",
    "<S> this explains the wide spread of past results . </S>",
    "<S> a consistent classical field representation with less than 10% deviation in all typical observables can be given for systems at temperatures below @xmath1 degeneracy temperature in 1@xmath0 , and @xmath2 critical temperature in 3@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> surprisingly , this is not possible for the 2@xmath0 ideal gas even at zero temperature because mean density , density fluctuations and energy can not be simultaneously matched to the quantum results . </S>"
