    "the proton - neutron interaction includes tensor force and the spin - isospin dependent central force @xcite . in the picture of tensor force @xcite , the enhanced @xmath13 and reduced @xmath14 monopole interaction may arise from the tensor component if the others contribute the same interactional values . hence , when the @xmath10 orbital is occupied by more neutrons , the @xmath15 orbital goes down while @xmath16 orbital comes up , that is , the @xmath4 energy gap becomes smaller .",
    "likewise , the reduction of the @xmath5 gap can be associated with the spin - orbital partners @xmath17 and @xmath18 @xcite , between which the interaction is the so - called spin - isospin dependent central force @xcite .",

    "the high - spin level structure is reinvestigated and the configurations are figured out , in analogy to our earlier study of the @xmath25 isotone @xmath26zr @xcite .",

    "the energy and efficiency calibrations were made using the @xmath29co , @xmath30ba , and @xmath31eu standard sources and the typical energy resolution was 2.0@xmath322.5 kev at full width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) for the 1332.5-kev @xmath28 ray of @xmath29co .",
    "events were collected when at least 2 detectors are fired within the prompt 80 ns coincidence time window . under these conditions , a total of 2.5@xmath33 coincidence events were recorded and the data was sorted into a symmetrized @xmath34 matrix for subsequent off - line analysis .    in order to obtain multipolarity information of the emitted @xmath28 rays ,",
    "two asymmetric coincidence matrices were constructed using the @xmath28 rays detected at all angles ( as y axis ) against those observed at @xmath35 ( or @xmath36 ) and 90@xmath37 angles ( as x axis ) respectively . the ado ( @xmath28 ray angular distribution from oriented nuclei ) ratio @xcite",

    "the intensity ratio between the 415.3- and 619.6-kev lines proposes that the former is an e2 rather than m2 transition and the parity of the 3734.4-kev level is therefore positive .",
    "it can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] that the 327.7- and 335-kev lines are obviously dipole transitions if the 619.6- , 929.5- , 1371.0- and 1577.0-kev lines are quadrupole ones .",
    "hence , the 4483.4-kev level is @xmath43 . considering the intensity ratio of the 335.0- and 953.5-kev @xmath28 rays",
    ", the 953.5-kev @xmath28 ray should be an e3 rather than m3 transition and the parity of the 4483.4-kev level is of course negative .",

    "since the fermi levels of @xmath0y lie at the @xmath15 and @xmath10 , the active proton and neutron orbitals are @xmath52 and @xmath53 , respectively ( for the single - particle energies see ref .",
    "the @xmath54 state is naturally the @xmath55 proton coupled with two @xmath56 neutrons in pair .",

    "the three - particle @xmath59 configuration may persist till the @xmath60 .",
    "the @xmath60 is the maximum spin for the termination of the configuration in the space @xmath9 and @xmath10 .    above the fully aligned @xmath60",
    ", the states should therefore arise from the competition of one proton and one neutron excitations across the respective @xmath4 @xmath5 subshell closures .",
    "it has been pointed out in our previous results @xcite that the low - energy one is attributed to the neutron excitation . in the same way",
    ", we propose that the excitation from the 2157.4-kev ( @xmath61 ) to 3528.4-kev ( @xmath62 ) level is @xmath63 and the 3528.4-kev state has the @xmath64 configuration .",
    "the @xmath18 single - particle excitation energy relative to the @xmath10 decreases from @xmath652.19 mev in @xmath0zr to @xmath650.17 mev in @xmath66sn @xcite , namely @xmath650.2 mev lowered by adding a proton into the @xmath55 orbital .",
    "the energy of the @xmath67 excitation in @xmath26zr ( @xmath68 ) is 1098.4 kev .",
    "thus we can predict the excitation energy of the @xmath69 in @xmath0y to be @xmath651298.4 ( = 1098.4 + 200 ) kev ; the 1371-kev energy ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) agrees reasonably well with this value .",
    "the lowered @xmath63 excitation energy reflects the dramatic reduction of the @xmath5 energy gap due to the spin - isospin dependent central force .",
    "given the 3528.4-kev state as neutron particle - hole excitation , the other ( @xmath62 ) at 3734.4 kev is naturally attributed to the proton particle - hole excitation .",
    "since the z=38 energy gap is separated by the @xmath16 and @xmath15 , the particle - hole excitation might be @xmath70 .",
    "thus the energy gap in @xmath0y ( 1577 kev ) is @xmath650.233 mev lower than @xmath651.8 mev to break the @xmath71 subshell closure in @xmath6sr which is demonstrated by the excitation energy of the @xmath72 state @xcite .",
    "this indicates a possible reduction of the energy gap when two neutron goes into the @xmath73 orbital . from the introduction part",
    ", the reduction may be associated with the proton - neutron tensor force @xcite . to generate the @xmath74 spin value , both of the @xmath71 and @xmath75 subshell closures should be broken . therefore , the @xmath76 configuration is proposed for the @xmath77 state .    for achieving higher - spin state",
    ", the proton should be further excited to the @xmath55 , namely @xmath78 .",
    "the @xmath79 and @xmath44 states appear to be the terminations of the @xmath80 and @xmath81 configurations , respectively .",
    "the high - spin level structure of @xmath0y has been reinvestigated through the @xmath1se(@xmath2c , @xmath3)@xmath0y fusion - evaporation reaction .",
    "the level scheme has been modified .",
    "the spin - parity values of states in @xmath0y above the fully aligned @xmath60 state have been proposed .",
    "the configuration of high - spin states above the fully aligned @xmath60 state are figured out in terms of the breaking of the @xmath4 and @xmath5 subshell closures .",
