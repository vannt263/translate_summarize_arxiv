    "entanglement @xcite plays a vital role in quantum information processing , such as quantum teleportation @xcite , quantum key distribution @xcite , and quantum dense code @xcite .    before using the entanglement",
    ", one needs to make sure that it really exists in a given system . for an unknown quantum state",
    ", one may first perform the quantum state tomography @xcite which provides the full information about the density matrix , and then evaluate the entanglement property in terms of certain criterion and measure . however , the quantum state tomography is not very efficient for the detection and measurement of entanglement .",
    "horodecki and ekert proposed the direct methods for detecting @xcite and measuring @xcite entanglement in an unknown bipartite quantum state .",
    "their idea is to obtain the requisite eigenvalues by directly measuring some specific functions of the unknown quantum state .",
    "for example , when checking the positive partial transposition ( ppt ) criterion @xcite in an two - qubit quantum state @xmath0 , the observer can get the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath1 by directly measuring the functions @xmath2 , for @xmath3 @xcite . comparing with the quantum state tomography , the direct method is parametrically efficient . in horodecki and ekert s direct methods , the structural physical approximation ( spa ) technique @xcite and",
    "a modified interferometer network @xcite are employed .",
    "recently , carteret proved that the spa is unnecessary @xcite , which makes the direct methods more feasible .",
    "for multipartite entangled states , based on a set of entropic inequalities , alves _",
    "et al . _ put forward an efficient method @xcite for directly detecting entanglement in an optical lattice . the implementation of the method is also analyzed theoretically by palmer _",
    "et al _ @xcite .",
    "it is needful to characterize entanglement within local operations and classical communication ( locc ) scenario .",
    "_ proved that entanglement is a precondition for secure quantum key distribution @xcite .",
    "the locc schemes for directly detecting and measuring entanglement in an unknown bipartite state have been addressed in refs .",
    "@xcite . in multiparty quantum communication @xcite",
    ", the multipartite entangled state is an essential ingredient .",
    "therefore the locc detection and measurement of multipartite entanglement is worth to be considered .",
    "the property of the multipartite entangled state can be characterized partially by bipartite entanglement .",
    "for example , one can detect the entanglement in a tripartite system in terms of a set of ppt criteria , and furthermore , one can also quantify it with the corresponding set of negativities @xcite .",
    "recently , hyllus _ et al .",
    "_ designed an locc network for directly testing the ppt criterion in a tripartite quantum state , which is assumed implicitly to possess some specific symmetrical properties  @xcite .    in this paper , we generalize the network of hyllus _ et al . _ and propose an locc method for detecting a set of negativities @xcite in the _ arbitrary _ given tripartite quantum state .",
    "using this method , three observers , alice , bob , and charlie , need only to obtain the eigenvalues of a set of partial transposition matrices via the generalized locc network , rather than to perform the spa .",
    "if the minimum eigenvalue of any partial transposition matrix is negative , the tripartite quantum state is entangled and the magnitude of entanglement can be measured in terms of the corresponding negativity .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we present in detail the locc method for detecting negativities in an arbitrary given tripartite quantum state . then we discuss our method in sec .",
    "finally , conclusions are given in sec .",
    "negativity is a nontrivial entanglement measure , which is defined as @xcite @xmath4 where @xmath5 denotes the trace norm which is the sum of the moduli of eigenvalues for the hermitian matrix @xmath6 .",
    "this measure can be computed effectively for any mixed state of an arbitrary bipartite system .",
    "moreover , it gives an upper bound to teleportation capacity .",
    "the negativity can also be used to characterize the multipartite entanglement .",
    "et al . _ suggested a useful way to classify the entanglement properties of tripartite quantum state @xmath7 by looking at the different bipartite splitting @xcite .",
    "therefore , one may use a set of negativities , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , to quantify the corresponding entanglement in a tripartite system @xcite .",
    "we here develop an locc method to detecting the set of negativities without performing the spa .",
    "it is assumed that alice , bob and charlie share a number of copies of the unknown quantum state @xmath7 .",
    "the quantum state is defined on hilbert space @xmath14 with the dimension as @xmath15 .",

    "the dr - cirac - tarrach ( dct ) state is just such a kind of quantum state , which takes the form @xcite @xmath129 where @xmath130 , with @xmath131 and @xmath132 as the binary digits of @xmath133 and @xmath134 as the flipped @xmath135 . when the parameters are chosen to be @xmath136 , @xmath137 and @xmath138 , the corresponding quantum state is a bound entangled state and its matrix form reads @xmath139 in the computational basis @xmath88 .",
    "the method for generating and detecting the dct bound entanglement was given by hyllus _",
    "_ @xcite . here , we redescribe the detection procedure with our locc direct method .",
    "it is assumed that alice , bob and charlie share a number of copies of quantum state @xmath140 which is unknown to the three observers . after performing the four groups of measurements with the network shown in fig.1 ,",
    "they can obtain theoretically the data listed in table 1 .",
    ".theoretical values of the four groups of parameters for the quantum state @xmath140 in our locc direct method .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     combining these data with eq .",
    ", the three observers can deduce that @xmath141 is negative and other partial transposition matrices is semi - positive .",
    "based on the negative eigenvalue , they can obtain further the @xmath142 . here , it is noted that only when an infinite ensemble of identically prepared output state is given can alice , bob and charlie determine the parameter precisely . when a finite ensemble is given , they can only determine the parameter approximately .",
    "therefore , in order to obtain these parameters with high fidelity , they need to run the network many times .",
    "especially , for @xmath133 is bigger , they need to implement the network even more times .",
    "although our method that makes use of bipartite entanglement measures is limited to characterize partially the tripartite quantum state , it can occasionally detect the genuine tripartite entanglement in some specific cases .",
    "for example , in the case of three - qubit quantum state , when @xmath143 , @xmath144 and @xmath145 , we can deduce that the entanglement in the bipartite splitting @xmath146 is actually the genuine tripartite entanglement among alice , bob and charlie .",
    "this is because that the negativities @xmath147 and @xmath148 can characterize the two - qubit entanglement sufficiently . when the two entanglements are zero , the residual entanglement @xmath149 must be the tripartite entanglement . the quantum state @xmath140 in eq .",
    "( 25 ) is just the case .",
    "similarly , when @xmath150 and @xmath151 ( or @xmath152 and @xmath153 ) , we are also able to judge that @xmath154 ( or @xmath155 ) is of tripartite entanglement",
    ". certainly , for a general three - qubit mixed state , whether or not the tripartite entanglement exists can not be detected , simply because a well - defined tripartite entanglement measure is still unavailable , though a lot of efforts have been made .",
    "two problems are worth to remark in our locc method .",
    "first , the set of negativities can only quantify some aspects of the entanglement in a tripartite system .",
    "there exists some tripartite entangled state @xcite that is ppt with respect to any of the bipartite splitting .",
    "moreover , as pointed by hyluss _",
    "@xcite , there is a potential problem in practical application of the direct methods , _",
    "i.e. _ , how to implement effectively the controlled quantum gates , especially the controlled - swap gate @xcite .",
    "the solution of this problem relies on the quantum technology that is currently being developed .",
    "in this paper , we have generalized the direct approach of hyllus _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite and proposed an locc method for detecting a set of negativities in an arbitrary given tripartite quantum state .",
    "the main task for the three observers is to measure @xmath103 parameters via three local networks supplemented by a classical communication .",
    "comparing with the locc quantum state tomography which requires to measure @xmath102 parameters , our locc method is more efficient .",
    "moreover , our locc method does not require the observers to perform the spa of partial transposition maps , which supports the carteret s opinion @xcite on the three - party scenario , _",
    "i.e. _ , it is not the only way that they make the quantum state undergo the partial transposition map , if alice , bob and charlie want to measure the function of the partial transposition of @xmath7 .",
