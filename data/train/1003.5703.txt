    "@xcite are pioneering the effort to empirically establish the pulsational instability strip for accretors and to test the theoretical framework laid down by @xcite .",
    "the instability strip(s ) for these pulsators has to be established separately from the zz  ceti  strip @xcite , and are also known as the zz  ceti  stars . ] because accretion enriches their envelopes with he and metals .",
    "this is distinct from the pure h envelope of the non - interacting da white dwarfs , where h ionization causes them to pulsate as zz  ceti  stars .",
    "@xcite find a h / hei instability strip for accreting model white dwarfs with a blue edge near 12000k for a 0.6@xmath1star , similar to the zz  ceti  instability strip .",
    "they also find an additional hotter instability strip at @xmath215000k due to heii ionization for accreting model white dwarfs with a high he abundance ( @xmath30.38 ) .",
    "the spectrum of an accreting pulsator includes prominent broad absorption lines from the white dwarf as well as the central emission features from the accretion disk . when the orbital period of a cataclysmic variable is @xmath480 - 90min , it is near the evolutionary orbital period minimum , where the rate of mass transfer is theoretically expected to be the smallest @xmath5@xmath1/yr @xcite . due to the low rates of mass transfer , the white dwarf is expected to be the source of 90% of the optical light observed from these systems @xcite .",
    "this makes it possible to detect white dwarf pulsations in these cataclysmic variables .",
    "accreting pulsators have probably undergone a few billion years of accretion and thousands of thermonuclear runaways .",
    "studying these systems will allow us to address the following questions : to what extent does accretion affect the white dwarf mass , temperature , and composition and how efficiently is angular momentum transferred to the core of the white dwarf .",
    "these systems are also crucial in understanding the above effects of accretion on pulsations .",
    "asteroseismology can allow us to obtain meaningful mass constraints for the pulsating primary white dwarfs of cataclysmic variables .",

    "constraining the population , mass distribution , and evolution of accreting white dwarfs is also important for studying supernovae type ia systematics .",
    "for example , @xcite show empirically that the maximum mass of white dwarf progenitors has to be at least 7.1@xmath1 thus constraining the lower mass limit for supernovae progenitors .",
    "@xcite deduced that sdssj161033.64 - 010223.3  ( v386  ser ; hereafter sdss1610 - 0102 ) is a cataclysmic variable from early sdss spectroscopic observations @xcite ; sdss has single - handedly led to a substantial increase in the number of known cataclysmic variables",
    ". subsequently @xcite discovered photometric variations in the light curve of sdss1610 - 0102  consistent with non - radial pulsations .",
    "they determined two independent pulsation modes with periods near 607s and 345s , also finding their harmonics and linear combinations in the data . noting the amplitude modulation in the light curves , @xcite concluded that the dominant mode was a multiplet , but were unable to resolve it .",
    "they also determined the orbital period of 80.52min from the observed double - humped modulation in their light curves .",
    "we chose to target sdss1610 - 0102for a multi - site asteroseismic campaign from eleven possibilities known then for the following reasons .",
    "previous observations of the system had revealed two independent pulsation frequencies , while several similar systems show no more than one pulsation frequency .",
    "each independent pulsation frequency serves as a constraint on the stellar structure ; detecting a larger number of frequencies is essential in obtaining a unique seismological fit .",
    "sdss1610 - 0102  has an equatorial declination , making it easily accessible to observatories in both northern and southern hemispheres .",
    "the objective of the multi - site participation is to keep the sun from rising on the target star @xcite ; reducing the gaps in the stellar data due to daytime increases the contrast between the true frequency and its aliases , thus making multi - site observations more effective than single - site observations .",
    "we acquired optical time - series photometry on the accreting white dwarf pulsator sdss1610 - 0102  over a duration of 11 days in may 2007 using multiple telescopes .",
    "our multi - site campaign involved using the prime focus time - series photometer argos @xcite on the 2.1 m otto struve telescope at mcdonald observatory ( mo ) , and the time - series photometer agile @xcite on the 3.5 m telescope at apache point observatory ( apo ) .",
    "both instruments are frame transfer ccd cameras devoid of mechanical shutters , where the end of an exposure and the beginning of a new exposure is triggered directly by the negative edges of gps - synchronized pulses without any intervention from the data acquisition software .",
    "there is also no dead time between consecutive exposures from ccd read times , making argos and agile ideal instrumentation for the study of variable phenomena with millisecond timing accuracy .",
    "argos and agile consist of back - illuminated ccds with an enhanced back - thinning process for higher blue quantum efficiency .",
    "additionally , the e2v ccd47 - 20 in agile has an ultra - violet coating to enhance the wavelength efficiency of the region 200370 nm to 35% .",

    "however in this case , we do not believe that the 8hr period is stellar in origin .",

    "the 609s triplet is clearly an independent pulsation mode since it has the highest amplitude of all observed periods ; typically harmonics and linear combinations have lower amplitudes than the parent modes .",
    "we can also readily identify the periods close to 304.5s as the first harmonic of the 609s triplet .",
    "a triplet can be expected at 304.5s because the harmonic of a triplet should also be a triplet .",
    "however we are unable to resolve it , due most likely to the relatively lower amplitudes compared to the 609s triplet .",
    "there is also a small chance that the 609s photometric period represents the rotation of the star , and we are misinterpreting it as nonradial pulsation .",
    "sdss1610 - 0102  is neither strongly magnetic nor a source of x - rays , and therefore we do not expect to see a rotating hot spot as in the intermediate polars . it is difficult for a hot spot or belt to match the observed pulse shape of the 609s period .",
    "if the 609s period was the rotation period of the star , it would also be difficult to explain the evenly spaced triplet , but the triplet could perhaps have been caused by reprocessing or reflection effects .",
    "the ratio of the uv to optical pulsation amplitude of the 609s period is consistent with low order g - mode pulsations @xcite .",
    "for all of these reasons collectively , nonradial pulsation is certainly the favourable model to explain the 609s photometric triplet .",
    "however please note that we are currently unable to absolutely exclude the possibility that the 609s period is the rotation period of the star .",
    "for the rest of this paper , we will adopt the more likely model of nonradial pulsation for the 609s triplet .",
    "let f@xmath23 , f@xmath13 , f@xmath12 , f@xmath15 , and f@xmath14 denote the frequencies corresponding to the 41.5min , 806s , 609s , 347s , and 221s periods .",
    "the linear combinations in our frequency set are : f@xmath14=3f@xmath12-f@xmath23 , f@xmath15=2f@xmath12-f@xmath23 , and f@xmath13=f@xmath12-f@xmath23 .",
    "note that the amplitudes of all the proposed combination modes are smaller than the suggested parent modes as expected . justifying the frequency f@xmath14 involves invoking 3f@xmath12 , which has not been observed directly .",
    "@xcite identify f@xmath15 as a second independent pulsation mode ; however given the relation f@xmath15=2f@xmath12-f@xmath23 within uncertainties , we arrive at the inevitable conclusion that it is merely a linear combination mode .",
    "this is probably the first instance for pulsating white dwarfs where linear combination frequencies have apparently emerged as a result of an interplay between a non - radial pulsation mode f@xmath12 and a harmonic of the orbital frequency f@xmath23 .",
    "the idea of a physical interaction between nonradial pulsation and tides caused by orbital motion may be relevant here .",
    "we defer a thorough investigation to a future theoretical paper .",
    "a measure of the gross ability of our data to resolve the components of the 609s mode is evident from a comparison of the dft and the window function , shown in the top and bottom panels of figure [ trip ] respectively .",
    "the window function is the dft of a single frequency noiseless sinusoid sampled at exactly the same times as the actual light curve . comparing",
    "the dft to the window function unambiguously reveals the low frequency component and definite additional width , indicating the presence of more than one frequency .",
    "using least squares analysis in conjunction with the technique of prewhitening , we are able to separate these resolved components .",
    "prewhitening is the standard procedure for isolating and characterizing closely spaced spectral components ; it involves subtracting out the best fit for the highest amplitude component of the multiplet from the light curve and re - computing the dft .",
    "carrying out this procedure for the 609.089s period gives clear residuals with similar amplitude at similar spacing above and below in frequency , as shown in the second panel of figure [ trip ] .",
    "continuing to prewhiten with the 608.615s ( third panel ) and then the 609.509s periods ( fourth panel ) leads to marginal residual power near the 3@xmath8 detection limit of 1.71mma .",
    "this exercise demonstrates that the 609s mode is made up of three components in the form of a triplet as listed in table [ bfit - per ] .",
    "measured pulsation amplitudes are typically lower than the intrinsic pulsation amplitudes due to geometric cancellation .",
    "this effect has three independent causes : disk averaging , inclination angle , and limb darkening .",
    "the inclination angle dictates the distribution of bright and dark zones in our view for a given mode ; this introduces a large amount of scatter in observed pulsation amplitudes .",
    "eigenmodes with different @xmath24 values exhibit different cancellation patterns ( see @xcite ) .",
    "hence we did not expect that all members of the 609s triplet should have had the same amplitude .",
    "given that the implications of the triplet spacing are most unexpected , we conducted simulations to verify whether the triplet is indeed genuine or merely caused by a singular changing period .",
    "although the pulsation period of a non - interacting zz  ceti  only drifts due to stellar cooling @xcite , the period of an accreting pulsator can drift on a faster timescale . during a dwarf nova outburst ,",
    "an accreting white dwarf is heated to temperatures well beyond the instability strip and it ceases to pulsate ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "once the white dwarf has cooled down close to its quiescent temperature and pulsations have resumed in the star , @xcite explain how mode frequencies can drift a little due to the continued cooling of the outer envelope .",
    "they calculate that the longer period modes such as the 609s mode should drift at the rate of d@xmath25/dt@xmath4-@xmath26hz / s .",
    "this expected model drift rate from the cooling of the outer envelope is much faster than the observed drift rate of d@xmath25/dt@xmath4-@xmath27hz / s for zz  ceti  pulsators from the cooling of the entire star @xcite . during our 11 day campaign",
    ", we should expect a drift in the pulsation period of the order of 1@xmath28hz , comparable to the observed triplet spacing .",
    "hence it becomes necessary to check whether a drifting period is responsible for the observed triplet , a fairly general way of introducing spurious peaks in the dft .    as a first step ,",
    "we simulated constant - amplitude light curves with a single variable period near 609s ; the period was varied at different non - zero constant rates .",
    "the goal of the simulation was to check if it is possible to fit a triplet to any of the generated light curves , while processing them in the same manner as the real light curve from the campaign . for each drift rate",
    "dp / dt , we simulated a light curve with exactly the same time sampling as the real data , adding in gaussian noise with an amplitude comparable to the observed white noise .",
    "we computed a dft from the simulated light curve , and then used the techniques of least squares analysis and prewhitening to determine its frequency components , proceeding in exactly the same way as the real data .",
    "figure [ pdrift1 ] shows the dfts corresponding to the drift rates dp / dt=6@xmath29s / s and dp / dt=6@xmath30s / s , also including the dft of a single constant period at 609s for reference .",
    "figure [ pdrift1 ] clearly demonstrates that the amplitude of the dft based on the 11-day simulated light curve is inversely proportional to the drift rate ; faster the drift rate of the period , smaller the amplitude of the variable period in the dft .",
    "the drift rate of the period has to be fast enough to cause a triplet spacing of 1.2@xmath28hz in 11days , and slow enough that the amplitude of the dft does not fall significantly below the simulation amplitude .",
    "we find that the drift rate of 6@xmath29s / s comes close to reproducing the triplet spacing .",
    "however we are unable to use non - linear least squares code to fit three closely - spaced frequency components to the light curve simultaneously , indicating that they are not resolved .    for the second step , we simulated mono - periodic signals whose period and amplitude vary continuously as low order functions . in order to keep our simulations realistic , we determined possible low - order functions using the observed data . to this end",
    ", we identified 19 runs of 4.8hr duration or longer , acquired during the course of the campaign .",
    "figure [ dm ] indicates our measurements of period and amplitude for these runs ; the amplitudes from filterless data are scaled by a factor of 1.31 and v filter data by a factor of 1.15 .",
    "figure [ dm ] shows a first and third order polynomial fit ; both sets of fits are weighted inversely as the squares of the uncertainties .",
    "points with uncertainties in period less than 0.6s and uncertainties in amplitude less than 2mma are isolated in the lower panels of figure [ dm ] .",
    "note that apart from two points close to the 17th and 18th of may , there is no strong evidence for any change in period .    for each low order function that fit the individual period measurements , we simulated light curves with all possible functions that fit the amplitude measurements , to exhaust all possibilities of how the 609s periodicity could have changed .",
    "in most cases , the amplitude of the dft computed from the 11day simulated light curve fell to values in the range of 1520mma due to the varying period , thus making them less plausible .",
    "it is crucial to note that the best fit to the amplitudes from the 19 long runs suggests that the amplitude stayed constant at about 29mma , making a significant variation in amplitude unlikely .",
    "secondly , the amplitude of the combined dft computed from the real data is 28.8mma ( see table [ bfit - per ] ) , at par with the individual amplitude measurements .",
    "this strongly suggests that a substantial change in period during the 11-day campaign is also unlikely , as otherwise we would have observed a lower amplitude in the combined dft shown in figure [ dft ] compared to the nightly amplitude measurements .",
    "the low order functions we adopted above were meant to provide a realistic idea of how the period and amplitude could change over the duration of the campaign .",
    "however none of our simulations with these functions could produce a triplet that matched the observed triplet with its spacing and high amplitude . for a fraction of the simulations that seemed plausible due to a reasonably high amplitude principal component",
    ", we also used the pre - whitening and least squares analysis code to determine the individual frequency components .",
    "for all of these cases , a simultaneous 3-frequency fit to the entire light curve using the non - linear least squares program failed to converge .",
    "this is encouraging as the lack of convergence apparently implies that the non - linear least squares program has the ability to distinguish between a single variable period and a multiplet .",
    "since we are unable to run a successful simulation where a single variable period mimics a triplet while being constrained by the observed criteria , we can only conclude that this possibility is not very likely .",
    "however we do recognize that we can only carry out a finite number of simulations and scenarios , and therefore our simulations do not completely rule out the possibility that a variable periodicity could mimic a triplet .",
    "we strongly recommend another campaign on this star to see if a triplet with exactly identical components is observed again , and whether the future data stay in phase with the observations presented here .    as a last step , we also simulated a light curve for a triplet using the best - fit periods , amplitudes , and phases listed in table [ bfit - per ] .",
    "we isolated 19 segments from the light curve corresponding to the 19 long runs discussed earlier .",
    "then we determined the value of the period and amplitude of the dominant frequency for those 19 simulated runs ; we indicate these values in figure [ dm2 ] and show the corresponding observed values for comparison .",
    "this exercise helps us understand what fluctuations in period and amplitude we can expect to see for the triplet model when we fit a single frequency to runs shorter than the duration needed to resolve the triplet .",
    "this also explains why @xcite and @xcite measure different values of the dominant period in sdss1610 - 0102 .",
    "any significant departure from the triplet model would pose as evidence in favour of a variable period model .",
    "apart from a single point close to the 17th of may , there is no significant deviation in period from the triplet model .",
    "the observed amplitudes on 17th and 18th of may also do not match the expected amplitudes due to the triplet model . despite these points ,",
    "we conclude that the triplet model matches the observed values well within the uncertainties , and is most probably correct .",
    "the accreting pulsator gw  librae also showed unresolved multiplet structure @xcite with 1@xmath28hz splitting for the 370s and 650s modes . @xcite found similar unresolved multiplet structure for the 336.7s mode of the accreting pulsator v455  and ( hs2331 + 3905 ) .",
    "thus the multiplet spacing we observe for sdss1610 - 0102  is neither unique nor unusual for accreting white dwarf pulsators ; however this is the first data set in which a multiplet has been cleanly resolved .",
    "each of the pulsation eigenmodes that can be excited in the star is typically described by a set of indices : @xmath31 , @xmath32 , & @xmath24 .",
    "the radial quantum number @xmath31 gives the number of nodes in the radial eigenfunction , and @xmath32 and @xmath24 index the spherical harmonic @xmath33 function forming the angular dependence of the mode .",
    "spherical harmonics ( @xmath34 ) are used to describe these eigenmodes due to the spherical gravitational potential ; this quantization is similar to the quantum numbers used to describe the state of an electron bound by the spherical electrostatic potential of the nucleus .",
    "these non - radial motions penetrate below the surface with reducing amplitude ; the radial eigenfunction , which depends on @xmath31 and mode trapping , dictates the pulsation amplitude at different depths .",
    "montgomery & winget ( 1999 ) and montgomery , metcalfe , & winget ( 2003 ) showed that pulsations probe up to the inner 99% of a model white dwarf .",
    "multiplets in pulsation modes indicate a loss of spherical symmetry , caused by either stellar rotation or a magnetic field @xcite . in the absence of a prominent magnetic field or rotation , normal modes with different @xmath24 values",
    "will have the same frequency , although they represent different fluid motion patterns .",
    "according to @xcite , frequency splitting in the presence of a magnetic field is given by the following equation :    @xmath35    where the frequency shift @xmath36 depends on @xmath37 for a dipole magnetic field .",
    "hence a given mode splits into @xmath38 frequencies with uneven spacing .",
    "a triplet caused by a magnetic field would require @xmath39 , and the individual components of the multiplet would have @xmath24 values of 0 , 1 , & 2 .",
    "such a triplet could not be evenly spaced because the frequency shift of each component depends on @xmath37 .",
    "since the observed 609s triplet is evenly spaced within uncertainties , we conclude that it is not caused by a magnetic field .",
    "the even spacing of the 609s triplet is consistent with rotational splitting . in light of the remarkable implications this may have for the rotational properties of the star ,",
    "a more careful discussion of the significance of this result is necessary .",
    "since the ratio of the frequency splitting to the central frequency for this triplet is small , it should be safe to use perturbation analysis to linear order , except possibly in the case of differential rotation .",
    "@xcite show that the frequency splitting due to rotation in linear perturbation theory is given by :    @xmath40    where @xmath8 denotes the frequency in the rotating star , @xmath41 the frequency of the corresponding mode in a non - rotating star ( with the same @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath24 ) , and @xmath42 denotes the solid body angular rotation frequency .",
    "the uniform rotation co - efficient @xmath43 depends on the radial and azimuthal order ( @xmath44 ) , while @xmath45 , relevant for non - uniform or differential rotation , also depends on @xmath46 .",
    "initially ignoring the term @xmath45 allows us to arrive at a basic constraint on the rotation of the star , but we will revisit differential rotation below .",
    "uniform rotation splits a mode of azimuthal quantum number @xmath32 into @xmath47 evenly spaced modes .",
    "@xcite showed that in the limit of high radial order @xmath48 , the co - efficient @xmath43 can be simplified as follows :    @xmath49    using the mode structure of gw lib as a guide @xcite , the 609s mode likely has @xmath50 and so qualifies marginally for the above approximation .",
    "this formalism makes it possible to obtain a gross estimate for the implied spin period of the white dwarf .",
    "the spacing of the components of the 609s triplet are 1.13@xmath00.11@xmath28hz and 1.278@xmath00.085@xmath28hz respectively .",
    "this spacing is consistent with being even within uncertainties , and we adopt the spacing of 1.2@xmath00.14@xmath28hz . assuming that we are seeing the @xmath51 components of an @xmath52 mode , the implied spin period is @xmath53days .",
    "if even approximately correct , the spin period of 4.8 days is remarkably long for an object accreting matter in a binary with an orbital period of 83.8 minutes .",
    "the implied rotational velocity for a period of 4.8days would be @xmath541km / s as opposed to the typical rotational velocities of 300400km / s observed for non - magnetic accreting white dwarfs @xcite .",
    "the measured surface velocity ( vsini ) for the cataclysmic variables vw hyi is  600km / s @xcite , wz sge is  200400km / s @xcite , and u gem is  50100km / s @xcite .",
    "@xcite find the rotation period of the zz  ceti  star g226 - 29 to be 8.9hr , while @xcite compute the rotation period of zz  ceti  itself to be 1.5 days ; all known zz  ceti  stars are non - magnetic . whether they pulsate or not , non - interacting white dwarfs in general are known to rotate slowly @xcite .    alternatively , perhaps the splitting of the 609s mode is only indicative of the rotation period of the region of the star that it samples well . in other words ,",
    "we examine the possibility of differential rotation with a rapidly rotating exterior and a slowly rotating interior .",
    "@xcite find that the accreted angular momentum is shared with the accumulated envelope on short timescales .",
    "given the small splitting , any differential rotation must be small or constrained to a very localized layer of the star ( e.g. the surface ) .",
    "this again provides strong constraints on any diffusive mechanism for angular momentum transport .",
    "evaluating the constraints quantitatively requires defining both the mode eigenfunctions and candidate rotation profiles , as well as how the rotational shear depends on latitude .",
    "such an extensive theoretical analysis is beyond the scope of this observational paper , but will be pursued in the near future by members of our collaboration .",
    "such a long spin period of 4.8 days derived from the triplet spacing can not be discounted out of hand . while white dwarfs gaining matter are thought to spin up ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , those undergoing classical novae are thought to eject any accreted mass ( see discussion in @xcite ) or lose small quantities of mass based on the abundance in their ejecta ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "therefore these objects have ample opportunity , depending on how angular momentum is exchanged between the accreted envelope and core , to either gain or shed angular momentum and allow the core to spin up or down over the several gyr accretion history of old cataclysmic variables like sdss1610 - 0102 .",
    "@xcite propose a model in which the primary white dwarf loses accreted angular momentum during nova outbursts .",
    "the demonstration by @xcite of how internal gravity waves can extract angular momentum from the solar core during its evolution might provide a model for how the core of an accreting white dwarf could be spun down , with the angular momentum carried away with the envelopes over many nova ejections .",
    "the transport of angular momentum in stably stratified layers within stars remains poorly understood .",
    "diffusive prescriptions , even ones which depend on magnetic effects like that of @xcite used by @xcite , are contradicted by the observed rotational profile of the sun @xcite .",
    "despite having been spun down on the main sequence , there is no observed gradient in the rotation profile of the solar core , an essential aspect of angular momentum transport in any diffusive prescription .",
    "additionally such prescriptions predict rotation periods much shorter than those observed for isolated non - magnetic white dwarfs @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that a radial magnetic field in a partially crystallized white dwarf would be sheared by differential rotation , leading to an increase in the azimuthal component proportional to the cumulative angle of differential rotation .",
    "he also indicated that when the field strength reached about @xmath55 gauss , the star would be locked as a rigid rotator .",
    "@xcite also demonstrate the need for a magnetic field for rigid body rotation in a white dwarf .",
    "perhaps in the context of sdss1610 - 0102 this implies that its magnetic field is weak .",
    "we conducted a multi - site campaign on the accreting pulsator sdss1610 - 0102  for a duration of 11 days using seven observatories around the globe in may 2007 .",
    "the photometric periods in our light curve were consistent with previous observations from 2004 and 2005 @xcite , indicating their long - term stability .",
    "the most interesting result from our multi - site campaign is the detection of a resolved evenly spaced pulsational triplet at 609s .",
    "the even spacing of the triplet suggests that it is induced by rotation , and the rotational period of 4.8 days derived from the spacing has strong implications for the transport of angular momentum and its long - term evolution .",
    "we investigated the possibility that variability of period and/or amplitude in a single frequency light curve could produce the observed triplet , and find that this is not a likely possibility .",
    "either the period of 4.8 days is a measure of the uniform rotation period for the entire star or it is suggestive of differential rotation in the star . in either case , the prospects of constraining rotation in an accreting white dwarf with asteroseismic techniques is immensely exciting . conducting similar multi - site campaigns on other accreting pulsators could help us form a picture of how angular momentum is exchanged in the interior of the white dwarf , and its significance from the perspective of binary evolution and stability .",
    "the rotation of the underlying white dwarf is also important for type ia supernovae ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "our spectroscopic measurement of the orbital period is 83.8@xmath02.9min is consistent within uncertainties with the photometrically observed first harmonic of the orbital period at 41.5min .",
    "our second striking result is the detection of linear combination frequencies apparently caused by an interplay of the dominant pulsation mode at 609s and the first harmonic of the orbital period .",
    "such a physical interaction between nonradial pulsation and orbital motion has never been detected before for variable white dwarfs , and is perhaps suggestive of tides .",
    "a thorough investigation is left to a future theoretical paper .",
