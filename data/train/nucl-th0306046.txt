    "one of the key signatures of the formation of thermalized hot and dense matter , such as a quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) , in relativistic heavy - ion collisions is collective transverse flow , driven by the transverse pressure gradients between the center of the hot collision fireball and the surrounding vacuum .",
    "the space - time evolution of this collective flow can be described by relativistic hydrodynamics . in the limit of zero",
    "mean free path ( i.e. when microscopic scattering rates exceed any macroscopically relevant time scale ) the system can be described as an ideal fluid neglecting transport effects such as viscosity and heat conduction .",
    "the flow observed in the final state via analysis of the single - particle spectra of emitted hadrons can then be directly related to the initial conditions of the collision fireball when it first thermalized , and to the equation of state @xmath0 of the expanding matter .    in non - central collisions",
    "the initial conditions are anisotropic , due to the spatial deformation of the nuclear overlap region in the transverse plane , resulting in anisotropic pressure gradients which ultimately lead to anisotropies in the final momentum distributions .",
    "the momentum anisotropies can be quantified by the coefficients @xmath1 of an azimuthal fourier decomposition of the transverse momentum distributions .",
    "these coefficients , in particular the _ elliptic flow coefficient _ @xmath2 , grow only as long as anisotropies in the spatial pressure gradients persist . since the reaction zone quickly evolves from its initial spatially deformed state towards a more cylindrical shape without significant anisotropies ,",
    "the growth of @xmath2 is restricted to the earliest stages of the fireball expansion @xcite . even in the absence of interactions among the fireball constituents",
    "the spatial anisotropy which could drive the build - up of elliptic flow decays quickly , due to radial free - streaming of the matter @xcite .",
    "delayed thermalization therefore manifests itself in reduced elliptic flow since @xmath2 then has to build on smaller anisotropies in the pressure gradients .",
    "if thermalization happens quickly , elliptic flow builds up earlier and reaches larger values .",
    "the resulting stronger flow into the reaction plane @xcite destroys the spatial deformation even faster than free - streaming , resulting in an early saturation of the momentum anisotropy after about 5 fm/@xmath3 in semiperipheral au+au collisions at rhic @xcite . for a given initial deformation",
    "( i.e. a fixed impact parameter ) the saturation value of @xmath2 has been shown to be a monotonic function of the microscopic scattering cross section @xcite , reaching a strict upper limit given by ideal fluid hydrodynamics in the limit of zero mean free path .",
    "the fact that the elliptic flow measured at rhic almost exhausts this hydrodynamic limit ( for an extensive list of references i refer to the recent review @xcite ) is at this point the strongest available evidence for early thermalization ( at @xmath4fm/@xmath3 @xcite ) and , together with an estimated energy density @xmath5gev/@xmath6 at this early time @xcite , strongly suggests the formation of a well - thermalized qgp with significant ( 57fm/@xmath3 ) lifetime @xcite .",
    "we have demonstrated elsewhere @xcite that the bulk of the observed hadrons from au+au collisions at rhic ( i.e. all mesons in the region @xmath7gev/@xmath3 and all baryons at @xmath8gev/@xmath3 ) behave hydronymically , i.e. that their single particle spectra and momentum anisotropies in central and semicentral collisions with impact parameter @xmath9fm can all be quantitatively reproduced by relativistic ideal fluid hydrodynamics with a common kinetic decoupling temperature .",
    "in section 2 i supplement this finding by pointing out that the same holds true even for the heavy @xmath10 and @xmath11 hyperons , in contrast to earlier expectations based on their presumed weaker coupling to the expanding pion fluid during the late hadronic expansion stage @xcite .",
    "it has also been noted @xcite that the hydrodynamic model does much more poorly in its description of the two - particle bose - einstein ( hanbury brown twiss or hbt ) correlations , by overpredicting the longitudinal and outward hbt radii while underpredicting the sideward radius and its transverse momentum dependence ( the `` rhic hbt puzzle '' ) . in section 3 i show how hbt studies as function of the azimuthal emission angle can constrain the space - time evolution of the _ spatial _ deformation in non - central collisions , thereby supplementing the information from the measured momentum - space anisotropies and constraining the total duration of the expansion phase . preliminary rhic data from 2-pion correlations @xcite agree with the hydrodynamic prediction @xcite that at kinetic freeze - out the fireball is ( on average ) still slightly out - of - plane elongated , although much less so than initially .",
    "this is expected to change at lhc energies where the much higher initial energy density allows the elliptic flow to act for a significantly longer time period until decoupling , leading to pion emission from an ( on average ) in - plane elongated source .",
    "the hbt signatures of such an in - plane elongation are discussed in section 3 .",
    "when shortly after the beginning of the experimental program at rhic in 2000 the first data on the total charged particle multiplicity in central au+au became available @xcite , peter kolb , pasi huovinen and i used this to constrain the initial conditions for the hydrodynamic model in central conditions and to predict hadron spectra and their anisotropies for non - central collisions @xcite . some of these predictions are shown in fig .",
    "the three sets of curves correspond , from top to bottom , to central ( @xmath12fm ) , semiperipheral ( @xmath13fm ) and peripheral ( @xmath14fm ) au+au collisions at @xmath15gev . at that time",
    "no spectra were available yet to fix the freeze - out temperature , so we estimated it to probably lie between 120 and 140 mev ( solid and dashed curves , respectively ) .",
    "we later learned @xcite that @xmath16mev fits the pion and proton data from central collisions best .",
    "for the @xmath10 hyperons in the lower right panel we also included a prediction for freeze - out directly after hadronization at @xmath17mev , motivated by the prevailing prejudice @xcite that , due to their lack of resonant scattering with pions , they would not be able to efficiently pick up    any additional transverse flow generated in the hadronic phase .",
    "this expectation was supported by observations by the wa97 collaboration at the sps @xcite which indicated a smaller slope parameter for @xmath10 and @xmath11 than for other hadrons .",
    "it was only recently realized that this evidence was at least partially distorted by fitting a curved @xmath10 spectrum in a limited @xmath18 region by a simple exponential .",
    "recent na49 data for @xmath10 and @xmath11 at smaller @xmath18 show evidence that the spectra bend over at low @xmath18 and seem to be consistent with much larger radial flow than previously thought , almost as strong as that experienced by pions and nucleons @xcite .",
    "figure  [ f1 ] shows that the same is true at rhic : the @xmath10 spectra from au+au collisions at @xmath19 and 200@xmath20gev @xcite are consistent with the hydrodynamic predictions if they are assumed to freeze out at the same decoupling temperature @xmath21mev as pions , kaons and ( anti)protons , while they are much too flat to be compatible with freeze - out already at @xmath22 , i.e. directly after hadronization .",
    "it is impossible to generate enough radial flow for the @xmath10s already before hadronization , without destroying the agreement of the model with all other hadron spectra and/or lowering the hadronization temperature significantly below 165mev ( which would contradict lattice qcd results ) .",
    "we conclude that the @xmath10 hyperons seem to be much more strongly coupled to the expanding pion fluid during the late hadronic stage than previously thought .",
    "it will be interesting to explore the microscopic mechanisms responsible for such a strong coupling .",
    "the observational constraints on dynamical models for the evolution of the heavy - ion reaction zone can be further tightened by a simultaneous analysis of the single - particle momentum spectra with 2-particle momentum correlations .",
    "the latter provide access to the space - time structure of the source at kinetic freeze - out . more specifically , in the case of bose - einstein correlations between identical bosons , the gaussian widths @xmath23 of the correlation function @xmath24 $ ] are linear combinations of the components of the spatial correlation tensor @xmath25(\\bm{k})$ ] which characterize the space - time widths of the source emission function @xmath26 at freeze - out .",
    "for the general case these relations can be found in @xcite ; for longitudinally boost - invariant sources and pions at midrapidity @xmath27 they simplify to @xmath28 for simplicity the dependence of the spatial correlation tensor @xmath29 on the pair momentum @xmath30 ( in particular its _ implicit _ dependence on the azimuthal emission angle @xmath31 of @xmath30 relative to the reaction plane ) has been dropped , and only the _ explicit _ @xmath31-dependence arising from the azimuthal rotation between the outward direction @xmath32 and the reaction plane coordinate @xmath33 is exhibited . for small transverse pair momenta @xmath34 this explicit @xmath31-dependence dominates @xcite . the source widths @xmath29 are specified in coordinates @xmath35 parallel and perpendicular to the reaction plane while the correlation function is measured in @xmath36 coordinates defined by the directions parallel and perpendicular to @xmath37 .",
    "@xmath38 is the transverse pair velocity .",
    "the terms @xmath39 and @xmath40 vanish due to the assumed longitudinal boost - invariance .",
    "the orientation of the reaction plane in the laboratory system can be determined event - by - event from the elliptic flow .",
    "the correlation function can thus be measured as a function of the azimuthal emission angle @xmath31 relative to the reaction plane . for non - central collisions",
    "the spatial deformation of the source in the transverse plane leads to oscillations as a function of @xmath31 . in practice",
    "the finite angular bin size and reaction plane resolution smear these azimuthal oscillations and reduce their measured amplitudes , but this can be fully corrected for in a model - independent way @xcite .",
    "general symmetries ensure that the hbt radii extracted from a gaussian fit to the thus corrected correlation function exhibit the following general @xmath31-dependences @xcite : @xmath41 for sources without longitudinal boost - invariance @xmath42 and @xmath42 oscillate around zero with cosines and sines , respectively , of _ odd _ multiples of @xmath31 @xcite . the relations ( [ 24 ] ) continue to hold true for correlation measurements made in a finite symmetric window around @xmath43 .",
    "figure  [ f2 ] shows the momentum - integrated hydrodynamic emission function for rhic- and lhc - type initial conditions .",
    "the curves labelled `` rhic1 '' correspond to the same initial conditions which led to a successful description of the single - particle momentum spectra and elliptic flow in 130@xmath20gev au+au collisions .",
    "one sees that , when integrated over all momenta and all emission times , this source is still out - of - plane elongated , although only very slightly .",
    "`` ipes '' labels an in - plane - elongated source obtained by starting the hydrodynamics earlier at a higher initial temperature of 2gev @xcite . in this case",
    "the source lives longer , grows much bigger and changes its initial out - of - plane elongation into a significant in - plane elongation at freeze - out .",
    "the vertical and horizontal cuts in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ f2 ] show that both sources are very `` opaque '' in that most particles are emitted from the ( deformed ) surface .",
    "a differential analysis shows @xcite that only pions with small transverse momenta come from the interior of the source ; they are thus the only ones which probe the overall spatial deformation of the source in the transverse plane .",
    "pions with non - zero transverse momenta , on the other hand , come from thin slivers near the edge of the fireball in the emission direction ( for details see @xcite ) ; they do not directly probe the overall shape of the source .",
    "figure  [ f3 ] shows the azimuthal oscillations of the four non - vanishing hbt radius parameters for several values of @xmath34 , calculated from these emission functions .",
    "the opposite spatial deformation of the rhic1 and ipes sources is reflected in the opposite signs of the oscillations for @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 at @xmath47 .",
    "for example , at rhic energies @xmath44 oscillates downward , implying a larger sideward radius when viewed from the @xmath48 direction ( i.e. within the reaction plane ) than from the @xmath49-direction ( i.e. perpendicular to the reaction plane ) .",
    "for the in - plane elongated source ( ipes ) some of the oscillation amplitudes change sign at larger transverse momenta .",
    "this change of sign originates from an intricate interplay between geometric , dynamical and temporal aspects of the source at freeze - out @xcite and reinforces the statement that at @xmath50 the hbt correlations do _ not _ probe the entire source and its spatial shape .",
    "preliminary star data on azimuthal oscillations of the hbt radii @xcite confirm the oscillation pattern in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ f3 ] but disagree with the one shown in the right panel .",
    "this suggests that hydrodynamics gets the overall duration of the expansion stage about right , since significantly longer times until freeze - out should cause the source to reverse the sign of its spatial deformation .",
    "more quantitative statements have to await a resolution of the above - mentioned `` hbt puzzle '' in central collisions .",
    "the significance of the @xmath34-dependence of the oscillation amplitudes for the hbt radius parameters is still largely unexplored . from the analysis of central collisions",
    "@xcite it is known that the @xmath31-averaged transverse hbt radii ( in particular @xmath51 ) exhibit stronger @xmath34 dependence for sources with a sharp surface ( such as the hydrodynamic one obtained from the cooper - frye prescription ) than for gaussian sources .",
    "one might expect similarly strong differences for the @xmath34-dependence of the oscillation amplitudes in non - central collisions .",
