    "nuclear physics has always been plagued with difficulties and ambiguities related to off - shellness of two - body forces and the inclusion of many - body forces deduced from the existence of equivalent hamiltonians  @xcite . in a remarkable paper glckle and polyzou  @xcite point out that both problems are actually intertwined since `` different off - shell extensions of two - body forces can be equivalently realized as three - body interactions '' and while `` there are no experiments measuring only three - body binding energies and phase shifts that can determine if there are no three - body forces in a three - body system '' it is still likely that `` there may be some systems for which it is possible to find a representation in which three - body forces are not needed '' .",
    "however , triton and @xmath1-particle _ ab initio _ calculations ( see e.g.  @xcite for a review ) using 2-body high quality interactions , i.e. constrained to fit nn scattering data with @xmath2 display exceedingly simple regularities , such as the tjon line , a linear correlation between the binding energies , @xmath3 within a relatively wide range of energies ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : tjon ] ) .",
    "this suggests the onset of some scale invariance  @xcite and the understanding of this correlation should also provide a credible value for the slope of the tjon line .",
    "actually , there is much freedom in making unitary transformations keeping the two body bound and continuum spectrum while generating a wide range of three- and four - body properties .",
    "a practical way to generate these transformations is by means of the similarity renormalization group ( srg ) proposed by gazek and wilson  @xcite and independently by wegner  @xcite .",
    "the srg was first used within nuclear physics by bogner , furnstahl and perry  @xcite .",
    "we discuss how the above mentioned regularities could be understood within a srg context by analysing its infrared fixed points as we discussed previously  @xcite .",
    "the proposed scenario is free of ambiguites but indicates a predominant role played by 3-body forces even in triton and alpha nuclei .",
    "the general srg equation corresponds to a one - parameter operator evolution dynamics given by  @xcite , @xmath4,h_s ] \\label{eq : srg}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and supplemented with an initial condition at @xmath5 , @xmath6 . with the exception of some few cases  @xcite",
    "these equations are mostly solved numerically  @xcite , by implementing a high momentum uv cut - off , @xmath7 , and an infrared momentum cut - off @xmath8 , which reduces the analysis to the finite @xmath9-dimensional case with @xmath10 .",
    "the isospectrality of the srg becomes evident from the trace invariance @xmath11 .",
    "fixed points of eq .",
    "( [ eq : srg ] ) are given by stationary solutions , @xmath12,h_s]=0 $ ] requiring @xmath13 = f(h_s)$ ] .",
    "thus there exists a basis where both @xmath14 and @xmath15 can be simultaneously block - diagonal for different energy subspaces with dimension equal the degeneracy .",
    "the question is what choices of @xmath14 actually drive the solution to this block - diagonal form",
    ". we will assume the usual separation @xmath16 . for generators which have the property @xmath17 , and using cyclic properties of the trace and the invariance of @xmath18 one gets @xmath19)^\\dagger ( i[g_s , h_s ] ) \\le 0 \\ , .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] because @xmath20 is positive but its derivative is negative the limit for @xmath21 exists and corresponds to the fixed points , i.e. any starting @xmath6 gets indeed diagonalized by the srg equations  ( [ eq : srg ] ) .",
    "thus , the srg equation are just a continuous way of diagonalizing @xmath6 .",
    "the key point is that there are many ways to diagonalize a hamiltonian .",
    "for an n - dimensional space there are @xmath22 possible permutations regarding the final _ ordering _ of states .",
    "there are two complementary generator choices : @xmath23 by wegner  @xcite and by gazeck and wilson  @xcite @xmath24 .",
    "more generally @xmath25  @xcite , describes a different trajectory but identical fixed points .",
    "a choice in between is the block - diagonal generator @xmath26 in two complementary subspaces with @xmath27  @xcite . denoting by @xmath28 the hamiltonian and @xmath29 the kinetic energy eigenvalues ,",
    "the stability analysis  @xcite can be extended to show that ( @xmath30 is some suitable matrix encoding the initial @xmath6 )    @xmath31    therefore , while _ all _ @xmath22 fixed points are stable in the wegner case , in the wilson case there is a unique fixed point where the hamiltonian preserves the original ordering of states according to the kinetic energy since @xmath32 .",
    "the emerging crossing structure will be discussed in more detail in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the previous considerations answer the question of _ how _ similar are two given hamiltonians in terms of the frobenius scalar product , norm and induced metric , latexmath:[\\ ] ] which can be interpreted in terms of the number of pairs in the @xmath45 and @xmath57 states being @xmath60 for triton and @xmath61 for @xmath51he . within this shell model scheme @xmath62 . for @xmath63",
    "the deuteron is unbound by @xmath64 , and the binding energy obtained for the triton is @xmath65 to be compared with the exact faddeev equation result @xmath66 whereas the @xmath1-particle yields @xmath67 .",
    "it is interesting to analyze the srg evolution from these @xmath63 values down to @xmath68 _ without _ 3-body or 4-body forces , i.e. taking @xmath48 .",
    "one can show  @xcite that for the variational shell model @xmath69 which is checked by the numerical calculation ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : binding ] ) .",
    "we also find linear correlations in two regimes @xmath70 if we now switch on the srg induced 3-body and 4-body forces , the difference of the on - shell result to the original value corresponds to the off - shellnes of the @xmath63 two body potential , @xmath71 neglecting @xmath72 and taking @xmath73 corresponding to 4 triplets in the @xmath1-particle ( see also  @xcite ) we get @xmath74 which gives @xmath75 .",
    "of course , one may say the @xmath50h = pnn contain 2 deuterons and @xmath51he = ppnn contains 4 deuterons , so that @xmath76 . in general , we may write @xmath77 and @xmath78 and hence @xmath79 most calculations in nuclear physics use a mean field reference state ( often ho shell model ) upon which correlations are built .",
    "for instance , in ref .  @xcite it is found that the number of _ correlated pairs _ is given by @xmath80,@xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 with @xmath84 which , from our eq .",
    "( [ eq : pair - triplet ] ) , requires @xmath85 and then @xmath86 .",
    "these tjon lines are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : tjon ] using the different choices in eq .",
    "( [ eq : pair - triplet ] ) and compared with several accurate calculations using realistic 2-body forces ( without 3- or 4-body forces )  @xcite . in our interpretation , the slope of the tjon line is just the number of _ correlated triplets _ in @xmath51he , @xmath87 for _ on - shell _ interactions .",
    "these intriguing results suggest that @xmath88 and will be analysed in more detail elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "srg methods allow to reduce the two - body off - shell ambiguity _",
    "completely _ when the infrared limit is taken and thus only _ measurable _ two - body information is needed .",
    "the same observation applies to multi - body interactions , and while current calculations fix the three body force from the triton binding energy , more work is required to pin down how much three - body measurable input would actually be demanded within such an on - shell scheme .",
    "however , using these ideas a simple explanation of the observed linear tjon correlations between the @xmath1-particle and triton binding energies emerges from purely combinatorial arguments . in this scheme",
