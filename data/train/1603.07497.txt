    "we first show that theorem [ theo : perm ] follows easily from results of goldstein @xcite .",
    "if @xmath6 is an affine map of the form ( [ defg ] ) , then it follows from theorem a that there is a transcendental entire function  that permutes with @xmath6 .",

    "since there exists @xmath35 such that @xmath36 , it follows that @xmath37 is undefined , so @xmath38 is also undefined by ( [ eq : perm ] ) . since @xmath1 is rational , we deduce that @xmath39 .",

    "we now give the proof of theorem [ theo : permk ] , our main generalisation of theorem  a. the proof uses certain ideas from iteration theory .",
    "we denote the _ iterates _ of the function @xmath3 by @xmath40 , for @xmath41 .",

    "we refer to @xcite , for example , for the properties of this set and an introduction to complex dynamics .",
    "if @xmath6 is a mbius map that is either parabolic or conjugate to a rational rotation , then it follows from theorem  a that there is an element of @xmath0 , conjugate to a transcendental entire function , that permutes with @xmath6 .    if @xmath6 is a mbius map that is neither parabolic nor conjugate to a rotation , then it is conjugate to a map of the form @xmath43 , for some @xmath44 with @xmath45 . without loss of generality",
    ", we can assume that @xmath6 is of this form .",
    "we construct a function @xmath34 that permutes with @xmath6 as follows . replacing @xmath46 with @xmath47 if necessary , we assume that @xmath48 .",
    "let @xmath49 be the function @xmath50 and let @xmath51    we claim that the ( double ) series in ( [ nicefun ] ) defines a function which is meromorphic in @xmath52 , but in no larger domain in @xmath12 . in particular @xmath31 , but @xmath5 is not a transcendental meromorphic function .",
    "since @xmath5 permutes with the maps @xmath43 and @xmath53 , this will complete the first part of the proof .",
    "to prove the claim , suppose that @xmath54 .",
    "let @xmath55 be a neighbourhood of @xmath56 sufficiently small that @xmath57 .",
    "since @xmath48 , it can be seen that there exists @xmath58 such that , for all @xmath59 , we have @xmath60 it follows by the weierstrass m  test that @xmath5 restricted to @xmath55 can be written as the sum of two analytic functions and a rational function , and so @xmath5 is meromorphic in @xmath55 . hence @xmath5 is indeed meromorphic in @xmath52 , since @xmath56 was arbitrary .",
    "moreover , the poles of @xmath5 are easily seen to be the points @xmath61 , for @xmath62 .",
    "since these points accumulate on @xmath63 , it follows that @xmath5 can not be meromorphic in a neighbourhood of either zero or infinity .",
    "this completes the proof of our claim .",
    "it remains to prove the ` only if ' direction of theorem [ theo : permk ] .",
    "suppose that @xmath1 is any non - constant rational map and that @xmath64 permutes with @xmath65 we consider separately the cases where @xmath10 has one , two , or more than two points .",
    "first suppose that @xmath10 is a singleton .",
    "without loss of generality , we can assume that @xmath66 .",
    "then @xmath5 is a transcendental meromorphic function , so it follows from theorem  [ theo : perm ] that @xmath6 is an affine map of the form ( [ defg ] ) , and thus is a mbius map that is not conjugate to an irrational rotation .",
    "suppose next that @xmath10 has two elements .",
    "if there exists @xmath67 such that @xmath68 , then @xmath69 has more than two elements , so we can replace @xmath5 with @xmath70 .",
    "it follows that we can assume that both elements of @xmath10 are omitted values , and without loss of generality take @xmath71 thus @xmath5 is a _ transcendental self - map of the punctured plane_. it was pointed out by rdstrm @xcite that such maps are necessarily of the form @xmath72 where @xmath62 and @xmath73 are entire functions .",
    "if @xmath74 is large , then @xmath5 behaves like the transcendental entire function @xmath75 .",
    "it is straightforward to show that the techniques of @xcite can also be applied in this situation with the same result ; we omit the detail .    finally , consider the case where @xmath10 has at least three elements .",
    "we first show that any rational map @xmath1 that permutes with @xmath3 is a mbius map .",
    "suppose , by way of contradiction , that the degree of @xmath1 is at least two .",
    "we deduce by picard s great theorem and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 4.1.2 ) that there exists @xmath76 such that @xmath77 and the set @xmath78 is infinite .",
    "suppose that @xmath79 and that @xmath80 .",
    "since @xmath70 and @xmath81 permute , it follows that @xmath82 is undefined , and so @xmath83 . we deduce that @xmath84    it follows from ( [ e1 ] ) , and ( * ? ? ? * theorem 4.2.7 ) that @xmath85 contains the julia set of  @xmath1 .",
    "since ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 4.2.4 ) the julia set of @xmath1 is uncountable and @xmath69 is closed and countable , this is a contradiction , so it follows that @xmath1 is a mbius map .    to complete the proof , it is sufficient to show that @xmath1 is not of the form @xmath86 , where @xmath30 is irrational .",
    "if this holds , then @xmath87 , for @xmath88 . differentiating , we obtain a non - constant function @xmath89 with the property that @xmath90 , for @xmath88 .",
    "now choose a point @xmath91 .",
    "observe that @xmath92    since @xmath93 is irrational , the points @xmath94 , for @xmath95 , accumulate on the whole circle @xmath96 .",
    "this is a contradiction , since all these points are elements of @xmath97 , which can accumulate only on @xmath10 , and @xmath10 is countable .",
    "in ( * ? ? ? * theorem 3 ) , bergweiler and hinkkanen gave the following result on semiconjugation of entire functions , which is a generalisation of theorem b.    let @xmath3 and @xmath98 be entire functions such that @xmath3 is not a mbius map , and @xmath98 is not the identity map .",
    "then there are only countably many entire functions @xmath6 such that @xmath99    the method of proof of theorem c can readily be adapted to give the corresponding result for functions in the class @xmath0 :    [ theo : bhgen ] let @xmath100 be such that @xmath3 is not a mbius map , and @xmath98 is not the identity map",
    ". then there are only countably many @xmath101 such that ( [ eq : conj ] ) holds .",
    "bergweiler and hinkkanen s proof of theorem c uses the facts that , if @xmath41 and  @xmath3 is entire but is not a mbius map , then @xmath102 is also entire , and the repelling periodic points of @xmath3 are dense in the julia set @xmath103 , which is a non - empty perfect set . here",
    "a point @xmath104 is called _ periodic _ if there exists @xmath105 such that @xmath106 , and it is also called _ repelling _ if @xmath107 .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that , if @xmath34 is not a mbius map , then the julia set @xmath103 is a non - empty perfect set and that the repelling periodic points of @xmath3 are dense in @xmath103 . in this case",
    "@xmath103 is the set of points in @xmath42 at which either some iterate of @xmath3 is not defined , or the iterates @xmath108 are all defined but do not form a normal family .    these results on the properties of the julia set for functions in @xmath0",
    "are all that is needed to adapt the proof of theorem c and so prove theorem [ theo : bhgen ] .",
    "clearly , theorem [ theo : count ] then follows immediately . for completeness",

    "we will define a countable collection of subsets of @xmath0 , denoted by @xmath109 , for @xmath110 , and show that :    a.   every non - constant @xmath111 that satisfies ( [ eq : conj ] ) lies in @xmath112 for some @xmath113 , and [ p2 ] b.   for each @xmath114 , the set @xmath115 contains at most one element.[p1 ]    since there are at most countably many constant functions @xmath6 satisfying ( [ eq : conj ] ) ( because if @xmath116 then @xmath117 is a fixed point of @xmath98 ) , it is easy to see that theorem [ theo : bhgen ] then follows .    to define the sets @xmath115 , we consider the indices @xmath118 in turn .",
    "* for some @xmath119 , @xmath120 has a repelling fixed point , @xmath121 say .",

    "since @xmath132 , it follows from the properties of @xmath103 described above that , for each @xmath133 we can choose @xmath134 and @xmath135 such that @xmath136 .",
    "* now let @xmath137 be an enumeration of the repelling fixed points of @xmath138 .",
    "then we argue similarly that , for each @xmath139 , there is a disk @xmath140 centred at @xmath141 in which @xmath138 is defined and univalent , and such that a univalent branch @xmath142 of @xmath143 defined on @xmath140 fixes @xmath141 and maps @xmath140 into a relatively compact subset of itself , with @xmath144 uniformly as @xmath130 for @xmath145 .",
    "* finally , let @xmath146 be an enumeration of all the periodic points of @xmath147 .",
    "note that , for simplicity , we have assumed here that @xmath98 has infinitely many repelling fixed points and periodic points , but the argument remains valid in cases where there are only finitely many .    for each @xmath148",
    ", we now define @xmath149 to be the set of all non - constant @xmath111 that satisfy  ( [ eq : conj ] ) and are such that @xmath150 to see that property ( [ p2 ] ) holds , suppose that @xmath151 is non - constant .",
    "note that since @xmath152 it follows from ( [ eq : conj ] ) that @xmath153 is a fixed point of @xmath138 .",
    "moreover , by a calculation , @xmath154 is a _ repelling _ fixed point of @xmath138 , so there exists @xmath139 such that @xmath155 . by the continuity of @xmath6",
    ", there also exists @xmath156 sufficiently large that @xmath157 now @xmath158 , and by ( [ eq : conj ] ) we have @xmath159 so @xmath160 is a fixed point of @xmath161 ; in other words , there exists @xmath162 such that @xmath163 .",
    "thus @xmath164 .",
    "finally we show that property ( [ p1 ] ) also holds .",
    "fix @xmath114 , and assume that @xmath165 define @xmath166 and @xmath167 , for @xmath168 we claim that @xmath169 , for @xmath170 this is certainly true for @xmath171 , so suppose it is true for @xmath172 , for some @xmath173 the point @xmath174 is the unique solution in @xmath124 of the equation @xmath175 , so @xmath176 hence , by ( [ eq : conj ] ) , we have @xmath177 also , the point @xmath178 is the unique solution in @xmath140 of the equation @xmath179 .",
    "we deduce that @xmath180 which proves the claim .",
    "the same argument can be applied to @xmath181 , so we have @xmath182 for all @xmath183 since @xmath6 and @xmath181 are meromorphic , and @xmath184 is finite , we have @xmath185 by the identity principle .",
    "thus @xmath186 indeed contains at most one element .",
    "in this section we prove theorem  [ theo : onlytwo ] by giving two examples of transcendental meromorphic functions that are minimally permuting .",
    "the function in the first example has a simple form and the proof uses only elementary arguments .",
    "the second example involves a more complicated function and the proof uses a result from value distribution theory , but is very short .",
    "it seems worthwhile to give both examples .",
    "for the first example , let @xmath5 be given by @xmath187 this function has no fixed points , and so permutes with no constant functions . moreover , by an application of theorem  [ theo : perm ] and an elementary calculation , it can be shown that @xmath5 permutes with no rational maps apart from the identity map .",
    "let @xmath6 be a transcendental meromorphic function that permutes with @xmath5 ; we need to show that @xmath188 .",
    "note that zero is the only pole of @xmath5 , and it is of order one .",
    "it follows from ( [ eq : perm ] ) that zero is the only pole of @xmath1 .",
    "let @xmath189 denote the order of this pole of @xmath6 .",
    "let @xmath190 be a zero of @xmath5 , and let its order be @xmath191 .",
    "then @xmath190 is a pole of @xmath192 of order @xmath193 .",
    "it follows from ( [ eq : perm ] ) that @xmath190 is a pole of @xmath7 of order @xmath193 , and so @xmath190 is a zero of @xmath1 of order @xmath193 .",
    "similarly , let @xmath194 be a zero of @xmath1 , and let its order be @xmath195 .",
    "then @xmath194 is a pole of @xmath7 of order @xmath196 .",
    "it follows from ( [ eq : perm ] ) that @xmath194 is a pole of @xmath192 of order @xmath196 , and so @xmath194 is a zero of @xmath5 of order @xmath197 .",
    "we deduce that @xmath198 is a meromorphic function in @xmath199 with no poles or zeros , and thus there exists an entire function @xmath200 , with no zeros , such that @xmath201 we now show that @xmath202 and @xmath203 .",
    "to achieve this we consider the zeros of @xmath5 of large modulus .",
    "these points are the solutions of @xmath204 suppose that @xmath205 is such a point .",
