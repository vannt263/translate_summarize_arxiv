    "the subject of bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) has become tremendously active both experimentally and theoretically in the recent years due to the observation of bec in trapped atomic gases.@xcite another way of obtaining a bec , predicted theoretically some time ago , is to place a quasi one dimensional spin gap systems under a strong magnetic field@xcite causing the formation of a luttinger liquid of magnons .",
    "this luttinger liquid possesses a quasi - long range order , which is a one dimensional precursor of the bec.@xcite in the presence of any three dimensional coupling , this quasi - condensed state develops a long - range order , which corresponds to a bec of the magnons.@xcite this condensation has been observed experimentally @xcite in spin-1 chain materials , and more recently@xcite in cu@xmath0(c@xmath1h@xmath2n@xmath0)@xmath0cl@xmath3 ( cuhpcl ) , a material originally believed on the basis of its thermodynamics to be formed of weakly coupled two leg ladders .",
    "however , it is now known that cuhpcl is in fact formed of dimers coupled in a three - dimensional network@xcite , and that the bose condensation is a condensation of a two or three - dimensional magnon bose fluid.@xcite recently , such a bose - einstein condensation of magnons has also been observed in other coupled dimers systems such as @xmath4@xcite , @xmath5@xcite , @xmath6@xcite and @xmath7.@xcite theoretical description taking into account the two - dimensional nature of these gapped systems have been developed@xcite in recent years .",
    "they are based on the bond operator theory ( bot ) description of the coupled dimer system.@xcite the interactions between the condensed triplet bosons are treated by the hartree - fock - popov ( hfp ) approximation@xcite , and a rigid lattice is assumed . however , more recently , some experimental evidence for a lattice distortion associated with the bose einstein condensation has been obtained.@xcite older reports of specific heat anomalies also pointed out to a lattice distortion associated with the transition.@xcite it has thus been suggested that the distortion observed in experiments could be the generalized spin - peierls transition predicted originally for spin ladder systems under field.@xcite however , similarly to the conventional spin - peierls transition@xcite , in a generalized spin - peierls transition the lattice distortion results from an _ optical _ phonon becoming static . as a result , in the generalized spin - peierls transition , the lattice constants of the crystal do not change , but superlattice peaks are visible in x - ray diffraction , in contrast with experiments.@xcite in fact , in the case of a condensate of magnetic excitations coupled to a deformable lattice , another instability than the generalized spin - peierls transition is possible , namely magnetostriction .",
    "although magnetostriction has been mostly discussed in the context of ferromagnetism@xcite it can also be observed in paramagnetic or antiferromagnetic systems.@xcite in the case of magnetostriction , the lattice parameters change as the system becomes magnetized , but the number of atoms per unit cell does not change , which means that no new reflection appear in x - ray diffraction experiments.@xcite in a ferromagnet , magnetostriction is known to turn the second order curie transition into a first order transition.@xcite thus , the magnetostrictive effects may also explain the first order transition as a function of magnetic field observed in magnon bose - einstein condensation experiments.@xcite besides the bose - einstein condensation of magnons in spin gap systems , magnetostriction effects are also relevant near the saturation field in the spin-1/2 chain material cu(ii)-2,5bis(pyrazol-1-yl)-1,4-dihydroxybenzene ( cuccp).@xcite in fact , the two effects can be closely related as a ladder system under strong magnetic field can be mapped for strong rung coupling on an anisotropic spin-1/2 chain.@xcite in the present paper , we will discuss a model of magnetostriction in 1d xx spin chains coupled by 3d acoustic phonons .",
    "we will study the effect of phonon coupling at the mean field level and show that the bose einstein condensation transition of the magnons becomes a first order transition at low temperature .",
    "the origin of the first order character of the transition can be traced to the hardcore repulsion of the magnons , which prevents the collapse of the condensate .",
    "treatments based on hartree - fock - popov mean field theory neglect the hardcore constraint and thus fail in the regime where the first order transition is obtained .",
    "this stresses that a correct treatment of the hardcore constraint is necessary to describe the first order transition observed in experiments.@xcite    the plan of the paper is the following . in sec.[sec : model ] we introduce a model of an array of two leg ladders coupled with classical phonons as a minimal model for describe the bec in a system of hard core bosons coupled to a lattice deformation . from this model",
    "we deduce an effective xxz spin chain hamiltonian that can be rewritten in terms of a free fermion hamiltonian by the jordan - wigner transformation . in sec.[sec : zerot ] we focus on the zero temperature case . by a mean field theory",
    ", we discuss the first order phase transition at varying the external magnetic field and the pressure .",
    "in particular , we derive a ginzburg - landau expansion of the free energy valid for a very stiff lattice which allows an analytical discussion of the behavior of the magnetization and of the lattice parameter as a function of the magnetic field .",
    "we also calculate and discuss the behavior of various susceptibilities in the distorted case , such as the elastic modulus , the magnetic susceptibility and the magnetostriction coefficient that all present anomalies at the transition . in sec.[sec : finitet ] we turn to the positive temperature case and deduce first a ginzburg - landau expansion which allows us to predict the temperature above which the first order transition is replaced by a crossover .",
    "all the susceptibilities are then recalculated at finite temperature and some results compared to recent experiments.@xcite we also consider the behavior of the dilatation coefficient and of the specific heat . finally in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] we give the conclusions and perspectives for future work .",
    "in order to grasp the origin of the first order character of the bec in a spin gap system under field coupled to acoustic phonons , we want to build a model that can be solved with a minimum of approximation . we will start with a an array of two leg ladders coupled with classical phonons .",

    "the magnetic field @xmath27 plays the role of the chemical potential of the hardcore bosons .",

    "when @xmath27 is less negative , the density of hardcore bosons in the ground state becomes nonzero . as our system is one - dimensional , this leads to the formation of a quasi - bose condensate of hard - core bosons , in which the order parameter of the bose condensation @xmath29 possesses quasi - long range order in the ground state .",
    "hence , the transition between the spin gap state and the magnetized state in coupled dimer systems@xcite can be viewed as the bose condensation of hard core triplet bosons . in the case we are considering",

    "the origin of this unphysical behavior when the spin - phonon interaction becomes too strong is easily seen .",
    "the hfp approximation reduces the spin - phonon coupling to an effective attractive interaction between the bosons of order @xmath45 , and when this attraction overcomes the repulsion @xmath46 , the ground state of the mean - field hamiltonian becomes ill - defined .",

    "the modified hfp approximation suggests that first - order magnetostriction transition caused by the condensation of triplet excitations can be observed also in @xmath57 provided the spin - phonon interaction is strong enough .",
    "the preceding discussion suggests that in order to describe correctly the first order magnetostriction transition associated with the bose condensation of the triplets , we need to treat exactly the hardcore interaction of the triplets . in the quasi - one dimensional system of eq .",
    "( [ eq : ladder - strongcoupl ] ) , this can be done in principle exactly thanks to the integrability of the xxz spin chain@xcite .",

    "the free energy of the general xxz chain in the presence of magnetostriction have to be obtained from the thermodynamic bethe ansatz ( tba)@xcite .",

    "we expect that this mapping is not going to affect the qualitative properties of the chain under field .",
    "in fact , when the magnetization per site of the xxz chain is near saturation , i.e. when the density of triplet excitations created on the ladders is low , the effect of the short range interaction measured by @xmath64 becomes small .",
    "this is seen in particular in the behavior of the luttinger exponent @xmath10 which goes to @xmath65 in that low density limit@xcite .",
    "thus , we expect that the magnetostriction effects that happen near the transition between the singlet state and the polarized state will be properly described by the model  ( [ eq : ladder - strongcoupl ] ) with @xmath61 .",

    "<S> we consider an array of xx spin-1/2 chains coupled to acoustic phonons and placed in a magnetic field . treating the phonons in the mean field approximation , </S>",
    "<S> we show that this system presents a first order transition as a function of the magnetic field between a partially magnetized distorted state and the fully polarized undistorted state at low temperature . </S>",
    "<S> this behavior results from the magnetostriction of the coupled chain system . </S>",
    "<S> a dip in the elastic constant of the material near the saturation field along with an anomaly in the magnetic susceptibility is predicted . </S>",
    "<S> we also predict the contraction of the material as the magnetic field is reduced ( positive magnetostriction ) and the reciprocal effect i.e. a decrease of magnetization under applied pressure . at higher temperature , </S>",
    "<S> the first order transition is replaced by a crossover . however , the anomalies in the susceptibilities in the system near the saturation field are still present . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the relevance of our analysis in relation to recent experiments on spin-1/2 chain and ladder materials in high magnetic fields . </S>"
