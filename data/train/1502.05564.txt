    "fission is one of the dominant decay channels of the heaviest nuclei .",
    "physics of this process is crucial in determining stability of heavy and super - heavy isotopes .",
    "one of the basic observables of fission , obtained directly in experiment , is fragment mass distribution .",
    "measured yields allow to determine type of fission as well as to deduce the properties of the mother nucleus .",
    "prediction of the charge , mass and total kinetic energy ( tke ) distributions of fission fragments is still a challenging task for the theory of nuclear fission .",
    "a number of attempts have been made to describe mechanism of sharing nucleons between fission fragments since the spontaneous fission phenomenon was discovered .",
    "historically , in the first theoretical description of fission the macroscopic liquid drop model was used . in this approach the competition between coulomb repulsion and surface energy of deformed charged liquid drop of nuclear matter",
    "is analyzed .",
    "the mass distributions calculated within this method are symmetric , as a consequence of ignoring microscopic effects , that are responsible for octupole deformation of mother nucleus and deformations of the fragments  @xcite .",
    "the more sophisticated approach , scission point model  @xcite , assumes that fission properties can be derived from the scission point configuration that is well defined in the evolution of fissioning nucleus .",
    "the scission point is described as a configuration of two deformed touching fragments .",
    "the potential energy is calculated using macroscopic - microscopic model .",
    "the probability of certain fragmentation is in inverse proportion to the scission point potential energy .",
    "this method allows to determine the probability , that the certain number of nucleons will be incorporated to one of the fragments from the energy of the scission configuration .    within improved scission point model @xcite one can obtain distribution of fission fragments and the mean value of total kinetic energy . in comparison to ref .",
    "@xcite this model allows to calculate energy of interaction between fragments and deformation energy at the scission point configuration , what results on obtained mass and tke distributions .",
    "the main disadvantage of this treatment is large number of phenomenological parameters , e.g. touching distance of fissioning system , surface tension coefficient with parameters fitted to the magic nuclei .",
    "the authors of the microscopic scission point method @xcite also deduce fission properties as fragment mass and tke from the analysis of dinuclear system that may be created after scission .",
    "energies of nuclei are obtained in the microscopic self - consistent calculations .",
    "depending on mass asymmetry and deformation of the fragments energy of the system is calculated and fission probability is determined . in this approach",
    "strong assumptions on distance between fragments and deformation of the fragments at scission point have to be made .",
    "another approach includes dynamics of fission in the analysis .",
    "it treats the nuclear shape evolution as a brownian motions of nuclear system on the potential energy surface ( pes ) @xcite .",
    "the direction of the motion in the five - dimensional deformation space is determined randomly using metropolis method .",
    "the considered pes is calculated within macroscopic - microscopic model , where the potential energy consists of liquid drop part ( with deformation - dependent coefficients ) and microscopic corrections . during",
    " random walk \" on this surface each shape might be obtained with accordance to its statistical weight .",
    "the dimensional depletion causes that agreement with experimental mass distribution is getting worse .",
    "the additional parameter ",
    "critical neck radius was introduced , and its value results much on the obtained fragment mass yields .",
    "there were also several attempts to describe fragment mass distribution in a fully microscopic way , i.e. using adiabatic time - dependent hartree - fock - bogolubov ( atdhfb ) method @xcite or hartree - fock - bogolubov ( hfb ) method with skyrme energy functional  @xcite .",
    "atdhfb model allows to include dynamical effects to the description of the fission process .",
    "the probability of mass division is proportional to the total flux of the wave function through the scission point in a particular configuration . including dynamic effects gives much better agreement with data in comparison with static calculations .",
    "especially the broadness of fragment mass distribution is closer to the experimental one .",
    "the hfb method with skyrme energy functional was applied for description of induced fission process @xcite .",
    "the authors discussed the impact of the triaxiality and discontinuity of the pes in the scission point region on the fragment mass distribution .",
    "quasi - particle occupations in the nascent fragments were localized and attributed to each fragment . however , no comparison of theoretical and experimental distributions were performed .",
    "dynamic calculations at low excitation energy were performed using langevin approach @xcite .",
    "shell and pairing effects , as well as dissipation and fluctuation were included in the model . out of fragment mass distribution",
    "it was also possible to obtain the time scale of fission process .",
    "the authors made a strong assumption , that both nascent fragments have the same deformation , what argues with several observations of shapes of fission products @xcite .",
    "published lastly gef code @xcite predicts surprisingly good fission fragment mass yields with a very simple construction of the pes of fissioning nucleus .",
    "namely , macroscopic potential is modified by parabolic corrections to simulate shell effects .",
    "once fitted it reproduces wide range of experimental fission results .",
    "the main inspiration for our investigations is the idea proposed by u. brosa @xcite .",
    "the authors assume direct dependence of fragment mass distribution on the random neck rupture mechanism of mother nucleus in its pre - scission shape .",
    "the method describes splitting of a nucleus as a consequence of hydrodynamic fluctuations induced by random vibrations of nuclear surface .",
    "the pre - scission deformation of the fissioning nucleus has a decisive influence on the fragment mass yield .",
    "the probability , that the rupture of the neck occurs in a certain position , decreases with the radius of a neck . in this method",
    "no assumption on properties of fission fragments is needed .",
    "this simple macroscopic model , allows to describe many fission properties as the tke distribution and the dependence of neutron multiplicity on fragment masses .",
    "we apply the hfb model , employing finite - range gogny forces to calculate the pes and mass distribution during fission .",
    "the previous investigations performed with this model proven , that it describes with reasonable accuracy the experimental data of the most relevant properties of unstable nuclei for different decay modes , such as spontaneous fission @xcite and exotic process of cluster radioactivity @xcite .",
    "also the asymmetric fission of @xmath2hg isotope was successfully explained within microscopic approach @xcite . in this paper detailed analysis of the scission point configuration determined in the microscopic calculations",
    "is performed . from the single mass distribution we deduce possible fragment mass asymmetries .",
    "this paper is built as follows : in the second section details of calculations are described .",
    "results obtained for four isotopes are presented in the third section .",
    "finaly fourth section include our conclusions and discussion of the results .",
    "the analysis of the scission point configurations requires realistic description of the nuclear matter mass distributions at large deformations .",
    "they may be provided by the calculations performed within the self - consistent constrained hfb model with the effective gogny density - dependent interaction @xcite .",
    "the popular d1s parametrization @xcite was used .",
    "the computer code of @xcite was applied for numerical calculations .",
    "the pes was determined in the deformation space of quadrupole and octupole deformations . in the pes",
    "the fission paths were determined as continuous lines connecting local minima of energy for fixed value of quadrupole moment . in each point of the constrained calculations",
    "nuclear matter spatial distribution can be easily derrived from the single - nucleon wave functions .",
    "the scission point is defined as the configuration of nuclear system in which molecular shape ( i.e. two fragments connected by a thin neck ) of a mother nucleus converts into two separate fragments . in some simple models",
    "it is represented by the configuration of two touching nascent nuclei .",
    "in fact , when a realistic leptodermous density distribution is taken into account , one can find , that during the splitting nuclear matter density in the neck decreases gradually from the bulk value to zero while surfaces of the fragments overlap .",
    "thus we can not define one scission configuration but rather a scssion region in which two fragments are being separated .    in the self - consistent calculations of the pes it is easy to locate the ranges of the scission region .",
    "increasing constraint on deformation parameter , e.g. quadrupole moment , leads to more elongated shape of a nucleus with a thinner neck . at some point",
    "sudden change take place .",
    "the energy minimization procedure leads not to molecular shape but a solution with two nuclei separated by a few fm distance is found .",
    "such dinuclear system usually has got energy much lower than the compound nucleus calculated in the previous step .",
    "surely , scission take place between these two configurations . in this way",
    "the last point on the fission valley before rupture should be called pre - scission point and the next point with two separated fragments post - scission point .",
    "the line connecting pre - scission points on the pes should be called scission line ( or more precisely pre - sisccion line ) , see fig .",
    "intermediate configurations of the scission region are hard to obtain in the self - consistent procedure as they require multiple constraints , including e.g. neck parameter @xcite .",
    "the white lines correspond to the fission paths . ]",
    "the evolution of shape along fission path goes smoothly with increase of deformation up to the the pre - scissin point .",
    "it was found @xcite that many fission properties are determined by the shape of the pes from saddle to scission , where a nucleus takes a molecular shape .",
    "especially the configuration in the pre - scission point is crucial in the fission process as no further evolution of a compound nucleus is allowed .    in most cases determination of",
    "the scission line is trivial , as in the constrained calculations many observables essentially change their values : e.g. energy , hexadecapole moment , neck thickness .",
    "such line can be easily noticed in fig .",
    "[ pes ] between @xmath3 b and 250 b as rapid change of energy of the system take place along scission line .    in the case of symmetric fission path in @xmath4fm at @xmath5",

    ". it can be easily found in the panel ( a ) of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , where fission path smoothly converts into hyperbolic decrease characteristic for coulomb repulsion between separated fragments . thus fall of energy can not be a criterion to determine the scission point .",
    "detailed calculations show only a tiny kink with change of energy derivative when the neck is about to disappear . to prove , that this is real scission point , first we calculate neck parameter @xmath6 defined as :    @xmath7    where @xmath8 is a parameter describing width of a neck region with an arbitrary chosen value @xmath9 fm .",

    "as it was mentioned , scission point may be defined as a configuration , where rapid change of matter distribution from molecular to dinuclear system occurs . to check discontinuity in changes of density of nucleons",
    "it is useful to follow procedure of ref .",
    "we may define the density distance function @xmath14 given by :    @xmath15    where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the the local spatial densities , calculated in two following steps during the nuclear shape evolution .",
