    "the 1173  kev and 1332  kev emission from @xmath0fe decay has been confirmed by the space - based telescopes rhessi @xcite and integral / spi @xcite , indicating ongoing nucleosynthesis of @xmath0fe in the milky way ( for recent reviews , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the sources of @xmath0fe have generally been associated with massive stars and subsequent core - collapse supernovae ( ccsne ) , in which successive neutron captures on fe isotopes create @xmath0fe @xcite .",
    "however , recent ccsn nucleosynthesis calculations @xcite predict the ratio of @xmath0fe to @xmath8al ( halflife of 0.717  myr ) being several times greater than the line flux ratio inferred from the integral / spi experiment , @xmath0fe/@xmath8al@xmath9 @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggested that the discrepancy could be alleviated if the dominant @xmath8al contributors were wolf - rayet star winds that did not eject @xmath0fe .",
    "a detection of live @xmath0fe in the deep ocean crust on the earth has also been recently reported @xcite , which may be a sign of @xmath0fe injection from a nearby supernova ( sn ) into the heliosphere a few myr ago @xcite .",
    "the origin of live @xmath0fe in the early solar system has been continuously discussed since its discovery in primitive meteorites @xcite . the initial ratio at the solar birth , @xmath10 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , appeared to be higher than the interstellar - medium ( ism ) value , @xmath11 @xcite.fe from the solar birth to the present day in the milky way ( see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "] this fact led to an idea that one or several nearby sne had injected freshly synthesized @xmath0fe into the early solar system @xcite .",
    "a recent meteorite study suggests , however , an initial ratio of @xmath12 ( see also * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which is 30 times lower than the ism value .",
    "if this is true , the live @xmath0fe might have been simply inherited from the ism to the molecular cloud that made the solar system after a certain decay interval ( @xmath13  myr , * ? ? ?",
    "this assumption , however , needs a mechanism to avoid @xmath0fe coming from ccsne during that period of time ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite suggested that the low @xmath14 ratios were not representative of the proto - solar values .    it should be noted that @xmath0fe production in ccsn models is subject to uncertainties in several reaction rates @xcite as well as in the treatment of mass loss , convection , explosion energy , and initial metallicity in stellar models @xcite .",
    "the calculated @xmath0fe yields should thus be taken with caution . a possible solution to the aforementioned conflicts with observations",
    "would thus be that ccsne actually produced little @xmath0fe and other sources with longer stellar lifetimes supplied the galactic @xmath0fe .",
    "such sources could be asymptotic - giant - branch ( agb , with a c - o core , * ? ? ?",

    "we adopt our recent nucleosynthesis results of @xcite and show that @xmath0fe is produced in appreciable amounts in the neutron - rich and low - entropy ejecta .",
    "we employ the nucleosynthesis results of @xcite , which are briefly summarized below . the nucleosynthesis analysis made use of 2000 representative tracer particles , by which the thermodynamic histories of ejecta chunks were followed in our 2d hydrodynamic calculation of an ecsn @xcite .",
    "our ecsn model predicts the core - ejecta mass of @xmath15 with electron fractions ( number of protons per nucleon ) of @xmath160.55 and entropies of @xmath1725  @xmath18  nucleon@xmath19 ( @xmath18 is the boltzmann constant ; see fig .  1 in * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , whose astrophysical origin has not been fully resolved ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "a neutron - rich isotope , @xmath1ca , whose origin remains a long - standing mystery of nucleosynthesis @xcite , is also found to be made in the neutron - rich ejecta with @xmath210.42 and @xmath2215  @xmath18  nucleon@xmath19 .",
    "in addition to their `` unchanged '' ecsn model , @xcite also explored models in which the densities were increased by multiplying a constant scaling factor @xmath23 for all the tracer particles ( `` @xmath24 '' ) .",
    "this effectively decreased the entropy by the same factor .",
    "it was found that increasing the densities by factors of 1.3 or 2 ( @xmath25 or 2 , corresponding to a reduction by a factor of 1.3 or 2 in entropy ) leads to a remarkable enhancement of the @xmath1ca abundance .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that a reduction of the entropy turns the nucleosynthesis condition from @xmath26-rich qse ( nuclear quasi - equilibrium ) to @xmath26-poor qse . in the latter condition , an upward-@xmath27 shift of the heavy abundances in the qse cluster",
    "is suppressed owing to the paucity of light particles ( neutrons , protons , and @xmath26 s ) . as a result ,",

    "only @xmath0fe forms in the most neutron - rich investigated conditions with @xmath160.45 , which is somewhat isolated from @xmath340.55 in which the others are produced .",
    "these isotopes are made in nse ( nuclear statistical equilibrium ) and qse , and , in part , by @xmath26 and proton captures after the qse freezeout . the smaller core - ejecta mass of an ecsn results in several 10 times smaller amounts of these isotopes ( 1st line in table  1 ) than in ccsne ( 4th and 5th lines in table  1 , in which the abundances taken from * ? ? ?",

    "despite the small core - ejecta mass , we find a similar amount of @xmath0fe for ecsne comparable to that for ccsne .",
    "this is due to appreciable production of @xmath0fe in qse with neutron - rich conditions for @xmath35 ( characterizing the structure of @xmath0fe ) , which is absent in ccsn ejecta .",
    "in fact , @xmath0fe is the most tightly bound isotope in the range @xmath36 . the mass fraction @xmath37 , however , peaks at @xmath38 , which is slightly below 0.433 ( red dots in figure  [ fig : yefe60 ] , bottom ) .",

    "we realize an upward-@xmath27 shift of the heavy abundances after the nse freezeout from decreasing @xmath53 and increasing @xmath54 in figures  [ fig : tabun](a ) and ( b ) .",
    "this is a result of the @xmath26-rich freezeout from nse @xcite followed by qse @xcite , recognized by @xmath55 and 2.33 at the nse freezeout for the @xmath41 and 0.428 cases , respectively .",
    "we define the qse freezeout when the timescale of the abundance formation for @xmath49 , @xmath56 , exceeds @xmath52 .",
    "qse freezes out typically around 4  gk @xcite and the upward-@xmath27 shift of the heavy abundances ceases .",
    "we find in figures  [ fig : tabun](a ) and ( b ) that the @xmath0fe abundances for @xmath41 and @xmath38 , respectively , decrease and increase during the qse phase .",
    "figures  [ fig : tabun](e ) and ( f ) clarify the reason , illustrating the nuclear abundances at the nse freezeout , at the qse freezeout , and at the end of calculation for each tracer particle . we find that , at the nse freezeout , @xmath0fe belongs to the lighter group of the nse cluster .    for the @xmath41 case ( figures  [ fig : tabun](a ) and ( e ) ) , a drastic upward-@xmath27 shift of the heavy abundances takes place during the qse phase . as a result ,",
    "a part of the @xmath0fe abundance is taken by the heavier group , in particular by @xmath39ni . for the @xmath38 case ( figures  [ fig : tabun](b ) and ( f ) )",
    ", the upward-@xmath27 shift is smaller as a result of the smaller @xmath57 at the nse freezeout .",

    ", @xmath0fe keeps increasing in the qse cluster and even after the qse freezeout .    in summary , @xmath0fe forms in nse and further increases or decreases in qse depending on the neutron - richness as well as the available number of @xmath26 s during the qse phase . the latter condition is closely related to entropy . in the following ,",
    "we thus inspect the ecsn models in which densities are multiplied by a scaling factor @xmath23 for all the tracer particles .",
    "figure  [ fig : yefe60 ] ( bottom ) shows the final mass fractions of @xmath0fe for the unchanged model ( @xmath59 ) and those with @xmath25 , 2.0 , 10 , 1/1.3 , and 1/2.0 .",
    "we find a strong sensitivity of the @xmath0fe production to entropy .",
    "the nuclear evolutions for @xmath28 are presented in figure  [ fig : tabun](c ) for @xmath41 and in figure  [ fig : tabun](d ) for 0.428 .",
    "the @xmath57 ratios at the nse freezeout are 1.46 and 1.33 , respectively , being only slightly greater than unity , as a result of reduced entropies by about a factor of 2 . as a result , an upward-@xmath27 shift of the abundances is restricted by a small number of light particles .",
    "@xmath0fe thus survives and increases during the qse phase , being maximal around @xmath60 ( figure  [ fig : yefe60 ] , bottom ) .",
    "the resulting ejecta masses of radionuclides for @xmath25 and 2.0 are presented in table  1 ( 2nd and 3rd lines ) .",
    "@xmath0fe is appreciably produced in the low - entropy models .",
    "a decrease of only about 30% in entropy doubles the ejecta mass of @xmath0fe , being comparable to that for ccsne . about a factor of 2 decrease in entropy leads to about 4 times greater @xmath0fe amount , being already close to that for the extreme , @xmath61 case ( @xmath62 ; not presented in table  1 ) .",

    "e.g. , gives @xmath70 .",
    "] this can be regarded as the absolute upper limit of @xmath71 in the local universe with the metallicity near the solar value .",
    "we further evaluate the upper limit on @xmath71 based on our result .",
    "for the unchanged model , the most overproduced isotope relative to the solar value is @xmath64kr ( table  2 , 1st line ) . given that @xmath64kr in the milky way was exclusively made by ecsne , we have @xcite , @xmath72 where @xmath73 and @xmath74 are the mass fractions of these isotopes in the solar system @xcite .",

    "* their table  1 ) . with these values , we get @xmath78 for the unchanged model . for the low - entropy models with @xmath25 and 2.0 ,",
    "equation  ( [ eq : fecsn ] ) gives @xmath79 and 0.240 , respectively , by replacing @xmath64kr with the most overproduced isotopes , @xmath65se and @xmath1ca .",
    "taking the imf - averaged @xmath0fe mass , @xmath80 with the ccsn yields in @xcite , the fractions of the galactic @xmath0fe from ecsne ( relative to that from all sn events ) become @xmath81 , 0.155 , and 0.332 for the unchanged , @xmath82 , and @xmath28 cases , respectively .",
    "this indicates that ecsne supply about 430% of live @xmath0fe in the milky way .",
    "it should be noted that the ratio from the ccsn yields , @xmath83 , is already more than 4 times greater than the observational flux ratio of 0.148 @xcite . a contribution from ecsne would thus enlarge the discrepancy . as noted in section  [ sec : intro ] , however , @xmath0fe production in ccsne is subject to uncertainties in several reaction rates as well as in astrophysical modeling of stellar evolution .",
    "contributions from ecsne could therefore be greater than the above estimate . as an extreme case",
    ", we provide the ratios of @xmath0fe/@xmath8al with no @xmath0fe ( but @xmath8al ) contribution from ccsne ( i.e. , @xmath84 ) in table  2 ( last column ) .",
    "we find that the low - entropy model with @xmath25 gives the value that is roughly consistent with the gamma - ray observation .",
    "if the galactic @xmath0fe were exclusively produced by ecsne , their longer progenitor lifetimes ( @xmath85  myr ) could give rise to different distributions between @xmath8al and @xmath0fe .",
    "on the one hand , the @xmath8al distribution appears to be clumpy as evidenced by the integral / spi mission @xcite .",
    "some of this clumpiness is associated with regions hosting many young , massive stars such as the cygnus region . on the other hand , @xmath0fe may not be associated with such young stellar regions and thus be distributed more diffusely .",
    "although the cygnus region marginally appears within the integral sensitivity for @xmath0fe , no signal of its decay has been found @xcite .",
    "this could be due to the age of the cygnus complex being much younger than the lifetimes of ecsn progenitors .",
    "the signatures of @xmath0fe production in ecsne might have been imprinted also in primitive meteorites or in the deep ocean crust .",
    "ecsne produce appreciable @xmath1ca ( also @xmath2ti and @xmath3cr , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that can not be made by ccsne .",
    "its association with excess @xmath0fe could thus be a sign of the ecsn origin .",
    "in fact , such a correlation in meteorites was reported by @xcite .",
    "note , however , that both @xmath0fe and @xmath1ca could also originate from a rare class of high density sne  ia @xcite .",
    "our ecsn model , however , produces almost all light trans - iron nuclei up to @xmath86 ( figure  5 in * ? ? ? * ) and presumably weak @xmath4-process nuclei up to @xmath87 ( figure  5 in * ? ? ?",
    "the latter can also be created in the subsequent neutrino - driven outflows @xcite .",
    "the weak @xmath4-process products should include a few radionuclides with lifetimes comparable to that of @xmath0fe , such as @xmath5zr ( 1.53  myr ) , @xmath6tc ( 0.211  myr ) , and @xmath7pd ( 6.5  myr ) .",
    "therefore , it will be crucial to find correlations also with these trans - iron species that are not made by sne  ia .",
    "we examined the production of @xmath0fe in ecsne in connection to the nucleosynthetic results of @xcite .",
    "the models were based on the 2d core - collapse simulation @xcite of an @xmath88 sagb star @xcite .",
    "in addition to the unchanged ecsn model , we adopted the low - entropy models of @xcite , in which densities were multiplied by a factor @xmath23 .",
    "we found appreciable @xmath0fe production during the nse and subsequent qse phases in the neutron - rich ejecta with @xmath89 .",
    "the amount of @xmath0fe is highly dependent on entropy ; lower entropy models ( @xmath25 and 2.0 ) make more @xmath0fe .    the unchanged ecsn model predicted @xmath904% contribution of ecsne ( relative to all sn events ) to the galactic @xmath0fe . this fraction could increase to @xmath9030% ( for @xmath28 ) if the low - entropy models were adopted .",
    "if this were the case , the galactic flux ratio of @xmath91 @xcite would be explained without @xmath0fe contributions from ccsne .",
    "if the galactic @xmath0fe were dominantly supplied from ecsne ( i.e. , the ccsn yields were severely overestimated ) , @xmath0fe would be more diffusely distributed than @xmath8al without showing clear associations with young stellar regions such as the cygnus complex .",
    "this should be confirmed by future gamma - ray line surveys .",
    "our ecsn models co - produce the neutron - rich isotope @xmath1ca @xcite , light trans - iron elements , and possibly weak @xmath4-process elements @xcite , accompanied by several radionuclides with million - year lifetimes ( e.g. , @xmath5zr , @xmath6tc , and @xmath7pd ) . correlations between @xmath0fe and these isotopes in primitive meteorites @xcite or in the deep ocean crust on the earth @xcite will be an invaluable evidence of @xmath0fe production in ecsne .    finally , it should be cautioned that further improvements of hydrodynamical models ( e.g. , three - dimensional , high - resolution , and general - relativistic treatment ) will be needed before drawing more firm conclusions .",
    "studies of @xmath0fe production by a mini s - process during the sagb stage @xcite prior to ecsn explosions are also important to evaluate the net @xmath0fe ejecta from such stars .",

    "<S> the nucleosynthetic results are based on a self - consistent , two - dimensional simulation of an ecsn as well as models in which the densities are systematically increased by some factors ( low - entropy models ) . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath0fe is found to be appreciably made in neutron - rich ejecta during the nuclear quasi - equilibrium phase with greater amounts being produced in the lower - entropy models . </S>",
    "<S> our results , combining them with the yields of core - collapse supernovae ( ccsne ) in the literature , suggest that ecsne account for at least 430% of live @xmath0fe in the milky way . </S>",
    "<S> ecsne co - produce neutron - rich isotopes , @xmath1ca , @xmath2ti , @xmath3cr , some light trans - iron elements , and possibly weak @xmath4-process elements including some radionuclides such as @xmath5zr , @xmath6tc , and @xmath7pd , whose association with @xmath0fe might have been imprinted in primitive meteorites or in the deep ocean crust on the earth . </S>"
