    "two - neutron transfer reactions have long been recognized as a most valuable tool to gain information on nuclear structure near closed shells . in fact , the first study with ( @xmath1 ) reactions on all the stable even sn isotopes dates back to 1970 @xcite .",
    "some thirty years later a systematic study of these isotopes via ( @xmath4 reactions was undertaken in high resolution experiments at the munich hvec mp tandem , which led to identification of many new low - spin excited levels .",
    "the results for the reactions @xmath5sn(@xmath1)sn@xmath6 were reported in various papers @xcite , where they were also compared with predictions of shell - model calculations with realistic effective interactions .    in all of these papers , except refs .",
    "@xcite , a microscopic dwba calculation of differential cross sections was performed , where we used two - neutron spectroscopic amplitudes obtained from shell - model wave functions for the initial and final nuclear states calculated in a seniority space including states up to seniority @xmath7 .",
    "the agreement of the calculated spectra with the experimental ones was on the whole remarkably good .",
    "as regards the cross section angular distributions for the excitation of the lowest yrast states of the final nucleus , they are well reproduced in general , the most significant disagreement between theory and experiment occurring for the ( @xmath1 ) reaction leading to the mid - shell nucleus @xmath8sn .    to summarize",
    ", we may say that a main outcome of our detailed study was that it provided further evidence of the key role played by the shell model in understanding the structure of the tin isotopic chain .",
    "the latter , however , extends well beyond the last stable isotope , @xmath9sn , spectroscopic information being now available beyond @xmath10sn .",
    "more precisely , four excited states and two b(e2 ) transition rates are known in @xmath2sn , while only one @xmath11 state has been very recently identified at 682 kev excitation energy @xcite in @xmath0sn .",
    "this excitation energy is slightly smaller than that of the @xmath11 state in @xmath2sn ( 726 kev ) , making it the lowest first excited @xmath11 level observed in a semi - magic even - even nucleus over the whole chart of nuclides .",
    "the spectrum and b(e2 ) transition rates in @xmath2sn were successfully reproduced by shell - model calculations @xcite , employing a realistic effective interaction derived from the cd - bonn nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath12 ) potential @xcite .",
    "the spectrum of @xmath0sn was predicted in @xcite and the calculated energy of the 2@xmath13 state turns out to be in very good agreement with the recent observed value .",
    "the low position of this 2@xmath13 state as well as of that in @xmath2sn were explained as a manifestation of a weak neutron pairing for @xmath14 , which was traced to a reduction of the effects of the one particle - one hole core excitations , as discussed in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the advent of radioactive ion beams ( ribs ) provides the opportunity to study nuclei far from stability with transfer reactions performed in inverse kinematics .",
    "this makes it possible to investigate sn isotopes with increasing nucleon number via two - neutron transfer reactions . in this context",
    ", particularly challenging is the perspective offered by the second - generation rib facilities to go beyond the shell closure at @xmath15 .    based on our studies of the sn isotopes ,",
    "we think it would be useful to make predictions of cross sections for the two reactions @xmath0sn(@xmath1)@xmath2sn and @xmath2sn(@xmath3)@xmath0sn .",
    "this is a subject of great current interest , especially with regard to the latter reaction , which is likely to be performed in the near future employing a @xmath2sn rib impinging on a tritium gas target .",
    "recently , the two - neutron transfer mode in neutron - rich sn isotopes beyond @xmath15 has been studied @xcite with emphasis put on the character of pairing correlations . in these studies ,",
    "microscopic nuclear structure calculations have been performed within the hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) plus quasiparticle random phase approximation ( qrpa ) approach .",
    "this has clearly increased our motivation for the present study , where the structures of @xmath2sn and @xmath0sn are described in terms of the shell model with a realistic effective interaction .",
    "our calculation of the differential cross sections for the ( @xmath1 ) and ( @xmath3 ) reactions uses target and residual nucleus wave functions obtained from a shell - model calculation in which @xmath10sn is assumed as a closed core with the valence neutrons occupying the six levels @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 of the @xmath22 shell .",
    "the adoped hamiltonian is the same we employed in our recent shell - model studies of neutron - rich nuclei beyond @xmath10sn @xcite .    for the sake of completeness ,",
    "we give here a few details of this hamiltonian .",
    "the single - neutron energies have been taken from the experimental spectrum of @xmath23sn @xcite , with the exception of the @xmath21 level which was determined from the position of the 10@xmath24 state at 2.423 mev in @xmath2sb .",
    "the adopted values , relative to the @xmath17 level , are ( in mev ) : @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 .",
    "note that the @xmath20 energy is that measured in the experiment of ref .",
    "@xcite , where the spectroscopic amplitudes of the @xmath17 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath18 levels were extracted .",
    "the obtained values provide a clear confirmation of the single - particle nature of these four levels .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the two - body effective interaction between the valence neutrons is derived from the cd - bonn @xmath12 potential , which is renormalized by means of the @xmath30 approach @xcite with a cutoff momentum @xmath31 = 2.2 @xmath32 .",
    "the obtained low - momentum potential is then used to derive the two - body effective interaction @xmath33 within the framework of the @xmath34-box folded diagram expansion @xcite , including diagrams up to second order in @xmath30 .",
    "these diagrams are computed within the harmonic - oscillator basis using intermediate states composed of all possible hole states and particle states restricted to the five proton and neutron shells above the fermi surface .",
    "the oscillator parameter is 7.88 mev , as obtained from the expression @xmath35 with @xmath36 .",
    "the shell - model calculations have been performed by the nushell code @xcite .",
    "theories of direct ( @xmath1 ) and ( @xmath3 ) reactions between multi - nucleon states have been described elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the basic assumption is that the interaction responsible for the process involves only the degrees of freedom of the proton and the transferred neutrons .",
    "the remaining target nucleons contribute only via the shell - model potential , which governs the motion of the bound neutron states , and the optical potentials , which govern the scattering states of the proton and triton .",
    "this assumption allows the differential cross - section for the transition between the @xmath37 and @xmath38 systems to be expressed in the form    @xmath39    the spectroscopic amplitude @xmath40 contains the nuclear structure information .",
    "it is defined as the matrix element of a vector - coupled pair of neutron creation operators between initial and final nuclear states :    @xmath41^l}{\\sqrt{1+\\delta_{n_1,n_2}\\delta_{\\ell_1,\\ell_2}\\delta_{j_1,j_2}}}~\\psi^{i_2}~\\right]^{i_1}_{m_1}~>\\ ] ]    here the @xmath42 and @xmath43 represent neutron creation operators , and square brackets symbolize vector coupling .",
    "the spectroscopic amplitudes can be calculated once the shell - model wave functions @xmath44 are known .",
    "the reaction amplitudes @xmath45 are calculated by a dwba program .",
    "we used twofnr , written by m. igarashi @xcite , modified so as to allow the volume and surface contributions to the imaginary potentials to have different geometry .",
    "the reaction amplitudes depend upon the reaction kinematics , the optical potentials , and also on the details of the assumed reaction mechanism .",
    "we have chosen optical potential parameters obtained by global fits to proton @xcite and triton @xcite elastic scattering on medium - weight nuclei , at a range of energies .",
    "comparison between experimental @xcite and calculated differential cross - sections for the @xmath9sn(p , t)@xmath46sn ground - state transition .",
    "the line represents the results of the microscopic calculation ( in @xmath47 ) as a function of the center - of - mass angle ( in degrees ) . ]    in our work , we have used the simple approximation that the interaction between the proton and the neutrons is a function only of the distance between the proton and the dineutron mass center .",
    "this implies that the relative motion of the two neutrons does not change during the transfer process , and so the reaction favors initial and final nuclear states which differ by a neutron pair with the same relative motion as the two neutrons in the triton .",
    "since this is mostly a state with zero two - neutron spin and relative angular momentum , this leads to dominant transitions between states with strong pairing correlations .",
    "this has been an observed feature of ( @xmath48,@xmath49 ) and ( @xmath49,@xmath48 ) reactions once it became possible to resolve individual final levels @xcite .",
    "a major disadvantage of the proton - dineutron approximation is that it is difficult to normalize it , to yield absolute differential cross - sections .",
    "we can only calculate angular shapes of the differential cross - sections , and the relative strengths of transitions between specified nuclear states .",
    "figure 1 shows a comparison with experimental data @xcite of our calculated differential cross - section for the @xmath9sn(@xmath1)@xmath46sn ground - state transition at 25 mev incident energy . evidently the simple direct - interaction theory is able to give a good account of the shape of the angular distribution .",
    "we have normalized our calculation to produce a good visual fit to the magnitude of the data .",
    "we use this same normalization factor in the remainder of this paper , thereby allowing ourselves to express predicted differential cross - sections in @xmath50b / sr .",
    "thus we are assuming that the normalization factor is the same , not only between levels of the same nucleus , but between the different tin isotopes . from the direct - reaction viewpoint , where the interaction involves only the proton and the transferred neutrons , this assumption of a constant normalization factor seems reasonable .    in recent years",
    ", more precise calculations have been done in which the proton interacts separately with the individual neutrons @xcite , and these calculations have succeeded in calculating absolute cross - sections , still within the picture of a direct reaction .    the most significant feature of eq .",
    "( 1 ) is that the differential cross - section involves a _ coherent _ sum of contributions from the different @xmath51 pair transfers .",
    "this leads to strong cross - section variation from level to level , depending upon whether the different @xmath51 pairs contribute constructively or destructively .",
    "thus two - neutron transfer reactions provide a very stringent test of calculated shell - model wave functions .",
    "as already mentioned in the introduction , our shell - model study of sn isotopes beyond @xmath15 [ 9,10 ] has led to remarkably good agreement between the calculated energy levels and the few experimental data available for @xmath2sn and @xmath0sn . for the sake of completeness we report here in fig .",
    "2 the calculated excitation energies of the yrast @xmath11 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 levels , as well as the second @xmath54 states for these two nuclei . these will be the subject of the following discussion concerning the two - particle transfers . also shown in fig .",
    "2 are the available experimental energies .",
    "we see that they are very well reproduced by the theory , the largest discrepancy being about 100 kev for the @xmath53 state in @xmath2sn .",

    "[ h ]     calculated differential ( @xmath49,@xmath48 ) cross sections for the two lowest @xmath54 states in @xmath0sn at 20 mev incident energy . ]",
    "we start by focusing on the stripping and pick - up processes for @xmath2sn and @xmath0sn leading to the population of the ground and the first excited @xmath54 states of the final nucleus .",
    "this choice is motivated by the possibility to have a comparison with the results of refs .",
    "@xcite . in these studies",
    "only transfers of nucleonic pairs to low - lying @xmath54 states were investigated , with the aim of exploring the properties of the pairing force for neutron - rich nuclei . in this case , changes in the two - nucleon transfers are expected which may give important information on the nature of the pairing correlations . however , no experimental proof has yet been found , except for very light nuclei .",
    "the calculations of both of refs .",
    "@xcite are performed within the hfb+qpra approach , and in this connection it is clearly interesting to look at the shell - model predictions . in figs . 3 and 4 , we report the calculated differential cross sections for the excitation of the ground and first excited @xmath54 states via the ( @xmath49,@xmath48 ) reaction on @xmath2sn and the ( @xmath48,@xmath49 ) reaction on @xmath0sn , respectively .",
    "we see that , while for the ( @xmath49,@xmath48 ) reaction the cross section for the excitation of the @xmath54 excited state is smaller than that for the excitation of the ground state ( g.s . ) by no more than one order of magnitude , in the ( @xmath48,@xmath49 ) reaction the first excited @xmath54 state is very weakly populated , the cross section being four order of magnitudes smaller than that relative to the g.s .",
    "the latter result is strongly at variance with that obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite , where only the pick - up @xmath0sn(@xmath48,@xmath49)@xmath2sn reaction was studied and the ratio of the cross sections associated to the g.s .",
    "and the @xmath55 state transitions turned out to be not greater than 7 .",
    "our predictions are instead in agreement with the findings of ref .",
    "@xcite , where both pair - addition and pair - removal transitions were considered , although most of the attention was focused on the former .",
    "however , in @xcite a microscopic analysis of the predictions reported in the study of ref .",
    "@xcite was performed , showing that a large number of both weakly bound and unbound states is responsible for the obtained results . on the other hand , our calculations lead to relative cross - sections of the @xmath56 transitions , which , to a great extent , can be understood only in terms of the transfers of @xmath57 and @xmath58 pairs .",
    "[ h ]     calculated differential ( @xmath48,@xmath49 ) cross sections for the two lowest @xmath54 states in @xmath2sn at 20 mev incident energy . ]",
    "the dwba calculations indicate that the reaction amplitudes @xmath59 and @xmath60 of eq",
    ". 1 are nearly independent of @xmath61 , both in amplitude and in phase .",
    "their values are in the ratio    .spectroscopic amplitudes for the population of the two lowest @xmath54 states of @xmath2sn and @xmath0sn .",
    "the index l=0 is omitted . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ table1 ]    an even simpler view of the situation is afforded by the zero - configuration - mixing approximation , in which    @xmath62 and @xmath63 ground state transitions would be associated with pure @xmath57 transfer , the @xmath64 transition to @xmath65 would be associated with pure @xmath58 transfer , whereas the @xmath63 transfer to @xmath65 would be completely forbidden .",
    "this is consistent with our complete calculation , in which @xmath0sn@xmath66sn@xmath67 is very weak , but @xmath2sn@xmath68sn@xmath67 is appreciable .",
    "we can try to go a step further in this discussion by attempting to connect the predicted structure of the wave functions to our effective interaction .",
    "we see that these wave functions are characterized by rather weak mixing , this being related to the weakness of the pairing force with respect to the @xmath69 spacing , which is about 0.9 mev .",
    "the two @xmath70 diagonal matrix elements of the @xmath57 and @xmath58 configurations are both equal to about 0.7 mev .",
    "the non - diagonal matrix element between these two configurations is about 0.3 mev , which is not sufficiently large enough to generate an appreciable configuration mixing . as mentioned in the introduction , the reduced attractiveness of the neutron pairing force when @xmath14 has been discussed in several previous papers ( see , for instance , @xcite ) , and was shown to be crucial in reproducing the observed properties in the @xmath10sn region beyond @xmath15",
    ". it would be clearly of great interest to see if this prediction is also confirmed from transfer reactions experiments .    to conclude this section",

    "this we do for @xmath0sn(@xmath48,@xmath49)@xmath2sn and @xmath9sn(@xmath48,@xmath49)@xmath46sn , the latter reaction having been studied in our recent work @xcite .",

    "the basic reason for such differences between the two reactions is the large @xmath85-value difference . due to the weak binding of the outer neutrons in @xmath0sn ,",
    "the @xmath85-value of the @xmath0sn(@xmath48,@xmath49)@xmath2sn reaction is positive , so the outgoing triton has more momentum than in the case of @xmath9sn(@xmath48,@xmath49)@xmath46sn , which has the usual negative ( @xmath48,@xmath49 ) @xmath85-value .",
    "the large differences between the @xmath0sn(@xmath48,@xmath49)@xmath2sn and @xmath9sn(@xmath48,@xmath49)@xmath46sn momentum transfers account for the differences in the shapes of the ( @xmath48,@xmath49 ) angular distributions .",
    "we have found similar @xmath85-value dependence in the comparison of angular distribution shapes of the @xmath86sn(@xmath49,@xmath48)@xmath87sn stripping reactions to the yrast levels ( @xmath11,@xmath52,@xmath53 ) .",

    "we have presented here the results of a study of two - neutron transfer reactions on the first two sn isotopes beyond @xmath15 , @xmath2sn and @xmath0sn , which are likely to be studied experimentally in the near future , thanks to the availability of ribs of sufficiently high intensity . in this study",
