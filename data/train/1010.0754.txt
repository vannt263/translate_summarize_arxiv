    "associators are useful and intricate gadgets that were first introduced and studied by drinfeld in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the theory was later put in the context of parenthesized ( a.k.a .",
    "non - associative ) braids by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "associators arise in several different areas of mathematics , and thus constructing an associator is a task faced by many .",
    "unfortunately , it is a very difficult task : no closed formulas are known at present .",
    "associators are essentially the solutions to three equations , called the pentagon and the positive and negative hexagons , which live in complicated diagrammatic spaces . finding an associator amounts to finding a solution to this system of equations .",
    "furusho s result states that the last two of these three equations are superfluous : a solution to the pentagon will automatically be a solution to both hexagons .",
    "this statement is quite surprising , and thus we felt that a simpler proof would be of value .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : we first review some definitions , then present the main tool or `` extension principle '' for the simplified proof : a theorem from @xcite and @xcite , and also a simpler standard fact which we call the `` linearization principle '' .",
    "we then prove the theorem modulo a `` lie - algebraic '' version which we call the `` main lemma '' , followed by the proof of the main lemma , and finally a side note on how one of the algebraic maps used in the proof arises from topology .",
    "the part of the proof which depends on the extension principle is significantly different from that of @xcite ( and @xcite ) , and significantly simpler : furusho s proof uses algebraic geometry and groethendieck - teichmuller groups to go from the lie algebra version to the group statement .",
    "the proof of the main lemma is essentially furusho s proof , except for the elimination of the use of spherical braids .",
    "using spherical braids makes the statement of the main lemma look very symmetric , so in some sense prettier .",
    "however , in our opinion , it makes the combinatorial argument of the proof less transparent : it is the break of symmetry which helps the reader figure out how someone might have discovered the proof . also , we save the trouble of having to pass back and forth between the spherical and regular chord - diagram spaces .",
    "the elimination of spherical braids is easy : the space of chord diagrams of pure spherical @xmath0-braids and that of regular pure @xmath1-braids only differ in taking a quotient by the center of the latter .",
    "the authors would like to thank the referee for the thorough reading of the paper and detailed helpful suggestions , and stavros garoufalidis for an enlightening discussion of the proof of the main lemma .",
    "algebraically , the space of chord diagrams of pure @xmath2-braids , @xmath3 , is defined to be the graded completion of the following non - associative algebra , where generation is understood over a fixed field @xmath4 :    @xmath5=0 $ when $ i , j , k , l$ are distinct ( l ) , \\newline      $ [ t_{ij}+t_{ik},t_{jk}]=0 $ when $ i , j , k$ are distinct ( 4 t )    } \\right . \\right\\rangle\\ ] ] here , @xmath6 is short for _ four term relations _ , and @xmath7 stands for _",
    "locality_.    one usually thinks of @xmath3 in terms of horizontal chord diagrams on @xmath2 strands , where @xmath8 is represented by a chord between strands @xmath9 and @xmath10 , and multiplication is done by stacking diagrams :    let us denote by @xmath11 the free lie algebra over a field @xmath4 of characteristic 0 , on two generators @xmath12 and @xmath13 , and by @xmath14 its universal enveloping algebra , which is isomorphic to @xmath15 , the algebra of non - commutative power series over @xmath4 . by a superscript @xmath16 , as in @xmath17 , we mean the space or object modulo degree @xmath18 , e.g. non - commutative polynomials of degree up to @xmath19 .",
    "there is a co - product on @xmath14 , defined by @xmath20 , @xmath21 .",
    "an element @xmath22 is called _ group - like _ if @xmath23 .",
    "an element @xmath24 is _ primitive _ ( meaning it is a lie - algebra element ) if @xmath25 .",
    "now let us present the main characters of this story : the pentagon and hexagon equations .",
    "the pentagon equation originates from the fact that in a non - associative algebra , there are five ways to multiply four elements , and these are connected by a pentagon of re - associations .",
    "this fact and its parenthesized braid analogue are shown in the figure below :    pentagon.pstex_t    the above equality of parenthesized braids implies an algebraic equation in @xmath26 called the _ pentagon equation _ , @xmath27 , for @xmath28 , where @xmath29    the hexagons arise from the following equivalences of parenthesized braids :    hexagon.pstex_t    algebraically , the implied equations in @xmath30 are @xmath31 , for @xmath32 , where @xmath33 here , @xmath34 .",
    "an _ associator _ is a group - like element of @xmath14 which satisfies the pentagon and hexagon equations .",
    "note that the spaces @xmath30 and @xmath14 are almost isomorphic : @xmath35 is the quotient of @xmath30 by its center @xmath36 .",
    "an associator is sometimes defined as an element of @xmath30 , which is equivalent , since associators are commutator - grouplike , meaning their abelianization is 1 .",
    "( this follows from the pentagon equation . )",
    "in @xcite furusho proves the following surprising result :    [ thm : main ] if @xmath22 is a group - like element of @xmath14 with @xmath37 , where @xmath38 denotes the coefficient of @xmath39 in @xmath22 , and @xmath22 satisfies the pentagon equation @xmath27 in @xmath26 , then @xmath22 satisfies the hexagon equations @xmath31 in @xmath40 , and therefore @xmath22 is an associator .    to prove theorem  [ thm : main ] we need two tools , which we will call _ extension _ and _ linearization _ principles , and a major lemma , lemma  [ lem : main ] below",
    "the `` extension principle '' is the assertion that an associator modulo degree @xmath19 can be lifted to an associator modulo degree @xmath18 .",
    "this statement is highly non - obvious ; it takes up a good part of @xcite and the main part of @xcite .",
    "its main application is the fact that non - trivial rational associators exist : indeed , up to degree @xmath41 a direct computation shows that @xmath27 and @xmath31 have a unique non - trivial solution ( namely , @xmath42 $ ] ) , and then by extension , one may construct a rational associator inductively .",
    "the `` linearization principle '' is the standard fact that the pentagon @xmath27 and the hexagons @xmath31 can be `` linearized '' .",
    "precisely , this means that there exist degree - preserving linear operators @xmath43 and @xmath44 so that if @xmath22 and @xmath45 satisfy the pentagon equation modulo degree @xmath19 , i.e. @xmath46 modulo degree @xmath19 , and are equal modulo degree @xmath19 , i.e. @xmath47 is homogeneous of degree @xmath19 , then    @xmath48 modulo degree @xmath18    likewise for the hexagons : if @xmath22 and @xmath45 satisfy one of the hexagons modulo degree @xmath19 , and are equal modulo degree @xmath19 , then    @xmath49 modulo degree @xmath18 ,    where @xmath24 is as above .",
    "note that if @xmath22 and @xmath45 are group - like , then @xmath24 is primitive .    to prove the theorem we use the following main lemma :    [ lem : main ]",
    "if @xmath50 is homogeneous of degree @xmath51 and is primitive , and satisfies the linearized pentagon equation @xmath52 , then @xmath53 , in other words the linearized pentagon equation implies the linearized hexagon equation .",
    "* proof of theorem [ thm : main ] from lemma [ lem : main ] .",
    "* let us assume that @xmath22 is as in theorem [ thm : main ] , in particular @xmath27 , and , by contradiction , that one of the hexagons fails to hold , i.e. @xmath54 .",
    "let @xmath19 be the minimal degree in which this happens .    by the simple computation in low degrees mentioned before , we know that @xmath51 .",
    "note that by the minimality of @xmath19 , @xmath22 satisfies the hexagons modulo degree @xmath19 and hence it is an associator modulo degree @xmath19 . by extension",
    ", there exists a @xmath55 which agrees with @xmath22 modulo degree @xmath19 , and which satisfies both the pentagon and the hexagon equations modulo degree @xmath18 .",
    "let @xmath56 , which is homogeneous of degree @xmath19 since @xmath57 modulo degree @xmath19 .    by linearization , @xmath58 modulo degree @xmath18 , so by lemma [ lem : main ] , @xmath59 modulo degree @xmath18 . back again by linearization ,",
    "as @xmath45 satisfies the hexagons in degree @xmath19 , it follows that so does @xmath22 , contradicting our pessimistic assumption from the beginning .",
    "by explicit computations , @xmath60 @xmath61    let us start by proving two simple but necessary lemmas . throughout this section , @xmath24 is assumed to be a primitive , homogeneous element of @xmath62 of degree @xmath63 , as in lemma [ lem : main ] .    [ as ] @xmath52 implies that @xmath24 is anti - symmetric , i.e. @xmath64    we use the map @xmath65 defined by : @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and @xmath71 , as illustrated by the figure on the right . since @xmath72",
    ", the lemma follows .",
    "note that by the anti - symmetry of @xmath24 , we have : @xmath73 @xmath74    [ eqlinhex ] the linearized hexagon @xmath53 is equivalent to the equation @xmath75 in @xmath14 , if @xmath24 is of degree @xmath76 .    by an abuse of notation , we shall denote the left side of equation ( [ newdh ] ) by @xmath77 .",
    "@xmath53 implies ( [ newdh ] ) via the quotient map @xmath78 which factors out by the center of @xmath30 , defined by @xmath79 , @xmath80 , and @xmath81 .",
    "for the other direction we apply the map @xmath82 given by @xmath83 and @xmath84    @xmath85 where the second equality is due to the fact that @xmath86 $ ] ( since it is primitive of degree @xmath76 ) , and that the element @xmath87 is central in @xmath30",
    ".    * proof of the main lemma [ lem : main ] * let us first introduce some notation .",
    "any map of sets @xmath88 \\to [ s]$ ] , where @xmath89:=\\{1,2, ... ,r\\}$ ] and @xmath90=\\{1,2, ...",
    ",s\\}$ ] , induces a map @xmath91 , where @xmath92 .",
    "if either of the pre - images is empty , we understand the sum to be zero .    now ,",
    "if @xmath93 , denote @xmath94 ; and let @xmath95 where @xmath96 \\to [ 3]$ ] is given by @xmath97 and similarly for @xmath41 and @xmath98 .",
    "the permutation group @xmath99 acts on @xmath26 by commuting the strands ( i.e. the indices ) . for any @xmath100 , we know that @xmath101 .",
    "we try to find a ( small ) set of permutations @xmath102 such that @xmath103 , for some @xmath104 \\to [ 3]$ ] .",
    "in fact , the following four permutations work ( the notation @xmath105 means @xmath106 for @xmath107 ) : @xmath108 . using the notation introduced above ,    @xmath109    @xmath110    @xmath111    @xmath112    @xmath113    @xmath114    where the cancellations are by the anti - symmetry of @xmath24 ( lemma [ as ] ) .",
    "note that every chord appearing on the right side ends on strand @xmath41 , i.e. , @xmath115 also , @xmath116 since there are no relations in @xmath26 that involve only these elements .",
    "note that the anti - symmetry of @xmath24 also implies the anti - symmetry of dh , i.e. @xmath117 , and in particular @xmath118 .",
    "we can now finish the proof using two projections :    let @xmath119 be the projection defined by @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath120 , and apply this to the equality @xmath121 .",
    "we obtain @xmath122 and therefore @xmath123    now do the same for the projection @xmath124 defined by @xmath66 , @xmath125 , @xmath126 .",
    "we get @xmath127 , and so using the above , we arrive to @xmath128 .",
    "this means that @xmath77 contains only commutators that involve one @xmath12 and some number of @xmath13 s , and so writing @xmath129 in a linear basis we have :    @xmath130    since @xmath117 , we know that @xmath131 for all @xmath2 except possibly @xmath132 , and @xmath133 by the assumption that @xmath24 is of degree @xmath63 .",
    "thus , @xmath134 , which is equivalent to the main lemma by lemma [ eqlinhex ] .    a surprising moment in the proof above",
    "is the equality relating a sum of four linearized pentagon equations to a sum of linearized hexagons . as pointed out by stavros",
    "garoufalidis , there is a similar but more natural equality which , as the reader can check , arises from the permuto - associahedron on page 21 of @xcite : @xmath135 it is easy to verify that the rest of the proof goes through the same way using this equtlity in place of the one above .",
    "the projection @xmath136 , used in the proof of lemma [ as ] , has an interesting property and a nice topological interpretation .",
    "if we embed @xmath30 in @xmath26 on any three strands ( i.e. by any embedding of the index set @xmath137 $ ] into @xmath138 $ ] ) , and then apply @xmath136 , we get the `` almost isomorphism '' between @xmath30 and @xmath11 , i.e. the composition is factoring out by the center of @xmath30 :    this is a braid theoretic analogue of the following fact about the symmetric group @xmath99 . since @xmath99 is isomorphic to the group of symmetries of the tetrahedron , and each element of @xmath99 also permutes the three pairs of opposite edges of the tetrahedron , we obtain a map @xmath139 .",
    "pre - composing this map with any embedding of @xmath140 into @xmath99 induced by an embedding of the set @xmath137 $ ] into @xmath138 $ ] , we get an automorphism of @xmath140 , namely , an isomorphism from @xmath140 to the group of symmetries of a face :        here , @xmath142 denotes the pure braid group on @xmath9 strands , and @xmath143 denotes the group of pure spherical braids on four strands .",
    "spherical braids live in @xmath144 , as opposed to @xmath145 , which means that one strand wrapping all the way around the others is trivial , as shown for strand @xmath146 on the right , and similarly for all other strands .",
    "this defines the quotient map @xmath147 above .    for @xmath148 ,",
    "take any spherical braid on four strands , pull the last strand straight , and consider the first three strands as a braid in the complement of strand @xmath1 .",
    "the target space of this map is the group of regular pure @xmath98-braids factored out by the full twist of the three strands : pull the @xmath1-th strand straight on the left side of the spherical relation shown in the figure on the right , and observe that what we get is a full twist of the first @xmath98 strands , which then has to be trivial in the image ."
