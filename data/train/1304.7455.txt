    "the breit equation @xcite has traditionally @xcite considered to be singular and has never been tried to solve itself . instead , the pauli approximation or a generalized foldy - wouthysen transformation has been applied to derive the effective hamiltonian @xmath4 , consisting of the schrdinger hamiltonian @xmath5 and many other relativistic correction terms @xcite @xcite .",

    "the total energy of the system @xmath16 can be expressed as @xmath17 the momentum operator in ( [ eq:1 ] ) can be written as @xmath18 introducing the operator @xmath19 canonically conjugate to @xmath20 .",

    "the two particle system can be classified by the total angular momentum and its z - component and parity . in so doing it is sufficient to specify spin angular parts of the large - large components @xmath29 to be    @xmath30    where @xmath31 is the quantum number for the orbital angular momentum .",
