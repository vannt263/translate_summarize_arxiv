    "reaction - diffusion ( rd ) systems are inherent in many branches of physics , chemistry , biology , ecology etc .",
    "the review of the theory and applications of reaction - diffusion systems one can find in books and numerous articles ( see , for example@xcite ) .",
    "the popularity of the rd system is driven by the underlying richness of the nonlinear phenomena , which include stationary and spatio - temporary dissipative pattern formation , oscillations , different types of chemical waves , excitability , bistability etc .",
    "the mechanism of the formation of such type of nonlinear phenomena and the conditions of their emergence have been extensively studied during the last couple decades .",
    "although the mathematical theory of such type of phenomena has not been developed yet due to the essential nonlinearity of these systems , from the viewpoint of the applied and experimental mathematics , the pattern of possible phenomena in rd system is more or less understandable .    in the recent years",
    ", there has been a great deal of interest in fractional reaction - diffusion ( frd ) systems @xcite which from one side exhibit self - organization phenomena and from the other side introduce a new parameter to these systems , which is a fractional derivative index , and it gives a greater degree of freedom for diversity of self - organization phenomena . at the same time , the process of analyzing such frd systems is much complicated from the analytical and numerical point of view .    in this article , we consider two coupled reaction - diffusion systems :    the first one is the classical system    @xmath0    @xmath1    where @xmath2 @xmath3 ; @xmath4 , @xmath5 @xmath3  two variables , @xmath6 , @xmath7 @xmath3 are the nonlinear sources of the system modeling their production rates , @xmath8 @xmath3  characteristic times and lengths of the system , @xmath9 @xmath3  is an external parameter    and the other model is the fractional rd system @xmath10 @xmath11 with the same parameters and fractional derivatives @xmath12 on the left hand side of equations ( [ 3]),([4 ] ) instead of standard time derivatives , which are the caputo fractional derivatives in time of the order @xmath13 and are represented as @xcite    @xmath14    the article is devoted to the second problem and the first one we need for comparing the obtained results with classical one",
    ".    equations ( [ 3]),([4 ] ) at @xmath15 correspond to standard rd system described by equations ( [ 1]),([2 ] ) . at @xmath16",
    "they describe anomalous sub - diffusion and at @xmath17   - anomalous superdiffusion .    in this paper",
    ", we always assume that the following conditions are fulfilled on the boundaries 0;@xmath18 :    \\(i ) neumann : @xmath19    \\(ii ) periodic : @xmath20 where @xmath21",
    "stability of the steady - state constant solutions of the system ( [ 3]),([4 ] ) correspond to homogeneous equilibrium states @xmath22 can be analyzed by linearization of the system nearby this solution . in this case",
    "the system ( [ 3])([4 ] ) can be transformed to linear system @xmath23 where @xmath24 @xmath25 @xmath26 @xmath27 @xmath28 @xmath29 ( all derivatives are taken at homogeneous equilibrium states ( condition ( [ e ] ) ) . by substituting the solution @xmath30 into frd system ( [ 3]),([4 ] )",
    "we can get the system of linear ordinary differential equations ( [ lin ] ) with the matrix @xmath31 determined by the operator @xmath32 , the stability conditions of which are given by eigenvalues of this matrix .",
    "let us analyze the stability of the solution ( [ e ] ) of the linear system with integer derivatives and find the conditions of this instability ( see , for example:@xcite ) .",
    "we repeat this process in order to compare the results obtained with the results of the fractional rd system considered in this article . in this case , by searching for the solution of the linear system in the form @xmath33 , we get a homogeneous system of linear algebraic equations for constants @xmath34 .",
    "the solubility of this system leads to the characteristic equation    @xmath35    where @xmath36 @xmath37  is the identity matrix . as a result ,",
    "the characteristic equation takes on a form of a simple quadratic equation @xmath38 the linear boundary value problem for rd system ( [ 1]),([2 ] ) is unstable according to inhomogeneous wave vectors @xmath39 if ( @xmath40 ) @xmath41 , \\label{tu}\\ ] ] @xmath42 ( turing bifurcation ) and according to homogenous ( @xmath43 ) fluctuations ( hopf bifurcation ) if ( @xmath44 ) @xmath45    for analyzing the equations ( [ 3]),([4 ] ) let us also consider a linear system obtained near the homogeneous state ( [ e ] ) . as a result",
    ", the simple linear transformation can convert this linear system to a diagonal form    @xmath46    where @xmath47 is a diagonal matrix of @xmath31 : @xmath48 eigenvalues @xmath49 are determined by the same characteristic equation ( [ aa ] ) with matrix ( [ a ] ) , @xmath50 @xmath51  is the matrix of eigenvectors of matrix @xmath31 .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     the systems have rich dynamics , including steady state dissipative structures , homogeneous and nonhomogeneous oscillations , and spatiotemporal patterns . in this paper",
    ", we focus mainly on the study of general properties of the solutions depending on the value of @xmath52 .    as discussed in section 2 , there are two different regions in parameter @xmath53 , where the system can be stable or unstable . in the case of @xmath15 the steady state solutions in the form of nonhomogeneous dissipative structures are inherent to unstable region @xmath54 . figures [ rys6](a)-(c ) show the steady state dissipative structure formation and figures [ rys6 ] ( d)-(f ) present the spatio - temporal evolution of dissipative structures , which eventually leads to homogeneous oscillations .    on the figure [ rys6](a)-(d ) , the value @xmath55 increases from  @xmath56 to @xmath57 and on this whole interval the structures are in steady state .",
    "this is due to the case @xmath58 , the oscillatory perturbations are damping , and we can see that small oscillations are at the transition period @xmath59 with increasing @xmath55 , the steady state structures change to the spatio - temporary behavior ( figure [ rys6](e)-(f ) ) .",
    "the emergence of homogeneous oscillations , which destroy pattern formation ( figure [ rys6](e),(f ) )   has deep physical meaning .",
    "the matter is that the stationary dissipative structures consist of smooth and sharp regions of variable @xmath60 , and the smooth shape of @xmath61 .",
    "the linear system analysis shows that the homogeneous distribution of the variables is unstable according to oscillatory perturbations inside the wide interval of @xmath62 which is much wider then interval ( @xmath63 ) . at the same time , smooth distributions at the maximum and minimum values of @xmath60 are @xmath64 correspondingly . in the first approximation",
    ", these smooth regions of the dissipative structures resemble homogeneous ones and are located inside the instability regions . as a result ,",
    "the unstable fluctuations lead to homogeneous oscillations , and the dissipative structures destroy themselves .",
    "we can conclude that oscillatory modes in such type fodes have a much wider attraction region than the corresponding region of the dissipative structures .",
    "for a wide range of the parameters @xmath65 , the numerical solutions of the brusselator problem show similar behavior ( figure [ rys7](a)-(d ) ) .",
    "the stationary solutions emerge practically in the same way . at small @xmath65",
    ", we see aperiodic formation of the structures , and approaching @xmath66 , the damping oscillations of the dissipative structures arise . at @xmath67",
    "certain non - stationary structures arise ( figure [ rys7](e ) ) . in this case",
    ", the dissipative structures look quite similar to those we obtained for regular system @xcite .",
    "the increase of @xmath55 leads to a larger amplitude of pulsation .",
    "all these patterns are robust with respect to small initial perturbations .",
    "the further increase of @xmath55 leads to spatially temporary chaos ( figure [ rys7](f ) ) .",
    "in the contrast to previous case , such nonhomogeneous behavior is stable and does not lead to homogeneous oscillations .",
    "the matter is that in brusselator model , the dissipative structures are much grater in amplitude and do not have smooth distribution at the top .",
    "it should be noted that the pulsation phenomena of the dissipative structures is closely related to the oscillation solutions of the ode ( figures [ rys4 ] , [ rys5 ] ) .",
    "moreover , the fractional derivative of the first variable has the most impact on the oscillations emergence .",
    "it can be obtained by performing a simulation where the first variable is a fractional derivative and the second one is an integer .",
    "it should be emphasized that the distribution of @xmath61 , within the solution , only shows a small deviation from the stationary value ( that is why this variable is not represented in the figures ) .",
    "in this article we developed a linear theory of instability of reaction diffusion system with fractional derivatives .",
    "the introduced new parameter ",
    "marginal value @xmath66 plays the role of bifurcation parameter .",
    "if the fractional derivative index @xmath52 is smaller than @xmath66 , the system of fodes is stable and has oscillatory damping solutions . at @xmath68 ,",
    "the fodes becomes unstable , and we obtain oscillatory or even more complex - quasi chaotic solutions . in addition , the stable and unstable domains of the system were investigated .    by the computer simulation of the fractional reaction - diffusion systems we provided evidence that pattern formation in the fractional case , at @xmath55 less than a certain value , is practicably the same as in the regular case scenario @xmath15 . at @xmath69 ,",
    "the kinetics of formation becomes oscillatory . at @xmath70 ,",
    "the oscillatory mode arises and can lead to homogeneous or nonhomogeneous oscillations . in the last case scenario ,",
