    "quasiparticles serve as the cornerstone of complex collective phenomena in interacting many - body systems . as an example",
    ", the polaron , an impurity dressed by particle - hole excitations from the environment , is a typical quasiparticle that has stimulated much interest in the study of solid - state and cold - atom systems with highly polarized components . in cold atoms ,",
    "polarons have been successfully explored in both the attractive and the repulsive branches of impurities interacting with a fermi sea of identical fermions  @xcite .",
    "these studies are crucial for understanding the nature of normal states either against pairing physics in the case of strong attraction  @xcite , or in the context of itinerant ferromagnetism with strong repulsion  @xcite",
    ". however , much less is known about the fate of impurities immersed in a fermi superfluid , where the impurity can be dressed by pairs of particles in the superfluid  @xcite . given the growing number of experiments on atomic mixtures , it becomes pressing to understand the fundamental physics of the underlying quasiparticles , such as polarons , in these systems .",
    "particularly , in the recent ens experiment , a mixture of bose and fermi superfluids has been realized  @xcite .",
    "the two superfluids not only coexist , but also interact with each other , constituting the most charming character of this system . how to characterize the interaction energy between these two superfluids , however , is still an open question .",
    "exact three - body calculations show that , in the bec limit of fermions , the interaction between a bosonic atom and a molecule of two fermions can not be faithfully described by the mean - field theory , even when the boson - fermion scattering length is small  @xcite .",
    "it then becomes essential to investigate the validity of the mean - field theory on the many - body level throughout the whole bcs - bec crossover regime of fermions , and identify the underlying mechanism wherever it fails to apply .",
    "here , we approach this goal via the study of polarons .",
    "we use the variational approach to investigate the polaron physics when an impurity is immersed in a fermi superfluid with tunable interactions . with a pairing superfluid as the background , the polaron wave function naturally acquires trimer - like terms which originate from the impurity - induced pair - breaking processes in the superfluid bath . as a result",
    ", the polaron spectrum is composed of both impurity- and trimer - dominated solutions . due to the couplings inbetween , many avoided level crossings occur , whose widths depend sensitively on both the interaction strength and the effective range of the system . in particular ,",
    "as fermions are tuned from the bcs to the bec side , the widths of the avoided crossings gradually increase , which suggests instabilities towards three - body losses . on the contrary , the widths become narrower at smaller effective ranges , which can help stabilizing the system . for small fermion - impurity scattering lengths , the second - order perturbation theory captures the essential effects of fermi superfluid and short - range physics in the system , and consequently shows the insufficiency of mean - field descriptions .",
    "these results rectify our understanding of interaction effects in multi - component mixtures on the mean - field level , and provide guidance for maintaining stability from three - body losses in cold atom experiments on mixtures .",
    "the paper is organized as the following : in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] , we outline the variational approach adopted in this work and provide details on the derivation of the equations used for the numerical evaluation of the polaron energy . in sec .  [",

    "the second term in the bracket , which effectively describes impurity - induced pair breaking in the superfluid and is therefore trimer - like , includes contributions from excitations like @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 or @xmath28 . as a first attempt at the problem",

    "note that it is convenient to express the fermion - fermion interaction term in @xmath31 in terms of the scattering between different quasiparticle states : @xmath32 .",
    "since in the large@xmath33 limit , @xmath34 , only one term has finite contribution to the energy : @xmath35    we then have the equations : @xmath36    as @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) would become vanishingly small after renormalization , terms including @xmath39 , where @xmath40 at large momentum @xmath41 , should also vanish .",

    "<S> we study a new type of fermi polaron induced by an impurity interacting with an ultracold fermi superfluid . due to the three - component nature of the system , </S>",
    "<S> the polaron can become trimer - like with a non - universal energy spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> we identify multiple avoided crossings between impurity- and trimer - like solutions in both the attractive and the repulsive polaron spectra . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the widths of avoided crossings gradually increase as the fermi superfluid undergoes a crossover from the bcs side towards the bec side , which suggests instabilities towards three - body losses . </S>",
    "<S> such losses can be reduced for interaction potentials with small effective ranges . </S>",
    "<S> we also demonstrate , using the second - order perturbation theory , that the mean - field evaluation of the fermion - impurity interaction energy is inadequate even for small fermion - impurity scattering lengths , due to the essential effects of fermi superfluid and short - range physics in such a system . </S>",
    "<S> our results are practically useful for cold atom experiments on mixtures . </S>"
