    "magnetic biosensing techniques have shown great promise in terms of providing a matrix - insensitive biosensing platform for future use in point - of - care medical diagnostics@xcite .",
    "these techniques center on the detection of magnetic particles which are used as tags for analytes of interest in biological fluids ( fig .",

    "conventional sensing with such structures is achieved via the detection of magnetic - particle - induced changes to the static magnetic configuration within these ( typically multilayered ) ferromagnetic devices ( fig .",

    "thus , like hall effect sensors@xcite , they offer a sensing method based on detecting changes to a d.c . voltage level .",
    "recently , attention has begun to turn towards the possibility to exploit the magnetic field dependence@xcite of resonant magnetization dynamics for particle sensing@xcite .",
    "the consequence of this dependence is that the precession frequency of the magnetization , typically in the giga - hertz range , will be altered by particle - generated magnetic fields ( fig .",
    "[ f1](c ) ) , potentially enabling an intrinsically frequency - based rather than amplitude - based sensing technique @xcite .",
    "notably , the stray fields generated by the particles act directly on the resonance , not requiring particle - induced changes to the magnetic ground state of the system for detection .",
    "indeed , there are number of reasons to motivate the investigation of such methods . for example , dynamics can be induced and measured even at large external fields @xcite where particle moments , and thus particle - generated fields ( the basis of particle detection ) can be maximized .",
    "furthermore , using ( e.g. ) spin torque oscillators,@xcite it is possible to efficiently probe and read out such dynamics electrically in real time@xcite ( potentially enabling high speed sensing for applications such as cytometry@xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , in the latter devices , favorable signal to noise ratios can be retained down to sub-100 nm device length scales@xcite .",
    "indeed here we will demonstrate particle detection using a particular resonance confined laterally to a region with size on the order of @xmath1 nm@xmath2 .",
    "magnonic crystals ( mcs ) are attractive systems to explore the fundamentals of such a sensing technique .",
    "mcs are magnetic materials which have been artificially patterned ( typically at the nanoscale ) to control spin - wave ( magnon ) propagation or enable periodic confinement of nano - localized ferromagnetic resonances@xcite ( e.g.  fig .",
    "[ f1](d ) ) .",
    "high levels of periodicity over large length scales mean that these localized resonant modes ( analogous to those excited in isolated nanostructures ) can be probed easily in laboratory settings in macroscopic samples . beyond their envisioned applications in data and signal processing@xcite , we have previously demonstrated that mcs can be used to understand the influence of magnetic fields generated by magnetic nanoparticles on highly localized ( or ` confined ' ) ferromagnetic resonances.@xcite notably , using a hole - based structure enables the localization of particles within the holes with a subsequent predictable local modification of the resonant precession of the magnetization in the neighborhood of the captured particle .",
    "an example of this can be seen in fig .",
    "[ f1](d ) as a change in the color - coded precession amplitude to the left and right of the hole - localized nanoparticle . more recently",
    ", similar effects were confirmed numerically in another hole - based mc geometry@xcite .    in this paper",
    "we demonstrate the successful use of nano - localized ferromagnetic resonances for the detection of magnetic particles with a range of diameters spanning 3 orders of magnitude : from sub-10 nm superparamagnetic iron - oxide nanoparticles to 4 @xmath0 m wide magnetic beads .",
    "this particle size range also approximates a correspondingly large range of biological length scales , from single proteins to cells .",
    "we will explicitly show the advantage of using hole based structures for the localization of both modes and particles , the latter ensuring a common , and thus reinforcing effect , from individual particles .",
    "indeed we show that the sensitivity is an order of magnitude less when using an unpatterned continuous ferromagnetic layer .",
    "there , the dominant effect is from the stray field extending far outside the particles which is weak compared to that beneath or directly neighboring each particle . when particles are within the mc s holes the localization of different modes around each hole in the patterned case defines the sign of the frequency shift .",
    "this shift polarity is maintained and its amplitude increased at high coverages where quasi - continuous particle sheets are formed .",
    "however by increasing the particle size to a degree in which the particle can not enter the holes , we lose the mode - dependent shift polarities with all modes behaving similar to the fundamental mode of a continuous layer in that their frequencies all increase .",
    "varying the particle size can thus enable a transition to a film - like behavior , albeit with multiple modes exisiting in the mc .",
    "note that all particles studied in this work exhibit a quasi - null magnetic moment in zero field ( as checked via magnetometry ) and thus minimal agglomeration .",
    "we first consider the case of particle - induced resonance shifts in continuous , _ unpatterned _ magnetic layers where resonant dynamics are typically laterally uniform across the layer .",
    "[ funiform](a ) shows a schematic of the dipole field of a magnetic particle acting on an underlying magnetic film subject to an external in - plane static field , @xmath3 .",
    "the in - plane component of the particle s field , @xmath4 , is strong and opposes @xmath3 directly below the particle ( in region ` 2 ' , fig .",
    "[ funiform](a ) , and to the sides of the particle , the latter due to the symmetry of the dipolar @xmath4 ) . elsewhere",
    "( regions ` 1 ' and ` 3 ' , fig .",
    "[ funiform](a ) ) the in - plane component of @xmath4 is weaker but reinforces @xmath3 . subsequently , although a bare , thin magnetic layer has one primary resonance mode ( which corresponds to the spatially uniform fundamental mode , shown as a solid line in fig .",
    "[ funiform](b ) ) , an extra , low frequency mode appears in simulation when isolated particles are on top of the film . note that these simulation results assume one 150 nm particle 10 nm above every @xmath5 nm@xmath2 of film ( further simulation details are given in experimental section ) .",
    "the low frequency mode is located beneath the particle and to its sides where @xmath4 opposes @xmath3 ( see bottom left inset in fig .  [ funiform](b ) while comparing to region ` 2 ' in fig .  [ funiform](a ) ) . since the total field is reduced at that position , so",
    "is the resonance frequency . the majority of the dynamics within the layer are however concentrated in the remainder of the computation region as seen in the bottom right inset in fig .",
    "[ funiform](b ) ( these areas correspond to regions ` 1 ' and ` 3 ' in fig .",
    "[ funiform](a ) ) .",
    "this mode is slightly upshifted due to the weak @xmath4 in those regions reinforcing @xmath3 , thus increasing the total field .",
    "notably , at a particle - layer separation of 10 nm , the maximum in - plane @xmath4 directly below a single , perfectly spherical particle will be approximately 15 times higher than the maximum in - plane @xmath4 at the upper / lower boundaries of the computation cell .",
    "this explains the disparity in the shift amplitudes seen for the dynamics concentrated in region ` 2 ' versus those concentrated in regions ` 1 ' and ` 3 ' .    in a field - resolved experimental fmr trace ( obtained at a fixed frequency , upper - left inset of fig .",
    "[ funiform](b ) ) , the particle - induced upshift of the primary resonance mode manifests as a downshifted resonance field for the fundamental mode since the reinforcing effect of @xmath6 reduces the magnitude of the external field which must be applied to obtain the resonance condition . in fig .",
    "[ funiform]c we show the consistently negative shift of the fundamental resonance for increasing particle coverages .",
    "different particle coverages were obtained by applying consecutively higher concentrations of particle - containing solutions to the film and measuring the fmr spectra between each application .",
    "note that the shift is highest for intermediate particle coverages ( figs .",
    "[ funiform](f - g ) ) where there are large numbers of isolated particles or clusters of particles on top of the layer .",
    "in contrast , low particle coverages ( figs .  [ funiform](d - e ) ) lead to a low reinforcing @xmath4 fields when averaged across the film ( and thus low shifts ) .",
    "the quasi - continuous particle layers at high coverages also generate relatively small shifts .",
    "this is likely because they approximate continuous layers which , ignoring the effects of roughness , generate negligible stray fields ( except at the layer boundaries ) .",
    "the simulated resonance frequency shift is 34 mhz ( @xmath7 mt given an experimentally measured slope of 49.4 ghz / t for the fundamental mode , see supporting fig .  1 ) .",
    "this is comparable to the maximum experimentally observed field shift in the continuous layer ( @xmath8 mt ) .",
    "thus , we can conclude that the weak shift observed for the continuous layer is not a result of a low field sensitivity of the resonance ( since it is actually quite high at almost 50 ghz@xmath9 t ) , but rather due to the dominant signal coming from portions of the film subject to the relatively weak reinforcing @xmath4 fields surrounding the particles ( i.e. regions ` 1 ' and 3 in fig .",
    "[ funiform](a ) ) rather than the more intense @xmath4 fields located directly beneath the particles .",
    "we now turn to the hole - containing nano - patterned mc where it is possible to have localized resonances in regions where @xmath4 is large .",
    "the main panel of fig .",
    "[ fmodes](a ) shows a simulated ferromagnetic resonance spectrum at @xmath10 mt for a mc with 300 nm wide holes on a 450 nm square lattice .",
    "the excitation spectrum is clearly much richer than the continuous layer with a number of modes , each having different localizations within the unit cell ( fig .",
    "[ fmodes](b ) ) .",
    "the simulated traces have been differentiated with respect to frequency for more natural comparison to experimental fmr traces .",
    "we will focus predominantly on the side mode ( sm , shown also in fig .",
    "[ f1](d ) ) and extended mode ( em ) with intermediate ( i m ) and edge modes ( edm ) discussed only briefly .",
    "while the sm is largely localized between horizontally neighboring holes , the em occurs over extended bands running between rows of holes orthogonal to the applied field ( fig .",
    "[ fmodes](b ) ) .",
    "im1 - 3 have similar localizations to that of the em .",
    "good agreement is found between the simulation and experiment for both the overall mode spectrum and the frequencies of the em and sm ( supporting figure 2 ) .",
    "depending on the spatial localization of each mode , the stray magnetic field from magnetized particles within the holes has a @xmath11component which can locally reinforce or oppose the @xmath11oriented external field@xcite .",
    "this is shown schematically for the sm and em in fig .",
    "[ fmodes](b ) ( one can consider the more localized modes as being nano - scale dynamic probes for the particle stray fields ) . since the @xmath11component of @xmath4 opposes @xmath3 where the sm is localized , the mode s frequency reduces due to a reduced net field at that location .",
    "this is seen in fig .",
    "[ fmodes](a ) where we have also included the simulated resonance spectrum in the presence of a 150 nm wide particle at the lateral center of an anti - dot . in contrast ,",
    "the em ( and edm ) resonances shift upwards in frequency since @xmath4 reinforces @xmath3 at the upper / lower parts of the unit cell .",
    "note that the confinement of the modes in well - defined regions close to the particle where the stray fields are strong ( i.e.  directly to the sides of the particle ( @xmath12 ) and directly in front of / behind it ( @xmath13 ) ) mean that significant shifts ( @xmath14 ghz ) are induced for both the em and sm ( even though the sensitivities of the em , sm and fundamental modes to static , uniform external fields are of the same order ) .",
    "the edm and ims are also subject to clear positive shifts in the presence of a hole - localized particle , consistent with the fact that they , like the em , have their dynamics concentrated in the upper / lower portions of the unit cell ( subject to @xmath15 ) .",
    "following the same protocol as for the continuous layer in the previous section , we measured the sm and em shifts versus particle concentration in a 300 nm mc experimentally .",
    "the em resonance field decreases since @xmath4 increases the local field ( fig .",
    "[ f130](a ) ) .",
    "the consequence of this is that the resonance can be attained experimentally at a lower @xmath3 .",
    "the resonance fields of im1 - 3 , which have an em - like localization , also shift downward in experiment ( supporting figure 4 ) in contrast , the sm resonance field increases because @xmath4 locally shields the sm from @xmath3 ( fig .",
    "[ f130]b ) .",
    "this means that a larger @xmath3 must be applied to attain the resonance condition .",
    "as seen previously for low coverages@xcite , we observe a continuing increase of the shift magnitudes with particle coverage over a very wide range of coverages ( fig .",
    "[ f130](c ) ) . for lower nanoparticle solution concentrations ,",
    "the majority of particles are found within the holes ( figs .",
    "[ f130](d , e ) ) with both the percentage of filled holes and the percentage of particles lying within the holes increasing with the concentration of the particle solution ( supporting figure 3 ) .",
    "saturation of the shifts commences at the penultimate concentration where a quasi - continuous layer of particles form ( figs .  [ f130](g , h ) ) .",
    "notably , the maximum shifts in the mc are , as expected , significantly higher ( about @xmath16 ) than the maximum shift observed in the continuous layer .",
    "note that the continuous layer data from fig .",
    "[ funiform](a ) has been plotted with the mc data in fig .",
    "[ f130](c ) to enable direct comparison .",
    "another point to note is that while the continuous layer resonance field shifts decreases when a quasi - continuous particle sheet forms , in the mc , sheet formation increases the observed shifts , an effect which is reproduced below .",
    "we first discuss the reproduction of the observed shift for the em and sm ( fig .",
    "[ f130](c ) ) at 0.225 @xmath0g.@xmath0l@xmath17 where there is approximately 1 particle in each hole ( e.g.  fig .",
    "[ f130](e ) ) .",
    "this could be done by adding a 150 nm wide particle to the simulation at the hole center and observing the resultant resonance shifts . a good reproduction of the shifts observed at high coverages",
    "could also be obtained .",
    "there , we replaced the particle with a disk ( diameter 40 nm less than the hole diameter ) which was covered by a contiguous 150 nm continuous layer .",
    "this successfully approximated the effect of the well filled - holes ( e.g.  figs .",
    "[ f130](g , h ) ) covered by a semi - complete particle sheet , as observed at high particle solution concentrations .",
    "the agreement between simulation and experiment for the em and sm can be seen in fig .",
    "[ f130](c ) which shows the field - averaged simulated shifts for the em and sm for one particle per hole ( horizontal dashed line ) and full particle coverage ( solid dashed line ) .",
    "there is excellent agreement between these values and the shifts experimentally obtained respectively at the fourth and final coverages .",
    "experimental and simulated shifts obtained at different fields are shown in fig .",
    "[ fawesome ] .",
    "experimentally , different resonance fields are obtained by changing the r.f .",
    "frequency and it is the data in this figure which has been averaged to obtain the points in fig .  [",
    "f130](c ) . here",
    "one can again see explicitly that the resonance fields decrease with coverage at each frequency for the em ( leading to leftward slanting data in fig .",
    "[ fawesome](a ) ) but increase for the sm ( leading to rightward slanting data in fig .",
    "[ fawesome](b ) ) .",
    "the simulated shifts obtained explicitly for different @xmath3 values , taking into account the field - dependent moment of the particles@xcite could notably also reproduce the experimentally observed field - dependencies of the resonance field shifts at the fourth and final coverages ( fig .",
    "[ fawesome ] ) .",
    "the most intuitive of these dependencies is a reduced shift at very low fields for the sm mode where the field - dependent particle moment ( and thus resultant stray field ) is weak ( fig .",
    "[ fawesome](b ) ) . in general",
    "though , increasing the field does not strongly change the size of the shifts meaning that the external field can be incnreased to maximize the particle moments without compromising the frequency shift .",
    "we finally note that particle sensing was also demonstrated with a second mc having smaller holes ( 240 nm ) but the same lattice pitch .",
    "analogous effects were observed except that the shifts were reduced .",
    "the shifts could albeit be reproduced by assuming a filling proportional to the hole size ( supporting figure 5 ) .",
    "this is consistent with the reduced shifts being due to a reduced capability of filling rather than an intrinsically lower field sensitivity of the modes . indeed",
    "the intrinsic field sensitivities are similar to the mc with 300 nm holes ( supporting figure 2 ) .      in figs .",
    "[ fmnpsize](a - d ) , we show shifts in the em resonance field induced by particles with ( average or supplier - stated ) diameters of 6 nm , 50 nm , 0.88 @xmath0 m and 4 @xmath0 m .",
    "clear shifts are observed in all cases , demonstrating the compatibility of this sensing method with a very large range of particle sizes .",
    "as explained below however , the polarities of the observed shifts depends on the size of the particles relative to the size of the holes . before concentrating on the shift polarities",
    ", we briefly note that as seen in figs .",
    "[ f130](a , b ) and [ fmnpsize](a - d ) , the dominant effect of both nanoparticles and beads is typically a resonance shift , albeit accompanied by a relatively weak degree of linewidth broadening ( discussed below ) . exceptions to this are the 0.88 @xmath0 m particles and the highest coverage scenario for the 6 nm particles where broadening and shifts are more comparable .    the same opposing sm and em shift directions seen in fig .",
    "[ f130](c ) for the 130 nm particles were observed for two other particle types , the common aspect of these particles being that they could enter the mc s holes thanks to their small size : 6 nm wide particles ( fig .",
    "[ fmnpsize](a ) and supporting figure 6 ) and 50 nm wide particles ( figs .",
    "[ fmnpsize](b , e - g ) ) . in both cases ,",
    "the overall trend is again a stronger shift with increasing particle coverage .",
    "this is seen clearly in figs .",
    "[ fmnpsize](a , b ) showing consecutively larger shifts of the em resonance for both particle sizes .",
    "note that a clear sm shift was seen for the 6 nm particles only at the highest concentration ( supporting figure 6 ) .    as already highlighted for the 130 nm particles ( and seen clearly in fig .",
    "[ fmnpsize](g ) for the 50 nm particles ) there can also be significant numbers of isolated ( groups of ) small particles on the mc surface which can of course also generate resonance shifts .",
    "indeed , these shifts can be comparable in magnitude to those observed for hole - localized particles , especially when the particles are directly above the position where a mode s dynamics are concentrated .",
    "in contrast to the fundamental mode in the continuous film , due to geometrical confinement , the modes in the mc are inherently localized and indeed can be localized directly beneath a particle . in such a situation , the whole region containing the mode will be subject to the strong @xmath4 below the particle which opposes @xmath3 ( position ` 2 ' in fig .",
    "[ funiform](a ) ) , thus decreasing the resonance frequency .",
    "this has been shown explicitly via simulation for three different surface positions in fig .",
    "[ f5](a ) where simulated shifts of the em and sm mode due to surface - located particles are compared to the shifts induced by a particle at the center of the hole .",
    "for example , when a particle is above the sm mode , shown as case i in fig .",
    "[ f5](a ) , its frequency is strongly downshifted due to @xmath4 locally opposing @xmath3 ( the sm is localized in region ` 2 ' in fig .",
    "[ funiform](a ) ) . in this case",
    "the em frequency will be slightly upshifted ( the em will be localized in regions ` 1 ' and 3 in fig .  [ funiform](a ) where @xmath4 is weaker but reinforces @xmath3 ) .",
    "similarly , when the particle is lying above the em , the em frequency is strongly downshifted whereas the sm frequency is slightly upshifted ( cases iii and iv in fig .",
    "[ f5](a ) ) .",
    "the critical point to remember here though is that the placement of small particles on the mc s upper surface is quite random within the unit cell . as a result , and as observed in experiment , the observed shifts will be dominated by hole - localized particles due to their common , preferential in - hole localization . as already shown though , the effect of a quasi - continuous layer of particles is such that it reinforces the effect of hole - localized particles .    in fig .",
    "[ f5](b ) , we show the linewidth broadening observed for the sm and em due to application of the 130 nm particles onto the 300 nm mc .",
    "notably , broadening is highest ( increase of @xmath18 ) around the 6th coverage ( fig .",
    "[ f130](g ) ) where there is a large number of isolated particles ( or groups of particles ) on the mc s upper surface .",
    "these mid - to - high coverages lead to relatively high numbers of isolated particles on the surface which can locally modify the underlying modes , as discussed above . given the position - dependence of the shifts ( fig .",
    "[ f5](a ) ) , linewidth broadening is not unexpected since surface - located particles can both increase and decrease the resonant fields , depending on their location ( fig .",
    "[ f5](a ) ) .",
    "the formation of a quasi - continuous layer of particles at higher coverages however , would be expected to reduce the strong localized fields generated underneath the particles . indeed , at these higher coverages , there is a slight reduction of the linewidth ( fig .  [ f5](b ) ) consistent with a reduced contribution from isolated surface - located particles .",
    "we also note that distributions in the particle sizes ( as can be identified in figs .",
    "[ f130](d - h ) ) will also contribute to linewidth broadening since smaller ( larger ) particles will generate smaller ( larger ) shifts ( supporting figure 7 ) .",
    "this broadening will be in a common direction however since both smaller and larger hole - localized particles generate shifts of the polarity shift .",
    "strongly opposes @xmath3",
    "( position ` 2 ' in fig .  [ funiform](a ) ) .",
    "weaker increases in the other mode are observed since @xmath4 will weakly reinforce @xmath3 ( positions ` 1 ' and ` 3 ' in fig .",
    "[ funiform](a ) ) .",
    "although the induced shifts can be large , the observation of such a shift will be highly dependent on having this particular particle placement .",
    "note that , vertical distances in the schematic are proportional to the simulated frequency shifts .",
    "( b ) experimentally observed changes in em and sm resonance linewidths as a function of 130 nm particle concentrations applied to 300 nm mc .",
    "the error bars are a measure of the spread of linewidth broadening across the measured frequency range , 11.5 - 16 ghz .",
    "data for the lowest four concentrations are taken from @xcite.,width=264 ]    we now turn to particle diameters which are larger than the hole diameter , 0.88 @xmath0 m ( fig .",
    "[ fmnpsize](c , h - j ) ) and 4 @xmath0 m ( fig .  [ fmnpsize](d ) and supporting figure 6 ) , we see that both the sm and em modes are characterized by negative polarity field shifts .",
    "this mirrors the behavior observed for the fundamental mode in the continuous layer , suggesting that , for large particles which are not predominantly hole - localized , the dominant shift , as for the continuous layer , comes from in - plane field components , here generated by large microbeads quasi - randomly distributed on the mc surface . indeed , despite some centering of the 0.88 @xmath0 m particles on top of holes at low concentrations ( two bottom right particles in fig .",
    "[ fmnpsize](i ) ) , they are indeed typically randomly distributed across the mc . unlike the case of the small particles however , there are no hole - localized particles which can act in unison to induce different polarity shifts on the em and sm . as a result , for purely surface - localized beads , both the em and sm shift in the same direction",
    "magnetic particle detection is critical for magnetic biosensing techniques which have envisioned use in point of care medical diagnostics .",
    "this detection is often carried out using conventional magnetoresistive sensors .",
    "looking towards the development of alternative frequency - based sensing methods however , we have demonstrated here the use of nano - confined ferromagnetic resonance modes for magnetic particle sensing .",
    "this has been carried out for a range of magnetic particles with sizes from 6 nm to 4 @xmath0 m .",
    "the stray fields of the particles act directly on the precessing moments generating significant shifts in the resonance fields and frequencies . as such",
    ", the observed resonance shifts in our hole - based patterned ferromagnet can be maintained over large ranges of fields , enabling resonance - based nanoparticle detection in strong fields where particle moments can be maximized .",
    "furthermore , the dominant effect is typically a resonance shift rather than a broadening of the resonance linewidth , a result which is encouraging for the implementation of a sensing method based on detecting changes to resonance frequencies .    in this work",
    ", we also identified different characteristics in the resonance shifts for small and large particles . for small particles , their preferential capture in our system s nano - holes means that the majority of them act on the resonance modes in unison , generating clear , mode - dependent resonance shifts and mode - dependent shift polarities which persist up to extremely high particle coverages .",
    "shifts at intermediate and large coverages of small particles can be well reproduced via simulation .",
    "in contrast to the case of the small particles however , the effect of microbeads is analogous to that seen in continuous films with the two major resonance modes both shifting weakly in the same direction .",
    "this is due to a lack of particle localization with respect to the spatially periodic nano - scale regions where the modes are localized .",
    "although sub - optimal , detection was nevertheless achieved in such geometries , albeit with low resonance shifts which were similar to those seen in continuous films .",
    "note that the ability to detect particles is determined not only by how sensitive the frequency is to changes in magnetic field but by the ability to generate clear modifications to these frequencies due to favorable particle positioning .",
    "a proper choice of particle size and reliable positioning of particles close to well localized modes is thus a critical factor in resonance based sensing .",
