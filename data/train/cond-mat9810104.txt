    "the technical advances in the manipulation of single molecules has enabled the probe of mechanical and relaxational measurement in both equilibrium@xcite and non - equilibrium conditions@xcite . among the first of such experiments",
    "was the investigation of the elastic response of @xmath4 - bacteriophage dna ( @xmath4 dna ) molecules subject to tension@xcite .",
    "these experiments and others have offered a window into the behavior of biological molecules on scales ranging from several nanometer to few microns .",
    "they also provide an opportunity to understand the limits of validity of theories based on generic polymer models such as edwards model or simple model of semiflexible chain such as the worm like chain ( wlc ) model .",
    "the earliest theories describing the elastic response of wlc subject to tension , which appear to be relevant to the experiments of smith et al.@xcite , were due to fixman and kovac @xcite and crabb and kovac@xcite .",
    "the precise experiments made possible by nanomanipulation of single molecules @xcite has demanded more accurate theories . in these experiments the response to a constant force on a magnetic bead attached to @xmath4 dna in a solution of varying salt concentration is used to probe dna elasticity . after these pioneering experiments were reported several theoretical studies followed@xcite .",
    "these papers showed that , when the salt concentration is sufficiently large , then the simple wlc model subject to tension quantitatively reproduces the force - extension curves .",
    "in particular , the asymptotic approach to full extension at large force , was shown to follow the @xmath5 law , where @xmath0 is the external force .    since dna",
    "is highly charged one expects ion effects to be extremely important in determining the elasticity .",
    "it has recently been established that the elastic response and persistence length of dna greatly depend not only on the salt concentration but also on the valence of counterions@xcite . as in the case of simple polyelectrolytes , systematic theories of dna subject to tension is difficult due to the presence of several competing length scales . in particular , at intermediate values of the external force , the interplay of several forces , namely intrinsic persistence length , electrostatic repulsion , counterion fluctuation , all conspire to determine the conformation of dna .",
    "marko and siggia@xcite included the effects of electrostatic interaction , within a wlc picture of dna by replacing the intrinsic persistence length by a scale dependent effective persistence length .",
    "such a description implicitly assumes that the intrinsic persistence length is large , and hence only small excursions in dna from rod - like conformations are tolerated .",
    "the interaction between the charges is assumed to obey the debye - hckel potential , @xmath6 .",
    "the ionic strength of the solution @xmath7 is related to the screening length @xmath8 through the relation @xmath9 , and the bjerrum length @xmath10 represents the strength of interaction .",
    "the scale dependent effective persistence length @xmath11 varies from @xmath12 ( in length scale @xmath13 ) to @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) , where @xmath16 @xcite with @xmath17 being the mean distance between charges .",
    "marko and siggia considered the limit when the applied force is so large that the angle fluctuation of tangent vector with respect to the direction of applied force is small which in consistent with the assumption of the osf theory@xcite .",
    "the chain extension @xmath18 in the presence of tension approaches @xmath19 like @xmath5 , in good agreement with experiment at large force .",
    "however , when the conformation of dna is coil - like ( at small force ) the theory shows strong deviation from experimental results .    in order to probe the effects of electrostatic interactions at small values of @xmath0 and @xmath7 we suggest a mean field variational approach .",
    "the mean field model of semiflexible chains successfully describes the conformation of the stretching dna by a constant force at high salt concentration , where the electrostatic interactions are negligible@xcite . in this model , the hard constraint on tangential vector @xmath20",
    "is replaced by a global constraint @xmath21 so that the average of the magnitude of a tangential vector @xmath22 is fixed even if the magnitude of tangential vectors fluctuate .",
    "this theory provides continuous crossover formula for the extension from the small force limit to the large force limit .",
    "in small force limit the extension @xmath18 increases linear whereas in large force limit the @xmath23 rule is found .",
    "the theory also reproduces quantitatively experimental the force - extension curves at high salt concentration .    in this paper",
    ", we include electrostatic interactions in the mean field model of semiflexible chain .",
    "this approach provides an adequate theory of dna elasticity in the small force limit .",
    "we compare our results with experiments at various salt concentrations .",
    "we model dna as a semiflexible worm like chain ( wlc ) with contour length @xmath19 .",
    "the chain can be parameterized by unit tangent vector @xmath24 , where @xmath25 represents the position vector in three dimensions at the curvilinear position @xmath26 .",
    "the energy cost for bending is characterized by the persistence length @xmath27 .",
    "the tangent vector for wlc chain satisfies the local geometric constraint @xmath20 for all @xmath26 .",
    "the enforcement of this constraint makes the theory for interacting wlc extremely difficult .",
    "recently , it has been shown@xcite that one can get reliable results for a number of problems involving semiflexible chains by replacing the local constraint @xmath20 by a global constraint @xmath21 .",
    "the resulting theory , which in the absence of interactions reduces to the model for semiflexible chains proposed by lagowski et al.@xcite , can be systematically derived from a functional integral approach .",
    "here we adopt this mean field model to investigate the effects of tension .",
    "the probability distribution for isolated wlc chain , which preserves the global constraint @xmath28 is given by @xmath29 .\\ ] ] the lagrange multiplier @xmath30 ( used to enforce the global constraint @xmath28 ) is ( roughly ) inversely proportional to the kuhn length @xmath31 of the semiflexible chain , and the constant @xmath32 is related to the persistence length @xmath27 .",
    "when the free energy of the non - interacting chain is optimized with respect to @xmath4 and we obtain @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",

    "the distribution function of the isolated semiflexible chain under tension is given by @xmath35\\ ] ] if the applied force is constant , @xmath36 has a uniform value for all @xmath26@xcite .",
    "it has been shown that this assumption gives a self - consistent solution to the stationary condition@xcite .",
    "the optimization of the free energy , in the presence of a constant force leads to the modified relation between @xmath37 and @xmath32 @xmath38 the mean square end - to - end distance of semiflexible chain under constant tension can be obtained as @xmath39",
    "the wlc under the influence of constant tension yields the correct dependence of the extension ( along the direction of the force ) of @xmath0 at relatively large value of the inverse debye screening length .",
    "however , precise experiments on dna have demonstrated that the simple elasticity model is inadequate to take electrostatic effects into account especially at small value of the @xmath0 and at low salt concentrations . since dna",
    "is highly charged the response of the chain to tension clearly depends on the ionic strength and to the valence of the counterions . in the presence of the external force",
    "there are four important length scales .",
    "they are the bjerrum length @xmath40 (= @xmath41 ) , the debye screening length @xmath42 , the persistence length @xmath27 , and the pincus length @xmath43@xcite . for monovalent ions @xmath44",
    "where @xmath45 is the salt(say nacl ) concentration .",
    "the persistence length is @xmath46 where @xmath14 is the bare persistence length and @xmath47 is the electrostatic contribution .",
    "although it is well accepted that for intrinsically stiff chain @xmath48 the dependence of @xmath47 on @xmath49 for flexible chains depends on a number of factors .",
    "since the conformation of dna subject to tension and salt can change from being rod - like to coil - like a proper description requires a detailed understanding of the scale dependence of @xmath47 .",
    "the presence of several length scales and the lack of simple theories for variation of @xmath47 with @xmath49 make the development of scaling theories for elasticity of dna under tension difficult .    in certain regimes ,",
    "however , one can devise a scaling type analysis . at low salt concentrations",
    "the coulomb repulsion between various charge residues leads to stiffening of the chain . consider the limit @xmath50 . in this case",
    "the chain can be modeled as being flexible on scales larger than @xmath2 . inside the electrostatic blob of size @xmath2 ,",
    "monomers are stretched due to the coulomb repulsion .",
    "now consider the case of small force ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "the mechanical force orients the chain along the tension axis on scales larger than @xmath52 .",
    "the extension is thus given by @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the number of monomers in a pincus blob , and @xmath55 with @xmath56 being the monomer size .",
    "the structure within a pincus blob is imagined to consists of several electrostatic blobs of size @xmath2 . within each pincus",
    "blob the mechanical forces are not relevant and the arrangement of electrostatic blobs is dictated by thermal fluctuations .",
    "thus , @xmath57 combining these eqs .",
    "( [ scaling1 ] ) and ( [ scaling2 ] ) , we get @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the usual flory exponent . for a highly charged object ,",
    "the excluded volume interactions are negligible , and hence it is appropriate to take @xmath60 whence we get at small force , @xmath61    the blob picture is not appropriate for intrinsically stiff chains under a large external force .",
    "this region corresponds to @xmath62 . in this case , the orientation of the tangent vector is correlated over scales larger than that determined by coulomb repulsion or mechanical energy .",
    "thus segments of chain of length @xmath2 are not independent of one another . in this case , as suggested by marko and siggia@xcite , we will show that the applied force effectively increases the persistence length of the chain . for values of @xmath63",
    "the chain adopts a highly stretched conformation . in the limit of large force in high salt concentrations coulomb interactions",
    "are unimportant .",
    "as discussed previously , the conformation here is entirely determined by the competition between entropic elasticity and mechanical energy . with this as the background we develop a detailed theory for dealing with electrostatic interactions , at the simple debye hckel level , for dna under tension .",
    "in order to take electrostatic effects into account we assume , for simplicity , that dna molecule is uniformly charged and each charged segment of the chain interacts via screened coulomb interactions .",
    "the hamiltonian of an isolated dna molecule consists of non - coulomb part @xmath64 and the electrostatic energy contribution @xmath65 .",

    "the chain becomes flexible on large scales and then adopts `` coil like '' conformation , although the chain is still stiff on small length scales .",
    "we use `` coil - like '' to imply that relatively large excursions from rod - like conformation are possible so that the gaussian approximation , which would be valid when @xmath74 is small , breaks down .    for this problem",
    "the gaussian approximation employed to treat the long range interaction to the wlc model is not valid@xcite .",
    "this can be seen by deviations from experiments in the extension - force curves at small forces.(see fig.(6 ) in ref.@xcite . )",
    "here we use a self - consistent variational theory to describe the effect of small force on the conformations of dna .    in order to estimate the size of the charged dna under tension we follow the uniform expansion method introduced by edwards and singh .",
    "accordingly , we write @xmath75 where @xmath76 hamiltonian and @xmath77 corresponds to the non - interacting theory in which @xmath31 is replaced by a effective kuhn length @xmath78 and @xmath79 is a perturbation in hamiltonian . the appropriate value of @xmath78 should satisfy ( see eq.([r2 ] ) . )",

    "in this section , we apply the functional integral method to obtain the force - extension relation of an intrinsically rigid chain in the limit of large force .",

    ", we provide a derivation of this result using a functional integral approach .",
    "it appears that when a large force is applied to the chain , the segments of the chain do not interfere with each other geometrically , because of tension induced stiffening occurs on scales from @xmath43 .",
    "if this assumption is valid the influence of the electrostatic interaction can be treated simply by replacing the persistence length @xmath27 by an effective persistence length @xmath158 . with this replacement",

    "such a theory would require using a more elaborate variational hamiltonian , perhaps , similar to the ones used recently to treat the persistence length of polyelectrolyte chains@xcite .    despite the success of the theory outlined here it is worth pointing out that the wlc can only explain the force - extension curves when the counterion is monovalent .",
    "it is only in the presence of monovalent ions that the electrostatic persistence length of dna displays the well accepted dependence on @xmath49 .",
    "baumann et al.@xcite have found that multivalent salt ions ( counterions ) have dramatically different effects on persistence length of dna . by performing force measurement using laser tweezers they discovered that not only valence but also the shape of counterions profoundly affect elasticity of single dna molecules .",
    "this observations and other findings by baumann et al.@xcite clearly suggest that theories and simulations that go beyond the simple debye - hckel theory will be required to provide a complete description of the response of dna to external tension . +",

    "<S> the effect of electrostatic interactions on the stretching of dna is investigated using a simple worm like chain model . in the limit of small force </S>",
    "<S> there are large conformational fluctuations which are treated using a self - consistent variational approach . for small values of the external force @xmath0 , we find theoreticlly and by a simple blob picture that the extension scales as @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the debye screening length . in the limit of large force the electrostatic effects can be accounted for within the semiflexible chain model of dna by assuming that only small excursions from rod - like conformations are possible . in this regime </S>",
    "<S> the extension approaches the contour length as @xmath3 where @xmath0 is the magnitude of the external force . </S>",
    "<S> the theory is used to analyze experiments that have measured the extension of double - stranded dna subject to tension at various salt concentrations . </S>",
    "<S> the theory reproduces nearly quantitatively the elastic response of dna at small and large values of @xmath0 and for all concentration of the monovalent counterions </S>",
    "<S> . the limitations of the theory are also pointed out . </S>"
