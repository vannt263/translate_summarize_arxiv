    "we give a refinement , showing that @xmath1 has direct sums if and only if the original category @xmath0 is lextensive @xcite .",
    "direct sums are of course understood in the bicategorical sense .",
    "a _ zero object _ in a bicategory is an object which is both initial and terminal . in a bicategory with finite products and finite coproducts",
    "in which the initial object is also terminal there is a canonical induced arrow @xmath366 , and we say that the bicategory has _ direct sums _ when this map is an equivalence .",
    "just as in the case of ordinary categories , the existence of direct sums gives rise to a calculus of matrices .",
    "a morphism @xmath367 can be represented by an @xmath368 matrix of morphisms between the summands , and composition can be represented by matrix multiplication .              for every object @xmath20",
    "there is a unique span @xmath373 . by uniqueness ,",
    "any map into @xmath374 must be invertible , and any two such with the same domain must be equal .",
    "thus when we compose the span with its opposite , as in @xmath375 , the resulting span is just @xmath376 .",
    "now by the universal property of @xmath371 once again , this must just be @xmath377 , and so @xmath378 , and our unique span @xmath379 is a map .",
    "clearly coproducts of maps are coproducts , and so the coproduct injections @xmath380 and @xmath381 are also maps .",
    "thus the coproducts in @xmath15 will restrict to @xmath0 provided that the codiagonal @xmath382 is a map for all objects @xmath20 .",
    "now the fact that the codiagonal composed with the first injection @xmath383 is the identity tells us that we have a diagram as on the left below @xmath384_{i ' } \\ar@{=}[dl ] \\ar@/^2pc/[ddrr]^{1 } & & &   & & x \\ar[dr]_{i ' } \\ar@{=}[dl ] \\ar@/^2pc/[ddrr]^{i } \\\\ & x \\ar[dr]^{i } \\ar@{=}[dl ] & & e \\ar[dl]_{u } \\ar[dr]_{v } & &   & x \\ar[dr]^{i } \\ar@{=}[dl ] & & e \\ar[dl]_{u } \\ar[dr]_{u } \\\\ x & & x+x & & x & x & & x+x & & x+x } \\ ] ] in which the square is a pullback ; but then the diagram on the right shows that the composite of @xmath385 with the injection @xmath383 is just @xmath386 .",
    "similarly its composite with the other injection @xmath387 is @xmath388 , and so @xmath385 is the identity .",
    "this proves that the codiagonal is indeed a map , and so that @xmath0 has finite coproducts ; we have already assumed that it has finite limits . to see that @xmath0 is lextensive observe that we have equivalences @xmath389    @xmath116 @xmath111 $ ] suppose that @xmath0 is lextensive . then in particular , it is distributive , so that @xmath390 , and we have @xmath391 which shows that @xmath392 is the coproduct in @xmath15 ; but a similar argument shows that it is also the product .",
    "there is a corresponding result involving partial maps in lextensive categories , although the situation there is more complicated as one does not have direct sums but only a weakened relationship between products and coproducts , and a similarly weakened calculus of matrices .",
    "see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section  2 ) .",
    "there is also a nullary version of the theorem .",
    "we simply recall that an initial object in a category @xmath0 is said to be _ strict _ , if any morphism into it is invertible , and then leave the proof to the reader .",
    "once again the equivalence @xmath394 is a special case of @xcite ."
