    "the concept of single - electron quasiparticles is one of the central ideas of solid state physics .",
    "indeed , systems of interacting electrons in metals and semiconductors are well described by landau s fermi - liquid picture in which interaction modifies free electrons making them quasiparticles that in many respects behave like non - interacting electrons .",
    "basic electronic properties of many solids , including phase transitions into symmetry - breaking states like superconducting or charge - density wave ( cdw ) state , are well described within this concept .",
    "therefore , possibility to observe non - fermi liquid behavior in conducting materials attracts much interest .",
    "the concept of luttinger liquid is an alternative to the fermi liquid elaborated for one - dimensional ( 1d ) electronic systems .",
    "it was found that in 1d electronic systems the fermi - liquid picture breaks down even in case of arbitrarily weak interaction .",
    "single - electron quasiparticles can not exist in 1d metals , and electrons form the luttinger liquid in which the only low energy excitations turn out to be charge and spin collective modes with the sound - like spectrum .",
    "dynamical independence of these modes gives rise to a spin - charge separation in 1d systems .",
    "furthermore , correlation functions at large distances and times decay as a power law with interaction dependent exponents ( for a review see ref . ) .",
    "one may expect to observe formation of luttinger liquid in quasi-1d conductors , _",
    "i. e. _ , highly anisotropic 3d conductors with chain - like structure .",
    "however , according to present theoretical point of view , the formation of luttinger liquid in quasi-1d conductors at low enough temperatures is problematic because of the instability towards 3d behavior in the presence of arbitrarily small inter - chain hopping @xcite .",
    "so inter - chain hopping induces a crossover to 3d behavior at low energies , while luttinger liquid behavior can survive only at high enough energy scale where it is not affected by 3d coupling .",
    "in contrast to inter - chain hopping , the coulomb interaction between electrons on different chains does not destroy the luttinger liquid state , it merely modifies the electronic spectrum of the luttinger liquid @xcite .",
    "numerous experimental studies of both organic and inorganic quasi-1d conductors at low temperatures demonstrate , commonly , fermi - liquid metallic behavior and/or transitions to broken - symmetry states , which are described in terms of fermi - liquid ideas ( for a review see refs . ) .",
    "for instance , the most studied inorganic quasi-1d metals ( _ e .",
    "g. _ , blue bronze k@xmath1moo@xmath0 , tas@xmath0 , ( tase@xmath2)@xmath3i _ etc_. ) undergo the peierls transition from metallic to a semiconducting cdw state , or to semimetallic cdw state like nbse@xmath0 . typically , this transitions occur in the temperature range @xmath4 k. some quasi-1d materials , _",
    "e. g. _ , tase@xmath0 do not undergo the peierls transition and remain in the normal metallic state at low temperatures as well .",
    "however , a transition from room - temperature metallic behavior to nonmetallic one accompanied by disappearance of the cdw state at temperatures below @xmath5 k was detected in recent experimental studies of temperature and field dependence of conductivity of tas@xmath0 and nbse@xmath0 nanoscale - sized crystals @xcite .",
    "the low temperature non - metallic state was characterized by power law dependencies of conductivity on voltage and temperature like that expected in luttinger liquid , or by more strong temperature dependence corresponding to the variable - range hopping@xcite .",
    "resembling dependencies of conductivity were reported also in focused - ion beam processed or doped relatively thick nbse@xmath0 crystals @xcite .",
    "transition to non - metallic conductivity at low temperatures was observed earlier in fragmented into small pieces and then sintered nbse@xmath0 crystals @xcite .",
    "hopping conductivity was also found out in heavily doped by iron bulk nbse@xmath0 crystals @xcite in dirty quasi-1d conductors kcp and organic tcnq - based metals @xcite , while pure materials are known to undergo the peierls transition to the cdw state .    in order to account for such behavior a possibility of stabilization of the luttinger state by defects in quasi-1d metals",
    "was put forward recently in the letter of one of the authors @xcite .",
    "such a possibility is based upon finding made in refs . that a local impurity potential in luttinger liquid acts , at low energies , as effectively infinite barrier .",
    "this leads to a discrete spectrum of collective charge and spin density fluctuations , so that the electronic system can be considered as a collection of bounded luttinger liquids . in this case , at temperatures below the minimum excitation energy of the collective modes , weak inter - chain hopping can be considered as small perturbation , and , therefore , hopping does not destroy the luttinger liquid state .",
    "however , in order to make comparison with the experimental data and to find further evidences that the low - temperature non - metallic state observed in quasi-1d conductors can , actually , be interpreted as a collection of impurity - induced bounded luttinger liquids , calculation of conductivity in the latter state is needed .",
    "such calculations are the main goal of this paper .",
    "we calculate conductivity in a collection of weakly coupled metallic chains with defects in the limit of low temperatures , considering both the case of the contact interaction used in the standard tomonaga - luttinger model @xcite and the case of more physical long - ranged coulomb potential .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we present main equations and formulate the problem in terms of bosonization technique generalized to the case of long - range coulomb interaction between electrons in multi - chain problem in presence of impurities . in sec .",
    "iii we study electronic structure of quasi-1d conductors .",
    "we consider , first , interacting electrons neglecting inter - chain hopping and find the solution for the phase operators in the limit of strong impurity potential ignoring , at the first step , the coulomb interaction of electrons at different chains .",
    "modifications induced by the long - range nature of the coulomb interaction are discussed in the next subsection . in the last subsection",
    "we show that at low temperatures the inter - chain hopping can be considered as small perturbation , provided the hopping matrix element is small enough . sec .",
    "iv is devoted to transport properties of the system .",
    "we show that in the limit of low voltages conductivity is described in terms of variable - range hopping , while at large voltages it turns into conductivity described by a power - law dependence on voltage . and , finally , in sec .",
    "v we discuss relation of the theoretical results to experimental data , and make conclusions . in this paper",
    "we use units with planck and boltzmann constants equal to unity , @xmath6 , @xmath7 .",
    "first of all we start with the tomonaga - luttinger model ignoring inter - chain hopping integral , @xmath8 , in order to formulate the problem in the zero approximation in @xmath8 .",
    "electronic operators for right ( @xmath9 ) and left ( @xmath10 ) moving electrons with spin @xmath11 on chain @xmath12 are given in terms of phase fields as ( see ref . ) @xmath13 .",
    "\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] phase fields @xmath14 are related to charge ( @xmath15 ) and spin ( @xmath16 ) densities , while fields @xmath17 are related to the momentum operators @xmath18 canonically conjugate to @xmath19 .",
    "further , @xmath20 are majorana ( `` real '' ) fermionic operators that assure proper anticommutation relations between electronic operators with different spin @xmath11 and chirality @xmath21 , and the cut off length @xmath22 is assumed to be of the order of interatomic distance .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system includes three terms , the hamiltonian of the interacting electrons , the impurity scattering term , and the inter - chain hopping hamiltonian .",
    "the first term containing kinetic and potential energies of the electrons is described by the tomonaga - luttinger hamiltonian generalized for the multi - chain case with long - range interaction that couples electrons on different chains @xcite . this hamiltonian does ignores the backscattering terms in the electronic coupling ,",
    "_ i. e. _ , it neglects components of interaction potential with @xmath23 . in the bozonized form",
    "the hamiltonian reads @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the area per single chain , and integration over @xmath26 is taken within the first brillouin zone @xmath27 @xmath28 is the standard luttinger liquid parameter describing the strength of the interaction .",
    "@xmath28 determines velocities of the charge ( @xmath15 ) and spin ( @xmath16 ) modes , @xmath29 .",
    "we study the case of spin - independent interaction , therefore , in our case , the coupling constant for spin channel is equal to zero , @xmath30 and @xmath31",
    ". for charge channel @xmath32 coincides with the matrix element measuring the strength of the forward scattering due to interaction between electrons on the same or on different branches of the electronic spectrum .",
    "the exact form of @xmath32 depends on crystalline and electronic structure of a crystal , but in the long - wavelength limit , @xmath33 , one can describe interaction by the standard fourier transform of the coulomb interaction potential .",
    "@xmath34 where @xmath35 is the plasma frequency and @xmath36 is the frequency of the charge mode .    in the coordinate representation @xmath37 where the last term is induced by the coulomb interaction .",
    "its contribution to the hamiltonian ( [ h0 ] ) in the coordinate representation reads @xmath38 since the operator of the particle density is given by expression @xmath39 , this term has rather transparent physical meaning .",
    "the second part of the total hamiltonian is @xmath40 impurity backscattering term @xcite @xmath41 where @xmath42 is potential of impurity centered in position @xmath43 . in calculations below",
    "we assume @xmath44 , where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are amplitude and radius of the scattering potential , respectively .",
    "when inter - chain electron hopping is ignored , equation of motion for heisenberg phase operators @xmath47 and @xmath48 can be obtained in standard way from the hamiltonian @xmath49 given by eqs .",
    "( [ h0 ] ) and ( [ himp ] ) : @xmath50    kane and fischer @xcite found that the backscattering impurity potential for repulsive potential ( @xmath51 ) flows to infinity under scaling .",
    "this conclusion was made for the case of single chain and a contact interaction potential .",
    "the results of refs . were generalized by fabrizio and gogolin @xcite to the case of many impurities .",
    "it was shown that the impurity potential can be considered as effectively infinite provided that the mean distance , @xmath52 , between impurities satisfies the condition @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the bandwidth .",
    "we assume that the impurity potential is of atomic scale , @xmath55 , and the interaction between electrons is not too weak , ( _ i .",
    ", @xmath56 is not too close to 1 ) .",
    "then condition ( [ co ] ) is satisfied for @xmath57 , so the limit of strong impurity potential should be a good approximation in a wide range of impurity concentrations .",
    "similar conclusions can be derived for the multiple - chain system when interaction between electrons on different chains is taken into account .",
    "indeed , calculations in ref .",
    "are based upon dominant contribution to euclidian action expressed in terms of the value of the field @xmath47 at the impurity site by means of solution of equation of motion in imaginary time .",
    "one can act , similarly , in case of multiple - chain system .",
    "we express the solution of imaginary - time version of eq .",
    "( [ eqmo2 ] ) for fourier component of @xmath47 in terms of its value at the impurity site , @xmath58 , and find @xmath59 in the spirit of renormalization group approach the last factor in eq .",
    "( [ ph2 ] ) must be calculated in the limit of small energies . since at small @xmath60 this",
    "integral diverges at small @xmath61 , we use @xmath62 at @xmath63 . then we obtain @xmath64 where @xmath65 then using ( [ ph2 ] ) one finds the action @xmath66 this equation is similar to the action in ref . that was used to derive the renormalization equation for the interaction parameter , the only difference being that in case of long - range interaction action ( [ s ] ) contains the averaged value @xmath67 of the interaction parameter instead of parameter @xmath56 itself .",
    "thus impurity potential flows to infinity under scaling if @xmath68 .",
    "so at energies close to the fermi energy the limit of strong impurity potential can be used . in the main approximation",
    "this limit corresponds to boundary conditions at the impurity site @xmath69 where @xmath12 and @xmath70 are integers .",
    "furthermore , @xmath71 must be an even integer in order to ensure the minimum value of the impurity hamiltonian ( [ himp ] ) .",
    "this connection violates independence of spin and charge modes similar to violation of spin - charge separation in bounded luttinger liquid discussed by eggert _",

    "we consider first the case of interacting electrons neglecting inter - chain hopping and find the solution for the phase operators in the limit of strong impurity potential .",
    "according to discussion in the previous section this limit should be a good approximation in a wide range of impurity concentrations . in this approximation",
    "the system breaks up into a set of independent segments . at the beginning",
    "we ignore the long - range coulomb interaction and consider the case of contact interaction as in the standard tomonaga - luttinger model , and then discuss modifications induced by long - range interaction . at the end of the section",
    "we will show that at low temperatures the inter - chain hopping does not produce qualitative modification of the electronic structure based on the concept of luttinger liquid .",
    "we begin with solutions for phase operators in case of contact interaction , taking into account that @xmath73 and @xmath19 must obey the commutation relations @xcite ensuring anticommutation of electronic operators ( [ psi ] ) . using then the analogy of @xmath74 in eq.([h0 ] ) with the hamiltonian of an elastic string strongly pinned at impurity sites , and taking into account commutation relations , we can write down solutions for the phase operators in the region between impurity positions at @xmath75 and @xmath76 as @xmath77 where @xmath78 @xmath79 .    solutions ( [ fi0]-[th0 ] ) consist of two parts .",

    "the first terms present the particular solution with boundary conditions ( [ bco ] ) , they describe zero modes . in the zero modes @xmath81 @xmath82 ( @xmath83 ) is the number of extra electrons with spin up ( down ) in the region between impurities number @xmath43 and @xmath84 , @xmath85 is equal to the modulo @xmath86 residue of @xmath87 , and , finally @xmath88 is the phase canonically conjugate to @xmath89 obeying commutation relations @xmath90=i$ ]",
    ".    note that inside the segments between the impurities the expressions for the phase fields between the impurity sites turn out to be similar to those found for bounded 1d luttinger liquid with open boundary conditions at the sample ends @xcite .",
    "the main difference is that majorana operators @xmath91 in eq.([psi ] ) are the same for electrons moving right and left , and that eq.([fi0 ] ) contain the summation over @xmath92 that insure proper commutation relations between the electron operators related to different segments .",
    "thus we conclude that the system breaks up into a set of independent segments described as bounded luttinger liquids with main properties similar to those discussed in refs . .",
    "in particular , as long as eigenvalues of @xmath82 and @xmath83 are integers we find that @xmath93 and @xmath94 are not independent , because @xmath95 must be an even number .",
    "such a limitation ensures the minimum value of the impurity hamiltonian ( [ himp ] ) .",
    "this also means violation of spin - charge separation due to zero modes as discussed by eggert et al .",
    "@xcite for bounded luttinger liquids .",

    "analytical solution of this problem is difficult .",

    "it is not difficult to calculate corrections to the green s functions due to hopping for small energy @xmath194 , because at such energies fourier - transformed green s functions presented in the appendix acquire a simple form .",

    "note that the probability to find similar values of zero - state energies at neighboring segments is negligible , so the energy difference in the denominator of ( [ t2 ] ) is of the order of typical energy of the zero - level , @xmath125 . so the shift of the energy due to hopping can be estimated as @xmath201    the higher order terms give smaller corrections proportional to higher order powers of factor @xmath202 so corrections are small provided this factor is small .",
    "note that our calculations are based on discrete nature of the electron spectrum near the fermi energy , because we used an assumption that both characteristic energy and the hopping matrix element , @xmath8 , are much smaller than typical energy of zero - mode levels @xmath125 .",
    "the characteristic energy is determined by temperature , t. thus inter - chain hopping does not destroy the luttinger liquid picture in the limit @xmath203 , which does not exist in pure infinite luttinger liquid . in the opposite limit of larger temperatures",

    "then there is the coulomb gap in the density of states at the fermi energy , and hopping of electrons occurs effectively only between the segments situated far from each other , at distances given by condition ( [ r ] ) ) . since distances between impurities , @xmath52 ,",

    "the anisotropy can be estimated as the ratio of the characteristic hopping lengths in directions parallel and perpendicular to the chains .",
    "it was argued above that hopping in the perpendicular direction occurs effectively over distances of the order of inter - chain distance @xmath219 .",
    "the hopping length along the chains can be found as that corresponding to the minimum value of the exponent in eq .",
    "( [ i ] ) .",
    "so for anisotropy of the conductivity we find @xmath222      now we discuss electron transfer at high voltages and make rough estimates of non - linear current - voltage dependences .",
    "let the voltage between @xmath70 segments is equal to @xmath223 . if the voltage drop over the hopping length becomes larger then typical energy of the local levels , @xmath224 , then electron transitions between the quasi - continuum spectrum of excitations in segments become possible without phonon absorption .",
    "this happens at electric field @xmath225 .",
    "current between such segments can be calculated by means of diagrams similar to that presented in fig .",
    "[ fig ] , but without phonon line .",
    "the diagrams contain virtual transitions via intermediate segments that contribute to the expression for current small factors similar to the first factor in eq .",
    "( [ iij ] ) .",
    "further , at large voltages current is roughly proportional to factor @xmath226 because of the power - law energy dependence of the density of states in luttinger liquid ( see discussion below eq .",
    "( [ delta ] ) ) .",
    "@xmath227^{2 m } ( mv)^{2\\delta+1}\\ ] ] consider , first , the case when the voltage is not too large so that electron transitions between the regions of quasi - continuum spectrum of excitations are possible at @xmath228 only .",
    "then index @xmath70 is related to the average electric field along the chains by relation @xmath229 .",
    "so the most rapid , exponential , dependence of current on electric field originates from increase of @xmath70 in the first factor in eq .",
    "( [ i m ] ) , in other word , from switching on new channels for non - linear current flow between more and more closely situated segments .",
    "the second factor in ( [ i m ] ) gives slowly varying function of field @xmath230 of the order of @xmath231 , its field dependence can be neglected in comparison to the exponential growth due to the first factor .",
    "so for this regime we find @xmath232 note that condition @xmath233 means @xmath234 .    for current in direction perpendicular to conducting chains index @xmath70",
    "is related to the average electric field by the relation @xmath235 .",
    "then for this direction the characteristic field can be estimated as @xmath236 .",
    "this is much larger value then @xmath237 which demonstrates strong anisotropy of the non - linear conductivity .    at larger voltages , when @xmath238 , the voltage drop is large enough to induce electron transitions between the neighboring segments . in this case",
    "the i - v curves can be estimated as @xmath239 the power index here is different if tunneling along the chains via impurities is more effective than inter - chain tunneling . in the latter case",
    "the density of states at the ends of a segment is described by different power index , similarly to bounded luttinger liquids @xcite , so index @xmath240 in eq .",
    "( [ im1 ] ) must be substituted for @xmath241 .",
    "now we discuss relation of our theoretical results to real materials and to experimental data .",
    "our calculations are based on the luttinger model which does not take into account backscattering terms , _",
    "i. e. _ , @xmath40 fourier component of the inter - electronic interaction .",
    "these terms are known to lead to two qualitatively different consequences ( for a review see ref . ) . in case of attractive spin - independent interaction it results in the spin gap , while the backscattering terms are irrelevant if the interaction is repulsive .",
    "so , strictly speaking , our results can be applied for the case of coulomb repulsion of the electrons at all wave vectors . on the other hand ,",
    "the effective inter - electronic interaction can be considered as containing both repulsive coulomb interaction and attraction due to electron - phonon coupling .",
    "it can happen that the coulomb repulsion dominates at small values of wave vectors , while attraction induced by electron - phonon coupling dominates at wave vectors close to @xmath40 .",
    "though such picture ignores retardation effects in the electron - phonon coupling it is quite fruitful in description of quasi-1d cdw - conductors @xcite , electron - phonon interaction being described by means of attractive electron - electron coupling constant at @xmath40 wave vector .",
    "note that the mean - field expression for the cdw gap @xcite is similar to the expression for the spin gap obtained within the renormalization group approach with the cut - off length @xmath242 in equation for spin gap estimated as @xmath22 .",
    "therefore , we can conclude that a possible value of spin gap in such materials as nbse@xmath0 and tas@xmath0 can be of the order of few hundreds kelvins . since the spin gap implies long - range order in @xmath243 field and expected values of spin gap are quite large , the fluctuations of this field at low temperatures must be small .",
    "the energy in the spin channel is minimized by @xmath244 , which satisfies boundary conditions ( [ bco ] ) for even values of integer @xmath70 .",
    "so we can expect that in the presence of large spin gap the electron system at low temperatures can be considered as spinless electrons in the luttinger state , the spin degrees of freedom being frozen . in this case the results of the preceding sections are still valid , and only minor rather simplifications than modifications in the course of derivation of results are needed .    thus we conclude that our results can be applied to quasi-1d conductors nbse@xmath0 and tas@xmath0 where transition from metallic to non - metallic behavior was observed . however , detailed quantitative comparison with experimental data is difficult .",
    "the first reason for this is some contradictory data on temperature dependence of ohmic conductivity at low temperatures . in ref .",
    "the temperature dependence corresponding to the variable - range hopping described by the efros - shklovskii law was observed , while in refs . and",
    "a power - law dependence of conductivity on temperature was observed down to liquid helium temperature .",
    "another difficulty for making detailed comparison is that the impurity density in the samples is not known .",
    "however , our results agree with general tendencies observed in these materials .",
    "namely , more impure samples demonstrate transition from metallic to non - metallic behavior at higher temperatures , characteristic temperature in eq .",
    "( [ ies ] ) increasing from few tens kelvins in more perfect samples to few hundreds kelvins in the most dirty samples . in a sample with characteristic temperature @xmath245",
    "k temperature dependence of ohmic conductivity transforms from metallic to non - metallic behavior in the temperature range 100 - 200 k. then we conclude that @xmath246 k , and since @xmath247 , according to our approach we can estimate the mean segment length as @xmath248 cm .",
    "according to eq .",
    "( [ ies ] ) this length corresponds to electric field of the order of @xmath249 v / cm for transition from ohm s law to power law dependence .",
    "this is in order of magnitude agreement with the experimental data of ref . .",
    "but to make convincing conclusions more theoretical and experimental work is needed .",
    "it is important to note that low temperature behavior of both nbse@xmath0 and tas@xmath0 in refs .",
    "is very similar , in spite of the fact that relatively pure samples of these materials behave quite differently : nbse@xmath0 remains metallic in the cdw state , while tas@xmath0 below the peierls transition becomes an insulator with quasiparticle density obeying the arrhenius law .",
    "whereas the main properties of quasi-1d conductors at higher temperatures are well understood @xcite , they demonstrate many intriguing properties at low temperatures which are still not explained convincingly . in particular , in tas@xmath0 at temperatures below 20 k",
    "a behavior typical for hopping conductivity was observed @xcite instead of arrhenius law , and anomalous behavior of the dielectric function interpreted as a new glassy phase @xcite was detected at frequencies @xmath250 hz .",
    "one can speculate that this unusual behavior can be related to the formation of the luttinger phase at very low temperatures because characteristic energy @xmath247 is small due to small impurity density @xmath251 .",
