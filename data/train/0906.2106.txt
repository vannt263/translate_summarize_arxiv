    "this formula expresses elements of `` decontracted '' algebra in terms of elements of the contracted one . since , by a rule , various properties of the contracted algebra are much easier to explore ( e.g. construction of representations @xcite , decompositions of a direct product of representations @xcite , etc . ) , this formula found its place , as a useful and simple tool , even in some textbooks @xcite and in the mathematical encyclopedia @xcite .",
    "there is a myriad of inn - wigner lie algebra contraction applications arising in various parts of theoretical physics .",
    "just to mention a few ranging from contractions from the poincar algebra to the galilean one , and from the heisenberg algebras to the abelian ones of the same dimensions ( a symmetry background of a transition processes from relativistic and quantum mechanics to classical mechanics ) to those of contractions from ( anti-)desitter to the poincar algebra , and various cases involving virasoro and kac - moody algebras .",
    "a recent study of an affine gauge gravity theory in @xmath7 @xcite is heavily related to the @xmath3 algebra contraction w.r.t .",
    "its @xmath8 subalgebra , and the representations of the relevant algebras .",
    "the main drawback of the gell - mann formula is its limited validity .",
    "there is a number of references dealing with the question when this formula is applicable @xcite .",
    "the formula is best studied in the case of ( pseudo ) orthogonal algebras",
    "@xmath9 contracted w.r.t .",
    "their @xmath10 and/or @xmath11 subalgebras , i.e.  on the group level for @xmath12 or @xmath13 , where , loosely speaking , the gell - mann formula works very well @xcite .",
    "moreover , the case of ( pseudo ) orthogonal algebras is the only one where this formula is valid for ( almost ) all representations @xcite .",
    "there were some attempts to generalize the gell - mann formula @xcite , that resulted in a construction of relatively complicated polynomial formulas for the `` decontracted '' algebra operators , applicable to complex simple lie algebras @xmath14 with respect to decomposition @xmath15 .",
    "in this work we are generally interested in gell - mann s formula for the @xmath16 algebras , that are contracted w.r.t",
    ". their maximal compact @xmath2 subalgebras .",
    "note that , due to mutual relations of the @xmath16 and @xmath1 algebras , one can convey the results obtained for the @xmath16 algebras to the corresponding ones of the @xmath1 algebras .",
    "there are some subtleties in that process that will be considered below .",
    "the gell - mann formula is , in this case , especially valuable for the problem of finding all unitary irreducible representations of the @xmath16 algebras in the basis of the @xmath17 and/or @xmath18 groups generated by their @xmath2 subalgebras .",
    "finding representations in the basis of the maximal compact subgroup @xmath17 of the @xmath19 group , is mathematically superior , and it suites well various physical applications in particular in nuclear physics , gravity , physics of p - branes @xcite etc .",
    "moreover , this framework opens up a possibility of finding , in a rather straightforward manner , all matrix elements of noncompact @xmath19 generators for all representations .",
    "unfortunately , the original gell - mann formula is , in that respect , limited to some classes of ( multiplicity free ) representations only .    as already stated , the gell - mann formula , except in the cases of ( pseudo ) orthogonal algebras , is not generally valid by itself , and its validity depends on the representations of the algebra as well",
    ". therefore , in the case of the @xmath19 groups , i.e.  their @xmath16 algebras , one is faced , in addition to the pure algebraic features , with a problem of studying the matters that are relevant to characterize representations as well : ( i ) the group topology properties , and ( ii ) the non trivial multiplicity of the @xmath19 , and @xmath16 representations in the @xmath17 , and @xmath2 basis , respectively .",
    "both features are rather subtle for @xmath20 .",
    "note that , in the case of the @xmath16 algebras , due to a fact that the generalization of the gell - mann formula obtained below depends on the algebra representation features , we deviate from the standard lie algebra deformation approach .",
    "the @xmath19 group can be decomposed , as any semisimple lie group , into the product of its maximal compact subgroup @xmath21 , an abelian group @xmath22 and a nilpotent group @xmath23 .",

    "one finds the tensorial @xmath17 representations only .",
    "an inspection of the unitary irreducible representations of the @xmath31 , @xmath46 groups @xcite shows that they have , as a rule , a nontrivial multiplicity of the @xmath18 , @xmath47 subgroup representations .",
    "it is well known , already from the case of the @xmath48 representations in the @xmath49 subgroup basis , that the additional labels required to describe this nontrivial multiplicity can not be solely related to the group generators themselves .",
    "an elegant solution , that provides the required additional labels , is to work in the group manifold of the @xmath17 maximal compact subgroup , and to consider an action of the group both to the right and to the left . in this way one obtains , besides the maximal compact subgroup labels , an additional set of labels to describe the @xmath17 subgroup multiplicity .",
    "all unitary irreducible representations of the @xmath50 and @xmath51 groups are classified , and various relevant explicit expressions are known @xcite .",
    "it turns out that an answer to the question of the gell - mann formula generalization can be effectively read out from these known closed form expressions of representations of noncompact generators in both @xmath52 and @xmath53 cases .",
    "such a generalization then , as a rule , has an overall validity for all representations .",
    "we study the known representations of the noncompact @xmath54 and @xmath55 generators in the maximal compact subgroup basis , and infer the sought for expressions for the corresponding gell - mann formula . on the basis of these results",
    ", we turn to the case of the @xmath56 generators , whose unitary irreducible representations are not known completely . as a result , we obtain a single closed expression that generalizes the gell - mann formula for the @xmath3 algebra w.r.t . its maximal compact @xmath57 subalgebra .",
    "the @xmath16 algebra operators , i.e.  the @xmath19 group generators , can be split into two subsets : @xmath59 , @xmath60 operators of the maximal compact subalgebra @xmath2 ( corresponding to the antisymmetric real @xmath61 matrices , @xmath62 ) , and the , so called , sheer operators @xmath63 , @xmath64 ( corresponding to the symmetric traceless real @xmath61 matrices , @xmath65 ) . the @xmath16 commutation relations , in this basis , read : & = & i(_acm_bd + _ adm_cb - _ bcm_ad - _ bdm_ca ) , + [ m_ab , t_cd ] & = & i(_act_bd + _ adt_cb - _ bct_ad - _ bdt_ca ) , [ mtcommutator ] + [ t_ab , t_cd ] & = & i(_acm_db + _ adm_cb + _ bcm_da + _ bdm_ca ) .

    "the inn - wigner contraction of @xmath0 with respect to its maximal compact subalgebra @xmath2 is given by the limiting procedure : u_ab _ 0 ( t_ab ) , [ limit ] which leads to the following commutation relations : & = & i(_acm_bd + _ adm_cb - _ bcm_ad - _ bdm_ca ) + [ m_ab , u_cd ] & = & i(_acu_bd + _ adu_cb - _ bcu_ad - _ bdu_ca ) [ mucommutator ] + [ u_ab , u_cd ] & = & 0 .",
    "therefore , the inn - wigner contraction of @xmath0 gives a semidirect sum @xmath68 algebra , where @xmath69 is an abelian subalgebra ( ideal ) of `` translations '' in @xmath70 dimensions .",
    "the gell - mann formula , which is a prescription to provide an `` inverse '' to the contraction , ( [ limit ] ) , in this case reads : t_ab = u_ab + [ c_2(so(n ) ) , u_ab ] , [ gell - mann_original]where @xmath71 denotes the second order casimir operator of the @xmath2 algebra , @xmath72 , while @xmath73 is an arbitrary ( complex ) parameter and @xmath74 is a ( real ) normalization constant that depends on @xmath45 .    in order to make use of the gell - mann formula to obtain @xmath16 representations ,",
    "the first necessary step is to construct representations of the contracted algebra",
    ". representations of the @xmath2 generators @xmath59 are well known .",
    "there are two properties that characterize representations of the @xmath75 operators : ( i ) the @xmath75 operators transform w.r.t the @xmath76 dimensional representation of @xmath2 ( [ mucommutator ] ) , i.e.  as a symmetric second order @xmath2 tensors ( in young diagram notation @xmath77 ) , and ( ii ) @xmath75 mutually commute .",
    "these two requirements are met by expressing the @xmath75 operators in terms of the , so called , wigner @xmath78-function ( the @xmath17 group matrix elements expressed as functions of the group parameters ) : u_ab ~d^()_(cd)(ab)(g^-1 ( ) ) , [ uisd]@xmath79 being an @xmath17 element parameterized by @xmath80 , pairs of indices @xmath81 and @xmath82 label the @xmath17 matrix elements , while @xmath83 form a basis of the @xmath77 representation space . taking inverse of @xmath14 in ( [ uisd ] ) insures the correct transformation properties .",
    "the contracted @xmath68 and @xmath16 algebras are represented in a space of square integrable functions over the @xmath18 group ( in accord with the @xmath19 topological properties ) , with a standard invariant haar measure : @xmath84 .",
    "harish - chandra proved @xcite that this space is rich enough to contain all possible representations ( up to equivalence ) of the @xmath31 group , i.e.  @xmath16 algebra .",
    "the @xmath75 operators act multiplicatively on this space , while the @xmath2 subalgebra operators act , in a standard way , via a left group action : @xmath85 this representation space is highly reducible , however this fact is of no relevance for the present considerations .    the @xmath75 expressions ( [ uisd ] ) fulfill , straightforwardly , both required properties : commute mutually , as being ordinary functions of @xmath80 , and transform under @xmath77 when acting to the right on a ket vector @xmath86 ( characterized accordingly by the @xmath81 indices )",
    ". however , the bra vector @xmath87 , standing to the left of @xmath88 , can be an arbitrary vector from the @xmath77 representation , thus providing an additional set of labels of the @xmath75 , and accordingly the @xmath63 , operators .",
    "it turns out , as it will be seen below , that these additional labels play an important role in the @xmath16 unitary irreducible representations description , in particular in characterizing nontrivial @xmath18 subgroup multiplicity .",
