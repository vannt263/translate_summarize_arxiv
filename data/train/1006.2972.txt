    "the lattice simulation of quantum chromodynamic equation of state ( eos ) predicts that the properties of nuclear matter at extreme densities and/or temperatures are governed by the partonic degrees of freedom  @xcite .",
    "a series of experiments have been performed  @xcite and planned  @xcite to produce such a partonic state of matter , called quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) by colliding nuclei at ultra - relativistic energies .",
    "rigorous experimental and theoretical efforts are on to create and detect such a novel state of matter  @xcite .",
    "various signals have been proposed for the detection of qgp - the pros and cons of these signals are matter of intense debate .",

    "we employ a microscopic model for the productions and evolution of strange quarks and hadrons depending on the collision energy . here",
    "we examine whether the @xmath1 experimental data can differentiate between the following two initial conditions or two scenarios - after the collisions the system is formed in : ( i ) the hadronic phase for all @xmath0 or ( ii ) the partonic phase beyond a certain threshold in @xmath0 . other possibilities like formation of strangeness in complete thermal equilibrium and evolution in space time ( iii ) without and",

    "i.e. _ the assumption of an initial state where non - strange sectors are in equilibrium but the strange degrees of freedom are out of equilibrium ( having density much below their equilibrium values ) were considered in the 1980 s .",
    "the strangeness production in a deconfined ( partonic ) phase is enhanced compared to the their production in the confined ( hadronic ) phase primarily because even the lightest strange hadrons , the kaons are much heavier than the strange quarks .",
    "moreover , the strange quark has more degrees of freedom ( six ) in a deconfined matter compared to kaons .",
    "therefore , the strangeness production during the space time evolution of the system for partonic initial state will be enhanced compared to the hadronic initial state , hence the enhanced production of strangeness could be an efficient signal for deconfinement  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to these studies gazdzicki and gorenstein  @xcite within the ambit of statistical model considered the strangeness production where both the strange and non - strange degrees of freedom are in thermal equilibrium and the production of strangeness during the expansion stage is ignored . in the present work we would like to compare the results on kaon to pion ratio from these two contrasting scenarios .",
    "we assume that the non - strange quarks and hadrons are in complete thermal ( both kinetic and chemical ) equilibrium and the strange quarks and strange hadrons are away from chemical equilibrium .",
    "therefore , the evolution of the strange sector of the system is governed by the interactions between the equilibrium and non - equilibrium degrees of freedom .",
    "the momentum integrated boltzmann equation provides a possible framework for such studies .",
    "similar approach has been used to study the sequential freeze - out of elementary particles in the early universe  @xcite .    for the strangeness productions in the partonic phase we consider the processes of gluon fusion and light quarks annihilation .",

    "<S> a microscopic approach has been employed to study the kaon productions in heavy ion collisions . </S>",
    "<S> the momentum integrated boltzmann equation has been used to study the evolution of strangeness in the system formed in heavy ion collision at relativistic energies . </S>",
    "<S> the kaon productions have been calculated for different centre of mass energies ( @xmath0 ) ranging from ags to rhic . </S>",
    "<S> the results have been compared with available experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain a non - monotonic horn like structure for @xmath1 when plotted with @xmath0 with the assumption of an initial partonic phase beyond a certain threshold in @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> however , a monotonic rise of @xmath1 is observed when a hadronic initial state is assumed for all @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> experimental values of @xmath3 are also reproduced within the ambit of the same formalism . </S>",
    "<S> results from scenarios where the strange quarks and hadrons are formed in equilibrium and evolves with and without secondary productions have also been presented .    . </S>"
