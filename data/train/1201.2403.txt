    "for several decades , direct reactions have been crucial tools for the investigation of the single - particle structures that underlie the complex many - body problem of the atomic nucleus . at sufficiently high collision energies",
    "one or two nucleons can be removed from the projectile or transferred between the target and projectile nuclei in their fast , surface - grazing collisions .",
    "classic examples of such _ spectroscopic _ direct reactions are light - ion - induced one- and two - nucleon transfer reactions on thin , stable targets at incident energies of several mev per nucleon .",
    "examples are the ( d , p ) , ( p , d ) , ( p , t ) and ( t , p ) reactions . here , it is the detection of the light charged particles in the exit channel that allows the determination of final - state energies , cross sections and their angular distributions , having sensitivity to the location , spectroscopic strengths and the transferred orbital angular momenta of the active one- and two - nucleon configurations ( overlaps ) , respectively .    with the advent of rare - isotope beam facilities ,",
    "short - lived neutron - rich or neutron - deficient nuclear species have become available for nuclear structure studies .",
    "many of the most exotic nuclei can be produced efficiently by projectile fragmentation and are available for experiments as fast heavy - ion beams with @xmath5 . in this regime , of very exotic nuclei with modest beam intensities of @xmath6 particles / second , luminosities comparable to stable - beam experiments can be restored by employing thick reaction targets and using in - beam @xmath0-ray spectroscopy to tag the final states of the projectile - like reaction residues @xcite . over the past decade",
    ", @xmath0-ray tagged , thick target - induced one- and two - nucleon knockout reactions in inverse kinematics , such as ( , @xmath7)x and ( , @xmath8)x , have been developed as spectroscopic reaction tools . in the low intensity ,",
    "fast secondary beam regime these reaction mechanisms can probe in some detail the single - particle content of the nuclear many - body wave function at and near the fermi surface(s ) @xcite .    in these reactions ,",
    "one - nucleon removal selectively populates hole - like configurations with respect to the projectile ground state .",
    "similar to transfer reactions , they probe the location of such single - hole states , their spectroscopic strengths and orbital angular momenta .",
    "sudden two - proton ( neutron ) removal reactions from neutron ( proton)-rich nuclei also proceed as direct reactions .",
    "they probe , specifically , the parentage and phase of the participating two - nucleon configurations near the well - bound fermi surface of the ground state of the projectile , built upon the final states of the projectile - like reaction residues  @xcite .",
    "details of this nuclear structure model information is carried by the two - nucleon amplitudes ( overlaps ) , see e.g. @xcite .    to complement this arsenal of fast - beam , inverse kinematics nucleon removal reactions , one - nucleon pickup reactions onto fast projectile beams from thick carbon and beryllium targets",
    "have recently been studied as a spectroscopic probe sensitive to _ particle_-like states / configurations @xcite .",
    "the choice of reaction target is now motivated by generic linear and angular momentum matching considerations and that , at high collision energies , the pickup of well - bound target nucleons is favored @xcite . in common with the thick - target nucleon removal experiments ,",
    "the energy resolution of the populated final - states relies on @xmath0-ray spectroscopy performed in coincidence with the detection of the heavy projectile - like pickup reaction residues .",
    "however , unlike in removal reactions , and rooted in the two - body nature of the reaction mechanism , the longitudinal momentum distribution of the projectile - like reaction residues carries no useful information on the orbital angular momentum of the transferred nucleon .",
    "rather , it can be used to estimate whether there are significant non - two - body final - state contributions to the measured reaction yields  @xcite .",
    "so far , thick and targets were employed and compared @xcite for the fast one - neutron pickup studies .",
    "only targets have been used to date for measured one - proton pickup cases @xcite .",
    "the goals of the present work are two - fold .",
    "we investigate : +",
    "( i ) the use of a target to induce the fast - beam one - proton pickup reaction of type @xmath9 , including the measurement and theoretical description of partial cross sections , and + ( ii ) extension of the study of this spectroscopic tool into @xmath1-shell systems .    an important aspect of the use of pickup onto fast projectile beams is the anticipated selectivity of this transfer process to high-@xmath4 orbitals , or fragments thereof , in the projectile residues , promising this technique as suited for identifying intruder states that are direct indicators of shell evolution .",
    "this makes projectiles with vacancies in the proton @xmath10 and @xmath11 orbits a logical choice to advance such one - proton pickup developments , to highlight and contrast the pickup yields into these @xmath4=3 and @xmath4=1 single - proton configurations .",
    "for the present study we use a cocktail beam of projectiles containing the @xmath12=24 isotones and .",
    "we will focus on the ( , + @xmath0)x and ( , + @xmath0)x reactions at mid - target energies of 56.7 and 61.2 mev / nucleon , respectively . to allow comparison with the earlier work ( that used targets ) the ( , + @xmath0)x and ( , + @xmath0)x reactions , at mid - target energies of 50.7 and 54.8 mev / nucleon , respectively , were also measured with the same experimental setup .",
    "the projectile beam containing and was produced by fragmentation of a 160-mev per nucleon primary beam provided by the coupled cyclotron facility at the national superconducting cyclotron laboratory ( nscl ) at michigan state university .",
    "the 893  mg/@xmath13 thick production target was located at the mid - acceptance target position of nscl s a1900 fragment separator  @xcite .",
    "an achromatic al wedge of 300-mg/@xmath13 thickness together with slit systems were used to optimize the beam purity on .",
    "the resulting cocktail beam of @xmath14 isotones was transmitted to the reaction target position of the s800 spectrograph at typical rates of 2500 , 2000 , and 500 particles per second and purities of 39% , 40% , and 11% , respectively , for , , and at @xmath15% total a1900 momentum acceptance .",
    "reaction targets of 72.8(13)-mg/@xmath13 thick and 188(4)-mg/@xmath13 thick were used at the target position of the s800 spectrograph  @xcite for the different settings .",
    "the high - resolution @xmath0-ray detection system sega  @xcite , an array of 32-fold segmented high - purity germanium detectors , was used to detect the de - excitation @xmath0 rays emitted by the reaction residues .",
    "sixteen of the sega detectors were arranged in two rings with relative angles of 90@xmath16 ( 9 detectors ) and 37@xmath16 ( 7 detectors ) with respect to the beam axis .",
    "the high degree of segmentation allows for event - by - event doppler reconstruction of the @xmath0 rays emitted by the projectile - like reaction residues in flight .",
    "the angle of the @xmath0-ray emission that enters the doppler reconstruction is deduced from the position of the segment that registered the largest @xmath0-ray energy deposition .",
    "the photopeak efficiency of the detector array was calibrated with standard sources and corrected for the lorentz boost of the @xmath0-ray distribution emitted by the projectile - like reaction residues in flight at @xmath17 .",
    "7.2 cm    reaction residues were identified event - by - event with the focal - plane detection system  @xcite of the s800 spectrograph . the energy loss measured in the s800 ionization chamber and flight times , corrected for the angle and momentum of each nucleus ,",
    "were used to identify the projectile - like reaction residues exiting the target .",
    "the incoming projectiles were identified from their difference in flight time measured with two plastic scintillators upstream of the target . the particle - identification spectrum for produced in +",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pid ] .",
    "the projectile beams passing through the target are close in magnetic rigidity to the respective one - proton pickup residues and the beam blocker located at the entrance of the s800 focal plane had to be used to block a large fraction of the unreacted projectiles .",
    "still , the most intense contribution in the identification spectrum in fig .",
    "[ fig : pid ] is from unreacted .    for each target and projectile beam , the inclusive cross sections for the one - proton pickup reaction to all projectile + proton bound final states were deduced from the yield of detected pickup residues divided by the number of incoming projectiles relative to the number density of the and reaction targets , respectively .",
    "the deduced inclusive cross sections are @xmath18  mb and @xmath19  mb for the -induced pickups and @xmath20  mb and @xmath21  mb for the -induced pickups .",
    "the quoted uncertainties combine statistical and systematic errors , including the stability of the secondary beam composition , the choice of the software gates , and corrections for the acceptance losses in the tails of the residue parallel momentum distributions .",
    "event - by - event in - beam @xmath0-ray spectroscopy in coincidence with detection of the projectile - like pickup residue allowed the identification of excited final states and measurement of their population in the pickup to .",
    "no bound excited states were observed for , for which a proton separation energy of only @xmath22  kev is predicted from systematics  @xcite .",
    "partial cross sections to individual final states were obtained from the efficiency - corrected full - energy peak areas in the doppler reconstructed @xmath0-ray spectra relative to the number of pickup products , and were corrected for feeding .",
    "unfortunately , the statistics were not sufficient to tag the final state of the and target residues in the laboratory - frame @xmath0-ray spectra ( see  @xcite for a higher statistics @xmath23-shell case for which it was possible to tag the target residues left in the first excited state ) .",
    "the one - proton transfers , from and , are assumed to take place in a single step from the ground states of these targets to bound proton single - particle states built on the ground states of the projectiles .",
    "so , as was used in earlier work , the one - proton pickup single - particle cross sections are calculated using the post - form of the distorted waves born approximation ( dwba ) to the pickup reaction transition amplitude .",
    "the transfer interaction ( that binds the transferred proton and the target residues and ) is treated in finite - range .",
    "the calculations assume that both the entrance and exit channels are two - body and hence that the proton is transferred to bound states in the projectile - like residue and the target - like residues remain bound .",
    "all calculations were performed using the direct reactions code fresco @xcite .",
    "the single - particle cross sections ( computed for a proton + projectile spectroscopic factor of one ) and the shell - model spectroscopic factors enter the calculation of the theoretical ( angle integrated ) pickup cross sections that are compared to the experimental results . for each final state ,",
    "@xmath24 , of the projectile - like residue the theoretical cross section is @xmath25 the first factor , that depends on the projectile mass @xmath26 and the principal harmonic oscillator quantum number , @xmath27 , of the transferred proton orbit , is a small ( near unity ) center - of - mass correction to the shell - model spectroscopic factors , @xmath28 .",
    "@xmath27=3 for the present proton @xmath1-shell cases .",
    "the measured cross sections and the calculated ( single - particle ) cross sections @xmath29 to specific final states in and are both inclusive with respect to the final states of the target residues .",
    "the calculations thus include contributions from transitions involving several and final states .",
    "these will be detailed in the following subsections for the and target cases .",
    "the spectroscopic amplitudes of the proton + projectile bound state overlaps , @xmath30 $ ] and @xmath31 $ ] , were taken from @xmath1-shell - model calculations using the gxpf1a effective interaction  @xcite .",
    "the associated proton + projectile bound state wave functions ( radial overlaps ) were calculated in real woods - saxon potential wells with diffuseness parameter @xmath32 fm and spin - orbit interaction strength of 6 mev .",
    "the reduced radius parameters , @xmath33 , of these potentials were adjusted to reproduce the root mean squared ( rms ) radii of each proton single - particle orbital given by spherical hartree fock calculations , as has been discussed in detail elsewhere @xcite .",
    "these same hartree - fock ( hf ) calculations were used to calculate the projectile and projectile - residue densities , for calculation of the channel distorting potentials , as will be discussed below .",
    "the @xmath33 values were 1.24 and 1.25 fm for the @xmath10 and @xmath34-shell proton orbitals in , respectively , and 1.23 fm for the @xmath10 proton orbital in .",
    "the proton is assumed to be transferred in a single step from a bound state in the ( g.s . ) into a proton + projectile bound state .",
    "the target residue is assumed to be left in one of three bound states , the @xmath35 ground state , the @xmath36 excited state at 2525  kev , and the @xmath37 excited state at 5020  kev .",
    "the shell - model spectroscopic factors ( wbp effective interaction @xcite ) for these three states essentially exhaust the expected spectroscopic strength , of 4 , being @xmath38 , 0.58 , and 0.19 , respectively . the residual strength , of 0.07 , is distributed over many states up to the proton separation energy of and is neglected .",
    "woods - saxon potentials are used to generate these proton + @xmath39 bound states , their geometry taken from ref .",
    "these have reduced radius parameter @xmath40 fm and diffuseness @xmath41 fm .",
    "the nuclear distorting interactions in the + projectile ( entrance ) and + pickup residue ( exit ) channels were calculated .",
    "we adopted the method used in earlier fast nucleon removal reaction studies @xcite , i.e. by double folding the point neutron and proton densities of the projectiles and residues , , and , , and of , with an effective nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath42 ) interaction  @xcite .",
    "for the projectile - like systems the densities were obtained from spherical skyrme ( skx interaction ) hartree - fock ( hf ) calculations @xcite .",
    "the target - like systems , and , were assumed to have gaussian density distributions with rms radii of 2.32 fm and 2.11 fm .",
    "the proton pickup reactions to were thus computed as @xmath43 leading to the @xmath44 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 , final states . the first excited @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 final states of were considered .",
    "pickup to the @xmath48 ground state of is negligible due to the very small shell - model spectroscopic factor , @xmath49 .",
    "for the ( as yet unobserved ) @xmath46 and @xmath47 excited states we used the level energies of the corresponding states in the mirror system .",
    "the energy of the @xmath50 state is known to be 262  kev .",
    "table   [ tab : xsec_c_49 ] summarizes the inputs to the reaction calculations .",
    "there , @xmath51 is the effective proton separation energy from the projectile - like residue , @xmath52 that from the target .",
    "the single - particle proton pickup cross section to each final state of is then the sum of the cross sections to the three final states . as expected ,",
    "based on the wbp shell - model spectroscopic factors shown above , the ground state transition dominates in these individual single - particle cross sections , @xmath53 .",
    "it is already clear from table  [ tab : xsec_c_49 ] that our high projectile beam energy strongly favors @xmath54 pickup , to the @xmath10 proton state of , over @xmath55 pickup to the other final states .",
    "this is understood intuitively by generic , semi - classical linear and angular momentum ( mis)matching arguments , e.g. @xcite .",
    ".inputs used in the reaction model calculations for ( , ) ( @xmath56 ) . shown are the final - state angular momenta and parities , @xmath24 , their excitation energies , @xmath57 , proton configurations , @xmath58 , and effective proton separation energies , @xmath59 .",
    "the final - state spins and parities , @xmath56 , effective proton separation energies , @xmath60 , and the single - particle cross sections , @xmath53 , for each transition are also shown . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     figure  [ fig : fe_co ] compares the measured and calculated inclusive cross sections for the @xmath61 ground state of .",
    "measurement and the reaction model predictions agree within the experimental uncertainty for the -induced reaction while for the -induced pickup the measurement is about 24% lower than the prediction .",
    "7.2 cm      in earlier work it has been pointed out that the longitudinal momentum distributions of the projectile - like one - nucleon pickup residues can be exploited as an indicator of contributions to the pickup reaction mechanism that result in non - two - body final states @xcite .",
    "this diagnostic value arises since , for a strict two - body collision , the reaction - induced momentum distribution of the residues arising from kinematics and angular deflections of the reaction products is essentially @xmath62-function - like compared to ( a ) the momentum spread of the incoming beam of @xmath15% and ( b ) the differential momentum loss of the projectile and heavy residue in the thick target .",
    "the latter depends quite sensitively on the interaction point in the reaction target .",
    "thus , deviations of the measured reaction residue momentum distributions from the momentum profile of the projectile beam having passed through the target and folded with the differential momentum loss of the mass ( @xmath26 + 1)-residue  a rectangular function with a width that takes into account the difference in momentum of the heavy residue depending on the pickup occurring at the front or the back of the thick target  will indicate non - two - body contributions .",
    "this was demonstrated most clearly in ref .",
    "@xcite , for one - neutron pickup reactions from a target , populating excited , unbound @xmath63 target residues .",
    "figure  [ fig : mnco_momentum ] shows the measured longitudinal momentum distributions of the and pickup reaction residues produced on the target . overlayed on the figure",
    "are also ( i ) the momentum profiles of the unreacted and projectiles having passed through the target , and ( ii ) the result after folding these profiles with the rectangle function that takes into account the additional broadening of the distribution originating from the unknown reaction point in the ( thick ) reaction target .",
    "8.6 cm    as can be seen , after folding the projectile momentum profiles with the differential momentum loss experienced by the residues in the target , the predicted parallel momentum distributions describe the measured distributions very well .",
    "small deviations are visible on the low - momentum side of the momentum distribution where a tail structure develops .",
    "this is in line with earlier one - proton pickup reaction work on a target @xcite and one - neutron pickup reaction work on @xcite , where the momentum distributions show very little deviation from the strict two - body reaction mechanism expectation .",
    "in summary , we have employed intermediate - energy one - proton pickup reactions on and targets to study nuclei in the @xmath1-shell . our experimental approach combined thick reaction targets , for luminosity , and @xmath0-ray spectroscopy to tag the final states in the reaction residues .",
    "reaction model calculations assuming one - step transfers and two - body channels were performed .",
    "proton pickups from to and from to were studied , each on both light targets .",
    "no bound excited final states were observed in .",
    "the measured and calculated cross sections confirm that the ground state is almost certainly a @xmath64 state .",
    "the measured cross sections were found to agree well with the two - body reaction model calculations carried out in the distorted waves born approximation .",
    "momentum - matching considerations , embedded in the reaction model dynamics , predict a distinctive pattern of final states population in the heavy residues , with a two - order of magnitude dominance of pickup into the @xmath54 , @xmath10 proton orbital compared to pickup into the @xmath55 , @xmath65 orbitals .",
    "the and longitudinal momentum distributions were also used to demonstrate that pickup events leading to non - two - body final states could make only very small contributions to the measured reaction cross sections .",
    "the present study complements previous work , on the -induced one - proton pickup process and the -induced one - neutron pickup reaction , and extends these studies into the @xmath1-shell .",
    "the unique selectivity of the reaction mechanism for the population of high-@xmath4 over low-@xmath4 orbitals was clearly shown , reinforcing expectations of the potential of this reaction as a spectroscopic tool for the identification of high-@xmath4 intruder states that often indicate the breakdown of shell closures in nuclei far from stability .",

    "<S> * background : * thick - target - induced nucleon - adding transfer reactions onto energetic rare - isotope beams are an emerging spectroscopic tool . </S>",
    "<S> their sensitivity to single - particle structure complements one - nucleon removal reaction capabilities in the quest to reveal the evolution of nuclear shell structure in very exotic nuclei . * </S>",
    "<S> purpose : * to add intermediate - energy , carbon - target - induced one - proton pickup reactions to the arsenal of @xmath0-ray tagged direct reactions applicable in the regime of low beam intensities and to apply these for the first time to @xmath1-shell nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> * methods : * inclusive and partial cross sections were measured for the @xmath2x and @xmath3x proton pickup reactions at 56.7 and 61.2  mev / nucleon , respectively , using coincident particle-@xmath0 spectroscopy at the nscl . </S>",
    "<S> the results are compared to reaction theory calculations using @xmath1-shell - model nuclear structure input . </S>",
    "<S> for comparison with our previous work , the same reactions were measured on targets . </S>",
    "<S> * results : * the measured partial cross sections confirm the specific population pattern predicted by theory , with pickup into high-@xmath4 orbitals being strongly favored ; driven by linear and angular momentum matching . * </S>",
    "<S> conclusion : * carbon target - induced pickup reactions are well - suited , in the regime of modest beam intensity , to study the evolution of nuclear structure , with specific sensitivities that are well described by theory . </S>"
