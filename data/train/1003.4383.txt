    "the resulting expansion of the two - body force is just that of the effective - range expansion @xcite , but the eft framework makes it possible to extend this consistently to other effective operators and three - body forces .    this theory has been applied extensively to two - body systems , where it has been extended to include the effects of the coulomb interaction on proton - proton scattering @xcite . in that system",

    "three - body systems have also been studied in the pionless eft @xcite . in these , exchange of one particle between an interacting pair and",
    "the third particle leads to a long - range force that can be either attractive or repulsive depending on the overall symmetry of the wave function .",
    "attractive channels , such as the triton , display the efimov effect @xcite in the limit of infinite two - body scattering length .",
    "this consists of an infinite tower of bound states with energies in a constant ratio .",
    "it results from a discrete scale invariance in these systems and corresponds to a limit cycle of the renormalisation group ( rg ) for the contact three - body force @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0he nucleus is of particular interest since it can potentially provide access to properties of the neutron that require a polarised target . it should be possible to describe its low - energy properties within the pionless eft , extended to include the coulomb interaction .",
    "however the only previous application of the theory to the @xmath4 system is in the work of rupak and kong , who treated coulomb effects perturbatively and only considered the spin-3/2 channel @xcite .",
    "a nonperturbative treatment may not be essential for the @xmath0he ground state , given the typical momenta in the wave function",
    ". however it will be necessary if the eft is to be extended to describe @xmath4 scattering near threshold .",
    "also , it is needed to answer the question of whether the efimov effect survives in the presence of the coulomb interaction .",
    "arguments based on the degrees of the singularities in the potentials suggest it should and this has been checked by hammer and higa for a simpler two - body model @xcite .",
    "however it has not previously been confirmed in a three - body system .",
    "like most other eft studies of the triton and other three - body systems @xcite , our treatment is formulated in terms of a set of integral equations .",
    "however a quite different approach , based on the resonating - group method , was recently applied to three- and four - nucleon systems by kirscher _",
    "et al . _",
    "while this also treats the coulomb interaction to all orders , limitations on the range of cutoffs mean that it is not able to test whether the efimov effect occurs .",

    "our approach is based on that used by kok _",
    "@xcite to study @xmath0he with separable potentials and the full off - shell coulomb @xmath1-matrix .",
    "the resulting set of integral equations is very similar to that developed by skornyakov and ter - martirosian@xcite which have more recently been used in eft studies of the triton and other three - body systems @xcite .",
    "our results show that the efimov effect does indeed occur in the presence of the coulomb interaction .",
    "we also determine the strength of the three - body force needed to reproduce observed @xmath0he binding energy .",
    "the difference between this and the corresponding force needed for the triton is of the expected size for an electromagnetic effect .",
    "in the pionless eft , the strong forces between nucleons are described by two- and three - body contact interactions . in the present context",
    "it is convenient to represent the two - body interactions in terms of dibaryon fields .",
    "the resulting effective lagrangian for the three - nucleon system can be written as @xcite & = & l_n + l_s + l_t + l_3 , where @xmath5 is the standard one - nucleon lagrangian in the heavy - baryon formalism , _",

    "this allows us to present the general structures of the three - body equations , which will be needed for extensions of this work to higher orders .",
    "we have not included the neutron - proton mass difference which is not only of higher order but is smaller than might be expected as a result of cancellations between electromagnetic and strong contributions @xcite . to the order we work",

    "the contribution of this force to the triton-@xmath0he splitting is about 50  kev .",
    "this is much larger than the 5  kev estimate of the three - body contribution in ref .",
    "@xcite , which may reflect the fact that other isospin - breaking effects are missing from our calculatation . also , the results of ref .",
    "@xcite were obtained using an eft that includes pion fields .",
    "we have studied @xmath0he within the framework of the pionless eft , treating the coulomb interaction nonperturbatively .",
    "we solve the set of integral equations developed by kok _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , which can be thought of as extending the equation of skornyakov and ter - martirosian @xcite to include the full off - shell coulomb @xmath1-matrix .",
    "we find that a three - body interaction is required at leading order in @xmath0he , as in the triton .",
    "this force also exhibits the same limit - cycle behavior as a function of the cutoff @xmath3 as found by bedaque _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite for systems with purely short - range interactions .",
    "these results show that the coulomb interaction is not singular enough to alter the deeply bound ",
    "efimov \" states in the three - nucleon system .",
    "we find that an isospin symmetric three - body force , fit to the triton binding energy , can give the @xmath0he binding to better than 1% .",
    "the scale parameter of the force that fits @xmath0he differs from the corresponding value for the triton by about 0.5% .",
    "this is of the expected size for an order-@xmath124 electromagnetic effect .",
    "our results demonstrate that the coulomb interaction has no nonperturbative effect on the renormalisation of the three - body force in @xmath0he .",
    "moreover the overall contributions of the coulomb interaction to the binding energy of @xmath0he are small , perhaps unsurprisingly given the typical momenta involved , and so could have been calculated perturbatively",
    ". this will not be the case if our approach is extended to describe low - energy @xmath4 scattering .",
    "however , as noted above , such an extension will require improved numerical techniques to handle the singularity of the coulomb interaction .",
    "our approach could also be used to determine the @xmath0he wave function from the corresponding eigenvector of the set of integral equations .",
    "this could then be used in calculations of electromagnetic properties of @xmath0he , based on the methods in ref .",
    ".    our present results do include certain other isospin - breaking effects beyond lo in this eft , through the @xmath32 and @xmath31 @xmath30 scattering lengths .",
    "a proper treatment of these in the three - nucleon system will require a consistent higher - order calculation .",
    "we have provided here the basic forms of the integral equations allowing for isospin - breaking in the nn scattering lengths .",
    "the relevant power counting for the terms needed in a full calculation can be determined using the techniques in refs .",
    "this work was supported by stfc grants pp / f000448/1 and st / f012047/1 .",
