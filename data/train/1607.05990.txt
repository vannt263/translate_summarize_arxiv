    "as outlined by roman and bico  @xcite , the winding threshold can be predicted from simple energetic considerations . the transition can be explained considering a two - state model where a fiber and a droplet are either in isolation or in the wound state . upon winding",
    ", the surface energy of the system is reduced due to contact between the droplet and the fiber by an amount @xmath67 per unit length , where @xmath68 is a prefactor which depends on the details of the wetting geometry . note",
    "that since we are in the regime @xmath69 , the droplet remains nearly spherical after being wound , and any change in surface energy due to a global change in shape of the droplet is neglible ( as will be demonstrated in the next section ) .",
    "the energetic penalty associated with winding around the droplet is an increase in bending energy of the fiber given by @xmath47 per unit length , where @xmath70 is the bending modulus of the fiber .",
    "thus , the total energy change upon winding is : @xmath71 winding occurs when it lowers the free energy of the system , which results in the winding criterion : @xmath72 where @xmath73 . to attain a prediction for @xmath68",
    ", we must consider the microscopic wetting geometry between the fiber and the droplet .",
    "since @xmath69 , we describe the droplet as an infinite bath and the equilibrium wetting is attained in the same way as a cylinder on the surface of a liquid bath , where the liquid surface is flat and young s law is satisfied .",
    "overall , there is a loss of liquid - vapour and solid - vapour interface in favour of a gain of solid - liquid interface . considering this microscopic picture",

    "as explained in the main manuscript , for sis we make the qualitative observation that the bending cost of the fiber not in contact with the droplet is roughly equal in magnitude to the bending cost of the fiber being wet by the droplet .",

    "when considering the free - energy change upon the fiber winding the droplet , we only considered bending energy and wetting energy between the fiber and the droplet . in doing so , we ignored any global changes in area as the droplet assumes a lenticular shape . to justify this assumption , we must first examine the resultant lenticular shape which is depicted in fig .

    "<S> is interesting as there are two possible equilibrium states : an axisymmetric `` barrel '' configuration and a non - axisymmetric  clam - shell \"  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is then not surprising that the case of a flexible fiber interacting with a liquid is a rich subject of study , showcasing complexity and stunning examples of self - assembly  @xcite . in a series of beautiful experiments , </S>",

    "<S> in such a case , a soft fiber may instead wind _ around _ the surface of a droplet without experiencing a buckling transition  @xcite . as argued by roman and bico , </S>",

    "<S> this is reminiscent of dna molecules wrapping around histone octamers to form compact structures within the nucleus  @xcite . when a droplet is wound by a fiber , it changes from a spherical shape to a lens configuration in which the fiber is positioned at the equator . </S>",

    "<S> the fibers were made using two different materials : polystyrene ( ps ) with molecular weight @xmath6  kg / mol ( polymer source inc . ) , which is a glass at room temperature ; and styrene - isoprene - styrene ( sis ) triblock copolymer ( 14% styrene content , sigma - aldrich ) , which is a physically crosslinked elastomer at room temperature . </S>",
    "<S> ps fibers were made by dipping a micropipette into a ps melt held at 170  @xmath7c and then quickly pulling the pipette out , resulting in fibers with radii @xmath8 , as measured with optical microscopy . </S>",
    "<S> a similar procedure was used to produce sis fibers . </S>",

    "<S> fiber radii were uniform to within 10% over the length used . </S>",
    "<S> the young s modulus of ps is found in the literature to be 3.4  gpa  @xcite , and the young s modulus of sis was determined to be @xmath10  mpa by pulling on fibers and measuring the resultant forces using a micropipette deflection technique  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the experimental setup for the ps fibers is depicted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1](a ) . </S>",
    "<S> initially , both ends of a given fiber are taped to two separate silicon pieces , which are pulled apart to hold the fiber taut . </S>",
    "<S> a glass micropipette is used to support a glycerol droplet , whose surface tension with air is @xmath11  mn / m  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the pipette is connected to a syringe filled with glycerol , which allows us to precisely control the size of the droplet . the fiber is then brought into contact with the liquid droplet . once in contact , </S>",
    "<S> the fiber is snipped at one end so that it is free to move and no longer under tension . </S>",

    "<S> a typical optical image is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1](b ) , where it is clear that the fiber deforms through its interaction with the droplet . </S>",
    "<S> we can analyze these images to extract the angle @xmath12 through which the fiber is bent , the droplet radius @xmath13  marginally modified by the fiber since @xmath14  and the shape of the fiber in the contact region , shown schematically in fig .  [ fig1](c ) . outside the region of liquid contact , the fiber is straight .    </S>",
    "<S> we begin the experiments with a relatively small droplet ( @xmath15 m ) , and observe that there is only a minor deformation of the fiber . by applying pressure through the syringe the droplet grows , and as a result , the fiber increases its contact with the droplet , and the deformation angle @xmath12 increases . </S>",
    "<S> the data are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2](a ) , in which @xmath12 is plotted as a function of @xmath13 for different fiber radii @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> we observe that for a given droplet radius , thicker fibers exhibit smaller deformations , due to the higher bending moduli . </S>",
    "<S> since the bending of the fiber is caused by the interaction with a liquid droplet , capillarity is the driving mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath4 is thus expected to be the relevant length scale of the problem , as confirmed by the collapse of the data ( within error ) in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2](b ) where @xmath13 is normalized by @xmath4 .    </S>",
    "<S> although the problem of a liquid droplet deforming an elastic beam has been solved analytically in 2d  @xcite , the 3d analogue is considerably more complicated . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we focus on the essential physical ingredients only and propose the following minimal model . </S>",
    "<S> we consider an idealized force distribution acting on the elastic fiber , in the contact region of length @xmath16 , as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1](d ) . </S>",
    "<S> as seen in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1](b ) , at each of the two edges of the contact region , there is a meniscus force pulling the beam inwards towards the droplet . due to its capillary origin , this force is expected to scale as @xmath17 , where the factor 2 accounts for the two sides of one meniscus , and where @xmath18 is a length scale characterizing the lateral extent of the meniscus  while incorporating as well an unknown dimensionless geometrical prefactor of order unity . as @xmath18 is expected to be substantially smaller than @xmath13 , we describe the meniscus force as being point - like . to maintain a zero net force at equilibrium </S>",
    "<S> , there must also be a force in the contact region pushing the beam outwards . for simplicity , we assume it to be uniformly distributed with the linear density @xmath19 whose integral over the contact region balances the two meniscus forces </S>",
    "<S> . we may now solve for the fiber profile @xmath20 in the contact region , invoking the small - deformation bending - beam equation  @xcite : @xmath21 , where the prime denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath22 , and where @xmath23 is the bending modulus of the fiber . using the no - torque boundary condition @xmath24 , the origin definition @xmath25 , and the even symmetry @xmath26 </S>",
    "<S> , the solution reads : @xmath27\\ .\\ ] ] from this solution , it is straightforward to determine the outer slope @xmath28 , and the central radius of curvature @xmath29 , that characterize the deformation . motivated by experimental data in the small-@xmath12 limit  @xcite , we further assume the scale - separation relations : @xmath30 , and @xmath31 , where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are dimensionless constants . </S>",
    "<S> in such a description , one finally gets : @xmath34    from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ tan ] ) , we confirm that @xmath12 is a function of @xmath35 only . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the best fit of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ tan ] ) to small - angle data ( @xmath36 and @xmath37 where the scaling @xmath38 is valid  @xcite ) is shown in fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig2](b ) . </S>",
    "<S> we see that the fit describes the data well for small @xmath12 but fails to capture the large - angle data . </S>",
    "<S> this is to be expected since a small - deformation theory was employed and the contact region @xmath39 deviates from the assumed scaling at large deformation . </S>",
    "<S> similarily , eq .  ( [ rf ] ) </S>",
    "<S> can be tested by measuring @xmath40 , the central radius of curvature of the fiber , for various experiments  @xcite . as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] , the collapse of the data for different fiber thicknesses is consistent with the prediction , and the best fit to eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ rf ] ) is excellent , even at large angles . </S>",
    "<S> we assume the success at large angles is because @xmath40 is a local quantity in the central region where @xmath41 is small . moreover , from the fit parameters , we find @xmath42 and @xmath43 for the two unknown prefactors characterizing the contact and meniscus lateral extents for a ps fiber . </S>",
    "<S> these values imply that the contact region is comparable to the droplet size , while the meniscus is roughly an order of magnitude larger than the fiber diameter . </S>",
    "<S> these results are consistent with what we would expect from the optical images  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we note that if the curvature of the fiber matches that of the droplet , this corresponds to the fiber winding around the droplet . </S>",
    "<S> thus , winding should occur when @xmath44 which , using eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ rf ] ) and the values of @xmath33 and @xmath32 , corresponds to @xmath45 for ps . as indicated by the vertical dashed line in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2](b ) , this prediction is consistent with the data , as the winding angle appears to diverge at this point .    </S>",
    "<S> eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ rf ] ) suggests that there is a critical droplet size for which fibers will completely wind around the droplet . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , we verify experimentally that when a fiber is placed into contact with a sufficiently large droplet , the fiber does spontaneously wind as previously found by roman and bico  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> roman and bico showed that this transition can be simply explained from energetic considerations . upon winding , </S>",
    "<S> the free energy of the system can be written per unit length , with only two terms  @xcite : the surface energy of the system , which is negative ( i.e. reduced compared to the unwound state ) due to contact between the droplet and the fiber and scales like @xmath46 , and an energetic penalty associated with the bending of the fiber , which scales like @xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> winding occurs when it lowers the free energy of the system , which results in the winding criterion @xmath48 , where @xmath49 depends on the details of the wetting geometry  @xcite . in the limit @xmath50 , </S>",
    "<S> the microscopic wetting picture is equivalent to that of a cylinder on the surface of a liquid bath , where the liquid surface is flat and young s law is satisfied  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> considering this , we find @xmath51}$ ] , where @xmath52 is the young s angle of the liquid on the solid . inserting the measured values of @xmath52 </S>",
    "<S> , we finally evaluate @xmath53 and @xmath54 for ps and sis respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the predicted value for ps compares closely with the value of @xmath55 attained from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ rf ] ) .    to test the predicted winding threshold for ps </S>",
    "<S> , we utilize the same experimental design as depicted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1](a ) , and observe whether or not the fiber spontaneously winds around the droplet . </S>",
    "<S> this experiment allows us to construct a winding phase diagram of @xmath13 as a function of @xmath4 as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4](a ) . </S>",
    "<S> the circular data points correspond to winding events and square data points denote experiments in which no winding occurred . the black line is the best fit to a phase boundary represented by a line passing through the origin . from the fit , </S>",
    "<S> we extract @xmath56 , which is in excellent agreement with the energetically derived value of @xmath57 and the value of @xmath55 attained from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ rf ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> since sis has a modulus three orders of magnitude smaller than ps , the bending elastocapillary length for the fiber radii used is much smaller than for ps . due to this , significantly smaller droplets are required for the experiment and it no longer becomes practical to suspend these droplets at the tip of a micropipette . </S>",
    "<S> instead , we keep the sis fibers taut between two supports and directly transfer a glycerol droplet onto the fiber . in doing so , the droplet assumes a clam - shell configuration  @xcite , but is close to spherical since @xmath58 . </S>",
    "<S> subsequently , the supports are brought in closer together , and as the fiber slackens , the droplet gets wound by the fiber if the droplet is sufficiently large . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting phase diagram is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4](b ) . once again </S>",
    "<S> , the phase boundary is well fit by a line passing through the origin . </S>",
    "<S> however , we find @xmath59 , significantly larger than the value predicted using energy considerations : @xmath60 . </S>",
    "<S> the origin of this discrepancy is likely due to the fact that , in this case , the droplets are pendant on the taut fiber which has no free ends for winding . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig5](a ) , we show a sequence of images showcasing how winding occurs in this geometry  @xcite . in this sequence </S>",
    "<S> , it is evident that the fiber not only bends when in contact with the droplet ( as in the ps case ) , but retains some curvature beyond the contact patch . </S>",
    "<S> this additional bending cost must be included in the energy argument leading to the winding criterion . from the optical images , we note that the integrated curvature outside of contact is approximately equal to to that in contact . </S>",
    "<S> thus , if we argue that the two bending costs are roughly equal in magnitude  @xcite , we arrive at @xmath61 as a rough estimate , consistent with the experimentally measured value .    in the sis experiments , </S>",
    "<S> as the supports are brought closer together , the fiber continuously winds around the droplet . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting fiber loops are packed closely together and produce stunning coils . </S>",
    "<S> an example is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig5](b ) , where we observe five tightly wound loops of fiber on the surface of a droplet . </S>",
    "<S> as the sis fibers are sticky , the liquid can be removed ( by , for instance , dissolving away the liquid in a volatile solvent ) while still leaving the fiber structure intact , as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig5](c ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we have investigated the elastocapillary interaction between liquid droplets and thin flexible fibers . </S>",
    "<S> the fibers develop a contact region with the liquid and become deformed by capillary forces . </S>",
    "<S> we quantify the resultant deformation and find the ratio of the droplet size to the bending elastocapillary length to be the relevant variable . to gain further insight into the fiber bending , we present a minimal model based on elastic - beam theory , which captures the scalings for the deformation angle and central curvature of the bent fiber . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , fibers are seen to spontaneously wind around droplets roughly larger than the bending elastocapillary length . </S>",
