    "let @xmath1 , @xmath2 , be an @xmath3-valued markov process .",
    "we study an integral functional @xmath4 of this process . the most natural numerical scheme to approximate such a  functional is the sequence of integral sums @xmath5 and the main objective of this paper is to study approximation rates within this scheme .",
    "the function @xmath6 , in general , is not assumed to be smooth , and therefore the mapping @xmath7 \\bigr\\}\\mapsto\\int_0^th(x_t)\\ , dt\\ ] ] may fail to be lipschitz continuous ( and even simply continuous ) on a natural functional space of the trajectories of @xmath8 ( e.g. , @xmath9 or @xmath10 ) .",
    "this makes it impossible to carry out the error analysis with a classical technique ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the typical case of interest here is @xmath11 , with @xmath12 being respectively the occupation time of @xmath8 at the set @xmath13 up to the time moment @xmath14 .    in the paper ,",
    "we establish strong @xmath0-approximation rates , that is , the bounds for @xmath15 our research is strongly motivated by the recent paper @xcite , where such a problem was studied in a particularly important case where @xmath8 is a one - dimensional diffusion , and we refer the reader to @xcite for more motivation and background on the subject . the technique developed in @xcite , involving both the malliavin calculus tools and",
    "the gaussian bounds for the transition probability density , relies substantially on the structure of the process , and hence it seems not easy to extend this approach to other classes of processes , for example , multidimensional diffusions or solutions to lvy driven sdes .",
    "we would like to explain in this note that , in order to get the required approximation rates , one can modify some well - developed estimates from the theory of continuous additive functionals of markov processes .",
    "an advantage of such approach is that the assumptions on the process are formulated only in terms of its transition probability density and therefore are quite flexible .",
    "the basis for the approach is given by the fact that the weak approximation rates for @xmath16 are available as a consequence of a bound for the derivative w.r.t .",
    "@xmath17 of the transition probability density ; see @xcite , theorem 2.5 , and proposition [ p21 ] below . to explain the principal idea of the approach ,",
    "let us assume for a while that @xmath6 is nonnegative and bounded .",
    "then the integral functional @xmath12 is a _",
    "@xmath18-functional _ of the process @xmath8 ; see @xcite , chapter 6 .",
    "it is well known that the properties of a @xmath18-functional are mainly controlled by its _",
    "characteristic _ , that is , the expectation @xmath19 in particular , the convergence of characteristics implies the @xmath20-convergence of the respective functionals .",
    "the core of our approach is that we extend the dynkin s technique for a study of convergence of @xmath18-functionals and give approximation rates for integral functionals @xmath21 by difference functionals @xmath22 , based on the weak approximation rates for their expectations .",
    "we remark that now we are beyond the scopes of the original dynkin s theory because @xmath21 _ may fail _ to be a @xmath18-functional ( we do not assume @xmath6 to be nonnegative ) , and @xmath22 _ definitely fails _ to be a @xmath18-functional .",
    "in addition , dynkin s theory addresses @xmath20-bounds , whereas , in general , we are interested in @xmath0-bounds .",
    "this brings some extra difficulties , which however are not really substantial , and we resolve them in a way similar to the one used in the classical khasminskii lemma ; see , for example , lemma 2.1 in @xcite .",
    "in what follows , @xmath23 denotes the law of the markov process with @xmath24 , and @xmath25 denotes the expectation w.r.t .",
    "the natural filtration of the process @xmath8 is denoted by @xmath26 .",
    "the process @xmath8 is assumed to possess a transition probability density , denoted below by @xmath27 . by @xmath28",
    "we denote a generic constant ; the value of @xmath28 may vary from place to place .",
    "both the absolute value of a real number and the euclidean norm in @xmath29 are denoted by @xmath30 .",
    "our standing assumption on the process @xmath8 under investigation is the following .    1 .",
    "the transition probability density @xmath27 is differentiable w.r.t . @xmath17 and satisfies @xmath31 with some fixed @xmath32 $ ] and distribution density @xmath33 .",
    "the assumption * x * is motivated by the following class of processes of particular interest .",
    "let @xmath8 be a symmetric @xmath34-stable process with @xmath35 $ ] ; in the case @xmath36 this is just a brownian motion .",
    "then @xmath37 with @xmath38 being the distribution density of @xmath39 .",
    "respectively , ( [ der_bound ] ) holds with @xmath40 , @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 should be chosen such that @xmath44 .",
    "observe that , in a sense , this bound is `` stable under perturbations of the process @xmath8 . ''",
    "namely , if @xmath8 is a uniformly elliptic diffusion with hlder continuous coefficients , then ( [ der_bound ] ) with @xmath45 and properly chosen @xmath46 is provided by the classical _ parametrix method _ ; see @xcite .",
    "an analogue of the parametrix method for @xmath34-stable generators with state - dependent coefficients yields the bound ( [ der_bound ] ) with @xmath47 , @xmath48 , for @xmath34-stable driven processes @xmath8 ; see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "our principal assumption on the function @xmath6 is the following .    1 .",
    "the function @xmath6 satisfies @xmath49 where @xmath50 is a fixed function such that * @xmath51 , @xmath52 ; * @xmath53 , @xmath54 ; * @xmath55 is submultiplicative , that is , @xmath56    observe that for a bounded @xmath6 , condition * h1 * holds trivially with @xmath57 . on the other hand , in particular cases , one can weaken the assumptions on @xmath6 by using nontrivial `` weight functions '' @xmath55 .",
    "for instance , if @xmath40 from the above example , then one can take @xmath58 with arbitrary @xmath28 and @xmath59 .",
    "we denote @xmath60 the following auxiliary statement is crucial for the whole approach .",
    "its proof is completely analogous to the proof of ( a part of ) theorem 2.5 @xcite , but in order to make the exposition self - sufficient , we give it here .",
    "[ p21 ] let * x * and * h1 * hold",
    ". then @xmath61 with @xmath62    write @xmath63 we have , by the bound for @xmath27 in ( [ dens_bound ] ) and properties of @xmath55 , @xmath64 next , @xmath65 with @xmath66 then @xmath67 and therefore , using the bound for @xmath68 in ( [ der_bound ] ) , we obtain , similarly to ( [ 11 ] ) , @xmath69 which completes the proof .      our main estimate , in a shortest and most transparent form ,",
    "is presented in the following theorem , which concerns the case where the only assumption on  @xmath6 is that the weighted sup - norm @xmath71 is finite .",
    "[ t1 ] let * x * and * h1 * hold . then for every @xmath72 such that @xmath73 we have @xmath74 with constant @xmath28 depending on @xmath75 only .",
    "denote , for @xmath76 , @xmath77 and write the difference @xmath78 in the integral form : @xmath79 hence , this difference is an absolutely continuous function of @xmath17 , and using the newton ",
    "leibnitz formula twice , we get @xmath80 we then write @xmath81 where @xmath82",
    "let us estimate separately the expectations of @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "by the hlder inequality , @xmath85 again by the hlder inequality , @xmath86 because @xmath87 $ ] , we have @xmath88 , and , consequently , @xmath89 by the properties of @xmath55 and the bound ( [ dens_bound ] ) we have @xmath90 for any @xmath91 $ ] . using this bound with @xmath92 and recalling that @xmath93",
    ", we get @xmath94 with constant @xmath28 depending on @xmath75 only .",
    "next , observe that , for every @xmath95 , the variables @xmath96 are @xmath97-measurable .",
    "hence , @xmath98 by proposition [ p21 ] and the markov property of @xmath8 we have @xmath99 hence , again , using the hlder inequality we get @xmath100 similarly to ( [ 13 ] ) , we have @xmath101 hence , the above bounds for @xmath102 and @xmath103 finally yield @xmath104 with a constant @xmath28 depending on @xmath75 only .",
    "it can be seen easily that in this inequality one can write arbitrary @xmath105 instead of @xmath14 , with the same constant @xmath28 .",
    "taking the integral over @xmath17 , we get @xmath106 because @xmath107 and @xmath108 satisfies the integrability condition from the condition of the theorem , the left - hand side expression in the last inequality is finite . hence , resolving this inequality , we get @xmath109 which , together with ( [ 14 ] ) , gives the required statement .      in this section",
    ", we consider the case where @xmath6 has the following additional regularity property .    1 .",
    "the function is hlder continuous with index @xmath110 $ ] , that is , @xmath111    an additional regularity of @xmath6 allows one to improve the accuracy of the previous estimates .",
    "namely , the following statement holds .",
    "[ t2 ] assume that * x * , * h1 * , and * h2 * hold .",
    "then , for every @xmath72 such that @xmath112 and @xmath113 we have @xmath114 with constant @xmath28 depending on @xmath115 only .",
    "the method of the proof remains the same as that of theorem [ t1 ] ; hence , we use the same notation .",
    "the only new point is that , instead of the bound @xmath116 now a more precise inequality is available , based on the hlder continuity of  @xmath6 .",
    "namely , we have @xmath117 where @xmath28 depends on @xmath118 only .",
    "the last inequality holds due to the following representation . by the markov property of @xmath8 , for @xmath119 , we have @xmath120 where @xmath121    thus , for @xmath87 $ ] , we have @xmath122 and @xmath123 with constant @xmath28 depending on @xmath118 only . next , using ( [ lip_bound ] ) and ( [ 13 ] ) , we have @xmath124 and @xmath125    hence , the previous bounds for @xmath102 and @xmath103 finally yield @xmath126 with constant @xmath28 depending on @xmath115 only . using the same procedure",
    "as that provided at the end of the proof of theorem 2.1 , we simply have @xmath127 which , together with ( [ 15 ] ) , completes the proof .",
    "the results of theorem [ t1 ] and theorem [ t2 ] should be compared with theorem 2.3 in @xcite , where , in our notation , the following bounds were obtained : @xmath128 in theorem 2.3 of @xcite , @xmath6 satisfies our conditions * h1 * and * h2 * with @xmath129 , and @xmath8 is a one - dimensional diffusion with coefficients that satisfy some smoothness condition ( assumption ( h ) ) ; in particular , * x * holds with @xmath36 . in this case , our bound @xmath130 given in theorem [ t2 ] , is somewhat worse .",
    "on the other hand , this bound is of an independent interest because of a wider class of processes @xmath8 it applies to .",
