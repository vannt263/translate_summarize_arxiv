    "it is well - known that computing a trajectory in the close vicinity of a fixed point is associated with many problems .",
    "numerical integration schemes ( silently ) break down when the vector field tends to zero , and this usually results in completely inaccurate results . indeed , as the norm of the vector field decreases , the flow - time needed to pass a saddle increases without bound .",
    "this means that no integration scheme , rigorous or not , will function properly is this situation .",
    "there are , however , many instances where it is necessary to be able to follow the flow of a vector field arbitrarily close to a saddle .    we present a completely automated , rigorous method that produces analytical estimates on the flow close to a given saddle . equally important , it produces explicit bounds , for a given accuracy of the analytic estimates , on the size of the neighbourhood of the saddle on which the information is valid .",
    "this avoids the need to numerically integrate the flow near a saddle : once a trajectory comes close to the saddle , the bounds produced by our method give enclosures of where the trajectory exits the neighbourhood , and its associated flow - time .",
    "the approach is based on constructing a carefully chosen change of variables , that bring the original vector field into the robust normal form presented in @xcite .",
    "the present paper can be seen as a quantitative companion to @xcite , where several qualitative properties of robust normal forms are proved .",
    "many of the ideas behind the algorithm can be found in @xcite , where they were used for establishing that the lorenz equations support a strange attractor . in the present study",
    "we develop an algorithm for general planar real analytic vector fields .",
    "consider the planar vector field @xmath0 with @xmath1 , where @xmath2 and where @xmath3 is an analytic function , with @xmath4 .",
    "note that any vector field with a saddle fixed point can ( locally ) be brought into this form by an affine change of variables .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to describe , and implement , an algorithm that finds a square centred at the saddle in which we can enclose a trajectory and its flow - time passing near the saddle .",
    "the output of the program includes estimates on the norms of the change of variables , its inverse , and the nonlinear part of the normal form , as well as the flow - time for passing the saddle .",
    "this paper addresses the algorithmic aspects of the planar case of the robust normal forms introduced in @xcite , and formalised in @xcite . in order to simplify the formulae",
    ", we use vector and multiindex notation . the components of a vector are indexed by @xmath5 and @xmath6 for the stable and unstable direction , respectively . to make the presentation",
    "self - contained , we revise the necessary concepts from @xcite , but refer the reader to that paper for proofs and additional details .",
    "the structure of ( [ deq ] ) implies that the stable and unstable manifold of the origin are tangent to the coordinate axes . rather than attempting to find a coordinate change that completely linearises ( [ deq ] ) in accordance with siegel s theorem @xcite , we compute normal forms that are robust in the sense that the set of eigenvalues where they exist is open and dense .",
    "this is crucial from a computational point of view , as we often only have an approximate knowledge of the eigenvalues .",
    "our aim is to change ( [ deq ] ) into the normal form @xmath7 by an analytic change of coordinates , @xmath8 .",
    "we require that @xmath9 , the non - linear part of the new vector field , is such that the invariant manifolds of the saddle are not only tangent to the coordinate axes , but actually coincide with them locally .",
    "we also require that the vector field is at least linear on these invariant manifolds .",
    "that is , if we let @xmath10 , then we ensure that @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the _ order of flatness_. this means that if @xmath13 is a non - zero coefficient in the series expansion of @xmath9 , then @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "we call the non - negative number @xmath16 the _ order _ of @xmath17 , and define the set @xmath18 .    to formalise ,",
    "let us split the space of multi - exponents into the sets @xmath19 now we can define the set of admissible linear parts of ( [ deq ] ) that we consider : @xmath20 it is proved in @xcite that @xmath21 is open and has full lebesgue measure in @xmath22 . we will often use the notion of filters of a ( formal ) power - series : if @xmath23 , we use the notation @xmath24_{u_l}=\\sum_{m\\in u_l } \\alpha_m x^m,\\quad [ f]_{v_l}=\\sum_{m\\in v_l } \\alpha_m x^m , \\text { and } [ f]_{m}=\\alpha_m.\\ ] ] also , we let @xmath25 denote the partial sum of the first @xmath26 terms of @xmath27 .",

    "in this section we will describe an algorithm that computes explicit bounds on the constants @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , and @xmath77 appearing in theorems [ thm1 ] and [ thm2 ] .",
    "this allows us to interrupt a numerical integration scheme of the original vector field ( [ deq ] ) , and instead use the analytical bounds from theorem [ thm2 ] to enclose the flow on passing the saddle , together with bounds on the time it takes to pass the saddle .",
    "the main ideas of the algorithm appear in @xcite , where robust normal forms are computed for the lorenz system . in @xcite , however , the algorithm was designed exclusively for that particular system .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to construct a general algorithm , that will take any planar vector field of the form ( [ deq ] ) , and transform it into ( [ deq2 ] ) , together with explicit bounds on the aforementioned constants .",
    "we note that several heuristic constants appear in the algorithm : @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , and @xmath85 . in the actual implementation",
