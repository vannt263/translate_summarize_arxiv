    "in this paper we investigate the distribution of zeros of higher derivatives of the riemann zeta function . in order to put our main results in perspective , we first give a summary of some of the main results and conjectures in this area .",
    "let @xmath4 . for all @xmath5 the @xmath2-th derivative of the riemann zeta function @xmath0 is @xmath6 and can be extended to a meromorphic function on @xmath7 , with a single pole ( of order @xmath2 ) at the point @xmath8 . however , unlike @xmath1 itself , the functions @xmath0 have neither euler products nor functional equations .",
    "their non - trivial zeros do not lie on a line , but appear to be distributed ( seemingly at random ) to the right of the critical line @xmath9 . in 1934",
    "speiser @xcite was the first to show that the riemann hypothesis ( denoted rh everywhere below ) implies that @xmath10 has no zeros to the left of the critical line @xmath9 .",
    "unfortunately , for higher derivatives this particular property does not stay true .",
    "but , in 1974 , levinson and montgomery @xcite showed ( again , assuming the rh ) that the number of zeros of @xmath0 in the left half - plane is always finite .",
    "more recently yildirim @xcite proved that both @xmath11 and @xmath12 have exactly one pair of non - trivial zeros with @xmath13 , namely @xmath11 has a zero at approximately @xmath14 .",
    "he also showed that the rh implies that neither @xmath11 nor @xmath12 have any zeros @xmath15 with @xmath16 .     in @xmath7 , with the zero - free region.,width=453 ]    in regions to the right of the critical line , i.e. for @xmath17 , the total number of zeros of @xmath0 does not differ by much from the number of zeros of @xmath1 .",
    "in fact , if we let @xmath18 and @xmath19 denote the number of such zeros @xmath15 with @xmath20 of @xmath1 and @xmath0 , respectively , then according to berndt @xcite @xmath21 where , by the classical riemann - von mangoldt formula ( see landau @xcite ) , @xmath22    most non - trivial zeros of @xmath0 are located close to the line @xmath23 .",
    "soundararajan @xcite showed that , for @xmath24 , a positive portion of the zeros @xmath15 of @xmath10 satisfies @xmath25 .",
    "nevertheless many of the zeros of @xmath0 lie further to the right , even though their real parts can be bounded from above . for @xmath26",
    "such upper bounds were given by spira @xcite in 1965 .",
    "they were improved by verma and kaur @xcite ( see table  [ tablebound ] ) .",

    "in this last section we describe a counting technique that will allow us to obtain very precise ( for many heights even exact ) estimates for the number of zeros of @xmath0 in all critical strips @xmath27 .",
    "it differs from the classical quantitative methods ( notably berndt s , in @xcite , for @xmath19 ) in its use of rouch ' e s theorem .",
    "because of the property of the quasi - periodicity of the zeros of @xmath0 inside @xmath27 we are able to count the zeros by individual separation . in order for our approach to work ,",
    "we first find horizontal , periodically - spaced zero - free line segments within the critical strips ( in lemma  [ lemline ] ) .",
    "then we show that there is always exactly one zero of @xmath0 in the rectangles @xmath28 ( for @xmath29 ) that are delimited by the vertical edges of two of the neighbouring zero - free regions and two of those horizontal zero - free lines ( see figure  [ figbox ] ) .    as already mentioned above , in the critical strips @xmath27 , which are located between the two zero - free regions , where the expansion of @xmath0 is dominated by the terms @xmath30 and @xmath31 respectively",
    ", one can obtain values of the imaginary parts @xmath32 of expected zeros by solving the equation @xmath33 , an act of balancing the real and imaginary parts of two largest terms , and then choosing the horizontal lines of separation exactly halfway between them , thus managing to avoid even the most irregular of zeros inside @xmath27 .",
    "that is exactly what we do below .",
    "a nice consequence of this method is that all the zeros of @xmath0 inside @xmath27 are simple .",
    "[ lemline ] let @xmath34 and @xmath5 . if @xmath35 , then @xmath36 for @xmath37     the curve @xmath38 is the boundary of the rectangle @xmath28",
    "the point @xmath39 represents a zero of @xmath40 on the critical line @xmath41.,width=604 ]    for the sake of simplicity we consider the slightly wider rectangles @xmath28 , with the vertical boundaries : @xmath42 , composition of which contains @xmath27 . in the center of the critical strip @xmath27 , that is on the critical line @xmath41 we have @xmath43 .",
    "we consider the line segments in @xmath27 with @xmath44 so that @xmath45 .",
    "we set @xmath46 , with @xmath32 as above , and consider the real and imaginary parts of the expression @xmath47 with @xmath48 and @xmath49 we obtain @xmath50 , the situation is trivial , while if @xmath51 , then we either have @xmath52 or @xmath53 .",
    "therefore , because obviously @xmath54 and @xmath55 and by our choice of @xmath32 , we obtain : @xmath56 recall that @xmath57 and @xmath58 are decreasing in @xmath59 . from the proofs of lemma  [ lem11- ] and lemma  [ lem4 - 10 ] we know that @xmath60 similarly , since @xmath61 is decreasing in @xmath59 , we obtain @xmath62 which concludes the proof of the lemma .",
    "let @xmath63 .",
    "now that the non - vanishing of @xmath0 along the horizontal division lines has been established ( and those vertical lines , by definition , can not contain any zeros ) , we can integrate along the entire boundary @xmath38 of each of the rectangles @xmath28 described above ( see figure  [ figbox ] ) .",
    "moreover , theorem  [ thmone ] and lemma  [ lemline ] assert that we have @xmath64 along the vertical and horizontal parts of the boundary curve @xmath38 , respectively .",
    "thus , along the entire boundary of @xmath28 , the function @xmath0 is closely approximated by the function @xmath40 ; and therefore , by rouch s theorem , it has to have the same number of zeros inside @xmath28 , for every @xmath29 .",
    "however , it is now very easy to check that the approximation function @xmath40 has always exactly one zero in @xmath28 , namely @xmath65 this proves both the simplicity of all zeros of @xmath0 inside @xmath27 , and the sharp formula for @xmath66 , as given in corollary  [ corcount ] .    , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , and @xmath69.,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ] , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , and @xmath69.,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ] , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , and @xmath69.,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ] , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , and @xmath69.,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]",

    "<S> the main aim of this paper is twofold . </S>",
    "<S> first we generalize , in a novel way , most of the known non - vanishing results for @xmath0 by establishing the existence of an infinite sequence of regions in the right half - plane where these derivatives can not have any zeros ; and then , in the rare regions of the complex plane that do contain zeros of @xmath0 ( named `` critical strips '' in analogy with the classical case of @xmath1 ) , we describe a unexpected phenomenon , which  especially for the hitherto - neglected high derivatives @xmath0  implies great regularities in their zero distributions . in particular , we prove sharp estimates for the number of zeros in each of these new critical strips , and we explain how they converge , in a very precise , periodic fashion , to their central , `` critical '' lines , as @xmath2 increases . </S>",
    "<S> this not only shows that the zeros of @xmath0 are not randomly scattered to the right of the line @xmath3 , but that , in many respects , their two - dimensional distribution eventually becomes much simpler and more predictable than the one - dimensional behavior of the zeros of @xmath1 on the line @xmath3 . </S>"
