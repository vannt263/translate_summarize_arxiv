    "processes related to the emission of pions by accelerated protons like , for instance , @xmath3 , have been considered in the literature since the sixties@xcite . the present available observational data on strongly magnetized astrophysical objects",
    "could provide an exciting scenario to test theoretical predictions involving such kind of inertially forbidden processes .",
    "the relevant observer - independent parameter characterizing these phenomena is the dimensionless quantity @xmath4 , where @xmath5 and @xmath6 stand , respectively , for the proton proper acceleration and rest mass .",
    "( unless otherwise stated , natural unities are adopted through this work . ) for @xmath7 , one can employ a semiclassical approach where the proton is described by a classical current while the pion is considered as a fully quantized field .",
    "this corresponds to the so called no - recoil approximation , for which many analytical formulas are available .",
    "( for some recent works on the subject , see , for instance , @xcite and @xcite for the electromagnetic and gravitational cases , respectively . ) in particular , we expect a strong suppression of the pion emission for @xmath8 since such a process is well known to be inertially forbidden . for @xmath9 , a full quantized treatment is mandatory@xcite .",
    "however , numerical evidences suggest that some appropriate limits of certain results obtained with the no - recoil approximation can still be considered as good estimates@xcite . for the case of the usual photon synchrotron radiation , for instance",
    ", quantum effects were carefully considered@xcite and the semiclassical approach was found to be accurate within a few percent in the limit @xmath9 .",
    "notice that , in the cases where the proton acceleration is caused by strong magnetic fields , the parameter @xmath10 can be written in a similar way to the usual synchrotron radiation : @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the lorentz factor , @xmath13 is the magnetic field in the instantaneous reference frame of the proton , and @xmath14 g is a critical magnetic field strength , denoting the limit of the validity of the no - recoil approximation .",
    "thus , we have basically two regimes where the details of the pion emission by accelerated protons are known : the no - recoil regime @xmath15 , where @xmath16 mev stands for the @xmath17 mass , and the ultra - accelerated one , @xmath18 mev .",
    "the intermediate acceleration range corresponding to @xmath19 , which could encompass interesting astrophysical applications , is still open for debate .",
    "it is clear , however , that for such acceleration values , the pion emission channel will certainly be excited .",
    "in fact , the @xmath17 radiation process starts to become competitive with the usual photon synchrotron radiation only for @xmath20@xcite .",
    "the dominant decay mode for @xmath17 is the electromagnetic channel , giving origin to two photons@xcite . from the observational point of view ,",
    "charged pions are more promising since they decay preferentially by the weak channel in muons and neutrinos@xcite .",
    "processes like @xmath21 have also been considered@xcite , and they have essentially the same two regimes according to the value of the parameter @xmath10 .",
    "we notice , however , that the semiclassical analysis of such processes in magnetic fields is rather tricky since the neutron will not be accelerated and , consequently , will follow a different trajectory from the proton , implying that the initial ( @xmath22 ) and final ( @xmath23 ) currents are qualitatively different , in sharp contrast to the gravitational case . on the other hand , cases involving vector mesons like @xmath24 , with @xmath25 mev , as those ones considered in @xcite , are analogous to the neutral @xmath17 case .    in the present work",
    ", we search the atnf pulsar catalogue@xcite for strongly magnetized pulsars that could give rise to appreciable values for the parameter @xmath10 .",
    "we employ rather conservative estimates based on the simplest polar cap model for pulsars .",
    "the highest value of @xmath10 we found corresponds to the 16 ms pulsar j0537 - 6910 .",
    "unfortunately , the obtained value @xmath26 is too small in order to give origin to observable signals .",
    "nevertheless , our estimates reveal that a pulsar with period @xmath27ms and surface polar magnetic field @xmath28 g would suffice to induce detectable pion radiation from accelerated protons .",
    "our results can be applied also to the weak interaction channel emission , as in the process @xmath29 .",
    "the threshold in this case correspond to the electron mass @xmath30 mev .",
    "the @xmath10 values for the known pulsars , however , are not enough to excite this emission channels either . for a @xmath27ms pulsar , a magnetic field @xmath31 g",
    "would be required to induce the weak interaction emissions .",
    "we use here the simplest polar cap model for pulsars .",
    "( for a comprehensive review on the subject , see @xcite . )",
    "we recall that , in the magnetosphere of strongly magnetized pulsars , one expects an electric field component parallel to the magnetic field , which could accelerate charged particles up to relativistic velocities along the magnetic field lines near the polar region of the star .",
    "pulsars with polar caps for which @xmath32 , where @xmath33 and @xmath34 stand , respectively , for the rotation and the magnetic field vectors , could effectively accelerate protons away from the polar region surface . in the so called inner acceleration region@xcite",
    ", the accelerated particles are expected to radiate away their transverse energy so efficiently that they remain effectively constrained to move along the curved magnetic field lines with constant energy , corresponding to some landau level .",
    "the curvature radius @xmath35 of the polar magnetic field lines can be approximated by@xcite [ rc ] r_c^2 rp , where @xmath36 is the radius of the star , @xmath37 is the rotation period , and @xmath38 is a curved space correction term , which tends to increase @xmath35 by 25% - 30% when compared to the flat space formula .",
    "we assume the flat space value ( @xmath39 ) since we are going to estimate the maximum possible centripetal acceleration attained by protons . the curvature radius ( [ rc ] )",
    "does indeed correspond to the last open magnetic field line of the pulsar .",
    "for a relativistic particle following a circular trajectory with radius @xmath35 , the proper centripetal acceleration is given by @xmath40 .",
    "assuming that the kinetic energy @xmath41 of the accelerated proton moving along the last open magnetic field line was obtained from the parallel electric field , one has [ gamma ] _",
    "p = m_p = e , where @xmath42 accounts to the efficiency of the acceleration mechanism@xcite and = 2 ^ 2 is the goldreich - julian maximum potential drop near the star surface@xcite , with @xmath43 being the pulsar surface polar magnetic field . the maximum efficiency is expect to be as high as @xmath44 @xcite , but here we suppose total efficiency , @xmath45 .",
    "finally , the maximum centripetal acceleration of such protons leaving the polar cap along the last open magnetic field line can be approximated by [ acce ] 3m_p ( ) ^2 . for our purposes here , it is conveniente to introduce the usual dimensionless quantities @xmath46 and @xmath47 defined , respectively , by @xmath48s and @xmath49 g . assuming a typical radius @xmath50 m for the pulsar , one has finally [ chi ] = 0.35 b_12 ^ 2 p_-3 ^ - .",
    "the total energy acquired by the proton is another important quantity in our analysis . from ( [ gamma ] )",
    ", we have = 2 ^ 2 m_p , leading that [ gamma1 ] = 710 ^ 9b_12 p^-2_-3 for stars of the typical size .",
    "we evaluate @xmath10 as given by ( [ chi ] ) for all the 1700 pulsars in atnf catalogue@xcite with known @xmath37 and @xmath43 values .",
    "table [ table1 ] shows the ten pulsars with the highest values of @xmath10 .",
    ".[table1 ] top ten @xmath10 parameters , calculated according to ( [ chi ] ) , for the 1700 objects of the atnf pulsar catalogue@xcite with known @xmath37 and @xmath43 values .",
    "the last column is the total proton energy given by ( [ gamma1 ] ) .",
    "the pulsar period and magnetic field are , respectively , @xmath48s and @xmath49 g .",
    "analogously , we have @xmath51 and @xmath52 . [ cols=\"<,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     as one can see , these values are too small to give rise to detectable signals , since the pion emission channel is effectively excited only for accelerations such that @xmath53",
    ". nevertheless , the proton can indeed reach considerable high energies , as the last column of table [ table1 ] shows . for the j0537 - 6910 pulsar ,",
    "for instance , the proton can reach an energy @xmath54gev .",
    "we notice that for the pulsar with the highest surface magnetic field ( j1808 - 2024 , @xmath55 g ) , one has only @xmath56 , since its period is considerable large ( @xmath57s ) .",
    "all the known pulsars are contained in the regions bounded by the curves ( [ chi ] ) and ( [ gamma1 ] ) with , respectively , @xmath59 and @xmath60 ( upper ) and @xmath61 and @xmath62 ( bottom ) .",
    "the small values obtained for @xmath10 are , of course , a consequence of the large proton mass @xmath6 . had we considered electrons instead of protons , we would have @xmath63 g , and the parameter @xmath10 would be 10 orders of magnitude as larger .",
    "the regime @xmath64 can be easily reached for electrons , explaining the rich physics of electrons in typical pulsar magnetospheres .",
    "processes involving muons in circular orbits , like @xmath65 for instance , have also been investigated recently in the gravitational context @xcite .",
    "the muon mass is @xmath66 mev , implying a muon acceleration parameter @xmath67 for the pulsar j0537 - 6910 .",
    "this is not enough to lead to any appreciable deviation of the muon half life as considered in @xcite .",
    "since we have @xmath7 , we can apply safely the formulas obtained in the no - recoil approximation for the process @xmath3 . the total energy emitted by the pion synchrotron radiation , or in other words , the proton energy loss rate due to curvature pion radiation is given by@xcite = m_m_p ( - ) in the limit @xmath7 , where @xmath68 is the strong coupling constant .",
    "the so called cooling time @xmath69 is an important parameter corresponding to the time scale for which the process becomes relevant . for our case , we have [ tpi ] t_= 6 10 ^ -25 ^-1 ( 0.25 ^ -1 ) s , for stars of the typical size , with @xmath10 and @xmath12 given , respectively , by ( [ chi ] ) and ( [ gamma1 ] ) . the exponential term in ( [ tpi ] ) gives rise to unreasonable high values of @xmath70 for the pulsars in the atnp catalogue when compared , for instance , with the acceleration time @xmath71 @xcite . from figure [ fig1 ] , we can also infer the location of the curves with constant @xmath70 in the @xmath58 plane .",
    "notice that the curves of constant @xmath10 and @xmath12 are close in the log - log plot , since their inclination are , respectively @xmath72 and 2",
    ". regions of approximately constant @xmath10 and @xmath12 would give rise , according to ( [ tpi ] ) , to approximately constant @xmath70 .",
    "so , the curve of constant @xmath70 passing through the point @xmath58 will be quite close to the lines of constant @xmath10 and @xmath12 intercepting at the same point .",
    "for the the values of @xmath10 and @xmath12 corresponding to the upper bound of the known pulsars , we would have unreasonable highs values for @xmath70 .",
    "this is , of course , a consequence of the strong suppression of the pion radiation emitted by quasi - inertial protons .",
    "it is clear that no currently known pulsar could origin detectable signals of the curvature pion radiation emitted from accelerated protons in the magnetosphere .",
