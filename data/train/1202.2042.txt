    "furthermore , we have to generate nms vector fields on the pieces @xmath236 in such a way that these vector fields glue together to a vector field on @xmath1 that is nms .",
    "recall that for closed seifert manifolds there exists a surgical presentation as introduced in ",
    "[ sec : asodc ] . for a seifert manifold with boundary",
    "we can also provide such a description in an analogous manner . just note , that the base is a surface with boundary and that all @xmath51-bundles over such are trivial .",
    "for every seifert piece @xmath236 we pick such a presentation .",
    "the manifold @xmath236 admits a natural vector field @xmath237 which is tangent to the fibers .",
    "the presentation of @xmath236 we have chosen induces a preferred collar neighborhood for all of its boundary components .",
    "given such a boundary component , we have a preferred identification of a neighborhood with @xmath135\\times{\\mathbb{s}^1}$ ] .",
    "denote by @xmath238 the vector field in the direction of the interval .",
    "so , in a collar neighborhood of the boundary we perturb @xmath237 to @xmath239 , where @xmath183 is a non - negative function which is zero in a neighborhood of the boundary and increases to one as we move away from the boundary .",
    "and @xmath6 is a non - negative function which behaves in the opposite way as @xmath183 , i.e.  it is zero away from the boundary and it smoothly increases to one as we approach the boundary .",
    "we perform this construction with every seifert piece and then glue the vector fields together to obtain one on the manifold @xmath1 .",
    "we will denote this vector field by @xmath76 .",
    "this will serve us as our reference vector field .",
    "constructing nms vector fields on seifert pieces with boundary in principle works the same way as done in the previous section . by a mayer - vietoris argument",
    "it is not hard to see that every homology class @xmath240 can be written as @xmath241 + \\sum_{b=0}^{n_i}\\alpha_b[\\gamma_b ] + \\sum_{c=1}^{k_i-1}\\tau_c[\\delta_c ] , \\label{eq : rep}\\ ] ] where the @xmath242 are primitive elements in the homology of the surface , the @xmath243 , @xmath244 , are the exceptional orbits , @xmath52 is a regular fiber , and the @xmath245 are closed curves parallel to the boundary components of the surface .",
    "we proceed as before and create a morse - smale vector field @xmath149 on the base with the points @xmath246 as singularities and the curves @xmath247 and @xmath248 as periodic orbits .",
    "we lift this vector field with the procedure given in the previous sections ( using @xmath249 instead of @xmath237 ) and then destroy the invariant tori ( in the sense of proposition  [ prop : destroy_torus ] ) over both the @xmath250-curves and the @xmath251-curves .",
    "the destruction is done such that we create periodic orbits whose homology classes represent @xmath252 $ ] and @xmath253 $ ]",
    ". then the 5th operation of wada will allow us to replace @xmath243 , @xmath254 , by a periodic orbit which represents the class @xmath255 $ ] , @xmath254 .",
    "finally , we make the vector field transverse to the boundary components like done for the reference vector field . performing this construction for every piece @xmath236",
    ", these vector fields can be glued together to provide a nms vector field on @xmath1 whose set of periodic orbits contains a link @xmath80 consisting of attractive or repulsive orbits such that @xmath88={\\mathfrak{c}}$ ] for every given @xmath63 .        [ recover ] let @xmath1 be a graph manifold prime to @xmath3 and @xmath256 the natural map into the jaco - shalen - johansson complex of @xmath1 .",
    "then the homotopy class of a vector field @xmath71 admits a ( non - singular ) morse - smale representative if and only if @xmath257 vanishes in @xmath258 , where @xmath259 is the poincar dual of the euler class of the field of @xmath26-planes orthonormal to @xmath71 .",
    "furthermore , note that there are also homotopical invariants for vector fields on manifolds with boundary ( cf .  for instance @xcite ) .",
    "in  [ sec : asodc ] we briefly introduced the geometric interpretation of homology classes of vector fields .",
    "this is based on the pontryagin construction which is described in @xcite .",
    "the pontryagin construction as described in @xcite can be adapted to work for the case of manifolds with boundary .",
    "then for two vector fields @xmath22 , @xmath23 on a manifold @xmath1 with non - trivial boundary , the homology class of @xmath260 measures the homotopical distance away from the @xmath0-cells of @xmath1 as in the closed case .",
    "however , in the case of non - empty boundary , the vector fields are understood to be in a pre - chosen homotopy class along the boundary of @xmath1 ( cf .",
    "@xcite and ( * ? ? ?",

    "because the homotopical classification of vector fields on manifolds with boundary works the same way as in the closed case , we can apply our algorithm to the seifert pieces @xmath234 of a jsj decomposition of a graph manifold to obtain upper bounds for the @xmath261 .",

    "denote by @xmath264 the homology class of the reference vector field @xmath76 ( cf .",
    " [ sec : trvf ] )",
    ". by the considerations from above we can glue together nms vector fields on the pieces to obtain a nms vector field on @xmath1 .",
    "if we do this as before , we can define a nms vector field @xmath71 on @xmath1 such that @xmath265 is empty and , hence , @xmath264 can be written as a sum @xmath266 , @xmath14 ( cf .",
    "proposition  [ recover ] ) .",
    "so , suppose we are given a class @xmath92 which can be written as a sum of classes @xmath267 , @xmath14 . then by the previous discussion",
    ", we see that on every piece @xmath236 there exists a nms vector field @xmath106 whose set of periodic orbits contains a link @xmath268 consisting of attracting and repelling periodic orbits such that @xmath269={\\mathfrak{c}}_i-{\\mathfrak{e}}_i$ ] .",
    "we glue the @xmath106 together to obtain a nms vector field @xmath71 on @xmath1 .",
    "hence , the set of periodic orbits of @xmath71 contains the link @xmath270 .",
    "then @xmath265 is empty and , so , they lie in the same homology class .",
    "we generate a new nms vector field by reversing the orientation of the periodic orbits contained in @xmath80 .",
    "denote the new vector field by @xmath96 .",
    "then , we have @xmath271=[c_-(x',x_0)]+[x_0]=[l]+{\\mathfrak{e}}={\\mathfrak{c}}-{\\mathfrak{e}}+{\\mathfrak{e}}={\\mathfrak{c}}.\\ ] ] the maximal number of periodic orbits will be given when choosing a class @xmath272 whose presentation in the form of equation   has the property that @xmath273 for all @xmath274 , @xmath275 for @xmath254 , and @xmath276 for @xmath277 .",
    "so , a maximal class in the graph manifold is a sum of maximal classes of the seifert pieces .",
