    "extensions of the scalar sector of the standard model ( sm ) beyond the minimal single higgs doublet are of great interest in model building and collider phenomenology and are , as yet , largely unconstrained by experiment .",
    "such extensions are common in models that address the hierarchy problem of the sm , such as supersymmetric models  @xcite and little higgs models  @xcite , as well as in models for neutrino masses , dark matter , etc .",
    "most of these extensions contain additional su(2)@xmath4-singlet , -doublet , and/or -triplet scalar fields .",
    "however , some extensions of the sm contain scalars in larger multiplets of su(2)@xmath4 .",
    "such larger multiplets have been used to produce a natural dark matter candidate  @xcite , which is kept stable thanks to an accidental global symmetry that is sometimes present in the higgs potential for multiplets with isospin @xmath5 .",
    "several different models with a scalar quadruplet ( isospin @xmath6 )  @xcite or scalar quintuplet ( @xmath7 )  @xcite have also been proposed for neutrino mass generation .",
    "the quadruplet has also been studied in the context of strengthening the electroweak phase transition  @xcite .",
    "models in which the sm su(2)@xmath4-doublet higgs mixes with a septet ( @xmath8 ) , aided by additional representations of su(2)@xmath4 , have been studied in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "in this paper we consider models that extend the sm scalar sector through the addition of a _ single _ large multiplet .",
    "perturbative unitarity of scattering amplitudes involving pairs of scalars and pairs of su(2)@xmath4 gauge bosons requires that @xmath9 ( i.e. , @xmath10 ) for a complex scalar multiplet and @xmath11 ( i.e. , @xmath12 ) for a real scalar multiplet  @xcite .",
    "of particular interest are models that preserve a global u(1 ) or @xmath3 symmetry under which the large multiplet is charged . such symmetries sometimes arise accidentally at the renormalizable level due to the structure of the scalar potential ( in particular for multiplets with @xmath5 , i.e. , of size @xmath13 ) ; in other cases they can be imposed by hand .",
    "spontaneous breaking of a global u(1 ) symmetry is phenomenologically unacceptable because it would lead to a massless goldstone boson that couples to fermions through its mixing with the cp - odd component of the sm higgs doublet , and thus mediates new long - range forces between sm fermions .",
    "spontaneous breaking of a @xmath3 symmetry can lead to problems with domain walls , as well as being tightly constrained by measurements of the rho parameter @xmath14 .",
    "we will thus assume that the parameters of the scalar potential are chosen such that the u(1 ) or @xmath3 symmetry is not spontaneously broken .",
    "the lightest member of the single large multiplet is thus forced to be stable and becomes a dark matter candidate .",
    "we will consider only models in which the lightest member of the large multiplet is electrically neutral ; models in which the lightest member of the large multiplet is electrically charged are excluded or strongly constrained by the absence of electrically - charged relics .",

    "the scalar potential preserves an accidental global u(1 ) symmetry under which the large multiplet is charged .",

    "<S> this @xmath3 symmetry keeps the lightest ( neutral ) member of @xmath0 stable and has interesting implications for phenomenology . </S>",
    "<S> we determine the constraints on these models from precision electroweak measurements and higgs boson decays to two photons . </S>",
    "<S> we compute the thermal relic density of the stable member of @xmath0 and show that , for masses below 1  tev , it can make up at most 1% of the dark matter in the universe . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that current dark matter direct detection experiments do not constrain the models , but future ton - scale experiments will probe their parameter space . </S>"
