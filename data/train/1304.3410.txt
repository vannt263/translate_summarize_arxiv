    "measurements of identified particles in au@xmath6au collisions allow the study of particle production mechanisms in a hot and dense nuclear medium and probe the properties of the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp )  @xcite . in @xmath7@xmath6au collisions ,",
    "these measurements allow the study of cold nuclear matter effects on particle production , such as the cronin enhancement  @xcite , nuclear shadowing  @xcite , and gluon saturation  @xcite . these cold nuclear matter effects are present in au@xmath6au collisions as well , and the study of @xmath7@xmath6au collisions allows us to determine these effects directly and to disentangle them from the effects of the hot and dense nuclear medium .",
    "one of the most intriguing discoveries in the early days of the research program at the relativistic heavy ion collider was the significantly enhanced baryon production relative to meson production at intermediate transverse momentum 2  gev/@xmath8  @xmath9  5  gev/@xmath8 , as evidenced in the large baryon to meson ratios and the significant differences in the particle suppression patterns measured by the nuclear modification factors  @xcite .",
    "several classes of models were introduced to explain these differences based on different physical phenomena , such as strong radial flow  @xcite , baryon junctions  @xcite , and hadronization through recombination  @xcite .",
    "additionally , the recombination model has been employed to explain the baryon vs. meson difference in the cronin enhancement observed in p+a collisions  @xcite .",
    "traditional explanations of the cronin enhancement involve the multiple soft scatterings in the initial state prior to the hard scattering and subsequent fragmentation of the hard scattered parton  @xcite .",
    "this process can naturally explain the deficit of particle production at low @xmath0 and enhancement at intermediate @xmath0 , but does not account for the particle species dependence at relativistic - heavy - ion - collider energies  @xcite .",
    "conversely , in the recombination model , the observed enhancement is attributed to final state effects , i.e. the recombination of soft partons from the nuclear medium with hard scattered partons in a jet . for this reason",
    "@xmath7@xmath6au collisions represent an excellent testing ground for the recombination model , since hot nuclear matter effects , such as the collective expansion of the medium , are not expected .",
    "however , recent results in @xmath7@xmath6au collisions at 200  gev  @xcite and @xmath3@xmath6pb collisions at 5.02  tev  @xcite suggest some collective expansion effects may be present in the most central events",
    ".    measurements of strange particles , such as charged kaons , have also been an interesting subject in heavy ion collisions .",
    "an enhancement of strangeness production relative to that in @xmath3@xmath6@xmath3 collisions has been observed at various colliding energies  @xcite .",
    "this strangeness enhancement is a possible signature of deconfinement , thermalization , and flavor equilibration  @xcite . in this scenario ,",
    "strangeness production is dominated by thermal gluon fusion .",
    "the measurement of charged kaons in a broad @xmath0 range and in different centrality classes is a significant tool to further understand the thermalization of the system and the mechanism of strangeness production .    to address the particle production in both hot and cold qcd matter ,",
    "a systematic study of identified particles over a broad @xmath0 range with a wide selection of centralities in both au@xmath6au and @xmath7@xmath6au collisions is required . in this paper ,",
    "the spectra , particle ratios , and nuclear modification factors previously reported by phenix in au@xmath6au  @xcite and @xmath7@xmath6au collisions  @xcite are revisited , extending the @xmath0 reach of previous measurements and significantly improving the statistical precision . in section  [ s : exp ] we discuss the experimental apparatus and the detector subsystems used in this analysis ; in section  [ s : analysis ] we discuss the analysis method , including event and track selection , and particle identification ; in section  [ s : results ] we discuss the results ; and in section  [ s : summary ] , we summarize our findings .",
    "the phenix experiment is a large , general purpose detector with a wide variety of detector subsystems ideally suited to the study of nuclear matter in conditions of extreme temperature and density .",
    "phenix is composed of global event property detectors , forward and backward rapidity arms ( north and south ) dedicated to muon measurements , and two central arm spectrometers ( east and west ) at midrapidity covering pseudorapidity region of @xmath10  0.35 for measurements of photons , electrons , and charged hadrons .",
    "detailed descriptions of the various detector subsystems can be found in  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : phenix ] gives a schematic diagram of the phenix detector for the 2007 configuration ; the 2008 configuration is very similar .",
    "the upper panel shows the central spectrometer arms , viewed along the beam line facing north .",
    "the lower panel shows the two forward rapidity muon arms ( north and south ) and the global detectors .",
    "the analysis presented herein makes use of the beam - beam counters , the tracking system ( drift chamber and two layers of pad chambers ) , the electromagnetic calorimeter , and the time - of - flight detector in the west arm .",
    "the beam - beam counters ( bbc ) are used for the minimum - bias trigger , the centrality definition , the determination of collision vertex along the beam axis ( the @xmath11-vertex ) , and the event start time .",
    "the bbcs  @xcite are located at @xmath12  144  cm from the nominal interaction point .",
    "they cover 2@xmath13 in azimuth and a pseudorapidity range of 3.0  @xmath14  3.9 .",
    "each bbc is an array of 64 identical hexagonal detector elements , with the beam pipe passing through the center of the array .",
    "each element is a quartz erenkov radiation counter , and the radiator and photomultiplier tube are constructed as a single piece .",
    "the phenix tracking system is optimized for the high multiplicity environment of ultra - relativistic heavy ion collisions .",
    "it comprises drift chambers ( dc )  @xcite and pad chambers ( pc1 , pc2 , and pc3 )  @xcite .",
    "this analysis makes use of the first layer of pad chambers ( pc1 ) and the third layer ( pc3 ) .",
    "the dcs have an active volume in the radial range 2.02  m  @xmath15  2.46  m. the pc1 is mated directly to the back of the dc frame in each arm at a radial distance of 2.49  m. the pc3 is located in each arm at a radial distance of 4.98  m.    the primary particle identification detector used in this analysis is the time - of - flight detector in the west half of the central arm spectrometer ( tofw ) .",
    "the tofw  @xcite is located at a radial distance of 4.81  m from the interaction point , having pseudorapidity coverage of @xmath10 0.35 and azimuthal coverage of 22@xmath16 in two separate sections .",
    "the individual elements are multigap resistive plate chambers ( mrpcs ) .",
    "each mrpc has six 230  @xmath17 m gas gaps separated by five 550  @xmath17 m thick glass plates . on each side of the outermost glass plates ( 1.1  mm thick ) are carbon tape electrodes held at + 7  kv on one side and -7  kv on the other side for a total bias voltage of 14  kv .",
    "when charged particles traverse the detector , the gas between the plates is ionized and the image charge is collected at each side of the chamber on four copper readout strips .",
    "each strip has dimensions 37 @xmath18 2.8  @xmath19 with a separation of 0.3  cm between them .",
    "the strips are oriented lengthwise along the azimuthal direction .",
    "each strip is read out from both top and bottom so that the time difference between them can be used to determine the hit position along the length of the strip with resolution of order 1  cm .",
    "the tofw system is composed of a total of 128 mrpcs , 512 strips , and 1024 readouts .",
    "the total timing resolution , which includes the uncertainty in the start time from the bbc , is 84  ps in au@xmath6au collisions  @xcite . in @xmath7@xmath6au collisions it is 95  ps , where the slightly poorer resolution is due to the lower resolution of the start time determination from the bbc .",
    "this is due to the lower multiplicity in @xmath7@xmath6au collisions and , for the same reason , the @xmath11-vertex resolution is also poorer in @xmath7@xmath6au collisions .",
    "this paper presents an analysis of au@xmath6au collisions at @xmath5  =  200  gev , collected in 2007 , and @xmath7@xmath6au collisions at @xmath20  =  200  gev , collected in 2008 . for each set",
    "we select events that pass the minimum - bias trigger , which is defined as a coincidence between the north and south bbcs . in au@xmath6au collisions ,",
    "this trigger requires two or more photomultiplier tubes firing in each bbc and measures 92@xmath123% of the total inelastic cross section ; in @xmath7@xmath6au collisions , it requires one or more photomultiplier tubes firing in each bbc and measures 88@xmath124% of the total inelastic cross section .",
    "we have an additional requirement that the collision vertex is within @xmath21  30  cm of the nominal origin of the coordinate system .",
    "centrality selection is performed with the bbcs using the glauber monte carlo procedure described in  @xcite , in which the charge in each bbc detector is assumed to be proportional to the number of participating nucleons @xmath22 traveling towards it . for the au@xmath6au system the north and south bbc distributions",
    "are summed , but for the @xmath7@xmath6au system , only the south ( au - going ) side is used .",
    "the bbc charge is assumed to follow a negative binomial distribution ( nbd ) with a mean of @xmath22 and the remaining nbd parameters determined from a @xmath23 minimization of the combined glauber+nbd calculation with respect to the data .",
    "the bbc distributions are divided into equal probability bins , and the corresponding glauber distributions are used to calculate @xmath22 as well as the number of binary nucleon - nucleon collisions @xmath24 , as shown in table  [ t : centrality ] .",

    "the uncertainty on the occupancy correction for au@xmath6au collisions is roughly 10% , and therefore the uncertainty on the yield varies from 5% for the most central to less than 1% for the most peripheral .",
    "the uncertainties for the glauber values for @xmath24 are much larger and therefore dominate the uncertainty in the nuclear modification factors .",
    "the uncertainty for the bias factors for @xmath7@xmath6au collisions varies from about 1% for the most central bin to about 5% for the most peripheral bin .",
    "the bias factors are determined in the same glauber model analysis as the @xmath24 and @xmath22 values , and therefore the uncertainties are correlated . the uncertainty on the ratio of bias factors and @xmath24 values used to determine the nuclear modification factors varies from about 3% for the most central to about 8% for the most peripheral .",
    "the main result of this study is the measurement of the invariant yield of pions , kaons , and protons as a function of @xmath0 in different centrality classes .",

    "the yields are scaled by arbitrary factors indicated in the legend for the sake of clarity and to keep the collision species grouped together .",
    "one of the simpler classes of derived quantities is the antiparticle to particle ratio . in the present analysis",

    "however , the @xmath0 range needed to observe the decrease in these ratios in @xmath3@xmath6@xmath3 collisions is quite large . as seen in fig .",

    "the ratios in au@xmath6au collisions show a significant increase with increasing @xmath0 and a small increase as the collisions become more central .",
    "the enhancement of the integrated @xmath34 ratio in more central collisions is attributed to strangeness equilibration in various thermal models  @xcite , which is reflected in the differential ratio .",

    "as discussed in a previous phenix publication  @xcite , the strangeness enhancement present in the hot and dense nuclear medium has an effect on certain recombination models  @xcite .",
    "these recombination models involve the recombination of partons in dissimilar momentum space , meaning that a shower parton from a jet can recombine with a thermal parton in the medium .",
    "the thermal component of thermal+shower recombination is more dominant at higher @xmath0 for strange hadrons ( like kaons ) than it is for nonstrange hadrons ( like pions ) , leading to an enhancement of the ratio that increases with @xmath0 .",

    "this could mean that this ratio being less than unity is attributable to the parton energy loss in peripheral au@xmath6au .",
    "this picture is consistent with the findings in this paper and elsewhere that the @xmath38 of mesons indicates parton energy loss in the medium even in peripheral au@xmath6au collisions .",
    "it is striking , then , that this ratio is independent of particle species , which is suggestive of similar energy loss effects even for protons .",
    "this indicates that the baryon enhancement mechanism is the same in both systems .",
    "however , although @xmath24 and @xmath22 are consistent for the two systems , there is an inherent participant asymmetry that needs to be taken into account . in the case of peripheral au@xmath6au collisions , one has a scenario in which 7 or 8 nucleons on the edge of one au nucleus collide against 7 or 8 nucleons on the edge of the other au nucleus . on the other hand ,",
    "in the case of central @xmath7@xmath6au collisions , one has a scenario in which the 2 nucleons of the deuteron collide against 13 nucleons in the center of the au nucleus .",
    "this introduces several additional factors that need to be considered .",
    "for example , the participant asymmetry produces a rapidity shift in the particle production  @xcite .",
    "this may explain a deficit of soft particles at low @xmath0 in @xmath7@xmath6au collisions at midrapidity , which in turn would explain why the ratio trends up at low @xmath0 .",
    "we also note this low @xmath0 region where the ratio rises is where hydrodynamics effects are known to be important in au@xmath6au collisions .",
    "it is possible that there are collective flow effects in @xmath7@xmath6au collisions as well , as suggested by the recent results reported in refs .",
    "a full viscous hydrodynamics model comparison is warranted .",
    "another issue to consider is the modification of parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) in nuclei .",
    "these nuclear pdfs ( npdfs ) are known to be modified from the pdfs of single nucleons  @xcite .",
    "the experimentally measured npdfs are averaged over the entire nucleus and are typically compared to the deuteron pdf to determine the nuclear modification .",
    "the binary collisions in peripheral au@xmath6au involve two nucleons which have modified npdfs . on the other hand ,",
    "the binary collisions in central @xmath7@xmath6au involve an approximately unmodified nucleon from the deuteron and a modified nucleon from the au nucleus .",
    "physical observables sensitive to the npdfs would then be expected to be different for the two systems .",
    "however , it is possible that the nucleons in the more diffuse outer region of the nucleus have a different modification from those in the denser center .",
    "therefore , it is not possible to make any model - independent quantitative statements about the differences between the npdfs in these two systems .",
    "in summary we present a highly detailed and systematic study of identified charged hadron spectra and ratios as a function of @xmath0 and centrality for au@xmath6au and @xmath7@xmath6au collisions at @xmath5  200  gev .",
    "as has been reported previously , we find a baryon enhancement present in both systems . in @xmath7@xmath6au collisions ,",
    "the cronin enhancement has long been known to be stronger for baryons than for mesons . however , for the first time a study with enough statistical and systematic precision presents clear evidence for a strong centrality dependence of this effect . in au@xmath6au collisions",
    "the baryon enhancement has been attributed to parton recombination as the mode of hadronization .",
    "a version of the recombination model has been applied to @xmath7@xmath6au collisions as well , which reproduces the baryon vs. meson differences .",
    "the present data strongly suggest that further theoretical investigation is warranted .",
    "given the excellent statistical precision of the present data set , a direct comparison between the two is made for the first time .",
    "specifically , a ratio of the spectra in the most peripheral au@xmath6au and most central @xmath7@xmath6au collisions is measured .",
    "these two systems have nearly identical values of both @xmath24 and @xmath22 .",
    "therefore , a direct comparison between the two cancels out a large number of physical effects .",
    "we conclude that the baryon enhancement present in both systems is likely driven by a common hadronization mechanism .",
