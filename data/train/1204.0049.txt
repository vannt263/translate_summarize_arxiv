    "furthermore , the @xmath64 limit provides an upper bound on the ratio , permitting a very robust upper bound on the ground state mass prediction that is essentially independent of the qcd continuum approximation and resonance model .    before proceeding with the detailed analysis",

    "it is easy to see that the quark mass @xmath21 sets the basic scale of the mass prediction , so it is the most crucial parameter in our analysis .",
    "we have chosen to focus on sum - rule estimates of quark masses as they would provide the greatest possibility of a self - consistent prediction for the hybrid mass .",
    "in particular , the following values encompass the @xmath65 quark masses of refs .",
    "@xcite @xmath66 these values are within the particle data group s recommended ranges @xcite .",
    "since our calculation is leading order , one - loop @xmath54 expressions for the renormalization group evolution of the strong coupling and quark masses are appropriate . for the hybrid charmonium analysis ,",
    "the strong coupling is best determined by evolution from the @xmath56 mass , and in the hybrid bottomonium case by evolution from the @xmath67 mass : @xmath68 the numerical values of @xmath69 and @xmath70 are based on the determinations of @xcite , and we use particle data group values of the @xmath56 and @xmath67 masses @xcite .",
