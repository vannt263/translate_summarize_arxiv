    "since the interpretation of the observations is hardly unique , it is useful to compute polarization maps of the theoretical models , where the full three  dimensional information is available , and to infer their observable properties .",

    "we assume that protostellar cores are assembled by super  sonic turbulent flows in molecular clouds .",
    "we have shown in a previous work that the formation of cores by turbulent shocks provides an excellent interpretation of the relation between integrated intensity and rms velocity in molecular clouds ( padoan et al .",
    "alternative interpretations of this newly discovered property of molecular clouds have not been proposed so far .",
    "furthermore , super  sonic turbulence is ubiquitously observed in molecular clouds , and therefore models of core formation and evolution must take into account this turbulent environment self  consistently .",

    "we therefore interrupt the simulation at a time when most cores are just recently formed and start to collapse , which is about one dynamical time of the large scale .",

    "such relatively large values of @xmath5 , comparable to typically observed values , are usually found in models of super  alfvnic turbulence .",
    "this is due to the fact that each line of sight is normally dominated by one particular dense filament ( or edge  on sheet ) , where the magnetic field is rather uniform because it is amplified in the directions perpendicular to the shock compression that generates that filament ( or sheet ) .",
    "the power spectrum of turbulence contains most of the energy on the largest scales , which constrains the magnetic field tangling , in the sense that the number of correlation lengths of the magnetic field can never be @xmath101 ( see the discussion in   7 ) .",
    "for our polarization study , we select the brightest cores in the intensity map shown in figure  2 , in a similar way as protostellar cores would be selected from a sub  mm dust continuum map . since we are interested in relating the observable properties of the cores with their intrinsic three dimensional structure , we have limited our selection to intensity maxima that are also well defined in the three dimensional mhd data  cube .",
    "we have excluded the remaining two or three bright cores that are not easily identified in the original three dimensional data  cube , because of the contribution of multiple structures along the line of sight .",
    "we have selected three cores that we call c1 , c2 and c3 .",
    "their position is shown on the maps in figures  2 and 3 .",
    "we have verified , using the mhd data  cube , that the cores c1 , c2 and c3 are gravitationally bound ( gravitational energy in excess of the kinetic energy of turbulence ) .",
    "while the core c1 is still being assembled by a turbulent shock ( this is also indicated by its position as a density peak in a strongly curved segment of a filament ) , the core c3 is collapsing with a surrounding flow characterized by accretion along numerous filaments converging towards the core . the magnetic field around the core is roughly aligned with these accretion filaments . in the core c1 the magnetic field",
    "is roughly aligned with the filament where the core is located ( it is amplified in that direction by the shock compression ) , and is therefore strongly curved inside the core . the core c2 seems to be an intermediate case between c1 and c3 .",
    "the collapsing / accreting configuration of the core c3 can be explained as follows .",
    "once a core is formed by a shock as a density peak along a filament ( or on a sheet ) , part of the gas is moving along the filament ( or on the sheet ) away from the core , because of the pressure gradient .",
    "however , as long as the core becomes massive enough , its gravitational force becomes larger than the pressure gradient and the flow along the filament is reversed back into the core . in the simple case of a single shock the collapsing core",
    "will be accreting along two filaments ( the two sides of the original filament ) , while in the case of the brightest cores , located at the intersection of a number of shocks , many accreting filaments can be found .",
    "= 1    = 1    = 1    the region of the polarization map around each core is shown in the upper panels of figure  5 for model @xmath0 .",
    "the polarization vectors are here plotted for one position every two computational cells , and the largest polarization vectors ( found in the core c1 ) corresponds to @xmath102  % .",
    "the respective scatter plots of @xmath5 versus @xmath7 ( also for model @xmath0 ) are shown in the left panels of figure  6 , where the intensity @xmath7 is plotted in linear units , for a more direct comparison with published observational plots .",
    "the difference in the @xmath5@xmath7 plot between the cores c1 and c3 is remarkable in model @xmath0 .",
    "the plot for the core c1 is characterized by a lower envelope with @xmath5 increasing with increasing @xmath7 , while the plot for the core c3 shows a very clear upper envelope with @xmath5 decreasing with increasing @xmath7 .",
    "the excursion of the values of @xmath5 on the envelopes is from approximately 2% to 9% in the first case and from approximately 8% to 2% in the second case .",
    "the plot for the core c2 looks like an intermediate case .",
    "should we conclude that the @xmath5@xmath7 plot is a diagnostic for the time evolution of a core , from an early _ shock phase _ to a _",
    "collapse phase _ ?",
    "the integration of the stokes parameters along different lines of sight shows that the @xmath5@xmath7 plot of the core c3 depends on the direction of the line of sight . along certain directions @xmath5 and @xmath7 are virtually uncorrelated ; along others @xmath5 decreases with increasing @xmath7 because the magnetic field is roughly parallel to the line of sight towards the center of the core , or because of a cancellation effect due to the direction of polarization within material in front of the core .",
    "the @xmath5@xmath7 plot is therefore sensitive to the viewing angle , and is not a diagnostic for the evolutionary state of the cores ( at least with the present numerical resolution that allows only the description of the very early phase of the core collapse ) .",
    "the situation is different when grains are assumed to be aligned only at visual extinction below @xmath2  mag , as in model @xmath1 .",

    "is always found , since at visual extinction above @xmath2  mag the dust contributes to the continuum intensity @xmath7 , but not to the polarized flux ( @xmath5 is defined as the ratio of polarized and total flux eq . ( [ pdef ] ) ) .",
    "the direction of polarization is also affected by the lack of alignement of grains at large visual extinction . as an example",
    ", the region at the south of the core c2 shows a magnetic field direction roughly parallel to the elongation of the core in model @xmath0 , while the magnetic field direction is almost perpendicular to the core elongation in model @xmath1 .",
    "figure  7 shows the @xmath5@xmath7 plots for the core c1 seen from three different orthogonal directions , in model @xmath0 ( left panels ) and @xmath1 ( right panels ) .",
    "these plots show that @xmath5 always decreases with increasing @xmath7 in model @xmath1 , independent of the viewing angle .",
    "the histograms of the polarization angle @xmath63 in the maps of figure  5 are plotted in figure  8 . for computing these histograms",
    "we have used all the polarization vectors available , that is one per computational cell .",
    "since the maps are made of @xmath103 pixels , we have used 400 polarization vectors for each histogram , while in figures  4 and 5 only @xmath104 vectors were used for clarity .",
    "the plots in figure  7 show very broad distributions of @xmath63 .",
    "the values of @xmath63 are limited to the interval @xmath105 $ ] , but the reference direction , or the origin of the interval , can be shifted arbitrarily by an amount between 0 and @xmath106 .",
    "we have done so in order to minimize the dispersion of @xmath63 , which is obtained by shifting the origin of the angle to the approximate location of the minimum in the histogram . in this way",
    "the dispersion @xmath107 has a robust physical meaning , indipendent of the particular local orientation of the average magnetic field relative to the north .",
    "no gaussian fit of the histogram is attempted , and @xmath107 is simply defined as @xmath108 with the values of @xmath63 defined in the interval that minimizes this expression , as explained above .",

    "they are very similar to the @xmath5@xmath7 plots from our model @xmath1 , presented in the previous section .",
    "the upper envelope of the plots is defined by values of @xmath5 from 1 - 2% at the highest @xmath7 , to 8 - 10% at the lowest values of @xmath7 .",
    "the drop in @xmath5 is roughly consistent with a constant polarized flux , where the polarized flux is defined as @xmath110 .",
    "this suggests that a significant fraction of the dust emission is from grains that do not contribute significantly to the polarization , presumably unaligned grains .",
    "model @xmath0 can not reproduce the same result for all cores , but only in some cases due to the fortuitous orientation of the magnetic field or to a cancellation effect also dependent on the orientation of the core relative to the line of sight .",
    "it is possible that a numerical simulation with higher resolution , able to follow the collapse of cores to larger densities , may generate a stronger cancellation effect .",
    "the gravitational collapse is expected to drag the lines of force of the magnetic field towards the core center , which could generate a cancellation effect .",
    "however , it is not clear how important this effect may be , once diluted over the size of the telescope beam .",

    "we can define a coefficient @xmath113 that quantifies the deviation from the prediction of the linear theory : @xmath114 where the numerator is the rms alfvn velocity , averaged inside the volume under study .",

    "this method was further discussed by zweibel ( 1990 ) and myers & goodman ( 1991 ) .",
    "it has also been tested on the results of mhd simulations of sub  alfvnic turbulence by ostriker , stone & gammie ( 2001 ) .",
    "they find that for small dispersion of the polarization angle ( @xmath116 radians ) the chandrasekhar  fermi formula provides a good estimate of the plane of the sky field strength , if a coefficient @xmath117 is used .",
    "similar results are found by heitsch et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , using numerical simulations of mildly super  alfvnic turbulence .    in protostellar cores and",
    "bok globules the dispersion of the polarization angle is sometimes very large , and the chandrasekhar  fermi formula is not expected to hold . however , the formula is sometimes applied irrespective of the large value of @xmath107 ( eg itoh et al .",
    "1999 ; davis et al .",
    "2000 ; henning et al .",
    "this is perhaps justified by the expectation that the degree of topological complexity of the magnetic field , and so the value of @xmath107 , should be related in some way to the rms alfvnic mach number @xmath22 .",
    "a full numerical study of the dependence of @xmath107 on @xmath22 can be pursued with the mhd turbulence simulations , and will be presented elsewhere . for the purpose of this work we test the chandrasekhar  fermi formula on the cores c1 , c2 and c3 , and provide the values of the corresponding correction factor @xmath113 .    the turbulent velocity dispersion in protostellar cores and bok globules",
    "is often estimated using the line width of the cs molecule .",
    "it is possible that the bulk of the cs emission come from an envelope around the core , and not from the core interior , where most of the dust emission is generated , at least for the densest cores .",
