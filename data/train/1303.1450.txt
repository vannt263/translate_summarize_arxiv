    "the in - spiral and coalescence of binary neutron star systems is a topic of increasingly intensive research in observational and theoretical astrophysics .",
    "it is anticipated that the first direct detections of gravitational wave ( gw ) will be from compact binary mergers .",
    "binary neutron star ( bns ) mergers are also thought to produce short - hard gamma - ray bursts ( sgrb s ) @xcite .",
    "simultaneous detections of a prompt gravitational wave signal with a spatially coincident electromagnetic ( em ) counterpart dramatically increases the potential science return of the discovery .",
    "for this reason , there has been considerable interest as to which , if any , detectable em signature may result from the merger @xcite .",
    "other than sgrbs and their afterglows , including those viewed off - axis @xcite , suggestions include optical afterglows associated with the radio - active decay of tidally expelled r - process material@xcite ( though detailed calculations indicate they are faint @xcite ) , radio afterglows following the interaction of a mildly relativistic shell with the interstellar medium @xcite , and high - energy pre - merger emission from resistive magnetosphere interactions @xcite .",
    "merging neutron stars possess abundant orbital kinetic energy ( @xmath4ergs ) .",
    "a fraction of this energy is certain to be channelled through a turbulent cascade triggered by hydrodynamical instabilities during merger .",
    "turbulence is known to amplify magnetic fields by stretching and folding embedded field lines in a process known as the small - scale turbulent dynamo @xcite .",
    "amplification stops when the magnetic energy grows to equipartition with the energy containing turbulent eddies @xcite .",
    "an order of magnitude estimate of the magnetic energy available at saturation of the dynamo can be informed by global merger simulations .",
    "these studies indicate the presence of turbulence following the nonlinear saturation of the kelvin - helmholtz ( kh ) instability activated by shearing at the ns surface layers @xcite .",
    "the largest eddies produced are on the @xmath5 km scale and rotate at @xmath6 , setting the cascade time @xmath7 and kinetic energy injection rate @xmath8 at @xmath9ms and @xmath10 respectively .",
    "when kinetic equipartition is reached , each turbulent eddy contains @xmath11 of magnetic energy , and a mean magnetic field strength @xmath12    whether such conditions are realized in merging neutron star systems depends upon the dynamo saturation time @xmath13 and equipartition level @xmath14 . in particular , if @xmath15 then turbulent volumes of neutron star material will contain magnetar - level fields throughout the early merger phase .",
    "once saturation is reached , a substantial fraction of the injected kinetic energy , @xmath16 , is resistively dissipated @xcite at small scales . magnetic energy dissipated by reconnection in optically thin surface layers",
    "will accelerate relativistic electrons @xcite , potentially yielding an observable electromagnetic counterpart , independently of whether the merger eventually forms a relativistic outflow capable of powering a short gamma - ray burst .    in this letter",
    "we demonstrate that the small - scale turbulent dynamo saturates quickly , on a time @xmath15 , and that @xmath17 g magnetic fields are present throughout the early merger phase .",
    "this implies that the magnetic energy budget of merging binary neutron stars is controlled by the rate with which hydrodynamical instabilities randomize the orbital kinetic energy .",
    "our results are derived from simulations of the small scale turbulent dynamo operating in the high - density , trans - relativistic , and highly conductive material present in merging neutron stars .",
    "we have carefully examined the approach to numerical convergence and report grid resolution criteria sufficient to resolve aspects of the small - scale dynamo .",
    "our letter is organized as follows .",
    "the numerical setup is briefly described in section 2 .",
    "section 3 reports the resolution criterion for numerical convergence of the dynamo completion time and the saturated field strength . in section 4",
    "we asses the possibility that magnetic reconnection events may convert a sufficiently large fraction of the magnetic energy into high energy photons to yield a prompt electromagnetic counterpart detectable by high energy observatories including _ swift _ and _ fermi_.     and @xmath18 .",
    "lower resolutions are shown in red and graduate to black with higher resolution .",
    "_ top _ : the root mean square magnetic field strength in units of @xmath19 . when a turbulent volume is resolved by @xmath20 zones , the small - scale dynamo proceeds so slowly that almost no amplification is observed in the first 1ms .",
    "_ middle _ : the magnetic energy in units of the rest mass @xmath21 shown on logarithmic axes .",
    "it is clear that the linear growth rate increases at each resolution . _",
    "bottom _ : the kinetic energy ( upper curves ) shown again the magnetic energy ( lower curves ) again in units of @xmath21 .",
    "for all resolutions , the kinetic energy saturates in less than 1 @xmath7.,width=326 ]",
    "the equations of ideal relativistic magnetohydrodynamics ( rmhd ) have been solved on the periodic unit cube with resolutions between @xmath20 and @xmath18 .",
    "[ eqn : rmhd - system ] @xmath22    here , @xmath23 is the magnetic field four - vector , and @xmath24 is the total specific enthalpy , where @xmath25 is the total pressure , @xmath26 is the gas pressure and @xmath27 is the specific internal energy .",
    "the source term @xmath28 includes injection of energy and momentum at the large scales and the subtraction of internal energy ( with parameter @xmath29mev ) to permit stationary evolution .",
    "vortical modes at @xmath30 are forced by the four - acceleration field @xmath31 which smoothly decorrelates over a large - eddy turnover time , as described in @xcite .",
    "we have employed a realistic micro - physical equation of state ( eos ) appropriate for the conditions of merging neutron stars .",
    "it includes contributions from high - density nucleons according a relativistic mean field model @xcite , a relativistic and degenerate electron - positron component , neutrino and anti - neutrino pairs in beta equilibrium with the nucleons , and radiation pressure . for our conditions ,",
    "all the components make comparable contributions to the pressure . we have also employed a simpler gamma - law eos and found close agreement for the conditions explored in this paper , indicating that the mhd effects are insensitive the eos for trans - sonic conditions .",
    "the models presented in our resolution study use the far less expensive gamma - law equation of state .",
    "all of the simulations presented in this study use the hlld approximate riemann solver @xcite , which has been demonstrated as crucial in providing the correct spatial distribution of magnetic energy in mhd turbulence @xcite .",
    "the solution is advanced with an unsplit , second - order muscl - hancock scheme .",
    "spatial reconstruction is accomplished with the piecewise linear method configured to yield the smallest possible degree of numerical dissipation .",
    "the divergence constraint on the magnetic field is maintained to machine precision at cell corners using the finite volume ct method of @xcite .",
    "full details of the numerical scheme may be found in @xcite .",
    "magnetic fields are amplified in our simulations by the small - scale turbulent dynamo .",
    "turbulent fluid motions stretch and fold the magnetic field lines , causing exponential growth of magnetic energy ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this growth is attributed to the advection and diffusion of @xmath32 through the mhd induction equation ( eq . [ eqn : rmhd - system]c ) .",
    "when the magnetic field is weak ( @xmath33 ) @xmath32 evolves passively , and the turbulence is hydrodynamical .",
    "this limit is referred to as small - scale kinematic turbulent dynamo , and is well described by kazentzev s model @xcite .",
    "this model predicts that the power spectrum of magnetic energy peaks at the resistive scale @xmath34 and obeys a power law @xmath35 at longer wavelengths .",
    "the kinematic phase ends when the magnetic field acquires sufficient tension to modify the hydrodynamic motions , after which time a dynamical balance between kinetic and magnetic energy is established .",
    "numerical simulations of mhd turbulence are typically limited to magnetic prandtl numbers @xmath36 .",
    "however , neutron star material is characterized by @xmath37 , with the viscous cutoff due to neutrino diffusion occurring at around 10 cm , while the resistive scale is significantly smaller @xcite .",
    "however , the disparity between true and simulated magnetic prandlt number does not influence our conclusions .",
    "this is because dynamos are generically easier to establish in the high pm regime than the small @xcite .",
    ", together with the empirical model ( equation [ eqn : magnetic - fit ] ) with best - fit parameters .",
    "the horizontal dashed line indicates the magnetic energy , @xmath38 at the dynamo completion . from left to right , the vertical dashed lines mark the end of the startup , kinematic , and saturation phases.,width=326 ]    we use an initially uniform , pulsar - level ( @xmath39 g ) seed magnetic field .",
    "this field is sub - dominant to the kinetic energy by 10 orders of magnitude , so that the initial field amplification is expected to be well - described by kazentsev s model .",
    "indeed , we find that during this phase the power spectrum of magnetic energy follows @xmath35 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pspec - time - devel - res ] ) , peaking at around 10 grid zones , which we identify as the effective scale of resistivity .",
    "the saturation process begins at ever - earlier times with increasing numerical resolution .",
    "this reflects the fact that during the kinematic phase , magnetic energy exponentiates on a time scale controlled by shearing at the smallest scales . in numerically converged runs ,",
    "full saturation occurs with @xmath40 and is characterized by scale - by - scale super - equipartition , with @xmath41 at all but the largest scale .",
    "the same driven turbulence model was run through magnetic saturation at resolutions @xmath20 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 .",
    "another model at @xmath18 was run through the end of the kinematic phase , but further evolution was computationally prohibitive .",
    "[ fig : energy - growth ] shows the development of @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 as a function of time at each resolution .",

    "all models with resolutions @xmath52 eventually attain mean fields of @xmath53 g .",
    "the saturated field strength increases until resolution @xmath45 .",
    "we find that the kinematic growth rate is higher at each higher resolution , while the time - scale for the non - linear saturation converges at @xmath45 to roughly five large - eddy rotation times , or about 0.5ms for the physical parameters of binary neutron star mergers .",

    "this is consistent with the value of @xmath71 expected if the dynamo time is controlled by shearing at the smallest scale , the cascade is kolmogorov ( i.e. @xmath72 ) , and the viscous cutoff @xmath73 occurs at a fixed number of grid zones . in that case ,",

    "figure [ fig : pspec - time - devel - res ] shows the power spectrum of kinetic and magnetic energy at various times throughout the growth and saturation of magnetic field . during the kinematic phase ,",
    "the kinetic energy has a power spectrum @xmath84 consistent with the kolmogorov theory for incompressible hydrodynamical turbulence , while @xmath85 consistent with kazenstev s model .",
    "@xmath86 maintains the same shape , but exponentiates in amplitude at the time scale @xmath56 which is controlled by shearing at the resistive scale .",
    "according to kazentsev s model , @xmath86 should peak at the resistive scale .",
    "this is consistent with the observed peak in the magnetic energy at roughly 10 grid zones , the same scale at which we observe the viscous cutoff .",
    "this is also consistent with @xmath87 expected from the numerical scheme employed .",
    "when the magnetic energy at the resistive scale surpasses the level of the kinetic energy at that scale , @xmath86 changes shape .",
    "the equipartition scale @xmath88 moves into the inertial range , and migrates to larger scale until full saturation occurs with @xmath89 .",
    "the movement of @xmath88 to larger scale is associated with the formation of coherent and dynamically substantial magnetic structures of increasing size .",
    "the time - dependence has been suggested to be @xmath90 @xcite . in the fully saturated state ,",
    "the magnetic field is in scale - by - scale super - kinetic equipartition throughout the inertial range , with @xmath91 .",
    "the largest scales remain kinetically dominated so that the numerically converged saturation level is @xmath92 .",
    "in this letter we have determined the time scale and saturation level of the small - scale turbulent dynamo operating in the conditions of binary neutron star mergers .",
    "we have presented numerically converged simulations showing that magnetic fields are amplified to the @xmath93 g level within a small fraction of the merger dynamical time ( @xmath15 ) , independently of the seed field strength . if hydrodynamical instabilities create fluctuating velocities on the order of @xmath94 as indicated by global simulations , then each @xmath95 turbulent volume dissipates @xmath96 erg of magnetic energy per 0.1 ms .",
    "if @xmath97 represents the fraction of the merger remnant that contains such turbulence , the magnetic energy dissipated during the merger is at least @xmath98    a fraction of that dissipation will occur through magnetic reconnection in optically thin surface layers , supplying relativistic electrons which synchrotron radiate in the merger remnant magnetosphere .",
    "if 5% of that magnetic energy dissipation creates radiation in the 15 - 150 kev band , then the fluence at 200 mpc would be @xmath3 , potentially rendering most merging neutron stars in the advanced ligo and virgo detection volumes detectable by _ swift _ bat .",
    "if so , then merging neutron stars are accompanied by a prompt electromagnetic counterpart , independently of whether a later merger phase yields a collimated outflow capable of powering a short gamma - ray burst .",
    "we suggest that merger flares may be present in the current sample of short grbs and may be roughly isotropic on the sky since they are seen to distances where the cosmological matter distribution becomes homogeneous .",
    "searches for merger flares should seek to identify short flares , not unlike soft - gamma repeaters , among the short burst population . if mergers also produce short grbs short - hard grbs , then merger flares may constitute a precursor component of the emission .",
    "the presence of strong magnetic fields may also aid in the ejection of neutron - rich material from surface layers of the merger remnant , possibly enhancing the enrichment of inter - stellar medium by r - process nuclei @xcite .",
    "enhanced production of r - process nuclei also increases the likelihood of em detection by radio - active decay powered afterglows , or `` kilonovae '' @xcite .",
    "finally , it has been shown that magnetic fields will significantly influence the gravitational wave signature and remnant disk mass , if they exist at the @xmath99 g level @xcite .",
    "such strong fields are unlikely in older neutron star binaries , but our results suggest they may be revived , albeit at small scales , during the merger . to have significant influence , those fields would have to fill a considerable fraction of the merger volume .",
    "as we have shown in this letter , the overall magnetic energy budget is controlled by the prevalence ( @xmath97 ) and vigor ( @xmath100 ) of the turbulent volumes .",
    "this fact motivates the use of higher resolution global simulations aimed at measuring @xmath97 and @xmath100 .",
