    "a certain portion of the solar surface is covered by the coronal holes .",
    "their characteristic features are that the open magnetic fields are emanating into the interplanetary space and the hot plasma is streaming out .",
    "the high speed solar winds ( 800km / s at @xmath5au ) are accelerated from the polar coronal holes which stably exists except during the solar maximum phase @xcite the source of the energy for heating and accelerating the plasma is believed to be in the surface convection ; this energy is lifted up through the magnetic fields and its dissipation results in the plasma heating . in this sense ,",
    "the problem of the coronal heating and the solar wind acceleration is to solve how the solar atmosphere reacts to the footpoint motions of the magnetic fields .    in the coronal holes the waves can play an important role because it can travel a long distance to both heat the corona and",
    "accelerate the solar wind .",
    "the waves are excited by steady transverse motions of the field lines at the photosphere ( e.g. cranmer & van ballegooijen 2005 ) , while they can also be produced by reconnection events above the photosphere @xcite .",
    "although the latter process might be responsible for the generation of the high - frequency ( up to @xmath0hz ) ioncyclotron wave highlighted for the heating of the heavy ions @xcite , it is difficult to heat the protons @xcite .",
    "because we focus on the heating of the major component of the plasma , we study the effect of the low - frequency ( @xmath6hz ) waves generated by the steady footpoint fluctuations .",
    "although the waves have been intensively investigated , previous studies have a couple of limitations .",
    "most of the calculations consider the waves from the fixed ` coronal base ' of which density is @xmath7 orders of magnitudes lower than that of the photosphere ( e.g. oughton et al.2001 ; ofman 2004 ) .",
    "however , the corona dynamically interact with the chromosphere by chromospheric evaporation @xcite and wave transmission @xcite so that the coronal base varies time - dependently . some calculations including",
    "the chromosphere even adopt an ad hoc heating function ( e.g. lie - svendsen 2002 ) .",
    "in contrast , we self - consistently treat the transfer of the mass / momentum / energy by solving the wave propagation from the photosphere to the interplanetary region .",
    "our aim is to answer the problem of the heating and acceleration in the coronal holes by the _ forward _",
    "approach @xcite .",
    "we consider one - dimensional ( 1-d ) super - radially open flux tube , measured by heliocentric distance , @xmath8 .",
    "the computation domain is from the photosphere ( @xmath9 ) with density , @xmath10 g @xmath11 , to @xmath12 ( 0.3au ) , where @xmath13 is solar radius .",
    "radial field strength , @xmath14 , is given by conservation of magnetic flux as @xmath15 where we adopt the same function as in @xcite for superradial expansion , @xmath16 , but consider two - step expansions : the flux tube initially expands by a factor of 30 at @xmath17 corresponding to ` funnel ' structure @xcite , and followed by 2.5 times expansion at @xmath18 due to the large scale magnetic fields .",
    "@xmath14 at the photosphere is set to be 161 g .",
    "these give @xmath19 g at @xmath20 ( low corona ) , and @xmath21 in @xmath22 .",
    "we give transverse fluctuations of the field line by the granulations at the photosphere , which excite waves .",
    "we consider the fluctuations with power spectrum , @xmath23 , in frequency between @xmath24hz ( period of 20 seconds  30 minutes ) , and root mean squared ( rms ) average amplitude @xmath25km / s corresponding to observed velocity amplitude @xmath26km / s @xcite . at the outer boundary",
    ", outgoing condition is imposed for all the mhd waves ( suzuki & inutsuka 2005 ) to avoid the unphysical wave reflection .",
    "we treat the dynamical evolution of the waves and the plasma by solving ideal mhd equations with the relevant physical processes : @xmath27 @xmath28 @xmath29 @xmath30 @xmath31 @xmath32 +   \\frac{1}{r^2 f}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}(r^2 f f_{\\rm c } )   + q_{\\rm r } = 0,\\ ] ] @xmath33,\\ ] ] where @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 are density , velocity , pressure , specific energy , and magnetic field strength , respectively , and subscript @xmath8 and @xmath39 denote radial and tangential components . @xmath40 and @xmath41 denote lagrangian and eulerian derivatives , respectively . @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the gravitational constant and the solar mass .",
    "@xmath44 is thermal conductive flux and @xmath45 is radiative cooling @xcite .",
    "note that the curvature effects appear as @xmath46 terms , instead of @xmath8 for the usual spherical coordinate .",
    "we adopt 2nd - order mhd - godunov - mocct scheme for updating the physical quantities ( sano & inutsuka 2005 ) , of which an advantage is that no artificial viscosity is required even for strong mhd shocks .",
    "we fix 14000 grid points with variable sizes in a way to resolve waves with @xmath47hz by at least @xmath48 grids per wavelength to reduce the numerical damping .",
    "the advantages of our calculations are automatic treatments of the wave propagation / dissipation and the plasma heating / acceleration without an ad hoc heating function but with the minimal assumption over the broadest regions with the huge density contrast .",
    "we emphasize that this is one of the most self - consistent simulations for the solar wind acceleration at present .",
    "the disadvantage is the 1-d mhd approximation , which will be discussed later .",
    "we start the calculation from the static and cool atmosphere with temperature , @xmath49k ; we do not set up the corona and the solar wind at the beginning .",
    "figure 1 ( on - line movie available ) shows how the coronal heating and the solar wind acceleration are realized by the low - frequency waves .",
    "we plot @xmath50(km / s ) , @xmath51(k ) , @xmath34(g/@xmath52 ) , and @xmath53(km / s ) averaged from @xmath54 as a function of @xmath55 at different time , @xmath56 & 2573 minutes .",
    "as time goes on , the atmosphere is heated and accelerated effectively by the dissipation of the waves .",
    "temperature rises rapidly in the inner region even at @xmath57 minutes , and the outer region is eventually heated up by both outward thermal conduction and wave dissipation . once the plasma is heated up to the coronal temperature , mass is supplied to the corona mainly by the chromospheric evaporation due to the downward thermal conduction .",
    "this is seen in temperature structure as an inward shift of the transition region , which is finally located around @xmath58 ( @xmath594000 km ) . as a result , the coronal density increases by two orders of magnitude . while the wind velocity exceeds 1000km / s at @xmath60 minutes on account of the initial low density , it gradually settles down to @xmath61 km / s as the density increases .",
    "@xmath53 also settles down to the reasonable value at the final stage .",
    "we have found that the plasma is steadily heated up to @xmath3k in the corona and flows out as a transonic wind with @xmath62km / s at the outer boundary ( @xmath630.3au ) when the quasi steady - state behaviors are achieved after @xmath64 minutes .",
    "this is the first numerical simulation which directly shows that the heated plasma actually flows out as the transonic wind , from the initially static and cool atmosphere , by the effects of the waves .",
    "the sonic point where @xmath50 exceeds the local sound speed , @xmath65 , is located at @xmath66 and the point for the speed , @xmath67 , is at @xmath68 .",
    "the obtained proton flux at 0.3au is @xmath69(@xmath70s@xmath71 ) , corresponding to @xmath72(@xmath70s@xmath71 ) at 1au for @xmath73 , which is consistent with the observed high - speed stream around the earth @xcite .    in fig.2",
    "we compare the result at @xmath74 minutes with recent observation in the high - speed solar winds from the polar regions by solar & heliospheric observatory ( soho ) @xcite and interplanetary scintillation ( ips ) measurements @xcite .",
    "the figure shows that our _ forward_-approach simulation naturally form the corona and the high - speed solar wind which are observed by the dissipation of the low - frequency waves .",
    "although the observed wind speed around @xmath75 @xcite appears to exceed our result , it might reflect the wave phenomena in the solar wind rather than the outflow @xcite .",
    "figure 3 presents the dissipation of the waves .",
    "the top panel plots the following quantities , @xmath76 for outgoing , incoming , and outgoing slow mhd ( sound ) waves , where @xmath77 and @xmath78 are amplitude and phase speed of each wave mode , and @xmath79 s are normalized at @xmath80 .",
    "@xmath79 is an adiabatic constant derived from wave action @xcite , and corresponds to the energy flux in static media .",
    "@xmath79 is conserved in the expanding atmosphere if the wave does not dissipate , while it is not the case for the energy flux . for the incoming wave in figure 3",
    ", we plot the opposite sign of @xmath79 so that it becomes positive in the sub - region .",
    "the outgoing and incoming waves are decomposed by correlation between @xmath54 and @xmath81 .",
    "extraction of the slow wave is also from fluctuating components of @xmath50 and @xmath34 .",
    "the bottom panel plots @xmath82 , @xmath83 , and @xmath84 , where @xmath85 and @xmath86 are amplitudes of the outgoing and slow modes .",
    "all the quantities in figure 3 are time - averaged over 30 minutes to smooth out the variation due to the phase .",
    "the top panel shows that the outgoing waves dissipate quite effectively ; @xmath79 becomes only @xmath87 of the initial value at the outer boundary .",
    "first , a sizable amount is reflected back downward below the coronal base ( @xmath88 ) , which is clearly illustrated as the incoming wave following the outgoing component with slightly smaller level .",
    "this is because the wave shape is considerably deformed owing to the steep density gradient ; a typical variation scale ( @xmath89 km ) of the speed becomes comparable to or even shorter than the wavelength ( @xmath90 km ) .",
    "although the energy flux , @xmath91erg @xmath70s@xmath71 , of the outgoing waves ( @xmath79 in the static region is equivalent with the energy flux ) which penetrates into the corona is only @xmath92% of the input value , it satisfies the requirement for the energy budget in the coronal holes @xcite .",
    "second , slow mhd waves are generated in the corona ( see sakurai 2002 for observation ) as shown in the figure .",
    "the amplitude of the waves is amplified through the upward propagation .",
    "the bottom panel shows that @xmath93 in @xmath94 , which means that the wave pressure ( @xmath95 ) exceeds the gas pressure ( eq.[[eq : mom ] ] ) in spite of the weak nonlinearity , @xmath96 .",
    "this excites longitudinal slow waves @xcite , which eventually become nonlinear @xmath97 at @xmath98 to lead to the shock dissipation @xcite . the coronal heating and wind acceleration are thus achieved by transferring the energy and momentum flux of the outgoing waves .",
    "fast mhd shocks by the direct steepening of the linearly polarized components of the waves also contribute to the heating @xcite , though they are less efficient because of the weak nonlinearity .",
    "the incoming waves are generated in the corona by the reflection of the outgoing ones by the density fluctuations due to the slow waves .",
    "the reflected waves further play a role in the wave dissipation by nonlinear wave - wave interaction .",
    "a key mechanism in the heating and acceleration of the plasma is the generation of the slow mhd waves .",
    "thus , one of the predictions from our simulation is the existence of the longitudinal fluctuations in the solar wind plasma .",
    "this is directly testable by in situ measurements of future missions , solar orbiter and solar probe , which will approach to @xmath9945 and 4 @xmath13 , respectively , corresponding to the inside of our computation domain .",
    "we have shown by the self - consistent simulation that the dissipation of the low - frequency waves through the generation of the compressive waves and shocks is one of the solutions for the heating and acceleration of the plasma in the coronal holes . however , the validity of the 1-d mhd approximation we have adopted needs to be examined .",
    "generally , the shock dissipation tends to be overestimated in the 1-d simulation because the shocks can not be diluted by the geometrical expansion . on the other hand ,",
    "there are other dissipation mechanisms due to the multidimensionality @xcite , such as turbulent cascade into the transverse direction @xcite and phase mixing @xcite .",
    "therefore , the waves might also be dissipated by paths different from the shocks in the real situations .",
    "the self - consistent simulations including these various processes remain to be done to give the final conclusion .",
