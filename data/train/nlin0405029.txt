    "in this work we study rotating waves in rings of neurons described by the theta model . the theta model @xcite , which is derived as a canonical model for neurons near a ` saddle - node on a limit cycle ' bifurcation , assumes the state of the neuron is given by an angle @xmath0 , with @xmath1 , @xmath2 corresponding to the ` firing ' state , and the dynamics described by @xmath3 where @xmath4 represents the inputs to the neuron . when @xmath5 this represents an ` excitable ' neuron , which in the absence of external input ( @xmath6 ) approaches a rest state , while if @xmath7 this represents an ` oscillatory ' neuron which performs spontaneous oscillations in the absence of external input .",

    "( [ de ] ) says that the neurons are modelled as theta - neurons , where the input @xmath18 to the neuron at @xmath16 , as in ( [ thn ] ) , is given by @xmath19 @xmath20 ( here assumed to be positive ) describes the relative strength of the synaptic coupling from the neuron at @xmath16 to the neuron at @xmath21 , while @xmath22 is a parameter measuring the overall coupling strength .",
    "the above model , in the case @xmath23 , is the one presented in @xcite . in the case @xmath24 this model is the one presented in @xcite ( remark 2 ) and @xcite .",
    "we always assume @xmath25 .    when the geometry is linear , @xmath26 , it is natural to seek travelling waves of activity along the line in which each neuron makes one or more oscillations and then approaches rest .",
    "in @xcite it was proven that for sufficiently strong synaptic coupling @xmath27 , at least two such waves , a slow and a fast one , exist , and also that they always involve each neuron firing more than one time before it approaches rest , while for sufficiently small @xmath27 such waves do not exist .",
    "it was not determined how many times each neuron fires before coming to rest , and it may even be that each neuron fires infinitely many times .",
    "some numerical results in the case of a one and a two - dimensional geometry were obtained in @xcite .    in this work",
    "we consider a different possibility for the spacial geometry : @xmath28 , so the neurons are placed on a ring and our equations are ( [ syn ] ) and @xmath29 with @xmath30 where @xmath11 is continuous , positive and periodic @xmath31 @xmath32 and the solutions satisfy the periodicity conditions @xmath33 @xmath34 the integer @xmath35 ( the ` winding number ' ) is determined by the initial condition @xmath36 , and will be preserved as long as the solution remains continuous .    in this geometry ,",
    "a different kind of wave of activity is possible : a wave that rotates around the ring repeatedly .",
    "such waves , that is solutions of the form : @xmath37 @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the wave velocity , are the focus of our investigation .    in section [ pre ]",
    "we show that in the case that the winding number @xmath40 , there can exist only trivial rotating waves .",
    "thus the interesting cases are when @xmath41 . here",
    "we study the case @xmath42 , the case @xmath43 being beyond our reach .",
    "thus , this work concentrates on the first non - trivial case .",
    "our central results about existence , nonexistence and multiplicity of rotating waves can be summarized as follows ( see figures [ syn1],[syn2 ] for the _ simplest _ diagrams consistent with these results ) :    [ sum ] consider the equations ( [ ge]),([syn ] ) with conditions ( [ bnt ] ) , ( [ bns ] ) , and @xmath42 .",
    "\\(i ) in the oscillatory case @xmath7 : for all @xmath22 there exists a rotating wave , with velocity going to @xmath44 as @xmath45 .",
    "\\(ii ) in the excitable case @xmath5 :    \\(i ) for @xmath22 sufficiently small there exist no rotating waves .",
    "\\(ii ) for @xmath27 sufficiently large there exist at least two rotating waves , a ` fast ' and a ` slow ' one , in the sense that their velocities approach @xmath44 and @xmath46 , respectively , as @xmath47 .    therefore our results bear resemblance to those obtained in @xcite for the case of a linear geometry .",
    "we note that although for the rotating waves found here each neuron fires infinitely many times , the reason for this is that it is re - excited each time , because of the periodic geometry . during each revolution of the rotating wave ,",
    "each neuron fires once , so naively one could think that the analogous phenomenon in a linear geometry would be a travelling wave with each neuron firing once - but this was shown to be impossible in @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that while in @xcite some restrictions were made on the coupling function @xmath11 , like being decreasing with distance , here no such restrictions are imposed beyond ( [ jpos ] ) , ( [ jper ] ) .",
    "we would expect however that some restriction would need to be imposed on @xmath11 in order to obtain stability of travelling waves .",
    "the whole issue of stability remains quite open and awaits future investigation . in the case",
    "@xmath26 , both numerical evidence in @xcite and results obtained in other models @xcite indicate that the fast wave is stable while the slow wave is unstable , so we might conjecture that this is true for the case investigated here as well - at least under some natural assumptions on @xmath11 .",
    "some analytical progress on the stability question in the case @xmath26 has recently been achieved in @xcite .",
    "let us note that the model considered here , in the case @xmath5 , describes waves in an excitable medium , about which an extensive literature exists ( see @xcite and references therein ) . however , most models consider diffusive rather than synaptic coupling . in the case of the theta model on a ring , with _ diffusive _ coupling , and @xmath42 , it is proven in @xcite that a rotating wave exists regardless of the strength of coupling ( _ i.e. _ the diffusion coefficient ) , so that our results highlight the difference between diffusive and synaptic coupling .    in section [ reduction ]",
    "we reduce the study of rotating waves to the investigation of the zeroes of a function of one variable . in section [ constant ]",
    "we investigate the special case in which the coupling is uniform ( @xmath48 is a constant function ) , which , although artificial from a biological point of view , allows us to obtain closed analytic expressions for the wave - velocity vs. coupling - strength curves in an elementary fashion .",
    "we can thus gain some intuition for the general case , and obtain information which is unavailable in the case of general @xmath11 , like precise multiplicity results .",
    "it is interesting to investigate to what extent the more precise results obtained in the uniform - coupling case extend to the general case , and we shall indicate several questions , which remain open , in this direction .",
    "in section [ general ] we turn to the case of general coupling functions @xmath11 , and prove the results of theorem [ sum ] above , obtaining also some quantitative estimates : lower and upper bounds for the critical values of synaptic coupling coupling strength @xmath27 , as well as for the wave velocities .",
    "we begin with an elementary calculus lemma which is useful in several of our arguments below .",
    "[ cut ] let @xmath49 be a differentiable function , and let @xmath50 , @xmath51 , be constants such that we have the following property : @xmath52 then the equation @xmath53 has at most one solution .    assume by way of contradiction that the equation @xmath53 has at least two solutions @xmath54 . define @xmath55 by @xmath56 @xmath57 is nonempty because @xmath58 .",
    "let @xmath59 .",
    "by continuity of @xmath60 we have @xmath61 .",
    "we have either @xmath62 or @xmath63 , and we shall show that both of these possibilities lead to contradictions . if @xmath62 , then by ( [ kp ] ) we have @xmath64 @xmath65 so we conclude that there exists @xmath66 with @xmath67 , contradicting the definition of @xmath68 . if @xmath63 then @xmath69 is a limit - point of @xmath57 , which implies that @xmath70 , contradicting ( [ kp ] ) .",
    "these contradictions conclude our proof .",
    "turning now to our investigation , we note a few properties of the functions @xmath71 and @xmath72 defined by ( [ spec ] ) which will be used often in our arguments : @xmath73 @xmath74 @xmath75 @xmath76    plugging ( [ tw1]),([tw2 ] ) into ( [ ge ] ) , ( [ syn ] ) , and setting @xmath77 we obtain the following equations for @xmath78 , @xmath79 : @xmath80 @xmath81 in order to satisfy the boundary conditions ( [ bnt]),([bns ] ) , @xmath82 and @xmath83 have to satisfy @xmath84",
    "let us first dispose of the case of zero - velocity waves , @xmath86 .",
    "we get the equations @xmath87",
    "@xmath88 if there exists some @xmath89 with @xmath90 , @xmath2 , then , substituting @xmath91 into ( [ teq00 ] ) and using ( [ hpi]),([wz ] ) , we obtain @xmath92 , a contradiction",
    ". hence we must have @xmath93 which implies that @xmath94 , so that ( [ req00 ] ) gives @xmath95 , and ( [ teq00 ] ) reduces to @xmath96 , and thus @xmath78 is a constant function , the constant being a root of @xmath71 .",
