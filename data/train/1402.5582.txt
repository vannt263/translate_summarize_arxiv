    "the invariant trace field is one of the most used tools in the study of hyperbolic manifolds from the number - theoretical point of view . in this note , we discuss how this arithmetic invariant is related to the intrinsic geometry of the manifold , and to intercusp geodesics in particular .",
    "this geometric perspective allows one to compute the invariant trace field of many hyperbolic link complements from their diagrams .",
    "@xmath2 will always denote a complete orientable hyperbolic @xmath3-manifold of finite volume .",
    "if @xmath4 is the image of a discrete faithful representation of the fundamental group of @xmath2 into @xmath5 , then @xmath2 can be regarded as the quotient @xmath6 . after picking upper half space",
    "coordinates @xmath7 on @xmath8 we can identify @xmath5 with @xmath9 acting so that its action on the sphere at infinity @xmath10 is by mbius transformations .",
    "this identification is only determined up to conjugacy , since it depends on the coordinate choice . nevertheless , for an element",
    "@xmath11 we can speak of the _ trace _ @xmath12 ( determined only up to sign ) , since the trace of a matrix is invariant under conjugacy .",
    "the field @xmath13 generated by the traces of elements of @xmath4 is called the _ trace field _ of @xmath2 . in view of the mostow - prasad rigidity",
    ", @xmath13 is a finite extension of @xmath14 ( the proof can be found in @xcite ) .",
    "it is an invariant of the group @xmath4 and thus is a topological invariant of the manifold , but in general it is not an invariant of its commensurability class in @xmath9 ( see @xcite for counterexamples ) .",
    "consider the subgroup @xmath15 of @xmath4 .",
    "the _ invariant trace field _ is the field generated over @xmath14 by the traces of @xmath16 .",
    "often denoted by @xmath17 or @xmath18 , the invariant trace field is a topological and commensurability invariant of the manifold ( @xcite ) .",
    "clearly , it is a subfield of the trace field .",
    "if @xmath2 is a link complement , it actually coincides with the trace field ( this was proven in @xcite for knots , and in @xcite for links ) .    in @xcite",
    ", it is shown that the invariant trace field contains useful geometric information about the hyperbolic manifold .",
    "in particular , if @xmath4 contains parabolic elements , the invariant trace field is equal to the field generated by shapes of all tetrahedra of any ideal triangulation of @xmath2 ( by `` shape '' of an ideal tetrahedron we mean the cross - ratio of the vertices as elements of @xmath10 ; it is determined up to a three - fold ambiguity , depending on an orientation - compatible choice of ordering of the vertices ) .",
    "here we show that the invariant trace field also contains certain complex `` intercusp parameters '' that measure distances and angles between cusps ( more precisely , between preimages in @xmath8 of cusp cross - sections ) , as well as `` translation parameters '' which measure displacement between ends of intercusp geodesic arcs .    with the ideas",
    "described in @xcite this enables one to compute generators of the invariant trace field of a hyperbolic link directly from a link diagram in many cases .",
    "for example , for @xmath19-bridge links , we demonstrate that a single intercusp parameter suffices , with a polynomial which can be constructed combinatorially from the diagram .",
    "previously known methods included finding decimal approximations of simplex shapes , and then making an intelligent guess of the corresponding polynomial for the field using the lll algorithm ( see @xcite ) .",
    "in this section , we assume our hyperbolic @xmath3-manifold @xmath2 has at least one cusp . we introduce a complex parameter that captures geometric information about distances and angles between preimages of cusp cross - sections in @xmath2 .",
    "later we will use it to compute invariant trace fields of links from their diagrams .",
    "the idea of such a parameter appeared in @xcite for intercusp geodesics that correspond to crossings of a link diagram . here",
    "we will consider it in a more general setting .",
    "our definition also dovetails with a notion of  complex length \" of a geodesic that was introduced in @xcite .",
    "we will speak loosely of the sphere at infinity as the `` boundary '' of @xmath8 .",
    "each horospherical cusp cross - section of @xmath2 is a torus which lifts to a set of horospheres tangent to the boundary of @xmath8 .",
    "the point of tangency of such a horosphere @xmath20 will be referred to as the center of @xmath20 and will be denoted by @xmath21 .    for each cusp of @xmath2",
    "we choose an essential simple closed curve in a horospherical section of the cusp , which we call the _ meridian_. ( if @xmath2 is the complement of an oriented link in @xmath22 we choose the standard meridians , which are oriented using the right hand screw rule . )",
    "henceforth we will assume that the horospherical torus cross - section of each cusp of @xmath2 has been chosen so that the ( geodesic ) meridian curve on this torus has length @xmath23 .",
    "such choice guarantees that the horoballs have disjoint interiors .",
    "the horoballs are in fact disjoint in every case except for the figure - eight knot complement in @xmath22 ( as was proved @xcite ) . for the figure - eight ,",
    "the corresponding cross - sectional torus touches itself in two points .    in the following we only consider horospheres in @xmath8 which are lifts of cusp cross - sections of @xmath2 as above .",
    "each such horosphere can be regarded as the complex plane , with coordinates specified ( up to translation ) by declaring that the meridional translation corresponds to the real number one .",
    "if we position @xmath20 to be the euclidean plane @xmath24 centered at @xmath25 ( which we denote by @xmath26 ) , then the meridional translation on @xmath20 is represented by the matrix @xmath27 . for convenience",
    "we will often abuse the distinction between @xmath28 and @xmath29 and simply work with matrices .",
    "since @xmath30 we sometimes use matrices in @xmath31 ( but note that the @xmath32 trace @xmath33 of such a matrix @xmath34 is @xmath35 ) .",
    "let @xmath36 be the shortest geodesic arc connecting two horospheres @xmath37 and @xmath38 in @xmath8 . if it has length @xmath39 , we can parallel translate along @xmath36 and then rotate by an angle @xmath40 in @xmath38 to take the meridional direction on @xmath37 to the the meridional direction on @xmath38 .",
    "we call the complex number @xmath41 the _ complex distance between @xmath37 and @xmath38 _ and we call @xmath42 the _ _ intercusp parameter__. fig .  [ fig : intercusp ] illustrates a complex intercusp distance with argument @xmath40 between @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "observe that if we position one of @xmath37 and @xmath38 as @xmath45 and the other with center at @xmath43 then the matrix @xmath46 exchanges @xmath37 and @xmath38 taking meridian direction of @xmath37 to that of @xmath38 .",
    "we will also use another complex parameter defined as follows .",
    "suppose we have three horospheres @xmath47 , and @xmath21 is the center of a horosphere @xmath20 for @xmath48 .",

    ". then the matrix @xmath55 gives a translation of @xmath38 taking @xmath51 to @xmath2 .",
    "we first give versions of theorems 4.1 and 4.2 of @xcite adapted to the orientation conventions of this paper , along with quick proofs of both .",

    "the shape parameter of the ideal simplex with vertices @xmath62 is @xmath63    as in @xcite we use the shape parameter given by the cross ratio @xmath64 which gives the parameter associated to the edge @xmath65 . in the literature",
    "this @xmath66 is often associated with the vertex ordering @xmath67 .",

    "apply the isometry given by @xmath68 which exchanges @xmath37 and @xmath38 , so now @xmath38 is positioned at @xmath45 with @xmath37 centered at @xmath43 .",
    "next apply @xmath69 which translates @xmath38 to move @xmath70 to have center @xmath43 .",
    "so now @xmath38 is positioned as @xmath45 and @xmath70 centered at @xmath43 .",
    "now repeat with @xmath71 followed by @xmath72 to get @xmath70 positioned as @xmath45 and @xmath73 centered at @xmath43 .",
    "after @xmath60 such steps we are back to the original positioning , so @xmath74 taking inverse of this equation ( and keeping in mind that @xmath75 is an involution ) gives the desired result .",
    "recall that indices are modulo @xmath60 .",
    "we take @xmath76 and set @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and we start with @xmath37 positioned as @xmath45 and @xmath38 centered at @xmath43 as before",
    ". then @xmath80 is centered at @xmath81 .",
    "apply @xmath68 . then the center of @xmath80 has been moved to @xmath82 , @xmath37 is centered at @xmath43 and @xmath38 is positioned as @xmath45 .",
    "now @xmath70 is centered at @xmath83 .",
    "taking the cross - ratio of @xmath84 gives the result .",
    "[ th:2.1 ] the intercusp parameters @xmath85 and the translation parameters @xmath86 lie in the invariant trace field @xmath18 .",
    "let @xmath87 be the set of all centers of horospheres which lift from cusp cross - sections of @xmath2 . in ( * ?",
    "* theorem 2.4 ) it is shown that if three points of @xmath87 are positioned at @xmath43 , @xmath23 and @xmath25 then @xmath87 is positioned as subset of @xmath88 .    to see @xmath89 we position @xmath90 as @xmath45 and @xmath20 with center at @xmath43 .",
    "then there is also a horosphere centered at @xmath23 so @xmath87 is positioned as a subset of @xmath91 .",
    "so @xmath92 is in @xmath18 .",
    "since shape parameters are also in @xmath18 , it now follows from theorem [ th : shape parameter ] applied to a simplex with vertices @xmath93 that @xmath85 is in @xmath18 .",
    "if the image @xmath94 in @xmath2 of an intercusp geodesic arc @xmath95 is embedded we call @xmath94 an _ intercusp arc _ of @xmath2 and if the line segment in an @xmath90 joining the endpoints of a @xmath95 and a @xmath96 has embedded image @xmath97 in @xmath2 we call @xmath97 a _ cusp arc _ of @xmath2 .    [ th:2.2 ] suppose @xmath98 is a union of cusp arcs and pairwise disjoint intercusp arcs , where any intercusp arcs which are not disjoint have been bent slightly near intersection points to make them disjoint , and suppose @xmath99 is surjective ( equivalently , the lift @xmath100 is connected ) . then the intercusp and translation parameters corresponding to these arcs generate the invariant trace field",
    ".    if @xmath0 is a field then the square of an element @xmath101 equals @xmath102 and hence has @xmath32 trace in @xmath0 .",
    "the conditions on @xmath103 imply that each covering transformation in @xmath4 of the covering map @xmath104 is a product of matrices of the form @xmath75 or @xmath105 .",
    "it is therefore in @xmath106 , so its square has psl trace in @xmath18 . by (",
    "* theorem 2.1 ) the traces of squares of elements of @xmath4 generate the invariant trace field .",
    "in @xcite christian zickert considers an ideal triangulation of @xmath2 with the simplices truncated by removing horoballs centered at the vertices of the ideal simplices .",
    "he allows horoballs of any size , but we will use the ones normalized as in section [ sec : params ] . he uses a labelling of these truncated simplices to give a particularly simple computation of the extended bloch class and complex volume of @xmath2 .",
    "the label @xmath107 on a long edge of a truncated tetrahedron of the triangulation ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : z ] ) is a matrix of the form @xmath108 and a label @xmath109 on a short edge has the form @xmath110 .",
    "note that @xmath108 can be written as @xmath111 .",
    "it is not hard to check that @xmath112 represents the intercusp parameter @xmath85 and @xmath83 represents the translation parameter @xmath86 , so with the horoballs chosen as in this paper , zickert s parameters give elements of the form @xmath113 and @xmath83 in @xmath18 .      in @xcite , a new method for computing hyperbolic structure of links is suggested .",
    "it parametrizes horoball structure using complex labels , which then can be found from a link diagram that satisfies a few mild restrictions .",
    "the method is based on ideal polygons corresponding to the regions of a link diagram rather than decomposition of the complement into ideal tetrahedra .",
    "we will proceed by defining the labels ; the method is described after that .",
    "suppose that @xmath2 is a link complement and that the link has a reduced diagram @xmath114 such that every arc from an overpass to an underpass of a crossing is properly homotopic to a geodesic in @xmath2 .",
    "conjecturally , every hyperbolic link admits such a diagram ; for now it has been proved that every hyperbolic alternating link does ( see @xcite for a discussion and for the sufficient conditions on checkerboard surfaces ) .",
    "existence of such a diagram for a link guarantees the applicability of the method .",
    "the boundary of a @xmath0-sided region @xmath115 of the diagram @xmath114 is a union of @xmath0 arcs on the boundary torus ( we call them _ edges of @xmath115 _ ) and @xmath0 arcs , each of which goes from an overpass to an underpass of a crossing .",
    "suppose @xmath116 is a preimage of @xmath115 in @xmath117 .",
    "then @xmath116 is a cyclic sequence of @xmath0 segments of geodesics connecting the ideal points @xmath118 in @xmath119 , and @xmath0 euclidean segments on the corresponding horospheres @xmath120 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : rp ] ) .",
    "each geodesic @xmath65 meets @xmath20 and @xmath121 in points @xmath122 and @xmath123 respectively .",
    "an orientation of the link determines a direction of the corresponding translation along the euclidean line segment on @xmath20 in @xmath117 joining @xmath122 with @xmath124 .",
    "the corresponding translation parameter ( @xmath125 or @xmath126 , depending on the orientation ) is called an _ edge label _ in @xcite and is affixed to the side of the corresponding edge of @xmath115 .",
    "a _ crossing label _",
    ", affixed to the crossing arc ( or just to the corresponding crossing ) that lifts to the geodesic @xmath65 , is the negative of the intercusp parameter @xmath127 .",
    "a set of equations for edge and crossing labels , used to compute the hyperbolic structure on the link complement , is given in @xcite .",
    "they consist of three equations resulting from the matrix relation equivalent to the one of theorem [ th : cycle relation ] for each @xmath116 , and , for each arc between two crossings of the link diagram , an equation relating the values of the two edge labels corresponding to the regions on the two sides of the arc ( for an alternating link the the equation just says that the two labels differ by 1 ) .",
    "to summarize , instead of the traditional gluing and completeness relations based on shape parameters for an ideal triangulation , we now use two types of complex parameters : the intercusp parameter @xmath127 describing distance and angle between two chosen cusps and the translation parameter @xmath128 describing how the horospheres are situated with respect to each other .",
    "theorem [ th:2.1 ] showed that these parameters are elements of the invariant trace field .",
    "we have a finite number of such parameters describing the geometric structure of @xmath2 , either using the labels that are assigned to a link diagram ( edge and crossing labels ) or labels assigned to a polyhedral decomposition ( zickert s parameters ) .",
    "the number of parameters needed in the above proposition can be reduced as follows .",
    "a collection of intercusp arcs in @xmath2 is a _ tunnel collection _ if the arcs can be isotoped fixing their endpoints so that they are disjoint and the result of removing open horoball neighborhoods of the cusps and tubular neigborhoods of the arcs is a handlebody . the collections of intercusp arcs used in proposition [ prop:4.1 ] is a tunnel collection , but usually a small subset of these intercusp arcs already is .",
    "for example , any two - bridge link has a tunnel collection consisting of a single intercusp arc .    if @xmath2 has a tunnel collection consisting of @xmath0 intercusp arcs , then the invariant trace field can be generated by the @xmath0 intercusp parameters of these arcs together with @xmath129 translation parameters .",
    "we number the cusps with @xmath130 .",
    "suppose the @xmath131-th horospherical cusp section has @xmath132 endpoints of tunnel arcs on it .",
    "we can find a collection of @xmath133 cusp arcs connecting these endpoints such that their union is a graph whose complement on the cusp section is an open disc ( as in fig .",
    "[ fig : h ] ) .",
    "the union of all these cusp arcs and isotoped tunnel arcs then satisfies theorem [ th:2.2 ] .",
    "the total number of these cusp arcs is @xmath134 .",
    "but the @xmath133 translation parameters at the @xmath131-th cusp section are linearly dependent modulo @xmath23 , since a meridian of the cusp section has translation parameter @xmath23 .",
    "we therefore only need @xmath132 translation parameters at the @xmath131-th cusp in applying theorem [ th:2.2 ] , for a total of @xmath129 translation parameters    in fact , usually a small subset even of the above reduced collection of labels generates the invariant trace field .",
    "for example , in @xcite it is shown that for a 2-bridge link there is an ideal triangulation ( in fact the canonical ideal triangulation ) for which the simplex parameters are all rational functions of the crossing label @xmath135 of the leftmost crossing in the standard alternating diagram for the link ( this crossing arc is a tunnel ) . by (",
    "* theorem 2.4 ) the simplex parameters of an ideal triangulation always generate the invariant trace field , so we get :      this proposition implies that for a hyperbolic 2-bridge link , the polynomial @xmath136 in @xmath135 , obtained by applying the recursive process described in @xcite , has a zero which generates the invariant trace field .",
    "note that it is not guaranteed that @xmath136 is irreducible .",
    "in fact , suppose a reduced alternating diagram of a hyperbolic two - bridge link has @xmath0 twists with @xmath137 crossings .",
    "the calculation of @xcite gives an upper bound @xmath138 for the degree of the polynomial @xmath136 , where @xmath139 if @xmath140 , and @xmath141 otherwise .",
    "the work of riley @xcite provides a sharper upper bound @xmath142 for the degree of the invariant trace field , where @xmath143 denotes the normal form of the 2-bridge type , given by @xmath144 .",
    "experiment suggests that riley s bound is usually sharp .",
    "another example is the infinite family of links that are closures of the braid @xmath145 .",
    "symmetry allows to use just three diagram labels , and a quick computation then shows that just one translation parameter suffices and the invariant trace field is generated over @xmath146 by @xmath147 ( see the  examples \" section of @xcite for a picture and relations ) .",
    "in fact , for a `` random '' knot chosen from existing knot tables it is rare that the invariant trace field is not generated by a single one of the parameters , since it is unusual that the invariant trace field has a proper subfield of degree @xmath148 .",
    "the authors would like to thank morwen thistlethwaite for help with computational aspects , and to alan reid for bringing attention to the rep - polynomial in the work of riley .",
