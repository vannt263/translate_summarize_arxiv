    "in recent years , interest in studying graphene has increased steeply due to its exceptional electronic properties and potentially significant applications in nanotechnology .",
    "graphene , a single layer of carbon atoms arranged in a hexagonal honeycomb lattices , is the thinnest known material in the universe and the strongest ever measured @xcite . in the low energy approximation ,",
    "the tight - binding description of the electron transport in graphene is reduced to the massless dirac - weyl equation with fermi velocity @xmath3 .",
    "the relatively low fermi velocity and the gapless linear energy dispersion near the dirac points @xmath4 and @xmath5 , enabled one to simulate relativistic effects like anomalous landau - hall effect @xcite , the zitterbewegung and the klein paradox @xcite , in condensed matter systems .",
    "the optical - like behavior of electron waves in graphene - based waveguide structure has also been experimentally investigated @xcite .",
    "these phenomena are expected to play a needful role in the future fabrication of desirable nanoelectronic devices .",
    "since dirac electrons can not be confined by electrostatic potentials due to klein s paradox , it was suggested that magnetic confinement should be considered @xcite .",
    "inhomogeneous magnetic fields on the nanometer scale can suppress the klein tunneling and produce graphene based structures to confine dirac fermions , but the parameters of the magnetic barriers can not be changed fast enough .",
    "electron confinement in the single @xcite , double @xcite , and multiple @xcite square - well magnetic barriers and in delta function magnetic barriers @xcite have been investigated .",
    "heaviside - step - function - like magnetic profile is used in @xcite to study the magnetic induced waveguide structure . and",
    "it is shown that the guided modes are strongly confined by this gradually varied magnetic field .",
    "recently a series of studies concerning the interaction of graphene electrons moving in magnetic fields perpendicular to the graphene surface @xcite and/or including electrostatic fields parallel to the surface @xcite have been carried out in order to find a way for confining the charges . in all these works ,",
    "the dirac - weyl equation is considered , where a minimal coupling with the vector potential describes the interaction with the external field . in general ,",
    "some kinds of numerical computation or semiclassical methods were needed to find the energy levels of confined states or transmission coefficients for scattering states under arbitrary magnetic fields .",
    "however , attempts have been made in @xcite to investigate the same by analytical method like supersymmetric quantum mechanics ( susy - qm ) @xcite .",
    "this was possible due to the fact that the hamiltonian of graphene in a background static magnetic field can be mathematically cast into one with quantum mechanical factorization properties used in susy - qm .",
    "it is shown that except for the ground state , the hamiltonians describing the dirac fermions in the two adjacent sites in the unit cell of the graphene lattice , have the same spectrum . using the factorization technique ,",
    "the exact expressions of discrete spectra and wave functions of graphene dirac electron in various magnetic fields having translational symmetry are obtained . in all these cases the effective partner hamiltonians are essentially shape invariant @xcite .",
    "it is worth mentioning here that susy - qm has been applied as well to solvable models in the low energy approximation of carbon nanotubes @xcite and spherical molecules including fullerenes @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the effect of homogeneous transverse magnetic fields on the energy spectrum of a carbon nanotube is explained .",
    "whereas , the construction of new solvable systems within the susy framework is considered in @xcite where the results are relevant not only for carbon nanotubes but also for graphene with potential barriers that possess translational invariance in one direction . a class of exactly solvable metallic and maximally semiconducting nanotubes in the presence of an external inhomogeneous magnetic field is shown to possess nontrivial integrals of motion , which establishes the @xmath6 nonlinear supersymmetry @xcite .",
    "the nonlinear hidden supersymmetry generated by local supercharges is also shown to appear naturally in the finite - gap and time - reversal invariant configurations of twisted nanotubes @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we will obtain new one parameter families of inhomogeneous external magnetic fields @xmath1 for which the dirac electron possesses exact solutions .",
    "the inhomogeneity appearing in @xmath1 can be controlled by the parameter @xmath2 . to this aim",
    "we revisit supersymmetric factorization approach to dirac - weyl equation and precisely exploit the nonuniqueness property of the superpotential ( which is directly related to the vector potential , see section [ s2 ] ) .",
    "the one parameter family of magnetic fields so obtained are shown to be the deformed variants of some well known physically interesting magnetic fields .",
    "the corresponding effective hamiltonians are no longer shape invariant and have altogether different functional forms with interesting features .",
    "the effect of these deformations on the energy spectrum and the probability current density associated with the lowest energy states of the dirac electron shall also be investigated . for illustration purposes",
    "we will consider two examples : the dirac electron being placed first in a harmonic well associated to a uniform magnetic field , and then in a morse oscillator characterizing an exponentially decaying magnetic field .",
    "it is shown that the deformation of a uniform magnetic field enables one to generate the gradually varying magnetic fields which were achieved in @xcite earlier with the help of heaviside - step function .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ s2 ] , a brief overview of the quantum mechanical treatment of the dirac - weyl equation for dirac fermion and its connection to first order susy - qm will be done .",
    "next in section [ s3 ] , the most general form of the magnetic fields , bearing exactly solvable effective potentials , are going to be derived .",
    "section [ s4 ] deals with two concrete examples : deformation of uniform and exponentially decaying magnetic fields , respectively . summary and future prospects concerning the possible experimental implication of the work are stated in section [ s5 ] .",
    "we consider dirac electron moving in graphene under static orbital magnetic field acting perpendicular to the graphene @xmath7 plane .",
    "moreover , we disregard the electronic spin degree of freedom and the presence of any disorder in the system . under these circumstances the low energy excitation of the electron around a dirac point in the brillouin zone is described by the following dirac - weyl equation @xcite @xmath8 \\psi(x , y ) = e \\psi(x , y ) , \\label{e2}\\ ] ] where the fermi velocity @xmath9 , @xmath10 are the pauli matrices , and @xmath11 is the two dimensional momentum operator . here",
    "@xmath12 is the charge of the electron and the vector potential @xmath13 is related to a slowly varying magnetic field by @xmath14 there is a lot of freedom in choosing @xmath13 and a convenient choice is landau gauge @xmath15 .",
    "now , taking into account the translational invariance along ( say ) @xmath16 direction we assume the two component spinor @xmath17 in the form @xmath18,\\label{e11}\\ ] ] @xmath19 being the wave number in the @xmath16 direction and @xmath20 describe the electron amplitude on two adjacent sites in the unit cell of graphene .",
    "consequently , the dirac - weyl equation ( [ e2 ] ) yields two coupled first order linear differential equations @xmath21 which readily can be decoupled to get two non - relativistic schrdinger equations @xmath22 , where @xmath23 @xmath24 hence , the determination of a complete solution of the dirac - weyl equation is now reduced to the problem of solving the above two schrdinger equations .",
    "indeed , the very form of the hamiltonians @xmath25 in equation ( [ e4 ] ) indicates that they can be embraced by the formalism of susy - qm if one defines the intertwining operators @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the superpotential .",
    "now , for the two operators @xmath28 , the equations in ( [ e3 ] ) reduce to @xmath29 respectively and the two hamiltonians @xmath25 become factorized in the following way @xmath30 equations ( [ e15 ] ) and ( [ e16 ] ) imply that @xmath25 are supersymmetric partners connected by the following intertwining relationships @xmath31 .",
    "this means that knowing all the eigenfunctions of @xmath32 one can determine the ones of @xmath33 using the operator @xmath34 , and vice versa , using @xmath35 one can construct all the eigenfunctions of @xmath32 from those of @xmath33 except possibly for the ground state .",
    "specifically , in standard unbroken first order supersymmetric quantum mechanics the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the two partner hamiltonians are related by @xcite : @xmath36    at this point it should be mentioned that the superpotential @xmath37 is related directly to the vector potential [ see equation  ( [ e40 ] ) ] and hence to the magnetic field by the relation @xmath38 .",
    "thus , for a particular choice of magnetic field the problem of determining the energy spectrum and the corresponding spinor wave functions of the dirac electron reduces to solving the schrdinger eigenvalue equation for either @xmath32 or @xmath33 .",
    "and once we have the complete solutions of @xmath32 or @xmath33 , we can obtain the solution of the dirac electron by using equations ( [ e11 ] ) , ( [ e10 ] ) and ( [ e7 ] ) .",
    "so far , this technique has been implemented in order to solve the dirac - weyl equation under several magnetic fields which give rise to the so - called shape invariant effective potentials @xmath39 . in the next section , departing from these cases we are going to generate new inhomogeneous magnetic fields for which the corresponding effective potentials are no longer shape invariant yet the dirac - weyl equation is exactly solvable .",
    "here we will obtain the most general form of the magnetic field departing from a given initial one @xmath40 , keeping intact the exact solvability of the dirac - weyl equation .",
    "to this end , we introduce a generalized superpotential for the usual quantities and @xmath41 for those which correspond to the deformation . ]",
