    "although based on different atoms and geometries , the atomic gyroscope and gravimeter rely on the same principle , which is presented in figure [ gyro ] .",

    "@xmath2cs atoms are launched upwards with an angle of 8 with respect to verticality using the technic of moving molasses , whereas in the gravimeter , @xmath3rb atoms are simply let to fall .",
    "then the initial quantum state is prepared by a combination of microwave and optical pulses .",
    "the manipulation of the atoms is realized by stimulated raman transition pulses @xcite , using two counter - propagating lasers , which drive coherent transitions between the two hyperfine levels of the alkali atom .",
    "three laser pulses , of durations @xmath4 , separated in time by @xmath5 , respectively split , redirect and recombine the atomic wave - packets , creating an atomic interferometer @xcite .",

    "the phase difference between the two raman lasers ( which we will call the raman phase throughout this article , and denote @xmath8 ) is printed at each pulse on the phase of the atomic wave function @xcite .",
    "as @xmath8 depends on the position of the atoms , the interferometer is sensitive to inertial forces , and can thus measure rotation rates and accelerations .",
    "a drawback of this technic is that the measurement of the interferometric phase is affected by the phase noise of the raman lasers , as well as parasitic vibrations .",

    "the sensitivity function is a natural tool to characterize the influence of the fluctuations in the raman phase @xmath8 on the transition probability @xcite , and thus on the interferometric phase .",
    "let s assume a phase jump @xmath9 occurs on the raman phase @xmath8 at time t during the interferometer sequence , inducing a change of @xmath10 in the transition probability .",
    "the sensitivity function is then defined by :    @xmath11    the sensitivity function can easily be calculated for infinitesimally short raman pulses . in this case",
    ", the interferometric phase @xmath7 can be deduced from the raman phases @xmath12,@xmath13,@xmath14 during the three laser interactions , taken at the position of the center of the atomic wavepacket : @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "usually , the interferometer is operated at @xmath16 , for which the transition probability is 1/2 , to get the highest sensitivity to interferometric phase fluctuations .",
    "if the phase step @xmath17 occurs for instance between the first and the second pulses , the interferometric phase changes by @xmath18 , and the transition probability by @xmath19 in the limit of an infinitesimal phase step .",
    "thus , in between the first two pulses , the sensitivity function is -1 . the same way , one finds for the sensitivity function between the last two pulses : + 1 .    in the general case of finite duration raman laser pulses ,",
    "the sensitivity function depends on the evolution of the atomic state during the pulses . in order to calculate @xmath20",
    ", we make several assumptions .",
    "first , the laser waves are considered as pure plane waves .",
    "the atomic motion is then quantized in the direction parallel to the laser beams .",
    "second , we restrict our calculation to the case of a constant rabi frequency ( square pulses ) .",
    "third , we assume the resonance condition is fulfilled .",
    "the raman interaction then couples the two states @xmath21 and @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the two hyperfine levels of the ground state , @xmath25 is the atomic momentum , @xmath26 is the difference between the wave vectors of the two lasers .",
    "we develop the atomic wave function on the basis set @xmath27 so that @xmath28 , and choose the initial state to be @xmath29 . at the output of the interferometer ,",
    "the transition probability is given by @xmath30 , where @xmath31 .",
    "the evolution of @xmath32 and @xmath33 from @xmath34 to @xmath35 is given by @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the evolution matrix through the whole interferometer .",
    "solving the schrdinger equation gives the evolution matrix during a raman pulse@xcite , from time @xmath38 to time @xmath39 :    @xmath40    where @xmath41 is the rabi frequency and @xmath42 , the effective frequency , is the frequency difference between the two lasers , @xmath43 .",
    "setting @xmath44 in @xmath45 gives the free evolution matrix , which determines the evolution between the pulses .",
    "the evolution matrix for the full evolution is obtained by taking the product of several matrices .",
    "when @xmath39 occurs during the @xmath46 laser pulse , we split the evolution matrix of this pulse at time @xmath39 into two successive matrices , the first one with @xmath47 , and the second one with @xmath48 .",
    "finally , we choose the time origin at the middle of the second raman pulse . we thus have @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "we then calculate the change in the transition probability for a infinitesimally small phase jump at any time t during the interferometer , and deduce @xmath20 .",
    "it is an odd function , whose expression is given here for @xmath51 :    @xmath52    when the phase jump occurs outside the interferometer , the change in the transition probability is null , so that @xmath53 for @xmath54 .    in order to validate this calculation",
    ", we use the gyroscope experiment to measure experimentally the sensitivity function . about @xmath55 atoms from a background vapor are loaded in a 3d - mot within 125 ms , with 6 laser beams tuned to the red of the @xmath56 transition at 852 nm .",
    "the atoms are then launched upwards at @xmath57 m / s within 1 ms , and cooled down to an effective temperature of @xmath58k .",
    "after launch , the atoms are prepared into the @xmath59 state using a combination of microwave and laser pulses : they first enter a selection cavity tuned to the @xmath60 transition .",
    "the atoms left in the @xmath61 state are pushed away by a laser beam tuned to the @xmath56 transition , 11 cm above the selection cavity .",
    "the selected atoms then reach the apogee 245 ms after the launch , where they experience three interferometer pulses of duration @xmath4 with @xmath62s separated in time by @xmath63 ms .",
    "the number of atoms @xmath64 and @xmath65 are finally measured by detecting the fluorescence induced by a pair of laser beams located 7 cm below the apogee . from these measurements ,",
    "we deduce the transition probability @xmath66 .",
    "the total number of detected atoms is about @xmath67 .",
    "the repetition rate of the experiment is 2 hz .    the set - up for the generation of the two raman laser beams is displayed in figure [ raman ] .",
    "two slave diode lasers of 150 mw output power are injected with extended cavity diode lasers .",
    "the polarizations of the slave diodes output beams are made orthogonal so that the two beams can be combined onto a polarization beam splitter cube .",
    "the light at this cube is then split in two distinct unbalanced paths .",
    "ghz between the two raman lasers is observed on a fast response photodetector .",
    "after amplification , this beatnote is mixed with the reference frequency at @xmath68 ghz from the frequency chain , to obtain a signal at @xmath69 mhz .",
    "this signal is compared with the reference frequency at @xmath69 mhz from the same frequency chain to get an error signal .",
    "this error signal is then processed and sent to the current of the laser and to the pzt that controls the laser cavity length.,width=480 ]    on the first path , most of the power of each beam is sent through an optical fiber to the vacuum chamber .",
    "the two beams are then collimated with an objective attached onto the chamber ( waist @xmath70 mm ) .",
    "they enter together through a viewport , cross the atomic cloud , and are finally retroreflected by a mirror fixed outside the vacuum chamber . in this geometry",
    ", four laser beams are actually sent onto the atoms , which interact with only two of them , because of selection rules and resonance conditions .",
    "the interferometer can also be operated with co - propagating raman laser beams by simply blocking the light in front of the retroreflecting mirror .",
    "a remarkable feature of this experiment is that the three interferometer pulses are realized by this single pair of raman lasers that is turned on and off three times , the middle pulse being at the top of the atoms trajectory .",
    "for all the measurements described in this article , the raman lasers are used in the @xmath71 configuration .",
    "the interferometer is then no longer sensitive to inertial forces , but remains sensitive to the relative phase of the raman lasers . moreover , as such raman transitions are not velocity selective , more atoms contribute to the signal .",
    "all this allows us to reach a good signal to noise ratio of 150 per shot .",
    "the second path is used to control the raman lasers phase difference , which needs to be locked @xcite onto the phase of a very stable microwave oscillator .",
    "the phase lock loop scheme is also displayed in figure[raman ] .",
    "the frequency difference is measured by a fast photodetector , which detects a beatnote at 9.192 ghz .",
    "this signal is then mixed with the signal of a dielectric resonator oscillator ( dro ) tuned at 9.392 ghz .",
    "the dro itself is phase locked onto the 94th harmonics of a very stable 100 mhz quartz .",
    "the output of the mixer ( if ) is 200 mhz .",
    "a local oscillator ( lo ) at 200 mhz is generated by doubling the same 100 mhz quartz . if and lo are compared using a digital phase and frequency detector , whose output is used as the error signal of the phase - locked loop .",
    "the relative phase of the lasers is stabilized by reacting on the current of one of the two diode lasers , as well as on the voltage applied to the pzt that controls the length of the extended cavity diode laser @xcite .    to measure @xmath20 , a small phase step of @xmath72 rad",
    "is applied at time @xmath39 on the local oscillator .",
    "the phase lock loop copies this phase step onto the raman phase within a fraction of @xmath73 , which is much shorter than the raman pulse duration of @xmath74 .",
    "finally we measured the transition probability as a function of @xmath39 and deduced the sensitivity function .",
    "we display in figure [ sensitivityplottotal ] the measurement of the sensitivity function compared with the theoretical calculation .",
    "we also realized a precise measurement during each pulse and clearly obtained the predicted sinusoidal rise of the sensitivity function .",
    "as a function of time , for a three pulses interferometer with a rabi frequency @xmath75 .",
    "the theoretical calculation is displayed in solid line and the experimental measurement with crosses .",
    "a zoom is made on the first pulse.,width=480 ]    for a better agreement of the experimental data with the theoretical calculation , the data are normalized to take into account the interferometer s contrast , which was measured to be @xmath76 .",
    "this reduction in the contrast with respect to @xmath77 is due to the combined effect of inhomogeneous rabi frequencies between the atoms , and unbalanced rabi frequencies between the pulses .",
    "indeed , the atomic cloud size of @xmath78 mm is not negligible with respect to the size of the single pair of raman gaussian beams , @xmath70 mm .",
    "atoms at both sides of the atomic cloud will not see the same intensity , inducing variable transfer efficiency of the raman transitions .",
    "moreover , the cloud moves by about @xmath79 mm between the first and the last pulse . in order for the cloud to explore only the central part of the gaussian beams , we choose a rather small interaction time of @xmath63 ms with respect to the maximum interaction time possible of @xmath80 ms .",
    "still , the quantitative agreement is not perfect .",
    "one especially observes a significant asymmetry of the sensitivity function , which remains to be explained .",
    "a full numerical simulation could help in understanding the effect of the experimental imperfections .",
    "from the sensitivity function , we can now evaluate the fluctuations of the interferometric phase @xmath7 for an arbitrary raman phase noise @xmath81 on the lasers @xmath82 the transfer function of the interferometer can be obtained by calculating the response of the interferometer phase @xmath7 to a sinusoidal modulation of the raman phase , given by @xmath83 .",
    "we find @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is the fourier transform of the sensitivity function .",
    "when averaging over a random distribution of the modulation phase @xmath87 , the rms value of the interferometer phase is @xmath88 .",
    "the transfer function is thus given by @xmath89 .",
    "if we now assume uncorrelated raman phase noise between successive measurements , the rms standard deviation of the interferometric phase noise @xmath90 is given by : @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the power spectral density of the raman phase .",
    "we calculate the fourier transform of the sensitivity function and find : @xmath93    at low frequency , where @xmath94 , the sensitivity function can be approximated by @xmath95    the weighting function @xmath96 versus the frequency @xmath97 is displayed in figure [ ponderation ] .",
    "it has two important features : the first one is an oscillating behavior at a frequency given by @xmath98 , leading to zeros at frequencies given by @xmath99 . the second is a low pass first order filtering due to the finite duration of the raman pulses , with an effective cutoff frequency @xmath100 , given by @xmath101 . above 1 khz only the mean value over one oscillation",
    "is displayed on the figure .    .",
    "above 1 khz only the mean value of the weighting function over @xmath102 is displayed .",
    "the weighting function acts as a first order low pass filter , with an effective cutoff frequency of @xmath101,width=480 ]    in order to measure the transfer function , a phase modulation @xmath103 is applied on the raman phase , triggered on the first raman pulse .",
    "the interferometric phase variation is then recorded as a function of @xmath104 .",
    "we then repeat the measurements for the phase modulation in quadrature @xmath105 . from the quadratic sum of these measurement",
    ", we extract @xmath106 .",
    "the weighting function was first measured at low frequency .",
    "the results , displayed in figure [ weightfct2 ] together with the theoretical value , clearly demonstrate the oscillating behavior of the weighting function .",
    "figure [ weightfct3 ] displays the measurements performed slightly above the cutoff frequency , and shows two zeros .",
    "the first one corresponds to a frequency multiple of @xmath107 .",
    "the second one is a zero of the last factor of equation [ eq : g3 ] .",
    "its position depends critically on the value of the rabi frequency .     for @xmath63ms and @xmath108 , at low frequency .",
    "the theoretical calculation is displayed in solid line and the experimental results in squares .",
    "we clearly see the oscillating behavior of the weighting function and the experimental measurement are in good agreement with the theoretical calculation.,width=480 ]     for @xmath63ms and @xmath108,displayed near the rabi frequency . the theoretical calculation is displayed in solid line and the experimental results in squares .",
    "we identified the zero multiple of @xmath109 and observed experimentally both zeros with a good agreement with theory.,width=480 ]    when comparing the data with the calculation , the experimental imperfections already mentioned have to be accounted for .",
    "an effective rabi frequency @xmath110 can be defined by the relation @xmath111 , where @xmath112 is the duration of the single pulse , performed at the center of the gaussian raman beams , that optimizes the transition probability . for homogeneous raman beams",
    ", this pulse would be a @xmath113 pulse .",
    "this effective rabi frequency is measured with an uncertainty of about 1 % .",
    "it had to be corrected by only 1.5 % in order for the theoretical and experimental positions of the second zero to match .",
    "the excellent agreement between the theoretical and experimental curves validate our model .",
    "the sensitivity of the interferometer is characterized by the allan variance of the interferometric phase fluctuations , @xmath114 , defined as    @xmath115    where @xmath116 is the average value of @xmath117 over the interval @xmath118 $ ] of duration @xmath119 .",
    "the allan variance is equal , within a factor of two , to the variance of the differences in the successive average values @xmath120 of the interferometric phase .",
    "our interferometer being operated sequentially at a rate @xmath121 , @xmath119 is a multiple of @xmath122 : @xmath123 . without loosing generality ,",
    "we can choose @xmath124 .",
    "the average value @xmath120 can now be expressed as    @xmath125    where @xmath126 .",
    "the difference between successive average values is then given by @xmath127    for long enough averaging times , the fluctuations of the successive averages are not correlated and the allan variance is given by @xmath128 is the fourier transform of the function @xmath129 .",
    "after a few algebra , we find for the squared modulus of @xmath130 the following expression @xmath131 when @xmath132 , @xmath133 .",
    "thus for large averaging times @xmath119 , the allan variance of the interferometric phase is given by @xmath134 equation [ dick ] shows that the sensitivity of the interferometer is limited by an aliasing phenomenon similar to the dick effect in atomic clocks@xcite : only the phase noise at multiple of the cycling frequency appear in the allan variance , weighted by the fourier components of the transfer function .",
    "let s examine now the case of white raman phase noise : @xmath135 .",
    "the interferometer sensitivity is given by : @xmath136 in that case , the sensitivity of the interferometer depend not only on the raman phase noise spectral density but also on the pulse duration @xmath137 . for a better sensitivity , one should use the largest pulse duration as possible .",
    "but , as the raman transitions are velocity selective , a very long pulse will reduce the number of useful atoms .",
    "this increases the detection noise contribution , so that there is an optimum value of @xmath137 that depends on the experimental parameters . in the case of the gyroscope ,",
    "the optimum was found to be @xmath138s .    to reach a good sensitivity ,",
    "the raman phase needs to be locked to the phase of a very stable microwave oscillator ( whose frequency is 6.834 ghz for @xmath3rb and 9.192 ghz for @xmath2cs ) .",
    "this oscillator can be generated by a frequency chain , where low phase noise quartz performances are transposed in the microwave domain . at low frequencies ( @xmath139 hz ) ,",
    "the phase noise spectral density of such an oscillator is usually well approximated by a @xmath140 power law ( flicker noise ) , whereas at high frequency ( @xmath141 khz ) , it is independent of the frequency ( white noise ) . using equation [ dick ] and the typical parameters of our experiments ( @xmath108 and @xmath142 ms )",
    ", we can calculate the phase noise spectral density required to achieve an interferometric phase fluctuation of 1 mrad per shot .",
    "this is equivalent to the quantum projection noise limit for @xmath143 detected atoms .",
    "the flicker noise of the microwave oscillator should be lower than @xmath144 at 1 hz from the carrier frequency , and its white noise below @xmath145 .",
    "unfortunately , there exists no quartz oscillator combining these two levels of performance .",
    "thus , we plan to lock a sc premium 100 mhz oscillator ( from wenzel company ) onto a low flicker noise 5 mhz blue top oscillator ( wenzel ) . from the specifications of these quartz",
    ", we calculate a contribution of 1.2 mrad to the interferometric phase noise .",
    "phase fluctuations also arise from residual noise in the servo - lock loop .",
    "we have measured experimentally the residual phase noise power spectral density of a phase lock system analogous to the one described in figure [ raman ] .",
    "this system has been developed for phase locking the raman lasers of the gravimeter experiment .",
    "the measurement was performed by mixing if and lo onto an independent rf mixer , whose output phase fluctuations was analyzed onto a fast fourier transform analyzer .",
    "the result of the measurement is displayed on figure [ phaselock ] . at low frequencies , below 100 hz",
    ", the phase noise of our phaselock system lies well below the required flicker noise .",
    "after a few khz , it reaches a plateau of @xmath146 .",
    "the amplitude of this residual noise is not limited by the gain of the servo loop . above 60 khz ,",
    "it increases up to @xmath147 at @xmath148 mhz , which is the bandwidth of our servo lock loop . using equation [ dick ]",
    ", we evaluated to @xmath149 mrad its contribution to the interferometer s phase noise .    .",
    "in doted line is displayed an extrapolation of the phase noise due to the phase - lock loop alone between 100 khz and 300 khz.,width=480 ]    other sources of noise are expected to contribute , which havent been investigated here : noise of the fast photodetector , phase noise due to the propagation of the raman beams in free space and in optical fibers @xcite .",
    "the same formalism can be used to evaluate the degradation of the sensitivity caused by parasitic vibrations in the usual case of counter - propagating raman beams .",
    "as the two laser beams are first overlapped before being sent onto the atoms , their phase difference is mostly affected by the movements of a single optical element , the mirror that finally retro - reflects them .",
    "a displacement of this mirror by @xmath150 induces a raman phase shift of @xmath151 .",
    "the sensitivity of the interferometer is then given by @xmath152 where @xmath153 is the power spectral density of position noise .",
    "introducing the power spectral density of acceleration noise @xmath153 , the previous equation can be written    @xmath154    it is important to note here that the acceleration noise is severely filtered by the transfer function for acceleration which decreases as @xmath155 .    in the case of white acceleration noise @xmath156 , and to first order in @xmath157 , the limit on the sensitivity of the interferometer",
    "is given by :    @xmath158    to put this into numbers , we now calculate the requirements on the acceleration noise of the retroreflecting mirror in order to reach a sensitivity of 1 mrad per shot . for the typical parameters of our gravimeter , the amplitude noise should lie below @xmath159 .",
    "the typical amplitude of the vibration noise measured on the lab floor is @xmath160 at 1 hz and rises up to about @xmath161 at 10 hz .",
    "this vibration noise can be lowered to a few @xmath162 in the 1 to 100 hz frequency band with a passive isolation platform . to fill the gap and cancel the effect of vibrations",
    ", one could use the method proposed in @xcite , which consists in measuring the vibrations of the mirror with a very low noise seismometer and compensate the fluctuations of the position of the mirror by reacting on the raman lasers phase difference .",
    "we have here calculated and experimentally measured the sensitivity function of a three pulses atomic interferometer .",
    "this enables us to determine the influence of the raman phase noise , as well as of parasitic vibrations , on the noise on the interferometer phase .",
    "reaching a 1 mrad shot to shot fluctuation requires a very low phase noise frequency reference , an optimized phase lock loop of the raman lasers , together with a very low level of parasitic vibrations . with our typical experimental parameters , this would result in a sensitivity of @xmath163 for the gyroscope and of @xmath164 for the gravimeter .",
    "improvements are still possible",
    ". the frequency reference could be obtained from an ultra stable microwave oscillator , such as a cryogenic sapphire oscillator @xcite , whose phase noise lies well below the best quartz available . besides , the requirements on the phase noise would be easier to achieve using atoms with a lower hyperfine transition frequency , such as na or k. trapping a very large initial number of atoms in the 3d - mot would enable a very drastic velocity selection .",
    "the duration of the raman pulses could then be significantly increased , which makes the interferometer less sensitive to high frequency raman phase noise .",
    "the manipulation of the atoms can also be implemented using bragg pulses @xcite .",
    "the difference in the frequencies of the two beams being much smaller , the requirements on the relative phase stability is easy to achieve . in that case",
    ", a different detection method needs to be implemented as atoms in both exit ports of the interferometer are in the same internal state . using ultracold atoms with subrecoil temperature , atomic wavepackets at the two exit ports",
    "can be spatially separated , which allows for a simple detection based on absorption imaging .",
    "such an interferometer would benefit from the long interaction times available in space to reach a very high sensitivity .",
    "we also want to emphasize that the sensitivity function can also be used to calculate the phase shifts arising from all possible systematic effects , such as the light shifts , the magnetic field gradients and the cold atom collisions .",
