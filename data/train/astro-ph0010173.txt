    "the success of orientation - based models in explaining much of the variety in the observed properties of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) has underlined the importance of obscuration located around these objects . in this class of models ,",
    "a dusty torus surrounds the agn and blocks our view of the nuclear region for high - inclination lines of sight . not only can obscuration account for the existence of so - called `` type-2 '' objects dominated by narrow emission lines , but also their tendency toward higher polarization due to scattering within the narrow - line region ( nlr ) , the presence of broad emission lines in polarized flux spectra , and their relatively large values of @xmath1",
    "this appreciation of orientation effects has been extremely useful in establishing the equivalence ( `` unification '' ) of several apparently disparate agn types , but it has also called attention to possible large biases in some samples of agn ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "traditional uv / optical survey techniques ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are likely to miss agn obscured by dust located either near the nucleus or in the body of the host galaxy .",
    "depending on the covering factor of the obscuring material , the space density of radio - quiet agn could be a factor of two or more greater than current surveys suggest ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "infrared surveys offer the advantage of being less susceptible to extinction by dust , plus they are sensitive to the more or less isotropic re - emission of the absorbed soft x - ray  optical radiation .",
    "this reprocessed component appears as a broad peak in the spectral energy distribution around 25100  @xmath2 m .",
    "the discovery of strongly polarized broad lines in `` hyperluminous '' infrared galaxies ( higs : @xcite ) found by the _ infrared astronomical satellite _ proved that obscured qsos can be detected in the ir @xcite , but _ iras _ lacked the sensitivity to acquire more than a handful of such agn .",
    "unfortunately , no sensitive hard x - ray or mid - ir surveys are currently planned that would cover a large part of the sky and be suitable for determining the fraction of obscured - to - unobscured radio - quiet agn .",
    "however , @xcite have discovered a large number of previously unknown , primarily low-@xmath3 , red agn in the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ; @xcite ) using a simple near - infrared color - selection criterion .",
    "that is , objects at @xmath4 with @xmath5 . in this _ letter _",
    "we present optical observations of two objects from the @xcite sample that illustrate the variety of agn being found by 2mass .",
    "the high polarization induced by small - particle scattering observed for these objects confirms that near - ir surveys do indeed find obscured agn .",
    "high polarization was found for the agn 2massi j151653.2 + 190048 and 2massi j165939.7 + 183436 ( hereafter 2m1516 and 2m1659 , respectively ) during an optical polarization survey of the @xcite sample @xcite .",
    "basic observed properties of these two objects are provided in table  1 . the near - ir  to  optical flux ratio ( as measured by @xmath6 ) for 2m1516  is near the highest value observed for the optically - selected palomar - green ( pg ) qso sample @xcite , and 2m1659  is about a magnitude redder .",
    "the new 2mass agn are similar to optically selected qsos in that their near - ir and [ ] @xmath05007 luminosities are comparable @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , follow - up broad - band polarimetry found that the optical polarization of each object greatly exceeds the levels present in the pg catalog @xcite .",
    "in fact , except for the blazar class , these two 2mass objects are among the most highly polarized agn known .    optical ( @xmath744008800 ) spectropolarimetry of 2m1516  and 2m1659  was obtained on ut 2000 may 9 and 1999 oct .",
    "1315 , respectively , using the ccd imaging / spectropolarimeter @xcite and steward observatory 2.3  m bok reflector .",
    "the instrument configuration included a slit @xmath8wide @xmath9 51  long plus a 600  g  mm@xmath10 grating to yield @xmath1112    spectral resolution .",
    "multiple waveplate sequences on each object totaled 6720  s and 9600  s , respectively .",
    "the data are shown in figures  1 and 2 .",
    "an additional blue spectrum of 2m1516  ( @xmath733705600 ) was obtained on ut 2000 may 28 with the boller & chivens spectrograph and bok reflector .",
    "a 900  s exposure was taken using a 25-wide slit .",
    "these results are in excellent agreement with the flux spectrum obtained by the earlier spectropolarimetry , so the extended spectrum in figure  1 was created by averaging the flux levels in the overlap region .",
    "4.30truein      the type-1 spectrum of 2m1516  shows strong balmer emission lines with widths @xmath12  km  s@xmath10  and fe  ii features superposed on a fairly blue continuum .",
    "this object actually satisfies the selection criteria of the pg survey , since our spectroscopy indicates @xmath13 , and @xmath14 .",
    "given the photometric accuracy of the pg plates and possible variability typical of qsos , objects this close to the selection limits ( @xmath15 ; @xmath16 ) can be easily missed @xcite .    spectropolarimetry confirms the high @xmath17-band polarization measured for 2m1516 . in figure  1 the continuum polarization is seen to smoothly increase from @xmath117% at 7300    ( rest frame ) to @xmath1115% at 3700   .",
    "the position angle , @xmath18 , of continuum polarization is constant with wavelength .",
    "polarization structure is apparent in the broad balmer lines ( see esp .",
    "h@xmath19 ) , but emission from the broad - line region ( blr ) is polarized to nearly the same degree and position angle as the surrounding continuum , indicating that the common polarizing mechanism is small - particle scattering . the flux from the [ ] lines , however ,",
    "is consistent with being unpolarized , requiring that light from the continuum source and surrounding blr be scattered into our line of sight by material located near and/or within the nlr .",
    "the polarization structure observed in the broad emission lines suggests that the blr is spatially resolved from the vantage point of the scattering material nearest the nucleus .",
    "4.7truein      @xcite classify 2m1659  a type-1.5 agn from their original spectroscopic observation .",
    "narrow emission lines dominate the optical spectrum , with an [ ] @xmath05007 equivalent width of @xmath11100   .",
    "the difference in contrast between the [ ] lines of 2m1516  and 2m1659  is due to the weak continuum and broad - line spectrum of the latter , not a paucity of narrow - line emission in the former , since the [ ] @xmath05007 luminosity measured for 2m1516  is actually @xmath111.4 times that of the narrow - line object .",
    "the h@xmath19 and [ ] @xmath06583 lines in 2m1659are easily separated at this resolution and sit atop a broad h@xmath19 component in total flux .",
    "a weak broad - line component is also apparent at h@xmath20 .",
    "the optical polarization of 2m1659  averaged over the region sampled by the spectropolarimetry is @xmath21% at @xmath22 .",
    "this is consistent with the unfiltered observation obtained 1999 sep .  13 ( table  1 ) , though the broad - band measurement extends @xmath111000    bluer .",
    "spectropolarimetry reveals that the continuum polarization increases from @xmath115% at 7200    to @xmath118% at 3800    ( rest ) , and that @xmath23 rotates @xmath1110@xmath24  between these two wavelengths .    the stokes flux spectrum ( @xmath25 ; where @xmath26 is the @xmath27 stokes parameter computed for a coordinate system aligned with the mean optical polarization position angle ) of 2m1659  is strikingly different from its total flux spectrum . the narrow emission lines which dominate the total flux are completely absent , but broad",
    "( @xmath28  km  s@xmath10 ) h@xmath19 and h@xmath20 are seen . the continuum is also bluer in stokes flux than in total flux . as with 2m1516 ,",
    "these properties indicate that polarization occurs through scattering by material close to , or within , the nlr .",
    "the very strong optical polarizations of 2m1516  and 2m1659  are remarkable for non - blazar qsos , but not without precedent .",
    "a few known higs @xcite show broadband values which exceed that of the type-1 source 2m1516 , but all exhibit type-2 spectra in total flux . among type-1 sources , the properties of 2m1516",
    "most closely resemble mrk  231 @xcite , mrk  486 @xcite , and the high - polarization seyfert galaxies studied by @xcite .",
    "most of these objects show optical polarization that rapidly increases into the blue . in mrk  231 , @xmath29 continues to increase past mg  ii @xmath02800 , reaching @xmath1118% before dilution of the scattered light by an unpolarized component , possibly hot stars , becomes important @xcite . although the wavelength dependence of polarization in mrk  231 is stronger at optical wavelengths @xcite , the higher redshift and less - reddened spectrum of 2m1516  imply that a similar stellar component would be less significant , so its ultraviolet polarization could easily exceed 25% .",
    "the existence of structure in @xmath30 and @xmath23 across the broad emission lines of 2m1516  is a property also shared by other polarized type-1 agn .",
    "similar polarimetric signatures at h@xmath19 in mrk  231 and mrk  486 have been explained as the result of at least two differently - polarized emission - line components from the blr @xcite .",
    "the likelihood of multiple polarized components suggests that the scattering material must lie close to or partially within the blr ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "by contrast , the strong optical polarization and high nlr / blr flux ratio of 2m1659 , traits now familiar from polarization studies of type-2 seyfert galaxies and higs , attest to an agn partially obscured from our direct view .",
    "such objects are important for understanding the orientation effects that are thought to unify apparently disparate classes of agn .",
    "past optical qso surveys have likely been biased against finding these narrow - line objects because obscuration tends to place even low-@xmath3 objects below survey limiting magnitudes and outside of survey color - selection criteria .",
    "for example , 2m1659  falls 2  magnitudes below the pg survey limit at @xmath31 despite the fact that its apparent @xmath32 magnitude is close to the median for pg qsos ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "it is consistent with the orientation - based agn scheme that many of the likely examples of type-2 qsos have been discovered by either _ iras _ ( see  1 ) or by near - ir surveys like 2mass @xcite . new , deep multi - color optical surveys such as the sloan digital sky survey @xcite and the digital palomar observatory sky survey @xcite are conceivably sensitive to finding type-2 agn in specific redshift bands as high equivalent - width narrow lines migrate across filter band - passes @xcite .",
    "a population of obscured agn with high optical polarization is being revealed by 2mass .",
    "the importance of this new population is perhaps best illustrated by comparison to the 114 members of the pg sample , where the most strongly polarized is pg  1114 + 445 at only @xmath34% @xcite . like the 2mass qsos studied here",
    ", the emission lines of pg  1114 + 445 basically share the polarization of the continuum @xcite , so scattering of continuum and blr light into our line of sight is also favored as the polarizing mechanism .",
    "yet the very modest polarization of pg  1114 + 445 is accompanied by optical and near - ir colors ( @xmath35 ; @xmath36 ) that are only slightly bluer than observed for 2m1516 .",
    "this suggests that the optical color selection criterion chosen for the pg survey effectively marks a boundary between blue qsos that are essentially unpolarized and redder qsos where the scattered flux is not necessarily swamped by the direct , unpolarized light of the nucleus .    high polarization in qsos",
    "is also associated with absorption features intrinsic to the agn ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this vision of the agn unification scheme ,",
    "broad absorption - line regions arise through the ablation of high - velocity clouds off the surface of the obscuring torus , but these are visible  and a balqso appears  only if our line of sight to the nucleus just skims that surface @xcite .",
    "large scattering angles for the reflected light coupled with partial obscuration of the nucleus is thought to account for the tendency of balqsos to be more highly polarized than for unobscured qsos .",
    "ultraviolet observations test the viability and constrain the geometry of these models , and the highly - polarized 2mass agn are an important sample in which to test these predictions .",
    "x - ray observations will also be indispensable for determining column densities and the nature of the obscuring material .    compared with current optical samples ,",
    "the 2mass agn sample contains many qsos with very different optical properties , including highly polarized objects .",
    "while the obscured - to - unobscured ratio and space density of radio - quiet agn in the local universe remain to be determined , it is already clear that 2mass will provide much more unbiased estimates than currently exist .",
    "we thank frank low for useful discussions and dan mcintosh for obtaining a blue spectrum of 2m1516 .",
    "we also thank an anonymous referee for critically reading the manuscript and for insightful comments concerning the spectral classification of 2m1659 .",
