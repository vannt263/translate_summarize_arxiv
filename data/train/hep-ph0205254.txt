    "rare @xmath9 decays involving flavour - changing - neutral - current ( fcnc ) transitions , such as @xmath13 and @xmath14 , have received a lot of theoretical interest @xcite .",
    "first measurements of the decay @xmath15 were reported by the cleo collaboration @xcite .",
    "these decays are now being investigated more precisely in experiments at the b factories .",
    "the current world average based on the improved measurements by the cleo @xcite , aleph @xcite and belle @xcite collaborations , @xmath16 , is in good agreement with the estimates of the standard model ( sm ) @xcite , which we shall take as @xmath17 , reflecting the parametric uncertainties dominated by the scheme - dependence of the quark masses .",
    "the decay @xmath15 also provides useful constraints on the parameters of the supersymmetric theories , which in the context of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) have been recently updated in @xcite .",
    "exclusive decays involving the @xmath13 transition are best exemplified by the decay @xmath18 , which have been measured with a typical accuracy of @xmath19 , the current branching ratios being @xcite @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "these decays have been analyzed recently @xcite , by taking into account @xmath2 corrections , henceforth referred to as the next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) estimates , in the large - energy - effective - theory ( leet ) limit @xcite .",
    "as this framework does not predict the decay form factors , which have to be supplied from outside , consistency of nlo - leet estimates with current data constrains the magnetic moment form factor in @xmath18 in the range @xmath22 .",
    "these values are somewhat lower than the corresponding estimates in the lattice - qcd framework , yielding @xcite @xmath23 , and in the light cone qcd sum rule approach , which give typically @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "( earlier lattice - qcd results on @xmath18 form factors are reviewed in @xcite . )",
    "it is imperative to check the consistency of the nlo - leet estimates , as this would provide a crucial test of the ideas on qcd - factorization , which have been formulated in the context of non - leptonic exclusive @xmath9-decays @xcite , but which have also been invoked in the study of exclusive radiative and semileptonic @xmath9-decays @xcite .",
    "the decays @xmath25 and @xmath18 provide a good consistency check of this framework , with the branching ratios , the isospin - violating ratio @xmath26 and direct cp - violating asymmetries , such as @xmath27 , being the quantities of interest @xcite .",
    "likewise , isospin - violation in the decays @xmath18 , defined as @xmath28 and its charge conjugate @xmath29 , will also test this framework @xcite .",
    "the exclusive decays @xmath4 , @xmath30 have also been studied in the nlo - leet approach in @xcite . in this case , the leet symmetry brings an enormous simplicity , reducing the number of independent form factors from seven to only two , corresponding to the transverse and longitudinal polarization of the virtual photon in the underlying process @xmath31 , called hereafter @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "the same symmetry reduces the number of independent form factors in the decays @xmath1 from four to two .",
    "moreover , in the @xmath34-range where the large energy limit holds , the two set of form factors are equal to each other , up to @xmath3-breaking corrections , which are already calculated in specific theoretical frameworks .",
    "thus , knowing @xmath35 precisely , one can make theoretically robust predictions for the rare @xmath9-decay @xmath4 from the measured @xmath36 decay in the sm .",
    "the leet symmetries are broken by qcd interactions and the leading @xmath2 corrections in perturbation theory are known @xcite .",
    "we make use of these theoretical developments and go a step further in that we calculate the various independent helicity amplitudes in the decays @xmath37 and @xmath1 in the nlo accuracy in the large energy limit .",
    "we recall that a decomposition of the final state @xmath38 in terms of the helicity amplitudes @xmath39 and @xmath40 , without the explicit @xmath2 corrections , was undertaken in a number of papers @xcite . in particular , kim et al .",
    "@xcite emphasized the role of the azimuthal angle distribution as a precision test of the sm .",
    "following closely the earlier analyses , we now calculate the @xmath2 corrections in the leet framework .    concentrating on the decay @xmath4 ,",
    "the main theoretical tool is the factorization ansatz which enables one to relate the form factors in full qcd ( called in the literature @xmath41 ) and the two leet form factors @xmath42 and @xmath43 @xcite ; @xmath44 where the quantities @xmath45 @xmath46 encode the perturbative improvements of the factorized part @xmath47 and @xmath48 is the hard spectator kernel ( regulated so as to be free of the end - point singularities ) , representing the non - factorizable perturbative corrections , with the direct product understood as a convolution of @xmath48 with the light - cone distribution amplitudes of the @xmath9 meson ( @xmath49 ) and the vector meson ( @xmath50 ) . with this ansatz , it is a straightforward exercise to implement the @xmath2-improvements in the various helicity amplitudes .",
    "the non - perturbative information is encoded in the leet - form factors , which are _ a priori _ unknown , and the various parameters which enter in the description of the non - factorizing hard spectator contribution , which we shall discuss at some length .",
    "the normalization of the leet form factor @xmath51 at @xmath52 is determined by the @xmath18 decay rate ; the other form factor @xmath33 has to be modeled entirely for which we use the light cone qcd sum rules .",
    "this input , which for sure is model - dependent , is being used to illustrate the various distributions and should be replaced as more precise data on the decay @xmath1 becomes available , which then can be used directly to determine the form factors @xmath51 and @xmath53 , taking into account the @xmath3-breaking effects .    using the effective hamiltonian approach , and incorporating the perturbative improvements",
    ", we calculate a number of dalitz distributions , the dilepton invariant mass distribution for the individual helicity amplitudes ( and the sum ) , and the forward - backward asymmetry in @xmath4 . as the range of validity of the leet - based estimates in this decay",
    "is restricted to the large-@xmath54 region , we shall restrict ourselves to the low @xmath55-region in the dilepton invariant mass , which for the sake of definiteness is taken as @xmath56 gev@xmath57 .",
    "we shall also neglect the contributions from the long - distance effects to the final state @xmath4 , arising from the process @xmath58 , as they are expected to be tiny due to the ckm - suppression and the small leptonic branching ratios of the vector mesons @xmath59 . to project out the various helicity components experimentally",
    ", one can use the dalitz distribution in the dilepton invariant mass ( @xmath60 ) and @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the polar angle of the @xmath63 meson in the rest system of the @xmath64 meson measured with respect to the helicity axis , i.e. , the outgoing direction of the @xmath64 .",
    "the angular distribution allows to separate the @xmath65-helicity component @xmath66 and the sum @xmath67 . in the sm , and other beyond - the - sm scenarios considered here which have the same operator basis ,",
    "the component @xmath68 is negligibly small .",
    "this holds for both the left - handed and right - handed projections , @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "we show this here in the case of the sm .",
    "hence , for all practical considerations , these components can be ignored and we concentrate on the @xmath71 and @xmath72 components .",
    "we show the systematic improvements in @xmath2 and @xmath73 in @xmath74 and @xmath75 in these decays .",
    "their measurements , in conjunction with the decay distributions in @xmath1 , will serve as precision tests of the flavour sector in the sm , yielding @xmath76 , and in searching for possible deviations from the sm , exemplified here by supersymmetry .",
    "we also work out the decay amplitudes for @xmath77 in the transversity basis @xcite , which has been used by several experimental groups to measure the corresponding amplitudes for the decay @xmath78 @xcite .",
    "these involve the complex amplitudes @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 . the amplitudes in the transversity and helicity bases are simply related @xcite and , having worked them out in the helicity basis , it is a straightforward numerical exercise to work out the moduli and arguments of the amplitudes in the transversity basis . restricting ourselves to low-@xmath55 region ( @xmath82 gev@xmath57 ) ,",
    "we show the results using the leet approach both in the lo and nlo . for illustrative purpose",
    ", we show the amplitudes in the entire kinematically allowed region in the lo .",
    "the leet - based transversity amplitudes for the decay @xmath4 are found to be in reasonable agreement with their measured counterparts in the resonant decay @xmath5 .",
    "measurement of the short - distance component of these amplitudes coming from @xmath4 away from @xmath83 , in particular in the region @xmath84 , will test the underlying leet - based framework .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , we define the effective hamiltonian and the matrix element for the decay @xmath14 . in section 3 , we discuss the form factors in the leet approach for the decay @xmath4 , borrowing heavily from the literature @xcite , give parametrizations for the two remaining form factors @xmath85 and @xmath86 and specify other input parameters in our analysis . in section 4 , we introduce the helicity amplitudes @xmath87 and @xmath88 , give the @xmath2-improved expressions for these amplitudes and write down the dalitz distributions in the set of variables @xmath89 , @xmath90 , and @xmath91 .",
    "the quantities @xmath92 are shown as functions of @xmath55 .",
    "likewise , dalitz distributions in @xmath91 are shown for the two dominant components , @xmath75 and @xmath74 , and adding all three components .",
    "we also show the dilepton invariant mass distributions for the individual helicity amplitudes , and their sum , and the forward backward asymmetry , making explicit the @xmath2 improvements .",
    "section 5 describes the amplitude decomposition for @xmath93 in the transversity basis .",
    "we show the amplitudes @xmath94 , @xmath95 and @xmath96 , as well as the relative phases @xmath97 and @xmath98 , making explicit the @xmath2 improvements in these quantities . extrapolating the lo results for these quantities to the @xmath99 mass , we compare them with data on @xmath100 . in section 6 , we turn to the decay distributions in the decay @xmath101 , and display the various helicity components , dalitz distributions , and the dilepton ( @xmath102 ) invariant mass .",
    "estimates of the @xmath103 leet form factors @xmath104 and @xmath105 , which are scaled from their @xmath106 counterparts incorporating su(3)-breaking , are also displayed here .",
    "section 7 is devoted to the determination of the ratio of the ckm matrix elements @xmath107 from the ratio of the dilepton mass spectra in @xmath108 and @xmath4 decays involving definite helicity states .",
    "in particular , we show the dependence of the ratio @xmath109 and @xmath10 , involving the helicity-0 components , on the ckm matrix elements @xmath110 .",
    "section 8 is devoted to an analysis of the ratios @xmath10 and @xmath111 to probe for new physics in the decay @xmath4 , and illustrate this using some specific supersymmetric scenarios .",
    "finally , section 9 contains a summary and some concluding remarks .",
    "at the quark level , the rare semileptonic decay @xmath112 can be described in terms of the effective hamiltonian obtained by integrating out the top quark and @xmath113 bosons : @xmath114 where @xmath115 are the ckm matrix elements @xcite and @xmath116 is the fermi coupling constant .",
