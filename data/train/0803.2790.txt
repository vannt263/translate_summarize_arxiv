    "low surface brightness galaxies ( lsbs ) remain among the most intriguing galaxies . defined as galaxies having disk central surface brightness fainter than ( @xmath7 ) 22.0 , for example @xcite . ]",
    "mag arcsec@xmath8 , they are a product of low stellar density .",
    "lsbs typically have ( 1 ) large amounts of atomic gas in the form of hi @xcite and ( 2 ) low star formation rates ( sfrs ) .",
    "in general they have sub - solar metallicity , in agreement with the low sfrs @xcite and consequently the weak production of metals . also , lsbs have usually large mass to light ratios , indicating that disk dynamics is dominated by significant amounts of dark matter halos .",
    "this is consistent with their flat rotation curves , which in many cases extend to several times the optical radii .",
    "a key questions about lsbs is what physical conditions prevent the gas from forming stars .",
    "is this due solely to the fact that the gas is not dense enough to trigger gravitational collapse and form stars ? is the amount of molecular gas too low to ensure significant stellar formation episodes ?",
    "how different is the co - to - h@xmath4 conversion factor x = [ n(h@xmath4)/w(co ) ] in lsbs compared to the value derived for high surface brightness galaxies ( hsbs ) in preventing their h@xmath4 from being discovered using co as a tracer ?",
    "several studies indicate that @xmath9 is a function of metallicity @xcite , and thus it should not be a surprise that in lsbs the conversion factor reaches higher values than those obtained for hsbs . the only way to estimate the amount of molecular gas ( h@xmath4 ) in galaxies is to trace the co emission .",
    "only a small number of detections of 0co and 1co in lsbs have been achieved @xcite . however , a different tracer such as 32 emitted usually by warm co , is necessary to better constrain the gas temperature and density @xcite . here",
    "we report on the detection of 32 in two hsb spirals at the freeman limit mag arcsec@xmath2 @xcite . ] from @xcite , and the nondetection of the same transition in another hsb and two lsbs .",
    "the weak 0co emission in lsbs galaxies ( see references above ) suggests that we search for other @xmath5co lines better suited for warmer environments .",
    "the 32 transition may be more easily detected , since it is excited in warm gas ( e / k=33.2 k , @xcite ) , which is probably present in lsbs due to the lower metallicity and lack of dust which normally shield the uv radiation preventing the excitation of lower co transitions ( 10 - 30 k ) .",
    "the caveat is whether the uv radiation destroys completely the co or allows higher energy transitions such as 32 .",
    "because of its higher characteristic temperature and critical density ( @xmath10 @xmath11 ) , the 32 transition may be more sensitive to warm and/or dense gas involved in stellar formation , a key insight that could explain why most lsbs have small m@xmath12/m@xmath13 ratios .",
    "we have observed five spirals from the sample of @xcite .",
    "all of them are face - on spirals , and therefore the apex beam ( of about 18@xmath14 ) samples their bulges .",
    "two of the five galaxies are _ bonna fide _ lsbs , with disk surface brightnesses fainter than 22.0 mag arcsec@xmath8 ( ugc02921 and ugc02081 ) , and three are hsb spirals ( ngc0521 , pgc070519 , and ngc7589 : see below for details ) .",
    "four of the selected galaxies have measurable near - ir emission , and therefore they have a significant population of low - mass and/or evolved stellar populations . the criteria to choose galaxies were the following :    1 .   _",
    "face - on orientation_.- this minimizes the extinction for optical observations , allowing us to identify directly the sub - mm line width with the pure gas velocity dispersion .",
    "it also minimizes the inclination bias on the estimated disk surface brightness .",
    "2 .   _ the hi mass_.- with the aim of accounting for the atomic gas content as an additional variable , we have selected galaxies with different hi masses . the hi masses vary between @xmath15 and @xmath16 m@xmath17 .    some information worth mentioning about the selected galaxies follows .    * _ ugc02081_.- included in the @xcite catalogue of lsbs and studied by @xcite ( lsb100 ) , it is also in the hipass catalogue @xcite .",
    "it is at @xmath18 km s@xmath2 and has a diameter of 23 kpc .",
    "it also exhibits a tiny bar in the central region .",
    "it has been studied in many optical and near - ir bands , but was not detected by _ iras_. it is not a very massive galaxy in terms of its atomic gas mass @xcite .",
    "its disk central surface brightness ( @xmath7 ) of 22.4 mag arcsec@xmath8 locates this galaxy at the lsb regime .",
    "it has a small bulge of about 190 pc scale length , with colors @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "the near - ir color of the bulge is the same as for the total galaxy , meaning that the bulge stellar populations share their properties with those of the disk . * _ ngc7589_.- classified as an sa by @xcite [ lsb473 in galaz et al .",
    "( 2002 , 2006 ) ] , it has @xmath20 mag arcsec@xmath8 and is therefore an hsb galaxy .",
    "located at @xmath21 km s@xmath2 , it has a diameter of 36.12 kpc and has traces of a disk bar .",
    "the difference between its bulge color ( @xmath22 ) and the disk color ( @xmath23 ) shows that this galaxy has a metal - rich bulge compared to the bulge of other spirals @xcite .",
    "its near - ir bulge color ( @xmath24 ) suggests that the bulge is more metallic than other bulges in spirals @xcite and larger in size , with a scale length of 900 pc ( @xmath7 band ) .",
    "its hi mass of @xmath25 makes it @xmath26 times more massive than ugc02081 . in spite of its absolute magnitude ( @xmath27 mag )",
    ", the galaxy is not detected by _",
    "iras_. * _ pgc070519_.- lsb 463 in @xcite . this sbc galaxy ( @xmath28 km s@xmath2 ) is about 19 kpc diameter .",
    "it has a disk central sb @xmath29 mag arcsec@xmath8 and therefore is also an hsb galaxy .",
    "this galaxy has an absolute magnitude @xmath30 and a color @xmath31 in the bulge and @xmath32 in the overall galaxy .",
    "this implies a bulge with larger metallicity compared to that of the disk @xcite , for a galaxy with also a large hi mass ( @xmath33 ) considering its size .",
    "it is not detected by _",
    "iras_. we note that it also presents a noticeable bar which appears to be clearly `` melted '' with the bulge . * _",
    "ngc0521_.- this is the largest and brightest spiral in our sample ( @xmath34 ) . classified as an sbsc(r ) ( @xmath35 km s@xmath2 ) , has a diameter of @xmath36 kpc , twice that of the milky way .",
    "its central disk surface brightness is @xmath29 mag arcsec@xmath8 , so it is an hsb galaxy . it has visible spiral arms and a prominent bulge with a scale length of 720 pc in the @xmath37 band .",
    "the bulge is quite red ( @xmath38 ) , with almost no difference in color with the overall galaxy ( lsb059 in galaz et al .",
    "the near - ir color @xmath39 suggests a metallic bulge .",
    "it has a large amount of hi ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "however , as discussed below , this is not a large amount considering the remarkable size of the galaxy .",
    "it is detected by _ iras _ in 60 and 100 @xmath41 m , with fluxes of about 0.65 and 3.16 jy , respectively .",
    "it has a noticeable nuclear bar which does not however extend too far through the disk . * _ ugc02921_.- an sab(s)dm galaxy in @xcite ( @xmath42 mag arcsec@xmath8 ) , located at @xmath43 km s@xmath2 ) , it is an lsb galaxy .",
    "it has a diameter of 21 kpc and a large hi mass ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "it present a tiny bar from which two spiral arms are developed .",
    "for apex observations we use the heterodyne receiver apex-2a ( 345 ghz ) , tunable in the frequency range @xmath45 ghz . the receiver noise temperature ( about 60 - 70 k ) is fairly constant over the entire tuning range . the telescope beam size at 345 ghz is @xmath46 arcsec .",
    "we observed the five galaxies between 2006 july and 2007 january , using the chopper wheel calibration technique @xcite , which provides main - beam brightness temperature @xmath47 , after dividing by the main beam efficiency @xmath48 .",
    "the typical noise system temperature during the observation was @xmath49 k. the total on source integration time was 2 hr on average , with a velocity resolution per channel of 0.11 km s@xmath2 .",
    "we tuned the receiver to the corresponding redshifted 32 line .",
    "data reduction was done with the gildas - class package ( http://www.iram.fr/iramfr/gildas ) ; for each galaxy all spectra were added and a linear baseline subtracted .",
    "the final spectrum for each galaxy was smoothed to obtain a velocity resolution of @xmath50 km s@xmath2 and an rms noise temperature @xmath51 mk .",
    "therefore , the typical noise temperature _ per channel _ is about @xmath52 mk .",
    "figure 1 shows final smoothed and summed spectra . only for galaxies",
    "ngc0521 and pgc070519 we detected 32 emission .",
    "a gaussian fit was applied to each spectrum and the parameters of the fit are summarized in table [ values ] .",
    "detections are defined for signals above 3@xmath53 , where @xmath54 mk is the rms noise temperature .",
    "galaxies ngc7589 , ugc02081 , and ugc02921 do not present 32 emissions larger than the detection threshold .",
    "driven by the uncertainty in the co - to - h@xmath4 conversion factor for spirals in general , we use an approach similar to that of @xcite to compute the h@xmath4 masses for ngc0521 and pgc070519 and the corresponding upper limits for ngc7589 , ugc02081 , and ugc02921 .",
    "therefore , we assume a 0co to 32 ratio of 1 .",
    "this is a reasonable approach considering , for example , the ratio of about 1.2 obtained , on average , by @xcite for a sample of dwarf galaxies . @xcite",
    "obtained similar figures , with a ( 3 - 2)/(1 - 0 ) @xmath55 for the centers of spirals .",
    "co velocity dispersions are @xmath56 km s@xmath2 for ngc0521 and 73 km s@xmath2 for pgc070519 .",
    "since these galaxies are face - on , the velocity width would correspond to the intrinsic velocity dispersion of the 32 emission . in both cases , and given the similar sizes of the corresponding bulges and the antenna beam , the velocity dispersions would simply correspond to that of the co embedded in the respective bulges . note that the velocity dispersions are @xmath57 times larger than those typically observed for hi in the central regions of spirals @xcite .",
    "we suspect that this large width is due to velocity fields induced by the bars observed in ngc0521 and pgc070519 ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "such behavior was also observed by @xcite , who obtained similar values for @xmath58 . in table",
    "[ values ] we indicate the 32 line velocity width and also the hi velocity dispersion .",
    "we note the high value also for w(hi ) in ngc0521 , strongly indicating the presence of a strong velocity field .",
    "note that all the other galaxies present large velocity dispersions in hi , suggesting therefore a likely large value for the velocity dispersion of their molecular gas .    from the gaussian fits we determine the integrated intensity i@xmath59 , and the intensity at the peak of the emission ( in mk , see table [ values ] ) .",
    "using the method of @xcite and the formula of @xcite @xmath60d_b^2i_{co},\\ ] ] where @xmath61(pc ) is the telescope beam diameter at the distance of the source and @xmath62 is the total co line integrated intensity ( k km s@xmath2 ) , we estimate the h@xmath4 mass for galaxies with positive 32 detections ( ngc0521 and pgc070519 ) . for galaxies with negative detections (",
    "ugc02081 , ugc02921 and ngc7589 ) we estimate upper limits using @xmath63 in k km s@xmath2 .",
    "we assume that @xmath64 , the average velocity dispersion between ngc0521 and pgc070519 , that is , 80 km s@xmath2 .",
    "we think this value is more realistic than just using an arbitrarily smaller value , since ugc02081 , ugc02921 , and ngc7589 also present bars .",
    "thus @xmath65 , the number of channels used in the smoothed spectra .",
    "therefore @xmath66 for non - detections ( ugc02921 , ugc02081 and ngc7589 ) , we use @xmath67 mk for all the corresponding spectra .",
    "thus , @xmath68 k km s@xmath2 . using the corresponding beam diameter in pc for all galaxies ,",
    "as seen at the distance of each galaxy , we obtain estimated h@xmath4 masses for ngc0521 and pgc070519 , and upper limits for ugc02921 , ugc02081 , and ngc7589 ( see eq . [ 1 ] and table [ values ] ) .",
    "it is worth noting that we do detect 32 for ngc0521 and pgc070519 , but do not detect it for ngc7589 , which is 0.2 mag arcsec@xmath8 _ brighter _ than these two galaxies , suggesting that factors other than surface brightness must play a key role in the 32 emission .",
    "table [ values ] presents @xmath69 masses .",
    "note that these values are computed assuming that molecular gas is uniformly distributed through galaxies , which we know is not the case , and in all galaxies , the beam was pointed to the bulge . as shown in table [ values ] , h@xmath4 masses derived from detections are @xmath70 m@xmath17 .",
    "the estimated upper limit for the molecular mass in the beam size of galaxies with no detections is @xmath71 m@xmath17 . with these values",
    "we are able to compute the molecular - to - atomic gas mass fractions for each galaxy ( again , only upper limit estimates for galaxies with no detections ) .",
    "the results agree with the picture that lsbs lack significant amounts of molecular gas and , in general , with small molecular - to - atomic mass ratios ( below 0.08 ) . for one case ( ngc0521 )",
    "the molecular - to - atomic gas fraction appear as large as 0.9 .",
    "although surprising , this result could be anticipated given its small hi mass considering its large size .",
    "in other terms , the molecular gas content for ngc0521 is comparable to its atomic one .",
    "note that we do not detect 32 for three but instead for two hsbs and do not detect any co for both of the lsbs .",
    "how could one explain this puzzling picture ?",
    "although the central disk sb of these galaxies seems to play a role in the co emission , we suspect that other factors are key in allowing such an emission .",
    "looking in detail at the structure of the galaxies , we note that ngc0521 and pgc070519 have much more prominent bars really competing with the bulge emission , compared to the other three galaxies ( see fig . 1 and also figures in galaz et al .",
    "2006 ) , including ngc7589 , which is 0.3 mag arcsec@xmath8 _ brighter _ than ngc0521 and pgc070519 .",
    "we suggest that strong velocity fields could be responsible for the molecular emission in lsbs .",
    "we detect 32 in 2 of 5 nearby spirals , using the apex submillimeter telescope .",
    "the emission is detected for ngc0521 and pgc070519 , both hsb galaxies lying at the freeman limit .",
    "the other galaxies , with no detections , share similar morphology and orientation , but two are lsbs ( ugc02921 and ugc02081 ) and one an hsb ( ngc7589 ) .",
    "all of them are face - on , making the internal extinction negligible .",
    "the measured main - beam temperature co fluxes are 1.20 k km s@xmath2 for ngc0521 and 0.76 k km s@xmath2 for pgc070519 .",
    "the remaining galaxies have fluxes below 3@xmath53 , and thus we are able only to _ estimate _ upper limits for their 32 fluxes ( @xmath72 k km s@xmath2 )",
    ".    measured velocity dispersions for ngc0521 and pgc070519 are 89 and 73 km s@xmath2 , respectively , @xmath57 times typical values obtained by other authors for bulges in spirals @xcite .",
    "we suspect that in these cases the gas velocity field is dominated by the bar kinematics @xcite .",
    "bars are observed actually in all five galaxies , but those of ngc0521 and pgc070519 appear as the more prominent ones .",
    "we compute the total h@xmath4 mass in the main beam , obtaining @xmath73 and @xmath74 for ngc0521 and pgc070519 , respectively .",
    "the corresponding molecular - to - atomic gas fraction is about 0.9 and 0.08 .",
    "the high value for ngc0521 is probably due to its low hi density , and to the assumption that the hi is uniformly distributed over the whole galaxy optical size .",
    "in fact , in spirals one expects that the hi is mostly distributed along the disk .",
    "overall , we have shown that 32 emission could be intense for some galaxies at the sb `` freeman limit . ''",
    "moreover , such an emission could be `` dynamically boosted '' by bars , helping to warm the co and allowing the 32 transition at 33 k above the ground level .",
    "although we have no detections of 32 for the lsbs in this sample , we speculate that many lsbs could present 32 emission given some dynamical conditions that warm the gas ( or make it denser ) .",
    "we speculate that many lsbs with no 0co or 1co emission could have instead 32 emission thanks to the poor uv shielding favored by the low metallicity and low dust content , allowing a higher gas temperature .",
    "this emission , which in principle could be small , may be largely amplified by secular processes which warm the gas .",
