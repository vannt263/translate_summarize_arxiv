    "the question then is the internal variables . in quantum world , particles have intrinsic spins . are those spins consistent with einstein s lorentz covariance ?",

    ".massive and massless particles in one package .",

    "the second row of this table indicates that the spin symmetry of slow particles and the helicity - gauge symmetry of massless particles are two limiting cases of one covariant entity called wigner s little group .",
    "this issue has been extensively discussed in the literature  @xcite .",
    "let us then concentrate on the third row of table  [ table11 ] .",
    "after einstein formulated his special relativity , a pressing problem was to see whether his relativistic dynamics can be extended to rigid bodies as in the case of newton s sun and earth and their rotations .",
    "as far as we know , there are no statisfactory solutions to this problem . however , according to quantum mechanics , these extended objects are wave packets or standing waves .",

    "plane waves are running waves .",
    "as for localized objects , like the sun or earth , we have to consider standing waves .",
    "standing waves are superposition of running waves in opposite directions",
    ". do those superpositions remain invariant under lorentz boosts ?",
    "this is the question we wish to exploit from the 1971 paper of feynman , kislinger and ravandal  @xcite .    in discussing standing waves ,",

    "this equation has many different solutions satisfying different boundary conditions .",

    "quantum field theory gives a calculational tool called the s - matrix . in the early 1960s",
    ", there was a movement in the physics community to start with the s - matrix , instead of complicated field theory , in spite of its field theoretic origin .",
    "this proposal was based on analytic properties of the s - matrix , and on the premise that the physics can be formulated in terms of singularities in the complex plane .    while the s - matrix deals primarily with scattering states , bound states can be found from the poles in the negative - energy region .",
    "this is indeed the case for nonrelativistic potential scattering .",
    "therefore there was a movement to understand bound - state problems using analytic properties of the s - matrix .    in order to see what happened in this approach",

    "while it is trivial to lorentz - boost running waves , it requires covariance of boundary conditions to understand fully standing waves . in sec .",

    "the neutron - proton mass difference has for thirty years been believed to be electromagnetic in origin , and it offers a splendid experimental test of any theory which tries to cover the borderline between electromagnetic and strong interactions .",
    "however , no convincing theory of the mass - difference had appeared before 1964 . in this connection",
    "i exclude as unconvincing all theories , like the early theory of feynman and speisman , which use one arbitrary cut - off parameter to fit one experimental number .",
    "dashen for the first time made an honest calculation without arbitrary parameters and got the right answer .",
    "his method is a beautiful marriage between old - fashioned electrodynamics and modern bootstrap techniques .",
    "he writes down the equations expressing the fact that the neutron can be considered to be a bound state of a proton with a negative pi meson , and the proton a bound state of a neutron with a positive pi meson , according to the bootstrap method . then into these equations he puts electromagnetic perturbations , the interaction of a photon with both nucleon and pi meson , according to the feynman rules .",

    "how can we extract probability interpretation from this covariant wave function ?",
    "it is a widely accepted view that hadrons are quantum bound states of quarks having localized probability distribution . as in all bound - state cases ,",
    "this localization condition is responsible for the existence of discrete mass spectra .",
    "the most convincing evidence for this bound - state picture is the hadronic mass spectra which are observed in high - energy laboratories  @xcite .    in 1969 , feynman observed that a fast - moving hadron can be regarded as a collection of many `` partons '' whose properties appear to be quite different from those of the quarks  @xcite .",
    "for example , the number of quarks inside a static proton is three , while the number of partons in a rapidly moving proton appears to be infinite .",
    "the question then is how the proton looking like a bound state of quarks to one observer can appear different to an observer in a different lorentz frame ?",
    "feynman made the following systematic observations .",
    "* the picture is valid only for hadrons moving with velocity close to that of light . *",

    "if the quarks have the four - momenta @xmath22 and @xmath23 , we can construct two independent four - momentum variables  @xcite @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the total four - momentum and is thus the hadronic four - momentum .",

    "the lorentz squeeze properties of these wave functions are also the same .",
    "this aspect of the squeeze has been exhaustively discussed in the literature  @xcite .",
    "when the hadron is at rest with @xmath29 , both wave functions behave like those for the static bound state of quarks . as @xmath18 increases ,",
    "the wave functions become continuously squeezed until they become concentrated along their respective positive light - cone axes .",
    "let us look at the z - axis projection of the space - time wave function .",
    "indeed , the width of the quark distribution increases as the hadronic speed approaches that of the speed of light .",
    "the position of each quark appears widespread to the observer in the laboratory frame , and the quarks appear like free particles .",
    "the momentum - energy wave function is just like the space - time wave function , as is shown in fig .",
    "[ parton ] .",
    "the longitudinal momentum distribution becomes wide - spread as the hadronic speed approaches the velocity of light .",
    "this is in contradiction with our expectation from non - relativistic quantum mechanics that the width of the momentum distribution is inversely proportional to that of the position wave function .",
    "our expectation is that if the quarks are free , they must have their sharply defined momenta , not a wide - spread distribution .",
    "however , according to our lorentz - squeezed space - time and momentum - energy wave functions , the space - time width and the momentum - energy width increase in the same direction as the hadron is boosted .",
    "this is of course an effect of lorentz covariance .",

    "after all these qualitative arguments , we are interested in whether lorentz - boosted bound - state wave functions in the hadronic rest frame could lead to parton distribution functions .",

    "the agreement is excellent , but the agreement is not satisfactory for small values of @xmath7 . in this region , there is a complication called the `` sea quarks . ''",
    "however , good sea - quark physics starts from good valence - quark physics . figure  [ hussar ] indicates that the boosted ground - state wave function provides a good valence - quark physics .",

    "<S> based on feynman s lifetime efforts on quantum mechanics and relativity , it is concluded that the basic difference between field theory and string theory is that field theory is based on running waves while string theory should deal with standing waves in the lorentz - covariant regime .    at the 1970 spring meeting of the american physical society held in washington , dc , r. p. feynman stunned the audience by proposing harmonic oscillators for relativistic bound states , instead of feynman diagrams . </S>",

    "<S> in so doing , they started with the lorentz - invariant differential equation for the harmonic oscillator , and obtained lorentz invariant solutions . </S>",
    "<S> however , their solutions are not normalizable in the time - separation variable and can not carry probability interpretation . </S>",
    "<S> it is pointed out that there are solutions normalizable in the time - separation variable within the framework of wigner s little - group representation of the poincar group . </S>",
    "<S> these solutions are not invariant but covariant under lorentz transformations . </S>",
    "<S> these solutions give a covariant bound - state model which gives the quark model and the parton model as two different limiting cases , in the low- and high - speed limits respectively .    * </S>",
