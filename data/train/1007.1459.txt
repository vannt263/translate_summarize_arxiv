    "the formation and evolution of galaxies in the universe is accompanied unavoidably by the emission of radiation .",
    "all this radiated energy is still streaming through the universe , although much is now at longer wavelengths due to redshifting and absorption / re - emission by dust .",
    "the photons mostly lie in the range @xmath3  0.1 - 1000  @xmath1 m , ultraviolet ( uv ) , optical , and infrared ( ir ) , and produce the second most energetic diffuse background after the cosmic microwave background , thus being essential for understanding the full energy balance of the universe .",
    "we will account in this work for the radiation accumulated by star formation processes through most of the life of the universe , plus a contribution from active galactic nuclei ( agns ) to this wavelength range , known as the diffuse extragalactic background light ( ebl ) .",
    "the direct measurement of the ebl is a very difficult task subject to high uncertainties .",
    "this is mainly due to the contribution of zodiacal light , some orders of magnitude larger than the ebl ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "there are some measurements in the optical ( @xcite ) and in the near - ir ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , but there is not general agreement about the reliability of these data sets ( @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , these near - ir data appear to give intensity levels for the ebl in contradiction with the observation of very high energy ( vhe , 30  gev-30  tev ) photons from extragalactic sources ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . little is known about the mid - ir from direct detection due to the higher contamination from zodiacal light at those wavelengths .",
    "measurements with the far - infrared absolute spectrometer ( firas ) instrument on board the cosmic background explorer , in the far - ir ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , are thought to be more reliable .",
    "other observational approaches set reliable lower limits on the ebl , such as measuring the integrated light from discrete extragalactic sources ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "there are also other authors that focus on studying galaxy properties based on ebl results ( @xcite ) , or on modeling a region of the ebl spectrum ( @xcite ) .",
    "on the other hand , there are phenomenological approaches in the literature that predict an overall ebl model ( between 0.1 - 1000  @xmath1 m and for any redshift ) .",
    "these are basically of four kinds :    1 .",
    "forward evolution , which begins with cosmological initial conditions and follows a forward evolution with time by means of semi - analytical models ( sams ) of galaxy formation , @xcite , @xcite ( hereafter , sgpd10 ) and @xcite ( hereafter , gspd10 ) .",
    "backward evolution , which begins with existing galaxy populations and extrapolates them backwards in time , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ( hereafter , frv08 ) .",
    "evolution of the galaxy populations that is inferred over a range of redshifts .",
    "the galaxy evolution is inferred here using some quantity derived from observations such as the star formation rate ( sfr ) density of the universe , kneiske et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "evolution of the galaxy populations that is directly observed over the range of redshifts that contribute significantly to the ebl . the present paper , which we term empirical , belongs in this category .",
    "the type ( i ) sgpd10 and gspd10 models discuss the same galaxy formation sam but in different contexts : sgpd10 contains details of the model used in calculating the bolometric luminosity history of the universe and comparison with data , and gspd10 focuses on the derived ebl and @xmath0-ray attenuation . the sgpd10-gspd10 model is based on an updated version of the semi - analytic theoretical approach described in @xcite from the growth of super - massive black holes and their host galaxies within the context of the hierarchical lambda cold dark matter ( @xmath4cdm ) cosmological framework .",
    "this is based in part on @xcite , @xcite , and in the simulations summarized by @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "we consider that these types of models are complementary to the observational approach taken here .",
    "we consider the type ( ii ) frv08 model the most complete observationally - based work of those mentioned above .",
    "they base their ebl modeling on galaxy luminosity functions ( lfs ) , quantities which are directly observed and well understood .",
    "frv08 exploit a variety of data to build evolutionary schemes according to galaxy morphology .",
    "they account for the contribution from early , late - type galaxies and a starburst population to the ebl .",
    "they use observed near - ir lfs from the local universe to @xmath5 for describing the early and late - type galaxies . for the starburst population they use an optical and only local lf .",
    "different prescriptions are used to extrapolate the evolution of the different morphological types to higher redshifts , and corrections to fit their results to other observational data are applied .    type ( iii ) models are not directly based on galaxy data .",
    "instead , they are built from some parametrization of the history of the sfr density .",
    "this is a quantity derived using several different methods , each of which have different and signitficant uncertainties and biases .",
    "the sfr density is combined with uncertain assumptions about the emitted galaxy spectral energy distribution ( sed ) evolution as well .",
    "our type ( iv ) ebl estimates ( the first approach in this category ) will be compared in detail with the type ( i ) forward evolution semi - analytical galaxy formation model by sgpd10 and gspd10 , and the type ( ii ) oservationally motivated model by frv08 .",
    "the other works mentioned are briefly compared with our ebl calculations in sec .",
    "[ discussion ] .",
    "our aim in this paper is to develop an ebl model that is as observationally - based and realistic as possible , yet fully reproducible , including a quantitative study of the main uncertainties in the modeling that are directly due to the data .",
    "this constrains the range of the background intensity and its implications to @xmath0-ray astronomy .",
    "one important application of the ebl for @xmath0-ray astronomy is to recover the unattenuated spectra of extragalactic sources .",
    "our goal is to measure the ebl with enough precision that the uncertainties due to the ebl modeling , in these recovered unattenuated spectra , are small compared with other effects such as systematic uncertainties in the @xmath0-ray observations .",
    "examples of this are discussed in sec .",
    "[ attenuation ] .",
    "our model is based on the rest - frame @xmath2-band galaxy lf by @xcite ( hereafter , c10 ) and on multiwavelength galaxy data from the all - wavelength extended groth strip international survey ( aegis , @xcite ; @xcite ) of about 6000 galaxies in the redshift range 0.2 - 1 .",
    "these data sets are put together in a very transparent and consistent framework .",
    "the c10 lf is used to count galaxies ( and therefore to normalize the total ebl intensity ) at each redshift .",
    "the lf as well as our galaxy sample are divided in three magnitude bins according to the absolute rest - frame @xmath2-band magnitude faint , middle , and bright ( defined quantitatively later ) . within every magnitude bin a sed - type is statistically attached to each galaxy in the lf assuming sed - type fractions that are function of redshift within those magnitude bins .",
    "this is estimated from fitting our aegis galaxy sample to the 25 galaxy sed templates from the swire library .",
    "then , luminosity densities are calculated from these magnitude bins from every galaxy population at all wavelengths , and finally all the light at all redshifts is added up to get the overall ebl spectrum .",
    "the results are linked with @xmath0-ray astronomy and with the current understanding on galaxy evolution .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section  [ data ] describes the lf , our multiwavelength galaxy catalogue and the galaxy templates .",
    "section  [ method ] explains our methodology .",
    "the results for galaxy sed - type fractions , luminosity densities , sfr densities , ebl buildup , and ebl intensities are given in section  [ results ] .",
    "section  [ attenuation ] shows the attenuation computed from our ebl model for some vhe sources taken from the literature . in section  [ discussion ] our results are discussed including a detailed study on the uncertainties from the modeling , a comparison between our observationally - based ebl and that given by theoretical sams of galaxy formation .",
    "finally , in section [ summary ] a summary with our main results and conclusions is presented .    throughout this paper , a standard @xmath4cdm cosmology",
    "is assumed , with matter density @xmath6 , vacuum energy density @xmath7 , and hubble constant @xmath8  km  s@xmath9mpc@xmath9 .",
    "the evolving galaxy lf in rest - frame @xmath2-band provided by c10 from @xmath10 to 4 is used .",
    "this evolving lf is the most accurate measurement to date of cosmological galaxy evolution in the near - ir , where dust absorption is less severe than in optical bands .",
    "the @xmath11-corrections in this band are less severe than in the optical as well .",
    "the choice of the c10 lf to normalize the model is also based on the smooth and well - studied shape of the galaxy seds in the near - ir , unlike others in uv or mid - ir wavelengths .",
    "the resulting evolving lf is based on the ukidss ultra deep survey ( @xcite ) , which has a large area and depth , and hence reduces the uncertainties due to cosmic variance and survey incompleteness .",
    "we refer the reader interested in details to that work .",
    "it is important to note that they give a parametrization of the evolution of the lf corrected from incompleteness and fitted by a schechter function ( @xcite ) over redshift , @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is rest - frame @xmath2-band absolute magnitude at redshift @xmath14 .",
    "the strongest assumption that they make is to keep constant the faint - end slope @xmath15 in their parametrization .",

    "we are aware that this imf is not as good description of the observations as other imfs such as @xcite , but we are concerned here on showing a comparison with the compilation of sfr data , which is given by a salpeter imf . the data from @xmath17 are roughly reproduced .",
    "our results are in agreement within errors with the upper data envelope from @xmath18 .",
    "we systematically predict a factor @xmath19 higher sfr than the observational data between @xmath20 . for the _ high - starburst _ assumption",
    "a considerably higher sfr density is estimated .",
    "this _ high - starburst _ case is motivated by the increasing star formation rate density to @xmath21 in fig .",

    "[ fig12 ] also indicates that our _ high - starburst _ is an extreme assumption .",
    "we want to call attention to the large uncertainties on the observational data estimates for the sfr for all redshifts .",
    "these uncertainties are especially important for the higher redshifts , mainly because local calibrations are used in the estimations , and also the uncertainties of the corrections due to dust absorption .",
    "the same is true for eq .  [ star ] which is calibrated using observed local galaxy properties and",

    "it is usual to consider data from galaxy counts as lower limits .",
    "we find a very low background from uv to mid - ir , along the lower limits from galaxy counts . in the uv our model is lower than the @xcite data , but we consider these data suspect , due to very poor statistics on their number counts at the faintest magnitudes and the fact that they are systematically higher than the uv data from galex ( @xcite ) , an experiment with higher sensitivity and better statistics .    in the mid - ir region between 7 - 15  @xmath1 m our results are a factor @xmath22 higher than other models . a lower background than frv08",

    "the high flux we predicted in the far - ir ( in comparison gspd10 ) is a characteristic of the swire galaxy seds we use , given by the grasil code which is used to calculate the far - ir emission , and the relation between the near - ir and the far - ir in the templates .    in the same figure",

    "all the possibilities are calculated and the extreme cases are plotted . the uncertainties from the uv up to the mid - ir",
    "are dominated by the errors in the photometry and the cuts .",
    "the directions from both effects are different : the uncertainties from the photometry are below the _ fiducial _ model , the uncertainties from the cuts are above it . in the far - ir the uncertainties in the extrapolations to @xmath31 dominate with a factor @xmath23 .",

    "we note as well that the far - ir peak in the sed is higher relative to the near - ir peak at these redshifts ; this is due to the fact that a large fraction of the energy radiated from starburst systems is at far - ir wavelengths .",

    "more recent ebl models with a more transparent universe ( such as our model , frv08 and gspd10 ) relax such predictions .",
    "the solutions to exponential spectra and photon pileup could involve widespread problems with the photon statistics and systematic uncertainties in the observations ( as suggests the results from the later reanalysis ) , or new mechanisms extending the normal ssc model , using external regions close to the @xmath0-ray source with target photons .",

    "the uncertainties are around a factor of several .",
    "the uncertainties in the ebl - corrected spectra up to such high energies due to the ebl modeling are considerable .",

    "[ attenu ] ) with longer wavelengths .",
    "observations of sources at low redshift but energies larger than @xmath80  tev will set constraints on these uncertainties .",

    "the results are sensitive to the limit choice in @xmath87 and @xmath88 ( where the errors in the catalogue are the lowest ) , but not for the other bands .",
    "the galaxy sed - type fractions change for lower limits 1 - 6% , but there is little change if the level is set higher than 6% .",
    "the change is mostly for the quiescent and star - forming galaxy fractions .",
    "if we use the errors in the catalogue without any change , we find 10% more quiescent galaxies at @xmath89 than for a lower limit of 6% , which decreases to @xmath90 more quiescent galaxies at @xmath91 than for a lower limit of 6% , as shown in fig .",
    "the change is mostly in ell2-type galaxies , according to the swire classification .",
    "we have investigated those quiescent galaxies that change their best fit to star - forming galaxies upon raising the lower limit on the errors , and find that they are often fitted much better by a star - forming sed . in many cases they even have detection in mips  24 , clearly indicating ongoing star formation . on the other hand , based on the comparison of our photometric measurements to those of other catalogues we estimate that any error in the photometry lower than @xmath92 should not be considered very reliable . for those reasons we set the lower limit at 6% for model .",
    "the uncertainties due to this are below the _ fiducial _ model in fig .",
    "[ fig13 ] , and for the reasons stated an ebl in this region should not be considered very likely ( and therefore , neither is their derived attenuation in fig .",

    "another source of uncertainty accounted for in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig13 ] is the @xmath30 cut that separates good and bad sed fits .",
    "the main change occurs for agns , where for a relaxation in the cut ( from @xmath93 to 20 ) , the fraction can increase by as much as 10% at @xmath91 , and by a smaller fraction at @xmath89 .",
    "these changes affect the ebl in the following way : higher agn fractions increase the uv as well as the mid - ir , while higher quiescent fractions decrease the flux at those wavelengths .",
    "this effect affects the uncertainties above the _ fiducial _ model and an ebl intensity in this shadow region is considered more reliable than the region below the _ fiducial _ model ( the same for their derived attenuation in fig .",
    "[ fig17 ] ) .",
    "while @xmath30 cuts do not have an appreciable effect on the far - ir flux , there is a substantial change arising from the choice of extrapolation in sed - types above @xmath94 , as we find in the _ high - starburst _ assumption .",
    "[ fig13 ] also accounts for the uncertainties in the schechter parameters of the lf given by c10 but these are small .    two major potential problems for",

    "it was already shown in sec .",
    "[ sec3.2 ] that the colour - selection effect is rather small . from the fact that most of the light in the ebl comes from the knee of the lf around @xmath95 , where our sample does not suffer any color - dependent selection effect",
    ", we do not consider this to be a significant problem for our ebl calculation .",
    "our estimated galaxy sed - type fractions appear to be consistent with works by others as well . for example , our results agree with @xcite and @xcite , who find roughly no evolution for late - type ( blue ) galaxies from @xmath96 within a 10% range , and an increment of the early - type ( red ) population in the same redshift range by at least a factor 2 .",
    "we also highlight that the galaxy sed - type fractions that we calculated for the local universe smoothly link with our independently - derived results at @xmath97 .    regarding the galaxy sed - type fraction extrapolations , we have considered two rather different approaches which basically lead to the same evolving luminosity densities and ebl for the optical / near - ir range where @xmath0-ray attenuation occurs , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] and fig .  [ fig14 ] , respectively .",
    "this fact is due to the shape of the stellar emission , because the contribution to the optical / near - ir peak is very similar for quiescent , star - forming and starburst galaxies for a given @xmath98 .",
    "we recall here that the normalization to our model is fixed by the rest - frame @xmath2-band lf by c10 .",
    "the only difference between our extrapolations is at the far - ir peak , where our results are considered to be less robust for this reason , as well as for the reasons stated below regarding the swire templates and the lack of photometric data .",
    "deeper observations by future galaxy surveys will help in characterizing the galaxy sed - fractions up to higher redshifts .",
    "it was also checked how the fractions change if the detection limit is relaxed from @xmath99 to @xmath100 for the bands where there are observations , but no detections .",
    "many more quiescent galaxies than in the @xmath99 case were found , even a factor larger than 2 , due to the low detection limit on the mips  24 instrument , but generally they are not good fits .    in our work",
    "we have not differentiated between the spectroscopic and secure photometric redshifts .",
    "this is an approximation , and it is necessary to check that this is consistent with our results .",
    "we find that the galaxy sed - type fractions derived from both sub - catalogues are clearly compatible and the trends are the same .",
    "galaxies fitted to a starburst sed may instead be very late - type star - forming galaxies ( or viceversa ) , because both sed templates are rather similar in the regions where we have data .",
    "this may be called mis - typing and its effect is expected to be larger for faint galaxies , because the major fraction of faint galaxies are star - forming or starburst and not massive quiescent or agn galaxies .",
    "such small galaxies are probably rather metal poor and thus lacking dust .",
    "hence , their seds are probably more like star - forming galaxies rather than starbursts ( in agreement with our results in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] ) .",
    "it is a source of uncertainty in the mid and far - ir ( underestimating or overestimating light ) and might explain the excess found in fig",

    "far - ir data would help in resolving this issue , but the number of galaxies with detection in mips  70 is rather low to make statistical estimations .",
    "herschel data will be very useful thanks to its good spatial resolution and deep photometry in the far - ir .",
    "another source of uncertainties in our model that quantitatively we have not accounted for arises from the use of local sed templates to fit galaxies at @xmath101 .",
    "this comes from the fact that the swire templates are based on observations of local galaxies , and we expect that they become worse fits when the redshift is increasing .",
    "this problem will be addressed by new data from wfc3 on hubble space telescope and the next generation of ground and space optical / near - ir telescopes such as the james webb space telescope .    the lowest ebl flux in fig .  [ fig13 ]",
    "is given by the case with the highest number of quiescent galaxies and lowest number of agn galaxies , which corresponds to the case of using the low errors in the catalogue and our @xmath30 cuts .",
    "the highest ebl flux occurs with fewer quiescent galaxies and the highest fraction of agn galaxies .",
    "this is the case with the 6% lower limit for the errors in the photometry and without a @xmath30 cut . using the lower limits from galaxy counts in the uv and in the optical we may rule out at @xmath102 the mixing of galaxy sed - type fractions predicting the highest fractions of quiescent galaxies and fewest agns in fig .",
    "we do not consider the vhe observations to exclude the models with higher far - ir , because the discrepancy is for wavelengths longer than 60  @xmath1 m where those limits may not be reliable for the reasons stated in sec .",
    "[ attenuation ] .",
    "further vhe observations might indeed constrain our galaxy sed - type fractions .    thus to recap , the ebl uncertainties from the uv up to the mid - ir are low enough to recover the spectra of @xmath0-ray sources with energies lower than @xmath80  tev , but the ebl uncertainties have to be reduced in the far - ir ( for neglecting uncertainties due to the ebl modeling ) to correct higher energy sources .",
    "additional photometry is needed there to clearly distinguish between star - forming and starburst galaxies , therefore to reduce the mis - typing , as well as a better understanding on the far - ir region of the galaxy seds at @xmath101 . characterizing the galaxy sed - type fractions at @xmath31 will reduce these uncertainties in the far - ir as well .",

    "it was calculated that the population with sed features of quiescent local galaxies increases a factor @xmath79 since @xmath94 .",
    "the star - forming population remains roughly constant , while the starburst - like population decreases very quickly from around @xmath128 at @xmath94 . the agn - like population decreases slower than the starburst - like population from almost 20% at @xmath94 to just around 2% at @xmath97 .",
    "data from the future james webb space telescope will help to determine the galaxy sed - type fractions at @xmath31 .    a low intensity local ebl ( @xmath10 )",
    "was found , matching the lower limits from galaxy counts up to @xmath129  @xmath1 m . for longer wavelengths ,",
    "our model predicts higher intensities than the data from galaxy counts , in agreement with direct measurements .",
    "our results are also compatible with all the upper limits from @xmath0-ray astronomy according to the standard framework for the propagation of vhe photons through the universe , even though to account for the highest energies detected by @xcite for mrk  501 we have to assume a @xmath130 , appeal to statistical and systematic uncertainties on this vhe spectrum , or attenuation uncertainties due to uncertainties in the ebl for such high energies as discussed in sec.[attenuation ] .",
    "the ebl uncertainties in far - ir leading to attenuation uncertainties of a factor of several for energies larger than @xmath80  tev needs to be addressed by the current and next generation of ir telescopes providing new photometric data and a better understanding of the galaxy ir emission .",
    "@xmath0-ray astronomy may constrain these uncertainties from a better understanding of the emission mechanisms at those high energies ( helped with simultaneous multiwavelength observations ) and of the instrumental systematic uncertainties .",
    "observations aimed to measure photons with energies higher than @xmath80  tev at @xmath131 are encouraged .",
    "it is worth mentioning that high energy ( 30  mev-30  gev ) @xmath0-rays are detected by fermi for @xmath132 from agns ( @xcite ) and for @xmath133 ( @xcite ) from grbs .",
    "the reasons for these high redshift detections include a larger @xmath0-ray flux at lower energies and a lower density of ebl target photons that can interact with these @xmath0-rays .",
    "understanding the evolution of the ebl at uv wavelengths is essential to interpreting observations of these high - redshift sources .",
    "new observations of agns as well as the first grb detection in the vhe range would help to make new and stronger constraints on the ebl ; see @xcite .",
    "the universe , according to our observationally - based model , is more transparent than the estimation from frv08 ( a factor @xmath76 in flux ) for vhe photons coming from low - redshift sources ( @xmath134 ) for energies between @xmath135  tev , but still the uncertainties here from the ebl modeling are large ( a factor of several ) .",
    "the same attenuation than frv08 is estimated for other energies .",
    "for vhe photons coming from larger - redshift sources ( @xmath94 ) , roughly the same attenuation as frv08 is estimated . here the attenuation uncertainties ( for energies available to @xmath0-ray telescopes ) due to the uncertainties on the ebl modeling are low in comparison with other effects . at these redshifts",
    "the uncertainties on the ebl - corrected spectra are dominated by instrumental systematic uncertainties .",
    "we may conclude that it is not expected to observe any such high redshift ( @xmath94 ) multi - tev @xmath0-ray photons from blazars with the current or even next telescope generation such as the cherenkov telescope array ( cta , @xcite ) or the advanced gamma - ray imaging system ( agis , @xcite ) , but we indeed expect a promising future for sub - tev detections at these high redshifts .",
