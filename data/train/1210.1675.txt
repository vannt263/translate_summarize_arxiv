    "spin systems with geometrical frustration have both fundamental and practical importance . theoretically , lots of interesting phenomena have been found in the geometrically frustrated systems , like the antiferromagnetic triangular lattice , kagome lattice .",
    "the systems can remain disordered even at absolute zero temperature because of the competitive magnetic interactions .",
    "for example , an antiferromagnetic triangular lattice has a residual entropy @xmath2 per unit cell  @xcite .",
    "the frustration effect has important application in achieving a lower temperatures through the adiabatic demagnetization compared with other methods .",
    "when the temperature , external magnetic field , and other factors are considered , the geometrically frustrated systems can show very rich phase diagrams .",
    "@xcite a typical case is that the magnetocaloric effect can be enhanced near the phase transition points when a finite external field is applied .",
    "@xcite of considerable interest has been searching for geometrically frustrated systems .",

    "@xcite    in 2007 , a new class of geometrically frustrated magnetic materials polymeric iron ( iii ) acetate  @xcite was fabricated , in which fe ions form a two - dimensional lattice referred as star lattice .",

    "@xcite the critical temperature @xmath9 was given with @xmath10 .",
    "the bose - hubbard model on the star lattice has also been studied using the quantum monte carlo method .",
    "@xcite recently , the edge states and topological orders were found in the spin liquid phases of star lattice .",
    "@xcite even though the @xmath11 quantum heisenberg model is considered to be appropriate to help studying the new material because of its quantum fluctuations in the ground state ,  @xcite the ising model on the star lattice is still very important especially for the non - uniform case . in real materials , the fe ion has @xmath8 which is close to the classical limit and the magnetic system shows two types of interactions .",
    "@xcite therefore , it is important to study ising spins on the star lattice with the asymmetric interactions , especially for the frustrated case .    in this paper",
    ", we aim at the thermodynamics of ising spins on the star lattice with asymmetric interactions using the exact analytic methods and monte carlo simulations .",

    "in there is no long range order found , it means that at least one kind of nearest neighbor couplings is antiferromagnetic in the material .",
