    "in quantum information several entropic functionals ( the so called quantum capacities ) have been introduced that provide a sort of  inverse measures \" of the noise level associated with a given process , see e.g. refs .  @xcite . in this approach the evolution of the system of interest @xmath1",
    "is described as a linear , completely positive , trace preserving mapping ( cpt ) , the quantum channel @xmath2 , which associates a final state @xmath3 to each possible initial density matrix @xmath4 of @xmath1 .",
    "the quantum capacities of @xmath2 have a clear operational meaning as they gauge the optimal communication transmission rates achievable when operating in parallel on multiple copies of @xmath1 : consequently the noisier the channel is , the lower are its associated quantum capacities",
    ". unfortunately however , even for small systems , these quantities are also extremely difficult to evaluate since require optimization over large coding spaces ,  e.g. see ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "in this paper we introduce an alternative way to determine how disruptive a channel might be which , while still having a simple operational interpretation , it is easier to compute than the quantum capacities .",
    "the starting point of our analysis is to use entanglement - breaking ( eb ) channels  @xcite as the fundamental benchmarks for evaluating the noise level of a transformation .",
    "we remind that a map operating on a system @xmath1 , is said to be entanglement - breaking if for all its extensions to an ancillary system @xmath5 it annihilates the entanglement between the system and the ancilla @xcite . from the point of view of quantum information",
    ", the action of these maps represents hence the most disruptive form of noise a quantum mechanical system can undergo . a reasonable way to quantify the noise level of a generic map @xmath2",
    "can then be introduced by computing how much extra noise we need to  add \" to it before the resulting transformation becomes entanglement - breaking .",
    "the intuitive idea behind this approach is that channels which are less disruptive on @xmath1 should require larger amount of extra noise to behave like an entanglement - breaking map .    in the following we analyze two different mechanisms of noise addition .",
    "the first one assumes to form convex combinations @xmath6 of the input channel @xmath2 with generalized completely depolarizing channels @xmath7 ( these are the most drastic examples of entanglement - breaking channels which bring every state of @xmath1 into a unique output configuration @xmath8  the fixed point of the map ) . in this approach",
    "the level of noise associated with the original map @xmath2 is gauged by the minimum value @xmath9 of the mixing parameter @xmath10 which transforms @xmath6 into an entanglement - breaking map ( as we will see a proper characterization of this measure requires an optimization upon  @xmath8 ) .",
    "the second mechanisms of noise addition we consider assumes instead the reiterative application of @xmath2 on @xmath1 . in this case",
    "the noise level is determined by the minimum value @xmath11 of iterations needed to transform @xmath2 in an entanglement - breaking map ( _ if _ such minimum exists ) .",
    "as we shall see , due to the lack of monotonicity under concatenation with other maps , this second functional can not be considered a proper measure of the noise level introduced by @xmath2 ( regularized version of @xmath11 _ do _ however retain this property ) .",
    "nonetheless @xmath11 captures some important aspects of the dynamics associated with @xmath2 : namely it counts the number of discrete time evolutions induced by the map that a system can sustain before its entanglement with an external ancilla is completely destroyed .",
    "the definition of @xmath11 gives us also the opportunity of introducing the set @xmath12 of the entanglement - breaking channels of order @xmath0 , and the notion of _ amendable _ channels .",
    "the former is composed by all cpt maps @xmath2 which , when applied @xmath0 times , are entanglement - breaking .",
    "vice - versa a channel @xmath2 is amendable if it can be prevented from becoming entanglement - breaking after @xmath11 iterations via a proper application of intermediate quantum channels  a similar problem was also discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in the following",
    "we will discuss some general features of the functional @xmath9 and @xmath11 computing their exact values for some special class of channels . specifically in sec .",
    "[ sec : critmu ] we introduce the functionals and characterize some general properties . in sec .",
    "[ sec : qubit ] we will restrict our attention to qubit channels computing the value of @xmath9 and @xmath11 for the set of unital maps and for the generalized amplitude - damping channels . also using examples from these sets we will show that the set @xmath12 is not convex for @xmath13 and provide evidence of the existence of amendable maps . in sec .",
    "[ sec : gaussian ] we will consider the analogous of qubit maps for continuous variable systems , that is one - mode gaussian channels , and in particular we will evaluate the functional @xmath11 for attenuation and amplification channels .",
    "conclusions and final remarks are given in sec .",
    "[ par : summary and conclusions ] .",
    "it is a well known @xcite fact that any entanglement - breaking channel @xmath14 can be described as measure and re - prepare scheme according to which the system @xmath1 is initialized in some state @xmath15 depending on the outcome @xmath16 of a measurement performed on the input state @xmath4 , i.e. @xmath17=\\sum_{\\ell } \\rho_\\ell { \\mathrm{tr } [ } f_\\ell\\rho]\\;,\\ ] ] ( here @xmath18 are the elements of the positive operator valued measure ( povm ) which defines the measuring process ) .",
    "these maps can not be used to convey quantum information even in the presence of two - way classical side channel ( of course they might allow to achieve this goal when the communicating parties are given some prior shared entanglement via teleportation ) . in this respect they can thus be considered as  classical \" communication lines ",
    "notice however that they might be used to create _ quantum discord",
    "_  @xcite .",
    "one can easily verify that the set eb formed by the entanglement - breaking channels is closed under convex combinations and under sequential concatenation , i.e. given @xmath19 $ ] and @xmath20 , @xmath21 we have @xmath22 and @xmath23 [ here  @xmath24 \" stands for the composition of super - operators defined in sec .  [ moncon ] ] .",
    "more generally , it also true that the set @xmath25 is stable under concatenation with other ( non necessarily entanglement - breaking ) maps , i.e. @xmath26      a proper subset of the eb channels is provided by the completely depolarizing maps , which transform any input state @xmath4 of @xmath1 into an assigned fixed point @xmath27 ,  i.e. @xmath28= \\rho_0 { \\mathrm{tr } [ } \\rho]\\;.\\ ] ] ( we indicate with @xmath29 the set of density matrices of  @xmath1 ) . in a sense , these maps form the hard core of the eb set which prevents any sort of communication ( not even classical ) .",

    "here we used the symbol @xmath36 to represent the density matrix @xmath37 associated with the maximally entangled state @xmath38 , @xmath39 being an orthonormal basis of the hilbert space of the system @xmath1 , and @xmath40 being its dimension .",
    "we remind that the specific choice of such basis is completely irrelevant when constructing the choi - jamiolkowski state .",
    "the quantity  ( [ eq : semimuc ] ) measures the amount of @xmath30 we need to mix to @xmath2 via a classical stochastic process in order to make the resulting map entanglement - breaking .",
    "clearly @xmath31 nullifies if @xmath2 is already an element of eb .",
    "vice - versa for non entanglement - breaking channels @xmath2 the value of @xmath31 is always non null and in general might depend on the selected @xmath30 ( some of the properties of @xmath31 are discussed in appendix  [ appendixa ] ) .",
    "to get a functional of @xmath2 alone we need hence to optimize with respect to the possible choices of the fix point @xmath8 .",
    "this brings us to define the function @xmath41 which constitutes our first ( inverse ) measure of the noise level associated with @xmath2 . solving the minimization in eq .",
    "( [ eq : muc ] ) is not simple in general : still in the next section we shall see that for some classes of channels which possess special symmetries this is feasible . here",
    "we present some basic properties of the functional @xmath42 .",
    "given @xmath2 and @xmath43 cpt transformations we have @xmath44 with ",
    "@xmath24 \" being the composition of super - operators such that for all @xmath4 we have @xmath45=\\phi[\\psi[\\rho]]$ ] .",
    "property  ( [ prop3 ] ) is almost straightforward .",
    "indeed for all @xmath46 there exists a density matrix @xmath47 such that @xmath48 is separable . since for every @xmath49 cpt the state @xmath50 is still separable , @xmath51 which implies @xmath52 .",
    "property  ( [ prop4 ] ) can be proved analogously .",
    "indeed if @xmath53 there exists a depolarizing channel @xmath54 such that @xmath55 thus , if we apply this map to the state @xmath56 we get a separable state , and property  ( [ prop4 ] ) is immediately proved .",
    "an almost trivial consequence of the above inequalities is the fact that @xmath9 is constant under unitary transformations , i.e. @xmath57 where @xmath58 and @xmath59 stands for unitary channels , i.e. @xmath60 with @xmath61 being unitary .      by definition @xmath42",
    "is always positive ( it nullifies if and only if @xmath62 ) and smaller than  @xmath63 . as a matter of fact , it is possible to show that @xmath64 the upper bound being achieved for noiseless ( unitary ) channels . to see this we first use the fact that the generalized werner states @xmath65 + \\mu\\ ;   \\frac{\\openone}{d } \\otimes \\frac{\\openone}{d}\\ ] ] are separable iff @xmath66  @xcite .",
    "therefore since @xmath67 is the choi - jamiolkowski state of the identity channel @xmath68 this implies , @xmath69 now the bound  ( [ upperbound ] ) can be easily established by noticing that @xmath70 where the first inequality is just a consequence of the definition  ( [ eq : muc ] ) while the second one follows from the fact that the choi - jamiolkowski state @xmath71 can be obtained from @xmath67 via the application of a local channel , i.e. @xmath72 $ ] . remains to show that the threshold value  ( [ eq : muc ] ) is achievable for unitary channels , i.e. @xmath73 thanks to the property  ( [ prop5 ] ) we can just focus on the case @xmath74 for which we have already established the condition  ( [ identity1 ] ) . to prove the relation  ( [ boundachi ] )",
    "we need hence only to verify that @xmath75 for all @xmath8 .",
