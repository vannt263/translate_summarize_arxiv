    "by nature , glassy systems are dynamically slow , with relaxation times found to increase rapidly as the temperature @xmath2 is lowered @xcite .",
    "one consequence of this slow down is the difficulty in probing the dynamics of such systems in the long time regime through means of numerical simulation .",
    "traditional numerical methods often become insufficient to obtain data within a realistic time frame thanks to time scales growing at best exponentially with inverse temperature and in most cases much faster . a common algorithm used for systems close to dynamical arrest",
    "is the rejection free algorithm known as the `` n - fold way '' , or continuous time ( ct ) monte carlo @xcite .",
    "while ct can provide an impressive improvement over standard monte carlo ( mc ) , it can still become inefficient for some extremely slow systems .",
    "the natural generalization of the ct algorithm is novotny s monte carlo with absorbing markov chains ( mcamc ) @xcite , which so far has been mainly used to study magnetic reversal . in this paper",
    "we show how to apply the mcamc method to simulate kinetically constrained models ( kcm ) of glass formers @xcite , in particular , facilitated spin models such as the fredrickson - andersen ( fa ) model @xcite and the east model @xcite in arbitrary dimensions .",
    "we show that in the case of east models the mcamc method allows to improve simulation times , both for equilibrium and out - of - equilibrium dynamics , by several orders of magnitude at low temperatures .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ mcamc ]",
    "we outline the mcamc technique .",
    "section [ east ] provides a detailed analysis of its application to the one - dimensional east model . in section [ approx ]",
    "we discuss several important approximations which allow to maximise the computational gain .",
    "the method is generalized to the east model in arbitrary dimensions in section [ alld ] , and , in section [ xover ] , to models that interpolate between the east and fa cases @xcite .",
    "section [ highers ] describes faster , higher level versions of mcamc . in section [ tests ] we present speed tests of the algorithms . in section [ results ]",
    "we show some illustrative results obtained with the mcamc method , including a study of the @xmath2 dependence of relaxation times in the east model for dimensions @xmath0 to @xmath1 .",
    "we conclude in section [ conclu ] discussing the possible implementation of the method to simulate other kcms .",
    "continuous time monte carlo works well for systems where the vast majority of moves are most likely to be rejected due to kinetic or energy constraints @xcite . in order to avoid constantly attempting and failing to make a move , as in standard mc , in ct one fast - forwards the system , always accepting moves , and updating the clock by how long it would have taken in standard mc",
    "this can speed things up greatly in systems with slow dynamics because making an unfavourable move can take a long time .",
    "the trouble with most slow systems is that often after an unlikely move , even in the ct scheme , the most likely move is to undo what has just been done before . with the mcamc method of novotny @xcite , instead of just fast forwarding to when one is accepted",
    ", one can fast - forward to when two ( or more ) unlikely moves have been accepted , updating the clock appropriately . to do this whilst keeping the dynamics exact and keeping to detailed balance one must use the formalism of absorbing markov chains @xcite ( see @xcite for a pedagogical review ) .    in an mc algorithm",
    "any given move depends only on the two states that the system is moving between and not on any previous moves .",
    "this is by definition a markov process and allows us to treat the mc algorithm as a markov chain @xcite .",
    "a markov chain is characterised by the matrix @xmath3 which defines transition probabilities between states .",
    "if the vector @xmath4 indicates the probability distribution of the system after iteration @xmath5 , the probability distribution at the next step @xmath6 is given by @xmath7 .",
    "we define an absorbing markov chain by separating the available states into @xmath8 transient states and @xmath9 absorbing ones @xcite .",
    "the system always starts in a transient state and by successive applications of the markov matrix explores the transient subspace until it lands in an absorbing ( or exit ) state from where it can not leave .",
    "we can divide the general state vector @xmath10 into absorbing and transient parts , to get the @xmath11-dimensional vector @xmath12 where @xmath13 contains the transient states . the initial state in this form",
    "must obey @xmath14 . with this structure",
    "the markov matrix can be written in the form , @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the identity matrix , @xmath17 is the zero matrix and subscripts indicate the size of each matrix .",
    "the positions of the identity and zero matrices guarantee that if the system falls into an absorbing state then it does not leave . the transient matrix , @xmath18 ,",
    "gives the probabilities for moving between transient states and the recursive matrix , @xmath19 , gives the probabilities for moving from the transient states to the absorbing states .",
    "for a given starting vector @xmath20 the probability of still being in the transient subspace , @xmath21 , after @xmath5 steps is @xmath22 where @xmath23 is a vector with all elements equal to 1 .",
    "the probability of absorbing to a particular state after @xmath5 steps is given by summing over the probabilities of absorbing at each time step .",
    "this gives the vector @xmath24 , @xmath25 if the exit has taken place at step @xmath5 , then the probabilities of absorbing into the different exit states is given by : @xmath26    here it is convenient to introduce the fundamental matrix @xmath27 which can be used to obtain the probability that the system will absorb to a particular state irrespective of when it exits , @xmath28 the fundamental matrix can also be used to determine the average time to leave the transient subspace @xcite @xmath29    once our system is in the initial state we can generate an exit time by solving the inequality @xmath30 where @xmath31 is a random number between 0 and 1 .",
    "next , we use a second random number to choose an absorption state from the distribution in equation ( [ pm ] ) and then we can update the system appropriately . the new state will become the initial state in another absorbing markov chain , and so on . a successful mcamc algorithm will choose transient states such that the system tends to move between them many times before exiting .",
    "the mcamc algorithm has been used in the study of magnetic reversal and nucleation in systems such as the ising model , see e.g. @xcite . in the case of magnetic reversal , for example",
    ", there is a well defined initial transient state corresponding to the metastable configuration in which all spins are aligned in one direction .",
    "this state represents a deep minimum in the energy : on reversing a single isolated spin the overwhelming likelihood is that the system will immediately relax back to the initial state .",
    "an mcamc algorithm with two transient states ( @xmath32 ) overcomes this problem : the system can escape from the metastable configuration by insisting that two spins are flipped simultaneously ; this process is characterised by two transient states , the metastable configuration and that corresponding to a single spin flip @xcite .",
    "kinetically constrained models ( kcms ) are frequently used to study the dynamical behaviour of glass formers @xcite . of particular interest is the analysis of relaxation times and the emergence of length - scales @xcite .",
    "similarly to the magnetization reversal problem above , at low temperatures or high densities , these systems evolve by falling into deep energy or free energy traps from which it is difficult to escape .",
    "the difference , however , is that there is a multiplicity of trapping states , not just one as in the ising model case , which change as the system evolves dynamically . in order to apply the mcamc method to kcms one needs to identify the nature of the transient states in these systems .    as an example consider the east model in one - dimension @xcite .",
    "the east model consists of a chain of ising spins , @xmath33 , upon which a directional facilitation constraint is imposed : a given spin @xmath34 may only flip if its nearest neighbour to the left is in the excited state , @xmath35 .",
    "the rates for allowed moves are such that the equilibrium distribution is that corresponding to the energy function @xmath36 ( we set @xmath37 from now on ) , @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "the result is a model in which excitations propagate in the eastward direction .",
    "the east model has been found to reproduce the dynamic behaviour of fragile glassy materials @xcite .    from the rate equations above",
    "one can see that it is energetically unfavourable to excite a down spin the process becoming increasingly unlikely as temperature is decreased .",
    "consider a configuration with only isolated excitations : @xmath41 when in this state the only choice is to excite a spin and pay the accompanying energy penalty .",
    "consequently it is highly likely that the raised spin is immediately relaxed , hence returning to the previous state .",
    "this is analogous to the all - up configuration of the ising model example .",
    "it is important to note that in this isolated state all excitations must be separated by a minimum of two unexcited spins .",
    "when separated by only a single spin there are two possible outcomes from the creation of an excitation , i.e. one can create a double state @xmath42 or a triplet @xmath43 .",
    "this produces an unnecessary complication since the algorithm can no longer be classified by two simple transient states .",
    "by analogy to the ising model one may define two transient states for the system , the isolated configuration described above and states in which a single excitation pair exists .",
    "however , unlike the case of magnetic reversal , it is clear that neither of the transient states identified for the east model are unique .",
    "it is possible to construct numerous configurations which satisfy the above criterion , in essence we have identified two classes of transient state .",
    "once again the absorbing states consist of all configurations attainable by the excitation of two spins , either forming two isolated doubles or a triplet state , @xmath44 @xmath45 for the east model it is possible to classify each lattice site according to its local neigbourhood .",
    "taking a site along with its nearest and next - nearest neighbour to the right , each site can be classed according to a binary labelling scheme , i.e. @xmath46 , @xmath47 , etc . , where the number of sites in each class is , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , etc .",
    "using this notation we define the entry condition for the algorithm with @xmath32 transient states as the point at which the number of sites in class 4 equals the total number of excitations present in the lattice , @xmath50 , i.e. @xmath51 .    before constructing the transient and recursive matrices",
    "it is necessary to determine the probabilities for all possible transitions between the different states .",
    "the transient and recursive states may be labelled as follows , @xmath52 @xmath53 @xmath54 @xmath55 with the following transition probabilities @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the system size",
    ".    these transition probabilities are then used to build the transient and recursive matrices for the system @xmath58 where @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "the absorption probabilities for the @xmath61 and @xmath62 states can be found by taking the fundamental matrix , @xmath63 , and solving equation ( [ prob absorb particular state ] ) giving @xmath64 where we have used an initial state vector @xmath65 .    to determine the exit time one must choose a random number and iteratively solve the inequality given in equation ( [ update time inequality ] ) .",
    "one then proceeds to choose an exit state from the distribution formed by the exit probabilities , equations ( [ prob double ] ) and ( [ prob triple ] ) .",
    "it is clear that matrices @xmath18 and @xmath19 are characterised by the variable @xmath48 and as such both the probability distribution for the absorption states and the exit time are governed by the entry state , each state having its own unique solution .",
    "this @xmath32 construction provides an algorithm that improves on standard continuous time , @xmath66 , by a factor proportional to @xmath67 .",
    "this improvement in computational speed is offset by the algorithmic complexity required to formulate the @xmath32 model .",
    "computationally , the most expensive part of the algorithm as described above is the procedure used to determine the time to exit from the transient state . to perform",
    "the calculation exactly involves diagonalising the @xmath18 matrix and iteratively solving the inequality using the halving method @xcite or something similar .",
    "there are , however , a number of approximations that we can employ to get around this . the exact form for @xmath68 for the @xmath32 case is @xmath69 , \\ ] ] where @xmath70 and @xmath71 , @xmath72 are the eigenvalues of @xmath18 .",
    "both eigenvalues are quite close to ( and less than ) 1 . however , in the limit of large @xmath5 , we have that @xmath73 , allowing us to simplify equation ( [ exact vtme ] ) .",
    "if we drop the restriction that @xmath5 must be discrete then we can write ( [ update time inequality ] ) as an equality , @xmath74 where again @xmath31 is a random number between 0 and 1 . both @xmath75 and @xmath71",
    "depend on @xmath48 and can be stored in a lookup table .",
    "the approximation works best when @xmath5 is large , so for low temperatures ( @xmath76 ) where the time steps are larger it works very well . at higher temperatures one must be careful using this approach .",
    "another possibility is to free oneself from the requirement to pick the update time from a distribution and use instead the average .",
    "this does mark a departure from the exact monte carlo algorithm , but in most cases it turns out to be a reasonable simplification ( it is analogous to the approximation made when going from the n - fold algorithm @xcite to the ct one @xcite ) .",
    "if we take the average time , then we can use equation ( [ average exit time ] ) which requires calculation of the fundamental matrix , @xmath63 , either analytically or numerically .",
    "for the east model , @xmath63 only depends on the number of excitations @xmath50 , so the time updates can be stored in a lookup table allowing for a significant increase in speed .    to check the validity of using the average value for time updates instead of picking them from a distribution , we can use the result @xmath77 with ( [ average exit time ] ) to calculate the mean square fluctuations .",
    "this shows that for lower temperatures the error on any given measurement is @xmath78 .",
    "whilst this seems large it is important to remember that we are always looking at logarithmic time and on this axis the error is less significant .",
    "also there are many iterations between sampling points and the measurements are averaged over many runs which will help to reduce any discrepancy .",
    "all the simulations for this paper were performed using the average time update .",
    "the method described in the previous section can easily be extended allowing one to construct generalised transient and recursive matrices for the east model in any spatial dimension @xmath79 .",
    "considering the transient states for the system it is clear that the @xmath32 algorithm is triggered when all excitations within the lattice are isolated by a region of space which encompasses all moves attainable by two successive spin flips .",
    "the @xmath80 analog of the `` 100 '' above is : @xmath81 where no triangles may overlap if the algorithm is to trigger . as for the @xmath0 case ,",
    "the @xmath18 and @xmath19 matrices are obtained by evaluating the probabilities for all transitions between the transient and absorbing states .",
    "this analysis yields matrices of the following form @xmath82 it is easy to solve for the exit probabilities to each of the absorbing states , where @xmath48 again indicates the number of excitations in the isolated state , @xmath83 the average lifetime to exit from the transient subspace may be obtained from ( [ average exit time ] ) , @xmath84    for systems in which @xmath85 is high and @xmath48 is large compared to @xmath79 , one may approximate the exit time to @xmath86 hence time steps are a factor of @xmath87 smaller than those of the east model in @xmath0 .",
    "the mcamc algorithm described above can also be applied to the fa model @xcite and , more generally , to the model that interpolates between the fa and east models @xcite , which serves as a simple model for fragile - to - strong transitions .",
    "this model is characterised by the rates @xmath88 the limit @xmath89 corresponds to the east model , and the limit @xmath90 , to the fa model .",
    "for intermediate values of @xmath91 the model displays a crossover between east - like dynamics at higher temperature , to fa dynamics at low temperature .",
    "the mcamc algorithm is applied in much the same way as in the east model case , except that now we have to allow for the possibility of movement to the _",
    "west_. in the simplest version , the transient states are the same as for the east model , and the absorption states are increased to include any move to the left .",
    "the result is an @xmath32 , @xmath92 absorbing markov chain , with the following transient states @xmath93 @xmath94 and absorbing states @xmath95 @xmath96 @xmath97 @xmath98 @xmath99 the two states in @xmath100 are the same as far as this algorithm is concerned .",
    "caution would be required if they were to be used as transient states .",
    "the transient and recursive matrices are as follows @xmath101    @xmath102    where @xmath103 , and @xmath104 and @xmath105 are the same as for the east model case .",
    "from here on the procedure is exactly the same as with the east model except that there are more absorbing states to choose from .",
    "one may use eq .",
    "( [ prob absorb particular state ] ) to obtain values for the absorption probabilities .",
    "caution is required as the approximation breaks down in the regime of high temperature and high symmetry ( @xmath106 ) .",
    "it should be noted that , while less striking , even in the fa limit of @xmath107 this algorithm outperforms standard ct .",
    "the entirely isolated state is problematic in terms of the dynamics of the east model . in order to relax the isolated excitations",
    "must propagate in the lattice until they encounter another excitation along the direction of facilitation .",
    "movement of this nature is promoted by the occurrence of branching events , @xmath108    the `` triplet '' absorption state , @xmath62 , is the rate limiting step for branching events , and hence the propagation of excitations in the lattice . however , from the absorption probabilities , eqs .",
    "( [ prob double ] ) and ( [ prob triple ] ) , we see that compared to the @xmath61 state the @xmath62 exit state is suppressed by a factor of @xmath109 . hence , the formation of triplets is unlikely , particularly when the system size is large .    to overcome this problem it is possible to extend the mcamc algorithm to include the @xmath61 state as a transient state of the system .",
    "there are now three transient and three absorbing states , one absorbing state corresponds to the @xmath62 state of the @xmath32 algorithm , the remainder corresponding to configurations attainable from the new transient state . in one dimension",
    "one can represent the states as follows , @xmath110 @xmath111 @xmath112 @xmath113 @xmath114 @xmath115    once again the transient and recursive matrices may be constructed by considering all possible transitions between the states . @xmath116 the @xmath32 transient matrix , eq .",
    "( [ ts2 ] ) , is now a submatrix of @xmath18 ; the addition of an extra transient state has appended one extra row and column to the matrix , the rest of the structure remaining intact .    unlike the case of @xmath32",
    ", it is not so simple to generalise the @xmath117 matrices for any dimension .",
    "this arises from the non - equivalence of the @xmath118 state in dimensions @xmath119 , i.e. in two dimensions @xmath120 when considered as absorption states the two configurations above may be treated identically since the probability of exiting to each state is the same .",
    "however , as transient states each configuration has different exit probabilities and as such must be treated independently .",
    "in essence , one requires an @xmath121 algorithm to provide the equivalent result in dimension two and above .    returning to the @xmath0 example , we find that the @xmath62 is now the most likely absorption state .",
    "this is because all other exit states require the excitation of an additional spin , i.e. , they are suppressed by a factor of @xmath122 .",
    "solving for the average lifetime gives @xmath123 hence , @xmath117 improves on @xmath32 by a factor of @xmath48 . while this may seem a modest enhancement in performance , note that the extra algorithmic complexity required to develop @xmath117 is negligible .",
    "having made a working @xmath32 algorithm one may essentially use @xmath117 for free .    as ct enables one to obtain an @xmath122 speed increase over traditional mc",
    ", @xmath32 enables one to achieve a further improvement of @xmath122 over ct . in effect",
    ", @xmath32 enables one to bypass all @xmath122 processes ( i.e. those that involve the excitation of a single spin ) by insisting that two successive spins are excited .",
    "the double and triplet states of the @xmath32 model are examples of @xmath124 processes . in order to construct an algorithm with a further @xmath122 speed gain",
    "requires one to identify all of the @xmath124 arrangements and include them as transient states .",
    "this means that the absorption states now correspond to all configurations attainable from the transient states which result in the simultaneous excitation of three spins .",
    "this analysis leads to an @xmath125 algorithm consisting of seven transient and seven absorbing states .    in one dimension ,",
    "@xmath125 may be triggered when all excitations within the lattice are separated by at least three unexcited spins , i.e. @xmath126 . to maximise performance",
    "it is useful to use a hybrid algorithm consisting of @xmath66 , @xmath127 and @xmath128 components with each sub - algorithm activated by its own triggering condition .    in order to improve algorithmic efficiency",
    "it is convenient to compute absorption probabilities using eq .",
    "( [ prob absorb particular state ] ) rather than the exact form of eq .",
    "( [ pm ] ) . unlike the case of @xmath32 , where it may be shown that two expressions are identical , for higher order algorithms the solution of eq .",

    "one must employ caution when using this approach . for both @xmath117 and @xmath125",
    "it has been shown that the approximation is good for all regimes in which the algorithms are effective , the approximation breaking down at higher temperatures .",
    "in the low @xmath2 limit , the average exit time from an @xmath32 mcamc algorithm iteration for the east model is approximately @xmath129 . the corresponding average time step for standard",

    "2 shows the cpu time , now for different system sizes , at fixed temperature and total mc time @xmath138 .",
    "again , the cpu time for such a simulation using ct is constant . as expected , fig .",
    "2 shows that as @xmath57 becomes larger the mcamc algorithms are less and less effective ; beyond @xmath139 the ct scheme works better .",
    "this means that in order to maximise the mcamc efficiency one needs to simulate the smallest possible system sizes .",
    "this is limited by the need to be compatible with bulk behaviour , which in the case of facilitated models requires that the system in average contains a sufficient number of excitations , i.e. , @xmath140 can not be too small .",
    "as a function of inverse temperature @xmath141 in the east model in dimensions @xmath142 . the lines through the data points are quadratic fits , @xmath143 , with @xmath144 fitting parameters .",
    "the fit suggests that @xmath145 in general .",
    "the bottom - right panel shows @xmath146 as a function of @xmath79 .",
    "this coefficient seems to go as @xmath147 , with the constant @xmath148 ( shown as a full line ) .",
    "this value is between @xmath149 ( dotted line ) and @xmath150 ( dashed line ) . ]    in this section we present an example of numerical results obtained with the mcamc .",
    "a useful correlation function to study the relaxation of facilitated models is the persistence function @xmath151 , e.g. @xcite , which gives the probability that a site has not changed its state up to time @xmath152 . in terms of the local persistence field @xmath153 ,",
    "where @xmath154 indicates that site @xmath155 has not flipped up to that time , and @xmath156 that it has flipped at least once , the persistence function reads @xmath157 .",
    "in contrast to standard mc or ct simulations , the mcamc algorithm could run into problems when trying to measure persistence . by construction",
    ", it misses some of the events that could occur whilst in the transient subspace , for example , from the isolated state many spins could flip up and then flip back down before finally exiting to an absorbing state . at low temperatures in equilibrium , however , the contribution of these events is negligible , as the vast majority of changes to the global persistence function is from existing excitations spreading out into unmoved territory , and this is captured by the mcamc algorithm .",
    "in fact , the only sites one needs to be concerned with are those immediately next to the initial excitations , which are very few in equilibrium at low @xmath2 .",
    "figure 3 shows the equilibrium persistence time @xcite , @xmath158 , of the east model in various dimensions @xmath79 , calculated using the mcamc algorithm with @xmath32 .",
    "for all dimensions studied we find that @xmath158 is a super - arrhenius function of @xmath2 .",
    "this seems to indicate that the east model is a fragile in all dimensions .",

    "the mcamc proves also useful when simulating out - of - equilibrium dynamics .",

    "an @xmath32 mcamc enables one to push simulations one plateau further than ct ( @xmath66 ) , the @xmath125 algorithm helps overcome the next energy barrier , and so on .",
    "we have shown that the method of mc with absorbing markov chains , mcamc , of novotny @xcite can be used to dramatically speed up simulations of facilitated spin models of glasses , such as the east and fa models .",

    "@xmath8 even larger computational gains can be achieved .",
    "one could imagine an algorithm where the number of transient states is variable , and at each iteration the @xmath8 with the largest number of transient states allowed by the current configuration , the smallest distance between excitations , is used",
    ".    the next future step would be to adapt mcamc algorithms to other interesting kcms , such as constrained lattice gases @xcite and @xmath168-spin facilitated fa models with @xmath169 @xcite .",
    "several features of these systems make the application of mcamc less straightforward : since their kinetic constraints depend on more than one site , i.e. facilitation by two or more excitations in the fa models or two or more vacancies in the lattice gases , for generic entry states the tree of possible transient states is much larger than for , say , east models .",
    "this means that the computational cost of the necessary bookkeeping will be much higher ( bookkeeping could be simplified by reducing the possible entry states , at the expense of triggering less frequently the mcamc ) .",
    "this problem is compounded by the fact that @xmath170 fa models are very slow even at moderate temperatures , so that the potential exponential in @xmath85 gains from excitation rates are very modest , and may not even be enough to offset the bookkeeping cost  in constrained lattice gases , where barriers are purely entropic , this is bound to be worse . in any case , given that the high density or low temperature dynamics of these systems is in general so much slower than that of east models , a clever mcamc algorithm which overcomes these hurdles could prove extremely useful ."
