    "very luminous x - ray sources with x - ray luminosities ( @xmath2 ) in the range @xmath3@xmath4 ergs s@xmath5 are often binaries with stellar mass black holes or , less frequently , neutron stars as primaries .",
    "in contrast , ultraluminous x - ray sources ( ulxs ) with @xmath6 ergs s@xmath5 are of great interest because their bolometric luminosities surpass the eddington limit for a 100 @xmath7 black hole ( @xmath8 ergs  s@xmath5 ) .",
    "although these unresolved , extragalactic , off - nuclear ultraluminous sources were first discovered with the _ einstein x - ray observatory _ @xcite , systematic studies of ulxs and similar luminous sources have been made possible only recently by the high angular resolution afforded by the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ @xcite .",
    "while some of these objects may be associated with recent supernovae , or in some cases misidentified background active galactic nuclei @xcite , there exist ulxs that exhibit variability over short time scales , indicating a compact nature ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ". these compact ulxs may be binary systems containing black holes with masses of 10@xmath910@xmath10 @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the existence of such intermediate - mass black holes ( imbhs ) is intriguing , as they can not be produced by current stellar evolutionary models .",
    "the hypothesis of a massive accreting black hole nature is supported by spectral analyses of several ulxs whose x - ray spectra can be successfully fitted with a regular or modified disk blackbody model , assuming an optically thick accretion disk @xcite .",
    "it has recently been suggested that thin accretion disks with inhomogeneities may produce fluxes exceeding the eddington limit by factors of 10100 @xcite .",
    "thus stellar mass black hole binaries could account for sources with luminosities up to @xmath11 ergs s@xmath5 .",
    "the more luminous sources with @xmath12 , however , may still harbor imbhs @xcite . alternatively ,",
    "if ulxs radiate in the form of anisotropic  beams \" in the direction of the observer , their luminosities would be sub ",
    "eddington , a proposal that is not entirely implausible as examples exist of beamed galactic x - ray sources @xcite . in this case",
    ", ulxs may contain more conventional black holes or neutron stars with masses @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "the nature of a luminous x - ray source can be ascertained if its optical counterpart can be unambiguously identified @xcite .",
    "for example , m101 ulx-1 is coincident with a b supergiant , and their physical association is confirmed by the unresolved @xmath04686 emission in the stellar spectrum ; thus m101 ulx-1 is most likely a high - mass x - ray binary ( hmxb ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "when optical counterparts can not be uniquely identified , the local stellar population can be used to infer the nature of the sources ; for example , the presence of early - type stars supports a hmxb origin @xcite .",
    "observations of the local interstellar environment can also be used to infer the nature of these luminous x - ray sources @xcite .",
    "luminous x - ray sources are often observed to be surrounded by shell nebulae with diameters reaching up to several hundred parsecs , called  supershells \" ; the x - ray sources may contribute to the expansion and ionization of these nebulae @xcite .",
    "@xcite give two potential scenarios for the formation and expansion of such nebulae .",
    "the first scenario posits that the compact x - ray source and the diffuse nebula were both formed in a single supernova explosion ; the second , that continuous input by stellar winds and/or jets creates a large  bubble \" around the system .",
    "( of course , these scenarios are not mutually exclusive . )",
    "calculations of the energy required to create a supernova remnant , as required by the first hypothesis , equivalent to the observed nebulae around ulxs require explosions of @xmath14 ergs , which has led some authors to suggest these as the remnants of particularly energetic events , called  hypernovae \" ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite offers the more prosaic interpretation that the supernova may have exploded in the low - density surroundings of a pre - existing superbubble , brightening substantially as it hit the superbubble wall ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the second hypothesis , of continuous energy input , encounters a similar problem of high input energies , as well as questions about the lifetime over which such a system will produce strong winds / jets . again , these problems can be largely ameliorated if the system is within a pre - existing cavity .",
    "most importantly , nebulae photoionized by x - rays are  regions \" in which he is present in the he@xmath15 state and its recombination leads to @xmath04686 emission @xcite .",
    "therefore , the distribution of nebular emission and the nebular ionization requirement can be used to assess whether the source emits beamed radiation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "another possibility , as @xcite suggest , is that these nebulae are shock - ionized by same processes that generate the mechanical energy inputs discussed above .",
    "however , in low - density regions this process will have very low efficiency .",
    "a third scenario is that the nebula was flash - ionized in a very energetic explosion , and is still in the recombination stage ; but the lifetime of this phase is not long ( of order @xmath16/@xmath17 , where @xmath17 is the ambient density ) .",
    "all in all , the coupling of energetics between the ulx and the nebula is not well understood",
    ". a critical study of supershells associated with luminous x - ray sources may provide insight into their nature and energetics , just as studies of supershells that are hypernova remnant candidates have been used to assess their energetics and confirm their nature @xcite .",
    "we have obtained high - dispersion echelle spectroscopic observations of the nebular environments of seven luminous x - ray sources .",
    "these data are used to search for emission and to study the kinematics of the surrounding medium .",
    "additionally , we have utilized archival _",
    "hubble space telescope _",
    "( _ hst _ ) images to study the local stellar populations for some of these sources . in this paper",
    ", we report our observations and reduction in  2 , and analyze individual objects in  3 .",
    "the conclusions are summarized in  4 .",
    "high - dispersion spectra of the nebular environments of luminous x - ray sources were obtained with the echelle spectrographs on the 4 m telescopes at kitt peak national observatory ( kpno ) from an observing run in 2003 november and at cerro tololo inter - american observatory ( ctio ) in 2004 january .",
    "the kpno observations were all made in the multi - order observing configuration , using the 79 line mm@xmath5 echelle grating , g226 - 1 cross dispersor , a gg385 filter , the red long focus camera , and a tek2k ccd ( t2 kb ) .",
    "a slit width of 300 @xmath18 m ( 2 ) was used , giving an instrumental fwhm of 18@xmath191 km s@xmath5 in the h@xmath20 line .",
    "the pixel size of 24 @xmath18 m corresponds to @xmath21026 along the spatial axis and 0.082   along the dispersion for the h@xmath20 line .",
    "the observations covered a wavelength range of 45006900  .",
    "the ctio observations were made in both the multi - order / short - slit and the single - order / long - slit observing configurations .",
    "the multi - order configuration used a setup similar to that used in the kpno observations , but with a site2k#6 ccd , which had the same pixel size and thus the same scales as the t2 kb .",
    "these observations covered a wavelength range of 44006900  .",
    "the single - order configuration used the 79 line mm@xmath5 echelle grating with a flat mirror replacing the cross disperser , and a post - slit h@xmath20 filter ( @xmath22 = 6563  , @xmath23 = 75  ) was inserted to isolate a single order .",
    "this spectral coverage is wide enough to include both the h@xmath20 line and the flanking [ ]  @xmath246548 , 6583 lines . for both configurations ,",
    "a slit width of 250 @xmath18 m ( 164 ) was used , and the resulting fwhm of the instrumental profile was @xmath25 km s@xmath5 .    for both the kpno and ctio observations ,",
    "the spectral dispersion was calibrated by a th - ar lamp exposure taken in the beginning of the night , but the absolute wavelength was calibrated against the geocoronal h@xmath20 line present in the nebular observations .",
    "a journal of the echelle observations is given in table  1 .",
    "a total of seven nebulae were observed .",
    "the luminous source lmc x-1 is included to assess the feasibility of our echelle observing configuration , as it is known to possess a region @xcite .",
    "as x - ray sources are not visible , target acquisitions often need to be made through blind - offset from nearby bright stars . the ionized nebulae associated with our target x - ray sources are very faint , so their observations are very sensitive to sky conditions and moonlight .",
    "furthermore , these objects are mostly at megaparsec distances , and have angular diameters of only a few arcseconds .",
    "owing to these difficulties , we missed the key position of two objects , ho ii x-1 and ic 342 x-1 and hence they will be discussed in the appendix .",
    "however , we were able to collect useful h@xmath26 spectra for ho",
    "ix x-1 , ic 10 x-1 , m 81 x-6 , and ngc 1313 x-2 , in addition to lmc x-1 .",
    "these observations are analyzed in this paper .",
    "to study the stellar environments of our sources , we have used the archival _ hst _ continuum images of ho ix x-1 , ic 10 x-1 , m81 x-6 , and ngc 1313 x-2 .",
    "these observations , listed in table 2 , were made with either the wide field planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) or the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) .",
    "the calibrated pipeline - processed images were acquired from the mast archive and photometry was carried out using the apphot package in iraf .",
    "we first analyze our observations of the nebula around lmc x-1 to illustrate the range of capabilities of our observing configuration , such as the ability to detect emission .",
    "we use the same method to analyze the nebulae around luminous x - ray sources and in some cases , we also analyze their stellar populations . below",
    "we report on our detailed analysis of the five objects for which we obtained useful echelle observations .",
    "in addition , two objects for which we missed the key positions are discussed in the appendix .",
    "lmc x-1 is a @xmath2 = 12 @xmath27 ergs s@xmath5 source @xcite in the region n159f which has a size of 24@xmath28 , corresponding to 6 pc at the distance to the lmc , 50 kpc @xcite .",
    "we have n - s and e - w slit positions centered on the star r148 at a position 25 east of lmc x-1 . in each case not only the @xmath04686 line but also the @xmath06560 line was detected ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "the @xmath04686 line is narrow , with an observed fwhm of 0.39@xmath190.07  , or 25@xmath195 km  s@xmath5 .",
    "the observed fwhm consists of contributions from the thermal width ( @xmath2111 km  s@xmath5 for at 10@xmath10 k ) , instrumental broadening , and turbulence in the gas .",
    "quadratically subtracting the thermal and instrumental widths from the observed width , we obtain a turbulent fwhm of 18 km  s@xmath5 .",
    "the turbulence in the nebula photoionized by lmc x-1 is thus of order of 10 km  s@xmath5 , comparable to the isothermal sound velocity of a 10@xmath10 k medium .",
    "there is no highly supersonic motion in the nebula around lmc x-1 .",
    "therefore it does not appear that lmc x-1 is injecting a significant amount of mechanical energy into the interstellar medium .",
    "our echelle observations of the nebula around lmc x-1 illustrate that high - dispersion spectroscopy provides a powerful way to study such objects .",
    "this ulx was first cataloged as m81 x-9 based on _",
    "observations @xcite ; however , it is projected within 2@xmath29 of the nucleus of holmberg ix , corresponding to a projected separation of 2 kpc at a distance d @xmath30 3.6 mpc @xcite , so it has also been referred to as ho ix x-1 .",
    "it is found at a position near the center of an ionized gas shell with @xmath31 @xmath32 km s@xmath5 @xcite .",
    "this velocity is similar to the systemic velocity of holmberg ix , 64 km s@xmath5 , as opposed to the _ negative _ velocities expected for m 81 at this position due to its rotation @xcite . if the ulx is indeed associated with this ionized gas shell , it is likely a member of holmberg ix ; thus , we will call it ho ix x-1 in this paper .      to search for an optical counterpart of ho ix x-1 , we have used archival _ chandra _",
    "acis - s observations ( seq num 600406 , obs i d 4751 ) and _ hst _ acs images listed in table 2 .",
    "we have used six stars in the usno b1.0 catalog to determine astrometric solutions for the acs image , resulting in an rms accuracy of @xmath33 .",
    "our initial comparison of _ chandra _ x - ray images with the _ hst _ optical images shows the centroid of the ho ix x-1 source to be offset by @xmath34 from a bright star at 09@xmath3557@xmath3653@xmath3725 , @xmath3869@xmath3903@xmath29483 ( j2000.0 ) . to verify the alignment of the x - ray and optical images , we searched for other x - ray sources within the acis - s b3 field and their possible optical counterparts .",
    "we found two faint x - ray sources at 9@xmath3558@xmath3606@xmath378 , @xmath3869@xmath3904@xmath29393 ( j2000.0 ) and 9@xmath3558@xmath3612@xmath371 , @xmath3869@xmath3904@xmath29570 ( j2000.0 ) , respectively . at these x - ray positions ,",
    "the acs images show extended objects , possibly galaxies , at an offset of @xmath2105 .",
    "figure 2 shows that the offsets from the x - ray positions to the nearest optical objects are similar for all three x - ray sources .",
    "if we assume that these offsets are caused by pointing uncertainties of _ chandra _ and _ hst _ , ho ix x-1 would be coincident with the aforementioned star within 01 .",
    "therefore , we suggest that this bright star is the optical counterpart of the ulx ho ix x-1 .      the ionized gas shell around ho ix x-1 has been observed by @xcite to have strong [ ] and [ ] line emissions that are characteristic of supernova remnants ( snrs ) .",
    "however , the shell size of 25@xmath40 , corresponding to @xmath41 pc , is much larger than those of known snrs .",
    "it is possible that this shell is energized by an ob association that @xcite describes as a knot of blue stars .",
    "the high - resolution h@xmath20 image presented by @xcite shows a complex nebular morphology consisting of a bright , thin , inner ring and a fainter and broader outer ring ( see fig .",
    "we obtained echelle observations for two slit positions on the supershell around ho ix x-1 : a n - s slit along the eastern rim and a e - w slit from the eastern rim to the center of the shell ( see fig .",
    "nebular emission is detected in h@xmath20 , h@xmath42 , [ ] @xmath244959 , 5007 , and [ ] @xmath246548 , 6583 lines , but not @xmath04686 or @xmath06560 .",
    "the velocity structures appear similar in each of the lines detected , thus we use the strongest detection , the h@xmath20 line , for our analysis of the shell kinematics .",
    "both slit positions show a bright emission component centered at @xmath43 km  s@xmath5 .",
    "this velocity is in good agreement with the velocity of holmberg ix , and is adopted as the systemic velocity of the shell .",
    "the e - w slit position shows faint emission extending up to @xmath44 = + 60 and @xmath4580 km  s@xmath5 from the systemic velocity , while the n - s slit position shows faint emission up to @xmath44 = + 70 and @xmath45100 km  s@xmath5 .",
    "the velocity structure does not resemble that of a simple expansion : the highest velocity offsets along the n - s slit occur at the outer edge of the shell ; the e - w slit shows a brighter blue - shifted component at the inner ring , but it is dominated by a red - shifted component at the outer ring .",
    "the 3-d structure of the shell may be pear - shaped , with the inner ring corresponding to the top of the pear which is expanding toward us ( with a negative velocity ) , and the outer ring corresponding to the base which is expanding away from us ( with positive velocity ) , suggestive of a bipolar expansion structure .",
    "while the expansion structure can not be determined unambiguously , the overall expansion velocity is likely on the order of 80100 km  s@xmath5 .",
    "the h@xmath20 flux of the ionized gas shell has been reported by @xcite to be @xmath46 ergs s@xmath5 @xmath47 .",
    "this h@xmath20 emission requires an ionizing flux of @xmath48 photons s@xmath5 , if the nebula is optically thick ( to ionizing photons ) . assuming that the emitting material is distributed in a prolate ellipsoidal @xmath49 pc shell with a fractional shell thickness ( @xmath50 ) of 0.1 , we estimate the rms density of the shell to be 1.4 h - atom @xmath51 and the shell mass to be @xmath52 @xmath7 . for an expansion velocity of 80 km  s@xmath5 ,",
    "the kinetic energy of the shell is @xmath53 ergs .",
    "to determine the roles played by the local stellar population , and possibly the ulx , in the ionization and energetics of the supershell , we examine the stellar content using the _ hst _ acs images of ho ix x-1 .",
    "we have carried out photometry of stars in the f450w , f555w , and f814w bands , and transformed the results into the vegamag system , which is similar to the johnson @xmath54 system .",
    "we have produced color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) in @xmath55 versus @xmath56 and @xmath55 versus @xmath57 , correcting for only a distance modulus of 27.78 .",
    "the former was found to be more useful because the stars of interest are blue .",
    "this cmd of @xmath55 versus @xmath56 for stars within the shell is presented in figure 4 ( in filled symbols ) , overplotted with evolutionary tracks for massive stars from @xcite .",
    "the highest concentration of stars is distributed near @xmath58 and most likely represents the upper part of the main sequence .",
    "if these are o - stars with @xmath59 , the amount of reddening would be @xmath60 .",
    "we have applied this reddening correction to all stars and plotted them in open symbols in figure 4 .",
    "it is apparent that the main sequence stars detected are within the mass range of @xmath61@xmath62 , suggesting an age of 46 myr for this ob association .    to determine the amount of stellar energy that has been injected into the surrounding medium",
    ", we need to know the number of supernovae that have exploded in the past and the masses and temperatures of the most massive living stars , but this information can not be determined from the photometry alone .",
    "we therefore assume a salpeter initial mass function , and estimate the massive stellar population by extrapolation from the observed main sequence stars in a lower mass range that is not seriously affected by incompleteness .",
    "we then use the relation @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the number of stars , @xmath65 is a constant that can be determined from the star counts , @xmath66 is the mass , and @xmath67 and @xmath68 are the upper and lower mass limits .",
    "five stars are observed to be in the 1220 @xmath7 range , thus we estimate @xmath69 .",
    "the number of stars with mass greater than @xmath70 is @xmath71 , adopting an @xmath72 of 100 @xmath73 .",
    "since we observe only one star with @xmath74 , we estimate roughly six supernovae have likely exploded .",
    "assuming each supernova releases @xmath75 ergs of explosion energy , the total supernova energy input is approximately @xmath76 ergs , roughly half of the observed kinetic energy of the expanding shell . additionally , using starburst99 @xcite , we estimate a collective ionizing luminosity of 0.42.0@xmath77 photons s@xmath5 , only 1/2 of that required by the observed h@xmath20 luminosity of the shell .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the stellar population alone can not provide sufficient energy to produce the observed kinematics and ionization of the nebula .",
    "it is possible that ho ix x-1 supplies the additional required energy .",
    "our echelle spectroscopic observations suggest that there may be a bipolar expansion .",
    "if this is the case , the source may be  beaming \" x - ray emission into the nebula toward and away from us .",
    "as our echelle observations had limited spatial coverage , the suggested bipolar expansion needs to be confirmed in the future with kinematic observations over the full extent of the nebula .      using _ rosat _ hri , ic",
    "10 x-1 was discovered as a rather luminous x - ray source within the optical extent of the galaxy @xcite .",
    "recent _ chandra _ and xmm - newton observations show that ic 10 x-1 has a mean 0.3 - 8.0 kev luminosity of @xmath78 ergs s@xmath5 and shows a large variation by a factor of up to @xmath216 on time - scales of @xmath79 s @xcite .",
    "it was found to be within @xmath80 of the centroid of a nonthermal radio supershell 45@xmath28 in diameter , corresponding to 150 pc at the distance of ic 10 , @xmath81mpc @xcite .",
    "a possible optical counterpart , an emission - line source , was identified as wr star [ mac92 ] 17 @xcite .",
    "this was later resolved into two components , [ mac92 ] 17a and b , of which only the a component is a wr star @xcite .",
    "recent _ chandra _ and _ hst _ observations by @xcite with improved spatial resolution and astrometric accuracy allowed further characterization of the nature of the x - ray source .",
    "they give a j2000.0 position 00@xmath3520@xmath3629@xmath3709 , @xmath3859@xmath3916@xmath295195 for the point source , and report a 0.58.0 kev absorbed flux of @xmath82 ergs @xmath47 s@xmath5 with faint emission extending up to @xmath83 away .",
    "their observations support the association with [ mac92 ] 17a , located within 023 of the x - ray source .",
    "the high luminosity and variability of this x - ray source , and its likely association with the nearby wr star , lead them to hypothesize that the source is most likely a massive bh binary with a progenitor that evolved more rapidly , and would thus have been more massive than [ mac92 ] 17a .",
    "we have carried out photometry using the _ hst _ acs images in the f435w , f606w , and f814w bands , and constructed cmds for a distance modulus of 24.23 .",
    "the cmd of @xmath55 versus @xmath56 for stars in the vicinity of ic 10 x-1 is presented in figure 5a . as ic 10",
    "is located at a low galactic latitude , the foreground extinction due to the galactic plane is evident .",
    "assuming that the bluest stars are main sequence stars with an intrinsic color of @xmath59 , the reddening is @xmath84 .",
    "we have applied this reddening correction to all stars and produced another cmd in figure 5b , along with evolutionary tracks for massive stars @xcite .",
    "the most massive stars in the vicinity of the ic 10 x-1 have masses of 20@xmath85 .",
    "the lack of more massive stars suggests that this stellar population was formed about 46 myr ago .",
    "this age is consistent with the what would be expected from the presence of a wr star , the optical counterpart of ic 10 x-1 .",
    "we obtained n - s and e - w echelle spectra with slit positions centered near ic 10 x-1 using a slit length of 15@xmath28 ( see fig .",
    "no line was detected .",
    "the spectral lines from the e - w slit position were uniform and symmetric and thus were useful in estimating a systemic velocity for the nebula , @xmath45330 km s@xmath5 , close to the systemic velocity of ic 10 , @xmath45344 km s@xmath5 @xcite . we apply this systemic velocity to the n - s spectrum which shows an expansion structure with low velocity at the center of the slit and higher velocities at the edges .",
    "we find an overall expansion velocity @xmath86 km s@xmath5 , somewhat higher than the 5070 km s@xmath5 found by @xcite .",
    "it is not unusual that high - dispersion spectroscopy can detect emission at higher velocities than lower - dispersion spectroscopy .",
    "the velocity structure along the n - s slit position does not represent a regular expanding shell .",
    "this is understandable as the h@xmath20 image in figure 6b shows an irregular , filamentary structure that is best described as a turbulent , frothy interstellar medium .",
    "this interstellar structure may have resulted from the explosion of the most massive stars in the population around ic 10 x-1 .",
    "this interstellar environment is too complex to assign specific features that have been energized by ic 10 x-1 .",

    "the nebular spectra change abruptly across the supershell , with the west side brighter in h@xmath20 emission and the east side higher in [ ] /h@xmath20 ratio @xcite .      to examine the optical counterpart and stellar environment of ngc 1313 x-2 , we have used archival _ _ h__st acs images in the f435w , f555w , and f814w bands .",
    "the exposure times and observation dates of these acs images are given in table 2 .",
    "figure 8 shows the f435w and f814w images along with the h@xmath20 image from @xcite .",
    "we have used stars in the usnob1.0 catalog to determine astrometric solutions for these acs images , resulting in an rms accuracy of @xmath2105 . with our refined acs coordinates , it is easy to identify the optical counterpart of the ulx , as marked on the acs images in figure 8 .",
    "it is also evident that within the h@xmath20 shell , a higher concentration of bright stars exists to the west of the ulx .",

    "we have adopted a distance of 4.1 mpc @xcite , but did not make any extinction correction .",
    "figure 9 shows the @xmath55 vs ( b - v ) cmd plotted with evolutionary tracks of stars of various masses ( from * ? ? ?",
    "the stars are marked in the f555w image in figure 8b .",

    "the second set of f555w images taken three months after the first show a @xmath97 mag variation in @xmath55 .",
    "this variation is small but real .",
    "it is interesting to note that the optical counterparts of m101 ulx-1 and the ulx ngc 5204 are b supergiants , and in the case of m101 ulx-1 the b supergiant shows no detectable photometric variation over a timespan of 13 months @xcite .",
    "the optical counterpart of ngc 1313 x-2 is one of the three brightest blue stars in this region ; these three blue stars are all 79 @xmath7 early b giants .",
    "the fainter blue stars are most likely main sequence stars with masses @xmath98 .",
    "the brightest red star has colors and magnitudes consistent with either a 20 @xmath7 red supergiant in ngc 1313 or a galactic m8 dwarf at a distance of @xmath21160 pc . as there are no blue main sequence stars above 10 @xmath7 in this region of ngc 1313",
    ", we consider the galactic m dwarf a more likely interpretation for this red star .",
    "the stellar population within the supershell is thus at least 10@xmath99 yr old and consequently no longer contains o stars .",
    "the 500 @xmath87 340 pc h@xmath20 shell surrounding ngc 1313 x-2 , if photoionized and optically thick , requires an ionizing flux of @xmath100 photons s@xmath5 , assuming a prolate ellipsoidal shell with a fractional shell thickness of @xmath50 = 0.1 and a density of 1 h - atom @xmath51 .",
    "this ionizing flux exceeds that produced by the observed blue stars , mostly b stars , by two orders of magnitude .",
    "@xcite suggested that the shell is ionized by shocks .    to study the energetics of the supershell around ngc 1313 x-2 , we obtained echelle observations for two slit positions ( figure 8) .",
    "the n - s slit position was observed in the multi - order mode ; broad nebular emission is detected in h@xmath20 , but the s / n ratio is too low for accurate velocity measurements .",
    "the line was not detected .",
    "the e - w slit position was observed in the single - order , long - slit mode , and this observation has provided the most useful kinematic information .",
    "the h@xmath20 line shows a narrow component at a nearly constant heliocentric velocity of @xmath101 km  s@xmath5 within the shell boundary and at 30@xmath28 west of the shell .",
    "this component represents the local interstellar medium , and its velocity will be adopted as the systemic velocity of the shell around ngc 1313 x-2 .",
    "the h@xmath20 line also shows curved blue - shifted and red - shifted components indicating an expanding shell .",
    "the red - shifted component shows an extreme velocity offset of + 110 km  s@xmath5 from the systemic velocity .",
    "the blue - shifted component is blended with the bright telluric oh lines at 6571.383 and 6571.386  , so it is difficult to determine its extreme velocity offset , but it is at least @xmath102 km  s@xmath5 from the systemic velocity .",
    "we thus conservatively assign an expansion velocity of 100 km  s@xmath5 to the large shell around ngc 1313 x-2 .",
    "this expansion velocity is higher than the 80 km  s@xmath5 determined by @xcite using a lower - resolution spectrum . for a shell",
    "@xmath103 pc in size , this 100 km  s@xmath5 expansion velocity is unusually high , and supports the shock ionization of the nebula , as suggested by @xcite .    the kinetic energy of this shell , assuming the aforementioned shell density and geometry , is @xmath104 ergs .",
    "this energy is much higher than the canonical supernova explosion energy of 10@xmath105 ergs and the shell size is much larger than those of known snrs .",
    "there could be a large number of normal supernova explosions that power the expansion of this large supershell , but this is not supported by the small number of main sequence b stars .",
    "it is most likely that the energetic process producing the ulx ngc 1313 x-2 is also responsible for powering this large expanding shell .",
    "the luminous x - ray sources for which we obtained echelle observations were selected because they were surrounded by gaseous nebulae .",
    "it is thus not surprising that all seven of our program x - ray sources are in young stellar environments .",
    "for example , the cmds of stellar populations near ho ix x-1 , ic 10 x-1 , and ngc 1313 x-2 all show main sequence stars typically in the mass range 1025 @xmath7 .",
    "the young stellar environment suggests that these x - ray sources are likely hmxbs .",
    "the most direct way to assess the nature of a luminous x - ray source is to identify an optical counterpart .",
    "optical counterparts have been identified for six of our program x - ray sources , and in all cases the counterparts are massive stars ranging from @xmath106 to several tens of @xmath7 . these results further support the suggestion that these luminous or ultraluminous x - ray sources are hmxbs .",
    "( see table 3 for a summary of the stellar and interstellar environments of the luminous x - ray sources we studied . ) to confirm the association between these stars and the x - ray sources , spectroscopic observations of the optical counterparts are needed to search for irradiated stellar @xmath04686 emission ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "once confirmed , spectroscopic monitoring observations can be used to measure the orbital parameters of these systems in order to determine conclusively whether the ulxs are associated with imbhs .",
    "the detection of a spatially resolved @xmath04686 emitting nebula around a luminous x - ray source can be used to determine whether the x - ray emission is beamed or isotropic . however , besides lmc x-1 , none of the nebulae around luminous x - ray sources for which we obtained clear , accurately positioned echelle spectra emitted the @xmath04686 line . to assess our negative results",
    ", we compare the nebulae for which we did not detect the line to the -emitting nebulae associated with lmc x-1 and ho ii x-1 .",
    "lmc x-1 is surrounded by a dense region with a diameter of 6 pc , while ho ii x-1 is in an region 30@xmath8745 pc in size .",
    "this size difference reflects the two orders of magnitude difference in x - ray luminosity between these two objects .",
    "the four nebulae for which we do not detect the line are large supershells or diffuse regions with low concentrations of gas in the vicinity of the x - ray source . for such distributions of interstellar gas , x - ray emission from the source would be dispersed into a large volume of low - density gas , resulting in an extremely low surface brightness of recombination emission .",
    "thus the @xmath04686 line would be difficult , if not impossible , to detect for these regions .    by comparing the total ionization energy requirements and expansion velocity of a shell nebula with contributions from the local stellar population , we make estimates of energy contributions from ho ix x-1 and ngc 1313 x-2 . in both cases ,",
    "the stellar populations were insufficient in producing the energy required for the observed ionization and kinematics of the nebulae , and thus we concluded that these ulxs played a significant role in the energetics of their respective supershells .",
    "this ulx was first detected by _ rosat _ observations ( zezas et al .",
    "recent observations by @xcite detected a `` foot - shaped '' nebula with emission concentrated in the `` heel '' of the foot nebula . further _",

    "our slit positions unfortunately missed the nebula .",
    "however , the echelle spectra centered at 08@xmath3519@xmath366@xmath370 , @xmath3870@xmath3942@xmath29510 ( j2000.0 ) , corresponding to the middle of the  foot , \" reveal an expanding shell structure , and show @xmath108 @xmath21 6575 km s@xmath5 .",

    "an _ hst _ h@xmath42 image of the whole foot region shows both nebulosity and a high concentration of bright stars .",
    "the detection of a blue star at the position of the ulx by @xcite suggests a possible optical counterpart with @xmath110 to @xmath111 , and @xmath112 , consistent with a range of spectral types from o4v to b3 ib .",
    "ic 342 x-1 is associated with a `` tooth - shaped '' nebula 6@xmath28 in diameter , corresponding to 110 pc at a distance 3.9 mpc @xcite .",
    "this nebula has a high [ ] /h@xmath20 ratio of 1.2 and a high [ ] /h@xmath20 ratio of 0.4 which is characteristic of snrs @xcite .",
