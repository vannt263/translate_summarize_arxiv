    "both the intrinsic values of l@xmath62 and l@xmath55 are at the lower end of the range for other high-@xmath0 sources in the sample of om13 .",
    "the results presented here on sdp.81 provide a first view of the wealth of information contained in these alma data . providing a leap in angular resolution compared to previous observations ,",
    "these data demonstrate the power of alma to image gravitationally lensed systems with high resolution and high fidelity .    with the continuum images , we have presented strong detections of thermal dust emission from the @xmath0=3.042 background source at unprecedented angular resolutions , with beam sizes as small as 23  mas corresponding to spatial scales in the source on the order of an impressive few tens of parsecs .",
    "at this high angular resolution we clearly detect the two main arc structures of the einstein ring , but using only the shorter baselines we find evidence of low - level emission that traces a more complete ring .",
    "we have also detected weak ( @xmath15@xmath44 ) continuum emission that is spatially coincident with the center of the foreground lens , and find a 1.4290  ghz spectral index of @xmath1@xmath310.5 that implies we have detected emission from an agn in the foreground elliptical galaxy that must have a very low accretion rate .",
    "our detection of in sdp.81 , at 0.9 resolution , is the highest resolution detection to date of thermal water emission in an extragalactic source .",
    "emission from the w component is tentatively detected for the first time , with a contribution to the total emission of only a few per cent .",
    "we have also presented detections of three transitions of co , , , and , at 170  mas resolution , and shown that while they spectrally have similar red- and blue - shifted components , their spatial morphologies are rather different .",
    "the properties of the co and line data indicate that sdp.81 may be a complex source , as was suggested by previous authors ( e.g. bu13 , * ? ? ?",
    "the overall similarity in the spatial and spectral distributions of the co and lines suggests that both species may have a common origin , although the sub - thermal ( @xmath641 ) co line ratios and strong detections of high-@xmath45 co lines could suggest the presence of an extended cool and moderate - density gas component ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "our co line measurements suggest that the higher-@xmath45 co lines are less luminous , which may indicate that any agn present would be subdominant , and thus that a complex mixture of pdrs and xdrs would be required to adequately describe the excitation in sdp.81 . the /co(8 - 7 ) ratio is lower in sdp.81 than for other high-@xmath0 sources in the literature ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* om13 ) , which suggests that either we are missing significant extended emission or that the and co excitation is relatively low .",
    "the former does not seem likely , given the similarity between the alma and pdbi results .",
    "it is possible that differential lensing ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is playing a role in the relatively weak emission in the w component . without detailed modeling , any effect from differential magnification can not be quantified , and in a highly magnified system such as sdp.81 , differential lensing could potentially lead to , for example , changes in the spectral indices , the co ladder or line ratios .",
    "future studies will be able to quantify this effect in sdp.81 through detailed foreground mass modelling @xcite , and the combination of this high angular resolution alma data with near - ir data will provide constraints on the differential lensing between the stellar and dust emission ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "detailed lens modelling is beyond the scope of this work , but will be crucial for understanding the full nature of these alma observations .",

    "the snr of the full - resolution @xmath14 data was found to be too low for the algorithm to determine the spectral index , except around the strong peaks of emission , which resulted in a flux scale in the combined image that was not reliable .",
    "we were , however , able to make a combined ( 1.14  mm ) image using band 6&7 continuum images that were @xmath14-tapered to match the resolution of the spectral line data , which yielded a robust spectral index image at @xmath1170  mas resolution .",
