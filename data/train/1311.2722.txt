    "as observed in @xcite , the study of wave collisions can not be local in time , but one has to take into account the whole sequence of interactions - cancellations - transversal interactions involving every couple of waves .",
    "our approach in this paper follows the ideas of @xcite : we construct a quadratic functional @xmath79 such that    a.   its total variation in time is bounded by @xmath80 ; b.   [ point_2_fq_char_intro ] at any interaction involving the wavefronts @xmath10 , it decays at least of the quantity @xmath81    the functional can increase only when a transversal interaction occurs , but in this case we show that its positive variation is controlled by the decrease of the classical transversal glimm interaction functional @xcite @xmath82 in the above formula , we denote by @xmath83 the wavefronts of the first family generated at @xmath84 , by @xmath85 their strengths , and by @xmath86 , @xmath87 , their position at time @xmath43 .",
    "clearly it holds @xmath88 , and we assume that @xmath89 for each @xmath90 . being @xmath91 a lyapunov functional , it follows that @xmath92 so that , being by construction @xmath93 , the functional @xmath94 has total variation of the order of @xmath95 .",
    "in particular , @xmath96 the estimates concerning transversal interactions and cancellations are much easier ( and already done in the literature , see @xcite ) , and we present them in propositions [ p_trans_ch_sped ] , [ w_canc_3 ] .    as in @xcite , @xmath1 has the form @xmath97 what differs from the analysis in the scalar case is the computation of the _ weights _ @xmath98 .",
    "we recall that in the scalar case the computation of @xmath98 involves two steps :    1 .",
    "[ point_1_scal_cas ] the definition of the interval @xmath99 , made of all waves which have interacted _ both _ with @xmath40 _ and _ @xmath100 ; 2 .",
    "[ point_2_scal_cas ] the computation of an artificial difference in speed of @xmath101 , obtained by solving the riemann problem in @xmath99 with the flux of the scalar equation @xmath20 .",
    "the fundamental fact in the analysis of the scalar case is that    [ propert_d ] the riemann solution of point waves which are divided in the approximate solution of the cauchy problem .    as a consequence , two waves which have been separated at a time @xmath102 ,",
    "can join again at some interaction only if this interaction involves waves which have never interacted .",
    "the main difficulty we face in our setting ( i.e. in the presence of wavefronts of different families ) is that the two properties above are not true any more .",
    "this has an impact in the construction of the intervals @xmath99 ( point above ) and in the definition of the weights @xmath103 , which is now given by an `` artificial flux '' ( point ) .",
    "we now address these points more deeply .",
    "the model situation to be considered here is the following : even in the absence of cancellations or interactions involving waves which have never interacted with @xmath104 , the waves @xmath104 can undergo to a sequence of splittings and interactions due to the presence of the wavefronts of the first family . in this case , the interval @xmath99 as defined in @xcite does not contain the information about their common story : in fact , by the definition given in @xcite , section 3.3 , @xmath99 contains all waves which have interacted both with @xmath40 and @xmath100 , but it gives us no information about the transversal interactions in which each wave @xmath105 has been involved before time @xmath43 .",
    "hence , it is more natural to compute the interval @xmath99 starting from the last common splitting point .",
    "the drawback of this definition is that , differently from the scalar case ( lemma 3.17 of @xcite ) , the intervals @xmath99 and @xmath106 , for @xmath107 , are not in general comparable .",
    "however , a fundamental reduction property still holds , proposition [ p_partition_restr ] .",
    "the other characteristic of systems is that the scalar reduced flux function ( see @xcite ) _ depends _ ( as a function ) on the solution .",
    "hence the separation property cited above is certainly not valid , if we use this reduced scalar flux . indeed , as we said before , two waves which have split can be again approaching due only to transversal interactions , which means that the flux function @xmath20 of is not separating them when solving the riemann problem in @xmath99 .    in any case , it is not clear which can be a natural flux function to be used to compute the difference in speeds as in point , because of the presence of the wavefronts of the first family .    in order to overcome this difficulty and preserve the separation property ( d ) , we build first the partition @xmath108 of @xmath99 as follows : @xmath108 is the least refined partition such that for all @xmath109 , if @xmath110 are waves in @xmath99 which are separated at @xmath111 , then they belong to different elements @xmath112 , proposition [ p_divise_partizione_implica_divise_realta ] .",
    "it is fairly easy to see that the elements @xmath113 of the partition @xmath108 are intervals .",
    "the weights @xmath98 are then constructed recursively by computing at each transversal interaction the worst possible increase in the difference in speed @xmath114 $ ] , see and lemma [ l_estim_interval_of_partition ] , and then defining @xmath115}{|\\hat w(s ' ) - ( \\hat w(s)-\\mathcal{s}(s ) { \\varepsilon})| } &   \\text{$s , s'$ divided at time $ t_j$ and already interacted } , \\\\",
    "\\|d^2_{ww } f\\|_{l^\\infty } & \\text{$s , s'$ never interacted . }",
    "\\end{cases}\\ ] ]    another difference w.r.t .",
    "the scalar case is that here we do not increase the weight @xmath98 when a cancellation occurs . even if we do not obtain the sharpest estimate on ,",
    "this choice is sufficient for proving and the analysis is certainly simpler .",
    ".6 cm    in section [ ss_freal ] , we introduce an _ effective flux function @xmath116 _ , which is defined up to an affine function by the formula , @xmath117 where @xmath118 for any @xmath40 such that @xmath119 $ ] in the case of @xmath40 positive ( resp .",
    "@xmath120 in the case of @xmath40 negative ) .",
    "as observed before , this flux @xmath116 is not useful for computing the weights : in fact , its main use is in the comparison in the difference in rankine - hugoniot speed @xmath121 ( obtained by rankine - hugoniot condition with flux @xmath116 on the element @xmath113 of the partition @xmath108 ) with the weights @xmath122 , see .",
    "in particular , when no transversal wavefronts are present , then , up to a constant independent of @xmath123 , @xmath121 corresponds to the rankine - hugoniot speed @xmath124 computed according to the flux @xmath20 on the interval @xmath113 , and hence the weights @xmath122 yield a control on the speed difference .",
    "an important consequence of the fact that the intervals @xmath99 , @xmath106 for @xmath107 are not comparable , is that the reasoning of theorem 3.23 of @xcite ( precisely the inequality before ( 3.16 ) in step 4 of the proof ) can not be carried out .",
    "+ however , the separation property of the partitions @xmath108 allows to divide the pairs of waves @xmath125 ( involved in an interaction of the wavefronts @xmath126 , @xmath127 , with @xmath128 , @xmath129 ) according to the last transversal interaction - cancellation time which splits them ( lemma [ l_incastro_2 ] ) .",
    "the proof of point of page then proceeds by considering a subtree @xmath130 of @xmath131 and by constructing for each @xmath132 a subrectangle @xmath133 of @xmath134 , such that the following estimate holds : @xmath135|s||s'| \\\\ &",

    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ s_convex_env ] provides some useful results on convex envelopes .",
    "part of these results are already present in the literature , others can be deduced with little effort .",
    "we decided to collect them for reader s convenience .",
    "two particular estimates play a key role in the main body of the paper : the dependence of the derivative of the convex envelope of @xmath20 when @xmath20 changes ( proposition [ p_estim_diff_conv ] ) and the behavior of the speed assigned to a wave by the solution to riemann problem @xmath140 $ ] when the left state @xmath141 or the right state @xmath142 are varied ( proposition [ diff_vel_proporzionale_canc ] ) .",
