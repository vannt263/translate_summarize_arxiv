    "the defining feature of theories with infinite - volume extra dimensions , such as dgp and cascading gravity , is that 4@xmath21 gravity is mediated by a resonance graviton  a continuum of massive states  with general propagator .",

    ", we shall assume that all cross - over scales are comparable and denote this common scale by @xmath22 .    because @xmath16 gravity is massive , each graviton has 5 polarizations : the usual 2 helicity-2 states of gr , 2 helicity-1 states and 1 helicity-0 degree of freedom . at distances @xmath66 , only the helicity-2 and helicity-0 degrees of freedom are relevant  the helicity-1 states are very weakly coupled to matter and can be safely ignored . in the dgp model",
    ", the helicity-0 mode has a nice geometrical interpretation .",
    "it measures the extrinsic curvature of the brane in the extra dimension and is thus referred to as a brane - bending mode .",
    "cascading gravity theories have @xmath67 additional helicity-0 or scalar modes , accounting for the higher number of extra dimensions in which the brane can bend .",
    "this counting of degrees of freedom can alternatively be understood from a decomposition of the @xmath21-dimensional massless spin-2 representation  @xcite .",
    "these scalar modes couple to the trace of the stress - energy tensor of matter on the brane and , combined with the helicity-2 states , result in a one - graviton exchange amplitude between conserved sources having the tensor structure of @xmath21-dimensional massless gravity  @xcite : ~t^ _ - t^ _ ^ _ , [ amp ] where we have neglected the graviton mass term for the scales of interest  @xcite . for non - relativistic sources",
    ", this corresponds to the modified poisson equation k^2_dyn = -4 g ( 1 + ) . [ poissonflat ] in other words , the gravitational attraction is a factor of @xmath68 stronger than in standard newtonian gravity .",
    "if  ( [ amp ] ) were valid in the solar system , the theory would already be ruled out by post - newtonian constraints , for arbitrarily small @xmath69  this is the famous van dam - veltman - zhakarov ( vdvz ) discontinuity  @xcite .",
    "the resolution , first proposed by vainshtein for massive gravity  @xcite , is that the weak - field / linear assumption implicit in  ( [ amp ] ) is actually a poor approximation for the scalar modes in the vicinity of astrophysical bodies or in the early universe . instead ,",
    "as shown explicitly in the dgp model  @xcite , non - linearities in these modes in high - density regions result in them decoupling from matter , leading to an approximate recovery of einstein gravity in , _",

    "let us start with the dgp case . on scales",
    "@xmath70 ( and thus @xmath71 ) , we can neglect time derivatives relative to gradients of the graviton helicity-0 mode .",

    "[ betadgp ] the overdot denotes a derivative with respect to proper time .",
    "the vainshtein effect appears in two guises in the above .",

    "the analogue of  ( [ pieqn ] ) is not yet known for cascading gravity .",
    "there are multiple scalars in this case , each of which is expected to exhibit vainshtein screening .",
    "there have not yet been any successful calculations that keep the non - linearities of all scalar modes . for the purpose of this paper",
    ", we shall take a phenomenological approach and assume that all cascading scalar degrees of freedom obey an equation of the form  ( [ pieqn ] ) .",
    "this is consistent with our earlier assumption of a single cross - over scale @xmath22 .",
    "in other words , we collectively denote the scalars by @xmath72 and assume that they satisfy & & ^2 + [ ( ^2)^2 - ( _ i_j)(^i^j ) ] + & & = .",
    "[ pieqn2 ] using the scaling of the resulting deviation from gr in the solar system  @xcite , we can infer that the cosmological deviation scales as @xmath78 .",

    "[ beta ] this modification makes a sharper transition in time than  ( [ betadgp ] ) .",
    "this is related to the fact that gravity rapidly weakens on long length scales in models that can successfully degravitate the cosmological constant .",
    "this also means that whatever replaces  ( [ pieqn2 ] ) in cascading gravity will likely exhibit even more efficient vainshtein screening within collapsed objects .",

    "the code and further numerical results will be described in more detail elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "most of our results are derived within linear theory , since this is a valid approximation for bulk flows over the scales of interest .",

    "using the fact that the energy - momentum tensor on the brane is covariantly conserved , density and velocity perturbations evolve as usual via = -v ; + hv = _ dyn .",

    "since matter responds simply to gravitational gradients at the linear level , it is straightforward to estimate the expected bulk flows on length scales where matter overdensities are in the linear regime . see ",
    "ii.14 of  @xcite for an introductory exposition .",
    "the root - mean - square of the one - dimensional ( 1-dim ) velocity , @xmath85 , on a scale @xmath86 is given by  @xcite [ sigv ] _",

    "[ gauss ] this is designed to capture only the small-@xmath40/long - distance behavior of the power spectrum , _ i.e. _ the bulk flow .",

    "hence , @xmath35 folds in more higher-@xmath40 modes , whereas peculiar velocities are a direct probe of low-@xmath40 power .",
    "the long - distance modifications of gravity of interest boost peculiar velocities in two ways :    * faster development of structure at late times , encoded in the growth rate @xmath93 ; * greater build - up of structure due to the integrated influence of stronger gravity , resulting in a larger amplitude of the power spectrum ( _ i.e. _ , larger @xmath35 ) .    as mentioned earlier",

    "nevertheless , the boost in the bulk flow can be substantial because of the growth rate effect .",
    "in other words , whereas the power spectrum is the integrated result of the entire growth history , peculiar velocities are also sensitive to the present growth rate .",
    "bulk flows are often discussed in a variety of different ways , which can be confusing .",
    "the bulk flows that are measured using peculiar velocity surveys and other techniques are reconstructions of a full three - dimensional bulk flow of our region of space , but they are based on measurements that are separately only one - dimensional  our line - of - sight measurements always project the velocity of each object onto the radial direction . what is measured , then , is a 1-dimensional velocity for each object in the survey . by collecting and averaging over a large number of objects , however , we are able to reconstruct the full 3d bulk flow  @xcite , albeit with a small residual contribution from some smaller scales",

    "meanwhile , on the very large , @xmath158 mpc scales relevant to the result of  @xcite , our modifications to gravity can not account for the observed bulk flow . for our @xmath47 and @xmath49  mpc model",
    ", we find @xmath159 = 29 $ ]  km / s , versus 24  km / s for @xmath0cdm .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , recent hydronamical simulations of the bullet cluster have shown that an initial velocity of @xmath160 km / s is required when the cluster and subcluster are @xmath161 mpc apart to best reproduce x - ray observations .",
    "lee and komatsu  @xcite have recently estimated that the probability of such an initial velocity in the standard @xmath0cdm framework is between @xmath162 and @xmath163  respectively 6.5 and 5.8@xmath15 from the mean of cluster velocities ",
    ", where the uncertainty comes from the evolution of velocities with redshift .",
    "most of the infall velocity is caused by the gravitational attraction of the main cluster , which is estimated to have a mass of @xmath164 ( that this is a good approximation for such massive clusters is established in  @xcite ) .",
    "we therefore compute the infall velocity in our models by treating the clusters as point particles released from rest from some large initial separation @xmath165 mpc and integrate their dynamics down to a separation of 5  mpc as in  @xcite . for simplicity , we assume head - on collision . the gravitational potential due to the large cluster is obtained by solving  ( [ pieqn2 ] ) for @xmath72 and the standard poisson equation for @xmath81 for a point particle of mass @xmath164 .",
    "the motion of the subcluster is then obtained from the full gravitational potential given by  ( [ dyn ] ) .",
    "we also include in quadrature the effect of the enhanced bulk flow on 5  mpc scales ; however , the final velocity is almost entirely determined by the infall calculation .",
    "we should expect the enhancement to scale as @xmath166 , where @xmath167 is the effective newton s constant enhanced by the additional scalar forces in our models  see  ( [ deltaevolve ] ) . in the last stages of infall , however , the enhancement is somewhat tamed by the vainshtein mechanism .",
    "a related point is that the enhanced force in modified gravity does not substantially reduce the velocity at 5  mpc necessary to explain the merger velocity . because of vainshtein screening , the final velocity of a particle falling from 5  mpc to the center of a @xmath164 cluster differs by at most 1% compared with the infall in standard gravity .",
    "we find that initial velocities are 14% to 27% larger in our framework , with the smallest difference coming from @xmath46 and the largest for @xmath47 , again assuming the minimal value of @xmath22 allowed by constraints on @xmath35 : @xmath168 and @xmath169  mpc , respectively .",
    "these enhancements shift the mean of the probability density function for initial velocities calculated in  @xcite , which is a function of @xmath170 .",
    "the larger bulk flow component at 5  mpc also slightly widens the variance of the distribution .",
    "the end result is that the required initial velocities for the bullet cluster merger are much more likely in our model .",
    "focusing on the @xmath47 , @xmath171  mpc case , the probability of an initial velocity of @xmath50 km / s at @xmath51 is increased to @xmath172  2.0@xmath173 times more likely than the @xmath0cdm value ; in other words , a change from a 6.5@xmath15 to a 4.8@xmath15 event .",
    "the probability of that initial velocity at @xmath54 , closer to the actual merger redshift of @xmath55 , is increased to @xmath56 , again more than @xmath53 times as probable as the @xmath0cdm result  a shift from 5.8@xmath15 to 3.9@xmath15 .",
    "if we follow  @xcite and also consider the probability of finding an initial velocity of 2000  km / s , the probability of such an occurrence in our model becomes 0.8% at @xmath51 and 14.2% at @xmath54 , respectively 257 and 65 times more likely than the @xmath0cdm expectation ( that is , respectively 2.4 and 1@xmath15 in modified gravity , versus 4 and 2.9@xmath15 in standard gravity ) .",
    "this significant increase in probability is another tantalizing hint of new gravitational physics .",
    "in this paper , we have explored how peculiar velocities are affected in a broad class of ir - modified gravity theories called brane - induced gravity . on the scales of interest ,",
    "these theories admit a local @xmath16 description in terms of weak - field gravity plus @xmath59 scalar fields coupled to the trace of the matter stress - tensor .",
    "these scalar degrees of freedom effectively strengthen the gravitational attraction at late times and speed up structure formation . as a result ,",
    "peculiar velocities are systematically larger than those expected in standard gravity . comparisons between n - body simulations and linear theory calculations show that linear theory gives an excellent description of the physics of bulk flows .",
    "we have found that large - scale bulk flows can be enhanced up to @xmath174 relative to @xmath0cdm cosmology .",
    "the enhancement is limited by observational constraints on @xmath35 , the tightest limit coming from x - ray cluster abundance .",
    "the predicted peculiar velocities alleviate the tension with recent observations of the bulk flow on @xmath23  mpc scales by watkins _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , from a @xmath11 discrepancy in @xmath0cdm gravity to a @xmath175 difference in cascading gravity .",
    "the agreement between theory and data is improved by @xmath176 in our model .",
    "although modest , this improvement offers further motivation for more accurate bulk flow observations .",
    "peculiar velocities are also enhanced on much larger scales ( @xmath177  mpc ) probed by kinetic sunyaev - zeldovich observations , but this is insufficient to explain the enormous bulk flow inferred by  @xcite .",
    "violent merging systems , such as the bullet cluster , are much more probable in cascading gravity . drawing on the recent analysis of  @xcite , we have found that the occurrence of the bullet cluster in our theories is @xmath178 times more likely than in standard gravity .",
    "we are pursuing various parallel tracks to improve upon the preliminary analysis presented here .",
    "as mentioned above , the tightest constraint on our models comes from cluster counts . through n - body simulations and various semi - analytical techniques",
    ", we are currently determining the halo mass function in cascading gravity as a function of @xmath21 and @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "this will allow a more accurate comparison with x - ray data . with regards to the bullet cluster , we can use similar simulations to calculate the distribution of initial velocities for subclusters , following the standard gravity analysis of  @xcite .    on the theoretical side , the calculations presented here rely on some phenomenological input .",
    "while we are confident that our results capture the essence of cascading cosmology predictions , they do not derive from a rigorous cosmological analysis of the complete higher - dimensional theory .",
    "an important first step in this direction would be to obtain the decoupling limit of cascading gravity while keeping the non - linearities in all scalar degrees of freedom .",
    "this would allow a derivation of the modified friedmann equation , as in  @xcite for dgp , as well as the perturbation equations in the newtonian regime .",
    "this is work in progress  @xcite .",
    "the observations of large bulk flows and violent cluster mergers offer tantalizing evidence that structure is evolving more rapidly than predicted by @xmath0cdm cosmology . as we extend our measurements of large - scale bulk flows beyond our local region and discover an increasing number of merging systems , it will become clear whether these are statistical flukes or the first indication of a new realm of gravitational physics on cosmological distances in the late universe .",

    "<S> early work  @xcite revealed , however , that the ghost is excised by including a sufficiently large tension on the 3-brane or , alternatively , by considering a higher - dimensional einstein - hilbert term localized on the brane  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> while the original derivation of  @xcite was restricted to a particular decoupling limit of the theory , recently the absence of perturbative ghosts has been proven rigorously by perturbing the full @xmath20 solution in the presence of brane tension  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these results establish the cascading gravity framework as a perturbatively consistent ir modification of gravity .      in this paper </S>",

    "<S> the stronger effective gravitational attraction in our models also makes the occurrence of a high - velocity merging system like the bullet cluster much more probable . assuming that the majority of the infall velocity is caused by the @xmath44 main cluster , we treat the clusters as point particles released from rest from a large initial separation ( @xmath45  mpc ) and calculate the resulting velocity at @xmath14  mpc , the initial separation for gas collision simulations . to include the rest of large scale structure , we add a bulk flow component to the infall velocity in quadrature .    </S>",
    "<S> we find that the resulting velocity at @xmath14  mpc separation is 14% ( @xmath46 ) to 27% ( @xmath47 ) larger in our theories , where we again take the minimum allowed @xmath22 for each @xmath21 . for @xmath48 ( and @xmath49  mpc ) , an initial velocity of @xmath50 km / s at @xmath51 is a 4.8@xmath15 event , as compared with 6.5@xmath15 in @xmath0cdm ; or , in terms of probability , @xmath52 versus @xmath3 , a boost of over @xmath53 . </S>",

    "<S> extracting exact cosmological predictions from a higher - dimensional set - up , such as cascading gravity , is technically very challenging ; even the precise form of the modified friedmann equation is not yet known . </S>",
    "<S> hence our results must rely on some phenomenological input .    </S>",
    "<S> fortunately , the scales of interest for this study are well within the newtonian regime . </S>",
    "<S> in this regime , the theory admits a local description on the 3-brane , which arises through a certain decoupling limit . in this limit , the complexities of the full higher dimensional theory that are irrelevant to @xmath16 physics are left out . </S>",
    "<S> the result is an effective theory in @xmath16 with new degrees of freedom . </S>",
    "<S> the relevant degrees of freedom are weak - field gravity and @xmath59 scalar fields coupled to the trace of the matter stress - tensor , describing brane - bending along each extra dimension . whereas gravity is weakly coupled in this limit , </S>",
    "<S> the scalars have non - linear derivative interactions that are responsible for the vainshtein effect , a phenomenon generic to this kind of theory that leads to the approximate recovery of standard gravity in high density regions . </S>",
    "<S> while the precise form of the decoupling theory for cascading gravity is not known , we draw upon known results in dgp to infer the non - linear interactions of the scalars .    for the background , meanwhile , we assume a @xmath0cdm expansion history . </S>",
    "<S> as mentioned earlier , the form of the modified graviton propagator in cascading gravity suggests that brane - world corrections to the friedmann equation  @xcite are more slowly - varying functions of @xmath60 than in standard dgp  @xcite ; they should closely resemble vacuum energy contributions . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , by assuming a @xmath0cdm expansion history , our analysis isolates the effects of the modified growth history  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we describe this approach in detail in sec .  </S>",
    "<S> [ massgrav ] .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , we wish to emphasize that , although our analysis does not constitute a fully rigorous derivation of cosmological predictions in cascading gravity , our results should most likely capture the essence of the predictions of the complete theory . because the observables of interest are in the newtonian regime , the description in terms of conformally - coupled scalar fields with non - linear interactions should be accurate . </S>",
    "<S> the details of the vainshtein screening mechanism may vary , but the corrections to our predictions  which lie on scales where linear theory is valid  are expected to be small . in short , our approach is not merely a toy model of cascading cosmology , but a first iteration in extracting predictions from a broad class of ir - modified gravity theories . </S>"
