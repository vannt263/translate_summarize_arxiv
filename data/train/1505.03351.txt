    "the experimental progress in confining and manipulating cold atoms and bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) offers a unique opportunity to investigate the quantum properties of interacting many - particle systems . for most realistic setups , however , a theoretical full many - particle description is beyond the current state of the art .",
    "most commonly the mean - field approximation is applied , resulting in a description of the many - particle system by an effective single particle wave function .",
    "the time evolution is in this description governed by a nonlinear schrdinger equation .",
    "this approximation is closely related to the classical limit of single particle quantum systems , where the particle number plays the role of @xmath1 .",
    "recently there have been several studies demonstrating that this analogy can be used to apply semiclassical techniques to recover full many - particle features from the mean - field description alone @xcite .    over the last decade",
    "there has been considerable interest in atom - molecule conversion in cold atoms and becs @xcite .",
    "theoretically these systems are closely related to deformed @xmath2 algebras @xcite . neglecting quantum fluctuations in the many - particle dynamics",
    "leads to mean - field approximations defined on phase spaces with non - standard geometries , and new interesting features in the many - particle and mean - field correspondence . here",
    "we address the question whether semiclassical methods might be adapted to describe the full many - particle behaviour of atom - molecule conversion systems on the grounds of their mean - field approximation .",
    "we focus on the simplest model of an atom - molecule conversion system , similar to the one considered in @xcite , consisting of non - interacting atoms and diatomic molecules each of which can populate only one mode . introducing the atomic and molecular creation and annihilation operators , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively , this system can be described by a hamiltonian of the form @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the energy of the atomic or molecular mode , and",

    ", we confine the discussions to even particle numbers in what follows .",
    "we begin with a review of the many - particle and mean - field descriptions , and their correspondence .",
    "then we introduce a semiclassical quantisation condition and demonstrate that the many - particle spectrum can be accurately recovered from the mean - field dynamics , and derive an analytic expression for the many - particle density of states in the semiclassical limit of large particle numbers .",
    "we also present results for the semiclassical many - particle eigenstates .",
    "we end with a summary and outlook .",
    "similar to the two - mode bose - hubbard model @xcite , we can apply a schwinger - type transformation to introduce the operators @xmath11 the hamiltonian can then be expressed as @xmath12 where we have shifted the zero energy and introduced the parameter @xmath13 .",

    "the simple symmetry with respect to @xmath36 is lost , and we observe a cluster of narrow avoided crossings for intermediate values of @xmath36 , stretching from the upper end of the spectrum for negative values of @xmath36 to the lower for positive values .",

    "is dominated by the equidistant spectrum of @xmath17 .",
    "the narrow avoided crossings lead to quasi - stationary states related to unstable stationary states in the mean - field description .",
    "these are related to the molecular mode , where all particles are paired up in diatomic molecules .",
    "the many - particle dynamics can be straight - forwardly obtained by integration of the schrdinger equation on the @xmath37-dimensional hilbert space .",
    "it is nevertheless instructive to study the heisenberg equations of motion for the dynamical variables @xmath38 , given by @xmath39 due to the nonlinearity of the commutator of @xmath25 and @xmath14 this is not a closed set of equations if @xmath40 , that is , the right hand side contains dynamical variables such as @xmath41 whose dynamics is not determined by the dynamical equations ( [ kdyn ] ) . in the trivial case @xmath42 , where the atomic and molecular mode decouple , we have a closed set of equations , describing rigid rotations around the @xmath43-axis . in the general case ,",
    "taking the expectation value and neglecting quantum fluctuations , i.e. , approximating expectation values of products with products of expectation values , yields the mean - field approximation we shall discuss in the following section .",

    "there are two natural ways to define a mean - field wave function .",

    "for longer times ( not depicted ) , revival phenomena occur where the revival time rapidly increases with the particle number as expected @xcite .",
    "the slow convergence of the many - particle dynamics towards the mean - field dynamics is particularly pronounced for those initial states whose mean - field dynamics asymptotically approaches the saddle point related to the all - molecular mode , as seen at the bottom in figure [ fig_mp_mfdyn ] .",
    "the breakdown happens very rapidly here and even for longer times , no revivals are observed .",
    "this behaviour has been investigated in some detail in @xcite , and is typical for quantum - classical correspondence in the neighbourhood of hyperbolic fixed points .",
    "in the following we shall investigate how semiclassical techniques might be modified to obtain an approximation for the many - particle eigenvalues from the mean - field dynamics . for this purpose",
    "it is convenient to use the approach by braun @xcite that has been developed for general three - term recurrence relations , since the matrix representation of our many - particle hamiltonian ( [ eqn_mpham ] ) in the eigenbasis of @xmath17 is tri - diagonal , and thus the eigenvalue equation defines a three - term recurrence relation . the same procedure has been successfully applied to the spectrum of the two - mode bose - hubbard model in @xcite . since the spectrum of @xmath17 is related to that of two coupled harmonic oscillators , we expect that the semiclassical quantisation should yield exact results for the spectrum of @xmath17 for arbitrary particle numbers . for this purpose",
    "the quantisation procedure of braun has to be slightly modified",
