    "the physics of two - dimensional ( 2d ) electron systems in a strong magnetic field has lead to the exploration and understanding of various strongly correlated states in the fractional quantum hall regime .",
    "@xcite the fractional quantum hall effects ( fqhe ) at filling factors @xmath2 were explained by laughlin , using trial wavefunctions which lead to incompressible states with quasiparticle excitations having fractional charge @xmath3 .",
    "jain obtained a unified description of all principal filling factors @xmath4 by using the composite fermion picture , where each electron is dressed with @xmath5 units of statistical flux and forms a composite fermion ( cf ) .",
    "@xcite at mean - field level , the composite fermions experience a uniform reduced magnetic field , @xmath6 , and fill an integer number @xmath7 of cf landau levels .",
    "this approach , based on trial wavefunctions and numerical diagonalization , has been very successful in describing various properties of fractional quantum hall states ; however , it does not allow calculation of dynamic response functions and suffers from the inevitable finite - system - size limitations .",
    "these limitations are overcome by an approach based on the chern - simons transformation , which attaches flux to the electrons via a chern - simons gauge field , effectively transforming the fermions into ( hard - core ) bosons or fermions depending on the number of flux quanta attached .",
    "@xcite this approach does start with a microscopic hamiltonian , but after the chern - simon transformation it _ does not _ retain the lowest landau level limit , and does not distinguish clearly between the high - energy ( cyclotron ) and the low - energy ( guiding center ) degrees of freedom .",
    "most recently , the extended hamiltonian theory developed by shankar and murthy  @xcite has been successful in obtaining a unified picture of the fqhe at various fillings .",
    "this approach has the advantage that it starts with a microscopic hamiltonian , permits analytical calculations in the thermodynamic limit , and it also retains the lowest - landau - level limit .",
    "this approach has also been applied successfully to study states with broken translational symmetries , such as a wigner crystal of composite fermions .",
    "@xcite    in an _ ideal _ quantum hall system , the bulk is uniformly incompressible and gapless excitations are available only at the edges leading to transport only at the edges as well . in experimental samples ubiquitous",
    "disorder leads to islands of incompressible quantum hall fluid embedded in a compressible electronic background ; the global hall quantization occurs when these incompressible islands percolate . in either case",
    ", the transport occurs only the edges of incompressible regions .",
    "@xcite the dynamics of the fractional quantum hall edge states was first studied by wen  @xcite who proposed that the edges behave effectively as chiral luttinger liquids ( cll ) .",
    "later it was discovered that , due to electrostatic and exchange considerations , the edge of a fractional quantum hall fluid divides into strips of compressible and incompressible fluids .",
    "@xcite in particular , the edge of a quantum hall fluid at filling factor @xmath8 undergoes a reconstruction , where a strip of charge about a magnetic - length wide separates away from the bulk as the confining potential created by the neutralizing background charge density softens .",
    "@xcite the reconstructed edge consists of three counter - propagating channels ; its dynamics are qualitatively different from those of a single cll edge",
    ". this led to work on fractional edge - states using the composite fermion picture  @xcite and the effective - field - theory models which included the effects of disorder , multiple edge channels , and long - ranged interactions .",
    "@xcite the first microscopic calculation of the edge - states at filling factor @xmath0 , using exact diagonalization , showed that the edge of the laughlin liquid also undergoes a reconstruction as the confining potential is softened .",
    "@xcite however , there are various issues which neither the effective - field - theory models nor exact diagonalization methods address conclusively .",
    "for example , the number of edge modes present at various filling factors and their dependence on the system parameters is not clear . the question of whether long - ranged interactions are _ necessary _ for edge reconstruction is not clearly resolved , although the necessity has been implicitly assumed in the literature .",
    "@xcite the phenomenological models of the edge - states provide various concrete predictions for the @xmath9 characteristics of tunneling into the edge of the sample .",
    "@xcite these predictions depend on the number and the nature of the edge channels .",
    "recent experiments on tunneling into the edge of a fractional quantum hall fluid show discrepancies between the theoretical predictions and the observed characteristics .",
    "@xcite it is , therefore , crucial to have a microscopic understanding of the number of edge modes in the fractional quantum hall systems at various filling factors and their dependence on the system parameters .    in this paper , we use the extended hamiltonian theory to the study nature of edge states , and address some of the unresolved issues .",
    "this method is applicable at any principal filling factor and provides a tool for the microscopic analysis of the edge states .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : in the next section , we recall the essentials of the hamiltonian theory and present the hartree fock mean - field approximation for the edge states . section  [ sec : results ] contains results for the edge reconstructions at filling factors @xmath0 , and @xmath10 for various system parameters , such as temperature , nature of interactions , and the range of the confining potential .",
    "edge reconstruction is a purely quantum phenomenon . in a classical system , the electron density profile near the edge would follow the background charge profile to minimize the hartree ( electrostatic ) energy cost",
    "however , in a quantum treatment , the electron density deviates from the background charge density to take advantage of the exchange interactions , which lower the total energy of the system .",
    "the ratio of the effective exchange term and the electrostatic ( hartree ) term , and consequently the possibility of edge reconstruction , naturally depends on the microscopic interaction . in this section",
    "we also explore this dependence by using different functional forms for the microscopic interaction . section  [ sec : remarks ] contains concluding remarks .",
    "we start this section with the basics of the extended hamiltonian theory .",
    "@xcite the fundamental difficulty in developing analytical approximations starting from a microscopic hamiltonian for the fqhe is that there are more single - particle states available in the lowest landau level than there are electrons . in the extended hamiltonian theory ,",
    "this macroscopic degeneracy is removed by introducing extra degrees of freedom called the pseudo - vortices , which leads to an enlargement of the hilbert space of the problem .",
    "this enlarged space is the space of cfs ( composites of electrons and pseudo - vortices ) in a reduced magnetic field @xmath11 , where the composite fermions fill the first @xmath7 cf landau levels .",
    "thus the hartree - fock state of composite fermions with the first @xmath7 landau levels filled provides a _ non - degenerate _ starting point for further systematic approximations , thereby eliminating the degeneracy problem .",
    "however , since we have introduced extra degrees of freedom , namely the pseudo - vortices , we then impose an equal number of constraints so that the dimensions of the physical hilbert space are maintained . to this end",
    "we introduce two sets of guiding - center coordinates @xmath12 where @xmath13 , and @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the position and velocity operators of the composite fermions .",
    "the electron guiding center @xmath16 and the pseudo - vortex guiding center @xmath17 commute with each other and satisfy the algebra @xmath18=-il^2\\epsilon_{\\alpha\\beta},\\\\ \\label{eq : ham4 } [ r_{v\\alpha},r_{v\\beta}]=+i\\frac{l^2}{c^2}\\epsilon_{\\alpha\\beta}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus , the electron guiding - center coordinates satisfy the magnetic algebra with charge @xmath19 , whereas the pseudo - vortex guiding - center algebra represents an object with charge @xmath20 . to calculate the matrix elements of these operators in the composite - fermions basis",
    ", we use the single - particle states of the composite fermions in the reduced effective field @xmath21 . in the landau gauge ,",
    "a single - particle state @xmath22 is characterized by the landau level index @xmath23 and the guiding - center coordinate @xmath24 . in the real - space representation ,",
    "the ( un - normalized ) single - particle wavefunction is @xmath25,\\ ] ] where @xmath26 are the hermite polynomials and @xmath27 is the magnetic length in the reduced field @xmath21 seen by the composite fermions . using this basis , it is straightforward to express the electron density @xmath28 and the pseudo - vortex density @xmath29 operators in second - quantized notation : @xmath30 here @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) are the cf creation ( annihilation ) operators and the exponential prefactor @xmath33 arises from projecting the cyclotron coordinate on to the lowest landau level .",
    "@xcite we have now expressed the electron density operators , and hence the microscopic hamiltonian for the fractional quantum hall systems , in terms of composite fermion operators .",
    "therefore the original problem of interacting electrons in the _ fractional _ quantum hall regime is converted into a problem of composite fermions in the _ integer _ quantum hall regime where various many - body approximations are applicable .",
    "this mapping , of course , must by accompanied by the constraint that the pseudo - vortex degrees of freedom are not physical ; in other words , physics remains unchanged if @xmath34 for arbitrary @xmath35 .",
    "this constraint is , by definition , trivially satisfied in the exact solution of the problem . for a uniform case ,",
    "it was shown by murthy  @xcite that the ( time - dependent ) hartree - fock approximation respects this constraint .",
    "therefore hartree - fock mean - field approximation is a particularly good starting point  @xcite for the calculation of response functions .",
    "now let us apply this formalism to the edge problem .",
    "we assume that the sample - edge runs along @xmath36 breaking the translation invariance along the @xmath37-axis . since the system is translationally invariant along @xmath38-axis , it is advantageous to use the landau gauge single - particle states with guiding centers along the @xmath37-axis .",
    "the hamiltonian of our system consists of two terms : the electron - electron repulsion @xmath39 and the electron - background attraction @xmath40 , @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the electron - electron interaction , and @xmath43 is the one - body potential created by the background charge - density @xmath44 which is non - uniform near the edge @xmath36 , @xmath45 notice that since the interaction hamiltonian ( [ eq : ham7 ] ) and the background hamiltonian ( [ eq : ham8 ] ) are expressed _ only _ in terms of the electron - density operators , it is possible to recast the hamiltonian , using eq.([eq : ham5 ] ) , entirely in terms of cf creation and annihilation operators .",
    "we consider a background charge - density which vanishes linearly over width @xmath46 : @xmath47 for @xmath48 , @xmath49 $ ] for @xmath50 , and @xmath51 for @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the cf density in the bulk ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : bg ] ) . in general , the functional forms of the electron - electron and electron - background interactions may be different ; for example , if the neutralizing background layer is a distance @xmath54 away from the 2d electron layer , for coulomb repulsion , we will have @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "the standard hartree - fock decoupling  @xcite of the interaction term ( [ eq : ham7 ] ) leads to the following mean - field hamiltonian , @xmath57 where @xmath58 are the anti - symmetrized matrix elements for the electron - electron interaction and @xmath59 is the density matrix determined self - consistently . we introduce a finite temperature ( much smaller than the bulk - gap between the cf landau levels for a given interaction  @xcite ) to achieve rapid convergence of the iterations which determine the density matrix @xmath60 .",
    "although this leads to non - integer cf occupation numbers , we have checked that the results presented evolve continuously to integer cf occupation numbers as the temperature is lowered .",
    "we consider the mean - field solutions which are uniform along the @xmath38-axis , @xmath61 .",
    "since the landau - gauge basis quantum numbers are good quantum numbers in the bulk , it is clear that the mixing between different cf landau levels occurs only because of the non - uniform background charge density and is confined to a region near the edge . in the following section , we present the results of the hartree - fock mean - field theory for filling fractions @xmath0 and @xmath10 .",
    "we assume that the electron - electron and the electron - background interactions differ only by a sign , @xmath62 ( except when we compare the results with those of wan _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite ) . to investigate the effect of the nature of interactions on the edge dynamics",
    ", we consider gaussian interaction , @xmath63 , characterized by dimensionless real - space range @xmath35 and screened coulomb interaction , @xmath64 , which becomes truly long - ranged as @xmath65 .",
    "let us start this section with results for filling factor @xmath0 . in the hamiltonian formalism",
    ", the @xmath0 system is mapped onto a cf system at filling factor @xmath66 .",
    "in fact , if we take into account only the occupied cf landau level and neglect the higher cf landau levels since they are gapped in the bulk , this system is identical to the @xmath66 quantum hall system studied by chamon and wen .",
    "@xcite it is therefore not surprising that the quantum hall edge at @xmath0 undergoes an edge reconstruction as the width @xmath46 of the background charge - density profile increases .",
    "@xcite however , it is crucial to check the stability of this reconstruction when higher cf landau levels are included ( in an exact treatment , one must take into account _ all _ cf landau levels ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : nu1thomas ] shows the cf occupation number and the electron density for a system with @xmath67 and with four cf landau levels , @xmath68 . as we can see , the edge undergoes reconstruction which is manifest in a strip of charge moving away from the bulk .",
    "a systematic study with increasing number of cf landau levels included in the hartree - fock iterations shows that the reconstruction is stable with increasing @xmath69 .",
    "the left panel in fig .",
    "[ fig : range ] shows the dependence of the reconstruction on the thomas - fermi cutoff @xmath70 .",
    "it is clear that as @xmath71 , the reconstruction becomes easier and more pronounced ; however , it is present even at @xmath72 .",
    "we find that the edge reconstruction is also obtained with a gaussian interaction ( fig .",
    "[ fig : nu1gauss ] ) . as is the case with the screened coulomb interaction , the edge - reconstruction is facilitated by an increasing range ( right panel in fig .",
    "[ fig : range ] ) .",
    "note that as @xmath73 the electron - electron interaction becomes local in real - space and the reconstruction disappears .",
    "the typical temperature dependence of the edge - reconstruction for both types of interactions is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : temp ] . in each case , the edge - reconstruction disappears with increasing temperature .",
    "this is expected since the system becomes more and more classical with increasing temperature .",
    "we also verify that when the temperature is reduced , the self - consistent cf occupation numbers tend towards 0 or 1 ; however the qualitative evolution of edge - reconstruction with varying range of interaction , @xmath70 or @xmath35 , remains unchanged down to @xmath74 .",
    "next we compare the edge - reconstruction results obtained using this approach with those obtained by wan _",
    "_ using exact diagonalization .",
    "@xcite to this end , we assume that the background charge - density is offset by a distance @xmath54 from the 2d electron gas .",
    "thus , we use @xmath75 and study the edge profile as a function of increasing @xmath54 . figure  [ fig : displaced ] shows the cf occupation numbers for @xmath76 ( left ) and @xmath67 ( right ) .",
    "we see that the @xmath0 edge undergoes reconstruction as @xmath54 increases , and that the critical value @xmath77 decreases with decreasing @xmath70 .",
    "these results , in the limit @xmath78 , are quantitatively consistent with those obtained by wan _ et al . _",
    "@xcite and show that the edge reconstructs even with a screened coulomb interaction . as mentioned in the introduction , the edge - reconstruction is an inherently quantum phenomenon ; pure electrostatic considerations require , at least for long - ranged interactions , that the electron - density profile follow the background - charge profile .",
    "the energy cost of deviations from the background charge - density is compensated by the exchange energy gained by the electrons because of the step - like profile . _",
    "these results show that edge reconstructions at @xmath0 are generic and that the long - range nature of the electron - electron interactions is not instrumental to their existence .",
    "_    now we consider the edge states in a quantum hall system at higher fractional filling factors , @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "these systems are mapped onto composite fermion systems at filling factor @xmath81 and @xmath82 respectively . in this paper",
    ", we assume that all electron spins are fully polarized due to the strong external magnetic field , and therefore , in the ground state , the first two ( three ) cf landau levels are occupied .",
    "the top panel in fig .",
    "[ fig : nu2 ] shows the self - consistent cf occupations , with @xmath83 , for gaussian interaction with range @xmath84 ( left ) and for thomas - fermi interaction with cutoff @xmath85 ( right ) .",
    "it appears from these figures that the edge reconstructs with increasing @xmath46 for different values of @xmath35 and @xmath70 .",
    "this , however , is an artifact of the approximation . as the bottom panel in fig .",
    "[ fig : nu2 ] shows , when we include the higher cf landau levels , the spurious edge reconstruction disappears . instead , the effect of increasing @xmath46 is manifest through the increasing width of the region where cf occupation number is unity , @xmath86 . the same physics appears when we consider a system with displaced background layer ( fig .",
    "[ fig : nu2d ] ) .",
    "the figure on the left shows that with increasing background - layer distance @xmath54 , the region where @xmath87 widens .",
    "the figure on the right illustrates how the spurious edge - reconstruction is suppressed with increasing @xmath69 , the number of landau levels used in the hartree - fock iterations . in experimental samples ,",
    "the background layer is situated at a distance @xmath88 away from the 2d electron gas .",
    "it is very difficult to access this regime in the hartree - fock calculations due to numerical limitations .",
    "however , these results suggest that the spin - polarized @xmath79 state is robust against edge reconstruction .",
    "we obtain similar results of the spin - polarized @xmath80 edge .",
    "figure  [ fig : nu3 ] shows the cf occupations numbers for a screened coulomb interaction with @xmath89 ( left ) and @xmath90 ( right ) for @xmath91 .",
    "it is obvious from the cf occupation numbers that the edge remains smooth with increasing @xmath46 ; however if we reduce the number of cf landau levels used in the iterations to @xmath92 , the spurious edge reconstructions ( similar to those seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : nu2 ] top panel ) reappear in this case as well .",
    "the results for @xmath90 ( right ) show that there is a critical @xmath46 ( @xmath93 ) when the system , instead of undergoing reconstruction , suddenly widens the regions where @xmath86 or @xmath94 .",
    "this freedom of varying @xmath95 in steps of one to gain exchange energy , without undergoing reconstruction , is available only at higher filling factors where more than one cf landau levels are occupied in the bulk . _",
    "thus , we find that spin - polarized quantum hall liquids at @xmath79 and @xmath80 are more robust against reconstruction . _",
    "in this paper , we have presented a microscopic analytical calculation of the edge states in the fractional quantum hall regime using the extended hamiltonian theory .",
    "@xcite this approach is particularly suited to the study of edge states at different filling factors and with different system parameters . although we have only considered systems where the neutralizing background provides the confining barrier at the edge , it is easy to incorporate an external barrier in this formalism and it does not change the results qualitatively . in samples prepared with cleaved - overgrowth techniques ,",
    "the edge is sharp and corresponds to a hard - wall for @xmath48 .",
    "it is somewhat difficult to model this situation within the present formalism , since imposing the hard - wall constraint on the composite fermions does _ not _ impose the hard - wall constraint on the electrons ; however , we believe that the results presented here have generic validity .",
    "the two principal findings of this work are as follows : we find that at filling factor @xmath0 , the edge reconstructions are generic and do not depend on the long - ranged nature of interactions , or the smoothness of the confining potential .",
    "in contrast to this result for @xmath0 , we find that for higher filling factors @xmath79 and @xmath80 , a spin - polarized edge is more robust against reconstruction .",
    "the results presented in this paper also show that the qualitative behavior of the edge profile is the same , irrespective of whether the confining potential is created by a neutralizing background which resides in the same plane as the electrons or by a background layer located at a distance @xmath54 away from the 2d electron layer , as is the case with experimental samples . in real samples , by tilting the external magnetic field ,",
    "the ratio of the zeeman energy to the cf landau - level splitting can be varied and the @xmath79 system undergoes a phase - transition from a spin - polarized state to a spin - singlet state .",
    "in such a singlet state , the region of single - occupancy @xmath86 breaks the spin symmetry . this symmetry breaking and the additional energy cost associated with",
    "it suggest that the spin - singlet @xmath79 may undergo reconstruction and have spin - textures at the edge .",
    "the study of these spin - textures in a spin - singlet state is a topic of future work .",
    "the results in this paper shed some light on the nature of edge states and their dependence on the background potential .",
    "these results are based on a hartree - fock mean - field approximation .",
    "the stability of these mean - field results can be checked by performing the time - dependent hartree - fock analysis of the collective excitations at the edge .",
    "for example , the onset of reconstruction at @xmath0 edge can be associated with the softening of the edge collective modes at a finite wave - vector .",
    "@xcite for @xmath0 a comparison with actual sample parameters shows that the samples are most likely in the reconstructed - edge regime .",
    "this is a possible explanation  @xcite for the disagreement between the theoretical prediction  @xcite for the tunneling exponent , @xmath96 , and the experimental results .",
    "@xcite at higher filling factors , the effective field theory models , which are primarily based on luttinger liquid description of the edge - modes , lead to various predictions for the tunneling exponent @xmath35 into the edge of a fractional quantum hall fluid  @xcite .",
    "similarly , numerical calculations based on wavefunctions show that , in contrast to the cll prediction , the tunneling exponent @xmath35 may depend on the range of electron - electron interactions  @xcite .",
    "the disagreement between these predictions and recent experiments  @xcite requires us to re - examine the theoretical assumptions regarding edge modes .",
    "the formalism presented here provides a concrete method to _ calculate these modes at arbitrary filling factors from a microscopic theory _ ,",
    "and therefore it can be used to determine the parameters which characterize various field theory models . to determine the tunneling exponent using the extended hamiltonian theory presents a challenge since , to calculate @xmath35 , it is necessary to express electron creation and annihilation operators ( _ not just densities _ ) in terms of the cf operators .",
    "this is an open problem and its solution will lead to a microscopic method for the calculation of tunneling exponent and other electronic single - particle properties at the edge .",
    "our results at higher filling factors , provided that they remain valid at realistic setback distances @xmath97 , suggest that the spin - polarized edge is more robust against reconstruction , and consequently that the number of edge modes remains unchanged .",
    "therefore the resolution of the discrepancy between theory and experiments , if not attributable to edge reconstructions , may require new ideas and will deepen our understanding of the edge states in the fractional quantum hall systems .",
    "we wish to thank kun yang for helpful comments .",
