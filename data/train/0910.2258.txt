    "quantum effects lead to numerous unusual properties , interesting with respect to the fundamental understanding of critical phenomena ( spin - liquid ground states , bose - einstein condensation in high magnetic fields)@xcite and potential technological applications ( magnetoelectric coupling , ballistic heat transport).@xcite the search for new quantum magnets that enable to challenge theoretical predictions remains a long - standing problem in solid state science , because theoretical studies usually deal with relatively simple models , like the heisenberg model , while the properties of real compounds are often determined by the interplay of numerous effects , such as isotropic and anisotropic exchange interactions , orbital and/or lattice degrees of freedom , etc .    the frustrated square lattice ( fsl ) with isotropic exchange is an archetypal spin model in two dimensions.@xcite this model reveals strong quantum fluctuations due to the combination of low - dimensionality and frustration .",
    "the specific regime of the model is determined by the frustration ratio , i.e. , by the ratio of the next - nearest - neighbor ( nnn ) interaction ( @xmath12 ) to the nearest - neighbor ( nn ) interaction ( @xmath13 ) : @xmath14 .",
    "the frustration ratio determines the ground state of the system  either ordered [ nel antiferromagnetic , columnar antiferromagnetic , or ferromagnetic ( fm ) ordering ] or disordered.@xcite the precise nature of the disordered [ presumably spin - liquid at @xmath15 ( ref .  ) and nematic at @xmath16 ( ref .  ) ] ground state remains controversial , because a theoretical treatment of the model is inevitably approximate .",

    "the two latter compounds show similar @xmath52 . however , they are different with respect to their nn couplings .",

    "the characteristics of the specific heat are slightly different : the positions of the maxima show the same trend as observed in the susceptibility data .",
    "yet the maximum specific heat value in pbznvo(po@xmath0 is lower than that in pb@xmath17vo(po@xmath0 and comparable to @xmath55 in srznvo(po@xmath0 .",
    "still , this result is likely insignificant , because the @xmath55 value is affected by the impurities . in sec .",
    "[ experiment ] , we have shown that both the magnetization and the specific heat data point to @xmath56  % of diamagnetic impurities in the samples under investigation . once this error is corrected , we find @xmath57 which coincides with the result for pb@xmath17vo(po@xmath0 .",
    "moreover , @xmath58 rescales to 0.191 in perfect agreement with @xmath59 in pb@xmath17vo(po@xmath0 .",
    "our comparison of the different fsl materials indicates that the spatial anisotropy of the spin lattice has a minor effect on thermodynamic properties .",
    "the behavior of the magnetization and the specific heat is mainly determined by the frustration ratio that controls the magnitude of quantum fluctuations and determines spin correlations in the system .",
    "this finding provides experimental verification for simulation results which consistently showed weak changes in thermodynamic properties upon the distortion of the fsl.@xcite thus , the distortion of the spin lattice is a secondary effect compared to the frustration . in the case of the fsl ,",
    "low - symmetry materials with complex structures can be reliably considered as experimental realizations of the regular model .    extending the above statements to the ground state properties and using @xmath52",
    ", one would suggest that pbznvo(po@xmath0 undergoes long - range ordering towards columnar antiferromagnetic state at @xmath60  k ( in zero field ) .",
    "this suggestion is further confirmed by the reference to pb@xmath17vo(po@xmath0 with similar exchange couplings ( @xmath61  k , @xmath62  k ) , similar @xmath63  k , and similar transition anomalies in the magnetic susceptibility and the specific heat.@xcite the columnar afm ordering in pb@xmath17vo(po@xmath0 was directly confirmed by neutron scattering and nuclear magnetic resonance measurements.@xcite thus , a similar ordering in pbznvo(po@xmath0 looks likely .",
    "then , the role of the spatial anisotropy is mainly restricted to determine the direction of columns .",
    "since @xmath64 , we expect that spins will show parallel alignment along the @xmath65 direction ( interaction @xmath13 ) . to test this prediction , further neutron scattering studies are desirable .",
    "we also hope that experimental realizations of the spatially anisotropic fsl will stimulate theoretical investigation of the respective model .",
    "finally , we turn to the structural aspects of the study .",
    "different geometries of the [ vopo@xmath18 ] layers in the aa@xmath1vo(po@xmath0 compounds stimulated us to study the geometrical parameters that influence the exchange couplings .",
    "for the nnn interactions @xmath12 and @xmath67 , these parameters are the v  o and o  o distances",
    ". mutual orientation of the vo@xmath24 pyramids and the po@xmath18 tetrahedron has minor effect on the exchange integrals ( within a reasonable range of possible geometries ) .",
    "the role of the tetrahedrally coordinated x cation is to define the size of the tetrahedron and the relevant o ",
    "o distance . as the x cation gets larger , the nnn interactions in the fsl materials are reduced .",
    "this result helps to explain the change of @xmath12 in the family of the fsl compounds .",
    "vanadium phosphates normally show @xmath9 of @xmath68  k@xcite in agreement with the small size of the p@xmath69 cation ( ionic radius @xmath70  a,@xcite typical o  o separations @xmath71",

    "the promising candidate is as@xmath69 with @xmath85  a@xcite and typical @xmath86  a , providing @xmath12 of about 5  k or even lower .",

    "the chemistry of vanadium(iv ) arsenates remains weakly explored ( in particular , none of the aa@xmath1vo(aso@xmath0 compounds have been reported ) and demands further investigation .",
