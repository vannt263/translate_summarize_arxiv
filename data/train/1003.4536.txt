    "the outskirts of a galaxy are expected to host signatures of disk formation and hierarchical accretion because of the long dynamical times at these radii .",
    "@xcite argued that the thinness and coldness of inner galactic disks ( inside the optical radius , @xmath1 ) posed significant problems for hierarchical models of galaxy formation .",
    "qualitatively , these concerns become more pronounced if one can establish that cold galactic disks extend to even larger radii .",
    "various studies have revisited the cold disk problem , generally finding that accretion events are less destructive than originally envisioned .",
    "most recently , @xcite studied the dynamical response of thin galactic disks to bombardment by cold dark matter substructure out to large radii in fully self - consistent , dissipationless @xmath11-body simulations .",
    "they found that disks survive these bombardments , but that they produce considerable thickening and heating at all radii , substantial flaring , and an increase in the stellar surface density in the disk outskirts ( the latter due to outward radial migration of old stars during the growth and redistribution of disk angular momentum ) .",
    "observations of the dynamical state of outer stellar disks @xcite demonstrate that outer disks generally continue to obey the flat rotation curves of inner disks , with no increase in the in - plane velocity dispersion .",
    "here we present the face - on kinematics of one nearby galaxy , ngc 628 ( m74 ) , and compare to both neutral hydrogen and existing stellar measurements at smaller radii .",
    "ngc 628 is a prototypical grand design spiral galaxy ( type sa(s)c , dynamical mass within the studied region @xmath12 , assuming @xmath13 km  s@xmath6  out to @xmath14 ; * ? ?",

    "* ) , and is by far the largest and most massive member of its small group ( the brightest member after ngc 628 , ugc1176 , is @xmath15 mag fainter and over 125 kpc away ) .",
    "ngc 628 shows a standard exponential optical light profile to @xmath1 , with only a very slight possible downbending in the profile to @xmath16 , the extent of the deep optical observations @xcite . using ultraviolet ( uv ) imaging",
    ", @xcite classified ngc 628 as a type 1 extended uv ( xuv ) disk , due to the structured , uv - bright emission complexes seen in the outer disk . because the stellar disk appears largely undisturbed ( both in optical and uv imaging , and , as we will show , from the kinematics ) and because ngc 628 dominates the dynamics of its local environment , we treat it as representative of large , isolated spiral galaxies in the nearby universe .",
    "the outer disks of galaxies have received much recent attention , both observational @xcite and theoretical @xcite .",
    "the surge in interest in outer disks has been fueled by recent ultraviolet ( uv ) observations of nearby disks with the galex satellite @xcite .",
    "previously , @xcite had used deep h@xmath0   imaging to discover star formation in an extended component around three nearby galaxies , yet the ubiquity of this component in other disks remained largely unrecognized until the uv observations .",
    "this neglect stemmed in part from the fact that h@xmath0  traces a limited subpopulation of the outer disk , namely those regions with o and b stars .",
    "even relatively young regions may lack ob stars because they are older than 10 myr or because they simply did not form such massive stars @xcite . as such",
    ", the ubiquity of outer disk star formation is somewhat concealed .",

    "* ) , even isolated galaxies show low - levels of ongoing star formation in their outer parts @xcite . however , the h@xmath0  knots provide the bright emission lines that make it possible to measure the kinematics we present here .    while the gaseous outer disk of ngc 628 has been well - studied , for example by @xcite , the stellar component near the outskirts of the disk",
    "remains poorly characterized .",
    "observers have acquired deep broadband imaging of the outer disk of ngc 628 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "to sidestep the difficulty of obtaining detailed kinematics from low surface brightness emission , @xcite use planetary nebulae ( pne ) across the face of ngc 628 to trace the underlying stellar distribution and to estimate the total mass density of the disk using the kinematic approach of @xcite ( specifically , by measuring the vertical velocity dispersion of a tracer of the disk mass distribution to estimate the underlying surface mass density ) . in principle , the pne provide an excellent approach to the problem , with large numbers of pne available for analysis .",
    "unfortunately for our purposes , the @xcite study of pne in ngc 628 is mostly constrained to the inner disk ( only two of their pne are beyond @xmath1 ; their study of m83 and especially m94 yield more pne in those outer disks , however those are interacting systems for which the kinematics are complicated by recent events ) .",
    "the current work represents the first to analyze the disk kinematics out to @xmath20 in ngc 628 .",
    "nevertheless , the results from @xcite at the largest radii ( @xmath21 ) provide an interesting comparison to the results found here , especially because the pne trace a population of objects that is on average at least @xmath22 older than the h@xmath0  knots considered here .",

    "however , as @xcite have shown , the outer gas disk of ngc 628 is chaotic and non - uniformly rotating . whether this is also true for the outer stellar disk is unknown , and therefore whether we should use the previous orientation parameters obtained for the inner disk or some other ones is unclear .",
    "we therefore present results using various models for the disk orientation and kinematics , and accept the model with the lowest resulting velocity dispersion as the one most likely to be correct .",
    "results of the following analysis will be discussed further in  4 .",
    "we use a maximum likelihood approach to estimate the gaussian parameters best describing the _ unbinned _ relative velocity ( @xmath50 ) distributions . specifically , we search a grid of mean and dispersion values ( from @xmath51 to @xmath52 km  s@xmath6  and @xmath53 to @xmath54 km  s@xmath6 , respectively ) for the combination that yields the highest total probability ( likelihood ) of the gaussian function , using the unbinned @xmath50 values as the independent variable .",
    "our velocity dispersion estimates will provide only a single value for the radial range spanned by the knots ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "we have insufficient detections to measure the velocity dispersion as a function of radius .",
    "the following analysis will therefore consider the outer disk as a constant velocity dispersion , fixed - height component , and the values derived only represent the disk between @xmath55 .",
    "in support of this approach , note that the simulations of @xcite predict a roughly constant velocity dispersion in the outer disk .    we examine four models for the outer disk orientation and kinematics .",
    "first , we test a purely face - on disk by assuming a constant 656 km  s@xmath6  systemic velocity .",
    "this ` model ' yields a velocity dispersion of @xmath56 km  s@xmath6 .",
    "second , we adopt the parameters of the inner neutral hydrogen gas disk of @xcite ( inclination @xmath57 , major axis position angle @xmath58 and a mean velocity of 656 km  s@xmath6 ) and a rotation velocity of 170 km  s@xmath6  @xcite and find a velocity dispersion of @xmath59 km  s@xmath6 .",
    "third , we adopt the two - component model of @xcite ( @xmath60 and @xmath61 beyond @xmath62 , using the same inner disk values as the previous case for the knots found at @xmath63 ) and find a velocity dispersion of @xmath64 km  s@xmath6 . finally , we adopt the neutral gas velocities from the nearby galaxy survey ( things ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) at the position of each knot and find a velocity dispersion of @xmath65 km  s@xmath6 .",
    "figure  [ n628_field ] shows the spatial distribution of the knots around the gas disk of ngc 628 , and things gas velocities at the positions of each knot are listed in table  [ tab : dets ] .",
    "this ` model ' tests for the possibility that the knots have low velocity dispersion around a complex velocity field defined by the -emitting gas .",
    "given the result that the velocity dispersion is similar to the simple disk models , we conclude that there is no evidence for highly complex kinematics .",
    "the velocity dispersion estimates generally cluster around 20 km  s@xmath6  and agree to within 1 @xmath66 ( although the one estimate at @xmath64 km  s@xmath6  is just consistent with the others ) .",
    "the general agreement , independent of the model used , suggests that the dominant source of uncertainty is currently the statistical one associated with the limited sample size . because the fourth ` model ' is taken directly from the data and produces a velocity dispersion as tight as do the other models , we adopt this model for the remainder of the paper .",
    "figure  [ vsys ] shows the distribution of velocities relative to the @xcite gas disk values ( the fourth model ) , binned by 15 km  s@xmath6 . we removed a slight , but significant , mean velocity offset ( 17 km  s@xmath6 ) when evaluating the velocity dispersion ; table  [ tab : dets ] and",

    "we attribute this shift to a velocity zero point difference in the various datasets although we were unable to directly identify the cause ( figure  [ n628_field ] shows that the h@xmath0  knots are well - distributed across the face of the disk ; we therefore do not expect that the offset is due to an undersampling of the relative velocity distribution ) .",
    "when we exclude the knot at 01:37:17.86 , + 15:43:51.0 with @xmath67 km  s@xmath6 , which lies on the high velocity cloud ( hvc ) described in @xcite , we arrive at our best ( lowest and most likely ) estimate of the observed h@xmath0  knot velocity dispersion , @xmath68 km  s@xmath6 . excluding the same knot from the other models does not significantly change their values .",
    "the gaussian representing this final _ unbinned _ @xmath50 distribution is overplotted in figure  [ vsys ] ( for presentation , the height of the gaussian is determined by a fit to the binned @xmath50 distribution ; the dispersion is the only value used in our analysis , however ) .",

    "the outlier is the source detected on the high velocity cloud ; we ignore this source in the analysis because its relation to the gas disk is uncertain .",
    "[ vsys],width=336 ]    we now consider the degree to which our observational errors inflate the velocity dispersion measurement ( @xmath69 km  s@xmath6 ) .",
    "subtracting our previous velocity error estimate ( 8 km  s@xmath6 ) in quadrature from the measured velocity dispersion , we estimate that @xmath70 km  s@xmath6 .",
    "we emphasize that @xmath71 is likely to be an upper limit to the vertical velocity dispersion because 1 ) the measurement uncertainty is larger than 8 km  s@xmath6 , 2 ) the uncertainty in the reference -emitting gas velocities was ignored , and 3 ) we may have missed the correct model for the underlying disk kinematics .    our low velocity dispersion measurement suggests a relatively undisturbed stellar disk , which at first seems to contrast with the @xcite observation of a chaotic outer gas disk .",
    "the @xcite observation was strongly influenced by the hvcs and kinematic features at the largest radii , however  the bulk of the gas disk is in fact rather undisturbed ( see figure  [ n628_field ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , a difference between a relatively undisturbed stellar disk and a disturbed gas disk might be expected , considering the results of @xcite and @xcite , who find that type 1 xuv disks ( of which ngc 628 is a member ) cover a wide range of galaxy masses , colors and morphologies , and that these disks may in fact be associated with minor interactions or accretion .",
    "the disturbed structure observed in the gas may result from an interaction event @xcite to which the stellar disk was less sensitive .",
    "such an event may have then triggered the type 1 xuv disk that is observed today .",
    "assuming that the h@xmath0  knot density has the same vertical distribution as the underlying mass density distribution of the disk , for an adopted scaleheight @xmath8 we constrain the surface mass density of the outer disk @xmath72 using our measurement of @xmath47 .",
    "we will return to discuss the validity of this assumption , although we do not have any alternative given our current data .",
    "the relevant equation @xcite is    @xmath73    where @xmath74 for an ` intermediate ' vertical mass density distribution ( between the isothermal sech@xmath7 and exponential distributions ) and @xmath75 is the gravitational constant .",
    "the relation was constructed by solving the boltzmann and poisson equations for plane parallel layers . for a galaxy with a flat rotation curve",
    ", the plane parallel case provides a realistic model from which to estimate the surface mass density @xcite .",
    "because @xcite found mostly flat rotation curves in a sample of 17 nearby outer disks , we expect the plane parallel framework to remain valid in the outer regions ( we further assume a constant scale height over the radial range of the knots ) .",
    "corrections to the relation from a dark halo term are negligibly small at low @xmath48 @xcite ; however , in the outer disk the baryonic disk contribution to the mass budget presumably drops more rapidly with radius than does the dark matter contribution , and so the dark matter may in fact not be negligible in the outer disk . in the following section",
    "we show that the @xcite relation is indeed appropriate at these radii ( we find that no dark matter in the disk is required to explain existing observations , even when assuming a rather large value for @xmath8 ) .",
    "because ngc 628 is nearly face - on , we must estimate the scale height @xmath8 of the tracer particles ( the knots ) indirectly .",
    "@xcite argue , based on stability arguments and the observed velocity dispersion of pne , that the scaleheight near the edge of the region they probe ( @xmath76 kpc ) must be @xmath77 pc .",
    "the vertical disk flaring suggested by the pne analysis resembles the known flaring of gas disks in their outer regions , with neutral hydrogen gas scale heights near @xmath78 pc at the @xmath79 distances considered here @xcite . because the h@xmath0  knots are young and because they lie at radii larger than those probed by the pne , we adopt a scale height for the knots in line with that of the flaring gas , @xmath80 pc at 1.3@xmath1 , the median radius of our h@xmath0  detections .",
    "recall however that we treat the outer disk as a fixed - height component . in reality",
    ", @xmath8 may range between @xmath81 pc and @xmath82 pc over the radii covered by our detections . assuming a constant 700 pc over the entire outer disk therefore implies a large uncertainty in the final outer disk mass , which we assume to be @xmath83 .",
    "this level of uncertainty will not significantly affect our conclusions , however .",
    "finally , we note that our assumption that the h@xmath0  knots trace the same mass distribution as the outer disk gas is different from what one would expect in the inner disk . in the inner disk , molecular clouds ( and their h@xmath0  knots ) have a smaller vertical scaleheight than the mass , which is dominated by the stellar component . in the outer disk , however , where the dominant baryonic component is the gas ( as we show below ) , our assumption is much more appropriate .",
    "whether the h@xmath0  knots trace the neutral gas is more uncertain , although where examined in detail the correspondence appears good @xcite . in view of this ,",
    "a large scaleheight for the outer stellar disk should be expected .",
    "we caution however that if a significant amount of mass extends to heights larger than the 700 pc scaleheight assumed for the knots , we are not sensitive to it with the h@xmath0  knot measurement .",
    "we now estimate the mass density of the outer disk in order to determine the relative contributions of stars and gas to the total outer disk mass . using @xmath84 km",
    "s@xmath6  and our adopted @xmath80 pc , we calculate that the outer disk surface mass density @xmath72 is 7.5 m@xmath85 pc@xmath10 .",
    "the total mass between @xmath3 is then @xmath86 .",
    "we now use results from deep optical imaging of the outer regions of ngc 628 ( @xmath87 mag arcsec@xmath10 at 1.3 @xmath1 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to estimate that the mass - to - light ratio @xmath88 of the outer disk is @xmath89 .",
    "the outer disk mass is therefore not primarily in the form of normal stars . for comparison",
    ", @xcite found that the pne velocity dispersions imply @xmath90 for the inner disk .",
    "reconciling the outer and inner disk @xmath88 values would require a factor of 10 changes in @xmath47 or @xmath72 , neither of which is that poorly constrained .",
    "therefore , as one might expect , we detect a significantly higher @xmath88 in the outer regions .",
    "if we adopt @xmath91 as an upper limit for an old outer disk stellar population @xcite , we find that the dark material in the outer disk must be at least five times more massive than the stellar component . in order to match the @xmath87 mag arcsec@xmath10 observation ,",
    "an outer disk stellar population with @xmath92 would require @xmath93 pc@xmath10 and @xmath94 .",
    "this leaves @xmath95 of dark material to be accounted for .",
    "we now consider the neutral gas component of the outer disk and whether it can account for the optically non - luminous mass .",
    "using the outer disk -emitting gas mass from @xcite ( over the relevant radial range ) , @xmath96 , we estimate the total outer disk baryonic mass ( atomic gas @xmath97 stars ) to be between @xmath98 . comparing this total baryonic mass to the total mass required by the h@xmath0  knot velocity dispersion ( @xmath86 ) , we find that the baryonic matter ( mainly the -emitting gas ) can account for nearly all of the measured outer disk mass ( note that we have ignored any molecular gas contribution ) . our assumption that the dark matter contribution to the disk is negligible at large radii appears justified , as does our claim that the gaseous component dominates the baryon budget .",
    "a separate intriguing question is whether star formation has occurred at the current rate for the entire lifetime of this galaxy .",
    "the result of such a stellar component could , in principle , violate the surface brightness or surface mass density measurements .",
    "independent of the surface brightness measurement we can simply calculate whether the integrated star formation results in a mass density in conflict with the measurement .",
    "using deep h@xmath0  imaging of three nearby late - type spiral galaxies ( one of which is the current focus ; ngc 628 , ngc 1058 and ngc 6946 ) , @xcite found their outer disk star formation rate densities to be between @xmath99 pc@xmath10 gyr@xmath6 . for the following exercise ,",
    "we adopt a sfr density of @xmath100 pc@xmath10 gyr@xmath6 for the outer disk of ngc 628 . for comparison to the @xcite sfr densities , @xcite used galex fuv imaging to measure the sfr density in the outer disk of m94 and found @xmath101 pc@xmath10 gyr@xmath6 . the star formation in the outer regions of m94",
    "is unusually large however , producing an anti - truncated optical disk light profile ( ngc 628 shows a standard exponential optical light profile to @xmath1 , with only a very slight possible downbending in the profile to @xmath16 , the extent of the deep optical observations ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for ngc 628 , assuming uniformly - distributed constant star formation over a hubble time leads to an expected stellar outer disk mass of @xmath102 ( @xmath103 pc@xmath10 ) , well within our measured mass of @xmath104 and within the stellar mass inferred from the measured surface brightness ( @xmath94 for a population with @xmath92 ) .",
    "we conclude that the outer disk may have been forming stars for the entire lifetime of the galaxy at approximately the current star formation rate .",
    "we now compare the outer disk velocity dispersions of the young ( @xmath105 myr ) and old ( 100 myr @xmath23 10 gyr ) populations , traced by the h@xmath0  knots and pne @xcite , respectively , and find little difference ( @xmath76 km  s@xmath6  vs.  @xmath106 km  s@xmath6 ; a small difference may be allowed if we treat the h@xmath0  velocity dispersion as a true upper limit , however ) .",
    "because the difference is unlikely to be much larger than the @xmath107 error of the measurement , we can not say that there is a significant difference in the kinematic or structural properties between the young and old outer disk populations .",
    "a powerful tracer of the evolution of stellar populations of different ages is the increase of velocity dispersion with age , or , alternatively , the varying asymmetric drift of various populations .",
    "the observed low @xmath47 of the h@xmath0  knots immediately suggests that the degree of asymmetric drift will be small .",
    "if one considers that some fraction of the observed value must reflect the intrinsic dispersion of the gas , then the asymmetric drift will be even smaller .",
    "the other population that has been measured , pne , also has a low velocity dispersion and the inferred asymmetric drift is also relatively small ( @xmath108 km  s@xmath6 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . with the current measurements",
    "we can not conclude that there has been any increase in the velocity dispersions between the very young h@xmath0  knots and the older pne ( we comment further on this issue in the following section ) .",
    "it is evident that such an investigation will require uncertainties in the velocity dispersions better than @xmath109 km  s@xmath6 .",
    "we have measured the kinematics of h@xmath0  knots in the outer disk of ngc 628 .",
    "we find the stellar disk ( traced by the h@xmath0  knots ) to have a low velocity dispersion , suggesting an undisturbed extended stellar disk .",
    "ngc 628 differs from the better - known outer disks of m83 and m94 , which were likely accentuated by recent disturbances from neighbors , but resembles ( both in optical and kinematic profiles ) the outer disks detected in other relatively undisturbed nearby edge - on disks by @xcite , supporting the idea that outer disk star formation can be a low - level and ongoing phenomenon in isolated galaxies .",
    "we find @xmath47 of the h@xmath0  knots to be @xmath5 km  s@xmath6  between @xmath3 ( @xmath4 kpc ) .",
    "we adopt a scaleheight similar to the known flaring gas profiles of outer disks ( @xmath80 pc ) and estimate a mass density @xmath110 m@xmath85 pc@xmath10 that can be entirely explained by the observed gas and stars in the outer disk .",
    "if the h@xmath0-hosting disk is actually much thinner than the flaring gas disk , more dark matter in the outer regions would be allowed . assuming that outer disk star formation has been going for a hubble time does not violate either the surface brightness nor surface mass constraints .",
    "the high incidence of outer disks ( c.f . * ? ? ?",
    "* ) suggests that the star formation is not a rare phenomenon  here we show that current limits can not exclude long - lived outer disk star formation .",
    "finally , the velocity dispersion of pne towards the outer disk of ngc 628 @xcite is nearly the same as that of the h@xmath0  knots ( the discrepancy grows slightly when considering the dispersion of the h@xmath0  knots as a strict upper limit , although any plausible difference remains small )",
    ". this can result either if the pn population is rather young ( so that scattering has not had a chance to enlarge the dispersion significantly ) , if there is very little scattering , or if scattering occurs primarily in a single ( or few ) discrete events that occurred prior to the creation of the bulk of the pne .",
    "we do not expect the outer disk to be exclusive young ( see above ) and we do expect some level of scattering in outer disks ( if not from the classical spiral arms and molecular clouds of inner disks , then perhaps from satellites and dark halo substructure ) .",
    "the solution may be found in the @xcite simulations , which show that outer disk heating is dominated by the most massive infall event of halo substructure onto the disk , so that stellar populations of different ages do not necessarily have different velocity dispersions .",
    "a larger sample of outer disk kinematic measurements could be used to constrain the rate and impact of such infall events .",
    "this work made use of things , ` the nearby galaxy survey ' @xcite .",
