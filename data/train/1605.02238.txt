    "some of the defining features of the upcoming 5 g networks are native support for , ultra - high reliability , and integration of different communication technologies @xcite @xcite .",
    "specifically , 5 g is expected to cover new use cases such as mission critical , whose requirements exceed the capabilities of current technologies . reliability requirements in terms of packet loss rates may be as high as 5-nines to 9-nines , while also the acceptable latency may be down to few milliseconds @xcite .",
    "while there are proposals for how to decrease the end - to - end latency in cellular systems , e.g. , by reducing the @xcite , the very high levels of reliability can most feasibly be achieved by the integration of multiple communication technologies @xcite .",
    "the use of multiple communication technologies is conceptually very similar to many existing multipath protocols that can increase reliability of communication between two end hosts @xcite .",
    "however , given the strict latency requirements of mission critical mtc , we can not use protocols that rely on error detection and retransmission .",
    "instead we focus on path diversity @xcite , with the additional constraint that each path must use a different communication interface . while this clearly improves reliability , the bandwidth usage increases .",
    "if the transmitted information is split in parts and only some parts are sent over each interface , it is possible to trade - off bandwidth usage and reliability according to the targeted application .",
    "for this , it is necessary to estimate the reliability of the multi - interface communication system , while accounting for component failures as well as the achievable latency of the different interfaces that may use different technology .    in this paper",
    "we propose an analysis framework that allows us to estimate the latency and reliability performance of different multi - path transmission configurations by combining traditional reliability engineering methods with technology specific latency - reliability characteristics .",
    "first , in sec .  [ sec : reliability_in_comms ] we introduce the concepts of reliability in communications , which is followed by the system model for the considered mission critical mtc scenario in sec .",
    "[ sec : system_model ] .",
    "hereafter , we present the proposed analysis and modeling framework in sec .  [",
    "sec : reliability_miftx ] , which is evaluated numerically in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] .",
    "conclusion and outlook are given in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "in reliability engineering , reliability is the probability that a system can provide uninterrupted delivery of acceptable service for a given mission time @xcite . the most basic approach to estimating reliability is to assume exponential failure times and then to use parallel and series systems theory or a state model to calculate the probability of no system failures during the mission time @xcite .",
    "these methods alone do , however , not let us account for the typical latency and jitter of communication technologies . in communications ,",
    "reliability is typically defined as a system s ability to deliver some amount of information ( data packet ) within a certain ( application dependent ) deadline @xcite .        for representing the latency characteristics of an interface",
    ", we use the latency @xcite . for the example in fig .",
    "[ fig : latency_cdf_conceptual ] , the blue curve is the probability that a packet is delivered from source to destination within a certain latency deadline .",
    "that is , for a given latency value @xmath0 on the x - axis , the reliability , i.e. , the probability that the packet latency @xmath1 can be read off the y - axis .",
    "such a curve can be produced from network monitoring measurements , e.g. , by continually pinging the remote host and recording success rate and latency .",
    "the shape of the curve depends on two factors : 1 ) the variability of latency , i.e. , the _ latency distribution _ , due to factors such as medium access , routing , queuing and processing delays , and 2 ) the loss probability due to various failures between two end hosts .",
    "specifically , this loss can be caused by _ transmission errors _ such as low , network access overload , packet drops , and congestion , or by _ infrastructure failures _ such as cable fractures , equipment malfunction , or power outage .",
    "the combined loss probability resulting from transmission errors and infrastructure failures is denoted @xmath2 in the figure . unless @xmath3 , the latency distribution curve never reaches 1 , meaning that the curve is technically not a .",
    "we will refer to it as _ latency - reliability function _ in the rest of this paper .",
    "we consider an m2 m device that needs to communicate reliably with a specific end - host , e.g. , a monitoring device reporting measurements , status and alarm messages to a control unit .",
    "the m2 m device has @xmath4 communication interfaces ( wired and cellular ) available to reach the end - host , as pictured in fig .",
    "[ fig : network_diagram ] . for each interface , a latency reliability function as in fig .",
    "[ fig : latency_cdf_conceptual ] is available .",
    "notice that some technologies are mostly independent while cellular connections that share the same base station may have a higher degree of failure correlation .",
    "when transmitting information from the source to the remote host , one or more of the available interfaces can be used simultaneously .",
    "in addition to packet cloning , where a full copy of the payload is sent on each interface , we consider different splitting approaches in which the source data packet is split into @xmath5 fragments and subsets of these fragments are then transmitted over each interface .",
    "the possibility for reducing the bandwidth usage is useful with cellular technologies , since 1 ) resources in licensed bands are scarce and costly , and 2 ) the reduction of payload size reduces latency . due to the dependence on the packet size ,",
    "it is necessary to characterize the relationship between payload size and latency distribution .",
    "we specify the latency - reliability function of interface @xmath6 as @xmath7 .",
    "this gives the probability of being able to transmit a data packet of @xmath8 bytes from a source to a destination via interface @xmath6 within a latency deadline @xmath0 .",
    "in other words , the value of @xmath7 is the achievable reliability ( @xmath9 , c.f . , fig .",
    "[ fig : latency_cdf_conceptual ] ) for a latency value @xmath0 and payload size @xmath8 .",
    "further , by @xmath10 we refer to @xmath2 ( defined in fig .",
    "[ fig : latency_cdf_conceptual ] ) for the @xmath6th interface .",
    "this section presents the proposed methods for evaluating the reliability of multi - interface transmissions .      for transmissions using packet cloning over @xmath11 interfaces that can justifiably be considered independent , e.g. , an optical fiber link and a cellular link",
    ", we use the traditional parallel systems @xcite method to combine the latency - reliability functions : @xmath12 however , for cellular networks whose base station equipment may be located in the same tower , complete independence can not be assumed , in case of common root cause failures .",
    "correlated failures can be modeled for example by using a state model .",
    "for such a model , we calculate the combined latency - reliability function as : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the number of states in the , @xmath15 is the steady - state probability of state @xmath16 in the , and @xmath17 characterizes the latency - reliability function of state @xmath16 .",
    "notice the use of superscript ",
    "st  to not confuse the latency - relibility function of a state ( @xmath18 ) with a latency - reliability function of an interface ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "since the latency - reliability function to use for a given system state ( @xmath17 ) depends on the considered system model and whether packet cloning or splitting is used , we need to first introduce the specific case study that we consider in this paper before we can define it further .",
    "we assume that the m2 m device in fig . [",
    "fig : network_diagram ] is connected by fiber and has two cellular interfaces , denoted by @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "this is a typical mission critical mtc use case from smart grid systems @xcite .",

    "[ fig:15-state_diagram ] shows the different modes of operation considered for the case study . for each of the considered transmission strategies , we present a short description and define the state - specific latency - reliability functions @xmath17 for @xmath22 that are represented by the vector @xmath23 .    in the following ,",
    "the shorthand notation @xmath24 is the latency reliability function normalized by the availability @xmath25 , thereby making @xmath26 a cdf .",
    "we do this because we have used @xmath27 in the parametrization of the model . by normalizing @xmath2 out of the latency - reliability function and including it in the ctmc we enable the use of probability theory for the following analysis .",
    "the value of @xmath28 depends on the transmission strategy used , as specified in table [ tab : split_strategies ] .",
    "further , for compact notation of interface - specific latency - reliability functions , we let @xmath29 represent fiber , @xmath30 is @xmath20 , and @xmath31 is @xmath21 .",
    "illustrations of the strategies and packet size scaling parameters @xmath28 , are shown in table [ tab : split_strategies ] and they are explained in the next section .",

    ".packet splitting strategies and parameters [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      this approach is similar to the above except that the distribution of fragments is different .",
    "we acknowledge that fiber will likely not be bandwidth limited as a cellular interface , thus , we can send a full copy via fiber , and second we divide the load on the cellular networks more fairly , according to their latency characteristics .",

    "the latency - reliability function vector @xmath45 for the _ weighted _ strategy is shown in table [ tab : p_vectors ] and here we use that the cdf of the latency of the last arriving is @xmath46 .",
    "for the numerical results we will consider a specific scenario with fiber and cellular technologies c1 and c2 being hsdpa and edge , respectively . the considered technologies are using the reliability specifications shown in table [ tab : f_and_r_rates ] . notice that c1 and c2 can fail simultaneously either due to a common bs failure or independently .        while it is a well - known that the distribution of latency measurements is usually long - tailed @xcite , we assume for simplicity that the latency distribution follows a gaussian distribution .",

    "the unspecified failure and restoration rates have been determined .",
    "the approach to parametrize the ctmc model is explained in the appendix .",
    "table [ tab : f_and_r_rates ] presents the failure and restoration rates used in the numerical evaluation .",
    "with failure and restoration rates fully specified , the resulting latency - reliability performance is calculated using the methods outlined in sec .  [",
    "sec : reliability_miftx ] .",
    "the results denoted _ 2-par , ideal _ assume independence between interfaces , whereas the ones denoted _ 3-par _ are using the model .",
    "the different model results have been verified using matlab - based simulation .",
    "we first simulated the transitions between states in the model in fig .",
    "[ fig:15-state_diagram ] with exponential sojourn times given from the rates in table [ tab : f_and_r_rates ] .",
    "hereafter we replayed the state sequence and for every 1 min simulation time , a random gaussian latency value was drawn for the interfaces available in the current state . depending on the required packet fragments of the strategy either a transmission latency or timeout value resulted .",
    "the cdf of these values is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cdfs_modes ] .    in all plots in fig .",
    "[ fig : cdfs_modes ] we see that the _ cloning _ strategy , which uses a total bandwidth of @xmath52 , achieves the highest reliability of more than 5-nines for higher latency values . on the contrary ,",
    "the _ 2-of-3 _ strategy that uses a total bandwidth of @xmath53 has the worst reliability of all strategies , since it can not work with fiber alone , but needs at least one working cellular link as well . in the leftmost plot with lte and gprs for @xmath54 bytes ,",
    "the weighted strategy is not applicable , since lte has a 10 times lower latency than gprs and splitting the payload across the two interfaces therefore does not make sense bytes is needed before assistance from gprs is meaningful . ] . in the center and rightmost plots",
    "where @xmath55 bytes and the used hsdpa and edge have more similar latency , there is a latency reduction of 25 - 30% at the 4-nines level compared to cloning on 2 and 3 interfaces ( blue and yellow curves ) . for bigger packets",
    "even larger reductions can be expected . keeping in mind that the _ weighted _ strategy uses a total bandwidth of @xmath56 like _ 2-of-3 _ , makes it the better choice .",
    "generally , it is interesting that traditional series , parallel , and @xmath11-out - of-@xmath5 reliability models are applicable and very accurate for modeling reliability of packet splitting strategies .",
    "it is expected that 5 g technologies must integrate various communication technologies to provide ultra - high reliability . to estimate the latency and reliability of such an integrated communication system",

    "more advanced models than the used can be used , for example resulting from fault tree analysis .    in a case study based on availability and latency measurements from the field",
    ", we compared different transmission strategies and showed how weighted packet splitting over the cellular interfaces can give substantial latency reductions while maintaining 4-nines reliability . in comparison , using packet cloning on three interfaces yielded 5-nines reliability for higher latency values .",
