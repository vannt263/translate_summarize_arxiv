    "since the first results from the radiochemical chlorine experiment of davis and his collaborators , the considerable deficit in the solar neutrino flux respect to the corresponding theoretical predictions has been the essence of the solar neutrino problem ( snp ) . presently , there are four running experiments  @xcite , which measure different contributions to the solar neutrino flux , and all four of them report rates that are just a fraction of the corresponding theoretical prediction .",
    "several analysis  , which use the information from all the experiments and only mild theoretical assumptions , show that the snp is now practically independent of the details of the solar models and strongly suggest a modification of the neutrino properties .    giving neutrinos a small flavor - non - diagonal mass offers the attractive possibility of reconciling theory and experiments with a minimal change of the standard neutrino physics . in the context of a two flavor analysis there exist two kind of solutions : vacuum oscillations ( vo ) , also known as just - so oscillations , and mikheyev - smirnov - wolfenstein ( msw ) matter enhanced oscillations ( see refs .",

    "the main differences between recent similar analyses  @xcite and ours are the use of the new gallex data  @xcite and the use of the recalibrated chlorine data  @xcite , whose average is now a standard deviation higher than the value that has been quoted in the past few years .",
    "nowadays experiments explicitly aimed at measuring the flux of @xmath0be neutrinos are a recognized priority  @xcite : we consider the impact of such measurements , and in particular of borexino  @xcite .",
    "more specifically , in this paper we want to address the following questions : + ( 1 ) what are the chances of vo and msw in the light of the data presently available ? + ( 2 )",
    "is it possible that future experiments , and in particular borexino , will be able to measure a large ( close to the ssm prediction ) @xmath0be flux ? + ( 3 ) can a measurement of the @xmath0be line discriminate between vo and msw solutions within the regions of parameters that are allowed by present data ?",
    "+ ( 4 ) can a measurement of the pep line be of significant help in this respect ? + ( 5 ) it is well - known that seasonal modulations of the expected signal occur naturally in the vo scenario : is there any positive hint of such modulations in the available data ?",

    "we have also made several tests with the most recent model by bahcall and pinsonneault  @xcite ( bp95 ) , which includes diffusion of heavy elements , and we have found that our conclusions would not be significantly modified .",
    "we consider both the case when the electron neutrino oscillates into an active neutrino , which then contributes to the kamiokande signal , and the case when the electron neutrino oscillates into a sterile neutrino .",
    "it is well - known that there are two ranges of masses for which two - flavor neutrino mixing has the possibility of explaining present data : the msw mechanism , which we consider in sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] , works for masses @xmath1 , while the so - called vo or just - so solution , which is the topic of this section , needs masses @xmath2 .    as mentioned in the introduction , we evolve neutrino amplitudes numerically from the production to the detection point with a hamiltonian that explicitly contains the interaction with matter . for a given choice of mixing parameters @xmath3 ,",
    "the result is a survival probability @xmath4 that depends on the neutrino energy @xmath5 , the production point @xmath6 and the time of the year @xmath7 ( it actually depends only on the distance between the production point and the position of the detector at a given time of the year ) .",
    "incidentally , we verified that the simpler procedure of evolving neutrino amplitudes in vacuum over the distance from the surface of the sun to the detector gives results within a few percents of the exact evolution , i.e. matter has the only effect of inhibiting the oscillations inside the sun in the mass range of vo .",
    "let us define the cross sections of the @xmath8-th experiment for detection of electron neutrinos @xmath9 and for detection of the other - flavor neutrinos @xmath10 ; of course , @xmath11 when the detection is only through charged current ( cc ) or if electron neutrinos oscillate into sterile neutrinos .",

    "we find @xmath33 and @xmath34 for active and sterile neutrinos , respectively .",
    "all in all , a mechanism where the electron neutrino mixes with an active neutrino provides a very good description of the most recent solar neutrino data , while the mixing with a sterile neutrino is excluded at the 95% c.l ..    in figs .  [ fig1 ]",
    "we show the region of parameters that the combination of the 4 experiments allows at the 68% ( @xmath35 ) and 95% ( @xmath36 ) c.l . for oscillations into active and sterile neutrinos .",

    "regions ) and with sterile ( only 95% c.l .",
    "region ) neutrino are shown on the same figure ( c ) .    the comparison between the different areas of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] is interesting : gallium experiments allow a wide region of parameters , and the best fit is mostly the result of compromising the higher suppression implied by the chlorine datum and the lower one needed by the kamiokande datum .",
    "the combination of these constraints roughly selects parameter regions where the contribution to the chlorine signal from the neutrino spectrum below about 5  mev ( beryllium , cno and part of the boron flux ) is more suppressed than the contribution from the boron flux above 5  mev .",
    "if the electron neutrino mixes with a sterile neutrino , the boron flux above 5  mev needs to be suppressed even less to reproduce the kamiokande data , the contrast with the chlorine data increases and the fit becomes worse .",
    "so far we have discussed the best fit point ; the study of a few other solutions with reasonable confidence level is also of interest .",
    "to get an idea of the signal to be expected in future @xmath0be experiments , we show in table  [ tbl2 ] , together with information about the best fit points , also the points corresponding to minimum and maximum yearly averaged @xmath0be signal within the 90% c.l .",
    "region in the third and fourth column .",
    "contrary to general expectation , we see that the chance of a @xmath0be signal close to the ssm prediction is not at all excluded . on the other hand ,",
    "a @xmath0be flux smaller than about 1/4 of the ssm prediction would be a strong indication against vo ; in fact the @xmath0be signal must be larger than about 2/5 of ssm prediction if neutrinos are active and detection is by charged current ( cc ) plus neutral current ( nc ) as in kamiokande or borexino .",
    "our fits to the experimental data are somewhat better than the ones shown in the recent literature  @xcite .",
    "the only important differences between our calculation and the others are in the gallium and chlorine data . for the gallium data , we use the most recent value quoted by the gallex collaboration  @xcite , and include in the analysis the sage value  @xcite . for the chlorine experiment we use the most recent value  @xcite , which happens to be a standard deviation higher than it used to be as a consequence of the recalibration of all chlorine data .",
    "we verified that our use of a new and higher chlorine datum explains our better fit , as expected by the fact that the fit in this part of the bethe plane is mostly constrained by the chlorine and kamiokande experiments .",
    "the uncertainties of the ssm parameters imply corresponding uncertainties in the prediction of the neutrino fluxes and , therefore , in the theoretical signals .",
    "since the same parameter can affect more than one flux , and the same flux can contribute to more than one signal , the resulting errors are strongly correlated .",
    "these correlations have been taken into account in two ways : ( a ) by using the full correlation matrix ( for details see ref .",
    "@xcite ) and ( b ) by making a monte carlo simulation ( see appendix ) .",
    "the two approaches give essentially the same result , and in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we present only the iso - curves obtained with the first method .    with respect to the case without theoretical errors , the position of the best fit is the same , and the quality of the fit is basically unchanged : @xmath30 is now 2.2 against the previous value of 2.4 , for active neutrinos , while @xmath30 is 6.1 against 6.2 , for sterile neutrinos .",
    "physically , the quality of the fit does not improve significantly since at the point of best fit the best compromise has already been reached , and a variation of any of the major fluxes in either direction only makes the fit worse .",
    "taking into account the theoretical uncertainties makes only the confidence regions larger , as it is shown in fig .",
    "in fact , contrarily to what happens for the best fit point , the extra freedom in choosing the fluxes allowed by the theoretical uncertainties can help to improve the fit in those points where by definition the balance between the fluxes is not optimal .    to test the stability of the vo solution , we have also determined the best fit solutions when the temperature @xmath39 or the astrophysical factor @xmath40 are varied with respect to the values of the ssm .",
    "we report results only for the case of active neutrinos in table  [ tbl3 ] ; they indicate that : + ( 1 ) if @xmath39 varies by @xmath41 we still find reasonable fits ; + ( 2 ) increasing the temperature is preferred over decreasing it ; + ( 3 ) increasing @xmath40 by 50% improves the quality of the fit ( here and in the previous case a higher boron flux in the solar model makes the suppression needed by kamiokande closer to the one needed by the chlorine experiment ) ; + ( 4 ) decreasing @xmath40 by 50% ( i.e a lower boron flux in the solar model ) makes the fit worse ; + ( 5 ) except for the last case , the position of the best fit does not change much , consistently with the fact that we have found the same best fit point with and without theoretical uncertainties ( consider that in this test we have made variations larger than the ones allowed by the uncertainties ) .",
    "+ similar stability tests in the case of the msw solution can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "it is well - known that vo predict that the survival probability should change during the year .",
    "in fact , in the range of masses of interest : @xmath42 , the oscillation wavelength ( in astronomical units @xmath43 , where the energy @xmath5 is in mev and the mass difference @xmath44 in @xmath45ev@xmath46 ) is comparable with the seasonal change of the distance between the sun and the earth ( about 4% of its average value ) .",
    "the detection of this expected seasonal variation is extremely important to test the viability of the vo mechanism . in this subsection",
    "we want to study whether any temporal information can already be extracted from the present data .    to simplify the treatment of the data and improve their graphical impact ,",
    "we have divided the year into six bins as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] . at any rate ,",
    "since all runs are at least one - month long , we find no significant statistical gain in using the information of the individual unbinned runs .",
    "clearly , we face at least two problems : ( 1 ) to which bin(s ) do we assign runs whose duration overlaps with more than one bin ? and ( 2 ) how do we combine ( `` average '' ) individual runs that have been assigned to a bin and , therefore , define a rate for the bin ? different procedures , which we briefly describe in the appendix , have been tested with no significant differences . in the following , we shall consider the second approach described in the appendix .",
    "data have been taken from refs .",
    "@xcite .    in figs .",
    "[ fig5 ] we compare these binned data with the expected variation of the signal for several typical values of the mixing parameters . the variation due to the geometric factor , which is known exactly , is not included in the theoretical calculations and has been taken out from the experimental data , since we are interested only in the time dependence caused by the oscillation .",
    "we have also renormalized data to the yearly averaged signal : we want to separate the effect of the time dependence from the change in the average .",
    "it is already clear from these figures that statistical fluctuations are at the moment much larger than the expected variations .",
    "let us make more quantitative the statement about the present chance of detecting any temporal variation .",
    "let us define @xmath47 where the integral is over the @xmath48-th bin , as defined in fig .",

    "note that both definitions treat the experimental data exactly on the same footing , so that we can safely ascribe any difference to the time variation .",
    "there is no significant difference between the two @xmath25 s , which is not surprising after figs .",
    "[ fig5 ] . at the point of best fit",
    "we find @xmath58 ( constant fit ) , and @xmath59 ( time dependent fit ) .",
    "the 68% and 95% confidence regions remain also basically unchanged , as it is shown in figs .",
    "we have performed the same exercise also for sterile neutrinos : constant and time dependent theoretical predictions produce basically the same confidence regions , which are also similar to those shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , therefore we do not show them again .",
    "different definitions of the confidence regions ( e.g. via monte carlo simulations ) do not change our conclusion ; for more details see appendix .    after having established that the statistics of present experiments is insufficient to detect seasonal variations , let us consider what region of the parameter space",

    "in addition , with such large statistics , it will be possible to study spectral deformation  @xcite .",
    "+ ( c ) : the chlorine experiment would need @xmath62 to be sensitive to the seasonal variations in the region of the best fit point .",
    "the signal from solar neutrinos produced in the reaction @xmath66 is of particular interest in the study of neutrino oscillations .",
    "one of the reasons is that this signal has a fixed energy ( we consider only the more intense line at 0.861  mev ) making more direct the analysis in terms of the oscillation parameters ; in particular , its dependence on the sun - earth distance is not smeared out by integrating over the energy spectrum .    in this section",
    "we analyze the prediction of the vacuum oscillation mechanism for the @xmath0be neutrino flux and we also comment on the significance of a pep line intensity measurement .      in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] we present the yearly averaged suppression for @xmath0be neutrinos superimposed with the 95% c.l .",
    "regions , taken from fig .  [ fig1 ] .",
    "one sees that vo can accomodate all experimental data without requiring drastic reduction of beryllium flux . in other words ,",
    "the @xmath0be signal in experiments is not necessarily very low , if vo are the right explanation .    in table",
    "[ tbl2 ] we present the minimum and maximum expected signal ( normalized to the ssm prediction ) both for the case of cc detection and cc + nc detection .",
    "one sees that signals up to almost the ssm prediction are possible . on the other hand , a strongly suppressed @xmath0be signal ( below about 0.2 for cc detection or below about 0.4 for cc + nc detection )",
    "would be a clear indication against vo .",
    "a measurement of the pep signal would be extremely interesting for three reasons : ( 1 ) the production of pep is very weakly dependent on solar models ; ( 2 ) pep neutrinos are , similarly to the beryllium neutrinos , monochromatic and therefore very sensitive to oscillation mechanisms ; ( 3 ) differently from the @xmath0be , @xmath15b or pp fluxes , there is essentially no experimental information available about the pep flux so far .",
    "analogously to fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] for the beryllium flux , in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] we present the iso - suppression curves for the pep flux .",
    "again we find that the pep flux can take essentially any value , and vo are still consistent with experimental data .",
    "the best fit points correspond to a strong suppression of pep ( see fig .  [ fig11 ] ) . however , there is no strict correlation between survival probabilities of the @xmath0be and pep neutrinos , as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] : in fact in this range of parameters the survival probability oscillates rapidly as a function of the neutrino energy ( compare with the different situation for the msw solution ) .",
    "the specific characteristic of a solution of the snp by means of vo is the expected seasonal variation .",
    "this variation should be particularly pronounced for the monoenergetic beryllium signal .",
    "a detection of this variation by future experiment would provide strong evidence for this mechanism .",
    "+ seasonal variations of the pep signal would also be clearly interesting , but we feel that their detection is beyond the experimental capability , at least in the foreseeable future , and we do not discuss them .    in fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] we show the expected variations for a few representative choices of the parameters within the 90% c.l . allowed regions : the best fit case of maximal ( yearly averaged ) beryllium signal and the point of maximal modulation of the beryllium signal . clearly the modulation is less strong if both cc and nc are detected ( fig .",
    "[ fig12]a ) .",
    "the variation due to the geometric effect ( which can be eliminated exactly from the data ) is not included to make clear the size of the relevant physical effect .    the modulation ( defined as the difference between the signal in the winter , i.e. bins 1,2 and 3 in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , and in the summer semester ) is of the order of 30% of the average value at the best fit parameters .",
    "the maximal variation is not much larger indicating that this size of modulation is typical .    on the other hand , the curve corresponding to the parameters that give the maximal averaged value of the beryllium signal shows almost no modulation : this gives us a warning that vo",
    "do not necessarily imply a significant modulation ( the obvious explanation being that the maximum of the survival probability is a stationary point , i.e. there is no modulation at the first order ) .",
    "the possibility of seeing the seasonal variation of the signal depends on the magnitude of the effect , on the overall statistics and on the signal - to - background ratio .",

    "\\(b ) @xmath69 , i.e. a three time worse background  @xcite .",

    "we conclude that borexino covers very well the interesting region .",
    "this conclusion is true also in the ( pessimistic ) case ( b ) .",
    "several mechanisms have been proposed to resolve the snp .",
    "it is natural to compare the vacuum oscillation mechanism with at least the other most popular one : the msw solution .",
    "the msw mechanism is very robust .",
    "it always provides a very good fit to the experimental data , and the solutions are relatively stable against changes in the ssm . since the experimental data have changed somewhat , we thought better to recalculate the best fit and confidence regions also for the msw mechanism .",

    "the msw solution gives a signal constant in time , while the vo one gives a signal that , in general , depends on the time of the year as we just discussed .",
    "moreover , the deformation of the energy spectrum is different in the two cases  @xcite .",
    "we concentrate here on what can be learned from yearly averaged measurements of the intensity of the be line and , possibly , of the pep line as well .    in fig .",
    "[ fig15 ] we present the expected range of suppression ( whithin the 90% c.l .",
    "region ) of the beryllium signal in a cc + nc detector , e.g. borexino , in the case in which neutrinos mix with an active flavor ( vo , large and small mixing angle msw ) or are standard .    first of all , it is worth observing that high values ( close to ssm ) of the beryllium signal are foreseeable .",
    "in addition : + ( 1 ) a @xmath0be signal larger than about 0.7 of the ssm prediction would only be consistent with the vo solution ; + ( 2 ) in the intermediate range , @xmath72 , both vo and large angle msw solutions are acceptable ; + ( 3 ) in the range above about 0.2 and below about 0.4 basically only the small angle msw solution is consistent with the data ; + ( 4 ) if the @xmath0be signal is less than about 0.2 of the ssm prediction , the solution to the snp can not be mixing with an active neutrino ; + ( 5 ) if the signal is below about 0.14 , there is also a small chance of a solution with standard neutrinos ; this bound comes from the combination of all four experiments and the luminosity sum rule by using methods similar to those in refs .",
    "+ in case of a @xmath0be measurement that can not discriminate between vo and msw , additional information can clearly be derived from the temporal dependence of the signal , which is particularly strong when vo give suppressions around 0.5 .",
    "furthermore , a measurement of the pep flux could be illuminating .",

    "we find that vo are compatible with almost any suppression of the pep flux , as it was the case with the @xmath0be flux .",
    "nevertheless , the combination of the @xmath0be and pep flux information tell us that vanishing @xmath0be and pep fluxes characterizes the small - mixing - angle msw solution , while an equal suppression of the two fluxes points towards the large - mixing - angle msw solution .",

    "( [ chia ] ) and ( [ chib ] ) , our conclusion about the lack of evidence for seasonal variations remains unchanged ; the same is true for all other conclusions .",
    "an other possibility of defining the confidence regions is by monte carlo simulation .",
    "this procedure has the great advantage of being very flexible : we can easily take into account , for instance , theoretical errors without any need of explicitly introducing the correlation matrix , and any other additional information ( e.g. efficiencies ) can similarly be introduced .",
    "we generate a sample of 1000 simulated experimental results according to a probability distribution that takes into account the experimental statistical and systematic errors .",
    "when we want to include theoretical errors , we also generate a sample of theoretical models by letting the input parameters fluctuate according to their uncertainties and calculating the effect of changing the parameters on the ssm by using known scaling rules  @xcite . for each simulated experimental result ( and theoretical model when required ) we compute the value of @xmath25 and compare it to the value obtained from the real data ; we define the c.l . as the percentage of times that the simulated value is smaller than the real one .",
    "we find results that are not significantly different from the ones obtained using the @xmath25 definition used in the main text .",
    "as mentioned in the main text , binning poses at least two questions : ( 1 ) how do we treat runs whose duration overlaps with more than one bin ? and ( 2 ) how do we calculate the rate of a given bin from its individual runs ?",
    "the simplest answer to the first question is that each run is assigned that bin which contains the mean time of exposure , defined  @xcite as @xmath76 \\",
    ", , \\label{tmean}\\ ] ] where @xmath77 and @xmath78 are the starting and ending time of the run , and @xmath79 is the mean - life of the final state ( @xmath80 for electron scattering experiments ) .",
    "this definition is such that we expect half of the detected events to occur between @xmath77 and @xmath81 and half between @xmath81 and @xmath78 .",
    "we have tried a more refined approach .",
    "when the exposure time of a given run overlaps with more than one bin , this run contributes to all the interested bins with a weight proportional to the number of the recorded events which are expected to come from the bin ( this number depends on the length of the overlap and on the mean decay time ) .    a more sophisticated procedure , which correctly uses the full experimental information , consists in applying a maximum likelihood analysis to the time information of all events ( signal and background ) assigned to a given bin .",
    "the disadvantage of this method is that one needs access to the complete event structure of a given experiment to be able to apply this kind of analysis .",
    "since we had access only to gallex complete experimental information , we have verified that , at least for the gallex experiment , the two procedures agree within the errors .      in this part of the appendix we provide the framework for quantitative and simple estimate of the sensitivity of present and future experiments to the time dependence of the neutrino signal , by discussing the behavior of neutrino signals averaged over half year .",
    "let us consider the electron neutrino survival probability averaged over a six month period centered around the perihelion @xmath82 and around the aphelion @xmath83 .",
    "for each experiment , @xmath84 are also averaged over the accessible energy interval , being weighted with the @xmath85 cross section .",
    "we also define the corresponding averaged interaction probabilities @xmath84 , which for a cc + nc detector ( kamiokande and borexino ) and active neutrinos are about : @xmath86 while for cc detectors or sterile neutrinos are obviously : @xmath87 in order to characterize the size times running time of the experiment , we consider the total number @xmath88 of neutrino events that are expected for standard neutrinos . for sufficiently long running times",
    ", the experiment will collect a number of true neutrino @xmath89 given by : @xmath90 if @xmath91 is the number of expected background along the running time , a quality factor of the experiment is @xmath92 , i.e. the ratio of expected neutrino events , for standard neutrino , to background counts .    by dividing the running time in winter and summer semesters , one expects in each semester a number of counts ( neutrinos plus background ) given by : @xmath93 where we assume that the background mean rate is constant during the year .",
    "seasonal modulations can be detected at the @xmath94-sigma level if the difference @xmath95 exceeds at the corresponding level the statistical fluctuation of the total number of counts : @xmath96 for the four running experiments , the accessible region can be determined approximately from the quoted signals @xmath97 and statistical error @xmath98 and the expected signal for standard neutrinos @xmath99 .",
    "in fact , if we use @xmath100 and eq .",
    "( [ fluct ] ) , we find @xmath101 the region of parameters determined by this condition should obviously be intersected with the region such that @xmath102 is consistent with the reported signals .",
    "a more general expression , which is particularly useful for future experiments like borexino , can be obtained from eq .",
    "( [ fluct ] ) by a straightforward substitution : @xmath104 this equation defines the region which can be explored by any experiment , specified by its size times running time ( @xmath88 ) and purity factor ( @xmath105 ) , in the sense that a point in the ( @xmath106 , @xmath44 ) plane can be studied for seasonal modulations at the @xmath94-sigma level , if the corresponding @xmath107 and @xmath108 satisfy the above constraint .    notice that even when the signal to background ratio @xmath105 is quite small , modulations can be detected if @xmath88 is large enough , as it is obvious since for constant background statistical fluctuations become less and less important as the number of counts grows .",
    "in addition , we note that for a high counting rate experiments like borexino get even more detailed information by exploring higher moments of the time dependence and/or resorting to optimal filtering theory .",
    "the semi - annual variation we consider is thus to be interpreted as a subset of the extremely rich time information which can be exploited by borexino .",
