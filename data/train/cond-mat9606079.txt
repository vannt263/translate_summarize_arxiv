    "though manganese oxides had been studied extensively during 50 s and 60s,@xcite the hole - doped manganese oxides @xmath1 have recently driven a considerable attention due to not only the phenomenon of giant magnetoresistance ( gmr)@xcite but also various interesting physical properties such as doping induced metal - insulator transition , antiferromagnetic - ferromagnetic transition , and the structural phase transition@xcite .",
    "these phenomena have been partly explained by the double exchange mechanism.@xcite the ferromagnetic kondo lattice model ( klm ) due to strong hund s coupling@xcite has been proposed to describe the properties of manganese oxides .",
    "recently , a mean field theory , which is valid in infinite dimensions,@xcite has been applied to the klm in the limit of infinite magnitude of local spin.@xcite however , the large resistance drop measured in experiment@xcite has not been shown successfully .",
    "have recently argued that the strong electron - phonon coupling is necessary to explain the colossal magnetoresistance@xcite .",
    "a new experiment@xcite shows that there is no primary lattice distortion anomaly at the magnetic transition temperature .",
    "leaving aside the question how much the polaron physics affects the properties of manganese oxides , we are interested in how well the klm with a strong hund s coupling describes the resistivity drop upon variation of temperature@xcite and pressure@xcite in the manganese oxides .",
    "we feel that proper calculation of the resistivity in this model is necessary to understand how much the electron - phonon interaction is important for the explanation of the experiments .",
    "even though magnetovolume contraction@xcite accompanies across the magnetic transition , we do not consider this effect explicitly in this work .",
    "we suppose that the effect of pressure is to enhance not only hopping between conduction electrons but also scattering rate .",
    "these two effects appear differently in ferromagnetic and paramagnetic states .",
    "the purpose of this work is to show quantitatively how much the resistivity drops due to magnetic ordering and pressure via temperature and transfer integral , respectively .",
    "our work starts from the single - particle density of states ( dos ) which has not been previously obtained through a rigorous calculation for the klm .",
    "we first obtain analytically the dos of the klm on the bethe lattice in the large connectivity .",
    "the method we use here , the so called analytic version of the dynamic lanczos method , has proved useful in describing the optical transport properties of @xmath2@xcite and the doped cuprates@xcite . in a previous work@xcite , analytical calculation of dos through this method has given transparent understanding of the metal - insulator transition in the large - dimensional half - filled hubbard model .",
    "this paper is composed as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we briefly introduce the formalism , and show the single - particle dos in sec .",
    "we present the resistivity depending on temperature and pressure in sec .",
    "iv , and finally give conclusion in sec . v.",
    "the single - particle dos , @xmath3 , is given by@xcite @xmath4 where the angular brackets denote the thermal average and @xmath5 , which is the laplace transform of @xmath6 .",
    "one notes that @xmath5 corresponds to the on - site green function and is the key quantity giving the dos .",
    "one can observe that @xmath5 is just the projection of @xmath7 onto @xmath8 in a liouville space defined by the inner product @xmath9 , where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are operators of the liouville space , and @xmath12 is the adjoint of @xmath11 .",
    "this projection can be obtained most easily in the orthogonalized space .",
    "therefore , we first construct an appropriate orthogonal space .",
    "we choose the first vector @xmath13 as @xmath14 and the second using the gram - schmidt process with a linearly independent vector @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the liouville operator . the rest orthogonal vectors",
    "are obtained via a similar process which may be expressed by the recurrence relation , @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 for @xmath20 .",
    "use of the relation @xmath21 has been made .",
    "applying eq .",
    "( 2 ) to @xmath22 , the projection @xmath5 is represented by the infinite continued fraction@xcite @xmath23 where @xmath24 .    for a nontrivial system , however , the fractional forms of @xmath25 and @xmath26 require expansions in performing the gram - schmidt process analytically , and allow us an orthogonal set satisfying eq .",
    "( 2 ) exactly only in an asymptotic regime , e.g. , strongly or weakly correlated regime .",
    "since @xmath25 provides with energy standard and can be controlled by chemical potential , @xmath25 usually has a simple form .",
    "what makes things hard is @xmath26 which is the ratio of norms of consecutive bases .",
    "since norm is usually given by a polynomial composed of positive terms of an expansion parameter , the ratio of leading terms gives quite good approximation when the terms of each norm show a similar behavior .",
    "this is actually the case we meet in practice .",
    "this maybe happens since we get the bases through a simple recurrence relation .",
    "we argue that the valid region of the asymptotic dynamics extends to the regime where the expansion is allowed .",
    "one can recognize it from the result .",
    "one of us and lee@xcite have shown the dynamics of electron gas in the asymptotic regimes such as small momentum transfer and large momentum transfer limit .",
    "they have shown that the former is good for the regime @xmath27 @xcite , where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are momentum transfer and fermi momentum , respectively and the latter agrees well with experiment for the momentum transfer @xmath30@xcite .",
    "we now apply this formalism to the klm which is written as @xmath31 where angular bracket means nearest neighbor .",
    "the first term represents hopping processes of the itinerant electrons in @xmath32 orbital and the second represents ferromagnetic kondo coupling between localized spin ( @xmath33 ) and itinerant electron spin on @xmath34 ion coming from @xmath35 and @xmath32 orbitals , respectively .",
    "the electron spin @xmath36 can be represented in terms of fermion operators .",
    "therefore we have the following hamiltonian .",
    "@xmath37\\ ] ] where @xmath38 is a classical spin .",
    "the key part of this work is to construct the orthogonal bases @xmath39 s along with @xmath25 and @xmath26 . using the recurrence relation ( 2 ) with @xmath40 and considering @xmath41 for expansion , we obtain the orthogonal bases by taking the leading terms as follows : @xmath42\\nonumber\\\\ f_{4\\nu+3 } & = & -i \\frac{j^{2\\nu+2}}{2 } \\overbrace{\\sigma_j^{\\prime}\\cdots     \\sigma_r^{\\prime}}^{2\\nu+1}\\overbrace{t_{kj}\\cdots t_{qr}}^{2\\nu+1 }   \\overbrace{{\\bf t}_k\\cdots { \\bf t}_p}^{2\\nu}\\nonumber \\\\    & & \\hspace{5 mm } \\times [ ( s^z_q+ s^z_r ) \\delta s^z_r c_{r\\uparrow }     + ( s^-_q+s^-_r)s^{+}_r c_{r\\uparrow }     + ( s^z_q s^z_r - s^-_q s^z_r ) c_{r\\downarrow } \\nonumber\\\\    & & \\hspace{5 mm } -(s^-_q + s^-_r ) \\langle s^z \\rangle c_{r\\downarrow}]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 .",
    "we consider only nearest neighbor hopping so that @xmath47 is the nearest neighbor of @xmath28 , @xmath48 is the nearest neighbor of @xmath47 , and the prime in summation means @xmath49 .",
    "the inner operation of @xmath50 product is defined as the scalar product only with itself .",
    "this operation is valid for classical spins .",
    "we obtain the inner products as follows @xmath51 \\rangle \\nonumber\\\\   & = &   \\frac{j^2}{4 } ( \\langle { \\bf s}^2_k \\rangle- \\langle { \\bf s}_k \\rangle^2 )   \\nonumber\\\\ ( f_2,f_2 )   & = & \\langle j^2 \\sigma_j^{\\prime } t_{kj}^2 [ ( s^z_k+s^z_j)^2    + ( s^-_k+s^-_j)(s^{\\dagger}_k+s^{\\dagger}_j ) ] \\rangle \\nonumber\\\\   & = &   j^2 \\sigma_j^{\\prime } t_{kj}^2 \\langle ( { \\bf s}_k+{\\bf s}_j)^2   \\rangle \\nonumber\\\\   & = &   j^2 \\sigma_j^{\\prime } t_{kj}^2 \\langle { \\bf t}_k^2 \\rangle\\nonumber\\\\ ( f_3,f_3 ) & = & \\frac{j^4}{4 } \\sigma_j^{\\prime } t_{kj}^2 \\langle { \\bf t}_k^2 \\rangle    ( \\langle { \\bf s}^2_j \\rangle- \\langle { \\bf s}_j \\rangle^2 ) \\nonumber\\\\ ( f_4,f_4 ) & = & j^4 \\sigma_j^{\\prime}\\sigma_l^{\\prime } t_{kj}^2 t_{jl}^2    \\langle { \\bf t}_k^2 { \\bf t}_j^2",

    "we take the approximation neglecting the spatial correlations between the localized spins of @xmath34 , that is , @xmath53 for @xmath54 .",
    "where @xmath55 is independent of sites .",
    "therefore @xmath56 .",
    "note that this mean field approximation ( mfa ) is valid in the limit of large connectivity . within this approximation ,",
    "one obtains @xmath25 and @xmath26 as follows : @xmath57 for @xmath43 , where @xmath58 and @xmath59 is the coordination number which is taken to be very large .",
    "now the dos of the up - spin conduction electron at site @xmath47 is given by eqs .",
    "( 1 ) , ( 3 ) , and ( 9 ) , i.e. , @xmath60 this dos shows two separated bands of width @xmath61 , which is @xmath62 when @xmath63 , i.e. , in paramagnetic state . eqs . ( 9 ) and ( 10 ) show that the dos depends on the magnetic properties of the system through @xmath64 and @xmath65 of the localized spin .    below the transition temperature @xmath66 ,",
    "the system is ferromagnetic and the expectation value of @xmath55 can be obtained from the expermental data and @xmath67 is nothing but @xmath68 . above @xmath66 , where the system is paramagnetic , @xmath64 becomes @xmath69 while @xmath70 remains @xmath68 .",
    "1 shows the dos for the hund s coupling strength @xmath71 and a doping concentration @xmath72 using @xmath73 , @xmath74 , and @xmath75 with dotted , dashed , and solid lines , respectively .",
    "the vertical lines indicate positions of the chemical potential .",
    "we only show the lower band since the upper band is nothing but point reflection of lower band about zero frequency , and does not affect resistivity within the range of temperature in which we are interested .",
    "the dos clearly shows the shift of the spectral weight to lower energy side as local spins are ordered .",
    "magnetic ordering enhances up - spin spectral weight and diminishes down - spin spectral weight remarkably .",
    "note that the double exchange model leads us to the rigid band picture and the position of chemical potential is determined only by the amount of filling which results in the change of resistivity upon doping concentration , though our dos , eq .",
    "( 10 ) , does not contain the carrier concentration @xmath76 .",
    "@xcite our dos satisfies sum rule exactly .",
    "the physical quantity we want to examine in this work is resistivity affected by ordering of magnetic moments and pressure .",
    "we show specifically in what follows how magnetic ordering and pressure affect resistivity via obtaining optical conductivity .    optical conductivity in infinite dimensions",
    "is obtained using the following formula@xcite .",
    "@xmath77 where @xmath78 for the bethe lattice , @xmath79 is the fermi distribution function , and @xmath80 where @xmath81 are lattice constant , number of lattice sites , and volume , respectively",
    ".    one can get @xmath82 by calculating the self - energy @xmath83 using the relation @xmath84 applicable to the bethe lattice@xcite and @xmath85 .",
    "the dc resistivity is obtained by taking the zero - frequency limit for the inverse optical conductivity , i.e. , @xmath86 the unit of conductivity is provided by @xmath87 which , in three dimensions , approximately gives mott s minimum metallic conductivity @xmath88.@xcite however the absolute value of the resistivity should depend on the microscopic parameters such as lattice constant in @xmath87 , so one can not determine @xmath87 precisely .",
    "it usually varies of @xmath89 depending on sample .",
    "2 shows temperature dependences of the resistivity for @xmath71 with @xmath72 and magnetization around transition temperature .",
    "the magnetization is obtained as @xmath90 $ ] , where @xmath91 is the @xmath91-factor .",
    "the temperature dependence of @xmath92 has been conjectured as @xmath93 from the mean - field type result , i.e. , @xmath94 .",
    "this magnetic ordering curve shown in fig .",
    "2 is remarkablely similar to the experimental data of magnetization@xcite .",
    "it shows that the larger magnetic ordering induces the larger resistivity drop . since it has been known that @xmath95 has a bandwidth @xmath96@xcite , we set @xmath97 so that the bandwidth @xmath98 in the paramagnetic state , and @xmath99 which is known as a reasonable value of hund s coupling.@xcite the transition temperature is set @xmath100 to compare with the experiment@xcite .",
    "we try to understand resistivity drop more physically through the changes of scattering rate and bandwidth versus local spin fluctuation . in fig .",
    "3 , we show the change of scattering rate , @xmath101 , and bandwidth across @xmath66 to see what governs the resistivity drop .",
    "the scattering rate is given by @xmath102 , where @xmath103 is chemical potential .",
    "( 9 ) and ( 10 ) , we see that the dos has a local spin fluctuation term @xmath104 .",
    "the local spin fluctuation decreases as magnetic ordering increases , which results in broadening of bandwidth and decreasing of scattering rate of up - spin conduction electron which is parallel to the localized spin .",
    "the scattering rate of down - spin conduction electron increases quite rapidly as local spins are ordered .",
    "3 demonstrates that more spin - disorder scattering occurs in the paramagnetic state , and the spin - disorder strongly affects the scattering rate governing the resistivity .",
    "we show pressure effect by changing the transfer integral @xmath105 for a fixed hund s coupling strength @xmath106 .",
    "though the pressure affects both @xmath106 and bandwidth @xmath107 , its effect is much larger for @xmath107 than for @xmath106 .",
    "therefore we make @xmath106 fix and @xmath107 increase as pressure increases .",
    "the proportionality @xmath108 is valid under mfa@xcite , so that @xmath66 is taken at @xmath109 for @xmath110 compared with @xmath111 for @xmath112 .",
    "4 clearly shows that no pressure effect appears in the resistivity above @xmath66 .",
    "the origin of this result can be understood as follows .",
    "we obtain the effective mass using @xmath113 .",
    "the effective mass decreases by increasing @xmath114 , while the scattering rate increases nearly the same amount by increasing @xmath114 , so the effect of change of @xmath114 in the resistivity disappears in the paramagnetic state , if we consider @xmath115 with assuming constant number of charge carriers .",
    "therefore we have to consider the lattice constant appearing in @xmath87 , which will be changed under pressure , to explain the experimental results showing remarkable resistivity drop even above @xmath66 under pressure .",
    "the lattice dynamics may play an important role in the paramagnetic regime near @xmath66.@xcite",
    "we study the temperature and pressure effects on the resistivity of the hole doped manganese oxides by calculating the dos and optical conductivity for the klm with strong hund s coupling using the lanczos continued fraction formalism along with mfa .",
    "these two effects appear in both dos and resistivity , and the results show that the smaller spin disorder induces the smaller resistivity .",
    "our result also shows that there is no resistivity drop in paramagnetic state , above @xmath66 , under pressure , which has a clear discrepancy with many experimental data@xcite .",
    "it demonstrates that either double exchange model losts the main physics in the gmr phenomenon or treating the double exchange model within mfa yields too simple physics , which shows that only local spin fluctuation can change resistivity . above and near @xmath66 , however , the magnetovolume effect may cause further increasing of resistivity due to decreasing of lattice constant in @xmath87 of eq .",
    "this effect should be included to improve the resistivity drop just above @xmath66 and to show the pressure effect shown in experiments@xcite , to some extent .",
    "thus present results indicate that lattice distortion may be crucial as far as the resistivity in paramagnet is concerned and polaron may play an important role in this sense .    this work has been supported by snu - ctp , basic science research institute program , ministry of education and the daewoo fundation .",
