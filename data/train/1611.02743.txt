    "many authors have studied trace maps @xcite , which give an action of @xmath5 on @xmath6 ( here @xmath7 is a rank @xmath2 free group ) and form an interaction between representation theory and dynamical systems .",
    "goldman and others have also studied this action in the context of character varieties , see @xcite .",
    "the case @xmath8 is that usually studied .",
    "here there are elements @xmath9 acting as follows on @xmath10 : @xmath11 this comes from an action of @xmath5 on triples @xmath12 of traces corresponding to pairs of matrices @xmath13 , where @xmath14 are real numbers ; see  [ sec1 ] for more details .",
    "the @xmath5 action preserves the level surfaces @xmath15 of the function @xmath16 a point of @xmath17 will be said to _",
    "lie on level @xmath18_. now @xmath19 contains ( within the cube @xmath20 ^ 3 $ ] ) a curvilinear tetrahedron that is parameterised as : @xmath21 where the action of @xmath5 is given via the corresponding @xmath22-action on @xmath23 .",
    "thus , for @xmath24 , any @xmath25 permutes the points of @xmath26 corresponding to @xmath27 , which therefore have finite @xmath5-orbits .    one can generalize the above to the situation where , for @xmath28 , the automorphism group @xmath0 acts on a trace variety corresponding to @xmath2-tuples of matrices @xmath29 with real traces . in this case",
    "the trace variety is generated by the @xmath30 half - traces @xmath31 here ` generated ' means that for any @xmath32 , the half - trace of @xmath33 is an integer polynomial in these @xmath34 .",
    "we note that these @xmath30 traces are certainly not a minimal generating set ( see @xcite for example ) , however they are natural in our situation .",
    "thus we obtain an action of @xmath0 on @xmath35 .",
    "the aim of this paper is to study the set @xmath36 of points of @xmath35 which have finite orbit under the action of @xmath0 and the set @xmath37 of points which are periodic for each element of @xmath0 .",
    "it is clear that @xmath38 and the main result of this paper is to prove that @xmath39 and to completely determine @xmath40 .",
    "the result in the case @xmath8 follows from results of @xcite , where the authors use this result to study the global analytic properties of the solutions of a particular family of painlev vi equations . here",
    "we note that for any @xmath41 there is a pair @xmath42 ( given explicitly in @xmath43 ) , determined up to conjugacy , and which we say is _ associated to @xmath44_. the result of @xcite is :    [ th1 ] consider the action of @xmath5 on @xmath6 .",
    "let @xmath45 denote the points that have finite @xmath5-orbit and @xmath46 those that have finite orbit under each element of @xmath5 .",
    "then any point @xmath47 with associated matrices @xmath48 satisfies one of the following three conditions :    1 .",
    "[ itemi ] the group @xmath49 is a finite group ; 2 .",
    "[ itemii ] @xmath50 lies on one of the coordinate axes of @xmath10 ; 3 .",
    "[ itemiii ] the pair @xmath48 is conjugate to @xmath51 where @xmath52 are lower triangular and where the diagonal elements of @xmath53 and @xmath54 are roots of unity .",
    "this includes the case where some word in @xmath55 is parabolic ( so that the group @xmath55 is not finite )",
    ".    moreover @xmath56 .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath57 in each of the above three cases .    for ( [ itemi ] ) in the above theorem we recall the well known fact that any finite subgroup of @xmath4 is cyclic , binary dihedral or a subgroup of one of :    _ the binary tetrahedral group _ @xmath58    note that @xmath59 . _",
    "the binary octahedral group _ @xmath60 _ the binary icosahedral group _",
    "@xmath61 where @xmath62 is a primitive fifth root of unity .    from the classification of theorem [ th1 ]",
    "it follows that if @xmath63 and @xmath50 does not lie on an axis , then the associated group @xmath55 is finite , and @xmath50 is in one of @xmath64-orbits @xmath65 of sizes @xmath66 ( respectively ) .",
    "the fact that @xmath67 acts trivially on the triples of traces @xmath12 means that we are really considering an action of @xmath68",
    ".    we should note that in @xcite the authors consider the action of the braid group @xmath69 ( instead of @xmath64 ) on such triples .",
    "we further note however that this action of @xmath69 is determined by the elements @xmath70 ( defined in the next section ) .",
    "it is a fact that the subgroup @xmath71 has finite index ( @xmath72 ) in @xmath73 .",
    "thus the problem of determining points of @xmath10 with finite orbit for the action of @xmath64 is the same as the problem of finding points with finite orbit for the action of the subgroup @xmath74 .",
    "we also note that the authors of @xcite are only interested in the triples @xmath75 ( with finite orbit ) up to an equivalence where two such are equivalent if they differ by changing the sign of two of the entries .",
    "thus they obtain orbits of sizes @xmath76 ( respectively ) .",
    "we also note that in @xcite they are only concerned with points having finite orbits that are in the interior of @xmath77 .",
    "results given in @xmath78 , together with what is proved in @xcite , easily give theorem [ th1 ] .",
    "the last thing to note about @xcite is that they use the traces of the products @xmath79 , not the half - traces .    in the next few sections we introduce the preliminary results for the @xmath80 cases , finally being able to state our main result for the case @xmath81 at the end of section @xmath82 .",
    "this result is proved in @xmath83 .",
    "the result for general @xmath2 is proved in @xmath84 .",
    "* acknowledgements * we would like to thank anthony manning for his careful reading and comments on this material .",
    "all computations made in the preparation of this manuscript were accomplished using magma @xcite .",
    "let @xmath85 be a free group of rank @xmath82 and let @xmath86 be defined by @xmath87 one can show that @xmath88 satisfy the braid relation @xmath89 and that @xmath90 acts as an inner automorphism , so that the action of @xmath91 on the trace triples is trivial . under the natural homomorphism @xmath92 we have @xmath93    note (",
    "* th 3.9 ) that any element of @xmath64 fixes the commutator @xmath94 up to conjugacy and inversion .",
    "now suppose that the @xmath95 are represented by elements @xmath96 .",
    "define @xmath97 as in ( [ eq0.2 ] ) .",
    "recall the standard trace identities for such @xmath98 matrices : @xmath99 using these we obtain the induced action of @xmath100 on @xmath6 given by ( [ eq0.1 ] ) .",
    "we will write this action of @xmath101 on @xmath102 on the right : @xmath103 ; this action is also the corresponding action by nielsen transformations @xcite . in @xcite",
    "we studied the family of trace maps @xmath104 and determined all of their curves of fixed points and some of their period @xmath82 curves .",
    "one can check that for all @xmath105 we have @xmath106 .",
    "thus , from the above trace identities and the fact that any element of @xmath64 fixes the commutator @xmath94 up to conjugacy and inversion , it follows that the action of @xmath64 fixes the function @xmath107 of ( [ eq0.3 ] ) .",
    "thus each level set @xmath17 is invariant under the action .",
    "the level set @xmath19 is distinguished and has been drawn by many authors @xcite .",
    "there are four points , @xmath108 in @xmath19 which are the only singular points of @xmath19 .",

    "further , the six line segments joining these points are contained in @xmath19 and there is a unique component of @xmath109 whose closure is compact .",
    "in fact this closure is a topological @xmath82-sphere that separates @xmath110 into two components , the closure of one of these components is a @xmath111-ball @xmath77 that we call a  curvilinear tetrahedron \" , for whose boundary we gave a parametrisation in ( [ eq0.4 ] ) .",
    "one can check that @xmath112 ^ 3 $ ] and that @xmath113 ^ 3 $ ] is the above mentioned set of six line segments .",
    "further the closures of the other ( four ) components of @xmath109 are determined by the point of @xmath114 which they contain ; we will call these components",
    "_ cones_.",
    "let @xmath115 denote the @xmath82-torus .",
    "then we have the map @xmath116 note that @xmath117",
    ". then the map @xmath118 is a branched double cover , branched over the four points of @xmath119    the action of @xmath64 on @xmath120 actually comes from the action of @xmath22 on @xmath121 , the action being determined by the homomorphism @xmath122 . for @xmath123 and @xmath124 the maps @xmath125 are related",
    "as follows ( see ): @xmath126    the set @xmath45 includes the points @xmath114 . if we ignore the points of @xmath114 for the moment , then , as pointed out in @xcite , a consequence of the implicit function theorem",
    "is that , for any point @xmath127 and @xmath128 with @xmath129 hyperbolic , there is a curve of fixed points of @xmath130 through @xmath50 for some @xmath131 ; see also @xcite .",
    "to every point @xmath132 there is a pair @xmath133 such that trace@xmath134 trace@xmath135 and trace@xmath136",

    "it follows from the proof of theorem [ th1 ] in @xcite that there are only five finite @xmath64 orbits which do not lie in @xmath19 or on the axes .",
    "we denote them by @xmath65 and they contain ( respectively ) @xmath145 points .",
    "they lie on levels @xmath146 and each has associated group @xmath55 a finite group of order @xmath147 ( respectively ) , the group of order @xmath148 being @xmath149 .",
    "( see ( * ? ? ? * th 29.6 ) for the possible finite subgroups of @xmath150 . )",
    "thus there are four levels that contain the five sets @xmath151 .    in order to give the reader an idea of what the points of each @xmath152 look like we draw the following diagrams . for every point @xmath153 , we take the simple closed curves containing @xmath50 which are parallel to the various coordinate planes and which lie on the same level as @xmath50 ; there will be three such curves through every @xmath154 .",
    "we then radially project these curves onto the unit sphere and then stereographically project onto the @xmath155-plane .",
    "these curves are drawn in figures @xmath156 .",
    "the points of @xmath152 in the figures are exactly those points which are triple points for these curves .",
    "we further note that each such simple closed curve contains many of the points of @xmath152 , all such points in a single curve being in one or more orbits of a conjugate of @xmath157 .    from the above one easily deduces :    [ corvals ] the half - trace values for the points in the orbits @xmath158 are @xmath159    we now list further properties of the orbits @xmath160 .    *",

    "thus the kernel of the permutation action on all such points is a congruence subgroup .",
    "we may also discuss the @xmath64-action on the finite orbits @xmath194 in the following way .    if @xmath195 then the restriction of the map @xmath196 to the affine plane @xmath197 is topologically conjugate to a rotation through the angle @xmath198 , because the matrices @xmath199 are similar . therefore the ellipse @xmath200 , in which the plane @xmath197 meets @xmath201 is mapped to itself by @xmath157 with rotation number @xmath202 .",

    "but lemma [ l2.2 ] shows that @xmath436 has finite order , so that @xmath733 , a contradiction .    on the other hand , if @xmath734 , then lemma [ lemimpi2 ] tells us that @xmath12 has an element in its @xmath5-orbit that has a @xmath370 as one of its entries .",
    "it follows that @xmath50 has an element in its @xmath251-orbit that has a @xmath370 as one of its entries .",
    "thus by lemma [ l27.5 ] we see that either @xmath713 , for some @xmath714 or @xmath539 is finite .",
    "this does the case @xmath724 .    for the @xmath735 case we note that since @xmath736 , lemma [ lempd ] gives @xmath737 .",
    "the above shows that either we have what we want for theorem [ mainthm ] ( namely that @xmath738 , or @xmath50 is on an axis , or @xmath539 is finite , or @xmath739 ) , or @xmath740 , or @xmath741 is positive - definite .",
    "now we show how to deal with the fact that on the set @xmath694 the form @xmath686 is not positive definite .",
    "we recall the _ cholesky decomposition _ :",
    "the ( real ) matrix @xmath742 is positive definite if and only if there exists a ( real ) unique lower triangular matrix @xmath743 , with real and strictly positive diagonal elements , such that @xmath744 . for the matrix @xmath745",
    "we find that @xmath746 has the form @xmath747 where @xmath748    we note that each element whose square root is taken is non - negative , since we can assume that @xmath749 and @xmath750 .",
    "this again reduces the question of whether @xmath686 is positive definite to the question of whether @xmath751 is non - zero .",
    "now we see what happens if we replace @xmath610 by @xmath752 .",
    "suppose that @xmath753 then @xmath754 is given by ( 7.1 ) with @xmath755 replacing @xmath34 .",
    "of course @xmath756 .",
    "further , the positivite - definitenes of @xmath757 now depends on whether @xmath758 is non - zero or not .",
    "if it is non - zero , then @xmath759 is positive - definite , which is what we want .",
    "thus the ` bad ' case is if @xmath760 is zero for all @xmath761 .",
    "we thus look at the smallest ideal that contains @xmath751 and @xmath274 and is @xmath251-invariant .",
    "a magma computation shows that this ideal is @xmath245 .",
    "thus in this ( bad ) case @xmath762 , and we are done by lemma [ l2.133 ] .",
    "thus we have part ( a ) of :    [ propg3posdef2 ] assume that @xmath506 , where @xmath763 @xmath50 is not on a coordinate axis or in any of the @xmath764 , and @xmath765 .",
    "let @xmath707 be the reflections formed from @xmath766 .",
    "then    \\(a ) the matrix @xmath741 is positive - definite at @xmath50 ;    \\(b ) @xmath767 is a finite reflection group .",
    "_ proof _ part ( b ) follows from ( a ) as in the proof of the @xmath8 case outlined in @xmath768 .    now to complete the proof of our result for @xmath81 we need only consider the possibilities for @xmath707 and @xmath769 using coxeter s classification of finite groups generated by reflections @xcite .    first note that each @xmath670 is determined by a vector @xmath770 such that @xmath771 here @xmath772 is the form determined by @xmath686 .",
    "we further note that distinct reflections @xmath773 with vectors @xmath774 ( respectively ) commute if and only of @xmath775 .",
    "now from the theory of coxeter groups @xcite the decomposition of @xmath751 as a direct sum is determined by the components of the graph @xmath776 whose vertices are @xmath777 and where we have an edge @xmath774 whenever @xmath778 .",
    "thus any such finite reflection group @xmath751 decomposes as a direct product of irreducible reflection groups , one for each component of @xmath776 .",
    "coxeter s classification @xcite shows that there are five of these groups that are irreducible .",
    "if @xmath751 is a direct product of two irreducible finite reflection groups , then we have either    ( ai ) @xmath779 ; or ( aii ) @xmath780 .    here",
    "@xmath781 are irreducible finite reflection groups of degree @xmath671 , and they are generated by @xmath671 of the reflections @xmath707 . clearly , there is only one such group of degree @xmath370 .",
    "similarly , if @xmath751 is a direct product of three irreducible finite reflection groups , then we have    ( bi ) @xmath782 .",
    "lastly , if @xmath751 is a direct product of four irreducible finite reflection groups , then we have    \\(ci ) @xmath783 .",
    "if @xmath751 is irreducible , then @xmath751 has type @xmath784 of orders @xmath785 @xmath786 ( respectively ) . in these cases",
    "the order of @xmath787 is in @xmath788 , so that the values of @xmath789 are @xmath790 , where @xmath791 and @xmath792 ; see corollary [ corvals ] .",
    "there are eleven such cosine values , including @xmath536 .",
    "this reduces the checking of this ( irreducible ) case to a finite number of cases .",
    "we note that if one of @xmath789 is @xmath536 , then this situation is covered by lemma [ l27.5 ] .",
    "thus there are now nine possible values for @xmath789 ( the @xmath790 , where @xmath791 and @xmath793 , that are not @xmath536 ) .    checking ( using @xcite ) we find that the only situation where the @xmath251 orbit of @xmath794 is finite is when the orbit has size one of @xmath795 , with the corresponding group @xmath751 having order @xmath796 ( respectively ) .",
    "however one checks that each such orbit has a point in it that contains a @xmath370 , so that these cases are also covered by lemma [ l27.5 ] .",
    "( we note that the groups @xmath751 so found are not necessarily irreducible , but this does cover all such irreducible @xmath751 . )    now if we have a group @xmath751 of type ( ai ) , then the possibilities for @xmath797 are the coxeter groups of type @xmath798 of orders @xmath799 ( respectively ) .",
    "the possibilities for the values of @xmath789 are the same as in the irreducible case just considered , and so these cases are covered by the calculations for the irreducible case above .",
    "now , in considering cases ( aii ) and ( bi ) , the possibilities for @xmath800 are the coxeter groups of type @xmath801 i.e. the dihedral groups @xmath802 of order @xmath803 .",
    "thus if we have ( aii ) or ( bi ) with @xmath804 then @xmath805 , where @xmath806 is generated by the @xmath807 thus we have @xmath808 for @xmath809 .",
    "this shows that four of the @xmath810 are zero .",
    "for example , suppose that @xmath811 . then we see that @xmath812 which gives @xmath813 .",
    "this shows that @xmath814 similarly , if @xmath815 , then we get @xmath816 , which gives @xmath817 . if @xmath818 , then we get @xmath819 , giving @xmath820 .",
    "the rest of the cases are similar .",
    "this concludes consideration of ( aii ) and ( bi ) .    the last case , ( ci ) , is not allowed , since @xmath821 in this case .",
    "this concludes the proof of theorem [ mainthm ] .",
    "we note that in theorem [ mainthm ] , any @xmath334 of type ( i ) has its only non - zero entry equal to @xmath536 ( since @xmath278 ) , and so is in some @xmath822 ; it is thus covered by type ( ii ) .",
    "further , from the results of @xmath823 we see that any @xmath506 of type ( ii ) has @xmath539 a binary dihedral group , and so is covered by type ( iii ) .",
    "thus we now have    [ mainthm2 ] if @xmath334 , then @xmath824 , and we have one of the following :    \\(i ) @xmath337 ;    \\(ii ) the associated group @xmath338 is finite .",

    "the ideal @xmath827 determines a subset @xmath834 of @xmath35 that is thus invariant under the action of @xmath833 , and on which there is an action of @xmath833 .",

    ".      _ proof _ if the group @xmath539 is cyclic , then it is generated by one of @xmath845 @xmath846 .",
    "if it is generated by @xmath436 , then there is some @xmath432 such that @xmath847 , and we are done .",
    "the other cases are similar .",
    "if the group @xmath539 is binary dihedral with standard generators @xmath605 ( as in @xmath848 ) , then one of the @xmath849 has the form @xmath850 or @xmath851 ( for some @xmath852 ) . by an automorphism",
    "we can assume that @xmath436 has the form @xmath850 .",
    "by a further automorphism we may assume that @xmath853 are each powers of @xmath854 , so that @xmath569 is a cyclic group @xmath855 .",
    "thus this case now follows as in the cyclic group case just considered .",
    "other than the cyclic and binary dihedral groups , there are three finite groups to consider : for bt@xmath856 ( or a subgroup of bt@xmath856 ) we find that there are @xmath857 orbits of sizes @xmath858 . for bo@xmath859 ( or a subgroup of bo@xmath859 )",
    "we find that there are @xmath860 orbits of sizes @xmath861 .",
    "for bi@xmath862 ( or a subgroup of bi@xmath862 ) we find that there are @xmath331 orbits of sizes @xmath863 @xmath864 . in every case",
    "each orbit has an element that contains @xmath370 as an entry .",
    "* remark * we gave the sizes of the orbits for subgroups of @xmath865 in the proof of the last result .",
    "one finds that the permutation representations of @xmath224 that one obtains in each case have orders @xmath866 ( respectively ) .",
    "_ proof _ if @xmath555 is conjugate to a triple of upper - triangular matrices , then we may assume that @xmath874 since @xmath506 it follows that @xmath610 have finite order , or are @xmath544 , where @xmath545 is an upper - triangular parabolic ( see @xmath875 ) .",
    "thus the eigenvalues @xmath876 of @xmath849 are @xmath877 , roots of unity .",

    "we immediately see that @xmath884 for all such @xmath885",
