    "connections based on both information transmission and human relationships coexist in different types of electronic person - to - person communications , like in e - mail networks@xcite , instant message services @xcite , mobile phone calls @xcite , and mobile phone short messages @xcite . basically , there are two significant factors affecting spreading processes on social contact networks : topological structures @xcite and human dynamics @xcite .",
    "previous studies have uncovered how different topological structures ( such as degree distribution @xcite , assortativity @xcite , modularity @xcite ) affect spreading dynamics . at the same time , it has been proved that the non - poissonian pattern of human dynamics can slow down information propagation @xcite .",
    "although the above studies give us valuable insights into how information spreads on human communication networks , they do not provide a unified framework to combine the effects of topological structures and human dynamics on information diffusion . to uncover the complicated interplay between network structures and human dynamics , recently the concept of temporal networks has been proposed @xcite and related statistics have been utilized to analyze human communication networks @xcite .",
    "for example , miritello and collaborators show that group conversations are significant to understand the dynamic coupling of individuals and the mechanism of information spreading @xcite .",
    "furthermore , some basic statistics for local group conversations , such as temporal motif @xcite and weighted reciprocity @xcite , have been utilized to measure how individuals interact with their direct neighbors . however , up to now , what the accurate interaction pattern among individuals in electronic person - to - person communications is and how the interaction pattern affects spreading behaviors has not been satisfactorily uncovered .    in recent years , the mobile short message service has emerged as one of the most popular tools for personal communication in china because of the relatively low telecommunication tariff @xcite .",
    "basically , people can send and receive short messages anytime , anywhere , and to and from any mobile phone in their daily life .",
    "in contrast , e - mails and instant message services ( e.g. , msn ) are not as popular as short messages in china for they need people to have a personal computer or a mobile smart phone .",
    "furthermore , handling a short message is easier than writing an e - mail , and is more flexible than dialing a phone call .",
    "the flexibility of short messages means that you can send or respond a short message promptly , or put some particular short messages to a waiting list as a lower priority task @xcite .",
    "these features thus provide a very attractive proxy for studying the dynamic behaviors of single individuals and the nontrivial interaction pattern of human communication activities .    in this study",
    ", we build a weighted communication network based on a short message dataset of a telecommunication provider in china . by analyzing the network topology and interaction strength",
    ", we find that most users have only one major active communication partner .",
    "furthermore , the results of multiple statistics indicate that the weighted communication network has specific structural features compared with its randomized counterpart : densely mutual ( reciprocal ) links , highly weighted reciprocal coefficients @xcite , and fragmented pairwise rich nodes . all these topology properties can prove the existence of the pairwise interaction pattern in the weighted network , which has not been reported in previous studies .",
    "the pairwise pattern shows that most information in the short message service is local , especially tends to happen between a pair of users .",
    "therefore , the pairwise interaction is the basic pattern of group conversations in the self - organizing artificial communication system ( e.g. , mobile phone short message service ) .",
    "this finding is significant for our understanding of local and global information spreading in electronic person - to - person communications .",
    "we also find the pairwise conversation can strongly affect human dynamics in the short message service .",
    "moreover , our study provides an integrated framework for analyzing the collective communication behaviors in the self - organizing communication system based on weighted network theory .",
    "therefore , communication operators can use our findings to design novel service plans , provide new tariff strategies , and optimize the communication services .",
    "the short message dataset investigated in this work was obtained from a mobile phone operator in china .",
    "the original data includes all the charging accountant bills over one month period for three corporate users who use the same mobile phone operator service . in this study , we only calculate the result for the company that has the most number of users . in this dataset , the total number of the short message communication records is @xmath0 , and the number of the users is @xmath1 .",
    "each record comprises a sender mobile phone number , a recipient mobile phone number and a time stamp with a precision of @xmath2 s. all the phone numbers were hashed and no other information is available for identifying or locating users .",
    "more detailed information about this dataset can be found in @xcite .    , and the number of the users is @xmath1.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    to show the interaction pattern among the communication network neighbors , we build a weighted complex network representing the communication relationships among the members of the company . to eliminate spurious relationships",
    ", we only retain the links with bidirectional short message communication within the largest connected component ( as has been done for mobile phone call data in @xcite ) , thus the out - degree always equals the in - degree .",
    "the link weights are the number of short message events .",
    "we list the number of friends ( degree ) distribution and the number of short messages ( weight ) distribution in fig .",
    "[ degree_distribution ] .",
    "the degree and weight distributions are both like a power - law distribution @xcite , which suggests that a very large percentage of users have small values of degree / weight , and few users possess very high degrees / weights . however , the values of natural cutoff for the degree and weight are very different : @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "the result of @xmath5 indicates that the weight distribution is more heterogeneous than the degree distribution .",
    "we extend the vertex degree @xmath6 to be a new definition of the vertex out - strength as @xmath7 @xcite . to shed more light on the relationship between the vertices strength and degree",
    ", we investigate the dependence of the average strength @xmath8 with the degree @xmath9 increasing . if there is no correlation between the weight and the degree , we can obtain @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the average out - weight in the network @xcite .",
    "we show the results of @xmath8 for both the real weighted network and its randomized version in fig .",

    "the two curves are very similar and both closely fitting the relationship : @xmath12 .",

    "we maintain the topology of the original network and shuffle the weights globally to get the randomized network @xcite.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    another method of measuring the correlation between the degree and weight is to calculate the dependence of the weight @xmath14 on the degrees of the end - point node degrees @xmath6 and @xmath15 @xcite . as we can see in fig .",
    "[ weight_kikj ] , the average weight @xmath16 is almost constant for about three decades of @xmath17 , confirming a general lack of correlations between the weight and the end - point node degrees .",

    "for a given node @xmath18 with degree @xmath6 and out - strength @xmath13 , the disparity in the weights can be evaluated by the quantity @xmath19 ^ 2 $ ] , where @xmath20 is the set of first neighbors of @xmath18 @xcite . by this definition",
    ", @xmath21 has an implicit dependence on the value of @xmath6 .",
    "if all edges have comparable weights , @xmath22 ( that is , the disparity averaged over all nodes with the degree @xmath9 ) will be scaled as @xmath23 . in other words , the value of the weight @xmath14 is of the same order @xmath24 .",
    "in contrast , if only one or a few weights dominate over all the others , @xmath22 is independent of @xmath9 and @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "the result of @xmath22 for the short message communication network has been shown in fig .",
    "[ yk_degree ] .",
    "it is clear that the curve of @xmath22 is far larger than @xmath23 , which suggests that the users show a strong heterogeneous communication pattern .",
    "this observation proves that most users mainly have heavy communication with just one of their friends @xcite .     as a function of @xmath9",

    "the value of @xmath22 is the disparity averaged over all nodes with the degree @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "because the curve of @xmath22 is far larger than @xmath23 , the intensity of the users communication is highly heterogeneous among their network neighbors.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]      in the previous study , it has been found that about @xmath27 of the users send more than @xmath28 of their messages to just one friend @xcite .",
    "we define the statistic @xmath29 to measure the intensity of communication between users @xmath18 and @xmath30 .",
    "the value of @xmath31 is the ratio of the number of message @xmath32 that @xmath18 sends to @xmath30 to the total messages @xmath20 sent by @xmath18 . for user @xmath18 , it is very easy to find the maximal value @xmath33 from his short message records .",
    "the value of @xmath33 close to @xmath26 indicates that the user mainly communicates with one particular partner . for many individuals who only send one or two short messages , the values of @xmath33",
    "are obviously very high ( @xmath26 or @xmath34 ) .",
    "therefore , we only list the values for active users who send more than five short messages in fig .",
    "[ rsmax ] .",
    "the result of @xmath33 is stable for all the active users ( meaning about @xmath35 messages are sent to the most closest person ) , which clearly reveals that most of the users indeed have only one major active communication partner .     for active users .",
    "the active users are the persons who send more than five short messages .",
    "we see that about @xmath35 of short messages from each user are sent to one particular associate , which clearly reveals that most of the users indeed have only one major active communication partner.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]      our data analysis also shows that mutual ( reciprocal ) links are dense in the communication network . a traditional way of quantifying the reciprocity is to compute the ratio of the number of links pointing in both directions @xmath36 to the total number of links @xmath37 : @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath39 for a real network lies in the range of @xmath40 $ ] .",
    "however , this definition is not very useful for the weighted network built by the short message communication events , for we have removed all unidirectional edges and the reciprocity according to the above definition would be @xmath26 .     as a function of edge weights for all the users .",
    "the weighted reciprocal coefficient is defined as @xmath41 , where @xmath14 is the total number of short messages that user @xmath18 sends to @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "all the values of @xmath42 are below @xmath43 and decrease with @xmath44 increasing , which indicates that the information flow has a symmetric ( reciprocal ) trend in the short message commutation network . the blue dash line is just drawn to guide our eyes.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    for a weighted network , we aim to determine not only whether the communication between a pair of users is one directional or mutual @xcite , but also the bias of the information flow strength of the two different directions @xcite .",
    "here we use the definition in @xcite : @xmath41 .",
    "the weight @xmath14 is the total number of short messages that user @xmath18 sends to @xmath30 during the whole month period .",
    "note that @xmath42=@xmath45 , and the distributions of @xmath42 for all edges in the network are in the range of @xmath46 $ ] .",
    "the weight of each edge allows us to study the reciprocity of the edge instead of the full network .",
    "the value of @xmath34 means that the edge is symmetric ( reciprocal ) , and in contrast the value of @xmath26 means that the information flow is completely unidirectional .    the dependence of @xmath42 on the value of @xmath44 is shown in fig .",
    "[ reciprocity ] .",
    "this result is an obvious evidence that there is a reciprocal trend for short message communications , for all the values of @xmath42 are below @xmath43 .",
    "in addition , the more reciprocity property for the higher @xmath44 also implies that a more symmetric pairwise relationship might trigger more communication events , and vice versa .",
    "the rich - club phenomenon is another significant topology property @xcite and it can dominate other statistics of complex networks @xcite . in many real - life weighted networks , the rich - club effects based on degree and strength are not trivially related @xcite . the topology structure of the @xmath47 highest weight edges in the short message communication network is shown in fig .",

    "( a ) the air transportation network is obtained by considering the @xmath48 united states airports with the largest amount of traffic from publicly available data @xcite .",
    "nodes represent airports and edges represent air travel connections among them .",
    "the weights are given by the number of seats available on the scheduled flights .",
    "( b ) the short message communication network is obtained by considering the short message sending / receiving relationships among the members of a company in china @xcite .",
    "nodes represent individuals and edges represent short message communication among them .",
    "the weights are given by the number of short messages.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    although we do not calculate the rich - club coefficient using quantitative methods @xcite , the very fragmented local subsets again prove the pairwise interaction pattern in the short message communication network .",
    "our simply qualitative method not only measures the relationship among the edges with the highest weights but also roughly represents the connection of the nodes with the strongest strengths . because all users send most of their short messages to one major active communication partner [ fig .",
    "[ rsmax ] ] , the nodes with the strong strengths in the short message communication network have a similar connection relationship like fig . [ multipolarization](b ) .",
    "we have known the accurate interaction pattern among individuals , and the next step is to explore how the interaction pattern affects spreading behaviors in electronic person - to - person communications .      to show how the pairwise interaction pattern affects spreading behaviors",
    ", we use the susceptible - infected ( si ) model to simulate information spreading dynamics @xcite . for the weighted short message network",
    ", each infected individual @xmath18 can pass the information to his direct neighbor @xmath30 with the probability @xmath49 at each time step , where the parameter @xmath50 controls the overall spreading rate @xcite .",
    "we also compare the above result with that obtained in an unweighted version ( all the tie weights are considered equal ) of the short message communication network using the same average spreading rate .",
    "recently , it has been found that information transferring is significantly slower in the weighted network than in its unweighted version @xcite .     in the short message communication network .",
    "here we use the susceptible - infected ( si ) model to simulate information spreading dynamics .",
    "the result is the average from selecting the node whose out - strength is larger than @xmath47 as the start node . in the weighted version , it is assumed that the probability for a node @xmath18 to pass on the information to its neighbor @xmath30 in one time step is given by @xmath49 , and @xmath51 @xcite .",
    "we also compare the above result with that obtained in an unweighted version ( all the tie weights are considered equal ) of the short message communication network using the same average spreading rate.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    we now study a special spreading process in which a rich strength node has the initializing information , since a node with a higher strength has a higher probability to transfer information to others . on the large scale , information is transferred faster in the unweighted network than the weighted version , which is essentially coincident with the result in @xcite , because the rich isolated multipolarization phenomenon means that there are many bottlenecks for global information spreading in the weighted network [ fig .",
    "[ multipolarization ] ] . on the contrary",
    ", the weighted version has a faster spreading speed than the unweighted version on the small scale [ fig . [ spreading ] ] .",
    "this finding implies that for real information spreading , previous works may underestimate the spreading speed of local information .",
    "however , the pairwise interaction leads to the result that most messages are only sent to the most closest person , so it is difficult for a pair of intimate individuals to transmit their common local information to a large range ( to be a global information ) . in summary ,",
    "the pairwise pattern promotes local information spreading among a pair of friends and in contrast also suppresses global information spreading .",
    "we also confirm a strong correlation between the pairwise conversation and human dynamics .",
    "there are two important time periods with which to describe human dynamics : the waiting time and the interevent time .",
    "the waiting time @xmath52 is the interval between receiving and then sending a short message for user @xmath18 , and the interevent time @xmath53 is the time interval between sending two consecutive messages .",
    "the effect of bursts on hindering information propagation has been well studied @xcite , yet there are few works to study the effect of the conversation mechanism within human crowds @xcite . for the mobile phone call data , recently miritello _ et al . _",
    "found that group conversations enhanced local information spreading , because the interaction among individuals can trigger more information spreading behaviors @xcite .",
    "is the interval between user @xmath18 receiving a message and then sending a short message to another user .",
    "the interevent time @xmath53 is the time interval between sending two consecutive messages for user @xmath18 . here",
    "@xmath54 represents the average of the interevent time @xmath53 of the active user @xmath18 .",
    "the active users are the persons who send more than five short messages . for the case of `` principal input shuffled '' , we only shuffle the receiving time of short messages from the one major active communication partner . for the case of `` all input shuffled '' , we shuffle the receiving time of short messages from all the users .",
    ", scaledwidth=50.0% ]    in this study , we verify again that @xmath52 depends on the group conversations in fig .",
    "[ tauij ] . using the similar framework in @xcite , we compare the results of @xmath52 for only shuffling the receiving time of short messages from the one major active communication partner and shuffling all the receiving time .",
    "both most short messages being sent to one particular person [ fig .",
    "[ rsmax ] ] and the weighted reciprocal coefficients being high [ fig .",
    "[ reciprocity ] ] indicate that there are no frequent cascading information spreading in the short message dataset .",
    "therefore , the event that user @xmath18 receives the information from user @xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) is not a trigger for @xmath18 to communicate with other people like user @xmath57 ( @xmath58 and @xmath59 ) .",
    "however , we find that the pairwise interaction is the basic pattern of group conversations ( @xmath60 , and then @xmath61 ) .",
    "the pairwise interaction is the most significant impact on human dynamics , for it can greatly reduce the waiting time between a pair of close friends [ fig .",
    "[ tauij ] ] .",
    "in summary , we have found a strong pairwise interaction pattern in the weighted communication network by analyzing the network topology and interaction strengths .",
    "the pairwise interaction , which has not been reported in other communication datasets by unweighted network analysis , is the basic conversation pattern among individuals and it has a significant impact on human dynamics of communication behaviors : reducing the waiting time in electronic person - to - person communications .",
    "our finding suggests that the short message service promotes local information spreading and slows down global information cascading spreading .",
    "basically , anyone can transfer information to anyone , for human society has a famous small - world property @xcite .",
    "however , interaction strengths play distinct roles for information spreading @xcite .",
    "it is believed that weak ties have a strong impact for long - range information spreading and strong ties are significant for local information spreading @xcite . in the short message dataset ,",
    "most information is local ( especially tends to happen between a pair of users ) , and the global cascading spreading is not frequent .",
    "our results are coincident with the fact that the short message communication system is not designed for spreading global information such as rumor and news , but is self - organizing to support us to spread or exchange local information in daily life .    the collective communication behaviors of all the customers in a company belonging to the same mobile phone operator have been analyzed based on the weighted network theory .",
    "our work is helpful for mobile phone operators to design new service plans and tariff strategies .",
    "for example , it is valuable for a mobile phone operator to provide a special tariff for a pair of users with frequent communication relationships .",
    "furthermore , because the number of the user s friends obeys a power - law distribution @xcite , it is a remarkable fact that most users have only one major active communication partner ( @xmath35 messages are sent to the same person ) .",
    "therefore , our findings also can be used to optimize communication services .    for a self - organizing complex system ( e.g. , the short message communication system in this study )",
    ", it is well known that `` the whole is greater than the sum of its parts '' @xcite , so dividing a large - scale complex system into multiple sub - systems ( or individuals ) is not helpful for the comprehensive understanding on the whole complex system @xcite .",
    "the pairwise interaction pattern suggests that human dynamics not only depend on individuals rhythm @xcite , but also are strongly affected by the complicated interplay among intimate friends .",
    "nevertheless , our work is a step in an ongoing effort to bridge the gap between individual microscopic interactions and macroscopic social systems .",
