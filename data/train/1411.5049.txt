    "care must be taken in the parametrization of the bath sites in order to give this cluster enough degrees of freedom to represent the magnetic order we want to probe .",

    "using the same notation , the green function on the infinite lattice , @xmath69 , is specified by a frequency @xmath62 and a wavevector @xmath70 belonging to the brillouin zone of the superlattice ( the _ reduced _ brillouin zone ) : the basic cdmft approximation is to replace the full lattice self - energy by the computed , @xmath70-independent , cluster self - energy @xmath71 . the lattice green function is then approximated by @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the noninteracting green function , but expressed in a mixed matrix / reduced wavevector form.@xcite in this form , @xmath74 is composed of two different parts : @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the hopping amplitude matrix within the cluster ( it does not depend on @xmath70 ) and @xmath77 contains the hopping amplitudes between clusters .    the bath parameters are determined by a self - consistency condition stating that the cluster green function @xmath78 can also be obtained from the lattice green function by a fourier transform : @xmath79 ( @xmath33 is the total number of sites in the system and @xmath80 the number of sites on a cluster )",
    ". that condition can not be satisfied exactly with the exact diagonalization technique , because the small number of bath orbitals does not provide enough parameters for the condition to be satisfied at all frequencies .",

    "we use a small `` fictitious '' temperature @xmath84 for this sum , even though the cluster green function is computed numerically at zero temperature .",

    "while the environment of the impurity is antiferromagnetically correlated , one clearly sees from fig .",
    "[ fig : afm_u2 ] that when the local potential @xmath4 is finite , in other words when the impurity site not completely empty , the impurity site itself is ferromagnetically correlated with its neighbors .",
    "this agrees with the dmft results of ref .   that we set out to verify , but only for the nearest - neighbors .",
    "in that paper,@xcite they considered a cluster containing the impurity site and only one of its nearest neighbor that they attached to an environment whose baths were those of the infinite system .",
    "the ldos on the impurity ( present on sublattice @xmath17 ) contains the bound state responsible for the enhanced spin polarization of sublattice @xmath18 . since the impurity site is the only site on sublattice @xmath17 where this bound state is strong enough to dominate the spin polarization , it is the only site of sublattice @xmath17 that has the same spin polarization as sublattice @xmath18 .",
    "the residual resonance on the impurity site is then responsible for the ferromagnetic correlation of the impurity and its nearest neighbors . for every other site , sublattices a and b have opposite spin polarizations",
    "this is not captured by the approach of ref .",
    "that does not allow the bath on clusters beyond nearest neighbors to adjust to the presence of the impurity cluster .",
    "our choice of cluster within the supercluster was motivated by the desire to have the impurity connect to all its nearest neighbors directly on the cluster and not only through the self - consistency relation .",
    "the need for the supercluster itself is clear when one notices that it is necessary to leave to the @xmath156 spin polarization on the impurity - containing cluster the freedom to be different from the @xmath156 spin polarization on other clusters .",
    "it is important to impose periodic boundary conditions on the supercluster even if this means periodically repeating the impurity .",
    "some tests have been done on superclusters of similar sizes or larger with open boundary conditions .",
    "it was found that edge magnetism@xcite dominates over impurity magnetism . in the periodic scheme ,",
    "a smaller supercluster implies a higher concentration of impurities . a 42-site supercluster made from the 7 clusters at the center of fig .  [",
    "fig : supercluster ] was also tested and the resulting magnetic pattern was similar , albeit with stronger antiferromagnetism far from impurity .",
    "a supercluster of @xmath157 sites may seem excessive and time consuming at first , but the need to include more than one cluster is highlighted by our results .",
    "the size of the hilbert space is exponential ( @xmath158 for one cluster ) but the time spent on the exact diagonalization is linear in the number of clusters and is easily parallelized . with the geometry considered in fig .",
    "[ fig : supercluster ] , the computational bottleneck lies in the matrix inversions needed for each term in the wavevector sums implied in eqs   and .",
    "the cost of this inversion is polynomial with complexity @xmath159 but the calculation can also be parallelized between different wavevectors .    while one of the main results of this work is that mean field arguments qualitatively capture the correct magnetic correlations induced by non - magnetic impurities in graphene , a second important result is the relation between the on - site interaction @xmath1 and the threshold values @xmath138 and @xmath140 .",
    "this relation could be used to design an experiment to measure how @xmath1 changes in graphene when screening is modified by different substrates .",
    "indeed , both values @xmath138 and @xmath140 define a very sharp transition region between the paramagnetic phase and the vacancy - type afm phase where @xmath141 .",
    "since this relation is monotonic , determining either @xmath138 or @xmath140 is sufficient to obtain an estimate of @xmath1 .",
    "since the critical value @xmath91 is renormalized by long - wavelength fluctuations , our values of @xmath1 are too small , but we expect that the dependence of @xmath1 on impurity potential should still be monotonic and linear , as in the inset of fig .  [ fig : afm_nc ] .    in summary , we developed the i - cdmft technique and applied it to the problem of a nonmagnetic impurity in graphene .",
    "this method takes into account electron - electron interactions ( dynamical correlations ) exactly within small clusters .",
    "our results are consistent with the @xmath2-matrix treatment and previous mean - field calculations .",
    "they have all the key signatures : ( 1 ) the net spin @xmath0 at strong impurity potential imposed by lieb s theorem , ( 2 ) bound states in the ldos and ( 3 ) the correct antiferromagnetic pattern around the impurity .",
    "our work could be straightforwardly extended to study the effect of doping and its influence on kondo - like screening .",
    "this study not only supports previous results on this problem but also benchmarks our new i - cdmft technique for studying impurity problems while correctly taking into account short - range dynamical correlations . in the future",
    ", i - cdmft could be used to study the effect of impurities in systems where these dynamical correlations produce more important effects , such as high - temperature superconductors , mott insulators or spin - liquids .",
    "we are indebted to e. j. g. santos for suggesting this problem , to h. alloul , h. bouchiat , s. verret and a. reymbaut for useful discussions , and to s. allen for technical help .",
