    "firstly , by the results in this section , we see that a nonhomogeneous wavelet system @xmath39 in @xmath2 for a given integer @xmath34 ( that is , at the coarsest scale level @xmath34 ) naturally leads to a sequence of nonhomogeneous wavelet systems @xmath242 for all integers @xmath92 while preserving almost all the properties of the system at @xmath243 .",
    "this is a fundamental property in wavelet analysis .",
    "in fact , a one - level fast wavelet transform is just a transform between the two sets of wavelet coefficients of a given function represented under two nonhomogeneous wavelet systems at two consecutive scale levels .",
    "naturally , for a multi - level wavelet transform , there is an underlying sequence of wavelet systems at every scale level , instead of just one single wavelet system . for a given nonhomogeneous ( stationary ) wavelet system ,",
    "since it naturally produces a sequence of nonhomogeneous wavelet systems , this allows us to study only one nonhomogeneous wavelet system instead of a sequence of nonhomogeneous wavelet systems .",
    "this desirable property of nonhomogeneous wavelet systems is not shared by homogeneous wavelet systems .",
    "secondly , by the results in this section , for any @xmath0 real - valued expansive matrix @xmath1 , we see that a nonhomogeneous wavelet system @xmath39 in @xmath2 for a given integer @xmath34 naturally leads to a homogeneous wavelet system @xmath50 .",
    "therefore , a homogeneous wavelet system @xmath50 can be regarded as the limit of a sequence of nonhomogeneous wavelet systems @xmath244 as @xmath74 . due to theorem  [ thm : bw ]",
    ", we see that a nonhomogeneous orthonormal wavelet basis has natural connections to refinable structures .",
    "this motivates us to introduce the notion of a homogeneous wavelet system with the quasi - refinable structure . for a given homogeneous wavelet system @xmath50 being a frame or a riesz basis in @xmath2",
    ", we say that the homogeneous wavelet system @xmath50 has the quasi - refinable structure , if there exists a subset @xmath32 of @xmath2 such that the nonhomogeneous wavelet system @xmath177 is a frame or a riesz basis in @xmath2 so that the homogeneous wavelet system @xmath50 is its limit system .",
    "lastly , we mention that results in this section for nonhomogeneous wavelet systems in @xmath2 can be generalized to more general function spaces such as sobolev spaces and besov spaces . for the case of sobolev spaces ,",
