    "there is a general consensus that galactic cosmic rays ( hereafter crs ) up to the `` knee '' ( @xmath334@xmath410@xmath5 ev ) originate in supernova remnants ( snrs ) accelerated by the first order fermi mechanism in shock waves .",
    "the theoretical modelling of this mechanism can reproduce the measured spectra and composition of crs .",
    "recent measurements carried out by the balloon - borne cream experiment @xcite show that the proton and helium spectra from 2.5 to 250 tev are both flatter compared to the lower energy measurements .",
    "in particular , the proton spectrum in this energy range is found harder than the value obtained by fitting many previous direct measurements @xcite .",
    "the evolution of the proton and helium spectra and their subtle differences can be an indication of the contribution of different populations of cr sources operating in environments with different chemical compositions @xcite .    in the knee region the measurements of the cr primary spectrum",
    "are carried out only by eas arrays and the current experimental results are conflicting . in the standard picture",
    "the `` mass of the knee '' is light being due to the steepening of the p and he spectra @xcite . however , different experiments attribute the `` mass of the knee '' to higher nuclei .",
    "a hybrid measurement carried out exploiting the cherenkov light yield detected by the eas - top experiment ( located at 2000 m a.s.l . ) at different core distances in eas and the high energy underground muons sampled by the macro experiment , has been used to infer the helium flux at 80 tev , resulting twice larger than that obtained by jacee @xcite .",
    "the eas - top / macro analysis implies a decreasing proton contribution to the primary flux well below the observed knee in the primary spectrum .",
    "such considerations can be described through the ratios of the three components at 250 tev , that can be expressed as : @xmath6 : @xmath7 : @xmath8 = ( 0.20@xmath90.08 ) : ( 0.58@xmath90.19 ) : ( 0.22@xmath90.17 ) @xcite .",
    "in addition , also the results of the tibet as@xmath10 and the basje experiments , located at 4300 m a.s.l and at 5200 m a.s.l . respectively , favour a heavier composition because the proton component is no more dominant at the knee @xcite .",
    "indications for a substantial fraction of nuclei heavier than helium at 10@xmath5 ev have been obtained in old measurements of delayed hadrons @xcite , as well as by the casa - mia collaboration @xcite .",
    "the knowledge of the primary proton spectrum is fundamental to understand the cosmic rays acceleration mechanisms and the propagation processes in the galaxy . a careful measurement of the proton spectrum in the energy region from tev to 10 pev is the key component for understanding the origin of the knee .",
    "in addition , precise knowledge of its flux may allow one to calculate the yield of rare secondary crs as antiprotons and positrons and establish the expected fluxes of the atmospheric neutrinos .",
    "a measurement of the cr primary energy spectrum ( all - particle and light component ) in the energy range few tev  10 pev is under way with the argo - ybj experiment ( for a description of the detector and a report of the latest physics results see @xcite ) . to cover this wide energy range different eyes",
    "have been used :    * _ digital readout _ , based on the strip multiplicity , in the few tev  200 tev energy range @xcite ; * _ analog readout _ , based on the particle density in the shower core region , in the 100 tev  10 pev range ; * _",
    "hybrid measurement _ , carried out by argo - ybj and a wide field of view cherenkov telescope , in the 100 tev - pev region @xcite .",
    "the results concerning the all - particle and the light component ( p+he ) spectra obtained with the analog readout are summarized in the following .",
    "the results obtained with the hybrid measurement are described in @xcite .",
    "a measurement of the primary cr light ( p+he ) component energy spectrum has been carried out in the energy range 5  200 tev exploiting the _ digital read - out _ of the argo - ybj experiment , i.e. the picture of the eas provided by the strip / pad system . with this analysis for the first time a ground - based measurement of",
    "the cr spectrum overlaps data obtained with direct methods for more than one energy decade , thus providing a solid anchorage to calibrate the energy scale of eas arrays approaching the knee region .",
    "the argo - ybj spectrum , reconstructed with an unfolding technique based on the bayesian approach , agrees remarkably well with the values obtained by adding up the p and he fluxes measured by cream both concerning the total intensities and the spectral index .",
    "the value of the spectral index of the power - law fit to the argo - ybj data is -2.61@xmath90.04 , which should be compared with @xmath11 = -2.66@xmath90.02 and @xmath12 = -2.58@xmath90.02 obtained by cream @xcite .",
    "the present analysis does not allow the determination of the individual p and he contribution to the measured flux , but the argo - ybj data clearly exclude the runjob results @xcite .",
    "details can be found in @xcite .",
    "this measurement has been extended to higher energies exploiting an _ hybrid measurement _ with a prototype of the future wide field of view cherenkov telescope array ( wfcta ) of the lhaaso project @xcite .",
    "the idea is to combine in a multiparametric analysis two mass - sensitive parameters : the particle density in the shower core measured by the analog readout of argo - ybj and the shape of the cherenkov footprint measured by wfcta @xcite . for a detailed description of the technique see @xcite .",
    "the light component energy spectra measured by argo - ybj up to about 600 tev with the digital and the hybrid systems are shown in the fig .",
    "[ fig : light_spectrum ] . the hybrid spectrum can be described by a single power - law with a spectral index of -2.63 @xmath9 0.06 up to about 600 tev .",
    "a systematic uncertainty in the absolute flux of 15% is shown by the shaded area .",
    "the error bars show the statistical errors only .",
    "the absolute flux at 400 tev is ( 1.79@xmath90.16)@xmath1310@xmath14 gev@xmath15 m@xmath16 sr@xmath15 s@xmath15 .",
    "this result is consistent for what concern spectral index and absolute flux with the measurements carried out by argo - ybj below 200 tev and by cream .",
    "the flux difference is about 10% and can be explained with a difference in the experiments energy scale of @xmath93.5% @xcite .",
    "this result is very important to fix the energy scale of the experiment . below 10 tev",
    "the absolute energy scale of argo - ybj is calibrated at 10% level exploting the westward displacement of the moon shadow under the effect of the gmf @xcite . above this energy",
    "the overposition with cream allows to compare both energy scales : the agreement is at a few percent level .",
    "the measurement of the cr energy spectrum up to 10 pev is under way exploiting the rpc charge readout of the argo - ybj detector which allows to study the structure of the particle density distribution in the shower core region up to particle densities of about 10@xmath17/m@xmath18 @xcite .",
    "the study of the lateral density function ( ldf ) at ground is expected to provide information on the longitudinal profile of the showers in the atmosphere , that is to estimate their development stage , or _ age _ , which is related to @xmath19 , the atmospheric depth at which the cascade reaches its maximum size .",
    "this implies the possibility of selecting showers within given intervals of @xmath19 or , equivalently , of @xmath20 , the distance of the shower maximum from the detector .",
    "the shower development stage in the atmosphere , as observed at a fixed altitude ( the detection one ) , depends on the energy of the interacting primary . for fixed energy ,",
    "it depends on the nature of the primary : heavy primaries interact higher in the atmosphere , thus giving showers which , on average , reach their maximum at a larger distance from the detector than a lighter primary of the same energy .",
    "for this reason , the combined use of the shower energy and age estimations can ensure a sensitivity to the primary mass , thus giving the possibility of selecting a light ( p+he ) event sample with high efficiency .",
    "resulting from the fits of the average ldf of simulated p , he and fe samples ( in each n@xmath21 bin ) vs the corresponding @xmath19 average values . ]     resulting from the fits of the average ldf of simulated p , he and fe samples ( in each n@xmath21 bin ) vs the corresponding @xmath19 average values . ]    various observables were considered and analyzed in order to find a suitable estimator of the primary cr energy . among them , according to mc simulations , n@xmath21 , the number of particles detected within a distance of 8 m from the shower axis , resulted well correlated with energy , not biased by the finite detector size and not much affected by shower to shower fluctuations @xcite .",
    "therefore , the analysis is carried out in terms of different n@xmath21 intervals to select event samples corresponding to different primary energies . nevertheless , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : np8 ] , this truncated size is a mass - dependent energy estimator parameter .    in order to have a mass - independent parameter we fitted the ldfs of triggered showers ( up to about 10 m from the core ) event - by - event , for different n@xmath21 intervals and different shower initiating primaries , with a suitable function to get the shape parameter @xmath22 ( see @xcite for details ) . from these studies we find",
    "that , for a given primary , the @xmath22 value decreases when n@xmath21 ( i.e. the energy ) increases , this being due to the observation of younger ( deeper ) showers at larger energies .",
    "moreover , for a given range of n@xmath21 , @xmath22 increases going from proton to iron , as a consequence of a larger primary interaction cross section .",
    "both dependencies are in agreement with the expectations , the slope @xmath22 being correlated with the shower age , thus reflecting its development stage .",
    "this outcome has two important implications , since the measurements of @xmath22 and n@xmath21 can both ( i ) help constraining the shower age and ( ii ) give information on the primary particle nature .",
    "concerning the first point , we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : s_xmax_phefe ] the @xmath22 values as obtained from the fit of the average ldfs , for each simulated primary type and n@xmath21 interval , as a function of the corresponding @xmath19 average value .",
    "as can be seen , the shape parameter @xmath22 depends only on the development stage of the shower , independently from the nature of the primary particle and energy .",
    "that plot expresses an important universality of the ldf of detected eas particles in terms of the lateral shower age .",
    "the ldf slope @xmath22 is a @xmath19 average value estimator mass - independent .",
    "this implies the possibility to select most deeply penetrating showers ( and quasi - constant @xmath20 intervals ) at different zenith angles , an important point for correlating the exponential angular rate distribution with the interaction length of the initiating particle @xcite .",
    "obviously shower - to - shower fluctuations introduce unavoidable systematics , whose effects can be anyway quantified and taken into account .",
    "the second implication is that @xmath22 from the ldf fit very close to the shower axis , together with the measurement of the truncated size n@xmath21 , can give information on the primary particle nature , thus making possible the study of primary mass composition and the selection of a light component data sample .",
    "assuming an exponential absorption after the shower maximum , we get the size at maximum ( n@xmath23 ) by using n@xmath21 and @xmath22 measurements for each event : @xmath24 $ ] .",
    "a suitable choice of the absorption lenght @xmath25 ( = 120 g/@xmath0 ) allows to get n@xmath23 a parameter correlated with primary energy in an almost linear and mass independent way , providing an energy estimator with a log(e / tev ) resolution of 0.100.15 ( getting better with energy ) .",
