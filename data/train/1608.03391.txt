    "the information loss problem @xcite is the interesting unresolved problem that is related to general relativity , quantum field theory , and the quantum theory of gravity .",
    "if there is a consistent theory of quantum gravity , then the information should be conserved for any processes including a black hole evaporation @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "if we can not explain that the black hole evaporation is no more unitary , then we need to rethink about the meaning of the quantum theory of gravity .",
    "we do not have a consensus on the quantum theory of gravity that may give the solution to this problem , but we can only list various possibilities and candidates of the resolution @xcite .    the simplest way to resolve",
    "the problem is to think that information is attached by hawking radiation .",
    "however , if this is the case , it may imply that information should be duplicated between inside and outside the black hole as black hole complementarity argued @xcite .",
    "however , it is also known that the original assumptions of black hole complementarity can not be true @xcite , and hence we need to drop one of the assumptions of black hole complementarity , e.g. , dropping general relativity and introducing the firewall @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "if we introduce the firewall at once , then it should also modify not only the interior of the black hole but also the asymptotic future infinity @xcite .",
    "following these inconsistency arguments of black hole complementarity , if we assume that hawking radiation does not contain information , then perhaps , a more conservative resolution is to think that the information is retained by an object , e.g. , a remnant .",
    "there are various versions of this resolution , where we can briefly summarize this as the remnant picture @xcite",
    ". this picture can include various assertions , e.g. , the last burst of the black hole evaporation contains all information @xcite , the planck scale object carries all information @xcite , entanglements between inside and outside regions contains information @xcite , an internal large volume carries information @xcite , or a bubble universe inside the black hole contains all information @xcite",
    ".    what will be the correct answer ? in order to decide it , we need to check the consistency of each idea . in other words , what will be the condition that each idea ( either hawking radiation carries information or a remnant carries information ) works to resolve the information loss problem ?    in order to check the consistency of each idea , one interesting way to quantitative analysis was developed by page @xcite .",
    "we introduce a closed system with a fixed number of states and divide it to two subsystems ; and bring particles from one part ( black hole ) to the other part ( hawking radiation ) .",
    "then we can trace the flow of information ; we call this information curve as the _ page curve_. in these works , the people could use an averaged formula of the entropy of subsystems for a pure and random state @xcite . in this paper , by using numerical techniques , we want to investigate the ( broadly defined ) remnant picture . in order to do this ,",
    "we introduce one part more ( the remnant part ) ; hence , now we are dealing with a _ tripartite system _ ( a similar trial was done in @xcite in the context of the last burst picture @xcite ) . in this system",
    ", we can define various kinds of information , e.g. , information of each part @xcite as well as mutual information , and also trace their variations as the black hole evaporates . in order to calculate the information and entropy for random systems , we used numerical simulations .",
    "this analysis will show the quantitative functional working conditions of the remnant picture .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : pre ] , we summarize two issues , where one is the brief introduction of the information loss problem and the other is the page curve for bipartite systems . in sec .  [",
    "sec : inf ] , we discuss on the information flow of tripartite systems , where we can demonstrate various scenarios . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : dis ] , we summarize important conclusions of this analysis and retrospect the implications for the information loss problem .",
    "in this section , we summarize two topics . first",
    ", we briefly summarize candidates of the resolution of the information loss problem .",
    "second , we summarize and demonstrate the original page curve for bipartite systems .",
    "flowchart on resolutions of the information loss problem @xcite . ]    in order to resolve the information loss problem , there have been lots of suggestions of the resolution ( fig .",
    "[ fig : flowchart ] ) .",
    "first of all , there has been an opinion that information inside a black hole would be disappeared @xcite .",
    "however , if this is the case , then there is a possibility that energy of the universe may not be conserved , too @xcite ( though there is a controversy regarding this criticism @xcite ) . in any case ,",
    "due to the ads / cft correspondence @xcite , many people could believe that information should be conserved at least for the anti - de sitter background .    if information should be conserved , then the second question is this : _ what contains information _ of the black hole ?",
    "the first possibility is hawking radiation .",
    "this idea was summarized by _ black hole complementarity _ @xcite , where the main assumptions are summarized as follows @xcite :    * _ unitarity _ from the black hole formation to its evaporation , * _ general relativity _ for infalling observers ( before touching the singularity ) , * _ local quantum field theory _ for asymptotic observers , * _ statistical entropy _ of the black hole is proportional to the _ event horizon area _ ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the number of states of the black hole and @xmath5 is the area of the black hole horizon , * _ existence of an observer _ who can read and distinguish information from hawking radiation .",
    "if we accept these five assumptions , we can show inconsistency , either by the duplication experiment of information @xcite or by the almheiri - marolf - polchinski - sully ( amps ) thought experiment @xcite .",
    "if these five assumptions are not consistent , then we need to drop one of the assumptions .",
    "if we do not want to drop the first one ( unitarity ) , then there are four possibilities .",
    "* amps thoughts that dropping general relativity for infalling observers is the most conservative opinion and they introduced so - called the firewall around the horizon where general relativity is broken @xcite .",
    "one problem with this idea is that such a firewall is ( if exists ) possible to be naked to an asymptotic observer @xcite , and hence we need to drop not only general relativity but also the local quantum field theory for the asymptotic observer , too . *",
    "if we drop the third assumption ( local quantum field theory ) , then we may resolve the paradox .",
    "this can include a non - local information transfer @xcite .",
    "this is a logical possibility , but we do not have a good mechanism to realize this idea yet . in this picture , we may say that ( some part of ) information is leaked gradually , where ( some part of ) information is not carried by typical hawking radiation ; some part of information can be attached to the form of the correction of hawking radiation due to non - local effects . *",
    "if we drop the fourth assumption , then there is no link between the black hole area and the number of states of the black hole .",
    "if a very small area object can store a huge number of states , then this can explain the information loss problem .",
    "this picture is briefly called by the remnant picture @xcite . in this picture , there are several variations . *",
    "* the last planck scale burst restores all information @xcite or the final planck scale object carries all information @xcite .",
    "for these models , we need to explain how can such a small object has a huge entropy .",
    "in addition , typically this picture has the infinite production problem @xcite .",
    "in addition , if there is no such a mechanism , then the final remnant can store some part of information but may not be all of them . * * in order to overcome this problem , one may imagine that information is stored by a huge interior object @xcite or a bubble universe @xcite . regarding this , a typical criticism is that there is no generic principle or mechanism to justify large entropies .",
    "+ of course , there can be more variations from these possibilities ( e.g. , @xcite ) . *",
    "the last possibility is that even though the total wave function is unitary , there may be no semi - classical observer who can see the restoration of information ; only the superspace observer can read and distinguish information from the outcome of the black hole @xcite",
    ". this picture can be called by the effective loss of information @xcite , though this needs to be checked whether this can be a generic principle or not .",
    "if hawking radiation according to the local quantum field theory can not carry information , while it should be carried by another object ( i.e. , p2 or p3 ) , then these ideas can be approximately described not by the bipartite system but by the tripartite system , where the first part is the interior of the black hole ( say @xmath0 ) , the second part is the hawking radiation from the black hole ( according to the local quantum field theory , say @xmath1 ) , and the third part is the ` another ' contribution ( this can be anything , e.g. , non - local contributions to typical hawking radiation , the last burst , a planck scale object , or a large interior inside the black hole , etc . ,",
    "say @xmath2 ) .",
    "these ` another ' possibilities can be partly distinguished by the transferring process of states to @xmath2 , whether a part of states are leaked gradually to @xmath2 ( p2 ) , a small part of states are transferred to @xmath2 only at the last stage of the black hole ( p3 - 1 ) , or almost all states are transferred to @xmath2 ( p3 - 2 ) . in the following sections , we investigate these hypotheses by using a tripartite toy - model system .      in this subsection , we consider a system with the total number of states @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "we divide this system to two subsystems , where @xmath0 ( inside of the black hole ) has the number of states @xmath4 and @xmath1 ( outside of the black hole ) has the number of states @xmath7 ; @xmath4 and @xmath7 can vary as time goes on but @xmath8 is fixed .",
    "initially , we give @xmath9 and as time goes on , @xmath4 decreases and @xmath7 increases .    for a given state",
    ", we can define the density matrix : @xmath10 using this density matrix , we define the fine - grained entropy of @xmath1 , or so - called the entanglement entropy of part @xmath1 , by the formula : @xmath11 for the pure state , @xmath12",
    ".    then we are ready to define information contents between inside and outside the black hole .    * information for @xmath0 : @xmath13 . * information for @xmath1 : @xmath14 .",
    "* mutual information between @xmath0 and @xmath1 : @xmath15 .    for @xmath16 and @xmath17",
    ", this definition of information can be a useful measure @xcite , since it shows the difference between the exact thermal state and non - thermal states .",
    "in other words , if @xmath16 or @xmath17 is exactly zero , then there is no way to distinguish the state from the thermal equilibrium ; on the other hand , if @xmath16 or @xmath17 is greater than zero , then this shows that @xmath0 or @xmath1 is biased from the thermal state , and hence there should be a way to read or distinguish information .",
    "one further interesting note is the case of the pure state . then @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "therefore , @xmath20 and @xmath21 hence , information will be conserved for all processes @xcite .",
    "the problem is to calculate the entanglement entropy .",
    "we can further proceed by assuming that the system under consideration is pure and random @xcite : if @xmath22 , then @xmath23 initially , the emitted information is @xmath24 , and therefore is negligible .",
    "if @xmath25 , since @xmath26 for a pure state , one gets @xmath27 thus , after @xmath4 becomes greater than @xmath7 , the information emitted is given by @xmath28 , and then it gradually increases .",
    "the time of @xmath29 is called by the page time , and from this time , we can distinguish information from radiation .",
    "information flow , where @xmath16 ( black ) , @xmath17 ( red ) , and @xmath30 ( blue ) . ]    for a toy model of the spin-@xmath31 system , the page curve is produced by the following manner . here , we introduce @xmath32 number of spins . for each spin , we assign a probability : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is a spin index and @xmath35 with complex values @xmath36 and @xmath37 . the total state for the non - entangled case is @xmath38 and @xmath39 we introduce an arbitrary mixing factor @xmath40 .",
    "if @xmath41 , then all states are separable ; otherwise , it is not separable and is entangled @xcite .    using this quantum state",
    ", we can define a density matrix and trace out the @xmath32-th particle : @xmath42 if we repeat this process successively , we can describe the situation that particles move from part @xmath0 to part @xmath1 .",
    "a numerical demonstration of this process is in fig .",
    "[ fig : bipart ] .",
    "now , we consider a tripartite system that demonstrates various ideas of the information loss problem .",
    "we divide by three parts : interior of a black hole ( @xmath0 with the number of states @xmath4 ) , exterior of a black hole ( or typical hawking radiation , @xmath1 with the number of states @xmath7 ) , and another part that can be interpreted in various ways ( @xmath2 with the number of states @xmath43 ) . for simplicity ,",
    "we give the condition that the total number of states is a fixed constant @xmath6 : @xmath44 . in the initial condition @xmath45 and @xmath46 ; and in the final condition @xmath47 , while @xmath7 or @xmath43 depends on scenarios .",
    "then we can easily generalize the information contents of a tripartite system @xcite .",
    "first , information for each sectors are    * information for @xmath0 : @xmath48 . * information for @xmath1 : @xmath49 . * information for @xmath2 : @xmath50 .",
    "mutual information between @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 are as follows :    * mutual information between @xmath0 and @xmath1 : @xmath54 . * mutual information between @xmath1 and @xmath2 : @xmath55 . * mutual information between @xmath0 and @xmath2 : @xmath56 .",
    "finally , we define the mutual information for @xmath57 :    * tripartite information : @xmath58 .    for a pure state ,",
    "@xmath59 for any @xmath60 and @xmath61 as well as @xmath62 .",
    "therefore , these definitions can be simplified as follows :    * @xmath63 .",
    "* @xmath64 .",
    "* @xmath65 .",
    "* @xmath66 .",
    "* @xmath67 .",
    "* @xmath68 . * @xmath69 .    for this pure state , @xmath70 and hence the total information is conserved .      in order to generalize the page curve for tripartite systems using numerical techniques",
    ", we use a toy model of spins .",
    "this was successfully and completely reproduced the page curve for bipartite systems ( sec .",
    "[ sec : pag ] ) . following this",
    ", we can expect that the toy model of spins will reproduce essential properties of tripartite systems .",
    "first , we consider the total system as a tensor product of three subsystems @xmath0 ( inside of the black hole ) , @xmath1 ( hawking radiation ) , and @xmath2 ( another part ) in the hilbert space : @xmath71 .",
    "we know that the number of states of @xmath0 is @xmath6 and of @xmath1 and @xmath2 are @xmath72 in the beginning .",
    "we suppose that one particle is released from @xmath0 to @xmath1 or @xmath2 at each step .",
    "then as particle comes out from @xmath0 , the number of states of @xmath0 decreases and that of @xmath1 or @xmath2 increases since the total number of states is a constant . as the number of states of each subsystem changes , reduced density matrices also become different .",
    "we calculate the entanglement entropy , the information , and the mutual information from the reduced density matrix of each system at each step .",
    "the number of states of the total system is @xmath73 .",
    "hence , the quantum states of particles in total system have the form @xmath74 represents the spin states of particles . in order to make arbitrary quantum states , we set @xmath75 as a random number .",
    "then the density matrix is written as @xmath76 .",
    "it is also written as @xmath77    in order to calculate each system s information , we operate partial traces to the density matrix .",
    "we do partial trace for the system @xmath0 first and do for @xmath1 and @xmath2 next . in",
    "below , @xmath78 $ ] means entry of @xmath79-th row and @xmath80-th column of @xmath81 .",
    "then we can obtain the reduced density matrices following the procedures : @xmath82 & = & \\sum_{k=1}^{m\\ell}{\\rho[n(i-1)+k , n(j-1)+k]},\\\\ ( \\rho_{b}\\otimes\\rho_{c})[i , j]&=&\\sum_{k=1}^{n}{\\rho[m\\ell(k-1)+i , m\\ell(k-1)+j]},\\\\ \\rho_{b}[i , j]&=&\\sum_{k=1}^{\\ell}{(\\rho_{b}\\otimes\\rho_{c})[m(i-1)+k , m(j-1)+k]},\\\\ \\rho_{c}[i , j]&=&\\sum_{k=1}^{m}{(\\rho_{b}\\otimes\\rho_{c})[\\ell(k-1)+i,\\ell(k-1)+j]}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] consequently , we get three reduced density matrices of @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 .",
    "now , information for @xmath0 is @xmath83 . here , the entanglement entropy of @xmath0 is written as follows : @xmath84 the other parts of information can be defined in a similar way .    due to the limitation of the computing power , in this paper",
    ", we use @xmath85 spin-@xmath31 particles , so that the total number of states is @xmath86 . for the statistical precision",
    ", we repeated the same procedure fifty times by changing initial random states ; and then we evaluated the mean value .",
    "in order to show the physical tendency , we smoothly connected by b - splines . finally , we plotted graphs of information of subsystems @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 and various mutual information .",
    "the parameter of @xmath87-axis is @xmath88 to represent the number of spins emitting from @xmath0 that is a monotone function of the time .",

    "[ fig : p2_12 ] , [ fig : p31_12 ] , and [ fig : p32_12 ] .    information ( left ) and mutual information ( right ) flow for p2 ( with @xmath96 and @xmath97).,title=\"fig : \" ] information ( left ) and mutual information ( right ) flow for p2 ( with @xmath96 and @xmath97).,title=\"fig : \" ]    information ( left ) and mutual information ( right ) flow for p2 ( with @xmath96 and @xmath97).,title=\"fig : \" ] information ( left ) and mutual information ( right ) flow for p2 ( with @xmath96 and @xmath97).,title=\"fig : \" ]      in the scenario p2 , we assume @xmath94 and @xmath43 gradually increases as demonstrated in figs .",
    "[ fig : p2_82 ] and [ fig : p2_73 ] .",
    "since @xmath43 gradually increases , the mutual information during the evaporation can be quite complicated .",
    "although the mutual information @xmath98 and @xmath99 wiggly behave ( probably , this is due to the fact that our number of particles are too small ) , there is a clear tendency that they start from zero , reach the maximum around the halfway , and finally become zero .",
    "in addition , similar as the case of the bipartite system , information of hawking radiation @xmath17 begins to increase around the halfway point .",
    "although the intermediate information transfer by mutual information is quite complicated , the information should be transferred by two channels at the last stage : the information of @xmath1 , i.e. , @xmath17 , and the mutual information between @xmath1 and @xmath2 , i.e. , @xmath100 .",
    "therefore , the existence of @xmath2 ( probably , a non - local transfer of information ) drastically changes the type of information . in other words , finally , hawking radiation should contain a certain amount of information , but it can not contain all of them ; the other part of information should be the form of the mutual information between hawking radiation and its corrections ( denoted by @xmath2 ) .",
    "one more interesting remark is that @xmath101 is negligible all over the time .",

    "[ fig : p32_46 ] or [ fig : p32_37 ] , we can see clear behaviors that information is transferred in the form of @xmath101 and @xmath100 .",
    "in addition , information of hawking radiation ( @xmath17 ) is almost negligible , and hence hawking radiation would be almost perfectly thermal .",

    "the amount of information depends on @xmath92 ( the degrees of freedom of @xmath1 ) and @xmath93 ( the degrees of freedom of @xmath2 ) .",
    "there are three cases ( table  [ tab : sum ] ) : ( 1 ) @xmath110 , where information is stored by @xmath17 and @xmath100 , while @xmath101 is negligible ; ( 2 ) @xmath111 , where information is stored by @xmath100 , while @xmath17 and @xmath101 are both negligible ; and ( 3 ) @xmath108 , where information is stored by @xmath101 and @xmath100 , while @xmath17 is negligible .",
    "this conclusion is not so surprising . at the end of the evaporation , this is nothing but to divide a system to two entangled subsystems .",
    "therefore , as we see @xmath1 and @xmath2 at the last stage , we would see the information of the bipartite system such as in fig .",
    "[ fig : bipart ] . in this bipartite system , around the marginal limit @xmath111 ( corresponding to the page time )",
    ", the mutual information ( @xmath112 ) reaches its maximum , while @xmath17 and @xmath101 both are negligible . before this limit ( i.e. , @xmath110 , as @xmath92 decreases , @xmath17 decreases and @xmath100 increases , while @xmath101 is almost negligible ; the opposite thing happens for @xmath108 . at the end of the time evolution ,",
    "our results for tripartite systems are exactly consistent with those of bipartite systems .",
    "in this paper , we investigated information flow of tripartite systems .",
    "especially , we focused on three scenarios : ( p2 ) non - local effects continuously transports information , ( p3 - 1 ) information is stored in the last stage , and ( p3 - 2 ) information is transferred to the internal huge space .",
    "although these categories are quite simplified , our numerical investigations give important wisdoms and we could observe various interesting features for each scenario . especially , we summarize the following important conclusions :    * if there is a hidden part @xmath2 , then the role of mutual information is very important because a significant amount of information will be stored in the form of @xmath100 .",
    "* when there is a leak of information to a hidden degree of freedom @xmath2 , the entanglement entropy or mutual information sensitively depends on the detailed leakage process . if the leakage happens only the end of the evaporation ( p3 - 1 ) , then during the evaporation we can not distinguish the information leakage ; if it happens gradually ( p2 ) , then we can in principle experimentally notice this . * if hawking radiation is completely thermal , then the only consistent way to explain unitarity is to assume that the hidden space @xmath2 has very large degrees of freedom ( on the order of the black hole entropy ) .",
    "* there is the marginal limit that realizes the locking of information scenario , but this requires a large entropy of the black hole interior by the end of the evaporation .",
    "one significant conclusion from our study is as follows .",
    "_ the following three contents can not be consistent _ : ( 1 )  unitarity , ( 2 )  hawking radiation is totally thermal , and ( 3 )  the remnant has small degrees of freedom compared to the initial entropy .",
    "this seriously restricts various scenarios of the remnant picture ; the existence of the remnant is not enough and we need to explain the huge entropy inside of it .",
    "if it is not possible to imagine ( or at least , if it is not generic ) such a huge number of degrees of freedom of a remnant , a large volume , or a bubble universe ( or , very active non - local transfer of information ) , then hawking radiation should contain a bit of information whatever the end stage of the black hole is . in this case , we need to struggle with the menace of black hole complementarity .",
    "one may introduce a firewall , but this can cause problems .    therefore , our work clarified the _ sharp tension _ between various assumptions regarding the information loss problem",
    ". then do we need to begin to think the possibility that information is not attached by hawking radiation nor retained by another object , and hence effectively disappeared , but the total information is conserved by a certain way ?",
    "perhaps , this kind of the effective loss of information would be a good idea and we remain this for future investigations .",
