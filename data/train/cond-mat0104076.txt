    "charged colloidal suspensions are a subject of intense experimental and theoretical work not only because of their direct application in industrial or biological processes , but also because they represent model systems for atomistic systems .",
    "the electrostatic interactions involved in such systems have a fundamental role in determining their physico - chemical properties @xcite",
    ". theoretical description of highly charged colloidal solutions faces two challenges : ( i ) different typical length scales due to the presence of macroions ( i. e. charged colloids of the size 10 - 1000  )  and microscopic counterions and ( ii ) their _ long - range _ coulomb interaction . a first simplifying assumption is to treat the solvent as a dielectric medium solely characterized by its relative permittivity @xmath0 . a second widely used approximation",
    "consists in modeling the _ short range _ ion - ion excluded volume interaction by hard spheres .",
    "these two approximations are the basis of the so - called primitive model of electrolyte solutions .",
    "the system under consideration is an asymmetrical electrolyte solution made up of highly charged macroions and small counterions . a further simplification motivated by this asymmetry",
    "can be made by partitioning the system into subvolumes ( cells ) , each containing one macroion together with its neutralizing counterions plus ( if present ) additional salt .",
    "this approximation has been called accordingly the cell model @xcite .",
    "the cells adopt the symmetry of the macroion , here spherical , and are electrostatically decoupled .",
    "it is within the cell model that we present our simulation results .    for spherical macroions the structural charge",
    "is usually modeled by a _",
    "_ charge _ , which by gauss theorem is equivalent to a _ uniform _ surface charge density as far as the electric field ( or potential ) _ outside _ the spherical colloid is concerned .",
    "most analytical concepts as well as simulations rely on the above assumptions and especially on the central charge assumption .",
    "it is well known that in the strong coulomb coupling regime ion - ion correlations become very important , and significant deviations from mean - field approaches are expected . a counter - intuitive effect which classical mean - field theories ( like poisson - boltzmann model )",
    "can not explain is the phenomenon of _ overcharge _ , also called charge inversion .",
    "that is , there are counterions in _ excess _ in the vicinity of the macroion surface so that its net charge changes sign .",
    "this has recently attracted significant attention @xcite . in particular , we showed recently that this phenomenon may give rise to a strong long range attraction between like - sign charged colloids @xcite . a natural question which comes up is : does overcharge and more generally ion - ion correlations strongly depend on the way the macroion structural charge is represented ( i. e. uniformly charged or discrete charges on its surface ) ? in a recent paper @xcite , we studied such a situation in the strong coulomb coupling regime where the macroion charge was carried by divalent microions in the presence of divalent counterions ( _ same _ ionic valence ) . in ref .",
    "@xcite we reported the important result showing that overcharge is still possible under those conditions .",
    "moreover we showed that the intrinsic electric field solely due to the macroion surface microions ( without counterions ) varies strongly from point to point on the colloidal sphere @xcite .",

    "we first treat the systems where we have monovalent counterions , that is we have to deal with the symmetric discrete system ( -1:+1 ) .",

    "the counterion structure consists of a pseudo - wigner crystal ( wc ) as was already found in refs . @xcite .",
    "also the higher the absolute number of counterions @xmath61 ( i. e. the concentration @xmath62 ) the higher the order of counterion structure for the continuous case [ compare fig .",
    "[ fig.gs-ccf-monovalent](a ) with fig .",
    "[ fig.gs-ccf-monovalent](c ) ] .",
    "it turns out that in the case of discrete colloidal charges the counterion distribution is strongly dictated by the colloidal charge distribution and especially for low macroion surface charge density @xmath27 ( @xmath60 ) [ see fig .",

    "are almost identical .",
    "this indicates that each counterion is exactly associated with one dcc site .",
    "the ground state structure for @xmath60 is depicted in fig . [ fig.gs-snapshot-mono-zm-60-360](a ) where one clearly observes this ionic pairing .",
    "this strong ionic pair association can be easily explained in terms of _ local _ correlations .",
    "let us consider the picture sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig.dipoles ] which holds for strong ionic pairing , where a given dipole a ( ionic pair made up of a counterion and a dcc site ) on the macroion surface essentially interacts with its first nearest surrounding dipoles b. note that very similar lengths were also considered in a recent theoretical study @xcite in the one - dimensional case ( counterion adsorption on a linear polyelectrolyte ) .",
    "it is important to have in mind that such a local description is physically justified due to the strong screening generated by ionic pairing .",
    "thereby local correlations are twofold : ( i ) the _ attractive _ interaction between the dcc site of dipole a with its paired counterion and the counterions of dipoles b , and ( ii ) the _ repulsive _ interaction between the counterion of dipole a and counterions of dipoles b. the correlations between dcc sites are not relevant since they are fixed .",
    "the intra - dipole attractive interaction @xmath64 between the dcc site and its `` pinned '' counterion can be written as    @xmath65    for the elementary nearest inter - dipole ( or inter - ionic pair ) interactions , one can write for the attractive interaction @xmath66 between the dcc site of dipole a and the counterion of dipole b :    @xmath67    a similar expression can be written for the repulsive inter - dipole interaction @xmath68 involving counterions of dipole a and dipole b , which reads    @xmath69    note that the repulsive counterion - counterion term @xmath68 alone , even if space",
    "_ _ truncated _ _ , drives to the _ long - range _ ordered triangular wc structure .",
    "however at zero temperature the dcc sites represent pinning centers for the counterions where the electrostatic potential is considerably lowered ( due to the term @xmath64 ) compared to its direct `` empty '' neighborhood ( charge hole ) , which in turn prevents the counterions from adopting the ideal wc structure .",
    "this latter aspect was thoroughly discussed in ref .",
    "another important quantity characterizing discrete systems is the ratio    @xmath70    between the mean inter - dipole separation @xmath71 ( more exactly the mean counterion - counterion separation ) and intra - dipole separation @xmath72 of an ionic pair ( in the present study @xmath73 as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig.dipoles ] ) . the value of @xmath71 can be obtained by taking the first peak position of @xmath74 .",
    "obviously , for sufficiently low macroion surface charge density @xmath27 ( i. e. large @xmath75 ) the ionic pairing term @xmath64 will be dominant and strong ionic pairing occurs . more specifically ,",
    "when the typical inter - dipole distance is large compared to the intra - dipole distance then dipole - dipole interactions are weak ( i. e. , @xmath76 ) and the dcc distribution dictates the counterion structure .",
    "this is what qualitatively explains our simulation findings for @xmath60 [ see fig . [",
    "fig.gs-ccf-monovalent](a ) and fig .",
    "[ fig.gs-snapshot-mono-zm-60-360](a ) ] .",
    "when @xmath77 becomes sufficiently important the situation may become qualitatively different . in this case",
    "dipoles approach each other and because of excluded volume @xmath78 becomes comparable to @xmath79 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig.dipoles ] ) .",
    "thereby , the counterion - counterion repulsion term @xmath68 ( overcompensating @xmath66 ) induces counterion ordering _",
    "compatible _ with the local attractive pinning potential field generated by dcc centers .",
    "this effect can be inspected in fig . [ fig.gs-ccf-monovalent](b ) and fig . [ fig.gs-ccf-monovalent](c ) where one sees that upon increasing @xmath27 , @xmath63 is gradually less correlated with @xmath53 and more correlated with @xmath74 . as a topological consequence",
    ", some counterions will be in contact with several ( two or more ) dcc attractors as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig.gs-snapshot-mono-zm-60-360](b ) .    the quasi - triangular counterion arrangement for high @xmath27 ( @xmath80 ) can be inspected in fig . [ fig.gs-snapshot-mono-zm-60-360](b ) . for this symmetric system in size ( same diameter for the counterions and the dcc ions )",
    "one expects that for a compact amorphous dcc layer the counterion structure should become perfectly ordered .",
    "this extreme limit which would correspond to unreachable experimental charge densities has not been addressed in our simulations .    in parallel , increasing @xmath27 induces by purely excluded volume effect a stronger local order within the dcc layer as can be checked on the @xmath53 plots in figs . [ fig.gs-ccf-monovalent](a)-(c ) .",
    "this is quite similar to what occurs in a system of hard spheres where the ( dense ) liquid phase is locally correlated and the ( dilute ) gaseous phase is uncorrelated .    in summary ,",
    "the system depicted above is the siege of an _ order - disorder _ phase transition where upon increasing @xmath27 ( i. e. decreasing @xmath75 ) we pass from a disordered counterion structure ( imposed by the dcc layer ) to a _ long - range _ ordered one which is induced by _",
    "local _ counterion - counterion correlations .",
    "although results presented above concern one given random distribution ( for each @xmath81 ) , we carefully checked that similar results and conclusions could be drawn for different random realizations ( systematically five ) .",
    "this also holds for the following section below where we deal with multivalent counterions .",
    "we turn to the asymmetric discrete systems @xmath82 where multivalent counterions are present ( @xmath83 ) .",
    "the correlation functions @xmath50 for two macroion charges @xmath60 and @xmath84 and various counterion valences @xmath85 can be found in fig .",
    "[ fig.gs-ccf-multivalent ] .",
    "one remarks that upon decreasing the number of counterions @xmath61 ( i.e. , increasing @xmath85 ) for fixed @xmath81 , the first peak of @xmath44 is gradually shifted to the right ( compare also the monovalent case given in fig .",
    "[ fig.gs-ccf-monovalent ] ) whatever the nature of the macroion charge is ( discrete or continuous ) .",
    "furthermore , we observe for the discrete systems that upon increasing @xmath85 ( for fixed @xmath2 ) the correlation between @xmath63 and @xmath53 decreases and increases between @xmath63 and @xmath74 .",

    "the very high counterion valence @xmath86 reported in fig .",
    "[ fig.gs-ccf-multivalent](e ) was undertaken in order to stress the counterion multivalence effect .",
    "these findings lead to the conclusion that the counterion valence has the effect of reducing the disorder in the counterion structure stemming from the randomness of the dcc distribution .",
    "this related phenomenon can be theoretically explained with simple ideas .",
    "basically , the mechanisms involved in this counterion valence induced ordering stem from two concomitant sources : ( i ) _ topological _ and ( ii ) correlational .",
    "the topological aspect is due to the presence of @xmath87 unbound dcc sites ( free of associated counterion ) ensuring global electroneutrality [ compare for instance fig .",
    "[ fig.gs-snapshot-mono-zm-60-360](a ) and fig .",
    "[ fig.gs-snapshot-multi-zm180 ] ] .",
