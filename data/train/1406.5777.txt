    "in a recent series of papers @xcite , it has been shown that commutator methods can be used to study the absolutely continuous spectrum of various classes of ergodic dynamical systems . in the present work ,",
    "we pursue this approach by showing that the property of strong mixing can also be established using commutator methods .",
    "more specifically , we present new criteria in terms of commutators for the strong mixing property of two abstract classes of dynamical systems : discrete flows @xmath0 induced by a unitary operator @xmath2 and continuous flows @xmath1 induced by a self - adjoint operator @xmath3 .    in the unitary case ,",

    "we prove the following result ( see theorem [ thm_unitary ] for a precise statement ) : if the topological degree @xmath12 exists and satisfies some weak regularity assumption with respect to @xmath7 , then @xmath2 is strongly mixing and has purely continuous spectrum in the subspace @xmath14 .",
    "( in some cases , we can even prove that @xmath2 has purely absolutely continuous spectrum in the subspace @xmath14 , see remark [ rem_unitary](a ) and corollary [ second_cor_unitary ] ) .",
    "this result on strong mixing extends to a completely general hilbertian setting some related result in the framework of skew products of compact lie groups ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "3.6 ) and references therein ) .",
    "moreover , since it applies in particular to koopman operators , it provides a surprisingly simple and general criterion to determine when an invertible measure - preserving transformation is strongly mixing and has purely continuous spectrum in some subspace .",

    "the diversity of the examples covered in our paper and the simplicity of our proofs suggest that our results could be applied to various other models in ergodic theory and spectral theory .",
