    "recent hinode satellite solar optical telescope ( sot ) observations , and transition region and coronal explorer ( trace ) satellite extreme ultraviolet ( euv ) imaging observations show that some coronal loop oscillations are associated with flows and jets in cool ( @xmath3mk ) coronal loops @xcite .",
    "the difficulties in distinguishing between slow magnetosonic waves and quasi - periodic flows in some euv time - sequence images of coronal loops are well known ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "however , the quasi - periodic signatures propagating along the loops seen in euv difference images and quasi - periodic doppler blue shift in spectral emission lines are still being debated regarding their wave / flow nature due to the limited quality of the present data : e.g. , insufficient spectral and spatial - temporal resolutions and small signal - to - noise ( s / n ) ratios @xcite .",
    "linear mhd models of slow magnetosonic waves in coronal loops with steady background flows developed in the past were limited to straight cylindrical structures , and linear waves ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "impulsive excitation of slow magnetosonic waves without flows in bipolar magnetic structures was recently considered in 2d mhd @xcite , and recently in 3d mhd @xcite models . in these studies",
    "it was found that the simultaneously excited fast magnetosonic waves could facilitate the establishment of standing slow magnetosonic waves in curved magnetic field geometry .",
    "recently , @xcite studied slow magnetosonic waves in an expanding coronal loop associated with a coronal mass ejection ( cme ) using 3d mhd .",
    "the propagation and dissipations of slow magnetosonic waves in coronal plumes with background solar wind flow were studied using 2.5d mhd @xcite .",
    "oscillations of multiple cylindrical coronal loop strands that include coupled slow waves , transverse waves and the nonlinear interaction with background steady flow were studied using 3d mhd model @xcite .",
    "the present study expands previous models by including for the first time impulsive and non - steady flow injection that excites the waves in magnetic loops of a bi - polar active region ( ar ) in the full 3d mhd model .",
    "the nonlinear interactions of the oscillations and flows are studied in realistic ar geometry in hot coronal ar plasma model stratified by solar gravity .",
    "the results demonstrate that injection of steady and non - steady flows at the footpoints of coronal loops excite compressional waves in longitudinal and transverse directions to the loop s magnetic field .",
    "the model shows that the same impulsive process at the corona - transition region boundary can produce flows and waves in coronal ar loops .",
    "it was suggested that the standing slow - mode waves in hot coronal loops are excited by small ( or micro- ) flares at one footpoint @xcite . @xcite",
    "examined the evolution of fe and fe line profiles in the initial phase for 54 oscillations , and found that nearly half show the presence of two spectral components : the stationary component , and the shifted component that reaches maximal doppler velocity on the order of 100@xmath4300 km  s@xmath1 .",
    "these features suggest that the initiation of waves is closely associated with hot plasma upflows produced in flares .",
    "the oscillation event , occurring at 11:20 ut on 2002 april 17 above the north - west limb , is such a clear example ( see figures  14 in @xcite ) .",
    "this event was first studied by @xcite using soho / sumer observations , and was further analyzed by @xcite using reuven ramaty high energy solar spectroscopic imager ( rhessi ) data to explore the trigger mechanism .",
    "the sumer observed two brightenings in the fe xix line located at the intersections of the slit with a coronal loop .",
    "the evolution of fe xix spectral profiles shows the emergence of a second component , which has the doppler velocity up to 230 km s@xmath1 , measured by double gaussian fits .",
    "the slow - mode waves were seen excited following this initial hot flow injection .",
    "the rhessi observed a hard x - ray source near the northern footpoint of the oscillating loop , suggesting that a hot flow pulse produced by a microflare ( e.g. , via the explosive chromospheric evaporation ) moves upward along the loop , leading to the two brightenings as observed by sumer .",
    "this example indicates that the slow - mode wave may be driven by the hot flow that is produced by energy release near the loop s footpoint .",
    "similarly , the association of continuous upflows and propagating slow waves observed in coronal loops near the edge of ars by hinode / eis suggests that they may result from the same mechanism , associated with tiny nanoflare - like small - scale energy release @xcite .",
    "the sumer oscillation events have high recurrence rate ( 23 times within two hours ) , consistent with the hypothesis of their microflaring origin .",
    "we speculate that the nanoflares could produce nearly continuous upflows near the loop s footpoints because of their much higher recurrence rate , while larger , lower - frequency flares are responsible for the discernible quasi - periodic wave disturbances that propagate upwards more than 70 mm above the footpoints . a noticeable difference is detected between the upflow related phenomena observed by eis and sumer .",
    "the eis continuous upflows and propagating slow waves are most clearly observed in warm ( 12 mk ) coronal loops , while those detected by sumer are observed in hot ( @xmath56 mk ) flaring loops .",
    "this observational difference can be understood by recent nanoflare models ( see the review by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that predict the presence of small amount of very hot ( @xmath5 5 mk ) plasma .",
    "there are two main reasons that make hot spectral lines hard to detect : the shorter lifetime and the lower densities of the hot material compared the the warm plasma .",
    "therefore , we model these phenomena in hot coronal loops as a first reasonable step with the aim of understanding the relationship between flows and waves excitations by impulsive events at the loops footpoints .",
    "here , we describe the numerical 3d mhd model used to study the hot ar loops with flows and waves . the resistive 3d mhd equations are solved with gravity and isothermal energy equation on a cartesian @xmath6 grid using the modified lax - wendroff method with 4th order stabilization ( smoothing ) term .",

    "it is interesting to note that the normalized magnetic field strength , @xmath58 and the fast magnetosnic speed @xmath34 along the loop decrease with height by a factor of 3 for the short loop and by an order of magnitude for the long loop .",
    "the significant variation of the magnetic field and the fast magnetosonic speed is usually neglected in linear coronal seismology models ( see the review by * ? ? ?",
    "the density along the loops varies by @xmath59 for the short loop , and @xmath60 for the long loop .",

    "it is evident that the steady inflow leads to the formation of a steady short loop in the low-@xmath31 region of the model ar .",
    "the short loop is filled with inflowing coronal plasma and reaches higher ( nonuniform ) density than the surrounding plasma by a factor @xmath63 .",
    "since the euv line emission in optically thin coronal plasma is proportional to @xmath64 this loop would appear twice brighter than the same loop preceding the inflow in background - subtracted euv images .",
    "in figure  [ rh_v_xy_s : fig ] the cut in the @xmath65 plane at @xmath66 of the density and the velocity of the ar with the short loop are shown .",
    "the locations of the upflow and downflow that correspond to the loop with higher than the surroundings density are evident .",
    "in addition the circular structures in the density and the velocity are formed due to the compression and rarefaction produced by the flow in the ar and the fast magnetosonic waves emitted in the initial impulsive stage of the loop formation .",

    "the time - distance plot e is aligned along the @xmath68 direction centered at @xmath69 through the apex of the short loop .",
    "it is evident that the temporal oscillation of the loop in the @xmath68 direction is small , and the density variations are due primarily to compressive density oscillation , following an initial transient stage ( the time for the inflow to reach the apex of the loop ) .",
    "the time - distance plot f is aligned along the @xmath70 direction centered at height @xmath71 through the apex of the loop and shows the oscillatory displacement of the loop top , with evidence of compressive density oscillations . by comparing time - distance plots",

    "the displacements of the loops two footpoints are in - phase , i.e. , the loop sways left and right in the loops curvature plane , whereas the intensity oscillations near the two footpoints are in anti - phase , a signature of the fundamental slow mode wave , which has the density anti - nodes at the footpoints .",
    "these loop oscillations are similar to the second harmonic of the vertical kink mode discussed by @xcite in connection with trace euv coronal active region loop oscillations .    figure  [ vbn_t_siphon_v0_05xp00_8_f : fig ] shows the temporal evolution of the velocity components , the perturbed magnetic field components , and the perturbed density at the right footpoint of the short loop ( point @xmath74 ) with steady inflow . at this location",
    "the velocity along the loop has two components in the cartesian frame ( @xmath70 and @xmath68 ) as evident in figure  [ loop_s : fig]a .",
    "it is evident that it takes about 15@xmath67 for the perturbation along the loop to reach this position .",
    "the loop contains both , compressive and transverse oscillations , as evident in the time dependence of the velocity and magnetic field component oscillations , as well as the density fluctuations .",
    "the transverse waves are excited by the momentum of the injected velocity pulse and the centrifugal force exerted by the inflow on the curved ( dipole ) field lines , with the lorentz force acting as the restoring force .",
    "the slow mode wave period is @xmath75 ( determined from the last oscillation period of @xmath76 ) , and the oscillations damp in several periods due to leakage at the footpoints and outside the loop as a result of finite @xmath31 allowing oblique propagation and leakage of the slow magnetosonic waves in curved magnetic geometry . the quarter period phase shift between the density and the velocity components along the loop indicate the presence of standing slow - mode waves is established quickly .",
    "the presence of the slow mode wave is also evident from nearly anti - phase relation between @xmath77 and @xmath76 ( see the vertical red dashes lines in figure  [ vbn_t_siphon_v0_05xp00_8_f : fig ] ) . the anti - phase relation is not exact due to the effects of nonlinearity , and non - modality ( i.e. , the oscillation are not exact normal modes of the loop ) of the oscillations .",
    "the effects of nonlinearity are evident in the non - sinusoidality of the oscillations at the initial stages of the evolution .",
    "the calculations were repeated with smaller velocity amplitude ( @xmath78 ) confirming that these effects are due to nonlinearity and the magnitude of the initial pulse .",

    "the red dashed line marks three consecutive peaks of the density perturbation , @xmath76 .",
    "it is evident that @xmath80 is in phase with @xmath76 indicating the presence of fast mode wave and the corresponding kink oscillation of the curved loop in the @xmath32 plane induced at the impulsive initial stage of the inflow .",
    "the variations in @xmath76 and @xmath80 are caused by the oscillations of the nonuniform loop with respect to the fixed point @xmath58 , with contribution from compressive effects ( see , figure  [ td_sl : fig ] ) .",
    "the period of the oscillation is 35@xmath67 based on the second and third peaks .",
    "this period is shorter than slow wave period and longer than the kink mode period of the fundamental mode for a cylinder of length @xmath81 ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) given by @xmath82 , where @xmath83 , with the ratio of the density inside and outside the loop @xmath84 from the model calculations .",
    "noting that @xmath85 decrease with height in the loop we get @xmath86 at the apex of the loop .",
    "however , the theoretical kink mode period of @xmath87 is a factor of 3 shorter than the period found in the model .",
    "thus , the observed fast mode is not a linear fundamental kink mode of the loop but nonlinearly driven fast mode oscillation with similar properties to the second harmonic of the vertical kink mode .",
    "further justification of this interpretation is obtained by inspecting the phase and period relation between @xmath80 , @xmath76 , and @xmath88 .",
    "it is evident that @xmath88 period is twice as long as the @xmath80 , @xmath76 , and peaks , nodes , and minima of @xmath88 all correspond to peaks of @xmath76 and @xmath80 , suggesting that the fast mode is driven nonlinearly by a term that depends on @xmath89 .",
    "such second order term appears in the @xmath70 component of the momentum equation @xmath90 .",
    "the nonlinearly driven fast mode waves damp as the driving amplitude of the slow waves decreases with time .",

    "the waves damp due to leakage of the slow wave outside the loop .",
    "evidence for the formation of slow standing wave is seen in the nearly quarter period phase shift between the velocity along the loop and @xmath76 . however , in the case of the long loop the periods of the oscillations is longer as expected , and the formation of the slow standing wave takes longer time than in the short loop . by comparing the short and long loop oscillations",
    "it is evident that the periods of the oscillations and the wavelengths are related to the loop lengths .",
    "the ratio of their periods is about a factor of two , close the loop s length ratio of @xmath94 .",
    "wave period values in both loops are in qualitative agreement with the classical expression @xmath95 for the fundamental mode of the slow magnetosonic wave in a straight cylinder ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) with the short loop in better agreement . however , quantitatively the slow wave periods is smaller by 16% for the short loop and by 17% for the long loop case .",
    "the difference is mainly due to the curved magnetic geometry and nonuniformity of the loops .    in the following ,",
    "we report the results for the periodic flow injection cases .",

    "it is evident that after the short initial phase as the perturbations reach the above position , the loop s magnetic field , velocity , and density exhibits quasi - periodic oscillations induced by the periodic flow injection at the footpoint . the velocity fluctuations along the loop",

    "the temporal evolution of @xmath93 shows two dominant frequencies due to the combined effect of the driver and the slow mode wave in the loop .",
    "no temporal damping or growth of the oscillations is evident in the driven case at the steady state , since the fluctuation are injected at the right footpoint continuously , and exit the loop at the left footpoint boundary .",
    "the non - sinusoidality of the oscillations is evident and is due to the nonlinear interaction between the flow periodicity , the resulting variation of the local loop alfvn speed that affects the properties of the alfvnic fluctuations , and the waves produced in the loop .",
    "the nonlinear effects are reduced when the same calculation is repeated with smaller injected velocity amplitude ( @xmath78 , not shown ) .    in figure",

    "a steady loop is formed following steady inflow and induced damped oscillations in the initial transitory stage ( longitudinal and transverse ) in the short loop that lays entirely in the low-@xmath31 region of the ar . when the periodic flow is injected in such magnetic loop the density structure in the loop",
    "is dominated by the structure of the flow with small effects due to waves in the loop . in the long loop the steady state",
    "is not reached , and the density of the loop is variable throughout the evolution for both types of inflow .",
    "when the inflow is periodic the effects of the waves induced by the flow are significant in the long loop ( for the magnitude of the flow in the present study ) and the density structure exhibits the coupled fast magnetosonic and the slow wave shock - like structure in the high-@xmath31 region of the model ar .",
    "high resolution and high cadence observations indicate that some coronal loop oscillations are associated with flows along the loops and with jets at loops footpoints . whether propagating intensity disturbances seen in euv imaging observations of the coronal loop structures are flows or waves is still under intensive debate .",
    "on one hand the propagating disturbances have been interpreted as signatures of slow magnetoacoustic waves since their propagating speeds are close to the sound speed in the corona , and 3 min or 5 min periodicities suggest their association with the leakage of the photospheric @xmath101-modes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "however , these observational signatures were found to be consistent with slow mode waves as well @xcite .",
    "our 3d mhd model results of flows and associated waves in hot coronal loops show the close connection between the two phenomena and suggest that both may be present simultaneously and produced by the same impulsive events at the footpoints ( or corona / transition region interface ) of coronal loops .",
    "in particular , we study the effects of localized inflow at the lower coronal boundary in a bi - polar magnetic field of hot ar coronal loops .",
    "the 3d mhd model reproduced the basic physical coupling between steady and periodic flows , waves , and loop density and magnetic structures in realistic ar geometry , with applications to coronal seismology , extending previous studies that use more simplified models and help addressing the controversy of flows vs. waves discussed above .",
    "the main limitations of our ar model are the use of idealized magnetic structure with dipole field , and gravitationally stratified density in the initial state .",
    "in addition the isothermal energy equation is used , simplifying the calculations considerably at the expense of calculating the effects of heat conduction , heating and cooling of the material injected into the loops , and the possible heating of the loops by the energy released in the impulsive events .",
    "we investigate the effects of steadily injected inflow in short and long magnetic loops and the associated oscillations in the initial impulsive stage .",
    "we find that the inflow at the footpoints of coronal magnetic loops leads to formation of higher density than the surroundings loops due to the siphon effect in the curved bipolar magnetic structure .",
    "the inflows excite coupled longitudinal and transverse oscillations in the loops in the initial ( impulsive ) phase that later damp primarily through leakage as the loops reach the new steady state with background flow .",
    "the fundamental standing slow mode waves are seen to form in short and long loops in agreement with past observations and models discussed above .",
    "the fast magnetosonic waves induced by the inflow and nonlinearity are detected as well . in short loops with steady inflow in low-@xmath31 regions of the ar the properties of the oscillations ( period , wavelength , damping rate ) , depend on loop length , and curvature of the magnetic structure in qualitative agreement with previous studies of waves in loops without background flow @xcite .",
    "we also find that the flows produce impulsively nonlinear fast mode waves in the loops .",
    "we investigate the effects of quasi - periodic flow injection in the localized region at lower coronal boundary , and find that driven undamped oscillations are produced in the magnetic loop of the bipolar ar s . as a result , the average density of the loops increases as well in this case .",
    "the period , amplitude , and damping rate of the driven oscillations are determined primarily by the properties of the driving periodic flows such as their period and amplitude , and the nonlinear interaction with the loop structure . in hot and long loops",
    "the quasi - periodic inflows with subsonic magnitude at the lower boundary can produce shock - like nonlinear compressive disturbances that propagate obliquely to the magnetic loop direction .",
    "we conclude that , a way to determine whether the observed loop oscillations result from slow waves or quasi - periodic flows is to evaluate the relation between the oscillation properties such as period , phase speed , phase relations , damping time , and the various loop parameters such as loop length , density , temperature , and magnetic field structure , since these relations are different for waves and for quasi - periodic flows as demonstrated in our study .",
    "the presence of the temporal damping of the oscillations on the time scale shorter than the decay time of the flow ( as in the case of steady inflow ) supports the wave interpretation of the observed oscillations . in the case of periodic inflow",
    "studied here the oscillations do not exhibit damping .",
    "we conclude that the excitation of slow - mode ( and some transverse ) oscillations and flows observed with sumer , trace , hinode , and recently with sdo in coronal loops may result from the impulsive flow injection of plasma at the corona - chromosphere interface at the footpoints of the coronal ar loops .",
    "thus , our study suggests that flows and waves in coronal loops may result of the same impulsive events that drive these phenomena .",
