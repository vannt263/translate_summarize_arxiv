    "this property allows us to achieve objectives ( o1 ) and ( o2 ) by using sses , without serious difficulties and without assumptions involving invariant sets for @xmath105 .",

    "therefore ( [ i1 ] ) leads directly to objective ( o1 ) since @xmath118 .",

    "this reduces objective ( o2 ) to prove that there exists an invariant probability measure for ( [ 2 ] ) , different from the dirac measure at @xmath122 , which is a difficult problem .",
    "we instead use ( [ i9 ] ) . under a weak version of hypothesis ( l )",
    ", there exists an invariant probability measure @xmath123 for ( [ 5 ] ) such that @xmath124 and @xmath125 ; see @xcite .",
    "then , using ( [ i9 ] ) we deduce that @xmath126 is a stationary solution to ( [ 3 ] ) that belongs to @xmath127 ; see section  [ secstatsol ] .",
    "this is a step forward in the study of the long time behavior of unbounded observables .",

    "we next outline how to establish that @xmath114 is a solution of ( [ 3 ] ) .    applying it s formula we obtain @xmath130 with @xmath131 .",
    "since @xmath132 is a local martingale , we use stopping times and the dominated convergence theorem to deduce that @xmath133 define the operator @xmath134 to be @xmath135 we now face the major technical difficulties ; we have to prove that @xmath136 is a trace - class operator such that : ( i ) @xmath137 ; ( ii ) the function @xmath138 is locally bounded ; and ( iii ) @xmath139 is weakly continuous in @xmath98 .",
    "then , applying ( [ 65 ] ) yields @xmath140 where we understand the integral of ( [ i5 ] ) in the sense of the bochner integral in @xmath98 .",

    "<S> applying probabilistic techniques we study regularity properties of quantum master equations ( qmes ) in the lindblad form with unbounded coefficients ; a density operator is regular if , roughly speaking , it describes a quantum state with finite energy . using the linear stochastic schrdinger equation </S>",
    "<S> we deduce that solutions of qmes preserve the regularity of the initial states under a general nonexplosion condition . to this end </S>",
    "<S> , we develop the probabilistic representation of qmes , and we prove the uniqueness of solutions for adjoint quantum master equations . by means of the nonlinear stochastic schrdinger equation , we obtain the existence of regular stationary solutions for qmes , under a lyapunov - type condition .    .    . </S>"
