    "<S> below we demonstrate that both of these conclusions are incorrect .    </S>",
    "<S> \\a ) the first main claim contained in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite is that the approach by bsbahm is consistent with current experiments ( sec .  </S>",

    "<S> @xcite the opposite conclusion was drawn , namely that this approach is experimentally excluded . </S>",
    "<S> note that ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite contains the results of two experiments performed using a micromechanical torsional oscillator : a static measurement of the casimir force between a sphere and a plate , and a dynamic measurement of the effective casimir pressure between two plane parallel plates . </S>",
    "<S> the static measurement was less precise than the dynamic measurement over a wide separation range . </S>",
    "<S> the conclusion that the bsbahm approach is inconsistent with the experimental data in the separation region from @xmath0 nm to @xmath1 nm was made in ref .  </S>",

    "<S> @xcite are many times greater at short separations . ) from these two figures it becomes apparent that the bsbahm approach is excluded by experiment , whereas the impedance approach is consistent with experimental data .    </S>",

    "<S> @xcite discuss at length only the experiments of refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and the static measurement of refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these are at present not the most accurate , and were not used in the literature to exclude their approach . as to the dynamic measurement of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ( which contradicts the bsbahm approach ) , only a brief mention of this experiment is made at the end of sec .  </S>",
    "<S> iii , even though this is the most precise current measurement . </S>",
    "<S> ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite claims without proof that there are systematic theoretical and experimental uncertainties in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite connected , in particular , with a systematic shift of position as discussed earlier in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is easy to verify , however , that the reasoning of refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite is incapable of avoiding the conclusion of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite that the bsbahm approach is excluded experimentally . according to refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , even a small experimental error @xmath4 in separation distances between two parallel plates ( @xmath5 nm in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) leads to an error in the theoretical casimir pressure given by @xmath6 . at short separations </S>",
    "<S> this error may be rather large . at separations under consideration in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite it is , however , much less than the discrepancies between the bsbahm theory and experiment . </S>",
    "<S> thus , at the shortest separation @xmath0 nm , @xmath7mpa , which compares with the 5.5mpa mean deviation of the bsbahm prediction from experiment as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 12 of ref </S>",
    "<S> .  @xcite . at separations of @xmath8 , and 600 nm the above error is equal to 1.5 , 0.36 , 0.12 , and 0.05mpa , respectively , which should be compared with much larger mean deviations between the bsbahm approach and experiment at these separations ( 5 , 2 , 0.8 , and 0.4mpa , respectively ) . </S>",
    "<S> this demonstrates that the uncertainties in separations discussed in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite do not affect the conclusion of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite that the bsbahm approach is excluded experimentally .    note that even the comparison of the static experiment in sec .  </S>",
    "<S> iii of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite with the bsbahm approach is incorrect . </S>",
    "<S> only one point at a separation @xmath9 nm in fig .  3 of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite is considered . instead of using the original measured force values , ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite uses a maximum ( not a mean ) difference of 1pn between the theoretical ( as calculated in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite at zero temperature ) and experimental values of the force . </S>",
    "<S> the authors of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite explain this difference by the existence of a thermal correction equal to 1pn . </S>",
    "<S> they compare this 1pn with their predicted thermal correction of 2.56pn at @xmath9 nm and conclude that the result  is encouraging \" . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , however , they have a deviation of 1.56pn between their theory and the static measurement instead of a 1pn deviation between the traditional theory of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and the same measurement . ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , however , does not inform the reader that in a later publication @xcite the preliminary theoretical result of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite was recalculated using a more precise roughness correction ( this is clearly explained in the left column on p.2 of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> it was demonstrated that the static measurement of the casimir force @xmath10 is in fact in agreement with the theoretical values @xmath11 given by traditional theory with a more precise roughness correction ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus , if one removes this misunderstanding , ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite must reconcile the zero mean deviation between the traditional theory and static experiment ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1 ) with an extra 2.56pn thermal correction predicted by the bsbahm alternative approach . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to the evident failure of their approach .    </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the bsbahm theoretical approach disagrees significantly @xcite with the first modern measurement of the casimir force between au surfaces of a plate and a spherical lens by means of a torsion pendulum @xcite . in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite the experimental data were found to be consistent with the theoretical casimir force between ideal metals . a net deviation between the casimir forces at a temperature @xmath12k and at a separation @xmath13 m , computed for ideal metals and using the bsbahm approach , is about 25% of the casimir force between ideal metals ( recall that for ideal metals at @xmath13 m , @xmath12k the thermal correction is equal to only 1.2% of the zero - temperature force ) . </S>",
    "<S> of this deviation , 19% is due to the large thermal correction predicted by bsbahm . in spite of the fact that the experimental uncertainty in ref </S>",
    "<S> .  @xcite at 1@xmath14 m is less than 10% , the effect predicted by the bsbahm approach was not observed . </S>",
    "<S> no mention of this important experiment is made in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> quite recently the dynamic experiment of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite was repeated ( see ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) with many important improvements , including a significant suppression of the surface roughness on the interacting surfaces , and a decrease by a factor of 1.7 ( down to @xmath15 nm ) of the experimental error in the measurement of the absolute separations between the zero roughness levels . </S>",
    "<S> an improvement in detection sensitivity , together with a reduction of the coupling between the micromachined oscillator and the environment , yielded measurements at smaller separations between the test bodies ( 160 nm instead of 260 nm ) .    from the new results in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite the conclusion was drawn that the bsbahm approach to the thermal casimir force is excluded experimentally in the separation region from 170 nm to 700 nm at 95% confidence . in the separation region from 300 nm to 500 nm the bsbahm approach is excluded experimentally at even higher confidence of 99% @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> we illustrate these conclusions in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2a where the differences of the theoretical ( calculated in the bsbahm approach ) and experimental casimir pressures are plotted versus separation for 14 sets of measurements containing 4066 experimental points . </S>",
    "<S> by contrast , in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2b the same differences are plotted in the case that the theoretical casimir pressures are calculated using the impedance approach . in both figures </S>",
    "<S> the solid lines represent the 95% confidence interval for the differences between theoretical and experimental casimir pressures as a function of separation . </S>",
    "<S> it should be particularly emphasized that this confidence interval takes into account all experimental and theoretical errors , including in full measure the previously discussed error in the casimir pressures due to experimental errors in separation distances as suggested in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . the comparison of figs .  </S>",
    "<S> 2a , b clearly demonstrates that the bsbahm approach is excluded by the improved dynamic experiment measuring the casimir pressure , whereas the impedance approach is in excellent agreement with experiment . </S>",
    "<S> the traditional approach using the dielectric function of the plasma model is also consistent with the data ( see ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for more details ) .    </S>",
    "<S> thus , the authors @xcite approach is in contradiction not only with a dynamic experiment by means of a micromechanical oscillator @xcite and the torsion pendulum experiment @xcite ( which they leave out of their discussion ) , but also with a static experiment @xcite and an improved dynamic experiment @xcite which measure the casimir force and pressure , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> it should be emphasized that this conclusion can not be refuted by introducing an unaccounted systematic error in the measurement of the surface separation which might be present in the experiments of refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite in addition to the ones discussed above . </S>",
    "<S> the reason is that the influence of such an error ( if it existed ) decreases with an increase in separation whereas the contribution of the thermal correction , as predicted in the bsbahm approach , increases with separation at moderate separations . </S>",
    "<S> bearing in mind that the bsbahm approach significantly disagrees with experiment in a wide separation range for several different experiments , it is easy to check that no unaccounted fixed systematic error is capable of bringing this approach into agreement with data within the whole range of measurements . as an example , in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3 we present the pressure differences ( @xmath16 ) versus separation for one typical set of measurements where all separations are decreased by 1 nm as suggested recently in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . from fig .  3 it is clearly seen that such hypothetical systematic error is incapable of bringing the data into agreement with the bsbahm approach within a wide separation range from 240 nm to 700 nm . </S>",
    "<S> note also that the first version of preprint @xcite obtains slightly larger magnitudes of the casimir pressure than those computed in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite in the framework of the bsbahm approach . </S>",
    "<S> ( the greatest difference is at @xmath17 nm , @xmath12k where , according to ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , @xmath18mpa against 1125.5mpa in ref .  @xcite . ) </S>",
    "<S> the reason for this difference is that refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite used data for @xmath19 from the work of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the computations in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite contain an error in a conversion coefficient from ev to rad / s ( on p.313 , left column the value of @xmath20 is used instead of the correct value @xmath21 @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the computations of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite utilize @xcite slightly different values of the au plasma frequency and relaxation parameter [ @xmath22ev , @xmath23ev ] than were cited in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , and actually used in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite [ @xmath24ev , @xmath25ev ] . </S>",
    "<S> when both these changes are taken into account in the computations of refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , the result @xmath26mpa of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite is recovered . </S>",
    "<S> ( we note that the abovementioned error does not invalidate the computations of the reduction factors in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , which were performed up to only two significant figures . )    </S>",
    "<S> \\b ) the second main claim contained in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite is that the approach by bsbahm is consistent with thermodynamics . </S>",
    "<S> the calculations of @xcite are based on the lifshitz formula for the free energy of a fluctuating field @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the dielectric permittivites of au and cu at nonzero imaginary matsubara frequencies are taken from ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the contribution of the zero - frequency term is obtained by the substitution of the drude dielectric function along the imaginary frequency axis , @xmath27 } , \\label{eq1}\\ ] ] into the lifshitz formula . </S>",
    "<S> this substitution leads to an absence of the zero - frequency contribution of the transverse electric mode , and , in application to metals , results in a serious inconsistency with thermodymanics . </S>",
    "<S> the point is that for perfect lattices with no defects or impurities but with a nonzero relaxation @xmath28 and finite conductivity for nonzero @xmath29 , the bloch - grneisen law leads to @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> ( this important property for perfect lattices remains even when the effects of electron - electron collisions are included . ) as proven analytically in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , for such perfect lattices the approach by bsbahm leads to a nonzero entropy of a fluctuating field at zero temperature given by , @xmath31<0 , \\label{entropy}\\ ] ] which depends on the parameter of the system under consideration , i.e. , on the separation distance @xmath32 ( @xmath33 is the boltzmann constant ) .    in an attempt to avoid this serious problem , the authors of @xcite use a nonzero value of the drude relaxation parameter at zero temperature arising from the presence of impurities . </S>",
    "<S> they can then obtain in secs .  </S>",
    "<S> iia and iv a zero value of entropy at zero temperature ( a result obtained first by bostrm and sernelius @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> this , however , does not solve the inconsistency of the bsbahm approach with thermodynamics , as is claimed in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , because it is still violated for a perfect lattice having finite conductivity and nonzero relaxation at any @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> the unstated assumption of the authors is that perfect crystals with no defects or impurities do not exist and , therefore , that the laws of thermodynamics need not apply to them . </S>",
    "<S> this assumption is unphysical . </S>",
    "<S> nernst and planck formulated their famous theorem for the case of a perfect lattice which is truly an equilibrium system . </S>",
    "<S> later this theorem was proven in the framework of quantum statistical physics for any system with a nondegenerate dynamical state of lowest energy ( see , for instance , refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , it is valid for both perfect lattices and lattices with impurities . </S>",
    "<S> the violation of the nernst heat theorem for a perfect lattice would lead to the failure of the theory of electron - phonon interactions , and to the eventual abandonment of much of condensed matter physics , statistical physics and thermodynamics . </S>",
    "<S> for this reason the approach advocated by the authors is , in fact , in violation of thermodynamics .    </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the above serious problems , ref .   </S>",
    "<S> @xcite contains several misleading statements , including the following :    \\1 ) the authors discuss the so - called modified ideal metal model ( mim ) , but do not mention that it violates thermodynamics . </S>",
    "<S> namely , for the mim model the free energy in the case of two parallel plates [ eq .  ( 3.2 ) of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ] can be identically rearranged to the form @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the casimir free energy for the usual ideal metal @xcite , and @xmath37 is the riemann zeta function . by differentiating both sides of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq2 ] ) with respect to @xmath29 one obtains @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the entropies for the mim and i m , respectively . taking into account that for the usual ideal metal @xmath41 when @xmath42 @xcite , we come to the conclusion @xmath43 i.e. , the mim model violates the nernst heat theorem . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably the result for real metals obtained in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite coincides with that for mim ( which violates thermodynamics ) at large separations and does not coincide with the classical limit based on kirchhoff s law @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> \\2 ) in sec .  </S>",
    "<S> iv of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite it is claimed that  a transverse electric zero mode ... should not be present according to maxwell s equations of electromagnetism \" . </S>",
    "<S> this is not correct . </S>",
    "<S> maxwell s equations alone do not lead to a contribution of the transverse electric mode at zero frequency , unless they are supplemented by an adequate characterization of the material boundaries . </S>",
    "<S> more importantly , the characterization by means of the drude dielectric function , used in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , is inadequate to describe virtual photons .    </S>",
    "<S> \\3 ) in sec .  vi the authors repeat their argument of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite that the exact impedances , which depend on transverse momentum , lead to a zero contribution of the transverse electric mode to the casimir force , as does the drude dielectric function . ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite claims that refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , where the nonzero contribution to this mode was obtained , completely disregard the transverse momentum dependence . </S>",
    "<S> this , however , is incorrect . in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite the dependence of the impedance on a transverse momentum is considered in detail . as was demonstrated in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , this dependence disappears in the limit of zero frequency if the dispersion equation for the determination of photon proper frequencies is taken into account in the boundary conditions , and , as a consequence , the reflection properties of virtual photons on a classical boundary coincide with those of real photons . </S>",
