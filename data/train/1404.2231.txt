    "consider applying low - density parity - check ( ldpc ) codes for lossless ( or near lossless ) distributed joint source channel coding ( djscc ) with decoder side information , which is the most basic form of lossless djscc .",
    "lossless djscc has been intensively studied on the basis of distributed source coding ( dsc ) schemes recently .",
    "there are two dominating dsc schemes@xcite : syndrome - based approach and parity - based approach .",
    "the former can be straightforwardly implemented with ldpc coset codes , but it is hardly used for djscc @xcite . while , for the latter , it is difficult to implement efficient djscc with ldpc codes@xcite .    though difficult ,",
    "some efforts have already been made towards efficient djscc using ldpc codes with the parity - based approach , such as ira code@xcite , ldgm code@xcite , systematic raptor code@xcite , and non - systematic fountain code@xcite based schemes .",
    "however , the regular edge degree distribution restriction of these codes on parity variable nodes ( associated to parity bits ) has negative impacts on the design of optimal codes .",
    "a general ldpc code based scheme was reported in @xcite , but they only considered symmetrically correlated uniform sources and binary - input output - symmetric ( bios ) transmission channels and did not discuss the edge degree distribution optimization of ldpc codes .",
    "the design of ldpc codes for dsc with the parity - based approach was also studied in the literature , such as @xcite and @xcite etc .",
    "but they just focused on symmetrically correlated sources and can not be easily extended to djscc for asymmetric transmission channels .    in this paper",
    ", we consider the parity - based approach with general ldpc codes .",
    "we point out that the parity - based approach is a theoretical limit achievable scheme for djscc with decoder side information . in order to achieve good coding performance and low error floor ,",
    "different edge degree distributions are assigned to source variable nodes ( associated to source bits ) and parity variable nodes . moreover , since asymmetrically correlated nonuniform sources are more often encountered in practical applications and asymmetric physical channels are also observed in some scenarios , we present the codeword - averaged density evolution ( cade ) to analyze the asymptotic performance of ldpc codes for transmitting the asymmetrically correlated nonuniform sources over the asymmetric memoryless transmission channel .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec : problem_statement ] describes the equivalent channel coding model and shows that the parity - based approach is theoretical limit achievable .",
    "section [ sec : reg_code ] presents the cade formulas for ldpc codes .",
    "then , in section [ sec : simulation ] , we show experiment results . finally , the conclusion is given in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "let @xmath0 and @xmath1 be the outputs of two correlated i.i.d random sources .",
    "both @xmath0 and @xmath1 can be non - uniformly distributed .",
    "they have a joint probability mass function @xmath2 . here",
    ", @xmath3 denotes the alphabet ( can be nonbinary ) of @xmath1 and the lower case letters @xmath4 and @xmath5 denote the realizations of their respective random variables .",
    "let @xmath6 and @xmath7 denote the marginal probability mass functions of @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively . without loss of generality , we assume that @xmath1 is taken as decoder side information .    consider coding with the parity - based approach . a length @xmath8 source sequence , @xmath9 , is encoded with a systematic ldpc code specified by its @xmath10 generator matrix @xmath11,\\ ] ] where @xmath12 and @xmath13 is an identity matrix .",
    "the encoder generates a length @xmath14 codeword @xmath15 , and then , sends the length @xmath16 parity bits of @xmath17 , which is formed as @xmath18 , through a memoryless channel @xmath19 to a receiver . at the receiver side ,",
    "an ldpc decoder is employed to reconstruct the codeword .",
    "the decoder takes the sequence @xmath20 observed from @xmath19 as the parity bits of noise corrupted codeword @xmath21 and @xmath22 as the source bits of @xmath21 . by decoding @xmath21 , the decoder outputs the source bits @xmath23 of the codeword reconstruction",
    "here , @xmath23 is a different notation from @xmath24 due to the probable errors occurred in decoding .    from channel coding point of view , @xmath22 can be regarded as the observation of a correlation channel @xmath25 with the channel input @xmath24 .",
    "@xmath25 is determined by the conditional probability mass function @xmath26 between @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "therefore , the above coding approach is equivalent to channel coding for a virtual channel consisting of two parallel component channels , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : aswc_eqv_channel ] .",
    "although the focus of this paper is on the asymmetric @xmath19 and the asymmetric @xmath25 , the solution in this paper is also valid for the symmetric @xmath19 and the symmetric @xmath25 , as the symmetric channel is a special case of asymmetric channels .",
    "+    let @xmath27 and @xmath28 denote the channel capacities of @xmath25 and @xmath19 , respectively , and @xmath29 denote the coding rate of @xmath24 in bits .",
    "then , @xmath30 is bounded by @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the entropy of @xmath0 , @xmath33 is the conditional entropy , @xmath34 is the mutual information , and @xmath35 denotes the theoretical limit of coding rate .    for djscc of correlated binary memoryless sources with decoder side information ,",
    "@xmath35 can be achieved by systematic linear block codes with the parity - based approach .    to prove the theorem",
    ", we first consider a @xmath35-achieving separated source and channel coding scheme as follows .",
    "first , @xmath24 , @xmath36 , is compressed with a theoretical limit achieving ldpc coset code defined by a @xmath37 parity check matrix @xmath38 , i.e. @xmath39 , at the rate approaching @xmath33 , i.e. @xmath40 .",
    "then , the length @xmath41 sequence @xmath42 is encoded with a capacity - achieving ldpc code specified by an @xmath43 generator matrix @xmath44 , i.e. @xmath45 , at the channel coding rate approaching @xmath28 , i.e. @xmath46 .    since block codes",
    "are utilized in both steps of the above scheme , we can combine these two encoders into just a single encoder defined by @xmath47 .",
    "consequently , if we set @xmath48 in ( [ equ : gen_matrix ] ) as @xmath49 , by employing an optimal decoder , the parity - based approach with the systematic ldpc code defined by ( [ equ : gen_matrix ] ) is @xmath35-achieving due to the fact that we can , at least , recover @xmath24 with the decoders of the above separation coding scheme .",
    "intuitively , since @xmath25 and @xmath19 are different channels , it is better to allow different edge degree distributions for the source variable nodes and the parity variable nodes .",
    "let @xmath50 denote the ensemble of bipartite graphs with the edge degree distributions of source variable nodes , parity variable nodes and check nodes given by @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 , respectively .",
    "let @xmath54 be the set of edges in the bipartite graph .",
    "let also @xmath55 and @xmath56 be the sets of edges incident to the source variable nodes and to the parity variable nodes , respectively .",
    "define @xmath57 and @xmath58 , where @xmath59 denotes the cardinality of the set .",
    "then , we have @xmath60 where @xmath61 subject to @xmath62 and @xmath63 subject to @xmath64 are the fraction of edges emanating from the degree @xmath65 source variable nodes and the fraction of edges emanating from the degree @xmath65 parity variable nodes , respectively . the edge degree distribution of check nodes is defined in conventional form , i.e. @xmath66 where @xmath67 subject to @xmath68 denotes the fraction of edges emanating from the degree @xmath65 check nodes .",
    "since the all - zero codeword can not be assumed for density evolution in asymmetric channel setting , inspired by the work of @xcite for conventional channel coding , we average the density over all possible codewords to analyze the average asymptotic performance of the code ensemble for djscc with decoder side information .",
    "let @xmath69 or @xmath70 denote the message sent out of a source variable node @xmath71 or a parity variable node @xmath72 to a check node @xmath73 , respectively , and @xmath74 denote the message passed from @xmath73 to to a variable node @xmath75 ( @xmath75 can be either @xmath71 or @xmath76 . by @xmath77 and @xmath78 , @xmath79 ,",
    "we denote the codeword - averaged density of @xmath69 and @xmath70 at the @xmath80th iteration conditioned on that the corresponding variable bit takes value @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "we can easily write the update formulae of cade at the variable nodes as @xmath81 where @xmath82 denotes the codeword - averaged density of @xmath74 conditioned on that the corresponding destination variable bit takes value @xmath4 at the @xmath80th iteration .    to derive the update formula at the check nodes , we first consider the simplest case that each check node is connected to @xmath83 variable nodes . here",
    ", the edges connected to the source variable nodes and the edges connected to the parity variable nodes are not distinguished at the check node .",
    "hence , the probability of the bit associated to the variable nodes taking value @xmath4 ( denoted by @xmath84 ) is the weighted average of the probability of the source bits taking value @xmath4 ( denoted by @xmath85 ) and the probability of the parity bits taking value @xmath4 ( denoted by @xmath86 ) .",
    "it can be calculated by @xmath87 .",
    "accordingly , the density of the message sent from the variable node on a randomly selected edge should be a codeword - averaged density that can be obtained by @xmath88 .",
    "the difference between our work and @xcite for the update formula at the check node lies in that for the conventional channel coding that was considered in @xcite , the fraction of zeros in the typical codewords is assumed to be one - half , while , for the joint source channel coding that is considered in our work , the fraction of zeros in the typical codewords is equal to @xmath89 .",
    "let @xmath90 following from the definition in @xcite be the density transformation function .",
    "following the derivation of the equation ( 14 ) in @xcite and taking such a difference into account , we can derive the update formula of cade at the check node as follows .",
    "@xmath91 where @xmath92 is a normalization factor brought in by codeword averaging and @xmath93 is even@xmath94 denotes the set of even admissible degree values . for brevity ,",
    "let us define @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "then , ( [ equ : insertproof1 ] ) can be simplified as @xmath97    regarding the general case that the edge degree distribution of check nodes follows from ( [ equ : rho_poly ] ) , ( [ equ : insertproof2 ] ) can be straightforwardly generalized as @xmath98      in fact , the equivalent channel coding model is similar to a particular setting of the channel coding for parallel channels described in @xcite , i.e. only two component channels , except for the nonuniform source and asymmetric component channels .",
    "owing to the fact that part of the irregularity for the codes is achieved by incorporating the channel nonuniformity into the ensemble definition and more information is available in code design , we can expect that @xmath50 can achieve good coding performance and low error floor with fewer and smaller edge degrees .",
    "furthermore , by choosing both @xmath51 and @xmath52 equivalent , we can obtain a conventional ldpc code ensemble .",
    "thus , in all circumstances , the performance of the codes obtained from @xmath99 is at least as good as the codes obtained from the conventional code ensemble .    unlike other parameters determined by application settings , the value of @xmath100 is manually selected for cade .",
    "a reasonable choice is to assume @xmath101 for cade in practical applications , although it is possible to construct ldpc codes with @xmath102 . from the channel coding point of view",
    ", the assumption of @xmath101 has quite small impact on the performance assessment of capacity approaching codes , because even for asymmetric transmission channels , the mutual information for the uniformly distributed input is very close to @xmath28@xcite .",
    "thus , we can replace @xmath28 in ( [ inequ : compr_rate_channel_real_low_bd ] ) with the mutual information for the uniformly distributed input to obtain a good approximation of @xmath35 , which is denoted by @xmath103 .",
    "the binary asymmetric channel ( basc ) and non - uniformly distributed binary memoryless sources were considered for simulations . for convenience , we assume that @xmath1 also takes value in @xmath104 . in general , the correlation between @xmath0 and @xmath1 can be described by @xmath105 and @xmath106 , which can be interpreted as the transition probabilities of a basc as well . here , @xmath107 $ ] and @xmath108 $ ] .    in all cade simulations , we assume that @xmath101 . for all finite - length code simulations , the codes with @xmath109 are used and constructed by randomly selecting the bipartite graphs from code ensembles . the belief propagation algorithm with a maximum iteration of @xmath110",
    "is adopted for decoding and more than @xmath111 codewords are transmitted for each simulation .",
    "irregular code @xmath112 with @xmath113 is optimized for the setting of @xmath114 , @xmath101 , @xmath25 with @xmath115 , and @xmath19 with @xmath116 and @xmath117 , where @xmath118 and @xmath119 .",
    "first , two sets of degrees , each of which consists of two degrees , with a maximum degree of @xmath120 are selected for the source variable nodes and the parity variable nodes . then , we optimize the degree distributions by using differential evolution@xcite in conjunction with the cade . to simplify the code design ,",
    "we restrict the edge degrees of check nodes to two consecutive integer values .",
    "the code ensemble of @xmath112 is given by @xmath121    from fig .",
    "[ fig : pe_pe ] , we can observe that @xmath103 is close to @xmath35 for all @xmath122s .     for binary correlated nonuniform sources with @xmath114 and @xmath19 with @xmath116 and @xmath117 .",
    "the maximum and minimum gaps between the asymptotic thresholds of @xmath112 and the corresponding @xmath35s are @xmath123 bits and @xmath124 bits , respectively . ]",
    "this phenomenon demonstrates that @xmath101 is an appropriate choice for practical applications .",
    "also , the similar coding performances are exhibited for various correlation settings , though @xmath112 is merely optimized for one setting .",
    "this can be attributed to the fact that each binary input asymmetric output correlation channel is equivalent to a bios channel@xcite and the coding performances of ldpc codes for the bios channels with the same channel capacities are rather close .    from fig .",
    "[ fig : ber_finit ] , we can observe that the waterfall portions of the ber curves of finite length codes are quite close to their respective asymptotic thresholds obtained by the cade .    in our simulations ,",
    "if the bit - error rate ( ber ) is less than @xmath125 , a commonly used criterion@xcite , the transmission is assumed to be near lossless .",
    "the maximum gap of the near lossless thresholds of @xmath112 in fig .",
    "[ fig : ber_finit ] from the theoretical limits is @xmath126bits and no error - floor is observed in our simulations .",
    "compared with the work of @xcite on asymmetric dsc , where the gaps from the theoretical limits are in between @xmath127 and @xmath128 for the source with @xmath129 $ ] , the experiment results show that even with shorter codewords and for the asymmetric transmission channel , the better performance can be easily achieved by optimizing the edge degree distributions than by designing sophisticated coding scheme .    to demonstrate the merit of the ensemble @xmath50 , irregular code @xmath130 with @xmath131 is designed for the setting of @xmath114 , @xmath101 , @xmath25 with @xmath115 and @xmath132 , and @xmath19 with @xmath117 . for @xmath130 , a higher degree is allowed for parity variable nodes due to the worse transmission channel .",
    "the code ensemble of @xmath130 is given by @xmath133 let @xmath134 be the corresponding conventional ldpc codes of @xmath130 .",
    "the edge degree distribution of the variable nodes of @xmath134 is given by @xmath135 as we can see from fig .",

    "the parity - based approach is theoretical limit achievable .",
