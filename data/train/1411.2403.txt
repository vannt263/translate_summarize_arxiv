    "we derive an analytical semiclassical trace formula for the level density of the hh potential , employing the improved stationary phase method ( ispm ) @xcite valid for arbitrarily dense sequences of pitchfork bifurcations near the saddle - point energy and for harmonic - oscillator symmetry breaking in the limit of small energies . in this respect ,",

    "we should note that this procedure is not unique .",
    "strictly mathematically , the reduction of the full @xmath27 ( 2 ) to any desired normal form by means of canonical transformations is generally not possible because , according to arnold @xcite , `` formal series for canonical transformations reducing a system to normal form generally _ diverge _ '' .",
    "on the other hand , within the ispm , we use as `` normal forms '' equation ( [ genfunact ] ) for the generating function with expansion ( [ genfunexp ] ) near the stationary points rather than near the bifurcations . a similarity to the normal form theory",
    "is manifested if we put formally @xmath79 , @xmath80 in ( [ genfunexp ] ) in the system of coordinates related to the bifucation point reducing the non - local ispm to its local approximation valid nearly the bifurcation points . moreover , from a more pragmatic point of view , the details of the required canonical transformation do not matter for the spm approximation in narrow regions of phase space around the critical points , i.e. , in the limit @xmath81 which in practice corresponds to large particle numbers @xmath82 through the fermi energy @xmath83 at a rather small parameter @xmath53 and larger averaging width @xmath84 of the gross shell structure .",

    ", the isolated trajectories are transformed into the degenerate families of the periodic orbits .",
    "expressions found from ( [ dgscl ] ) locally for the separate bifurcations of the @xmath85 or @xmath86 orbits are in agreement with the results @xcite obtained using the standard normal forms for the pitchfork bifurcations . however , for the full cascade of bifurcations near the saddle energy of the hh potential , our result ( [ dgscl ] ) goes beyond the normal - form theory .",
    "it is a continuous function through all bifurcation points near the saddle energy and also down to the limit to the symmetry - breaking point at @xmath60 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath87 and @xmath88 in ( [ amphh ] ) are also continuous functions of the energy @xmath35 through all stationary points ( pos ) . note also that our ispm expression ( [ dgscl ] ) for the shell correction to the level density is a sum of separate contributions of all involved pos , and a coarse - graining over the energy @xmath89 ( cf .  below )",
    "may therefore be performed analytically .",
    "thus , one has a possibility to study analytically both gross and fine shell structures .",
    "this is in contrast to the results @xcite using uniform approximations based on the normal - form theory @xcite , where at each critical point all involved pos give one common contribution .",

    "[ fig3 ] shows the modulus of the amplitude factor @xmath91 ( [ amphh ] ) as function of @xmath92 .",
    "as seen from this figure , there is a typical enhancement of the amplitude @xmath91 near the bifurcation point @xmath93 .",
    "the ispm amplitude factor ( [ amphh ] ) has a finite value at the bifurcation point @xmath94 and converges to the gutzwiller sspm asymptotics ( @xmath95 ) rather rapidly for @xmath96 .",
    "as usual , one can see the characteristic `` ghost '' oscillations at negative @xmath65 which do not contribute into the semiclassical level density .    for the purpose of studying the improved level density around the bifurcation points ,",
    "we consider a slightly averaged level density , thus avoiding the convergence problems that usually arise when one is interested in a full semiclassical quantization .",
    "such a `` coarse - graining '' can be done by folding the level density over a gaussian of width @xmath84 @xcite .",
    "( the particular choice of a gaussian form of the averaging function is immaterial and guided only by mathematical simplicity . )",
    "applying this procedure to the semiclassical level density ( [ dgscl ] ) , one gets @xcite @xmath97 the averaging of the oscillating level density yields an exponential decrease of the amplitudes with increasing periods @xmath98 and/or @xmath99 .",
    "as shown in @xcite , for @xmath84 about 1/3 ( in @xmath100 units ) , all large - action paths are strongly damped and only the time - shortest pos contribute to the oscillating part of the level density , yielding its gross - shell structure . for a study of the bifurcation phenomenon , however , we need smaller values of @xmath84 . in figs .",
    "[ fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] we used the coarse - grained gutzwiller trace formula ( [ gutz],[dgsclgamma ] ) including the simplest primitive orbits @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "it is interesting that the gross - shell structure manifests itself for the hh parameter @xmath103 even for a relatively small averaging parameter @xmath104 .",
    "therefore , we should expect also a good agreement between semiclassical and quantum results for the energy shell corrections @xmath105 as functions of the particle numbers @xmath106 for the same @xmath103 for larger energies ( but still far enough from the bifurcation points , cf .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) .    the shell - correction energy @xmath105 , i.e. , the oscillating part of the total energy @xmath107 of a system of @xmath82 fermions occupying the lowest quantum levels in a given potential ,            can be expressed in terms of the oscillating components @xmath108 at the fermi energy @xmath109 of the semiclassical level density , [ gesclsum ] g_sc(e)=_po g_sc^po(e ) , as  @xcite [ descl1 ] u = 2_po ( ) ^2 g_sc^po(e_f ) .",
    "here , @xmath98 is the time of the motion along the po including its repetitions at @xmath109 , @xmath110 ( @xmath111 is the repetition number ) .",
    "we are taking into account the spin degeneracy factor 2 in ( [ descl1 ] ) .",
    "the semiclassical representation of the shell - correction energy ( [ descl1 ] ) differs from that of @xmath112 ( [ gesclsum ] ) ( at @xmath113 ) only by a factor @xmath114 under the sum , which suppresses contributions from orbits of larger time periods ( actions ) .",
    "thus the periodic orbits with smaller periods play a dominant role in determining the shell - correction energy @xcite .",
    "finally , we should note that the higher the degeneracy of an orbit , the larger the volume occupied by the orbit family in the phase space , and also the smaller its time period ( action ) , the more important is its contribution to the level density .",
    "[ fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] show a rather good agreement between the semiclassical and quantum results , in spite of using only the three shortest orbits @xmath115 , @xmath116 ( @xmath117 ) , and @xmath118 ( c ) .",
    "these are seen to yield the correct gross - shell structure for the parameter @xmath103 and widths for the gaussian averaging @xmath119 ( or , similarly , for @xmath120 ) in the energy region below the saddle ( @xmath121 ) and above the bottom ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "the discrepancies at smaller energies are related to the symmetry breaking at @xmath60 , as discussed above , and will be removed when using our full ispm trace formula ( [ dgscl ] ) . in the quantum - mechanical determination of @xmath105 ( see ch .  4.7 of @xcite and @xcite for discussions of the strutinsky averaging method ) , the plateau condition for the averaged energy was satisfied for a gaussian width @xmath122 and a curvature correction parameter @xmath123 .",
    "we have obtained an analytical trace formula for the oscillating part of the level density in hnon - helies hamiltonian as a sum over periodic orbits .",
    "it is continuous through all critical points , in particular here the harmonic oscillator limit at zero energy and the cascade of pitchfork bifurcations near the saddle energy .",
    "we find an enhancement of the semiclassical amplitudes near the most critical points .",
    "the numerical agreement with quantum results is rather good , in spite of a rather simple uniform ispm approximation including only the simplest primitive periodic orbits . the quantum - classical correspondence for the chaos - order transitions is shown through the poincar surface of sections in the limit from the non - integrable region of the energies to the symmetry breaking point .",
    "our semiclassical analysis may therefore lead to a deeper understanding of the shell structure effects in finite fermionic systems such as nuclei , metal clusters or semiconductor quantum dots whose conductance and magnetic susceptibilities are significantly modified by shell effects ( see @xcite for examples ) .",
