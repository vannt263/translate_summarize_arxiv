    "the eliashberg s theory of superconductivity represents an elegant and powerful formalism to extend the bcs theory to real materials .",
    "main achievements of the eliashberg s theory are the generalization of the bcs scheme to the strong coupling regime , where the dimensionless electron - phonon coupling constant @xmath0 can be of the order or larger than unit , @xmath4 , and the inclusion of the retarded nature of the electron - phonon interaction , characterized by the phonon energy scale @xmath5.@xcite within this framework it was possible to understand and predict a number of characteristic features of the strong coupling regime , as a @xmath6 ratio larger than the bcs limit , the temperature dependence of the magnetic critical field and of the specific heat , the appearance of phonon features for @xmath7 in the tunneling and in the optical spectra.@xcite some results of the eliashberg theory have become widely used paradigmatic milestones , as for instance the employment of mcmillan - like formulas , @xmath8 $ ] , to estimate the critical temperature and its dependence on the microscopic interaction in generic superconductors.@xcite the strong - coupling limit @xmath3 , @xmath9 of the eliashberg s theory has also been examined in details , showing a drastic change of the superconducting properties , with , for instance , @xmath3 , @xmath10.@xcite    different evolutions of the eliashberg s theory have also been later introduced in the course of years to adapt it to the particular cases of specific materials .",
    "multiband effects,@xcite anisotropy and non @xmath11-wave symmetries of the order parameter,@xcite effect of vertex corrections@xcite have been for instance considered . in all these cases",
    "one should consider in principle the possibility that the electron - phonon coupling ( or any kind of other mediator ) can be substantially different in the self - energy and in the superconducting cooper channels .",
    "this is most evident in the case of @xmath1-wave pairing .",
    "for example , if we assume a factorized interaction , @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the generic anisotropic eliashberg s function , and @xmath14 is the wave - function for the @xmath1-wave symmetry , we would get no contribution in the self - energy .",
    "this is expected for instance in the case of a spin - mediated coupling where the exchange energy @xmath15 is factorizable as @xmath16,@xcite and the characteristic energy scale of the pairing , @xmath17 , is given by the spin - fluctuation spectrum .",
    "of course this is an extreme limit , and in real systems there will be finite contributions in both the self - energy and the cooper channels , although in principle arising from different electron - boson modes . in any case , there is no reason to expect that the electron - phonon coupling @xmath18 relevant for the @xmath19 renormalization wave - function to be the same as the one @xmath20 ruling the gap equation .    in this paper",
    "we investigate in details the consequence of a different coupling in the @xmath19 wave - function and in the gap equations .",
    "we define this situation as `` unbalanced '' eliashberg theory .",
    "we focus here on thermodynamical quantities which can be evaluated in the matsubara space .",
    "spectral properties , involving analytical continuation on the real axis , will be investigated in a future publication .",
    "we show that , contrary to the common feeling , an unbalanced coupling in the eliashberg s theory has important and drastic differences with respect to the conventional eliashberg phenomenology . in particular we show that for @xmath21 the superconducting critical temperature @xmath3 is strongly enhanced for finite values of @xmath22 , and in the infinite bandwidth limit @xmath3 even diverges .",
    "we also show that these new features are strictly related to the retarded nature of any boson interaction , accounting for the fact that this phenomenology was never discussed in the case of the non - retarded bcs theory .",
    "let us start by consider the eliashberg s equations for the simple representative case of an einstein boson spectrum . to simplify the notations , we define @xmath23 the ratio between the electron - boson coupling in the @xmath24 and in the gap equations , and we simply denote @xmath25 . in the matsubara space",
