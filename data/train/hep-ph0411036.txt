    "the introduction of unitarity constraints in coupled channels in chiral perturbation theory has led to unitary extensions of the theory that starting from the same effective lagrangians allow one to make predictions at much higher energies .",
    "one of the interesting consequences of these extensions is that they generate dynamically low lying resonances , both in the mesonic and baryonic sectors . by this",
    "we mean that they are generated by the multiple scattering of the meson or baryon components , much the same as the deuteron is generated by the interaction of the nucleons through the action of a potential , and they are not preexistent states that remain in the large @xmath5 limit where the multiple scattering is suppressed .    starting from the chiral lagrangians for the interaction of the octets of meson and baryon @xcite and using the n / d method to obtain a scattering matrix fulfilling exactly unitarity in coupled channels @xcite , the full set of transition matrix elements with the coupled channels is given in matrix form by    @xmath6^{-1}\\ , v~. \\label{eq : bs1}\\ ] ]    here , the matrix @xmath7 , obtained from the lowest order meson  baryon chiral lagrangian , contains the weinberg - tomozawa or seagull contribution , as employed e.g. in ref .",
    "@xcite ,    @xmath8    for strangeness @xmath1 the @xmath9 coefficients are given in ref .",
    "@xcite , and an averaged meson decay constant @xmath10 is used @xcite , with @xmath11mev the weak pion decay constant .",
    "the diagonal matrix @xmath12 stands for the loop function of a meson and a baryon and is defined by a subtracted dispersion relation in terms of phase space with a cut starting at the corresponding threshold @xcite .",
    "it corresponds to the loop function of a meson and a baryon once the logarithmic divergent constant is removed .",
    "the analytical properties of @xmath12 are properly kept when evaluating the previous loop function in dimensional regularization and an explicit subtraction constant,@xmath13 , appears in the expression .",
    "this meson baryon loop function was calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite with a cut - off regularization .",
    "the values of the @xmath14 constants are found to be around @xmath15 to agree with the results of the cut  off method for cut  off values of the order of the mass of the @xmath16 @xcite , which we call of natural size .",
    "the study of ref .",
    "@xcite showed the presence of poles in eq .",
    "( [ eq : bs1 ] ) around the @xmath2 and the @xmath17 for isospin @xmath18 and around the @xmath19 in @xmath20 . the same approach in @xmath21 leads to the resonance @xmath22 @xcite and in @xmath23 to the @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "one is thus tempted to consider the appearance of a singlet and an octet of meson  baryon resonances . nevertheless , the situation is more complicated because indeed in the su(3 ) limit there are _ two _ octets and not just one , as we discuss below .",
    "the presence of these multiplets was already discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite after obtaining a pole with @xmath1 in the @xmath20 channel , with mass around 1430 mev , and two poles with @xmath18 , of masses around that of the @xmath2 .",
    "the appearance of a multiplet of dynamically generated mesons and baryons seems most natural once a state of the multiplet appears .",
    "indeed , one must recall that the chiral lagrangians are obtained from the combination of the octet of pseudoscalar mesons ( the pions and partners ) and the octet of stable baryons ( the nucleons and partners ) .",
    "the su(3 ) decomposition of the combination of two octets tells us that @xmath25 thus , on pure su(3 ) grounds , should we have a su(3 ) symmetric lagrangian , one can expect e.g. one singlet and two octets of resonances , the symmetric and antisymmetric ones .    the lowest order of the meson  baryon chiral lagrangian is exactly su(3 ) invariant if all the masses of the mesons , or equivalently the quark masses , are set equal . as stated above [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq : ampl2 ] ) ] , in ref .  @xcite the baryon masses take their physical values , although strictly speaking at the leading order in the chiral expansion they should be equal to @xmath26 . for eq .",
    "( [ eq : ampl2 ] ) being su(3 ) symmetric , all the baryons masses @xmath27 must be set equal as well . when all the meson and baryon masses are equal , and these common masses are employed in evaluating the @xmath28 functions , together with equal subtraction constants @xmath29 , the @xmath30matrix obtained from eq .",
    "( [ eq : bs1 ] ) is also su(3 ) symmetric .",
    "if we do such an su(3 ) symmetry approximation and look for poles of the scattering matrix , we find poles corresponding to the octets and singlet .",
    "the surprising result is that the two octet poles are degenerate as a consequence of the dynamics contained in the chiral lagrangians . indeed ,",
    "if we evaluate the matrix elements of the transition potential @xmath7 in a basis of su(3 ) states , we obtain something proportional to @xmath31 taking the following order for the irreducible representations : @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 , with positive sign meaning attraction .",
    "hence we observe that the states belonging to different irreducible representations do not mix and the two octets appear degenerate .",
    "the coefficients in @xmath38 clearly illustrate why there are no bound states in the @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 representations .    in practice ,",
    "the same chiral lagrangians allow for su(3 ) breaking . in the case of refs .",
    "@xcite the breaking appears because both in the @xmath39 transition potentials as in the @xmath28 loop functions one uses the physical masses of the particles as well as different subtraction constants in @xmath28 , corresponding to the use of a unique cut - off in all channels . in ref .",
    "@xcite the physical masses are also used in the @xmath28 functions , although these functions are evaluated with a unique subtraction constant as corresponds to the su(3 ) limit . in both approaches ,",
    "physical masses are used to evaluate the @xmath28 loop functions so that unitarity is fulfilled exactly and the physical thresholds for all channels are respected .    by following the approach of ref .",
    "@xcite and using the physical masses of the baryons and the mesons , the position of the poles change and the two octets split apart in four branches , two for @xmath18 and two for @xmath20 , as one can see in fig .",
    "[ fig : tracepole ] . in the figure",
    "we show the trajectories of the poles as a function of a parameter @xmath40 that breaks gradually the su(3 ) symmetry up to the physical values .",
    "the dependence of masses and subtraction constants on the parameter @xmath40 is given by @xmath41 where @xmath42 . in the calculation of fig .",
    "[ fig : tracepole ] , the values @xmath43 mev , @xmath44 mev and @xmath45 are used .",
    "the complex poles , @xmath46 , appear in unphysical sheets . in the present search",
    "we follow the strategy of changing the sign of the momentum @xmath47 in the @xmath48 loop function for the channels which are open at an energy equal to re(@xmath49 ) .",
    "the splitting of the two @xmath18 octet states is very interesting .",
    "one moves to higher energies to merge with the @xmath17 resonance and the other one moves to lower energies to create a pole , quite well identified below the @xmath50 threshold , with a narrow width . on the other hand",
    ", the singlet also evolves to produce a pole at low energies with a quite large width .",
    "we note that the singlet and the @xmath18 octet states appear nearby in energy and what experiments actually see is a combination of the effect of these two resonances .",
    "similarly as for the @xmath18 octet states , we can see that one branch of the @xmath20 states moves to higher energies while another moves to lower energies .",
    "the branch moving to higher energies finishes at what would correspond to the @xmath19 resonance when the physical masses are reached .",
    "the branch moving to lower energies fades away after a while when getting close to the @xmath50 threshold .    the model of ref .",
    "@xcite reproduces qualitatively the same results , but the @xmath20 pole also stays for @xmath51 .",
    "nevertheless , in both approaches there is an @xmath20 amplitude with an enhanced strength around the @xmath52 threshold .",
    "this amplitude has non negligible consequences for reactions producing @xmath53 pairs in that region .",
    "this has been illustrated for instance in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the photoproduction of the @xmath2 via the reaction @xmath54 was studied .",
    "it was shown there that the different sign in the @xmath20 component of the @xmath55 , @xmath56 states leads , through interference between the @xmath20 and the dominant @xmath18 amplitudes , to different cross sections in the various charge channels , a fact that has been confirmed experimentally very recently @xcite .",
    "once the pole positions are found , one can also determine the couplings of these resonances to the physical states by studying the amplitudes close to the pole and identifying them with @xmath57 the couplings @xmath58 are in general complex valued numbers .",
    "in the table we summarize the pole positions and the complex couplings @xmath58 obtained from the model of ref .",
    "@xcite for isospin @xmath18 .",
    "the results with the model of @xcite are qualitatively similar .",
    ".pole positions and couplings to @xmath18 physical states from the model of ref .",
    "@xcite [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : jido0 ]    we observe that the second resonance with @xmath18 couples strongly to @xmath52 channel , while the first resonance couples more strongly to @xmath53 .",
    "in a given reaction the @xmath2 resonance is always seen in @xmath53 mass distribution .",
    "however , the @xmath2 can be produced through any of the channels in the table .",
    "hence , it is clear that , should there be a reaction which forces this initial channel to be @xmath50 , then this would give more weight to the second resonance , @xmath59 , and hence produce a distribution with a shape corresponding to an effective resonance narrower than the nominal one and at higher energy .",
    "such a case indeed occurs in the reaction @xmath60 studied theoretically in ref .",
    "it was shown there that since the @xmath61 system has a larger energy than the resonance , one has to lose energy emitting a photon prior to the creation of the resonance and this is effectively done by the bremsstrahlung from the original @xmath62 or the proton .",
    "hence the resonance is initiated from the @xmath61 channel .",
    "this is also the case in the reaction @xmath63 which has also the @xmath2 initiated by @xmath52 through the vertex @xmath64 @xcite .",
    "given the success of the chiral unitary approach in generating dynamically low energy resonances from the interaction of the octets of stable baryons and the pseudoscalar mesons , in @xcite the interaction of the decuplet of @xmath65 with the octet of pseudoscalar mesons was studied and shown to lead to many states which were associated to experimentally well established @xmath66 resonances .",
    "the lowest order chiral lagrangian for the interaction of the baryon decuplet with the octet of pseudoscalar mesons is given by @xcite @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the spin decuplet field and @xmath69 the covariant derivative given by in @xcite .",
    "the identification of the physical decuplet states with the @xmath68 can be seen in @xcite , where a detailed study of this interaction and the resonances generated can be seen .",
    "the study is done along the lines of the former sections , looking for poles in the second riemann sheet of the complex plane , the coupling of the resonances to the different channels and the stability of the results with respect to variations of the input parameter , which in our case is just the subtraction constant , a .",
    "this allows the association of the resonances found to existing states of the particle data book , and the prediction of new ones .",
    "a detail of the results obtained can be seen in fig .",
    "2 .    another interesting result is the generation of an exotic state of @xmath3 and @xmath20 which is generated by the interaction of the @xmath70 channels and stands as a @xmath4 resonance .",
    "the pole appears in a riemann sheet below threshold when also the sign of the momentum is changed , but it leads to a @xmath70 amplitude which accumulates strength close to threshold and produces a broad peak in the cross section , see fig.3 , in contrast to the @xmath71 cross section which is much smaller and very smooth .    in order to investigate this interaction",
    "we propose the study of the following reactions : 1 ) @xmath72 , 2 ) @xmath73 , 3 ) @xmath74 . in the first case the @xmath75 state produced",
    "has necessarily @xmath20 . in the second case",
    "the @xmath76 state has @xmath71 . in the third case",
    "the @xmath77 state has mostly an @xmath20 component .",
    "the study of the @xmath4 invariant mass distribution in these reactions would provide experimental information to eventually prove the prediction made here , and thus giving support to this new exotic baryonic state , which , although in the quark model would require at least five quarks and could qualify as a pentaquark , finds a much simpler interpretation as a resonant @xmath4 state .     for @xmath20,width=377 ]",
