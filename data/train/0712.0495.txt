    "the observations of grb 060614 ( @xcite ) challenged the standard grb classification scheme ( @xcite ) in which the gamma events are branched into two classes : `` short '' grbs ( events which last less than @xmath0s ) and `` long '' grbs ( events which last more than @xmath0s ) .",
    "grb 060614 , indeed , `` reveals a first short , hard - spectrum episode of emission ( lasting @xmath1 s ) followed by an extended and somewhat softer episode ( lasting @xmath2 s ) '' : a `` two - component emission structure '' ( @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , stringent upper limits on the luminosity of the supernova possibly associated with grb 060614 have been established ( @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite concluded that `` it is difficult to determine unambiguously which category grb 060614 falls into '' and that , then , grb 060614 , due to its `` hybrid '' observational properties , `` opens the door on a new grb classification scheme that straddles both long and short bursts '' ( @xcite ) .",
    "these observations motivated @xcite to reanalyze the batse catalog identifying a new grb class with `` an occasional softer extended emission lasting tenths of seconds after an initial spikelike emission '' ( @xcite ) . in some cases , `` the strength of the extended emission converts an otherwise short burst into one with a duration that can be tens of seconds , making it appear to be a long burst '' ( @xcite ) .",
    "hence , @xcite suggested that the standard `` long - short '' grb classification scheme `` is at best misleading '' ( @xcite ) .    in the following",
    ", we are going to outline our `` canonical grb '' scenario ( @xcite ) , where all grbs are generated by the same `` engine '' : the gravitational collapse to a black hole .",
    "we will show that such `` hybrid '' sources are indeed explainable in terms of a peculiarly small average value of the circumburst medium ( cbm ) density , compatible with a galactic halo environment ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we assume that all grbs , including the `` short '' ones , originate from the gravitational collapse to a black hole ( @xcite ) .",
    "the @xmath3 plasma created in the process of the black hole formation expands as an optically thick and spherically symmetric `` fireshell '' with a constant width in the laboratory frame , i.e. the frame in which the black hole is at rest .",
    "we have only two free parameters characterizing the source , namely :    * @xmath4 : the total energy of the @xmath3 plasma , * @xmath5 : the @xmath3 plasma baryon loading ,    where @xmath6 is the total baryons mass ( @xcite ) .",
    "these two parameters fully determine the optically thick acceleration phase of the fireshell , which lasts until the transparency condition is reached and the proper - grb ( p - grb ) is emitted ( @xcite ) .",
    "the afterglow emission then starts due to the collision between the remaining optically thin fireshell and the cbm ( @xcite .",
    "it clearly depends on the parameters describing the effective cbm distribution :    * @xmath7 : its density , * @xmath8 : its filamentary structure ,    where @xmath9 is the effective emitting area of the fireshell and @xmath10 is its total visible area ( @xcite ) .",
    "unlike treatments in the current literature ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) , we define a `` canonical grb '' light curve with two sharply different components ( see fig . [ 991216_fig ] and @xcite ) :    1 .   * the p - grb : * it has the imprint of the black hole formation , an harder spectrum and no spectral lag ( @xcite ) .",
    "the afterglow : * it presents a clear hard - to - soft behavior ( @xcite ) ; the peak of the afterglow contributes to what is usually called the `` prompt emission '' ( see e.g.@xcite ) .     and @xmath11 particles/@xmath12 .",
    "details in @xcite . ]",
    "the ratio between the total time - integrated luminosity of the p - grb ( namely , its total energy ) and the corresponding one of the afterglow is the crucial quantity for the identification of grbs nature .",
    "such a ratio , as well as the temporal separation between the corresponding peaks , is a function of the @xmath13 parameter ( @xcite ) .",
    "when the p - grb is the leading contribution to the emission and the afterglow is negligible we have a `` genuine '' short grb ( @xcite ) .",
    "this is the case where @xmath14 ( see fig .  [ figx ] ) : in the limit @xmath15 the afterglow vanishes ( see fig .  [ figx ] ) .    ) , are plotted as functions of the @xmath13 parameter .",
    "also represented are the values of the @xmath13 parameter computed for grb 991216 , grb 030329 , grb 980425 , grb 970228 , grb 050315 , grb 031203 , grb 060218 . remarkably , they are consistently smaller than , or equal to in the special case of grb 060218 , the absolute upper limit @xmath16 established in @xcite .",
    "the `` genuine '' short grbs have a p - grb predominant over the afterglow : they occur for @xmath14 ( @xcite ) . ]    in the other grbs , with @xmath17 , the afterglow contribution is generally predominant ( see fig .  [ figx ] ; for the existence of the upper limit @xmath16 see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "still , this case presents two distinct possibilities :    * the afterglow peak luminosity is * larger * than the p - grb one .",
    "a clear example of this situation is grb 991216 , represented in fig .",
    "[ 991216_fig ] . *",
    "the afterglow peak luminosity is * smaller * than the p - grb one .",
    "a clear example of this situation is grb 970228 , represented in fig . [",
    "970228_fit_prompt ] .    the simultaneous occurrence of an afterglow with total time - integrated luminosity larger than the p - grb one , but with a smaller peak luminosity , is indeed explainable in terms of a peculiarly small average value of the cbm density , compatible with a galactic halo environment , and not due to the intrinsic nature of the source ( see fig .",
    "[ 970228_fit_prompt ] and @xcite ) .",
    "such a small average cbm density deflates the afterglow peak luminosity .",
    "of course , such a deflated afterglow lasts much longer , since the total time - integrated luminosity in the afterglow is fixed by the value of the @xmath13 parameter ( see above and fig .",
    "[ picco_n=1 ] ) . in this sense , grbs belonging to this class are only `` fake '' short grbs .",
    "this is grb class identified by @xcite , which also grb 060614 belongs to , and which has grb 970228 as a prototype ( @xcite ) .",
    "@xmath18 kev , above ) and wfc ( @xmath19@xmath20 kev , below ) light curves ( data points ) are compared with the afterglow peak theoretical ones ( solid lines ) .",
    "the onset of the afterglow coincides with the end of the p - grb ( represented qualitatively by the dotted lines ) . for this source",
    "we have @xmath21 and @xmath22 particles/@xmath12 .",

    "details in @xcite . ]",
    "we have presented our `` canonical grb '' scenario , especially pointing out the need to distinguish between `` genuine '' and `` fake '' short grbs :    * the * `` genuine '' short grbs * inherit their features from an intrinsic property of their sources .",
    "the very small fireshell baryon loading , in fact , implies that the afterglow time - integrated luminosity is negligible with respect to the p - grb one . *",
    "the * `` fake '' short grbs * , instead , inherit their features from the environment .",
    "the very small cbm density , in fact , implies that the afterglow peak luminosity is lower than the p - grb one , even if the afterglow total time - integrated luminosity is higher .",
    "this deflated afterglow peak can be observed as a `` soft bump '' following the p - grb spike , as in grb 970228 ( @xcite ) , grb 060614 ( @xcite ) , and the sources analyzed by @xcite .        before concluding , we turn to the amati relation ( @xcite ) between the isotropic equivalent energy emitted in the prompt emission @xmath26 and the peak energy of the corresponding time - integrated spectrum @xmath27 .",
    "it clearly follows from our treatment ( @xcite ) that both the hard - to - soft behavior and the amati relation occurs uniquely in the afterglow phase which , in our model , encompass as well the prompt emission .",
    "the observations that the initial spikelike emission in the above mentioned `` fake '' short grbs , which we identify with the p - grbs , as well as all `` genuine '' short grbs do not fulfill the amati relation ( see @xcite ) is indeed a confirmation of our theoretical model ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "we look forward to verifications in additional sources ."
