    "the radiative decay @xmath6 plays an important role in the present tests of the standard model ( sm ) and of its extensions @xcite .",
    "in particular , in the supersymmetric extensions of the sm , the best bounds on several new parameters come from the data on @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "the short distance qcd effects are very important for this decay .",
    "they are known to enhance the branching ratio @xmath7 by roughly a factor of three , as first pointed out in @xcite . since these first analyses , a lot of progress has been made in calculating these important qcd effects in the renormalization group improved perturbation theory , beginning with the work in @xcite .",
    "let us briefly summarize this progress .",
    "a peculiar feature of the renormalization group analysis in @xmath8 is that the mixing under infinite renormalization between the four - fermion operators @xmath9 and the magnetic penguin operators @xmath10 , which govern this decay , vanishes at the one - loop level .",
    "consequently , in order to calculate the coefficients @xmath11 and @xmath12 at @xmath13 in the leading logarithmic approximation , two - loop calculations of @xmath14 and @xmath15 are necessary .",
    "such calculations were completed in @xcite and confirmed in @xcite .",
    "earlier analyses contained either additional approximations or mistakes .",
    "it turns out that the leading order expression for the branching ratio @xmath16 suffers from sizable renormalization scale uncertainties @xcite implying that a complete nlo analysis including also dominant higher order electroweak effects to this decay is mandatory . by 1998 , the main ingredients of such an analysis had been calculated .",
    "it was a joint effort of many groups :    * the @xmath17 corrections to @xmath18 and @xmath19 were first calculated in @xcite and subsequently confirmed by several groups @xcite@xcite .",
    "* the two - loop mixing involving the four fermion operators @xmath20 and the two - loop mixing in the sector @xmath10 was calculated in @xcite@xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "the very difficult three - loop mixing between the set @xmath9 and the operators @xmath10 was calculated in @xcite . *",
    "leading order matrix elements @xmath21 were calculated in @xcite , and the challenging two - loop calculation of @xmath22 was presented in @xcite . * higher order electroweak corrections were incorporated with increasing level of sophistication in @xcite@xcite .    in addition , non - perturbative corrections were calculated in @xcite@xcite .",
    "the most recent analysis of @xmath8 incorporating all these calculations can be found in @xcite .",
    "now , among the perturbative ingredients listed above , three have been calculated only by one group",
    ". these are    * the two - loop mixing in the sector @xmath10 @xcite . * the three - loop mixing between the set @xmath9 and the operators @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "* the two - loop matrix element @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "moreover ,    * the two - loop matrix elements of the qcd penguin operators @xmath23 with @xmath24 have not yet been calculated .",
    "it should be emphasized that all these four ingredients enter not only the analysis of @xmath6 in the sm but are also necessary ingredients of any analysis of this decay in the extensions of this model .",
    "it is therefore desirable to check the first three calculations and to perform the last one .    in the present paper",
    ", we will make the first step in this direction by calculating the two - loop matrix element @xmath25 using the method of asymptotic expansions .",
    "this matrix element turned out to be the most important ingredient of the nlo ",
    "analysis for br@xmath26 enhancing this branching ratio by roughly @xmath27 . in @xcite , the matrix element @xmath22 was found by applying the mellin ",
    "barnes representation to certain internal propagators , and the result was presented as an expansion in @xmath28 up to and including terms @xmath29 . in order to be sure about the convergence of this expansion",
    ", we will include also the terms @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "the effective hamiltonian for the process @xmath34 is given by @xmath35 here @xmath36 is the fermi constant , @xmath37 are the ckm matrix elements and @xmath38 are the wilson coefficients of the operators @xmath39 evaluated at @xmath40 .",
    "we have dropped the negligible contributions proportional to @xmath41 . the full list of operators in ( [ effham ] )",
    "can be found in @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we need only the expressions for two of them .",
    "these are @xmath42 where @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 $ ] . as in @xcite",
    ", we will set @xmath46 .    in this section",
    ", we present the details of the calculation of the matrix element @xmath33 in the ndr scheme .",
    "this matrix element vanishes at the one - loop level .",
    "therefore , in order to obtain a non - vanishing contribution , one has to calculate two - loop diagrams .",
    "they are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : m1 ] , [ fig : m2 ] , [ fig : m3 ] , and [ fig : m4 ] , where the wavy and dashed lines represent the photon and gluon , respectively .",
    "following @xcite , we have divided the contributing diagrams into four sets :    * in sets 1 and 2 , the photon is emitted from an internal s - quark ( set1 ) or an internal b - quark ( set 2 ) , which also exchanges a gluon with the charm quark .",
    "* sets 3 and 4 are obtained from sets 1 and 2 , respectively , by emitting this time the photon from the charm quark propagator .",
    "* thanks to qed gauge invariance , it is not necessary to consider diagrams with a real photon emission from external quark lines .",
    "it is convenient to write the regularized contributions from each set of the diagrams as follows : m_1 & = & \\ { 136 ( m_b)^-4 + _ 1 } _ s c_f q_d s|q_7|b_tree , [ eq1 ] + m_2 & = & \\ { -536 ( m_b)^-4 + _ 2 }",

    "we work in @xmath47 dimensions , with @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 is euler s constant .",
    "the tree level matrix element of the operator @xmath53 is given by s|q_7|b_tree = m_b(_b)e8 ^ 2 ( p ) /q / p_r u(p ) .    in order to make the two - loop matrix element finite ,",
    "counterterms have to be added .",
    "these counterterms can easily be calculated by using the operator renormalization constants that were needed in the context of the calculation of the leading order anomalous dimension matrix .",
    "the complete counterterm is found to be @xcite m_2^count = \\",
    "{ q_d6 ( m_b ) ^-2 + 3q_u8 -q_d18 } ^4 c_f s|q_7|b_tree .",
    "[ eq6 ] the above expression includes two - loop counterterms as well as contributions from one - loop diagrams with one - loop counterterm insertions .    adding the contributions from ( [ eq1])([eq4 ] ) and ( [ eq6 ] ) , we find the two - loop matrix element @xmath54 in the ndr - scheme : s|q_2|b= s|q_7|b_tree _ s4 ( 41681 + r_2 ) , with [ labeleqr2 ] r_2 = -169 ( _ 1 + _ 2 ) + 329 ( _ 3 + _ 4 ) . the rest of this section is devoted to a detailed presentation of the calculation of the contributions @xmath55 using the method of asymptotic expansions .",
    "all the momentum integrals are performed in the euclidean space .      of the four sets of diagrams which we have to consider ,",
    "@xmath56 and @xmath57 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : m1 ] and [ fig : m2 ] are relatively simple . in @xmath56 , the photon is emitted from a massless @xmath58-quark propagator , and the two - loop integral factorizes into the @xmath59-quark loop and the one - loop vertex integral .",
    "there are four momentum regions we have to consider . denoting the momenta in the @xmath59-quark and vertex loops by @xmath60 and @xmath61 , we have    1 .",
    "@xmath62 : the `` hard - hard '' region ; 2 .",
    "@xmath63 and @xmath64 : the `` hard - soft '' region ( which comes in two variants , depending on the routing of @xmath61 through the @xmath59-quark loop ) ; 3 .   a `` collinear - soft '' region , in which @xmath65 and @xmath66 but @xmath67 .",
    "below , we describe the treatment of those regions in some detail .",
    "since all scalar products are now large compared with @xmath69 , we can expand the @xmath59-quark propagators in @xmath68 .",
    "this leads to a massless loop integration , which simply modifies the power of the momentum ( @xmath61 ) in the gluon propagator ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : onevert ] ) . after this first integration",
    ", the integrand has the following form : .",
    "[ eqk1 ] we combine propagators 1 and 3 using the feynman parameter @xmath70 , and then combine the result ( @xmath71 ) with propagator 2 ( @xmath72 ) .",
    "we shift the variable @xmath73 , and the denominator becomes a power of @xmath74 . since @xmath75 , this diagram has an imaginary part ; its sign is determined by assigning a small negative imaginary mass to the massless lines .",
    "after the momentum shift , we have additional factors @xmath76 and @xmath77 in the numerator , and denominator has the power @xmath78 .",
    "the result is & & ^-2 ( -1)^d(d-2 + 2)(d+ ) b(m+a_3,a_1 + 2-d-)b(a_3,a_1+)b(a_2,a_1+a_3 + ) + & & b(n+a_2 + 2-d-2 , a_1+a_3 + 2-d- ) , where @xmath79 and @xmath80 are the standard euler functions beta and @xmath80 .",
    "this region can be handled as in the `` large momentum expansion '' @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig : munich1cr ] , we see one of the two configurations to be computed .",
    "we first integrate over @xmath60 , and then evaluate the one - loop vertex .",
    "an analogous procedure is executed for the other ( left ) @xmath59-quark line .",
    "naively , one might think that we should consider the region @xmath81 , in which @xmath82 , @xmath83 .",
    "however , this does not lead to a consistent power counting , since we have to shift the momentum @xmath61 by an amount proportional to @xmath84 , which is @xmath85 .    instead , we have to consider the collinear configurations @xcite .",
    "we define kq = q_0 k_- , & & k= q_0 k_+ , k^2 = k_+ k_- -k_^2 , q^2 = q_0 ^ 2 , kq = q_0(k_++k_- ) .",

    "now @xmath88 , while @xmath89 is already homogeneously of order @xmath69 and can not be expanded .",
    "first , we integrate over @xmath60 ; for this we combine the two @xmath59 propagators ( we assume here , for generality , that their powers are @xmath90 and @xmath91 ) using @xmath70 , shift @xmath92 , and obtain ( @xmath93 and @xmath94 are exponents arising from the presence of @xmath60 in the numerator ) & & ( d-2+)b(a_1,a_2)(d ) x^m+a_1 + 1-d- ( 1-x)^a_2 + 1-d- ( k^2+m_x^2)^d-2 + , + m_x^2 & & m_c^2x(1-x ) . for the @xmath61 integration ,",
    "the integrand has the form .",
    "now , we combine the first two propagators multiplying them by @xmath95 and @xmath96 , respectively . we multiply the result by @xmath97 and combine it with the `` @xmath98 '' propagator multiplied by @xmath99 .",
    "finally , we use the parameter @xmath100 to include the last propagator ( @xmath101 ) : + & & = 1b(i , a_5)_0^u .",
    "now , we shift @xmath102 and , using @xmath103 , find that the denominator simplifies to become @xmath104 $ ] . because of the presence of @xmath105 in the numerator , we generate additional powers of feynman parameters . after integrating over @xmath105",

    "0^u = b(n ,",
    "m - n)(q^2)^n ( zm^2)^m - n .",
    "we see that the dependence on @xmath106 separates ( so the integral really depends only on a single scale ) .",
    "also , only @xmath68 appears in fractional power , so that there is no imaginary part in this integral , even though @xmath107 ( after the wick rotation ) .      in this diagram",
    ", we have again four momentum regions , of which the first three are similar to those discussed for @xmath56 .",

    "after that , the integrand takes on the following form : .",
    "we combine propagators 2 and 3 using a feynman parameter @xmath70 , and then combine the result ( @xmath72 ) with the propagator 1 ( @xmath109 ) .",

    "after shifting the momentum and simplifying the numerator , additional factors @xmath76 and @xmath77 appear in the numerator , and the denominator has the power @xmath112 . after the @xmath61 integration , we find that the @xmath70 and @xmath97 integrations do not separate , and we first integrate over @xmath70 using eq .",
    "( [ eq : xinteg ] ) , to be discussed below .",
    "the remaining @xmath97 integration is a beta function .",
    "the hard - soft contributions are similar to those in @xmath56 and lead to rather trivial products of one - loop integrals .",
    "on the other hand , the soft - soft contribution is less standard .",
    "we have @xmath113 and the two @xmath114-quark propagators can be expanded . in the lowest order",
    "we have & & 12kq , + 1k^2 + 2kq - q^2 & & -1q^2 .",
    "since the second propagator becomes independent of @xmath61 , the whole two - loop diagram becomes equivalent to a simpler , two - point function .",
    "the resulting integrals are similar , but not the same , as those considered in the eikonal expansion study @xcite .",
    "details of their evaluation have been recently described in a completely different context of bound - state calculations @xcite . in that work ,",
    "exactly such type of integrals appeared when energies of bound - states consisting of two particles with very different masses were expressed as expansions in the ratio of those masses .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     we observe that the terms @xmath116 with @xmath117 are negligible .",
    "the final result for @xmath118 is given by : @xmath119    the strong dependence of @xmath118 on @xmath120 has been pointed out in @xcite . with decreasing @xmath96",
    "the enhancement of @xmath121 by qcd corrections becomes stronger .",
    "in the present paper , we have calculated the important two - loop matrix element @xmath22 contributing to the decay @xmath2 at the nlo level .",
    "our result for @xmath122 agrees with the one presented in @xcite and used in the literature by many authors .",
    "the additional terms in the expansion in @xmath28 , that is @xmath30 and higher , turn out to amount to at most @xmath123 and are negligible .",
