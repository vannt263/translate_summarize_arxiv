    "helioseismology is primarily concerned with the peaks in the solar oscillation spectrum which are identified with acoustic eigenmodes of the sun .",
    "however the whole spectrum , including the variation between the mode peaks , contains useful information about the sun s structure and dynamics .",
    "moreover , the asymmetries in the  lines which were first identified by duvall et al .",
    "( 1993 ) can bias the fitting of profiles to the peaks and hence introduce errors in the determination of the frequencies .",
    "the most recent space - based spectra from soho - mdi ( nigam et al . 1998 ) have confirmed the existence of a strong asymmetry .",
    "thus the study of  line asymmetries is prompted both by the need to improve on traditional data analysis techniques and by the hope of obtaining new scientific information from them .",
    "the occurrence of highly asymmetric line profiles is a common feature of models in which the oscillations are driven by a localised source ( gabriel 1992 , 1993 , 1995 ) .",
    "abrams and kumar ( 1996 ) explored the nature of the asymmetry in a simple model using analytical techniques and then applied these ideas to the interpretation of numerical calculations of the line asymmetry in a real solar model , including the variation of the asymmetry with frequency and mode degree and estimates of the error introduced into the determination of the frequencies by the neglect of the line asymmetry .",
    "rast & bogdan ( 1997 ) emphasised the sensitivity of the asymmetry to the depth and type of the source .",
    "in particular they introduced the approach that the observed asymmetry can best be approached through understanding the relative locations of the peaks and troughs in the spectrum , where the location of the troughs can be determined ( in some circumstances ) by solving an eigenproblem for a solar model truncated from above at the source depth .",
    "although the calculations presented here will result in an estimate for the whole spectrum , i will follow the example of rast & bogdan in concentrating particularly on the relative locations of the peaks and troughs as a key diagnostic indicator of the source of excitation .",
    "roxburgh & vorontsov ( 1995 ) used a form of asymptotic analysis to model the power spectrum .",
    "the analysis presented here differs from theirs in that it uses a matched wave technique in which the matching across the turning point(s ) is treated explicitly .",
    "moreover , i consider a general form of the source term and obtain an explicit expression for the asymptotic line profile .",
    "it is found that the power spectrum can be represented in a simple form even for a general source , and this should guide the analysis and interpretation of the peaks and troughs in the solar  spectrum .",
    "i begin in  [ illus ] with a very simple illustrative model which nevertheless captures some important aspects of the dynamics . in ",
    "[ strat ] i show how one may carry out a matched - wave asymptotic analysis for a stratified layer with a source containing both monopole and dipole terms .",
    "i am predominantly interested in the lowest frequency modes , for which the asymmetry is most easily observed .",
    "however , asymptotic results for intermediate and high - frequency oscillations are also presented . in  [ results ]",
    "i evaluate the resulting asymptotic expressions for a simple model and compare them with a direct numerical calculation .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows a simple model of a driven oscillator consisting of a uniform string characterised by a soundspeed @xmath0 , clamped at its ends at @xmath1 and driven by a localised source at @xmath2 .",
    "the displacement , @xmath3 , of the string satisfies the equation @xmath4 where the wavenumber @xmath5 and the amplitudes of the monopole and dipole source terms , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , are , in general , arbitrary complex functions of the frequency @xmath8 .",
    "although such a model is almost trivial to analyse , its solution will be found to illustrate many of the properties of the more general problem with which we are primarily concerned .",
    "we can obtain jump conditions at @xmath9 by integrating the equation of motion from @xmath10 to @xmath11 and by multiplying the equation by @xmath12 and then performing the same integral : @xmath13 and @xmath14 evidently a dipole source is inconsistent with a physically realisable string , which must be everywhere continuous , but it is a useful idealisation ; equivalent to a pair of oppositely - signed monopole sources whose separation is much less than any other length - scale in the problem .",
    "the solution to equation ( [ eq1 ] ) is then @xmath15 where @xmath16\\ ] ] and @xmath17.\\ ] ] it is immediately evident that the amplitudes both diverge for @xmath18 , _",
    "i.e. _ at an eigenmode of the whole cavity .    now in the sun , the driving occurs close to the surface but below the region where the observations are made so , by analogy , we define the measured power as @xmath19 .",
    "however the total energy in the string is proportional to @xmath20 . for convenience",
    "we define a quantity @xmath21 figure [ fig2 ] shows plots of the power and energy spectra for several choices of @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "the following properties of the solutions are clearly evident :    ( i ) : :    the degree of asymmetry in the power spectrum increases as the source    is moved closer to the upper boundary .",
    "( ii ) : :    the peaks in the energy spectrum are much more symmetric than those in    the power spectrum .",
    "thus , in a sense , the zeros in the power spectrum    are illusory , or at least misleading , since there are no zeros in the    energy spectrum excited by the source .",
    "( iii ) : :    for the lowest frequency modes , and for a monopolar source , the    troughs lie above the frequency of the corresponding modes ( a negative    asymmetry in the language of abrams & kumar ) .",
    "( iv ) : :    for a monopole source , the asymmetry decreases as the frequency is    increased and eventually changes sign .",
    "( v ) : :    a purely dipolar source results in peaks with the opposite sense of    asymmetry to that given by a monopole source .",
    "( vi ) : :    for a dipole source , the asymmetry increases as the frequency is    increased and eventually reverses sign .    as we shall show below , all these properties are also present in the power spectrum for a stratified medium with the exception of property ( vi ) .",
    "instead , for the stratified case , a purely dipolar source located in the evanescent region gives an asymmetry which decreases in magnitude with increasing frequency .",
    "we restrict ourselves to consideration of the oscillations of a plane - parallel stratified layer and ignore the effects of curvature .",
    "oscillations of such a region with frequency @xmath8 and horizontal wave number @xmath24 satisfy the equation @xmath25 where the independent variable @xmath12 increases in a downward direction and the dependent variable @xmath26 , where @xmath27 and @xmath0 are the equilibrium density and sound - speed respectively and @xmath28 is the velocity field of the perturbation .",
    "the form of the source term , @xmath29 , is discussed in detail by gabriel ( 1993 ) .",
    "the local vertical wavenumber , @xmath30 , satisfies @xmath31\\ ] ] where @xmath32 and @xmath33 and where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are , respectively , the equilibrium pressure and the acceleration due to gravity and @xmath36 , the derivative being at constant entropy .      for a solar - like stratification , and for frequencies less than the photospheric cutoff at about 5.3mhz , there is a cavity in which @xmath37 , bounded by turning points at which @xmath38 becomes negative .",
    "the lower turning point is dictated by the rapid increase of @xmath0 with depth , while the upper turning point is dictated by the rapid increase of @xmath39 near the solar photosphere .",
    "modes close to the cutoff have an upper turning point very close to the surface while lower frequency modes are reflected somewhat more deeply .    the precise form of the source terms in equation ( [ general_eqn ] )",
    "can not be deduced without a complete theory of solar convection .",
    "however , it is clear that the source must be strongly peaked in the turbulent super - adiabatic boundary layer at the top of the convection zone , a result also evident from the observationally - determined excitation rate ( goldreich et al .",
    "1994 ) . in this section",
    "we will restrict our analysis to the case of low - frequency oscillations for which this source lies in the evanescent region above the upper turning point .    for simplicity we will consider the case of a source localised at a single height : @xmath40 where the factors @xmath41 have been introduced purely for convenience ( since @xmath6 and @xmath7 may , in general , be functions of frequency and wavenumber ) .",
    "the solution for a more general source term will be given in ",
    "[ app ] . in the following analysis",
    "i shall refer to the terms involving @xmath6 and @xmath7 as monopole and dipole terms respectively .",
    "this use of the terms `` monopole '' and `` dipole '' is quite distinct from that employed by goldreich & kumar ( 1990 ) who define monopole terms as those sources involving a volume change , dipole terms as those arising from a momentum source , and quadropole terms as those arising from internal stresses .",
    "this latter definition is clearly the better physical description of the actual excitation mechanism .",
    "moreover , as goldreich & kumar point out , a definition of the multipole expansion solely in terms of the number of derivatives appearing in the source terms is ambiguous unless one also specifies ones preferred choice of independent wave variable .",
    "however , given a particular choice of wave variable ( and the variable @xmath3 is a natural choice ) the form of the power spectrum is indeed determined by the number of derivatives ( or rather the number of sign changes ) appearing in the source terms .",
    "the precise relationship between the two descriptions of the source terms depends on the detailed properties of the turbulent convection itself . in the future we hope to expand on the numerical work of stein & nordlund ( 1991 ) to obtain a fully consistent picture of the excitation process",
    "however , for the present purposes , the terms `` monopole '' and `` dipole '' will be used to refer to terms involving @xmath6 and @xmath7 as above , with no particular assumption being made as to the physical nature of the driving mechanism .",
    "the geometry of the problem is indicated in figure ( [ fig4 ] ) .",
    "the propagating region ( region ii ) is bounded by the lower and upper turning points @xmath42 and @xmath43 respectively , and the source at @xmath23 divides the upper evanescent region in two .",
    "we therefore proceed by writing down approximate solutions to equation ( [ general_eqn ] ) valid in each of the four regions and using matching conditions at the boundaries between the regions to fix the arbitrary constants appearing in the solution .",
    "i shall use the ( lowest order ) wkb solutions , which are valid provided the scale of variation of @xmath38 is long compared to the vertical wavelength , _",

    "it is straightforward to solve the equations to obtain @xmath75 which is the low - frequency asymptotic amplitude spectrum .",
    "the spectrum defined by equation ( [ spec1 ] ) diverges at frequencies corresponding to eigenmodes of the cavity , _ i.e. _ @xmath76 independent of the form and location of the driving .",
    "however the minima of @xmath77 depend on the values of @xmath23 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "thus , as we would expect , the spectral response away from the eigenmodes contains information about both the cavity and the source .",
    "if we consider cases where the ratio @xmath78 is real then the minima will , in fact , be zeros ( nulls ) .",
    "we are particularly interested in the low - frequency / large-@xmath79 case , for which it is evident that the zeros must lie close to the eigenmodes , _",
    "i.e. _ for which the peaks in the power spectrum must be most asymmetric . in this case",
    "it is easy to show that the zeros are given by @xmath80 now the integral in equation ( [ phi ] ) is known ( christensen - dalsgaard & prez hernndez 1992 ) to have the property @xmath81 where the function @xmath82 is the duvall function and @xmath83 is a term whose properties depend predominantly on the structure of the surface layers .",
    "furthermore , it is clear that @xmath79 is almost independent of @xmath24 since it involves the evaluation of @xmath30 only in the evanescent region where @xmath84 .",
    "thus both the dispersion relation [ eq .",
    "[ modes1 ] ] and the equation for the nulls [ eq . [ zeros1 ] ] can be written in the form @xmath85 where the duvall function is the same in each case but the phase function @xmath86 for the troughs differs from that from the modes . in the limit of large @xmath79",
    "we have @xmath87 where @xmath88 and @xmath89 are the phase functions specifying the positions of the troughs and modes respectively .",
    "the sign of the difference depends on the type of the source . for a pure monopole source ,",
    "@xmath90 is positive , corresponding to troughs in the power spectrum lying above the corresponding peaks , with the situation being reversed for a pure dipole source . in ",
    "[ results ] i will show results for a simple model which illustrate these properties of the power spectrum .",
    "the special case @xmath91 corresponds to a solution with @xmath92 . in this case",
    "there is no wave energy below the source and so the spectrum contains no signal of the presence of an acoustic cavity .",
    "thus the spectrum of @xmath73 is flat .",
    "if we consider the solution to the local - driving problem [ eq . [ local ] ] with @xmath7 set to zero then we immediately recover the green s function for the general case of equation ( [ general_eqn ] ) . thus ,",
    "if the source term is located entirely within the evanescent region one can simply write down the solution in the region above the source : @xmath93 \\over 4\\left| k^2(z)\\right|^{1\\over 4 } } \\int a_{\\omega , k}(z_0)\\left\\ { 2e^{\\delta(z_0 ) } + e^{-\\delta(z_0)}\\tan\\phi\\right\\ }   \\left| k(z_0)\\right|^{-{1\\over 2}}\\dd z_0 \\label{general_soln}\\ ] ] where @xmath79 and @xmath94 are defined by equations ( [ delta ] ) and ( [ phi ] ) respectively .",
    "note that @xmath94 is independent of @xmath23 . thus multiplying equation ( [ general_soln ] ) with its complex conjugate",

    "thus if we were to replace our delta - function source by a finite - width , single - phase source , the troughs in the spectrum would still be true zeros .",
    "conversely , the existence of sharp troughs in the measured spectrum can not be taken as an indication that the source itself is necessarily highly localised .",
    "a key question in helioseismology is the correct way to determine the true solar oscillation eigenfrequencies from the measured spectrum of asymmetric , multiply - excited peaks superimposed on a noisy background .",
    "rast & bogdan ( 1997 ) suggested that a correction to the peak location might be obtained by using the location of the nearest trough while rhodes et al .",
    "( 1997 ) show a comparison of an asymmetric _ p_-mode line profile to an asymmetric lorentzian function .",
    "the asymptotic spectrum ( [ spec1 ] ) suggests a possible physically - motivated profile for use in fitting asymmetric peaks in the data . for a given peak",
    "one takes @xmath100 where @xmath101 is a typical inter - peak spacing and the damping constant @xmath57 has been introduced to ensure that the amplitude is everywhere finite . then the peak profile will be given by @xmath102 where @xmath57-@xmath103 and @xmath101 are real parameters .",
    "the additive noise background has been expressed as a constant @xmath58 , although in practice a power law might be preferred .",
    "this can be written @xmath104 where @xmath105    one could fit the peak directly to ( [ profile1 ] ) .",
    "alternatively one notes that close to the peak we have @xmath106 so @xmath107 equation ( [ profile2 ] ) produces only a single asymmetric peak while equation ( [ profile1 ] ) includes the influence of nearby peaks directly due to the periodicity of the @xmath108 function .",
    "thus it is clear by inspection that equation ( [ profile2 ] ) can not be used to fit the parameter @xmath101 independently of the other parameters .",
    "an important limit of equation ( [ profile2 ] ) is the case @xmath109 which yields @xmath110 from which one can see that allowing @xmath111 to tend to infinity while keeping @xmath112 constant yields a symmetric lorentzian peak .",
    "thus the asymmetric forms include symmetric peaks as a special case .    the actual use of either ( [ profile1 ] ) or ( [ profile2 ] ) to fit solar data will be the subject of a future investigation .",
    "however , in order to illustrate that such a procedure is feasible , figure [ fit ] shows some preliminary results of a fit of profile ( [ profile1 ] ) to one month of low degree gong data . even from a single month of data , it is clear that the peaks show a negative asymmetry ( more power in the low - frequency wing of the peak than in the high - frequency wing ) and that the asymmetric profile produces a substantially better fit to the data than does a symmetric lorentzian .",
    "a full discussion of the fitting procedure , error analysis , and details of the numerical results will be presented in a future publication , and will be based on analysis of much longer observational runs from both gong and the soi - mdi instrument on soho .      in the sun",
    ", oscillations are seen well above the photospheric cutoff frequency . these have been interpreted ( kumar et al . 1990 , kumar & lu 1991 ) as pseudomodes ( interference fringes ) caused by the interference of a wave propagating up from the source with a wave propagating downwards from the source and reflected back upwards at its lower turning point . the analysis developed in ",
    "[ case1 ] is easily extended to this case .",
    "we now have only three regions to consider : a lower evanescent region , a central propagating region below the source and an upper propagating region above the source .",

    "however the location of the minima and maxima , their separation , and their visibility are dependent on both the type and location of the source .",
    "formally we can consider a third case in which the upper turning point lies well above the source . in practice",
    "this case probably does not accurately describe the properties of any actual mode occurring in the sun , so i include it only for completeness and note only the result for the amplitude spectrum : @xmath116 \\label{spec3}\\ ] ] where @xmath94 is given by equation ( [ phi ] ) and @xmath117 the condition for the eigenmodes is the same as in the low - frequency case [ eq . [ modes1 ] ] .",
    "however the absence of the small factor @xmath118 means that the spectral peaks are much more symmetrical in this case .",
    "asymptotic descriptions of the properties of solar oscillations have generally proved useful in helioseismology as guides to the relationship between properties of the spectrum and properties of the model . only in limited cases",
    "can the actual asymptotic expressions themselves be used for direct numerical comparison between observation and theory . in the present case",
    "we have found that the asymptotic analysis points to the phase - function difference between the modes and the troughs in the solar spectrum as being a useful diagnostic for the source of the oscillations .",
    "i now apply this to a simple model .",
    "i consider a model consisting of an adiabatic polytropic layer characterized by a polytropic index @xmath119 , truncated at some depth @xmath120 corresponding to the surface of the sun , and overlain by an isothermal atmosphere characterized by a density scale - height , @xmath121 .",
    "a parameter @xmath122 is defined as the ratio of the temperature immediately above the surface to that immediately below .",
    "thus for @xmath123 we have @xmath124 while for @xmath125 we have @xmath126    figure [ fig001 ] shows asymptotic power spectra for an @xmath127 polytrope in which a pure monopole source is located 90 km below the photosphere .",
    "the peaks show the same sign of asymmetry as seen in the solar doppler observations .",
    "the asymmetry decreases with increasing horizontal wavenumber and increasing frequency .",
    "also shown is the effective difference between the phase function describing the peaks and the phase function for the troughs .",
    "evidently the difference is close to being a function of frequency alone , even towards the higher frequencies where the approximate expression for the difference [ eq . [ zeros1 ] ] is invalid .",
    "figure [ fig002 ] shows the spectrum for the same case as in figure [ fig001 ] however i now show the result for a single wavenumber but extended over a large frequency range so as to include all three asymptotic regimes .",
    "the crossovers between the three asymptotic regimes are quite smooth despite the fact that the asymptotic analysis formally breaks down at those points .",
    "the asymmetry is again strongest at low frequency and decreases as the frequency is increased .",
    "however there is no actual reversal of the sign of asymmetry for this particular source depth . in the high - frequency range",
    "the troughs are still present but there are no eigenmode peaks . when the monopole source is replaced by a dipole the locations of the eigenmodes are , of course , unaffected but the sign of the line asymmetries is reversed . for the high - frequency modes",
    "there is a phase shift so that the locations of maxima and minima in the spectrum are interchanged .      for comparison between the asymptotic and numerical results , i solve equation ( [ general_eqn ] ) with right - hand - side given by equation ( [ local ] ) using a shooting method .",
    "specifically one starts from a location well above both the upper turning point and the source with the initial condition @xmath128 and integrates down to the source at @xmath23 .",
    "call the values of the wave function and its derivative there @xmath129 and @xmath130 .",
    "similarly one can integrate from below the lower turning point up through the cavity to @xmath23 , starting with the boundary condition @xmath131 , to obtain @xmath132 and @xmath133 immediately below the source",
    ". then the jump conditions [ eqs .",

    "we may assume that @xmath132 and @xmath129 are real .",
    "if we consider only cases where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are in phase , or cases in which either @xmath6 or @xmath7 vanishes , we see that zeros of @xmath136 can occur and that their location is independent of @xmath129 . thus _ the location of the nulls in the spectrum is independent of the atmospheric structure above the source_. the explanation for this result is quite simple - since the nulls correspond to frequencies where the amplitude in the superficial layers is identically zero their location can not depend on the structure of those layers . in the more general case in which @xmath6 and @xmath7 are complex",
    "the minima will no longer be true zeros and their location will no longer be independent of @xmath129 . instead",
    "they will be given by the condition @xmath141 which in general will depend also on @xmath129 .",
    "nevertheless , the minima will still be locations in which the amplitude in the region above the source is small and their location will therefore still be less sensitive to the structure of the superficial layers than the locations of the eigenmodes .",
    "this result is illustrated in figure [ fig004 ] which shows a single peak and trough in the case of a monopole and dipole source acting in phase - quadrature and for two different values of the photospheric temperature - jump parameter .",
    "evidently the trough remains almost fixed while the eigenfrequency varies .    if we return to the asymptotic expressions for the eigenfrequencies and nulls [ eqs .",
    "[ modes1 ] and [ zeros1 ] ] we see that these expressions imply that the mode frequencies depend only on the structure below the upper turning point while the nulls depend only on the structure below the source .",
    "however , while the former statement is only an approximation , because the eigenfunctions have non - zero amplitude outside the turning points , the latter statement is exact for those cases where the troughs are true nulls .",
    "figure [ fig003 ] shows a comparison of numerical and asymptotic estimates of the power spectrum .",
    "while the spectra are qualitatively the same , quantitatively the separation between the peaks and troughs for the numerical calculation is much smaller than that predicted by the asymptotics .",
    "this suggests that while the asymptotics may be a useful guide as to the correct interpretation of the line asymmetries , it would be wrong to use an asymptotic expression such as equation ( [ dalpha ] ) in a quantitative comparison with the data .",
    "typically , helioseismology has concentrated on analysis of the eigenmode frequencies of the sun and relatively little attention has been paid to the rest of the spectrum . with the advent of the soi / mdi instrument on soho and the gong network , noise levels in measured spectra are now sufficiently low that it is not only possible to make useful measurements between the mode peaks but _ necessary _ to do so since it is increasingly clear that the line asymmetry can produce systematic errors in the determination of _",
    "p_-mode frequencies if it is not accounted for properly .",
    "a puzzle in the data has been the observation originally due to duvall et al ( 1993 ) , and now apparently confirmed from soi - mdi ( nigam et al .",
    "1998 ) , that the sign of the measured asymmetry is oppositely directed in doppler and intensity measurements .",
    "the doppler measurements imply a dominant monopole source ( a negative asymmetry in the abrams & kumar terminology ) while the intensity measurements would suggest a dipole source .",
    "rast & bogdan ( 1997 ) show that , regardless of the form of the source function , one would expect to see the same sign of asymmetry with observations made in different variables , since the locations of the peaks and troughs are the same for all variables .",
    "nigam et al .",
    "have shown that the phenomenon can be explained if the measured signal in either doppler or intensity is contaminated by a noise source which is correlated with the source , for example if the measured signal contains a contribution coming directly from the source itself .",
    "the question is then raised as to which of the doppler measurement and the intensity measurement actually constitutes a better measurement of the true acoustic spectrum .",
    "one might argue that the doppler signal is probably less contaminated since it has a lower overall background level , but it is certainly possible that both the intensity and doppler measurements contain some leakage from the source , with an amplitude and phase which are not yet precisely known .",
    "evidently the possibility that the location of the spectral minima is shifted due to such leakage must complicate the interpretation of the line - asymmetry in terms of source location and type , and further work will be required to determine whether the combined doppler and intensity measurements can be used to determine the true acoustic spectrum in a model - independent fashion .    as originally pointed out by rast & bogdan ,",
    "the asymmetry is best approached by consideration of the minima in the spectrum , whose location is determined by the depth and type of the source of the oscillations . in this work",
    "i have determined an asymptotic expression for the frequency spectrum , from which it is possible to determine the locations of the minima .",
    "the sign of the line asymmetry is determined by whether the nearest minimum lies above or below the eigenfrequency .",
    "the former case corresponds ( at low frequency ) to a pure monopole source and the latter to a pure dipole .",
    "the amount of asymmetry depends of the location of the source .",
    "the higher the source is placed above the upper turning point of the oscillation the closer the trough will lie to the eigenmode and therefore the greater the asymmetry .",
    "thus the extent of the asymmetry should be a useful diagnostic of the properties of the turbulent superadiabatic layer in which the source of the solar  is believed to lie .",
    "numerical results confirm the qualitative properties of the asymptotic results . also for the case of a pure monopole or dipole , or where the two components of the source are in phase , the exact locations of the nulls ( including those above the acoustic cutoff frequency )",
    "can be determined by solving numerically the oscillation equations subject to the boundary condition @xmath142 at @xmath9 .",
    "this should be relatively straightforward to implement in most existing oscillation codes .",
    "one can thus determine numerically the phase - function difference @xmath90 which is predicted by the asymptotic analysis to be a key diagnostic of the structure and location of the source .",
    "since the nulls are independent of the superficial structure the asymmetry could , in principle , provide a tool for differentiating between superficial and more - deeply seated changes in the sun .",
    "in particular , solar - cycle variations occurring above the source location , in the lower atmosphere for example , would change the mode frequencies but not the trough frequencies and could thus be visible as changes in the asymmetry , while changes below the source would change the frequency of both the mode and the trough . in practice",
    "such changes are likely to be extremely difficult to observe , not least because the asymmetry is most evident for lower frequency modes for which the solar - cycle dependent changes are small .",
    "we have thus reached the stage where it is possible to envisage a program for the re - analysis of helioseismic data to make full use of the information contained in the  line profiles . in particular it would be highly desirable to re - analyse the spectral data using parameterised line - profiles such as equation ( [ profile1 ] ) or equation ( [ profile2 ] ) in order to obtain improved estimates of the eigenfrequencies simultaneously with estimates for the spacing between the maxima and minima . from these",
    "we could obtain an observational @xmath90 curve which could be calibrated against theory using nulls calculated from an eigenvalue calculation with boundary condition ( [ bc1 ] ) .",
    "ultimately one would hope that the results of such a calibration could be brought into line with predictions made from numerical simulations of the solar surface layers ( _ e.g. _ stein & nordlund 1989 , stein & nordlund 1991 , nordlund , stein & brandenburg 1996 ) to provide a solidly grounded understanding of this highly complex region of the sun .",
