    "in system analysis and synthesis , a fundamental issue is about verification of its controllability and observability .",
    "while the former is concerned with possibilities of maneuvering the internal variables of a system from one state to another state , the latter is concerned with potentials of estimating system internal variables from external measurements .",
    "it is now widely known that various important system properties , such as the existence of an optimal control under a criterion like @xmath0 or @xmath1 norm , possibilities of stabilizing a plant and/or locating its poles to a desirable area , convergence of a state estimation procedure like the extensively utilized kalman filter , etc .",
    ", are closely related to the controllability and/or observability of the plant at hand @xcite . while this issue has been extensively studied over more than half a century and various criteria , such as the rank condition , the pbh test , etc .",
    ", have been well developed and widely utilized , difficulties arise when these criteria are straightforwardly applied to a system with a large amount of states , which is often encountered in dealing with a networked system consisting of a huge number of subsystems . to be more specific",
    ", it has been recognized that when a large scale networked system is to be dealt with , these criteria are usually computationally prohibitive , and various efforts have recently been put in developing a more computationally efficient criterion for this verification @xcite .",
    "owing to extensive pursuits of numerous researchers , significant developments have been achieved in establishing computationally attractive conditions for analyzing controllability and/or observability of large scale networked systems .",
    "for example , in @xcite , laplacian of a grid graph is adopted in verifying controllability and observability of a family of linear dynamic systems . through some smart graph decompositions ,",
    "computable necessary and sufficient conditions are derived which can distinguish all the necessary nodes that lead to a controllable / observable dynamic system . in @xcite , on the basis of structural controllability and the cavity method developed in statistical physics , some computationally efficient analytic tools are developed to identify a driver node set that is able to maneuver all the system internal variables .",
    "some interesting results have been obtained from this investigation , which include the observation that driver nodes intend to avoid network hubs , biological regulatory networks are significantly more difficult to be controlled than a social network in the sense that much more driver nodes are required to achieve its controllability , etc .    these efforts have greatly advanced analysis and synthesis of a large scale networked system .",
    "complete settlement of its controllability and/or observability verification problem , however , still requires further investigations , noting that all the existing methods ask some conditions that may not be very easily satisfied by practical problems .",
    "for example , the results of @xcite are derived under the condition that every interaction between two connected subsystems has an equal strength , while the approach adopted in @xcite requires precise location knowledge on the zero elements of the plant state transition matrix and the controllability is evaluated with a probabilistic metric .    in this paper",
    ", we re - investigate controllability and observability of a linear time invariant ( lti ) plant consisting of several subsystems .",
    "interactions among subsystems are arbitrary except that the connection matrix is time independent , and the required knowledge is restricted to a state space model of each subsystem and the connection matrix among all subsystems . on the basis of the pbh test",
    ", some necessary and sufficient conditions are obtained respectively for the controllability and the observability of the whole system , which depend essentially only on transmission zeros of its subsystems and its connection matrix among all subsystems .",
    "this characteristic makes these conditions attractive in analyzing and synthesizing large scale networked systems . as an application of these conditions",
    ", situations are discussed under which the distributed state predictor developed in @xcite has the same steady state estimation accuracy as that of the lumped kalman filter . some necessary and sufficient conditions on system matrices",
    "are obtained for this equivalence .",
    "it has been made clear that in order to guarantee this equivalence , the update gain matrix of the kalman filter at its steady state must be block diagonal .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . at first , in section ii , a state space model like representation is given for a networked dynamic system , together with some preliminary results .",
    "controllability and observability of a networked dynamic system is investigated in section iii .",
    "some necessary and sufficient conditions are given in section iv for a networked system to have a steady state estimation accuracy with the distributed predictor of @xcite equal to that of the kalman filter .",
    "finally , some concluding remarks are given in section v in which some further issues are discussed . an appendix is included to give proofs of some technical results .",
    "the following notation and symbols are adopted .",
    "@xmath2 denotes a block diagonal matrix with its @xmath3-th diagonal block being @xmath4 , while @xmath5 the vector / matrix stacked by @xmath6 with its @xmath3-th row block vector / matrix being @xmath4 .",

    "the superscript @xmath15 and @xmath16 are used to denote respectively the transpose and the conjugate transpose of a matrix / vector , and @xmath17 or @xmath18 is sometimes abbreviated as @xmath19 or @xmath20 , especially when the term @xmath21 has a complicated expression .",
    "@xmath22 is used to denote the mathematical expectation of a random variable / matrix . when a time dependent function becomes time independent , its temporal variable",
    "is usually omitted .",
    "for example , when a matrix valued function @xmath23 degenerates into a constant matrix , it is simply written as @xmath24 .",
    "consider the following networked system @xmath25 which is constituted from @xmath26 lti dynamic subsystems with the dynamics of its @xmath3-th subsystem @xmath27 being described by @xmath28 \\!\\!=\\!\\!\\left[\\!\\!\\begin{array}{ccc } a_{\\rm\\bf tt}(i ) & a_{\\rm\\bf ts}(i ) & b_{\\rm\\bf t}(i )   \\\\",

    ", every subsystem of the plant is permitted to have different dynamics , but their dynamics is required to be time invariant . on the other hand , the relation of equation ( [ eqn:8 ] ) reflects the fact that the internal inputs of a subsystem are actually constituted from and only from some internal outputs of other subsystems . as only time invariant systems are investigated in this paper , connections among plant subsystems are also time invariant , which means that the matrix @xmath41 is a constant matrix . on the other hand ,",
    "note that large scale systems are usually sparse @xcite .",
    "these observations imply that every row of the matrix @xmath41 has only one nonzero element which is equal to one , and compared to the number of the states of the whole system , the dimension of this matrix is in general not high @xcite .",
    "it is worthwhile to point out that the restriction that all the nonzero elements of the connection matrix @xmath41 are equal to @xmath42 does not mean that influence strengthes among all subsystems are equivalent to each other .",
    "in fact , different subsystem influence strengthes can be reflected in both the connection matrix @xmath41 and the subsystem parameter matrices like @xmath43 , @xmath44 , etc . @xcite . in this paper , in order to reduce computational complexity in verifying controllability and/or observability of the dynamic system @xmath45 , influence strengthes among subsystems are selected to be included in its subsystem parameter matrices .",
    "the above model is a modification of the model adopted in describing the dynamics of a spatially connected plant which was originally suggested in @xcite and utilized in many other studies such as @xcite .",
    "the differences between these two models are that the model of equations ( [ eqn:7 ] ) and ( [ eqn:8 ] ) permits its subsystems to have different dynamics and connections among subsystems to be arbitrary .",
    "this makes the model adopted in this paper capable of describing dynamics of a larger class of physical systems .",
    "for example , in addition to a finite element approximation to distributed parameter systems , it is also able to describe power networks , multi - agent systems , etc .",
    "the model given by equations ( [ eqn:7 ] ) and ( [ eqn:8 ] ) is very similar to the state space representation of a plant , but knowledge on subsystem connections are described more explicitly . to avoid confusions ,",
    "it is sometimes called a state space model like representation @xcite .",
    "the above model can be easily modified to systems having time varying dynamics and time varying connections .",
    "some other well encountered factors , such as communication delays , data missing , etc .",
    ", can also be introduced into this system model . however , as controllability and observability verification for time varying systems is in general still a mathematically difficult problem in system theories , and time delay and packet loss , etc .",
    ", will lead to other awkward issues which are currently under investigations , we adopt the above system model in this paper as the first step towards investigations on networked systems .    to investigate controllability and observability of the system described by equations ( [ eqn:7 ] ) and ( [ eqn:8 ] ) , the following results are required , which are widely known as the pbh test and have been extensively applied in control and system theories , and can be found in various textbooks dealing with state estimations and/or controller designs , for example , @xcite .",
    "assume that a discrete lti system has the following dynamic input - output relation , @xmath46 in which @xmath24 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 are constant matrices with compatible dimensions , @xmath50 is the plant state vector , @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the plant external input vectors .",

    "the system is observable if and only if for every complex scalar @xmath53 and every nonzero complex vector @xmath57 satisfying @xmath58 , @xmath59 .",
    "the next lemma provides some characteristics of a plant transmission zero , which is closely related to the existence of a nonzero plant input that makes its output constantly equal to zero .",
    "this result is also widely known in linear system theories @xcite .",
    "let @xmath60 be a proper transfer function matrix ( tfm ) having full column normal rank .",
    "then , a complex number @xmath61 is a transmission zero of this tfm if and only if there exists a nonzero complex vector @xmath62 satisfying @xmath63 .",
    "as mentioned before , system controllability and/or observability have been extensively investigated for a long time and various approaches have been developed , such as the rank condition , the pbh test , etc .. it is , however , still a challenging issue for a large scale system , noting that when the existing approaches are directly utilized , some related matrices usually have a very high dimension that makes actual verification computationally prohibitive . on the other hand , when the networked system of equations ( [ eqn:7 ] ) and ( [ eqn:8 ] ) is to be analyzed , it is sometimes not a very easy task even to obtain a state space representation of the whole system itself , especially when the dimension of the matrix @xmath41 is large which corresponds to dense interactions among subsystems .",
    "in fact , developing computationally efficient methods for validating controllability and/or observability of a large scale networked system is currently a very active research topic , and many significant advances have been achieved for some specific systems @xcite .    to make mathematical derivations more concise , the following matrices are at first defined .",
