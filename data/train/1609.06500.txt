    "spherical images are common in nature , for example , in cosmology @xcite , astrophysics @xcite , planetary science @xcite , geophysics @xcite , and neuro - science @xcite , where images are naturally defined on the sphere .",
    "clearly , images defined on the sphere are different to euclidean images in 2d and 3d in terms of symmetries , coordinate systems and metrics constructed ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "image segmentation aims to separate a given image into different components , where each part shares similar characteristics in terms of , e.g. , edges , intensities , colours , and textures .",
    "it generally serves as a preliminary step for object recognition and interpretation , and is a fundamental yet challenging task in image processing . in this paper , we present an effective segmentation method that uses spherical wavelets to segment spherical images .    in the literature , many different approaches have been proposed for image segmentation for 2d , 3d and vector - valued images , e.g. , @xcite . in particular , in @xcite the well - known mumford - shah model was proposed , which formulates the image segmentation problem by minimising an energy function and finding optimal piecewise smooth approximations of the given image .",
    "more details about these kind of methods can be found in @xcite .",
    "these types of methods generally give good segmentation results .",
    "however , their applicabilities and performance heavily depend on the models used ; in some cases ( e.g.  segmenting images containing complex textures ) the models are difficult or expensive to compute due to the non - convex nature of the problem . in @xcite , a graph - cut based method was proposed to segment point clouds into different groups . the more pixels in the image , the larger the size of the eigenvalue problem need to be solved , which makes the method inefficient in terms of speed and accuracy .",
    "methods based on deformable models @xcite segment via evolving geodesic active contours that are built from a partial differential equation , with the ability to detect twisted , convoluted and occluded structures , but are sensitive to noise and blur in images .",
    "recently , segmentation methods @xcite designed utilising techniques in image restoration ( e.g.  @xcite ) , were proposed for gray - scale images . in @xcite , a segmentation model that combines the image segmentation model of @xcite and the data fidelity terms from image restoration models @xcite",
    "was considered to deal with images contaminated by different types of noise ( e.g.  gaussian , poisson or impulsive noise ) . in @xcite ,",
    "the methodology of two - stage methods , solving image restoration models first followed by a thresholding second stage , was proposed .",
    "one advantage of these methods is the fast speed of implementation .",
    "the t - rof method ( thresholding the rudin - osher - fatemi model ) in @xcite concluded that the thresholding approach for segmentation was equivalent to solving the chan - vese segmentation model @xcite .    in additional to the methods above , approaches based on wavelets and tight frames @xcite have been proposed for segmentation . in @xcite",
    ", a tight - frame based segmentation method was designed for a vessel segmentation problem in medical imaging .",
    "the major advantage of this method is the ability to segment twisted , convoluted and occluded structures without user interactions .",
    "moreover , the ability of the method to follow the branching of different layers , from thinner to larger structures , makes the method a good candidate for a tubular - structured segmentation problem in medical imaging .",
    "however , all the tight - frame systems discussed and used in @xcite ( e.g.  framelets @xcite , contourlets @xcite , curvelets @xcite , and dual - tree complex wavelet @xcite ) are designed for 2d or 3d data on a euclidean manifold .",
    "consequently , these approaches can not be applied to problems where data - sets live natively on the sphere .",
    "wavelets have become a powerful analysis tool for spherical images , due to their ability to simultaneously extract both spectral and spatial information .",
    "a variety of wavelet frameworks have been constructed on the sphere in recent years , e.g.  @xcite , and have led to many insightful scientific studies in the fields mentioned above ( see @xcite ) .",
    "different types of wavelets on the sphere have been designed to probe different structure in spherical images , for example isotropic or directional and geometrical features , such as linear or curvilinear structures , to mention a few .",
    "axisymmetric wavelets @xcite are useful for probing spherical images with isotropic structure , directional wavelets @xcite for probing directional structure , ridgelets @xcite for analysing antipodal signals on the sphere , and curvelets @xcite for studying highly anisotropic image content such as curve - like features ( we refer to @xcite for the general definition of euclidean ridgelets and curvelets ) .",
    "fast algorithms have been developed to compute exact forward and inverse wavelet transforms on the sphere for very large spherical images containing millions of pixels @xcite ( leveraging novel sampling theorems on the sphere @xcite and the rotation group @xcite ) .",
    "localisation properties of wavelet constructions have also been studied in detail @xcite , showing important quasi - exponential localisation and asymptotic uncorrelation properties for certain wavelet constructions .",
    "an investigation into the use of axisymmetric and directional wavelets for sparse image reconstruction was performed recently in @xcite , showing excellent performance .",
    "the spherical wavelets adopted in the experimental section of this paper are reviewed briefly in section [ sec : review ] .    in this paper",
    ", we devise an iterative framework for segmenting spherical images using wavelets defined on the sphere , extending the method proposed in @xcite .",
    "the first stage of the method , as a preprocessing step , suppresses noise in the given data by soft thresholding wavelet coefficients .",
    "then , potential boundary pixels are classified gradually by the iterative procedure .",
    "the framework is compatible with any arbitrary type of spherical wavelet , such as the axisymmetric wavelets , directional wavelets , or curvelets mentioned above .",
    "the iterative strategy in the proposed framework is effective , particularly for images containing anisotropic textures .",
    "there is also flexibility regarding the implementation of iterations .",
    "motivated by the two - stage methodology in @xcite , when segmenting images containing many ( or mostly ) isotropic structures , the iterative strategy in our method can be replaced by a simple thresholding to reduce the computation time significantly without sacrificing segmentation quality considerably .",
    "we test the proposed framework on a variety of types of spherical images , including an earth topographic map , a light probe ( spherical ) image , two sets of solar data , and two retina images projected on the sphere .    to the best of our knowledge , this is the first segmentation method that works directly on the _ whole _ sphere and is practical for any type of spherical images , benefiting from the compatibility of the method with any type of spherical wavelets .",
    "a method @xcite was proposed for segmenting spherical particles in volumetric data sets based on an extension of the generalised hough transform and an active contour approach . however , the data considered in @xcite were 3d data containing spherical - like particles , not data defined on the sphere directly .",
    "the main contributions in this paper are : ( 1 ) a segmentation framework for spherical images is devised , for the first time ; ( 2 ) the framework uses an iterative strategy with the flexibility to tailor the iterative procedure according to data types and features ; ( 3 ) spherical wavelets , including axisymmetric wavelets , directional wavelets and the newly - constructed hybrid directional - curvelet wavelets , are implemented and tested in the framework ; ( 4 ) a series of applications are presented , illustrating the performance of our proposed segmentation method .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organised as follows . in section [ sec : review ] , we review related work about spherical wavelets and segmentation methods , and present our new hybrid directional - curvelet wavelet construction . in section [ sec : alg ] , we introduce our spherical segmentation method . in section [ sec : results ] , the proposed method and methods for comparison are tested on a variety of spherical images such as an earth map , light probe images , and two solar maps . to further demonstrate the ability of our method on segmenting highly directional and elongated structures , in section [ sec : results ] we also apply it to retinal images , which contain a complex network of blood vessels .",

    "we adopt the equiangular sampling theorem on the sphere of @xcite , which defines how to capture the information content in a signal band - limited at @xmath7 in @xmath8 samples .",
    "this sampling theorem requires the fewest number of samples to capture all information content on band - limited spherical images . in additional , fast algorithms to perform the associated spherical harmonic transform",
    "are presented @xcite .",

    "the equiangular sample positions of the sphere associated with this sampling theorem are given by @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 index the equiangular samples in @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively .",
    "for example , when @xmath20 , the sphere is discretised with @xmath21 samples . please refer to @xcite and references therein for more information about sampling on the sphere .      in many real - life problems , data to be processed",
    "are usually in a discretised form , as described previously .",
    "also , exact reconstruction of the signal is commonly desired .",
    "scale - discretised wavelets @xcite on the sphere allow the exact synthesis of discrete spherical images from their wavelet coefficients .",

    "low - frequency content of the signal not probed by wavelets are probed by the scaling function @xmath44 , which is generally axisymmetric .",
    "the scaling coefficients @xmath45 are given by @xmath46 where @xmath47 , and the operator @xmath48 denotes axisymmetric convolution on the sphere .",
    "the spherical image @xmath2 can be synthesised perfectly from its wavelet and scaling coefficients ( under the wavelet admissibility condition @xcite ) by the wavelet backward transform ( synthesis ) by @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the usual invariant measure on so(3 ) .",

    "the directionality component @xmath54 , with harmonic coefficients @xmath55 , is designed to control the directional localisation properties of @xmath25 .",

    "such a geometric feature is unique to curvelets , making it highly anisotropic and directionally sensitive , and thus suitable for extracting local curvilinear structures effectively .",

    "in this paper we proposed a wavelet - based segmentationmethod ( wssa ) for spherical images , which is , to the best of our knowledge , the first method performing segmentation directly on the sphere .",
    "the method is compatible with any invertible wavelet transform constructed on the sphere ( e.g.  axisymmetric wavelets , directional wavelets , curvelets , or hybrid wavelets ) .",
    "consequently , wssa is very flexible and can be equipped with spherical wavelets appropriate for the texture property of the given spherical data of interest .",
    "wssa needs just a few iterations to converge , and the main computation within each iteration is the pair of forward and backward wavelet transforms .",
    "we applied our wssa method to several real - world problems , i.e. , the earth topographic map , a light probe image , two solar maps , and two projected spherical retina images .",
