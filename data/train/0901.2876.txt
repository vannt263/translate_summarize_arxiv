    "deformed quantum field theories have been subject to renewed attention in recent years due to their natural appearance in string theory .",
    "initial investigations focussed on theories on non - commutative spacetime in which the commutator of the spacetime co - ordinates becomes non - zero .",
    "more recently@xcite , non - anticommutative supersymmetric theories have been constructed by deforming the anticommutators of the grassmann co - ordinates @xmath2 ( while leaving the anticommutators of the @xmath3 unaltered ) .",
    "consequently , the anticommutators of the supersymmetry generators @xmath4 are deformed while those of the @xmath5 are unchanged .",
    "it is straightforward to construct non - anticommutative versions of ordinary supersymmetric theories by taking the superspace action and replacing ordinary products by the moyal @xmath6-product@xcite which implements the non - anticommutativity .",
    "non - anticommutative versions of the wess - zumino model and supersymmetric gauge theories have been formulated in four dimensions@xcite and their renormalisability discussed@xcite , with explicit computations up to two loops@xcite for the wess - zumino model and one loop for gauge theories@xcite .",
    "even more recently , non - anticommutative theories in two dimensions have been constructed@xcite , and their one - loop divergences computed@xcite . in ref .  @xcite we returned to a closer examination of the non - anticommutative wess - zumino model ( with a superpotential ) in four dimensions , and showed that to correctly obtain results for the theory where the auxiliary fields have been eliminated , from the corresponding results for the uneliminated theory ,",
    "it is necessary to include in the classical action separate couplings for all the terms which may be generated by the renormalisation process .",
    "it seems natural to extend the above calculations to the gauged case , for which we seek the simplest possible gauged extension of the wess - zumino model with a ( trilinear ) superpotential .",
    "general gauged non - commutative theories were considered earlier@xcite , and in particular gauged interacting theories in ref .",
    "@xcite ; however there we only considered a trilinear superpotential in the adjoint @xmath7 case , and a mass term in the fundamental @xmath8 case .",
    "the simplest model with a trilinear superpotential is the three - field wess - zumino model with a @xmath1 gauge invariance , and it is this model we shall consider here . we shall consider the one - loop renormalisation of this model in its entirety ; the divergent contributions in the absence of a superpotential can be extracted from refs .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , while even some of the contributions with a superpotential may be extracted from ref .",
    "@xcite by judicious adaptation of the results there presented for the case of the fundamental @xmath8 case with mass terms ; while a number of the divergent contributions will require a fresh diagrammatic computation .",
    "we start by considering the uneliminated theory and then proceed to compare with the results from the corresponding theory with the auxiliary fields eliminated .",
    "in this section we shall give the action for an @xmath0 supersymmetric @xmath1 gauge theory coupled to chiral matter with a superpotential@xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "this is obtained by the reduction to components of the deformed , i.e. non - anticommutative , action in superspace .",
    "a @xmath1 gauge - invariant superpotential requires at least three chiral fields ; we shall take exactly three , with scalar , fermion , auxiliary components denoted @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 .",

    "we require q_1+q_2+q_3=0 , [ anom1 ] while anomaly cancellation leads to q_1 q_2 q_3=0 [ anom2 ] so that the allowed set of charges is in fact @xmath22 .",
    "this means that in fact the most general trilinear superpotential is in fact @xmath23 ( assuming @xmath24 to be the neutral field ) .",
    "we choose , however , to retain @xmath25 and to present formulae in a manner explicitly symmetric under @xmath13 permutations ; for example for later convenience we denote q = q_1 ^ 2+q_2 ^ 2+q_3 ^ 2 .",
    "note also that it follows from eqs .",
    "( [ anom1]),([anom2 ] )  that superpotential mass terms are allowed in general ; however as remarked earlier we will restrict ourselves to the massless case .",
    "it is interesting to note that the constraints eqs .",

    "the divergent terms which can arise subject to these invariances , for the massless @xmath1 case and suppressing the @xmath39 subscripts , consist of ( in addition to those already present in the action ) |c|^2 f^2 ^ 2 , |c|^2 f^4 , ^2|c|^2 ^6 , |c|^2 ^ 3 .",

    "we use the standard gauge - fixing term s_gf = d^4x ( .a)^2 with its associated ghost terms .",
