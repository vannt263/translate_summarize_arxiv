    "furthermore , it was found that , although the trends of @xmath2 in the experimental and the simulated data were identical , differences in the absolute values were observed .",
    "these differences were found to be caused by the presence of interface states at the metal - oxide - semiconductor interface of the experimental devices @xcite .",
    "these states can trap electrons and enhance the presence of screening , therefore reducing the action of the gate on the channel , and as a final result , a decrease in the absolute value of @xmath2 in the experimental data is observed .",

    "the comparison between the values of @xmath0 obtained with our two methods and between our results and the results obtained using a method implemented in the past @xcite show similar trend . a new approach to trap density metrology is of critical importance as cmos scaling leads device dimensions into nanometer regime . at these scales ,",
