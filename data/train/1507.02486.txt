    "it is observationally evident that energies of cosmic rays ( cr ) range from several gev , to thousands of eev , therefore the major question concerns the origin of such enormous energies . generally speaking it",
    "is strongly believed that gamma ray bursts ( grb ) , agn and pulsars might be responsible for high and ultra - high energy ( uhe ) crs . in this context one of the puzzling and enigmatic problems ,",
    "is a concrete mechanism that provides efficient acceleration . in the last century fermi",
    "has proposed a mechanism ( fermi acceleration ) [ 1 ] , that in most of the astrophysical scenarios works very well .",
    "although , acceleration of leptons might encounter serious problems concerning pre - acceleration [ 2 - 3 ] and in certain cases it is necessary to find alternative ways of acceleration .",
    "it is worth noting that agn and pulsars have rapidly rotating magnetospheres that potentially might significantly influence dynamics of charged particles . for typical agn with mass @xmath2 ( @xmath3 is the solar mass ) the equipartition magnetic field is of the order of @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the bolometric luminosity of agn , @xmath6 is the light cylinder radius , @xmath7 is the distance from the black hole and we have taken into account that the angular velocity of rotation of the agn magnetosphere is given by @xmath8 generally speaking , magnetic field is thought to be huge if its energy density exceeds that of plasmas @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the particle number density and @xmath11 is energy of a single particle . from the above expression it is clear that in agn magnetospheres corotation of particles takes place up to @xmath12gev .",
    "similarly , by taking into account the magnetic field of pulsars close to the light cylinder area @xmath13 and the goldreich - julian number density of electrons , @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the pulsar period , @xmath16 is the speed of light and @xmath17 is the electron s charge , one can straightforwardly show that condition of corotation ( see eq .",
    "( [ corot ] ) ) is satisfied for a broad range of energies .",
    "we see that corotation is maintained up to the light cylinder surface in the magnetospheres of agn and pulsars . therefore , it is interesting to estimate efficiency of a centrifugal mechanism developed in [ 4 ] . in particular , in [ 2 ] and [ 5 ] we have studied efficiency of centrifugal acceleration in the magnetospheres of agn and pulsars respectively .",
    "dynamics has been studied for electrons `` sliding '' along corotating straight magnetic field lines inclined with respect to the rotation axis .",
    "it has been shown that the lorentz factors behave as to be @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the initial lorentz factor of the electron .",
    "it is clear from the above equation that on the light cylinder it behaves asymptotically , indicating the existence of certain limiting factors . in general",
    "one can show that acceleration lasts until the particle encounters a soft photon , limiting the maximum attainable energy ( inverse compton ( ic ) mechanism ) [ 2 ] @xmath20 where @xmath21 g is electron s mass , @xmath5 is the bolometric luminosity of a source and @xmath22@xmath23 is the thomson cross - section .",
    "another mechanism that potentially might limit the maximum energies of electrons is the so called breakdown of the bead on the wire ( bbw ) approximation , leading to the following upper limit [ 2 ] @xmath24    it is clear that the real maximum attainable lorentz factor should satisfy the condition @xmath25 , which for agn leads to the maximum energy of the order of @xmath26tev [ 2 ] and in case of crab - like pulsars the value is even less @xmath27tev [ 5 ] .",
    "as we see direct centrifugal acceleration has limits and can not explain ultra - high energies of cosmic rays .",
    "in this section we consider a slightly moderate mechanism of acceleration . in particular , in [ 6,7",
    "] we have shown that rotation energy might be very efficiently pumped into that of langmuir waves . on the next stage , under certain conditions , energy of electrostatic modes might be converted into energy of plasma particles .    in this approach",
    "magnetospheric plasmas are considered to be composed of two species : relatively low energy particles and high energy particles .",
    "the process is governed by the system of equations : euler equation , continuity equation and poisson equation , which after fourier transforming in time lead to the `` dispersion relation '' of the centrifugally excited electrostatic modes [ 8 ] @xmath28 where @xmath29 are the relativistic plasma frequencies , @xmath30 are the lorentz factors , @xmath31 - masses for the corresponding components respectively , @xmath32 , @xmath33 is half of the phase difference between different species , @xmath34 is the bessel function of the first kind and @xmath35 for electron - proton plasmas and @xmath36 for electron - positron plasmas .",
    "the growth rate of the instability is given by @xmath37 where @xmath38 .",
    "for typical values of magnetospheric parameters of agn : @xmath39 , @xmath40 one can straightforwardly show that @xmath41 is less than the kinematic timescale , @xmath42 .",
    "the similar situation is found in the case of pulsars , indicating that the energy pumping from rotation into langmuir waves is extremely efficient .    for these waves to effectively transfer their energy to particles",
    ", the waves phase velocity must be close to the speed of light .",
    "further , in the vicinity of @xmath43 , there should be more particles a little slower than the wave than particles which are a little faster .",
    "for the given problem it is always possible to situate @xmath43 in the desired part of the primary beam spectrum .",
    "since the distribution function decreases with the lorentz factor , the number of electrons with @xmath44 exceeds that of the electrons with @xmath45 , where @xmath46 denotes the electron speed .",
    "thus the optimum conditions for effective landau damping will pertain .",
    "it has been shown that the total energy gained by the beam electrons in magnetospheres of pulsars is given by [ 9 ] @xmath47 where @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 .",
    "it has been shown that the crab - like pulsars might provide with energies of the order @xmath51tev , whereas in the magnetospheres of newly born millisecond pulsars electrons might be accelerated up to @xmath0ev .",
    "since the agn magnetospheres are predominantly composed of protons and electrons , it has been found that the efficient langmuir collapse develops after centrifugally inducing electrostatic waves .",
    "this process leads to even higher accumulation of energy , finally transformed to energy of protons via the landau damping .",
    "the corresponding expression of proton energy is given by @xmath52 where @xmath53erg / s is the dimensioneless luminosity of agn .",
    "as it is clear the present mechanism can explain energies of cosmic rays",
    ". therefore , it would be interesting to further develop our model to apply for neutrino astrophysics .",
    "the research was partially supported by the shota rustaveli national science foundation grant ( n31/49 ) ."
