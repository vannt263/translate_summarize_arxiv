    "as already mentioned in the main text , in many publications where qst is performed the standard error bar is calculated by bootstrapping based on monte carlo methods .",

    "let us give the following illustrative example , see also fig .",
    "[ fig : cr ] :     then clearly the left one represents the smallest one , but if @xmath145 is chosen , then the right one is much better than the projected left one . ]    let us consider the task to obtain a cr for the two mean values @xmath146 of two independent gaussian experiments , where the first @xmath147 samples @xmath148 are drawn from @xmath149 while the remaining @xmath147 instances",
