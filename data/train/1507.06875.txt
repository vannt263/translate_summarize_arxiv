    "we now have a compelling set of evidence for the existence of some form of cold , non - baryonic dark matter exerting gravitational influence from astronomical to cosmological scales . elucidating",
    "the microscopic nature of the dark matter is one of the most pressing challenges in physics .",
    "this important open question connects particle physics and cosmology .",
    "it is likely that future progress in one field will proceed from the advance in the other . among the countless theories to explain the dark matter ,",
    "two broad classes can be distinguished : wimps and wisps .",
    "wimps are weakly interacting massive particles , with a typical mass in the gev to tev range .",
    "they are still actively searched for by direct detection with low background detectors burried underground .",
    "alternatively , the particle could be produced at the lhc in high energy proton - proton collisions , it is looked for in events with large missing energy .",
    "wisps are weakly interacting slim particles whose mass can be much less than 1 ev ( see @xcite for recent reviews ) .",
    "this type of dark matter is necessarily bosonic , since the pauli exclusion principle forbids fermions to condense above a certain density , the so - called tremaine - gunn bound @xcite .",
    "possibly , these bosonic fields are produced in the early universe via the vacuum misalignment mechanism @xcite .",
    "they behave very much like classical fields , oscillating at a frequency @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the mass of the bosonic field .",
    "although the particles are very light as compared to the temperature of the early universe , the field behaves as cold dark matter .",
    "more precisely , the equation of state of the energy density stored in the oscillations is the same as that of pressureless dust .",
    "the scenario of dark matter as a condensate of very light bosons has mostly been discussed in the framework of the qcd axion , a spin 0 field invented to solve the strong cp problem @xcite .",
    "theory predicts that dark matter axions could be converted into microwave photons in the presence of an external magnetic field .",
    "haloscopes , i.e. devices realizing this conversion such as admx @xcite , are probing a large portion of plausible axion masses and couplings .    recently , another form of wispy dark matter has been proposed by nelson and scholtz @xcite .",
    "the scenario consists in adding a new vector field associated with a hidden @xmath6 gauge symmetry called the dark photon .",
    "the energy stored in the oscillations of this field would constitute the dark matter . in this letter",
    "we explore the possibility of detecting these oscillations using precise magnetometers .",
    "the proposed technique could be applied in a broad frequency domain ranging from @xmath2  hz to @xmath7  khz , corresponding to dark photon masses in the range @xmath0 - @xmath8  ev .",
    "it is thus complementary to the newly proposed search with a dish antenna in the radio domain @xcite .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section [ dark photon ]",
    "we review the dark photon dark matter scenario and derive the expected magnetic signal . in section [ voyager ]",
    "we set a bound on the kinetic mixing @xmath9 using the magnetometric data recorded by the two voyager interplanetary missions .",
    "then , the sensitivity of a dedicated measurement with squid magnetometers is discussed in section [ conclusion ] .",
    "we consider an extension of standard electrodynamics with an additional spin 1 field @xmath10 @xcite , defined by the lagrangian density @xmath11 where @xmath12 represents the field strength of the ordinary photon field @xmath13 , @xmath14 is the usual current of charged fermions , and @xmath15 is the field strength of the new boson of mass @xmath5 .",
    "the name of the new boson is not unique in the litterature , it was first referred to as a _",
    "paraphoton _ , then more recently as",
    "_ hidden photon _ or _",
    "dark photon_. since we are regarding the new field as a dark matter candidate we choose to use the latter name .",
    "the dark photon couples to the rest of the world through the kinetic mixing term with the dimensionless coupling @xmath9 .",
    "string - inspired extensions of the standard model of particle physics typically predict a value for @xmath9 in the range @xmath16 @xcite . by making the transformation",
    "@xmath17 it is apparent that a particle of charge @xmath18 for the usual photon has a suppressed effective charge of @xmath19 for the dark photon .",
    "the classical equations of motion for the dark photon field admit oscillating solutions of the form @xmath20 where @xmath21 are complex amplitudes .",
    "the corresponding complex amplitude for the dark electric field @xmath22 is @xmath23 .",
    "the energy density stored in the oscillation is @xmath24 . in terms of the electric field , in si units we have @xmath25    following nelson and scholtz",
    "@xcite we attribute the energy density of dark matter to the oscillations of the dark photon .",
    "we use the canonical value of @xmath26 @xcite for the local dark matter density and find @xmath27 .",
    "this dark electric field oscillates in the rest frame of the dark matter .",
    "our motion relative to the halo induces a motional dark magnetic field with complex amplitude given by @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the relative velocity of the earth in the halo , that we assume to point to the cygnus constellation .",
    "we use the canonical value for solar velocity @xmath30 .    the dark magnetic field couples to the usual electric charges with the coupling constant scaled by @xmath31 .",
    "in other terms , we should search for a magnetic field @xmath32 , oscillating at the frequency @xmath33 , in a plane transverse to @xmath29 , with an amplitude of @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the angle between our velocity @xmath29 and the direction of the dark electric field .",
    "in order to search for the signal described above in the low - frequency regime ( about @xmath2 hz or a mass of around @xmath36 ev ) , we looked for long - running magnetic experiments in low noise environments .",
    "one such experiment is the voyager program .",
    "the two voyager probes were constructed by the jet propulsion laboratory and launched in 1977 . among many other instruments",
    ", they carried triaxial fluxgate magnetometers @xcite .",
    "the last planet encountered by voyager 1 was saturn in 1980 , whereas voyager 2 s last flyby was above neptune in 1989 . between these events and their arrival at the termination shock , respectively in 2004 for voyager 1 and in 2007 for voyager 2 , the probes were deep in interplanetary space .",
    "( apical ) axis , the middle figure along the @xmath37 axis and the bottom figure along the @xmath38 axis . for readability ,",
    "only one in ten points is actually shown . ]",
    "the data set running from 1990 to 2011 presented a noise below 1 nt and was very well suited to our needs .",
    "the magnetic field seen by both probes during their entire flight is presented in figure [ showtime ] . from now on",
    ", we will exclusively use magnetic data taken between 1990 and 2011 .",
    "the data were taken from the goddard space flight center s omniweb and ftp services .",
    "it consists of triaxial hourly samples of the external magnetic field .",
    "these values are given in rtn coordinates ( radial tangential normal ) ; it is then necessary to transform them into a referential more adapted to our aims .",
    "there is clearly a preferred direction which is along the speed of the probes in the galactic referential ; this direction is essentially that of the speed of the sun in the galaxy , also known as the _ solar apex_. along this axis , there can be no signal from the dark photon , and thus the corresponding magnetometric data component can be used to discriminate oscillations resulting from sources other than the dark photon .",
    "this direction is called the _ apical direction _ or @xmath39 axis , the plane orthogonal to it is called the _ transverse _ plane .",
    "we have then selected two other axes in order to get a direct trihedron ; those are arbitrary in the sense that our results will not depend on this choice .",
    "we call them the @xmath37 and @xmath38 axes . for our purposes",
    ", we have chosen a @xmath37 axis in the galactic plane , pointing in the direction of positive galactic longitude and orthogonal to the solar apex , and a @xmath38 axis completing the orthonormal coordinate system . in order to use the data of both probes",
    ", we will work with the mean of the magnetic values of voyager 1 and voyager 2 for each hour and each axis .",
    "the magnetic values in the tranverse plane are coded into a complex number of form @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the component of the field along the @xmath37 axis seen by voyager 1 at sample time number n , and other values are labeled accordingly .",
    "we then compute the discrete fourier transform of this signal , given by : @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the fourier transform , @xmath44 is the signal described above , and @xmath45 is the number of points considered in the transform .",
    "once we have this result , it is easy to get the noise spectral density of the signal , given by @xmath46 , with @xmath47 the sampling period and @xmath48 the total duration of the acquisition . since the noise density depends only on the module of the fourier transform , it is independant of the explicit choice of the @xmath37 and @xmath38 axes .",
    "the results are given in the figure [ fftvy1 ] .",
    "it is immediately apparent that there is a one day period ( @xmath49 hz ) signal in the data , along with associated harmonics .",
    "this is by no means a sign of the dark photon , as the same periodicity appears in the apical field .",
    "this peculiar oscillation stems from the values missing in the record .",
    "the figure [ missingdata ] presents a simulated case with a @xmath50 ev and @xmath51 dark photon , with distorsion induced by the points missing on the record .",
    "the expected mass peak at @xmath52 hz is present , but we see 24-hour components and associated harmonics arising as well . those frequencies remain even if we get rid of any signal and simply fill any non - missing data with a constant value .",
    "thus , we can safely assume that those peaks are just an artifact .",
    "we can observe that other than these previously mentioned frequencies , no significant peak can be seen .     and distorsion induced by the missing data . ]",
    "the next step is then to determine an exclusion limit of the values of @xmath53 .",
    "since the noise level varies with the frequency , no single criterion of exclusion can be used on the integrality of the bandwidth .",
    "instead , we compute a moving average of the noise spectral density by blocks of 200 points ( corresponding to a bandwidth of @xmath54 hz ) , along with the standard deviation of these blocks .",
    "having verified that the noise is gaussian in nature , with 95 % confidence , we exclude any signal with a given frequency and an amplitude larger than the mean at this frequency plus two standard deviations . for low frequencies ,",
    "this method is inadapted , as the noise levels vary greatly from one point to the next .",
    "for the 200 first points ( from @xmath55 hz to @xmath54 hz ) , we exclude any signal greater than the noise spectral density of the data at a given frequency plus two times the standard deviation of these 200 first points . in order to do that",
    ", we simulate a dark photon oscillating signal with an arbitrary frequency and a value of the coupling parameter @xmath9 set to 1 , and we compute the noise spectral density , which has a maximum value of @xmath56 .",
    "this density does not depend on the mass of the particle to first order , and is linear in @xmath9 , which allows us to transform the previous limit on the noise density into a limit on @xmath53 .",
    "the final limit is represented on figure [ limite ] , compared to expected limits from other experiments . for completeness",
    ", the same analysis has been extended to the apical field ; results are given in table [ effectivefields ] in the form of constraints on the effective field amplitudes .",
    "as a function of the mass of the dark photon .",

    "constraints ( at 95 % c. l. ) on the amplitude of an oscillating magnetic field in apical and transverse directions in the frequency range accessible with voyager magnetic data . [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ effectivefields ]",
    "we have shown that precision magnetometry could be used to search for the dark photon , a newly proposed form of dark matter . in this scenario ,",
    "the dark matter is attributed to the coherent oscillation of the new field , which acts as a pseudo magnetic field due to our motion in the halo .",
    "the very long magnetic records from the voyager 1 and 2 space probes were used to set competitive limits in the mass range @xmath57 ev to @xmath58 ev , corresponding to frequencies between about @xmath2 hz and @xmath3 hz .",
    "interestingly , this covers the scenario known as fuzzy dark matter @xcite . with 95 % confidence",
    ", we can exclude values of the coupling parameter @xmath9 as low as @xmath59 for the highest masses , which represents the best limit for this range of frequencies .    in the future ,",
    "a natural development would be to look at somewhat shorter periods .",
    "it is sensible to propose exploration of such periods ( from the year to the millisecond ) with a similar approach , using squid ( superconducting quantum interference device ) magnetometry .",
    "using noise data published in henry _",
    "@xcite , which gives a noise spectral density of @xmath60 above 1 hz and of @xmath61 , we suppose a data acquisition for a time of one month and that we can see a signal if its noise spectral density is two times as large as that of the ambient noise .",
    "we can then expect a sensitivity as low as @xmath62 .",
    "the predicted limit is entitled `` squid magnetometry '' in figure [ limite ] . more generally , any precision magnetometry experiment , for example a clock comparison experiment @xcite , could be adapted to search for these oscillations .",
