    "a memoryless quantum communication channel makes the fundamental assumption that the noise between consecutive uses of the channel is independent . in many real - world applications this assumption may be good , but for many others the noise may be strongly correlated between uses of the channel . such a possibility has been recently put forward in channels with continuous alphabet , specifically lossy bosonic channels @xcite .",
    "the main motivation that has led to investigate memory effects in such channels has been the possibility to enhance their classical capacity by means of entangled inputs @xcite .",
    "lossy bosonic channels belong to the class of gaussian channels which play a prominent role because it might be simple enough to be analytically tractable , thus providing a fertile testing ground for the general theory of quantum capacities @xcite .",
    "another example of gaussian channel is provided by a channel that adds thermal noise to the input .",
    "for that channel it has been recently proved that entangled inputs enhance the 2-shot classical capacity in presence of correlated noise @xcite .    here",
    "we present an extension of the model used in ref.@xcite , that can be employed for an arbitrary number of channel uses .",
    "the memory effect is modeled by assuming that the noise affecting subsequent uses of the channel follows a gaussian distribution with correlation introduced by contiguous two - mode interactions .",
    "we show that if the memory is non - zero and the input energy constraint is satisfied , the channel transmission rate can be improved by entangled input states instead of product states .",
    "moreover , we notice the appearance of an asymptotic value of the transmission rate after many uses of the channel that should lead to the full capacity of the channel .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sect.ii and iii , we review the basic notions about bosonic channels and gaussian channels with additive classical noise . in sect.iv",
    "we describe the action of the memory .",
    "finally , in sect.v we analyze the transmission rate of this channel and discuss our results .",
    "a bosonic channel is any completely positive and trace preserving map acting on the state of a mode of electromagnetic field . on multiple uses of that channel",
    "one has to account for many of such modes .",
    "let us consider @xmath0 of them associated with @xmath0 pairs of annihilation and creation operators @xmath1 and @xmath2 ( satisfying the canonical commutation relation ) , or equivalently of quadrature components @xmath3 and @xmath4 . ordering these in a column vector @xmath5 ^{t } , \\label{er}\\ ] ]",
    "we may define the mean vector @xmath6 and the covariance matrix @xmath7 of an @xmath0-mode state @xmath8 as @xmath9 @xmath10-\\frac{1}{2}\\mathcal{j } , \\label{calv}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 is the symplectic matrix , with @xmath12 the @xmath13 identity matrix .    if the state @xmath8 is gaussian is completely characterized by the mean vector @xmath6 and the covariance matrix @xmath7 .",
    "moreover , its von neumann entropy is given by @xcite @xmath14 where @xmath15 are the symplectic eigenvalues of the covariance matrix @xmath16 , that is the solutions of the equation @xmath17 = 0 , \\label{char}\\ ] ] and @xmath18 is the entropy of a thermal state with a mean photon number @xmath19 .",
    "let us now consider the classical use of a bosonic channel described by a completely positive and trace preserving map @xmath20 : @xmath21 , \\label{mapt}\\ ] ] then , quantum states carry the values of a random classical variable .",
    "quite generally we could think to map phase space points into quantum states , hence for each mode we consider two real random values ( or one complex ) .",
    "we then label an input state over @xmath0 modes ( uses ) as @xmath22 with @xmath23 .",
    "the coding theorem for quantum channels asserts that the classical capacity of the bosonic channel @xmath20 is given by @xmath24 \\right)\\right .",
    "\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\left.\\quad\\qquad -\\int p({d^{2n}\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\alpha$}})s\\left ( t\\left [ \\rho _ { \\mbox{\\boldmath$\\alpha$}}\\right ] \\right ) \\right ] , \\label{cap}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 denotes the von neumann entropy and @xmath26 is a probability measure .    in eq.([cap ] ) , the maximum is taken over all probability measures @xmath27 and collections of density operators @xmath28 satisfying the energy constraint @xmath29 with  @xmath30 the maximum mean photon number per mode at the input of the channel .",
    "consider now a specific bosonic channel @xmath20 acting as follows @xmath31=\\int d^{2n } \\mbox{\\boldmath$\\beta$}\\ q ( \\mbox{\\boldmath$\\beta$})\\ d ( \\mbox{\\boldmath$\\beta$})\\rho_{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\alpha$}}^{in } d^\\dagger ( \\mbox{\\boldmath$\\beta$ } ) , \\label{outexp}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 with @xmath33 denoting the displacement operator on the @xmath34th mode , @xmath35 .",
    "this is known as _",
    "gaussian channel with additive classical noise _ once the kernel is gaussian , e.g. @xmath36 in such a case the channel randomly displaces each input state according to a gaussian distribution , which results in a thermal state ( @xmath37 is the variance of the added noise on the quadrature components @xmath38 and @xmath39 , or , equivalently the number of thermal photons added per mode by the channel ) .",
    "since for gaussian channels it is conjectured that gaussian inputs allow to achieve the capacity @xcite , let us consider to encode @xmath40 into coherent input states @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the vacuum states of the @xmath0 modes .",
    "moreover , suppose that the state ( [ rhoin ] ) is drawn with probability @xmath44 then the output states and their average read @xmath45,\\\\ \\overline{\\rho}^{out}&=&\\int d^{2n } \\mbox{\\boldmath$\\alpha$}\\ p ( \\mbox{\\boldmath$\\alpha$ } ) \\rho_{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\alpha$}}^{out}. \\label{outave}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the gaussian map effected by the gaussian channel ( [ outexp ] ) , in case of gaussian input state , can be solely characterized by the covariance matrices .",
    "that is @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the input covariance matrix . for the states of eq.([rhoin ] ) , it is @xmath48    we could also consider the possibility of entangled input states . these can be accounted for by the transformation @xmath49 that uses the multimode squeezing operator @xcite @xmath50 ,   \\label{sigr}\\ ] ] with @xmath51 a symmetric @xmath52 matrix .",
    "thus , the input covariance matrix results @xmath53 let @xmath54 be the average number per mode of squeezed photons added at input , i.e. @xmath55 then , due to the bound ( [ bound ] ) the effective number of photons to input on each mode would be @xmath56 .",
    "now , let us consider memory effects in the gaussian channel with additive classical noise . the output state ( [ outexp ] ) can be seen as the convolution of the input gaussian state ( [ rhoin ] ) with a gaussian thermal state having average number of thermal photons @xmath37 per mode . to introduce correlations in the latter we use arguments from multimode squeezing .",
    "it is physically reasonable that only contiguous uses of the channel would be strongly correlated , thus we introduce the following symmetric matrix @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the parameter measuring the degree of memory . then , we take the added noise as characterized by the covariance matrix @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the diagonal matrix @xmath61_{jj}= n-\\epsilon[\\mathcal{v}_2^n]_{jj},\\ ] ] and @xmath62 in order to realize a physical transformation , the channel must have @xmath63 .",
    "this is clearly satisfied if @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "the first condition determines the range of allowed values for the memory parameter @xmath58 , while the second condition is always satisfied .",
    "the presence of the parameter @xmath66 in eq.([calvn ] ) only deserves as mathematical trick to guarantee the positivity of @xmath67 even in the case of @xmath68 .",
    "it is @xmath69 notice that the noise correlations so introduced are classical and for @xmath70 in eq.([calvn ] ) we recover the memoryless case .",
    "= 6.5cm0.2 cm = 6.5cm0.2 cm = 6.5cm0.2 cm = 6.5cm0.2 cm    for the entangled inputs we consider in eq.([sigr ] ) the symmetric matrix @xmath71 with @xmath72 is the input entanglement parameter .    at the output of the channel , we get states with the covariance matrix @xmath73 in turns , the covariance matrix associated with the mixture of the output states ( [ outave ] ) would be @xmath74 here @xmath75 with @xmath76 a diagonal matrix @xmath77_{jj}= ( \\overline{n}-\\overline{n}_r)-\\theta[\\mathcal{k}_2]_{jj } , \\label{calk1}\\ ] ] and @xmath78 being of the same form of @xmath79 with @xmath80 .",
    "the coefficient @xmath81 accounts for possible classical input correlations .",
    "also in this case we must have @xmath82 .",
    "this is clearly satisfied if @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "the first condition determines the range of allowed values for the parameter @xmath81 , while the second condition is always satisfied .",
    "likewise the parameter @xmath66 in eq.([calvn ] ) , we have introduced in eq.([calk ] ) a parameter @xmath85 that only deserves to guarantee the positivity of @xmath86 when @xmath87 .",
    "it is @xmath88    according to eq.([cap ] ) , the capacity is given by the asymptotical behavior ( @xmath89 ) of the maximum of transmission rate @xmath90 .",
    "\\label{rate1}\\ ] ] since @xmath91 and @xmath92 are both gaussian states , following eq.([srho ] ) we have @xmath93 .\\label{rate2}\\ ] ] thus , in order to evaluate the transmission rate , we need to compute the @xmath0 symplectic values @xmath94 , @xmath95 of @xmath96 , @xmath97 respectively .",
    "the transmission rate of eq.([rate2 ] ) has been evaluated numerically restricting to some cases where @xmath98 .    from fig.[fig1 ] , we notice that when @xmath99 , the optimized rate @xmath100 over @xmath81 increases with the degree of entanglement @xmath72 and attains a maximum at some value @xmath101 , so that the maximum is achieved by entangled input states and is greater than that at @xmath102 .",
    "= 6.5cm0.2 cm    moreover , maximizing @xmath100 with respect to both @xmath72 and @xmath81 allows to find the behavior of the transmission rate versus the number of channel uses @xmath0 ( see fig.[fig2 ] ) .",
    "here we have considered @xmath103 , white , grey and black bars respectively .",
    "unfortunately the evaluation of @xmath100 with larger @xmath0 requires a lot of numerical resources . nonetheless , from fig.[fig2 ] , we can grasp that the transmission rate increases with the number of channel uses @xmath0 , achieving an asymptotic value depending on @xmath58 .",
    "this can also be understood by considering that the rate increases with noise correlations .",
    "initially , they rapidly grow till @xmath0 reaches the relevant number of modes that effectively interact .",
    "in fact , each mode effectively interacts with a limited number of other modes which would be determined ( besides the form of @xmath104 ) by the value of @xmath58 ( the smaller is @xmath58 the smaller is the number of modes that effectively interact ) .",
    "thus the number of uses after which @xmath100 becomes almost constant can be thought as the range of memory effects .    in conclusion ,",
    "we have provided a model to describe memory effects in a gaussian channel with additive classical noise for an arbitrary number of uses .",
    "the model reduces to that of ref.@xcite for only two uses . from our numerical results we guess the existence of an asymptotic value of the transmission rate after many uses of the channel that should lead to the full capacity of the channel .",
    "hence , the 2-shot capacity would not suffice to characterize the channel performances , unless the memory is very weak .",
    "quite generally the minimum number of uses to consider would depend on the strength of the memory , i.e. the correlation length of the noise .    of course",
    "the results found are conditioned to to the validity of the conjecture that gaussian inputs allow to achieve the capacity of a gaussian channel @xcite , however , the presented model for memory effects is always valid and could be extended to include attenuation / amplification besides additive noise .",
