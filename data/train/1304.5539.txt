    "liquid crystals @xcite are formed by anisotropic molecular units and share properties of isotropic liquids and ordered crystals as flow and molecular ordering , respectively .",
    "they can be classified , according to its basic constituents , as thermotropics ( organic molecules ) , lyotropics ( micelles formed by amphiphilic molecules ) @xcite , followed by the polymerics ( polymers ) @xcite and metallotropics ( composed of both organic and inorganic molecules ) @xcite .",
    "the phase transitions in these materials occur by changes in temperature , concentration , or pressure , and various mesophases can be observed , generally identified by different characteristic optical textures @xcite .",
    "the most known liquid - crystalline mesophase is the nematic one , which presents orientational order of its constituents and may have one ( uniaxial ) or two ( biaxial ) optical axes .",
    "the uniaxial nematic mesophase is further classified in _",
    "nematic calamitic _",
    ", when the molecules / micelles are rod shaped , and in _ nematic discotic _",
    ", when the molecules / micelles have the shape of a disc .",
    "one of the ways to characterize this mesophase is via the birefringence ( @xmath5 ) , for instance , when @xmath6 , the liquid - crystalline material shows the nematic mesophase and , if @xmath7 , it shows the isotropic phase .",
    "experimentally , the nematic mesophase can be obtained by decreasing the temperature from the isotropic one .",
    "the ordering process of systems after a phase transition have been largely studied in condensed matter physics @xcite , through theories and experiments .",
    "some of the main aspects of this process is the behaviour of the defects present in the system such as its formation and annihilation .",
    "topological defects can appear whenever there is some sort of ordering .",
    "its ubiquity in nature has been the subject of several studies @xcite in addition to those ones in condensed matter .",
    "here we are interested in topological defects in a more restritive context , one related to liquid crystals @xcite . in this scenario ,",
    "universal behaviours can be identified , for instance , the similarity with defects formed in the early universe has provided studies using a liquid crystal as a cosmological laboratory @xcite . in the liquid - crystalline systems , generally , the defects arise after an isotropic - nematic phase transition , i.e. , a symmetry breaking of isotropic phase @xcite .",
    "the defects in a liquid crystal basically are regions where the director @xmath8 is not defined . in general",
    ", @xmath8 represents the average molecular alignment and shows an inversion symmetry ( @xmath9 ) . due to the birefringence of the liquid - crystalline mesophases , and their extremely small elastic constants , they are ideal materials to study the defects dynamics experimentally , because the defect s motion can be followed in real - time through polarized optical light microscopy technique on practical spatial and temporal scales .",
    "much of the reported experimental work about the annihilation of defects @xcite was made using thermotropic liquid crystals , where stringlike defects , pointlike defects , and defects loop were analyzed . in thermotropic polyester materials ,",
    "the annihilation of defects have been observed too @xcite .",
    "the annihilation of defects has also been analyzed in numeric simulations @xcite .",
    "however , an experimental investigation of this matter on lyotropic liquid crystals is an open question yet . in the direction to fill this gap",
    ", we used a lyotropic liquid crystal ( kl - deoh - deionized / destilated h@xmath10o ) at nematic calamitic phase to analyze the annihilation dynamics of stringlike defects .",
    "we produced the defects by a temperature quench , and focused our attention in the evolution of the distance between defects in process of annihilation . in order to accomplish our goal",
    ", the polarized light optical microscopy technique was used .",
    "we divided our work as follows : basic theoretical aspects are showed in section [ theory ] ; the description of the experiment is in section [ exp ] ; and the results and discussion are presented in section [ resdis ] . the last section ( section [ conc ] ) is devoted to the conclusions .",
    "one typical liquid - crystalline texture , called _ schlieren _ texture , obtained by the polarized optical light microscopy technique , displays brushes that converge at singular points @xcite , in a bi - dimensional configuration ( figure [ schlieren ] ) .",
    "these singular points represent topological defects of different types and signs @xcite , which are characterized according to the arrangement of @xmath8 in the vicinity of the singularities .",
    "the director configuration around a defect can be studied from the elastic energy density , called frank s energy density @xcite , @xmath11 ^ 2 + \\frac{1}{2 } k_{22}[\\vec{n } \\cdot ( \\nabla \\times \\vec{n})]^2 + \\frac{1}{2 } k_{33 } [ \\vec{n } \\times ( \\nabla \\times \\vec{n})]^2,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 represent the splay , twist , and bend elastic constants respectively .",
    "these constants , which are positives , have dimension of energy per length and are temperature dependent .",
    "its typical values are about 10@xmath15 _ dynas _ for both thermotropic @xcite and lyotropic @xcite liquid crystals .",
    "considering @xmath8 in two dimensions , the solution that minimizes the free energy described in equation ( [ eq1 ] ) , usually obtained by assuming the one - constant approximation for the elastic constants ( @xmath16 ) , is given by @xmath17 this solution is correct from the point of view of symmetries and assumes the defect at the origin of @xmath18-@xmath19 plane , with the @xmath20-axis perpendicular .",
    "@xmath21 is the angle between @xmath8 and @xmath18 axis , and @xmath22 is given by @xmath23 .",
    "@xmath24 changes from 0 to @xmath25 @xcite . the @xmath8 orientation changes by @xmath26 on going round the singularity .",
    "the @xmath27 parameter represents the defect s type ( topological charge or strength of the defect ) , assuming values of @xmath28 , but only defects of strength @xmath29 and @xmath30 are generally observed @xcite .",
    "usually , defects with @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) are referred as stringlike ( pointlike ) defects . by convention ,",
    "if @xmath27 is positive ( negative ) , the singularity is a _ defect _ ( an _ antidefect _ ) .",
    "figure [ sketch ] shows a sketch of the possible director configurations around a defect .",
    "note that , at the center of the defect , there is a region known as _",
    "defect s core _ with size of approximately @xmath33 @xcite . in general , in a thermotropic liquid crystal , the defects are mostly pointlike ( figure [ thermo ] ) and identified by four brushes meeting in a point of the _ schlieren _ textures @xcite . in the lyotropics , stringlike defects ( figure [ lyo ] )",
    "are more common and are identified by two brushes meeting in a point of the _ schlieren _ textures @xcite .",
    "as one can see from figure [ schlieren ] , both types of defects are connected via the brushes .",
    "note also that the sum over all defect s strengths @xmath27 of a sample tends to zero , leading to a law of conservation of the topological charge @xcite .",
    "the defects distribution is dynamic .",
    "in fact , defects of equal strength and opposite sign attract each other going toward mutual annihilation .",
    "theoretically , as indicated in the @xcite , by using dimensional analysis for two dimensional systems with topological defects , lifschitz indicated that the scaling law for annihilating defects goes as or slower than @xmath34 , where @xmath1 is the time remaining for the annihilation .",
    "more recently , it was obtained equations for the separation @xmath0 between a defect and an antidefect as a function of @xmath1 .",
    "this was made starting from the equation of motion for an isolated defect - antidefect pair , which follows from equating the attractive and frictional forces acting on each defect . if the elastic attractive force is taken to be @xcite @xmath35 , and the frictional one is taken to be @xcite @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the defect s velocity , one obtains @xmath38 ( see , for instance , pargellis and co - authors @xcite ) .",
    "other behaviours for @xmath39 slower than @xmath34 can be obtained considering corrections to the above forces ( see , for instance , yurke and co - authors @xcite ) .    as we shall see in the discussion , numerical simulations and experimental results for liquid crystals @xcite support that the annihilation defect - antidefect is well adjusted by the scaling law @xmath40 where @xmath41 is a constant and @xmath1 is time remaining for the annihilation . here , we intend to obtain experimentally the scaling exponent in equation ( [ eq4 ] ) for the annihilation of such pairs in the lyotropic liquid crystal specified in section [ exp ] .",
    "the liquid crystal used in our analysis was the ternary lyotropic mixture formed by potassium laurate ( kl ) , decanol ( deoh ) and deionized / destiled water ( h@xmath10o ) , with the following concentrations in weight percent : kl @xmath42 27.49% , deoh @xmath42 6.24% and h@xmath10o @xmath42 66.27% .",
    "when an abrupt change of the free energy of the system occurs , defects are usually formed .",
    "this abrupt change can be induced , for instance , by pressure @xcite , temperature quenches @xcite , and external fields @xcite . in this work , we investigated the annihilation of defect - antidefect pairs formed due to a temperature quench . here ,",
    "only the bulk of the sample was investigated , i.e. , the defects analyzed had no influence of the anchoring energy @xcite .",
    "the technique employed to observe the defects was the polarized optical light microscopy @xcite .",
    "the sample was placed in a glass capillary with 100@xmath43 m light path and , to avoid changes in the mixture concentration , its borders were sealed with a paraffin film followed by a nail polish coat . then , the sample was analyzed between crossed polarizers in an optical microscope leica dm2500p ( 5@xmath44 objective and 10@xmath44 ocular ) connected to a charge coupled device ( ccd ) camera dfc290 .",
    "the laboratory frame axes were defined as follows : @xmath18 is the long axis of the glass capillary and @xmath20 is the axis normal to its largest surface .",
    "the heating of the sample was controlled by using a hotstage with a x - y micropositioner ( instec - hcs302 , @xmath45 of precision ) connected to a computer and , for the cooling , we used a water bath ( accuracy of @xmath45 ) .",
    "the glass capillary was put in the hotstage around @xmath46 . at this temperature",
    ", the sample presents a nematic calamitic texture .",
    "thereafter , the temperature was increased up to @xmath47 in order to reach the isotropic phase . to obtain the desired phase transition ( around @xmath48 )",
    ", we made a quench to return to a temperature around @xmath46 .",
    "after about 5 hours , the topological defects became pronounced , that is , they were well visualized with ccd camera .",
    "figure [ lyo ] shows a typical texture of the lyotropic mixture presenting the defects .",
    "the dark brushes in figure [ lyo ] are regions where the mean micellar alignment is parallel or perpendicular to the plane of polarization of the incident light .",
    "the procedure to analyze the annihilation dynamics was to take a sequence of photos in a specific region of the glass capillary until the maximum of annihilations of defect - antidefect pairs were carried out .",
    "the data acquisition was focused on the position of the annihilating defects in the picture .",
    "the time intervals of 60 , 90 , 120 , 150 , 240 , 300 and 600 seconds between each photograph were used .",
    "we considered annihilations ocurred from 5340 s to 119 700 s remaining for the end of the process .",
    "the resolution of the photographs was 1024 @xmath44 768 pixels .",
    "+    as pointed before , individual defects of opposite sign attract each other and approach for an eventual annihilation .",
    "figure [ photoseq ] shows a typical texture sequence of approximation and annihilation of stringlike defects used for the determination of exponent @xmath41 in equation ( [ eq4 ] ) .",
    "sequences of the same type were made for 49 initial configurations .",
    "note that , after the annihilation , no defect remains in the region , showing that , indeed , the process occurs between a defect and an antidefect , i.e. , @xmath49 , where @xmath50 represents a state without defects , exemplifying the conservation of the total topological charge @xmath51 @xcite .",

    "for these cases , the initial time @xmath1 was approximately 24000 seconds , the initial distance around 0.24 mm , and the time interval between the photos was 120 seconds . for distances lower than a few tenths of milimeters ,",

    "shiwaku and co - authors @xcite , using thin films of main - chain - type thermotropic liquid - crystalline copolyester , found an exponent 0.35 for the annihilation between stringlike defects . in 1991 , pargellis and co - authors @xcite , employing the thermotropic liquid crystal k15 , found @xmath54 ; chuang and co - authors @xcite obtained @xmath55 by using the k15 liquid crystal .",
    "the exponent 0.5 was also found by pargellis and co - authors @xcite in 1992 for the annihilation between pointlike defects in a smectic thermotropic liquid crystal , but in the late stage , the exponent deviates towards a linear dependence with time . in 1993 , chuang and co - authors @xcite also obtained the exponent 0.50 @xmath56 0.03 for the defect loop collapse in a thermotropic ( 5cb ) liquid crystal . in 1994 , ding and thomas @xcite also obtained @xmath57 for the annihilation of pointlike defects in a thermotropic liquid crystal polyester . in 1996 , pargellis and co - authors @xcite , now employing a thermotropic nematic known as e7 , found that the distance between a pointlike defect pair in annihilation decreases as @xmath58 . in 1997 ,",
    "minoura and co - authors @xcite observed in a thermotropic 5cb that , in the late stage , the annihilation between pointlike defects goes with @xmath59 . in 1998",
    "@xcite , they verified that this last result is independent of the alignment in the nematic cell ; wang and co - authors @xcite found , for the shrinkage and annihilation of defects loop in a thermotropic liquid crystal polyester , that the radius @xmath60 of the defect is given by @xmath61 . in 2005 , dierking and co - authors @xcite , using a thermotropic liquid crystal , found that the distance between umbilical defects in annihilation decrease with @xmath62 . in summary , except in the work of shiwaku @xcite , an exponent around 0.5 seems to appear in most studies , and all of which were made in thermotropic or thermotropic polyesters liquid crystals .",
    "the annihilation between defects and the respective exponent associated has also been investigated through computer simulations .",
    "as mentioned before , in 1991 , pargellis and co - authors @xcite call attention for a scaling solution for the separation between a pointlike defect - antidefect pair as @xmath63 , using the nematodynamic equations @xcite and a model of forces in equilibrium @xmath64 .",
    "in 1992 , blundell and bray @xcite investigated the effect of the modified symmetry in nematic liquid crystals on the ordering dynamics employing a model defined by @xmath65 , where @xmath22 represents the director , and found , for three dimensions , that the characteristic length goes as @xmath66 and the exponent decreases at later times . in 1993 ,",
    "yurke and co - authors @xcite presented evidences that the coalescence of a point defect pair goes as @xmath67 when the defect s size dependence is taken into account in its mobility . in 1995 ,",
    "zapotocky and co - authors @xcite reported results from a cell - dynamical scheme simulation of phase ordering in two - dimensional samples of nematic liquid crystals .",
    "they found that the distance between stringlike defects decays as a power law with the exponent @xmath68 and this exponent seems to approach 0.5 when the average separation between defects becomes much larger than the cores . in another work in 1995 ,",
    "zapotocky @xcite also investigated the role played by topological textures during the phase ordering of an o(3 ) vector model in @xmath69 and found that the average separation @xmath39 between topological objects goes as @xmath70 .",
    "in 1999 , rojas and rutenberg @xcite used simulations through the standard cell dynamical system ( cds ) with dissipative dynamics and they found that the asymptotic law of the characteristic length scale is @xmath71)^{1/2}$ ] - result also obtained by dutta and roy @xcite in 2005 - and that the length scales can be well fitted employing an effective exponent of 0.40 @xmath56 0.01 . in 2001 ,",
    "denniston and co - authors @xcite , using a lattice boltzmann scheme , found that the effective exponent for the defect separation was around @xmath72 . in 2006 ,",
    "svetec and co - authors @xcite studied the semi - microscopic lattice - type model and brownian molecular dynamics in an infinite cylinder of radius @xmath60 and were able to fit the annihilation regime between a pointlike defect pair with a single exponent , @xmath2 , with @xmath73 . finally , in 2010",
    ", oliveira and co - authors @xcite simulated the coarsening dynamics of defects in a two - dimensional nematic in the presence of an applied electric field founding that the characteristic length scales evolves roughly as @xmath74 , but change rapidly when the electric field is switched on .",
    "considering the standard deviation , our result indicates that the numerical simulations of yurke and co - authors @xcite , zapotocky and co - authors @xcite , and svetec and co - authors @xcite , in addition to the experimental work of shiwaku and co - authors @xcite , are in agreement with the results exhibited here .    an important assumption made in deriving a relation for @xmath0 is that the evolution of average separation of the various defects formed after a phase transition is determined only by the forces acting in the isolated defect pair .",
    "the simulations made by zapotocky confirmed this assumption . in our experiments , we inspected all the possible annihilations between isolated defect pairs separately .",
    "the good agreement of our result with the one found by zapotocky _",
    "@xcite shows consistency between this computer simulations and our experimental work .",
    "moreover , most of the results reported here for the annihilation exponent @xmath41 ( figure [ mean ] ) were obtained under conditions when the pair separation @xmath0 was much smaller than the glass capillary thick .",
    "we would like also to point out that the graphs in the figure [ dxt ] and the ones for the other 46 pairs analyzed do not show a perceptible increase of the exponent @xmath41 , with increasing @xmath0 .",
    "this feature is difficult to be analyzed experimentally due to the number of defects that show up at the sample .",
    "in this work , we presented experimental results for the annihilation of isolated stringlike defects in a lyotropic liquid crystal with the following concentrations in weight percent : kl @xmath42 27.49% , deoh @xmath42 6.24% and h@xmath10o @xmath42 66.27% . when compared with the power law @xmath2 , we obtained a scaling law with @xmath3 and standard deviation @xmath4 , where @xmath0 is the distance between the annihilating defects , and @xmath1 the time remaining for the annihilation .",
    "furthermore , it was observed only stringlike ( @xmath75 ) defects in this analysis .",
    "our results are in very good agreement to the ones obtained by shiwaku and co - authors @xcite , yurke and co - authors @xcite , zapotocky and co - authors @xcite and svetec and co - authors @xcite . in comparison to thermotropic liquid crystals ,",
    "the lyotropic used here offers a good experimental condition to work with the defects , because the time of annihilation is very long and the attraction interaction between them seems to be weak .",
    "at least when based on the exponents @xmath41 , our investigations indicate that the annihilation dynamics in 2d of defects with strength @xmath31 is equivalent to those of type @xmath32 studied in @xcite and @xcite through computer simulations .",
    "in addition , taking the error of experimental measurements into account , universality of @xmath41 exponents in lyotropic and thermotropic can not be ruled out , although the average values of these exponents are different .",
    "we observed in our experiments that , after the annihilation , no defect was found in the region or , in other words , the sum over the defect s strength @xmath27 is zero .",
    "this conservation law illustrates a very general aspect of topological defects that occurs from early universe to condensed matter .",
    "as far as we know , this is the first time that the stringlike defects dynamics is investigated using a lyotropic liquid crystal .",

    "<S> topological defects can appear whenever there is some type of ordering . </S>",
    "<S> its ubiquity in nature has been the subject of several studies , from early universe to condensed matter . in this work , we investigated the annihilation dynamics of defects and antidefects in a lyotropic nematic liquid crystal ( ternary mixture of potassium laurate , decanol and deionized - destilated water ) using the polarized optical light microscopy technique . </S>",
    "<S> we analyzed _ schlieren _ textures with topological defects produced due to a symmetry breaking in the transition of the isotropic to nematic calamitic phase after a temperature quench . </S>",
    "<S> as result , we obtained for the distance @xmath0 between two annihilating defects ( defect - antidefect pair ) , as a function of time @xmath1 remaining for the annihilation , the scaling law @xmath2 , with @xmath3 and standard deviation @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> our findings go in the direction to extend experimental results related to dynamics of defects in liquid crystals since only thermotropic and polymerics ones had been investigated . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , our results are in good quantitative agreement with previous investigations on the subject . </S>"
