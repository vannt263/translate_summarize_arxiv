    "the dense molecular medium is one of the indispensable components to understand the star formation law in galaxies .",
    "this is because stars are formed from dense molecular cores , not from the diffuse envelopes of giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) .",
    "in fact , extragalactic observations of millimeter - wave hcn(10 ) emission , which is a tracer of high density molecular medium ( @xmath13 @xmath12 ) due to its high permanent dipole moment ( @xmath14 = 3.0 debye ) , demonstrate that the correlation between hcn(10 ) and far - infrared ( fir ) luminosities is better than that between co(10 ) and fir luminosities ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , the weakness of hcn emission ( typically 1/10 in @xmath15 of co in the central regions of galaxies , and 1/30 - 1/50 of co in the disk regions of the galaxy ( @xcite ) and galaxies ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) often prevents us from obtaining large - scale maps of the dense molecular medium through hcn observations .    in order to understand the global distribution of dense molecular medium in galaxies ,",
    "we have conducted an extragalactic co(32 ) imaging survey of nearby spiral galaxies , adios ( aste dense gas imaging of spiral galaxies ) .",
    "the current sample galaxies of the adios project are listed in table 1 .",
    "the submillimeter - wave co(32 ) emission is another tracer of dense gas because its einstein a coefficient is proportional to @xmath16 ; therefore , the critical density of co(32 ) emission is higher than that of co(10 ) by a factor of @xmath17 , i.e. , @xmath18 @xmath12 .    the atacama submillimeter telescope experiment ( aste ; @xcite ) , a new project to operate a 10 m telescope in the atacama desert of northern chile , provides us with an ideal opportunity to generate large - scale maps of co(32 ) emission because of the high beam efficiency of the telescope , a low system noise temperature due to the good receiver system and atmospheric conditions at the site , and its efficient on - the - fly ( otf ) mapping capability ( @xcite ) .    here , we present the co(32 ) images of the southern co luminous spiral galaxy ngc 986 as the initial result of the adios project by using otf mapping .",
    "ngc 986 is a nearby ( @xmath19 = 23.2 mpc ; @xcite ) barred spiral galaxy accompanied with an outer pseudo ring ( i.e. , ( r@xmath20)sb(rs)b , @xcite ) .",
    "it is a member of the iras bright galaxy sample ( @xcite ) ; however , its fir luminosity is rather moderate ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "is rescaled to the value for the distance we assumed here . ]",
    "the nucleus is classified as hii ( @xcite ) , and extended massive star forming regions along the bar have been imaged in h@xmath2 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) and mid - infrared continuum ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "the central region of ngc 986 is very rich in interstellar medium ( ism ) , and there are many reports on the observations of various atomic lines in the near - infrared ( nir ) to fir regions ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) and molecular lines at millimeter wavelengths ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . in fact , ngc 986 is one of the brightest galaxies in terms of co(10 ) emission in the sample of @xcite , thereby rendering this galaxy as an ideal target for our adios project . it should be noted that all the previous co observations of ngc 986 were conducted just toward the central position and no co map of ngc 986 has been published yet .",
    "the co(32 ) observations towards ngc 986 were conducted using the aste on september 14 and 15 , 2006 .",
    "the total time for observation was 10 hours .",
    "the mapped region was @xmath0 ( @xmath22 kpc ) , covering almost the entire region of the optical disk .",
    "the half - power beam width ( hpbw ) of the aste 10 m dish is 22@xmath10 at this frequency ; this corresponds to 2.5 kpc at a distance of 23 mpc .",
    "the front end was a cartridge - type cooled sis mixer receiver for the dsb operation , sc345 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the back end was a digital autocorrelator system , mac ( @xcite ) , which is comprised of four banks of a 512 mhz wide spectrometer with 1024 spectral channels each .",
    "this arrangement provided a velocity coverage of 440 km s@xmath5 with a velocity resolution of 0.43 km s@xmath5 .",
    "the observations were made remotely from an aste operation room of nro using a network observation system n - cosmos3 developed by the national astronomical observatory of japan ( naoj ) ( @xcite ) .",
    "otf mapping was performed along two different directions ( i.e. , scans along the ra and decl .",
    "directions ) , and these two data sets were co - added by the basket - weave method ( @xcite ) in order to remove effects of scanning noise . at the end of each otf scan , an off - source position ( @xmath23 offset from the map center in the azimuth ) was observed to subtract sky emission .",
    "we observed the co(32 ) emission of o - ceti ( mira ) every 2 hours in order to monitor the stabilities of the pointing accuracy and main beam efficiency ( @xmath24 ) of the aste 10 m dish .",
    "the pointing accuracy was found to be better than @xmath25 r.m.s . and",
    "@xmath24 was estimated to be 0.6 during the observing runs .",
    "the absolute error of the co(32 ) amplitude scale was @xmath9 @xmath7 20  % , mainly due to the variation in the beam efficiency .",
    "the data reduction was made using the software package _",
    "nostar _ , which comprises tools for otf data analysis developed by naoj ( @xcite ) .",
    "the raw data were regridded to 8@xmath10 per pixel , giving an effective spatial resolution of approximately @xmath26 ( or 2.8 kpc ) .",
    "linear baselines were removed from the spectra .",
    "we binned the adjacent channels to a velocity resolution of 10 km s@xmath5 at the frequency of co(32 ) .",
    "the resultant r.m.s .  noise level ( 1 @xmath27 ) was around 25 mk on the @xmath28 scale or 1.5 jy beam@xmath5 at a beam size of @xmath26 ( hpbw ) .",
    "it is noteworthy that at this frequency and beam size , a brightness temperature of 1 k on the @xmath28 scale corresponds to a flux density of 60.7 jy beam@xmath5 .",
    "after producing a 3d data cube , we analyzed it using aips .",
    "the 0th and 1st moment maps were computed using a clip level of 50 mk ( or 2 @xmath27 ) by the aips task momnt .",
    "a three - channel hanning smoothing along the velocity axis was applied in order to mitigate the contribution from noise .",
    "the derived velocity channel maps of co(32 ) emission in ngc 986 are displayed in figure [ fig : chan ] .",
    "we find a strong concentration of co emission toward the center with a large veocity width ( from 1865 to 2015 km s@xmath5 ; see also the co(32 ) spectrum at the central position in figure [ fig : ispec ] ) ; however , the extended emission along the sw to ne direction in some velocity channels ( from 1925 to 1985 km s@xmath5 ) is also evident .",
    "the 0th and 1st moment maps , i.e. , a velocity integrated intensity map and an intensity - weighted mean velocity map , respectively , are shown in figure [ fig : allmap ] .",
    "the peak position of co(32 ) emission , fitted by the aips task imfit , coincides well with the nir peak within an accuracy of less than @xmath29 .",
    "in addition to the strong co condensation at the center , we can clearly see extensions of the co emission along the bar and outer spiral arms , as observed in the r - band and h@xmath2 images ( @xcite ) .",
    "the major axis of this gaseous bar seen in co(32 ) emission is @xmath9 2 arcmin or 14 kpc .",
    "the nature of the gaseous bar will be discussed in section 4 .      in figure",
    "[ fig : allmap](d ) , we find a good spatial coincidence between the overall distributions of dense molecular gas traced by co(32 ) and the massive star formation depicted by h@xmath2 at a spatial scale of @xmath9 3 kpc .",
    "this is expected from the recent co(32 ) observations that demonstrate a tight correlation between co(32 ) and h@xmath2 luminosities ( @xcite ) thereby indicating an intimate association of the dense molecular medium with massive star formation ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "it is intriguing to study whether co(32 ) emission also shows a _ better _ spatial coincidence with the massive star forming regions as compared to the low - density gas traced by the co(10 ) emission . in fact , previous surveys of co(3 - 2 ) and co(1 - 0 ) lines toward the centers of star - forming galaxies suggest that co(3 - 2 ) luminosities show a _ tighter _ correlation with star - formation rates ( traced by h@xmath2 or fir ) than that of co(1 - 0 ) luminosities ( @xcite ) .",
    "future high - resolution low - j co observations might be able to address this issue .",
    "the total co(32 ) flux of ngc 986 was measured using the aips task tvstat .",
    "the mean co(32 ) intensity was 4.5 k km s@xmath5 averaged over 147 pixcels or @xmath30 pc@xmath6 .",
    "this gives a global co(32 ) luminosity @xmath3 of @xmath4 in the unit of k km s@xmath5 pc@xmath6 .",
    "note that the quoted error represents the systematic uncertainty , mainly due to the accuracy of main beam efficiency ( @xmath7 20 % ) .",
    "the derived co(32 ) luminosity of ngc 986 is comparable with that of inner @xmath31 region of m 83 ( @xcite ) .",
    "we compared the co(32 ) intensity we obtained at the central position with the existing co(10 ) ( @xcite ; @xcite ) and co(21 ) ( @xcite ) measurements .",
    "all the previous observations were made using the sest 15 m telescope . in order to compare our co(32 ) data with the low - resolution ( @xmath32 or @xmath8 resolution )",
    "co(10 ) intensities , we convolved our co(32 ) cube to the same spatial resolution ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "the sest co(21 ) observations had a beam size similar to that of the aste co(32 ) observations , and no correction was made in the derivation of a co(32)/co(21 ) line ratio .",
    "the integrated intensities of various co transitions were then summarized ( in table 3 ) .",
    "the co(32)/co(10 ) integrated intensity ratio @xmath33 was 0.60 @xmath7 0.13 at a spatial resolution of @xmath8 or 5 kpc , and the co(32)/co(21 ) ratio @xmath34 was 0.67 @xmath7 0.14 for a beam size of @xmath925@xmath10 or @xmath92.8 kpc .    the observed @xmath35 value , @xmath90.6 , is greater than those of the gmcs in the disk regions of the milky way ( @xmath9 0.4 , @xcite ; @xmath9 0.5 , @xcite ) and m 31 ( @xmath9 0.3 , @xcite ) .",
    "elliptical galaxies with very low - level star formation also show low ratios ( @xmath9 0.4 , @xcite ) .",
    "similar @xmath33 values are reported in the inner a few kpc region of m 83 ( 0.60.7 , @xcite ) and infrared luminous galaxies ( @xmath9 0.6 , @xcite ; @xcite ) , and dwarf starburst galaxies ( @xmath9 0.6 , @xcite ) . some of nearby starburst galaxies or giant hii regions in galaxies exibit high @xmath35 values close to unity ( @xcite ) .",
    "the central molecular zone of the milky way ( a size of @xmath9 200 pc ) also shows high @xmath33 ratio ( @xmath9 0.9 , @xcite ) .",
    "note that the apperture sizes / beam sizes of these line ratio measurements are a few 100 to a few kpc scales , and therefore mixture of multiple ism components must be observed .",
    "the observed line ratios in ngc 986 suggest a moderate excitation condition of the co lines within the central a few kpc region of this galaxy .",
    "for instance , @xmath34 of 0.7 suggest that the mean gas density @xmath36 averaged over a @xmath92.8 kpc region in diameter is within a range of @xmath37 to @xmath38 @xmath12 based on an lvg model by assuming a kinetic temperature of 30 k ( see fig .  8 of @xcite for instance ) .",
    "additional mapping observations of low - j co lines will be essential to determine the spatial distribution of co line ratios , allowing us to impose constraints on the physical properties of ism for various positions in ngc  986 .      from our global co(32 )",
    "luminosity of ngc 986 , the total molecular gas mass was estimated to be @xmath39 here , we adopted a galactic co(10)-to - h@xmath40 conversion factor @xmath41 @xmath42 ( k km s@xmath5 pc@xmath6)@xmath5 ( equivalent to @xmath43 @xmath44 ( k km s@xmath5)@xmath5 , @xcite ) ) and a co(32)/co(10 ) ratio @xmath33 of 0.6 ( see subsection [ ratio ] ) .",
    "this molecular gas mass is comparable to those in nearby gas - rich spiral galaxies such as m 51 ( @xmath45 @xmath42 , @xcite ) and m 83 ( 34 @xmath46 @xmath42 , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the star formation efficiency ( sfe ) , a star formation rate per unit gas mass , is then @xmath47 @xmath48 .",
    "note that both @xmath49 and @xmath50 were measured over the almost entire region of this galaxy ( i.e. , determined for the same area ) .",
    "this sfe in ngc 986 is indeed close to the sfes of nearby isolated or field spiral galaxies , @xmath51 @xmath48 ( @xcite ) .",
    "note that @xcite assumed an @xmath52 @xmath44 ( k km s@xmath5)@xmath5 ; if we recalibrate the sfes using the same @xmath53 value as for ngc 986 ( @xcite ) , the sfes for nearby isolated or field spirals will be @xmath54 @xmath48 , which are more closer to that of ngc 986 .",
    "on the other hand , the observed sfe in ngc 986 is much lower than those in local ir luminous galaxies , @xmath55 @xmath48 ( a mean value computed from table 2 of @xcite ) . here",
    "@xcite determined the @xmath53 of their sample to be @xmath56 @xmath44 ( k km s@xmath5)@xmath5 , about 1/10 of a typical galactic co - to - h@xmath40 conversion factor .",
    "another direct quantity related to sfe is the fir to co(32 ) luminosity ratio @xmath57 , a measure of star formation rate per unit dense - gas mass .",
    "we find the @xmath57 ratio of 67 @xmath58/(k km s@xmath5 pc@xmath6 ) in ngc 986 .",
    "this is comparable to the @xmath57 values found in local ir luminous galaxies , a few 10 @xmath58/(k km s@xmath5 pc@xmath6 ) , that was calculated from @xcite , yet still much smaller than ultra / hyper luminous ir galaxies in the early universe , such as the submillimeter galaxy mips j142824.0 + 352619 at @xmath59 = 1.3 , showing the @xmath57 of 264 @xmath7 84 @xmath58/(k km s@xmath5 pc@xmath6 ) ( @xcite ) .",
    "we find a clear velocity gradient in the mean - velocity map ( figure [ fig : allmap](b ) ) .",
    "we therefore determined the kinematical parameters of the gas disk , i.e. , the dynamical center , systemic velocity , the position angle of the major axis , and inclination angle of the disk by a least - squares fitting of the intensity - weighted isovelocity field to a circular rotation model .",
    "the aips task gal was used for this analysis .",
    "the fitting was made within a radius of 1@xmath60 , where the observed velocity field seems to be dominated by a circular motion . in general , strong non - circular motions are expected in the central regions of barred galaxies , but it is not clear in our map ; it could be probably due to the insufficient spatial resolution of our observations .",
    "the dynamical center coincides well with the nucleus position determined by the nir ( 2mass ) peak within an error of a few arcsec .",
    "the systemic velocity ( lsr ) was determined to be 1942 @xmath7 10 km s@xmath5 ( or corresponding to a heliocentric velocity of 1957 @xmath7 10 km s@xmath5 ) .",
    "this agrees well with the co(10 ) result ( @xcite ) and is close to the hi velocity measurement ( @xcite ) .",
    "see table 2 for comparison .",
    "the position angle of the major axis and the inclination angle of the disk were estimated to be 127@xmath61 ( from north to east ) and 37@xmath61 ( 0@xmath61 is face - on ) , respectively .",
    "these kinematically determined angles are consistent with the previously reported isophotal values based on optical and nir broad band images of ngc 986 ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the comparison of these angles is shown in table 2 .",
    "a position - to - velocity map ( pv map ) was generated along the determined major axis ( p.a .",
    "= 53@xmath61 ) , as shown in figure [ fig : pv ] .",
    "the velocity gradient along the major axis was found to be @xmath910 km s@xmath5 arcsec@xmath5 from the figure ; however , but we require much higher angular resolution measurements of the pv map , using sma for instance , in order to determine the inner rotation curve of ngc 986 .",
    "our co(32 ) image revealed the presence of a large ( @xmath9 14 kpc ) gaseous bar filled with dense molecular medium along the dark lanes observed in the optical images .",
    "this is the largest `` dense - gas rich bar '' known to date ; previous large scale co(32 ) imaging observations of nearby galaxies revealed that a centrally concentrated co(32 ) morphology of around a few kpc scale is very common ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "some gas - rich barred spiral galaxies such as ngc 6946 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , and m 83 ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , exhibit a wide spread co(32 ) emission over the disk region ; however , no such instances of large ( @xmath910 kpc scale ) dense molecular gas bar have been reported thus far .",
    "therefore , it is indeed a surprise to discover a 14 kpc long gaseous bar observed in co(32 ) emission among nearby spiral galaxies .",
    "note that this is even true in the case of bars observed in low - j co lines .",
    "some galaxies such as ngc 1530 ( @xcite ) , ugc 2855 ( @xcite ) , and ngc 7479 ( @xcite ) do exhibit a continuous bar , observed in co(10 ) and/or co(21 ) emission , with a length of @xmath910 kpc ; however , this is a rare phenomenon .",
    "the dense molecular medium in the bar region could be transported to the central region of ngc 986 within a short time scale ( @xmath9 a dynamical time scale ) due to the strong shock along the bar ( e.g. , see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "this could be a major reason why we hardly observe such a gas - rich bar in galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , the discovered dense gas bar in ngc 986 must be a huge reservoir of possible `` fuel '' for future starbursts in the central region , and we suggest that the star formation process in the central region of ngc 986 could still be in a growing phase .",
    "we are grateful to the referee , susanne httemeister , for her careful reading of the manuscript and useful comments .",
    "we would like to acknowledge all the members involved with the aste team for their great efforts in the aste project .",
    "this study was financially supported by mext grant - in - aid for scientific research on priority areas no .",
    ". observations with aste were carried out remotely from japan by using ntt s gemnet2 and its partner r&e ( research and education ) networks , which are based on accessnova collaboration of university of chile , ntt laboratories , and national astronomical observatory of japan .",
    "@xmath62the first error corresponds to the s / n of the spectrum ( i.e. , random error only ) , and the second error is obtained from the systematic error , mainly due to the accuracy of the main beam efficiency ( 20 % ) ."
