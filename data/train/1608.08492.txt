    "@xcite ,  @xcite and joshi  @xcite have provided a framework for understanding some of the anatomical processes that take place in regulating the gain of the networks involved , and why pupillary reactions are visible :    at the core , the locus coeruleus - norepinephine ( lc - ne ) system operates in two different modes , _ tonic mode _ that regulates the overall level of preparedness or arousal and _ phasic mode _ that is involved in responding to task - relevant stimuli . as task difficulty increases , so will tonic mode activity , modulating the gain , which in turn leads to a increased performance and a stronger phasic response to task - relevant stimuli .",
    "if , however , the arousal system and tonic activity mode increase beyond a certain peak point , the phasic responses decrease , leading to an explanation of the classical trade - off between arousal and optimal performance first analysed by yerkes and dodson  @xcite .    , where the largest phasic dilations are seen as compared to at [ a ] and [ c ] .",

    "note that the drawing is not to scale . ]    ' '' ''    activity in lc - ne cells are further reflected in pupillary dilations  @xcite , and the pupil can thus be interpreted as a marker of lc - ne activity ( see also fig .  [",
    "fig : phasictonic ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : eyedilation ] ) .",
    "baseline pupil size varies on a large scale of 3 - 4 mm as a response to changes in light levels  @xcite ,  @xcite whereas variations caused by cognitive processes are much smaller , typically on the order of 0.5 mm or 15% compared to typical pupil sizes found in normal conditions  @xcite .",
    "the baseline pupil size is modulated by the tonic activity in lc - ne , and is never at rest ; it has been known for a long time to vary .",
    "stark et al .",
    "@xcite speculated that this could be part of an `` economical '' construction of the eye in the sense that there is no need for the eye to operate at a more narrow range , and in our previous study  @xcite we also noted slow variations of the baseline pupil size of + /-10% on a timescale of 3060s .",
    "task - evoked pupillary responses  @xcite ,  @xcite ( tepr ) above the current baseline are caused by phasic activity in the lc - ne system , and by averaging over many similarly conditioned tests time - locked to the stimuli , other factors can be filtered out .",
    "recent fmri studies by kuchinsky et al . have further established that activity in saliency networks triggered by attentional tasks are reflected in increased tonic pupil size , in contrast to the decreased pupil dilation typically observed when we are in a default resting state @xcite .",
    "phasic activations of the lc - ne system in the noradrenergic ( ne ) neurons also play a role in rapid adaptation to changing conditions , as demonstrated by bouret et al .",
    "@xcite , in that it may facilitate reorganisation of the innervated areas .",
    "this allows for adaption of behaviour to changes in task conditions ; real or when they deviate from anticipation .",
    "preuschoff et al .",
    "@xcite have found that pupil dilations not only reflect decision making per se or the level of engagement , but also indicates surprise when committing mistakes in decision tasks , suggesting that ne plays a role in error signalling .",
    "this appear similar to the negativity feedback components , which is an event related potential ( erp ) typically observed in eeg neuroimaging experiments 250 - 300 ms after participants realize that an incorrect choice was made  @xcite .",
    "while attention can be broadly understood as `` the appropriate allocation of processing resources to relevant stimuli ''  @xcite , posner and petersen  @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite have shown that three systems , which regulate attention , are anatomically separate from other processing systems and carry out different cognitive roles as part of the attention networks .",
    "these are :    * alerting , * orienting and * executive control",
    ".    fan et al .",
    "@xcite designed a behavioral experiment , known as the attention network test ( ant ) , to assess which of the network components are activated based on differences in reaction time when responding to visual cues .",
    "we have in a previous experiment  @xcite , measured task - evoked pupillar responses during the ant test in a longitudinal study of two subjects .",
    "a stronger response was triggered by incongruent conditions in the conflict resolution decision task , likely involving the executive network .",
    "this study expands the number of subjects , investigates the changes in mean pupil size over the experiment , and look at the relationship between the tonic level and the accuracy of the responses .",
    "the procedure followed and the equipment used is identical to that described in  @xcite , and is further illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : ant - run - exp ] . in this present study , in total n=18 participants (",
    "7 female and 11 male ) with a mean age of 25.3 years were tested once .",
    "none used glasses or contact lenses , and all but one were right - handed .",
    "the participant were all volunteers that were only allowed to complete the test if they gave consent to their data being used anonymously for research purposes .",
    "the ant test itself is a standard paradigm in widespread use .",
    "pupil size is recorded at 60 hz , and blink - affected periods are removed .",
    "a hampel  @xcite filter with a centered window of + /-83ms and a limit of @xmath0 is applied to remove outliers , and when data is not present in at least half the window , the center point is also removed .",
    "this later part takes care of removing any samples immediately before and after blinks , to avoid accidental pupil size changes caused by distortion of the visible part of the eye .",
    "finally data is downsampled to 100ms resolution with a windowed averaging filter .    for the tepr calcuation ,",

    "the pupil was further corrected for variations in head - distance by means of the eye - to - eye distance reported by the eye - tracker .",
    "the mean pupil size was calculated in each of the 4 periods ( the initial trial round and the three actual blocks of reaction time tests ) as the average value of the filtered pupil data corrected for head - distance variations , which means it is representative of both the tonic pupil size and the ovelaid phasic responses .",

    "[ fig : qmeans_ab ]      average fixation density maps , adjusted for accidental mis - calibrations , were built for each experiment , and were compared between conditions .",
    "we did , as expected , see recognisable differences when the target presentation was above vs below the fixation cross , but we were not able to detect any significant spatial differences between congruency conditions nor between cue conditions .",
    "the results of this study , with a larger population , supports our previous findings : there is a difference in the incongruent vs congruent / neutral flanker scenarios in that an incongruent condition solicit a larger pupillary response compare to the other two conditions .",
    "as the age group is different compared to the previous study , there are indications that the results may be robust and can translate to different settings ..    in most cases we see a high correlation ( r values from 0.80.95 ) between left and right pupil size , although a few have what may be less than optimal tracking .",
    "we can not conclude any significant difference in the pupil dilation responses between the two eyes , but we notice that the significance level of the difference between the incongruent and the neutral condition is higher and lasts slightly longer for the right eye .",
    "in addition , we also found a significantly different response when subjects replied incorrectly , which happens much more frequently for the inconguent condition .",
    "this response may be related to the adaptation and required reorganization reported by bouret et al .",
    "@xcite and/or to the surprise elements reported by preuschoff et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "thus , the phasic response reported here as well as in our previous study can be divided into two components that apparently cause a higher level of lc - ne activations : one related to the incongruent condition and one to the incorrect reply .    comparing the mean relative pupil size over the 4 parts of the experiment ( training round and 3 blocks of tests ) we found that for the subjects of the present study , as well as for subject b of the longitudinal study , the training round had a statistically significant higher level , around 5% , compared to the other three blocks that averaged around -2% .",
    "the subject a of the longitudinal study , however , did not show any such variation between the blocks .",
    "we hypothesize that this may point to differences in individual characteristics , behavoiur or preferences .",
    "further , comparing relative normalized tonic pupil sizes ( excluding the phasic responses ) showed a statistically significant difference between the level immediately before an incorrect reply compared to the level before a correct reply for subject a of the longitudinal study but not for subject b nor for the participants of the present study .",
    "however , while for subject b the levels are almost identical , there is a larger difference even if not statistically significant for the participants of this study , and it therefore can not be ruled out that participants could fall in different groups that , with more data , would reveal more individual variation .",
    "we also point out that the possible familiarity effects of higher pupillary responses mainly in the two first complete experiments were not tested for in the present experiment , since it was performed only once for each participant .",
    "we do , however , see hints at an overall adaptation , as the average ( tonic ) level decreases as initial entraining to the tasks take place , with a flat or in some cases slightly increased tonic levels towards task completion .",
    "this appear similar to the _ familiarity effect _ reported by hyn et al .",
    "@xcite    we were not able to find any spatial differences in eye movements , at the resolution we worked with , that was related to the conditions of the test , apart from the up - down position of the target .",

    "<S> cognitive processes involved in both allocation of attention during decision making as well as surprise when making mistakes trigger release of the neurotransmitter norepinephrine , which has been shown to be correlated with an increase in pupil dilation , in turn reflecting raised levels of arousal . extending earlier experiments based on the attention network test ( ant ) , separating the neural components of alertness and spatial re - orientation from the attention involved in more demanding conflict resolution tasks , we demonstrate that these signatures of attention are so robust that they may be retrieved even when applying low cost eye tracking in an everyday mobile computing context . </S>",
