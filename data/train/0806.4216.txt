    "entangled photon pair sources have wide applications in quantum cryptography , teleportation , dense coding , and quantum computation because of the simplicity to manipulate such bi - photon states with the current technologies @xcite .",
    "the efficient generation of these entangled photon pairs therefore attracts extensive research in the recent years . at the present time",
    "the primary method of experimentally producing entangled photon pairs is the parametric down - conversion ( pdc ) in @xmath1 crystals @xcite ( here we only cite the seminal works ) .",
    "a pdc source emits entangled photon pairs with their numbers following the approximate poisson distribution in the weak down - conversion regime @xcite .",
    "in addition to the polarization modes , pdc pairs are correlated in spatial modes , wave lengths , etc . , and these extra correlations might limit the flexibility of such pair source . an ideal entangled pair source should output the following maximally entangled states @xmath2 which are correlated only in their polarization modes @xmath3 and @xmath4 representing the horizontal and vertical polarization , respectively ( the indexes @xmath5 and @xmath6 denote the sharing parties of the entanglement ) . the generation of these discrete entangled state , which are called the bell states , is important to various practical applications . in reality , due to the possible decoherence and imperfection , the generated photon pairs could largely deviate from the bell states , and the performance of the quantum information protocols based on them would be degraded . to improve on the quality of the entangled pairs",
    ", one will demand the procedures of entanglement concentration @xcite and entanglement purification @xcite to make the generated states be closer to the bell states .",
    "these operations would be difficult to perform if the states of the generated entangled pairs from a pdc or other source are unknown .    in this work",
    "we propose a design for the setup that transforms an input photon pair in arbitrary rank - four mixed state , @xmath7 to an maximally entangled states in eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) . in the above equation @xmath8",
    "are the eigenvalues of @xmath9 and @xmath10 , the pure state components as its eigenvectors , are the linear combinations of @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "there are dual functions of this setup .",
    "if @xmath9 is the tensor product of the states of two independent single photons , it will naturally work as an entangler .",
    "single photon sources have been close to practical applications recently ( for an overview on the single photon sources based on parametric down - conversion in @xmath1 materials , see @xcite ) .",
    "a bright source of heralded narrow - band single photons has been experimentally realized using a double - resonant optical parametric oscillator ( opo ) @xcite .",
    "also with electromagnetic induced transparency ( eit ) technique , it is possible to generate single photons with narrow bandwidth which is actually the same as that of the control laser ( typically about 1 mhz ) .",
    "if we entangle the single photons from these sources only in their polarization modes , the entangled pairs with narrow bandwidth will be extremely suitable for long - distance quantum communications . in the system",
    "we transmit the correlation between the polarization modes of two individual photons by two identical laser beams in coherent state .",
    "these so - called quantum bus ( qubus ) or communication beams interact with the single photons through cross - phase modulation ( xpm ) processes in kerr media .",
    "the state of the qubus beams in the transmission channel is entangled coherent state or coherent - state superposition known as cat state @xcite .",
    "the decoherence effects on the superpositions of coherent states being transmitted through a standard optical fiber are dominated by the channel loss due to photon absorption ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it will result in a trade - off between the fidelity of an entangled photon pair and the success probability of the entangling operation .",
    "however , such trade - off is controllable by adjusting the parameters of the system so that the entangled photon pairs of high fidelity could be generated .",
    "the second function of the setup is the purification of noisy photon pairs .",
    "xpm processes have been proposed for the realization of entanglement concentration and purification @xcite .",
    "different from all previous schemes , our setup could effectively perform as a purifier for photon pairs without the knowledge about their exact states ( @xmath8 and @xmath10 in eq .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) could be unknown ) .",

    "then the coherent beam is compared with another untouched one by means of a 50/50 beam splitter and a photon number non - resolving detector . without the loss of generality , we let the coherent beams in two qnd modules be coupled to @xmath4 component on each side as in fig .",

    "its advantages will be demonstrated in a decoherence environment discussed in the next section .    as illustrated in fig . 1 , we first interact two qubus or communication beams in the identical coherent state @xmath65 with photon b through two kerr nonlinearities , which effect the unitary operations @xmath66 ( @xmath67 and @xmath68 the interaction time ) . here the coupling of the qubus beams to the modes going to @xmath60 or @xmath63 is determined by the classically feed - forwarded measurement results of the qnd module .",
    "overall , such xpm processes evolve the state of the whole system as follows : @xmath69 where @xmath70 , and the global coefficient is neglected . at location",
    "b , the first qubus beam is coupled to the single photon mode on track 2 while the second to that on track 1 . after the xpm processes , photon b will be stored in any type of quantum memory and the qubus beams will be sent to location a , where we use kerr nonlinearities inducing the same phase shift to couple them with photon a in a different way  the first beam will be coupled to the mode on track 1 and the second to that on track 2 . with which single photon modes ( going to @xmath59 or @xmath62 ) the qubus beams should be coupled to is also decided by the qnd module s detection at location a. then , two phase shifters of @xmath71 are applied on the qubus beams to transform the state of the system to @xmath72 like the process in a qnd module in fig .",
    "2 , the comparison of the two qubus beam states in the above equation is performed by a 50/50 beam splitter and a photon detector d. the final state before the photon detection is @xmath73    in the fock state basis the first coherent state with the odd parity bi - photon component ( the linear combination of @xmath74 and @xmath75 ) is @xmath76 ( @xmath77 ) on this qubus beam .",
    "if the measured value of the photon number is @xmath78 , the resulting bell state will be @xmath79 ; if the photon number @xmath80 , we will obtain the state @xmath81 , which could be either @xmath82 or @xmath83 with the respective probability @xmath84 . the error in the operation",
    "is due to the overlap between @xmath50 and @xmath85 , which gives the error probability @xmath86 .",
    "if @xmath87 is large enough , each entangling operation will be almost deterministic .    in practical implementation",
    ", the fock state projections @xmath88 can be performed by using an extra qnd module in fig . 2 @xcite .",
    "now the coherent beams in the module are initially in the state @xmath89 .",
    "one of the coherent beams will be coupled to @xmath90 through a cross kerr medium , effecting the following transformation @xmath91 after the 50/50 beam splitter in the qnd module , the coherent state of the two detecting beams will be @xmath92 , where @xmath93 is from @xmath94 to infinity . since each @xmath95 has a certain poisson distribution of photon numbers from @xmath96 to @xmath97 , the number non - resolving detector s povm element @xmath98 in eq .",
    "( [ povm ] ) actually functions as @xmath99 on each of these coherent state components .",
    "the photon number non - resolving detector in this qnd module should be a sensor outputting the signals ( voltage or current ) proportional to the total photon detection probabilities @xmath100 . given a large coherent beam amplitude @xmath101 , the output signals for the different @xmath95 can be mutually distinct , and the photon number resolving detection will be implemented in such indirect way .    on the other hand ,",
    "if we are only provided with apds , the threshold detectors registering photon or no photon , the total success probability will be lowered to @xmath0 per try .",
    "we could also compare the second beam ( @xmath102 in fig .",
    "1 ) , which is either in the state @xmath103 or in the state @xmath104 from eq . ( [ parity ] ) ,",
    "with another prepared state @xmath105 at location a. then we have such detection pattern for the generated states : if the second coherent beam is responded by a detector , we will realize the bell state @xmath106 with the success probability @xmath0 ; if the first coherent beam is responded , on the other hand , what we obtain will be an unknown superposition of @xmath12 by the other @xmath0 probability .",
    "the entangled photon pair generation rate of the system could be limited by the dead time of the photon detector in the qnd modules , but the detection inefficiency as in single photons detection can be overcome by using sufficiently bright qubus beams . since the photons of the generated pairs",
    "are only correlated in their polarizations , the wavelengths and bandwidths of the entangled pairs are those of the single photon sources .",
    "in the above discussions , we assume that the losses of the qubus beams are negligible . in reality , however , there could be various losses , especially when the two qubus beams are sent through a long - distance optical fiber to another location .",
    "another source of decoherence is the instability of the phase difference of two qubus beams due to the fluctuation of their transmission times through the optical fibers .",
    "such phase noise can be eliminated by sending them through the same fiber within a short time interval , as has been demonstrated in a recent experiment for single photon signals @xcite . in this section",
    "we will focus on the decoherence due to losses , and present the optimum performance of the system in such decoherence environment .",
    "first , we look at the kerr media for implementing the required xpm processes",
    ". a normal kerr crystal could be too weak to generate a sufficient phase shift @xcite .",
    "the satisfactory performance of a parity gate working with such cross - kerr nonlinear crystal could also be spoiled by phase noise @xcite . beyond the normal kerr nonlinearities , the possible candidates for realizing the necessary xpm process are the atomic systems working under eit conditions @xcite , where the phase noise model in @xcite may not be applicable .",
    "although the dissipative losses of the photonic modes in an eit medium could also exist , we only need to generate a very small phase shift @xmath107 in eq .",
    "( [ uk ] ) , and it intrinsically lowers the losses of single photon and coherent beam @xcite . by using a sufficiently bright coherent beams @xmath65 we can still realize the high efficiency of the entangler",
    "this is one of the advantages of our setup .    in @xcite",
    "some of us studied the decoherence due to the losses in the xpm processes for generating cat states as in eq .",
    "( [ uk ] ) .",
    "it is shown that the good coherence of the generated state in eq .",
    "( [ uk ] ) and the reasonable qubus beam intensity @xmath108 are possible with the appropriate signal field detuning and interaction time .      since the phase noise of two qubus beams can be eliminated if they are transmitted as the reference of each other , the decoherence effect on the total state of the system is predominantly from their losses in optical fiber .",
    "the decoherence caused by the losses in the xpm processes could be also included in this part by extending the effective length of the optical fiber .",
    "there have been studies on such decoherence in hybrid or qubus quantum repeater protocols @xcite . by our design",
    "the initial qubus state is either an entangled coherent state as in eq .",
    "( [ uk ] ) or the product of a cat state and a coherent state , @xmath109 by applying a transformation with a 50/50 beam splitter .",
    "the decoherence on a cat state due to loss can be found in @xcite , and that for the state in eq .",
    "( [ cat ] ) is also studied in @xcite . here",
    "we discuss the decoherence of the entangled coherent state in an amplitude - damping channel by solving the master equation involving the two qubus beams and the single photon qubit at location b @xmath110+[\\hat{a}_i,\\rho\\hat{a}_i^{\\dagger}]\\}=\\hat{{\\cal d}}\\rho , \\label{loss}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath111 is the loss rate of a coherent beam in optical fiber , the sum is over two qubus modes , and the initial state is @xmath112 , with @xmath113 . during a period of time @xmath114 for the qubus beams",
    "being sent to location a , the initial pure state will be decohered to @xmath115 where @xmath116 and @xmath117 as the result , the fidelity of the whole state after the qubus beams going through the transmission channel will be lowered to @xmath118 .      through the non - local entangling operation of the parity gate discussed in the last section , what we realize in a decoherence environment will be a mixed state @xmath119 where @xmath120 @xmath121 and @xmath122 . from such output",
    "we will obtain a mixture of two bell states of the same parity . the error probability in this case",
    "is that of the vacuum component in @xmath123 .",
    "here we assume @xmath107 , and the relation between the the fidelity and the success probability is then given as @xmath124 fig .",
    "4 demonstrates this upperbound efficiency - fidelity relation for some different transmission coefficients @xmath125 .",
    "the parity gate based on coherent states comparison therefore outperforms the other schemes @xcite in the decoherence environment of lossy optical fiber . to eliminate the unwanted component @xmath126 in eq .",
    "( [ out ] ) , we can choose the proper parameters such that @xmath127 .",
    "for example , if @xmath48 is set to the order of @xmath128 and @xmath129 is in the order of @xmath130 , the fidelity of the state in eq .",
    "( [ out ] ) will be larger than @xmath131 .",
    "on the other hand , if we want to achieve both high efficiency and fidelity , the qubus beam loss in the transmission channel should be sufficiently small .",
    "demanding @xmath132 and @xmath133 , for instance , we will need a good transmission coefficient @xmath134 .    ) for the performance of the system under the qubus beam losses .",
    "the curves from the upper to the lower correspond to the transmission @xmath135 , @xmath136 , @xmath137 , @xmath138 and @xmath139 of the optical fiber , respectively . ]",
    "we could also obtain an approximate bell state simply by comparing the state of two output qubus beams with another tensor product state @xmath140 .",
    "the circuit for the purpose consists of two 50/50 beam splitters and two photon detectors .",
    "following the notation in @xcite , we represent the transformation of the linear optical circuit as ( @xmath141 is assumed to be real ) @xmath142 the state @xmath140 for comparison is input from the third and fourth input port , and @xmath143 is either @xmath144 or @xmath145 from eqs .",
    "( [ d1 ] ) and ( [ d2 ] ) .",
    "if the first or the second beam of the output state , @xmath146 , is detected , we will realize an approximate bell state @xmath83 . under the condition @xmath147 ( contrary to that in the qnd modules ) for realizing an entangled pairs of high fidelity",
    ", the single photon detection will be the dominant contribution .",
    "the maximum success probability of an entangling operation in this situation will be @xmath148 which is half of the optimum success probability @xcite of unambiguously discriminating the coherent state product @xmath144 from @xmath145 . as the overlap of these two coherent state products is large in the high fidelity range , there is no contribution from @xmath144 , so the success probability in eq .",
    "( [ e ] ) carries a pre - factor @xmath149 . under the present condition ,",
    "the problems to take care in practical implementation are the effieicncy and the dark count of the detector as in any single photon detection .",
    "in summary , we illustrate a setup that transforms a photon pair in arbitrary rank - four mixed state to a bell state .",
    "we realize such transformation with linear optics and kerr nonlinearity that induces a small xpm phase shift at the single photon level . using photon number resolving detection",
    ", we can realize a near deterministic entangling operation by the setup . only provided with the simple threshold photon detectors ( apds )",
    ", its pair generation rate can be as large as the half of the single photon source repetition rate . because the entangled photons are only correlated in polarization modes",
    ", such source also enjoys much more flexibility than the other types of entangled pair sources .",
    "we also study the optimum performance of the setup in the decoherence environment of photon absorption losses .",
    "this universal entangler will be realizable with the current technology if we can stabilize a small xpm phase shift in kerr media .",
