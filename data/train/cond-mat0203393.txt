    "many theoretical investigations on electrorheological ( er ) fluids are usually concentrated on monodisperse systems in which all the suspended particles are of the same size and dielectric constant . in reality",
    "er fluids must be polydisperse in nature , i.e. , the particles can have various sizes and/or different dielectric permittivities @xcite .",
    "for instance , the particle size has a significant impact on the yield stress @xcite , as well on the rheology @xcite .",
    "an initial approach for these studies would be the point - dipole ( pd ) approximation @xcite .",
    "as many - body and multipolar interactions between the particles have been neglected , the pd approximation is known to err considerably when the particles approach and finally touch .",
    "the pd approximation becomes even worse when the dielectric contrasts between the suspended particles and the host medium become large . to circumvent the problem",
    ", we recently employed the multiple image method to compute the interparticle force for a polydisperse er fluid @xcite . from the results , we proposed a dipole - induced - dipole ( did ) model for computer simulations of er fluids ; the did model yields very good agreements with the multiple image results for a wide range of dielectric contrasts and polydispersity @xcite .",
    "the did model has recently been employed to simulate the athermal aggregation of particles in er fluids in which the particles are of different permittivities @xcite . moreover",
    ", the dielectric contrasts between the particles and the host fluids were all positive .",
    "the aggregation time was found to be significantly reduced , both in uniaxial and rotating electric fields @xcite . in this work , we will report results for the case when the dielectric contrasts of some particles can be negative . in which case ,",
    "the direction of the force should be reversed @xcite .",
    "the inclusion of the did force further complicates the results because the symmetry between positive and negative contrasts will be broken by the presence of dipole - induced interactions .",
    "we found that the aggregation time can be much increased as compared to the pd model .    in the next section ,",
    "we review the multiple image method and establish the did model . in section iii",
    ", we apply the did model to the computer simulation of er fluids in a uniaxial field . in section iv , we extend the simulation to athermal aggregation in rotating fields .",
    "discussion on our results will be given .",
    "in this section , we generalize the multiple image method @xcite to handle both positive and negative dielectric contrasts . consider a pair of dielectric spheres , of radii @xmath0 and @xmath1 , dielectric constants @xmath2 and @xmath3 respectively , separated by a distance @xmath4 .",
    "the spheres are embedded in a host medium of a dielectric constant @xmath5 . upon the application of an electric field",
    "@xmath6 , the induced - dipole moment inside the spheres are , respectively , given by ( si units ) p_a0=4 _ 0 _ 2 e_0 a^3 , p_b0=4 _ 0 _ 2  e_0 b^3 , where the dipole factors @xmath7 , @xmath7 are defined as = , =. in the point - dipole ( pd ) model , the force between two particles is given by _",
    "pd = f r^4 , where @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are unit vectors .",
    "many previous studies were concentrated on the case in which both @xmath11 .",
    "when the @xmath7s adopt opposite signs , the direction of the pd force will be reversed . in a recent paper , we derived a correction to the pd force from the multiple image method @xcite .",
    "the total dipole moment inside sphere @xmath0 is p_at&=&()^3 _ n=1^ , [ mideqt1 ] + p_al&=&()^3 _ n=1^ , [ mideqt2 ] where the subscripts @xmath12 denote a transverse ( longitudinal ) field , i.e. , the applied field is perpendicular ( parallel ) to the line joining the centers of the spheres .",
    "similar expressions for the total dipole moment inside sphere @xmath1 can be obtained by interchanging @xmath0 and @xmath1 , as well as @xmath7 and @xmath13 .",
    "the parameter @xmath14 satisfies = .",
    "the forces between the spheres is given by @xcite f_t=(p_at+p_bt ) , f_l=(p_al+p_bl ) .",
    "it should be noted that the multiple image results can be used to compare among the various models according to how many terms are retained in the multiple image expressions : ( a ) pd model : @xmath15 term only , ( b ) did model : @xmath15 to @xmath16 terms only , and ( c ) multiple - induced - dipole ( mid ) model : @xmath15 to @xmath17 terms .    for convenience ,",
    "we define the reduced separation @xmath18 . here",
    "we set @xmath19 .",
    "we consider two cases : ( a ) @xmath20 or @xmath21 and ( b ) @xmath22 or @xmath23 .",
    "the interparticle forces in the longitudinal and transverse cases are plotted in fig.[figforce ] with different values of the dielectric contrasts . for the case ( a ) depicted in fig.[figforce](a ) , the magnitude of mid force falls between that of the pd and did in both the longitudinal and transverse cases . at low contrasts ,",
    "the did results almost coincide with the mid results . while at high contrast , the did model exhibits significant deviation from mid when @xmath24 .",
    "for the case ( b ) as depicted in fig.[figforce](b ) , the did results almost coincide with the mid results at low contrast , while deviate significantly at high contrast .",
    "the forces are found to be qualitatively different from the case of @xmath11 .",
    "thus , by including the multiple image contributions , it is observed that the case of @xmath25 significantly different from the presumably symmetric case of @xmath26 . the symmetry has been broken due to the presence of did forces .",
    "the multiple image expressions [ eqs.([mideqt1 ] ) and ( [ mideqt2 ] ) ] allow us to calculate the correction factor defined as the ratio between the did and the pd forces @xcite : & = & 1 + + + , [ k - para ] + & = & 1- - + , + & = & 1 + + + , [ k - gamma ] where @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 are the point - dipole forces for the transverse , longitudinal , and @xmath30 cases , respectively . if we denote the ratios in eqs.([k - para])([k - gamma ] ) by @xmath31 and @xmath32 respectively , the force between two particles is modified to @xmath33.\\ ] ]    in what follows , we consider two spheres of equal radius @xmath0 and various dipole factors @xmath7 and @xmath13 respectively .",
    "these spheres are initially at rest and at a separation @xmath34 . for aggregation induced by a uniaxial field , we consider two cases . for case ( a ) @xmath35 or @xmath21 ,",
    "the electric field is perpendicular to the line joining the centers of the spheres .",
    "the equation of motion is given by = f_(2z ) , [ eom1 ] while for case ( b ) @xmath22 or @xmath36 , the electric field is parallel to the line joining the centers of the spheres .",
    "the equation of motion becomes = f_(2z ) , [ eom2 ] where @xmath37 is the displacement of one sphere from the center of mass .",
    "the separation between the two spheres is therefore @xmath38 and the initial condition is @xmath39 at @xmath40 .",
    "eqs.([eom1 ] ) and ( [ eom2 ] ) are dimensionless equation . following klingenberg and with slight modification , we choose the following natural scaling units to define the dimensionless variables @xcite : z_0=2a , t_0=12 _ c a^2/f_0 , f_0= _ 0 _ 2 e_0 ^ 2 a^2 , where @xmath41 is the field strength , @xmath42 the mass , and @xmath43 the coefficient of viscosity .",
    "we have followed klingenberg to ignore the inertial effect and thermal motion of the particles @xcite .",
    "the initial separation @xmath34 is related to the volume fraction @xmath44 by = ( ) ^1/3 . in the pd approximation , eq.([eom1 ] ) admits an analytic solution z=^1/5 , [ pd1 ] while eq.([eom2 ] ) gives z=^1/5 .",
    "[ pd2 ] it is obvious the above equations impose a condition for aggregation in uniaxial field , namely , the transverse case requires that @xmath7 and @xmath13 are of different signs while the longitudinal case requires that they are of the same sign .    for the did model , we integrate the equations of motion by the fourth - order runge - kutta algorithm , with the time step @xmath45 for both small and large volume fractions . in fig.[figagguf ] , we plot the reduced separation @xmath46 against dimensionless time @xmath47 .",
    "the results reveal that in general the did results deviate slightly from the pd results at low volume fractions , i.e. at a large initial separation , while the deviation becomes large at high volume fractions .",
    "the deviations are more pronounced at high contrasts , attributed to a large attractive force , resulting in a smaller aggregation time . in both cases ( a ) and ( b ) ,",
    "the did aggregation time is generally larger than that of pd .",
    "while in the case @xmath26 , the situation is reversed .",
    "this feature can be understood from the force magnitudes of the two models ( see fig.[figforce ] ) .",
    "fig.[figratiouf ] shows the ratio of the aggregation time for the pd model to the did model against reduced initial separation @xmath48 .",
    "the aggregation time of the did model is generally larger than that of the pd model especially when the initial separation is small .",
    "the correction factor is more pronounced at high contrast . in the case @xmath22 or @xmath23 , we observe a non - monotonic dependence , the correction factor increases significantly when the spheres are close and decrease again when @xmath49 or less at high contrast .",
    "this behavior can be understood from the interparticle force ( fig.[figforce](b ) , the three panels on the right ) . at low contrast , the difference in magnitude between the pd and did force increases monotonically as the separation decreases .",
    "however at high contrast the difference increases first then decreases again as the separation decreases .",
    "perhaps it is more interesting to consider aggregation in a rotating electric field @xcite . consider a rotating field applied in the @xmath50-@xmath51 plane , @xmath52 , @xmath53 .",
    "the dimensionless equation of motion for the two spheres becomes = f_(r ) ^2 t + f_(r ) ^2 t , = -f_(r ) where @xmath54 are the displacement of one sphere from their center of mass and @xmath55 is the separation between two particles . in case of a large @xmath56",
    ", we may safely neglect the @xmath51 direction of the motion . for the pd approximation ,",
    "the dimensionless forces are @xmath57 and @xmath58 , respectively , which yields the analytic solution x=^1/5 the separation between two spheres is @xmath59 . for the did model",
    ", we integrate the equation of motion by the fourth - order runge - kutta algorithm , with a time step @xmath60 .",
    "note that the two particles can not aggregate if @xmath20 or @xmath21 in the rotating field because the repulsive force induced by longitudinal field @xmath61 is always larger than the attractive force induced by transverse field @xmath62 , while the particles spend equal times in both fields on the average .",
    "the displacement - time graph of the aggregations with @xmath23 in the two models are plotted in fig.[figaggrf ] .",
    "the shape of the displacement - time graph of did model is different from that of the pd model , especially when the two spheres are close , resulting in a large deviation between the did and pd models in the aggregation time .",
    "this behavior can again be understood by the interparticle force between the two spheres .",
    "we can see from fig.[figforce](b ) that the did longitudinal attractive force and its transverse repulsive force is about the same when the separation is small .",
    "since the spheres spend equal times in the longitudinal and transverse field and they change the direction of motion according to the rotating field , the displacement of the spheres can be estimated by the difference between the magnitude of the longitudinal attractive force and the transverse repulsive force , as there would be no displacement if the magnitude of the two forces are the same .",
    "thus when the two spheres are near , their velocity become smaller and have different shape in the displacement - time graph .",
    "on the other hand , the pd attractive force is sufficiently larger than its repulsive force at any separation .",
    "we further calculated the correction factor of the aggregation time for the pd model with respect to the did model in the same way as in the uniaxial field case .",
    "we plot the correction factor against the reduced initial separation @xmath48 with different parameters in fig.[figratiorf ] . the aggregation time is significantly increased when the mutual polarization of the two spheres is taken into account .",
    "the increase becomes even more pronounced and oscillating when the initial separation is small .",
    "the oscillation is due to the sensitive dependence on the initial polarization of dipoles when the spheres are close .",
    "here a few comments on our results are in order . in this work ,",
    "we have concentrated on the multipolar interactions between touching particles , which we believe are more important than the many - body or local - field effects @xcite . in the latter approaches , the particles in er fluids",
    "are still treated as point dipoles , while their dipole moments are determined by adding the local - field corrections . in the did model ,",
    "the additional terms arise from multipole interactions , rather than from local - field corrections .",
    "we have studied the aggregation time for two spherical particles .",
    "we should also examine the morphology of aggregation in polydisperse er fluids , due to the dipole - induced forces .",
    "to this end , it may be difficult to obtain the ground state lattice in polydisperse er fluids by using dynamic simulations alone , since both body - centred tetragonal and simple cubic or even honeycomb stacking lattices coexist in such systems according to kaski and coworkers @xcite .",
    "moreover , many external factors such as the numbers of particles , the size of the cell , etc . will affect the final results .",
    "we are currently trying to incorporate the did terms in the interaction energy . in this connection",
    ", we can also examine the recently proposed structural transformation by applying the uniaxial and rotating fields simultaneously to an er fluid @xcite .    in summary , we have used the did model to deal with computer simulations of polydisperse er fluids for the case when the dielectric contrasts of some particles can be negative .",
    "we studied athermal aggregation of two spherical particles both in uniaxial and rotating electric fields .",
    "we showed that an inclusion of the did force breaks the symmetry between positive and negative contrasts . as a result",
    ", the aggregation time can be much increased as compared to the pd model .",
