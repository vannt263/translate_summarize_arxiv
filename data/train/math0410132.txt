    "the study of billiards on euclidean polygonal tables has benefitted greatly from the use of the theory of riemann surfaces .",

    ", kerkhoff - masur - smillie @xcite showed that for almost every direction on a polygonal table , the billiard flow is ergodic . soon thereafter , veech @xcite identified a setting where the only non - ergodic directions are those of saddle connections ; these examples are identified by an associated group , the veech group , being a lattice fuchsian group . in @xcite , veech asked if in general these groups can be non - finitely generated .",
    "only recently have examples of infinitely generated veech groups been given @xcite , @xcite .",
    "here we study the geometry associated to some of these groups .",
    "the riemann moduli space @xmath0 is the space of smooth compact riemann surfaces of genus @xmath1 , up to biholomorphic equivalence .",
    "the holomorphic 1-forms on a riemann surface @xmath2 of genus @xmath1 form a @xmath1-dimensional complex vector space , @xmath3 .",
    "pairs @xmath4 with @xmath5 form a bundle @xmath6 ( of course , @xmath0 is not a manifold , but rather an orbifold , thus a fiber is @xmath7 ) .",
    "each pair @xmath4 ( with @xmath8 non - null ) identifies a translation structure on the real surface @xmath2 : local coordinates are defined by integration of @xmath8 . invoking the real structure of @xmath9 , there is a @xmath10-action on these translation surfaces : post - composition with the local coordinate functions .    to each @xmath4",
    ", there is thus a map from @xmath10 to @xmath0 , given by sending group elements to corresponding orbit elements .",
    "but , rotations act so as to leave the riemann surface @xmath2 fixed .",
    "thus there is an induced a map from @xmath11 to @xmath0 . with respect to the teichmller metric on @xmath0 ,",
    "this map turns out to be an isometric immersion of the hyperbolic plane @xmath12 .",
    "the resulting image is called the _ teichmller complex geodesic _ determined by @xmath4 .",
    "we will denote this by @xmath13 .",
    "the @xmath10-stabilizer of @xmath4 induces a subgroup of the oriented isometry group of the hyperbolic plane .",
    "this induced group is the _ veech group _",
    ", denoted @xmath14 .",
    "the teichmller complex geodesic is thus the image of the hyperbolic surface ( or possibly orbifold ) uniformized by the veech group ; the map between them is generically injective .",
    "we use this to show :    [ thmgeometry ] for any genus @xmath15 , there exists a complex teichmller geodesic in the riemann moduli space @xmath0 that has infinitely many cusps and infinitely many infinite ends .    we remind the reader of the definition and basic classification of ends of a hyperbolic surface below . informally , an _ end _ is a direction in which geodesics can leave compact subsets .",

    "we prove theorem [ thmgeometry ] by restricting to the case where @xmath4 satisfies the hypotheses of theorem [ inffatboys ]  an application of the riemann - hurwitz formula shows that we may assume that the corresponding @xmath16 be of genus two , we give explicit examples of such @xmath16 which admit non - periodic connection points in @xcite , it is now known @xcite , @xcite that the set of such examples is large  the existence of infinitely many cusps is proven in  [ manycusps ] , the existence of infinitely many infinite ends is proven in  [ manyends ] , that every direction of an infinite end is the limit of distinct infinite end directions is also proven in  [ manyends ] .",
    "we prove theorem [ thmbigcusp ] in  [ locend ] . in  2 we give background material on translation surfaces and certain @xmath10-actions , in  3 we discuss projections of horocycles to the moduli space @xmath0 .",
    "the main results rest upon the elementary tools presented in  4 .      that a hyperbolic surface uniformized by an infinitely generated fuchsian group of the first kind admits infinite ends can be deduced already from @xcite , theorem 16 .",

    "in order to establish notation , we review basic notions . see say @xcite for more details ; @xcite , @xcite and @xcite use related notation and notions . see also @xcite , @xcite , @xcite for recent related developments .      a _ translation surface _",
    "is a real surface with an atlas such that all transition functions are translations . as usual , we consider maximal atlases . given a riemann surface @xmath2 and a holomorphic 1-form @xmath26 , integration of @xmath8 induces local coordinates on @xmath2 away from the zeros of @xmath8 ; regarding @xmath9 with its standard structure as @xmath27 , transition functions are easily seen to be translations . in particular , directions of flow on a translation surface are well - defined , by pull - back from the plane .",
    "one easily checks that the translation surface associated to @xmath4 is well - defined up to isomorphism of translation surface ( such isomorphism is realized by local pure translations ) , see section 2.1 of @xcite for a more formal discussion .",
    "the holomorphic 1-form @xmath8 induces a flat metric on @xmath2 off of its zeros ; when the metric is completed , a zero of multiplicity @xmath28 gives a conical singular point , of cone angle @xmath29 .",
    "we consider only translation surfaces of this type ; the notation @xmath4 hence denotes both the ordered pair of riemann surface @xmath2 with holomorphic 1-form @xmath8 , and the translation surface structure , with which @xmath8 equips @xmath2 .",
    "given a translation surface @xmath4 , and an element @xmath30 , we can post - compose the coordinate functions of the charts of the atlas of @xmath4 by @xmath31 .",
    "it is easily seen that this gives again a translation surface , denoted by @xmath32 .",
    "given a translation surface @xmath4 , let @xmath33 denote the surface which arises from deleting the singularities of @xmath4 .",
    "an _ affine diffeomorphism _",
    "@xmath34 of @xmath4 is a homeomorphism of @xmath2 that restricts to a diffeomorphism of @xmath33 whose differential at all points is a constant element of @xmath10 . in other terms",
    ", @xmath34 induces a real - affine map in the charts of the @xmath8-atlas on @xmath2 , of constant ( jacobian ) derivative .",
    "the orientation - preserving affine diffeomorphisms form a group , denoted @xmath35 .",
    "the subgroup of @xmath10 which arises as the derivatives of affine diffeomorphisms is denoted by @xmath36 .",
    "if @xmath37 have the same derivative , then the diffeomorphism @xmath38 acts by pure translations .",
    "this diffeomorphism thus preserves the conformal structure on the underlying translation surface ; that is , @xmath38 is a conformal automorphism of the riemann surface @xmath2 ( that preserves @xmath8 ) .",
    "the kernel of the group homomorphism from @xmath35 to @xmath36 is hence certainly finite whenever @xmath2 is of genus greater than one . by pull - back on charts",
    ", each @xmath39 also gives a translation structure on the underlying surface .",
    "indeed , if @xmath31 is the constant derivative of @xmath40 with respect to the @xmath8-charts , then @xmath40 is an isomorphism of the translation surface @xmath32 with @xmath23 .",
    "thus , the @xmath10-stabilizer of @xmath4 is @xmath36 .",
    "fix some @xmath4 , and let @xmath41 be given by @xmath42 ; let @xmath43 denote the standard projection .",
    "note that the underlying riemann surface @xmath44 is common to the @xmath45-orbit of any @xmath46  the image of @xmath16 under a rotation is @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the complex number which induces the rotation .",
    "thus , @xmath49 induces a map ( from right cosets ) @xmath50 .",
    "the image of @xmath34 is @xmath13 , the _ teichmller complex geodesic _ associated to @xmath4 .",
    "right multiplication gives the natural right group action of @xmath51 on the cosets @xmath52 .",
    "the center , @xmath53 , of @xmath51 is a subgroup of @xmath45 , and one finds that @xmath54 acts faithfully .",
    "the @xmath18-stabilizer of the map @xmath34 is the _ veech group _ @xmath55 , the image in @xmath18 of @xmath56 .",
    "this is trivially verified : @xmath57 implies that there is some rotation @xmath58 such that @xmath59 .",
    "thus , the class @xmath60 is in the @xmath55-orbit of @xmath61 . that @xmath34 is single - valued on each such orbit",
    "is obvious .",
    "the map @xmath34 is generically injective ; it can only fail to be injective at some @xmath46 if @xmath62 is larger than the automorphism group of riemann surfaces corresponding to neighboring points of @xmath0 , see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "when the veech group normalizes a true surface , then @xmath34 gives a ramified cover normalizing , in the sense of algebraic curves , @xmath13 .    in @xcite ,",
    "veech proved that @xmath55 is a discrete subgroup of @xmath18 .",
    "that is , it is a fuchsian group . the celebrated _ veech dichotomy",
    "_ , also proven in @xcite , states that if @xmath14 is a lattice  that is , if @xmath63 has finite hyperbolic area  , then the linear flow in any direction of the surface @xmath4 is either ergodic or periodic .",
    "one thus says that a translation surface is a _ veech surface _ if @xmath14 is a lattice .",
    "we also say that @xmath4 is an _ arithmetic surface _ if @xmath14 is arithmetic , in that it is @xmath18-commensurable to @xmath64 .",
    "the teichmller metric on @xmath0 is found by giving the teichmller metric on the ( ramified ) cover teichmller space @xmath65 of @xmath0 ; the teichmller modular group ( equivalently , the mapping class group ) acts isometrically on @xmath65 , with quotient @xmath0 .",
    "thus , the teichmller metric descends to @xmath0 . we avoid direct discussion of teichmller space here ,",
    "the reader may wish to refer to , say , @xcite .",
    "if @xmath66 is a non - zero real , then the translation surfaces @xmath4 and @xmath67 differ only by scaling .",
    "this scaling and the @xmath10-action commute ; furthermore , the projection map @xmath68 ignores such scaling .",
    "thus , we can restrict our discussion to @xmath69 , the collection of area one @xmath4 .    in informal terms , whereas a conformal map of riemann surfaces takes infinitesimal circles to circles , a _ quasi - conformal _ map of a riemann surfaces takes infinitesimal circles to ellipses .",

    "now , if @xmath77 and @xmath30 , then the identity map on @xmath2 , from @xmath4 to @xmath78 has beltrami coefficient @xmath79 , where @xmath80 is the complex dilatation of the linear map given by @xmath31 on @xmath9 with its standard real structure .",
    "but , the map sending elements @xmath81 to @xmath82 is constant on right @xmath83-cosets .",
    "this can be shown by direct calculation , or see corollary 1 of @xcite .",
    "indeed , @xmath84 injectively identifies @xmath85 with the complex unit disk , @xmath86 .",
    "the teichmller metric on @xmath85 is the pull - back of the hyperbolic metric on @xmath86 .",
    "but , as @xcite show in their lemma 4.2 , the map sending @xmath87 by @xmath88 is conformal ; it is thus an oriented isometry .",
    "hence , the veech group is the stabilizer in the oriented isometry group of @xmath50 .",
    "it is reasonable to identify @xmath85 with @xmath20 , as does @xcite . in this case",
    "the stabilizer of the map @xmath89 giving the teichmller complex geodesic is again the veech group , but acting on the left by mbius transformations conjugated with the action of @xmath90 .",
    "this conjugating action corresponds to @xmath91 , the constant derivative of a coset representative of the index two subgroup @xmath92 in the full group of affine diffeomorphisms of @xmath23 .",
    "thus , @xmath93 _ is _ @xmath14 ; compare with proposition 3.2 of @xcite .    in what follows",
    ", we will ignore this innocuous conjugation , and consider @xmath14 acting on @xmath20 by mbius transformation .",
    "any translation surface of genus greater than one must have singularities .",
    "a geodesic line emanating from a singularity is called a _ separatrix _ , a separatrix connecting singularities ( with no singularity on its interior ) is a _",
    "saddle connection_. we call a point @xmath94 a _ connection point _",
    "if every separatrix passing through @xmath95 extends to a saddle connection .",
    "we say @xmath96 is a _",
    "parabolic direction _ for @xmath4",
    "if there is a parabolic element of @xmath14 whose associated affine diffeomorphism preserves the direction @xmath96 .",
    "( in fact , the full veech dichotomy states that the non - ergodic directions of a veech surface are parabolic . )",
    "we also call these associated affine diffeomorphisms parabolic . expressing @xmath96 as a slope",
    ", the point on @xmath22 associated to this slope is @xmath97 ; this is due to the fact that @xmath10 acts on @xmath4 by way of its _ linear _ action on @xmath27 , but the @xmath10-action on @xmath20 is _",
    "fractional linear_. thus for example , an element of @xmath10 arising from an element of @xmath35 which fixes the vertical direction ( should such an element exist ) acts on the extended hyperbolic plane so as to fix the boundary point @xmath98 , see figure  1 .",
    "a point @xmath94 of finite orbit under the group of affine diffeomorphisms is called a",
    "_ periodic point_. a point of finite orbit under the subgroup of affine diffeomorphisms generated by the two ( primitive ) parabolic diffeomorphisms for some pair of transverse parabolic directions is called a _ rational point _ for @xmath4 . in @xcite ,",
    "one shows that non - periodic points have dense orbits . in @xcite",
    ", we show that every connection point is a rational point .",
    "to date , constructions of infinitely generated veech groups rely on the following basic fact of fuchsian groups : ( 1 ) a fuchsian group of the first kind ( that is , whose limit set is all of @xmath99 ) is either a lattice group or else is infinitely generated . in @xcite , we used two further facts : ( 2 ) given a ramified covering @xmath100 of riemann surfaces , upon setting @xmath101 the translation surface @xmath4 is a _ balanced translation covering _ of the marked translation surface @xmath102 if every point of the fiber above a nonsingular branch point is ramified , in particular , @xmath14 is then commensurable to @xmath103 , where this latter is the image in @xmath17 of the affine diffeomorphisms which stabilize the branch locus of @xmath34 ; and , ( 3 ) if there is an element of this branch locus that is non - periodic ( that is , such that its @xmath104-orbit is of infinite order ) , then @xmath103 is of infinite index in @xmath17 ; in particular , it is thus not a lattice .",
    "therefore , the commensurable @xmath14 also fails to be a lattice .",
    "given any point of a translation surface , the directions of separatrices through the point are dense ( see , say , lemma 1 of @xcite , in turn a slight generalization of a result of @xcite ) ; the direction of any saddle connection on a veech surface is in fact a parabolic direction ; one finds that if the branch locus contains a connection point , then the parabolic directions of @xmath103 are dense in @xmath22 , and thus the limit set this group is certainly all of @xmath22 .",
    "now , if the connection point is non - periodic , then we conclude that that @xmath103 is infinitely generated ; again , the commensurable @xmath14 is therefore also infinitely generated .",
    "but , we show in @xcite that there exist @xmath16 that admit non - periodic connection points , and thus proved the existence of infinitely generated @xmath14 . + for an explicit example , we showed in @xcite ( see in particular proposition 7 there ) that the genus two surface given by the golden cross can be taken to play the role of @xmath16 .",
    "this surface has exactly one singularity , say @xmath105 ; let us also choose one of its infinitely many non - periodic connection points , @xmath95 . if @xmath106 is even , then we can take @xmath107 copies of our genus two surface , with a slit from @xmath105 to @xmath95 ; identify these with the usual process after having chosen some transitive permutation on @xmath107 letters .",
    "this gives a degree @xmath107 ramified covering , whose branch locus consists of @xmath108 , and which is totally ramified above each of these points .",
    "the riemann - hurwitz formula then shows that the covering riemann surface does have genus @xmath1 .",
    "one can choose the odd genus @xmath109 by way , say , of double coverings : choose @xmath110 connection points of our genus two surface ; create @xmath111 slits and glue two copies in the standard manner . for more on creating ramified coverings , see say @xcite .",
    "a _ cylinder _ on a translation surface @xmath4 is a maximal connected set of homotopic simple closed geodesics .",
    "if the genus of @xmath2 is greater than one , then every cylinder is bounded by saddle connections . upon cutting the cylinder along a line perpendicular to the direction of flow",

    "a cylinder has its affine dehn twist @xmath114 .",
    "the _ modulus _ of the cylinder is @xmath115 .",
    "if for some direction @xmath96 the surface @xmath4 decomposes into cylinders in this direction , then we say that @xmath96 is a _",
    "( completely ) periodic direction_. veech @xcite shows that a completely periodic direction @xmath96 is a parabolic direction if and only if the various cylinders in the direction @xmath96 gave commensurable inverse moduli : all @xmath116 are rational .",
    "the teichmller _ horocyclic flow _ is given by @xmath117 , where @xmath118 , with @xmath119 .",
    "the orbit of @xmath4 under this flow is called a _",
    "horocycle_.    suppose that @xmath4 is completely periodic in the vertical direction , that is @xmath4 has a decomposition into vertical cylinders .",
    "the effect of @xmath120 , with @xmath121 , restricted to a cylinder of the decomposition is to change the relative positions of the singularities on the right hand side of the cylinder with respect to those on the left .",
    "it is easily seen that on a given vertical cylinder of height @xmath113 and width @xmath112 , that a standard affine twist on the cylinder has been performed when @xmath122 .",

    "now , since @xmath338 is conjugated by @xmath31 to @xmath339 , it follows that when @xmath340 are equivalent modulo @xmath341 then the same point of the underlying surface is associated to both @xmath78 and @xmath342 .",
    "of course , for each @xmath343 , the set of these points @xmath259 is dense on the complement to the @xmath66 singularies .",
    "hence , we have a map from the @xmath10-orbit of @xmath4 to a dense subset , @xmath344 , of @xmath173 the universal curve restricted to @xmath331 , see figure 3 .        [ endsalign ] with notation as",
    "above , suppose that @xmath136 is an end of @xmath157 .",
    "then the image of @xmath136 in @xmath13 lies within the image of a subset @xmath347 of @xmath344 fibering above a cusp of @xmath348 .",
    "more precisely , if @xmath136 is a cusp , then @xmath347 is homeomorphic to @xmath349 .",
    "if @xmath136 is an infinite end , then @xmath347 is homeomorphic to @xmath350 , with @xmath351 a dense subset of @xmath352 .    *",
    "proof * suppose first that @xmath136 is a cusp .",
    "let @xmath353 be the direction on @xmath23 corresponding to @xmath136 as in lemma [ fatptsareinfenddir ] of  [ endhypsurf ] ; normalize so that this is the vertical direction .",
    "of course , @xmath96 is a parabolic direction : @xmath4 admits a cylinder composition in this direction , with all cylinders having commensurable inverse moduli .",
    "but , the balanced covering @xmath354 sends cylinders to cylinders .",
    "hence , @xmath96 is also a parabolic direction for @xmath16 , and is such that @xmath95 splits no cylinder irrationally .",
    "that is , either @xmath95 lies on the boundary of some cylinder of the decomposition of @xmath16 in this direction , or else splits some cylinder in a rational manner .",
    "if @xmath95 lies on the boundary of cylinders , then there is equality of sets of moduli of cylinders of the @xmath4 and of moduli of cylinders of the @xmath16-decomposition in this direction .",
    "hence , the minimum value , say @xmath355 , of @xmath356 such that @xmath357 belongs to @xmath341 is also the minimum value such that this is an element of @xmath36 . again since @xmath95 lies on the boundary of @xmath16-cylinders , the action of each @xmath358 fixes @xmath95 as a point on the underlying topological surface . hence",
    ", in accordance with the proof of theorem [ fiberunivcurve ] , @xmath359 with @xmath360 $ ] describes a circle in @xmath344 .",
    "there is some @xmath361 such that the horodisk of index @xmath362 projects to the cuspidal region of @xmath136 ; similarly , there is some @xmath363 such that the horodisk of index @xmath363 for @xmath16 projects to the cuspidal region of the cusp of @xmath331 corresponding to the parabolic element @xmath364 . let @xmath365 .",
    "we find that the image in @xmath13 of the horodisk of index @xmath130 of @xmath136 meets the image of the region @xmath366\\,,\\ , t > t\\,\\ } \\subset \\mathcal c^{0}$ ] .",
    "we indeed have that @xmath347 is homeomorphic to @xmath349 .",
    "if @xmath95 rationally splits some cylinder of @xmath16 , then it is still the case that the single commensurability class of the inverse moduli of the cylinder decompositions of @xmath4 and of @xmath16 agree .",
    "however , the parabolic element @xmath367 of @xmath341 as above is not an element of @xmath36 ; there is some finite power of this element , thus some @xmath368 with @xmath369 minimal , that does belong to @xmath36 .",
    "we find that the horocycle @xmath370 gives an @xmath185-fold cover of the corresponding horcycle of @xmath46 .",
    "we again can let @xmath366\\,,\\ , t > t\\,\\ } \\subset \\mathcal c^{0}$ ] .",
    "finally , suppose that @xmath136 is an infinite end .",
    "we continue with the normalization that the vertical direction on @xmath4 corresponds to @xmath136 .",
    "we have a decomposition into cylinders for @xmath4 , which projects to a decomposition of cylinders for @xmath217 .",
    "there are at least two commensurability classes of inverse moduli of cylinders for the @xmath4-decomposition ( for otherwise @xmath136 would be a cusp )  for no @xmath121 is @xmath371 .",
    "now , @xmath46 is a veech surface , hence this direction of a cylinder decomposition must be parabolic ; there is thus a sole commensurability class of inverse moduli for this cylinder decomposition , and we can define @xmath355 as above . since the balanced covering of @xmath217 has at least two such classes , @xmath95 must irrationally split some cylinder .",
    "but , this introduces at most one new commensurability class ; we find that @xmath4 has exactly two commensurability classes of inverse moduli of cylinders for its cylinder decomposition .",
    "of more importance , the orbit of @xmath95 under powers of @xmath367 is dense in the vertical circle of @xmath16 upon which @xmath95 lies . with @xmath130 as above , we now let @xmath372\\,,\\ , t > t\\,\\ } \\subset \\mathcal c^{0}$ ] .",
    "this is is homeomorphic to @xmath350 , with @xmath351 a dense subset of @xmath352 .",
    "theorem [ thmbigcusp ] now follows  each end of @xmath13 must be covered by some end of @xmath19 , but each of these is given by one of finitely many ends : the image of the fibering over one of the finitely many ends of @xmath331 .",
