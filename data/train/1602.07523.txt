    "the discovery of the quantum hall effect revealed the dramatic role that topological properties of quantum states can have on observable quantities . in the quantum hall effect , the transverse hall conductivity of a two - dimensional ( 2d ) electron gas is precisely quantized in the presence of a strong , static , and perpendicular magnetic field  @xcite .",
    "the first step towards a theoretical understanding of this effect was put forward by laughlin  @xcite . by considering a 2d electron gas confined to the curved surface of a cylinder , laughlin found that the quantized hall conductivity was related to the response of the system to an insertion of a magnetic flux through the ends of the cylinder . soon afterwards",

    "the appreciable remaining deviation that one can see in the plotted region around , say , @xmath198 can be attributed to the significant variation of the energy dispersion and the berry curvature across the magnetic brillouin zone for the relatively large @xmath199 considered here .",

    "in the previous section , we have studied the momentum - space integer quantum hall effect for non - interacting particles . in the presence of a very weak interaction , the ground state for bosons",
    "is still unique and gapped and one can expect that the integer quantum hall effect in momentum space is still observed with no qualitative nor quantitative change .",
    "the situation is far more interesting for stronger interactions , but still in the mean - field regime of dilute bose gases .",
    "for this regime , we have previously found within mean - field theory that the harmonically trapped harper - hofstadter model can have degenerate ground states that spontaneously break a rotational symmetry  @xcite . from the general theory of the quantum hall effect  @xcite , we know that a topological degeneracy of the ground state in a toroidal geometry typically implies fractional states .",
    "it is therefore natural to wonder if the degeneracy found in  @xcite for a mean - field regime can be somehow related to some kind of fractional states in momentum space and if one can access the fractional quantum hall effect in momentum space .",

    "while this negative result is , in a way , not surprising as the interaction we are considering is a mean - field one , it does not exclude at all the possibility of obtaining fractional states if one includes stronger beyond - mean - field interactions , as will be the subject of future work .     and",

    "as the trap center follows @xmath204 , we have found that when the trajectory is completed and the trap center comes backs to the original point @xmath107 , the ground state is transformed into a different degenerate ground state .",
    "this strange transformation of the ground states implies that there is at least one point within the region enclosed by the trajectory where the adiabatic motion is not well defined .",
    "one can see this by the following simple thought experiment .",
    "we can imagine making the trajectory @xmath204 gradually smaller , while fixing the initial and the final points at the origin @xmath107 .",
    "if the adiabatic motion is everywhere well defined inside the trajectory of @xmath204 , making the trajectory smaller does not change the initial and the final states , and the initial and the final states should always be different degenerate ground states . however , when the trajectory is sufficiently small , the initial and the final states should be the same , which is a contradiction .",
    "therefore , there must be a point within the trajectory of @xmath204 where the adiabatic motion is ill defined .",
    "the adiabatic motion can be ill defined , for example , either when the gap to excited states close , or when two ground states merge , or when the adiabatic trajectory reaches saddle points in the energy landscape .",
    "when the adiabatic motion is not well defined , the niu - thouless - wu formalism fails and it does not give rise to the quantum hall effect .",

    "the ground state is uniquely determined . at the middle of a plaquette @xmath203 ,",

    "it is at this central point @xmath203 where the adiabatic motion is ill defined in this mean - field model .    in more formal terms",
    ", the absence of fractional quantum hall physics in mean - field theory can be traced back to a crucial mathematical difference between the degenerate ground states in standard fractional quantum hall systems in the presence of strong interactions  @xcite and the ones predicted by the nonlinear schrdinger equation with the mean - field theory of  @xcite .    in the former theory ,",
    "the degenerate ground states belong to a linear sub - space so that any linear combination of these is also a ground state and the outcome of transport around a loop in @xmath92 space is a linear operation within the linear space of ground states ; in particular , when the loop is contracted to a point , this linear operation tends to the identity . on the other hand , in the latter case",
    ", the degenerate ground states correspond to discrete points in the phase space , so they can not be continuously deformed one into another as one contracts a loop .",
    "this explains why contracting a trajectory giving a non - trivial effect on the wave function like @xmath204 must necessarily hit some singular point .",
    "promising experimental systems in which to observe the quantum hall effect in momentum space are ultracold atomic gases , where the harper - hofstadter model has been recently realized  @xcite , and the harmonic trapping potential required to observe the momentum - space quantum hall effect is naturally present .",
    "the mean position of the wave function , which is proportional to the momentum - space hall current , is directly measurable through the center - of - mass position of the bose - einstein condensate .",
    "furthermore , the trap center can be controlled by applying a linear potential gradient whose strength can be varied in a well - controlled manner . once the system is cooled into a bose - einstein condensate  @xcite , the remaining experimental challenges for the quantitative validation of the momentum - space quantum hall effect are mostly of quantitative nature and reduce to the precise control of the trap center and the very high accuracy in the measurement of the center - of - mass position .",
    "another promising platform in which to observe the momentum - space quantum hall effect is offered by photonics systems , where the harper - hofstadter model has been realized in coupled cavity arrays  @xcite and a harmonic trapping potential can be readily applied by varying the resonant frequencies of the cavities in a position - dependent and time - dependent manner . in this case , however , a potential difficulty requiring further exploration comes from the interplay of the adiabatic features discussed in this work with the intrinsically driven - dissipative nature of the photonic system  @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we have investigated a novel form of the quantum hall effect that takes place in momentum space .",
    "exploiting the fact that the brillouin zone naturally has a toroidal structure , we have shown that the niu - thouless - wu formalism of the quantum hall effect in terms of twisted boundary conditions can be directly realized in momentum space .",
    "we have numerically verified the integer quantum hall effect in momentum space by analyzing the harmonically trapped harper - hofstadter model .",
    "our results open up new perspectives in the study of the quantum hall effect by allowing one to experimentally access various results for which the toroidal geometry is crucial . of particular interest",
    "is the investigation of fractional quantum hall states in momentum space , and of how the topological degeneracy of such states could be experimentally probed . because of the non - local and long - range nature of interactions in momentum space , fractional states in momentum space can not be obtained straightforwardly from the analogy to the real - space counterpart .",
    "although it has been anticipated that certain types of strong interactions in the presence of a confining potential and a flat dispersion with nontrivial topology can lead to the fractional states in momentum space  @xcite , many questions remain open .",
