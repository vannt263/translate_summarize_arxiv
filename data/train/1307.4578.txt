    "element abundance patterns in galaxies hold vital clues to the formation and evolution of their stellar populations .",
    "stellar sources of chemical enrichment contribute different abundance distributions on different timescales .",
    "this provides a potential clock for understanding how the integrated stellar population was built up over time and hence the star formation history of a galaxy .",
    "the power of this technique relies on our understanding of the different element abundance contributions , quality of the spectroscopic data and on being able to accurately recover representative element abundances in integrated stellar populations from the available data .",
    "supernova explosions contribute the main sources of chemical enrichments for future generations of stars .",
    "snii explosions enrich the interstellar medium ( ism ) in a short timescale ( @xmath0 yrs ) with a wide range of heavy elements ( including @xmath1 elements , iron - peak and r - process elements ) .",
    "snia explosions enrich the ism over a much more extended timescale , with mainly iron - peak elements , including prompt ( @xmath2 yrs ) and delayed ( @xmath3 to @xmath4 yrs ) enrichment @xcite .",
    "hence the @xmath1-element to iron ratio is an important indicator of the timescale of star formation .",
    "intermediate mass stars contribute to the lighter elements on relatively long timescale ( @xmath3 to @xmath5few @xmath6 yrs ) .",
    "additional contributions may come from red giant stars and cosmic - ray reactions , however these are not important for the elements considered in the present analysis .",
    "understanding of the relevant element abundance contributions and timescales is still uncertain in some cases .",
    "however the match of models to the abundance pattern observed in our own galaxy @xcite , within a factor of two for most elements up to the iron peak , gives some confidence that these contributions are broadly understood .",
    "methods of measuring abundance patterns in stellar populations range from colours ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which are known to harbour degeneracies ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to broad and narrow spectral features ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "another , related approach is to use spectral indices from scaled - solar populations to generate proxies for abundance ratios ( * ? ? ?",
    "* , their fig .",
    "there are efforts also at generating full integrated spectra ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and using full spectral fitting ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) for abundance ratio analysis , however those methods and models are still under development .",
    "information about metallicities , @xmath1-element to iron ratio and sometimes individual element abundances are recovered from spectral features .",
    "one widely used method is to apply element abundance response functions derived from theoretical stellar spectra , which quantify the changes in line - strength indices to variations of individual chemical elements .",
    "these response functions are built using theoretical model atmospheres , combined with radiative transfer codes and extensive line lists of atomic and molecular features .",
    "these are applied in a differential way , to base models from theoretical or observed spectra with standard abundance patterns , in order to generate spectra or indices for different abundance patterns ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this can have the advantage of reducing problems associated with absolute line strength predictions from theory , which are limited by incomplete line and molecular band transition information .",
    "much of the analysis of galaxy abundance ratios in the literature is based on the lick spectral indices ( with band definitions originally from * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* - hereafter wo97 ) and response functions for these from theoretical stellar spectra ( e.g. @xcite - hereafter k05 , @xcite - hereafter h02 , @xcite - hereafter l09 ) .",
    "differential application of theoretical models , to empirical star or simple stellar population ( ssp ) indices , is currently thought to be one of the best approaches to exploring stellar populations with different abundance patterns ( e.g. see discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "in particular the response functions ( r ) of k05 are widely applied . here are some examples .",
    "@xcite used r from both k05 and h02 to derive ages , metallicities and alpha - element abundances in globular clusters .",
    "@xcite used r from k05 , applied differentially to the empirical stellar library of @xcite , in order to generate ssp models with different abundance patterns .",
    "these ssps have since been used in several studies to measure ages and compositions of star clusters and galaxies . @xcite",
    "used r from k05 to derive ages and abundances of six elements to investigate chemical patterns in globular clusters .",
    "@xcite used r from k05 to derive ages and [ @xmath1/fe ] ratios of dwarf and giant early - type galaxies .",
    "examples of the use of other response functions in the literature include : @xcite who used the @xmath1-enhancement dependencies found in l09 , to study the effects of horizontal branch stars and the initial mass function on the integrated light of globular clusters .",
    "@xcite used response function from worthey et al .",
    "( private communication ) , based on the work of l09 , to study stellar abundance variations as a function of cold and ionised gas content in a sample of field early - type galaxies .    in this paper",
    "we test the robustness of some of those studies listed above that attempt to accurately represent the dependence of spectral line strengths on differing abundance patterns in stars .",
    "we do this by testing the response functions , on which those above studies rely , on a star - by - star basis , comparing model predictions to empirical observations of individual stars .",
    "this is likely to be one of the cleanest approaches to testing the methods used to measure abundance patterns that are most widely used in the literature .",
    "it has the drawback that real star abundance patterns are likely to be more complex than the theoretical models assume , however , it will provide a grounding for the methods used to measure [ @xmath1/fe ] .",
    "new empirical data for stars are now available , which these response functions can be tested against in order to check their accuracy against real stars .",
    "these data are from the medium - resolution int library of empirical spectra ( miles ) @xcite - hereafter sb06 , @xcite .",
    "this spectral library consists of 985 stars covering a wide range of parameter space in effective temperature @xmath7 , surface gravity ( @xmath8 ) and metal abundance ( characterised by [ fe / h]=log(n(x)/n(h))@xmath9 - log(n(x)/n(h))@xmath10 , where n(x)/n(h ) is the number abundance ratio of element x , such as fe , relative to hydrogen . ] ) . for 752 of these stars",
    "the [ mg / fe ] ratio has been compiled in a catalogue ( * ? ? ?",
    "* - hereafter m11 ) .",
    "this compilation is based on standardised results from high spectral resolution studies , plus new measurements from the medium resolution miles stellar library , calibrated to a standard scale using high resolution measurements . in this work",
    "we make use of [ mg / fe ] measurements as a proxy for all [ @xmath1/fe ] abundance ratios as a homogeneous nucleosynthetic class and compare differential results from these empirical data with corresponding differential predictions from theoretical models .",
    "this paper is set out as follows .",
    "an overview of current knowledge of the effects of differing abundance patterns in stars on their spectral features , published response functions and empirical data used in this paper are discussed in section 2 .",
    "then the response functions are applied and compared to empirical data in section 3 .",
    "effects on spectra due to differing abundance patterns are compared for theoretical and empirical spectra of stars in section 4 .",
    "a discussion of the results is given in section 5 and conclusions are given in section 6 .",
    "the chemical and physical conditions of a stellar photosphere are imprinted on its emergent spectrum .",
    "the major parameter that defines the overall shape of a photospheric spectrum is the effective temperature",
    ". then the abundance pattern , surface convection and surface gravity also affect its spectrum . in particular , we are interested in how the photospheric element abundance pattern affects its emergent spectrum .",
    "the overall metallicity [ z / h ] can affect the continuum shape as well as absorption line strengths .",
    "iron is the main element being analysed in most spectroscopic studies of stars ( especially fgk types ) to quantify the chemical abundance in a photosphere .",
    "this is because of the existence of a myriad of fei and feii lines in the optical range , that are measurable at high resolution and that contribute to spectral line strengths or narrow band indices at lower resolution .",
    "the effects of other elements can sometimes be more isolated to particular spectral features , however , to accurately measure these effects it is very important to be clear about what is meant by the metallicity of the star ( [ z / h ] or [ fe / h ] ) .",
    "this is true both for the observations and for the theoretical models used to investigate them .",
    "a simplification assumed in recent years , in order to probe beyond overall metallicity and to uncover the information available in abundance ratios for galaxies , is that all the @xmath1 elements behave in lock - step .",
    "this is a reasonable approximation based on the observational evidence for some @xmath1 elements from stars in our galaxy .",
    "however , it is not exactly correct ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , when handling the metallicity budget in stars , oxygen and carbon are important contributors , whose patterns do not follow the @xmath1 elements , iron - peak elements or global metallicity , but have their own significant contributions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "for this reason it is more directly linked to observations if models predict behaviours of varying abundance patterns at fixed [ fe / h ] ( i.e. a single important element ) rather than at fixed [ z / h ] , which is more open to interpretation .",
    "unfortunately this is not always the case and to recover changes at fixed [ fe / h ] from these models it is necessary to make assumptions about how [ z / h ] , [ fe / h ] and other abundance indicators such as [ @xmath1/fe ] are related .",
    "these uncertainties have been more widely discussed in the literature in recent years ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and are emphasised here to clarify the difficulties in accurately determining abundance patterns from observed stars or stellar populations , given the currently available models .",
    "response functions tabulate how much various spectral line strengths alter with element abundance changes in the theoretical model spectra .",
    "application of these response functions allows empirical or theoretical line strengths to be modified for particular abundance patterns , notably enhanced [ @xmath1/fe ] ratios , compared to that of local solar neighbourhood stars .",
    "particular response functions in the literature are :    * @xcite ( tb95 ) - models for 3 stars : a cool dwarf , a turn - off and a red giant star on a 5 gyr isochrone .",
    "response functions showed how the lick indices varied due to a factor of 2 increase in individual elements and in overall metallicity ( i.e. from [ x / h]=0.0 to [ x / h]=+0.3 ) .",
    "* @xcite ( h02 ) - similar to tb95 , but with updated spectral line lists , added h@xmath11 and h@xmath12 indices and carbon enhancements reduced to + 0.15 rather than + 0.3 as used for other elements varied in their study ( see worthey 2004 section 3.3 ) .",
    "this latter change was an attempt to prevent the c@xmath13 swan bands from becoming unrealistically strong in carbon - rich stars .",
    "their response functions for 3 stars can be obtained from http://astro.wsu.edu/hclee/htwb02 ) .",
    "* @xcite ( k05 ) - similar to tb95 , but for a wider range of initial metallicities and star types , with response functions again tabulated for a factor of 2 increase in element abundances from the base models .",
    "* @xcite ( t07 ) - generated response functions for a change of @xmath1 elements from [ @xmath1/h]=0.0 ( i.e. solar ) to [ @xmath1/h]=+0.4 .",
    "individual elements are not varied , but @xmath1 elements are enhanced as a group .",
    "they start from base stars that cover a wider range of atmospheric parameters than in tb95 , covering up to 5 values of @xmath7 and 4 values of @xmath14 .",
    "t07 do not give responses for overall changes in metallicity .",
    "these response functions have not yet been widely used subsequently in the literature .    * @xcite ( l09)- expanded the work of h02 and generated response functions for ssps using many ( @xmath15 ) theoretical star spectra at solar metallicity times 10 individual element enhancements ( at fixed overall metallicity ) .",
    "their theoretical spectra are binned to 0.5  per flux point ( however their response functions are not very sensitive to spectral resolution ) .",
    "plots of some comparisons with k05 for individual theoretical stars are given at http://astro.wsu.edu/hclee/nsspm@xmath16lick.html ; these show similar , but not identical , responses in general between k05 and their evaluations .    some of the above response functions varied the amounts of individual elements present in the atmospheres , however , they did not always track changes in opacity self consistently .",
    "for example , k05 tracked opacity changes for overall metallicity changes ( [ z / h ] ) , but treated individual elements like trace elements , whereas the theoretical spectra of l09 were consistently calculated for each abundance pattern .",
    "more recent theoretical spectra are available that take into account non - solar abundance patterns plus a more self - consistent approach ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in particular the theoretical stellar spectra of @xcite are compared to observational spectra in section 4 of this paper .",
    "response functions for lick indices are not generally available for these recent theoretical stellar libraries .",
    "table  1 shows basic characteristics , assumptions and tools used in the generation of published element response functions for stars .",
    "this shows the range of different models and assumptions used in generating these response functions ."
