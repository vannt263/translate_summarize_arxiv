    "the existence of 10@xmath0 m@xmath1 black holes ( bh ) in massive galaxies by @xmath5 , only a billion years after the big bang ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , poses one of the great unsolved problems in cosmological structure formation . in the @xmath6cdm paradigm ,",
    "early structure formation is hierarchical , with small objects at high redshifts evolving into ever more massive ones by accretion and mergers through cosmic time .",
    "for this reason it is generally supposed that the supermassive black holes ( smbh ) that power the @xmath5 _ sloan digital sky survey _ ( _ sdss _ ) quasars grow from much smaller seeds at earlier epochs . the origin of smbh and how they reach such large masses in such short times is a subject of ongoing debate .",
    "three modes of formation have been proposed for smbh seeds : the collapse of pop iii stars into 100 - 300 m@xmath1 black holes at @xmath7 @xcite , baryon collapse in 10@xmath8 m@xmath1 dark matter halos that have somehow bypassed previous star formation into 10@xmath9 - 10@xmath10 m@xmath1 bh at @xmath11 @xcite , and more exotic pathways like the relativistic collapse of dense primeval star clusters into 10@xmath9 - 10@xmath10 m@xmath1 bh ( see section 3.3 of * ? ? ? * for a recent review ) .",
    "stellar - mass smbh seeds form at @xmath7 when pop iii stars die in either core - collapse supernovae ( sne , 15 - 45 m@xmath1 ) or by direct collapse to a bh ( 45 - 100 m@xmath1 , @xmath12 m@xmath1 ) @xcite .",
    "this formation channel is favored by some because most dark matter halos will form a pop iii star at this epoch if they reach masses of @xmath13 10@xmath14 m@xmath15 @xcite . however , these bh have such low initial masses that they must continuously accrete at the eddington limit to reach 10@xmath0 m@xmath1 by @xmath5 .",
    "this is problematic for several reasons .",
    "first , numerical simulations have shown that pop iii stars usually evaporate the halos that give birth to them , so the bh are born starving ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "filamentary inflows and mergers later restore baryons to the halo but only after 50 - 100 myr @xcite , during which crucial e - foldings in mass are lost .",
    "second , preliminary studies indicate that once accretion commences , the bh itself emits ionizing radiation that disperses its own fuel supply , limiting its growth rate to a fraction of the eddington limit @xcite ( but see * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , if the seed bh is not confined to the halo , its duty cycle as it meanders through cosmological density fields is intermittent , which also curtails its growth @xcite .    until now ,",
    "20 - 40 m@xmath1 pop iii bh @xcite have been overlooked as candidates for smbh seeds because previous studies assume that primordial stars are @xmath4 100 m@xmath1 .",
    "however , there is a growing numerical and observational consensus that some pop iii stars are tens of solar masses , not hundreds .",
    "more recent , much larger ensembles of numerical simulations found many halos with central collapse rates consistent with 20 - 60 m@xmath1 for the final mass of the star @xcite and that a fraction of the halos form binaries in this mass range @xcite .",
    "furthermore , new simulations of the formation of pop iii protostellar accretion disks suggest that they were prone to fragmentation into as many as a dozen smaller stars @xcite .",
    "very preliminary calculations of i - front breakout from these disks indicate that ionizing uv radiation may terminate accretion onto the nascent star at @xmath13 40 m@xmath1 @xcite .    on the observational side , recent attempts to reconcile the nucleosynthetic yields of pop iii supernovae with the chemical abundances found in ancient , dim extremely metal - poor stars in the galactic halo suggest that 15 - 40 m@xmath1 primordial stars may have been responsible for most of the heavy elements expelled into the primeval igm @xcite .",
    "the failure to detect the distinctive odd - even nucleosynthetic signature of 140 - 260 m@xmath1 pair - instability sne in metal - poor stars to date reinforces the fact that some pop iii stars might not be very massive , but this pattern may have been masked by selection effects in the observations @xcite .",
    "low - mass pop iii bh are crucially different from more massive bh because they are born in supernova explosions rather than by direct collapse .",
    "asymmetries in the core - collapse engine can impart kicks of 200 - 1000 km / s to 20 - 40 m@xmath16 bh , ejecting them from the halos that gave birth to them . in this letter",
    "we examine the implications of natal kicks for low - mass pop iii black holes as candidates for smbh seeds . in @xmath17",
    "we review the formation pathways for low - mass pop iii bh . in @xmath18",
    "we calculate their post - supernova kinematics and retention fractions in halos . in @xmath19",
    "we conclude .",
    "three mechanisms can create pop iii black holes during stellar collapse . in order of increasing progenitor mass",
    ", they are fallback onto a neutron star ( ns ) during a supernova explosion , the direct collapse of a proto - neutron star into a bh without an explosion , and enclosure of the core by an event horizon without ever having attained nuclear densities @xcite .",
    "it is generally believed that core - collapse supernova explosion energies fall with increasing progenitor mass ( see * ? ? ? * for a review ) . at some point ,",
    "the explosion is too weak to fully overcome the binding energy of the star and enough ejecta falls back onto the ns to collapse it to a black hole @xcite . in even more massive progenitors , the core of the star collapses to a proto - neutron star without an explosion . about 1s after the onset of collapse",
    ", it gains so much additional mass that it can not support itself and it collapses to a black hole . in the most massive stars ( @xmath4 300 m@xmath20 ) the entropy of the core becomes so high that it never reaches nuclear densities .",
    "when enough material falls into the core it is suddenly engulfed by an event horizon , forming a bh of @xmath21 m@xmath16 @xcite . in general",
    ", the birth masses of pop iii bh vary from the minimum black hole mass ( @xmath22 ) up to the mass of the progenitor star .",
    "the first two formation processes can impart kicks ( initial velocity pulses ) to low - mass bh at birth .",
    "kick mechanisms generally fall into two categories : ejecta - driven kicks ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and neutrino - driven kicks  ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "ejecta kicks occur when low - mode instabilities erupt in the shock as it is driven outward by core bounce .",
    "they are likely seeded during collapse prior to bounce and result in explosion asymmetries that impart a net linear momentum to the neutron star ( ns ) .",
    "above 32 m@xmath1 fallback is total , and no impulse is imparted to the bh .",
    "neutrino kicks arise when magnetic field lines through the center of the star are crushed to extremely high densities during collapse , polarizing neutrinos created by the core during deleptonization and inducing anisotropies in emission that deliver an impulse to the ns .",
    "consequently , neutrinos can impart momentum to the ns ( and therefore the bh ) even if there is no explosion .",
    "pop iii core - collapse sne imparted kicks to neutron stars and black holes in the same manner as in the galaxy today .",
    "both kick mechanisms arise from asymmetries in the explosion engine that are determined by the structure of the inner core ( inner 3 - 4m@xmath23 ) of the star .",
    "we show the entropy profile of this core for three 25m@xmath20 stars at collapse in figure  [ fig : entropy ] : a zero metallicity star modeled by @xcite which collapsed with a mass of 24.7m@xmath20 , a zero metallicity star modeled by @xcite which collapsed with a mass of 24.9m@xmath20 and a solar metallicity star modeled by @xcite which collapsed with a mass of 12.9 m@xmath20 .",
    "since metallicity has very little effect on the structure below 6m@xmath20 , the engine will not differ significantly between a zero and solar metallicity star and they will exhibit similar kick distributions . the structures of the cores of very massive stars do change with metallicity but we do not expect kicks in their supernovae .",
    "fully developed models for kick mechanisms do not yet exist , so neither the number of pop iii seed bh kicks nor their velocity distributions can be calculated from first principles .",
    "however , natal kicks are commonly observed in compact remnants in the galaxy today and there are models that infer reasonable relationships between bh and ns kick distributions , which have been measured for a large sample of pulsars . in our study",
    "we adopt the pulsar velocity distribution of @xcite .",
    "it is bimodal , with each mode being described by a maxwellian : 40% have a dispersion of 90 km / s and 60% have a dispersion of 500kms@xmath24 .",
    "we derive velocity distributions for low - mass pop iii bh by assuming that in both mechanisms the black hole simply inherits the linear momentum of the ns : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the chandrasekar mass , 1.4 m@xmath1 .",
    "consequently , the bh kick velocity is inversely proportional to its mass .",
    "we derive our bh mass distribution from the latest estimates of @xcite for zero - metallicity stars , assuming rapid explosions .",
    "we show the distribution for these new fits in the left panel of figure [ fig : bh_mr ] . in reality",
    ", the bh could acquire more momentum than the ns intermediary because of the tendency of weak explosions to be more delayed , which allows low - mode instabilities additional time to develop and create greater asymmetry in the ejecta @xcite . with our black hole mass and pulsar velocity distributions we can estimate the retention fraction of bh in halos as a function of progenitor mass for a variety of escape velocities from the halo , as we show in the right panel of figure  [ fig : bh_mr ] . above @xmath27 ,",
    "the kick velocity drops to zero for the ejecta mechanism and we expect full retention for stars above this mass limit in the absence of neutrino kicks .",
    "if there are neutrino kicks , retention fractions for bh below 40 m@xmath1 are less than 10% in the halos in which most pop iii stars form ( those with @xmath28 5 km / s ) , and fall below 1% for bh below 32 m@xmath1 .",
    "the number of stars that 10@xmath14 - 10@xmath29 m@xmath1 halos typically form is not well constrained .",
    "the studies of pop iii protostellar disk fragmentation performed thus far do not follow the evolution of the disk for enough dynamical times to determine the ultimate fate of the fragments , which may later merge with the central object or be destroyed by gravitational torques before becoming distinct stars . ionizing uv radiation from one star - forming fragment or even from a nearby halo can also prematurely halt the collapse of other fragments in the disk , lowering the number of stars that eventually form in the halo ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we also note that while the evolution of the fragments in the disk is expected to be roughly coeval , their 5 - 10 myr quasistatic collapse times raise the possibility that the first star to form in the halo may explode and pre - empt the collapse of other fragments ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "consequently , the number of low - mass pop iii stars that occupy the halo likely ranges from one to at most ten .",
    "ejecta - driven natal kicks will evict most 20 - 32 m@xmath1 bh from their host halos , neutrino - driven kicks can drive more than 90% of 32 - 40 m@xmath1 bh from their halos , as we show in the right panel of figure [ fig : bh_mr ] .",
    "this guarantees that on average all the bh will vacate the halo even if ten stars originally formed in it .",
    "post - supernova kinematics thus strongly discourages 20 - 40 m@xmath1 pop iii bh from becoming supermassive because they are ejected from their fuel supply and deprived of crucial early e - foldings in mass .",
    "this process greatly reduces the parameter space in stellar mass from which smbh can originate ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , especially if pop iii stars were mostly less than 50 m@xmath1 .",
    "also , if a given halo is capable of supporting early continuous eddington rate accretion , a 20 - 40 m@xmath30 bh is much less likely to become supermassive than a 100 m@xmath1 bh , either because it is ejected from the halo at birth or because it must undergo additional e - folding times to reach large masses .    if most low - mass pop iii black holes were ejected from their halos at @xmath3 20 , where are they today ?",
    "if on average they depart their host halos at @xmath13 500 km / s , they are unlikely to encounter another halo capable of capturing them in less than a hubble time , and so many of these bh were exiled to the voids between galaxies . over time",
    ", they may have gradually gained mass as they encountered high - density regions .",
    "in contrast , pop iii bh above 40 m@xmath1 are unlikely to be born with kicks and remain in the halo , intermittently accreting and growing over cosmic time .",
    "these black holes are much more likely to reside in the galaxies into which their host halos were taken , a few of which may have become the supermassive black holes found in the sdss quasars today .",
