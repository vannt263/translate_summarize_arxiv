    "the concordance model of cosmology states that only @xmath0 of the mass / energy content of the universe is carried by identified particles , and the dominant contributions are unknown dark matter ( @xmath1 ) and mysterious dark energy ( @xmath2 ) @xcite .",
    "it is said that we are living in the age of `` precision cosmology '' , which is justified as a statement on the precision of observations , but certainly not on their understandings .",
    "the purpose of this talk is to recapitulate the genesis of the dark energy hypothesis and to show that it poses a serious crisis to theoretical cosmology .",
    "we argue that a possible resolution for this crisis may come from the proper treatment of effects from averaging .",
    "the vast majority of cosmic background photons ( photons without identified source ) are due to the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation , which is isotropic ( apart from a component due to our proper motion ) with fluctuations at the level of @xmath3 .",
    "thus the isotropy of the universe ( around us ) is an observational fact . on the other hand",
    ", there is no evidence that the milky way would be a distinguished place in the universe and thus it seems reasonable to follow copernicus to assume that we are not living at the centre of the universe .",
    "therefore , we end up with a homogeneous and isotropic model .",
    "the most general line element in such a friedmann - lematre model is given by @xmath4 where @xmath5 denotes the scale factor and @xmath6 the spatial curvature ( @xmath7 ) of the universe .",
    "in this model physical distances evolve with time , @xmath8 ( we may fix the present scale factor @xmath9 ) , where @xmath10 for @xmath11 .",
    "it is useful to define the rate of linear expansion @xmath12 . without using einstein s equations , just assuming that photons travel on null geodesics",
    ", one finds that light from distant objects is red - shifted by @xmath13 and the so - called luminosity distance ( defined by the observed flux from a source with known luminosity @xmath14 ) satisfies the hubble law @xmath15\\ ] ] at small redshifts @xmath16 .",
    "observations show that @xmath17 km / s / mpc @xmath18 and thus we know that the universe expands .",
    "the typical time scale of the cosmos is estimated as @xmath19 gyr , in concordance with the estimate on the age of the oldest objects in the universe @xcite .",
    "another interesting kinematic quantity is the acceleration ( deceleration ) of the cosmic expansion , encoded by the deceleration parameter @xmath20 .",
    "measurements of supernovae of type ia ( sn ia ) indicate that @xmath21 .",
    "one might wonder what could be the reason for the high symmetry of the observed universe .",
    "the answer of modern cosmology is the idea of cosmological inflation @xcite , an epoch in the very early universe that is held responsible for the universe s homogeneity and isotropy . on top of that , generic predictions of cosmological inflation",
    "are spatial flatness ( @xmath22 ) and the existence of tiny fluctuations @xcite , as observed at a level of @xmath3 in the cmb .",
    "we may ask how strong is the evidence for the acceleration of the universe , even before we wish to invoke a model for the matter content , without assuming the validity of einstein s equations .",
    "this test goes as follows .",
    "we ask at what level of confidence we can reject the null hypothesis that the universe never accelerated ( at @xmath23 few ) . for a spatially flat model ,",
    "as suggested by the idea of cosmological inflation , our null hypothesis can be expressed as @xmath24 based on two different sn ia data sets , two different fitting methods and two different calibration methods , we conclude that the null hypothesis is rejected at @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "this test can also be done in a calibration - free way , i.e. without assuming certain values for the hubble constant @xmath26 and the luminosity of the sne .",
    "instead , we consider the averaged value of the apparent magnitude @xmath27 of sne within a certain redshift bin relative to the averaged apparent magnitude @xmath28 of nearby sne with @xmath29 . defining a new quantity @xmath30 the null hypothesis can be written as @xmath31 . for the test",
    ", we average @xmath27 within redshift bins of width 0.2 . in fig .",
    "[ deltamu ] , the result is shown for two data sets ( gold @xcite and essence @xcite ) and two fitting methods ( mlcs2k2 @xcite and salt @xcite ) .",
    "the evidence for acceleration can be obtained by dividing @xmath32 by its error .",
    "the result for each redshift bin is given in table [ evidence ] .",
    "also given is the evidence obtained from averaging over the apparent magnitude of all sne with redshift @xmath33 .",
    "it is noticeable that using the calibration - free test weakens the evidence for acceleration ( 4.3@xmath34 ) compared to the result of the previous test ( 5.2@xmath34 ) .     the binned magnitudes @xmath32 ( see text ) for different sn data sets and light - curve fitting methods.,width=302 ]    .[evidence ] statistical evidence for acceleration from different redshift bins for different sn data sets and light - curve fitting methods .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     let us now ask what that implies for the dynamical model of the universe .",
    "the most general equation of motion for a homogeneous and isotropic universe under the assumption of diffeomorphism invariance and at most second order derivatives on the metric ( lovelock theorem @xcite ) provides us with the friedmann equation and the continuity equation ( @xmath35 ) @xmath36 @xmath37 and @xmath38 denote the energy density and pressure . @xmath39 and @xmath40 are newton s constant and the cosmological constant . in order to close this system of equations",
    ", we also need to impose an equation of state @xmath41 , which in many cases can be expressed as @xmath42 . a dimensionless energy density @xmath43 is introduced for convenience .",
    "we have already mentioned that cosmological inflation predicts a vanishing spatial curvature for all practical purposes and thus we can put @xmath44 . in the present universe , matter is non - relativistic ( cold ) , which means @xmath45 and thus we put @xmath46 .",
    "if we now would put @xmath47 as well , we arrive at the einstein - de sitter universe , which predicts @xmath48 and @xmath49 gyr .",
    "therefore , we can not stick to this simple model , as we have seen that @xmath50 at high confidence level and the oldest stars are known to be as old as @xmath51 gyr or even older @xcite .",
    "these facts became clear only about ten years ago  the 1998 cosmology revolution .",
    "one can rewrite the dynamic equations into @xmath52 the inequality and thus acceleration , can occur if either @xmath53 ( equivalent to @xmath54 ) or there exists some form of energy density with @xmath55 , a form of energy that has never been observed in the laboratory so far and is thus dubbed the `` dark energy '' . for @xmath56",
    "this reproduces the behaviour of the cosmological constant ( as @xmath57 in that case ) , which is thus a special case of dark energy .",
    "so a minimal model consistent with the predictions of cosmological inflation and allowing for the observed accelerated expansion of the universe is given by @xmath58 and @xmath59 and thus @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "this model is called the flat @xmath40cdm ( cold dark matter ) model or concordance model , as it is currently in good agreement with all cosmological observations .",
    "one can test for a possible deviation from @xmath44 or @xmath46 by means of cmb observations , sn ia and the baryon acoustic oscillations and finds that there is no observational evidence to question the validity of the flat @xmath40cdm model @xcite .",
    "let us stress that an important assumption in the reasoning described above is the homogeneity and isotropy of the universe and thus it is also important to test this assumption with the help of sn ia .",
    "a simple test can be done by fitting the hubble diagram ( @xmath62 vs. @xmath63 ) for sne from just one hemisphere and comparing the result of the fit to the opposite half of the sky @xcite .",
    "weinhorst and one of the authors have analysed four different sn data sets and find a statistically significant deviation from the isotropy of the hubble diagram .",
    "however , it seems that these anisotropies are aligned with the equatorial coordinate system ( aligned with the earth s axis of rotation ) and are thus likely to reflect systematic problems in the sn ia observation or analysis .",
    "another recent analysis revealed anisotropies in the hubble diagram obtained by the hst key project @xcite .",
    "if these anisotropies would be confirmed by future sn surveys and a systematic effect could be excluded , this would pose a serious challenge to the interpretation of hubble diagrams in the friedmann - lematre context .",
    "thus it seems that the concordance model is able to describe everything , however there are three conceptual problems in this model .    * the cosmological constant problem . *",
    "we miss out a fundamental understanding of the vacuum energy of quantum fields .",
    "this vacuum energy density is indistinguishable from a cosmological constant and thus we have introduced an element to the universe that we do not understand .",
    "the solution for this issue must be expected from a future theory of quantum gravity , as gravity ( i.e. geometry of space - time ) is the only `` force '' that couples to the energy density of the ( quantum field ) vacuum .",
    "thus this problem is obviously beyond the scope of what we can hope to understand currently .    *",
    "the coincidence problem(s ) . *",
    "the second problem however is a pure cosmological one .",
    "it is called the coincidence problem and there are two ways to formulate it .",
    "the first formulation has some anthropic touch , but is widely used : how does it come that @xmath64 ?",
    "this is indeed surprising .",
    "assume we would have lived when the universe had half ( twice ) of its present linear size [ at @xmath65 ( -1/2 ) ] , the ratio @xmath66 would be larger ( smaller ) by almost an order of magnitude .",
    "it is therefore quite surprising that we observe @xmath67 at @xmath68 .",
    "one can reformulate the above situation via replacing mankind by large - scale - structures on the typical scale for structure formation . according to inflationary cosmology ,",
    "the primordial fluctuations in matter and metric are free of any scale .",
    "the only scale that enters in the physics of the large scale structure is the horizon scale at matter - radiation equality .",
    "this scale appears because the radiation pressure acts against the gravitational instability in the early universe and structure growth starts only once the pressure support fades away .",
    "thus the shape of the power spectrum of density fluctuations is changing at this scale . according to the concordance model , the horizon scale at matter - radiation equality",
    "is seen at the @xmath69 mpc scale today .",
    "scales above that show the primordial slope of the spectrum , scales below that exhibit a substantially decreased slope .",
    "it is now interesting to observe that those structures grow to typical density contrasts of order @xmath70 and it turns out that @xmath71 is the epoch when the typical scale of hierarchical structure formation starts to evolve non - linear ( i.e. it decouples from the overall cosmological expansion ) .",
    "the coincidence is that this is also the epoch when acceleration seems to set in @xcite .",
    "note that these large structures are indeed observed , e.g. the sloan great wall and various big voids , as big as a few @xmath69 mpc @xcite .    *",
    "the averaging problem .",
    "* this is an old question in general relativity @xcite .",
    "solving the einstein equations for an averaged space - time is certainly not the same as averaging the einstein equations for a very inhomogeneous and anisotropic space - time , because these two operations , i.e. averaging and time evolution do not commute .",
    "thus the issue is , how big is this effect and what are its observational signatures . again",
    "the scale of interest must be the @xmath69 mpc scale , as on much smaller scales , say @xmath72 mpc objects like galaxies have already presumably undergone the process of violent dynamical relaxation and formed stationary bound systems that can not be treated like dust particles anyway .",
    "however it is clear that for objects like the sloan great wall , which just started to collapse yesterday , there might be important effects showing up in the averaging process .    in summary ,",
    "these three aspects are entangled with the issues of inhomogeneities and anisotropies in the local universe .",
    "the beginning of the domination of dark energy coincides with the onset of structure formation .",
    "consequently , light may be shed on the dark energy crisis ( i.e. the accelerated expansion of the universe ) by studying the averaging problem in the perturbed space - time .",
    "an attempt for setting up an formalism to handle this problem has been pioneered by buchert @xcite .",
    "these problems provide a good motivation to consider the possibility that dark energy is not a fundamental component of the universe , but our averaged description of the universe is not appropriate for a correct interpretation of observations @xcite . indeed many cosmological observations are averages .",
    "two important examples are the power spectrum @xmath73 , which is a fourier transform and thus a volume average weighted by a factor @xmath74 , and the hubble constant @xmath26 .",
    "let us consider an idealised measurement of @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "one picks @xmath75 standard candles in a local physical volume @xmath76 ( e.g. sn ia in milky way s neighbourhood out to @xmath77 mpc ) , measures their luminosity distances @xmath78 and recession velocities @xmath79 , and takes the average @xmath80 . in the limit of a very big sample",
    ", it turns into a volume average @xmath81 . for objects at @xmath16 ,",
    "the spatial average is appropriate for the average over the past light cone , as the expansion rate of the universe is not changing significantly at time scales much shorter than the hubble time .",
    "we now recapitulate the formulation of buchert , which we will use below to argue that the averaging effect is indeed sizeable and does give important contributions to cosmology :    buchert s setup is well adapted to the situation of a real observer . on large scales , a real observer is comoving with matter , uses her own clock , and regards space to be time - orthogonal .",
    "these conditions are the definition of the comoving synchronous coordinate system .",
    "buchert used physically comoving boundaries , which is the most natural approach in this setup . in the following the universe",
    "is assumed to be irrotational as a consequence from cosmological inflation .    in synchronous coordinates ,",
    "the metric of the inhomogeneous and anisotropic universe is @xmath82 , and the spatial average of an observable @xmath83 in a physically comoving domain @xmath84 at time @xmath85 is defined as @xcite @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the volume of the comoving domain @xmath84 .",
    "we may introduce an effective scale factor @xmath88 @xcite @xmath89 the effective hubble expansion rate is thus defined as @xmath90 ( @xmath91 being the volume expansion rate ) .    from the definition ( [ average ] ) , we obtain effective friedmann equations @xcite from averaging einstein s equations , @xmath92 where @xmath93 and @xmath94 are the energy density and pressure of an effective fluid , @xmath95 @xmath96 is the kinematical backreaction ( @xmath97 being the shear scalar ) , and @xmath98 the averaged spatial curvature .",
    "they are related by the integrability condition @xcite @xmath99 we define the equation of state for the effective fluid as @xmath100 .",
    "it is highly remarkable that any spatially averaged dust model can be described by an effective friedman - lematre model .",
    "we can map this effective fluid on a model with dust and  dark energy \" .",
    "let @xmath101 be the number density of dust particles , and @xmath27 be their mass .",
    "for any comoving domain @xmath102 . for a dust universe , in which @xmath103 , we identify @xmath104 , and from ( [ rhoeff ] ) the dark energy is hence described by @xmath105 . from ( [ integ ] )",
    "we find that constant @xmath106 corresponds to the case of a cosmological constant @xmath107 .",
    "equations ( [ buchert ] ) and ( [ rhoeff ] ) are not closed and additional input is required .",
    "below we close them by means of cosmological perturbation theory .",
    "to study the scale dependence of physical observables @xmath108 , @xmath98 , @xmath109 , @xmath110 and @xmath111 , we calculate them to second order in a perturbative series of the effective scale factor @xmath88 . we start from a spatially flat dust model .",
    "its scale factor @xmath112 is different from the effective scale factor @xmath88 in ( [ ad ] ) , and their relation was provided in @xcite . in synchronous gauge ,",

    "the solutions for @xmath114 and @xmath115 are given in terms of the time independent peculiar gravitational potential @xmath118 : @xmath119 and @xmath120 ( only growing modes are considered ) @xcite .",
    "@xmath121 is related to the hypersurface - invariant variable @xmath122 @xcite by @xmath123 .",

    "the dependence on cosmic time of these averaged quantities can be found in @xcite , and their leading terms are gauge invariant @xcite .",
    "we now turn to the estimate of the effects of cosmological backreaction as a function of the averaging scale @xmath127 .",
    "we show below that cosmological averaging produces reliable and important modifications to local physical observables and determine the averaging scale at which @xmath128 corrections show up .",

    ", a @xmath149 effect is expected up to scales of @xmath150 mpc .",
    "note that the curvature of the universe has been measured at the few per cent accuracy in the cmb @xcite .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that even small curvatures might influence the analysis of high-@xmath63 sne significantly .",
    "it is now interesting to discuss the fluctuation of the local measurement of the hubble expansion rate , @xmath151 the leading contribution to this effect involves the averaged curvature terms and therefore can not be thoroughly described in a newtonian setup @xcite .",
    "an effect larger than @xmath128 shows up for @xmath152 which reads @xmath153 mpc at small redshifts .",
    "let us compare ( [ onseth ] ) with observations from the hst key project @xcite .",
    "we use 68 individual measurements of @xmath26 in the cmb rest frame from sn ia , the tully - fisher and fundamental plane relations ( tables 6 , 7 and 9 in @xcite ) .",
    "the respective objects lie at distances between 14 mpc and 467 mpc . as ( [ onseth ] ) can be trusted only above 30 mpc , we drop the 4 nearest objects .",
    "be @xmath154 , @xmath155 and @xmath156 the distance , hubble rate and its @xmath157 error for the @xmath158th datum , with increasing distance .",
    "we calculate the averaged distance for the nearest @xmath159 objects by @xmath160 , with weights @xmath161 .",
    "an analogue holds for the averaged hubble rate @xmath162 , i.e. @xmath110 for different subsets .",
    "the empirical variance of each subset is @xmath163 $ ] .",
    "we stress that ( [ onseth ] ) is insensitive to global calibration issues .",
    "the comparison of our result ( [ onseth ] ) with the hst key project data is shown in fig .",
    "global \" @xmath26 is the central hst value 72 km / s / mpc @xcite .",
    "we find that the theoretical curve ( @xmath164 ) matches the experimental data fairly well , without any fit parameter in the panel .",
    "since ( [ onseth ] ) is just an estimate , we vary the result by factors of @xmath165 and @xmath166 , which gives lower and upper estimates to the theoretical curve . in fig .",
    "2 , the experimental data and their error bars are in agreement with these estimates .    before we can claim that we observe the expected @xmath167 behaviour of ( [ onseth ] ) and thus evidence for cosmological backreaction , we have to make sure that the statistical noise can not account for it .",
    "the expected noise is given by means of the variance of ( [ onseth ] ) in the situation of a perfectly homogeneous and isotropic model with measurement uncertainties @xmath156 .",
    "in the case of a perfectly homogenous coverage of the averaged domain with standard candles , we expect a @xmath168 behaviour . in fig .",
    "2 , we show the statistical noise for the actual data set , which turns out to be well below our estimate ( [ onseth ] ) and the data points . at @xmath169 @xmath170 mpc ,",
    "the value of @xmath110 differs from its global one by about @xmath128 @xmath171 , whereas the expected variance for a homogeneous and isotropic universe is only @xmath172 @xmath173 .",
    "what can we conclude so far ?",
    "we showed that the large scale structure affects the observed hubble expansion rate and that the averaged spatial curvature leads to sizeable corrections up to scales of about 200 mpc .",
    "consequently , we must expect that also other cosmological probes at @xmath174 , like galaxy clusters or galaxy redshift surveys , could be affected by cosmic averaging .",
    "is that enough to explain dark energy ?",
    "currently , this is not the case . in our framework",
    "an effective acceleration is possible below scales of 20 mpc .",
    "but sn ia observations show strong evidence for the acceleration of the universe , based on objects much more distant than that .",
    "it seems to take more to explain dark energy .",
    "a quite attractive idea is a universe in which large voids dominate the universe s volume , see @xcite .",
    "these works rely on well motivated toy models .",
    "it remains to be shown that these void dominated cosmologies follow from the inflationary paradigm .",
    "on the other hand , our analysis is based on an almost scale - invariant power spectrum predicted by inflationary cosmology , but is limited to @xmath16 , as the average must be taken on the past light cone and not on a spatial slice ( see , e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "a formalism ( like buchert s one for spatial averaging ) for the light - cone averaging of an arbitrary inhomogeneous and anisotropic space - time is needed before we can know if dark energy is merely an illusion due to averaging .",
