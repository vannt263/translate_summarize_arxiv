    "is briefly explained in @xcite and the reference therein .",
    "there is another equivalent definition : a subvariety is legendrian if its tangent bundle is contained in the contact distribution on @xmath0 .",
    "it is explained and presented for example in @xcite .",
    "[ definition_decomposable ] let @xmath6 and @xmath7 be two symplectic vector spaces and let @xmath8 and @xmath9 be two legendrian subvarieties .",
    "now assume @xmath10 and @xmath11 , i.e.  @xmath12 is the joint of @xmath13 and @xmath14 meaning the union of all lines from @xmath13 to @xmath14 .",
    "now , clearly , the affine cone of @xmath12 is the product @xmath15 ( where @xmath16 is the affine cone of @xmath17 ) . in such a case",
    "we say that @xmath12 is a _ decomposable legendrian variety_. we say that a legendrian subvariety in @xmath18 is _ indecomposable _ if it is not of that form for any non - trivial symplectic decomposition @xmath19 .",
    "we state the following conjecture :    [ theorem_automorphisms_are_symplectic ] let @xmath20 be an irreducible indecomposable legendrian subvariety and let @xmath21 be a connected subgroup preserving @xmath12 .",
    "then @xmath22 is contained in the image of the natural map @xmath23 .",
    "we prove the conjecture in several cases .",
    "it is quite natural to believe , that if a linear map preserves a form on a big number of linear subspaces , then it actually preserves the form ( at least up to scalar ) . with this approach , (",
    "6.4 ) proved the conjecture in the case where the image of @xmath12 under the gauss map is non degenerate in the grassmannian of lagrangian subspaces in @xmath24 .",
    "unfortunately , this is not enough - for example @xmath25 has a degenerate image under the gauss map and this is one of the simplest examples of smooth legendrian subvarieties .    in section [ section_proof_of_the_conjecture ]",
    "we prove :    [ corollary_that_conjecture_is_true_for_smooth ] if @xmath20 is a smooth legendrian subvariety which is not a linear subspace and @xmath21 is a connected subgroup preserving @xmath12 , then @xmath22 is contained in the image of the natural map @xmath23 .    the theorem is applied to classify smooth toric legendrian subvarieties .",
    "so in section [ section_toric ] we choose appropriate coordinates to reduce this problem to some combinatorics ( for surface case  see section [ section_toric_surfaces ] ) and some elementary geometry of convex bodies ( for higher dimensions  see section [ section_higher_dimensional ] ) .",
    "eventually we get :    every smooth toric legendrian subvariety in a projective space is isomorphic to one of the following :    * a linear subspace , * @xmath25 , * @xmath26 * or @xmath27 blown up in three non - colinear points .    for proofs",
    "see corollaries [ smooth_toric_surfaces ] and [ smooth_toric_varieties ] . the linear subspace is not really interesting , the products @xmath28 and @xmath29 are well known ( see for example @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the last case of blow up is not yet described in the literature .",
    "the author would like to thank especially jarosaw winiewski for his comments and support .",
    "also i am grateful to micha kapustka , grzegorz kapustka , adrian langer , zbigniew jelonek , michel brion and the anonymous referees for their precious remarks and hints .",
    "we would like to make sure that the torus acting on a legendrian variety acts via symplectic automorphisms of the associated symplectic vector space .",
    "therefore in this section we partially answer the question , whether a projective automorphism of a legendrian variety must be symplectic .",
    "one obvious remark is that homotheties act trivially on @xmath30 , but in general are not symplectic .",
    "therefore , it is more convenient to think of conformal symplectomorphisms :    a linear automorphism @xmath31 of a symplectic vector space @xmath32 is called a _ conformal symplectomorphism _ if @xmath33 for some constant @xmath34 .",
    "we denote by @xmath35 the group of all conformal symplectomorphisms of @xmath18 and by @xmath36 the tangent lie algebra .",
    "consider the following example :    [ example_degenerate ] let @xmath37 be a legendrian subvariety contained in a hyperplane .",
    "then by ( * ? ? ?",
    "3.4 ) the vector space @xmath18 admits a symplectic decomposition @xmath38 , where @xmath39 and @xmath12 is a cone over @xmath40 with a vertex in @xmath41 .",
    "then a linear automorphism that acts as @xmath42 on @xmath43 and as @xmath44 on @xmath45 preserves @xmath12 and is definitely not a conformal symplectomorphism , unless @xmath46 .",
    "therefore it is clear , that if we hope for a positive answer to the question posed in the beginning of this section we must assume that our legendrian variety is non degenerate ( i.e.  not contained in any hyperplane ) .",
    "another natural assumption is that @xmath12 is irreducible  one can also easily produce a counterexample if we skip this assumption . yet",
    "still this is not enough .",
    "let @xmath47 be a decomposable legendrian variety .",
    "then as in example [ example_degenerate ] we can act via @xmath48 on @xmath6 and via @xmath49 on @xmath7 - such an action will preserve @xmath12 and again in general it is not conformal symplectic .",
    "this explains that the assumptions of our conjecture [ theorem_automorphisms_are_symplectic ] are necessary .",
    "yet we must note , that decomposable varieties get very singular , unless they are linear space .",
    "our main interest is in smooth legendrian subvarieties .",

    "we are interested in knowing when the toric projective surface with weights of torus action @xmath258 @xmath259 is smooth .",

    "then @xmath12 is the blow up of @xmath27 in three non - colinear points .",
    "we must consider two cases ( see figure [ figure_surface_proof ] ) : either @xmath268 ( which means that @xmath269 is in the interior of the square @xmath270 ) or @xmath271 ( so that @xmath269 is outside or on the border of the square ) .     and @xmath272 ,",
    "the weight @xmath269 is located somewhere in the gray square .",
    "the two cases we consider are if @xmath269 is also inside the square @xmath270 ( left figure ) or it is outside ( right figure ) . in the second case , a necessary condition to get a smooth variety ,",

    "it is just an easy explicit verification that @xmath12 is not smooth with these additional weights in the interior .    in the other case",
    ", for a vertex @xmath154 of the polytope @xmath274 we define the sublattice @xmath275 to have the origin at @xmath154 and to be generated by @xmath276 since @xmath12 is smooth , for every vertex @xmath154 the vectors of the edges meeting at @xmath154 must form a basis of @xmath275 ( compare with ( * ? ? ? * prop.2.4 & lemma 2.2 ) ) .",
    "in particular , if @xmath277 ( it is immediate from inequalities ( [ inequalities_for_surface ] ) that @xmath154 is indeed a vertex ) , then @xmath278 can be expressed as an integer combination of @xmath279 and @xmath280 ( see the righthand side of figure [ figure_surface_proof ] ) .",
    "so write : @xmath281 for some integers @xmath282 and @xmath283 .",
    "it is obvious that @xmath282 and @xmath283 must be strictly positive , since @xmath284 is in the cone generated by @xmath285 and @xmath286 with the vertex at @xmath287 .",

    "if @xmath289 , then we easily get that : @xmath291 hence @xmath292 and by inequalities ( [ inequalities_for_surface ] ) we get @xmath293 and therefore ( since the @xmath222 s are coprime ) @xmath294 which is example [ example_line_times_conic ] .    if on the other hand @xmath290 , then @xmath295 and hence by inequalities ( [ inequalities_for_surface ] ) and since the @xmath222 s are coprime , we get @xmath296 , which is example [ example_plane_blown_up ] .",
    "in this subsection we assume that @xmath299 .",
    "by means of the geometry of convex bodies we will prove there is only one smooth toric non degenerate legendrian variety in dimension @xmath300 and no more in higher dimensions .",
    "we use theorem [ theorem_toric_legendrian ] so that we have a toric variety with weights : @xmath301 where the @xmath222 s are coprime positive integers with @xmath302 .",

    "so @xmath330 is a supporting hyperplane for the face , which is a simplex of dimension @xmath331 and therefore all its edges are also edges of @xmath306 as claimed in ( a ) .",
    "[ classification_toric_higher_dimensional ] let @xmath20 be a toric non degenerate legendrian variety of dimension @xmath209 satisfying ( @xmath214 ) ( see page ) . if @xmath299 and normalisation of @xmath12 has at most quotient singularities , then @xmath303 and @xmath337 .",
    "since the normalisation of @xmath12 has at most quotient singularities , it follows that the polytope @xmath306 is simple , i.e.  every vertex has exactly @xmath209 edges ( see @xcite or ( * ? ? ?",
