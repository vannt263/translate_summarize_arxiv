    "stimulated brillouin scattering ( sbs ) is the coherent nonlinear interaction between light and sound in matter  @xcite .",
    "it was initially predicted by brillouin  @xcite and subsequently observed in quartz shortly after the invention of the laser  @xcite .",
    "it is a third - order nonlinear process with several technological applications . under suitable conditions including narrow pump sources",
    ", the effect can be very strong  it has the lowest threshold of all nonlinear processes in standard optical fibres  @xcite .",
    "still , long interaction lengths are usually required to obtain appreciable interaction at moderate light intensities . as a result",
    ", most existing or proposed applications such as brillouin lasers  @xcite , all - optical isolators  @xcite or in microwave photonics  @xcite are based on optical fibers or on - chip waveguides .",
    "the interaction in conventional fibers is dominated by electrostriction and the photoelastic effect , which , until relatively recently , were viewed as the only significant processes underlying sbs .    due to the nonlinear nature of the process , however , the interaction can be dramatically increased in strength by confining the optical mode more tightly , thereby increasing the field intensity for the same transmitted power .",
    "consequently , theoretical and experimental investigations of sbs in structured fibers and integrated photonic waveguides have recently received considerable attention  @xcite with new physical mechanisms  @xcite being found to contribute to the sbs gain .",
    "in addition to the intensity enhancement , such structured waveguides further differ from traditional systems such as step - index fibers in that they support a broad variety of acoustic and optical modes . as solutions to linear wave equations , both sets of modes must respect the waveguide s symmetries ( rectangular for many integrated waveguides , triangular or hexagonal for many photonic crystal or suspended core fibers ) , as expressed by their corresponding point groups .",
    "these symmetries play a key role in the question of whether a given combination of optical and acoustic modes can have non - zero sbs - interaction .",
    "this fact has been recently studied for the specific case of a rectangular waveguide ; qiu  et  al .  @xcite",
    "numerically computed sbs gains for a range of possible interactions and found starkly different gains for different mode combinations .    in this paper , we approach sbs interactions on a formal level using group representation theory .",
    "we derive clear selection rules for sbs in rectangular , triangular and hexagonal waveguides , these being the most common point - groups arising in photonic waveguides .",
    "although the formalism of group theory is a well - established approach in studying physical interactions of all types , its use in multi - wave interactions in the context of photonic waveguides has been relatively limited .",
    "the definitive categorization of symmetry classes for optical modes was given by mcisaac  @xcite , however the acoustic modes have not been similarly analyzed , and a systematic tabulation of the different types of acoustic modes , including their symmetries and possible degeneracies , is one aim of the present study .",
    "more importantly , sbs involves interactions between optical and acoustic modes in nonlinear combination , and the correct conjunction of modes that will permit a non - zero contribution to the gain is a non - trivial problem . here , we systematically show which acoustic modes can be used to drive sbs transitions between optical modes , and conversely , which optical modes can be used to generate desired acoustic vibrations .    to help motivate our treatment",
    ", we note that sbs in structured waveguides is an unusually complex nonlinear interaction , because of the complicated nature of the acoustic dispersion relation which features many modes of different symmetry at moderate acoustic frequencies . in contrast",
    ", for sbs in step index fibers , only one acoustic mode is relevant , while for other nonlinearities , acoustic modes of course do not enter at all .",
    "in contrast to the optical modes ( which can be seeded if necessary ) , there is limited direct control over the type of acoustic mode that is excited due to the small acoustic propagation length . instead",
    ", the active acoustic mode is selected by the waveguide s geometry and the symmetry properties of the optical modes .",
    "while brute - force computations of coupling integrals are always an option , a refined knowledge of this interplay of the modes and the waveguide s symmetries can be of great value in disentangling the acousto - optic coupling dynamics in complex geometries .",
    "it can also indicate which symmetries ( or perhaps near symmetries , ) of a system are responsible for an unfavorably small or strong coupling . as an indication of its potential power , the symmetry analysis of sbs is analogous to the situation in raman molecular spectroscopy  @xcite , where the the symmetry properties of the molecule under study determine the presence or absence of a given resonant line for given input and output polarization .",
    "indeed , the relevant overlap integrals ( see below ) have rather similar forms .",
    "our selection rules give important physical insight into the dominant couplings in sbs - active experiments , and can be used to greatly reduce the number of mode combinations that have to be considered in gain calculations .",
    "for example , we show that for backwards sbs , which generally involves transitions between the same optical mode , no flexural or torsional acoustic modes can possibly contribute to the gain in rectangular or hexagonal structures , whereas flexural modes can contribute in triangular waveguides .",
    "knowledge of the appropriate symmetries of the acoustic modes can also simplify the design of sbs - active waveguides , because once the symmetries of the interacting modes are known , the computational domains can be restricted by imposing appropriate boundary conditions along planes of high symmetry  @xcite .",
    "this of course significantly reduces the calculation time , but more importantly it greatly simplifies the isolation of degenerate or near - degenerate modes .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sections 2 we recall some key results about opto - acoustic coupling in sbs processes . in section 3",
    ", we briefly review the relevant fundamentals of group representation theory .",
    "in section 4 , we formulate the acousto - optic interaction in a way that is convenient for a symmetry analysis , and thereby derive a necessary condition on the mode symmetries to permit non - zero sbs - gain . up to this point",
    ", the paper applies to any waveguide symmetry , including circular waveguides and more exotic cases such as five - fold symmetry . in section 5",
    ", we apply this to the aforementioned three important symmetry classes ( rectangular , triangular , hexagonal ) and provide examples for combinations of modes with non - vanishing interaction .",

    "[ fig : geometries ] ) . the sbs process can be described either in terms of field perturbations or in terms of optical forces and the mechanical displacement field .",
    "the descriptions are equivalent  @xcite ; here we choose to work with the optical forces .",
    "the coupling between optical and acoustic modes is proportional to the overlap integral @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the displacement field pattern of the relevant acoustic mode and @xmath10 is the contribution of the optical force field ( due to the two interacting optical modes ) that is phase - matched to the acoustic mode .",
    "the integration is carried out over the cross section of the waveguide .",
    "most key properties of the sbs interaction follow from knowledge of @xmath11 .",
    "for example , in long waveguides at steady state , the conventional sbs power gain parameter @xmath12 is given by @xmath13 where @xmath14 is a detuning from phase - matching , @xmath15 is the attenuation coefficient of the phonon mode , and the optical and acoustic modes have been assumed to carry one unit @xmath16 of power .",

    "the primary goal of this paper is to use symmetry arguments to provide a systematic and efficient procedure for determining whether the integral in eq .",
    "is non - vanishing or not .",

    "the final case is unique to hexagonal structures , and consists of combinations of @xmath64 together with @xmath76 modes .",
    "this type of interaction must be handled with the help of the product decomposition table ( see table  [ tab : prod_decomp ] ) . according to this table",
    ", two such modes can be combined with either a @xmath63-type non - degenerate mode or with an @xmath64-type mode in order to obtain non - zero gain . as an example , an optical fundamental mode can couple to the corresponding second order mode via an acoustic flexural mode .",
    "alternatively , an acoustic accordion - like acoustic mode can facilitate the coupling between two optical modes of the same type .",
    "a complete discussion of all the possible mode combinations would be excessive without being particularly enlighting ; a representative selection of examples that might be important is given in fig .",

    "see the caption of fig .",

    "we have formulated the selection rules for sbs for three important waveguide symmetries . if the symmetry is only weakly broken , for example by anisotropy in the mechanical properties induced by the cubic nature of some materials",
    ", we can expect these selection rules to hold to a good approximation .",
    "if the symmetry is strongly broken , these rules are readily adapted to waveguides with reduced symmetry  for example , the selection rules for rectangular waveguides on a substrate will reduce to the @xmath92 group , combinations of which will follow the character table with the @xmath93 and @xmath89 operations removed .",
    "apart from its use in the understanding and design of sbs - active waveguides , our results are very useful for the development and testing of numerical tools .",
    "firstly , they provide sets of modes that should not be able to couple for symmetry reasons .",
    "this is an excellent way to identify convergence and discretization issues in the evaluation of the coupling integrals .",
    "secondly , they eliminate complete symmetry classes of acoustic solutions for the interaction between any two given optical eigenmodes .",
    "these symmetry constraints can be exploited in numerical calculations by reducing the computational domain and imposing appropriate boundary conditions along the mirror planes , thereby greatly reducing the computational effort .",
    "this can be significant in automatized design optimazation problems or large - scale geometries .",
