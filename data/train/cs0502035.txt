    "low - density parity - check ( ldpc ) codes  @xcite,@xcite form a class of @xmath3 linear block codes , where @xmath4 is the codeword length and @xmath5 is the information length , that can approach near capacity performance . the good performance of ldpc codes is attributed to the code representation and the use of an iterative decoder .",
    "it is an essential condition that the code representation does not contain more than one parity - check equation checking on the same two or more bit positions , i.e. no cycles of length 4 .",
    "the avoidance of these short cycles is important to allow convergence of the iterative decoder  @xcite .",
    "the best performance gains to date have been obtained with long ldpc codes , i.e. several thousand bits in length .",
    "there are many applications where short ldpc codes can be potentially useful .",
    "applications such as watermarking , thin data storage , command / control data reporting and packet communications require blocks of data ranging from 32 to 512 bits to be either robustly protected or reliably transmitted .",
    "we concentrate on cyclic ldpc codes of similar lengths in this paper . the particular class of cyclic codes we consider are difference set cyclic ( dsc ) codes  @xcite and one - step majority logic decodable ( osmld ) codes  @xcite which have orthogonal parity - check equations on each bit position , thus there are no cycles of length 4 . for short block lengths",
    ", these cyclic codes have been shown to outperform the ad - hoc computer design ( random ) counterpart of the same code - rate and block length  @xcite .",
    "for an @xmath3 ldpc code , the ad - hoc computer design code has @xmath6 parity - check equations but the cyclic code has @xmath4 parity - check equations that can be used by the iterative decoder .",
    "consequently , cyclic codes exhibit better convergence than the random ldpc codes when iteratively decoded .    in this paper , we present a modified belief - propagation ( bp ) iterative decoder that can perform near maximum - likelihood ( ml ) performance for binary transmission over the additive - white - gaussian - noise ( awgn ) channel .",
    "it is also shown that , for certain cyclic codes , the modified iterative decoder can achieve ml performance .",
    "the organisation of this paper is as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : fft - cyclic ] gives a brief review on cyclic code construction method in the finite - field transform domain .",
    "section  [ sec : mrl ] introduces the idea of a more - likely codeword and its relationship to ml and iterative decoders .",
    "we present modification to the iterative decoder in section  [ sec : mod_iterative_dec ] and some simulation results of the modified decoder are presented in section  [ sec : results ] .",
    "section [ sec : conclusion ] contains the conclusions .    [ cols=\"^,<,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     @xmath7 sphere - packing - bound offset by binary transmission loss .",
    "[ fig : fer_93_47 ] , [ fig : fer_105_53 ] and [ fig : fer_341_205 ] show the fer performance of the @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath8 cyclic codes respectively .",
    "both of the @xmath1 and @xmath2 codes achieve ml performance with the modified bp decoder . for the @xmath8 code ,",
    "the modified bp decoder produces a gain of approximately @xmath9db with the respect to the standard bp decoder . due to the code length , there are very few mrl codewords observed indicating that a better decoder is required .",
    "table  [ tbl : improvement ] summarises , at the fer of @xmath10 , the amount of gain obtained with the modified decoder with the respect to the standard bp decoder and the distance from the sphere packing bound after allowing binary transmission loss .",
    "construction of cyclic ldpc codes using idempotents and ms polynomials can produce a large number of cyclic codes that are free from cycle of length 4 .",
    "some of the codes are already known such as the dsc codes , but others are new .",
    "an important feature of this approach is the ability to increase the @xmath11 of the codes by taking into account additional irreducible factors of @xmath12 and so steadily decrease the sparseness of the parity - check matrix . as an example , consider that we want to design a cyclic code of length @xmath13 .",
    "if we let @xmath14 , we obtain a @xmath15 cyclic code with @xmath11 of 7 .",
    "now , if the irreducible polynomial @xmath16 is also taken into account , the resulting cyclic code is the @xmath0 code which has @xmath11 of 9 .",
    "the row or column weight of the parity - check matrices for the former and latter codes are @xmath17 and @xmath18 respectively .    by substituting the parity - check equations in the parity - check matrix with other codewords of the dual code derived from their linear combinations ,",
    "the performance of the bp decoder can be improved . for the @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 cyclic codes ,",
    "the modified bp decoder has been shown to achieve ml performance .",
    "although the substitution method introduces cycles of length 4 , these cycles do not pose a lasting negative effect on the iterative decoder . by substituting at every iteration ,",
    "the effect of these short cycles is broken and simulation results have shown that this can improve the decoding performance .",
