    "commutation relations of ( generalized ) pauli operators provide a skeleton for mutually unbiased bases , quantum entanglement and other conceptual ( or practical ) issues like quantum computing @xcite .",
    "recently , an extensive study of commuting / non commuting rules has been undertaken , firstly in prime power dimensions @xmath11 of the hilbert space @xcite-@xcite , then in the smallest composite dimension @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "commutation relations of two - qubit operators , and dually the incidence relations between maximal commuting sets of them , have been shown to fit the ( symplectic ) generalized quadrangle of order two , and several projective embeddings have been proposed @xcite . for higher - order pauli operators , the duality between the observables and their maximal commuting sets does not occur and the geometrical space of points / observables may exhibit several lines / sets passing through @xmath13-tuples of distinguished points @xcite .    in this communication , one makes use of the maximal ideals of some ring @xmath14 ( possibly different from the modular ring @xmath3 ) as the gears of commutation relations . in particular , the incidence between the twelve lines of the sextit system fits the grid like structure of the projective line @xmath15 over the modular ring @xmath16 . in the higher composite dimensions explored so far @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 ,",
    "the incidence of the maximal commuting sets is found to reproduce the projective line @xmath21 over rings @xmath22 ,",
    "@xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 , respectively .",
    "the unexpected irruption of the galois field of four elements @xmath26 , within the projective model of the two - qubit / qutrit system , seems to forbid an easy generalization to an arbitrary dimension @xmath1 .",
    "there are indeed many ways of defining the quantum states ( let us call them qudits `` ) in a finite @xmath1-dimensional hilbert space .",
    "one representation makes use of the unitary shift '' and clock \"",
    "operators @xmath27 and @xmath28 , with the actions @xmath29 , @xmath30 on the vectors @xmath31 of the hilbert space .",
    "henceforth @xmath32 is a fixed @xmath1-th root of the unity . under matrix multiplication",
    ", @xmath27 and @xmath28 generates the ( non - commutative ) pauli group @xmath33 from the basic relation @xmath34 . as a result",
    ", elements of @xmath33 can be taken as @xmath35 , with @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 in the ring @xmath3 @xcite-@xcite .",
    "another representation of the pauli group is from tensor products of shift and clock actions in prime dimension @xcite .",
    "the latter definition is favored in the theory of mutually unbiased bases @xcite and was used in our previous papers devoted to commutation relations @xcite-@xcite .",
    "a condensation from the @xmath39 elements of the pauli group to @xmath0 pauli operators may also be achieved by taking the quotient of @xmath33 by its center @xmath40 ( the set of all operators which commute with every other one )    ref @xcite describes the commutation relations between operators in @xmath33 , and thus in @xmath41 , using vectors @xmath42 , their attached cyclic submodule @xmath43 and the points `` of the projective line @xmath44 an admissible vector @xmath45 is such that there exists another vector @xmath46 for which the matrix @xmath47 is invertible , which for a commutative ring is equivalent to have a determinant equal to a unit of the ring .",
    "the equivalence class of @xmath45 is a free cyclic submodule @xmath48 , of order @xmath1 , and also a point '' of the projective line @xmath49 .",
    "one reminds the geometrical structure of the projective line @xmath49 @xcite .",
    "two distinct points @xmath48 and @xmath50 are called distant if @xmath51 equals a unit of the ring @xmath3 .",
    "otherwise the two points belong to the same neighborhood .",
    "another crucial concept organizes the vectors in @xmath52 : a perpendicular set @xmath53 is defined as @xmath54 in which two vectors @xmath45 and @xmath55 are perpendicular if @xmath56 .",
    "note that two vectors within a cyclic submodule are mutually perpendicular . according to @xcite ,",
    "operators in @xmath33 which commute with a fixed operator correspond to a perpendicular set - qubit systems ( see @xcite and sec 4.1 of @xcite ) . ] . using this analogy",
    ", it seems natural to identify the elements of a free cyclic submodule , which are mutually perpendicular , with the maximal commuting sets of pauli operators , as we already did it implicitely in @xcite .",
    "a posteriori one should not be surprised that the projective line @xmath57 fits the incidence relations between the maximal commuting sets of the sextit system . to complete the geometrical picture of commutation relations , one needs to identify the ( not necessarily admissible ) vectors of @xmath2 with the @xmath0 pauli operators .",
    "let us summarize main results of @xcite :    theorem 1 asserts that a free cyclic module @xmath50 containing a vector @xmath45 is contained in the perpendicular set @xmath53 .",
    "only if @xmath45 is admissible the corresponding module equals @xmath53 .",
    "it reinforces our interpretation that the maximal sets of mutually commuting operators [ corresponding to @xmath48 ] also define a base of operators [ corresponding to @xmath53 ] .",
    "one immediate consequence concerns the application to mutually unbiased bases .",
    "any two vectors in one base should be perpendicular , while any two vectors from distinct mutually unbiased bases should not . using two non - zero ( and admissible ) distinct vectors @xmath45 and @xmath60 , the two vector sets @xmath61 and @xmath62 are disjoint only if @xmath63 , i.e. if @xmath64 and @xmath45 , @xmath60 are not perpendicular .",
    "this can not happen maximally since @xmath3 is a ring so that @xmath65 or @xmath66 may be zero divisors .",
    "the maximal number of mutually unbiased bases in composite dimension may thus be reformulated as being the maximal number of such disjoint vector sets in the relevant ring .",
    "if the dimension @xmath1 is the power of distinct primes @xmath67 , theorem 2 in @xcite provides quantitative results about ( a ) the number of points @xmath68 in which any vector @xmath45 lies , ( b ) the partitioning of @xmath53 as the corresponding set theoretic union of points @xmath48 and ( c ) the cardinality of @xmath53 .",
    "one gets    @xmath69    in which @xmath70 is a subset of the indices related to the decomposition of the entries of @xmath45 into their principal ideals .",
    "the sextit system ( @xmath71 ) was investigated in our recent paper @xcite . in this dimension ,",
    "the ( generalized ) pauli operators are defined as @xmath72 the orthonormal set of the qubits comprises the standard pauli matrices @xmath73 , where @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 , while the orthonormal set of the qutrits is taken as + @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is the @xmath80 unit matrix , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "the sextit operators can be conveniently labelled as follows : @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 ,  , @xmath92 , @xmath93 ,  ,",
    "@xmath95 , in which we singled out the three reference points @xmath96 , @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "then one can use the strategy already described in @xcite for @xmath99-qudit systems .",
    "the pauli operators are identified with the vertices of a ( pauli ) graph and the commuting operators are identified with the edges .",
    "the maximal cliques of the graph correspond to the maximal sets of mutually commuting operators . for the sextit system one",
    "gets the twelve sets @xmath100    as emphasized in @xcite , the incidence between the maximal commuting sets leads to a @xmath101 grid - like structure isomorphic to the projective line over the ring @xmath102 .",
    "a subset of the commutation structure of the operators is illustrated in fig  [ multi ] .",
    "let us illustrate the relationship between the pauli graph of sextits and the fine structure of the projective line @xmath15 .",
    "operators @xmath103 belonging to the maximal sets are of three distinct types includes the operator @xmath103 itself and the unity operator @xcite . but for maximal commuting sets one usually ignores the unity operator which commutes with every other operator @xcite ] ( see also fig  [ multi ] )    \\(i ) @xmath103 is one of the reference points @xmath96 , @xmath97 or @xmath98 , lies in four sets and the number of points commuting with @xmath103 is @xmath104 ,    \\(ii ) @xmath105 lies in three sets and @xmath106 ,    \\(iii ) otherwise @xmath103 lies in a single set and @xmath107 .",
    "these results clearly fits ( [ quant ] ) with @xmath12 , @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",
    "analogous results are indeed obtained for square free dimensions @xmath110 and @xmath18 , so far explored .",
    "the qudit system in dimension @xmath111 contains the even square @xmath112 . in this dimension ,",
    "the ( generalized ) pauli operators are defined as @xmath113 one proceeds as for the sextit system , one determines the pauli graph of the @xmath114-dit and one extracts the maximal cliques .",
    "the incidence between the corresponding maximal commuting sets is found to reproduce the projective line over the ring @xmath115 , of order @xmath116 with @xmath117 and @xmath118 .",
    "operators @xmath103 belonging to the maximal sets still are found to be of three distinct types    \\(i ) @xmath103 is one of the reference points ( it includes @xmath79 in its tensor product ) , then one finds that @xmath103 lies in @xmath119 sets and @xmath120 .",
    "\\(ii ) @xmath103 includes @xmath121 in its tensor product , lies in @xmath122 sets and @xmath123 ,    \\(iii ) otherwise @xmath103 lies in @xmath124 sets and @xmath125 .",
    "the commutation relations within a perpendicular set @xmath126 of type ( i ) are illustrated in fig  [ para ] .",
    "it comprises three bundles of four lines each , organized in a parachute like structure .",
    "the lines of a specific bundle intersect at three distinguished points , each one of type ( i ) .",
    "the qudit system in dimension @xmath127 contains the odd square @xmath128 . in this dimension ,",
    "the ( generalized ) pauli operators are defined as @xmath129 again one determines the pauli graph of the @xmath5-dit and one computes the maximal cliques . the incidence between the corresponding maximal commuting sets is found to reproduce the projective line @xmath21 over the ring @xmath130 , of order @xmath131 with @xmath108 and @xmath118 .",
    "operators @xmath103 belonging to the maximal sets are found to be of five distinct types    \\(i ) @xmath103 is one of the three reference points containing @xmath132 in the tensor decomposition , it lies in @xmath133 sets and @xmath134 ,    \\(ii ) @xmath103 lies in @xmath119 sets and @xmath135 ,    \\(iii ) @xmath103 lies in @xmath136 sets and @xmath137 ,    \\(iv ) @xmath103 lies in @xmath124 sets and @xmath138 ,    \\(v ) otherwise @xmath103 lies in a single set and @xmath137 .    the perpendicular set attached to a point of type ( i )",
    "is illustrated in fig  [ paranew ] .",
    "the fine structure of the bundles increases in complexity compared to fig  [ para ] , each one comprising four lines intersecting at five points , one of type ( i ) , two of type ( ii ) and the remaining two of type ( iii ) .",
    "it has been found that commuting operators associated to composite qudits in dimension @xmath1 correspond to perpendicular vectors within the symplectic module @xmath2 .",
    "moreover the maximal commuting sets reflect the set - theoretic structure of free cyclic submodules defined over some commutative ring @xmath14 , possibly distinct from the modular ring @xmath3 as soon as @xmath1 contains squares in the prime number decomposition .",
    "an admissible vector , which defines such a submodule , is of two types @xcite ( a ) either one ( at least ) of its entries is a unit of the ring @xmath14 , or ( b ) both of its entries are zero divisors , not in the same maximal ideal of @xmath14 . thus the maximal ideals underlie the projective line @xcite and the commutation structure of qudit operators .    in fig  [ ideals ] we give a sketch of the interaction between maximal ideals of the rings @xmath139 ( corresponding to the qubit / qutrit system ) , @xmath140 ( corresponding to the qubit / two - qutrit system ) and @xmath141 corresponding to the two - qubit / qutrit system ) .",
    "to some extent one can identify the factors of the qudit system with the maximal ideals , and the peculiar set theoretic union / intersection of them governs the whole commutation structure .",
    "the ideals themselves have a ring structure .",
    "for example the three ideals in ( c ) are subsets isomorphic to @xmath139 , @xmath142 and @xmath143 respectively .",
    "the corresponding projective lines are @xmath144 , @xmath145 and @xmath146 grids .",
    "the last grid exhibits a maximum number of four distant points , corresponding to the maximum number of mutually unbiased bases in dimension twelve .",
    "further work should clarify whether a ring @xmath14 is attached to any composite qubit .",
    "this could have application not only to mutually unbiased bases , but to quantum chemistry @xcite , quantum channels @xcite , the non abelian hidden subgroup problem @xcite and other quantum information processing problems , as well .",
