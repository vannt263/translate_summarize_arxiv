    "in the tradition of `` toy models '' for quantum mechanics ( qm ) , schumacher and westmoreland @xcite and hanson et al .",
    "@xcite have recently investigated models of quantum mechanics over finite fields . one finite field stands out over the rest , @xmath0 , since vectors in a vector space over @xmath0 have a natural interpretation , namely as _ sets _ that are subsets of a universe set .",
    "but in any vector space over a finite field , there is no inner product so the first problem in constructing a toy model of qm in this context is the definition of dirac s brackets .",
    "which aspects of the usual treatment of the brackets should be retained and which aspects should be dropped ?",
    "schumacher and westmoreland ( s&w ) chose to have their brackets continue to have values in the base field , e.g. , @xmath1 , so their `` theory does not make use of the idea of probability.''@xcite instead , the values of @xmath2 and @xmath3 are respectively interpreted modally as _ _  impossible _ _ and _ possible _ and hence their name of `` modal quantum theory . '' a number of results from full qm carry over to their modal quantum theory , e.g. , no - cloning , superdense coding , and teleportation , but without a probability calculus , other results such as bell s theorem do not carry over : `` in the absence of probabilities and expectation values the bell approach will not work . ''",
    "@xcite hence they develop a variation using the modal concepts from a toy model by hardy .",
    "@xcite    but all these limitations can be overcome by the different treatment of the brackets taken here which yields a full probability calculus for a model of _ quantum mechanics over sets _ ( qm / sets ) using the @xmath0 base field .",
    "binary coding theory also uses vector spaces over @xmath0 , and one of the principal functions , the hamming distance function @xcite , takes non - negative integer values .",
    "applied to two subsets @xmath4 of a given universe set @xmath5 , the hamming distance function is the cardinality @xmath6 of their symmetric difference ( i.e. , the number of places where the two binary strings differ ) . in full qm , the bracket @xmath7 is taken as the size of the `` overlap '' between the two states .",
    "hence it is natural in qm / sets to define the bracket @xmath8 applied to subsets @xmath9 as the size of their overlap , i.e. , the cardinality @xmath10 of their intersection .    the usual qm formalism ( always finite dimensional ) , e.g.",
    ", the norm as the square root of the brackets @xmath11 , can be developed in this context , and then born s rule yields a probability calculus . and it is essentially a familiar calculus , logical probability theory for a finite universe set of outcomes developed by laplace , boole , and others . the only difference from that classical calculus is the vector space formulation which allows different ( equicardinal ) bases or universe sets of outcomes and thus it is `` non - commutative . ''",
    "this allows the development of the qm / sets version of many qm results such as bell s theorem , the indeterminacy principle , double - slit experiments , and much else in the context of finite sets . and",
    "that , in turn , helps to illuminate some of the seemingly `` weird '' aspects of full qm .    by developing a sets - version of qm , the concepts and relationships of full qm are represented in a pared - down ultra - simple version that can be seen as representing the essential `` logic '' of qm .",
    "it represents the `` logic of qm '' in that old sense of `` logic '' as giving the basic essentials of a theory ( even reduced to `` zero - oneness '' ) , not in the sense of giving the behavior of propositions in a theory ( which is the usual `` quantum logic '' ) .",
    "this approach to full qm @xcite arises out of the recent development of the logic of partitions ( @xcite and @xcite ) that is ( category - theoretically ) dual to the ordinary boolean logic of subsets ( which is usually mis - specified as the special case of propositional logic ) .",
    "there is a natural bridge ( or ladder ) between qm / sets and full qm based on the mathematical relation between sets and vector spaces that is part of the mathematical folklore .",
    "a subset can be viewed as a vector in a vector space over @xmath0 , and a vector expressed in a basis can be viewed as a linearized set where each ( basis- ) element in the set has a coefficient in the base field of scalars . using this conceptual bridge ( or ladder ) , set - based concepts as in qm / sets can be transported or `` lifted '' to vector space concepts as in qm , and vector space concepts may be `` delifted '' or transported back to set concepts .",
    "qm / sets is the delifted version of the mathematical machinery of qm , and , conversely , the machinery of qm / sets lifts to give the mathematics of qm ( but , of course , not the specifically physical assumptions such as the hamiltonian or the debroglie relations connecting energy and frequency or momentum and wavelength ) .",
    "the bridge from set concepts to vector space concepts has the guiding :    * basis principle : *    _ apply the set concept to a basis set and then linearly generate the lifted vector space concept . to the ( free ) vector space @xmath12 where @xmath13 lifts to the basis vector @xmath14 .",
    "but some choices are involved in the lifting program .",
    "for instance , the set attribute @xmath15 could be taken as defining the linear functional @xmath16 that takes @xmath17 to @xmath18 or the linear operator @xmath19 that takes @xmath17 to @xmath20 .",
    "we will see that the latter is the right choice . ] _    for instance",
    ", what is the vector space lift of the set concept of cardinality ?",
    "we apply the set concept of cardinality to a basis set of a vector space where it yields the notion of _ dimension _ of the vector space ( after checking that all bases have equal cardinality ) .",
    "thus the lift of set - cardinality is not the cardinality of a vector space but its dimension .",
    "thus the null set @xmath21 with cardinality @xmath2 lifts to the trivial zero vector space with dimension @xmath2 .",
    "given a universe set @xmath5 , a _ partition _",
    "@xmath22 of @xmath5 is a set of non - empty subsets or blocks ( or cells ) @xmath23 of @xmath5 that are pairwise disjoint and whose union is @xmath5 . in category - theoretic terms , a partition is a direct sum decomposition of a set , and that concept will lift , in the sets - to - vector - spaces lifting program , to the concept of a direct sum decomposition of a vector space .",
    "we obtain this lifting by applying the basis principle .",
    "apply a set partition to a basis set of a vector space .",
    "each block @xmath24 of the set partition of the basis set linearly generates a subspace @xmath25 , and the subspaces together form a _ direct sum decomposition _ : @xmath26 .",
    "thus the proper lifted notion of a partition for a vector space is _ not _ a set partition of a space compatible with the vector space structure as would be defined by a subspace @xmath27 where @xmath28 if @xmath29 .",
    "a _ vector space partition _ is a direct sum decomposition of the vector space  which is not at all a set partition of the vector space .",
    "the main partition operation from partition logic that we need to lift to vector spaces is the join operation .",
    "two set partitions can not be joined unless they are _ compatible _ in the sense of being defined on the same universe set .",
    "this notion of compatibility lifts to vector spaces , via the basis principle , by defining two vector space partitions ( i.e. , two direct sum decompositions ) @xmath30 and @xmath31 on @xmath32 as being _",
    "compatible _ if there is a basis set for @xmath32 so that the two vector space partitions arise from two set partitions of that common or simultaneous basis set .",
    "if two set partitions @xmath33 and @xmath34 are compatible , then their _ join _ @xmath35 is defined as the set partition whose blocks are the non - empty intersections @xmath36 .",
    "similarly the lifted concept is that if two vector space partitions @xmath30 and @xmath31 are compatible , then their _ join _ @xmath37 is defined as the vector space partition whose subspaces are the non - zero intersections @xmath38 . and by the definition of compatibility , we could generate the subspaces of the join @xmath37 by the blocks in the join of the two set partitions of the common basis set .",
    "a set partition might be seen as an abstract rendition of the inverse image partition @xmath39 defined by some concrete numerical attribute @xmath15 on @xmath5 .",
    "what is the lift of an attribute ? at first glance , the basis principle would seem to imply : define a set numerical attribute on a basis set ( with values in the base field ) and then linearly generate a functional from the vector space to the base field .",
    "but a functional does not define a vector space partition ; it only defines the set partition of the vector space compatible with the vector space operations that is determined by the kernel of the functional .",
    "hence we need to try a more careful application of the basis principle .",
    "it is helpful to first give a suggestive reformulation of a set attribute @xmath15 .",
    "if @xmath40 is constant on a subset @xmath41 with a value @xmath42 , then we might symbolize this as :    @xmath43    and suggestively call @xmath44 an `` eigenvector '' and @xmath42 an `` eigenvalue . ''",
    "the multiplication @xmath45 is only formal and should be read as : the function @xmath40 has the value @xmath42 on the subset @xmath44 . for any `` eigenvalue '' @xmath42 , define power set @xmath46 = `` eigenspace of @xmath42 '' as the set of all the `` eigenvectors '' with that `` eigenvalue . ''",
    "since the `` eigenspaces '' span the set @xmath5 , the attribute @xmath15 can be represented by :    @xmath47    `` spectral decomposition '' of set attribute @xmath15    where @xmath48 is the characteristic function for the set @xmath49 and where the index @xmath42 runs over the image or `` spectrum '' of the function @xmath15 ] . , or as a vector space over @xmath0 concept ( which already starts to combine set and vector space concepts ) .",
    "for instance , the pure set concept of the partition given by an attribute @xmath15 is the set partition @xmath51 and the `` direct sum '' is the set disjoint union @xmath52 . but this can be recast in @xmath53 as the vector space direct sum : @xmath54 of the vector space partition @xmath55 . ]",
    "thus a set attribute determines a set partition and has a constant value on the blocks of the set partition , so by the basis principle , that lifts to a vector space concept that determines a vector space partition and has a constant value on the blocks of the vector space partition .",
    "the suggestive terminology gives the lift .",
    "the lift of @xmath56 is the eigenvector equation @xmath57 where @xmath58 is a linear operator on @xmath32 .",
    "the lift of @xmath42 is the eigenvalue @xmath59 and the lift of an @xmath44 such that @xmath43 is an eigenvector @xmath60 such that @xmath57 .",
    "the lift of an `` eigenspace '' @xmath46 is the eigenspace @xmath61 of an eigenvalue @xmath59 .",
    "the lift of the simplest attributes , which are the characteristic functions @xmath48 , are the projection operators @xmath62 that project to the eigenspaces @xmath61 .",
    "the characteristic property of the characteristic functions @xmath63 is that they are idempotent in the sense that @xmath64 for all @xmath13 , and the lifted characteristic property of the projection operators @xmath65 is that they are idempotent in the sense that @xmath66 .",
    "finally , the `` spectral decomposition '' of a set attribute lifts to the spectral decomposition of a _ vector space attribute _ :",
    "@xmath47 lifts to @xmath67    lift of a set attribute to a vector space attribute    thus a vector space attribute is just a linear operator whose eigenspaces span the whole space which is called a _",
    "diagonalizable _ _ linear operator _ @xcite .",
    "then we see that the proper lift of a set attribute using the basis principle does indeed define a vector space partition , namely that of the eigenspaces of a diagonalizable linear operator , and that the values of the attribute are constant on the blocks of the vector space partition  as desired . to keep the eigenvalues of the linear operator real , quantum mechanics restricts the vector space attributes to _ hermitian _ ( or _ self - adjoint _ ) linear operators , which represent _ observables _ , on a hilbert space .",
    "hermann weyl is one of the few quantum physicists who , in effect , outlined the lifting program connecting qm / sets and qm .",
    "he called a partition a `` grating '' or `` sieve , '' and then considered both set partitions and vector space partitions ( direct sum decompositions ) as the respective types of gratings.@xcite he started with a numerical attribute on a set , which defined the set partition or `` grating '' weyl : phil with blocks having the same attribute - value .",
    "then he moved to the quantum case where the set or `` aggregate of @xmath68 states has to be replaced by an @xmath68-dimensional euclidean vector space '' @xcite ( note the lift from cardinality @xmath68 sets to dimension @xmath68 vector spaces ) .",
    "the appropriate notion of a vector space partition or `` grating '' is a `` splitting of the total vector space into mutually orthogonal subspaces '' so that `` each vector @xmath69 splits into @xmath42 component vectors lying in the several subspaces '' @xcite , i.e. , a vector space partition ( direct sum decomposition of the space ) .",
    "fig1-liftattributetable.eps + figure 1 : set numerical attributes lift to linear operators      since two set attributes @xmath15 and @xmath70 define two inverse image partitions @xmath71 and @xmath72 on their domains , we need to extend the concept of compatible partitions to the attributes that define the partitions .",
    "that is , two attributes @xmath15 and @xmath70 are _ compatible _ if they have the same domain @xmath73 .",
    "we have previously lifted the notion of compatible set partitions to compatible vector space partitions .",
    "since real - valued set attributes lift to hermitian linear operators , the notion of compatible set attributes just defined would lift to two linear operators being _ compatible _ if their eigenspace partitions are compatible .",
    "it is a standard fact of qm math ( e.g. , @xcite or @xcite ) that two ( hermitian ) linear operators @xmath74 are compatible if and only if they commute , @xmath75 . hence the _ commutativity _ of linear operators is the lift of the compatibility ( i.e. , defined on the same set ) of set attributes .",
    "thus the join of two eigenspace partitions is defined iff the operators commute .",
    "weyl also pointed this out : `` thus combination [ join ] of two gratings [ vector space partitions ] presupposes commutability ... '' .",
    "@xcite    given two compatible set attributes @xmath15 and @xmath76 , the join of their `` eigenspace '' partitions has as blocks the non - empty intersections @xmath77 .",
    "each block in the join of the `` eigenspace '' partitions could be characterized by the ordered pair of `` eigenvalues '' @xmath78 .",
    "an `` eigenvector '' of @xmath40 , @xmath79 , and of @xmath80 , @xmath81 , would be a `` simultaneous eigenvector '' : @xmath82 .    in the lifted case , two commuting hermitian linear operator @xmath58 and @xmath83 have compatible eigenspace partitions @xmath84",
    "( for the eigenvalues @xmath59 of @xmath58 ) and @xmath85 ( for the eigenvalues @xmath86 of @xmath83 ) .",
    "the blocks in the join @xmath87 of the two compatible eigenspace partitions are the non - zero subspaces @xmath88 which can be characterized by the ordered pairs of eigenvalues @xmath89 .",
    "the nonzero vectors @xmath90 are _ simultaneous eigenvectors _ for the two commuting operators , and there is a basis for the space consisting of simultaneous eigenvectors . due to the problem of degeneracy . ]",
    "a set of compatible set attributes is said to be _ complete _ if the join of their partitions is the discrete partition ( the blocks have cardinality @xmath3 ) .",
    "each element of @xmath5 is then characterized by the ordered @xmath91-tuple @xmath92 of attribute values .    in the lifted case ,",
    "a set of commuting linear operators is said to be _ complete _ if the join of their eigenspace partitions is nondegenerate , i.e. , the blocks have dimension @xmath3 .",
    "the eigenvectors that generate those one - dimensional blocks of the join are characterized by the ordered @xmath68-tuples @xmath93 of eigenvalues so the eigenvectors are usually denoted as the eigenkets @xmath94 in the dirac notation .",
    "these _ complete sets of commuting operators _ are dirac s cscos @xcite .",
    "the lifting program or bridge developed so far is summarized in the following table .",
    "fig2-liftingtable.eps + figure 2 : summary of lifting program",
    "the set version of qm is said to be `` over @xmath0 '' since the power set @xmath95 ( for a finite non - empty universe set @xmath5 ) is a vector space over @xmath1 where the subset addition @xmath96 is the _ symmetric difference _ ( or inequivalence ) of subsets , i.e. , @xmath97 for @xmath98 . given a finite universe set @xmath99 of cardinality @xmath68 ,",

    "as expected , the algorithm is so simple that the key role of superposition is obvious , and that superposition gives the quantum speedup of a single function evaluation in contrast with the @xmath639 evaluations needed classically . as opposed to classical computing using @xmath0 , since qc/@xmath441 is also restricted to @xmath0 . ]    finally , quantum mechanics over sets or qm / sets is part of a research program that arose out of the recent development of the logic of partitions ( @xcite and @xcite ) , the logic that is mathematically dual to the ordinary boolean logic of subsets ( usually mis - specified as the special case of `` propositional '' logic ) .",
    "this research program ultimately aims to interpret quantum mechanics using the notion of objective indefiniteness @xcite .",
    "quantum mechanics over sets is a key part of that program since the fundamental qm notions such as eigenstates , superpositions of eigenstates , and measurement in vector spaces are distilled down into the `` definite '' ( i.e. , singleton ) subsets , the `` indefinite '' ( i.e. , multiple element ) subsets that `` superpose '' ( i.e. , collect together ) a number of definite elements , and the join - action of a set partition ( inverse - image of a numerical attribute ) on a `` pure '' indefinite subset to create a `` mixed state '' of more definite subsets ."

    "<S> qm / sets_. this approach leads to a different treatment of dirac s brackets than in `` modal quantum theory '' ( mqt ) , and that gives a full probability calculus ( unlike mqt that only has zero - one modalities of impossible and possible ) . that , in turn , leads to a rather fulsome theory of qm over sets that includes `` logical '' models of the double - slit experiment , bell s theorem , quantum information theory , quantum computing , and much else . </S>",

    "<S> qm / sets is also a key part of a broader research program to provide an interpretation of qm based on the notion of `` objective indefiniteness , '' a program that grew out the recent development of the logic of partitions mathematically dual to the usual boolean logic of subsets . </S>"
