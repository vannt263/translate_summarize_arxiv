    "in  @xcite , savage showed that a set of postulates concerning rational decisions in the face of uncertainty implies that the decider acts as if he / she were maximizing the expectation of some utility function .",
    "his postulates imply that a decider gives subjective probabilities , that obey the laws of the calculus of probabilities , to each event .",
    "the impact of his results have been felt very strongly and have strengthened the idea that rationality is maximization of expected utility and that subjective probabilities obey the laws of the calculus of probabilities . a number of researchers , though , have contested each of those two points : a. wald , prior to savage , has defended a _ maximin _",
    "strategy irreconcilable with maximization of expected utility , and the dempster - shafer approach , among many others , rejects the idea that subjective probabilities are probabilities . in this paper ,",
    "an approach closely following savage s is pursued .",
    "some of his assumptions are weakened and an exact characterization of subjective probabilities is obtained .",
    "three main criticisms may be raised against three of savage s postulates .    * in p1 ,",
    "savage  @xcite requires preference to be a _ simple order _",
    "( which is a misnomer since , contrary to expectations , it does not imply it is an order relation ) .",
    "he recognizes that this a very strong assumption and writes `` there is some temptation to explore the possibilities of analyzing preference among acts as a _ partial ordering _ , that is , in effect to replace part 1 of the definition of simple ordering by the very weak proposition , admitting that some pairs of acts are incomparable .",
    "this would seem to give expression to introspective sensations of indecision or vacillation , which we may be reluctant to identify with indifference .",
    "my own conjecture is that it would prove a blind alley losing much in power and advancing little , if at all , in realism ; but only an enthusiastic exploration could shed real light on the question . ''",
    "this work is a first step in this possibly blind alley .",
    "further work is needed on the utility theory for generalized qualitative probability structures .",
    "+ this assumption implies that , if a decider is undecided between two acts @xmath0 and @xmath1 , and also undecided between @xmath1 and @xmath2 , then he / she is undecided between @xmath0 and @xmath2 . in many realistic situations ,",
    "in which the decider has only partial information , this property can not be expected to hold .",
    "consider , for example , a choice between betting _ heads _ in one of three different coin tosses .",
    "coin 1 is believed to be fair .",
    "coins 2 and 3 are unknown , i.e. , not believed to be fair , but coin 2 is known to land _ heads _ more often than coin 3 .",
    "in such a situation a decider may well be undecided between coins 1 and 2 and also between coins 1 and 3 , but definitely prefer coin 2 to coin 3 .",
    "a criticism of the same nature may be found in  @xcite , although framed in the von neumann - morgenstern setting  @xcite .",
    "+ there are two different reasons one may object to this _",
    "completeness assumption_. the first one , behind  @xcite , is that one may doubt that consequences may be totally pre - ordered , mainly because consequences may be multi - dimensional ( e.g. , time and money , human lives and money , or just a very high dimensional space ) and one may be either reluctant to trade one dimension for the other or just incapable of describing a total pre - order in a very rich space .",
    "such a concern is at the basis of a large body of work on decision in a many - criteria environment .",
    "+ the second reason is that one may doubt that subjective probabilities may be exactly described ( i.e. , events totally pre - ordered ) , because of one s uncertainty about what is unknown , or because one may be reluctant to compare subjective probabilities of events pertaining to very different realms , e.g. , the probability of a republican president being elected in 1996 ( savage s example ) and that of a coin landing `` heads '' .",
    "such a concern is at the basis of a large body of work on decision in uncertain environments .",
    "+ the results of this paper do not depend on the source of incompleteness .",
    "it has been elaborated with the second point of view in mind , though . *",
    "savage s treatment of null events is disputable since it does not allow for events that are null relatively to other null events . as any treatment based on probabilities , or reducible to them",
    ", it allows conditioning on an event @xmath3 only if the probability of @xmath3 is positive .",
    "this point is made in  @xcite where _ non - archimedean _ probability structures are proposed , in the framework of a _ total _ pre - order . there , reference is made to  @xcite and de finetti  @xcite is quoted as saying : `` there seems to be no justification @xmath4 for introducing the restriction '' . *",
    "it follows from savage s postulate p4 that if a consequence @xmath5 is strictly preferred to a consequence @xmath6 , and if the act of winning @xmath5 in case of an event @xmath7 and winning @xmath6 otherwise is strictly preferred to winning @xmath5 in case of an event @xmath8 and winning @xmath6 otherwise , then the act of winning @xmath9 in case of @xmath7 and winning @xmath10 otherwise is strictly preferred to winning @xmath9 in case of @xmath8 and winning @xmath10 otherwise , for any consequences @xmath9 , @xmath10 such that @xmath9 is stricly preferred to @xmath10 .",
    "this seems too strong .",
    "one may , rationally , strictly prefer winning $ 1 m on @xmath7 and winning $ 0 otherwise to winning $ 1 m on @xmath8 and winning $ 0 otherwise , be undecided between winning 1c on @xmath7 and $ 0 otherwise or winning 1c on @xmath8 and $ 0 otherwise , and still prefer a sure win of 1c to nothing .",
    "the treatment of subjective probabilities in  @xcite , similarly , includes no anologue to p4 .",
    "note savage s pessimistic outlook in  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* , section 2 ) : `` though i have not explored the latter possibility carefully , i suspect that any attempt to do so formally leads to fruitless and endless regression '' .",
    "this work presents postulates , in the style of savage , that are weak enough to answer all three criticisms above .",
    "nevertheless , those postulates enable a full characterization of the structure of _ subjective probabilities_.",
    "notations follow those of  @xcite .",
    "@xmath11 is a non - empty set of states .",
    "subsets of @xmath11 are noted @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath12 , @xmath4 and called events .",
    "we follow savage in assuming that every subset of @xmath11 is an event , i.e. , measurable .",
    "the treatment of the general case , in which the measurable subsets of @xmath11 form only a sub - algebra of the power set of @xmath11 poses no serious problems .",
    "@xmath13 is a set of consequences , denoted @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath4 .",
    "acts are arbitrary functions from @xmath11 to @xmath13 , denoted by @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath4 .",
    "a basic problem with savage s treatment is the elimination of the event of reference , i.e. , the event on which the decider conditions , from the formalization . the preference relation shall here be indexed by an arbitrary event . for every event @xmath7 : means that , given @xmath7 , _ either @xmath1 is strictly preferred to @xmath0 or one is indifferent between @xmath0 and @xmath1_. the reason for this richer formalism is _ not _ a rejection of the sure thing principle , which is accepted and derived , but the rejection of savage s idea that comparing two acts that agree on @xmath14 is enough to compare them given @xmath7 .",
    "if @xmath7 is negligible with respect to @xmath14 , acts may be equivalent ( on the whole set @xmath11 ) but not given @xmath7 .",
    "notice also that the intuitive meaning of @xmath15 is _ preference or indifference _ , as in  @xcite , and _ not _ non - preference as in  @xcite . in this way",
    ", any two acts may stand in four possible situations :    * and , i.e. , @xmath1 is strictly prefered to @xmath0 , given @xmath7 , which will be denoted , * and , i.e. , @xmath0 is strictly prefered to @xmath1 , given @xmath7 , which will be denoted , * and , i.e. , @xmath0 and @xmath1 are indifferent , given @xmath7 , which will be denoted , or * and , i.e. , one is undecided between @xmath0 and @xmath1 , given @xmath7 .",
    "we propose , in this work , two weakenings of savage s postulates : a partial pre - order in place of a total pre - order , and the consideration of events that are negligible with respect to other events ( that may be negligible with respect to a third class of events ) .",
    "those two weakenings are essentially orthogonal , and one may study either one of them in isolation . the postulates proposed will be presented and discussed now .",
    "the first two postulates require the preference relation , on any event @xmath7 , to be a pre - order .",
    "@xmath16 @xmath17 notice that the relation @xmath18 does not satisfy the first property of the definition of a simple ordering on p.18 of  @xcite , i.e. , either or , but satisfies the second property , i.e. , transitivity . postulates ( q0 ) and ( q1 ) are therefore strictly weaker than savage s ( p1 ) .",
    "it clearly follows from ( q0 ) and ( q1 ) that , on any event @xmath7 , @xmath19 is irreflexive and transitive , i.e. , a strict partial order , and that @xmath20 is reflexive , symmetric and transitive , i.e. , an equivalence relation .",

    "the framework presented here should allow for a decider to specify only a list of pairs of acts that enter the relations @xmath19 , for different @xmath7 s and this should define a system of preferences satisfying our postulates .",

    "let us return to the analogue of theorem 5.2.1 of savage  @xcite : two acts that take the same values on events that are pairwise equivalent necessarily equivalent .",

    "the difference between @xmath56 and @xmath0 ( and @xmath57 and @xmath1 ) lies in the fact that , where @xmath0 has value @xmath6 on @xmath7 , @xmath56 has value @xmath5 there ( and where @xmath1 has value @xmath6 on @xmath7 , @xmath57 has value @xmath5 there ) . to simplify things ,",

    "in this case , improving @xmath1 on @xmath8 ( by going fromn @xmath6 to @xmath5 ) is at least as significant as improving @xmath0 on @xmath7 in the same way , and , therefore , @xmath56 can not be preferred to @xmath57 .",
