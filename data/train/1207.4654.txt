    "thermal energy is likely to lead to rotations and vibrations of the tubes in the bundle .",
    "a complex electronic behavior is expected , as rotations ( orientational changes ) and absorption and emission occur time averaged over the experiment .",
    "especially the slope flipping behavior and shifts of the bands lead to a further broadening of the width of the bands , which further broadens the density of states and therefore also the optical - absorption bands for the c@xmath1-axis chiralities .",
    "the high symmetry configuration with metallic behavior is the energetically most unstable configuration and therefore semi - metallic behavior has to be expected for bundles of metallic tubes .",
    "the @xmath140 configuration is a local total energy maximum and therefore also expected to be an unstable configuration , even so it is much lower in energy than the high symmetry configuration . for larger diameter tubes the rotation barriers flatten , allowing metallic behavior in c@xmath1-axis bundles of large diameter armchair tubes .",
    "in summary we presented van der waals energies and intertube distances of various chiralities of carbon nanotube bundles in dependence of the orientation of the tubes inside of the bundle .",
    "furthermore the electronic structure of the monochiral @xmath11-bundle was studied in dependence of the tube orientation . for tubes with a c@xmath1 axis",
    "the orientation of the tubes in the bundle becomes a new degree of freedom to adjust the bundle properties .",
    "the intertube distance as well as the binding strength vary in dependence of the tube orientation .",
    "this dependence decreases with increasing tube diameter . therefore this effect is mainly important for bundles composed of small diameter tubes with high curvature . by variation of the orientation of the tubes a pseudogap opens and increases until it vanishes at the next configuration which preserves the symmetry .",
    "c@xmath1-axis bundles of armchair tubes have metallic configurations .",
    "certain configurations show a higher density of states at the fermi level than the metallic configurations .",
    "as recent progress suggests monochiral c@xmath1-axis bundles will soon be experimentally available , which will give access to study the newly arisen bundle properties .",
