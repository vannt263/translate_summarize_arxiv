    "<S> we discuss two methods by which high porosity silica aerogels can be engineered to exhibit global anisotropy . </S>",
    "<S> first , anisotropy can be introduced with axial strain . in addition </S>",
    "<S> , intrinsic anisotropy can result during growth and drying stages and , suitably controlled , it can be correlated with preferential radial shrinkage in cylindrical samples . </S>",
    "<S> we have performed small angle x - ray scattering ( saxs ) to characterize these two types of anisotropy . </S>",
    "<S> we show that global anisotropy originating from either strain or shrinkage leads to optical birefringence and that optical cross - polarization studies are a useful characterization of the uniformity of the imposed global anisotropy . </S>"
