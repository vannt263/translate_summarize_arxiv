    "+   + note that we assume every word to have equal probability of being picked , so this is @xmath3 the same as asking  if we pick 5 random digits from 0 - 9 , what are the chances we could re - arrange them to create a palindrome ? \" . in the second phrasing of the question , ` 01156 ' is more likely than ` 00000 ' as there are more sequences of ` picks ' that will result in it .",
    "+   + the more intriguing problem arises when we generalise this , which we do in two ways . rather than the digits 0 - 9",
    ", we instead have a set of @xmath1 distinct characters , and rather than words of length 5 we will consider words of length @xmath0 . in order for the problem to make sense , we will require @xmath4 .",
    "before we start tackling this problem , we must first lay out some groundwork to formalise what we mean by this probability .",
    "+    a multiset is a set that allows repeated elements , for example \\{1 , 1 , 2}. in particular , and unlike regular sets , we have that @xmath5 .",
    "more formally , a multiset can be thought of as a set , @xmath6 , paired with a counting function @xmath7 .",
    "[ xbn ] let @xmath8 be a set of @xmath1 distinct elements , where @xmath9 .",
    "then for @xmath10 we define the _ multiset space _ of cardinality @xmath0 on @xmath8 as :    @xmath11    [ palindromic ] @xmath12 is called palindromic if :    @xmath13 @xmath14    in simple terms , this means that the elements of the set can be arranged into a word that reads the same forwards or backwards .",
    "for example , @xmath15 is palindromic ( write it as 12321 ) , whilst @xmath16 is not .",
    "[ palindomic density ] define @xmath17 as :    @xmath18     + then we define the _ palindromic density _ of @xmath19 as :    @xmath20     + in this paper we find a closed expression for @xmath21 in terms of @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "with our problem precisely formulated , we can return to our initial example where @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "it is difficult to compute the size of @xmath24 due to the differing numbers of repetitions that can occur within its elements . a way of breaking down this problem is to partition @xmath24 as follows :    @xmath25 where : @xmath26     + in our partition , the palindromic sets are @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "computing the sizes of these sets is simple - for example , @xmath31 .",
    "the first set is a slightly special case : @xmath32 .",
    "+   + thus :    @xmath33",
    "we start by finding @xmath34 , using an existing combinatorial result , with a proof adapted from @xcite .",
    "@xmath35    since @xmath1 is finite , we can define an ordering on @xmath8 and represent elements of @xmath19 as @xmath36 .",
    "+ every element of @xmath12 can then be denoted uniquely as a series of ` stars and bars ' : we can lay out @xmath0 ` stars ' to represent the elements of the ordered multiset @xmath37 , and then place @xmath38 bars among them to separate out the distinct characters .     + for example",
    ", the multiset @xmath39 would be represented as follows :    @xmath40     + for every such arrangement , it is possible to get back to an element of @xmath19 , and so our problem is reduced to finding the number of ways to arrange @xmath0 stars and @xmath38 bars in this way .",
    "note that there are @xmath41 positions in total , and we must choose @xmath38 of these for our bars .",
    "we therefore have that the number of such representations is @xmath42 , as required .",
    "[ evenproof ] if n is even , then @xmath43    we seek to construct a bijective function @xmath44 . in order for this to be well - defined",
    ", we will use the ordering of @xmath8 discussed in the previous proof to represent elements in the domain uniquely .     + now construct a doubling function @xmath45 in the following way :    @xmath46 +   + clearly @xmath47 is injective .",
    "we can also verify that all sets produced by @xmath47 are palindromic by arranging the elements as @xmath48 so @xmath44 .",
    "it remains to show that @xmath47 is surjective .",
    "+   + suppose @xmath49 .",

    "if n is odd , then    @xmath55    from the proof of [ evenproof ] , we know that every element of @xmath56 can be written as @xmath57 .",
    "it is clear from this expression that we can not change a single element of the set and preserve the palindromic property",
    ". we can therefore deduce that every element of @xmath56 differs by at least two elements .",
    "+ suppose @xmath58 .",
    "then if we add another element to it , @xmath59 , the resulting set must belong to @xmath60 .",
    "this holds because we can arrange our new set as follows , showing that it is palindromic :    @xmath61     + for every @xmath58 , it is possible to produce @xmath1 elements of @xmath62 in this way .",
    "these elements are uniquely determined by our choice of @xmath37 and @xmath63 - recall that elements of @xmath56 differ by at least two elements .",
    "hence    @xmath64     + we now show that every element of @xmath60 can be made in this way .",
    "suppose @xmath49 .",
    "then by definition [ palindromic ] :    @xmath13 @xmath65 + in particular , this means we can write @xmath51 as @xmath66 .",
    "but this is exactly what we get by adding the element @xmath67 to @xmath68 .",
    "+   + hence @xmath69 and the statement holds .     + we now combine the above three theorems to arrive at the closed form we were looking for .",

    "the result obtained in the previous section can be expanded and simplified into the following form , which has advantages when exploring convergence :    @xmath72    first , we consider the case when @xmath73 .",
    "it makes sense that if we increase @xmath1 , the probability of a set being palindromic should decrease .",
