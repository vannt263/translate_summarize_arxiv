    "the usage of internal targets in storage - ring accelerators has opened up a new era for the investigations of nucleon - nucleon collisions with high precision in hadron physics .",
    "the figure of merit for physics experiments is usually the ( integrated ) luminosity , i.e.  the target thickness times the particle beam intensity . for light targets such as hydrogen or deuterium",
    "it is quite difficult to achieve the necessary high luminosity with a conventional gas target .",
    "the alternative of using frozen micro - spheres , so - called pellets , has been suggested and a prototype pellet - generator was developed by trostell @xcite .",
    "a pellet target avoids unnecessary background gas load to the accelerator ring and allows an effective target thickness of a few times @xmath0atoms/@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "since the target tubes connected to the accelerator ring are rather narrow , detectors can be placed close to the interaction point in a nearly @xmath2sr configuration .",
    "these particular characteristics of a pellet target have caused worldwide attention , and in the near future pellet target facilities are foreseen in jlich , germany , and in lanzhou , china .",
    "furthermore , this kind of target is considered as one of the main options for the future panda experiment @xcite at fair in darmstadt , germany .",
    "until now there is only one pellet target facility permanently installed and actively operated inside a storage - ring accelerator .",
    "it is connected to the wasa ( wide angle shower apparatus ) detector at celsius at the svedberg laboratory , uppsala , sweden .",
    "this target has successfully provided hydrogen pellets for experimental data taking since 1999 , with deuterium pellets being produced as well since 2004 .",
    "the principle of operating a pellet target has been described elsewhere @xcite , and here we only briefly review those parts which are of importance for this work .",
    "compared to the earlier work , we have undertaken more systematic studies to theoretically understand and optimize the target performance .",
    "we will describe the behavior of a pellet target on the basis of a thermodynamic analysis .",
    "we will further restrict ourselves to hydrogen pellets , but the mechanism is similar for deuterium pellets .",

    "concerning the micro - spheres , the naming convention used in this paper is _ droplet _ whenever we talk about the liquid phase and _ pellet _ for the solid phase , while the word _ micro - sphere _ covers both cases as well as the intermediate one .",
    "the pellet - generation system consists of four parts :    1 .   a coldhead with heat exchangers , in which pressurized hydrogen gas is cooled and liquified , 2 .   a droplet formation chamber ( dfc ) , where a glass nozzle together with an acoustical excitation system produces and breaks - up the jet of liquid hydrogen into uniformly spaced and sized droplets , 3",
    ".   a vacuum injection system through which the droplets transform to totally frozen micro - spheres ( and hereafter are called pellets ) , and 4 .   a skimmer to collimate the pellet beam .",
    "the hydrogen is cooled by a commercially available two - stage coldhead . at stage 1",
    ", a first heat exchanger is mounted to cool the gas to about @xmath3k . at stage 2",

    "[ fig : ljn ] ) .",
    "the dfc is a stainless steel chamber with four windows allowing optical observations in both transverse directions , which enables us to control the droplet formation .",
    "the vacuum injection consists of a @xmath7 mm long capillary , connected to a differentially pumped vacuum chamber .",
    "another @xmath7 cm downstream the exit of the vacuum injection capillary , a collimating skimmer is placed to skim off the pellets with too large angular divergence .",
    "the collimated pellets will proceed an additional @xmath9 m before they reach the interaction point with the ion beam . as a last step they are captured by active charcoal inside the cryogenic beam dump .",
    "the mechanical details of this facility can be found in ref .  @xcite .",
    "the operating conditions of the pellet target have been developed steadily over the years .",
    "the inner diameter of the nozzle exit has decreased from initially roughly @xmath10 m to presently @xmath11 m , which in turn has resulted in a pellet diameter decrease from @xmath12 m to a value of about @xmath13 m .",
    "the rate of hydrogen pellets reaching the interaction point has increased from @xmath14s@xmath15 to almost @xmath16s@xmath15 .",
    "the optimal working frequency of the transducer is conditionally determined and may vary over a wide range , typically from @xmath17khz to @xmath18khz . nevertheless , for an individual experimental run the working frequency can only change within a quite narrow frequency window .",
    "it can only be determined experimentally by the observations of a `` nice '' droplet train , a good micro - sphere survival ratio through the vacuum injection capillary , and a strong concentration of pellets at the center of the skimmer . in this article , the logged data from the last hydrogen run in december 2003 were used as example .",
    "the conditions for this run were : a measured distance of @xmath19 mm between two successive droplets in the droplet formation chamber , a transducer frequency of @xmath20khz , a nozzle diameter @xmath21 m , a pressure in the droplet formation chamber of @xmath22 mbar , and a driving pressure of @xmath23 mbar for the injected hydrogen gas .    normally , either cooled hydrogen gas or helium gas at a temperature of about @xmath24k could be used as the background gas inside the dfc .",
    "to get a good pellet concentration at the skimmer one wants to have as low pressure as possible in the dfc , otherwise the angular pellet divergence from the vacuum injection becomes too large . if the absolute pressure in the droplet chamber is too low there is a risk that the liquid jet will degenerate into a spray which immediately freezes and blocks the jet .",
    "this risk has been significantly reduced by the use of helium as background gas .",
    "the higher viscosity of helium gives a more steady gas flow through the vacuum injection capillary . as a result of this it is possible to have a higher absolute pressure in the dfc and",
    "still get a good concentration at the skimmer .",
    "the lower critical temperature of helium also eliminates the risk that the gas will liquefy in the second heat exchanger .",
    "the ambient gas in the dfc is thus a mixture of two kinds of gases ; helium and the evaporated hydrogen gas .",
    "the flow of helium is regulated by the total dfc pressure .",
    "in addition , it was found that when the helium supply was shut off , the background gas which only consisted of hydrogen had an equilibrium pressure of @xmath6 mbar .",
    "thus we assume that in the gas mixture the hydrogen vapor was also occupying a partial pressure of @xmath6 mbar , and the residue @xmath25 mbar is ascribed to helium gas for a constant total pressure of @xmath26 mbar in the dfc .",
    "it has been theoretically and experimentally proven that the hydrogen droplets are fragile because of their rather low surface tension and thus are easily destroyed by the high - speed gas flow in the vacuum injection capillary while solid hydrogen - spheres would probably survive the vacuum injection better @xcite . to avoid freezing of the liquid jet itself but at the same time enable the droplets to freeze as soon as possible",
    ", the temperature of liquid hydrogen at the exit of the nozzle is precisely controlled to be a slightly higher than the normal freezing temperature , @xmath27k , namely @xmath4k , while the total pressure , thus also the partial pressure of hydrogen vapor , in the droplet formation chamber is set to a value much lower than the triple - point pressure of hydrogen ( @xmath28 mbar ) .",
    "pictures ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : droplettrain ] ) of the droplets have been taken in the experiments by a digital camera with the assistance of a stroboscopic flash diode .",
    "the measured inter - droplet distance @xmath29 was 0.368 mm which consequently resulted in a droplet diameter of @xmath30 m from eq .",
    "( [ eq : dd_djet ] ) .",
    "this is also consistent with the measured value of the ratio @xmath31 , when the droplets are just detached from the jet .",
    "the droplet velocity @xmath32 is deduced from @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the driving frequency of the transducer . for our case",
    "we find @xmath35 m/s .",
    "the observed relative velocity decrease for droplets is measured to be about @xmath36 , comparing droplets just detached from the jet to those close to the inlet of the vacuum injection capillary .    from experimental observations",
    "we know that the micro - spheres are in liquid phase at the inlet of the vacuum injection capillary and completely frozen at the skimmer .",
    "the latter conclusion comes from observing the micro - spheres that do not pass to really rebounce like billiard balls , i.e.  solid objects , as indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : skimmer ] .",
    "the first conclusion arises from tilting the droplet train to hit the capillary inlet . in this case",
    "we do not observe the `` egg shells '' as described in ref .",
    "@xcite which should have been the result if the micro - spheres been partially frozen . to conclude our observations",
    ", the micro - spheres must freeze somewhere in between the inlet of the vacuum injection capillary and the skimmer .",
    "we also see the traces of pellets bouncing around , confirming that they really are solid at this location , i.e.  @xmath7 cm downstream of the outlet of the vacuum injection capillary .",
    "the horizontal pattern comes from the monitor which the photo is taken of .",
    "this also makes the pellet concentration to look significantly bigger compared to the original frames from the ccd camera.,height=264 ]    the calculations ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : t_vs_t ] ) show that the hydrogen droplets are cooled down so fast by evaporative cooling that a solid micro - sphere ( pellet ) or at least a solid shell at the droplet surface could be formed at the exit of the droplet formation chamber ( inlet of vacuum injection capillary ) .",
    "clearly a phenomenon called supercooling is inevitably encountered , as has been mentioned before but not examined in greater detail @xcite .",
    "it is still not clear how much of the pellet beam divergence is ascribed to the supercooling , but as mentioned the pellet survival rate may be deeply affected by this phenomenon .",
    "the gas flow in the vacuum injection capillary will be  choked \" due to the large pressure difference in the dfc and the vacuum chamber .",
    "the droplet carried by the gas flow will endure a drag force given by eq .",
    "( [ eq_f_drag ] ) and as a result the droplet will be accelerated .",
    "we have experimentally measured the average pellet velocity of hydrogen from the pictures of the pellets just after the vacuum injection capillary . for this particular run ,",
    "the average over 52 distances together with the transducer frequency resulted in a pellet velocity of @xmath37 m/s .",
    "for other runs , the typical values range from @xmath17 m/s to @xmath18 m/s dependent on the pressure in the dfc and the driving pressure of hydrogen gas to the nozzle . at the moment",
    "the distribution of the pellet velocity is unknown , but we will report on these experiments in a forthcoming paper .",
    "a crucial topic originating from the vacuum injection is the pellet beam divergence which causes about 80 percent of the produced hydrogen pellets to be skimmed off because of their too large angular spread , i.e.  most of them never reach the interaction point .",
    "the origin of this type of divergence is not known in detail @xcite .",
    "pellet beam profiles measurements were carried out by step - wise moving the pellet beam over the skimmer aperture while counting the ones that pass .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : beamprof_h2 ] . _ a priori _ the shape of the uncollimated beam , i.e.  before the skimmer , is unknown .",
    "however , by fitting several test - functions to the experimental results a gaussian shape reproduces the measured values the best .",
    "since the size of the pellet beam is similar to the skimmer diameter , the convolution between the two becomes important .",
    "we assumed the uncollimated beam to be a symmetric gaussian , and by fitting its convoluted result to the experimental measurements the `` real '' pellet beam profile , with a fwhm of @xmath38 mm , was obtained .",
    "cm from the vacuum injection capillary exit .",
    "the scans are carried out in both directions .",
    "the skimmer diameter was @xmath39 mm and the corrected symmetric gaussian for the real beam had a fwhm of @xmath38mm.,height=264 ]    from comparing the total number of pellets in the uncollimated beam to the transducer frequency , a survival ratio of 50% was deduced .",
    "this rather low number is also supported from the photos taken just below the vacuum injection capillary .",
    "they indeed show that the inter - pellet distance is sometimes twice the distance of others .",
    "thus a pellet in such a case is `` missing '' .",
    "it is well known that pressurized liquid ejected from a nozzle will form a jet .",
    "a cylinder of jet is dynamically unstable under the action of surface tension .",
    "when a vibration of a certain frequency is applied to the nozzle the corresponding wavelength @xmath29 will force the jet to disintegrate into a stream of uniform - sized droplets . from lord rayleigh s",
    "analysis the disturbance to the shape of the droplets grows most rapidly at an approximate wavelength of @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the diameter of the jet @xcite . in our case",
    "the working frequency has to be set at a much lower frequency than this optimal one to avoid the coalescence effect causing clustering in the high - frequency mode .",
    "we have observed experimentally , like others @xcite also have , that satellite droplets are inevitably formed accompanying the main droplets , quite independent of the experimental configuration .",
    "however , we can tune the transducer frequency slightly so that the satellite droplets could merge into the main droplets as quickly as possible due to their different velocities . for details of the nozzle unit , see fig .",
    "[ fig : ljn ] .      to determine the droplet size one needs to know the jet diameter .",
    "however , the small jet size for a 12-@xmath42 m nozzle in a cryogenic environment is difficult to be measured directly .",
    "we apply fluid dynamics to overcome this problem .    in fluid dynamics",
    "the reynolds number , defined as @xmath43 , is used to distinguish between different types of flows . here",
    ", @xmath44 is the density of liquid hydrogen , @xmath45 is the fluid velocity , and @xmath42 is the dynamic viscosity . when @xmath46 the flow is always laminar , and when @xmath47 it is always turbulent @xcite . for a @xmath21 m inner - diameter nozzle",
    "we get @xmath48 for hydrogen , which means that in order to have a laminar flow the hydrogen fluid must have a velocity @xmath49 m/s .",
    "this is indeed the case , because of the discussion in sec .",
    "[ sec : d_vel_ev ] , resulting in a reynolds number of about 1000 .",
    "most of the pressure drop between the driving pressure and the much lower pressure in the droplet formation chamber will take place near the exit of the nozzle , where the narrowing of the pipe system becomes significant .    using the equations of continuity and momentum conservation ,",
    "we can easily find that for laminar flow the mean velocity of the liquid fluid inside the nozzle ( @xmath50 ) and the velocity of jet ( @xmath51 ) are related as @xcite @xmath52the corresponding relationship between the diameter of the fluid inside the nozzle and the diameter of the jet is given by @xmath53 to summarize : for the present nozzle with a 12-@xmath42 m inner diameter we expect a laminar flow inside the nozzle and the jet size to be @xmath54 m .",
    "it has been further derived that in turbulent flow case the ratio between the diameter of the jet and inner diameter of nozzle ( @xmath55 ) will be less than @xmath56 if we solve the momentum - conservation equation with the velocity distribution of turbulent flow .",
    "this could explain why the experimental measured values of this ratio by other authors are somewhat smaller ( e.g.  a value of approximately 0.80 was given by ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the unstable jet will break up into droplets due to the acoustic excitation .",

    "[ sec : d_size ] ) .",
    "when the droplet travels in the surrounding of gas mixture , the gas actually acts as a viscous fluid and exert a frictional drag force on it . for an isolated spherical droplet , based on newton s resistance law ,",

    "since the gas in the droplet formation chamber can only be pumped away via a @xmath76 mm narrow vacuum injection capillary , this limits gas flow such that the resulted bulk gas velocity in the droplet formation chamber is insignificantly small",

    "the observed relative velocity loss for droplets is only about @xmath36 from the photos , which is just one - third of the above value for an isolated droplet .",

    "we have described how uniform spaced and sized droplets are formed in the droplet formation chamber by an acoustical excitation method . from experimental observations we know that the micro - spheres are in liquid phase at the inlet of the vacuum injection capillary and completely frozen at the skimmer .",
    "thus they must freeze in between . in the absence of supercooling the calculations",
    "show that they would be only partially frozen at the capillary inlet , in contradiction to the observations .",
