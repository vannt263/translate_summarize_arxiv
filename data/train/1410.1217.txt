    "differential geometric ideas were used in graph coloring problems early on .",
    "wernicke @xcite promoted already gauss - bonnet type ideas to the four color problem and used what we today call curvature to graph theory . the discharging method introduced by heesch @xcite",
    "was eventually used by appel and haken @xcite to prove the four color theorem .",
    "this method is conceptionally related to geometric evolution methods : deform the geometry until a situation is reached which can be understood by classification .",
    "birkhoff @xcite and later tutte attached polynomials to graphs which relate modern topological invariants like the jones polynomial .",
    "cayley already geometrized the problem by completing and modifying planar graphs to make them what we would call cubic so that a planar graph looks like discretization of a two dimensional sphere which by gauss bonnet has euler characteristic @xmath11 forcing the existence of vertices with positive curvature .",
    "studying the positive curvature parts is essential in the proof of the four color theorem for planar graphs @xcite .",
    "+ probabilistic methods in geometry are part of integral geometry as pioneered by mathematicians like crofton , blaschke and santal @xcite .",
    "this subject is known also under the name geometric probability theory and has been used extensively in differential geometry .",
    "for example by chern in the form of kinematic formulae @xcite or milnor in proving total curvature estimates @xcite using the fact that curvature @xmath8 of a space curve is an average of indices @xmath5 ( at minima of @xmath3 on the curve ) using a probability space of linear functions @xmath3 .",
    "banchoff used integral geometric methods in @xcite and got analogue results for polyhedra and surfaces .",
    "we have obtained similar results in @xcite for graphs .",
    "integral geometry is also used in other areas and is an applied topic : the cauchy - crofton formula for example expresses the length of a curve as the average number of intersection with a random line . the inverse problem to reconstruct the curve from the number of intersections in each direction is a radon transform problem and part of tomography , a concept which has also been studied in the concept of graph theory already @xcite .",
    "+ in this note we look at an integral geometric topic when coloring finite simple graphs @xmath0 . in full generality , the scalar curvature function ( [ curvature ] ) satisfies the discrete gauss - bonnet formula @xmath9 . in @xcite ,",
    "the focus had been on even dimensional geometric graphs for which @xmath8 is a discretized euler curvature , a pfaffian of the curvature tensor ( @xcite chapter 12 ) . for odd - dimensional geometric graphs ,",
    "it was shown in @xcite using integral geometric methods that the curvature is always constant zero @xcite , a fact already pioneered in piecewise linear polytop situations @xcite .",
    "given a function @xmath12 on a vertex set @xmath13 of a finite simple graph , let @xmath14 denote the subgraph generated by @xmath15 , where @xmath16 generates a graph called the unit sphere of the vertex @xmath17 . in @xcite , we averaged the index @xmath18 over a probability space functions @xmath19 $ ] in such a way that for a fixed vertex , the random variables @xmath20 are all independent and uniformly distribution in @xmath21 $ ] .",
    "we showed that its expectation is the curvature @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the number of @xmath24 subgraphs in the sphere @xmath25 at a vertex @xmath17 and @xmath26 .",
    "+ we know that @xmath27 if @xmath3 is injective .",
    "this is poincar - hopf @xcite .",
    "it can be proven by induction : add a vertex @xmath17 to a graph and extend @xmath3 so that the new point is the maximum of @xmath3 .",
    "this increases the euler characteristic by @xmath28 using the general formula @xmath29 used in the case where @xmath30 is the graph without the new point @xmath31 is the unit ball of the new point @xmath17 and @xmath32 is @xmath14 .",
    "the expectation of poincar - hopf recovers then the gauss - bonnet theorem @xcite @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the euler characteristic of the graph defined as the super count of the number @xmath35 of @xmath24 subgraphs of @xmath4 .",
    "gauss bonnet also immediately follows from the generalized handshaking lemma @xmath36 while @xcite established poincar - hopf only for injective functions , the same induction step also works for locally injective functions : assume it is true for all graphs with @xmath37 vertices and functions @xmath3 which are locally injective , take a graph with @xmath38 vertices and chose a vertex which is a local maximum of @xmath3 at @xmath17 then remove this vertex together with the connections to @xmath39 .",
    "again this reduces the euler characteristic by @xmath40 .",
    "+ the integral geometric approach to gauss - bonnet illustrates an insight attributed in @xcite to gelfand and his school : _ the main trick of classical integral geometry is the  change of order of summation\"_. in our case , one summation happens over the vertex set @xmath13 of the graph , the other integration is performed over the set of functions @xmath3 with respect to some measure .",
    "what can be proven in a few lines for general finite simple graphs can also be done for general compact riemannian manifolds .",
    "the integral geometric approach provides intuition what euler curvature is : it is an expectation of the quantized index values or divisors given as poincar - hopf indices which incidentally play a pivotal role also in baker - norine theory @xcite and especially in higher dimensional versions of this riemann - roch theorem . that also in the continuum , curvature is the expectation of index density is intuitive already in the continuum for manifolds @xmath41 : negative index values are more likely to occur at places with negative curvature ; there is still much to explore however .",
    "we need to investigate in particular what happens if we take the probability space @xmath41 itself and chose for every @xmath42 and some fixed time @xmath43 the heat signature function @xmath44_{xy}$ ] , if @xmath45 is the hodge laplacian of the riemannian manifold .",
    "the question is then how the expectation @xmath46 $ ] of the index density of these functions is related to the classical euler curvature @xcite .",
    "this is interesting because it would allow us to work with a small ( finite dimensional ) probability space .",
    "the smallness of the probability space leads us to the topic covered here . + we look at one of the smallest possible probability spaces for which an index averaging result can hold for graphs .",
    "it turns out that we do not need injectivity of the functions @xmath3 at all .",
    "all we need is local injectivity . in other words",
    ", we can restrict the probability space of functions @xmath3 to * colorings*. this reduces the size of the probability space considerably similarly as in the continuum , the choice of linear functions reduced the probability space from an infinite dimensional class of morse functions to a finite dimensional space of linear functions induced onto the manifold from an ambient euclidean space . while poincar - hopf and the index averaging result hold also for all @xmath47 injective functions",
    ", the probability space of @xmath1 colorings has considerably less elements .",
    "if @xmath2 is the chromatic polynomial of the graph introduced in 1912 by birkhoff in the form of a determinant @xcite , then the probability space has @xmath10 elements .",
    "+ for the octahedron for example , a geometric two - dimensional graph @xmath4 with euler characteristic @xmath48 and chromatic number @xmath49 , the probability space of colorings has @xmath50 elements only .",

    "the reason is that the symmetric group of color permutations acts as measure preserving automorphims on the probability space of functions implying that for any @xmath3 which is in @xmath30 there are @xmath60 functions which are in the complement implying that @xmath30 has probability @xmath59 .",

    "when looking at such colorings , we get a probability space of gradient vector fields .",
    "if @xmath1 is prime , we could look at the eigenvalues of @xmath80 in an extension field of the galois field @xmath81 .",
    "looking at the situation where @xmath1 is the chromatic number of @xmath4 is natural .",

    "we call them * chromatically poor graphs*. examples are trees ( with @xmath63 ) , the octahedron ( with @xmath85 , the complete graphs @xmath86 ( with @xmath87 ) , wheel graphs @xmath88 with an even number of spikes ( with @xmath89 ) or cyclic graphs @xmath90 or more generally any bipartite graph with @xmath63 . since for cyclic graphs @xmath91 , or wheel graphs",
    "@xmath92 we have @xmath93 , the richness of a graph is expected to be exponentially large in @xmath94 in general .",
    "we have done some statistics with the richness function on erds - renyi probability spaces of graphs .",
    "it appears that a limiting distribution could appear .",
    "but this is very preliminary as experiments with larger @xmath37 are costly . for simply connected geometric graphs , we only need satisfy a local degree condition attributed to heawood ( see theorem 2.5 in @xcite or theorem 9.5 in @xcite ) .",
    "related is the conjecture of steinberg from 1975 which claims that every planar graph without 4 and 5 cycles must be 3 colorable .",

    "+ e ) index averaging allows to see that curvature @xmath8 is identically zero for odd - dimensional geometric graphs @xcite , finite simple graphs for which the unit spheres are discrete spheres , geometric @xmath119 dimensional graphs which become contractible after removing one vertex .",
    "the key insight from @xcite is that the symmetric index @xmath120 is related to the euler characteristic of a geometric @xmath121-dimensional graph . establishing @xmath122 to be zero for all @xmath17 implies curvature @xmath8 is zero .",
    "the same holds for riemannian manifolds @xmath41 where it leads to the insight that euler characteristic @xmath123 for even dimensional manifolds is an average of two dimensional sectional curvatures as @xmath123 is also an average of @xmath124 where @xmath125 runs over a probability space of two - dimensional submanifolds @xmath125 of @xmath41 . as in the case of graphs , a probability measure @xmath126 on the set of scalar fields provides us with with curvature and defines geometry . in physics",
    ", one would select a measure @xmath126 which is invariant under the wave equation and refer to the krylov - bogolyubov theorem for existence .",
    "the same can be done using the finite probability space considered here : any coloring @xmath3 of a four dimensional geometric graph defines a two dimensional geometric graph .",
    "the finite probability space of graph colorings allows computations with rather small number of elements .",
    "the natural measure on functions is the product measure .",
    "+ f ) integral geometry naturally bridges the discrete with the continuum .",
    "this was demonstrated early on in the proof of the fry - milnor theorem @xcite , where a knot was approximated with polygons for which curvature is located on a finite set .",
    "similarly , if a compact smooth riemannian manifold @xmath41 is embedded in @xmath127 and discretized by a finite graph @xmath4 , then the euler curvature of the manifold can be obtained as the expectation of indices @xmath5 where @xmath3 is in a finite dimensional probability space of linear functions in the ambient space equipped with a probability measure which is rotationally symmetric .",
    "the same probability space of functions @xmath3 produces random index functions @xmath5 on @xmath4 . the expectation @xmath128 $ ] is then believed to converge to the classical curvature known in differential geometry .",
    "index averaging becomes so a ",
    "monte carlo \" method for curvature and choosing different probability spaces allows to deform the geometry .",
    "the measure can be obtained readily without any tensor analysis : assume for example that the riemannian manifold @xmath41 is diffeomorphic to a sphere @xmath129 and nash embedded in an euclidean space , we get from the linear functions in the ambient space a probability measure @xmath126 on scalar functions of @xmath41 . taking the expectation of the index @xmath5 gives curvature .",
    "now push forward the measure @xmath126 to the function space @xmath130 on @xmath131 to get a measure @xmath132 on the set of all scalar functions on @xmath131 . averaging the index function @xmath5 with respect to that measure",
    "gives the curvature function on the standard sphere in such a way that @xmath133 is an isometry - at least in the sense that curvature agrees .",
    "we do nt know yet that the riemannian metric can be recovered from @xmath132 but we believe it to be possible since the probability measure @xmath126 gives more than just the expectation : it provides moments or correlations and enough constraints to force the riemannian metric .",
    "this is an important question because if we would be able to measure distances from the measure @xmath132 , geometry could be done by studying probability measures on the space of wave functions .",
    "classical riemannian manifolds are then part of a larger space of geometries in which curvature @xmath134 is a distribution , but gauss - bonnet still holds trivially as it is just the expectation of poincar - hopf with respect to a measure .",
    "any sequence of riemannian metrics on a space @xmath41 had now an accumulation point in this bigger arena of geometries , as unlike the space of riemannian metrics , the extended space of measures is compact ."
