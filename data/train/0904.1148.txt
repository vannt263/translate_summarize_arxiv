    "in this paper , we consider the problem of estimating the intensity of a poisson process . from a practical point of view , various methodologies have already been proposed .",
    "see for instance rudemo @xcite who proposed kernel and data - driven histogram rules calibrated by cross - validation .",
    "thresholding algorithms have been performed by donoho @xcite who modified the universal thresholding procedure proposed in @xcite by using the anscombe transform or by kolaczyk @xcite whose procedure is based on the tails of the distribution of the noisy wavelet coefficients of the intensity .",
    "finally , let us cite model selection type estimators built by willett and nowak @xcite based on models spanned by piecewise polynomials . from the theoretical point of view , cavalier and koo @xcite derived minimax rates on besov balls by using wavelet thresholding . in the oracle approach , various optimal adaptive model selection rules have also been built by baraud and birg ' e @xcite , birg @xcite and reynaud - bouret @xcite .",
    "let us mention that these procedures are also minimax provided the intensity to be estimated is assumed to be supported by @xmath3 $ ] .    in a previous paper , refined classical wavelet thresholding algorithms by proposing local data - driven thresholds ( see @xcite ) .",
    "under very mild assumptions , procedure achieves optimal oracle inequalities and optimal minimax rates up to a logarithmic term .",
    "in particular , results are true even if the support of the intensity is unknown or infinite , which is rarely considered in the literature . in @xcite",
    ", we give many arguments to justify this unusual setting and we illustrate the influence of the support on minimax rates by showing how these rates deteriorate when the sparsity of the intensity decreases .",
    "so , algorithm , that is easily implementable , automatically adapts to the unknown regularity of the signal as usual , but also to the unknown support which is not classical .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to study the optimal calibration of the procedure studied in @xcite from both theoretical and practical points of view . for this purpose",
    ", the next subsection briefly describes this procedure ( section [ data - driven ] gives accurate definitions ) and section [ calissue ] presents the calibration issue .",
    "we observe a poisson process @xmath4 whose mean measure @xmath5 is finite on the real line @xmath6 and is absolutely continuous with respect to the lebesgue measure ( see section [ rappelpoisson ] where we recall classical facts on poisson processes ) .",
    "given @xmath7 a positive integer , we define the intensity of @xmath4 as the function @xmath8 that satisfies @xmath9 so , the total number of points of the process @xmath4 , denoted @xmath10 , satisfies @xmath11=n{\\ensuremath{\\vert\\!\\vert f \\vert\\!\\vert}}_1<\\infty.\\ ] ] in particular , @xmath10 is finite almost surely . in the sequel ,",
    "@xmath8 will be held fixed and @xmath7 will go to @xmath12 .",
    "the introduction of @xmath7 could seem artificial , but it allows to present the following asymptotic theoretical results in a meaningful way since the mean of the number of points of @xmath4 goes to @xmath13 when @xmath14 .",
    "in addition , our framework is equivalent to the observation of a @xmath7-sample of a poisson process with common intensity @xmath8 with respect to the lebesgue measure .",
    "the goal of this paper is to estimate @xmath8 by the points of @xmath4 .",
    "first , we decompose the signal @xmath8 to be estimated as follows : @xmath15 where @xmath16 denotes a biorthogonal wavelet basis . in our paper , we mainly focus on the haar basis ( in this case , @xmath17 for any @xmath18 ) or on a special case of biorthogonal spline wavelet bases ( in this case , @xmath19 is piecewise constant and @xmath20 is regular ) .",
    "see section [ biorthogonal ] where we recall well - known facts on biorthogonal wavelet bases or cohen , daubechies and feauveau @xcite for a complete overview on such families . as usual in the wavelet setting , our goal is to estimate the wavelet coefficients @xmath21 by thresholding empirical wavelet coefficients @xmath22 defined as @xmath23 thresholding procedures have been introduced by donoho and johnstone @xcite .",
    "their main idea is that it is sufficient to keep a small amount of the coefficients to have a good estimation of the function @xmath8 . in our setting ,",
    "the estimate of @xmath8 takes the form @xmath24 where @xmath25 is defined in ( [ gamman ] ) .",
    "the thresholding procedure is detailed and discussed in section [ data - driven ] .",
    "we just mention here the form of the data - driven threshold @xmath26 : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is a sharp estimate of @xmath29 defined in ( [ vtilde ] ) and @xmath30 a constant to be chosen .",
    "as explained in section [ data - driven ] , we have for most of the indices @xmath18 s playing a key role for estimation : @xmath31 in this case , @xmath26 has a form close to the universal threshold @xmath32 proposed by donoho and johnstone @xcite in the gaussian regression framework : @xmath33 where @xmath34 ( assumed to be known ) is the variance of each noisy wavelet coefficient .",
    "note , however , that our procedure depends on the so - called _ threshold parameter _",
    "@xmath30 that has to be properly chosen .",
    "the next section which describes calibration issues in a general way discusses this question .",
    "the major concern of this paper is the study of the calibration of the threshold parameter @xmath30 : how should this parameter be chosen to obtain good results in both theory and practice ? as usual , it can be proved that @xmath35 achieves good theoretical performances in minimax or oracle points of view ( see @xcite or theorem [ inegoraclelavraie ] ) provided @xmath30 is large enough .",
    "such an assumption is very classical in the literature ( see for instance @xcite , @xcite , @xcite or @xcite ) . unfortunately , most of the time , the theoretical choice of the threshold parameter is not suitable for practical issues .",
    "more precisely , this choice is often too conservative .",
    "see for instance juditsky and lambert - lacroix @xcite who illustrate this statement in remark 5 of their paper : their threshold parameter , denoted @xmath18 , has to be larger than 14 to obtain theoretical results , but they suggest to use @xmath36 $ ] for practical issues .",
    "so , one of the main goals of this paper is to fill the gap between the optimal parameter choice provided by theoretical results on the one hand and by a simulation study on the other hand .",
    "only a few papers have been devoted to theoretical calibration of statistical procedures . in the model selection",
    "setting , the issue of calibration has been addressed by birg and massart @xcite .",
    "they considered penalized estimators in a gaussian homoscedastic regression framework with known variance and calibration of penalty constants is based on the following methodology .",
    "they showed that there exists a minimal penalty in the sense that taking smaller penalties leads to inconsistent estimation procedures . under some conditions",
    ", they further prove that the optimal penalty is twice the minimal penalty .",
    "this relationship characterizes the `` slope heuristic '' of birg and massart @xcite .",
    "such a method has been successfully applied for practical purposes in @xcite .",
    "baraud , giraud and huet @xcite ( respectively arlot and massart @xcite ) generalized these results when the variance is unknown ( respectively for non - gaussian or heteroscedastic data ) .",
    "these approaches constitute alternatives to popular cross - validation methods ( see @xcite or @xcite ) . for instance , @xmath37-fold cross - validation ( see @xcite ) is widely used to calibrate procedure parameters but its computational cost can be high .",
    "the starting point of our results is the oracle inequality stated in section [ data - driven ] : theorem [ inegoraclelavraie ] shows that the estimate @xmath35 achieves the oracle risk up to a logarithmic term .",
    "this result is true as soon as @xmath38 and @xmath39 . in particular",
    ", nothing is assumed with respect to the support of @xmath8 or @xmath40 : our result remains true if @xmath41 and if the support of @xmath8 is unknown or infinite .",
    "the oracle inequality of theorem [ inegoraclelavraie ] is refined in section [ study ] where @xmath8 is assumed to belong to a special class denoted @xmath42 whose signals have only a finite number of non - zero wavelet coefficients ( see theorem [ classfn ] ) .",
    "then , in the perspective of calibrating thresholding rules , we consider theoretical performances of @xmath35 with @xmath43 by using the haar basis .",
    "for the signal @xmath44}$ ] , theorem [ inegoraclelavraie ] shows that @xmath35 with @xmath45 achieves the rate @xmath46 .",
    "but the lower bound of theorem [ lower ] shows that the rate of @xmath35 with @xmath43 is larger than @xmath47 for @xmath48 .",
    "so , as in @xcite for instance , we prove the existence of a minimal threshold parameter : @xmath49 .",
    "of course , the next step concerns the existence of a maximal threshold parameter .",
    "this issue is answered by theorem [ uppth ] which studies the maximal ratio between the risk of @xmath35 and the oracle risk on @xmath42 .",
    "we derive a lower bound that shows that taking @xmath50 leads to worse rates constants : a bad choice .",
    "the optimal choice for @xmath0 is derived from a numerical study , keeping in mind that the theory points out the range @xmath2 $ ] .",
    "some simulations are provided for estimating various signals by considering either the haar basis or a particular biorthogonal spline wavelet basis ( see section [ simulations ] ) .",
    "our numerical results show that choosing @xmath0 larger than 1 but close to 1 is a fairly good choice , which corroborates theoretical results .",
    "actually , our simulation study suggests that theorem [ lower ] remains true for all signals of @xmath42 whatever the basis for decomposing signals is used .",
    "finally , we lead a comparative study with other competitive procedures .",
    "we show that the thresholding rule proposed in this paper outperforms universal thresholding ( when combined with the anscombe transform ) or kolaczyk s procedure .",
    "finally , the robustness of our procedure with respect to the support issue is emphasized and we show the harmful role played by large supports of signals when estimation is performed by other classical procedures .",
    "section [ data - driven ] defines the thresholding estimate @xmath35 and studies its properties under the oracle approach . in section",
    "[ study ] , we refine this study on the set of positive functions that can be decomposed on a finite combination of the basis .",
    "calibration of thresholds is discussed in section [ penaltyterm ] and section [ simulations ] illustrates our theoretical results by some simulations .",
    "section [ proofs ] is devoted to the proofs of the results .",
    "finally , section [ maintools ] recalls well - known facts on poisson processes and biorthogonal wavelet bases .",
    "now , let us consider our procedure . theorem [ inegoraclelavraie ] applied with the haar basis , @xmath51 and @xmath52 implies that if @xmath53 is used with @xmath45 to estimate @xmath54}$ ] then its risk satisfies @xmath55 where @xmath56 is a constant .",
    "the question is : what happens , from the theoretical point of view , when @xmath57 ? the following result answers this question for the case @xmath43 .",
    "let @xmath44}$ ] .",
    "if @xmath43 then there exists @xmath48 not dependent of @xmath7 such that @xmath58    the question for the case @xmath59 remains open",
    ". however , combining theorems [ inegoraclelavraie ] and [ lower ] , proves that from a theoretical point of view , it is a very bad idea to use a parameter @xmath0 smaller than @xmath60 since in this case we can not achieve the rate @xmath61 obtained when @xmath45 .",
    "this result is reinforced by the simulation study of section [ simulations ] , where we observe that performances of our estimate deteriorate for @xmath43 and the optimal values of @xmath30 for estimating @xmath54}$ ] are larger or equal to 1 .",
    "so , theoretical and practical conclusions for calibrating thresholds fit for this simple example .",
    "unfortunately , we are not able to generalize theorem [ lower ] for @xmath62 , or for other signals decomposed on general biorthogonal wavelet bases , but our simulation study suggests that theorem [ lower ] remains true in some situations ( see section [ simulations ] ) . actually , our numerical results show that choosing @xmath0 larger than 1 but close to 1 is a fairly good choice for all the encountered situations ( finite / infinite support , bounded / unbounded intensity , smooth / non - smooth functions ) .    finally , we investigate an upper bound for the optimal choice of @xmath30 . for this purpose",
    ", we consider a special class of intensity functions denoted @xmath63 .",
    "corollary [ classfn ] and theorem [ uppth ] of section [ penaltyterm ] provide upper and lower bounds of the maximal ratio on @xmath63 of the risk of @xmath64 by the oracle risk and prove that @xmath0 should not be too large .",
    "the goal of this section is to specify our thresholding rule . for this purpose , we assume that @xmath8 belongs to @xmath65 and we use the decomposition of @xmath8 on one of the biorthogonal wavelet bases described in section [ biorthogonal ] .",
    "we recall that , as classical orthonormal wavelet bases , biorthogonal wavelet bases are generated by dilatations and translations of father and mother wavelets . but considering biorthogonal wavelets allows to distinguish , if necessary , wavelets for analysis ( that are piecewise constant functions in this paper ) and wavelets for reconstruction with a prescribed number of continuous derivatives .",
    "then , the decomposition of @xmath8 on a biorthogonal wavelet basis takes the following form : @xmath66 where for any @xmath67 and any @xmath68 , @xmath69 see section [ biorthogonal ] for further details . to shorten mathematical expressions",
    ", we set @xmath70 and for any @xmath71 , @xmath72 ( respectively @xmath73 ) if @xmath74 and @xmath75 ( respectively @xmath76 ) if @xmath77 with @xmath67 .",
    "similarly , @xmath78 if @xmath74 and @xmath79 if @xmath77 with @xmath80",
    ". now , ( [ decom2 ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath81 in particular , ( [ decom ] ) holds for the haar basis that will play a special role in this paper , where in this case @xmath82 .",
    "now , let us define the thresholding estimate of @xmath8 by using the properties of poisson processes .",
    "first , we introduce for any @xmath71 , the natural estimator of @xmath83 defined by @xmath84 where we denote by @xmath85 the discrete random measure @xmath86 and for any compactly supported function @xmath87 , @xmath88 so , the estimator @xmath89 is unbiased : @xmath90",
    ". then , given some parameter @xmath91 , we define the threshold @xmath26 mentioned in introduction as @xmath92 with @xmath93 where @xmath94 note that @xmath95 satisfies @xmath96 , where @xmath97 finally , with @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the integer such that @xmath100 , we set for any @xmath71 , @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "finally , the estimator of @xmath8 is @xmath103 and only depends on the choice of @xmath0 .",
    "when the haar basis is used , the estimate is denoted @xmath104 and its wavelet coefficients are denoted @xmath105 .",
    "the threshold @xmath106 seems to be defined in a rather complicated manner but we can notice the following fact .",
    "given @xmath107 , when there exists a constant @xmath108 such that @xmath109 for @xmath110 in the support of @xmath19 @xmath111 , , with large probability , the deterministic term of ( [ defthresh ] ) is negligible with respect to the random one .",
    "we asymptotically @xmath112 as stated in introduction .",
    "actually , the deterministic term of ( [ defthresh ] ) allows to consider @xmath0 close to 1 and to control large deviations terms for high resolution levels . in the same spirit",
    ", @xmath113 is slightly overestimated and we consider @xmath114 instead of @xmath115 to define the threshold .    the performance of this procedure has been investigated in the oracle point of view in @xcite .",
    "we recall that in the context of wavelet function estimation by thresholding , the oracle does not tell us the true function , but tells us the coefficients that have to be kept .",
    "this `` estimator '' obtained with the aid of an oracle is not a true estimator , of course , since it depends on @xmath8 .",
    "but it represents an ideal for the particular estimation method .",
    "the goal of the oracle approach is to derive true estimators which can essentially `` mimic '' the performance of the `` oracle estimator '' . in our framework , it is easy to see that the oracle estimate is @xmath116 , where @xmath117 @xmath118 by keeping the coefficients @xmath89 larger than thresholds defined in ( [ defthresh ] ) , our estimator has a risk that is not larger than the oracle risk , up to a logarithmic term , as stated by the following key result .",
    "[ inegoraclelavraie ] let us consider a biorthogonal wavelet basis satisfying the properties described in section [ biorthogonal ] .",
    "if @xmath45 , then @xmath119 satisfies the following oracle inequality : for @xmath7 large enough @xmath120 where @xmath121 is a positive constant depending only on @xmath30 and on the functions that generate the biorthogonal wavelet basis .",
    "@xmath122 is also a positive constant depending on @xmath30 , @xmath123 and on the functions that generate the basis .    following the oracle point of view of donoho and johnstone , theorem [ inegoraclelavraie ]",
    "shows that our procedure is optimal up to the logarithmic factor .",
    "this logarithmic term is in some sense unavoidable .",
    "it is the price we pay for adaptivity ( i.e. for not knowing the coefficients that we must keep ) .",
    "our result is true provided @xmath124 .",
    "so , assumptions on @xmath8 are very mild most of the results for non - parametric estimation procedures one assumes that @xmath125 and @xmath8 has a compact support .",
    "this support and @xmath40 are often known in the literature . @xmath8 and its support can be unbounded .",
    "so , we make as few assumptions as possible .",
    "this is allowed by considering random thresholding with the data - driven thresholds defined in ( [ defthresh ] ) .",
    "this result is proved in @xcite where in addition optimality properties of the estimate ( [ defest ] ) under the minimax approach are established .",
    "a glance at the proof of theorem [ inegoraclelavraie ] shows that the constants @xmath121 and @xmath122 strongly depends on @xmath0 . actually , without further assumptions on @xmath8 , the constants @xmath121 and @xmath122 blow up when @xmath0 tends to @xmath60 .",
    "in particular , such an oracle inequality is not sharp enough for some calibration issues . in the next section",
    ", we investigate this problem and we derive sharp oracle inequalities for a large class of functions .",
    "furthermore , the upper bound in ( [ majofn ] ) depends on absolute constants whose size is acceptable .",
    "in the sequel , we consider the haar basis and the estimator @xmath126 .",
    "we restrict our study on estimation of the functions of @xmath127 defined as the set of positive functions that can be decomposed on a finite combination of @xmath128 : @xmath129 to study sharp performances of our procedure , we introduce a subclass of the class @xmath127 : for any @xmath7 and any radius @xmath130 , we define : @xmath131 where for any @xmath18 , we set @xmath132 which allows to establish a decomposition of @xmath127 .",
    "indeed , we have the following result proved in section [ preuvepropsharp ] :    [ propsharp ] when @xmath7 ( or @xmath130 ) increases , @xmath133 is a non - decreasing sequence of sets . in addition",
    ", we have : @xmath134    the definition of @xmath135 especially relies on the technical condition @xmath136 remember that the distribution of the number of points of @xmath4 that lies in @xmath137 is the poisson distribution with mean @xmath138 .",
    "so , the previous condition ensures that we have a significant number of of @xmath4 to estimate non - zero wavelet coefficients .",
    "another main point is that under ( [ condfn ] ) , @xmath139 ( see section [ sec : proofclassfn ] ) , so ( [ approxseuil ] ) is true with large probability .",
    "the term @xmath140 appears for technical reasons but could be replaced by any term @xmath141 such that @xmath142 in practice , many interesting signals are well approximated by a function of @xmath143 .",
    "so , using proposition [ propsharp ] , a convenient estimate is an estimate with a good behavior on @xmath135 , at least for large values of @xmath7 and @xmath130 .",
    "furthermore , note that we do not have any restriction on the location of the support of functions of @xmath135 ( these functions have only a finite set of non - zero wavelet coefficients ) .",
    "this provides a second reason for considering @xmath135 if we are interested in estimated signals with unknown or infinite supports .",
    "we now focus on @xmath126 with the special value @xmath144 and we study its properties on @xmath42 .",
    "[ classfn ] let @xmath145 be fixed .",
    "let @xmath144 and let @xmath106 be as in ( [ defthresh ] ) . then @xmath126 achieves the following oracle inequality : for @xmath7 large enough , for any @xmath146 , @xmath147 . \\ ] ]    inequality ( [ majofn ] ) shows that on @xmath42 , our estimate achieves the oracle risk up to the term @xmath148 and the term @xmath149 . finally , mention that when @xmath146 , @xmath150 our result is stated with @xmath144 .",
    "this value comes from optimizations of upper bounds given by lemma [ lemmesharp ] stated in section [ sec : proofclassfn ] .",
    "constitutes a first theoretical calibration result and is the first step for choosing the parameter @xmath30 in an optimal way .",
    "the next section further investigates this problem .",
    "in this section , our goal is to find lower and upper bounds for the parameter @xmath0 .",
    "theorem [ inegoraclelavraie ] established that for any signal , we achieve the oracle estimator up to a logarithmic term provided @xmath38 .",

    "the following result shows that this rate can not be achieved for this particular signal when @xmath43 .",
    "[ lower ] let @xmath44}$ ] . if @xmath43 then there exists @xmath48 not dependent of @xmath7 such that @xmath152 where @xmath153 is a constant .",
    "theorem [ lower ] establishes that , asymptotically , @xmath126 with @xmath1 can not estimate a very simple signal ( @xmath44}$ ] ) at a convenient rate of convergence .",
    "this provides a lower bound for the threshold parameter @xmath0 : we have to take @xmath154 .",
    "now , let us study the upper bound for the parameter @xmath30 .",
    "for this purpose , we do not consider a particular signal , but we use the worst oracle ratio on the whole class @xmath42 .",
    "remember that when @xmath144 , theorem [ classfn ] gives that this ratio can not grow faster than @xmath155 , when @xmath7 goes to @xmath13 : for @xmath7 large enough , @xmath156 our aim is to establish that the oracle ratio on @xmath42 for the estimator @xmath157 where @xmath30 is large , is larger than the previous upper bound .",
    "this goal is reached in the following theorem .",
    "[ uppth ] let @xmath158 be fixed and let @xmath159 . then , for any @xmath160 , @xmath161    now , if we choose @xmath162 , we can take @xmath158 such that the resulting maximal oracle ratio of @xmath126 is larger than @xmath155 for @xmath7 large enough .",
    "so , taking @xmath50 is a bad choice for estimation on the whole class @xmath42 .",
    "note that the function @xmath54}$ ] belongs to @xmath163 , .",
    "so , combining theorems [ classfn ] , [ lower ] and [ uppth ] proves that the convenient choice for @xmath0 belongs to the interval @xmath164 $ ] .",
    "finally , observe that the rate exponent deteriorates for @xmath1 whereas we only prove that the choice @xmath165 leads to worse rates constants .",
    "in this section , some simulations are provided and the performances of the thresholding rule are measured from the numerical point of view by comparing our estimator with other well - known procedures .",
    "we also discuss the ideal choice for the parameter @xmath0 keeping in mind that the value @xmath49 constitutes a border for the theoretical results ( see theorems [ inegoraclelavraie ] and [ lower ] ) . for these purposes ,",
    "our procedure is performed for estimating various intensity signals and the wavelet set - up associated with biorthogonal wavelet bases is considered .",
    "more precisely , we focus either on the haar basis where @xmath166},\\quad \\psi=\\tilde\\psi={1}_{[0,1/2]}-{1}_{]1/2,1]}\\]]or on a special case of spline systems given in figure [ fig - basespline ] .     and @xmath167 ,",
    "bottom : @xmath168 and @xmath169    the latter , called hereafter the spline basis , has the following properties .",
    "first , the support of @xmath170 , @xmath167 , @xmath168 and @xmath171 is included in @xmath172 $ ] .",
    "the reconstruction wavelets @xmath168 and @xmath171 belong to @xmath173 . finally , the wavelet @xmath167 is a piecewise constant function orthogonal to polynomials of degree 4 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "so , such a basis has properties 15 required in section [ biorthogonal ] with @xmath174 .",
    "then , the signal @xmath8 to be estimated is decomposed as follows : @xmath175 for estimating @xmath8 , we use the empirical coefficients @xmath176 associated with a poisson process @xmath4 whose intensity with respect to the lebesgue measure is @xmath177 . since @xmath170 and @xmath167 are piecewise constant functions , accurate values of the are available , which allows to avoid many computational and approximation issues that often arise in the wavelet setting .",
    "we consider the thresholding rule @xmath178 with @xmath35 defined in ( [ defest ] ) with @xmath179 and @xmath180 observe that @xmath106 slightly differs from the threshold defined in ( [ defthresh ] ) since @xmath28 is now replaced with @xmath95 .",
    "it allows to derive the parameter @xmath0 as an explicit function of the threshold which is necessary to draw figures without using a discretization of @xmath0 , which is crucial in section [ calibrationnumerical ] .",
    "the performances of our thresholding rule associated with the threshold @xmath106 defined in ( [ defthresh ] ) are probably equivalent ( see ( [ inegseuil ] ) ) .",
    "the numerical performance of our procedure is first illustrated by performing it for estimating nine various signals whose definitions are given in section [ defsignal ] .",
    "these functions are respectively denoted haar1 , haar2 , blocks , comb , gauss1 , gauss2 , beta0.5 , beta4 and bumps and have been chosen to represent the wide variety of signals arising in signal processing .",
    "each of them satisfies @xmath181 and can be classified according to the following criteria : the smoothness , the size of the support ( finite / infinite ) , the value of the sup norm ( finite / infinite ) and the shape ( to be piecewise constant or a mixture of peaks ) .",
    "remember that when estimating @xmath8 , our thresholding algorithm does not use @xmath40 , the smoothness of @xmath8 and the support of @xmath8 denoted @xmath182 ( in particular @xmath40 and @xmath182 can be infinite ) .",
    "simulations are performed with @xmath183 , so we observe in average @xmath184 points of the underlying poisson process . to complete the definition of @xmath178 , we rely on theorems [ inegoraclelavraie ] and [ lower ] and we choose @xmath185 and @xmath49 ( see conclusions of section [ calibrationnumerical ] ) . figure [ fig - reconstruction ] displays intensity reconstructions we obtain for the haar and the spline bases .    the preliminary conclusions drawn from figure [ fig - reconstruction ] are the following .",
    "as expected , a convenient choice of the wavelet system improves the reconstructions .",
    "we notice that the estimate @xmath186 seems to perform well for estimating the size and the location of peaks .",
    "finally , we emphasize that the support of each signal does not play any role ( compare estimation of comb which has an infinite support and the estimation of haar1 for instance ) .      in this section",
    ", we deal with the choice of the threshold parameter @xmath0 in our procedures from a practical point of view .",
    "we already know that the interval @xmath164 $ ] is the right range for @xmath0 , theoretically speaking .",

    "the wavelet basis is well adapted to the signals of this class that contains haar1 , haar2 and comb for the haar basis and gauss1 and gauss2 for the spline basis . for such signals ,",
    "the estimation problem is close to a parametric problem . in this case",
    ", the performance of the oracle estimate can be achieved at least for @xmath7 large enough and ( [ super ] ) is true for @xmath0 belonging to a large interval that contains the value @xmath49 .",
    "these numerical conclusions strengthen and generalize theoretical conclusions of section [ penaltyterm ] .",
    "the second class of functions is the class of irregular signals with significant wavelet coefficients at high resolution levels . for such signals @xmath217 and",
    "there is no `` plateau '' phenomenon ( in particular , we do not have @xmath218 ) .",
    "of course , estimation is easier and performances of our procedure are better when the signal belongs to the first class .",
    "but in practice , it is hard to choose a wavelet system such that the intensity to be estimated satisfies this property .",
    "however , our study allows to use the following simple rule .",
    "if the practitioner has no idea of the ideal wavelet basis to use , he should perform the thresholding rule with @xmath49 ( or @xmath0 slightly larger than 1 ) that leads to convenient results whatever the class the signal belongs to .",
    "now , let us compare our procedure with classical ones .",
    "we first consider the methodology based on the anscombe transformation of poisson type observations ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this preproprecessing yields gaussian data with a constant noise level close to 1 . then , universal wavelet thresholding proposed by donoho and johnstone @xcite is applied with the haar basis .",
    "kolaczyk corrected this standard algorithm for burst - like poisson data .",
    "he proposed to use haar wavelet thresholding directly on the binned data with especially calibrated thresholds ( see @xcite and @xcite ) . in the sequel ,",
    "these algorithms are respectively denoted anscombe - uni and corrected .",
    "we briefly mention that corrected requires the knowledge of a so - called background rate that is empirically estimated in our paper ( note however that corrected heavily depends on the precise knowledge of the background rate as shown by the extensive study of besbeas , de feis and sapatinas @xcite ) .",
    "one can combine the wavelet transform and translation invariance to eliminate the shift dependence of the haar basis .",
    "when anscombe - uni and corrected are combined with translation invariance , they are respectively denoted anscombe - uni - ti and corrected - ti in the sequel .",
    "finally , we consider the penalized piecewise - polynomial rule proposed by willett and nowak @xcite ( denoted free - degree in the sequel ) for multiscale poisson intensity estimation . unlike our estimator , the knowledge of the support of @xmath219 is essential to perform all these procedures that will be sometimes called `` support - dependent strategies '' along this section .",
    "we first consider estimation of the signal haar2 supported by @xmath3 $ ] for which reconstructions with @xmath183 are proposed in figure [ fig - reconstruction - haar2 ] where we have taken the positive part of each estimate .",
    "for anscombe - uni , corrected and their counterparts based on translation invariance , the finest resolution level for thresholding is chosen to give good overall performances . for our random thresholding procedures ,",
    "respectively based on the haar and spline bases and respectively denoted rand - thresh - haar and rand - thresh - spline , we still use @xmath49 and @xmath185 .",
    "we note that for the setting of figure [ fig - reconstruction - haar2 ] , translation invariance oversmooths estimators .",
    "furthermore , comparing ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) , we observe that universal thresholding is too conservative .",
    "our procedure works well provided the haar basis is chosen , whereas free - degree automatically selects a piecewise constant estimator .    .",
    "( a ) anscombe - uni ; ( b ) corrected ; ( c ) rand - thresh - haar ; ( d ) anscombe - uni - ti ; ( e ) corrected - ti ; ( f ) free - degree ; ( g ) rand - thresh - spline . ]    now , let us consider a non - compactly supported signal based on a mixture of two gaussian densities .",
    "we denote @xmath220 the distance between modes of these gaussian densities , so the intensity associated with this signal is @xmath221 and we take @xmath183 . to apply support - dependent strategies",
    ", we consider the interval given by the smallest and the largest observations and data are first rescaled to be supported by the interval @xmath3 $ ] .",

    "rand - thresh - haar outperforms anscombe - uni and corrected but all these procedures are too rough .",
    "to some extent , it is also true for anscombe - uni - ti and corrected - ti even if translation invariance improves the corresponding reconstructions .",
    "this is not the case for rand - thresh - spline and free - degree .",
    "when @xmath223 , performances of all the support - dependent strategies deteriorate , which illustrates the harmful role of the support . in particular , procedures based on the translation invariance principle which periodizes the data , deal with the two main parts of the signal as if they were close to each other , are quite inadequate .",
    "the worse performances of free - degree for @xmath223 could be expected since its theoretical performances are established under the strong assumption that the signal is bounded from below on its support . to strengthen these results and to show the influence of the support , we compute the mean square error over 100 simulations for each method and we provide the corresponding boxplots given in figure [ fig - moustache ] associated with @xmath224 when @xmath225    note that when @xmath220 increases , unlike the other algorithms , performances of our thresholding rule based either on the haar or on the spline basis are remarkably stable . in particular , for @xmath223 , rand - thresh - spline outperforms the other algorithms .",
    "the main conclusions of this short study are the following .",
    "we note that the estimate proposed in this paper outperforms anscombe - uni and corrected ( compare ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) ) , showing that the data - driven calibrated threshold proposed in ( [ defthresh ] ) improves classical ones .",
    "in particular , classical methods highly depend on the way data are binned and on the choice of resolutions levels where coefficients are thresholded , whereas our methodology only depends on @xmath0 and on @xmath211 for which we propose to take systematically @xmath49 and @xmath226 .",
    "however , unlike free - degree , we have to choose a convenient wavelet basis for decomposing signals . finally , the support , if too large , can play a harmful role whenever the method needs to rescale the data .",
    "this is not the case for the method presented in this paper , which explains the robustness of our procedures with respect to the support issue .",
    "the first point is obvious . for the second point , first , let us take @xmath227 .",

    "<S> this result is proved under mild assumptions and we do not impose any condition on the support of the signal to be estimated . </S>",
    "<S> our procedure is based on data - driven thresholds . as usual , they depend on a threshold parameter @xmath0 whose optimal value is hard to estimate from the data . our main concern is to provide some theoretical and numerical results to handle this issue . in particular , we establish the existence of a minimal threshold parameter from the theoretical point of view : taking @xmath1 deteriorates oracle performances of our procedure . in the same spirit , we establish the existence of a maximal threshold parameter and our theoretical results point out the optimal range @xmath2 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> then , we lead a numerical study that shows that choosing @xmath0 larger than 1 but close to 1 is a fairly good choice . finally , we compare our procedure with classical ones revealing the harmful role of the support of functions when estimated by classical procedures .    </S>",
