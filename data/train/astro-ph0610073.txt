    "the sun is a magnetic star whose variable activity has profound effects on our technological society on earth .",
    "the high speed solar wind and its energetic particles , coronal mass ejections , and explosive flares are all linked to the changing magnetic fields within the extended solar atmosphere .",
    "such events can serve to damage satellites in space and power grids on the ground , and interrupt communications .",
    "thus there is keen interest in being able to forecast the behavior of the magnetic structures . yet",
    "this has proved to be difficult , since the eruption of new magnetic flux through the solar surface appears to have a dominant role in the evolution of field configurations in the solar atmosphere , as does the shuffling of field footpoints by the subsurface turbulence .",
    "the origin of the solar magnetic fields must rest with dynamo processes occurring deep within the star in the spherical shell of intensely turbulent convection that occupies the outer 29% in radius below the solar surface . within this convection zone ,",
    "complex interactions between compressible turbulence and rotation of the star serve to redistribute angular momentum so that a strong differential rotation is achieved .",
    "further , since the fluid is electrically conducting , currents will flow and magnetic fields must be built .",
    "yet there are many fundamental puzzles about the dynamo action that yields the observed fields .    the magnetic fields , like the underlying turbulence , can be both orderly on some scales and chaotic on others .",
    "most striking is that the sun exhibits 22-year cycles of global magnetic activity , involving sunspot eruptions with very well defined rules for field parity and emergence latitudes as the cycle evolves .",
    "coexisting with these large - scale ordered magnetic structures are small - scale but intense magnetic fluctuations that emerge over much of the solar surface , with little regard for the solar cycle .",
    "this diverse range of activity is most likely generated by two conceptually distinct magnetic dynamos ( e.g. , weiss 1994 ; childress & gilbert 1995 ; cattaneo 1999 ; cattaneo & hughes 2001 ; ossendrijver 2003 ) .",
    "these involve a _ small - scale dynamo _ , functioning within the intense turbulence of the upper convection zone , that builds the chaotic magnetic fluctuations , and a _ global dynamo _ , operating both within the deeper convection zone and the strong rotational shear of the tachocline at its base , that builds the more ordered fields .",
    "the pairing of opposite polarity sunspots in the east - west direction within active regions is most readily interpreted as the surface emergence of large - scale toroidal field structures .",
    "these structures are created somewhere below the photosphere and rise upwards , bending to pierce the photosphere in the form of curved tubes .",
    "the current paradigm for large - scale dynamo action ( e.g. , parker 1993 ) involves two major components .",
    "first , strong toroidal field structures must be generated .",
    "this is believed to occur due to the stretching that any differential rotation in latitude or radius will impose on any weak existing poloidal field .",
    "this first process is often referred to as the @xmath0-effect after its parameterization within the framework of mean - field electrodynamics ( e.g. , moffatt 1978 ; krause & rdler 1980 ; parker 1989 ) .",
    "helioseismology has shown that gradients in angular velocity are particularly strong in the tachocline , pointing to this interface region between the convection zone and the deeper radiative interior as the likely site for the generation of strong toroidal fields .",
    "second , an inverse process is required to complete the cycle , regenerating the poloidal field from the toroidal field .",
    "different theories exist for the operation of this process ( known as the @xmath1-effect ) .",
    "some have the poloidal field regenerated at the surface through the breakup and reconnection of the large - scale field that emerges as active regions , where this field has gained a poloidal component due to coriolis forces during its rise , with meridional flows having a key role in transporting such flux both poleward and down toward the tachocline ( e.g. , babcock 1961 ; leighton 1969 ; wang & sheeley 1991 ; durney 1997 ; dikpati & charbonneau 1999 ) .",
    "others believe that the poloidal field is regenerated by the cumulative action of many small - scale cyclonic turbulent motions on the field throughout the convection zone , rather than just close to the surface ( e.g. , parker 1993 ) . in either scenario , there is separation in the sites of generation of toroidal field ( in the strong shear of the tachocline ) and regeneration of poloidal field ( either near the surface or in the bulk of the convection zone ) , yielding what is now broadly called an _ interface dynamo _ ( parker 1993 ) .",
    "recent mean - field dynamo approaches ( e.g. , rdiger & brandenburg 1995 ; tobias 1996 , charbonneau & macgregor 1997 , beer et al .",
    "1998 ) suggest that such an interface model can circumvent the problem of strong @xmath1-quenching by mean magnetic fields ( cattaneo & hughes 1996 ) , thereby being capable of yielding field strengths comparable to those inferred from observations .    the interface dynamo paradigm is thus based on the following underlying processes or building blocks :  @xmath2 the @xmath1-effect : the generation of the background weak poloidal field , either by cyclonic turbulence within the convection zone or by breakup of active regions .",
    "@xmath3 the @xmath4-effect or turbulent transport : the transport of the weak poloidal field from its generating region to the region of strong shear , the tachocline .",
    "@xmath5 the @xmath0-effect : the organization and amplification of the magnetic field by differential rotation , particularly by large - scale rotational shear in the tachocline , into strong , isolated magnetic structures that are toroidal in character .",
    "@xmath6 ) magnetic buoyancy : the rise and transport of the large - scale toroidal field by magnetic buoyancy into and through the convection zone to be either shredded and recycled or to emerge as active regions .    since all models presume close linkages between the differential rotation of the sun and the operation of its global dynamo , let us briefly review what is known about the angular velocity @xmath7 profile with radius and latitude .",
    "helioseismology , which involves the study of the acoustic @xmath8-mode oscillations of the solar interior ( e.g. gough & toomre 1991 ) , has provided a new window for studying dynamical processes deep within the sun .",
    "this has been enabled by the nearly continuous and complementary helioseismic observations provided from both the vantage point of the soho spacecraft with the high - resolution michelson doppler imager ( soi  mdi ) ( scherrer et al .",
    "1995 ) and from the ground - based global oscillation network group ( gong ) set of six related instruments distributed at different longitudes across the earth ( harvey et al .",
    "helioseismology has revealed that the rotation profiles obtained by inversion of frequency splittings of the @xmath8 modes ( e.g. , thompson et al .",
    "1996 , schou et al .",
    "1998 , howe et al .",
    "2000 , thompson et al .",
    "2003 ) have a striking behavior that is unlike any anticipated by convection theory prior to such probing of the interior of a star .",
    "the strong latitudinal variation of angular velocity @xmath7 observed near the surface , where the rotation is considerably faster at the equator than near the poles , extends through much of the convection zone depth ( about 200 mm ) with relatively little radial dependence .",
    "another striking feature is the tachocline ( e.g. , spiegel & zahn 1992 ) , a region of strong shear at the base of the convection zone where @xmath7 adjusts to apparent solid body rotation in the deeper radiative interior .",
    "a thin _ near - surface shear layer _ is also present in which @xmath7 increases with depth at intermediate and low latitudes .",
    "this subsurface region is now being intensively probed using local domain helioseismic methods , revealing the presence of remarkable large - scale meandering flow fields much like jet streams , banded zonal flows and evolving meridional circulations , all of which contribute to what is called solar subsurface weather ( ssw ) ( haber et al .",
    "2000 , 2002 ; toomre 2002 ) .",
    "computational resources are currently insufficient to enable modelling a complete dynamical system incorporating all the diverse aspects of the large - scale solar dynamo .",
    "our goal is therefore to study individually some of the essential processes , with a view to eventually combine such findings into a more complete nonlinear interface - type solar dynamo model as resources become available . in this spirit",
    ", there has been substantial theoretical progress recently in trying to understand how the differential rotation profiles deduced from helioseismology may be established in the bulk of the convection zone .",
    "building on the early three - dimensional numerical simulations of rotating convection in spherical shells ( e.g. , gilman & miller 1981 ; glatzmaier & gilman 1982 ; glatzmaier 1985a , b , 1987 ; sun & schubert 1995 ) , recent modelling using the anelastic spherical harmonic ( ash ) code on massively - parallel supercomputers ( e.g. , miesch et al . 2000 ; elliott , miesch & toomre 2000 ; brun & toomre 2002 ) has permitted attaining fairly turbulent states of convection in which the resulting @xmath7 profiles now begin to capture many elements of the deduced interior profiles .",
    "these simulations possess fast equatorial rotation , substantial contrasts in @xmath7 with latitude , and reduced tendencies for @xmath7 to be constant on cylinders .",
    "the role of the reynolds stresses and of meridional circulations within such convection in redistributing the angular momentum to achieve such differential rotation over much of the convection zone is becoming evident .",
    "however , the simulations with ash have only just begun to examine how the near - surface rotational shear layer may be established ( derosa , gilman & toomre 2002 ) , whereas the formation and maintenance of a tachocline near the base of the convection zone has only been tentatively considered within three - dimensional simulations that admit downward penetration ( miesch et al . 2000 ) .",
    "dynamics within the solar tachocline and overshoot region are thought to be extremely complex ( e.g.  gilman 2000 ; ossendrijver 2003 ) .",
    "the upper portion of the tachocline may extend into the convective envelope whereas the lower portion consists of a stably - stratified , magnetized shear flow .",
    "turbulent penetrative convection transfers mass , momentum , energy , and magnetic fields between the convection zone and radiative interior both directly and through the generation of internal waves , particularly gravity waves , which can drive oscillatory zonal flows and large - scale circulations .",
    "instabilities driven by shear and magnetic buoyancy further influence the structure and evolution of the tachocline and likely play an important role in the solar activity cycle .",
    "understanding these various processes will require much future work beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "our objective here is to expand upon the purely hydrodynamical simulations with ash to begin to study the magnetic dynamo action that can be achieved by global - scale turbulent flows within the bulk of the solar convection zone .",
    "these studies build on the pioneering modelling that was able to resolve fairly laminar but intricate magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) convection and its dynamo action within rotating spherical shells ( e.g. , gilman & miller 1981 , gilman 1983 , glatzmaier 1987 ) .",
    "other related dynamo simulations have also considered deeper shells ( e.g. , kageyama , watanbe & sato 1995 , kageyama & sato 1997 ) .",
    "we turn now to more complex states associated with the turbulent flows that can be resolved using the ash code .",
    "much as in brun & toomre ( 2002 ) and its immediate progenitors , we will deal primarily with the bulk of the convection zone by imposing stress - free and impenetrable upper and lower boundaries to the shell , thereby ignoring the region of penetration of flows into the deeper radiative interior .",
    "thus issues concerning the tachocline are not dealt with , including the downward transport of magnetic fields ( @xmath4-effect ) into this region where strong toroidal fields may be stretched into existence .",
    "likewise the stability of these fields and the buoyant rise and emergence of flux tubes is not studied in detail , although magnetic buoyancy is allowed in our ash simulations via the anelastic approximation .",
    "rather , the simulations reported here examine the @xmath1-effect and @xmath0-effects within much of the convective interior , inspired particularly by the gilman & miller ( 1981 ) studies , but now having the ability to resolve turbulent convection and the fairly realistic differential rotation that it is able to sustain .",
    "the convection in many previous studies of dynamo action in rotating spherical shells is dominated by so - called banana cells : columnar rolls aligned with the rotation axis .",
    "these cells possess substantial helicity and generally drive a large differential rotation , thus providing all the necessary ingredients for an @xmath9 dynamo .",
    "sustained dynamo action is indeed observed for a variety of parameter regimes , but the results are generally not solar - like . the first studies by gilman & miller ( 1981 ) revealed no solutions with periodic field reversals .",
    "cyclic , dipolar dynamos were found by gilman ( 1983 ) and glatzmaier ( 1984 , 1985a , b ) for somewhat higher rayleigh numbers but the periods were significantly shorter than the solar activity cycle ( @xmath10 110 yrs ) and toroidal fields were found to propagate poleward during the course of a cycle rather than equatorward as in the sun .",
    "furthermore , these relatively low - resolution simulations could not capture the intricate structure of the fluctuating field components known to exist in the solar atmosphere .",
    "more recent simulations of mhd convection in rotating spherical shells have generally focused on parameter regimes more characteristic of the geodynamo and other planetary interiors ( e.g.  kageyama & sato 1997 ; christensen , olson & glatzmaier 1999 ; roberts & glatzmaier 2000 ; busse 2000a , b ; ishihara & kida 2002 ) .",
    "relative to the sun , convective motions in the planetary interiors are much more influenced by rotation ( lower rossby numbers ) and diffusion ( lower reynolds and magnetic reynolds numbers ) and much less influenced by compressibility ( mild density stratification ) .",
    "although such simulations have achieved higher resolution relative to gilman and glatzmaier s earlier work , they are still generally dominated by banana cells due to the strong rotational influence .",
    "they often tend to produce mean fields of a dipolar nature , although quadrupolar configurations are preferred in some parameter regimes , generally characterized by high rayleigh numbers and low magnetic prandtl numbers ( grote , busse & tilgner 1999 , 2000 ; busse 2000b ) .",
    "cyclic solutions have been found , but field reversals are more often aperiodic , particularly for high rayleigh numbers .    in this paper",
    "we report simulations of hydromagnetic dynamo action in the solar convection zone at unprecedented spatial resolution .",
    "our primary objective is to gain a better understanding of magnetic field amplification and transport by turbulent convection in the solar envelope and the essential role that such processes play in the operation of the solar dynamo . in the  2",
    "we describe our numerical model and our simulation strategy in which we introduce a small seed magnetic field into an existing hydrodynamic simulation . in  3 we discuss some properties of this hydrodynamic progenitor simulation and the exponential growth and nonlinear saturation of the seed field .",
    "we then investigate the intricate structure and evolution of the dynamo - generated fields in  4 and their back - reaction on mean flows in  5 . here",
    "we shall focus on the turbulent or fluctuating ( non - axisymmetric ) field components which are found to dominate the magnetic energy .",
    "we consider the mean ( axisymmetric ) field components separately in  6 . in  7",
    "we discuss the magnetic and kinetic helicity found in our dynamo simulations and present spectra and probability density functions for various fields .",
    "we summarize our primary results and conclusions in  8 .",
    "in this paper we report three - dimensional numerical experiments designed to investigate the complex magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) of the solar convection zone in spherical geometries .",
    "we have extended our already well - tested hydrodynamic ash code ( anelastic spherical harmonic ; see clune et al . 1999 ,",
    "miesch et al .",
    "2000 , brun & toomre 2002 ) to include the magnetic induction equation and the feedback of the field on the flow via lorentz forces and ohmic heating .",
    "thus , the ash code is now able to solve the full set of 3d mhd anelastic equations of motion in a rotating , convective spherical shell ( glatzmaier 1984 ) with high resolution on massively - parallel computing architectures .",
    "these equations are fully nonlinear in velocity and magnetic field variables , but under the anelastic approximation the thermodynamic variables are linearized with respect to a spherically symmetric and evolving mean state having a density @xmath11 , pressure @xmath12 , temperature @xmath13 and specific entropy @xmath14 .",
    "fluctuations about this mean state are denoted by @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 .",
    "the resulting equations are :    @xmath19 , \\\\ \\rb \\tb \\frac{\\p s}{\\p t}+\\rb \\tb{\\bf v}\\cdot\\nab ( \\sb+s)&=&\\nab\\cdot[\\kappa_r \\rb c_p \\nab ( \\tb+t ) + \\kappa \\rb \\tb \\nab ( \\sb+s)]\\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\frac{4\\pi\\eta}{c^2}{\\bf j}^2 + 2\\rb\\nu\\left[e_{ij}e_{ij}-1/3(\\nab\\cdot{\\bf v})^2\\right ]   + \\rb { \\epsilon},\\\\ \\frac{\\p { \\bf b}}{\\p t}&=&\\nab\\times({\\bf v}\\times{\\bf b})-\\nab\\times(\\eta\\nab\\times{\\bf b}),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath20 is the local velocity in spherical coordinates in the frame rotating at constant angular velocity @xmath21 , @xmath22 is the gravitational acceleration , @xmath23 is the magnetic field , @xmath24 is the current density , @xmath25 is the specific heat at constant pressure , @xmath26 is the radiative diffusivity , @xmath27 is the effective magnetic diffusivity , and @xmath28 is the viscous stress tensor , involving the components @xmath29,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath30 is the strain rate tensor , and @xmath31 and @xmath32 are effective eddy diffusivities .",
    "a volume heating term @xmath33 is also included in these equations for completeness but it is insignificant in the solar envelope . when our model is applied to other stars , such as a - type stars ( browning , brun & toomre 2004 ) , this term represents energy generation by nuclear burning . to complete the set of equations",
    ", we use the linearized equation of state @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the adiabatic exponent , and assume the ideal gas law @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the gas constant . the reference or",
    "mean state ( indicated by overbars ) is derived from a one - dimensional solar structure model ( brun et al .",
    "2002 ) and is continuously updated with the spherically - symmetric components of the thermodynamic fluctuations as the simulation proceeds .",
    "it begins in hydrostatic balance so the bracketed term on the right - hand - side of equation ( 3 ) initially vanishes .",
    "however , as the simulation evolves , turbulent and magnetic pressure drive the reference state slightly away from hydrostatic balance .    due to limitations in computing resources ,",
    "no simulation achievable now or in the near future can hope to directly capture all scales of solar convection from global to molecular dissipation scales .",
    "the simulations reported here resolve nonlinear interactions among a larger range of scales than any previous mhd model of global - scale solar convection but motions still must exist in the sun on scales smaller than our grid resolution . in this sense",
    ", our models should be regarded as large - eddy simulations ( les ) with parameterizations to account for subgrid - scale ( sgs ) motions .",
    "thus the effective eddy diffusivities @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath27 represent momentum , heat , and magnetic field transport by motions which are not resolved by the simulation .",
    "they are allowed to vary with radius but are independent of latitude , longitude , and time for a given simulation .",
    "their amplitudes and radial profiles are varied depending on the resolution and objectives of each simulation . in the simulations reported here , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath27",
    "are assumed to be proportional to @xmath38 . the velocity , magnetic , and thermodynamic variables are expanded in spherical harmonics @xmath39 for their horizontal structure and in chebyshev polynomials @xmath40 for their radial structure ( see appendix a ) .",
    "this approach has the advantage that the spatial resolution is uniform everywhere on a sphere when a complete set of spherical harmonics is used up to some maximum in degree @xmath41 ( retaining all azimuthal orders @xmath42 in what is known as triangular truncation ) .",
    "the anelastic approximation captures the effects of density stratification without having to resolve sound waves which would severely limit the time step . in the mhd context ,",
    "the anelastic approximation filters out fast magneto - acoustic waves but retains the alfven and slow magneto - acoustic modes . in order to ensure that the mass flux and the magnetic field remain divergenceless to machine precision throughout the simulation",
    ", we use a toroidal  poloidal decomposition as : @xmath43    appendix a lists the full set of anelastic mhd equations as solved by the numerical algorithm , involving the spherical harmonic coefficients of the streamfunctions @xmath44 and @xmath45 and the magnetic potentials @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "this system of equations requires 12 boundary conditions in order to be well - posed .",
    "since assessing the angular momentum redistribution in our simulations is one of the main goals of this work , we have opted for torque - free velocity and magnetic boundary conditions :    1 .   impenetrable top and bottom : @xmath48 , 2 .   stress free top and bottom : @xmath49 , 3 .",
    "constant entropy gradient at top and bottom : @xmath50 4 .",
    "match to an external potential magnetic field at top and bottom : @xmath51 , or impose a purely radial magnetic field at top and bottom ( match to a highly permeable external media ,",
    "jackson 1999 ) , i.e @xmath52    the main difference between having a potential or a purely radial magnetic field is that with the latter the poynting flux is zero at the shell surface , and thus there is no leakage of magnetic energy through the boundaries ( see  3.2 ) .",
    "our numerical model is a simplified portrayal of the solar convection zone : solar values are taken for the heat flux , rotation rate , mass and radius , and a perfect gas is assumed .",
    "the computational domain extends from 0.72 to 0.97 @xmath53 ( with @xmath53 the solar radius ) , thereby focusing on the bulk of the unstable zone without yet considering penetration into the radiative interior or smaller - scale convective motions near the photosphere .",
    "the depth of the convection zone is therefore @xmath54 cm and the background density varies across the shell by about a factor of 30",
    ". outward heat transport by unresolved convective motions near the surface is modeled by locally increasing the component of the subgrid - scale ( sgs ) eddy diffusivity @xmath32 which operates on the mean ( horizontally - averaged ) entropy gradient , thus allowing the simulation to achieve flux equilibrium ( see  3.2 ) .",
    "meanwhile , the influence of unresolved motions on the flow itself is taken into account through the sgs eddy diffusivities @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath27 .",
    "the magnetic simulations discussed here were all initiatiated from the same non - magnetic progenitor simulation which we refer to as case h. case h is well - evolved , with a complex convective structure and a solar - like differential rotation profile (  3.1 ) .    a small seed magnetic field",
    "is then introduced and its evolution is followed via the induction equation .",
    "the seed field is dipole in nature but soon develops a more complicated structure as it is amplified by the convective motions .",
    "if the magnetic diffusivity is sufficiently small , the field will continue to amplify until it reaches a nonlinear saturation level where production balances dissipation . in order to determine whether sustained dynamo action is achieved",
    ", the simulation must be evolved for at least several ohmic diffusion times @xmath55 ( see moffatt 1978 , jacobs 1987 ) .",
    "we have conducted three mhd simulations , cases _ m1 _ , _ m2 _ and _ m3 _ each with progressively lower values of the magnetic diffusivity ( see table 1 ) .",
    "it is currently impractical to perform dynamo calculations with a spatial resolution comparable to our most turbulent hydrodynamic cases ( @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 ) which achieve an rms reynolds number @xmath59 of over 700 .",
    "the increased workload required to solve the magnetic induction equation and the long time integrations necessary to reliably assess dynamo action can not be easily achieved with currently available computational resources . in order to achieve dynamo action in more moderately turbulent simulations such as those considered here ( @xmath60 ) ,",
    "the magnetic prandtl number @xmath61 must be greater than unity , whereas in the sun it is significantly less than unity ( based on microscopic values for @xmath31 and @xmath27 ) .",
    "this is a well known difficulty in dynamo simulations within astrophysical or geophysical contexts ( see for example christensen et al .",
    "however , the diffusivities in our simulations arise from unresolved convective motions , not microscopic processes , and the effective transport properties of such motions are thought to yield prandtl and magnetic prandtl numbers of order unity .",
    "figure 1 illustrates the convective structure and differential rotation for the hydrodynamical progenitor case h immediately prior to introducing a seed magnetic field .",
    "the radial velocity near the top of the domain is shown using a mollweide projection which displays the entire horizontal layer with minimal distortion .",
    "the circular arcs ( @xmath62 ) encompass a hemisphere and the rest of the globe is contained in the lunes on either side .",
    "the convection patterns are complex , time - dependent , and asymmetric due to the density stratification , consisting of relatively weak , broad upflows with narrow , fast downflows around their periphery .",
    "this asymmetry translates into a net downward transport of kinetic energy .",
    "the strong correlations between warm upward motions and cool downward motions are essential in transporting heat outward .",
    "there is a clear difference in the size and structure of the convective patterns at low and high latitudes .",
    "near the equator the downflow lanes tend to align with the rotation axis in the north / south direction whereas at higher latitudes ( @xmath63 ) they tend to be more isotropic and of smaller spatial extent",
    ". part of this behavior can be understood by considering the cylinder which is aligned with the rotation axis and tangent to the inner boundary .",
    "this tangent cylinder intersects the outer boundary at latitudes of about @xmath64 .",
    "it is well known that in a rotating convective shell the flow dynamics are different inside and outside of the inner tangent cylinder ( busse 1970 , busse & cuong 1977 ) .",
    "the connectivity of the flow , the influence of coriolis forces , and the distance to the rotation axis are different in the polar regions relative to the equatorial regions , leading to different convective patterns in midly turbulent simulations such as case h. at low reynolds numbers the transition between equatorial modes and polar modes occurs near the tangent cylinder .",
    "as the reynolds number is increased this transition moves to lower latitudes and becomes less apparent .",
    "for example , brun & toomre ( 2002 ) have demonstrated that increasing the level of turbulence in the simulations makes the convective patterns in the equatorial region more isotropic and extended downflow lanes become difficult to isolate within the convective network .",
    "( 5,5 )    vortical plumes are evident at the interstices of the downflow network , representing coherent structures which are surrounded by more chaotic flows .",
    "the sense of the vorticity is generally cyclonic ; counterclockwise in the northern hemisphere and clockwise in the southern hemisphere .",
    "the strongest downflow plumes extend through the entire depth of the domain .",
    "they tend to align with the rotation axis and to tilt away from the meridional plane , leading to reynolds stresses that are crucial ingredients in redistributing the angular momentum within the shell ( cf .",
    " 5 , see also miesch et al .",
    "2000 , brun & toomre 2002 ) .",
    "downflow lanes and plumes are continually advected , sheared , and distorted by differential rotation and nonlinear interactions with other flow structures .",
    "the differential rotation in case h is shown in figures 1@xmath65 and 1@xmath66 , expressed in terms of the sidereal angular velocity @xmath7 .",
    "the angular velocity of the rotating reference frame is 414 nhz , which corresponds to a rotation period of 28 days . in the contour plot ,",
    "the polar regions have been omitted due to the difficulty of forming stable averages there as a result of the small moment arm and small averaging domain .",
    "case h exhibits a differential rotation profile which is in good agreement with the solar internal rotation profile inferred from helioseismology in the bulk of the convection zone ( thompson et al.2003 ) .",
    "angular velocity contours at mid - latitudes are nearly radial and the rotation rate decreases monotonically with increasing latitude as in the sun .",
    "the latter property in particular represents an important improvement over most previous spherical convection simulations in which the latitudinal angular velocity contrast @xmath67 was confined mainly to low and mid - latitudes , namely outside of the inner tangent cylinder .",
    "the angular velocity profile in such simulations is generally sensitive to the parameters of the problem , and more solar - like profiles such as case h can be achieved by varying the reynolds and prandtl numbers in particular ( elliott , miesch & toomre 2000 ; brun & toomre 2002 ) .",
    "the differential rotation contrast between the equator and latitudes of @xmath68 in case h is 140 nhz ( or 34% relative to the frame of reference ) , somewhat larger than the 92 nhz ( or 22% ) variation implied by helioseismology .",
    "the rotation profile of case h exhibits some asymmetry with respect to the equator , particularly at high latitudes ( fig .",
    "1@xmath65 ) , although such asymmetries are expected to diminish over a longer temporal average .",
    "since the convection itself is generally asymmetric , it is not surprising that the mean flows driven by the convection are as well .",
    "mean - field models of the solar differential rotation have advocated that a thermal wind balance ( involving latitudinal temperature gradients ) may be the cause of the non - cylindrical angular velocity profile ( kichatinov & rdiger 1995 , durney 1999 ) .",
    "this may come about if baroclinic convective motions produce latitudinal heat flux , leading to a breakdown of the taylor - proudman theorem ( pedlosky 1987 ) .",
    "a pole - equator temperature contrast of few degrees k is compatible with a @xmath69 of @xmath70 .",
    "although it is indeed true that case h exhibits latitudinal entropy and temperature gradients , these are not the dominant players in driving the differential rotation throughout the shell . rather , we find that the reynolds stresses are the main agents responsible for maintaining the rotation profiles in our simulations ( see  5 ) .",
    "we now consider the dynamo possibilities that such intricate convective patterns and large differential rotation can lead to .",
    "as stated earlier , we have introduced a seed magnetic poloidal field into our hydrodynamical case h for three different values of the magnetic diffusivity @xmath27 , corresponding to cases _ m1 _ , _ m2 _ and _ m3 _ ( table 1 ) . figure 2 shows the magnetic and kinetic energy evolution for these three cases .",
    "we note that over more than 4000 days ( corresponding to several ohmic decay times , cf .",
    "table 1 ) the two least diffusive cases _ m2 _ and _ m3 _ achieve a sustained magnetic energy ( me ) , the amplitude of which depends on @xmath27 . the initial exponential growth of me in case _ m3",
    "_ lasts for about 600 days , after which the nonlinear feedback of the lorentz forces on the flow begins to saturate the dynamo . for case",
    "m2 _ which has a slower growth rate , another linear phase seems to last for at least 4000 days and it is unclear whether it has truly saturated . by contrast ,",
    "m1 _ is clearly decaying , since the rate of generation of magnetic fields in the entire shell volume ( @xmath71 dv$ ] ) can not compensate for the rate of destruction by ohmic diffusion ( @xmath72 ) .",
    "interpolating between cases _ m1 _ and _ m2 _ to find the zero growth rate yields a critical magnetic diffusivity at mid depth @xmath73 cm s@xmath74 .",
    "in terms of the magnetic reynolds number ( see table 1 ) , we find that @xmath75 must be at least @xmath76 for sustained dynamo action to occur .",
    "this value of @xmath75 is about 25% larger than in the incompressible simulations of gilman ( 1983 ) which consider a simpler configuration .",
    "( 5,7 )    upon saturation , the kinetic energy ( ke ) in model _",
    "m3 _ has been reduced by about 40% compared to its initial value , say ke@xmath77 , given by case h ( see table 2 ) .",
    "this change is mostly due to a reduction of the energy contained in the differential rotation ( drke ) which drops by over 50% .",
    "by contrast , the energy contained in the convective motions ( cke ) only decreases by about 27% , which implies an increased contribution of the non - axisymmetric motions to the total kinetic energy balance . for case _ m3 _",
    ", the decrease in ke first becomes apparent after about 600 days of evolution , when the me reaches roughly 0.5% of ke@xmath77 .",
    "after 1200 days , the me reaches a value of about 8% of the ke and retains that level for more than 3 ohmic decay times @xmath78 .",
    "the me in case _ m2 _ is still too small ( @xmath79 ) even after 4000 days for lorentz forces to have a significant influence on the convective motions , as demonstrated by comparing the kinetic energy evolution in cases _ m2 _ and _",
    "m3_.    it is instructive to briefly consider the exchange of energy among different reservoirs in our simulations .",
    "we refer to starr & gilman ( 1966 ) for a more detailed discussion of energy exchange in an mhd system .",
    "we first note that both the total kinetic and magnetic energies remain small compared to the total potential , internal and rotational energies contained in the shell .",
    "further , the magnetic energy must arise from the conversion of kinetic energy but this does not necessarily lead to a decrease in the total kinetic energy because the motions may draw upon other reservoirs .",
    "yet , in all of our magnetic simulations , energy is redistributed such that the sum of the kinetic and magnetic energy is less than the total kinetic energy contained in case h. the net energy deficit can be attributed primarily to the reduction in strength of the differential rotation by maxwell stresses .",
    "this means that in a convection zone the way the energy is redistributed among and within the different reservoirs is modified by the presence of magnetic field , but these modifications remain small in the cases presented here .",
    "we refer to cattaneo , emonet & weiss ( 2002 ) for a detailed study of the influence of an imposed magnetic field on boussinesq convection .",
    "( 5,5.4 )    to further investigate the role played by the different agents in transporting energy , we illustrate in figure 3 the contribution of various physical processes to the total radial energy flux through the shell , converted to luminosity and normalized to the solar luminosity .",
    "the net luminosity , @xmath80 , and its components are defined as :    @xmath81    with @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the electric current , @xmath84 the enthapy flux , @xmath85 the kinetic energy flux , @xmath86 the radiative flux , @xmath87 the unresolved eddy flux , @xmath88 the viscous flux and @xmath89 the poynting flux . the unresolved eddy flux @xmath87 is the heat flux due to subgrid - scale motions which , in our les - sgs approach takes the form of a thermal diffusion operating on the mean entropy gradient . its main purpose is to transport energy outward through the impenetrable upper boundary where the convective fluxes @xmath84 and @xmath85 vanish and the remaining fluxes are small . it should not be mistaken with @xmath86 , which is the flux due to radiative diffusion and which operates on the mean temperature gradient .",
    "the radiative diffusivity , @xmath26 is derived from a one - dimensional solar structure model ( brun et al 2002 ) , whereas the eddy diffusivity @xmath32 is chosen to model the effects of small - scale motions and to ensure that the flow is well resolved .",
    "there is an additional energy flux , @xmath88 , which arises from the subgrid - scale eddy viscosity , @xmath31 .",
    "if the simulation were in a thermally - relaxed state , the total flux through each horizontal surface would be constant and equal to the solar luminosity which is applied at the upper and lower boundaries : @xmath90 .",
    "figure 3 indicates that the normalized net flux @xmath91 ( solid line ) is indeed close to unity , implying that the simulation is close to thermal equilibrium .",
    "the enthalpy flux here carries up to 90% of the solar luminosity in the bulk of the convective zone and @xmath86 and @xmath87 carry the energy at respectively the bottom and top of the domain where @xmath84 vanishes .",
    "the remaining fluxes @xmath85 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 are relatively small and negative in most of the domain .",
    "the downward direction of the kinetic energy flux is due to the asymmetry between the fast downflow lanes and the slower broad upflows .",
    "this downward flux carries about 10% of the solar luminosity and possess a bigger amplitude than either @xmath88 or @xmath89 .",
    "the low amplitude of @xmath88 confirms that in our simulations inertia dominates over viscous effects , i.e.  the reynolds number in all cases is much greater than unity .",
    "similarly , the low amplitude of the poynting flux confirms that magnetic processes in case _",
    "m3 _ do play a role in the overall energy transport but not to the point of significantly modifying the flux balance established in the non - magnetic progentitor case h. the volume integrated @xmath92 is about 10% of @xmath93 ; it would likely require a much higher level of magnetism in order for the poynting flux to have a substantial influence on the net energy transport .    the poynting flux @xmath89 is also influenced by our choice of magnetic boundary conditions . in all the magnetic cases presented here",
    "we match the computed field to an internal and external potential field at every time step .",
    "this leads to a non - zero electromagnetic flux through the boundaries .",
    "we have investigated the impact of such magnetic energy `` leakage '' on the dynamo action by computing one case in which the magnetic field was required to be purely radial at the boundaries , yielding no net poynting flux through the shell ( @xmath94 at the top and bottom boundaries ) . the effect of closed as opposed to open boundary conditions seems to be that in the former the magnetic energy amplification is more efficient , with potentially a lower dynamo threshold .",
    "but since in the solar case such magnetic energy `` leakage '' exists both at the bottom via for example turbulent pumping ( tobias et al .",
    "2001 ) and at the photosphere via for example magnetic eruptions , we consider that our choice of boundary conditions is reasonable for the solar dynamo problem .",
    "we further believe that open magnetic boundary conditions play a central role in regulating the magnetic dynamo action in the convection zone , by providing an outlet for the magnetic energy and also most likely for the magnetic helicity .",
    "the structure of the convection in simulation _",
    "m3 _ is illustrated in figure 4 .",
    "the convective patterns are qualitatively similar to the hydrodynamic case h , which can be seen by comparing the radial velocity field in the upper left frame of figure 4 to that shown in figure 1 . cases _ m1 _ and _ m2 _ also exhibit similiar patterns because the magnetic fields in these simulations never grow strong enough to exert a substantial influence on the global flow structure . however , lorentz forces in localized regions of case",
    "_ m3 _ do have a noticable dynamical effect , particularly with regard to the evolution of strong downflow lanes where magnetic tension forces can inhibit vorticity generation .",
    "( 5,9 )    the horizontal structure of the radial and longitudinal magnetic field is also shown in figure 4 .",
    "many of the main features are qualitatively similar to simulations of turbulent , compressible magnetoconvection in cartesian geometries ( cattaneo 1999 ; stein & nordlund 2000 ; tobias et al .",
    "the magnetic field generally has a finer and more intricate structure than the velocity field due to the smaller diffusion ( @xmath95 in this simulation ) and also due to the nature of the advection terms in the induction equation , which are similar in form to those in the vorticity equation ( e.g.  biskamp 1993 ) .",
    "near the top of the shell , the radial magnetic field @xmath96 is mainly concentrated in the downflow lanes , where both polarities coexist in close proximity . by contrast , the toroidal field @xmath97 near the surface appears more distributed and more patchy , characterized by relatively broad regions of uniform polarity , particularly near the equator .",
    "the magnetic field topology generally does not exhibit any clear symmetries about the equator , although some of the @xmath97 patches at low latitudes do have an antisymmetric counterpart .    in the middle of the shell",
    "the magnetic fluctuations appear of smaller - scale and more distributed but they are still very intermittent . strong vertical fields of mixed polarity still correlate well with downflow lanes and plumes .",
    "the longitudinal field is more filamentary and is organized in longitudinally - elongated structures , having been stretched by the gradients in angular velocity ( see also  4.2 ) .",
    "( 5,5 )    throughout the shell , the magnetic field patterns evolve rapidly , as fields are continuously transported , distorted , and amplified by convective motions .",
    "of particular importance near the top of the shell are the horizontal flows , shown in figure 5 for case _ m3_. regions of convergence and divergence are apparent , as are swirling vortices which occur most frequently at high and mid - latitudes and generally have a cyclonic sense ( counter - clockwise in the northern hemisphere and clockwise in the southern ) .",
    "such flows stretch the horizontal field and sweep the vertical field into vortical downflow lanes where it is twisted , thus generating magnetic helicity .",
    "horizontally - converging flows also squeeze together fields of mixed polarity , driving magnetic reconnection .",
    "the convective patterns visible in the vertical velocity field of figure 4 are also evident in the horizontal velocity patterns of figure 5 , particularly the dichotomy between low - latitudes which are dominated by extended downflow lanes oriented north - south ( visible here as lines of horizontal convergence ) and higher latitudes which possess a smaller - scale , more isotropic downflow network .",
    "if they exist in the sun , such large - scale convective patterns may ultimately be detectable in similar horizontal flow maps inferred from local - domain helioseismic analyses using time - distance and ring - diagram procedures ( e.g.  haber et al .  2002 ; hindman et al .",
    "however , currently such helioseismic flow maps are limited to the upper few percent of the solar envelope , monitoring what is called solar sub - surface weather ( ssw ; toomre 2002 ) .",
    "this lies outside the computational domain considered here .",
    "( 5,15 )    the dynamical richness and rapid time evolution of the flow and magnetic field patterns are highlighted in figure 6 .",
    "the radial magnetic field , the radial velocity field , and the horizontal flow all exhibit an intricate structure which evolves substantially on time scales of weeks and even days .",
    "low - latitude features tend to drift eastward relative to higher - latitude features due to advection by the differential rotation and also due to inherent pattern propagation relative to the local rotation rate . at the tracking rate used in figure 6",
    ", this leads generally to a rightward movement of patterns near the equator and a leftward movement of patterns near the southern edge of the region shown ( latitude -60@xmath98 ) . in between , particularly at a latitude of about @xmath99 , the distinctive patterns at low and high latitudes meet , giving rise to a particularly complex dynamical evolution .",
    "the north - south aligned downflow lanes at low latitudes temporarily link to the high - latitude network as they drift by , and features caught in this interaction region are rapidly sheared and distorted , forming filaments and vortices which then mix and merge with other structures .",
    "figure 6 highlights the evolution of several features in particular , indicated by letters .",
    "the first of these , a , is a multi - polar region which appears to represent several flux tubes passing through the horizontal plane being visualized .",
    "after they form , these localized features are rapidly sheared by convective motions , distorting and separating into flux sheets which then merge with other features and lose their identity over the course of about two weeks .",
    "feature b begins as a flux sheet confined to a north - south oriented downflow lane where the polarity of the field is radially inward . by the second frame ,",
    "flux of the opposite polarity ( radially outward , indicated by white ) is advected into the downflow lane where it is then wrapped up by the cyclonic vorticity and rapidly dissipated as it reconnects with the existing field .",
    "similar dynamics are also occurring in feature c which illustrates the merging of two flux sheets of opposite polarity in a downflow lane ( particularly evident in the rightmost frame ) .",
    "the lower portion of the outward - polarity sheet ( white ) extends into the interface region at latitude -25@xmath98 , where extended low - latitude downflow lanes merge with the high - latitude network .",
    "the intense vorticity and shear in this region twist and stretch the field , dramatically changing its appearance on a time scale of several days .",
    "the most intense downflow plumes often possess enough vorticity to evacuate the core of the plume due to centrifugal forces , and buoyancy forces acting on the resulting decrease in density lead to a flow reversal , creating a new upflow region which then diverges horizontally due to the density stratification ( brandenburg et al .",
    "1996 , brummell et al .",
    "1998 , miesch et al . 2000 ) .",
    "such dynamics are occurring in feature d of figure 6 , now in the presence of a magnetic field . by the second frame ,",
    "a new upflow is created in this manner ( middle panels ) which rapidly expands horizontally and interacts with the surrounding flow .",
    "there is a vertical flux tube present in the original downflow but it is rapidly dispersed as the flow reverses , losing all coherence by the fourth frame .",
    "feature e is another example of how field can be wrapped up by the vorticity in downflow lanes , particularly at high and mid - latitudes where the rotation vector has a large vertical component .",
    "( 5,13.5 )    horizontal cross sections as in figures 46 are informative but they provide limited insight into the three - dimensional structure of the flow and of the magnetic field in particular .",
    "further insight requires volume visualizations as shown in figure 7 .",
    "the toroidal and radial magnetic fields in figures 7@xmath100 and 7@xmath66 have a very different appearance , consistent with the contrast noted previously in figure 4 .",
    "whereas @xmath96 is concentrated into vertically - oriented sheets and filaments , @xmath97 is organized into relatively broad ribbons and tubes which extend mainly in longitude .",
    "figure 7@xmath65 further demonstrates the ribbon - like topology of the toroidal field , showing in particular that the low - latitude horizontal patches near the surface have a relatively small vertical extent , although some meander in radius .",
    "substantial magnetic helicity is present throughout , involving complex winding of the toroidal field structures along their length .",
    "some features resemble magnetic flux tubes but they generally do not remain coherent long enough for magnetic buoyancy forces to induce them to rise .    whereas some toroidal field structures maintain coherence over global scales , the radial field is generally dominated by smaller - scale fluctuations . in particular , radial field structures near the top of the domain rarely penetrate deep into the convection zone , although individual field lines maintain some connectivity throughout the shell .",
    "this connectivity also extends outside of the computational domain because of the boundary conditions which match the interior field to an external potential field .",
    "the structure of this potential field above the outer surface is illustrated in figure 7_d_. the extrapolation shown in the figure treats the radial field near the top of the domain as a source surface and requires that the field be radial at 2.5 @xmath53 , although field lines are only shown out to a radius of 1.5 @xmath53 .",
    "as in the sun , the surface magnetic field is complex , featuring bipolar regions , nested loops , and an intricate web of connectivity between both local and widely separated regions on the surface .",
    "although some large loops span both hemispheres , dipolar or quadrupolar components are not evident and open field is not confined to or even preferred in the polar regions .",
    "axisymmetric field components are indeed present ( see  6 ) , but the field morphology near the surface and throughout the shell is dominated by smaller - scale turbulent structures .",
    "the magnetic energy in the potential field extrapolation decreases rapidly with increasing radius , as spherical harmonic components decay in proportion to @xmath101 .",
    "a less dramatic outward gradient of magnetic energy also occurs within the computational domain as demonstrated in figure 8 . here",
    "we display the radial profile of the total magnetic energy density integrated over the horizontal dimensions after having broken it down into mean ( axisymmetric ) and fluctuating ( non - axisymmetric ) poloidal and toroidal components in the following manner : @xmath102 where the brackets @xmath103 denote a longitudinal average .",
    "the magnetic energy generally peaks toward the bottom of the shell for both the mean and fluctuating field components .",
    "this is due in part to the spherical divergence and the density stratification .",
    "downward pumping of magnetic fields by convective motions also plays a role but the pumping is not as effective as in penetrative convection simulations where the underlying stable region provides a reservoir where field can be accumulated and stored ( cf .",
    "tobias et al .  2001 ) .    ( 5,6 )    figure 8 also shows that the magnetic energy contained in the mean - field components is more than an order of magnitude smaller than that contained in the non - axisymmetric fluctuations .",
    "most of the mean - field energy is in the toroidal field , which exceeds the energy in the poloidal field by about a factor of three due to the stretching and amplification of toroidal field by differential rotation ( the @xmath0-effect ) .",
    "this ratio is smaller than in the sun , where the mean toroidal field is estimated to be about two orders of magnitude more energetic than the mean poloidal field .",
    "this discrepancy can again be attributed to the absence of an overshoot region and a tachocline , where toroidal field can be stored for extended periods while it is amplified by relatively large angular velocity gradients ( see  6 ) . for the non - axisymmetric fluctuations ,",
    "the magnetic energy is approximately equally distributed among the toroidal and poloidal fields , indicating that the turbulent convection can efficiently generate both components in roughly equal measure , implying that the @xmath0-effect plays a lesser role .",
    "surface measurements and helioseismic inferences of large - scale , axisymmetric , time - averaged flows in the sun currently provide the most important observational constraints on global - scale models of solar convection .",
    "the structure , evolution , and maintenance of mean flows ( averaged over longitude and time ) has therefore been a primary focus of previous global convection simulations ( glatzmaier 1987 ; miesch et al .",
    "2000 ; elliott , miesch & toomre 2000 ; brun & toomre 2002 ) . of particular importance is the mean longitudinal flow , i.e.the differential rotation , which is now reasonably well established from helioseismic inversions , although investigations continue to scrutinize its detailed spatial structure and temporal evolution ( thompson et al . 2003 ) .",
    "the mean circulation in the meridional plane has only been probed reliably in the surface layers of the sun through doppler measurements ( hathaway et al .",
    "1996 ) and local - area helioseismology ( e.g.  haber et al .",
    "2002 ) . here",
    "we discuss the mean flows achieved in our simulations and compare them with solar observations and previous numerical models .      with fairly strong magnetic fields sustained within the bulk of the convection zone in case _ m3 _ , it is to be expected that the differential rotation @xmath7 will respond to the feedback from the lorentz forces .",
    "figure 9 ( left panel ) shows the time - averaged angular velocity achieved in case _ m3 _ , which exhibits a prograde equatorial rotation with a monotonic decrease in angular velocity toward higher latitudes as in the sun .",
    "the main effect of the lorentz forces is to extract energy from the differential rotation .",
    "the kinetic energy contained in the differential rotation drops by a factor of two after the addition of magnetic fields and this decrease accounts for over 70% of the total kinetic energy difference ( cf .",
    "this is reflected by a 30% decrease in the angular velocity contrast @xmath67 between the equator and latitudes of @xmath68 , going from 140 nhz ( or 34% compared to the reference frame @xmath104 ) in the hydrodynamic case h to 100 nhz ( or 24% ) in case _ m3_.",
    "this value is close to the contrast of 22% inferred from helioseismic inversion of the solar profile ( thompson et al .",
    "thus the convection is still able to maintain an almost solar - like angular velocity contrast despite the inhibiting influence of lorentz forces .    eddy et al .",
    "( 1976 ) have deduced from a careful study of solar activity records during the maunder minima that the sun was rotating about 34% faster in the equatorial region during that period than it does at present and that the angular velocity contrast between the equator and latitudes of @xmath105 may have been as much as a factor of three larger . the somewhat faster rotation rate and larger @xmath106 in case h ( and _ m2 _ ) relative to case _",
    "m3 _ further suggests that a reduced level of the sun s magnetism may lead to greater differential rotation ( brun 2004 ) .",
    "( 5,6.4 )    in figure 9@xmath66 we display the meridional circulation realized in case _ m3_. this meridional circulation is maintained by buoyancy forces , reynolds stresses , pressure gradients , maxwell stresses , and coriolis forces acting on the differential rotation .",
    "since these relatively large forces nearly cancel one another , the circulation can be thought as a small departure from ( magneto)-geostrophic balance , and the presence of a magnetic field can clearly influence its subtle maintenance . in case _ m3 _",
    ", the meridional circulation exhibits a multi - cell structure both in latitude and radius , and possesses some asymmetry with respect to the equator . in particular , two vertical cells",
    "are present at low latitudes in the northern hemisphere whereas only one is present in the southern hemisphere . since the convection possesses some asymmetry ( cf .",
    "4 ) it is not surprising that the meridional circulation does the same .    given the competing processes for its origin , this weak flow is not straightforward to predict .",
    "typical amplitudes for the velocity are of order 25 m s@xmath107 , comparable to local helioseismic deductions ( haber et al .",
    "the flow near the outer boundary is directed poleward at low latitudes , with return flow deeper down .",
    "the temporal fluctuations in the meridional circulation are large and thus stable time averages are only attained by frequent sampling over many rotation periods .",
    "the kinetic energy contained in the meridional circulation ( mcke ) is about two orders of magnitude smaller than that contained in the differential rotation and convective motions and is more than an order of magnitude less than the total magnetic energy ( me ; see table 2 ) . as a result ,",
    "small fluctuations in the convective motions , differential rotation and lorentz forces can lead to major variations in the circulation .",
    "some of the helioseismic inferences suggest the presence of single cell circulations which are at odds with our multi - cell patterns . however , these inferences vary from year to year and there is recent evidence that multiple - cell structure and equatorial asymmetries are developing in the meridional circulation patterns just below the photosphere as the current solar cycle advances ( haber et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "we can better understand how the differential rotation profile in case _",
    "m3 _ is achieved by identifying the main physical processes responsible for redistributing angular momentum within our rotating convective shells .",
    "our choice of stress - free and potential - field boundary conditions at the top and bottom of the computational domain have the advantage that no net external torque is applied , and thus angular momentum is conserved .",
    "we may assess the transport of angular momentum within these systems by considering the mean radial ( @xmath108 ) and latitudinal ( @xmath109 ) angular momentum fluxes , extending the procedure used in brun & toomre ( 2002 ) to the magnetic context ( see also elliott , miesch & toomre 2000 ) .",
    "let us consider the @xmath110-component of the momentum equation expressed in conservative form and averaged in time and longitude :    @xmath111    involving the mean radial angular momentum flux @xmath112\\ ] ] and the mean latitudinal angular momentum flux @xmath113.\\ ] ]    in the above expressions for both fluxes , the terms on the right - hand - side denote contributions respectively from viscous diffusion ( which we denote as @xmath114 and @xmath115 ) , reynolds stresses ( @xmath116 and @xmath117 ) , meridional circulation ( @xmath118 and @xmath119 ) , maxwell stresses ( @xmath120 and @xmath121 ) and large - scale magnetic torques ( @xmath122 and @xmath123 ) .",
    "the reynolds stresses are associated with correlations of the fluctuating velocity components which arise from organized tilts within the convective structures , especially in the downflow plumes ( e.g. brummell et al .",
    "1998 , miesch et al .",
    "2000 ) . in the same spirit",
    "the maxwell stresses are associated with correlations of the fluctuating magnetic field components which arise from tilt and twist within the magnetic structures .",
    "( 5,6.8 )    in figure 10 we show the components of @xmath108 and @xmath109 for cases _ m3 _ , having integrated over co - latitude and radius as follows : @xmath124 thus @xmath125 represents the net angular momentum flux through horizontal shells at different radii and @xmath126 represents the net flux through cones at different latitudes .",
    "we then identify in turn the contributions from viscous diffusion ( vd ) , reynolds stresses ( rs ) , meridional circulation ( mc ) , maxwell stresses ( ms ) and large scale magnetic torques ( mt ) .",
    "this representation is helpful in assessing the sense and amplitude of angular momentum transport within the convective shells by each component of @xmath108 and @xmath109 .    turning first to figure 10@xmath100",
    ", we see that the radial differential rotation is being maintained by reynolds stresses and meridional circulation , @xmath127 and @xmath128 , which both transport angular momentum radially outward .",
    "this outward transport is opposed by the viscous flux @xmath129 , which is radially inward as implied by the positive radial angular velocity gradient seen in figure 9@xmath65 .",
    "the maxwell stresses @xmath130 also act to oppose the generation of differential rotation by the convection , possessing the same sign and amplitude as the viscous torque .",
    "the large - scale magnetic torques are very small but negative as well , helping to decelerate the surface and speed up the bottom of the shell .",
    "the net radial flux @xmath125 , represented by the solid curve , is nearly zero , indicating that the flow has achieved an approximate statistical equilibrium and that our sampling in time captures this equilibrated state reasonably well , despite the large temporal variations typically present in our simulations .    the latitudinal angular momentum flux @xmath131 exhibits a more complicated interplay among its various components than @xmath125 , as demonstrated in figure 10@xmath65 .",
    "here the angular momentum transport is dominated by reynolds stresses @xmath132 which are consistently directed toward the equator ( i.e. negative in the southern hemisphere and positive in the northern hemisphere ) .",
    "this feature implies that the equatorial acceleration observed in our simulations is mainly due to the transport of angular momentum by the reynolds stresses .",
    "further , unlike the radial angular momentum balance , we see that the transport by meridional circulation @xmath133 is opposite to @xmath134 , with the meridional circulation seeking to slow down the equator and speed up the poles .",
    "the viscous torque @xmath135 is in the same direction but is a factor of four smaller in amplitude .",
    "these results are identical to that deduced from case h ( much as in brun & toomre 2002 ) .",
    "the main difference in case _",
    "m3 _ comes from the maxwell stress component @xmath136 , which opposes the reynolds stresses as in the radial angular momentum balance .",
    "the large - scale magnetic torque @xmath137 is again found to be negligible .",
    "the total flux @xmath131 vacillates around zero , indicating no net latitudinal angular momentum transport and an acceptable equilibrated solution .",
    "the reduction in the latitudinal contrast of @xmath7 between cases h and _ m3 _ can be partially attributed to a global decrease in the kinetic energy of the convection ( see table 2 ) . the rms reynolds number of case _",
    "m3 _ is about 12% less than in case h , reflecting the stablizing influence of magnetic fields .",
    "however , the convection kinetic energy is only reduced by about 27% whereas the differential rotation kinetic energy is reduced by over 50% .",
    "figure 10 indicates that this large decrease in drke is due to the poleward transport of angular momentum by maxwell stresses . in case _",
    "m3 _ the reynolds stresses must balance the angular momentum transport by the meridional circulation , the viscous diffusion , and the maxwell stresses , which leads to a less efficient acceleration of the equatorial regions . since the magnetic energy is only about 7% of the kinetic energy in case _ m3 _",
    "table 2 ) , the maxwell stresses are not the main players in redistributing the angular momentum , but they do contribute more than the viscous torque @xmath135 in the latitudinal balance . if the magnetic energy were to exceed about 20% of the total kinetic energy , maxwell stresses and magnetic torques may become strong enough to suppress the differential rotation almost entirely ( gilman 1983 ; brun 2004 ) . the sun may have ways of avoiding this by expelling some of its magnetic flux .",
    "we emphasize that the suppression of vertical and latitudinal differential rotation by lorentz forces in our simulations is dominated by the fluctuating magnetic field components @xmath138 , not the mean field components @xmath139 .",
    "magnetic tension forces associated with the mean poloidal field do tend to inhibit rotational shear as in axisymmetric models ( macgregor & charbonneau 1999 ) , but this intuitive `` rubber band '' effect is far less efficient than the more subtle maxwell stresses induced by correlations among the turbulent magnetic field components .",
    "brun & toomre ( 2002 ) have found that as the level of turbulence is increased , @xmath140 reduces in amplitude and the transport of angular momentum by the reynolds stresses @xmath141 and by the meridional circulation @xmath142 change accordingly to maintain equilibrium . here",
    "the presence of a fourth agent , namely the maxwell stresses , can modify this force balance and thus alter the equilibrium rotation profile .",
    "an important feature of the rotation profile in case h and also in case @xmath143 of brun & toomre ( 2002 ) is a monotonic decrease in angular velocity with increasing latitude which persists all the way to the polar regions .",
    "this relatively slow polar rotation is supported by helioseismic inversions but is generally difficult to achieve in numerical simulations of convection because regions close to the rotation axis undergo a prograde acceleration if fluid parcels tend to conserve their angular momentum .",
    "thus , it is promising to see that case _ m3 _ has retained relatively slow rotation at high latitudes even in the presence of magnetic fields .",
    "figure 10@xmath65 indicates that the the prograde equatorial rotation seen in case _",
    "m3 _ is due to equatorward angular momentum transport by reynolds stresses and that the meridional circulation tends to oppose this transport . in many previous simulations , the poleward angular momentum transport by the meridional circulation extends to higher latitudes , tending to spin up the poles .",
    "thus the slow polar rotation in case _",
    "m3 _ and its hydrodynamic predecessors , cases h and @xmath143 , seems to come about from a relatively weak meridional circulation at high latitudes ( see also brun & toomre 2002 ) .",
    "the absence of strong high - latitude circulation cells permits a more efficient extraction of angular momentum by the reynolds stresses from the polar regions toward the equator , yielding the interesting differential rotation profile that is achieved . since the maxwell stresses also transport angular momentum toward the poles , the polar regions in case _",
    "m3 _ are found to rotate slightly faster than in case h. however , the angular momentum transport by maxwell stresses is distributed such that the global rotation retains the attribute of a monotonic decrease of @xmath7 with latitude .",
    "it is clear from the results presented ( see e.g.figs . 4 , 7 , 8 , and 10 ) that the magnetic field is dominated by the fluctuating or turbulent ( non - axisymmetric ) component . however , the mean ( axisymmetric ) field components have particular significance with regard to solar dynamo theory , and thus it is instructive to explore their structure and evolution in detail . in particular , we wish to understand our simulation results in the context of solar observations although we are aware that we are still missing important `` dynamo building blocks '' ( c.f .  1.1 ) such as magnetic pumping into a tachocline - like shear layer .",
    "our results provide fundamental insight into the generation of mean magnetic fields by turbulent convection and as such can be used to evaluate and improve mean - field dynamo models which do not explicitly consider the turbulent field and flow components ( e.g.  krause & rdler 1980 , ossendrijver 2003 ) . in",
    "what follows , we define the mean poloidal field in terms of the longitudinally - averaged radial and latitudinal components , @xmath144 , and the mean toroidal field in terms of the longitudinally - averaged longitudinal component @xmath145 .",

    "mean poloidal fields are generated from fluctuating toroidal fields via the @xmath1-effect .",
    "the @xmath1-effect arises from correlations between turbulent flows and fields as expressed in the mean ( longitudinally - averaged ) induction equation by the term @xmath146 , where primes indicate that the axisymmetric component has been subtracted off and angular brackets indicate a longitudinal average ( moffatt 1978 , stix 2002 , brandenburg & subramanian 2004 ) .",
    "we find that the fluctuating fields in our simulations are much stronger than the mean fields , accounting for up to 98% of the total magnetic energy , and the scale and amplitude of their correlations are not small in any sense and therefore can not be reliably parameterized in terms of the mean field .",
    "it appears that the generation of mean fields in our simulations is not due to the @xmath1-effect in the traditional sense , but rather to a more complex interplay between turbulent magnetic field and flow components .",
    "the chaotic nature of these turbulent components gives rise to intricate structure and aperiodic evolution in the mean fields .",

    "the evolution of the poloidal magnetic field from an antisymmetric to a symmetric profile with respect to the equator is made possible because of the nonlinear and asymmetric nature of the convection which amplifies the field through dynamo action .",
    "the continous exchange between dipolar and quadrupolar topologies as well as higher - order multipoles results in magnetic fields with intricate configurations and with no clear equatorial symmetry preferences . within the convective shell the presence of strong magnetic field gradients and magnetic diffusion lead to continous reconnection of the magnetic field lines .",
    "( 5,9 )    the perpetual regeneration of magnetic flux by the convection can lead to a global reversal of the magnetic field polarity .",

    "this is a measure of the total magnetic flux which passes through the northern hemisphere at the outer surface of the shell , and since @xmath149 outside as well as inside the domain , the same flux of opposite polarity must also pass through the southern hemisphere .",
    "a positive value indicates that the field is outward on average in the northern hemisphere , as in the dipolar initial conditions .",
    "by contrast , a negative value indicates the average polarity is opposite to that imposed in the initial conditions .",
    "the flat evolution over the first 800 days corresponds to the linear growth phase of the magnetic energy , where the field evolves slowly away from its imposed initial dipolar topology and north - south orientation . as the fields with negative polarity gain in strength , a complex competition between the two polarities , directly related to the turbulent nature of the dynamo , leads to a chaotic and irregular variation of the average polarity .",
    "several field reversals do occur on a time scale of about 500 days , but there is little evidence for systematic cyclic behavior .",
    "this time scale is comparable to the 1.5-year periods found by gilman ( 1983 ) in some of his boussinesq dynamo simulations .",

    "however , the chaotic short - term evolution suggests that longer - term periodic behavior is unlikely for the configuration that we have adopted here .",
    "our high resolution simulations confirm that the time scale for field reversal within the convective envelope itself is too short and that without a stable layer such as the solar tachocline such simulations are unlikely to reproduce the global - scale dynamo and 22-year activity cycle observed in the sun .",

    "this is in contrast with solar observations which reveal regular trends in the emergence of sunspots and related magnetic flux over the 22-year activity cycle .",

    "this result suggests that strong axisymmetric toroidal fields are generated mainly in the stable layer via the @xmath0-effect and strengthens the current paradigm that convection in the solar envelope can not amplify the mean toroidal field to observed levels without the presence of convective penetration into a stably - stratified shear layer such as the solar tachocline .",

    "the relatively weak toroidal fields in our simulations can likely be attributed to the absence of a tachocline where toroidal flux can be efficiently stored and amplified by strong rotational shear .",

    "<S> the operation of the solar global dynamo appears to involve many dynamical elements , including the generation of fields by the intense turbulence of the deep convection zone , the transport of these fields into the tachocline region near the base of the convection zone , the storage and amplification of toroidal fields in the tachocline by differential rotation , and the destablization and emergence of such fields due to magnetic buoyancy . </S>",
