    "in 1984 , bennett and brassard @xcite proposed a revolutionary concept that _ key distribution _ may be accomplished through public communications in quantum channels .",
    "hopefully , the privacy of the resulted key is to be guaranteed by quantum physical laws alone , quite independent of how much computational resource is available to the adversary .",
    "the primary quantum phase of the proposed protocol is a sequence of single photons produced by alice ( the sender ) and detected by bob ( the receiver ) .",
    "the security proof of the bb84-protocol ( or its many variants ) for adversaries with unrestricted power is a difficult mathematical problem , and has only been achieved with any generality in the last few years . in brief , the bb84-protocol is secure even with channel noise and possible detector faults for bob , provided that the apparatus used by alice to produce the photons is perfect .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to remove this last assumption , by proposing and giving a concrete design for a new concept , _ self - checking source _ , which requires the manufacturer of the photon source to provide certain tests ; these tests are designed such that , if passed , the source is guaranteed to be adequate for the security of the bb84-protocol , even though the testing devices may not be built to the original specification . a self - checking source must receive inputs from multiple locations ( two in our case ) and returns classical outcomes at these locations .",
    "the test needs only to consider the classical inputs and the classical outcomes .",
    "it is well known that there are clever ways to construct imperfect sources for the coding used in the bb84-protocol that behave quite normal on the surface , but seriously compromise the security . in other words ,",
    "the bb84 coding together with the standard test executed in the bb84-protcol are problematic because the external data can be reproduced by quantum apparatus which are not secure at all .",
    "we propose a different source that is self - checking and yet can be used to generate the bb84 coding .",
    "our result means that one does not have to perform an infinite number of ways to check all possible devious constructions . in some ways",
    "our test can be regarded as simple self - testing quantum programs .",
    "our result requires that , when the inputs to the source are fixed , the distribution of probability for the classical outcomes is also fixed .",
    "our result is that , if these distributions of probability ( associated with the different inputs ) are exactly as in the specification for our self - checking source , the state transmitted is a direct sum of states that are individually normally emitted by a perfect source . in practice",
    ", we can not expect these probabilities to be exactly as in the specification for the self - checking source .",
    "however , one can test that they are not too far away from this specification .",
    "furthermore , one should expect that the closer to their specified values these probabilities will be , the closer to the direct sum described above the source will be .",
    "this is usually sufficient to prove security .    in section 2 ,",
    "we show how the main mathematical question arises from the security requirement from the bb84-protocol . in section 3",
    ", the precise question is formulated , and the main theorem stated .",
    "the proof of the main theorem is given in section 4 .",
    "ideally , the objective of key distribution is to allow two participants , typically called alice and bob , who initially share no information , to share a secret random key ( a string of bits ) at the end .",
    "a third party , usually called eve , should not be able to obtain any information about the key .",
    "in reality , this ideal objective can not be realized , especially if we give unlimited power to the cheater , but a quantum protocol can achieve something close to it . see @xcite ( and more recently @xcite ) for a detailed specification of the quantum key distribution task .",
    "one of the greatest challenges in quantum cryptography is to prove that a quantum protocol accomplishes the specified task .",
    "one can experimentally try different kinds of attacks , but one can never know in which way the quantum apparatus can be defective .",
    "in any case , such experiments are almost never done in practice because it is not the way to establish the security of quantum key distribution .",
    "the correct way is a properly designed protocol together with a security proof .",
    "recently , there has been a growing interest in practical quantum cryptography and systems have been implemented @xcite .",
    "however , proving the security of quantum key distribution against _ all _ attacks turned out to be a serious challenge . during many years , many researchers directly or indirectly worked on this problem @xcite . using novel techniques @xcite , a proof of security against all attacks for the quantum key distribution protocol of bennett and brassard",
    "was obtained in 1996 @xcite .",
    "related results were subsequently obtained @xcite , but as yet @xcite is the only known proof of security against all attacks",
    ". a more recent version of the proof with extension to the result is proposed in @xcite .",
    "also , the basic ideas of @xcite might lead to a complete solution if we accept fault tolerant computation ( for example , see @xcite ) , but this is not possible with current technology .    in the quantum transmission , alice sends @xmath0 photons to bob prepared individually in one of the four bb84 states uniformly picked at random .",
    "the bb84 states denoted @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 correspond to a photon polarized at @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 degrees respectively ( see figure [ bb84_picture ] ) .",
    "( we reserve the states @xmath9 and @xmath10 for further use : we will have to add two other states in our analysis . )    ( 40,30 ) ( 10,10)(1,0)14 ( 25,10 ) ( 10,10)(0,1)14 ( 10,25 ) ( 10,10)(1,1)10 ( 21,18 ) ( 10,10)(-1,1)10 ( -3,22 )    bob measures each photon using either the rectilinear basis @xmath11 or the diagonal basis @xmath12 uniformly chosen at random .",
    "the basic idea of the protocol is the following .",
    "both , eve and bob , do not know alice s bases until after the quantum transmission .",
    "eve can not obtain information without creating a disturbance which can be detected .",
    "bob also disturbs the state when he uses the wrong basis , but this is not a problem . after the quantum transmission , alice and bob announce their bases .",
    "alice and bob share a bit when their bases are identical , so they know which bits they share .",
    "the key point is that it s too late for eve because the photons are on bob s side .",
    "however , the security of the protocol relies on the fact that the source behaves as specified , and this is the main subject of this paper .",
    "informally , the source used in the original bb84-protocol @xcite can be described as a blackbox with two buttons on it : _",
    "base2-button _ and _ base3-button_. when alice pushes the base2-button , the output is either @xmath13 or @xmath14 , where @xmath1 and @xmath2 form an orthonormal basis of a two - dimensional system , with each possibility occurring with probability @xmath15 . after the base@xmath16-button is pushed , of the output @xmath17 , only the vector @xmath18 goes out to bob ; bit @xmath19 is only visible to alice .",
    "similarly , if alice pushes the base3-button , the output is either @xmath20 or @xmath21 , with each possibility occurring with probability @xmath15 , where @xmath22    the suggested way in @xcite to achieve the above is to have the blackbox generates a fixed state , say @xmath1 , then the bit @xmath23 is uniformly chosen at random and this state is rotated of an appropriate angle to create the desired state @xmath18 ( assuming that the base@xmath24-button is pressed ) .",
    "the security proof of the protocol extends to sources beyond mentioned above . to obtain our self - testing source",
    ", we need to consider a different type of sources .",
    "conjugate coding source _",
    "@xmath25 consists of a pure state @xmath26 in a hilbert space @xmath27 , and two measurements ( each binary - valued ) @xmath28 , @xmath29 defined on @xmath27 but operating only on coordinates in @xmath30 . pushing base2-button , base3-button performs respectively measurement @xmath28 , @xmath29 .",
    "( we have restricted the form of the initial state to be a pure state @xmath31 instead of a general mixed state .",
    "this is without loss of generality for our result , as we will see . )",
    "let @xmath32 , where @xmath33 , denote the projection operators to the subspaces corresponding to the outcomes @xmath34 for measurement @xmath35 .",
    "( we sometimes use the notation @xmath36 to denote the measurement @xmath35 itself . ) after performing the measurement , only the coordinates in @xmath37 are made available for transmission . thus ,",
    "if button @xmath16 is pushed with outcome @xmath5 , the density operator in the transmitted beam is @xmath38 . for convenience",
    ", we sometimes identify @xmath39 with @xmath5 , and @xmath40 with @xmath41 .",
    "thus , if button @xmath16 is pushed with outcome @xmath19 , the density operator is @xmath42 .",
    "the security proof of the protocol is valid if the source satisfies , for @xmath23 , the conditions @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are orthonormal bases that satisfy equation  ( 1 ) .",
    "it is well known ( and easy to see ) that the following source satisfies the above condition .",
    "let @xmath30 , @xmath37 each be a two - dimensional hilbert space .",
    "let @xmath46 be two pairs of orthonormal bases of @xmath30 related by equation ( 1 ) ; similarly let @xmath47 be two pairs of orthonormal bases related by equation ( 1 ) for @xmath37 .",
    "let @xmath26 be the bell state @xmath48 .",
    "let @xmath49 be two measurements on @xmath27 that operate only on the coordinates in @xmath30 .",
    "the measurement @xmath28 consists of the two orthogonal subspaces @xmath50 , @xmath51 .",
    "the measurement @xmath29 consists of the two orthogonal subspaces @xmath52 , @xmath53 .",
    "if we restrict them to @xmath30 only , the measurement @xmath28 , @xmath29 are the measurements in the bases @xmath54 and @xmath55 respectively .",
    "clearly , ( 2 ) is true .",
    "we call this source the _ perfect system_.    more generally , the security proof extends to systems that behave like a mixture of orthogonal ideal systems .",
    "a source is an _ extended perfect system _ if there exist in @xmath37 orthogonal two dimensional subspaces @xmath56 ( @xmath57 , some index set ) , with @xmath58 denoting states in @xmath56 that respect the same ortogonality condition as the above states @xmath59 in @xmath37 and equation ( 1 ) , such that for some probability distribution @xmath60 on @xmath57 , @xmath61    now comes the question .",
    "if a manufacturer hands over a source and claims that it is a perfect system , how can we check this claims , or at least , makes sure that it is an extended perfect system ?",
    "if the source is a perfect system , let @xmath62 be the measurements operating on @xmath37 in exactly the same way as @xmath49 on @xmath30 .",
    "that is , let @xmath63 ( where @xmath33 ) be the projection operators to subspaces by @xmath64 with outcome @xmath34 ; @xmath65 project to @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 project to @xmath69 , @xmath70 , respectively . now observe that the following are true for @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 we can ask the manufacturer to provide in addition two measuring devices outside the blackbox corresponding to @xmath74 .",
    "a test can be executed to verify that these equations are satisfied ( see the related discussion in the introduction ) .",
    "furthermore , as a matter of physical implementation , to make sure that @xmath75 and @xmath76 operate on @xmath30 , @xmath37 respectively , we can further demand that the buttons are replaced by two measuring devices outside the blackbox .",
    "is that sufficient to guarantee that we have at least an extended perfect system ?",
    "unfortunately , the answer is no .",
    "it is not hard to construct examples where ( 4 ) is satisfied , but it is not an extended ideal system ( and in fact , security is gravely compromised ) .",
    "however , as we will see , if we add one more measurement appropriately on each side , and perform the corresponding checks , then it gurantees to be an extended perfect system",
    ". that will be the main result of this paper .",
    "an object @xmath77 is called an _ ideal source _ if the following are valid : each of @xmath78 is a 2-dimensional hilbert space with @xmath79 being a pair of orthonormal basis of @xmath30 satisfing equation ( 1 ) , and @xmath80 being a pair of orthonormal basis of @xmath37 satisfying equation ( 1 ) ; @xmath26 is the bell state @xmath81 ; @xmath82 are the projection operators on the states @xmath83 , @xmath84 respectively ; @xmath85 are the projection operators on the states @xmath86 , @xmath87 respectively . to describe @xmath88 ,",

    "we remark that in our definition of self - checking source , the restriction of the initial state to a pure state @xmath31 instead of a mixed state @xmath132 is not a real restriction .",
    "given a source with a mixed state @xmath132 satisfying equation ( 6 ) , we can construct one with a pure state @xmath31 ( by enlarging appropriately @xmath30 ) satisfying ( 6 ) .",
