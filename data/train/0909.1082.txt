    "we estimate that a systematic difference in ages by a factor of @xmath133 or a difference in attenuation of @xmath134 mag would have been detectable given the size of the error bars in fig .",

    "because every object in the overdense region would become a little brighter , this means that at the faint end of the luminosity / mass function more objects in the overdense region would pass the detection threshold , while the number for the `` field '' would remain the same .",
    "therefore , one would not immediately expect to find any differences between the average properties of galaxies at the faint end . at the bright end , however , one would expect an excess of massive sources relative to the field .",
    "we estimate that a boost in masses by a factor of a few should be detectable in the cmd diagrams . in this respect , it is interesting that in both fields , the rgs are brighter than any dropout from the goods comparison sample , even though the latter survey covers an area that is over 25 times larger . we have also analyzed the relative numbers of dropouts in the fainter magnitude bins , finding no evidence for a significant brightening of dropouts in the overdense regions . from this",

    "* and see fig . 5 in @xcite )",
    ". the low average number density of such objects further implies that the rgs in the tn1338 and tn0924 fields have experienced a rapid growth through accretion of gas or merging , presumably as a consequence of their overdense environments .",
    "this is qualitatively consistent with some models that specifically require an extra bias factor due to mergers in order to explain the strong clustering of luminous quasars at @xmath77 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    from the lack of any known bright radio sources among the massive goods galaxies ( see * ?",
    "* for details on a radio follow - up in the goods - cdfs ) , we can deduce that _",
    "if _ a powerful ( radio ) agn is a typical phase of massive galaxies at @xmath9 , then it is unlikely to last longer than 3050 myr .",
    "otherwise , radio galaxies would be quite common in a field the size of goods given that the @xmath67-dropout ( @xmath57-dropout ) samples span @xmath10500 ( @xmath10300 ) myr in look - back time .",
    "this simple estimate based on the number counts is quite close to the expected radio source life - times of @xmath1010 myr derived using other arguments @xcite .",
    "if , on the other hand , none of the massive goods galaxies become radio galaxies even for a brief period during the epoch at @xmath9 , it may mean that additional requirements for producing them must be met .",
    "perhaps the overdense environment as observed in the protocluster fields tn1338 and tn0924 facilitates the rapid accretion of cold gas through mergers or cosmological flows @xcite spawning both a massive starburst and powerful agn activity of a supermassive black hole ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite compared the number density of @xmath148 m@xmath21 @xmath149 and @xmath57-dropout systems to the observed density of quiescent @xmath135 m@xmath21 galaxies at @xmath150 , finding that the high redshift sample can account for @xmath151% of the massive population at lower redshift . in a similar fashion , we can compare the number density of the most massive objects in goods at these redshifts to the number density of galaxy clusters in the local universe , finding that they are roughly equal for clusters having @xmath152 erg s@xmath42 @xcite .",
    "thus , one may expect that the @xmath72 descendants of the most massive @xmath77 galaxies in goods are found in typical group and cluster environments ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "since the radio galaxy fields studied in this paper are overdense with respect to goods , it will be interesting to perform a systematic study of galaxies in the direct environment of the massive goods galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we have argued that the overdense regions correspond to sites of massive cluster formation .",
    "if so , we expect that the protocluster region will start to develop a cluster red sequence and a virialized intracluster medium at some redshift @xmath153 .",
    "likely , the stars formed in the protocluster galaxies observed at @xmath9 will evolve and become incorporated into the population of massive early - type galaxies on the red sequence .",
    "we can use our results of  [ sec : results ] to estimate what fraction of this low redshift cluster red sequence mass is represented by all protocluster galaxies detected .",
    "we use the conversion between 3.6@xmath4 m magnitude and @xmath107 derived from the simulations in  [ sec : mrtest ] and calculate the total mass of all dropouts in the tn1338 field at @xmath12 .",
    "we find a total stellar mass of @xmath154 @xmath7 .",
    "about 25% of this mass is due to the large contribution from the radio galaxy .",
    "we will now compare our estimate to the total stellar mass on the red sequence of the cluster rdcs1252.92927 ( cl1252 ) , a massive x - ray luminous cluster at @xmath155 @xcite .",
    "although we do not necessarily expect that tn1338 will evolve into a similar cluster as cl1252 ( see discussion below ) , we choose this particular cluster for our demonstration for a number of reasons .",
    "first , the analysis of cl1252 was performed by members of our team , giving a good understanding of the data and its interpretation .",
    "more importantly , it is one of the best studied high redshift clusters , and its high redshift ensures a minimal gap in cosmic time with respect to @xmath12 ( about 3.5 gyr ) .",
    "this is important because below we will perform a simple extrapolation of the stellar masses measured at @xmath156 to those predicted at @xmath12 .",
    "the analysis of cl1252 performed by @xcite found that 80% of the etgs have population ages of @xmath157 gyr , consistent with a mean formation redshift of @xmath77 .",
    "if we limit ourselves to etgs for which the mean star formation weighted ages are @xmath158 gyr , we find 10 massive ( @xmath159 @xmath7 ) early - type galaxies ( etgs ) representing a total `` red sequence mass '' of @xmath160 @xmath7 ( about half of which is due to the three most massive etgs ) .",
    "if we now assume that all the dropouts detected in the tn1338 field are part of the protocluster , its total stellar mass amounts to about 14% ( at most ) of the total cl1252 etg mass presumed to have formed at @xmath14 .",
    "this percentage ( 14% ) implies that we are currently missing most of the mass that we naively expected to have existed already at @xmath77 .",
    "where could this mass be hiding ? we suggest four possible explanations for this apparent discrepancy : + ( 1 ) when evolved to @xmath156 , tn1338 could be a very different cluster than cl1252 . on one hand , large uncertainties in the physical sizes and the magnitude of the ( dark matter )",
    "overdensities make it currently very difficult to predict the total mass and virialization redshift of the descendants of protoclusters .",
    "estimates indicate that their total masses range from @xmath161 to @xmath162 @xmath7 , with virialization redshifts of @xmath163 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . on the other hand ,",
    "cl1252 is an exceptionally massive , x - ray luminous cluster indicating virialization that was largely complete at @xmath155 .",
    "the relatively low total stellar mass found for tn1338 could therefore indicate that it will evolve into a more typical and lower mass cluster , containing fewer etgs on the red sequence at @xmath164 compared to cl1252 .",
    "interestingly , the existence of extremely massive clusters such as cl1252 at @xmath165 may indicate that much larger protoclusters at @xmath166 remain to be discovered .",
    "+ ( 2 ) a large fraction of the etg mass may be accreted from a much larger region that extends beyond the region probed by our acs pointing .",
    "the ly@xmath1  emitters found by @xcite extend significantly beyond the area covered by our hst data , and @xcite found evidence that tn1338 is part of a larger structure of lbgs at a co - moving scale of @xmath1010 mpc .",
    "+ ( 3 ) the stars may be contained in numerous sub - units that are too faint to be detected by our current survey .",
    "extending the luminosity function of @xmath77 @xmath67-dropouts down to significantly below the detection limit suggests that the contribution from faint objects to the total star formation rate amounts to @xmath16750% ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we may therefore increase our total mass estimate in the overdense region by no more than about a factor of 2 , increasing the etg progenitor mass accounted for at @xmath77 to @xmath1030% .",
    "if this very faint high - redshift population provides indeed an important contribution to the mass of etgs , they will need to merge to form the etg population within a few gyr .",
    "+ ( 4 ) a significant fraction of the stellar mass may be contained in systems that are either very dusty or have little on - going star formation and are hence missed by our uv - selection .",
    "+ the answers to questions ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) are currently difficult to address based on the limited observational data and the small number of protoclusters known .",
    "these issues will be the subject of a future paper in a series of papers aimed at comparing the observational properties of statistical samples of ( proto-)clusters extracted from cosmological simulations of cluster formation ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and in prep . ) .",
    "the possible incompleteness due to red galaxies ( question 4 ) will be discussed in the next section .      because uv - selected samples may miss galaxies that are either quiescent or obscured",
    ", we may expect that the estimates for the number density of massive galaxies both in goods and in the protocluster fields provide a lower limit to the actual number densities . at @xmath168",
    "there is a substantial contribution to the stellar mass function from the populations of so - called distant red galaxies ( drgs ) , which consist of both obscured , star - forming objects and red , quiescent objects that tend to be substantially more massive ( and older ) compared to uv - selected lbgs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "if such objects are abundant in protocluster regions , we may largely resolve the discrepancy we found above between the total stellar mass observed and that expected based on @xmath156 etgs in cl1252 .",
    "will the overdensities in lbgs and laes observed in tn1338 and tn0924 be accompanied by similar overdensities in relatively red or massive galaxies ? @xcite have shown that the uv - selection at @xmath29 may miss as much as @xmath169% of galaxies having very red uv continuum slopes that are selected on the basis of a strong balmer break .",
    "however , at a higher redshift of @xmath170 almost all ( @xmath171% ) galaxies in their balmer break sample are also selected by means of a uv selection .",
    "@xcite show that the uv - dropout selections in goods and the udf at @xmath168 become substantially more complete with increasing redshift .",
    "this is because the uv - continuum slope of the galaxy population becomes bluer as redshift increases . at @xmath30",
    "the distribution of uv slopes of the entire dropout population lies within the dropout selection function , and even at @xmath77 the selection is believed to be largely complete consistent with , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "finally , we consider the population of ultra - luminous ir galaxies ( ulirgs ) . the high redshift ulirg population is a population of heavily obscured starbursts detected in the sub - mm and corresponds to rapidly forming , massive galaxies at @xmath172 .",
    "however , analogous to the population of balmer break objects , the contribution of ulirgs to the star formation rate density declines with redshift from @xmath1030% at @xmath150 to @xmath173% at @xmath77 @xcite .",
    "therefore , we currently do not have very strong reasons for believing that a large population of either the red balmer break objects or heavily enshrouded starbursts is being missed in our tn1338 protocluster at @xmath12 .",
    "follow - up studies are currently being undertaken ( c. de breuck , private communication ) based on deep near - infrared data specifically targeting galaxies having prominent balmer breaks between the @xmath174 and @xmath175 bands ( @xmath175 and 3.6@xmath4 m ) for @xmath77 ( @xmath176 ) that could resolve whether protoclusters have an overabundance of such red objects compared to the general field .",

    "<S> we use hst and spitzer data to infer stellar masses from stellar synthesis models calibrated against the millennium run simulations , and contrast our results with large samples of lbgs in more average environments as probed by the great observatories origins deep survey ( goods ) . </S>",

    "<S> first , lbgs in both overdense regions and in the field at @xmath2 lie on a very similar sequence in a @xmath3[3.6 ] versus 3.6@xmath4 m color - magnitude diagram . </S>",
    "<S> this is interpreted as a sequence in stellar mass ( @xmath5@xmath6 @xmath7 ) in which galaxies become increasingly red due to dust and age as their star formation rate ( sfr ) increases , while their specific sfr stays constant . </S>",
    "<S> second , the two radio galaxies are among the most massive objects ( @xmath8 @xmath7 ) known to exist at @xmath9 , and are extremely rare based on the low number density of such objects as estimated from the @xmath1025@xmath11 larger area goods survey . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that the presence of the massive ( radio ) galaxies and associated supermassive black holes has been boosted through rapid accretion of gas or merging inside overdense regions . </S>",
    "<S> third , the total stellar mass found in the @xmath12 protocluster tn1338 accounts for @xmath1330% of the stellar mass on the cluster red sequence expected to have formed at @xmath14 , based on a comparison with the massive x - ray cluster cl1252 at @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> although future near - infrared observations should determine whether any massive galaxies are currently being missed by our uv / ly@xmath1  selections , one possible explanation for this mass difference is that tn1338 evolves into a smaller cluster than cl1252 . </S>",
    "<S> this raises the interesting question of whether the most massive protocluster regions at @xmath16 remain yet to be discovered . </S>"
