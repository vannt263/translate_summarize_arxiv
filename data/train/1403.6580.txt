    "problems involving phenomena that take place both on surfaces ( or interfaces ) and in bulk domains occur in a variety of applications in fluid dynamics and biological applications .",
    "an example is given by the modeling of soluble surfactants .",
    "surfactants are important because of their ability to reduce the surface tension .",
    "examples of applications where the effects of surfactants are important in the modelling include detergents , oil recovery , and the treatment of lung diseases .",
    "a soluble surfactant is dissolved in the bulk fluid but also exists in adsorbed form on the interface .",
    "a computational challenge is then to properly account for the exchange between these two surfactant forms .",
    "the coupling between the dissolved form in the bulk and the adsorbed form on the interface involves computations of the gradient of the bulk surfactant concentration on a moving interface that may undergo topological changes , see e.g.@xcite . in this context computational methods that allow the interface to be arbitrarily located with respect to a fixed background mesh are of great interest .",
    "we consider a basic model problem of this nature that involves two coupled elliptic problems one in the bulk and one on the boundary of the bulk domain .",
    "the coupling term is defined in such a way that the overall bilinear form in the corresponding weak statement is coercive .",
    "a finite element method was proposed and analyzed for a similar model problem in  @xcite .",
    "see also @xcite , and the references therein for background on finite element methods for partial differential equations on surfaces . in",
    "@xcite a polyhedral approximation of the bulk domain was used and its piecewise polynomial boundary faces served as approximation of the surface . in this contribution",
    "we develop a method that is unfitted , that is , the surface is allowed to cut through a fixed background mesh in an arbitrary way .",
    "such a finite element method was proposed in  @xcite for the laplace  beltrami operator . a general framework for this type of computational methods using finite element methods on cut meshes , co called cutfem methods was recently discussed in @xcite .",
    "the cutfem approach is convenient since the same finite element space defined on a background grid can be used for solving both the partial differential equation in the bulk region and on the surface .",
    "however , a drawback of this type of methods is that the stiffness matrix may become arbitrarily ill conditioned depending on the position of the surface in the background mesh . in the case of the laplace ",
    "beltrami operator this ill conditioning has been addressed in  @xcite and  @xcite . for results on the stability of the bulk equation on cut meshes",
    "see @xcite .",
    "we use continuous piecewise linear elements defined on the background mesh to solve both the problem in the bulk domain and the problem on the surface . to stabilize the method we add gradient jump penalty terms as in  @xcite that ensure that the resulting algebraic system of equations has optimal condition number .",
    "we also consider the approximation of the domain and prove a priori error estimates in both the @xmath1 and @xmath0norms , taking both the approximation of the domain and of the solution into account .",
    "the remainder of the paper is outlined as follows : in section 2 we introduce the model problem and state the weak form , in section 3 we introduce a discrete approximation of the domain , in section 4 we prove a priori estimates for the energy and @xmath0 norm of the error , in section 5 we prove an estimate of the condition number , and finally in section 6 we present a numerical example .",
