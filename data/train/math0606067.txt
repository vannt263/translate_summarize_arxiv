    "this is the second paper in a sequence of papers devoted to the relations between higher categories and @xmath3-fold loop space theory . in the first paper",
    "@xcite we developed the necessary categorical techniques which allow us to go back and forth between @xmath3-operads and classical symmetric operads .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to clarify the geometric and homotopy theoretic aspects of this theory .    to do this we restrict ourselves to a class of so called pruned @xmath9terminal @xmath10operads .",
    "this is a slightly smaller category of @xmath3-operads than we considered in @xcite but it is big enough to include most applications we have in mind .",
    "the reason is that the functor of desymmetrisation from symmetric operads to @xmath3-operads @xcite can be factorised through the category of pruned @xmath3-operads .",
    "moreover , as in the unpruned case this desymmetrisation functor preserves endomorphism operads .",
    "this allows us to construct a theory of symmetrisation very much in parallel to the unpruned case .",
    "it turns out that pruned @xmath3-operads are easier to handle from the combinatorial point of view .",
    "we have a conjecture , however , that the main results of this paper are also true in the case of @xmath4-terminal @xmath3-operads but so far we have been unable to prove it in this generality .",
    "we apply the categorical methods of @xcite to the category of pruned @xmath4-terminal @xmath3-operads and to the even smaller class of reduced @xmath4-terminal @xmath3-operads .",
    "these methods immediately imply the existence of some categorical symmetric operads @xmath11 and @xmath12 which represent the theories of internal @xmath4-terminal pruned @xmath3-operads and internal @xmath4-terminal reduced @xmath3-operads inside categorical symmetric operads , in full analogy with the categorical operad @xmath13 in @xcite .",
    "our first significant result here is theorem [ phnrhnmn ] which asserts that the simplicial operads @xmath14 and @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the nerve functor , are @xmath17-operads in the category of simplicial symmetric operads and reduced simplicial symmetric operads respectively .",
    "together with the theorems [ formulap ] and [ formular ] , these theorems show that once we have a space with an action of a contractible pruned @xmath4-terminal @xmath3-operad there is an action of an @xmath17-operad on this space .",
    "an analogous result holds for the reduced operads in chain complexes .",
    "as we conjectured in @xcite this should give a very natural proof of deligne s conjecture answering a question by kontsevich @xcite - operad acting naturally on a @xmath18-graph consisting of @xmath19-categories , @xmath19-functors and the complex of their derived natural transformations .",
    "in the particular case of a @xmath19-category with one object and transformations of the identity functor , we obtain the hochschild complex of an associative algebra and then we apply our theorem [ enchain ] @xcite . ] .",
    "there are , however , other results in the present paper which we believe are significant .",
    "first we observe that the desymetrisation of the operad of fulton and macpherson @xmath20 of compactified real configuration spaces @xcite contains a contractible reduced @xmath4-terminal @xmath3-operad which we call the getzler - jones operad @xmath21 actually , this operad was discovered by getzler and jones in their remarkable preprint @xcite .",
    "the apparatus of @xmath3-operads did not exist at that time and getzler and jones attempted to express the properties of @xmath22 in terms of a natural subdivision of the operad @xmath20 .",
    "it turned out , however , that getzler - jones subdivision does not give a cellular structure compatible with the operadic structure of @xmath23 as was first observed by d.tamarkin ( see @xcite for an explanation of tamarkin s counterexample . )",
    "this counterexample implied considerable technical difficulties in the proof of deligne s conjecture .",
    "the second implicit appearance of @xmath22 was in the kontsevich and soibleman paper @xcite .",
    "for @xmath24 they considered closed contractible subsets @xmath25 of @xmath26 where @xmath27 is a finite set with two complementary orders on it ( see definition [ complorder ] ) .",
    "they used some properties of @xmath25 to prove deligne s conjecture for @xmath28-algebras .",
    "we show that the space @xmath29 of arity @xmath27 is indeed equal to the kontsevich - soibelman @xmath25 for a pruned @xmath3-tree @xmath27 ( see section [ comporders ] for the explanation of the connection between trees and complementary orders , and section [ gjoperad ] for the definition of @xmath25 for any @xmath3 ) .",
    "we show that @xmath22 can be considered as a natural analogue of @xmath20 in the category of reduced @xmath4-terminal @xmath3-operads .",
    "in particular , set theoretically it is a free reduced @xmath4-terminal @xmath3-operad on the reduced @xmath3-collection of getzler - jones cells .",
    "this last result leads to the theorem that the symmetrisation of @xmath22 is exactly @xmath20 which is the basis for the main results of our paper .",
    "we also think that this gives an interesting new insight to the geometry of @xmath30 we are going to continue this study in the next paper of this series .    the operad @xmath22 is still not cellular in the strong sense that it is not a geometric realisation of a poset of cells of a regular cw - complex .",
    "counterexample works well in this case too .",
    "nevertheless , its unbased version @xmath31 is a cellular object in the category of unbased reduced @xmath4-terminal @xmath3-operads in the model category theoretic sense , and in particular it is a cofibrant contractible operad .",
    "the term unbased here means that we forget about nullary operations of our operads .",
    "there is also an @xmath3-operad @xmath32 which is an unbased categorical reduced @xmath3-operad freely generated by its internal reduced @xmath3-operad .",
    "the geometric realisation of the nerve of this operad is cofibrant and contractible and is strongly homotopy equivalent to the operad @xmath33 this implies a homotopy equivalence between the geometric realisation of @xmath34 and @xmath35 this operad @xmath36 ( the unbased categorical reduced symmetric operad freely generated by its internal reduced @xmath3-operad ) plays , therefore , the role of the nonexistent poset operad of cells of the getzler and jones decomposition .    perhaps , the most intresting result of the above study of the combinatorics of the getzler - jones operad is the following generalisation of stasheff s classical theory of @xmath28-spaces .",
    "the closure of a getzler - jones cell @xmath37 inside @xmath38 is a manifold with corners homeomorphic to the ball of dimension @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the number of edges of the @xmath3-tree @xmath41 the cellularity of @xmath31 means that an action of @xmath31 on a pointed space @xmath8 can be described as an inductive process of extension of higher homotopies from the boundary of @xmath42 to its interior in exact analogy with stasheff s description of @xmath28-spaces . and",
    "our theorem [ symgj ] states that the collection @xmath43 where @xmath44 runs over the set of pruned @xmath3-trees , gives full coherence conditions for @xmath17-spaces .",
    "if @xmath45 the collection @xmath46 is the sequence of associahedra @xcite and we get stasheff s theorem .",
    "the difference between @xmath1-dimensional and higher dimensional cases appears in the existence of some cells ( tamarkin s cells ) in @xmath22 which are not completely on the boundary of @xmath47 this is not excessive information , however , just a defect of our language when we try to express the coherence laws in terms of an action of an @xmath4-terminal @xmath3-operad .",
    "there is a way of avoiding this problem but we will have to pay a price by using more sophisticated @xmath3-operads which have full source and target operations . we will consider this subject in a forthcoming paper",
    ".    finally , in the last section of this paper we apply our techniques to the case of swiss cheese type operads @xcite .",
    "the advantage of our categorical methods is that we have nothing to prove here once we put the right definitions of our main categories and functors in place .",
    "we deduce immediately a symmetrisation formula for swiss cheese type @xmath3-operads - operadic point of view and for sending me a preliminary version of his papers concerning the action of swiss - cheese operads on associative algebras and their hochschild complexes @xcite .",
    "] and other swiss - cheese analogues of the results for classical operads .",
    "we hope that similar results can be obtained for symmetrisation of some other important coloured operads ; for example , operads for morphisms between @xmath17-algebras . this should lead to a better understanding of coherence conditions for such morphisms .",
    "we will freely use the terminology from @xcite concerning @xmath3-trees , @xmath4-terminal @xmath3-operads and their algebras .",
    "notice , however , that the main objects for us here are @xmath4-terminal @xmath3-algebras of our @xmath3-operads .",
    "roughly speaking such an algebra is an object @xmath8 of our basic symmetric monoidal category @xmath48 together with an action @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the number of tips of @xmath27 satisfying some natural conditions .",
    "an @xmath3-operad @xmath5 may have , however , more complicated types of algebras which involve source and target operations but we do not need them here .",
    "so we will speak simply about category of algebras of @xmath5 having in mind the subcategory of its @xmath4-terminal algebras .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for more discussion about this issue",
    ".    * acknowledgements . *",
    "i would like to thank andr joyal for pointing out a mistake in the first version of this paper .",
    "it is exactly the work on this mistake which led me to an understanding of the role of the getzler - jones operad in @xmath3-operad theory .",
    "i am also very grateful to him for organising my visit to montreal in july 2003 and for our fruitful and inspiring discussions during that time .",
    "i also wish to express my gratitude to c.berger , l.breen , e.getzler , s.lack , m.markl , j.stasheff , r.street , d.tamarkin and a.voronov for numerous illuminating conversations and correspondences .",
    "finally , i gratefully acknowledge the financial support of the scott russell johnson memorial foundation and australian research council ( grant # dp0558372 ) .",
    "here we consider a combinatorial techniques which will be used further to develop a theory of pruned @xmath3-operads .",
    "the machinery of bar - codes from @xcite is an equivalent language but we prefer to work with the notion of complementary orders introduced by kontsevich and soibelman in @xcite .    a partial order on a set @xmath8 is a transitive , antireflective relation on @xmath51 it is called linear if any two elements are comparable .",
    "antireflective here means that the diagonal is always in the complement relation .",
    "we choose this terminology just for technical reasons .",
    "of course , we always can add the diagonal to our relations and work with reflective relations .",
    "so if we are given a partial order @xmath52 we will often use the notation @xmath53 to mean that @xmath54 or @xmath55 this does not lead to any trouble .",
    "observe , also that a partial order in our sense is always antisymmetric .",

    "the proof is obvious .",
    "@xmath67     in fact we can characterise pruned @xmath3-trees in the following way :    [ treeord ] suppose we are given @xmath3-complementary orders @xmath68 on a finite set @xmath8 such that    * if @xmath69 and @xmath70 then @xmath71    then there exist a linear order on @xmath8 and a pruned @xmath3-tree @xmath27 such that the ordinal of its tips is @xmath72 $ ] and the complementary orders @xmath68 are determined by @xmath41    * proof .  * the linear order @xmath52 on @xmath8 is defined by the requirement that @xmath63 if and only if there exists a @xmath73 such that @xmath74 let @xmath64 $ ] be the corresponding ordinal .",

    "this includes the case of a terminal ordinal ( one element set and empty @xmath3 complementary orders ) and of an initial ordinal ( empty set ) .",
