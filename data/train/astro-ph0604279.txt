    "friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) models are the simplest models of the expanding universe which are spatially homogeneous and isotropic . when proposed , the principal justification for studying these models was their mathematical simplicity and tractability rather than observational evidence . however , we now have observational evidence from the isotropy of cmb and large scale structure that the universe on large scales must be very close to that of a frw model",
    ". however , there still remains some freedom to choose homogeneous models that are initially anisotropic but become more isotropic as the time goes on , and asymptotically tend to a frw model .",
    "bianchi models provide a generic description of homogeneous anisotropic cosmologies and they are classified into 10 equivalence classes . among these models",
    "it is reasonable to consider only those types that encompass frw models .",
    "these are types i and vii@xmath2 in the case of @xmath3 , v and vii@xmath0 in the case of @xmath4 , and ix in the case of @xmath5 .",
    "bianchi models which do not admit frw solutions become highly anisotropic at late times .",
    "type ix models re - collapse after a finite time and hence do not approach arbitrarily near to isotropy . also models of type vii@xmath0 will not in general approach isotropy . the most general bianchi types that admit frw models are bianchi types vii@xmath0 and ix .",
    "these two types contain types i , v , vii@xmath2 as special sub - cases .",
    "an interesting feature of these models is that they resemble a universe with a vorticity .",
    "it is interesting to determine bounds on universal rotation from cosmological observations because the absence of such a rotation is a prediction of most models of the early universe , in particular , within the paradigm of inflation .",
    "cmb anisotropy is a powerful tool to study the evolution of vorticity in the universe because models with vorticity have clear signatures in the cmb .",
    "the vortex patterns that are imprinted by the unperturbed anisotropic expansion are roughly constructed out of two parts : production of pure quadrupole variations , or focusing of the quadrupole pattern in open models and a spiral pattern that are the characteristic signatures of vii@xmath2 and vii@xmath0 models respectively .",
    "there are distinct features in each bianchi pattern .",
    "for example the temperature anisotropy pattern for bianchi vii@xmath0 universes is of the form ( , ) = f_1()+f_2 ( ) . the functions @xmath6 and @xmath7 depend on the parameters of the particular bianchi model and must be computed numerically @xcite . in a pioneering work ,",
    "analytical arguments were used to find upper bounds on the amount of shear and vorticity in the universe today , from the absence of any detected cmb anisotropy . a detailed numerical analysis of such models used experimental limits on the dipole and quadrupole to refine limits on universal rotation @xcite .",
    "after the first detection of cmb anisotropy by cobe - dmr , bianchi models were again studied by fitting the full spiral pattern from models with global rotation to the 4-year dmr data to constrain the allowed parameters of a bianchi model of type vii@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "recently bianchi vii@xmath0 models were compared to the first - year wmap data on large scales and it was shown that the best fit bianchi model corresponds to a highly hyperbolic model ( @xmath8 ) with a right - handed vorticity @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "they also found that ` correcting ' the first - year wmap data including the ilc map for the bianchi template , makes the reported anomalies in the wmap data such as alignment of quadrupole and octupole disappear and also ameliorates the problem of the low observed value of quadrupole model with a left handed @xmath10 model and a right handed @xmath11 with a larger vorticity @xmath12 for ilc map @xcite . ] . in a more recent work using template fitting",
    "it was found that although the `` template '' detections are not statistically significant they do correct the above anomalies @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "it was also found by @xcite that deviations from gaussianity in the kurtosis of spherical mexican hat wavelet coefficients of the wmap first year data are eliminated once the data is corrected for the bianchi template . in a recent work",
    "the effect of this bianchi correction on the detections of non - gaussianity in the wmap data was investigated @xcite and was shown that previous detections of non - gaussianity observed in the skewness of spherical wavelet coefficients reported in @xcite are not reduced by the bianchi correction and remain at a significant level .",
    "it has been argued in ref .",
    "@xcite that increasing the scaling of the template by a factor of 1.2 makes the spot vanish .",
    "although a stronger pattern may eliminate the non - gaussian spot , it would tend to make the resultant map more anisotropic .",
    "therefore there is a limit to the strength of anisotropic patterns that can be hidden in the wmap data .",
    "the above analysis was redone after the release of 3 year wmap data @xcite , by two teams @xcite and the previous conclusions were confirmed .    in this paper",
    "we show that the statistical isotropy violation of a hidden pattern in the cmb map , such as that of bianchi universe , can be quantified in terms of the bipolar power spectrum .",
    "more specifically , we test the consistency of existence of a hidden bianchi template in the wmap data proposed in recent literature against our null detection of bipolar power spectrum ( bips ) in the wmap first year and three year maps@xcite .",
    "the bipolar power spectrum is a measure of statistical isotropy in cmb anisotropy maps and is zero when statistical isotropy obtains .",
    "properties of bips have been studied in great details in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we show that although correcting the wmap first year maps for the bianchi template may explain some features in the wmap data , this is done at the expense of introducing some anomalies such as preferred directions and the violation of statistical isotropy into the bianchi corrected maps .",
    "this violation is stronger in the case of enhanced bianchi templates proposed by @xcite . by testing statistical isotropy of bianchi",
    "embedded cmb maps , we put a limit of @xmath13 on bianchi vii@xmath0 models . here",
    "@xmath14 is the shear and @xmath15 is the hubble constant .",
    "our result is marginally consistent with @xcite but not with the enhanced bianchi templates of @xcite .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as the following .",
    "section 2 is a brief review of bianchi classification of homogeneous spaces .",
    "section 3 is dedicated to deriving the cmb patterns of bianchi vii@xmath0 models . in @xmath16  4 statistical isotropy of bianchi vii@xmath0 models",
    "are studied and compared to the null bipolar power spectrum of the wmap data .",
    "finally in @xmath16  5 we draw our conclusion .",
    "today , the bianchi classification of homogeneous spaces is based on a simple scheme for classifying the equivalence classes of 3-dimensional lie algebras .. see @xcite for mathematical preliminaries and details . ]",
    "this scheme uses the irreducible parts of the structure constant tensor under linear transformations .",
    "following , we decompose the spatial commutation structure constants @xmath17 into a tensor , @xmath18 , and a vector , @xmath19 c^a_bc=_dbcn^ad+^a_c a_b-^a_b a_c where @xmath20 is the 3-dimensional antisymmetric tensor and @xmath18 and @xmath19 are defined as a_b&= & c^a_ba + n^ab&= & c^(a_cd^b)cd . the structure constants @xmath17 expressed in this way , satisfy the first jacobi identity .",
    "second jacobi identity , shows that @xmath19 must have zero contraction with the symmetric @xmath21-tensor @xmath18 ; c_e[b^ac_cd]^e=0 n^aba_b=0 .",
    "we choose a convenient basis to diagonalize @xmath18 to attain @xmath22 and to set @xmath23 .",
    "the jacobi identities are then simply equivalent to @xmath24 .",
    "consequently we can define two major classes of structure constants + class a : @xmath25 , + class b : @xmath26 .",
    "+ one can then classify further by the sign of the eigenvalues of @xmath18 ( signs of @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 ) .",
    "parameter @xmath30 in class b , where @xmath31 is non - zero , is defined by the scalar constant of proportionality in the following relation a_ba_c=_bik_cjln^ijn^kl . in the case of diagonal @xmath18 ,",
    "the @xmath30 factor has a simple form @xmath32 .",
    "this is the most general family of models which includes the @xmath33 frw solutions .",
    "it has some of the features of both types v and type vii@xmath2 .",
    "there is an adjustable parameter @xmath30 in this model which is given by the square of structure constants . in an unperturbed frw model , the expansion scale factor , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 into two parts : its volume and the distortion part , @xmath36 where the scalar @xmath34 represents the volumetric expansion whilst @xmath35 is symmetric , trace free @xmath37 matrix and hence @xmath38 is given by the series @xmath39 ] are given by @xcite , @xmath40    we introduce a factor @xmath41 which is related to the parameter @xmath30 by x=. as we said before , @xmath42 has no physical effect on the frw models .",
    "it can be seen from the fact that the present value of the scale factor can be arbitrarily chosen , but from eqn .",
    "( [ alpha ] ) we have e^_0= , and hence , we see that parameter @xmath42 can be scaled out of the solution .",
    "however , for large values of @xmath42 ( or equally @xmath30 ) , the models are similar to those of type v. as the present density tends towards the critical density , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 in such a way that @xmath42 remains finite , the behavior of the models tend to that of type vii@xmath2 .",
    "behavior of these models with different parameters can be seen in figure [ bianchi4 ] .",
    "null geodesics have a complicated form and are given by @xmath45 } \\\\ \\nonumber \\phi&=&\\phi_0+(\\tau-\\tau_0)-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{h}}\\ln{\\{\\sin^2{\\left(\\frac{\\theta_0}{2}\\right)}+\\cos^2{\\left(\\frac{\\theta_0}{2}\\right)}\\exp{[2(\\tau-\\tau_0)\\sqrt{h}]}\\}}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] they start near the south pole and spiral in the negative @xmath46-direction up towards the equator , and then spiral in the positive @xmath46-direction up towards the north pole .",

    "the value of @xmath35 has been calculated for them and is given in . here",
    "we follow @xcite who used these to calculate the contribution to temperature anisotropies from the vorticity alone .",
    "they argue that the inclusion of other pure shear distortions which are independent of the rotation could only make the temperature anisotropies larger . and",
    "hence their results would give the maximum level of vorticity consistent with a given value of temperature anisotropy .    in type vii@xmath0",

    "[ bianchi4 ] , the spiral patterns in high density models are not concentrated in one hemisphere and ca nt be used to cure the large - scale power asymmetry in the wmap data reported by @xcite .",

    "we pay our attention to the specific model proposed by @xcite and in the next two sections , we address the question whether and to what extent one would be able to discover this pattern and other hidden anisotropic patterns in the cmb anisotropy maps .",
    "we carry out our analysis on full sky cmb maps .",
    "it has been shown in our previous papers  @xcite , that for a masked cmb sky maps , the bipolar power spectrum has a calculable specific form . in that case",
    ", the violation of si is measured with respect to the ` bias ' that arises for the masked sky map .",
    "the excess bips signature would certainly depend to some extent on the specific orientation of the bianchi template in the sky , given by the extent to which the pattern is covered by the mask . in this work",
