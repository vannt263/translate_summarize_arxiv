    "in the generally accepted model for the formation of planets , the circumstellar disk  consisting of material remaining from the formation of the central star  progresses through a series of dynamical stages . over the course of this evolution ,",
    "the solids contained in the disk are believed to settle towards the midplane and form planetesimals , which in turn merge to assemble terrestrial planets and cores of gaseous giants .",
    "unfortunately , some of the most basic elements of this model are not understood , with the detailed physical processes involved at many stages only barely explored .",
    "one such poorly - understood stage is the formation of planetesimals from interstellar dust .",
    "it is generally accepted that micron - sized particles collide and stick together to form larger particles , but it is not clear that this stochastic coagulation process can continue up the ladder to generate km - sized planetesimals . among other difficulties with this model is the problem that bodies with approximate sizes between @xmath1 and @xmath2 would drift radially inward very fast , as a consequence of drag with the partially pressure - supported gas disk in which they are embeded @xcite . as a way of solving this problem ,",
    "authors have looked for a process that allows particles to grow through this range of sizes in time scales similar or smaller to the orbital time @xcite .",
    "for example , @xcite and @xcite noted that because particles of different sizes are affected differently by gas drag they would drift at different speeds , thus increasing their collision rate and possibly increasing the particle growth rate .",
    "nevertheless , it remains questionable whether solid state forces can grow particles through sticking at the collision velocities likely present in proto - planetary disks ( see discussion in youdin & shu 2002 ) .",
    "gravitational instability ( gi ) has been proposed as an alternative @xcite . in this model , as the dust settles vertically to create a dense midplane subdisk , the spatial particle density may increase until the layer crosses the gi density threshold .",
    "this model has the advantage that particle growth from mm to km sizes happens in a short time scale .",
    "still , there are uncertainties in this gi model . for example , several authors @xcite have pointed out that @xmath3 sized bodies , an intermediate step of the two - staged process proposed by @xcite , reach the disk midplane with random velocities too large for gi to proceed .",
    "a more frequently discussed problem with the gi hypothesis arises from the fact that , as the solid particle density increases through vertical settling , the gas / dust mixture becomes less sensitive to large scale gas pressure gradients that are likely to be present in the disk . with the loss of radially - supporting pressure gradients , the dust - rich mixture near the midplane would orbit the central star with an orbital frequency closer to the keplerian rate , and",
    "thus develop a velocity shear with its dust - poor envelope .",
    "this velocity shear might trigger the kelvin - helmholtz instability ( khi ) , which could mix the dust and gas layers and stop particle settling before gi sets in @xcite .",
    "the question posed at this point is : what are the appropriate circumstances for the development of the khi in circumstellar disks ? or conversely , is it possible to have a kh - stable disk that is susceptible to gi , and so able to form planetesimals within a very short timescale ?",
    "the most favorable circumstance for gi is if there is no turbulence  and no mixing of solids  in the absense of khi .",
    "@xcite performed linear stability analyses of vertically shearing disks and concluded that gi can be achieved , avoiding the khi induced mixing , only if the dust - to - gas surface density ratio is much larger than the solar abundance .",
    "other authors have reached a similar conclusion while considering the potentially de - stabilizing influence of the coriolis and tidal forces @xcite , stratification of the medium , two - fluid effects and radiative cooling @xcite .",
    "@xcite further argued that the gas involved in the khi should be able to drag and mix only a finite amount of solids , so that there might be a decoupling and precipitation of solids once the dust space density is large enough , even for particle sizes at which a good velocity coupling is expected .",
    "the precipitated particles would be free to continue settling and undergo gi . if a strong central enhancement of dust develops @xcite and precipitates out an independent solid layer , then potentially this reduces the needed dust - to - gas surface density enhancement required for planetesimals to form via gi .",
    "even with the modification proposed by @xcite , however , the dust - to - gas surface density ratio must be enhanced above solar - abundance values @xmath4 by an order of magnitude .    of course , this increased surface density ratio ( which can also help accelerate stochastic coagulation ) does not have to be global .",
    "particle drift in the radial direction @xcite , and self - gravitating spiral modes @xcite could provide localized surface density concentrations of dust . provided that these enhancements are long - lived",
    ", this could lead to localized gi .",
    "as discussed above , when dust settles toward the midplane , both ( de - stabilizing ) shear and ( stabilizing ) buoyancy increase . in the situation where dust and gas are well - enough coupled , they may be considered a single fluid . for a stratified flow , competition between the opposing shear and buoyancy effects",
    "is traditionally described by the richardson number ,    @xmath5    where @xmath6 is the equilibrium shear velocity in the plane perpendicular to @xmath7 .",
    "@xcite and @xcite proved ( for incompressible flow in the boussinesque approximation ) that @xmath8 somewhere in the layer is a necessary ( but not sufficient ) condition for instability ( see also drazin & reid 1981 , p. 325 ; a review of the proof is presented in the appendix b of li , goodman & narayan 2003 ) .",
    "as @xcite argue , however , some of the assumptions in this proof , while acceptable in other physical regimes , are not applicable to the problem at hand .    in this paper",

    "figure [ sdh_fig ] shows the minimum stable layer thickness for three different values of @xmath103 , for a range of dust - to - gas surface density ratios and @xmath115 .",
    "both even- and odd - symmetry solutions are shown . in a real system , the dust will ( at least initially ) likely settle toward the midplane at a higher rate than the surface density ratio changes",
    "so , we can imagine the disk evolving down along a vertical line in figure [ sdh_fig ] , until it reaches the stability edge at a relevant wavelength .",
    "on a longer time scale , the disk may then move along that edge towards larger @xmath116 values as gas is lost to photoevaporation or the dust component is increased due to radial drift , for example .",
    "the slopes of the critical curves at fixed @xmath103 can be understood physically . at small",
    "@xmath116 , an increase in @xmath116 increases @xmath117 , thus increasing the velocity shear since @xmath118 .",
    "this forces an increase in @xmath119 in order to keep the layer marginally stable ; as a consequence , from equation ( [ instb_eq ] ) , the critical @xmath120 at small @xmath117 . for large @xmath116 , @xmath102 and the velocity difference saturates to @xmath121 ; in this case , the dust layer must get thinner to remain marginally stable with increasing dust abundance . at large @xmath117 , the critical curve therefore follows @xmath122 .",
    "these small- and large-@xmath117 scalings of @xmath123 with @xmath116 are the same as have been identified by @xcite in their equations ( c3 ) and ( c9 ) , respectively .",
    "lines of constant @xmath105 are also plotted in figure [ sdh_fig ] .",
    "recall that for a continuous dust distribution , @xmath124 is a necessary ( but not sufficient ) condition for the development of the kh instability . for our discrete three - layer distribution",

    ", we find that the critical @xmath127 at @xmath128 , close to the @xmath129 result of @xcite and @xcite . at larger @xmath116",
    ", the layer is too heavy to be easily disturbed by a global mode . in this case , with @xmath102 , the stability limit ( for either even- or odd - symmetry modes ) is @xmath130 .",
    "so , at given @xmath105 and @xmath131 , the increasingly short wavelengths that are required for instability with increasing @xmath116 would make the disturbance only a surface phenomenon .",
    "global instabilities only become possible when @xmath119 , and hence @xmath105 , decreases .",
    "@xcite find , similarly , that the critical value of @xmath132 decreases as @xmath116 increases above @xmath133 , for the value of @xmath49 we adopt .    for large @xmath116 and",
    "fixed @xmath103 , figure [ sdh_fig ] shows that the maximum unstable @xmath119 has the same wavelength for both the even and odd modes .",
    "but the growth rates are not the same , as shown in figure [ shgrowth_fig ] .",
    "as the layer thickness decreases at constant surface density , even modes at a given @xmath103 will develop more rapidly than the corresponding odd modes . or , conversely , an even mode with longer wavelength ( and more efficient dilution of the dust layer ) will become excited at the same time as a ( less - efficient ) odd mode with shorter wavelength .",
    "this can be expected , since the incompressibility condition implies , for the odd mode , that a horizontal converging flow must be generated in the midplane at the position where the interface displacement makes the layer thicker ( @xmath134 ) . since the even mode does not need to channel energy into this requirement",
    ", it can grow faster . on the other hand , since the odd mode does not need to vertically displace the whole layer , it can remain unstable for larger @xmath119 values , at which gravity is stronger at the layer interface .      in  [ v1zeven_sec ] and  [ v1zodd_sec ] we studied the solutions of equations ( [ disprel_eq ] ) and ( [ disprelodd_eq ] ) obtained when the coriolis forces are neglected . while the solutions presented were for the exact equations , we have found that taking the long - wavelength limit @xmath135 yields a good approximation to the stability even at values of @xmath136 relatively large ( @xmath137 ) .",
    "when the coriolis terms are included ( @xmath92 ) , the dispersion relation retains its simple character when @xmath138 , so for this section we concentrate on that limit . , and equation ( [ disprel_eq ] ) yields the same dispersion relation as the two layer problem with rotation studied by @xcite ; see also @xcite . ]    in the long wavelength regime , equation ( [ disprel_eq ] ) can be written as    @xmath139    where we require the real part of the square root to be positive .",
    "the procedure used to solve equation ( [ disprel_long_eq ] ) is presented in the appendix , and the corresponding roots are shown in figure [ chandra_fig ] .",
    "the number and nature of the roots can change only at critical @xmath119 values ( as described in the appendix ) , marked in figure [ chandra_fig ] by the vertical lines .    for the parameters presented in figure [ chandra_fig]b ,",
    "there is a range of values of @xmath119 with only real solutions , which implies stability .",
    "nevertheless , we consider the existence of this gap of limited practical significance since the gap closes for longer wavelengths ( which yield more efficient vertical mixing ) .",
    "more significant is the fact that there are no solutions , real or complex , when @xmath140 , or @xmath141 ( right hand side of figure [ chandra_fig ] ) .",
    "the transition critical point corresponds to @xmath142 . for given ( order unity )",
    "@xmath103 , and any @xmath116 , sufficiently small @xmath117 guarantees that this condition holds .",
    "thus , using equation ( [ rich_eq ] ) , a necessary ( but not sufficient ) condition for instability at long wavelengths appears to be    @xmath143    comparison of equation ( [ rotins_eq ] ) and its equivalent for the @xmath91 case ( eq . [ [ fullins_eq ] ] ) shows that a larger @xmath105 is required for stability when the coriolis terms are turned on : for @xmath144 , the critical value for @xmath105 is 1.1 when @xmath92 , compared to 0.32 , 0.14 , and 0.09 for @xmath145 and 10 , respectively when @xmath146 .",
    "notice that both conditions reduce to the same criterion for instability when @xmath103 and @xmath147 .",
    "however , small @xmath117 and @xmath148 are satisfied only for @xmath149 , i.  e. , for cases with much lower metallicity than that expected in the proto - solar nebula .",
    "an interesting feature of equation ( [ rotins_eq ] ) is that ( unlike eq .",
    "[ [ fullins_eq ] ] ) it does not explicitly depend on the dust abundance , @xmath117 .",
    "this is due to the fact that , at the onset of instability for the @xmath92 case , the phase velocity vanishes [ @xmath150 .",
    "this has two consequences .",
    "first , a larger fraction of the heavier layer s momentum is available to help destabilize the flow ( and so , the layer remains unstable for larger @xmath105 ) . and",
    "second , a vanishingly small @xmath94 means a small @xmath151 ( eq . [ [ k1_eq ] ] ) , so that vertical pressure gradients in the gas layer are very small .",
    "so , as the dust / gas mixture flows through the sinuous focus of the perturbed midplane layer , only the centrifugal force in the vertical direction ( @xmath152 ) and gravity ( @xmath153 ) are involved in the force balacing , while gas pressure gradients are neglegible .",
    "in contrast , for the @xmath110 case , @xmath154 is non - vanishing at the onset of instability , yielding a finite @xmath151 value .",
    "this implies non - neglegible vertical pressure gradients , which introduce a dependence on the dust - to - gas density ratio in the force balance .",
    "small or vanishing @xmath154 is possible only in the @xmath155 case , when the coriolis forces ( from @xmath156 ) are able to partly of fully compensate for azimuthal pressure forces .",
    "we can alternatively write the instability condition for @xmath92 in terms of more basic physical parameters by considering equation ( [ rich_eq ] ) in the large and small @xmath117 limits :    @xmath157    notice that the minimum stable layer thickness approaches a constant value as @xmath116 increases , as shown by the dotted lines of figure [ sdh_fig ] .",
    "this stands in contrast with the instability criterion for the @xmath110 case ( see equation [ [ instb_eq ] ] and figure [ sdh_fig ] ) , for which @xmath158 as the surface density increases .",
    "thus , for large @xmath117 , the instability criterion is @xmath159 for @xmath92 , compared to @xmath160 for @xmath110 .",
    "while we have concentrated on the long - wavelength limit in the discussion of this section , we note that the general dispersion relation of equation ( [ disprel_eq ] ) can easily be solved in the limit @xmath161 .",
    "when @xmath92 , an unstable solution will appear when @xmath105 passes below the value    @xmath162    \\frac{\\sqrt{1 - 4\\omega_f^2/(k_y v)^2}}{k_y h_d},\\ ] ]    with growth rate @xmath163 .",
    "thus , the necessary criterion for instability in the long - wavelength limit is quite similar to a more general _ necessary and sufficient _",
    "criterion for a marginally - unstable mode to appear . since @xmath164",
    ", @xmath165 is in practice slightly larger than the value deduced in the long - wavelength limit .",
    "we note that for the odd - symmetry case , the critical @xmath105 is given by the same expression as above , with @xmath166 substituted for @xmath167 ; for long wavelengths , the instability criterion is therefore @xmath168 , or , using @xmath169 ,    @xmath170    this is always smaller than than the criterion for the even - symmetry case , and @xmath171 $ ] for @xmath102 .",
    "finally , we note that the conclusions based on the odd - symmetry three - layer system are similar to those for the two - layer system considered by @xcite .",

    "with physical understanding developed via the instability analysis of the simple three - layer model in  [ threelayer_sec ] , we now turn to fully non - linear simulations with a continuous dust distribution .",
    "our solutions of equations ( [ hd_eq1])-([hd_eq4 ] ) are obtained using a version of zeus @xcite , a finite difference , time explicit , operator split , eulerian code for numerical hydrodynamics . for the purpose of this investigation",
    ", we implemented source terms corresponding to the coriolis force and the background radial pressure gradient .",

    "we have tested this implementation by advecting a one dimensional , gaussian - shaped `` dust cloud '' in pressure equilibrium with its surroundings .",

    "the density snapshots presented are @xmath192 and @xmath193 ( @xmath91 ) , and @xmath194 and @xmath195 ( @xmath92 ) , where @xmath196 is the orbital time .",
    "the initial linear growth phase is very similar for both cases , with a sinusoidal displacement of the dust layer consistent with the even ( midplane - crossing ) mode of the instability .",
    "notice that the instability develops three wavelengths in the computation domain , which corresponds to @xmath197 .",
    "we also performed simulations with 3 and 5 times larger grids in the @xmath186 direction ( at lower resolution ) , and found that the same approximate @xmath103 mode predominated .",
    "the fastest growing mode in the analysis presented in @xcite has a similar @xmath103 value .    in the @xmath91 case ,",
    "once the displacement is large enough , drag with the dust - poor fluid erodes the tips of the displaced layer , generating familiar backward - facing kh rolls .",
    "the flow around the rolls pushes the dust toward the peaks , where it accumulates until the layer breaks . after the wave breaks ,",
    "the dust mixes with the surrounding gas , lowering the dust abundance and the velocity shear , and generating a more - or - less homogeneous layer with a thickness similar to the wavelength of the linear growth .",

    "remnant non - organized motions generate diffusion that further increase the layer thickness over longer time - scales .",
    "in contrast to the @xmath91 model , after the linear growth phase the @xmath92 case has a period of very rapid evolution . unlike the @xmath110 case , the dust accumulates in the midplane at the nodes of the displaced layer .",
    "as the vertical displacement grows , the leading faces of the perturbed dust layer encounters the slower - moving high - latitude gas . as the gas is pushed by the dust , it gains angular momentum and flows radially outward ( see figure [ radvel_fig ] )",
    ". correspondingly , the dusty layer looses angular momentum and flows radially inward , increasing its azimuthal velocity . as a consequence , the displaced peaks move faster than the gas in the midplane , generating forward leaning structures .",
    "when the initial density layer looses integrity , it forms a new layer thicker than the one generated in the @xmath91 case .",

    "first , the odd mode developes longer wavelengths , fitting only two wavelengths in the domain , evolving later to a single wavelength .",
    "second , despite the longer wavelength , the extent of the layer after the non - linear growth phase is thinner , with the dust accumulated at the midplane .",
    "third , this ( and other ) odd mode simulations evolve much more slowly than the even mode ones .",
    "this odd mode simulation has a much larger latency time , despite the fact that the initial perturbations are a factor of 10 larger than the even mode example .",
    "the dominant wavelengths that develop for the even modes have larger growth rates than the ones for the odd modes : for this case , @xmath198 vs. @xmath199 ( the procedure to measure these growth rates is described in  [ rich_sec ] ) .",
    "in addition to the sample cases shown , we have performed a large number of similar models with both @xmath91 and @xmath92 , and either full or `` half '' grids .",
    "we have covered a range @xmath200 through @xmath201 , with a constant surface density ratio @xmath202 .",
    "overall , we find a confirmation of the above results : the layer evolves more rapidly when @xmath92 , and more slowly when we force the development of the odd mode .",
    "we also found that , for @xmath110 and this @xmath116 value , the layer becomes stable for @xmath203 .",
    "when @xmath92 , the layer appeared to be always unstable , although the evolution times are quite small for the thickest layers .",
    "the initialization procedure adopted in  [ mu_sec ] is quite simple , but also quite arbitrary in terms of the detailed functional form of the dust distribution . as an alternative approach",
    ", we can adopt a prescription for the initial conditions which satisfies additional physically - motivated constraints .",
    "a natural choice is to set @xmath132 to a constant value everywhere in the flow ; this choice is motivated by the common conception that low-@xmath132 flows are unstable , and high-@xmath132 flows are stable .",

    "the domain of these simulations extended @xmath218 in @xmath186 , and @xmath219 in @xmath22 ( we did not need a large @xmath22 extension since these experiments were designed to follow only the linear part of the instability , as opposed to the full evolution of  [ mu_sec ] ) .",
    "our standard resolution was using @xmath220 grid points , with higher resolution models tested for selected cases in order to verify the results .",
    "each simulation was followed through @xmath221 , which corresponds to values between @xmath222 and @xmath223 for @xmath132 between 0.1 and 1.0 .",
    "the initial equilibrium setup was perturbed with random velocities with a maximum amplitude of @xmath187 .    after exploring several possibilities , we found that a practical way of assessing the stability of the dust layer was by calculating the fourier transform of @xmath224 along the @xmath186 direction , as a function of @xmath22 .",
    "when the layer is unstable , the fastest growing mode is easily identified from this plot ; its amplitude can then be examined as a function of time . in most cases ,",
    "the linear growth phase of the instability is clearly evident , and a growth rate can be measured .",
    "an example is presented in figure [ fourier_fig ] .",
    "as expected , the empirically - determined region of stability in the parameter space does not have a sharp edge , but instead growth rates decrease until our procedure becomes too insensitive to measure them . for practical purposes ,",
    "we denote as `` stable '' those simulations that do not show growth within the allotted run time , or else for which the measured growth rate is lower than a fiducial value , set to @xmath225 ; this growth rate corresponds to a ten - fold increase in amplitude over 10 orbital times .    in figure [ us_fig ] we present results for an array of values in the @xmath226 parameter space , noting whether each model is stable ( s ) or unstable ( u ) according to the above criteria . generally speaking , the @xmath91 case shows stability for @xmath227 ( figure [ us_fig]a ) .",
    "similarly to  [ mu_sec ] , we also forced the development of the odd mode of the instability by placing a reflecting boundary at @xmath28 .",
    "for the odd modes , the edge of stability also appears consistent with the criterion @xmath205 , although the measured growth rates are much lower than for the even mode .",
    "the main difference between the @xmath91 and @xmath92 cases ( figure [ us_fig]b ) is that stability in the @xmath92 case requires a much larger value of the richardson number , near @xmath228 .",
    "it is important to stress that this threshold value for @xmath132 depends on the value chosen for the fiducial minimum `` unstable '' growth rate , since there is some subjectivity in the procedure to measure growth rates and the slope of @xmath229 as function of @xmath132 is quite shallow when @xmath92 ( see figure [ growth_fig ] ) . nevertheless , the layer is quite clearly unstable for values of @xmath132 significatively larger that @xmath0 .",
    "since @xmath132 can be thought as a proxy for the layer thickness ( eq . [ [ zmax_eq ] ] ) , the condition that a larger @xmath132 is required for stability when @xmath92 is consistent with the results of  [ mu_sec ] , in which we found that the final dust distribution is thicker when the coriolis terms are turned on .    as a coda for this section",
    ", we comment on the constant @xmath132 distribution adopted here .",
    "@xcite studied the profile determined by a constant-@xmath132 dust distribution and noticed that the space density develops an infinite cusp if the @xmath116 value is large enough .",
    "@xcite interpreted this result as a hint that the gas distribution can only sustain the weight of a mass of dust similar to its own mass , and if surpassed , the dust would precipitate . by numerically integrating our equation ( [ muapprox_eq ] ) for a given @xmath230 , together with the hydrostatic equilibrium condition in equation ( [ rhog_eq ] )",
    ", we find that    @xmath231\\ ] ]    for @xmath232 ( see also eq . [ 22 ] in sekiya 1998 ) .",
    "this means that , for @xmath165 of order unity , @xmath233 implies an exponential growth of the midplane dust abundance .",
    "the onset of a cusp in density would therefore occur ( under the condition @xmath234 ) , for a range of radii @xmath235 ( see eq . [ [ v0maxr_eq ] ] ) , when @xmath116 exceeds @xmath236 , i.  e. , for roughly an order of magnitude dust enhancement .",
    "however , this conclusion appears to be an artifact of the @xmath230 condition . if @xmath132 is permitted to vary with height , with @xmath132 becoming large near the midplane , then @xmath183 varies only linearly rather than exponentially with @xmath116 , and a cusp need not form .",
    "in this work , we have studied the stability of gaseous disks with vertically varying dust abundances and accompanying vertical velocity gradients .",
    "we present both linear analysis of a simple discrete three - layer distribution , and full numerical simulations of a pair of continuous distributions .",
    "we focus on identifying and intercomparing criteria for instability when the coriolis force terms are considered ( @xmath92 ) or disregarded ( @xmath110 ) .",
    "our results indicate that the richardson number @xmath132 is still a good general discriminant for the stability / instability boundary when @xmath92 , but the critical value is larger than the classical result @xmath205 for @xmath91 .    as with the well known two - layer problem , the critical @xmath132 for the discrete three - layer distribution depends on the wavelength of interest .",
    "we argue that wavelengths of order of a few times the layer thickness ( @xmath237 ) are the most relevant , since smaller wavelengths will yield less dust mixing in the non - linear regime , and larger ones have smaller growth rates .",
    "in addition , for realistic vertical distributions with continuous variations of @xmath179 and @xmath54 , waves with @xmath113 would not be unstable . for @xmath144 , @xmath238 is a necessary ( but not sufficient ) condition for instability for the @xmath92 case . in general , when @xmath92 , marginally - unstable modes first appear when @xmath105 drops below @xmath239 .",
    "since @xmath105 is a proxy for the layer thickness , this means that , when coriolis forces are considered , the dust layer is thicker than in the @xmath91 case at the onset of instability . at @xmath240 ,",
    "the increase in thickness is @xmath241 , whereas for @xmath242 , the increase is nearly a factor of three . for the @xmath243 value adopted throughout this work , @xmath244 ( for msn parameters ) , and gi will set in only when @xmath245 @xcite .",
    "the thicker layer at the `` edge '' of khi implies that the dust - to - gas surface density ratio necessary for gi ( neglecting vertical self - gravity ) would increase from the already high value of @xmath246 ( eq . [ [ instb_eq ] ] ) to @xmath247 ( eq . [ [ rotinsb_eq ] ] ) , when coriolis effects are included . , only slightly lower than the value 1.1 for our 3 layer model with @xmath91 . ]",
    "while we certainly do not believe that our results ( assuming full coupling ) can be accurately extrapolated into the dust - dominated regime , this comparison gives a sense of the strong change that can be expected .",
    "the astronomical implication is , of course , that gi is even more difficult to achieve than previously thought .",
    "we note that consideration of even - symmetry ( in @xmath224 , i.  e. midplane - crossing ) modes is important for this problem , although some previous analytic studies ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for example ) have focused only on odd - symmetry modes .",
    "the even - symmetry case becomes unstable at a larger value of @xmath105 than the odd - symmetry case [ which is similar to the two - layer system analyzed by @xcite ] .",
    "the results from our simulations are consistent with the main conclusions drawn from the simple three - layer stability analysis . based on an array of simulations performed that were initialized with @xmath230 vertically",
    ", we found that @xmath228 is the critical value found for the @xmath92 case .",
    "this critical @xmath132 value should be considered an approximate result , since the procedure used to evaluate stability from the simulations involves a certain level of subjectivity .",
    "nevertheless , the dust layer is clearly unstable for @xmath132 values significantly larger than @xmath0 . as with the discrete case",
    ", the larger @xmath132 value also implies a thicker dust layer ; for @xmath248 at the threshold of instability for @xmath92 , the height containing half the dust surface density increases by a factor @xmath249 compared to the corresponding non - rotating model .",
    "of course , both this and other results based on the strong - coupling assumption should be considered carefully when @xmath102 , i.  e. for large @xmath116 .",
    "@xcite point out that precipitation of solids is likely to occur in layers for which @xmath102 . for vertical profiles with @xmath230",
    ", this situation arises first at the midplane , where a density cusp forms for @xmath250 exceeding some critical value ( of order @xmath49 ) .",
    "they therefore conclude that , for gi to develop , @xmath116 needs to be increased from the msn value by a smaller amount than estimates without a density cusp . since our results imply that stability fails at larger @xmath132 ( and hence a thicker dust layer ) than the value assumed by @xcite , the total dust enhacement @xmath116 required before a cusp",
    "is predicted ( and precipitation develops ) would nominally be larger than they concluded .",
    "however , it is not clear that the condition for cusp formation can in fact be obtained and written in a simple way in terms of @xmath116 , for the reason we now discuss .",
    "states which have @xmath230 have been considered of particular interest because they are everywhere at a nominal threshold for instability . however , the proposal that profiles should evolve to such states implicitly depends on an assumption that the localized failure of the kh stability criterion would lead to localized turbulence .",
    "while we chose a constant-@xmath132 setup in the models of  [ rich_sec ] to facilitate comparison with previous work , the results of the simulations in fact call this implicit assumption into question . when exploring @xmath251 for the simulations in ",
    "[ mu_sec ] , in some of our models the @xmath9 stability condition failed only for @xmath252 .",
    "nevertheless , the fastest growing mode in these models had @xmath253 , and the non - linear evolution involved the whole layer , yielding dust mixing at heights over 10 times the initial @xmath70 value .",
    "furthermore , when the simulations were followed until the dust distribution was somewhat homogeneous in the azimuthal direction , the vertical profile did not appear to have a constant @xmath132 value .",
    "it is our view that , as exemplified by these models , a local failure to satisfy a stability criterion which is stated in terms of local quantities need not trigger only local instabilities , i.  e. of wavelengths similar to the thickness of the `` failing '' region . instead",
    ", the wavelength will be similar to the overall velocity gradient , and the height of the waves when they break will be similar to the wavelength . the re - adjustment of the dust distribution that is generated will thus be _ global _ , including regions that initially have @xmath254 .",
    "it is , therefore , not obvious that the `` final , '' or quasi - equilibrium , distribution should be accurately described by a local quantity .",
    "it may be that the marginal state that develops as a result of the competition between dust settling and shear - driven turbulence in fact has a relatively uniform distribution of dust in a central layer , rather than a cusp out of which solids can precipitate .",
    "of course , if particles grow large enough prior to the onset of global dust - layer turbulence , then they may continue to settle faster than the growth rate of the instabilities . since particle growth depends on uncertain sticking efficiency",
    ", however , this question remains open .",
    "observations with newly deployed infrared telescopes should shed some light on the true vertical distribution of solids in proto - planetary disks .    for the technical modeling in this work ,",
    "we have adopted a number of simplifications and idealizations . while we believe that our main conclusions are not sensitive to these assumptions",
    ", it is appropiate to review what they are .",
    "one such simplification is that we consider only models with @xmath255 , and neglect radial shear and tidal forces .",
    "we focused on @xmath255 because these modes typically have the fastest growth rates and largest instability thresholds in terms of @xmath132 .",
    "had we included shear , then @xmath256 would have grown in time as @xmath257 , which would ultimately limit growth of perturbations of a given @xmath258 . in future work , it will be important to examine how , for example , the total amplification of shearing kh wavelets depends on @xmath132 .",
    "other idealizations include neglecting the slip of gas relative to dust , treating the large - scale radial gradient of pressure as fixed in time , and neglecting other sources of turbulence .",
    "gas - dust slip can itself lead to streaming instabilities @xcite . however , either with or without full coupling of the gas and dust , the instabilities that develop depend on the gas having consistent sub - keplerian azimuthal velocities .",
    "this relies on having a consistent radial pressure gradient ; in principle , this condition could be invalidated if there are sufficient pressure perturbations induced by turbulence or large - scale waves in the disk .",
    "the ratio of such terms , @xmath259 , could be significant even for moderate amplitude perturbations with @xmath260 . in future work , we intend to explore these and other dynamical processes that may affect the settling and mixing of solids in dusty disks .",

    "so , a good approximation for the opening of such stability gap is @xmath295 .",
