    "magnetic reconnection is thought to provide the pathway for energy release in solar flares and other phenomena where energy is accumulated in the magnetic fields and currents of ionized high temperature plasmas .",
    "what has remained difficult to understand has been the triggering and speed of the process itself , which , given the extremely large lundquist ( @xmath3 ) and reynolds ( @xmath4 ) numbers , implies that currents must collapse to extremely small scales before anything close to realistic timescales are approached .",
    "indeed , an active region in the solar corona has a typical spatial scale @xmath5 of about @xmath6 cm , a magnetic field @xmath7 g , density @xmath8@xmath9 and a temperature @xmath10k , hence a macroscopic lundquist number @xmath11 . a flare emits a total energy of about @xmath12ergs on a typical timescale of a few minutes , which can not be explained by simple magnetic field diffusion or by a reconnecting instability occurring on the macroscopic scale itself .",
    "it has been suggested then that the reconnection trigger might only be provided by kinetic effects , beyond the ( resistive ) magnetohydrodynamic description of the plasma , or , alternatively , by the fast plasmoid instability of sweet - parker current sheets ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "it has been predicted recently , using linear stability analyses , that the tearing mode instability should grow on ideal timescales ( `` ideal '' tearing , or it ) once the inverse aspect ratio @xmath13 of a current sheet reaches a scale @xmath14 , preventing the formation of the paradigmatic sweet - parker current sheet ( sp ) for which @xmath15 , about 150 times smaller than @xmath1 for @xmath16 and even smaller for greater @xmath3 .",
    "even more interestingly , the ( linear ) asymptotic tearing instability in thin current sheets at arbitrary aspect ratios predicts that the maximum growth rate normalized to the macroscopic alfvn time increases nonlinearly with the aspect ratio , @xmath17 ( see also eq .",
    "( [ km ] ) below ) : this suggests that collapse to the critical threshold thickness may provide the trigger for fast reconnection , where `` fast '' here is meant for dynamics occurring on the ideal timescale  @xcite .    at",
    "the intermediate lundquist numbers usual to simulations , say , @xmath18 , the presence of plasma flows into ( inflows ) , and along ( outflows ) the current sheet affects the scaling of the critical threshold for it by inducing the formation of more elongated current sheets , that is , of layers having inverse aspect ratios @xmath19 , with @xmath20  @xcite .",
    "therefore , with the lundquist number not sufficiently large , the distinction between the it scaling and the sp scaling might seem academic .",
    "nevertheless , the it current sheet instability , as typical for the tearing mode , produces a quasi - singular inner layer @xmath21 , whose inverse aspect ratio follows the sp scaling @xmath22 .",
    "such inner layer is however non - stationary , with inflows and outflows increasing exponentially in time  their ratio incidentally does not follow the sp scaling , but rather @xmath23together with the amplitude of the reconnecting field : seen from this inner layer , one may interpret the dynamics in terms of the  embedded reconnection \" scenario  @xcite , leading to greater energy storage and more efficient dissipation at the extremely large @xmath3 values of the solar corona .",
    "here we study the onset and evolution of the tearing instability within a single collapsing current sheet by means of resistive mhd simulations at @xmath24 . in the following paragraphs",
    "we first show that the transition to a fast tearing mode instability takes place during the collapse when the predicted threshold inverse aspect ratio @xmath14 is reached .",
    "secondly , we show that the secondary current sheets formed nonlinearly give rise to recursive tearing instabilities at increasingly smaller scales and faster super - alfvnic timescales , which may also be well described by the flow - modified  ideal \" tearing criterion and instability .",
    "the nonlinear evolution leads to a complete disruption in a timescale estimated at 0.05 percent of the macroscopic alfvn time once initial tearing is triggered , which we model here in a corrected version of the fractal reconnection scenario first proposed by  @xcite . though the two - dimensional instability of current sheets and its subsequent nonlinear evolution within resistive mhd has been studied before , it is shown here for the first time that the it instability scenario , appropriately modified by the effect of the reconnection velocity flows , provides a quantitative description of the various stages in the evolution of a reconnecting current sheet , including hierarchical secondary island formation and disruption .",
    "our results also provide a coherent framework through which previous simulations  @xcite may be more completely understood .",
    "let us consider a ( local ) current sheet of inverse aspect ratio @xmath13 , as the one given in eq .",
    "( [ har ] ) , with alfvn speed @xmath25 and magnetic diffusivity @xmath26 , in a high @xmath27 , constant density plasma .",
    "we assume , as in  @xcite , that the current sheet is collapsing via some external process on a timescale  @xmath28 , which we take of the order of the ideal timescale , @xmath29 .",
    "we extend the linear analysis of the incompressible tearing instability to this time - dependent case by defining an instantaneous growth rate @xmath30 , @xmath31 being the wave number along the sheet , where explicit time - dependence is introduced by the evolving aspect ratio @xmath32 itself .",
    "in the static case , two regimes describe the unstable spectrum of a current sheet : the so called small @xmath33 regime , for wavelengths close to the instability threshold ( or const.-@xmath34  @xcite , for @xmath35 for our equilibrium ) , and the large @xmath33 regime ( or non const.-@xmath34  @xcite , for @xmath36 ) .",
    "these two regimes have wave vectors @xmath31 that lie to the right and to the left of the fastest growing mode @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 , respectively  @xcite . the wave vector and the growth rate of the fastest growing mode are given by  @xcite : @xmath40 similarly to eqs .",
    "( [ km ] ) , the growth rates in the small and large @xmath33 regimes also increase with the aspect ratio ; however , their values tend to zero in the asymptotic limit @xmath41 , and the full @xmath42 dispersion relation becomes rapidly peaked around  @xmath37 ( cfr .",
    "fig .  1 of  @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , both the small and large @xmath33 regimes can be neglected in the framework of fast reconnection , since the development of the instability is controlled by the evolution of the fastest growing mode described by eqs .",
    "( [ km ] ) .",
    "take the current sheet given by eq .",
    "( [ har ] ) , for example : the unstable spectrum lies within the range @xmath43 . from this condition and the first of eqs .",
    "( [ km ] ) it follows that the regime described by eqs .",
    "( [ km ] ) always exists once @xmath44 , i.e. once @xmath45 .",
    "the second of eqs .",
    "( [ km ] ) shows that the growth rate becomes ideal when approaching the critical width @xmath14 ( much smaller than @xmath46 ) from above : the transition to `` ideal '' tearing during collapse therefore occurs on the fastest growing mode . in conclusion ,",
    "a collapse with @xmath47 naturally drives a sudden switch from a quasi - stable state  growth rate depending on a negative power of @xmath3to an ideally unstable  one .",
