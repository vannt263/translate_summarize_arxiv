    "background sources strongly lensed by galaxies and galaxy clusters that exhibit flux variations in time can be used as powerful probes , because they make it possible to measure the relative time delays between their multiple images . as @xcite first suggested ,",
    "time delays are useful because they depend sensitively on both the cosmic expansion rate and the gravitational potential of the lens . while the positions of the images of lensed galaxies depend on the derivative of the potential , time delays are directly proportional to differences in the potential .",
    "@xcite examined the utility of time - delay measurements of a strongly lensed , multiply imaged , resolved supernova ( sn ) , but such an object was not found in the following five decades .",
    "a handful of sn in galaxy - cluster fields have been magnified ( @xmath34@xmath4 ) by the cluster s potential @xcite , but none has been multiply imaged .",
    "a luminous h - poor sn at redshift @xmath5 @xcite was shown to be a highly magnified ( @xmath6 ) sn  ia @xcite , but the only existing exposures , taken from the ground , could not resolve multiple images of the sn .",
    "although strongly lensed sn have eluded detection for 50 years , the discovery of multiply imaged quasars beginning in 1979 @xcite has made it possible to measure time delays for more than 20 systems ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for a subset of multiply imaged quasars with simple , early - type galaxy lenses , it has been possible to precisely predict the delay arising from the gravitational potential and thereby to measure an absolute distance scale and @xmath7 geometrically ( e.g. , * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . although they are more difficult to find , strongly lensed sn hold great promise as tools for time - delay cosmography @xcite . in comparison with quasars light curves ,",
    "those of sn are relatively simple , and the peak luminosities of sn  ia @xcite and ( with less precision ) sn  iip ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) can be calibrated absolutely , thus providing a measurement of lensing magnification .",
    "@xcite reported the discovery of , the first strongly lensed sn resolved into multiple images , in the 1149 @xcite galaxy cluster field in _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ images taken on 10 november 2014 ( ut dates are used throughout this paper ) .",
    "those exposures , collected as part of the grism lens - amplified survey from space ( glass ; pi treu ; go-13459 ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , revealed four resolved images of the background sn arranged in an einstein cross configuration around an elliptical cluster member .",
    "models of the complex potential of the galaxy cluster and early - type galaxy lens suggest that three of the four images are magnified by up to a factor of @xmath820 @xcite .",
    "models of the massive 1149  cluster [ ( @xmath9 m@xmath10 ; @xcite ] produced soon after the discovery predicted that  would appear within several years in a different host - galaxy image close to the cluster core , @xmath11 from images s1s4 @xcite .",
    "we adopt the identifier `` sx '' for this new image , following @xcite . here",
    "we report the appearance of the image sx of sn refsdal in _ hst _ images ( pi : kelly ; go-14199 ) taken on .    in models of the 1149  cluster lens ,",
    "the galaxy - cluster gravitational potential is constrained by varying combinations of strong - lensing constraints , including the positions and redshifts of multiply imaged background galaxies , the positions of the  images s1s4 , and locations of bright clumps within s host galaxy .",
    "the potential ( or surface mass density ) is also parameterized in a variety of ways , often using the positions or light distributions of cluster galaxies as constraints . given the complexity of the cluster potential , it is unlikely that measurement of time delays between the  images can be used for precision cosmology as suggested by @xcite .",
    "however , if one adopts a fixed set of cosmological parameters , then time delays and magnification ratios can be used to measure the difference in the potential and its derivatives between the positions of multiple images , thus providing a powerful local test of lens models .    to sharpen this test ,",
    "several lens modeling teams have refined their predictions for the relative time delay and magnification of image sx .",
    "@xcite identified an improved set of multiply imaged galaxies using additional data collected soon before and after the discovery of the sn .",
    "systems were discovered or confirmed from _ hst _ wfc3 g102 and g141 grism spectra ( pi treu ; go-13459 ) , thirty orbits of g141 grism spectra taken to determine the spectroscopic type of the sn ( pi kelly ; go-14041 ; @xcite ; brammer et al . , in prep . ) , deep vlt - muse observations ( pi grillo ; grillo et al .",
    "2016 , submitted ) , keck / deimos observations ( pi jha ) , as well as frontier fields observations of the 1149 field that began shortly after discovery ( pi lotz ; go-13504 ) .",
    "these data provided 429 spectroscopic redshifts in the field of macsj1149.5 + 2223 , including 170 cluster members and 23 multiple images of 10 different galaxies . with the improved dataset , @xcite organized 5 independent lens - modeling teams which produced 7 separate predictions for the time delay . in a parallel effort",
    ", @xcite used new gemini gmos and part of the vlt - muse data ( pi grillo ) , as well as frontier fields photometry , to generate improved constraints on the cluser potential and new predictions for the time delay and magnification of image sx .",
    "these revised models largely favored delays of less than one year and predicted that image sx would be significantly fainter than images s1s3 , by a factor of 34 . together , these predictions indicated that image sx could plausibly have been detected as soon as _ hst _ could observe the 1149 field beginning on 30 october 2015 . from late july through late october , it had been too close to the sun to be observed .",
    "importantly , all of these modeling efforts were completed before the first realistic opportunity to detect image sx on 30 october 2015 , making these truly _ blind _ predictions .    here",
    "we present a direct test of the lens model predictions , as we revisit the 1149 field and identify the appearance of the anticipated fifth image of . in @xcite , we classify sn refsdal as the explosion of an h - rich compact massive star broadly similar to sn 1987a , and in @xcite we measure time delays between images s1 through s4 .",

    "we measure photometric uncertainties by planting and recovering 1000 fake stars ( copies of a model psf ) in the vicinity of the sn position .",
    "a principal inference we make is to constrain the time delay and magnification of image sx relative to image s1 .",
    "we simulate potential light curves of image sx by shifting the light curve of image s1 in time and demagnifying it . to construct a simple model of the light curve of image s1 ,",
    "we fit separate second - order polynomials to its _ f125w _ and _ f160w _ flux measurements ( see @xcite and @xcite ) . across a grid of time delays and magnifications ,",

    "we show model predictions for the relative time delay and magnification between sx and s1 from several teams reported by @xcite as well as independent predictions by @xcite .",
    "while the other plotted predictions were made blind to the observations beginning on , the two predictions plotted in figure  [ fig : delaymu ] with a dashed line , `` zitrin - c '' and `` jauzac - s , '' were updated at a later date ; hence , these last two are not truly blind predictions , although they incorporate no additional data .",
    "`` zitrin - c , '' an improvement over the `` zitrin - g '' model , allows the early - type lens galaxy to be freely weighted to assure that the critical curves pass between the four einstein - cross images . in the case of `` jauzac - s ,",
    "'' the authors addressed an issue with the use of lenstool @xcite for computing time delays .",
    "lenstool allows the multiple images of a strongly lensed object such as sn refsdal to map to differing positions on the source plane , which can translate into an aberration of the predicted relative time delays . for `` jauzac - s , '' the authors estimate a single , common position for sn refsdal in the source plane and analytically estimate improved model time delays using this common position ( see section 5.2.2 of @xcite ) .",
    "lensed sn provide a powerful means to test the accuracy of the lens models of the foreground deflector , or to provide additional input constraints ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "previous tests have been based on sn that are magnified but not multiply imaged @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite discovered a type ia sn magnified by a factor of @xmath18 by a galaxy - cluster potential and found that its calibrated luminosity was in tension with some  but not all  models of the cluster potential .",
    "with  we have for the first time been able to test predictions for both the lensing time delay and the magnification .",
    "this is important because the time delay depends on the difference in gravitational potential , while magnification depends on a combination of second derivatives , and therefore the two observables test different aspects of the potential . in principle , time delays are much less sensitive than magnification ratios to millilensing and microlensing ; they should therefore be more robustly predicted .",
    "it is important to keep in mind that all of these tests are local , and thus a larger sample is needed to assess the global goodness of fit of every model .",
    "nevertheless , these tests are an extremely valuable probe of systematics .",
    "in fact , as discussed by @xcite , the uncertainties reported by modelers do not include all sources of systematic errors .",
    "for example , systematic uncertainties arising from unmodeled millilensing , residual mass - sheet degeneracy , and multiplane lensing are very difficult to calculate and are thus not included .",
    "the lensed - sn tests provide estimates of the amplitude of the unknown uncertainties .",
    "other known sources of errors are not included either .",
    "for example , a 3% uncertainty in the hubble constant @xcite implies a 3% uncertainty in time delays ( i.e. , @xmath8 days for a year - long delay ) .",
    "furthermore , the uncertainties are typically highly non - gaussian , so the 95% confidence interval is not simply twice as wide as the 68% one .",
    "with models of the 1149  galaxy - cluster potential , the appearance of sn refsdal in november 2014 as an einstein cross became an augury of its future arrival @xmath11 away in a different image of its host galaxy .",
    "the detection of the reappearance here shows the power of modern - day predictions using models of the distribution of matter in galaxy clusters and the general theory of relativity .",
    "the timing and brightness of light from  in image sx is approximately in agreement with predictions , implying that for most models , unknown systematic uncertainties can not be substantially larger than random uncertainties . at the same time",
    ", this first detection provides some discriminatory power : not all models fare equally well .",
    "grillo - g , oguri - g , oguri - a , and sharon - a appear to be the ones that match the observations most closely . in general , most models seem to predict a slightly higher magnification ratio than observed , or shorter delays .    from the light curves of images s1s4 of sn refsdal",
    ", we can already anticipate how the brightness of image sx will evolve .",
    "imaging program will continue to measure the light curve of image sx past peak brightness through 2017 ( pi kelly ; go-14199 ) and constrain the time delay and magnification of image sx relative to images s1s4 to within 12% .",
    "these measurements will make it possible to discriminate among the model predictions with improved precision .",
