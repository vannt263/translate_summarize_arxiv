    "however , the two motifs of particles 7 and 8 acquire different energies in the transcription , which appears to make it necessary to split them into subspecies .",
    "given the indeterminate nature of rules ( [ eq : angh ] ) in this process , it requires that the combinatorial analysis be performed from scratch for the new subspecies including their statistical interactions with all other species . in the situation at hand ,",
    "this can be avoided .",
    "consider the four motifs @xmath315 , @xmath316 , @xmath317 , @xmath318 of particles 7 and 8 . in the context of ( [ eq:1 ] )",
    "all four have the same energy at @xmath9 but the first two have spin @xmath66 and the last two spin @xmath70 , producing different zeeman energies . in the context of ( [ eq : b-1 ] )",
    "all four have zero spin but the energy of the first and the last is different from the energy of the second and the third .",
    "can we switch the second and the fourth motif such that particles 7 and 8 each have a definite energy again ?",
    "the answer is affirmative .",
    "the switch leaves all results of the combinatorial analysis invariant provided the merger of species 15  &  16 into @xmath159 is in place .",
    "we thus end up with 13 species of particles .",
    "their specifications are listed in table  [ tab : specsalt ] .    the statistical mechanical analysis of these particles proceeds analogous to that reported in sec .  [ sec : os - d ] .",
    "the particles have the same motifs ( albeit transcribed and slightly shuffled ) but different energies .",
    "the same motifs encode different physical structures and produce different kinds of ordering in the limit @xmath319 . adding a zeeman term to ( [ eq : a-1 ] ) poses no serious challenge .",
    "it requires that the mergers of 3  &  4 , 5  &  6 , 1  &  2 be reversed and that the merger of 15  &  16 be kept .",
    "the statistical mechanical analysis then proceeds with 16 species and with zeeman energies @xmath320 added to @xmath35 .",
