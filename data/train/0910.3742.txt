    "damped lyman-@xmath0 absorption systems ( dlas ) are believed to be the precursors of modern day galaxies , containing at least 80% of the neutral gas mass density of the universe @xcite . as the name suggests , dlas are identified through their heavily damped absorption features , due to the large columns of neutral hydrogen ( @xmath3 ) through which the background quasar is viewed .",
    "the 21-cm spin - flip transition is of interest since it traces the cool component of the gas , with the comparison of the 21-cm absorption strength to the total neutral hydrogen column giving the gas spin temperature ( @xmath4 ) for a fully absorbed emission region ( @xmath5 ) [ see equ .",

    "searches for 21-cm absorption in dlas exhibit a @xmath6 detection rate , the detections occuring predominately at low redshift ( @xmath7 ) , suggesting an increase in the @xmath8 ratio with redshift , which could be due to higher spin temperatures and/or lower covering factors .    in order to shed light",
    "on which is the predominant factor , we have undertaken searches with the green bank ( gbt ) and giant metrewave radio ( gmrt ) telescopes . in particular , we aim to :    1 .",
    "test the hypothesis of @xcite that 21-cm absorption should be readily detectable at high redshift , despite the large @xmath8 ratios , by searching for 21-cm absorption in dlas which lie towards compact radio sources .",
    "2 .   test the hypothesis of @xcite that the spin temperature does not continue to increase with redshift , by searching in previously unsearched high redshift ( @xmath9 ) dlas .",
    "test the line strength  metallicity correlation ( @xmath10[m / h ] anti - correlation ) of @xcite , which suggests that several , currently undetected , dlas should be readily detectable in 21-cm absorption .    we have observed a dozen dlas and sub - dlas and in this paper we present and discuss the results in the context of the above issues .",
    "prior to the recent high redshift detections ( @xcite , discussed below ) , all of the dlas detected in 21-cm absorption were at redshifts of @xmath11 , where there is also an approximately equal number of non - detections .",
    "@xcite , interpreted this as the low redshift dlas having a mix of spin temperatures , whereas the high redshift absorbers have exclusively high spin temperatures .",
    "however , all of the @xmath12 absorbers have large dla - to - qso angular diameter distance ratios ( @xmath13 ) , whereas the @xmath14 absorbers have a mix of ratios , due to the geometry effects of a flat expanding universe @xcite : those with low ratios are almost always detected in 21-cm absorption , whereas those with high ratios tend not to be detected , which is how the `` spin temperature '' distribution of @xcite is segregated .",
    "this strongly suggests , on the grounds of geometry alone and not allowing for various absorber and emitter sizes , that the covering factor , rather than the spin temperature , is the crucial criterion in determining the detectability of 21-cm absorption , where an absorber at high redshift will always cover the background quasar much less effectively than an equivalent absorber ",
    "quasar system at low redshift .",
    "furthermore , @xcite had previously suggested that the non - detections at high redshift could be due to low covering factors , as opposed to elevated spin temperatures , and so 21-cm absorption should be readily detectable in high redshift dlas towards very compact radio sources .    with the green bank telescope we therefore embarked upon a survey for  21-cm absorption in the known radio - illuminated dlas yet to be searched , prioritised by a small radio source size .",
    "for this we used the sloan digital sky survey damped ly@xmath0 survey data release 1 @xcite combined with the previously unsearched systems @xcite , giving 57 dlas occulting radio - loud ( @xmath15 jy ) quasars .",
    "we then short - listed the dlas and sub - dlas in which the 21-cm transition was redshifted into the prime focus 342 and 450 mhz bands and which were located towards the four most compact radio sources ",

    ".the radio source sizes at @xmath16 of the qsos illuminating the dlas searched ( table [ res ] ) used for selecting the gbt 2006 targets .",
    "these were obtained from the highest resolution radio images available , closest in frequency to the redshifted 21-cm values ( @xmath16 ) , although 0454 + 039 , 0528250 and 1418064 have since been imaged at closer frequencies @xcite . for the remainder of the dla sample refer to @xcite .",

    "bear in mind , however , that the fwhms for the non - detections have been estimated ( sect .",

    "furthermore , the kolmogorov - smirnov test treats the upper limits as actual values and higher sensitivity limits at high redshift are required in order to confirm the similarities between the samples apparent in table [ stats ] .",
    "performing a kolmogorov - smirnov test on the redshift distributions between the detections and non - detections , thus requiring no assumptions , gives an 11% probability ( significant at @xmath25 ) that these are drawn from the same sample .",
    "additionally , the non - detections have a higher mean redshift  @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) , compared to @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) for the detections .",
    "therefore , we can not rule out that the @xmath30 distribution differs between the two redshift regimes . although the relative contributions of @xmath4 and @xmath31 are unknown , the fact that the largest differences are seen for @xmath32 ( where @xmath33_{z < 1}}=1200 $ ]  k",

    "while we are discussing statistical trends over the whole sample , it should be emphasised that the 21-cm absorption searches yield a very heterogeneous sample , with each survey having different selection criteria ( including the three here ) , resulting in a mix of detections and non - detections across various absorber morphologies ( where these are known , fig .",

    "@xmath34 for all of the absorbers , or just the ratio being maintained , there may be no large differences between the low and high redshift samples .",
    "furthermore , since @xmath37 , the ordinate in fig .",
    "[ toverf ] represents the maximum possible spin temperatures for the detections of which there are now several at @xmath38 .",
    "this indicates that high redshifts do not _ necessarily _ entail high spin temperatures , as advocated by @xcite [ although a larger fraction of warm gas @xcite does not exclude the possibility of cold clumps ] .",
    "case in points against exclusively high spin temperatures at high redshift are ,    1 .   the 21-cm detection at @xmath39 towards 0311 + 430 @xcite , which has one of the lowest `` spin temperatures '' yet found , i.e. @xmath40  k. 2 .",

    "the other 17 dlas in which  has been detected ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "these are generally at @xmath43 , although they may represent a specific class of absorber within the general dla population @xcite .",
    "lastly , @xcite also noted a correlation between the integrated 21-cm optical depth and the  column density .    updating this for the dlas ( fig .",
    "[ tau - n ] ) and incorporating the upper limits ( as above ) , there is a probability of @xmath44 that the correlation occurs by chance .",
    "this corresponds to a @xmath45 significance , and since the gradient is @xmath46 , suggests that , on the whole , the ratio of spin temperature to covering factor is a constant for dlas , although there is some considerable scatter .",
    "as mentioned in sect . [ gbt06 ] , @xcite suggested that , contrary to the high redshift equals high spin temperature argument of @xcite , 21-cm absorption should be readily detectable at high redshift towards compact radio sources , where the covering factor is maximised . at the time of writing up the results presented in @xcite , this",
    "was confirmed by the detection of 21-cm absorption in the highest redshift example to date , at @xmath47 towards 0438436 ( @xcite ) , which has a background radio source size of only @xmath48 at 5 ghz @xcite . following this , since submitting the proposal for the 2006 gbt observations ,",
    "21-cm absorption has been confirmed at yet higher redshift , @xmath49 towards 0201 + 113 ( @xcite , see also @xcite ) , as well as at @xmath39 towards 0311 + 430 @xcite .",

    "however , all of the gbt 2006 targets ( sect .",
    "[ gbt06 ] ) were selected before the arguments of @xcite were formulated , and so all of the 2006 targets ( and two of the three just mentioned ) , are all at high redshift , and will therefore be disadvantaged with respect to the dla - to - qso angular diameter distance ratios .",
    "showing these in fig .",
    "[ 2-distance - z ] ( top ) , we see that all but one of our target dlas ( for which we have limits ) , are indeed at angular diameter distance ratios of @xmath57 , due to their high redshift selection . for a given absorber and radio source size , this will disadvantage the effective covering factor ( possibly giving the observed @xmath33_{z \\geq 1}}\\approx2\\,\\overline{[t_{\\rm          spin}/{f}]_{z < 1}}$ ] , sect .",

    "[ 2-distance - z ] ( bottom ) we have flagged each of the dlas according to how many times larger than @xmath58 the frequency at which the source size is measured , i.e. @xmath59 .",
    "the recently published low frequency vlba imaging of @xcite accounts for many of the `` green '' values , where @xmath60 . since a number of these sources",
    "appear resolved , we have recalculated the extents , rather than using the deconvolved sizes quoted in @xcite , which are often smaller than the beam and may be unphysical ( e.g. @xmath61 pc for 0405331 ) . ] .",
    "however , all of our non - detections ( which are predominately at @xmath62 ) , also occult similar radio source sizes . of these ,",
    "three of the sizes are not as reliable ( orange symbols where @xmath63 , cf .",
    "green where @xmath64 ) , although as seen from fig .",
    "[ toverf ] , only three published non - detections are sufficiently sensitive to detect @xmath65  k at @xmath66 ( sect .",
    "[ gmrt08 ] ) .",
    "while , due to geometry effects , a high angular diameter distance will disadvantage the absorption cross - section in comparison to the same absorber placed at a low angular diameter distance , with the 21-cm searches spanning a look - back time range of 12 gyr there are also evolutionary effects to be considered . for instance , an evolution in the morphologies of the absorbing galaxies is expected to result in different metallicities and these heavy elements can provide cooling pathways for the diffuse gas ( @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , it is shown that the relative mix of the cold neutral medium ( cnm , where @xmath67 k and @xmath68 ) and the warm neutral medium ( wnm , @xmath69 k and @xmath70 ) can be affected by the metallicity @xcite .    at low redshifts , where the dla hosts can be imaged directly",
    ", the absorbing galaxies appear to be a mix of spirals , dwarf and lsbs ( e.g. @xcite ) and , in general , large galaxies appear to be more populous at low redshift with smaller morphologies becoming more common at high redshifts @xcite . therefore , in the more compact absorbing galaxies , where the metallicities are lower than in the larger spirals ( see sect . [ lsmc ] )",
    ", we may expect the gas to be more dominated by the wnm and , as shown by @xcite , @xmath30 is anti - correlated with the metallicity ( see sect .",
    "[ lsmc ] ) .",
    "however , although the metallicity is itself anti - correlated with the look - back time ( @xcite ) , no [ m / h]@xmath71 correlation is seen for the 21-cm searched sample @xcite , and , as seen in fig .",
    "[ 2-distance - z ] , very few morphologies are known for these at @xmath12 .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath30[m / h ] anti - correlation is consistent with _ either _ the spin temperature being lower or the covering factor being larger at high metallicities , with the larger galaxies likely to have high values of @xmath34 as well as [ m / h ] . although the @xmath30 degeneracy is unbreakable , it is possible that both factors contribute and that the values of [ m / h ] , @xmath4 and @xmath31 are in fact interwoven @xcite .",
    "in addition to decreasing metallicities , the increase in the background ultra - violet flux will increase the ionisation fraction of the gas @xcite , in addition to raising its spin temperature @xcite , an effect also seen in associated systems , where 21-cm absorption has never yet been detected in the host galaxy of a quasar with @xmath72 w hz@xmath73 @xcite .",
    "therefore , as well as always having large angular diameter distance ratios and lower metallicities , high redshift absorption systems will generally be subject to higher ultra - violet fluxes , although for intervening absorbers the effect will not be as severe as for associated absorbers .",
    "nevertheless , this could be the cause of many of the @xmath30 lower limits at @xmath74 ( fig .",
    "[ toverf ] ) , although , again , such heated gas could have a significantly lower 21-cm absorption cross - section as well as a higher temperature .      in order to consider the radio source size in conjunction with the ratio of the angular diameter distances , we calculate the extent of absorber required to fully cover the radio source ( fig .",
    "[ dla_schem ] ) and show this against the normalised line    strength , @xmath75 ( fig .",
    "[ size - z ] ) .    from this",
    "we see a correlation between the extent of the absorber and the 21-cm absorption strength for the detections . for the 18 detections",
    "this is significant at @xmath76 , falling to @xmath77 for the 12 detections with @xmath64 ( `` green '' ) , with the non - detections exhibiting no correlation whatsoever ( bringing the significance for the whole 39 strong sample down to @xmath78 ) ) , gives @xmath79 & @xmath80 , respectively . ] .",
    "the fit in fig .",
    "[ size - z ] suggests that the non - detections which have been searched sufficiently deeply , ( i.e. neglecting the two with @xmath81 ) , may require large absorbers ( @xmath82  kpc scales ) in order to achieve effective covering factors .",
    "as is seen from the figure , several detections also occupy this regime , although these tend to be spiral galaxies . therefore , like @xcite , and as discussed in @xcite , the majority of non - detections ( which are at high redshift and have unknown morphologies ) may be non - spirals .",
    "although , unlike @xcite , we again suggest that may be their small sizes , in addition to / rather than high mean spin temperatures , which may be responsible for their weak line strengths .",
    "the covering factor can be defined as @xmath83 ^ 2 $ ] @xcite , meaning that , in general is the actual extent of the absorber , rather than the extent minimum required to cover @xmath84 . ] , the ordinate in fig .",
    "[ size - z ] is equivalent to @xmath85 .",
    "this therefore suggests , at least for the detections , that the line strength increases with the size of the 21-cm absorption region , a trend which is apparent , even when the absorber size is weighed down by the @xmath86 factor . and , in general , from the normalised line strength ,",
    "@xmath87 that is , @xmath88 , which makes sense in terms of both covering factor and spin temperature  a larger absorber implies a larger covering factor , as well as the possibility of a lower spin temperature . presuming that this is not dominated by the numerator , this _",
    "suggest that the larger absorbing galaxies are subject to lower spin temperatures ( @xcite and references therein ) . however , one interpretation of the distribution of the non - detections along the ordinate in fig .",
    "[ size - z ] is that for a given absorption cross - section ( i.e. assuming the same @xmath89 for all the dlas ) , the covering factor is generally lower than for a number of the detections .",
    "note that , in addition to geometry effects , it is possible that these lower covering factors could also be caused by lower beam filling factors , introduced by structure ( `` clumpiness '' ) in the absorbing gas , which may be behind the 21-cm variability seen at @xmath90 towards 1127145 @xcite and at @xmath49 towards 0201 + 113 @xcite .",
    "@xcite also note from their large survey of mgii absorption systems that the decreasing number density of 21-cm absorbers with redshift runs counter to that of the lyman-  and @xmath91   mgii absorbers @xcite .",
    "this is attributed to a significant evolution in either the cnm filling factor or the covering factor , the former of which could be the result of a relatively extensive wnm , thus indicating a higher mean harmonic spin temperature @xcite , although the larger fractions of warm gas would not exclude the presence of cold clumps . either or",
    "both of these scenarios would be tied up in the @xmath8 degeneracy .",
    "nevertheless , 21-cm detection rates are significantly lower at high redshift and the filling factor of the cnm , through either its effect on @xmath4 or @xmath34 , could be a major contributor to this .      addressing the 21-cm line strength ",

    ", 21-cm absorption may not have been detected towards 0528250 , on the grounds that , with an absorption redshift very close to that of the emission redshift ( both at @xmath93 , @xcite and references therein ) , the absorber is possibly located in the host of the background quasar .",
    "we may therefore expect the neutral gas to be subject to excitation effects seen in other high redshift 21-cm absorption searches @xcite .",
    "however , the presence of h@xmath94 in the absorber suggests that the gas is relatively cool with @xmath95 k ( @xcite ) and so this is unlikely .    in any case , referring to fig .",
    "[ fovert - m ] , the limit is not overly low in comparison to 0438436 ( the detection at [ m / h]@xmath96 , @xmath97 [ k@xmath73 ] ) and there is also the possibility that we have missed the line , with our limit only being good over the redshift range @xmath99 ( sect .",

    "nevertheless , the fact that the mean @xmath8 difference is largest for a redshift partition of @xmath17 is consistent with the geometry effects noted by @xcite .",

    "2 .   the observations since @xcite confirm that the 21-cm line strength is correlated with the total neutral hydrogen column density , which further suggests that the spin temperature to covering factor ratio ( @xmath8 ) is _ roughly _ constant , for both the detections and non - detections ( fig .",
