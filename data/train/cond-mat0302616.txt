    "nonlinear one - dimensional dissipative systems at their critical points ( like chaos threshold , bifurcation points , etc ) have become one of the vivid areas of research since 1997 , after pioneering work of tsallis et al .",
    "one of the relevant reason for this , in our opinion , was that they were able to constitute one of the first methods of inferring the entropic index @xmath0 of nonextensive entropy @xcite    s_q= , and consequently determining the proper thermostatistics which the system under consideration obeys , from the microscopic dynamics of the system .",
    "this method depends on the measure of the divergence of initially nearby orbits .",
    "more precisely , the effect of any uncertainty on initial conditions exhibits , for periodic and chaotic orbits , an exponential temporal evolution as @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the standard lyapunov exponent , @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the uncertainties at times 0 and @xmath5 ( @xmath6 for periodic cases , and @xmath7 for chaotic ones ) ; whereas at critical points ( e.g. , chaos threshold ) this feature is related to a power - law type such as    ( t)= ^1/(1-q_mix ) where @xmath8 is a generalized version of the lyapunov exponent ( here , @xmath9 stands for _ mixing _ and the aim of this notation will be transparent soon ) .",
    "this equation corresponds to power - law growth of the upper bounds of a complex time dependence of @xmath10 and these upper bounds allow us to infer the proper value of @xmath11 for the system under consideration .",
    "let us call this method i of finding the proper @xmath11 of a given dynamical system .",
    "the second method ( method ii ) is based on the geometrical aspects of the critical attractor of the dynamical system at the chaos threshold .",
    "scaling arguments have shown that the appropriate @xmath11 is related to the multifractal structure of the critical dynamical attractor by @xcite    = - ( q_mix < 1 ) where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the end points of the multifractal singularity spectrum of the critical attractor and characterize the most concentrated and most rarefied regions respectively on the attractor .",
    "this fascinating relation relates power - law sensitivity or mixing ( left - hand side ) with purely geometrical quantities ( right - hand side ) and constitutes another independent method for inferring the proper @xmath11 of the dynamical system under study .",
    "finally , a third method ( method iii ) has been proposed for obtaining @xmath11 , dealing with the entropy increase rates @xcite .",
    "this method is the one where nonextensive entropy @xmath14 enters directly and consequently it provides also a justification for the use of notation @xmath0 within the two previous methods .",
    "the procedure for method iii is the following : we first partition the phase space into @xmath15 cells , then we choose one of these cells ( randomly or not ) and locate @xmath16 initial conditions all inside this cell . at any time @xmath5 , we have @xmath17 points in each cell ( naturally @xmath18 ) and thus we can define a set of probabilities through @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) , which enable us to calculate the entropy @xmath21 . using this procedure , one can define a generalized version of the kolmogorov - sinai entropy as @xmath22 , and the proper @xmath11 value of a given system is the one for which the entropy production @xmath23 is finite . if @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) , @xmath23 diverges ( vanishes ) .",
    "these three independent methods ( from now on referred to as _ mixing - based approach _ ) have already been tested and verified with numerical calculations for a number of one - dimensional dissipative systems such as the logistic map @xcite , @xmath26-logistic map family @xcite , the circle map @xcite , @xmath26-circular map family @xcite , asymmetric logistic map family @xcite and the single site map @xcite .",
    "quite remarkably , it is found that all three methods give one and the same value for @xmath11 of a given system .",
    "it is worth mentioning here that all these numerical findings have been supported very recently by an analytical work @xcite .",
    "we can now turn our attention to the second approach , which will be referred to as _ relaxation - based approach_. this approach has been developed by one of us and his collaborators @xcite and it is based on investigating numerically the critical temporal evolution of the volume of the phase space occupied by an ensemble of initial conditions spread over the _ entire _ phase space . in that sense , this approach differs from the mixing - based approach , where a set of initial conditions spread in the vicinity of the inflection point is used . in the beginning of time , all cells are occupied and @xmath14 is bounded by the equiprobability as @xmath27 . as time evolves , the number of occupied cells ( say @xmath28 ) starts contracting as @xmath29^{1/(1-q_{rel})}$ ] , here @xmath30 , @xmath31 stands for relaxation and @xmath32 is a characteristic relaxation time . in @xcite ,",
    "@xmath26-logistic map family has been analyzed and @xmath33 values for @xmath26 parameter has been obtained .",
    "the existence of two different classes of @xmath0 values coming from these two different approaches ( namely , mixing - based and relaxation - based approaches ) is also present in the results recently obtained for fully developed turbulence @xcite .",
    "therefore , all these findings naturally force us to ask an intriguing question : are these classes connected to each other or not ?",
    "the affirmative answer to this question came very recently by borges at al .",
    "their procedure goes as follows : beginning with @xmath16 points located inside a single cell ( similar to method iii explained before ) , the dynamics of the system ( for @xmath34 ) leads it to a state with a stationary value of @xmath35  this is the attractor of the system for the particular conditions of @xmath15 , @xmath16 and the initial cell chosen .",
    "the path that the system evolves towards its attractor changes as the initial cell is changed .",
    "some of the initial cells spread the points very fast , increasing the entropy to values much higher than that of the attractor ( there is an overshooting in the time evolution of @xmath35 ) .",
    "consequently , for these specific cases , the attractor is achieved from above .",
    "the procedure consists in observing the rate in which the system goes to its attractor , for those initial cells which yield large overshoots .",
    "specifically , the time evolution of @xmath36 is followed .",
    "the procedure is repeated for increasing values of @xmath15 ( and correspondingly increasing values of @xmath16 ) .",
    "a power - law regime appears and becomes more pronounced for increasing @xmath15 .",
    "the slope ( in a log - log plot ) of the range of the @xmath37 curve that follows a power - law is identified with @xmath38 ( with @xmath39 ) .",
    "it is worth to stress that @xmath40 , i.e. , the rate in which the system reaches its final state depends on the coarse graining ( @xmath15 ) adopted .",
    "the connection between the mixing - based and the relaxation - based approaches is established by the scaling law    [ scaling - law ] q_rel()-q_rel(w ) w^-|q_mix| .    in this work ,",
    "our aim is to provide further support to this connection by analyzing , for the first time , a two - dimensional dissipative system within this context . to accomplish this task ,",
    "we will focus on the henon map @xcite    @xmath41    where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are map parameters .",
    "this map reduces to the standard logistic map when @xmath44 , whereas it becomes conservative when @xmath45 ; in between these two cases , it is a two - dimensional dissipative map .",
    "specifically , we focus on small values of the @xmath43 parameter such as @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , etc .",
    "this map has been studied within the mixing - based approach using the three different methods and it is found that the @xmath11 value for all values of @xmath43 parameter coincides with that of the logistic case , as expected @xcite . here , we first investigate the henon map within the relaxation - based approach and then establish the connection between these two different approaches following the same lines of @xcite .",
    "as introduced in the previous section , for the relaxation approach , we follow the dynamical evolution of an ensemble of initial conditions uniformly distributed over the phase space . in practice ,",
    "a partition of the phase space on @xmath15 cells of equal size is performed and a set of @xmath16 initial copies of system is followed whose initial conditions are uniformly distributed over the entire phase space . our results for the temporal evolution of the volume occupied by the ensemble are given in fig .  1 for various @xmath43 values .",
    "as it is evident , after the power - law contraction of the volume occupied by the ensemble sets up , the slope [ @xmath49 is independent from the @xmath43 values and coincides with that of the logistic map ( namely , @xmath50 hence @xmath51 ) .",
    "now we are at the position to establish the connection between this result and the one obtained in @xcite .",
    "2 shows the temporal evolution of @xmath35 ( @xmath52 ) for different values of @xmath15 , at the edge of chaos for @xmath53 .",
    "( it would be recommended that @xmath54 , but we adopted here @xmath55 , due to restricted computer capabilities .",
    "of course , we compared this case with @xmath56 , and we found that the differences are negligible . ) it becomes evident that the limits @xmath57 and @xmath58 are non - commutable .",
    "if the former is taken first , the system will never relax to a stationary state ( equilibrium is but a particular case ) , which leads to the conclusion that reaching equilibrium depends on the coarse graining adopted , and ultimately , depends on the observer !",
    "equilibrium is only possible with incomplete knowledge ( @xmath59 ) . to arrive to the scaling law stated by eq .",
    "( [ scaling - law ] ) , we must take first the temporal limit , and then @xmath60 .",
    "when we consider the downhill side of these curves and take the slopes of @xmath61 versus time ( as explained earlier ) , then we end up with fig .  3 , where the verification of the scaling ( 4 ) is evident .",
    "on the other hand , the extrapolation value of @xmath62 is computed as @xmath63 , which is different from the logistic case ( @xmath64 ) .",
    "this discrepancy may be originated , most probably , from the fact that @xmath53 value is too large for analyzing , as it is also observed from the deterioration seen in fig .  1 of @xcite ( method i ) for increasing values of the @xmath43 parameter",
    ". a careful investigation of the effect of increasing @xmath43 values to @xmath62 would be a subject of an extensive computational effort .",
    "after the analysis of two - dimensional dissipative henon map at the chaos threshold using three distinct methods ( methods i , ii and iii ) @xcite , it became evident that the scenario , which we called here _ mixing - based approach _",
    ", is valid not only for one - dimensional dissipative map families , but also for two - dimensional cases . at this point , what missing in the literature were ( i )  to study the _ relaxation - based approach _ for a two - dimensional dissipative system making use of the same procedure applied so far to one - dimensional cases @xcite , and ( ii )  to verify the connection ( given by the scaling relation ( 4 ) ) between the mixing - based and relaxation - based approaches for a two - dimensional dissipative system .",
    "this work constitutes the first step along this line and provides some further elements that reinforce the idea of weak mixing .",
    "this work has been supported by the turkish academy of sciences , in the framework of the young scientist award program ( ut / tuba - gebip/2001 - 2 - 20 ) .",
