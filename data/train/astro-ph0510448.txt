    "the bizarre object ss433 is a galactic x - ray binary at the centre of the supernova remnant w50 .",
    "it is observed as a weak ( @xmath010@xmath1erg  s@xmath2 ) x - ray source ( x1909 + 048 ) , which combined with the high orbital inclination ( _ i _",
    "@xmath3 ) and low l@xmath4/l@xmath5 ratio ( _ v _",
    "@xmath014.2 ) suggests that it may be an accretion disc corona source .",
    "in addition to its pair of relativistic jets ( v @xmath0 0.26c ) , recent radio observations have detected extended emission in a direction that is perpendicular to the main jet outflow @xcite .",
    "this provides evidence for some form of circumbinary outflow such as a disc - like outflow of matter from the outer parts of the accretion disc @xcite . the overall system geometry suggested by these recent studies",
    "is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ cartoon]_a _ , a schematic that we will use extensively throughout this paper .",
    "the system displays two key periodicities , a @xmath0 162d precession period of its jets and a @xmath6d orbital period .",
    "the precession of the jets is revealed in the radial velocity curves of the strong , blue- and red - shifted moving balmer emission lines @xcite .",
    "this 162d modulation is also present in the optical flux , a result of the changing orientation of the precessing accretion disc .",
    "the orbital period was first discovered through the radial velocity variations of the stationary balmer and hei emission lines @xcite , which reach maximum velocity at superior conjunction of the x - ray source . however , the heii @xmath74686 has a different radial velocity curve , with a velocity maximum occurring when the compact object is receding @xcite .",
    "this may indicate an origin in or around the accretion disc / compact object .    due to the strong and broad emission lines ,",
    "the detection of any spectroscopic signatures of the donor star has proved rather more difficult , and the suggestions for its spectral type range from ob to wolf - rayet @xcite . since the interpretation of the radial velocity curves requires assumptions about the mass donor , estimates for the mass of the compact object",
    "have ranged as widely as 0.8 @xmath8 @xcite and 62 @xmath8 @xcite . @xcite and @xcite suggested that the optimal time to detect a signature of the donor star is during the x - ray eclipse ( @xmath9 ) , at a precessional phase when the disc is most open to the observer ( @xmath10 , fig .",
    "[ cartoon]_b _ ) . during this configuration of phases ,",
    "light from the donor should be least obscured by the extended circumbinary disc or disc wind . based on observations taken during this combination of phases , @xcite discovered features corresponding with a mid - a supergiant ( sg ) and suggested that these could originate upon the donor star .",
    "this constrained the binary system to be a low mass black hole ( 2.9 @xmath11 ) with a 10.9 @xmath12 companion , consistent with the predictions of @xcite .",
    "however , these calculations were based upon limited orbital phase coverage . in this paper we will test the possibility of observing the a sg features over a much broader range of phases in order to confirm their origin and provide a more secure estimate of the system parameters . in section 2",
    "we give an overview of the observations . in section 3",
    "we will begin with a general description of all our spectra , then discuss the three best spectra in more detail ( sections 3.1 - 3.3 ) , and finish by presenting the radial velocities in section 3.4 .",
    "we will begin section 4 with a discussion of the consequences of the model proposed by @xcite and then discuss our findings .",

    "two intermediate resolution spectra ( 0.63   pix@xmath14 ) were obtained using the intermediate dispersion spectrograph ( ids ) attached to the 2.5  m isaac newton telescope ( int ) at the observatorio del roque de los muchachos on the nights of 15 - 16 august 2002 .",
    "we used the r900v grating in combination with the 235  mm camera and a 1.2@xmath15 slit to provide a spectral resolution of 83 km s@xmath14 ( fwhm ) at 4550 .",
    "nine high resolution spectra of ss433 in addition to an a sg comparison star were also obtained using the blue arm of the isis spectrograph with the 4.2  m william herschel telescope ( wht ) at the observatorio del roque de los muchachos in june / july 2004 .",
    "the r1200b grating was used with a central wavelength setting of 4550  and a 0.93@xmath15 slit , giving a spectral resolution of 29 km s@xmath14 ( fwhm ) 4550 .",

    "orbital phases have been calculated using the light - curve ephemeris of @xcite , whilst disk precession phases are based on the ephemeris of @xcite .",

    "provides a remarkably clean residual spectrum ( fig .",

    "the spectrum displayed in fig .",
    "[ jul30 ] ( @xmath28 ) is also very rich in the a sg - like features identified by @xcite , including many feii , crii and tiii lines .",
    "however , it is immediately apparent even by eye that these absorption lines possess a much narrower and sharper profile ( 49 @xmath19 4 km s@xmath14 compared to 84 km s@xmath14 ) than those from the observation in sect .",
    "the fractional contribution of 0.59 @xmath19 0.04 is somewhat lower too , indicating that a large proportion of the light in this spectral region , at this particular time , may be produced elsewhere in the system , e.g. the accretion disc .",
    "the family of absorption lines are slightly blue - shifted compared to the observation discussed in sect .",
    "3.1 , with a velocity of -1 @xmath19 5 km s@xmath14 .",
    "if these lines are coming from the donor star then this is not the expected behaviour , which should have been close to its maximum blue - shift in the earlier observation , and approaching maximum red - shift at this orbital phase .",
    "even more anomalously , the spectrum from the following night ( @xmath29 , fig . [ jul31 ] ) appears to possess absorption lines which are doubled ( feii and tiii ) , with a narrower red component blended with a broader , shallower blue .",
    "this feature is evident in each of the individual spectra from the night , and is not therefore the signature of some systematic error introduced when producing the average spectrum for the night .",
    "cross - correlating the data from this night against the a sg comparison star gives a velocity of -35 @xmath19 4 km s@xmath14 .",
    "this is again much bluer than expected , with the observation coinciding with the expected maximal red - shift of the donor star .",
    "however , the cross - correlation technique in this case fails to fit either of the apparent absorption components in this spectrum , instead picking out an in - between velocity .",

    "our data cover a broad range of orbital phases , and are displayed in fig .",

    "the three spectra discussed in sections 3.13.3 are marked with squares . note that all the velocities used in this analysis were the result of cross - correlation with a comparison star , with the exception of the individual line fits discussed in section 3.3 .",
    "the results reported by @xcite are indicated by pluses , with the dotted line representing their best - fitting sine curve to these data .",
    "the best - fit sine curve to our data is marked by a dashed line , with semi - amplitude k = 69 @xmath19 4 km s@xmath14 , systemic velocity @xmath22 = -53 @xmath19 3 km s@xmath14 and with velocity maxima occuring at orbital conjunction , 0.26 @xmath19 0.01 out of phase with the motion of the accretion disc @xcite .",

    "the dashed line represents the best - fitting sine curve to these data .",
    "note that two orbits have been plotted for clarity . ]",
    "@xcite and @xcite state that the mass donor is ideally observed around the primary eclipse and when the accretion disc has precessed to its most face - on position ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "the donor star would then have the highest chance of being positioned above and between any extended disc and an observer ( fig .",
    "[ cartoon]_b _ ) .",
    "extending this idea , it should also be possible to detect the donor star at certain other combinations of phases . in fig .",
    "[ cartoon]_c _ we show an example , with the companion being positioned clearly above the extended disc , whilst in fig .",
    "[ cartoon]_d _ we have the inverse situation , with the companion star being totally obscured behind the extended disc .",
    "however , at this @xmath18 the companion could become partially visible _ below _ the extended disc from @xmath31 0.75 0.25 .",
    "the extent to which we may be able to observe the companion will be determined by the opening angle and radial size of the extended disc , parameters which are currently not well constrained , in addition to the degree of irradiation of the inner face of the donor star from the accretion disc @xcite .",
    "if this scenario is correct , it can provide direct observational information about the precession evident in the system . confirming whether it be prograde or the preferred retrograde model @xcite with respect to the donor star",
    "could perhaps cast further light upon the physics driving the precession @xcite . from figs .",
    "[ cartoon ] _",
    "e _ & _ f _ , representing the system alignment of the spectrum discussed in section 3.1 , it becomes clear that the companion star could only be visible above the disc at this combination of phases if the precession were prograde in nature , with the extended disc masking the donor in the case of retrograde precession .",
    "the presence of the same a sg - like features reported by @xcite in many of our spectra , at a range of different orbital and precessional phases , would at first glance seem to indicate that our data support this scheme .",
    "in particular , the observation discussed in section 3.1 ( where the accretion disc is close to edge - on , @xmath32 ) provides an unsurpassed match between an a4iab comparison star and ss433 ( fig .",
    "[ jun29 ] ) . if these features really do originate upon the donor star , then the depth and strength of the lines are equivalent to a scaling factor of 0.77 @xmath19 0.04",
    ". this would indicate a surprisingly high contribution to the total light at this combination of phases , compared to observations with the disc face - on , where @xcite find a fractional contribution of 0.36 @xmath19 0.07 .",
    "we can compare our estimated scaling factor with that expected from observed light curves of ss433 in a similar manner to @xcite .",
    "the key assumption required is that the donor star is totally eclipsed by the disc at @xmath33 and @xmath34 , and at all other times both the donor and the accretion disc are contributing to the total light .",
    "v_-band light - curves of @xcite imply a potential fractional contribution for the donor star of roughly 0.70 @xmath19 0.15 at @xmath32 . whilst this prediction appears to be consistent with our observational data",
    ", we must note that there is a large degree of scatter evident in the observed precessional light curves , introducing a degree of systematic error into these calculations .",
    "indeed , if we use the same method to predict the donor contribution at phase combination @xmath30 from the @xcite light curves , the resulting estimate is too high by a factor of three .",
    "if we presume the absorption features noted in section 3.1 to be a signature of the donor star , then retrograde precession may be immediately ruled out .",
    "however , the same features also occur in the spectra discussed in sections 3.23.3 .",
    "these observations were performed at a phase combination where the donor should be obscured assuming prograde precession , and visible in the retrograde case .",
    "in addition to this apparent conflict , we must also account for the unusual velocity behaviour of these weak absorption features .",
    "cross - correlating our spectra of ss433 with an a supergiant spectrum produces a velocity curve ( fig .",
    "[ vels ] , @xmath22 = -53 @xmath19 3 km s@xmath14 ) which is far removed in terms of systemic velocity from the value of 65 @xmath19 3 km s@xmath14 reported by @xcite , though it is close to the result of @xcite , where @xmath22 = -44 @xmath19 9 km s@xmath14 . additionally , it is almost exactly a quarter out of phase with the @xcite heii curve ( where @xmath22 = -22 @xmath19 14 km s@xmath14 ) which traces the motion of the compact object .",
    "the occurence of a velocity maximum at orbital conjunction essentially precludes the possibility that these features were produced in the photosphere of the companion . whilst it is extremely difficult to pin down a particular region within the system which could produce this velocity signature , it is interesting to note that this behaviour has been reported before .",
    "@xcite find the stationary hei and h@xmath35 emission lines display a remarkably similar semi - amplitude and phasing to the a sg - like features investigated here .",
    "this is attributed to a clumpy wind outflow from the accretion disc rather than the disc itself or to a gas stream @xcite .",
    "although there is a large disparity in line widths between the stationary emission lines and our narrow absorption lines , if what we observe in ss433 is a structured outflow then we would expect to see narrow absorption components from localised density enhancements in the wind .",
    "this would appear to indicate that for at least some combinations of orbital and precessional phases the a sg photospheric features arise not from the donor but instead from a localised area that can be associated with the region where the hei and h@xmath35 stationary emission lines are produced .",
    "we also have some longer wavelength data collected during the 2004 observing campaign in la palma with isis ( @xmath0 8400 - 8900 ) , to be published in a later paper . here",
    "we identify heavily blended caii and weak ni absorption lines , which again correspond to the absorption features expected for an early - mid a sg .",
    "interestingly , there appears to be a strong positive correlation between the strength of the p cygni profiles seen in the paschen lines and the strength of the caii and ni lines , implying another link between traditional wind features and those typical of the proposed companion star .",
    "the strongest evidence to date for an a sg donor is the data presented by @xcite .",
    "they base their identification on three criteria which suggest an association with the donor , namely the radial velocity curve characteristics , the absorption line depths and the absorption line width .",
    "however , their data do not cover the key phases when there should be a turnover in velocity space ( @xmath36 0.25 , 0.75 ) , which would unambiguously associate the lines with the donor .",
    "interestingly , a number of our own spectra which can be clearly associated with an outflow also meet at least two of the above criteria ( see table [ tabobs ] ) , with only the velocity curve excluding an association with the donor .",
    "the large offset between the systemic velocity detected by @xcite and in our data could be a potential problem for a purely circumbinary outflow origin .",
    "however , this velocity offset could be explained by a considerable cycle to cycle variation in the semi - amplitude of the stationary emission lines originating in the accretion disc wind @xcite .",
    "another problem could be the doubled absorption lines shown in fig .",
    "[ jul31 ] .",
    "this could perhaps be indicative of two entirely separate regions with identical spectral signatures , though neither component corresponds to a possible donor star origin .",
    "it seems more likely that two different components of a clumpy wind outflow could concurrently pass through the line - of - sight , as proposed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "our series of high - resolution optical spectra of ss433 clearly display numerous typical a sg photospheric features , as reported by several authors and attributed to a putative mass donor .",
    "however , the velocities of these features do not correspond to the expected motion of the mass donor , but rather to the h@xmath35 and hei stationary emission lines noted by @xcite and assumed to originate in a clumpy , accretion - driven outflow .",
    "although the observations of @xcite are suggestive of an a sg - like donor , we can not exclude the possibility that these features originate from the same highly variable accretion - driven wind .",
    "if these lines are consistent over a number of observations at @xmath37 then it would seem likely that they are a signature of the donor . in this case",
    "the large off - set in systemic velocity between the @xcite data and ours could be due to the velocity of the outflow towards our line of sight .",
    "however , if the lines originate exclusively in some form of outflow , then we would expect them to be rather variable in terms of width , depth , shape and velocity . in any case",
