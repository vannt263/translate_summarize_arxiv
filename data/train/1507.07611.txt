    "how to naturally keep the small higgs boson mass against its quadratically divergent radiative corrections has been one of the most important issues in the particle physic community for the last four decades . since this question raised in the standard model ( sm )",
    "is associated with stabilization of the ew scale against the grand unified theory ( gut ) scale or the planck scale , many ideas and theories beyond the sm and towards the fundamental theory have been motivated and suggested in order to address this question .",
    "the supersymmetric ( susy ) resolution to it is to cancel the quadratic divergences by introducing superpartners with spins different by @xmath7 from those of the sm particles , and their interactions with the same strength as those of the sm .",
    "all of them can consistently be controlled within the susy framework @xcite .",
    "since the top quark and its superpartner `` stop '' dominantly contribute to the radiative higgs mass via the large top quark yukawa coupling , the stop mass has been regarded as a barometer for naturalness of the minimal susy sm ( mssm ) : a stop mass lighter than @xmath8 is quite essential for keeping the naturalness of the ew scale and the higgs boson mass .",
    "however , the experimental mass bound on the stop has already exceeded @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "thus , it would be very timely to ask whether the low energy susy can still remain natural even with a somewhat heavy stop mass greater than @xmath8 .",
    "on the other hand , the gluino is not directly involved in this issue , because it does not couple to the higgs boson at tree level .",
    "instead , the gluino mass dominantly influences the renormalization group ( rg ) evolution of the stop mass parameters . in this sense ,",
    "the gluino affects the higgs mass parameter @xmath1 just indirectly in the ordinary mssm . in this paper , however , we attempt to investigate another possibility : the gluino can play a more important role in the naturalness of the small higgs boson mass . as a consequence , the stop mass can be much less responsible for it : it can be much heavier than the present experimental bound .",
    "indeed , the gluino can be more easily explored than the stop at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "thus , if a relatively light gluino mass turns out to be needed , this scenario could readily be tested at lhc run  ii .",
    "because of the top quark yukawa coupling constant @xmath10 of order unity , as mentioned above , the top quark and stop make the dominant contributions not only to the renormalization of a soft mass parameter of the higgs @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) , but also to the radiative physical higgs mass ( @xmath13 ) @xcite : [ renormhiggs ] & &  m_h_u^2|_1-loop_t^2  log ( ) , + [ physicalhiggs ] & & m_h^2|_1-loop , where @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) denotes the top quark ( stop ) mass , and @xmath16 is the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the higgs boson , @xmath17 with @xmath18 . for simplicity , here we assumed that the su(2)@xmath19-doublet and -singlet stops ( `` lh- and rh stops '' ) are degenerate , and the `` @xmath20-term '' coefficient corresponding to the top quark yukawa coupling , @xmath21 dominates over @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the `` higgsino '' mass . by introducing susy ,",
    "thus , the quadratic dependence on the ultraviolet ( uv ) cutoff @xmath24 in the sm for @xmath25 is replaced by a logarithmic one as seen in eq .",
    "( [ renormhiggs ] ) . for a small enough @xmath25 ,",
    "however , the stop mass should necessarily be small enough .",
    "otherwise , the higgs mass parameters , @xmath1 and @xmath26 , should be finely tuned with @xmath23 to yield the measured value of the @xmath27 boson mass @xmath28 , because they are related to each other via the minimization condition of the higgs potential @xcite , @xmath29    as seen in eq .",
    "( [ physicalhiggs ] ) , the radiative correction to the physical higgs mass depends logarithmically on the stop mass .",
    "actually the tree level higgs mass in the mssm should be lighter even than the @xmath27 boson mass ( @xmath30 ) @xcite .",
    "thus , the radiative higgs mass eq .",
    "( [ physicalhiggs ] ) is also quite essential for explaining the observed higgs boson mass . in view of eq .",
    "( [ physicalhiggs ] ) , however , the recently measured higgs boson mass , @xmath4 @xcite is indeed too heavy as a susy higgs mass , because it would require a too heavy stop mass ( `` little hierarchy problem '' ) .",
    "many susy models have been proposed for raising the higgs boson mass by extending the mssm , but still assuming a relatively light stop , @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "however , the experimental mass bound on the stop has already exceeded @xmath9 @xcite , as mentioned above .",
    "of course , the second term in eq .",
    "( [ physicalhiggs ] ) could be helpful for raising the higgs mass , when it is almost maximized , @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "but it is not easy to realize at low energies from a uv model via its rg running , unless we suppose a tachyonic stop at the gut scale ( @xmath33 ) @xcite .",
    "according to the recent analysis based on three - loop calculations in ref .",
    "@xcite , a @xmath2-@xmath3 stop mass can account for the @xmath4 higgs boson mass with ignorable @xmath21 terms .",
    "such a heavy stop mass would give rise to a more serious fine - tuning problem associated with the light @xmath27 boson mass as seen in eqs .",
    "( [ renormhiggs ] ) and ( [ m_z ] ) , particularly , when the cutoff scale @xmath24 is about gut scale ( @xmath34 ) : apparently a fine - tuning of order @xmath35 ( or @xmath36 in terms of the fine - tuning measure defined later ) looks unavoidable in the mssm . to more",
    "precisely discuss the uv dependence of @xmath1 , addressing the little hierarchy problem , however , one should analyze the full rg equations under a given specific uv model .",
    "if a susy uv model turns out to be simple enough , addressing the above question , susy could still be recognized as an attractive solution to the gauge hierarchy problem .",
    "a potentially promising uv model is the `` focus point ( fp ) scenario '' @xcite . since it is based on the minimal gravity mediation ( mgrm ) of susy breaking , all the soft squared masses including the two higgs mass parameters @xmath1 and @xmath26 , lh- and rh stop s squared masses @xmath37 and @xmath38 , etc . as well as",
    "the mssm gaugino masses take the universal forms @xcite : @xmath39 where @xmath40 denote the gluino , wino , and bino masses , respectively . in this case , as noticed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the rg flows of @xmath1 converge about the @xmath27 boson mass scale to a small negative value , regardless of its initial values taken at the gut scale , i.e. , various @xmath41 values , only if the @xmath21 and @xmath42 are sufficiently suppressed . since @xmath1 is almost independent of @xmath41 , a small enough @xmath42 turns out to be responsible for a small negative @xmath1 , naturally explaining the smallness of the ew scale or @xmath43 compared to the gut or planck scale",
    "such a parameter choice can indeed reduce the fine - tuning considerably .",
    "several different definitions of the fine - tuning report a similar tendency around the `` fp region '' in the mssm parameter space  @xcite . on the other hand , the low energy values of other soft mass parameters such as @xmath37 and @xmath38 are very sensitive to @xmath41 values .",
    "these features in the mgrm might open a possibility to naturally explain the smallness of @xmath1 in contrast to large stop mass parameters .",
    "however , the experimental gluino mass bound has already exceeded @xmath44 @xcite , and so the unified gaugino mass @xmath42 can not be small any longer .",
    "also the naturalness on a small @xmath20-term would be questionable .",
    "most of all , if the stop masses are around @xmath2-@xmath3 , they should decouple below the @xmath2-@xmath3 energy scale from the ordinary mssm rg equations , and so the fp behavior of @xmath1 becomes seriously spoiled below the stop mass scale @xcite .",
    "basically the fp scale in the mgrm is too far below the stop mass scale desired for explaining the @xmath4 higgs boson mass .",
    "all such problems in the fp scenario arise because heavier masses for the higgs , stop , and gluino are experimentally and/or theoretically compelled .",
    "the best resolution to such problems would be to somehow push the fp scale from the @xmath27 boson mass scale to the desired stop mass scale ( `` shifted fp '' @xcite ) such that the @xmath41 dependence of @xmath1 becomes suppressed before stops are decoupled from the rg equation of @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "actually , it is indispensable for restoring the naturalness of the low energy susy in the framework of the fp scenario .",
    "@xmath1 below the stop mass scale or at the @xmath27 boson mass scale can be estimated using the coleman - weinberg potential @xcite : [ rgsm ] m_h_u^2(m_z ) & & m_h_u^2(_t ) + |__t + & & m_h_u^2(_t ) -",
