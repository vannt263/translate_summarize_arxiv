    "recently , the matter field can give rise to an accelerated expansion [ 1 ] for the universe stems from the observational data regarding the luminosity - redshift relation of type ia supernovae [ 2,3 ] up to about @xmath1 .",
    "this matter field is called _ quintessence matter _ ( shortly q - matter ) .",
    "this q - matter can behave like a cosmological constant [ 4,5 ] by combining positive energy density and negative pressure .",
    "so there must be this q - matter either neglected or unknown responsible for this accelerated universe . at the present epoch , a lot of works has been done to solve this quintessence problem and most popular candidates for q - matter has so far been a scalar field having a potential which generates a sufficient negative pressure .",
    "the q - matter behaves as a perfect fluid with a barotropic equation of state and so some effort has been investigated in determining its adiabatic index at the present epoch [ 6 , 7 ] .",
    "chimento et al [ 8 ] have showen that a combination of dissipative effects such as a bulk viscous stress and a quintessence scalar field gives an accelerated expansion for an open universe ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "banerjee et al [ 9 ] also have shown that it is possible to have an accelerated universe with bd - theory in friedmann model without any matter . +",
    "another alternative candidate for q - matter is exotic type of fluid @xmath3 the so - called chaplygin gas which obeys the equation of state @xmath4 [ 10 ] , where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are respectively the pressure and energy density .",
    "subsequently , the above equation was generalized to the form @xmath7 [ 11 , 12 ] and recently it was modified to the form @xmath8 [ 13 , 14 ] , which is known as _ modified chaplygin gas_. this model represents the evolution of the universe starting from the radiation era to the @xmath9 model . + the possibility that the speed of light @xmath10 might vary",
    "has recently attracted considerable attention . in a cosmological",
    "setting , the variations in @xmath10 have been shown to solve the cosmological puzzles - the horizon , flatness and lambda problems of big - bang cosmology .",
    "the variations of velocity of light can also solve the quasi - lambda problems .",
    "for power - law variations in the velocity of light with the cosmological scale factors , barrow et al [ 15 ] have shown that flatness problem can be solved .",
    "the machian vsl scenario in which @xmath11 , introduced by barrow [ 16 ] has significant advantages to the phase transition scenario in which the speed of light changes suddenly from @xmath12 to @xmath13 , preferred by albrecht and magueijo [ 17 ] . for changing @xmath10 , the geometry of the universe is not affected . in classical electromagnetism",
    "the speed of light is only constant in vacuum and it ` varies ' in dielectric media .",
    "the changing @xmath10 breaks lorentz invariance and conservation of energy .",
    "the geometry of universe is not affected by a changing @xmath10 .",
    "one can allowed a changing @xmath10 to do the job normally done by _",
    "superluminal expansion_. for changing @xmath10 , the gravitational laws should be modified .",
    "the basic assumption is that a variable @xmath10 does not induce corrections to curvature in the cosmological frame and therefore , einstein s equations , relating curvature to stress energy are still valid .",
    "the reason behind this postulate is that @xmath10 changes in the local lorentzian frames associated with cosmological expansion .",
    "the effect is a special relativistic effect and not a gravitational effect .",
    "therefore curvature should not be related with the variation of @xmath10 .",
    "+ the organization of the paper is as follows : in section ii , we have studied field equations and its solutions due to vsl theory for modified chaplygin gas with varying @xmath0 . in section iii , we have discussed whole stage of the evolution of the universe using statefinder parameters . in the last section ( i.e. , section iv ) we give some remarks of this paper .",
    "in vsl theory and varying @xmath0 , the einstein equations for frw model is    @xmath14    and @xmath15    where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the pressure and energy density respectively .",
    "here we consider modified chaplygin gas in vsl theory as    @xmath16    the energy conservation equation incorporating time variation in @xmath17 and @xmath18 is    @xmath19    now assume , the velocity of light and @xmath0 are in power - law form of scale factor as    @xmath20    and @xmath21    where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are both positive constants . since we know that speed of light decreases with time and @xmath0 increases with time , so that @xmath24 must be negative and @xmath25 must be positive . + using equations ( 3 ) , ( 4 ) , ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) we have the solution of @xmath6 as ( for @xmath26 )    @xmath27^{\\frac{1}{1+\\alpha}}\\ ] ]    where @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 is a constant .",
    "+ putting the value of @xmath6 from ( 7 ) in ( 2 ) , we have    @xmath31^{\\frac{1}{2(1+\\alpha ) } } } = c_{2}~t\\ ] ]    where @xmath32 .",
    "+ the solution of scale factor @xmath33 has the form    @xmath34 = \\frac{3}{2}(1+a)c_{2}n^{\\frac{1}{2(1+\\alpha)}}~t\\ ] ]    where @xmath35 is the hypergeometric function . + now for small value of scale factor @xmath33 i.e. , for early universe , @xmath6 is very large and corresponds to the universe dominated by an equation of state @xmath36 .",
    "+ also for large value of scale factor @xmath33 i.e. , for late universe , the relation between @xmath5 and @xmath6 satisfies the equation of state @xmath37    so evolution of the universe starts from radiation era ( @xmath38 ) to phantom model . from observations , we can conclude that @xmath39 . for @xmath40 model",
    "we have @xmath41 .",
    "in 2003 , v. sahni et al [ 18 ] proposed a pair of parameters @xmath42 , called _ statefinder _ parameters . in fact , trajectories in the @xmath42 plane corresponding to different cosmological models demonstrate qualitatively different behaviour .",
    "the above statefinder diagnostic pair has the following form :    @xmath43    where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the hubble parameter and the deceleration parameter respectively .",
    "these parameters allow us to characterize the properties of dark energy .",
    "trajectories in the @xmath42 plane corresponding to different cosmological models , for example @xmath46cdm model diagrams correspond to the fixed point @xmath47 .",
    "+ the expressions for @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 are in the following :    @xmath51    @xmath52    @xmath53    and @xmath54 @xmath55\\ ] ]    the expressions of @xmath49 and @xmath50 are very complicated , so we can not found the relation between @xmath49 and @xmath50 in closed form .",
    "1 shows the variation of @xmath48 against @xmath56 for @xmath57 .",
    "the plot of @xmath48 against @xmath56 reveals that the deceleration parameter indeed has a sign flip in the desired direction and indicates an early deceleration ( @xmath58 ) followed by a late time acceleration ( @xmath59 ) of the universe . from fig .",
    "2 we see that the curve starts from the radiation era and goes asymptotically to he dust model for @xmath60 and @xmath61 . but for @xmath62 , the portion of the curve represents the evolution from dust state ( @xmath63 ) to phantom model ( @xmath60 ) and this curve crosses @xmath46cdm stage ( @xmath64 ) . thus the total curve represents the evolution of the universe starting from radiation era to phantom model .",
    "+     + fig.1 +   + fig.2 + fig.1 shows variation of @xmath48 against @xmath56 and fig.2 shows variation of @xmath50 against @xmath49 for @xmath65 .",
    "in this work , we have proposed a model for modified chaplygin gas in vsl theory with variable @xmath0 . in this model , we have found the evolution of the universe starts from radiation era to phantom model .",
    "if @xmath66 i.e. , @xmath67constant and @xmath68constant then we can recover our previous results [ 14 ] .",
    "thus variable @xmath10 and @xmath0 can drive the evolution of the universe from radiation to phantom stages instead of @xmath46cdm stage . from equation ( 10 )",
    "we see that for @xmath46cdm model @xmath41 and for phantom model @xmath69 .",
    "if @xmath68constant or @xmath67constant then any one of variable @xmath0 and @xmath10 can drive the evolution of the universe into the phantom model .",
