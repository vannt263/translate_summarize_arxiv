    "while much star formation research has concentrated on the origins of rich stellar clusters and of isolated individual stars , it is likely that a significant fraction of stars also form in groups of @xmath4 stars which represent an intermediate scale in the hierarchical structure of star formation regions @xcite .",
    "if their stellar population is drawn from a standard initial mass function ( imf ) , these stellar groups will typically be dominated by a few @xmath5 m@xmath6 stars .",
    "these groups may emerge from relatively small molecular clouds , such as found in the taurus - auriga cloud complex , or in parts of giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) which also produce the rich ob associations . in the latter case , some plausibly will appear dispersed around ob associations , propelled by motions inherited from the natal turbulent molecular material @xcite .",
    "such young stellar groups are often difficult to find as they are often dynamically unbound , dispersing into the galactic field within a few million years @xcite .",
    "study of small stellar groups is thus largely confined to the pre - main sequence ( pms ) phase .",
    "searches have been pursued in two ways .",
    "first , excess stellar densities in the neighborhoods of nearby herbig ae / be ( haebe ) stars  intermediate - mass pms stars readily identified by their infrared - luminous disks and active accretion  are sought using optical and near - infrared imagery @xcite .",
    "they are often surrounded by small groups of @xmath7 lower mass stars , as expected from the imf .",
    "second , sparse stellar groups kinematically convergent with the nearest ob association , the oph - sco - cen association ( osca ; this nomenclature is adopted from * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , have been identified @xcite .",
    "these include one compact group  the @xmath2 cha cluster dominated by a b8 star and three a stars @xcite  and two dispersed groups  the @xmath8 pic moving group dominated by five a stars @xcite and the tw hya association with a single a star ( hr 4796 ; song , bessell & zuckerman 2002 and references therein ) .",
    "the locations of these groups in relation to the osca are illustrated in figure [ lb.fig ] .",
    "membership of osca outlier groups are principally based on a combination of kinematical criteria and elevated x - ray emission , which is a ubiquitous characteristic throughout pms evolution from class i protostars through post - t tauri stars @xcite .",
    "in addition to clustering on @xmath9 pc scales , intermediate - mass stars may be accompanied by bound companions on @xmath10 au scales .",
    "the stellar multiplicity of older low - mass stars is established to be 57:38:4:1 singles : binaries : triples : quartets for every 100 stars @xcite .",
    "a few higher multiplicity field systems are known such as castor , a sextet of three close binaries dominated by two early a stars .",
    "the situation is more confusing for pms systems .",
    "the crowded and rich orion nebula cluster simultaneously shows very high multiplicities around its massive ob stars , main sequence levels of close lower - mass binaries , and a deficiency of wide binaries @xcite .",
    "the distribution of binary separations may depend on the local density of neighbors even within a single cluster @xcite . in less crowded environments like the taurus - auriga clouds ,",
    "binarity is nearly a factor of 2 higher among lower - mass pms systems than in main sequence stars such that virtually all stars appear to be born in multiple systems @xcite .",
    "binary fractions among haebe stars are also elevated above main sequence levels and a few triple systems are known (  [ hd104_bound.sec ] ) .",
    "the study of multiplicity in young stars is of critical importance @xcite .",
    "it first addresses primordial conditions of star formation , such as the fragmentation of molecular material and redistribution of angular momentum during gravitational collapse ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and the review by bodenheimer et al .",
    "but it also reveals subsequent dynamical evolutionary effects , such as the dissipation of molecular material , close stellar encounters , stellar evaporation , and the survival of protoplanetary disks ( reviews by bonnell 2000 and kroupa 2000 ) .",
    "we report here an effort that combines the two observatioal approaches outlined above .",
    "we seek young low - mass pms stars with elevated x - ray emission around intermediate - mass pms haebe stars that are kinematically associated with the osca .",
    "this is a small study based on only five x - ray snapshots designed to test the efficacy of the method . despite the exploratory nature of our effort ,",
    "one new young osca outlying stellar group is found associated with the closely spaced b / a stars @xmath0 cha and hd  104237 , including a remarkably high multiplicity of hd 104237 itself .",
    "section 5 details our x - ray , optical / infrared photometric and spectroscopic characterization of the @xmath0 cha group chamaeleontis star cluster , we name the new @xmath0 chamaeleontis group of pms stars after the highest mass member .",
    "components hd 104237 b - e are names in order of proximity to the primary hd 104237a . ] .",
    "we also find new companions within @xmath11 au of two of the other observed haebe stars , hd 141569 and hd 150193 (  6 ) .",
    "a variety of theoretical issues are discussed in  7 .",
    "figure [ lb.fig ] shows @xmath12 of the celestial sphere featuring stars associated with the osca .",
    "the dashed lines outline the boundaries of the rich upper sco ( us ) , upper centaurus lupus ( ucl ) and lower centaurus crux ( lcc ) subgroups of the osca defined by @xcite in their detailed study of _ hipparcos _ motions .",
    "the brighter members , complete to @xmath13 and consisting mainly of intermediate - mass baf stars , identified by them are plotted as small dots .",
    "the three thick arrows show subgroup average proper motions during the next 1 myr without correction for solar reflex motion .",
    "_ hipparcos _ parallaxes of these bright members establish the subgroup distances to be 145 pc ( us ) , 140 pc ( ucl ) and 118 pc ( lcc ) .",
    "several samples of fainter osca members within the traditional boundaries have been constructed based on various combinations of kinematical , spectroscopic and x - ray selection criteria @xcite , but these constitute only a few percent of the full population of the subgroups , estimated to be @xmath14 stars with @xmath15 m@xmath6 assuming a standard initial mass function and some stellar evaporation @xcite .",
    "the late - type members of these samples are particularly valuable in establishing ages from their positions on the pms tracks in the hr diagram .",
    "the ages for oph , us , ucl and lcc osca subgroups are found to be @xmath16 , 5 , 16 and 17 myr respectively .",
    "this progression of ages led @xcite to suggest that a sequence of distinct star forming events occurred in the ancestral giant molecular cloud where later events are triggered by the shocks and ionization fronts produced by the ob stars of previous events @xcite .",
    "the ages of the outlying osca groups are similarly established to be @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 myr for the @xmath2 cha , @xmath8 pic and tw hya groups respectively @xcite .    in this preliminary study",
    ", we chose five haebe stars with present - day space positions in or near the osca , and with space motions consistent with an origin in the sca giant molecular cloud ( table [ targets.tab ] ) .",
    "the first five columns of the table give the star identifiers , _ hipparcos _ distances , and estimated masses and ages .",
    "see table notes for details .",
    "the ninth column of table [ targets.tab ] indicates that two of the stars are closely associated with small molecular clouds .",
    "hd 100546 is likely associated with the bright - rimmed dark cloud dc296.2 - 7.9 located 0.4@xmath20 away @xcite .",
    "hd 104237 , and its comoving non - emission line b9vn companion @xmath0 cha 2 away , lie among several small molecular clumps with @xmath21 m@xmath6 within @xmath2210 @xcite .",
    "knee & prusti plausibly argue that these are dissipating remnants of the molecular cloud from which these two intermediate - mass stars formed . indeed , the entire chamaeleon - musca region south of the osca has many widely dispersed small molecular clouds and filaments , some closely associated with relatively isolated pms stars @xcite . these authors ( see also mamajek et al .",
    "2000 ) discuss the possibility that this molecular material remains after the passage of the interstellar supershells attributed to the ob winds and supernova remnants of the osca @xcite .",
    "figure [ lb.fig ] qualitatively shows that the five targets have @xmath23 proper motions similar to those of the principal osca subgroups .",
    "quantitative assessment of an origin in the same molecular cloud complex , which is now largely dispersed , requires accurate radial velocities which are generally not available .",
    "we adopt here the approximate method described by @xcite ( see also mamajek & feigelson 2001 ) where we evaluate the closest approach in three dimensions between a star and osca subgroups , @xmath24 , assuming linear motion and arbitrary radial velocities .",
    "this calculation of closest approach includes correction for solar reflex motion , and is similar to the measurement of proximity of ` spaghetti ' in 6-dimensional phase space described by @xcite and used by @xcite to establish osca memberships .",
    "the resulting @xmath24 distances for the target stars to osca subgroup centers over the past 10 myr are given in the last column of table [ targets.tab ] .",
    "in the two cases where radial velocity measurements are available ( hd 141569 and 152404 , barbier - brossat & figon 2000 ) , our method correctly gives the closest approach to osca subgroups for the measured value compared to other hypothetical values .    from this measure of past proximity ,",
    "available kinematical data for three of the target stars ( hd 100546 , 104237 and 150193 ) are fully consistent with osca subgroup membership ( @xmath25 pc ) , while for two stars ( hd 141569 and 152404 ) sca membership is less certain ( @xmath26 pc ) .",
    "for the three stars lying within the sca boundaries ( figure [ lb.fig ] ) , these results agree with those obtained by @xcite who assign hd 100546 and 150193 as high probability osca members and hd 152404 as a lower probability member .    finally , we note that for three targets @xmath27 hd 100546 , hd 141569 and hd 150193 @xmath27 searches for close low - mass companions to the bright haebe primary have been made at optical or near - infrared bands (  [ others.sec ] ) .",

    "the first stages of data reduction are described in the appendix of @xcite .",
    "briefly , we start with the level 1 events from the satellite telemetry , correct event energies for charge transfer inefficiency , and apply a variety of data selection operations such as asca event grades and energies in the range @xmath29 kev . a small ( typically @xmath30 ) correction to the image boresight",
    "is made so the x - ray bright herbig ae / be stellar position agrees with the @xmath23 position .",
    "candidate sources were located using a wavelet - based detection algorithm @xcite .",
    "we applied a low threshold ( @xmath31 ) so that some spurious sources are found which we exclude later .",
    "the image was visually examined for additional sources such as close companions to the bright haebe star .",
    "events for each candidate source were extracted using the _ acis_extract _ procedures which take into account the position - dependent point spread function .",
    "background is negligible for sources of interest in these short exposures and was not subtracted .",

    "x - ray luminosities , @xmath43 in the soft @xmath44 kev band and @xmath45 in the total @xmath29 kev band , are obtained from these fluxes by multiplying by @xmath46 using the distances in table [ targets.tab ] and dividing by @xmath39 .",

    "pms stars form an isochrone that is elevated in magnitude above the vast majority of field stars owing to a combination of youth , proximity and ( for groups dispersed from their parent molecular cloud ) the absence of significant reddening . for x - ray discovered groups of pms stars such as the @xmath2 cha cluster @xcite and the @xmath0 cha group announced here , optical photometric study also permits an independent evaluation of completeness within the x - ray field ( except for low - mass stars located very close to the bright a and b stars ) .",
    "x - ray - faint stars with similar photometric properties to x - ray selected cluster members can be identified and subsequently observed using spectroscopy for confirmation of membership ; e.g. for the @xmath2 cha cluster , we identified two x - ray faint late - type members residing within the @xmath47 high - resolution imager discovery field including the strongest disk source in the cluster @xcite .",

    "thus relatively young sparse groups , like those around @xmath2 cha and @xmath0 cha , may be found in the vicinity of older clusters like the osca subgroups",
    ". some of these dispersed groups may be compact ( like the @xmath2 cha and @xmath0 cha groups ) due to smaller local values of @xmath164 , while other groups with higher @xmath164 may themselves appear widely dispersed ( like the tw hya association and @xmath8 pic moving group ; see  [ targets.sec ] and figure [ lb.fig ] ) . however , all of these systems would share space motions converging onto the same ancestral giant molecular cloud .",
    "[ [ comparison-of-the-eta-cha-and-epsilon-cha-groups-comparison.sec ] ] comparison of the @xmath2 cha and @xmath0 cha groups [ comparison.sec ] ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    we have now made considerable progress in characterizing the populations of two nearby sparse pms stellar clusters dominated by intermediate - mass stars and lying on the outskirts of a large and rich ob association :    1 .",
    "the @xmath2 cha cluster has three intermediate - mass systems : the b8 star @xmath2 cha probably ( due to its _ rosat _ x - ray detection ) with a low mass companion ; rs cha , a a7+a8 hard binary with a likely lower mass companion ; and the single a1 star hd 75505 @xcite .",
    "these three systems have projected separations @xmath165 pc .",
    "they are accompanied by 14 late - type primaries of which several are binaries @xcite .",
    "disks are prevasive in the cluster : two of the intermediate - mass systems ( @xmath2 cha and hd 75505 ) have weak @xmath166-band excesses ; @xmath167 of the late - type members have both ir excesses and optical signatures of active accretion ; and @xmath168 additional late - type members have weak @xmath166-band excesses @xcite .",
    "2 .   the @xmath0 cha group has two intermediate - mass systems : @xmath0 cha with two or three @xmath22a0 stars , and hd 104237 with at least 4 lower - mass companions . due to the absence of x - ray emission",
    ", we infer that @xmath0 cha does not have any lower - mass companions above @xmath169 m@xmath6 .",
    "these high - multiplicity systems have a projected separation of 0.07 pc .",
    "the group also has three m5 stars distributed over 0.5 pc .",
    "three members  hd 104237 a , hd 104237 e and usno - b 120144.4 - 782936  have ctt - type optical emission lines indicating active accretion .",
    "this group has not been surveyed in the @xmath166 band like @xmath2 cha , so the apparent lower disk fraction may not be real .",
    "these stellar systems are quite similar , and together paint a portrait of @xmath170 member groups several million years after their formation . in each group ,",
    "the total stellar mass is about @xmath171 m@xmath172 and the size is @xmath173 pc , giving an escape velocity of @xmath174 kms@xmath61 . as this is about the expected velocity dispersion inherited from the molecular material (  [ hd104_bound.sec ] )",
    ", the outlying members of the groups could be unbound .",
    "it is likely that the original census was considerably higher and many members of the original clusters have already escaped into the stellar field .",
    "the survival of so many high - multiplicity systems and disks in these sparse groups implies that little or no close dynamical interactions have occurred among the stars .    _ acknowledgements : _",
