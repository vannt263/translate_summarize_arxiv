    "active galactic nuclei ( agn ) feature narrow - line regions ( nlrs ) in which continuum radiation from the central engine photoionizes the surrounding interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "the relatively hard agn continuum emission injects more energy and photoionizes the ism to higher ionization states than the ionizing spectra of ob stars at the centers of regions .",
    "many insights into the physics of the the ism in active galaxies have been gained through the use of photoionization models .",
    "the results of photoionization modeling facilitate the routine diagnosis of the density , temperature , and cause of ionization of nlr gas from observed emission - line spectra .",
    "photoionization models have been used to explain the very similar nlr ionization parameters observed across the population of active galaxies - this effect is caused by the gas pressure gradient balancing the radiation pressure gradient in dusty nlr clouds such that the ` local ' ionization parameter is self - regulated @xcite .",
    "models are an important tool in investigating the effects of various ism parameters on emission - line spectra ; e.g.  determining the effects of changing abundances @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite showed how comparisons between models and spatially - resolved spectroscopy may reveal where extended nlrs are radiation pressure - dominated or gas pressure - dominated on scales of tens to hundreds of parsecs .",
    "the emission line spectra of nlrs in active galaxies strongly depend upon the shape of the spectrum of the central source at energies immediately above the lyman limit at 13.6  ev .",
    "these ionizing photons are not directly observable because they are very strongly absorbed in the nlr and broader ism of the host galaxy , as well as in the ism of the milky way .    up to the present ,",
    "ionizing agn spectra for photoionization modeling have almost exclusively been constructed using piecewise functions of one to three simple power - laws ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "@xcite use a conventional range of power - law indices of @xmath3 to @xmath4 , for a single power - law covering 0.005 to 1  kev .",
    "the authors find that a steeper power - law leads to weaker high - ionization lines and relatively stronger h lines , due to the relative excess of h- but not he - ionizing photons .",
    "a more physically - motivated empirical two - component model for the ionizing spectrum is used , for example , in @xcite ) .    in this work",
    "we seek to develop a modern agn continuum emission model for use as the input spectrum in photoionization models , based on physically - derived models , and including for example ionization effects in the shape of the accretion disk spectrum .",
    "we aim to identify the important agn parameters which influence the shape of the ionizing spectrum and hence the predicted emission - line ratios .",
    "this allows us to minimize the parameter space used to cover a large range of model spectra .",
    "a small parameter space is easier to handle conceptually and computationally , and the process of combining fully and partially degenerate parameters into a smaller set of parameters results in insights into how the shape of the ionizing spectrum may arise from various combinations of fundamental agn parameters .    in photoionization modeling",
    "we assume that the model ionizing spectrum will be intrinsic when it reaches the modeled clouds , i.e.  that there is no significant absorption between the central engine and the modeled clouds .",
    "hence the spectra will primarily feature a peak formed by a superposition of pseudo - blackbodies due to the accretion disk , and a power - law non - thermal component resulting from compton up - scattering of disk photons . a physical model of these spectra",
    "may be expected to be well - described by few parameters .",
    "a detailed model of continuum emission from agn must rely on theoretical emissivities from accretion disk models .",
    "the standard novikov - thorne ` thin disk ' accretion model ( @xcite , building on the work of @xcite ) is applicable over much of the accretion rate regime of seyfert galaxies ( @xmath5 to @xmath6  @xmath7 ) .",
    "this model has parameters such as the smbh mass , spin , and accretion rate , which influence the theoretical ionizing agn spectrum .    understanding how the key parameters control the shape of the ionizing euv - soft x - ray spectrum of agn allows us to produce a model which keeps the number of free parameters to a minimum .",
    "our simplified spectral modeling is , however , based firmly on the optxagnf model @xcite .",
    "we chose this model because it is a recent , widely - used model , it calculates theoretical spectra using physics such as the novikov - thorne thin accretion disk model , and because it uses a ` color temperature correction ' which accounts for electron - scattering opacity in parts of the disk where hydrogen is ionized .",
    "the optxagnf model provides the basis for a new physically - based model of the ionizing agn spectrum for photoionization modeling .",
    "in photoionization modeling , the ionization parameter and density are important input parameters , so the flux incident on the model cloud is easily calculated .",
    "however the actual luminosity of the ionizing source is important only if the modeler is interested in determining the distance of the modeled cloud from the source .",
    "we are primarily concerned with the shape of the ionizing spectrum , because this determines the relative emission - line fluxes .",
    "any parameter redundancies may render more difficult the interpretation of the nlr spectrum caused by a given agn ionizing spectrum . in this work",
    "we identify and explain various spectral - shape degeneracies , such as the complete degeneracy between the black hole mass and luminosity in the novikov - thorne emissivity , and successfully remove the degeneracies by constructing a new model .",
    "we simplify the optxagnf model by carefully removing and merging degenerate parameters . the resulting model , oxaf ,",
    "satisfies our requirements by generating realistic model spectral shapes using the fewest possible parameters , and with all of the parameters having a direct impact on the shape of the model spectrum .",
    "we then investigate the effect of the oxaf parameters on photoionization models of nlr clouds .    in section  [ sec : accretion_models ] we describe the spectral - shape degeneracies that arise in the thin - disc accretion model and in the the optxagnf model , and in section  [ sec : param_reduction ] we describe the parameters used to re - parametrize optxagnf . in section  [ sec : oxaf ]",
    "we explain how these parameters are used to construct our simplified model oxaf and describe the implementation and validation of the new model . in section  [ sec : oxaf_predictions ] we explore how the oxaf parameters affect photoionization model predictions for diagnostic emission lines .",

    "the unified model of agn describes a central , accreting supermassive black hole ( smbh ) surrounded by a broad line region , a dusty obscuring torus , and a narrow - line region @xcite .",
    "the powerful continuum radiation from the central accretion structure illuminates the broad and narrow - line regions .",
    "important parameters which determine the spectrum of the central accretion structure are the eddington ratio @xmath7 , the smbh mass @xmath8 , the dimensionless smbh spin @xmath9 , and the innermost radius at which the disk is directly visible . in this section",
    "we describe the effects of these parameters on the shape of the ionizing spectrum and the relationships between the parameters .",

    "specifying the temperature at a particular normalized radius as well as the spin uniquely determines the ratio @xmath35 such that the parameters @xmath7 and @xmath8 are degenerate in their effects on the spectral shape .",
    "the optxagnf model @xcite is a significant effort in the development of theoretical models of continuum radiation from accretion onto black holes that match observed optical , uv and x - ray continuum spectra .",
    "the model is available for use with the xspec spectral fitting package , under the name optxagnf .",
    "the model aims to capture the essential features of the continuum emission from a relativistic thin accretion disk with a comptonizing corona in the equatorial plane of a rotating black hole .",
    "it is assumed that material is accreted only through the outer disk , and the released gravitational energy is divided between three spectral components :    * a pseudo - thermal accretion disk component * a high - energy , power - law non - thermal component , formed by compton up - scattering from an optically thin , high - temperature medium * an intermediate ( ` soft x - ray excess ' ) component formed by compton up - scattering from a compton - thick , low - temperature medium    the model implements the following :    * the standard @xcite thin - disk relativistic accretion disk emissivity * a disk spectrum produced by summing blackbodies in successive annuli , with the temperature of the blackbody spectrum corrected if necessary using an empirical color temperature correction @xmath36 .",
    "the correction is required due to the absorption opacity varying with temperature , density and wavelength ; in particular it is used where hydrogen is ionized in the inner parts of the disk in an attempt to account for modifications to the spectrum due to the disk not being locally thermalized and due to electron - scattering opacity @xcite .",
    "the correction becomes increasingly important as the temperature of the disk increases ( as the luminosity increases or black hole mass decreases ) . * the disk luminosity between the innermost stable circular orbit @xmath37 and @xmath38 , the ` coronal radius ' ,",
    "is all emitted as comptonized radiation . *",
    "the comptonized radiation is split between the soft , intermediate component ( assumed to arise in the accretion structure itself ) and the hard x - ray power - law tail .",
    "the seed photons for comptonization in both cases come from a blackbody with the same ( corrected ) temperature as the disk at @xmath38 .",
    "* the total luminosity from all three components of the emission ( disk , comptonized soft x - ray excess , comptonized hard x - ray tail ) is fixed by the accretion rate and smbh spin .",
    "the following are the parameters required by optxagnf to characterize the various physical components of the model :    * @xmath8 , the black hole mass * @xmath10 , the agn luminosity in units of the eddington luminosity , which is proportional to @xmath8 .",
    "* @xmath9 , the dimensionless black hole rotation parameter , between 0 and 1 ( assuming prograde accretion ) * @xmath38 , the coronal radius ( inner edge of the visible portion of the disk ) , in units of the gravitational radius ( @xmath19 , proportional to @xmath8 ) * @xmath39 , the outer radius of the modeled disk , in units of the gravitational radius , proportional to @xmath8 * @xmath11 , the temperature of the compton optically thick material which produces the soft x - ray excess * @xmath40 , the optical thickness of the compton optically thick material * @xmath41 , the proportion of the corona power emitted in the hard power - law component ; @xmath42 is the proportion in the compton optically thick component * @xmath1 , the negative of the photon power - law index of the hard x - ray tail component      we explored the behavior of the disk and non - thermal power - law components of the optxagnf model across a wide parameter space ( the parameter ranges given in section  [ sec : reparametrizing ] ) and showed that there are strong spectral - shape degeneracies between key parameters .",
    "the following sections discuss these degeneracies , which are in addition to the total degeneracy between @xmath8 and @xmath10 which originates in the novikov - thorne model .",
    "higher disk temperatures lead to higher - energy disk emission , and in particular the high - energy cutoff of the disk emission is set by the maximum temperature of the directly visible part of the accretion disk .",
    "increasing the temperature of the highest - temperature visible parts of the disk and thereby producing higher - energy disk emission is achievable by increasing @xmath35 ( increasing the luminosity and/or decreasing the mass ) , or alternatively by reducing @xmath38 .",
    "consequently @xmath38 is partially degenerate in its effects on the disk spectrum with @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "the degeneracy is not total , because changing the innermost visible normalized radius modifies the shape of the disk spectrum in ways that changing @xmath35 can not .      changing the spin @xmath9 with the other parameters fixed has the effect of changing the relative flux contribution of the disk and non - thermal components .",
    "this effect is illustrated in figure  [ fig : a_vary ] , which shows models with no intermediate component .",
    "as the spin of a smbh increases , more energy is released by infalling matter ; the additional energy is released close to the smbh event horizon . when we fix the mass , coronal radius and luminosity , increasing the spin serves primarily to apportion more of the fixed luminosity to the part of the disk within the coronal radius , and hence to the non - thermal component .",
    "hence @xmath9 has a similar effect to @xmath38 in that it changes the relative contributions of the disk and non - thermal components .",
    "figure  [ fig : a_vary ] shows that the shape of the two spectral components is not strongly affected by @xmath9 ( with @xmath43  @xmath44 .",
    "however the parameters @xmath38 and @xmath9 are not entirely degenerate in their effects on the spectral shape , since @xmath9 affects the spectral shape through modifying the radial functions @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 in equation  [ eq : t1 ] , whereas @xmath38 determines which values of @xmath17 contribute to the disk emission .",
    "the full and partial degeneracies discussed in the previous sections suggest that @xmath8 , @xmath7 , @xmath38 and @xmath9 could be combined into two parameters in a simplified model of the spectral shape - one parameter which shifts the disk emission in energy space , and one parameter which controls the relative flux between the disk and non - thermal components .    , with the other key optxagnf parameters fixed at @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 . the intermediate component is not considered ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "varying @xmath9 changes the relative contributions of the disk and non - thermal components to the total spectrum .",
    "note that the shape of these components remains relatively independent of @xmath9.,scaledwidth=49.0% ]",
    "we reduce the free parameter space of the optxagnf model by fixing or neglecting some parameters , and by reparametrizing the remaining parameter space .",
    "the origin of the widely - observed soft x - ray excess in agn remains uncertain , despite recent progress .",
    "in particular , two general explanations are currently favored , which attempt to explain the relatively constant energy of the soft excess ( @xmath50  @xmath51  kev ) .",
    "these explanations are comptonized disk emission ( e.g.  the treatment in optxagnf ) , and blurred reflection from the ionized accretion disk ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "additionally , absorption has been seriously considered ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and there is evidence that a contribution to the soft x - ray excess comes from the wider nlr ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the possible physical processes that give rise to the centrally - originating soft excess may be constrained using hard and soft time lags ( hard x - rays lagging soft x - rays and soft x - rays lagging hard x - rays ) and correlations between spectral components .",
    "the time - delay of soft x - ray time lags is strongly correlated with black hole mass @xcite .",
    "each soft x - ray excess photon with energy in the range @xmath52  kev will have less effect on the ionization state of the nebula than a photon with energy in the range @xmath53  kev . in the pilot study of @xcite we found that the intermediate soft x - ray component was not required to achieve satisfactory fits to the optical emission - line spectrum of the seyfert galaxy ngc  5427 with photoionization models , although the observed spectrum did not include high - ionization lines .",
    "we do however expect that the abundances of high ionization potential species such as ( 423  ev ) , ( 361  ev ) and ( 234  ev ) would be affected by dominant soft x - ray excesses .",
    "additionally , a strong soft x - ray excess extends the partially - ionized zone , where auger electrons produced by x - ray bombardment partially ionize the gas , and therefore must to some extent enhance emission of lines such as [ ] and [ ] .",
    "we performed an investigation on the effect of the soft excess on photoionization modeling of nlr clouds , using ionizing spectra from the optxagnf model .",
    "the parameters of the mappings  5.1 ( sutherland et al .",
    "2016 , in prep . )",
    "models and optxangf spectra were fixed , apart from two quantities : the relative strength of the soft excess which ranged from @xmath54 to @xmath55 of the non - thermal flux , and the coronal radius which ranged from @xmath56 to @xmath57 .",
    "the models were ionization - bounded and ended when the nebula was 99% neutral .",
    "the results are presented in standard optical diagnostic diagrams @xcite in figure  [ fig : bptvo_soft_excess ] , with the fiducial model parameter values listed in the caption .",
    "the standard optical diagnostic diagrams use ratios of lines associated with different ionization levels in the gas to distinguish nebulae based on the cause of ionization .",
    "ionization increases from bottom - left to top - right on the diagrams .",
    "the lower - left of each of the diagnostic diagrams is associated with regions of varying metallicity and ionization parameter , whereas the top - right is associated with ionization by harder agn spectra or shocks .",
    "the standard dividing lines on the diagrams are described in the caption .",
    "the results shown in figure  [ fig : bptvo_soft_excess ] confirm that the soft x - ray excess is not of primary importance when predicting diagnostic optical emission - line ratios .",
    "the line ratios are evidently most sensitive to variation in the coronal radius or weighting of spectral components when most of the energy released inside the coronal radius is emitted in the power - law component as opposed to the soft excess .",
    "for the tested @xmath58 values larger than 20  @xmath18 , the [ ] /h@xmath59 and [ ] /h@xmath59 ratios are significantly increased by increasing the proportion of the flux emitted in the power - law tail , resulting in some outlying points to the right of the second and third panel in the figure .",
    "the positions of these points are due to the partially - ionized zone being extended by hard x - rays in improbably hard ionizing spectra .",
    "if we do not consider these power - law dominated models ( shown for completeness ) , the range of points representing the different soft excess strengths is small compared to the variation that may be produced by varying the ionization parameter or metallicity , for example .",
    "if the proportion of the energy emitted in the soft excess as opposed to the power - law component does not vary as strongly between real objects as it does in our experiment , and additionally if real objects are mass - bounded as opposed to ionization - bounded ( i.e.  hard x - rays escape the nlr ) , then the ranges shown in figure  [ fig : bptvo_soft_excess ] would represent approximate upper bounds on the sensitivity to the soft excess .    in the remainder of this work",
    "we do not include the intermediate comptonized component , such that the fraction of the corona power in the power - law tail is set to @xmath60 , and the parameters for the temperature and optical thickness of the comptonizing optically - thick medium have no effect .    neglecting the intermediate component",
    "enables a vast simplification of the model . including the soft excess would complicate the comparison of photoionization models to observed nlr emission - line spectra due to uncertainty regarding the origin , time - averaged behavior , and importance relative to other spectral components of the soft x - ray excess .",
    "we note that recently @xcite attributed @xmath61 of the @xmath62  kev emission observed in the agn ii  zw  177 to the soft excess , with significant variation observed between observations separated by 11  years .",
    "another recent work is a study of the agn re  j1034 + 396 @xcite , in which the best - fitting models suggested that @xmath63 of the power produced inside the coronal radius is emitted in the intermediate component . although the strength of the soft excess has been measured in sources such as ii  zw  177 and re  j1034 + 396 , the properties of the soft x - ray excess across the population of seyfert galaxies , not just those that have been studied in x - rays , are unknown .",
    "the spins of astrophysical black holes have long been expected to be non - zero .",
    "it is now routine to ` map ' the central @xmath64  @xmath18 of agn accretion structures by studying x - ray reverberation lags and blurred accretion disk reflection @xcite .",
    "identifying the innermost radius required by spectral blurring analysis with the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) allows the black hole spin to be measured .",
    "spin measurements performed to date generally demonstrate high spins @xcite . however because radiative efficiency increases by up to a factor of 5 with increasing spin , the very high calculated spins for many agn with spin measurements are associated with a strong selection bias @xcite .",
    "as demonstrated above in section  [ sec : optxagnf_degeneracies ] , the black hole spin is partially degenerate with @xmath38 in that it changes the relative contributions of the disk and non - thermal components to the total spectrum .",
    "the coronal radius will be set larger than radii for which we expect the disk spectrum shape to be strongly affected by the smbh spin .",
    "figure  [ fig : a_vary ] shows that changing the spin changes the relative energy in the disk and non - thermal components by an order of magnitude ( between spins of 0 and 1 ) ; in our simplified model this effect will be accounted for by an explicit parameter for this scaling .",
    "the smbh spin was set to @xmath65 .",
    "the outer disk produces non - ionizing optical and ir emission , and therefore does not contribute to the nlr heating .",
    "the parameter defining the outer edge of the accretion disk was set to @xmath66  @xmath18 , a default value .      as a result of the simplifications discussed in the section  [ sec : neg_params ] ,",
    "the optxagnf parameters have been reduced to the four most important parameters @xmath8 , @xmath67 , @xmath38 and @xmath1 .",
    "exploration of the properties of the theoretical agn spectra and development of a simplified model ( section  [ sec : oxaf ] ) were performed over the following ranges of these four parameters :    * @xmath68 * @xmath69 * @xmath70 * @xmath71  @xmath72  @xmath18    the maximum luminosity of eddington was chosen because the novikov - thorne thin disk model can not plausibly be used beyond this limit ; indeed a _",

    "the broad range in @xmath1 covers the approximate range of observed values ( c.f .",
    "figure  4 in @xcite ) , corresponding to very soft ( @xmath1 = 2.6 ) through to very hard ( @xmath1 = 1.4 ) power - law tails .",
    "the physical extent of the corona has been constrained using analysis of blurred x - ray reflection , modeling of x - ray reverberation , and microlensing observations ; these methods suggest that the comptonizing corona lies within approximately @xmath71  @xmath18 of the black hole @xcite .",
    "however because of the selection bias discussed in section  [ sec : bh_spin_neglected ] , coronal geometries inferred in x - ray studies are not necessarily representative of the population of seyfert galaxies .",
    "we chose a lower bound for the coronal radius of 10  @xmath18 here ; our experimentation showed that below this value the high - energy part of the accretion disk emission becomes too strongly affected by relativistic corrections for easy simplification of the model .",
    "setting a minimum coronal radius of 10  @xmath18 will primarily affect the high - energy part of the accretion disk emission by removing it from the disk spectrum .",
    "the top end of the @xmath38 range was selected to include the range suggested by @xcite .",
    "a highly desirable simplification is combining the three fully or partially degenerate parameters @xmath67 , @xmath8 and @xmath38 into a single parameter that is able to parametrize ( at least approximately ) the position in energy space and shape of the big blue bump ( bbb ) disk emission .",
    "the parameter which was chosen to replace the degenerate trio ( @xmath67 , @xmath8 , @xmath38 ) was @xmath0 , the peak of the bbb when the disk spectrum is given in a log - log plot of energy flux versus energy ( e.g.  figure  [ fig : a_vary ] ) .",

    "the differences are due only to the small scatter in the fit given in equation  [ eq : t_r_cor ] , i.e.  the seed blackbody spectra for oxaf and optxagnf have slightly different temperatures .",
    "the oxaf spectra reproduce the optxagnf models with sufficient accuracy for photoionization modeling of optical diagnostic emission lines .",

    "the reason for this discrepancy is that these lines from low - ionization species are very sensitive to small differences in the shape of the hard photon spectrum since the emission is produced mostly in a partially ionized zone heated by auger electrons .",

    "the overpredicted fluxes from these species could to some extent be due to the nlr clouds being mass - bounded as opposed to ionization - bounded ( as in the models ) , i.e.  more of the high - energy photons escape and the partially - ionized zones are shorter for the observed ensemble of nlr clouds in ngc  1365 compared to the models .      in this section",
    "we discuss figure  [ fig : mappings_grid ] and interpret the effect of each oxaf parameter on the model predictions .",
    "the logarithmically - spaced values of @xmath73 in figure  [ fig : mappings_grid ] show that increasing the energy of the peak of the disk emission , and thereby increasing the energy of the ionizing photons , increases both the relative ionization state and the temperature of the nebula .",
    "the sensitivity of optical diagnostic line ratios to @xmath73 is comparable to the sensitivity to the ionization parameter .",
    "we first consider the expected range of values of @xmath107 .",
    "@xcite study a sample of 51 unobscured seyfert  1 galaxies and fit the full three - component optxagnf model to the observed seds .",
    "the proportion of the bolometric luminosity emitted in the power - law component in the best - fit model is less than 0.05 for @xmath166 of the sample , less than 0.2 for @xmath167 of the sample , and less than 0.4 for @xmath168 of the sample .",
    "although the soft excess is a significant component ( allocated more flux than the power - law component for @xmath169 of the sample ) , it is effectively an extension of accretion disk emission to higher energies , so the proportion of flux in the power - law tail is comparable to the @xmath107 oxaf parameter .",

    "for @xmath73  =  32  ev , @xmath1  =  1.8 , @xmath178  u  =  -2.0 and z  =  1.5  z@xmath179 , variation of @xmath107 from 0.1 to 0.7 increased the length of the modeled cloud by a factor of @xmath180 to 1.5  pc .",
    "extending the partially - ionized zone increases the [ ] /h@xmath59 and [ ] /h@xmath59 line ratios , as the figure shows for @xmath181 .      for values of @xmath182 , the predicted emission - line ratios do not show strong sensitivity to @xmath1 .",
    "figure  [ fig : mappings_grid ] shows how as @xmath1 increases , [ ] and [ ] line emission is enhanced relative to h@xmath59 . increasing @xmath1 allocates more of the non - thermal energy to relatively soft x - ray photons which are more easily absorbed by the nebula , causing more emission in the partially ionized zone .",
    "hence @xmath1 has a similar effect to @xmath107 . as @xmath107 increases , the sensitivity to @xmath1 increases due to the greater relative effect of x - ray power - law photons on the nebula ionization structure .",

    "<S> our re - parametrized model oxaf removes these degeneracies and accepts three parameters which directly describe the output spectral shape : the energy of the peak of the accretion disk emission @xmath0 , the photon power - law index of the non - thermal emission @xmath1 , and the proportion of the total flux which is emitted in the non - thermal component @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the parameter @xmath0 is presented as a function of the black hole mass , agn luminosity , and ` coronal radius ' of the optxagnf model upon which oxaf is based . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the soft x - ray excess does not significantly affect photoionization modeling predictions of strong emission lines in seyfert narrow - line regions . despite its simplicity , </S>",
    "<S> oxaf accounts for opacity effects where the accretion disk is ionized because it inherits the ` color correction ' of optxagnf . </S>",
    "<S> we use a grid of mappings photoionization models with oxaf ionizing spectra to demonstrate how predicted emission - line ratios on standard optical diagnostic diagrams are sensitive to each of the three oxaf parameters . </S>",
