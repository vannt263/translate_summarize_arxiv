    "the close mathematical and physical connection between the laws of black hole physics and the laws of thermodynamics provides the main foundation for ideas and speculations on the nature of quantum gravity in the strong field regime .",
    "many aspects of black hole thermodynamics are on a completely firm foundation , such as the classical laws of black hole mechanics and the fact that black holes radiate via the hawking process as perfect black bodies ( of finite size ) at temperature @xmath2 where @xmath3 denotes the surface gravity of the black hole ( see , e.g. , @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "nevertheless , there remain some unresolved and/or controversial issues in black hole thermodynamics .",
    "one relatively minor unresolved issue concerns the `` physical process version '' of the first law of classical black hole mechanics for charged black holes .",
    "consider a linear perturbation of a stationary , electrovac black hole corresponding to taking one to another stationary , electrovac black hole .",
    "then , as originally shown by bardeen , carter , and hawking @xcite ( see @xcite for a generalized version ) the first order variations of the area @xmath4 , mass @xmath5 , angular momentum @xmath6 , and charge @xmath7 are related by @xmath8 where @xmath9 denotes the angular velocity of the horizon and @xmath10 denotes the electrostatic potential of the horizon ( i.e. , @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the horizon killing field )",
    ". however , it also is possible to consider a `` physical process '' wherein some charged matter is thrown into an initially stationary , electrovac black hole . assuming that the black hole eventually settles down to a final stationary state",
    ", one may calculate the change in black hole area , @xmath13 , using the raychaudhuri equation and compare it with @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 .",
    "if eq.([pverf ] ) were to fail , this would give rise to an inconsistency with the assumption that the black hole settles down to a final stationary state , and would thereby provide strong evidence against cosmic censorship .",
    "conversely , a proof of the `` physical process '' version of the first law would provide support for cosmic censorship .",
    "a proof of the `` physical process '' version of the first law for uncharged black holes was given in @xcite .",
    "however , some difficulties arise in extending this proof to the charged case .",
    "one of the purposes of this paper is to remedy these difficulties by showing that eq.([pverf ] ) holds for all physical processes .",
    "a crucial issue in black hole thermodynamics is the validity of the generalized second law ( gsl ) , which states that the total generalized entropy @xmath17 never decreases @xcite , where @xmath18 is the ordinary entropy of matter outside the black hole and , in general relativity , @xmath19 .",
    "early arguments by bekenstein for the validity of this law in quasi - static lowering processes required the assumption that ordinary matter must obey an entropy bound of the form @xcite @xmath20 in order to prevent the box from being lowered too close to the black hole .",
    "an alternative resolution not requiring any entropy bounds on matter was given by unruh and wald @xcite , taking into account the quantum buoyancy force of the thermal atmosphere surrounding the black hole .",
    "this analysis has been criticized by bekenstein on a variety of grounds @xcite-@xcite ; see @xcite and @xcite for responses to @xcite and @xcite .",
    "recently , it has been argued that even stronger entropy bounds than ( [ entb ] ) are needed for charged and rotating black holes @xcite-@xcite .",
    "these arguments have been countered for charged black holes by shimomura and mukohyama @xcite .    in view of the above situation",
    ", it seems worthwhile to give a new , general analysis of the validity of the gsl in quasi - static lowering processes that is applicable to charged and rotating black holes and invokes no model dependent assumptions concerning the thermal atmosphere and the contents of the box , or assumptions about the size and shape of the box ( other than that it is much smaller than the black hole but large enough that a thermodynamic treatment of the thermal atmosphere is adequate ) . in this paper",
    "we shall give such an analysis .",
    "our key assumptions are as follows :    1 .",
    "the thermal atmosphere admits a suitable local thermodynamic description with respect to observers following orbits of the horizon killing field , @xmath12 .",
    "furthermore , the thermal atmosphere is in thermal equilibrium with itself .",
    "more precisely , we can not increase the entropy of the thermal atmosphere by any rearrangement of it that keeps fixed its total mass , angular momentum , and charge , as well as other conserved quantities , such as the number of particles of a given species .",
    "the thermal atmosphere is in thermal equilibrium with the black hole at temperature eq.([th ] ) .",
    "more precisely , we can not increase the total generalized entropy of the black hole / thermal atmosphere system by any rearrangement that keeps fixed the total mass , angular momentum , and charge of the total system .",
    "we consider processes in which a box containing arbitrary matter and charge is quasi - statically lowered toward the black hole and then `` released '' , so that the box or its contents are dropped into the black hole and/or allowed to thermalize with the thermal atmosphere",
    ". we will show that if the contents of the box are in thermal equilibrium , no decrease in the total generalized entropy can occur during the `` lowering phase '' of a quasi - static process .",
    "however , in the `` release phase '' , the total mass , angular momentum , and charge do not change . consequently , since the black hole / thermal atmosphere system is assumed to have maximum generalized entropy at fixed mass , angular momentum , and charge , the generalized entropy can not decrease in the `` release phase '' either .    a key ingredient in our analysis of both the `` physical process '' version of the first law and the gsl is a general formula for the variation of adm mass , @xmath14 , and angular momentum , @xmath15 , for perturbations of stationary or , respectively , axisymmetric electrovac spacetimes . in section 2",

    ", we will give a proof of the physical process version of the first law based on the above formulas .",
    "in section 4 , we will establish properties of the thermal atmosphere around a black hole that follow from the assumptions stated above .",
    "the process of quasi - statically lowering a box filled with matter towards a black hole and then releasing it will be considered in section 5 , and it will be shown that the gsl holds in such processes .",
    "our analysis of the lowering process is compatible with ( i.e. , it does not conflict with ) the recent analysis of shimomura and mukohyama @xcite for charged , nonrotating black holes , but some of our arguments are quite different from theirs , and we also clarify and generalize some aspects of their derivation , includes ( or should include ) the electromagnetic interaction energy of the charged matter with the background electromagnetic field .",

    "we make some concluding remarks in section 6 . in particular , we give an independent argument that if the gsl could be violated in a quasi - static lowering and release process involving a black hole , then there should be a corresponding process involving a self - gravitating system that does not contain a black hole in which the ordinary second law would be violated .",
    "finally , in the appendix we give a general derivation of the force needed to hold in place a box containing charged matter in a stationary ( but not necessarily static ) spacetime .",
    "in this section , we first consider the general issue of calculating the first order variation of conserved quantities in a diffeomorphism covariant theory of gravity in the case where the first order perturbation is not required to satisfy the source free equations ( except near infinity )",

    ", work may be done by an external agent , so that the total energy contained in the box / black hole / thermal atmosphere system may change .",
    "( 2 ) a non - quasi - static process in which the box is dropped into the black hole or otherwise destroyed , and the system is allowed to thermalize .",
    "no change in the total energy or charge of the complete system occurs in this stage .",
    "we will argue that the total generalized entropy , @xmath257 , can not decrease in either of these stages .",
    "consider , first , the quasi - static lowering process . at",
    "any given time during this process , the total generalized entropy , @xmath257 of the system can be written as @xmath258 here , @xmath259 denotes the total entropy contained in the box , and @xmath249 denotes the total entropy that the combined black hole / thermal atmosphere system would have at the given values of @xmath260 and @xmath10 if the box were not present . finally , @xmath261 denotes the entropy of the displaced thermal atmosphere , i.e. , the entropy that would have been contained in the thermal atmosphere ( at the given values of @xmath260 and @xmath10 ) within the region occupied by the box .",
    "we now focus attention on @xmath259 .",
    "it is instructive to consider , first , the case where the box initially is `` empty '' , i.e. , the initial state of the fields inside the box is the natural vacuum / ground state relative to the notion of time translations defined by @xmath12 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "then , we claim that if the lowering process is sufficiently slow , no `` particle creation '' will occur as the box is lowered , and the box will remain in its ground state . in other words , an empty box will remain empty as it is quasi - statically lowered . by definition ,",
    "the casimir energy of the box is the difference between the energy contained in the empty box and the energy that would be contained in the boulware vacuum in the region of space occupied by the box .",
    "( recall here that by `` energy '' , @xmath218 , we mean the conserved quantity conjugate to the horizon killing field @xmath12 rather than the asymptotic time translation @xmath110 , i.e. , @xmath262 ( see eq.([edef ] ) above ) . )",
    "if we neglect possible changes in the casimir energy of the box as it is lowered , it follows that in the lowering process for an empty box , we have @xmath263 where @xmath264 denotes the difference in the energies contained in the box at two stages of the lowering process , and @xmath265 denotes the difference in the boulware vacuum energies in the corresponding volumes .",

    "however , this radiation by the walls of the box is independent of the contents of the box . therefore , in all cases ( i.e. , whether or not the box is empty ) , the change in the charge of the box as it is lowered is given by eq.([dq ] ) .",
    "however , eq.([de ] ) holds only for the empty box , since the total energy contained within the box can vary due to redshifting of the energy of the contents of the box as well as by radiation by the walls of the box .",
    "now suppose that the box is initially filled with ( possibly charged ) matter that is in thermal equilibrium .",
    "as the box is lowered , the matter will , in general , redistribute itself within the box due to the changing electromagnetic and gravitational fields .",
    "however , if the box is lowered sufficiently slowly , the matter will remain in thermal equilibrium as it is lowered .",
    "observers inside of the box will view the process as being isentropic for the same reason as slow variations of parameters in the hamiltonian result in isentropic processes in flat spacetime physics .",
    "thus , the entropy above the ground state must remain constant as the box is lowered .",
    "taking into account the possibility that the ground state entropy is nonzero due to `` renormalization '' as discussed in the previous section , we see that in a slow lowering process where the matter is initially in thermal equilibrium , we have @xmath270 , where @xmath271 denotes the entropy of the boulware vacuum in the region occupied by the box .",
    "equivalently , we have @xmath272 , where in accord with the notation of the previous section , @xmath273 .",
    "finally , suppose now that the box is initially filled with arbitrary matter , not necessarily in thermal equilibrium .",

    "observers inside the box will see an increase  or , at least , a non - decrease  of entropy relative to the ground state during the lowering process for the same reason that the ordinary second law of thermodynamics holds in flat spacetime physics .",
    "consequently , we conclude that whatever is initially placed inside the box , we have @xmath274 during the lowering process .",
    "we now turn our attention to the calculation of the change , @xmath275 , in @xmath249 during the lowering process . by eq.([varsc ] ) , we have @xmath276 so we need to calculate the energy , @xmath277 , and charge , @xmath278 delivered to the black hole / thermal atmosphere system during the lowering process . the total charge of the entire system is @xmath279 so by conservation of charge , we have @xmath280 we already found above that @xmath281 ( see eq.([dq ] ) ) , so we have @xmath282    to calculate @xmath277 , we note that this quantity can not depend upon what is placed inside the box during the lowering process , so it suffices to restrict attention to the case where the box is empty . in that case",

    "as shown in the appendix , the net force @xmath285 exerted by an external agent at redshift @xmath286 on a stationary box whose size is much smaller than the scales set by curvature is given by",

    "equation ( [ w ] ) is easiest to analyze in the case of a rectangular box with `` top '' and `` bottom '' faces perpendicular to @xmath288 . in that case ,",
    "eq.([w ] ) corresponds to performing a volume integral of @xmath292 over the spatial region swept out by the top face of the box , and subtracting from it the similar integral over the spatial region swept out by the bottom face .",

    "we now apply the integrated gibbs - duhem relation ( [ gd3 ] ) for the thermal atmosphere .",

    "we assume that at the end of this process , the final state of the system is that of a black hole in equilibrium with its thermal atmosphere .",
    "although the `` dropping process '' is a highly nonequilibrium process and we can not analyze the time evolution of the total entropy during this process , it is clear that if the second assumption of section 1 holds , the total generalized entropy , @xmath257 , can not decrease in this process .",
    "namely , during the `` dropping process '' the total mass , angular momentum , and charge of the system remain constant .",
    "however , assumption ( 2 ) asserts that the final state maximizes the total generalized entropy at the given values of total mass , angular momentum , and charge .",
    "therefore , the initial state could not have had more generalized entropy than the final state .",
    "consequently , under the assumptions stated in section 1 as well as our assumptions about the thermodynamic properties of the thermal atmosphere stated in section 4 , the gsl can not be violated in any quasi - static lowering / dropping process .",
    "in this paper , we have established the validity of the gsl in arbitrary quasi - static lowering / dropping processes for charged and rotating black holes , without the need to assume any entropy bounds for matter .",
    "our analysis depends , primarily , only on the two very general assumptions stated in section 1 .",
    "it thereby generalizes and simplifies previous analyses of such processes .",
    "however , it should be noted that during the course of our analysis , we made several simplifying assumptions concerning the thermodynamic properties of the thermal atmosphere .",
    "in particular , it was assumed that stationary observers would ( i ) assign a locally homogeneous entropy density @xmath177 to the thermal atmosphere that is valid on all relevant scales and ( ii ) that @xmath177 is a function only of @xmath178 , @xmath179 , and @xmath180 .",
    "the first assumption need not be valid if one considers boxes whose size is small compared with the wavelength of the ambient thermal atmosphere ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the second assumption could fail because the formula for @xmath177 might also depend nontrivially upon `` location in the gravitational field '' ( e.g. , depend upon the local value of the curvature and/or derivatives of @xmath12 ) .    in this concluding section ,",
    "we wish to argue that if the breakdown of any such simplifying assumptions about the thermal atmosphere were to allow one to violate the gsl , they also would allow one to violate the ordinary second law .",
    "specifically , suppose that  on account of , say , the breakdown of assumptions ( i ) or ( ii ) of the previous paragraph  it were possible to violate the gsl in a quasi - static lowering / dropping process . since the validity of the gsl during the `` dropping '' phase does not depend upon any simplifying assumptions about the thermal atmosphere , it follows that a violation of the gsl must occur in the lowering phase .",
    "now , in the lowering phase , the box will stay some finite distance , @xmath298 , outside of the horizon of the black hole .",
    "then , it should be possible , in principle , to construct a ( charged and rotating ) shell with a perfectly reflecting surface whose exterior gravitational and electromagnetic fields are coincide with those of the black hole at distances greater than @xmath298 from the horizon .",
    "we can enclose this shell in a cavity of the same size as used for the black hole and then fill this cavity with `` real '' thermal radiation in such a way that its temperature is @xmath299 , its potential @xmath235 is equal to @xmath10 and the potentials @xmath253 are equal to zero .",
    "( this can be accomplished by supplying the atmosphere with the appropriate amounts of energy , charge , and other conserved quantities .",
    ") there may be slight differences between the properties of the thermal atmosphere of the black hole and those of the `` real '' atmosphere around the shell that we have put in `` by hand '' on account of slight differences between the ground states and modes in the two cases .",
    "however , these differences can be made arbitrarily small by choosing the radius of the shell to be arbitrarily close to the horizon radius of the black hole .",
    "now , the analysis of lowering process given in the previous section applies without change to a lowering process where the black hole / thermal atmosphere system is replaced by the shell surrounded by a `` real '' atmosphere , provided that the subscript `` @xmath300 '' is now interpreted as referring to the `` real '' atmosphere around the shell .",
    "the values of @xmath249 , @xmath301 , etc . may be very different for the `` real '' atmosphere around the shell as compared with the black hole / thermal atmosphere system , but the variations of these quantities during the lowering process will be the same ( provided that the radius of the shell is sufficiently close to the horizon radius of the black hole ) .",
    "it follows that if a lowering process that decreases the total generalized entropy can be done in the black hole case , a corresponding lowering process in the case of the shell will decrease the total ordinary entropy .",
    "thus , if the gsl can be violated , then a corresponding process will violate the ordinary second law .",

    "thus , we obtain @xmath326    we now contract this equation with @xmath327 , using @xmath328 here we have used the identity @xmath329 that holds for any vector field @xmath330 in the class that projects to @xmath214 , and we also changed @xmath331 to @xmath332 in the second term since @xmath333 has both indices perpendicular to @xmath12 .",
    "we thus obtain , @xmath334-\\chi t^{ab } d_b e_a   \\label{leim}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    by construction , @xmath335 vanishes at the point where the string is attached to the box .",
    "if the geometry of @xmath214 were flat , then @xmath336 would vanish identically throughout the box . since the geometry of @xmath214 is not flat",
    ", @xmath335 is , in general , nonvanishing .",
    "however , its magnitude is bounded by the size of the box times the curvature of @xmath214 . therefore , for a box whose size is small compared with the scales set by the curvature of @xmath214 , the last term in eq.([leim ] ) will be negligible compared with the other terms in that equation .",
    "therefore , we shall drop this term .    integrating the remaining three terms in eq.([leim ] ) over the volume , @xmath140 , enclosed by @xmath319 and using gauss s law , we obtain @xmath337 + \\int_{c}\\chi t^{ab } e_a n_b ds    \\label{f111}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the natural volume elements ( with respect to @xmath313 ) on @xmath140 and @xmath319 are understood , and @xmath127 is the unit , outward pointing normal to @xmath319 .",
    "we now `` shrink @xmath319 down '' so that it just barely encloses the box and string . in this limit",
    ", the volume integral receives no contribution from the string ( since we assume that @xmath338 on the string ) , and the surface term also receives no contribution from the portion surrounding the string ( since the area of this portion goes to zero ) , except for the contribution @xmath339 arising from the endpoint of the string held by the external agent , where @xmath286 denotes the value of @xmath216 at this endpoint . since @xmath340 is just the force that the external agent must exert to counterbalance the tension / pressure of the string and thereby hold the box in place , we obtain the desired general expression for the force needed to hold the box in place , @xmath341 + \\int_{\\partial b}\\chi t^{cb } e_c n_b ds \\right )   \\label{f11}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the volume integral is now taken over the box , @xmath342 , and the surface integral is taken over the boundary of the box , @xmath343 .",
    "the first term in the volume integral can be interpreted as the `` weight '' of the contents of the box .",
    "note that @xmath344 includes only the non - electromagnetic energy density , i.e. , neither the electromagnetic self - energy of charges within the box nor their interaction energy with external electromagnetic fields contribute to the first term .",
    "the second term is just the lorentz force on the charge distribution in the box ( including `` self - force '' effects ) .",
    "the final term corresponds to the buoyancy force exerted on the box by the matter surrounding the box .",
    "we now specialize this result to the case of a box held near a black hole , which is surrounded by the thermal atmosphere of the black hole . in this case , we take @xmath12 to be the horizon killing field , eq.([horkill ] ) .",
    "however , there is no reason to expect the true , renormalized charge - current , @xmath103 , will be of the form ( [ ju ] ) nor do we expect the renormalized nonelectromagnetic stress - energy tensor , @xmath312 , to be of the form ( [ noest ] ) , since the charge - current and stress - energy of the boulware vacuum would not be expected to have this form .",
    "however , it seems reasonable to expect that the differences , @xmath166 and @xmath345 , between the true charge - current and stress - energy and those of the boulware vacuum ( see eqs.([ttilde ] ) and ( [ jtilde ] ) above ) will have this form .",
    "now , the total stress - energy , @xmath346 , of the boulware vacuum must be conserved , so @xmath347 also is conserved .",
    "if treat both @xmath348 and @xmath349 as small perturbations of the electromagnetic stress - energy tensor of the black hole ( so that only linear terms in the deviation from the background black hole electromagnetic stress - energy are kept ) , then a repetition of the steps in the above derivation shows that in this case , eq.([f11 ] ) continues to hold , provided only that @xmath344 , @xmath350 , and @xmath333 are replaced by their `` tilded '' counterparts , i.e. , we have @xmath351 + \\int_{\\partial b}\\chi \\tilde{t}^{ab } e_a n_b ds \\label{f11tilde}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath352 and @xmath353 with @xmath27 is the vector potential of the background black hole .    finally , for the case where the thermal atmosphere surrounds the box , @xmath345 outside of the box will have a perfect fluid form , so eq.([f11tilde ] ) further simplifies to @xmath354 + \\int_{\\partial b}\\chi \\tilde{p } e_a n^a ds \\label{f11tilde2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for the case of an empty box ( @xmath355 ) , we obtain eq.([f ] ) used in our analysis in section 5 .",
