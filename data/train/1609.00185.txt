    "in the natural ecosystem , forests play an important role .",
    "this has motivated a lot of people to propose computer simulators as well as mathematical models to describe the dynamical properties of forests .",
    "many computer simulators ( also sometimes called individual based models ( ibms ) ) have been proposed and we refer to jabowa ( @xcite ) , foret @xcite , sortie @xcite , formind @xcite and others .",
    "these models consist of stochastic processes describing individual behaviors , such as birth , death , movement , reproduction and so on .",
    "moreover , these models also permit to describe the behavior of the entire plant community .",
    "the main advantage is that it provides simulated data which can be used to analyze such a complex system .",
    "of course this is a rough description of the real plant community .",
    "however , they do supply powerful experimental tools and describe the forest dynamics reasonably well @xcite .",
    "we refer to @xcite for a general review about forest ibms .",
    "sortie is a forest simulator based on the forest data observed in and around great mountain forest ( gmf ) , a privately owned 2500 ha forest located in northwestern connecticut ( 41@xmath057n , 73@xmath115w ) , usa in the year 1990 - 1992 . in sortie , four submodels ( resource , growth , mortality , and recruitment ) are included to determine the behaviour of each individual .",
    "as is explained in @xcite , sortie includes only the light limitation as the competition for resources , since little evidence of the effects of water or nitrogen on the growth has been found after extra experiments are performed .",
    "tree growth is described by change of tree size , which is denoted here as the diameter at a certain height .",
    "two concepts `` @xmath2 ( diameter at 10 cm height ) '' and `` dbh ( diameter at breast height ) '' are often used to describe the tree growth and represent the tree size in the analysis of forest dynamics ( @xcite ) .",
    "thereinto , the @xmath2 can be used almost throughout the whole life of an individual , from seedling to adult , while dbh can only be used for adults in most cases , as it is measured at a higher height .",
    "the definition of the breast height ( of an adult human being ) is different in different regions , for example , 1.4 m in the us and 1.3 m in europe and canada .",
    "but it makes little difference to the measuring result in many cases .",
    "we refer to @xcite for more details of sortie .    in this article we will extend the model proposed by hal smith in @xcite to describe the dynamic of a population that is structured in size with intra - specific competition for light . for a single species",
    ", we will compare such a mathematical model with sortie model for two types of tree ( american beech ( fagr ) and eastern hemlock ( tsca ) ) .",
    "moreover , based on the parameters estimated separately for each kind of tree , we will investigate the inter - specific competition for light by assuming that the growth rate is influenced by the competition for light .",
    "we will also extend our modelling effort by considering the case of two populations distributed in space and competing for light .",
    "several mathematical models describing the forest growth were proposed in the literature .",
    "zavala et al .",
    "@xcite studied a stage - structured population model incorporating the light competition respectively in growth , mortality and recruitment , and gave the conditions for the existence of a steady state distribution .",
    "angulo et al .",
    "@xcite continued with a similar model , but considering the light competition only in recruitment , and they extended it to a two - species stand , and gave the positive stationary distribution for both single - species and two - species model , and the conditions for the coexistence .",
    "cammarano @xcite studied a system of lotka - volterra type , incorporating also the light competition and discussed the equilibriums and the coexistence conditions . in this article , based on sortie simulated data",
    ", we will exclude the competition occurring in the mortality and recruitment .",
    "in other words , we will see that the best fit for sortie model is obtained by using a model where the competition for light influences only the growth rate of trees .",
    "we also refer to @xcite and the references therein for more kinds of models and researches .",
    "the article is organised as follows . in section 2",
    "we will give a mathematical model for single species , and we will conduct numerical simulations to compare with sortie . in section 3 a mathematical model for two species",
    "is obtained likewise , and we also conduct the comparison with sortie",
    ". then in section 4 we extend it to a 2-dimension spatial model , and conduct numerical simulations to see the spread of trees in space .",
    "in this section we consider the following model describing the growth of trees of single species @xmath3 here @xmath4 denotes the population density of trees with size @xmath5 at time @xmath6 , so @xmath7 is the number of trees with size @xmath8 $ ] at time @xmath6 , and @xmath9 is the number of adult population at time @xmath6 .",
    "the size @xmath5 is described by a function of @xmath2 , which we will see in the appendix .",
    "the function @xmath10 is the natural mortality .",
    "the minimal size of a juvenile is denoted as @xmath11 .",
    "the parameter @xmath12 is the birth rate in absence of birth limitation , and the term @xmath13 describes the flux of newborns into the population , where @xmath14 is the ricker s type birth limitation ( @xcite ) . the growth function @xmath15 takes the form @xmath16which is decreasing , thus taking care of the fact that the more large trees there are , the slower the growth rate of small trees is .",
    "so this shows the type of competition for light between adults and juveniles .",
    "the function @xmath17 represents the initial distribution of the species .",
    "normally we want the number of the total population to be finite at each time , hence we have @xmath18so the natural state space for this model is @xmath19 .",
    "we will derive the following equations for adults and juveniles under some assumptions :    @xmath20    where @xmath21 represents the population density of juveniles with size @xmath22 at time @xmath6 , and the positive constant @xmath23 satisfying @xmath24 denotes the maximal size of a juvenile ( or the minimal size of an adult ) .",
    "hence the total number of juveniles at time @xmath6 is @xmath25 and we can assume as follows the adult population number @xmath26 by integrating along the characteristic line of the second equation ( of juvenile ) in , the first equation ( of adult ) in ( [ eq2.3 ] ) can be rewritten as the following state dependent functional differential equation ( fde ) @xmath27 when @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is defined as @xmath30differentiation of the second equation with respect to @xmath6 gives the following system @xmath31the initial conditions are @xmath32;\\ \\tau ( 0)=\\tau _ { 0}\\geqslant 0,\\ ] ] where @xmath33 is continuous and exponentially bounded , namely for some @xmath34 @xmath35from the second equation of ( [ eq2.5 ] ) , as @xmath36 is decreasing , the delay @xmath37 can become large enough , namely we may have infinite delay .",
    "for all the derivation here , see appendix [ appa ] .",
    "we conduct numerical simulations for two special cases of the system . +",
    "* * special case 1 ( * * @xmath15 *  is constant ) : * assume that @xmath15 is a constant function ( so the delay @xmath37 is also constant by the second equation of ) and @xmath38 .",
    "then since the pde model can be transformed ( by making a simple change of variable in time ) into an age structured model , it is known ( see magal and ruan @xcite ) that the system has a hopf bifurcation around the positive equilibrium when @xmath12 increases ( see in figure [ fig5 ] ) .     in figure ( a ) and ( c ) , and the corresponding delay @xmath37 in figure ( b ) and ( d ) .",
    "we fix the parameter values @xmath39",
    ", @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and the initial distribution @xmath46 $ ] .",
    "in ( a ) and ( b ) we set @xmath47 .",
    "the solution oscillates and then converges to the positive equilibrium . in ( c ) and ( d ) we set @xmath48 . changing @xmath49 from 9 to 25 , we observe a hopf bifurcation.__,scaledwidth=90.0% ]    * * special case 2 ( * * @xmath50 * ) : * assume @xmath50 , namely the ricker s type birth function does nt appear in system .",
    "it is known that when @xmath51 is constant in the first equation ( which becomes linear ) of system , this system is either exponentially increasing or exponentially decreasing when the time goes to infinity .",
    "however , it has been proved by smith @xcite that hopf bifurcation can occur when we take state - dependent delay .",
    "this is illustrated in figure [ fig6 ] .     in figure ( a ) and ( c ) , and the corresponding delay @xmath37 in figure ( b ) and ( d ) .",

    "changing @xmath49 from 2.2 to 4 , we observe a hopf bifurcation.__,scaledwidth=90.0% ]      we run the simulator sortie with the parameter values given in @xcite and get the simulation for the density of adult trees ( adults are defined here as trees having a dbh @xmath59 10 cm ) . and",
    "as we can see from this simulation , american beech(fagr ) and eastern hemlock(tsca ) become the dominant species after a period time .",
    "so in this article we will focus on these two species in two cases : one single species and two - species .",
    "the basic idea of the numerical simulation of ( [ eq2.5 ] ) and comparison is as follows . before starting ,",
    "we need to get the forest data from sortie .",
    "since every run of sortie is initiated with a random seed , we conduct 50 runs and take the average values as our actual data . moreover , the data that sortie gives are actually the density of the adult population per hectare . as the area of the sample square is @xmath60 ( a square of 300m@xmath61300 m ) = 9 hectares , we multiply the data by 9 to obtain the total adult population number .",
    "we plot them and the average in matlab .",
    "now we will compare our model ( [ eq2.5 ] ) with the mean value over these 50 runs of sortie , and find the best fit .",
    "first we need to decide the initial time ( for example , @xmath62 as the initial time ) , and we will use the data from sortie over the time interval @xmath63 $ ] as the initial condition . next we discretize the parameters @xmath64 , and for each set of parameters , we calculate the solution of ( [ eq2.5 ] ) by using the common approximation of the derivative ( the numerical scheme will be conducted via the equivalent system ( [ eq2.6 ] ) ) , and we compare the numerical solutions with the data from sortie by using the least square method , to find the set of parameter values with which the numerical result of the model ( [ eq2.5 ] ) and the data have the least difference .",
    "then we use the following formula ( see appendix [ appa])@xmath65 to compute @xmath66 , where we use the simpson s rule to calculate the integral . now we can keep this set of parameter values , and we have the best fit to sortie .    for the first dominant species american beech",
    ", we choose the sortie data in the time interval [ 0,200 ] as the initial distribution .",
    "we have the best fit in table [ table1 ] and figure [ fig8 ] .",
    "is plotted in ( a ) and the delay @xmath37 is shown in ( b).__,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    similarly , for the second dominant species eastern hemlock we choose the sortie data in the time interval [ 0,180 ] as the initial distribution .",
    "we get the best fit in table [ table2 ] and figure [ fig9 ] .",
    "is plotted in ( a ) and the delay @xmath37 is shown in ( b ) .",
    "notice that this species will have an oscillation before it converges to the stable positive equilibrium.__,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    notice that for both species in the single species case , we have @xmath67 as the best fit , which means that there is no ricker s type birth limitation here .",
    "system ( [ eq2.1 ] ) can be extended to the case of two species . taking the previous best fit @xmath68 into account , we obtain the following system    @xmath69    where @xmath70 and @xmath71 are nonnegative constants , @xmath72 , @xmath73 . notice that we use the same minimal juvenile size @xmath74 and minimal adult size @xmath75 for both species(@xcite ) .",
    "after a similar derivation , we have the following state - dependent delay differential equations @xmath76 @xmath77 .",
    "we give the following expression for the sake of numerical simulation : @xmath78      we use the same method of comparison as before and we use the parameters in table [ table1 ] and table [ table2 ] to simulate the two - species model .",

    "studies of forest dynamics have a long history .",
    "there have been a large amount of researches on either the descriptive model for forests reached by observed data , or the pure mathematical model with numerical computations , separated from data .",
    "here we first construct a mathematical model and compare this model to the computer forest simulator sortie .",
    "to our best knowledge there is no similar work in the literature .",
    "we start by fitting the parameters of the model by considering the case of a single species .",
    "then for two species , we only fit the parameters corresponding to the competition for light between the two species of trees . specifically speaking",
    ", we use a classical size - structured model , from which we derive a state - dependent delay differential equation , and we use this differential equation to fit the forest data from sortie .",
    "this differential equation is mathematically more tractable than the submodels in sortie .    in order to compare our mathematical model with sortie , we conduct numerical simulations and we get the best fit to the sortie forest data and the corresponding parameter values .",
    "one result we get is that the type of birth function of these two species is not of ricker s type , as we have @xmath54 in both best fits .",
    "we then extend our mathematical model to a two - species case with interspecific competition , and similarly we conduct the numerical comparison with sortie forest data , where we also get a very good fit .",
    "based on this , we go further and propose a model incorporating the spatial position parameter , to describe the density of population , or further , the number of population at every specific spatial position .",
    "we can see vividly the spread and succession in our numerical simulation . by using a spatial model ,",
    "given the initial distribution we will be able to predict specifically the population at certain spatial position and time , which is more practical in reality .    in our simulation",
    ", we reach a result that the population number of eastern hemlock decreases to 0 after a long enough time , which conforms to the competitive exclusion principle .",
    "however , by analyzing the existence of the interior coexistent equilibrium , we are able to establish a range of parameters in which the exclusion principle is no longer true .",
    "the coexistence result has also been confirmed by numerical simulations ( with and without space ) .",
    "we refer to @xcite for more result going into that direction .",
    "but there are few results about the coexistence for the solution of the structured model .",
    "also it is well known that light is a key influence in many forest systems ( @xcite ) , and our model can be used to reproduce the complicated mechanisms included into sortie model .",
    "but in reality , there are so many influencing factors , such as carbon , nitrogen , water , etc.(@xcite ) , not only restricted to light .",
    "a lot of work is left for future investigation .",
    "the single species model ( [ eq2.1 ] ) we consider here is very similar with the one considered by h. smith in @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , our mortality rate @xmath104 is dependent on the size @xmath5 , so we will re - derive the state dependent fde for completeness . differentiating ( [ eq2.4 ] ) with respect to @xmath6",
