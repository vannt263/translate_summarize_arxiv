    "photoemission experiments provide important information about the electronic single - particle excitation spectrum of solids.@xcite for weakly correlated materials this is essentially given by the density of states ( dos ) obtained by , e.g. , density functional theory in combination with the local density approximation ( lda).@xcite in many cases the agreement between lda and experiment turns out to be very good .",
    "however , there is a class of materials where the discrepancy between the measured and calculated spectra is significant.@xcite for these strongly correlated electron systems there is a clear demand for new theoretical and computational approaches .",
    "the recently developed lda+dmft method , a combination of the lda and the dynamical mean field theory ( dmft ) , has proved to be very successful in this respect.@xcite the lda+dmft method supplements the lda by local correlations between @xmath4- or @xmath5-electrons.@xcite in the simplest case , namely , in the absence of long - range order and when the correlated bands at the fermi level are sufficiently separated from other bands,@xcite the dos of a correlated system is well represented by the integral ( hilbert transform ) @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the dos from the lda calculation , and @xmath8 is the local self - energy calculated self - consistently within the dmft scheme which includes correlation effects missing in the lda approach.@xcite non - local contributions to the self - energy can not yet be implemented in this scheme .",
    "this will become possible in extensions of the dmft , e.g. , in the dynamical cluster approximation ( dca ) and related computational schemes.@xcite    the aim of this paper is to describe another approach , phenomenological in nature , to model photoemission spectra of strongly correlated electrons .",
    "the motivation is the following : the lda+dmft method is microscopic but requires an extensive numerical effort to calculate @xmath7 and @xmath8 . on the other hand ,",
    "an analysis of various models of strongly correlated electrons within the dmft has shown that certain features of the self - energy do not depend on the details of the model .",
    "fermi liquid behaviour is seen in , e.g. , numerical renormalization group ( nrg ) calculations for the hubbard model both at and away from half - filling ( see fig .",
    "( [ fig2 ] ) below ) and for the periodic anderson model in the heavy - fermion regime.@xcite in these systems , the imaginary part of the self - energy consists of the @xmath9-dependence for @xmath10 and @xmath11 and two pronounced peaks at finite @xmath12 . on increasing the temperature ,",
    "fermi liquid behaviour can be rapidly destroyed , in particular close to the mott transition,@xcite or in general for systems with a very high effective mass .",
    "the imaginary part of the self - energy then goes over to a _",
    "single _ and very broad peak centered approximately at the fermi level ( see , e.g. , fig . 5 in ref.[22 ] ) .",
    "this model - independence of the self - energy suggests the use of a universal form for @xmath13 which depends only on a small number of phenomenological parameters .",
    "this @xmath13 replaces @xmath8 in eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) .",
    "although the proposed scheme is phenomenological ( the parameters in the self - energy being determined by fitting to the experimental data ) we believe it to be useful for the qualitative interpretation and understanding of the experimental results . the phenomenological self - energy @xmath13 obtained in this way can be used to deduce other quantities for the specific material , such as a linear specific heat coefficient and the dynamical conductivity ( under the assumption that vertex corrections are negligible ) .",
    "this approach would then serve as a unifying phenomenological description of a variety of experimental results .",
    "conceptually , such an approach is not new .",
    "it was used previously to fit and interpret , for example , the integrated photoemission data for ca@xmath0sr@xmath1vo@xmath2,@xcite and the angular resolved photoemission data in prototype fermi liquid metals@xcite and high - temperature superconductors.@xcite however , only the quasiparticle peak was fitted in these approaches . here",
    "we provide an analytical expression for the self - energy which is appropriate for fitting the whole spectrum of correlated @xmath4- or @xmath5-electrons , where the hubbard subbands and the quasiparticle resonance are present simultaneously .",
    "our approach is based on a sum of lorentz functions .",
    "matho has proposed another route based on the multi - pole expansion of the phenomenological self - energy.@xcite it turns out that these two approaches are mathematically equivalent . in our approach",
    "it is possible to present a simple physical motivation for the form of the self - energy .",
    "our phenomenological approach encounters certain difficulties which should be mentioned here .",
    "the most serious problem is connected with the description of multi - band systems .",
    "the strong electronic correlations originate from the localized nature of @xmath5- or @xmath4-orbitals .",
    "hence , several bands might cross the fermi level or be very close to it even when they are split by , e.g. , a crystal field . in v@xmath14o@xmath2 , for instance",
    ", the splitting between the @xmath15 and @xmath16 bands is rather small .",
    "in such a case , each band which lies in the vicinity of the fermi level would require a separate self - energy , which makes the number of fitting parameters twice or three times larger .",
    "since the photoemission results are not orbitally resolved , an unambiguous fitting can not be guaranteed in these cases . without additional experimental input , a phenomenological approach for these cases",
    "is not adequate .",
    "in our paper we therefore concentrate on the experimental data for la@xmath0sr@xmath1tio@xmath2 , a system with degenerate @xmath15 bands ( see sec .  4 ) .",
    "before that  in secs . 2 and 3 ",
    "the phenomenological expression for @xmath13 is introduced .",
    "the results of our paper are summarized in sec .",
    "we start with a heuristic derivation of the retarded self - energy for strongly correlated electrons ( e.g. , @xmath4-electrons ) in the metallic phase which form a fermi liquid state at low energies and temperatures .",
    "the dos @xmath17 , calculated with this self - energy should consist of three parts : two wide incoherent parts ( upper and lower hubbard bands ) and a coherent peak at or close to the fermi level @xmath18 .",
    "the construction of a suitable self - energy expression is guided by the following idea .",
    "let us start with a model for the spectral function @xmath19 which is a sum of three lorentz curves @xmath20 @xmath21 . \\label{2}\\ ] ] one peak ( the quasiparticle peak ) is centered at @xmath22 with spectral weight @xmath23 and width @xmath24 .",
    "the other two peaks ( upper and lower hubbard peaks ) are centered at @xmath25 and their widths are assumed to be both equal to @xmath26 ( see fig .",
    "( [ fig1 ] ) ) .",
    "the total weight of these two peaks is @xmath27 with the relative weights @xmath28 and @xmath29 respectively .",
    "@xmath19 is normalized to unity .",
    "apart from assuming the same width for both upper and lower hubbard peaks , eq .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) is the most general sum of three lorentz peaks .",
    "since we have not yet specified the position of the chemical potential @xmath18 , eq .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) describes both symmetric and asymmetric cases .    .",
    ", width=472 ]    there is , of course , some arbitrariness in the choice of eq .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) for @xmath19 .",
    "lorentzians are used here to obtain simple analytical expressions .",
    "one can try to use , for example , gauss or semi - elliptic forms of the dos as well .",
    "however , in these cases @xmath13 either can not be expressed analytically or is not a smooth function of @xmath12 .",
    "the retarded local green function @xmath30 corresponding to the spectral function ( [ 2 ] ) is @xmath31 .",
    "\\label{3}\\ ] ] we also introduce a green function @xmath32 which corresponds to a spectral function @xmath33 with a single peak centered at @xmath34 and with the width @xmath35 .",
    "note that all the above quantities ( i.e. those with an index ` mod ' ) do not correspond to any physical quantity but are introduced for the construction of a suitable self - energy only .    using the green functions ( [ 3 ] ) and ( [ g2 ] ) together with the dyson equation for the self - energy @xmath36 we find @xmath37^{-1}. \\label{5}\\ ] ] this self - energy contains 8 parameters .",
    "the number of parameters may be reduced by imposing additional conditions which are discussed below .    in order to preserve the fermi liquid properties at low energy we have to supplement the self - energy ( [ 5 ] ) by the condition @xmath38.@xcite then , as @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 . in the high energy limit @xmath42 , @xmath43 , but @xmath44 with a constant @xmath45 , which means that the imaginary part of the self - energy @xmath13 changes sign .",
    "we have checked that this artefact becomes important only if @xmath46 is much smaller than @xmath47 . however , in this weakly correlated limit @xmath48 usually reproduces the experimental data reliably and the corrections due to @xmath13 are not necessary . in the strongly correlated limit the change of the sign in @xmath49 appears at high energies .",
    "we have therefore introduce a cut - off setting @xmath50 whenever the self - energy becomes positive .",
    "the self - energy ( [ 5 ] ) is temperature independent .",
    "as noted in the introduction , the self - energy develops a peak _ at _ the chemical potential @xmath18 for finite temperature , in particular close to the mott transition .",
    "this effect is described phenomenologically by introducing a scattering part @xmath51 with two fitting parameters @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "the scattering part is not used in this paper but it might be important in systems far away from the fermi liquid regime .    hence , the phenomenological self - energy takes the form @xmath54    before applying eq .",
    "( [ 5c ] ) to model experimental data , we check whether this form of the self - energy can reproduce the self - energies obtained numerically from the dmft equations of the hubbard model @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the hopping matrix element between nearest neighbour sites and @xmath57 is the local interaction energy for the electrons with antiparallel spins @xmath58 .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows the result of the fit to the spectral function , calculated by nrg with the microscopic parameters @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "we imposed the fermi liquid condition @xmath62 .",
    "the scattering part @xmath63 was set to zero .",
    "the parameters determined from the fit - procedure are @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and @xmath70 .",
    "we used the same bare dos as in the nrg calculation , i.e. a semielliptic dos with the width @xmath71 .",
    "this width sets the energy units in this fitting .",
    "the comparison shows both the possibilities and limitations of our phenomenological approach .",
    "although the three - peak structure and the overall distribution of the spectral weight are described correctly , there are significant deviations regarding the form of the peaks .",
    "the main reason for this is that the peaks in the numerical data are not lorentzian ( see , e.g. , the discussion of the form of the kondo resonance in the single impurity anderson model in [ 28 ] ) .",
    "the fit - procedure therefore can not recover the dip at @xmath72 , and compensates this by underestimating the width of the upper hubbard peak . also , the band filling determined from the fitted spectral function is larger by about @xmath73 as compared to the nrg result .    )",

    "these are not , according to the nrg result , given by lorentz peaks . nevertheless ,",
    "the general structure , i.e. , the fermi - liquid behavior for small frequencies and the two peaks at higher frequencies ( @xmath74 ) is reproduced correctly .",
    "the relative difference in the weight of these latter peaks is due to the particle - hole asymmetry in the parameters used for this particular calculation .",
    "the phenomenological form for the self - energy eq.([5c ] ) discussed in the previous section can now be inserted in the hilbert transformation for the dos @xmath75 the direct ( @xmath76 ) and inverse ( @xmath77 ) photoemission intensities , within a constant transfer matrix approximation , are given by @xmath78 @xmath79   \\rho_{\\rm fit}(\\omega'),\\ ] ] where @xmath80 $ ] is the fermi - dirac function with the chemical potential @xmath18 at the temperature @xmath81 ( in energy units ) and @xmath82 is the apparatus function with the resolution @xmath58 .",

    "one can now determine the phenomenological parameters in the self - energy ( [ 5c ] ) and determine , for example , the effective mass , the magnitude of the hubbard interaction and the full frequency dependence of the self - energy .",
    "we now turn to the phenomenological modeling of experimental photoemission data , as exemplified in the case of la@xmath0sr@xmath1tio@xmath2 . in this compound , the @xmath85 electrons occupy degenerate @xmath15 orbitals for which the crystal and jahn - teller splittings are very small .",
    "moreover , the @xmath15 band is well separated from the @xmath16 and @xmath86-bands .",

    ", width=472 ]    here we have used the experimental data@xcite to determine the phenomenological parameters in the self - energy ( [ 5c ] ) . however , since we only know the occupied part of the spectrum it is impossible to determine unambiguously the absolute value of @xmath46 , corresponding to the distance between the lower ( occupied ) and the upper ( unoccupied ) hubbard bands . only a relative value @xmath101 can be determined . in order to make the problem tractable",
    "we have to reduce the number of parameters .    to this end",
    "we set @xmath102 since this is the value found in other theoretical studies.@xcite also we assume that the @xmath15 band is three - fold degenerate and that @xmath88 corresponds to @xmath103 filling . with decreasing @xmath96 the filling of this band",

    "the parameters are adjusted such as to obtain the correct filling @xmath104 of the @xmath4-band .",
    "we do not use the fermi liquid constraint because the experiment was performed at finite temperature and close to the mott transition , so that deviations from @xmath105 are expected to be significant .    within these assumptions",

    "( [ fig3 ] ) both self - energies ( [ 5c ] ) and ( [ 9 ] ) provide a similar description of the quasiparticle peak .",
    "however , the self - energy ( [ 5c ] ) also fits the high - energy feature of the spectrum . in fig .",
    "( [ fig4 ] ) we show the total spectral functions ( upper panel ) for four different values of @xmath96 obtained with this procedure .",
    "the lower panel presents the imaginary parts of the self - energy ( [ 5 ] ) .",
    "as we can see , with decreasing @xmath96 the number of states below the fermi level is reduced and more spectral weight is pushed into the upper hubbard peak . furthermore , the quasiparticle peak is suppressed for higher @xmath96 .",
    "these trends are also mirrored in the behavior of the self - energy for different @xmath96 .",
    "the absolute value of @xmath110 at the fermi level increases with @xmath96 .",
    "this increase might be attributed to the enhanced scattering due to the randomness introduced by the sr atoms in the system .",
    "we also calculated the @xmath111-factor ( @xmath112 ) which in fermi liquid theory is related to the effective mass of the quasiparticles ( @xmath113 ) . in the inset to fig .",
    "( [ fig4 ] ) we see a reduction of @xmath109 with increasing @xmath96 .    from these results ,",
    "obtained phenomenologically , we are able to conclude that la@xmath0sr@xmath1tio@xmath2 for @xmath114 is a correlated metal which can be modeled with a local self - energy . the _ origin _ of the narrow quasiparticle peak and the lower hubbard band can only be explained within a microscopic approach , e.g. , dmft .",
    "this is indeed possible , as has been shown recently using the lda+dmft approach.@xcite    the @xmath111-factor determined above is of the same order for both forms of the phenomenological self - energy [ ( [ 5c ] ) and ( [ 9 ] ) ] .",
    "nevertheless , we find that the particular value of @xmath111 depends on the precise form of @xmath13 .",
    "the dependence of @xmath111 on @xmath96 also turns out to be different for the two self - energies . using eq .",
    "( [ 5 ] ) its behavior is shown in the inset to fig .",
    "( [ fig4 ] ) . from eq .",
    "( [ 9 ] ) we obtained values between @xmath115 to @xmath116 for the corresponding @xmath96 .",
    "this is because the phenomenological self - energy is used to fit the spectrum in a finite frequency window around @xmath117 , which might be much larger then the actual frequency window for which fermi liquid theory is valid .",
    "one should therefore be cautious in the interpretation of the actual values obtained for the effective mass @xmath118 .",
    "we also note an intriguing feature of the experimental data for @xmath114.@xcite when the curves are normalized to unity and plotted in a single figure , they are almost identical .",
    "in particular , the distance between the coherent peak and the top of the hubbard band does not depend on @xmath96 .",
    "this is in striking contrast to numerical calculations for a doped hubbard model where doping inevitably leads to a shift of the chemical potential towards the lower hubbard band ( at least under the assumption of a homogeneous phase ) .",
    "such a discrepancy has recently also been observed for the related compound gd@xmath0sr@xmath1tio@xmath2 where it was attributed to an inhomogeneous sample composition due a chemical phase separation into strongly and poorly doped domains.@xcite such a phase separation may be restricted to the surface , as bulk - sensitive experiments did not observe it .",
    "a possible difference between surface and bulk electronic structure in oxidic perovskites has indeed been reported for doped vanadates.@xcite",
    "in this paper we presented a simple analytical expression ( [ 5 ] ) for the self - energy which can be used to fit experimental data for strongly correlated electron systems .",
    "as an application we presented fits to the photoemission data for la@xmath0sr@xmath1tio@xmath2 , for which the phenomenological fit parameters all take reasonable values .",
    "there are certain difficulties in carrying out such a program , mainly due to the limited spectroscopic information which is currently available for correlated electron systems .",
    "direct and inverse photoemission data would help to enhance the quality of the fits , in particular , if they allow one to fit different bands .",
    "angular resolved photoemission experiments would give further information , and could provide insights into the validity of assuming a purely local self - energy .    at the moment",
