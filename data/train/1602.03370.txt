    "the determination of linear statistics for eigenvalues of random matrices is an important question which has played a central role in the applications of random matrix theory to physical problems . for concreteness we will mostly base the discussion on matrices of the laguerre ensemble  : we consider @xmath13 matrices with positive eigenvalues , distributed according to the wishart distribution  @xcite @xmath14\\ ] ] where @xmath15 is the haar ( uniform ) measure and @xmath16 is the dyson index corresponding to orthogonal ( @xmath17 ) , unitary ( @xmath18 ) or symplectic ( @xmath19 ) symmetry classes .",
    "the condition @xmath20 ensures normalisability of the measure . if @xmath21 is an integer , the wishart distribution is the distribution of matrices of the form @xmath22 where @xmath23 has size @xmath24 and has independent and identical gaussian entries .",
    "this distribution ( [ eq : wishart ] ) appears in many contexts .",
    "examples are  : the study of random bipartite quantum states @xcite , the analysis of the wigner - smith matrix encoding characteristic scattering times in chaotic quantum dots  @xcite ( @xmath25 , i.e. @xmath26 ) and multichannel disordered semi - infinite wires  @xcite ( @xmath27 , i.e. @xmath28 ) .",
    "distributions such as ( [ eq : wishart ] ) describes a so - called `` invariant ensemble '' as the distribution is invariant under unitary transformations .",
    "this leads to the decoupling of eigenvalues and eigenvectors and the joint probability distribution function for the eigenvalues has the generic form @xmath29 , where @xmath30 $ ] for the laguerre ensemble .",
    "many interesting physical quantities take the form of spectral linear statistics @xmath31 for a given function @xmath8 ( see examples below ) .",
    "the analysis of the distribution of such quantity remains in general a difficult task which has stimulated considerable efforts .",
    "several techniques have been developed  : orthogonal polynomials , selberg s integrals and coulomb gas method .",
    "although all these techniques provide the _ typical _ fluctuations of @xmath5 , the coulomb gas technique seems the most efficient method to determine the large deviations ( _ atypical _ fluctuations ) . interpreting the distribution @xmath32 as the gibbs measure for a one - dimensional gas of charges interacting with logarithmic interactions ,  @xcite in the limit @xmath33 ,",
    "the analysis of the distribution of the linear statistics is mapped onto the determination of the optimal configuration of charges which minimizes the energy under the constraint that @xmath34 is fixed .",
    "because the energy of the gas scales as @xmath35 , one can in general write the large deviation ansatz @xmath36 for @xmath33 , where the scaling exponent @xmath7 depends on the matrix ensemble and the function @xmath8 ( e.g.  : for the laguerre ensemble and @xmath37 one has @xmath38 ) .",
    "when the moments of @xmath5 exist , the large deviation function has a regular expansion   is non analytic near its minimum @xcite . ] near its minimum @xmath39 where @xmath40 .",
    "interestingly , the transition from the ( universal ) regular behaviour for @xmath41 to ( non universal ) behaviours for @xmath42 can be associated in some cases to phase transitions in the coulomb gas  @xcite ( an example is discussed in  [ sec : jacobi ] ) .",
    "the purpose of the present article is two - fold  : first , provide a formula including the pre - exponential @xmath43-dependent function in front of the large deviation ansatz , @xmath44 what will be presented in section  [ sec : coulombgas ] .",
    "our conjecture will be verified on several well controlled cases . a rigorous approach to @xmath45 expansion in random matrix theory",
    "is provided by loop expansions @xcite and has been developed by eynard recently for the characteristic function , i.e. the laplace transform of @xmath46 ( see @xcite and chapter 13 of @xcite for a simpler presentation within the gaussian invariant ensembles )  ; our motiviation is here to provide a formula directly for the distribution in terms of simple properties of the coulomb gas .",
    "the second new result of the paper ( presented in section  [ sec : laguerre ] ) is obtained by applying our general formula in an unusual situation where the large deviation function is monotonous due to the divergence of all moments @xmath47 .",
    "this occurs when studying the distribution of the wigner time delay ( i.e. the density of states ) for semi - infinite multichannel disordered wires , a problem with connections with the laguerre ensemble of random matrices .",
    "it is then crucial to determine the pre - exponential function @xmath12 , which explains alone the decay of the distribution .",
