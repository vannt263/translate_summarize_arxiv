    "in the last years observations in the uv - rest frame have shown that many massive galaxies in the redshift range @xmath7 ( the most active period of galaxy formation ) are large discs with irregular morphologies known as clumps @xcite .",
    "the clumpy galaxies were called  clump - cluster \" galaxies and  chain \" galaxies , when viewed face on and edge on , respectively @xcite . even if they could be associated to mergers or galaxy interactions ,",
    "only a minority is in the process of merging ( @xmath8 ) and , moreover , their morphology and kinematics indicate that they are rotationally supported , extended discs @xcite",
    ". + high redshift galactic discs are very different from their counterpart in the local universe .",
    "most of the discs at @xmath9 are highly turbulent , with high velocity dispersion of @xmath10 km / s and rotation to dispersion ratio of @xmath11 @xcite against the value @xmath12 in local galaxies .",
    "this suggests they should be thick turbulent discs , but still rotation dominated .",
    "another important property of these discs is that they are also gas rich .",
    "estimates of the molecular gas fraction , based on co measurements , give us @xmath13 @xcite , more than a factor of 2 higher than in local massive spiral galaxies .",
    "finally they are strongly star - forming discs , with star formation rate @xmath14 , that follows the well established redshift evolution of the main - sequence ( e.g. @xcite ) , but is more than one order of magnitude higher than today s sfr .",
    "clumps are identified in high resolution hst images and in nebular line emission from integral field spectroscopy on scales of about @xmath15 kpc .",
    "they are characterised by high density ( around 8 times denser than discs ) and high star formation rate , @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "modern telescopes with adaptive optics can achieve resolution of @xmath17 kpc at @xmath2 , limiting the number of spatially resolved elements , since not only the galaxies at high redshift are intrinsically smaller , but their cosmological surface brightness decreases @xmath18 , enabling us to observe only the bright central regions .",
    "new observations @xcite , instead , have used gravitational lensing by massive foreground clusters to enhance spatial resolution . moreover ,",
    "unlensed surveys have focused on the more extreme star - forming population ( due to detection limits ) , gravitational lensing has allowed to focus on more ` normal ' galaxies with lower intrinsic luminosity ( since lensing conserves surface brightness ) .",
    "star - forming clumps have been observed also in these galaxies but at much higher resolution ( @xmath19 pc ) , allowing direct comparisons with the hii regions in the local universe @xcite . while overall the range of sizes and masses of clumps found by these last works are wide , @xmath20 kpc and @xmath21 - @xmath22 @xmath23 , the typical mass found in the lensing sample , which benefits from high resolution , is only @xmath24 , much smaller than the mass of giant clumps identified in previous lower resolution observations , which were in the range @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "it is conceivable that the lower characteristic masses found in these recent observations might be more representative of the clump phenomenon in hi - z galaxies , calling for theoretical models and simulations to explain that .",
    "+ the dominant interpretation so far to explain the origin of clumps is that they are produced by gravitational instability , in particular by the fragmentation of spiral arms in a massive gas - rich disc . according to the standard toomre instability analysis @xcite , a rotating disc becomes unstable to local gravitational collapse if its surface density is higher than the forces induced by differential rotation and velocity dispersion .",
    "this is expressed in terms of the toomre parameter that , in case of fluid discs , is @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the sound speed , @xmath28 is the epicyclic frequency , @xmath29 is the gravitational constant and @xmath30 is the surface density of the disc at radius @xmath31 . in case of kinematic discs ( stellar discs ) the toomre parameter becomes @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the radial velocity dispersion .",
    "in both cases if @xmath34 , the disc is locally stable . as we will explain better in section [ clumps ] , the toomre wavelength @xmath35 should determine the maximum clump fragmentation scale , with characteristic fragmentation scale given by the most unstable wavelength , situated at one half of the toomre wavelength : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is a constant equal to 0.5 or 0.55 for zero - thickness fluid or stellar discs respectively @xcite .",
    "this most unstable wavelength should then be comparable to the sizes of clumps that arise , but a first cautionary remark is that in a disc with both gas and stars one should use the two - fluid definition of the toomre parameter ( see @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) given by : @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are defined in equations ( [ eq : q_gas ] ) and ( [ eq : q_star ] ) , respectively , @xmath41 is the ratio of the velocity dispersion of the stellar component to that of the gas , and @xmath42 is the dimensionless wave number .",
    "the system is unstable once @xmath43 and the most unstable wavelength corresponds to the @xmath42 that minimizes @xmath44 ( between @xmath45 for @xmath46 and @xmath47 for @xmath48 ) .",
    "another caveat is that , for a gaseous disc , one could use either the thermal sound speed or the radial gas velocity dispersion , and often the practice in the galactic disc modelling community has been to choose the maximum of the two ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we will adopt the same method throughout our analysis . + more in general , when approaching the study of disc instability one should take into account that the toomre analysis is born out of linear perturbation theory and assumes an initially thin , axisymmetric disc , which undergoes an isothermal axisymmetric perturbation , while in reality we are normally interested in global , non - axisymmetric instabilities in a finite - thickness 3d disc , which is not strictly isothermal . furthermore , gravitationally bound massive clumps , if formed by gravitational instability , can not be fully understood assuming linear perturbation theory , because they are by definition in the strongly nonlinear regime . for this reason we have used a different approach in section [ clumps ] in order to understand clump masses , using a model already employed to explain the properties of sub - stellar companions fragmenting out of protoplanetary discs .",
    "+ finally , the typical age of the stellar population in clumps ranges from tens myr to one gyr @xcite . since older clumps ( @xmath49 myr )",
    "are found closer to the center and a fraction of these high - z clumpy discs shows a central stellar bulge @xcite , it was proposed a clump - origin bulge scenario @xcite : if clumps survive enough ( this should happen only for those more massive and denser ) , they fall into the galactic centre , due to dynamical friction ( losing angular momentum ) , and could have an important role in building up the bulge .",
    "+ previous works @xcite have based their results on cosmological simulations which zoom - in on selected massive galaxies with stellar masses comparable to the bright galaxies typically observed in high - z surveys . in this paper , instead , we present the results from different isolated galaxy simulations with setup based on structure of galaxies in high resolution cosmological simulation ( argo , see @xcite ) .",
    "we consider a much wider range of galaxy masses , probing into the lower mass but more common galaxy population now accessible with lensing surveys such as those of @xcite , while at the same time including galaxies as massive as those studied in previous simulations .",
    "+ while less realistic to some extent , isolated disc simulations allow to reach high resolution and to explore systematically and in a controlled way the dependence of fragmentation on structural parameters , including galaxy mass , as well as on sub - grid physics , which is not possible in cosmological simulations .",
    "a systematic approach is essential if we want to understand the origin of clump masses for example .",
    "+ in section [ sim ] we describe our code and the simulation setup . in section [ results ]",
    "we present our results , divided by their dependence on used sub - grid physics , structural parameters and resolution . in section [ clumps ]",
    "we analyse the clump size and mass in our simulations , using an estimate of fragmentation mass scale alternative to the toomre mass , showing why fragmentation can not lead to giant clumps and demonstrating that , even after a relatively long phase of mass growth , the typical mass of clumps remains below @xmath50 . in section [ bulge ]",
    "we study the possibility that the bulge is not built up by clumps ( even if it can grow a bit ) , but it is produced by gas inflow due to spiral arms torques before clumpy phase .",
    "finally in section [ discussion ] we summarize and discuss our results .",
    "we perform a large set of simulations of isolated galaxies using gasoline2 , a new version of the n - body + smoothed particle hydrodynamic ( sph ) code gasoline @xcite .",
    "the initial conditions adopted for the galaxy models are described in subsection [ subsec : ic ] .",
    "gasoline computes gravitational forces between particles using a binary tree , and smoothing them with a spline kernel function ( we use an opening angle parameter @xmath51 ) .",
    "the code solves the equations of hydrodynamics and includes radiative cooling for a mixture of hydrogen , helium and metals as well as compton cooling . while for hydrogen and helium we compute directly the rates without assuming ionization equilibrium , metal - line cooling rates are calculated assuming collisional ionization equilibrium .",
    "we simply used the tabulated values calculated with the photoionization code cloudy @xcite , as in @xcite .",
    "we use well tested sub - grid prescriptions for star formation , supernova feedback , metal yields from supernovae and stellar mass return to the gas phase via stellar winds .",
    "the adopted recipes are described in detail in @xcite and are summarised here . in our feedback model ,",
    "known as the blastwave model , we disable cooling within the radius of the blastwave produced by supernovae type ii for a time corresponding to the end of the snowplough phase ( @xmath52 myr ) .",
    "we release an energy of @xmath53 erg per supernovae explosion into the gas encompassed by the blastwave .",
    "the cooling is not disabled for type ia supernovae , the frequency of which is estimated from the binary fraction of @xcite .",
    "a gas particle must satisfy three criteria in order to have star formation",
    ". it must be :    1 .",
    "denser than a fixed threshold density @xmath54 2 .",
    "lower than a fixed temperature threshold @xmath55 3 .",
    "part of a converging flow    which individual gas particles form stars is determined using a probabilistic approach , assuming a kroupa imf @xcite , after imposing that the local star formation rate ( sfr ) follows a schmidt law @xcite , using a star formation efficiency @xmath56 . in our case",
    "we use @xmath57 and a density threshold of @xmath58 @xmath59 .",
    "we stress that the adopted sub - grid models for star formation and feedback are motivated by our previous work on galaxy formation .",
    "indeed we have shown extensively that a high star formation density threshold , such as that used here , in combination with the blastwave feedback , can produce realistic replicas of massive spiral galaxies such as those in the eris simulations @xcite , explain the main properties of dwarf galaxies , including turning cores into cusps @xcite , and , more recently , produce a variety or realistic hubble types , including massive central galaxies inside galaxy groups ( in the argo simulations , see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "indeed with a high star formation density threshold , close to that at which gas turns into stars in giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) , supernovae - driven winds can be naturally generated , regulating both the baryonic content and the star formation rate of galaxies @xcite . the ability to reproduce realistic galaxies across a range of mass scales implies that our sub - grid recipes , despite they should be regarded as purely phenomenological , reasonably capture the energetics of galaxy formation .",
    "this is important for the investigation on which this paper focuses , since the stability of gaseous discs is ultimately determined by the energetics at play in the gas phase .",
    "we note that previous work on the stability of high redshift discs did not employ recipes that had previously undergone such an extensive validation in the broader context of galaxy formation .",
    "furthermore , compared to the eris and argo simulations , which were run releasing @xmath60 erg per supernova and used @xmath61 and @xmath62 respectively , we opted for a more conservative choice of the star formation and feedback efficiency , which should favour gravitational instability in the cold gas phase .",
    "gasoline2 allows to solve the hydrodynamical equations using sph formulations , resolving mixing and two - fluid instabilities .",
    "such formulations are adopted in some of the runs of this paper .",
    "they include thermal and metal diffusion terms in the momentum and energy equations based on the sub - grid turbulence prescription described by @xcite and the new implementation of the hydrodynamical force equation described by @xcite .",
    "the new approach is based on the geometric density average ( gdsph ) in the sph force expression @xmath63 in place of the usual @xmath64 , where @xmath65 and @xmath66 are particle pressures and densities respectively .",
    "this modification leads to smoother gradients and removes artificial surface tension @xcite .",
    "detailed tests of the gdsph implementation combined with diffusion as in run3 ( see section [ subsec : ic ] , table [ table_runs ] ) will be presented in wadsley et al .",
    "( in preparation ) , showing that it can successfully capture kelvin - helmoltz and rayleigh - taylor instabilities .",
    "note that other new sph implementations , while they often track entropy rather than energy as we do , also use a geometric density mean for the forces ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "+ finally , in order to guarantee that any fragmentation remains physical , we ensure that the gas particle s implied jeans scale is resolved at a given temperature and density by imposing in all our simulations a pressure floor constraint , following @xcite .",
    "the minimum pressure is set to @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is a safety factor , @xmath29 is the gravitational constant , @xmath69 is the smoothing length and @xmath70 is the particle density ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "+ we started from low resolution simulations using @xmath71 dark matter particles ( @xmath72 ) , @xmath73 gas particles ( @xmath74 ) and @xmath73 star particles ( @xmath75 ) , but in some cases we also increase the resolution ( here after hres ) using @xmath76 , @xmath77 .",
    "the mass resolution is different for each case , see table [ table_resolution ] , depending on the initial conditions . for all particle species , the gravitational softening length , @xmath78 , is @xmath79 pc .",
    "only one simulation has @xmath80 pc as time steps become prohibitively small with decreasing softening , see table [ table_runs ] for more details .",
    "finally the hydro resolution , given by the sph smoothing length , @xmath69 , is different for each case : in the table [ table_resolution ] we indicate the most likely value of sph resolution in an annulus centered on the galaxy centre , between 1 and 4 kpc ( since clumps in our simulations form in that region ) , but note that in a sph simulation the hydro resolution is higher in high density regions , so at the sites of clump formation it reaches values @xmath81 pc .",
    "+ note that this is comparable with that of high resolution amr simulations ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]             the models are built using the hernquist technique ( @xcite ) , which allows to construct multi - component galaxy models close to equilibrium . + more specifically , we analyse our cosmological galaxy sample in order to determine the most likely value of the exponential disc scale length , peak rotational velocity and gas fraction ( see figure [ fig : ic ] for this last value ) .",
    "our models have exponential baryonic surface density profiles ( as described in @xcite ) in which the gas and stars have the same scale length @xmath82 : @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the central surface density .",
    "we fit the stellar surface density profiles of the galaxies in argo simulation with an exponential fit , finding the scale length @xmath82 .",
    "note that most galaxies in argo , and certainly all the most massive ones , do not have a simple exponential profile ( see figure [ fig : surface_cosmo ] ) since bulge growth due to a variety of processes has already begun ( @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless , we do not include a bulge component in the models , since this will tend to stabilise them .",
    "in addition , as we will discuss below , the surface density profile will become steeper , essentially producing naturally a small bulge , simply as a result of relaxation ( see figure [ fig : surface_density_ic ] and section [ bulge ] ) . + we measure the gas fraction inside a radius equal to @xmath85 .",
    "the gas fraction ( here after @xmath86 ) is defined as : @xmath87 we consider only cold gas , with a temperature below @xmath88 k. we find that @xmath86 in our sample of selected galaxies is in the range @xmath89 , see figure [ fig : ic ] .",
    "we thus build the initial set of models using an intermediate value , @xmath90 , but since observations of clumpy galaxies have found even higher gas fractions to be common , and since cosmological simulations may suffer from excessive star formation efficiency , we also constructed models with @xmath91 @xcite .     and @xmath92 for all the galaxies selected in the argo simulation , showing as typical values 0.2 - 0.4 . ]",
    "we caution that the gas fractions measured in the observations are determined using molecular gas rather than total mass of cold gas , while only the latter is accessible in the simulations .",
    "we will return on this point when we report our results in section [ sec : structural_param ] .",
    "+ for our model set up we also need to define the velocity at the virial radius , @xmath93 , which , for an assumed cosmology ( ours assumes @xmath94 , @xmath95 and @xmath96 km / s / mpc as wmap9 ) , automatically determines the virial mass , @xmath97 , and the virial radius , @xmath98 , of the halo .",
    "we chose to use as halo virial velocity a value in the range between @xmath79 and @xmath99 km / s , which corresponds to the asymptotic total velocity of the most massive galaxies in the argo simulation , see figure 4 in @xcite . + for the halo we choose nfw density profiles @xcite with different halo concentrations , @xmath100 , and spin parameter , @xmath101 .",
    "the concentration is defined as @xmath102 , where @xmath103 is the halo scale radius .",
    "basically the value of the concentration @xmath100 defines what fraction of the total mass of the halo is contained within its inner regions , where the baryonic disc lies . for our model we chose three values for the halo concentration , @xmath104 and @xmath105 . for galaxies in the virial mass range @xmath106 considered here ,",
    "this range of concentrations is indeed plausible ( @xcite ) , but it is important to stress that for the most massive galaxies in our sample , which are closer in mass to those considered in previous simulation works , the choice @xmath107 is most representative and should be considered as the reference case . note that we do not measure the halo concentration in the cosmological galaxies , because baryons inevitably affect the halo potential , especially for the most massive galaxies @xcite , making it unfeasible to determine the original concentration . +",
    "finally the spin parameter is defined as @xmath108 , where @xmath109 and @xmath110 are , respectively , the total angular momentum and the total energy of the halo .",
    "also in this case , rather than measuring directly the spin parameter , we set it to a value that allows us to recover a range of disc scale lengths similar to that of the original cosmological galaxies at @xmath111 ( we use @xmath101 in the range 0.02 - 0.04 ) .",
    "the disc scale lengths of the models are shown in table [ table_resolution ] .",
    "+   + following the procedure outlined above , we construct 11 disc models , varying virial velocity , concentration , gas fraction and resolution ( see table [ table_resolution ] ) .",
    "the spin parameter is adjusted in each model in order to obtain a sensible disc scale length , because the disc scale length depends directly or indirectly on the other structural parameters , see @xcite .",
    "three models have a mass resolution @xmath112 times higher , but the same gravitational softening as in the other models ( @xmath79 pc ) .",
    "one of the high resolution models has been run with a softening reduced by a factor of 2 to explore the effect of increased spatial resolution ( run 26 in table [ table_runs ] ) .",
    "indeed , a vast literature on gravitational instability on protostellar and protoplanetary discs has shown that both mass and spatial resolution do affect the outcome of disc instability ( @xcite ) , and similar studies on gaseous bars and spiral instabilities have shown that a smaller gravitational softening allows to better capture the dynamics of non - axisymmetric modes , leading to stronger bars or spiral modes ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "+ the disc models are evolved adiabatically for @xmath15 gyr , in order to allow the disc to relax and eliminate transient waves in the stellar and gaseous disc , which could artificially enhanced non - axisymmetric instabilities .",
    "indeed we want to approach the instability from a stable state , in order to perform a systematic and controlled study of disc instability .",
    "note that this is still a caution to be taken , even if we are using a pressure floor ( see section [ code ] ) ; in fact the pressure floor enforces that density fluctuations , which lead to fragmentation , are well resolved , but does not ensure that numerical noise and transient perturbations in the initial conditions do not amplify those fluctuations to begin with ( see @xcite ) .",
    "after 1 gyr the models are fairly stable , with toomre parameters well above unity everywhere ( figures [ fig : toomre_low_high ] and [ fig : toomre_other_runs ] , blue line ) as in the argo galaxies ( these however have even larger toomre parameters , see figure [ fig : q_toomre_argo ] ) .",
    "note that transient perturbations have sustained a spiral pattern soon after the start of the simulation in the adiabatic phase , leading to some angular momentum transport in the disc and producing a small bulge - like central concentration .",
    "this shows up as a central steepening of the rotation curve inside 1 kpc .",
    "this is acceptable , since galaxies in the argo simulation also develop a moderate bulge component already at @xmath113 , as highlighted by the shape of the rotation curves in figure 4 of @xcite and by the stellar surface density maps in figures 2 and 3 of @xcite .",
    "+ after the adiabatic relaxation phase , we turn on radiative cooling and run the models for 2 gyr more , with varying sub - grid physics , namely switching on and off blast - wave supernovae feedback , metal - line cooling , thermal and metal diffusion , and using even the gdsph in selected cases ( see table [ table_runs ] for more details ) .",
    "each run lasts 3 gyr , but since the first gyr covers only the initial relaxation phase , for our purpose we reset the clock to @xmath114 at the end of the relaxation phase , hence in the plots and tables time will label only the disc evolution phase following the initial relaxation .",
    "note that , while the isolated disc simulations are not cosmological , assuming they are initialised to resemble galaxies at @xmath111 , the 1 gyr time spanned by the simulations can be interpreted as evolving them to @xmath115 , which corresponds quite well to the typical redshift range of clumpy galaxies .",
    "+ in figures [ fig : velocities_ic ] and [ fig : surface_density_ic ] there are , respectively , the rotation curves and surface densities of all our simulated galaxies at the initial condition and after the relaxation time , 1 gyr",
    ". +         +      +      +             +      +      +",
    "as said before , isolated galaxy simulations allow us to reach higher resolution , compared to cosmological simulations , and to explore systematically the effect of varying sub - grid physics and structural parameters .",
    "+ table [ table_runs ] summarizes the outcome of our large suite of simulations .",
    "inspection of table [ table_runs ] highlights that the formation of long - lasting gravitationally bound gaseous clumps , due to gravitational instability , is a common occurrence for massive galaxies ( with virial velocities @xmath116 km / s ) , especially with low concentration and high gas fraction .",
    "this is consistent with previous simulations of clumpy galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however , when we consider the complete sample of simulations , which includes lower mass galaxies , only half of the simulations show fragmentation into clumps , and of these only ten exhibit clumps until 1 gyr of evolution ( note , however , that the short lifetimes of clumps are in principle consistent with the young ages typically inferred for clumps in observed hi - z galaxies @xcite ) .",
    "long lived fragmentation lasting 1 gyr occurs either in unrealistic setups , such as when feedback is not included in the simulation ( runs 17 and 28 ) , or in galaxy models with most vigorous instability because of largest disc mass , highest gas fractions and/or lowest halo concentration ( ml6 and ml11 ) .",
    "note that model ml11 , which has @xmath117 km / s and a disc mass @xmath118 @xmath23 , has a maximum circular velocity of @xmath119 , see figure [ fig : velocities_ic ] , which is close to the tail of highest rotational velocities in the large high - z kmos sample of @xcite ( see figure 7 in the quoted paper for comparison : our peak rotational velocity for the gas in ml11 is @xmath120 km / s , while at redshift @xmath121 the typical value is @xmath122 km / s ) .",
    "+ finally , as we show in section [ clumps ] the typical mass and size of clumps in our sample is sensibly smaller than the masses often reported in the literature of numerical simulations , reflecting both the wide range of galaxy masses and structural properties considered and the different treatment of sub - grid physics .",
    "+ we proceed now to have a closer look at the nature of fragmentation and the properties of clumps in our simulations .",
    "we recall that @xmath114 corresponds to the end of the 1 gyr - long relaxation phase in our simulations , so that we study only the evolution past this point .",
    "fragmentation , when it happens , occurs along dense spiral arms , forming at a distance from the galactic centre usually comprised between @xmath123 and @xmath124 kpc , after roughly one orbital time ( i.e. @xmath125 myr ) , since this is the region that reaches the lowest toomre parameters ( see figure e.g. [ fig : toomre_low_high ] ) .",
    "the exact value of the toomre parameter near fragmentation depends on the way the toomre parameter is defined and measured , which is not trivial in our case , since we are dealing with global instability in a thick , non - laminar , non - isothermal disc , hence with all the assumptions of linear toomre analysis breaking down .",
    "we have measured the toomre parameter in different ways , using both the two - fluid and one - fluid definition ( see section [ intro ] ) , finding that the azimuthally averaged value of the parameter for the cold gas phase only ( single fluid approximation ) yields a result well in line with the consensus reached in the vast literature on protostellar and protoplanetary gaseous discs , using a variety of numerical hydrodynamical techniques , namely that fragmentation in 3d gaseous discs requires a minimum toomre parameter @xmath126 ( e.g. @xcite ) . despite this , for completeness we have preferred to use the two - fluid toomre parameter ( see equation [ eq : q_total ] ) , hence including both gas and stars in our analysis .",
    "the fragmentation will then occur if the local cooling time is not much longer than the local orbital time , a condition that is always satisfied in galactic discs ( but not necessarily in astrophysical discs at smaller scales , see @xcite ) . + in our simulations , the fragmentation phase lasts from few orbital times up to 1 gyr .",
    "clumps , which we identify as gravitationally bound gaseous objects ( see section [ clumps ] ) form with a diameter between @xmath99 and @xmath127 pc and gas masses typically comprised between @xmath128 and @xmath129 ( figure [ fig : hist_clumps_evolution ] ) , undergoing rapid star formation in the first 100 - 200 myr ( figure [ fig : sfr_fb_vs_mc ] ) .",
    "they can then reach higher total masses ( including stars and gas ) , up to @xmath130 as they accrete mass and merge with other clumps . the initial masses and evolution of the mass function",
    "is thoroughly addressed in section [ clumps ] .",
    "their orbits decay towards the galactic nucleus due to dynamical friction ( @xcite ) , but , as we will show , their contribution to growing the mass of the bulge is very modest in our simulations ( see section [ bulge ] ) , a reflection of their moderate masses relative to previous works , claiming bulge formation via clumps ( @xcite ) .",
    "+ we caution from the beginning that our simulations can only capture gravitationally bound clouds above our resolution limit . assuming conservatively that 1 - 2 sph kernels yield the minimum cloud mass that can be reliably captured by the simulations ( see e.g. @xcite ) , based on the mass of our gas particles ( see table [ table_resolution ] ) such mass is of order @xmath131 @xmath23 in most of our simulations , since in gasoline2 the sph kernel contains 32 particles ( in the high resolution simulations",
    "the same limiting mass would be of order @xmath73 @xmath23 ) .",
    "this means we can hardly resolve fragmentation on the typical mass scale of molecular clouds , but this is not an issue for our aim of resolving giant clumps with masses well exceeding @xmath131 @xmath23 .",
    "furthermore , the final masses of clumps could be overestimated , irrespective of the initial fragmentation scales , since we lack feedback from massive stars ( radiative heating , radiation pressure , protostellar outflows and jets ) interior to the clumps that may cause outflows and dissipate them on shorter timescales ( @xcite ) .",
    "we will extensively discuss the origin of clump masses and sizes in section [ clumps ] .",
    "+ the effects of sub - grid physics on the fragmentation scale and clump evolution are often non - trivial , as we detail below .",
    "before we move on with a detailed account of how fragmentation is affected by sub - grid physics and galaxy structural parameters , it is important to verify that the global properties of galactic discs , during the fragmentation phase , are consistent with observational constraints on high redshift clumpy galaxies .",
    "an important diagnostic is disc kinematics . as we said in the introduction , observations show that clumpy galaxies have a ratio @xmath132 , therefore showing a strong evidence for the fact that clumpy discs are rotationally supported @xcite . in figure",
    "[ fig : ratio_v_s ] we show the evolution of the ratio @xmath133 , calculating the values at half mass radius , using the @xmath134 , as in the observations .",
    "the figure shows that the ratio remains in the range @xmath135 , as expected from the fact that discs is relatively undisturbed during clump formation , because clumps comprise a very small fraction of the disc mass .",
    "this is true even for runs in which fragmentation is more vigorous , such as run 17 , that has no feedback , or run 25 , that has a high disc mass and a high gas fraction .",
    "this is an important self - consistency check that was not always carried out in past works .",
    "indeed , the more prominent fragmentation is , the lower @xmath133 should be ( as shown in figure [ fig : ratio_v_s ] ) , because the galaxy disc becomes increasingly gravitoturbulent , making it more difficult to explain why observed high redshift discs are clearly rotationally supported .",
    "+     for some representative runs .",
    "we start from @xmath136 , that corresponds to the end of the relaxation phase , when we switch on radiative cooling and other sub - grid physics , according to table [ table_runs ] , then we show the state at 0.2 and 0.7 gyr , corresponding to the phase of clump formation , and finally at 1.2 and 2.0 gyr , which signal the end of the clumpy phase , except for runs 12 , 17 , 25 , 27 that continue fragmenting .",
    "run 9 does not fragment and shows a ratio higher than the other cases , as expected.,scaledwidth=49.0% ]     + in the following we report on the effect of varying sub - physics and the structural parameters on clump formation and evolution .",
    "feedback has a key role for allowing / suppressing fragmentation .",
    "to better understand this point , we focus on two runs , 16 and 17 , which differ only by the presence of the feedback . in both the simulations the clumps",
    "form after @xmath137 gyr and they are well visible at @xmath138 gyr .",
    "when the blast - wave feedback is included ( see top panels of figure [ fig : gas_density_nofb_fb ] for the gas density map evolution at some time steps ) , like in run 16 , clumps form , but they are much fewer than in run 17 ( bottom panels ) and are dissolved quickly , in about @xmath139 myr .",
    "the extreme case of run 17 shows that , when the galaxy evolves without any mechanism to heat and stir the gas , which would act to stabilised the disc against fragmentation , clumps formation is favoured .",
    "the galaxy appears already fragmented soon after @xmath138 gyr , even if the clumps are smaller ( @xmath140 pc in diameter ) than the ones shown in previous papers using simulations with either no feedback or thermal feedback without any delayed cooling , which is known to result in much weaker feedback compared to our blastwave feedback prescription ( e.g. in @xcite clump sizes are @xmath141 kpc ) .",
    "+                 the comparison between the two runs in figure [ fig : gas_density_nofb_fb ] shows clearly that feedback not only reduces the amount of fragmentation that happens in the disc but also stops the fragmentation earlier .",
    "indeed in run 16 there are no more clumps after @xmath142 gyr , while in run 17 there are still some .",
    "note that in run 16 the number of clumps that are forming at time @xmath137 gyr ( not showed since they are still not well detectable ) is the same that we observe at time @xmath138 gyr , meaning that they are not disrupted in @xmath143 gyr nor they migrate faster to the centre , but there is simply less clump formation relative to run 17 . comparing the mass histograms for these runs at different times makes the point even clearer ( see figure [ fig : comparison_fb_nofb ] ) .                 for completeness",
    "we investigate the effect of feedback looking also at runs 27 - 28 that have a configuration more similar to the clumpy galaxies at high redshift .",
    "the same analysis confirmed us that clumps are fewer at all times with feedback . in this last case , however , fragmentation continues for longer due to higher disc mass also in the feedback case ( i.e. run 27 ) .",
    "this is at variance with previous theory @xcite and other simulations @xcite , in which clumps do form nearly as efficiently when the feedback is strong but they disrupt later .",
    "this is likely because the main effect of our feedback model is to help stabilize the disc on a global scale rather than to affect individual clumps .",
    "we also note that feedback has almost no effect on the high mass clumps , in the sense that the largest masses reached by clumps with and without feedback are essentially the same , which agrees with previous works ( @xcite ) .",
    "indeed in both runs 16 and 17 clumps can reach up to @xmath144 @xmath23 ( look at figure [ fig : comparison_fb_nofb ] , especially the middle panels ) .",
    "the reason is that the high mass tail of clumps ( right panels in figure [ fig : comparison_fb_nofb ] ) does not arise from fragmentation , so it does not depend on the presence / absence of feedback affecting fragmentation directly , rather they originate from clump - clump mergers that happen after @xmath145 myr .",
    "this was verified by tracking back in time the particles of individual clumps . once they are formed , these clumps are massive enough to avoid being affected by ( our ) feedback .",
    "we remark that small - scale feedback from massive stars inside clumps themselves , or radiation pressure , could have an important additional effect and will have to be explored in the future .",
    "internal feedback could possibly affect the maximum clump mass that can be achieved .",
    "finally , while all feedback models considered in the literature , including ours , are purely phenomenological and very approximate , we note that with ours the massive galaxies in our sample are consistent with abundance matching ( figure [ fig : abundance_matching ] ) , which again reflects the large - scale self - regulation operated by feedback .",
    "we have explored the effect of varying the radiative cooling prescription on fragmentation . in particular , while all runs account for cooling of atomic hydrogen and helium , only in a subset of the runs we include cooling by metal lines .",
    "galaxies reach metallicities up to @xmath138 z@xmath146 by the end of the simulations as a result of star formation and subsequent metal yields from supernovae .",
    "note that this is at the low end of the metallicities found in galaxies at @xmath147 , which are in the range @xmath148 z@xmath146 , hence any difference we find between runs with and without metal cooling should be regarded as conservative .",
    "when metal - line cooling is included , not only the cooling at @xmath149 k is enhanced in gas with non - zero metallicity , but , most importantly , gas can also cool to much lower temperature ( @xmath150 k ) . comparing run 16 and run 18 , which are otherwise identical , shows that adding metal - line cooling ( run 18 ) suppresses fragmentation at the scales that we resolve here ( see figure [ fig : gas_density_mclow ] ) .",
    "+            one could think that the reason for this lower fragmentation would be due to the more efficient cooling , which could induce faster sfr ( so faster gas consumption ) , which also leads to stronger feedback , and thus to more efficient gas removal from clumps . to be sure that this is not the case , we check the sfr for both run 16 and run 18 and we found that a more efficient cooling by metals does not induce significantly higher or more rapidly rising star formation , see figure [ fig : sfr_fb_vs_mc ] , especially at early times ( i.e. @xmath151 myr ) , when clumps begin to form .",
    "myr ) . ]",
    "the reason is probably that the toomre wavelength , which , as we explain below , expresses an upper limit on the fragmentation length scale ( see section [ clumps ] ) becomes of order of one hundred parsecs , which is comparable to the resolution limit set by the gravitational softening .",
    "indeed the toomre wavelength is proportional to @xmath152 , hence to the temperature t , which implies it drops from about 1 kpc to 100 pc or lower as the temperature drops from @xmath153 k to @xmath154 @xmath155 when we add metal - line cooling .",
    "this means , however , that the structures that we do not resolve are on scales as small as those of typical molecular clouds , ( sizes @xmath156 pc , masses @xmath157 ) .",
    "one could argue that in a gravitoturbulent system the scale imposed by the thermal sound speed is not relevant , since gas pressure is dominated by turbulence .",
    "however , the latter argument applies to the global instability of the disc , whereas locally collapse will be possible only in regions where turbulent support becomes negligible , in which @xmath158 approaches unity . in such regions",
    "thermal pressure support becomes important again , analogously to what happens in cores of familiar molecular clouds .",
    "enhanced cooling with metal - lines then simply shrinks the scale of collapse in the latter regions ( see e.g. @xcite , calling for more demanding resolution requirements ) . in runs with low dark matter halo concentration ,",
    "the shallower shear profile , as measured by @xmath159 , drives the fragmentation scale up , counteracting the effect of enhanced cooling and allowing clump formation on resolved scales .",
    "this can be understood from the definition of the toomre wavelength as well as from that of the modified local fragmentation length , introduced in section [ clumps ] .",
    "this happens for runs 2 and 15 ( also in the first one the mass resolution is higher than in the second case , see table [ table_resolution ] ) , which also have the highest gas fraction .      in what follows ,",
    "we want to investigate what happens when we change the structural parameter of our galaxy .",
    "+      we use virial velocity rather than virial mass to label our galaxy models because rotational velocities , or at least line - widths , are observable parameters in real galaxies , while total mass is not .",
    "our models have @xmath160 km / s . since we constructed models that obey the cold dark matter halos scaling between mass and velocity , @xmath161 @xcite , a difference of a factor 1.8 in mass corresponds to a difference of about 5.8 in velocity .",
    "based on our model building technique , the disc mass also scales as the total virial mass , while the radius scales as the velocity ( again see @xcite ) . as a result , the disc surface density ,",
    "both stellar and gaseous , varies by a factor @xmath162 .",
    "the toomre parameter and wavelength are inversely proportional to the surface density @xmath30 , suggesting thus that the disc should be more prone to fragmentation in the models with the highest @xmath93 ( see figure [ fig : comparison_v_vir ] ) .",
    "table [ table_runs ] shows that indeed this is what happens : the vast majority of runs with @xmath163 km / s does fragment , while the reverse is true for the models with @xmath164 km / s , which produce clumps only if they have low concentration and high gas fraction ( see figure [ fig : v_vir100 ] )",
    ".                         moreover the most massive clumps are found in the most massive galaxy ( run 27 ) or in runs without feedback after @xmath165 myr .",
    "this reflects the fact that , as we have already explained , mergers can drive up the mass of clumps further simply because more clumps form in more massive discs ( with higher @xmath93 ) .",
    "it does not reflect an intrinsic scaling of clump mass with the ratio of disc mass to virial velocity .",
    "indeed we find no systematic variation in the initial mass of clumps as we vary @xmath93 ( see section [ clumps ] ) .",
    "halo concentration modifies the toomre parameter by affecting the velocity / shear profile of the disc , namely the radial profile of @xmath166 .",
    "in particular , with all other parameters being equal , lowering the concentration leads to a shallower velocity profile towards the centre , hence a lower @xmath166 and thus a lower toomre parameter at fixed radius .",
    "for instance , as a result of this effect , galaxies are more prone to bar instabilities in lower concentration halos ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "therefore we expect models with lower concentration to be more susceptible to fragmentation .",
    "this is indeed what we find ( see table [ table_runs ] ) and , for example , it is clear by comparing run 16 with run 12 , see figures [ fig : gas_density_nofb_fb ] ( top panels ) and [ fig : gas_density_galaxy_cc6_fb ] .",
    "the two runs adopt the same sub - grid physics ( radiative cooling , star formation and feedback ) , but in run 12 the concentration is lower ( @xmath167 versus @xmath168 in run 16 ) .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : gas_density_galaxy_cc6_fb ] , decreasing the concentration produces more clumps than in run 16 ( again , see the top panels in figure [ fig : gas_density_nofb_fb ] ) and they survive for a longer period ( see , in particular , times 0.8 gyr to compare ) . they are completely dissolved after long enough time though ( 0.6 gyr after their formation ) . we stress that models with low concentration are most representative of the massive high redshift galaxies usually considered in the literature on giant clumps , but our goal in this paper is to carry out a comprehensive parameter study which applies also to less massive galaxies ( @xmath169 km / s ) , such as those studied in @xcite . +      since observations have shown that clumpy high redshift galaxies have a range of gas fractions @xmath170 @xcite , we study the effect of increasing the gas fraction in the discs .",
    "we note that in the simulations gas fractions account for the total gas content , while in observations only the molecular gas is detected .",
    "a posteriori we verified that , once radiative cooling is switched on , gas at and above the threshold density for star formation , @xmath171 atoms/@xmath172 , typically accounts for @xmath173 of the total gas content in the disc . at such high densities gas",
    "would be mostly molecular if the simulations included the phase transition between atomic and molecular gas , hence this shows that the quoted values of the gas fractions can be meaningfully compared with the observational estimates .",
    "inspection of table [ table_runs ] clearly shows that the number of runs , that lead to clumps , increases in the subset that adopts a higher gas fraction ( only 3 out of 12 runs with @xmath174 do not fragment , while only 5 out of 16 runs with @xmath175 do fragment ) . as an example , both run 22 and run 25 employ high resolution , have the same concentration , the same virial velocity and evolve with the same physics ( radiative cooling , star formation and feedback ) , they differ only by the gas fraction ( @xmath138 versus @xmath176 , respectively ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : gas_density_g03_g05_high_fb ] we can see that clumps form only in the case with higher gas fraction ( bottom panels ) .",
    "this is probably due to the fact that a higher gas fraction produces a lower q toomre parameter for the gas by increasing the surface density .",
    "note that even in the two - fluid case the toomre parameter would decrease somewhat , because the kinematically colder component of the two , namely the gas , increases its contribution to the disc mass with increasing gas fraction ( see equation ( [ eq : q_total ] ) in section [ intro ] ) , so the disc is more unstable .",
    "mass and spatial resolution also have an effect on the outcome of the instability . in our simulations",
    "we see that , with higher resolution , hence with initial conditions that have lower particle noise , the disc relaxes to a more stable state during the adiabatic evolution , which tends to suppress fragmentation .",
    "this shows the importance of relaxation and highlights the importance of minimizing the effects of built - in numerical perturbations , when studying disc instability .",
    "run 16 and run 22 are identical regarding the chosen structural parameters ( i.e. concentration @xmath177 , virial velocity @xmath99 km / s , gas fraction @xmath138 ) and the adopted sub - grid physics ( radiative cooling with no metal lines , feedback , no thermal and metal diffusion ) , they only differ by the resolution .",
    "the results are clear in the top panels of both figure [ fig : gas_density_nofb_fb ] and figure [ fig : gas_density_g03_g05_high_fb ] , for run 16 and 22 respectively . in the low resolution case , clumps form and",
    "disappear in @xmath178 myr , while in the high resolution case no clumps form .",
    "inspection of the q toomre parameter profile for both runs , see figure [ fig : toomre_low_high ] , clearly shows that the state of the disc emerging from the initial relaxation phase is different : in both cases the value of @xmath158 is similar , but in the low resolution simulation , run 16 , the disc is noisier at the beginning and the galaxy fragments immediately , while in the high resolution case , run 22 , the toomre parameter is smoother .",
    "the increased noise in the density field has been shown to easily trigger fragmentation in self - gravitating discs that are just close to the q threshold ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this has been shown robustly by imposing a small , percent level perturbation of the density field in both sph and amr protostellar disc models ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "+ we have checked differences in other quantities that may affect stability , such as star formation , but we found those to be negligible .",
    "however it is important to note that high resolution does not prevent fragmentation , indeed in runs 25 and 26 ( which have also higher gas fraction ) , we still observe clumps .",
    "unfortunately high resolution simulations require a long calculation time ( note that we stopped run 26 before the end of the simulation , due to its high computational cost ) , so we could not perform as many high resolution simulations as low resolution ones to make a systematic comparison . + for more toomre parameter profile evolution , look also at figure [ fig : toomre_other_runs ] .",
    "some of the runs were repeated with and without metal thermal diffusion ( mtd ) , others with the new gdsph method .",
    "diffusion and gdsph are designed to avoid artificial surface tension in sph , leading to a smoother , less noisy flow , which allows mixing of fluid phases and suppresses spurious clumps generated by numerical artefacts rather than gravitational instability ( @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the results of such runs should thus be regarded as more accurate relative to standard `` vanilla '' sph .",
    "first of all , inspection of table [ table_runs ] shows that both mtd and gdsph lead to a weakening of the fragmentation .",
    "clumps do form , but they disappear really quickly , sometimes in only one orbit ( @xmath179 gyr ) , becoming a transient phenomenon that has a negligible effect on disc evolution .",
    "in particular we run three simulations ( runs 3 , 20 and 21 ) with gdsph and we found that in two cases we have clumps formation ( in a low number , 1 - 2 ) , even with metal cooling switched on , while in the case with only feedback , run 20 , we still have the same results of run 16 , even if here clumpy phase lasts 0.1 gyr less and the number of clumps is lower than in run 16 ( see , for comparison , the top panels of figure [ fig : gas_density_nofb_fb ] and figure [ fig : newsph ] ) .",
    "we observe in general more moderate fragmentation as fewer clumps form and the disc stabilises sooner , while fragmentation happens even in the presence of metal cooling .",
    "hence we conclude that the effect of gdsph on fragmentation does not show a systematic trend .",
    "there is only a slight tendency to have longer lived clumps in standard sph , which can be an effect of the artificial surface tension present in that case .",
    "we have not carried out a high resolution version of these runs , but the discussion of the previous subsection leads us to think that , at higher resolution , fragmentation could be reduced further .              in this work",
    "we have studied in detail the masses and sizes of the clumps , obtained in our runs , and have applied results previously derived for protostellar and protoplanetary discs , in order to understand our results beyond the simple framework of the conventional toomre instability .",
    "+ we begin by noting that previous simulation work has claimed that clumps in massive high redshift galaxies are as large as @xmath180 kpc and have typical masses in the range @xmath181 @xmath23 , hence too massive and dense to be disrupted by winds generated by feedback @xcite .",
    "as it will be evinced by the analysis presented in this section , in our simulations clumps have typically smaller sizes , their diameter being @xmath182 pc , and their typical gaseous and stellar mass is in the range @xmath183 , although some clumps can reach stellar masses of @xmath184 @xmath23 after nearly 1 gyr of evolution , before being accreted onto the central bulge ( figure [ fig : hist_clumps_evolution ] ) .",
    "note that the mass resolution is @xmath185 @xmath23 as shown in table [ table_resolution ] , hence clumps with mass @xmath186 @xmath23 are extremely well resolved ( by several sph kernels as one kernel contains 32 particles ) .",
    "we decided to divide the analysis and consider separately the gaseous and stellar clump masses since this help to understand the physical processes affecting clump formation and evolution , and because most previous observational and theoretical work has focused on one of the two ( predominantly the stellar mass ) .",
    "in particular , since our galaxies do not accrete gas from the environment and the gas is depleted by star formation , we consider the gaseous clump mass at the beginning of our simulations and the stellar clump mass at the end , when clumps accreted mass by merging each other . since the average number of massive clumps ( above @xmath187 @xmath23 ) per galaxy is too small ( 10 in the case with more fragmentation , run 27 ) to make significant statements , we compute the mass distribution by stacking the results from all the simulations in order to have a significant statistical sample . + in order to obtain the histograms shown in figure [ fig : hist_clumps_evolution ] , we had to identify the clumps .",
    "we used the group finder skid @xcite , that identifies gravitationally bound groups in n - body simulations .",
    "it basically groups particles that satisfy a certain cut criterion , i.e. to have density above a minimum value of @xmath139 atoms/@xmath172 and temperature below a maximum value , @xmath188 k. + the mass distribution resulting from stacking is shown in figure [ fig : hist_clumps_evolution ] at three different times .",
    "first of all , at 0.3 gyr , when clumps can first be robustly identified with skid in all the fragmenting discs , at 0.5 gyr , when there is still enough gas to form new clumps , and at 0.7 gyr , when more than @xmath189 of the gas has been already consumed in star formation and the mass budget of clumps is clearly dominated by stars rather than gas . note that clumps start to condense out of the gas phase as early as @xmath99 myr in some simulations .",
    "this , combined with the rapid initial star formation burst ( figure [ fig : sfr_fb_vs_mc ] ) , explains why at @xmath138 gyr there are already massive stellar clumps present in the mass distribution of figure [ fig : hist_clumps_evolution ] .",
    "another important feature that can be evinced by inspection of figure [ fig : hist_clumps_evolution ] is that the gaseous mass of clumps peaks at @xmath190 @xmath23 , which suggests this is a characteristic mass of clumps set by the fragmentation process itself ( see discussion of characteristic clump mass later in this section ) .",
    "+ we also find ( figure [ fig : hist_clumps_evolution ] ) that this characteristic fragmentation mass scale is roughly independent on the mass of the disc as it is determined by the local conditions inside overdense spiral arms , a result that is discussed below in the context of a definition of the initial fragmentation mass that is alternative to the conventional toomre mass . instead , the final of the clumps does depend on the disc mass , since it is determined by evolutionary process that are enhanced at higher disc mass .",
    "+ in particular , by tracing the particles back in time we have also checked that the clumps in the high mass tail of the distribution at @xmath138 gyr , especially those already dominated by stars , are those that have undergone already mergers and that formed as early as @xmath79 myr .",
    "the bottom panels show , indeed , in contrast to the gas mass , the mean stellar clump mass increases with time leading to massive clumps exceeding @xmath191 @xmath23 with a tail around @xmath192 @xmath23 . using particle tracing to follow individual clumps",
    ", we verified that the latter high mass tail is mainly the result of multiple clump - clump mergers .",
    "hence it does not reflect the mass scale set by the fragmentation process , rather is a product of dynamical evolution .",
    "the most massive clumps , with masses well above @xmath129 , which would classify as giant clumps according to definitions used in the literature , arise in the most massive discs simply because more clumps form in those , thus increasing the likelihood of multiple mergers , and also because a larger gas reservoir is available for accretion .",
    "+ we caution , though , that such high mass tail is not statistically very significant due to the low number of clumps belonging to it and because it develops relatively late , while observed clumps are  young \" ( estimated ages @xmath193 myr , see @xcite ) .",
    "however , by mass the largest clumps can dominate the overall mass budget of clumps as a fraction of the disc mass , especially in the most massive discs ( see figure [ fig : cumulative_mass ] ) .",
    "we have also measured the maximum contribution in stellar mass that massive clumps give at any time over the total stellar mass of the disc and we have found that this is at most @xmath194 in the most massive discs ( typically around @xmath195 in the whole simulation sample ) .                 in figure [",

    "1 .   what is the clump mass we expect from the toomre instability analysis ?",
    "2 .   is the mass derived via the toomre analysis a sensible prediction for the clump mass , and do we understand the characteristic masses of the clumps found in the simulations in light of figure [ fig : hist_clumps_evolution ] ?",
    "these questions of course concern the initial fragmentation phase , so they are relevant to understand the _ initial masses _ of the clumps .",
    "their masses and sizes can still evolve via mass accretion from the surrounding disc , mass - losing tidal effects from disc tides and clump - clump gravitational encounters , and clump - clump mergers .",
    "all these effects are of course taken into account automatically in our analysis shown in figures [ fig : hist_clumps_evolution ] , [ fig : hist_clumps_total ] and [ fig : cumulative_mass ] , but will not be taken into account in the following discussion , since they concern a later evolutionary phase that is characterised by strongly nonlinear effects .",
    "+   + the toomre mass is defined ( e.g. @xcite ) as : @xmath197 where @xmath198 , the toomre wavelength , is the maximum unstable radial wavelength for a given local sound speed @xmath27 and ( axisymmetric ) background surface density @xmath30 and can be written as : @xmath199 assuming @xmath200 and the epicyclic frequency @xmath201 , with @xmath202 angular velocity ( we checked that this is a good approximation in our simulations ) .",
    "this wavelength should measure the maximum scale of fragmentation , hence should be comparable to the maximum mass of clumps soon after they form . the most unstable toomre wavelength , which is in equation ( [ eq : most_unstable ] ) , should instead be close to the characteristic clump mass soon after the onset of fragmentation , which is @xmath203 @xmath23 , based on the shape of the mass function shown in figure [ fig : hist_clumps_evolution ] .",
    "+             the surface density is usually computed from the toomre parameter using @xmath204 , with @xmath205 , where @xmath206 in this case is the azimuthally average value of @xmath44 for the gas only , which , at the onset of fragmentation , when the disc is still gas - rich , is very similar to the value obtained using the two - fluid approach . note @xmath27 is strictly the thermal sound speed for the remainder of this discussion , since regions that do fragment are by construction those in which the turbulent support is locally negligible ( see also section [ intro ] ) .",
    "+ we recall that the toomre mass and wavelength are obtained using linear perturbation theory for local axisymmetric perturbations in an isothermal thin disc , while in our case discs are thick , the instability is global and non - axisymmetric ( spiral modes form first , then clumps collapse inside the arms ) , and the fluid enters the nonlinear regime before clumps form . we will not attempt to account for all these limitations , since the simulation already does that by construction , but we will apply a model that overcomes at least partially the limitations of the toomre analysis while remaining still simple and providing an analytical estimate of the characteristic fragmentation mass .",
    "an important aspect of non - linearity is that in the toomre mass definition only the azimuthally averaged velocity of the unperturbed disc appears , even if the velocity is not the same everywhere in spiral unstable disc , i.e. spiral wave regions are already disturbed and have velocity gradients",
    ". it would thus seem that fragmentation is better described assuming the background gas is traversed by a spiral density wave , as in @xcite .",
    "these authors , who studied fragmentation in protoplanetary discs , use length scales and surface density perturbations that are appropriate for spiral arms .",
    "the radial extent of the fragmenting region in the non - axisymmetric conditions can be estimated using the results of @xcite , who used the virial theorem to show that a disc , under isothermal conditions , is most susceptible to fragmentation within a region @xmath207 from the corotation of a spiral wave . in this treatment",
    "the velocity is not the same everywhere as in toomre theory since , assuming the gas is cold and therefore pressure is negligible , it is the velocity gradient that prevents the gas from collapsing .",
    "this should define the size of clumps at the onset of fragmentation .",
    "there will be pressure gradients developing as the clump begins to collapse : in fact it may resist the collapse to some extent , but if the gas can cool efficiently , as it is the case in galaxy discs even more than in protoplanetary discs , this should be a secondary effect .",
    "indeed , using this approach @xcite could predict quite well the masses and sizes of clumps in their protoplanetary disc simulations , which were severely overestimated by the toomre wavelength . here",
    "we follow the same approach .",
    "+ we use the formula for the initial clump mass given in @xcite : @xmath208 where @xmath28 is the epicyclic frequency ( and , as we have already said , we checked that a good approximation in our case is @xmath201 , with @xmath202 angular velocity ) and @xmath209 is a free parameter , taking into account self gravity effect of all the system , stars and gas ( in all our cases it is equal to unity ) . note that in the @xcite framework the region that will collapse is independent on the disc surface density ( substituting equation ( [ eq : lambda ] ) in equation ( [ eq : mf ] ) , @xmath30 clearly cancels out ) , because it is assumed that this was already high enough to trigger the instability ( in other words , the disc has already reached a low toomre parameter value ) , instead it is only the material with locally coherent velocity field that continues to collapse , while the rest is sheared away .",
    "+   + now we use the equation ( [ eq : mf ] ) to compare the resulting mass , which we simply call `` local fragmentation mass '' , with the expected local toomre mass and with the mass of our clumps . in figure",
    "[ fig : comparing_mass_cc6_v150_gf03 ] we show a typical example of such comparison from run 12 , done at different times , reporting also the local jeans mass for completeness .",
    "+ one can notice two important facts .",
    "first , our local fragmentation mass estimate can predict fairly well the masses of the clumps at formation time , in contrast to the conventional toomre mass , which in the best case overestimates the masses of clumps by a factor of 5 - 6 .",
    "this satisfactorily confirms earlier results obtained for fragmentation in protoplanetary discs @xcite .",
    "clearly this mass estimate captures much better the physics of the fragmentation process .",
    "second , the conventional toomre mass yields an estimate in quite good agreement with the mass of the clumps at later times , but at this point clumps have grown in mass through processes unrelated to fragmentation such as gas accretion and mergers , hence the match is purely coincidental . for fairness , we note that if one uses the most unstable wavelength , namely the wavelength of the fastest growing mode , to define the toomre mass , an estimate for the clump mass more in agreement with ours can be obtained .",
    "+       kpc for run 16 , highlighting that a small bulge is already assembled before the clumpy phase , during which the central surface density grows only by a factor @xmath210.,scaledwidth=49.0% ]             in this section we discuss how clumps can contribute to the growth of a central stellar bulge in our simulations .",
    "+ bulges can form via mergers at high redshift , via secular evolution , due to the presence of a stellar bar bringing gas to the centre and turning into a spheroid via the buckling instability or resonant thickening @xcite , or via gravitational instability , producing giant gas clumps that spiral - in towards the centre via dynamical friction @xcite .",
    "recently it has been shown that disc galaxies forming in cosmological simulations can grow a bulge via bar instabilities , that are dynamically excited by satellites and minor mergers at high redshift , essentially an accelerated and more dynamical version of the picture proposed in @xcite .",
    "+ depending on their formation path , bulges develop different characteristics .",
    "classical bulges probably form via mergers and have high sersic index ( @xmath211 ) profiles .",
    "pseudobulges , instead , have disc - like density profiles and kinematics , low sersic index ( @xmath212 ) and probably originate by internal non - axisymmetric instabilities ( secular or dynamical ) .",
    "finally , classical bulges have older stellar populations than pseudobulge .",
    "analysis of the galaxies in the argo simulation supports this picture , but also shows that even bulges from minor mergers can have low sersic indexes as those classified as pseudobulges .",
    "in particular , at @xmath111 the central galaxy in argo , that is the most massive and has undergone a number of major mergers , is the only one that shows a sersic index high enough to be compatible with a classical bulge @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite find that classical bulge can form by both violent disc instabilities and mergers .",
    "bulges arising from collective mergers and spiral - in of clumps in simulations have been shown to have common characteristics to classical and pseudobulges @xcite .",
    "however , such previous works @xcite produced giant clumps in their simulations ( @xmath0 ) , and concluded that the clumpy phase can be a major stage of bulge formation . not surprisingly , in our simulations this does not happen , because clumps have moderate masses for the most part , and contribute only @xmath213 of the total mass budget of the disc in the most massive simulations . for simplicity we do not attempt to measure bulge - to - disc ratios ,",
    "rather we use the increase of central stellar surface density within the inner 0.5 - 1 kpc , where the stellar profile becomes significantly steeper ( see figures [ fig : bulge_ok ] and [ fig : bulge ] ) as a measure of the bulge growth . in this sense a moderate bulge forms by the end of the relaxation phase in all simulations , via angular momentum transport from weak spiral waves .",
    "however , it evolves little after fragmentation begins , in the sense that the increase of surface density is modest .",
    "in fact , inspection of figures [ fig : bulge_ok ] and [ fig : bulge ] shows that the surface density grows by a factor of @xmath214 in absence of clumps , while after fragmentation ensues it increases by less than a factor of 4 until the end of the simulations .",
    "the late mass accumulation at the centre is also not only provided by sinking clumps since simultaneously a strong spiral pattern persists , which would surely contribute to the mass inflow by torquing the gas .",
    "overall there is indeed quite some theoretical consensus , supported by a variety of simulation work , that gas inflows are the crucial ingredient for bulge formation @xcite .",
    "a peculiar case is that of run 25 ( right , bottom panels in figure [ fig : bulge ] ) , in which the central surface density grows before the clumpy phase by a factor @xmath215 , but it also grows during the clumpy phase by a similar factor .",
    "however this is an especially favourable case for clump formation among our runs , due to both high gas fraction and high virial velocity .",
    "yet we note that , when compared with observations of clumpy galaxies , which are biased towards massive and very gas rich galaxies , the structural properties of this galaxy model are not extreme @xcite .",
    "+ we emphasise that the presence of a small bulge already before fragmentation should not be regarded as an artifact of our simulations . spiral or bar instabilities will easily be excited during the chaotic early stages of galaxy formation ( see e.g. @xcite and @xcite ) via minor mergers and tidal interactions , and will inevitably drive gas inflows likely before the galaxy becomes massive enough to be prone to disc instability . the strength of non - axisymmetric instabilities will depend on the self - gravity of the discs , hence we expect it to be stronger in more massive discs .",
    "this is indeed what we see in the argo simulation , where massive galaxies ( @xmath216 km / s ) acquire a steeper inner stellar profile early ( at @xmath217 ) , while low mass galaxies ( @xmath218 km / s ) remain pure exponential discs with no bulge for much longer @xcite .",
    "hence , for massive galaxies such as those studied here it is actually more realistic to start from a configuration which already includes a small bulge .",
    "finally , it is worth noting that at the end of the simulation our galaxies exhibit a sersic index @xmath219 ( see figure [ fig : sersic_index ] ) , typical of pseudo - bulges , in good agreement with the galaxies in the argo simulation , which do not undergo fragmentation .",
    "this is true also in the case of run 27 , which hosts the most massive galaxy / disc in our sample .",
    "once again this is consistent with the notion clumps have moderate masses in our simulations , hence they can not contribute appreciably to the mass budget of the bulge , and therefore the inner surface density slope has to converge to the slope achieved via gas inflows driven by ordinary non - axisymmetric instabilities in absence of clumps .",
    "+ in conclusion we do not have an analog of the subset of classical bulges formed in the cosmological simulations of @xcite without a significant contribution of mergers to their mass assembly .",
    "this might either reflect the fact that gas inflows in unstable discs can be much stronger in fully cosmological simulations relative to our isolated setups , thus steepening further the bulge profile , or that mergers , despite they do not carry most of the mass to the bulge , are still instrumental in enhancing such gas inflows .",
    "in this paper we have revisited the susceptibility of gas - rich galactic discs to large - scale fragmentation driven by gravitational instability as well as the typical masses and sizes of clumps eventually produced by fragmentation .",
    "we have thus focused only on in - situ clump formation within gas - rich hi - z discs , whereas recent work employing cosmological simulations has shown that such in - situ clumps would co - exist with an ex - situ population produced by minor mergers and galaxy interactions @xcite .",
    "previous numerical works studying clumpy galaxies have employed both cosmological simulations and isolated disc simulations . for the systematic study presented in this paper",
    "we have decided to use isolated galaxy simulations because these allow us to check carefully the effect of every single parameter of galaxy structure ( concentration , virial velocity / mass , disc gas fraction ) , to deeply explore the effect of sub - grid physics , and to reach higher resolution compared to cosmological simulations . in passing we",
    "note that cosmological simulations , published claiming resolutions similar to those of our standard runs , actually achieve that resolution only for the deepest levels of refinements using amr techniques @xcite , while for smaller scale astrophysical discs it has already been shown , using both sph and amr codes , that the _ initial resolution _",
    "before the onset of fragmentation is crucial in order to capture fragmentation correctly @xcite .",
    "+ the bottom line of our investigation is that the formation of giant clumps with masses much above @xmath187 @xmath23 via disc fragmentation is not a common occurrence when a large sample of galaxies spanning an order of magnitude in mass and a wide range of structural properties and sub - grid physics is considered . the typical gaseous mass of clumps is in the range @xmath220 @xmath23 for gas - rich galaxy discs with masses in the range @xmath221 . which is well understood since it is close to the initial fragmentation mass inferred with the notion of local collapse inside self - gravitating spiral arms explained in section [ clumps ] . the latter fragmentation mass is typically 5 - 6 times smaller than the toomre mass . at late times",
    "the stellar and baryonic masses ( gas + stars ) of clumps are skewed to somewhat larger values , peaking at @xmath222 @xmath23 , reflecting the role of gas accretion and , especially , clump - clump mergers .",
    "galaxy discs at the high mass tail of the the distribution observed at @xmath2 ( e.g. @xcite ) are the most favourable hosts for giant clumps .",
    "indeed a typical example is run 27 , which at late times has clumps exceeding @xmath192 @xmath23 . in this high mass regime",
    "our results on the mass spectrum of clumps are consistent with those of previous simulations that indeed focused on very massive discs ( e.g. @xcite .",
    "however , we argue our galaxy models with @xmath223 km / s , which yield @xmath224 km / s , are more representative based on the recent observations by @xcite .",
    "+ the role of feedback is very important since it affects the degree of fragmentation , hence the available mass in the clumpy phase and thus , indirectly , how high the clump mass can become through clump - clump mergers .",
    "feedback thus acts to stabilize the disc against persistent fragmentation but does not affect individual clumps once they form .",
    "the initial mass of clumps at fragmentation is also independent on feedback .",
    "this means that in our case feedback does not suppress systematically lower mass clumps , although we caution that we lack the treatment of other forms of feedback , such as radiation pressure and ionizing radiation from massive stars , that could destroy the clumps from inside . without feedback ,",
    "clump formation is much more vigorous and gives rise to longer - lasting clumps that can grow until they reach very high masses ( @xmath225 @xmath23 before sinking in towards the bulge .",
    "+ an important feature of our simulations concerns the way we prepare `` quiet '' initial conditions , by letting the disc relax adiabatically for 1 gyr and then cool down from a high toomre parameter configuration , a procedure that is followed in studies of high - z discs , while being quite commonly adopted for reasons of numerical robustness in studies of small scale self - gravitating astrophysical discs @xcite .",
    "such studies have shown that gravitationally unstable discs , which are artificially started with toomre parameters close to unity and no relaxation , lead to numerically amplified fragmentation and larger masses of bound condensations .",
    "this is likely one important reason why clumps in our discs are smaller and lighter than in previous work .",
    "in addition , relaxation gives rise to the formation of a small central density enhancement in the galaxy , with density profile similar to a pseudobulge , which surely helps to stabilise the inner disc .",
    "cosmological hydrodynamical simulations show that such central enhancement is seen to form already at @xmath113 in massive disc galaxies as a result of early gas inflows ( @xcite ) , hence its presence in our models should be regarded as realistic .",
    "numerical improvements over standard sph , such as thermal diffusion and geometric density sph , lead to comparable or weaker fragmentation , depending on the specific run , suggesting that our results are conservative .",
    "+ since in our simulations typical clumps are smaller and lighter than the giant clumps highlighted in previous work on fragmenting discs , being essentially oversized giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) , we argue that a sizable fraction of the giant clumps identified in observations could have a different origin , such as from minor mergers or other ex - situ contributions ( see e.g. @xcite ) , or may result from blending of smaller subunits that are artificially smeared out owing to lack of resolution .",
    "indeed , all the measurements of the physical properties of clumps suffer from seeing - limited observations . when performed from ground - based telescopes",
    ", they can at best reach an angular resolution of 0.5-0.8 `` fwhm , unless the adaptive optics is deployed , which allows to improve the angular resolution to an effective @xmath2260.2 '' fwhm @xcite .",
    "this is hence almost comparable to what can be achieved with the hubble space telescope ( 0.15 \" fwhm ) .",
    "however , such an angular resolution still corresponds to a relatively high physical scale of @xmath227 kpc at @xmath2 @xcite . the only way currently to beat this limit is with the help of gravitational lensing , which leads to a stretching of the lensed object such that physical scales as low as @xmath19 pc may be reached at @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "note that insufficient resolution in observations , in addition to prevent from disentangling two nearby clumps , could potentially lead to confuse a young bulge in formation for a massive clump since there is often not enough information on the global galaxy morphology ( see @xcite ) .",
    "note that the bulge in our simulations is more massive than the most massive clumps formed through disc fragmentation but its structural properties and mean stellar age are quite similar to those of massive clumps .",
    "it is then noteworthy that results on the mass function of clumps are in good agreement with the observed mass spectrum of clumps presented in @xcite .",
    "these authors , owing to gravitational lensing , focus on rather `` common '' galaxies at redshift @xmath228 rather than only on the bright end , and find a cut - off mass for the clump mass equal to @xmath187 @xmath23 for @xmath229 and @xmath230 @xmath23 for @xmath231 .",
    "this cut - off should be thought as the maximum mass a clump can reach given a certain luminosity function .",
    "moreover the kinematics of the discs in our simulations , which maintains @xmath232 throughout the fragmentation stage , seems in good agreement with observations ( e.g. @xcite ) , suggesting that the underlying disc dynamics is in a similar regime and that the disc is relatively undisturbed by clump formation , which argues against very large clumps roaming through it .",
    "our results do not imply an important role of clumps in galaxy evolution , in particular they suggest that clumps are not a major channel of stellar bulge growth . indeed in our simulations a small bulge is built up before the formation of the clumps and is not modified significantly as a result of inward clump migration .",
    "this conclusion is at odds with that of recent work on the role of clumps in galaxy evolution , that identifies them as a major channel of bulge formation ( @xcite ) . + while our simulations are partially based on input parameters from cosmological simulation , they are still fairly idealised , since discs are evolved in isolation without accreting mass or interacting with other galaxies . @xcite",
    "have emphasised how the formation of giant clumps might be triggered in rapidly accreting galaxies at high redshift .",
    "the importance of gas accretion has been emphasised also in studies of fragmentation of protostellar and protoplanetary discs into sub - stellar companions @xcite , which have shown that a disc , that would be stable in isolation , can fragment if gas is damped on a timescale shorter than the typical orbital time ( note however the initial clump mass is still well reproduced by our local fragmentation mass scale ( see @xcite ) .",
    "strong tidal perturbations by massive companions might also excite the instability .",
    "while these effects are built - in in the argo cosmological simulation , our study suggests that the absence of fragmentation in the argo galaxies might be due to a combination of factors , such as the relatively low masses and virial velocities of galaxies therein ( except the very massive central , which has a circular velocity @xmath233 km / s , all the others have @xmath93 close to @xmath234 km / s at @xmath235 ) and the fact most of them have moderate gas fractions , perhaps due to excessive efficient star formation .",
    "we should be warned that the regime of triggered / tidally excited instability might be different from the regime of instability in isolated discs , mainly because the initial perturbation can be stronger and excite larger scale spiral modes , which may have trigger larger collapsing patches .",
    "however , once again work done in star and planet formation has taught us that the outcome can go in an unexpected directions .",
    "disc instability can indeed be stifled rather than enhanced in presence of perturbing companions ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless , in light of our new results , we should also revisit the effect of both gas accretion and external perturbers in the specific context of high redshift discs , but once again with controlled experiments that allow to understand the results in depth .",
    "one first step in this direction is to understand the role of gas accretion alone , in absence of external perturbers . to this aim in a forthcoming paper",
    "we will present new simulations using cooling halo models ( e.g. @xcite , ) in which the gas and stellar discs are not initialised using a prescribed model , rather they form self - consistently from an accretion flow undergoing radiative cooling inside a dark halo .",
    "preliminary results show that the sizes and masses of the clumps are similar to those presented in this paper . as long as cosmological simulations will not yield naturally a realistic rate of conversion of gas into stars , while simultaneously capturing correctly the internal structure of discs from high to low redshifts",
    ", simulations such as those presented in this paper and those now in progress will remain a valuable complement to understand processes occurring in the interstellar medium on galactic and sub - galactic scales .",
