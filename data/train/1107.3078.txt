    "hadronization the process through which a state characterized by colored dynamical partons is resolved into a state of colorless hadrons is central to the theory of the strong interaction , but remains only incompletely understood .",
    "an important aspect of this process has become clear in studies of the forward region in hadron - hadron collisions  @xcite and in high - multiplicity collisions of ultra - relativistic heavy ion collisions  @xcite : the hadronization of a parton is strongly affected by the presence of other partons close in phase space . whereas the vacuum hadronization of a single parton liberated in a high momentum - transfer",
    "( @xmath3 ) interaction is described in terms of string - breaking scenarios or parameterized in fragmentation functions , there is mounting evidence that , in a dense phase - space scenario , colored partons essentially `` coalesce '' into colorless bound states , much like the formation of light nuclei ( e.g. deuteron or triton ) from free nucleons emitted from a hot zone  @xcite .",
    "models based on this remarkably simple mechanism , not understood at a fundamental level , have enjoyed considerable success at describing the `` leading hadron effect ''  @xcite as well as the multiplicity dependence of yields , spectra and momentum anisotropies from heavy ion collisions at the highest energies at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic )  @xcite .",
    "even more remarkably , the objects that coalesce appear to be valence quarks . at first , this is surprising , since the dynamical quantities in qcd ( i.e. the ones that carry momentum ) are _ partons _ which are overwhelmingly gluons and non - valence quarks .",
    "indeed , the valence _",
    "quarks_ three for baryons and two for mesons were originally invented to explain the flavored quantum numbers isospin , strangeness , etc of the hadrons .",
    "only later was the connection established between the valence quarks and the high momentum - fraction ( @xmath4 ) fermionic partons .",
    "nevertheless , the two or three valence quarks represent the lowest fock states of the partonic wavefunction of a hadron , and these appear the relevant degrees of freedom ; it is argued that inclusion of higher - order fock states does not significantly modify the description of the coalescence process and the related phenomenology  @xcite .",
    "the data at rhic is consistent with a partially thermalized system of deconfined quarks undergoing collective expansion with an azimuthal anisotropy in momentum space proportional to the initial spatial anisotropy  @xcite .",
    "as the system cools , pairs and triplets of neighboring quarks coalesce to become the valence quarks ( or `` constituent quarks '' ) of mesons and baryons ( where the gluons presumably contribute to dressing the valence quarks  @xcite ) .",
    "the original flow pattern of the deconfined quarks leaves a simple and characteristic fingerprint on the momentum distribution of the observed hadrons , since a hadron s momentum is simply the ( vector ) sum of the momenta of its valence quarks @xmath5 where @xmath6 ( 3 ) for mesons ( baryons ) . in the simplest instantaneous @xmath7 or @xmath8 coalescence process ,",
    "only three of the four momentum components are conserved ; either energy or momentum conservation is violated  @xcite .",
    "the most important features of quark coalescence that we discuss in this paper are not substantially altered in a more complete treatment of the phenomenon , accounting for energy and entropy conservation effects  @xcite .    in particular , the quarks radial flow the enhancement towards higher transverse momentum ( @xmath9 ) due to pressure - driven expansion of the bulk source is reflected most strongly in the three - quark baryons .",
    "thus , coalescence provides a natural explanation for the `` anomolous baryon enhancement '' at intermediate @xmath9 observed in the highest - energy heavy ion collisions at rhic  @xcite .",
    "similarly , the nuclear modification factor the scaled ratio @xmath10 of transverse momentum distributions from heavy ion and @xmath11 collisions shows a clear separation into mesons and baryons  @xcite .    in heavy ion collisions ,",
    "the azimuthal anisotropy of the momentum distribution is characterized by fourier components , @xmath12 where @xmath13 is measured relative to the direction of the impact parameter  ( c.f .",
    "* for a full discussion ) .",
    "of particular interest is the elliptic flow parameter @xmath14 , which is strongly sensitive to the equation of state of qcd matter ( e.g. speed of sound ) as well as tranport coefficients like viscosity . for small values of @xmath15 and narrow hadronic wavefunctions ,",
    "the elliptic flow parameters of a bulk system of quarks ( @xmath16 and @xmath17 ) and the mesons into which they coalesce , are related by  @xcite @xmath18 for fixed momentum fractions @xmath19 and @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) , with an analogous equation for baryons .    in the event that the constituent quarks ( @xmath16 and @xmath17 ) have the same elliptic flow before hadronization , equation  [ eq : v2quarksmesons ] leads to the number - of - constituent - quark ( ncq ) scaling pattern observed at rhic , @xmath22 where @xmath6 ( 3 ) for mesons ( baryons ) . in this scenario ,",
    "all mesons should follow one common @xmath14 curve , and all baryons another .",
    "the two should be related via @xmath23      the observed satisfaction of eq .",
    "[ eq : ncqscaling2 ] in au+au collisions at rhic was one of the most compelling indications that deconfined partonic degrees of freedom were playing a dynamic role in the bulk medium of the early phase .",
    "consequently , the _ breakdown _ of this scaling as the beam energy is reduced , is an important signal in the rhic energy scan program  @xcite .",
    "it may indicate that the initial energy density of the system is below the threshold for qgp creation , pinpointing the phase transition between confined and deconfined qcd matter .",
    "additionally , it has been recently proposed  @xcite that a deconfined bulk system at finite baryon density may acquire an electric quadrupole moment due to chiral magnetic waves in the plasma .",
    "this interesting phenomenon would break the degeneracy between @xmath15 for positive and negative pions , also clearly breaking ncq scaling .",
    "it is important to consider other less exotic mechanisms that may also cause violation of the scaling represented by eq .",
    "[ eq : ncqscaling2 ] .",
    "in particular , we recall that this scaling should hold if all quarks ( and antiquarks ) have the same underlying flow distribution ( @xmath24 in equation  [ eq : ncqscaling2 ] ) .",
    "this would be a natural conseqence of thermalization .",
    "the scenario where all constituent quarks have the same @xmath24 we call ncq@xmath25 .     in this paper",
    ", we examine whether the breakdown of eq .",
    "[ eq : ncqscaling2 ] would necessarily signal that the hadrons are not resulting from the coalescence of flowing constituent quarks .",
    "in particular , we discuss a minimal extension of the ncq@xmath25 model that retains constituent quarks as the dynamical degrees of freedom and coalescence as the hadronization mechanism .",
    "however , the assumption that all quarks have the same @xmath24 is discarded due to the well - recognized phenomenon of baryon stopping , which is increasingly important at lower energies . in particular",
    ", we recall that the transport of baryon number from the entrance channel to midrapidity ( `` stopping '' ) is increasingly important at lower energies . since we continue to work in the dynamical constituent quark paradigm , this means that @xmath26 and @xmath27 quarks transported from @xmath28 to @xmath29 surely suffer multiple collisions with each other .",
    "meanwhile , at the lower energies in question , the quark - antiquark pairs created from the vacuum may experience relatively fewer . in a picture where @xmath24 is developed through collisions , it is not unreasonable to expect that quarks transported from @xmath28 to @xmath29 will develop a larger @xmath15 .",
    "such considerations will lead to a specific pattern for the breakdown of eq .",
    "[ eq : ncqscaling2 ] . without invoking exotic phenomena",

    "we also use measured particle yields to estimate the fraction of @xmath26 and @xmath27 quarks at midrapidity that would arise from baryon stopping at two collision energies . in section  [ sec : twocomponent ] , we consider quantitatively a two component model for quark number scaling ncq@xmath32 , in which the phenomenon of stopping leads to at least two samples of quarks with different @xmath24 values which then coalesce into hadrons . for tractability , we idealize this non - thermal distribution in a two - component formalism : transported quarks follow one flow profile and produced quarks another . we briefly summarize in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "in this section , we briefly review the phenomenon of baryon stopping in heavy ion collisions .",
    "we then use hadron yields measured by the na49/sps collaboration to estimate the fraction of @xmath26 and @xmath27 quarks at midrapidity that would arise from stopping .",

    "[ eq : ncqscaling2 ] .      in the rhic energy scan program , the beam energy is varied to modify the initial conditions of the hot qcd system created .",
    "in addition to changing the energy density of the initial state , it is well - accepted that , due to baryon stopping , the baryo - chemical potential @xmath33 of the system is larger at lower @xmath2 .",
    "baryon stopping , the transport of baryon number from its initial location at beam rapidity towards the initially baryon - free region at mid - rapidity , is most directly measured via the rapidity distribution of net protons ( the number of protons minus antiprotons ) . at @xmath34 5",
    "gev , the rapidity distribution is peaked at midrapidity . as the collision energy",
    "is increased , the distribution peaks at increasingly forward rapidity .",
    "this behavior has been parametrized as an average rapidity loss , which increases from approximately 1 unit at @xmath34 5 gev to 1.7 unit at @xmath34 17 gev , with a smaller rise towards 2 units by the highest rhic @xmath2 of 200 gev@xcite .",
    "this rise in rapidity loss is less rapid than the rise in the beam rapidity with increasing @xmath2 , leading to a decreasing population of net baryon number at mid - rapidity .",
    "more detailed statistical model calculations , based on measurements of the yields of a range of particles , agree with this general conclusion . within these models , with increasing @xmath2 the net baryon density first rises , achieves a maximum at @xmath34 8 gev , and then falls for higher  @xcite .",
