    "@xcite that coulomb screening during the primordial nucleosynthesis may have an effect on the nuclear reaction rates and can enhance the nucleosynthesis process which could change the estimates of the parameters @xmath7 in lcc .",
    "such a screening mechanism can be studied as follows . at the epoch of nucleosynthesis ,",

    "@xcite . one can also calculate the coulomb screening for the early universe by using the well - known mean field approximation but with appropriate modifications .",
    "this can then be incorporated in the nuclear reaction rates .",
    "this is a completely different task than the standard bbn where the reaction network contains only 88 reactions and 26 nuclide @xcite because only light elements can be synthesized up to the observed levels due to rapid expansion of universe and a very little amount of metallicity is produced ( z@xmath12 @xmath13(10@xmath14 ) @xcite .",
    "the modified nucleosynthesis code for the linear evolution of the scale factor @xcite on the other hand considers a heavy network of 557 reaction rates and 130 nuclide since heavy elements ( eg .",

    "this has its roots in the slower expansion rates of the universe @xcite . in order to determine the correct amount of nuclide abundance ,",

    ", we can artificially modify our screening result by rescaling the screening potential by some screening parameter @xmath1 which is defined in the following way : e_s = ( - _ s z_2 y(0 ) ) ;   _ s=/. with @xmath1 that can be considered to be lying in a range between 0 and 100 .",

    "these plots abundantly show that the baryon to photon ratio ( @xmath98 ) decreases and the electron neutrino degeneracy parameter(@xmath8 ) becomes more negative with @xmath1 respectively .",
    "this suggests that , even by enhancing the coulomb screening effects 100 times , the nucleosynthesis parameters lie with in the error bars of the previous work @xcite .",
    "hence , we conclude that the coulomb screening does not form any key ingredient for the primordial nucleosynthesis even in slow evolving cosmological models .",
    "in this article , we have considered the effect of coulomb screening on the primordial nucleosynthesis in a linearly coasting universe via nuclear reaction rates .",

    "to determine the screening effect , we used the mean field approximation and solved the poisson equation in the appropriate conditions that exist during primordial nucleosynthesis in linearly coasting universe . due to lack of analytical solutions",

    "these numerical results are in good agreement with the results of itoh et al .    in order to interpret the whole effect of coulomb screening qualitatively we also determined the key reaction rates from 557 reactions which significantly affect the element abundances .",
