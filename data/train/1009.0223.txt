    "one of the principal manners in which to study high redshift galaxies is through the use of quasar ( qso ) absorption line systems .",
    "these absorption line systems with the largest n@xmath12as measured by the lyman-@xmath0@xmath14 1215 line are classified into two groups , the sub - damped lyman-@xmath0systems ( sub - dlas : 19.0 @xmath1 log n@xmath12@xmath1 20.3 @xmath15 ) and damped lyman-@xmath0systems ( dlas : log n@xmath12@xmath2 20.3 @xmath15 ) .",
    "although it is relatively easy to obtain high s / n spectra of qsos with the large telescopes and sensitive high resolution spectrographs available today , much of the difficulty in interpreting the data from spectroscopic observations of qso absorbers is that the environment in which the absorbing gas is residing is almost always unknown .",
    "there have been many studies aimed at imaging of dlas ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , many of these studies have resulted in non - detections , or detections of dwarf or low surface brightness galaxies .",
    "higher redshift systems ( @xmath16 ) are increasingly difficult to detect , with only @xmath810 percent of the host galaxies of dlas identified .",
    "the non - detection of luminous galaxies in most dlas searched for , together with the low metallicities and weak metallicity evolution determined via the absorption lines of undepleted elements such as s or zn in the dla systems ( e.g. @xcite ) suggests that while these objects do contain the majority of neutral gas in the universe @xcite , they may be tracing mainly star formation in lower mass galaxies .",
    "chemical evolution models of dwarf galaxies predict low metallicity that slowly evolves until more recent times @xcite .",
    "we have recently completed a survey of 31 sub - dlas at @xmath17 using the magellan inamori kyocera echelle ( mike ) and ultraviolet visual echelle spectrograph ( uves ) @xcite . at odds with the typically low metallicities seen in dla systems , several of the sub - dlas in the sample showed near solar or above solar metallicity ( i.e. [ zn / h]@xmath40.0 ) .",
    "in fact , a trend towards increasing metallicity with decreasing n@xmath12is seen over three decades in n@xmath12@xcite .",
    "several possibilities exist to explain such a trend : 1 ) there is a dust obscuration bias that limits the number of observable metal rich dlas to be observed as the amount of dust increases with metallicity @xcite ; 2 ) the low h i column densities in the sub - dla regime are a result of conversion of neutral hydrogen into molecular gas , which is forming stars and producing the metals ; 3 ) the lower h i column densities are a result of increased ionisation from star forming regions that produce metals that enrich the surrounding areas ; 4 ) sub - dlas are _ intrinsically _ more likely to arise in massive galaxies which are typically more metal rich @xcite . in all likelihood , it is possible that all of these effects are at work together to produce the observed trend .",
    "few sub - dlas have been directly imaged to date @xcite . with this in mind , we have started a program to conduct follow up imaging of sub - dlas at @xmath18 to determine the nature of these systems . here , we present deep soar imaging of the five qso fields q0826 - 2230 , sdss j1009 - 0026 , sdss j1228 + 1018 , sdss j1323 - 0021 , and sdss j1436 - 0051 . the structure of this paper is as follows : the observations are discussed in @xmath19 2 , notes on the individual fields are given in @xmath19 3 , results of the observations are given in @xmath19 4 , and a discussion is given in @xmath19 5 .",
    "spectra of the qsos showing the absorption lines can be found in @xcite .",
    "these data were obtained with the 4.1 m southern observatories astrophysics research ( soar ) telescope located at cerro pachn , and the soar optical imager ( soi ) camera during february and march 2009 .",
    "roughly 1.5 nights were lost due to weather during the 4 night run .",
    "the soi camera has a pixel scale of @xmath80.154 arcsec pix@xmath20 with 2@xmath212 binning , which was used throughout the observations .",
    "the two 2k@xmath214k detectors are arranged in a mosaic configuration with a @xmath88 arcsec gap between the detectors .",
    "the total field of view of this instrument is 5.25@xmath215.25 .    each field",
    "was observed in some combination of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) ( @xcite ) @xmath22 filter set .",
    "the targets in this investigation were selected mainly due to visibility at the soar telescope and the redshift of the absorber , favoring the lower redshift systems in our prior spectroscopic sample to increase the chances of detections .",
    "exposure times in each band and coordinates of the background qso are given in table [ tab : obs ] .",
    "each exposure was dithered by @xmath810 arcsec to fill the gap between the detectors and minimize the effects of bad pixels .",
    "individual exposure times ranged from 300 to 900 seconds , depending on the magnitude of the background qso .",
    "series of twilight sky flats were taken at the beginning of each night for each filter and used for the flat - field images .",
    "we have reduced these data with the theli pipeline available at ` http://www.astro.uni-bonn.de/\\simmischa/theli.html ` @xcite .",
    "theli is a multipurpose pipeline configurable for many mosaic imagers .",
    "data reduction proceeds with typical steps for imaging data .",
    "the mosaic frames are first split , then overscan corrected and trimmed .",
    "next , the frames are bias corrected .",
    "a flat field image is made from the twilight exposures taken with the same filter used for the science frames .",
    "the data are then processed and a superflat is created from the smoothed data and a fringe model is also created for fields observed in the @xmath23 and @xmath24 bands . the fringe model is then scaled and subtracted from the calibrated data .",
    "we used the scamp package for astrometric calibration and swarp for combining the individual frames .",
    "both of these packages can be found at ` http://terapix.iap.fr/ ` .",
    "the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) astrometric catalog was used for all fields except for q0826@xmath62230 , for which we used the 2 micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) for astrometric references .",
    "the fields were photometrically calibrated from the sdss catalogues for the fields with multiple sources with @xmath25 detected in both the sdss images and these data .",
    "the photometric zero point for the field of q0826 - 2230 , which is outside of the sdss footprint was calibrated by determining the slope of the best fit line between the photometric zero points and airmasses of these fields as well as four others not published here .",
    "sextractor version 2.5.0 was used for object identification and final catalog creation @xcite .",
    "a 7@xmath217 convolution mask of a gaussian psf with fwhm of 4 pixels was used to filter the images during object detection . only objects",
    "greater than 3@xmath13 above the background noise were included in the final catalogs , with a minimum area of ten pixels .",
    "magnitudes given in the text are isophotal , and centroid positions are windowed .",
    "the magnitudes have been corrected for galactic extinction using the online calculator available at ` http://www.ipac.caltech.edu/forms/calculator.html ` .",
    "all magnitudes given here are in the ab system .",
    "three band colour images were also made of the frames using the prescription detailed in @xcite .",
    "the images were aligned in pixel space , and a scaling was applied to each channel that attempted to match the colours of the objects seen in the sdss images .",

    "the mean @xmath33of sub - dlas as a population is @xmath8125 km s@xmath20 , slightly higher than the mean for dlas of 103 km s@xmath20@xcite .",
    "the sub - dlas in this work have a slightly lower mean velocity width than the total sub - dla population of @xmath33=107 km s@xmath20 .",
    "the complex velocity profiles seen in some absorption line systems have often been attributed to merging or interacting galaxies @xcite .",
    "the profiles for both the systems in the spectrum of q1436@xmath60051 are not unusually broad , each extending @xmath8100 km s@xmath20 . if the interacting galaxies seen to the south of this field are indeed responsible for the absorption line system , then at least in this case interacting galaxies surprisingly do not seem to produce a complex velocity structure . at smaller impact parameters the profiles may show signs of broader velocity profiles .",
    "the inclination of the disk to the qso line of sight possibly plays a large part in the kinematic width of the absorption profiles .    it is interesting to note that although the recent compilation of @xcite focused on dla systems ( 77 total systems were included in the sample , with only 7 sub - dlas and all had log n@xmath12@xmath220.0 ) , one of the systems with a high molecular fraction was in fact a sub - dla .",
    "similarly high molecule rich sub - dlas have also been seen in other investigations @xcite .",
    "it would be interesting to expand the number of h@xmath81 measurements in sub - dlas to see if they are perhaps also have high molecular fractions , and thus favoring the scenario where the lower h i column densities are due to the conversion of gas from neutral to molecular .",
    "although the number of dlas or sub - dlas that have been observed with high quality spectra has increased , there is still a very small number of galaxies that have been confirmed at the redshift of the absorber with followup spectroscopic measurements .",
    "even fewer dlas have spectra of the host galaxy of high enough s / n that can be used to determine the properties of the galaxy s stellar population such as the star formation rate ( sfr ) , masses and star formation histories via spectral template fitting and emission line diagnostics .",
    "followup spectroscopy is clearly necessary to link the properties we see in absorption such as the metallicity , kinematics , and abundance patterns with the properties of the stellar populations of the host galaxies .",
    "dlas and sub - dlas are likely to arise in a range of environments , a larger sample with imaging and spectroscopy of the host galaxies would reveal any potential dichotomy in the populations .",
    "the sub - dla systems in this sample seem to arise in a range of environments themselves , from the inner region of a possible early type galaxy in the case of the sub - dla in sdss j1323@xmath60021 , from the periphery of a luminous star forming galaxy in sdss j1009@xmath60026 and from the outskirts of an interacting pair of galaxies in sdss j1436@xmath60051 .",
    "however , in all cases we observe luminous galaxies that are the likely host galaxies of these metal rich absorbers . a large sample of both spectroscopic and photometric measurements of dla and",
    "sub - dla host galaxies will allow for studying trends between luminosity , impact parameter , and sfr .",
    "higher spatial resolution imaging with the hst would also allow for detailed information on the morphology of the absorbing galaxies .",
