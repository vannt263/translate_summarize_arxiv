    "( f ) , even though the system is homogeneous , the transition ( @xmath47 @xmath12 to @xmath64 ) itself is always anisotropic due to its coupling with the spatial wave function ( recall that @xmath65orbitals have highly anisotropic shapes ) .",
    "the anisotropy induced by the active orbital degrees of freedom distinguishes the nature between a spin  only and a spin  orbit coupled exchange interaction and makes the calculation of the exchange matrix difficult due to the presence of many off  diagonal matrix elements .",

    "an unit transition tensor operator in the total moment @xmath39 hilbert space is defined as : @xmath66where @xmath67 are the magnetic moment states which range from @xmath68to @xmath69 . a matrix defined in the same hilbert",

    "it is called the spherical harmonics super basis because its members follow exactly the same symmetry as the spherical harmonics .",

    ", the multipoles do not refer to any spatial distribution but to the rotational properties of a matrix , or more precisely , to the transitions of magnetic moments .",
    "although they follow the same algebra , they do not correspond to the same physical meaning .",
    "similarly , we can also define the cubic harmonics super basis , where all the operators are hermitian@xcite @xmath106 \\\\",
    "t_{k}^{-q } & = \\frac{i}{\\sqrt{2}}[y_{k}^{-q}(j)-(-1)^{q}y_{k}^{-q}(j ) ] .",
    "\\notag\\end{aligned}\\]]for @xmath70 case , these are pauli matrices : @xmath107 , @xmath108 , @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "also , this basis follows the same symmetry as cubic harmonics : @xmath92 , @xmath111 , @xmath112 and @xmath113 .",
    "therefore , instead of using abstract @xmath114 indexes , we will label these tensor operators using their symmetry : @xmath115 , @xmath116 , @xmath117 , @xmath118 , @xmath119 , @xmath120 , @xmath121 , etc .",
    "it is straightforward to rewrite the spin ",
    "orbit coupled exchange interaction by using different super bases : @xmath122the couplings among multipolar operators now appear naturally , and the coupling matrices in different bases can be linked by using unitary transformations . obviously , one can define other super bases by making different linear combinations of them .",
    "the benefit of using appropriate super basis is that the coupling matrix may become block diagonal or even completely diagonal when using appropriate symmetry .     and the real part of analogous spherical harmonics .",
    "states to expand the matrices are ordered by @xmath123 , @xmath124 and @xmath125 .",
    "each member has its analogous spatial function as @xmath92 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath126 , @xmath127 , @xmath128 , @xmath129 and @xmath130 spherical harmonics which follow the same symmetry under rotation . ]      to illustrate the physics of multipolar tensor operators , let us focus on the spherical harmonics operators for @xmath0 .",
    "in this case , we have 9 linearly independent tensor operators as shown in fig.4 .",
    "we also display the shapes of @xmath92 , @xmath131 and @xmath19 spherical harmonics functions to represent their analogy .",
    "because the rotational properties of those tensor operators are the same as the original spherical harmonics , we can `` visualize '' these matrices by this way .",
    "let us discuss the scalar term first .",
    "the scalar term is exactly an identity matrix , and since the identity is invariant under rotations , it always looks the same under any rotation as the @xmath92orbital .",
    "an important feature of the scalar term is its relation to the total charge .",
    "if we expand the density matrix @xmath132 , the total charge of the system is proportional to the coefficient @xmath133 . as for the dipole terms ,",
    "the matrices are no longer unchanged under rotation : @xmath134 and @xmath135 describe time  reversed transition processes which change a single quantum of the angular momentum .",
    "@xmath94 is another diagonal matrix which induces no change of moment .",
    "similar descriptions also hold for quadrupoles : @xmath136 and @xmath137 change two moment quanta ; @xmath138 and @xmath139 change one moment quantum ; @xmath140 changes no moment .",
    "although @xmath141 and @xmath142 both change one moment quantum , they are essentially different .",
    "notice that the non  zero matrix elements of @xmath142 have a sign difference but @xmath143 have no such term .",
    "if single quantum transition channels are in  phase , it is a dipole ; if they are out  of  phase , it is a quadrupole .",
    "similar analysis can be applied to other super bases . a diagrammatic interpretation of the dipole  dipole and quadrupole ",
    "quadrupole rkky exchange interactions is shown in fig.5 .",
    "interacts with a @xmath0 local moment , induces a @xmath144 ( @xmath145 ) transition and leaves with momentum @xmath14 inducing a @xmath93 ( @xmath146 ) transition on a neighboring site .",
    "the blue transition arrow for @xmath145 means a negative phase compared to the red one . ]",
    "here we introduce an efficient method to calculate the coupling matrix of a multipolar exchange interaction using total energy electronic structure calculation , such as lda or lda+u @xcite .",
    "the discussion is based on a specific total moment @xmath39 , therefore labeling by @xmath39 will be omitted .",
    "consider a multipolar exchange interaction within the mean  field approximation , and the ground state energy @xmath147 : @xmath148the formula for the ground state energy is exactly the classical version of the multipolar exchange interaction . in this case , the multipolar moments are no longer quantized and can vary continuously . if we introduce variations for a particular pair of multipoles at different sites : @xmath149plug them into the formula for @xmath147 , we obtain : @xmath150and @xmath151where @xmath152 is the new energy associated with a variation @xmath153 of @xmath154 multipole .",
    "therefore , in order to calculate a multipolar exchange constant we need to obtain three energies : the energy cost of making a variation on site @xmath42 , the energy cost of making a variation on site @xmath45 and the energy cost of making the same variations on both sites .",
    "if the multipoles @xmath155 and @xmath156 are not coupled , the energy cost of varying both will be simply the sum of two independent variations on each site .",
    "however , if they are coupled , varying both sites simultaneously will induce an extra exchange energy which is proportional to the exchange constant as shown in fig.6 .",
    "therefore , if one can compute these energies using advanced electronic structure calculation , one is able to obtain the effective exchange interaction .",
    "another issue is how to perform a variation on the multipoles in a realistic calculation . to answer this question",
    ", we have to use the trace inner product theorem .",
    "consider the local density matrices of each correlated site .",
    "the local density matrices can be expanded by a super basis defined on that site : @xmath157 .",
    "we intentionally choose a super basis where all the tensor operators are hermitian , @xmath47 , cubic harmonics , so we also have : @xmath158=tr[\\rho t_{k_{i}}^{\\dagger q_{i}}]=\\alpha _ { k_{i}}^{q_{i}}$ ] .",
    "it means @xmath159 is essentially @xmath160 .",
    "therefore , we can vary a multipole by changing its corresponding expansion coefficient .     to represent the multipoles . ]",
    "when mapping the exchange model hamiltonian to a series of total energy calculations using our method , it is necessary to make sure the total energies only contain the contributions from exchange interactions .",
    "this is not very straightforward .",
    "recall that , in @xmath9 heisenberg model , we relate the exchange constants to the new total energy of the meta  stable state with one or more spin moments flipped .",
    "therefore when calculating the total energy , one should not perform any self  consistent calculation of the tensor flipped configuration else the system may evolve and go back to its ground state . to avoid the latter",
    ", we use the anderson force theoremaf-1 and read the band energy differences only , @xmath17 the energies associated with occupied single  particle states .",
    "we also apply several constraints on the variations : 1 ) keep the total charge conserved ; 2 ) keep the symmetry to avoid crystal field effects ; 3 ) keep the magnitude of the multipolar moments fixed ; 4 ) enforce the hermitianness  of the density matrix . combining these constraints ,",
    "the only possible choice is to add a phase on the expansion coefficients @xmath161 of the density matrix @xmath162 and the simplest one is a minus sign : @xmath163 . when this is done , @xmath164 .",
    "this is similar to the way we calculate the exchange constants in conventional @xmath9 heisenberg model , _ i.e. _ relating the exchange constants to the energy cost of flipping a spin moment ( changing the sign of the @xmath86axis spin projection ) .    however , the term flip  has a different meaning in the language of multipolar exchange interactions from the case of @xmath9 . in the conventional @xmath9 heisenberg model ,",
    "a `` flip '' means the flipping of the local axis of a spin moment . for most multipoles ,",
    "such a flip is meaningless because it generates no change .",
    "instead , the most general concept of a `` flip '' is to put a minus sign on their expansion coefficients or , equivalently , flip their phase ( a @xmath62 phase gives us @xmath165 ) . in fig.7 , we show the pictures of a phase flip \" for cubic harmonics tensor operators via changing the sign on their corresponding functions . for dipoles , it is indeed equivalent to flipping its local axes .",
    "however , for quadrupoles , a phase flip of @xmath119 , @xmath120 , @xmath121 and @xmath166 is actually a @xmath167 rotation along different axes , and for @xmath168 , it can not be characterized as a rotation .",
    "therefore , when we say antiferromagnetic  @xmath120",
    "quadrupolar ordering , it actually means the @xmath120 quadrupoles are ordered by a @xmath167 rotation alternatively@xcite or , more precisely , by a @xmath169 phase change .",
    "now , we summarize how to calculate the exchange constants using the pair  flip technique : 1 ) calculate the ground state of the system using advanced electronic structure calculation , such as lda or lda+u .",
    "2 ) generate an appropriate super basis that is consistent with the symmetry of the system .",
    "3 ) expand the local density matrices of the magnetic orbitals in this super basis .",
    "4 ) pick a pair of tensor components on different sites , flip their phases separately and simultaneously , recombine them into new local density matrices ( make sure they are still hermitian ) and calculate their corresponding band energies ( making sure not to do any self  consistent calculation on these meta  stable states ) .",
    "6 ) read the band energies and calculate the exchange coefficients .",
    ", it is a @xmath170 rotation along the @xmath171 axis . for @xmath168",
    ", it does not correspond to any rotation .",
    "only dipoles fit the concept of flipping their axes . ]",
    "to test our method , we use uranium dioxide ( uo@xmath172 ) as a benchmark material due to the presence of dipolar and quadrupolar order in its ground state .",

    "it makes @xmath5 a good choice to test our method , as it is a minimal challenge beyond @xmath9 heisenberg model .    as discussed in the previous sections , the description of a spin ",
    "orbit coupled @xmath0 system requires the existence of dipolar and quadrupolar moments .",
    "it is commonly believed that there are two major mechanisms to induce exchange coupling in this system : 1 ) superexchange ( se ) , and 2 ) spin  lattice interaction ( sl ) .",
    "the former contributes to both dipole and quadrupole and the latter contributes to quadrupole only due to the symmetry of structural lattice distortion .",
    "the dominance of se or sl in affecting the quadrupole exchange remains a controversial issue @xcite . since our method",
    "is based on a static electronic structure calculation , we do not explore dynamical effects in all their details .",

    "orbit coupling and further split into the @xmath176 triplet ground state by crystal fields .",
    "their degeneracy are shown inside the parentheses ]    since @xmath5 is a cubic system , it is natural to take cubic harmonics as our super basis : @xmath184 for rank 0 ; @xmath116 , @xmath117 , @xmath118 for rank @xmath185 ( dipole ) ; @xmath119 , @xmath120 , @xmath121 , @xmath186 , @xmath168 for rank @xmath187 ( quadrupole ) @xcite .",

    "3@xmath21 ordering requires the four @xmath23 sublattice moments to point in inequivalent @xmath193 directions , which means the @xmath123 states are defined in different local coordinates for each @xmath23 sublattice @xcite .",
    "thus , we need to make a rotation on each site to ensure everything is in a global coordinate system .    in the local coordinate system ,",
    "the expansion of density matrices has the same tensor expansion coefficients : @xmath194when converting to global coordinate system , one has to apply a rotation matrix @xmath195 using different euler angles @xmath196 for each site . then non  vanishing components of the ground state 3@xmath21 quadrupolar order are @xmath92 , @xmath171 , @xmath197 , @xmath86 , @xmath198 , @xmath199 and @xmath200 .",

    "there are four equivalent bonds for a pair of uranium sites @xmath205 , so to eliminate double counting one should also divide the obtained exchange energies by 4 as well as account for any geometric or trigonometric factors due to the non - collinear order .",
    "since @xmath206 ground state is defined in the pseudospin @xmath0 space , we shall introduce the reduced density matrix ( rdm ) as a useful single  particle approximation to make it compatible with the single  particle based electronic structure calculation . however the self  consistent ground state of the @xmath5 may be close to but not equal to the rdms of the prefect @xmath207 state , so we keep all the calculated results unchanged but replace the local density matrices of the correlated orbitals by prefect @xmath208 rdms to make our system a well  defined @xmath209 problem .",

    "the major difference is the disappearance of anti  crossing at a few @xmath268points and much larger anisotropy ( gap ) at the @xmath269point .",
