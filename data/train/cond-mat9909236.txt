    "one of the questions which ought to be addressed before performing a large scale computer simulation is `` what are suitable weight factors for the problem at hand ? '' since the 1970s it has been expert wisdom that monte carlo ( mc ) simulations with a - priori unknown weight factors are feasible and deserve to be considered @xcite . with focus on narrow classes of applications , this idea was occasionally re - discovered , for instance @xcite . with the work of ref.@xcite it became a more widely accepted idea , which is employed for an increasing number of applications in physics , chemistry , structural biology and other areas  @xcite .    in 1988",
    "the italian ape collaboration  @xcite raised the question whether the @xmath1 deconfining phase transition in lattice gauge theory is really of first order , as everyone believed , or possible of second order .",
    "the first order nature of the transition was ultimately confirmed and in our context it is only of interest that it was this question which triggered the theoretical high energy physics community to perform a number of numerical precision studies of first order phase transitions . in particular difficulties to calculate the interfacial tension were noted , as is reflected in the papers by potvin and rebbi  @xcite , as well as kajantie et al .",
    "@xcite , where new methods were introduced and tested for the denotes the dimension of the considered system . ]",
    "@xmath2 @xmath3-state potts model ( and later applied to @xmath1 lattice gauge theory ) .",
    "the author of this review was involved in a number of studies of the @xmath1 deconfining transitions , which cumulated in ref.@xcite with systematic applications and developments of re - weighting techniques  @xcite for @xmath1 gauge theory . in this context the papers with neuhaus  @xcite originated where we introduced the _",
    "multicanonical _ method and succeeded for the @xmath2 10-state potts model to get accurate interface tension estimates out of binder s  @xcite histogram technique . looking back , it is to some extent astonishing that we did not realize immediately the connection with torrie and valeau s  @xcite _ umbrella sampling _ techniques .",
    "however , binder s histogram method ( known to us by personal contacts ) was by then ten years old and more or less dormant due to the problem of supercritical slowing down discussed below .",
    "it was just not a natural idea to search the literature under the assumption that everyone may have overlooked an existing numerical method that gets it working .",
    "the umbrella method had stayed confined to small expert circles .",
    "the major reason for this was , most likely , that non - experts could never figure out how to get the _ a - priori _ unknown weight factors in the first place .",
    "with respect to this point the multicanonical papers initiated progress beyond simply making the method popular .",
    "we are here concerned with mc simulations of the gibbs canonical ensemble , see the next section for preliminaries .",
    "multicanonical simulations calculate canonical expectation values in a temperature range , whereas conventional canonical simulations  @xcite calculate at a fixed temperature @xmath4 and can , by re - weighting techniques , only be extrapolated to a vicinity of this temperature .",
    "interest into re - weighting techniques , an idea which can be traced back to the late 1950 s  @xcite , exploded with the paper by ferrenberg and swendsen  @xcite .",
    "apparently , the time was then right for the radical step of transgressing entirely beyond conventional , canonical mc simulations .",
    "still , a lucky accident helped the rapid acceptance of the multicanonical method .",
    "namely , for the @xmath2 7-state potts model ref .",
    "@xcite had produced interface tension estimates which were by an entire order of magnitude larger than the multicanonical estimates  @xcite for the same model .",
    "normally , such numerical discrepancies are difficult to resolve .",
    "however , for the @xmath2 @xmath5-state potts model a miracle happened : building on results of  @xcite the _ exact _",
    "@xmath2 potts model interface tensions were derived  @xcite shortly after the simulations were completed . the exact results and the multicanonical estimates",
    "were found to be in excellent agreement and the previous controversy converted to a significant boost for the new method .    in the application to calculations of interface tensions",
    "the emphasis is on enhancing rare configurations .",
    "canonical mc simulations  @xcite sample configurations @xmath6 with the boltzmann weights @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the energy of configuration @xmath6 , @xmath9 and units are chosen such that @xmath10 holds for the boltzmann constant .",
    "the resulting probability distribution for the energy is @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the spectral density , _",
    "i.e. _ the number of configurations of energy @xmath13 .",
    "the normalization constant @xmath14 is needed to ensure @xmath15 .",
    "let @xmath16 characterize the lattice size ( for instance @xmath17 spins ) . for first order phase transitions",
    "pseudocritical points @xmath18 exist such that the energy distributions @xmath19 become double peaked and @xmath20 can be chosen such that the maxima at @xmath21 are of equal height @xmath22 . in - between these values a minimum is located at some energy @xmath23 .",
    "configurations at @xmath23 are exponentially suppressed like @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the interface tension and @xmath26 is the minimal area between the phases , @xmath27 for an @xmath28 lattice , @xmath29 and @xmath30 are constants , @xmath31 in the capillary - wave approximation  @xcite . to determine the interface tension one has to calculate the quantities @xmath32 and make a finite size scaling ( fss ) extrapolation of @xmath33 for @xmath34 .",
    "however , for large systems a canonical mc simulation  ( [ pcanonical ] ) will practically never visit configurations at energy @xmath35 and estimates of the ratio @xmath36 will be very inaccurate .",
    "the terminology _ supercritical slowing down _ was coined to characterize such an exponential deterioration of simulation results with lattice size . ref .",
    "@xcite overcame this problem by sampling , in an appropriate energy range , with an _ approximation _",
    "@xmath37 to the weights @xmath38 here the function @xmath39 is the _ microcanonical temperature _ at energy @xmath13 and @xmath40 is some kind of fugacity . whereas approximations to the weight factors ) with the inverse spectral density was given in  @xcite . ]",
    "@xmath41 were already used in umbrella sampling @xcite , the parameterization ( [ wmuca ] ) in terms of the microcanonical temperature @xmath39 was introduced in  @xcite and is typical for the multicanonical approach . the function @xmath42 has a relatively smooth dependence on its arguments which makes it a very useful quantity when dealing with the weight factors .    with an approximation @xmath43 to the weights ( [ wspectral ] ) one samples instead of the canonical energy distribution @xmath44 a new multicanonical distribution @xmath45 the desired canonical distribution ( [ pcanonical ] ) is obtained by re - weighting @xmath46",
    "this relation is rigorous , because the weights @xmath47 used in the actual simulation are exactly known . with the approximate relation ( [ pmuca ] )",
    "the average number of configurations sampled does not longer depend strongly on the energy and accurate estimates of the ratio ( [ itension ] ) @xmath48 become possible .",
    "namely for @xmath49 the equation @xmath50 holds and the statistical errors are those of the ratio @xmath51 times the exactly known factor .",
    "the errors of @xmath52 do not suffer from supercritical slowing down , because in the multicanonical simulation @xmath23 is about as frequently visited as @xmath53 or @xmath54 .",
    "the attentive non - expert will raise the objection that the argument appears to be circular .",
    "the weights ( [ wspectral ] ) are _ a - priori _ unknown and would they be known we could choose @xmath55 and have @xmath56 , _",
    "i.e. _ there is no need anymore to perform a simulation as @xmath36 of equation ( [ ratio ] ) is then exactly known .",
    "the answer to this is that the multicanonical method consists of two steps    1 .",
    "obtain a _ working estimate _ @xmath57 of the weights @xmath58 .",
    "working estimate means that the approximation to ( [ wspectral ] ) has to be good enough to ensure movement in the desired energy range , but deviations of @xmath59 from the constant behavior ( [ pmuca ] ) by a factor of , say , ten are tolerable .",
    "2 .   perform a markov chain mc simulation with the weights @xmath57 .",
    "canonical expectation values are found by re - weighting to the gibbs ensemble and standard jackknife methods @xcite allow reliable error estimates .    for the @xmath2 10-state potts model figure  1",
    "reproduces thus obtained multicanonical and re - weighted canonical energy histograms of ref.@xcite .",
    "the interface tension estimate of ref.@xcite is depicted in figure  2 .",
    "assume a researcher , familiar with the canonical mc method of metropolis et al .",
    "@xcite , likes to get started with multicanonical simulations . for canonical simulation the weights ( [ wcanonical ] ) are exactly known .",
    "the first stumbling block is now to get the weight factors @xmath57 . for small to",
    "medium sized discrete systems my recommendation is to implement the general purpose recursion  @xcite which is discussed in section  3 . for first order phase transitions",
    "an alternative is to rely on the fss scaling behavior of the energy distribution , see section  5 . for large enough systems this approach has advantages , but its applicability is limited to systems for which a fss theory of @xmath44 exist . some people recommend constrained microcanonical mc simulations , which are also shortly sketched at the end of section  5 .",
    "once the weights @xmath57 are fixed the simulation is done by markov chain mc in the usual way .",
    "the second complication , which is minor compared to the first , is that canonical expectation values of physical observables are no longer simple arithmetic averages of the generated ( `` measured '' ) values , but more involved equations have to be employed .",
    "this expands the programming efforts , but causes no real difficulties .",
    "there is a major award for this additional work : multicanonical simulations allow for immediate estimates of the _ free energy _ and the _ entropy _ , whereas their reconstruction from results of canonical simulations requires tedious integration techniques .",
    "these issues are reviewed in the next section .",
    "general properties of the method are discussed in section  4 .",
    "this includes a discussion of its slowing down , _",
    "static _ and _ dynamic _ aspects of the algorithm , and a summary of papers which have reported variants and new progress .",
    "in addition two related methods are sketched : _ parallel tempering _ and",
    "_ random walk algorithms_. we then turn to applications in the next sections .    for first order phase transitions",
    "the multicanonical method is now well - established and a number of applications are summarized in section  5 .",
    "next , it has been realized early  @xcite that multicanonical simulations do not only allow to enhance the weights of relevant rare configurations , but can also be employed to improve the dynamics of the markov process , _ i.e. _ its movement through configuration space in the presence of free energy barriers . equation ( [ pmin ] ) is a particularly simple example of an explicitly controlled free energy barrier . of major interest in nowadays research",
    "are complex systems , characterized by a rough free energy landscape for which an explicit parameterization is not known .",
    "the most important complex systems are presumably proteins for which multicanonical investigations have been pioneered by hansmann and okamoto  @xcite .",
    "applications of the multicanonical method to these systems are summarized in section  6 .",
    "the lack of explicit parameterizations of the free energy barriers makes complex systems difficult to study . for simulations",
    "one has in principle two strategies :    1 .",
    "enhance the suppressed configurations and move over the barriers .",
    "2 .   move around the barriers .",
    "only the first strategy allows for an explicit calculation of barrier heights , because in the second configurations with barriers are still not sampled .",
    "it is with respect to the second strategy , but not the first , that the multicanonical approach is in competition with the method of multiple markov chains  @xcite ( see _ parallel tempering _ in section  4 ) .",
    "the canonical weights are not changed in the latter method , configurations which are rare in the gibbs ensemble ( for instance configurations with interfaces ) stay rare and the strength of the two methods can be quite distinct , although a considerable overlap in the range of potential applications exists .",
    "finally , conclusions and outlook are given in section  7 .",
    "mc simulations of systems described by the gibbs canonical ensemble aim at calculating estimators of physical observables @xmath60 . for discrete systems",
    "( on a computer all systems are discrete ) the expectations values at temperature @xmath9 are defined by @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the _ partition function_. the sum @xmath63 goes over all configurations ( or microstates ) of the system and @xmath8 is the energy of microstate @xmath6 .",
    "here we focus our discussion on generalized potts models in an external magnetic field on @xmath0-dimensional hypercubic lattices . without being overly complicated ,",
    "these models are general enough to illustrate the essential features we are interested in .",
    "in addition , various subcases of these models are by themselves of considerable physical interest .",
    "conceptual generalizations to other models are straightforward , but technical complications arise in some cases .    for generalized potts models",
    "the energy of the system is given by @xmath64 where @xmath65 and @xmath66 in equation ( [ e0 ] ) the sum @xmath67 is over the nearest neighbour lattice sites and @xmath68 is the state of configuration @xmath6 at site @xmath69 .",
    "for the @xmath5-state potts model @xmath70 takes on the values @xmath71 .",
    "the @xmath72 , @xmath73 functions denote exchange coupling constants between the states at site @xmath69 and site  @xmath74 . for @xmath75",
    "the original potts model is recovered and @xmath76 becomes equivalent to the ising ferromagnet .",
    "potts glasses  @xcite and ising spin glasses  @xcite are obtained when the exchange constants are quenched random variables .",
    "other choices of the @xmath77 include anti - ferromagnets and the fully frustrated ising model  @xcite .",
    "the sum in equation ( [ m ] ) goes over all @xmath78 sites @xmath69 of the lattice .",
    "the external magnetic field is chosen to interact with the state @xmath79 at each site @xmath69 , but not with the other states . each configuration ( microstate of the system ) @xmath6 defines a particular arrangements of all states at the sites and , vice versa , each arrangement of the states at the sites determines uniquely a configuration : @xmath80 as there are @xmath5 possible states at each site , the total number of microstates is @xmath81 where we have used the definition ( [ z ] ) of @xmath82 . already for moderately sized systems",
    "@xmath83 is an enormously large number . if @xmath84 , @xmath85 are the edge lengths of the lattice , the number of sites is given by @xmath86 _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath17 for a symmetric lattice with @xmath87 .",
    "it was first proven in  @xcite that the procedure ( [ p_transition ] ) generates configurations @xmath6 with the desired weights @xmath95 provided the property of _ ergodicity _ holds : every configurations has to be reachable in a finite number of steps .    for generalized potts models implementation of the metropolis algorithm",
    "is straightforward .",
    "the transition matrix @xmath96 can be defined by the following procedure    1 .",
    "pick one site @xmath69 at random , _",
    "i.e. _ with probability @xmath97 .",
    "2 .   assign one of the states @xmath98 to @xmath99 , each with probability @xmath100 .",
    "these rules account for @xmath101 the new configuration @xmath89 is then accepted or rejected according to the rule ( [ paccept ] ) .",
    "ergodicity is fulfilled , because with ( [ potts_p0 ] ) every configuration can be reached in a minimum number of @xmath78 update steps .",
    "the random choice of a site insures detailed balance . a similar procedure where states are updated in the systematic order of a permutation @xmath102 leads still to the desired distribution .",
    "although detailed balance is then violated the weaker condition of balance still holds .",
    "the metropolis process needs to run some while to establish _ equilibrium _ with respect to the _ ensemble _ defined by the weights with which it samples , see for instance  @xcite for an introduction and _ coupling from the past _",
    "@xcite is a recent rigorous approach . in the following",
    "we assume that equilibrium has been reached .",
    "subsequently the metropolis process generates a number of equilibrium configurations @xmath103 , @xmath104 on which observables @xmath60 are _ measured _ similarly as in real experiments .",
    "let us focus on the internal energy @xmath13 .",
    "when boltzmann weights @xmath105 ( [ wcanonical ] ) are used the metropolis process generates @xmath106 values in the canonical ensemble and the estimator @xmath107 of @xmath108 in  ( [ o ] ) is simply the arithmetic average @xmath109 when other weights are used this is no longer true .",
    "after equilibrium is reached , a metropolis process with the weights @xmath57 ( [ wmuca ] ) will generate configurations in the _",
    "multicanonical ensemble_. to obtain estimators of canonical expectation values ( [ o ] ) one has to re - weight to the canonical ensemble and equation ( [ overlineecanonical ] ) becomes @xmath110 it is instructive to compare the histograms @xmath111 , @xmath112 of two canonical simulations ( @xmath113 with the histogram @xmath114 generated by a multicanonical metropolis process .",
    "these histograms are estimators of the corresponding probability densities @xmath44 ( [ pcanonical ] ) and @xmath115 ( [ pmuca ] ) . a typical situation is depicted in figure  3 .",
    "histograms from canonical simulations at sufficiently distinct temperatures will not overlap , whereas a histogram from a multicanonical simulation can bridge the entire range and allows to calculate canonical expectation values for the range @xmath116 ( and , in the case depicted , also for some @xmath117 ) .",
    "obviously the re - weighting ( [ overlineemuca ] ) can only work in a temperature range where the multicanonical histogram includes the canonical histogram from a simulation at that temperature .",
    "for insufficient statistics ( or a false choice of multicanonical weights ) the entries from outside the @xmath118 range may lead to spurious estimates of @xmath119 ( [ overlineemuca ] ) .",
    "this is an example of a _ bias _ problem . for dealing with such problems the jackknife method ,",
    "see for instance  @xcite , is recommended .",
    "already for the statistical analysis of results from canonical simulations this should really be the method of first choice and as such be taught in introductory books on mc simulations . for multicanonical simulations bias problems",
    "tend to become more subtle and the use of jackknife estimators becomes often a must .",
    "it is well - known  @xcite that a canonical mc simulation at temperature @xmath9 provides estimates for many but not all thermodynamical quantities of interest .",
    "obtained are estimators for the internal energy @xmath13 , quantities related to its derivatives , like the specific heat @xmath120 correlation functions , the magnetization and many others . however",
    ", canonical simulations fails with respect to a number of important quantities , most prominently the partition function @xmath121 itself and , related to it , for the helmholtz free energy @xmath122 and the entropy @xmath123 the reason is that the histograms @xmath124 of canonical sampling yield the shape of the probability density @xmath44 but do not estimate the normalization constant @xmath14 ( [ pcanonical ] ) which , due to @xmath125 , is @xmath126 instead the normalization constant for the generated histogram is simply the inverse ( arbitrary ) number of generated configurations .",
    "in contrast to this multicanonical simulations allow to calculate @xmath127 by exploiting that @xmath128 is known ( [ k ] ) .",
    "after the multicanonical simulation the estimator for the canonical probability density ( [ reweight ] ) is @xmath129 where the superscript @xmath130 on @xmath131 indicates that this is the constant needed when using the histogram which relies on @xmath132 configurations generated in the multicanonical ensemble .",
    "assume that the @xmath133-range for which re - weighting is valid includes @xmath134 .",
    "the constant @xmath131 follows then from the known result @xmath135 .",
    "once @xmath131 is known @xmath14 ( and hence the partition function ) follows from the normalization @xmath136 , where @xmath133 has of course to stay in the admissible re - weighting range .",
    "in this section a recursion  @xcite is presented which allows to obtain working estimates @xmath137 of the weight factors ( [ wspectral ] ) .",
    "essentially , it is a simplified and improved version of a recursion which was first published in  @xcite after being extensively tested in spin glass simulations  @xcite .    it is recommended to start the recursion in the disordered phase of a system , where the system moves freely under mc updates .",
    "the _ zeroth _ simulation is done with the weights @xmath138 the most obvious recursion towards the weights ( [ wspectral ] ) goes as follows : simulation @xmath132 , @xmath139 is carried out with the estimate @xmath140 and yields the histogram @xmath141 .",

    "a number of papers have reported further progress along the lines of multicanonical algorithms . for asymmetric distributions borgs and kappler  @xcite suggest to use an equal weight instead of the equal height criterium employed in equation  ( [ itension ] ) .",
    "hesselbo and stinchcombe  @xcite made an attempt to optimize the weights and propose @xmath215 instead of ( [ wspectral ] ) .",
    "their arguments cover the static situation ( pertinence ) , but as one has no _ a - priori _ control over the dynamics of the systems , the question of optimal weights remains one of trial and error .",
    "combining multicanonical with multigrid methods has been explored by janke and sauer  @xcite . for molecular dynamics , langevin and hybrid mc variants",
    "see hansmann et al .",
    "@xcite and , with emphasize on lattice gauge theory , arnold et al .",
    "connections with adaption and linear response theory were explored in  @xcite and optimization of estimators is discussed in  @xcite . occasionally attempts have been made to use bivariate multicanonical weighting  @xcite , with most spectacular results claimed recently  @xcite .",
    "concerning the latter reference , it appears to be too early for a final judgement . in general numerical methods",
    "tend to become unstable when the parameter space becomes too big .",
    "the developments sketched above have to be distinguished from the the _ parallel tempering _ approach which is for some applications the major competing method and should by no means be confused with multicanonical sampling .",
    "the first paper on parallel tempering is due to geyer  @xcite who introduces it as the method of multiple markov chains .",
    "independently it was developed in other papers .",
    "the _ method of expanded ensembles _ was introduced by lyubartsev et al .",
    "@xcite and proposes to enlarge the configuration space by introducing new dynamical variables .",
    "the better known _ simulated tempering _  @xcite method of marinari and parisi can be considered as the special case where the temperature becomes the new dynamical variable .",
    "building on simulated tempering the method of _ parallel tempering _ was introduced and tested by hukusima and nemoto  @xcite .",
    "it is identical with geyer s  @xcite proposal and well suited for clusters of workstations and massively parallel computer architectures ( although a moderately fast network between the nodes is sufficient ) .",
    "parallel tempering performs @xmath132 canonical mc simulations at different @xmath133-values with boltzmann weight factors @xmath216 and allows exchange of neighbouring @xmath133-values @xmath217 these transitions lead to the energy change @xmath218 which is accepted or rejected according to the metropolis algorithm .",
    "the @xmath219-values have to be determined such that a reasonably large acceptance rate is obtained for the @xmath133 exchange ( [ del_beta_pt ] ) and ref.@xcite employs a recursive method due to kerler and rehberg  @xcite .",
    "this is similar to the recursion needed at the beginning of a multicanonical simulation .    _",
    "remark : _ the method works for dynamical but not for statical supercritical slowing down .",
    "each member of the discrete set of weight factors samples still a boltzmann distribution ( _ e.g. _ it is not a valid method for calculating interfacial tensions ) .      in ref.@xcite",
    "a class of algorithms was designed to perform a random walk in the energy ( or any other function of the microstates ) .",
    "assume the metropolis proposal probabilities @xmath96 ( [ p0 ] ) are defined which allow for @xmath220 moves out of configuration @xmath6 ( for the generalized potts model probabilities ( [ potts_p0 ] ) we have @xmath221 independently of @xmath6 ) .",
    "we may divide the @xmath220 moves into three classes : @xmath222 with    1 .   @xmath223",

    "the observation of  @xcite is that it is easy to define transition probabilities @xmath232 , @xmath233 and @xmath234 , @xmath235 such that @xmath236 holds ( but at the extrema ) . for any such choice the algorithm performs ( away from the extrema ) a random walk in the energy and , hence , samples a broad energy distribution",
    ".    in @xcite configuration dependent transition probabilities @xmath237 were used , where the dependence on the configurations @xmath6 exceeds a mere energy dependence .",
    "the algorithm sacrifices then an exact relationship with the canonical ensemble in favor of having a - priori well - defined defined transition probabilities and was conjectured to be of interest for optimization problems , where one focuses on minima and not in the canonical ensemble . with this in mind",
    "the name _ random cost algorithm _ was chosen in  @xcite .",
    "wang s  @xcite recent random walk algorithm is a special case of equations  ( [ rwa ] ) , but uses microcanonical averages @xmath238 the configuration dependence ( [ pk ] ) is then reduced to energy dependence and canonical expectation values can be recovered by using the equation @xmath239 where @xmath240 is the microcanonical average for the number of transitions from configurations with energy @xmath13 to configurations with energy @xmath241 . for proofs of  ( [ sp_eqn ] )",
    "see the appendix of  @xcite or ref.@xcite .",
    "it seems  @xcite that in the random walk mc the use of estimators for @xmath240 instead of their unknown exact values faces more serious problems than in multicanonical simulations .",
    "therefore , the best application of equation ( [ sp_eqn ] ) might be to employ it as input in the iteration towards the multicanonical weights ( [ wmuca ] ) .",
    "such a use of transition probabilities was first proposed by smith and bruce  @xcite and apparently deserves renewed attention .",
    "multicanonical simulations are best established for investigations of first - order phase transitions .",
    "the range of applications goes from studies of mathematically ambitious topics to chemistry oriented ones .",
    "for instance an investigation  @xcite of the mathematically rigorous borgs - koteck  @xcite fss theory reveals that very strong phase transitions or very large lattices are needed to observe the asymptotic behavior predicted by their theory . to give two examples from the chemistry side ,",
    "an investigation of the coexistence curve of the lennard - jones fluid was performed in ref.@xcite and liquid - vapor transitions in fluids were studied in ref.@xcite .",
    "the lennard - jones fluid has also been a major field of applications for the original umbrella sampling method and variants thereof  @xcite .",
    "a lot of work has focused on calculations of interfacial tensions and an overview is given in the forthcoming .",
    "the pioneering study was performed for the @xmath2 10-state potts model  @xcite and @xmath242 was found through fss study of the equation ( [ itension ] ) . only afterwards the exact value was discovered to be @xmath243  @xcite .",
    "once , the exact result was known , the remaining , small discrepancy could be eliminated by improving the finite volume estimators  @xcite . for these simulations",
    "the slowing down is around @xmath244 , _",
    "i.e. _ reasonably close to the optimal performance . for a related investigation of the 7-state @xmath2 potts model",
    "see  @xcite .",
    "many real physical systems fall into the universality class of the @xmath245 ising model . despite its simplicity",
    ", it is therefore a very rewarding object to study . although many of its universal parameters have already been determined with high precision , others are still in the making .",
    "in particular , there has been interest in the universal surface tension and the critical - isotherm amplitude ratios  @xcite . to obtain them",
    ", one needs accurate interfacial tension results below the curie temperature and multimagnetical simulations  @xcite have become the enabling technique for binder s  @xcite histogram method , which was originally proposed in this context .    for the @xmath2 ising model onsager s exact result was reproduced with good accuracy  @xcite .",
    "however , for the @xmath245 model the temperature dependence of the interfacial tension  @xcite has , unfortunately , come out erratic .",
    "therefore , the results of ref.@xcite appear to be the up - to - date best estimates .",
    "considerable technical improvements of multimagnetical calculations are nowadays feasible and it seems worthwhile to start off a new multimagnetical @xmath245 ising model simulation .",
    "one is interested in the interfacial tension for the confinement / deconfinement phase transition .",
    "the use of multicanonical techniques has been explored by grossmann , laursen et al .",
    "in particular , they noticed that it is suitable to use an asymmetric lattice , @xmath246 with @xmath247 .",
    "this forces the interfaces into the @xmath248 plane and ensures a flat region for the minimum of equation ( [ pmin ] ) , thus greatly facilitating the extraction of finite - lattice values for the interfacial tension and , consequently , the fss analysis .    for @xmath1 gauge theory the interfacial tension",
    "is usually denoted by the symbol @xmath249 and estimates are conveniently given as multiples of @xmath250 , where @xmath251 is the deconfinement temperature .",
    "using the conventions of @xcite , the estimates of  @xcite are @xmath252 this may be compared with the later estimate by iwasaki et al .",
    "@xcite @xmath253 the discrepancy ( only @xmath254 can be compared ) is presumably due to too small lattice sizes in  @xcite .",
    "physically , one is interested in the @xmath255 limit .",
    "possibly the strong @xmath256 dependence can be eliminated by using tadpole improved actions for which beinlich et al .",
    "@xcite report @xmath257      baryon violating processes are unsuppressed for @xmath258 , where @xmath251 is the electroweak critical temperature .",
    "it has been conjectured , that this may allow to explain the baryon asymmetry in nature .",
    "models tie the nucleation rate to the interface tension of the transition . using an effective scalar field theory  @xcite or the full theory  @xcite",
    ", multicanonical and related techniques turn out to be useful for simulations at a higgs mass @xmath259 where one deals with a relatively strong first - order transitions , as needed to explain the baryon asymmetry . unfortunately , it turn out that the transition weakens for higher higgs masses , see ref.@xcite for a concise review .      for spin systems with first - order phase transitions",
    "the fss behavior is relatively well - known .",
    "provided the steps between system sizes are not too large , it is then possible to get working estimates of the @xmath47 weights by means of a fss extrapolation from the already simulated smaller systems @xcite .",
    "another method which works for these systems is patching of overlapping , constraint @xcite mc simulations .",
    "this has been employed by various groups , but documentation has remained sketchy , presumably it is best in  @xcite .",
    "it should be emphasized that the purpose of the constrained mc simulations is here to get a working estimate of the multicanonical weights , whereas in  @xcite they were used for final estimates of physical observables .",
    "the advantage of the multicanonical simulation is that it has not the ergodicity problems from which microcanonical and constraint mc simulations tend to suffer .",
    "while these approaches work for first order phase transitions , they fail as soon as ergodicity problems become severe what is normally the case for complex systems .",
    "then it is necessary to employ a recursion like the one of section  3 , which is a convenient choice for first order transitions too .",
    "soon after the introduction of multicanonical methods , their potential relevance for investigations of spin glasses and other complex systems was pointed out  @xcite . in these systems",
    "one encounters large free energy barriers due to disorder and frustrations .",
    "multicanonical simulations try to overcome the barriers through excursions into the disordered phase .",
    "examples are spin glasses , proteins , hard optimization problems and others .    for an efficient application of the multicanonical idea one needs some some physical insight : the configurations of interest have to be identified and a suitable parameterization has to be found which allows their actual enhancement . whereas for first order phase transition the appropriate parameters ( temperature , magnetization , etc . )",
    "are quite obvious , it is a major open problem whether suitable parameters exist for classes of complex systems .",
    "multicanonical studies have so far been limited to the simplest , realistic prototypes , the @xmath2 and @xmath245 edwards - anderson @xmath260 ising or @xmath261 in the 2-state potts model notation . ]",
    "spin glass  @xcite .",
    "significant progress has been achieved with respect to groundstate energy _ and _ entropy calculations .",
    "in @xmath245 the groundstate energy and entropy per spin ( @xmath262 and @xmath263 ) estimates of  @xcite are @xmath264 however , on the algorithmic side the slowing down with volumes size is very bad , around @xmath265 or , possibly , exponential .",
    "certain advantages of simulated tempering are claimed in  @xcite and  @xcite , but these studies fail to present comparisons under identical conditions and presently there is no firm evidence that simulated tempering yields a significantly better slowing down .",
    "these studies weight spin glass configurations with the inverse spectral density  ( [ wspectral ] ) . recently",
    "a more focused application of the multicanonical method to spin glass simulations was developed  @xcite .",
    "the idea is to explore the free - energy structure in the parisi order parameter such that the barriers in this variable can be mapped out .",
    "these investigations are in progress .",
    "marinari , parisi and collaborators perform major spin glass simulations using parallel tempering , for a review see  @xcite .",
    "proteins are linear polymers with the 20 naturally occurring amino acids as monomers .",
    "chains smaller than a few tens of amino acids are called peptides .",
    "the problem is to predict the folded conformation of proteins and peptides solely from their amino acid sequence . for many years",
    "the emphasis of numerical investigations has been on finding the global minimum potential energy and the major difficulty encountered is the multiple minima problem .",
    "molecular dynamics has been the numerical method of first choice , but the fraction of stochastic investigations shows an increasing trend",
    ". in particular simulated annealing has been frequently used .",
    "the major advantage of multicanonical and related methods in the context of proteins is that they allow for investigations of the _ thermodynamics _ of the entire free energy landscape of the protein .",
    "this was realized by hansmann and okamoto  @xcite when they introduced multicanonical sampling to the problem of protein folding and , slightly later , by hao and scheraga  @xcite . since",
    "then numerous applications were performed and the simulations have been quite successful for peptides , but face tremendous problems concerning scaling to large systems . a particularly nice example is depicted in figure  5 : the folding of poly - alanine into its @xmath266-helix coil  @xcite .",
    "no _ a - priori _ information about the groundstate conformation is used in these kind of simulations . by",
    "now a quite extensive literature exists which is compiled in  @xcite .",
    "they occur in engineering , network and chip design , traffic control , and many other situations .",
    "general purpose algorithms for their solution are simulated annealing and genetic algorithms .",
    "to those , we may now like to add _ multicanonical annealing _  @xcite and _ random cost _",
    "@xcite .",
    "multicanonical annealing is a combination of multicanonical sampling with variable upper bounds and frequent adaption of parameters .",
    "a promising study  @xcite has been performed for the traveling salesman problem . up to @xmath267 cities ,",
    "randomly distributed in the unit square , were considered and scaling of the path length as function of @xmath78 was investigated .",
    "the reported algorithmic performance is so good , that an independent confirmation would be desireable .",
    "recently the random cost algorithm ( [ rwa ] ) has been applied to topology optimization in the engineering of trusses  @xcite .",
    "the performance was found to be competitive to that of evolutionary ( genetic ) algorithms .",
    "sampling of broad energy distributions allows to overcome supercritical slowing down .",
    "this is well established for first - order phase transitions .",
    "systems with conflicting constraints remain , despite some progress , notoriously difficult and for them most hope lies on achieving further algorithmic improvements . in addition , multicanonical methods may also be of interest when dealing with second order phase transitions , but so far nobody really cared to investigate this direction .",
    "multicanonical simulations have the potential to be replace canonical simulations as the method of first choice for exploratory mc studies .",
    "their major advantage is that they give the thermodynamics for the entire temperature range of interest in one single mc run , whereas several to many ( for each @xmath133-value one ) canonical mc runs are needed .",
    "so far the major stumbling block against using multicanonical simulations in this way has been the lack of easily available implementations of recursion schemes and data analysis programs .",
