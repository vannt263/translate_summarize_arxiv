    "the question of dark matter is presently one of the most pressing open problems in cosmology .",
    "the galaxy rotation curves and mass discrepancy in a cluster of galaxies are two prominent observational evidence for the existence of dark matter . according to newtonian gravity ,",
    "galaxy rotation curves give the velocity of matter rotating in a spiral disk as a function of the distance from the center of a galaxy ; it increases linearly within the galaxy and drops off as the square root of @xmath1 outside the galaxy .",
    "however , observations show that this is not the case and the velocity remains approximately constant .",
    "this provides for the possible existence of a new invisible matter distributed around galaxies which is known as dark matter @xcite .",
    "the mass discrepancy of clusters as another evidence for the existence of dark matter can be understood when estimating the total mass of a cluster in two different ways ; summing the individual member masses within the cluster leads to a total mass which we shall call @xmath2 .",
    "alternatively , the virial theorem applied to a cluster would yield an estimate of the cluster mass which we call @xmath3 . as it turns out , @xmath3 is nearly @xmath4 times greater than @xmath2 and this difference is known as the virial mass discrepancy @xcite . the best way to deal with the above discrepancy",
    ", it seems , is to postulate dark matter .",
    "there are several candidates for dark matter which can be categorized as baryonic or non - baryonic , or , as hot or cold according to their velocity at the time when galaxies were just starting to form .    in spite of many efforts to postulate various forms of matter as dark matter",
    ", there is as yet no non - gravitational evidence for it .",
    "moreover , accelerator and reactor experiments do not support the scenarios in which dark matter emerges .",
    "therefore , one may conclude that einsteins s gravity may break down at the scale of galaxies @xcite .",
    "thus , to deal with the question of dark matter , modifications to einstein field equations @xcite have become a flourishing method in recent years .",
    "one such modification is the brane-@xmath0 gravity .",
    "the idea that our @xmath5-dimensional universe might be a @xmath6-brane embedded in a higher dimensional bulk has its roots in string theory @xcite .",
    "one of the most successful of such higher dimensional models is the randall - sundrum ( rs ) scenario . in the rs scenario ,",
    "our @xmath5-dimensional universe is considered as a brane in a @xmath7-dimensional bulk with an ads geometry @xcite .",
    "the rs model has had a great success in explaining the hierarchy problem .",
    "another noticeable effort in this direction is the model proposed by dvali - gabadadze - porrati ( dgp ) @xcite . in this model the bulk space",
    "is assumed to be flat but there is an additional @xmath8-induced gravity term appearing in the action .",
    "a self accelerating phase at late times is predicted for the universe in this model .",
    "however , the solutions corresponding to the self - accelerating branch suffer from ghost instabilities while the normal branch admits solutions which are ghost - free @xcite .",
    "the dgp model predicts modifications to gravity at large distances while the rs - type models modify gravity at small scales .",
    "brane - world scenarios have paved the way for a new understanding of dark matter @xcite . in a similar vein ,",
    "theories of gravity in which the einstein - hilbert ( eh ) action is replaced with a generic function of @xmath9 , the ricci scalar , have been quite useful in dealing with the question of dark matter @xcite .",
    "it would therefore be of interest to consider a brane-@xmath0 gravity scenario incorporating both the above ideas to deal with the open questions in gravity .",
    "in addition , there are a number of other motivations for such studies .",
    "for example , since brane world scenarios with a generic @xmath0 in a bulk with a single extra dimension can be described by a real scalar field , brane-@xmath0 models have been studied within the framework of scalar - tensor type theories .",
    "such theories have been used to investigate the stabilization of the distance between the branes in the context of the rsi model @xcite and the problem of the cosmological constant @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "brane-@xmath0 type theories have been used to answer questions such as dark energy and the present accelerating phase of the universe @xcite .",
    "the present study could be considered as an attempt to narrow the gap in our understanding of one of the problems facing us in the ever increasing complexities of the inner workings of our universe .",
    "generally speaking , one may start with a generic action involving @xmath0 without a cosmological constant in a rs scenario @xcite in conjunction with the virial theorem in an attempt to account for dark matter . in doing so",
    ", the virial theorem together with observational data relating to the velocity of each member of a cluster , provides an estimate of the mean density and leads to a prediction of the total possible mass .",
    "the virial theorem has also been used in model @xmath0 theories with a cosmological constant @xcite , within the context of brane - world scenarios @xcite , using both the metric @xcite and palatini formalisms @xcite . in this paper",
    "we generalize the virial theorem in a brane-@xmath0 scenario using the collisionless boltzmann equation . in this process",
    ", extra terms will appear in the generalized virial theorem originating from the modified action in the bulk .",
    "the extra terms can be interpreted as a geometric mass and attributed to the mass discrepancy in clusters .",
    "according to recent observations , the tangential velocity of matter moving around the center of a galaxy tends to a constant value as one moves away from the center of the galaxy .",
    "such rotation curves have been studied in the context of brane - world scenarios by using the concept of conformal symmetry @xcite .",
    "we present similar conclusions in a brane-@xmath0 model by using the idea of conformal killing symmetry . in this regard",
    ", the spacetime is assumed to have , in addition to being static and spherically symmetric , a conformal symmetry .",
    "if the vector field @xmath10 is the generator of such conformal symmetry , then the spacetime metric @xmath11 is mapped conformally onto itself along the trajectories of @xmath12 @xmath13 with @xmath14 being the lie derivative and @xmath15 is the conformal factor .",
    "there is a systematic method of searching for exact solutions , initiated by herrera and co - workers @xcite , where the field equations can be obtained in an exact parametric form , with the conformal factor taken as a parameter .",
    "this would provide the possibility of studying the behavior of the angular velocity of a test particle moving in a stable circular orbit .",
    "the tangential velocity can be derived as a function of the conformal factor and some integration constants . at large radial distances ,",
    "we obtain a constant value for the tangential velocity by taking suitable integration constants .",
    "the bending of light is another issue worth studying in this region @xcite .",
    "the computation of the deflection of photons passing through a region of flat rotation curves and their time delay are useful tools for testing the alternative theories of gravity , an example of which is presented in this work .",
    "in order to derive the virial theorem for galaxy clusters , it is necessary to introduce the brane-@xmath0 model we are interested in . we also need to know the boltzmann equation governing the evolution of the distribution function in cluster of galaxies . by taking the cluster of galaxies as a system of identical and collisionless point particles , we utilize the relativistic boltzmann equation together with the field equations to find the generalized virial theorem .      in a brane-@xmath0 model , the @xmath7-dimensional bulk action is taken as @xmath16 } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath17 is the matter lagrangian , @xmath18 is the bulk metric and @xmath9 is the bulk ricci scalar @xcite .",

    "we consider the cluster as an isolated spherically symmetric system described by equation ( [ 9 ] ) .",
    "furthermore , we assume that the galaxies in the cluster behave like identical , collisionless point particles .",
    "the distribution function is denoted by @xmath44 which obeys the general relativistic boltzmann equation .    in many applications , it is convenient to work in an appropriate orthonormal frame or tetrad @xmath60 , where @xmath61 . in the case of the spherically symmetric line element given by equation ( [ 9 ] ) ,",
    "we introduce the frame of orthonormal vectors as @xcite @xmath62 we also note that the tetrad components of @xmath63 can be written as @xmath64 . in tetrad components ,",

    "therefore one can easily approximate the last equation @xmath110 now one may note that some geometric terms appearing in the einstein field equations above could effectively play a role in the gravitational energy . these geometric terms may be attributed to a geometric mass at the galactic or extra galactic levels and may be interpreted as dark matter . on the other hand ,",
    "dark matter is the main contribution of mass in clusters .",
    "it means that the contribution of the baryonic mass is negligible in comparison with dark matter .",
    "the total mass of the cluster can then be estimated as @xmath111 .",
    "we also know that the virial mass is mainly determined by the geometric mass .",
    "it means that the geometric mass could be a potential candidate for the virial mass discrepancy in clusters . as a result",
    ", we conclude that @xmath112 therefore , equation ( [ 38 ] ) can be written as @xmath113 this shows that the virial mass is proportional to the normal baryonic mass in a cluster and the proportionality constant has geometrical origins .",

    "the vacuum solutions obtained here may thus be usefully utilized to account for the flat rotation curves in a region where the contribution of x - matter is dominant .",
    "the observational data show that the rotational velocity increases linearly within the galaxy and approaches a constant value of about @xmath145 as one moves away from the center @xcite . in this section",

    "it is clear that in the case @xmath246 , the deflection angle only originates from baryonic matter . in this particular case",
    ", we have @xmath247 which is consistent with the general relativity prediction .",
    "the effects of dark matter on the deflection angle is shown in fig.[fig2 ] where variation of @xmath238 as a function of @xmath248 is plotted .     for @xmath249 . ]",
    "it is necessary to point out that this result is valid for the region @xmath250 . in general , the point of the closest approach , @xmath241 , can be anywhere .",
    "the time needed for light to travel by a massive celestial body is longer than the same time calculated by newtonian gravity .",
    "this effect originates from the existence of gravitational field in the vicinity of these massive objects and can be detected using a radar echo delay .",
    "such a delay was measured by a method suggested by shapiro @xcite . the time needed for a photon to propagate from one point with @xmath251 , @xmath252 , @xmath253 to another point with @xmath254 , @xmath255 ,",
    "@xmath253 can be obtained by use of geodesic equations @xcite .",
    "the elapsed time for a photon traveling between @xmath241 and @xmath68 is given by @xmath256^{\\frac{-1}{2}}dr , \\label{time}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath241 is the closest approach to the celestial body .    to find the time delay",
    "we suppose that @xmath68 is outside the region formed by the galaxy and @xmath241 is in the region of flat rotation curves .",
    "thus , we split the integral ( [ time ] ) into two parts according to @xmath257^{-1/2}dr \\nonumber\\\\ & + \\int_{r_0}^ r \\frac{1}{1-\\frac{2g_nm}{r}}\\left[1-\\frac{1-\\frac{2g_nm}{r}}{1-\\frac{2g_nm}{r_c } } \\left(\\frac{r_c}{r}\\right)^{2}\\right]^{-1/2 } \\frac{dr}{r},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we can integrate the first term exactly and the second term by using the robertson expansion @xcite to find @xmath258 the term @xmath259 is what we would expect if light traveled in a straight line with unit velocity .",
    "the first term in the above expression is the effect of the flat rotation curves region and the other terms represent the effect of general relativity .",
    "it is clear that in the absence of the region containing the flat rotation curves , @xmath260 , one gets the time delay for general relativity only .",
    "in this work we have considered a brane-@xmath0 model as a possible candidate to explain the question of dark matter .",
    "this was achieved by considering the field equations on the brane obtained through the projection of the field equations in the bulk together with the assumption that our spacetime admits a family of conformal symmetries .",
    "the additional terms thus appearing in this process in the field equations can be considered as a source for dark matter .",
    "we used this procedure to explain the problem of what is known as the flat rotation curves and obtained an expression for the tangential velocity of a test particle moving in such a region , consistent with present observational data .",
    "in addition , the angle representing the deflection of light and the time representing the radar echo delay of photons passing through such a region were calculated .    to look further afield",
    ", one may be interested to investigate the stability of the model and its consistency with parameterized post - newtonian ( ppn ) parameters .",
    "four dimensional @xmath0 gravity models have been considered before in order to study their stability @xcite and ppn parameters @xcite .",
    "this is basically done by investigating weak field limit of the theory involved .",
    "the same route can be taken here , leading to the possibility of direct comparison of predictions of the model with observational data .",
    "the weak field limit would also afford the possibility of obtaining the potential energy which is needed to find the tully - fisher relation @xcite .",
    "this important relation establishes a connection between the rotational velocity of a spiral galaxy and its luminosity .",
    "since the luminosity is proportional to the mass of the galaxy , the tully - fisher relation connects the rotational velocity of a galaxy with its mass .",
    "in addition , the virial theorem provides a relation between the kinetic energy ( velocity ) and potential energy ( relating to mass or luminosity ) in self - gravitating systems in equilibrium @xcite . as a result , the potential energy found from the weak field limit equations accompanied by the newtonian virial theorem @xcite points to a possible derivation of the tully - fisher relation in the present context which furnishes another possibility for investigating the validity of the model .",
