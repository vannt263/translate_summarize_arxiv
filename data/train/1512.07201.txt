    "controlling uncertain cyber - physical systems ( cps ) or networked control systems ( ncs ) subjected to limited information is a challenging task . generally in cps or ncs ,",
    "multiple physical systems are interconnected and exchanged their local information through a digital network . due to",
    "shared nature of communicating network the continuous or periodic transmission of information causes a large bandwidth requirement .",
    "apart from bandwidth requirement , most of the cyber - physical systems are powered by dc battery , so efficient use of power is essential . it is observed that transmitting data over the communicating network has a proportional relation with the power consumption . this trade off motivates a large number of researchers to continue their research on ncs with minimal sensing and actuation @xcite-@xcite , @xcite-@xcite .",
    "recently an event - triggered based control technique is proposed by @xcite-@xcite , to reduce the information requirement for realizing a stabilizing control law . in event - triggered control , sensing at system end and actuation at controller end happens only when a pre - specified event condition is violated .",
    "this event - condition mostly depends on system s current states or outputs .",
    "the primary shortcoming of continuous - time event - triggered control is that it requires a continuous monitoring of event condition . in @xcite-@xcite ,",
    "heemels et al .",
    "proposes an event - triggering technique where event - condition is monitored periodically . to avoid continuous or periodic monitoring ,",
    "self - triggered control technique is reported in @xcite-@xcite where the next event occurring instant is computed analytically based on the state of previous instant .",
    "maximizing inter - event time is the key aim of the event - triggered or self - triggered control in order to reduce the total transmission requirements .",
    "a girad @xcite , proposes a new event - triggering mechanism named as dynamic event - triggering to achieve larger inter - event time with respect to previous approach @xcite .",
    "the above discussion says the efficacy of aperiodic sensing and actuation over the continuous or periodic one in the context of ncs @xcite .    in ncs",
    ", uncertainty is mainly considered in communicating network in the form of time - delay , data - packet loss in between transreceiving process @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . on the other hand the unmodeled dynamics , time - varying system parameters , external disturbances are the primary sources of system uncertainty .",
    "the main shortcoming of the classical event - triggered system lies in the fact that one must know the exact model of the plant apriori .",
    "a system with an uncertain model is a more realistic scenario and has far greater significance .",
    "however , there are open problems of designing a control law and triggering conditions to deal with system uncertainties . to deal with parametric uncertainty , f. lin et.al .",
    "proposes a continuous - time robust control technique where control input is generated by solving an equivalent optimal control problem @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the optimal control problem is formulated based on the nominal or auxiliary dynamics by minimizing a quadratic cost - functional which depends on the upper bound of uncertainty .",
    "the similar concepts is extended for nonlinear continuous system in @xcite , @xcite , where a non - quadratic cost - functional is considered . however , this framework for discrete - time uncertain system is not reported .",
    "recently e. garcia et.al . have proposed an event - triggered based discrete - time robust control technique for ncs @xcite-@xcite . to realize the robust control law their prior assumptions are that the physical system is affected by matched uncertainty ( which is briefly discussed in section [ sec2 ] ) and",
    "the uncertainty is only in system s state matrix . but",
    "considering mismatched uncertainty in both state and input matrices is more realistic control problem .",
    "this is due to the fact that , the existence of stabilizing control law can be guaranteed for matched uncertainty but difficult for mismatched system .",
    "stabilization of mismatched uncertain system with communication constraint is a challenging task .",
    "this motivates us to formulate the present problem .",
    "+ in this paper a novel discrete - time robust control technique is proposed for ncs , where physical systems are inter - connected through an unreliable communication link . due to unavailability of network",
    "the robust control law is designed using minimal state information .",
    "the designed control law acts on the physical system where the state model is affected by mismatched parametric uncertainty . for mathematical simplicity",
    "we are avoiding other uncertainties like external disturbances , noises .",
    "the communication unreliability is resolved by considering an event - triggered control technique , where control input is computed and updated only when an event - condition is satisfied . to derive the discrete - time robust control input a virtual nominal system and a modified cost - functional",
    "is defined .",
    "solution of the optimal control problem helps to design the stabilizing control input for uncertain system .",

    "<S> this paper proposes a procedure to control an uncertain discrete - time networked control system through a limited stabilizing input information . </S>",
    "<S> the system is primarily affected by the time - varying , norm bounded , mismatched parametric uncertainty . </S>",
    "<S> the input information is limited due to unreliability of communicating networks . </S>",
    "<S> an event - triggered based robust control strategy is adopted to capture the network unreliability . in event - triggered control </S>",
    "<S> the control input is computed and updated at the system end only when a pre - specified event condition is violated . </S>",
    "<S> the robust control input is derived to stabilize the uncertain system by solving an optimal control problem based on a virtual nominal dynamics and a modified cost - functional . </S>",
    "<S> the designed robust control law with limited information ensures input - to - sate stability ( iss ) of original system under presence of mismatched uncertainty . deriving the event - triggering condition for discrete - time uncertain system and ensuring the stability of such system analytically are the key contributions of this paper . </S>",
    "<S> a numerical example is given to prove the efficacy of the proposed event - based control algorithm over the conventional periodic one .    </S>",
