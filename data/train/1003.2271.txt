    "figure  [ fig : bulk ] shows the magnitude of the rkky coupling as function of impurity distance @xmath21 along both the zigzag ( a ) and armchair directions ( b ) of the graphene lattice for several values of @xmath22 .",
    "the rkky coupling in the large @xmath21-limit for non - interacting graphene is @xmath23/|{\\bf r}|^3 $ ] with @xmath24 for a - a sublattice coupling , i.e. for impurities on the same sublattice , ( black ) and @xmath25 and three times larger for a - b ( or different ) sublattice coupling ( red ) @xcite . here",
    "@xmath26 is the reciprocal vector for the dirac points .",
    "apart from minor effects due to a small @xmath21 , these results are displayed in the lowest black and red curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : bulk ] .",
    "the non - oscillatory @xmath21-dependence for the armchair direction is a consequence of only sampling the @xmath27-function at the graphene lattice sites . when including electron interactions these results are , however , qualitatively modified even for small @xmath0 . for @xmath28 ( middle curve ) essentially all evidence of the @xmath29-oscillations is gone as is the factor of three difference between a - a and a - b sublattice coupling",
    ". also , the power - law decay exponent @xmath30 changes from @xmath31 for @xmath32 to around 2.3 ( 2.6 ) for @xmath28 and 1.9 ( 2.1 ) for @xmath33 for the zigzag ( armchair ) direction .",
    "in fact , for @xmath34 ( uppermost curve ) , the armchair and zigzag rkky couplings are equal and thus all lattice specific details have been washed out for such values of the electron interactions . with the mean - field quantum critical coupling for the afm insulating state being @xmath35 @xcite it is perhaps not surprising that the rkky coupling becomes independent of the small length scale details close to this point .",
    "however , what is rather unexpected is that this  washing \" out of the lattice details is clearly present even at such low values as @xmath36 , a value which is very likely lower than the physical value of @xmath0 in graphene .",
    "we thus conclude that including electron interactions is imperative when studying the rkky interaction in graphene . without them not only are the magnitude of the rkky coupling grossly underestimated but , more importantly , the results do not even have a qualitatively correct @xmath21-dependence .",
    "within the non - interacting electron picture we recently showed that for impurities along a zigzag graphene edge ( a - a impurities ) the rkky interaction decays exponentially for large @xmath21 , but that , quite counterintuitively , smaller @xmath3 gives a longer decay length @xcite .",
    "these results are a consequence of the extreme easiness by which an edge impurity can polarize the zero energy edge state .",
    "in contrast , for a - a impurities inside a narrow zgnr , bulk properties of the rkky coupling are largely regained , notably @xmath37 . the effect of the edge is thus only limited to edge impurities in the non - interacting limit .",
    "these results are shown in the two lowest curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : ribbon ] for impurities along the edge ( a ) and inside the ribbon ( c ) for @xmath38 ( black ) and @xmath39 ( red ) .",
    "when including electron interaction this picture is dramatically changed .",
    "as is well established , any finite @xmath0 is going to spontaneously polarize the edge state @xcite , and by extension the whole ribbon @xcite , thus making it harder for an impurity spin to influence the polarization of the graphene .",
    "the three upper curves in ( a , c ) are for @xmath40 and 2 , respectively .",
    "as seen , the @xmath21-dependence completely disappears for @xmath21 larger than a few unit cells for any physically relevant value of @xmath0 and for all impurity sites in a narrow zgnr .",
    "the @xmath21-independent value of the rkky coupling is analyzed as a function of @xmath22 in figs .",
    "[ fig : ribbon](b , d ) . as in the bulk",
    ", the fm impurity configuration is energetically favored for a - a impurities in zgnrs , whereas the afm configuration will require modification of the spontaneous graphene polarization to accommodate the impurity spin of the opposite orientation to said polarization .",
    "there are two @xmath21-independent limiting solutions for the afm configuration of which the one with lowest energy will give an upper bound for the constant rkky coupling .",
    "the first limiting solution has a magnetic domain wall formed between the two afm oriented impurity spins .",
    "the magnetic domain wall formation energy per edge @xmath41 is equal to the rkky coupling for this solution and its value , calculated within eq .",
    "( [ eq : h ] ) , is displayed with a dashed line in figs .",
    "[ fig : ribbon ] ( b , d ) .",
    "this limiting solution is not only independent of @xmath21 but also of @xmath3 making it especially favorable at high @xmath3-values which is also seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : ribbon](b ) . for smaller",
    "@xmath3 it is , however , more likely that the most favorable afm solution is one where the impurity spins do not noticably change the polarization of the underlying graphene , not even directly at the impurity site .",
    "the limiting afm solution in this case is the unperturbed graphene plus the two impurities and has an energy @xmath42 above that of the fm solution . here",
    "@xmath43 is the graphene polarization at the site of the wrongly oriented impurity but in the absence of impurities .",
    "this unperturbed limiting solution is also naturally @xmath21-independent and its rkky coupling is displayed with dash dotted lines in figs .",
    "[ fig : ribbon](b , d ) .",
    "note that since @xmath43 is significantly lower inside a narrow zgnr than on the edge , this solution yields a smaller rkky coupling for impurities away from the edge .",
    "also note that @xmath43 depends rather strongly on @xmath0 , which causes both limiting solutions to increase sharply with an increasing @xmath0 .",
    "the true rkky coupling follow the lower of these two limiting solutions remarkably well for all four cases studied in fig .  [ fig : ribbon ] , including jumping form one to the other around @xmath44 for edge impurities when @xmath39 .",
    "the small deviations from the unperturbed limiting solution are due to some impact of the impurity spins on the graphene polarization which locally produces small changes in @xmath43 in favor of a lower total energy .",
    "the only real notable discrepancy is for edge impurities when @xmath3 is large and @xmath0 moderately small . here",
    "the domain - wall limiting solution is not followed too closely but the system lowers its energy slightly by instead creating a local , half - circle shaped , domain wall around one of the wrongly oriented impurity spin .",
    "this solution naturally creates a spin - imbalance in the system as its domain wall does not propagate to other edge .",
    "note that both of the limiting solutions described here are always present , and thus the qualitative rkky behavior is the same , in any system which has a spontaneous polarization in the absence of impurities , such as is the case for zgnrs for any finite @xmath0 . for edge impurities",
    "we do not expect the width of the ribbon to change the rkky behavior as both the spontaneous edge polarization and @xmath41 are weak functions of the ribbon width .",
    "however , for impurities inside a very wide zgnr the spontaneous polarization inside the ribbon is going to be vanishingly small and bulk properties should eventually be restored for wide ribbons and small @xmath3 .",
    "we thus conclude that any finite electron interaction renders the long - distance rkky coupling in a zgnr @xmath21-independent and linearly dependent on @xmath3 for small @xmath3 , but independent on @xmath3 in the limit of large @xmath3 .",
    "in addition , electron interactions make impurities inside a zgnr behave similarly to edge impurities which is opposite to the situation for non - interacting electrons .",
    "there exist some dft results for the rkky coupling in graphene @xcite but such studies are always limited to very small @xmath21 unless chains ( or lattices ) of impurities are studied .",
    "[ fig : dft ] shows the rkky coupling for a - a sublattice impurity chains along the zigzag direction separated a distance of @xmath45    as function of the impurity distance @xmath21 along the chains .",
    "we see that for @xmath32 ( lowest curve ) characteristic non - interacting @xmath46-type oscillations are present but the chain configuration makes the rkky coupling somewhat more long ranged than @xmath47 .",
    "the oscillations however quickly disappear and the decay exponent @xmath30 decreases ( see inset ) with increasing @xmath0 .",
    "dft results using the hybrid functional b3lyp on the same chain structure is available in ref .  [ ] and these results , scaled with an overall , unimportant prefactor , are displayed with a dashed red line in fig .",
    "[ fig : dft ] .",
    "there are no oscillations in the dft results and the exponent @xmath30 agrees when @xmath14 which also yields very well matched results as indicative in the main plot . at a first glance",
    ", this might seem as a large value for the coulomb repulsion in graphene since the mean - field afm instability is at @xmath35 .",
    "however , one should keep in mind that multiple recent theoretical work have classified graphene as being very close to , if not even being , an insulator in vacuum due to strong coulomb interactions @xcite .",
    "our results point to the fact that this state might be an afm insulator which would be consistent with earlier results @xcite .",
    "our extracted value of @xmath0 also agrees quantitatively with earlier estimations based on the b3lyp functional @xcite .",
    "dft calculations instead using the local density ( lda ) or general gradient ( gga ) approximations have yielded a somewhat smaller @xmath48 @xcite .",
    "it is well known that lda suffers from electron self - interaction and therefore often underestimates @xmath0 .",
    "b3lyp on the other hand explicitly contains an element of fock exchange and thus tends to handle this deficiency better .",
    "this becomes especially important in strongly correlated systems but b3lyp can still reproduce the lda results for weakly correlated materials .    with such high value of @xmath0",
    "it is also natural to ask about other possible electronically driven ordered states . @xmath49",
    "increases with doping @xcite and thus undoped graphene is the strongest candidate for an afm state .",
    "however , with increasing doping electronically driven @xmath50-wave superconductivity caused by spin - singlet nearest neighbor correlations appears for any coulomb interaction @xcite .",
    "such correlations were already proposed by pauling and others @xcite for the @xmath51-bonded planar organic molecules of which graphene is the infinite extension . with the coulomb interaction extracted from the results in fig .",
    "[ fig : dft ] one would need a chemical doping of @xmath52  ev to reach @xmath53  k , a value which might be achieved with , for example , chemical doping .    in summary we have shown that it is of vital importance to include electron - electron interactions when studying the rkky coupling in graphene .",
    "even relatively weak electron interactions qualitatively change the rkky coupling to be significantly longer ranged and monotonically decaying in the bulk . in a zgnr",
    "the change is even more pronounced and the @xmath21 dependence entirely disappears . by comparing our mean - field results",
    "we have also been able to extract a surprisingly high value for the coulomb interactions , demonstrating that graphene might be very close to an afm insulating instability . with such closeness to an afm state",
