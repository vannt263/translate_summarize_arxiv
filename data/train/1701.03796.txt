    "<S> decoherence due to charge noise is one of the central challenges in using spin qubits in semiconductor quantum dots as a platform for quantum information processing . </S>",
    "<S> recently , it has been experimentally demonstrated in both si and gaas singlet - triplet qubits that the effects of charge noise can be suppressed if qubit operations are implemented using symmetric barrier control instead of the standard tilt control . here </S>",
    "<S> , we investigate the key issue of whether the benefits of barrier control persist over the entire set of single - qubit gates by performing randomized benchmarking simulations . </S>",
    "<S> we find the surprising result that the improvement afforded by barrier control depends sensitively on the amount of spin noise : for the minimal nuclear spin noise levels present in si , the coherence time improves by more than two orders of magnitude whereas in gaas , by contrast the coherence time is essentially the same for barrier and tilt control . </S>",
    "<S> however , we establish that barrier control becomes beneficial if qubit operations are performed using a new family of composite pulses that reduce gate times by up to 90% . with these optimized pulses , </S>",
    "<S> barrier control is the best way to achieve high - fidelity quantum gates in singlet - triplet qubits .    </S>",
    "<S> efficient and robust control of quantum systems is key to quantum information processing . </S>",
    "<S> using spins in semiconductor quantum dots is a promising approach due to their fast operation times , long coherence times , and prospect for scalability @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> much progress has been made in designing and demonstrating high - fidelity control over single- and multi - qubit devices based on various qubit types , including single - spin qubits @xcite , double - dot singlet - triplet qubits @xcite , triple - dot exchange - only qubits @xcite , and `` hybrid '' qubits @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> singlet - triplet qubits @xcite are particularly promising due to their relatively simple all - electrical control and long coherence times @xcite . achieving high - fidelity gate operations , however , has been challenging due primarily to charge noise . </S>",
    "<S> qubit operations are implemented by tuning the heisenberg exchange interaction between the two electron spins , and charge fluctuations in the vicinity of the dots introduce noise into this interaction , causing decoherence @xcite . until recently , the standard method for tuning this interaction was to tilt the electrostatic potential defining the two quantum dots by raising the chemical potential in one dot relative to the other @xcite , a method that inherently treats the two dots asymmetrically . in recent groundbreaking experimental works @xcite , it was shown that if symmetry is maintained between the dots and the exchange interaction is tuned instead by adjusting the electrostatic barrier separating them , then the sensitivity of the qubit to charge noise can be reduced substantially . </S>",
    "<S> this is an important result not only for singlet - triplet qubits , but for quantum dot spin qubits in general given the central role of the exchange interaction and the prevalence of charge noise in all such qubits .    despite its importance </S>",
    "<S> , the true benefit of symmetric barrier control is yet to be determined . </S>",
    "<S> this is because the advantages of this technique have only been examined for a very limited set of gate operations , and how it will perform in quantum algorithms involving many types of gates remains completely unknown . </S>",
    "<S> this is a subtle issue because the effect of charge noise depends on ( and increases with ) the strength of the exchange interaction , which in turn depends on the specific gate being implemented . </S>",
    "<S> additional noise sources , such as nuclear spin noise @xcite , can thus become more important than charge noise for certain gates . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the performance of barrier control versus tilt control depends sensitively on the control sequences used to implement gates , and this dependence must be understood in order to take full advantage of barrier control .    in this paper , we perform randomized benchmarking @xcite on singlet - triplet qubits to quantitatively determine the improvement afforded by symmetric barrier control . </S>",
    "<S> we extract the effective single - qubit gate fidelity by averaging over all single - qubit clifford gates for both barrier and tilt control , using experimentally measured levels of charge noise in each case . </S>",
    "<S> we perform this comparison for varying levels of nuclear spin noise ranging from zero ( purified si ) to typical values for gaas . using standard gate control sequences </S>",
    "<S> , we find that in the absence of nuclear spin noise ( i.e. , in si ) , barrier control improves the coherence time by more than two orders of magnitude . on the other hand , for typical levels of nuclear spin noise in gaas </S>",
    "<S> , barrier control gives essentially no improvement because nuclear spin noise dominates for most gates in the set . to overcome this problem </S>",
    "<S> , we present a new set of composite pulses that implement gates up to ten times faster . </S>",
    "<S> these pulses reduce the sensitivity to nuclear spin noise , allowing the benefits of barrier control to become visible in benchmarking simulations even for high levels of nuclear spin noise .    in the case of singlet - triplet qubits , </S>",
    "<S> universal operations require a magnetic field gradient across the two dots in addition to the tunable exchange interaction . </S>",
    "<S> this gradient can be produced either by nuclear spins @xcite or a micromagnet @xcite , and in both cases it remains fixed during gate operations . </S>",
    "<S> the qubit hamiltonian can be written in the form @xmath0/2 $ ] , with @xmath1 denoting the exchange interaction and @xmath2 the field gradient @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> charge noise and nuclear spin noise can be included as stochastic fluctuations @xmath3 , @xmath4 in @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> nuclear spin noise tends to be much more significant in gaas compared with si , however , its influence on qubit coherence can be controlled in both materials : in si through isotopic purification , and in gaas through nuclear spin programming @xcite and bayesian estimation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> both types of noise are known to have power - law frequency spectra @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> randomized benchmarking @xcite is a powerful technique to extract the average gate fidelity using the clifford group , a subset of all possible single - qubit gates . </S>",
    "<S> the randomized benchmarking procedure is implemented by averaging the fidelity @xcite over random sequences of single - qubit clifford gates , and over different noise realizations . </S>",
    "<S> we consider both the full frequency - dependent noise model and the simpler ` quasistatic ' model in our simulations . </S>",
    "<S> the latter assumes noise fluctuations are constant for each run of the experiment ( varying from one run to the next ) and is valid for sufficiently short qubit operations . in order to perform the averaging for either noise model </S>",
    "<S> , we must first determine how to implement arbitrary single - qubit gates in singlet - triplet qubits .    </S>",
    "<S> the simplest operations generated by @xmath5 are rotations of the bloch vector around axes lying in the @xmath6 plane , @xmath7 , where the first entry indicates the rotation axis determined by the ratio @xmath8 , and the second entry is the rotation angle , which is determined by @xmath9 and the operation time . </S>",
    "<S> these gates can be performed in a single shot , meaning that @xmath1 is fixed to one value throughout the operation . </S>",
    "<S> all other types of single - qubit gates must be implemented using composite pulses , in which @xmath1 assumes a few different values over the course of the gate . </S>",
    "<S> these can be designed by invoking the well known fact that an arbitrary rotation @xmath10 can be decomposed into an @xmath11 rotation sandwiched between two @xmath12 rotations ( `` the @xmath12-@xmath11-@xmath12 sequence '' ) @xcite : @xmath13 where @xmath14 are auxiliary angles depending on the desired rotation . </S>",
    "<S> since in practice the magnetic field gradient can not be turned on and off during a given gate operation , @xmath12 rotations must be further broken down as ( `` the hadamard-@xmath11-hadamard sequence '' ) @xcite @xmath15 in practice it is more convenient to use a generalized version of eq .   </S>",

    "<S> thus , in si systems where nuclear spin noise is minimal , barrier control provides a very large improvement , as is consistent with ref .  </S>",

    "<S> in contrast , figs .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : static](c),(d ) and ( e),(f ) show results for moderate ( @xmath39 mhz ) and high ( @xmath40 mhz ) levels of nuclear spin noise ; in these cases , barrier control shows no improvement over tilt control @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we attribute this to the fact that the ramon sequence , eq .  , includes segments with @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> this simultaneously reduces the amount of charge noise ( since @xmath42 ) and slows down gates , increasing exposure to nuclear spin noise . </S>",
    "<S> thus when standard pulse sequences are used , barrier control is only effective if nuclear spin noise is strongly suppressed ( i.e. , si but not gaas ) .     and ( b ) @xmath43 . here , @xmath44 is a time scale that is taken to be @xmath45 throughout this paper . ]    to take greater advantage of barrier control when nuclear spin noise is significant , we need to avoid setting @xmath46 as much as possible . </S>",

    "<S> figure  [ fig : pulseshape](a ) compares a realization of @xmath48 using the optimized sequence ( black line ) and the unoptimized one ( red / gray line ) ; we see that the gate time has been substantially reduced by a factor of @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> sandwiching eq .   between two hadamard gates results in an @xmath11 rotation @xcite . </S>",

[ fig : static ] show our results for randomized benchmarking using our new optimized pulses . </S>",
    "<S> now we see that for all levels of nuclear spin noise , barrier control is superior to tilt control . in the absence of nuclear spin noise ( panels ( a),(b ) ) , </S>",
    "<S> the unoptimized pulses outperform the optimized ones since they are less sensitive to charge noise . </S>",
    "<S> however , in the presence of nuclear spin noise , the optimized pulses show longer coherence times , in some cases by nearly an order of magnitude . even in the absence of nuclear spin noise , the optimized pulses may be preferable due to their shorter gate times .    to test our new optimized pulse sequences , </S>",
    "<S> we carry out randomized benchmarking with the frequency dependence of the noise _ included _ </S>",
