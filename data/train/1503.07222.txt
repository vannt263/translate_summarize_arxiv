    "moreover , we can compute numerical bounds on the exponential decay rate of the state .    even when bibo stable systems are exponentially stable , the estimates of the exponential decay rates provided by standard iqc theory are typically very conservative .",
    "we will show that this conservatism can be greatly reduced if we directly certify exponential stability and use the method presented herein to compute the associated decay rate .",
    "our modified iqc analysis was successfully applied in  @xcite to analyze convergence properties of commonly - used optimization algorithms such as the gradient descent method .",
