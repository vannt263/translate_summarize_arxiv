    "the damped  absorption systems ( dlas ) , detected in the spectra of high redshift quasars are characteristic of large neutral hydrogen column densities , and were first thought to arise in protogalactic disks ( wolfe et al .",
    "this vision has recently evolved with the detection of low redshift systems for which optical identification of the absorber could be performed ( steidel et al .",
    "1994 , le brun et al .",
    "1997 , rao & turnshek 1998 ) .",
    "it appears in fact that all morphological types of galaxies are likely to give rise to such absorptions , and it becomes possible to study in detail the characteristics of the interstellar medium of these galaxies ( absorption line analysis gives informations on metallicity , ionization level , velocity structure ... ) , coupled to their morphological type .",
    "therefore , these dlas are very powerful tools for studying the evolution of galaxies in the aspect of gaseous content , metallicity and star formation history : the absorbing gas detected in the galaxies is at the origin of stars , and the evolution of its amount gives clues for star formation rate estimates vs. cosmic time ( see e.g lanzetta et al .",
    "1995 ) .",
    "however , in the redshift interval @xmath2 ( which covers up to 77% of the age of the universe ) , only very few dlas are known : 1 from the hst `` qso absorption lines key project '' ( jannuzi et al . 1998 ) , 2 from the iue qso survey ( lanzetta et al .",
    "1995 ) , and 7 inferred from the properties of metal lines and/or 21  cm absorption , and confirmed a posteriori with hst spectroscopy ( boiss et al .",
    "1998 ) . as a result of a hst uv spectroscopic survey of strong  systems ,",
    "rao & turnshek ( 1998 ) have increased the sample with 12 new absorbers , but there is anyway a clear need for more absorbers to sample correctly the full properties of the gas vs. galaxy morphological type , abundance , etc .",
    "it as recently been shown that the presence of an absorbing galaxy close to a quasar sightline may induce a bias in the optical magnitude - limited samples of quasars ( for example , the dust contained in the galaxy may lead to a substantial extinction of the quasar , boiss et al .",
    "1998 ) , and it is therefore important to investigate different ways of selection for the quasars . in this context , we present our analysis of a uv - selected quasar spectrum displaying strong and partially resolved absorption lines by the mgii doublet at a redshift of @xmath3 .    given the scarcity of so strong absorption features in known qsos",
    "as mentioned above , we have searched successfully for other metal absorption lines . in this paper , we briefly present the available data in section  2 , while a preliminary analysis of the properties of the absorption system is given in section  3 , leading to the conclusion that it is very likely a new candidate to the dlas sample that consequently deserves further spectroscopic and imaging observations at higher resolution , and towards more uv wavelengths .",
    "we also emphasize the high efficiency of space uv experiments for identifying the @xmath4 dlas .",
    "the new dlas candidate has been identified thanks to the foca balloon - borne survey at 200 nm ( see milliard , donas & laget , @xcite ) .",
    "this 40  cm telescope has been routinely flown over years and has revealed a large set of uv sources with monochromatic magnitudes @xmath5 .",
    "most of them ( @xmath6 ) are extragalactic , as recently confirmed by a spectroscopic follow - up ( milliard et al .",
    "1998 ) , performed in the optical domain toward a high galactic latitude ( @xmath7 ) field of 0.6 square degree including the extragalactic cluster abell 2111 ( a2111 ) .",
    "optical spectroscopy of the foca s uv - detected candidates around a2111 has been carried out with the norris multifiber spectrograph ( hamilton et al .",
    ", 1993@xcite ) mounted at the cassegrain f/16 focus of the hale 5 m telescope at mount palomar .",
    "a detailed description of the observations from 1995 through 1997 , their calibration and methods of reduction will be given in a forthcoming paper ( milliard et al .",
    "@xcite ) , but for the sake of clarity of the present paper let us just mention that the wavelength domain was @xmath8 with a resolution varying from @xmath9 fwhm over the full ccd field , and normally two exposures of @xmath10min were taken on the sky , each one being bracketed by 2 fear arc exposures for wavelength calibration , while flat - fielding was achieved using dome - flats .",
    "special attention was payed to the sky background subtraction , so critical in the infrared , and a relative flux calibration was provided by the very hot sdo standard bd@xmath11 , while the continuous and selective atmospheric absorptions have been approximately corrected for , with satisfactory results in terms of spectral flux distribution over the full wavelength domain in most cases , and in particular for d089/898 as can be checked on fig .  1 .    of the 113 field",
    "extragalactic objects spectroscopically observed around a2111 , 8 are qsos ( previously unidentified ) with redshifts in the range @xmath12 .",
    "one of them is foca s i d .",
    "number d089/898 , a @xmath13 magnitude object that shows a strong , unresolved emission of the mgii 2796 - 2803 doublet at @xmath14 ( together with several weaker emission lines , see fig .  1 ) , but also partially resolved absorptions by the mgii doublet at a lower redshift of @xmath3 , and with rest equivalent widths @xmath15 .",
    "notice that the only deep optical image presently available for this field is a b - band poss2 image . with a limiting magnitude of 22 ,",
    "it is not deep enough neither for identifying the absorbing galaxy nor constraining the brigthness .",

    "besides the strong mgii doublet , several lines of feii are the only other conspicuous features at our spectral resolution and @xmath27 ratio .",
    "upper limits on the strength of the mgi 2852 ( 0.6 ) and caii 3934 ( 0.3 ) lines have also been estimated .",
    "the strengths of the  and  lines strongly suggest the system is a dlas .",
    "photoionization models ( bergeron & stasiska 1986 ) , show that the presence of  lines is a good indicator of high neutral hydrogen column densities , and that whenever the /  ratio ( measured by @xmath28 ) is greater than about unity , the absorber is very likely a strong dlas ( @xmath292 ) , where a /  ratio greater than about 0.6 indicates a neutral hydrogen column density above @xmath302 ( bergeron , private communication ) .",

    "half of them have redshifts below 0.7 ( of which 6 have @xmath37 ) , and thus the hst redshift path is very short .",
    "in contrast , the actual foca sample of qsos around a2111 contains only 8 objects but with redshifts in the range @xmath38 $ ] .",
    "given that i ) the norris spectroscopic observations allow to observe  absorption lines with @xmath39 , yielding a cumulative redshift path in the foca sample of 5.45 ; and ii ) the average number of dlas at @xmath40 being @xmath41 ( lanzetta et al .",
    "1995 ) , one expects to detect @xmath42 dlas , a value compatible with our detection of one system .",
    "indeed , it must be emphasized that compared to the hst / fos key project , we are probing higher redshifts that give access to larger @xmath19 paths in regions of higher dlas density .    more generally , ground - based spectroscopic follow - up of vuv imaging surveys is an efficient way to discover dlas candidates with measurable  lines up to @xmath43 , since the detection in a vuv bandpass picks up with a high probability qsos that are bright enough in the region of the  absorption line , including the scarce high redshift ones that are unaffected by the intergalactic lyman continuum opacity ( mller & jakobsen 1990 ) . in this context , the galex project ( planned for launch in 2001 as a nasa small mission explorer ) will provide a vuv survey quite suited to such a program in its imaging mode .",
    "in addition , with a spectroscopic mode that can by itself discover @xmath44 dlas from their  line directly measured in the uv data , galex is expected to increase the present sample of known dlas by an order of magnitude .",
