    "with the release of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) maps obtained with the planck satellite , a string of properties of primordial scalar perturbations has been established with unprecedented accuracy . in particular , possible deviations from gaussianity and adiabaticity are now subject to quite severe constraints , while exact scale - invariance of the primordial power spectrum is excluded at more than @xmath1 c.l .",
    "these observations show no departure from the simplest idea of single scalar slow roll inflation , while narrowing the window for many alternative scenarios .    along with gaussianity and adiabaticity ,",
    "large - scale statistical isotropy ( si ) of the universe is a basic prediction of standard inflationary cosmology .",
    "this stems from the spin-0 nature of the inflaton and the isotropy of the ( quasi)de sitter space - time  @xcite resulting in the rotational invariance of the inflaton field s correlation functions ; together with the isotropy of the background metric during radiation- and matter - dominated stages , this implies the si of cmb temperature fluctuations @xmath2 .",
    "in particular , this means that the variance @xmath3 is independent of the direction @xmath4 in the sky .",
    "this can be paraphrased in harmonic space as the diagonality of the covariance matrix .",
    "although si is a robust prediction of inflation , there are examples of models which break this symmetry . at the level of primordial scalar perturbations @xmath5 , this amounts to saying that the power spectrum is direction - dependent , @xmath6 it is convenient to expand the function @xmath7 in a series of spherical harmonics  @xcite , @xmath8 generically , the coefficients @xmath9 may have a dependence on the cosmological wavenumber @xmath10 .",
    "depending on the type of directional - dependence , i.e. , the function @xmath7 , one can classify the anisotropies of the early universe as follows :    * axisymmetric quadrupole . in this case",
    "there exists a reference frame where all but one of the @xmath9 coefficients can be turned to zero , leaving only @xmath11 .",
    "this type of statistical anisotropy ( sa ) is the most widely discussed in the literature . besides its simplicity , it is a common prediction of anisotropic models of inflation as well as of some alternatives .",
    "the former include the historically first ackermann  carroll  wise model  @xcite , scenarios with vector curvaton  @xcite , scenarios with a gauge field coupled to waterfall fields in hybrid inflation  @xcite and the generic class of models with a single maxwellian gauge field coupled to the inflaton  @xcite .",
    "alternatives to inflation are represented by models of the ( pseudo)conformal universe  @xcite , i.e. , conformal rolling scenario  @xcite and galilean genesis  @xcite .",
    "the common denominator of those scenarios is the existence of a _ single _ long - ranged vector , which is responsible for si breaking .",
    "rotations with respect to this vector leave the primordial power spectrum intact .",
    "thence , the axial symmetry of the quadrupole . * general quadrupole .",
    "this type of prediction is less widely discussed in literature .",
    "it follows , for example , from inflationary scenarios with _",
    "maxwellian fields coupled to the inflaton  @xcite as well as from the ( pseudo)conformal universe  @xcite . in this case a single parameter is not enough to describe the anisotropy , as the axial symmetry is broken ; a second quantity  the quadrupole shape @xmath12needs to be taken into account  @xcite",
    ". the parameter @xmath12 measures the deviation from axial symmetry .",
    "the particular choice @xmath13 corresponds to leaving the latter intact .",
    "we will sometimes refer to the shape @xmath12 as the angle for reasons which will become clear in section  2 .",
    "sa of general quadrupolar form is the main focus of this work .",
    "* higher multipoles .",
    "this prediction about sa arises in some versions of the ( pseudo)conformal universe  @xcite ; we will not deal with higher multipoles here .",
    "+ we see how sa  at least in principle  could be a useful tool for discriminating among inflationary models as well as alternative frameworks .    so far , most of the data analysis focussed on axisymmetric quadrupolar sa .",
    "the bounds obtained by exploiting the quadratic maximum likelihood estimators  @xcite are given by  @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) , @xmath14 for planck  2015 data and @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) for wmap9 data  @xcite .",
    "planck collaboration extended the analysis so that to include the possible @xmath10-dependence of the amplitude @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "in many cases , these constraints imply very stringent limits on the intrinsic parameters of the anisotropic early universe scenarios .    in the present paper we search for the signatures of the general quadrupolar sa in the cosmological data for @xmath10-independent @xmath17 , see eq .  , using planck  2015 maps .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite , we consider the data provided at @xmath18ghz and @xmath19ghz , and their cross - correlation .",
    "when formulating the final constraints , we stick to the cross - correlated data as the cleanest probe of sa .    the non - observation of any departures from si bounds the amplitude of the general quadrupole @xmath0 .",
    "notably , the data demonstrate different level of agreement with different quadrupole shapes .",
    "this is clear from the resulting constraints on @xmath0 , summarised in table  [ table1 ] , as a function of the shape quantified by the parameter @xmath12 .",
    "we see a slight , but not statistically significant , preference towards negative amplitudes @xmath0 .",
    "that tendency , prominent for sufficiently small angles @xmath12 , vanishes at larger values of @xmath12 , see section  3 for discussions .    for comparison purposes we also test the general quadrupole with planck  2013 data .",
    "the latter , however , turn out to be insensitive to the shape of the quadrupole . as a result , the final constraints on the amplitude @xmath0 are independent on the angle @xmath12 .",
    "these constraints on @xmath0 match very well the limits of ref .",
    "@xcite ( deduced specifically for the axisymmetric quadrupole ) .",
    "generically , in early universe models ( be it inflation or its competitors ) , the amplitude @xmath0 and the angle @xmath12 are not genuine model parameters , but they are random variables with distributions determined by the parameters specific for each scenario .",
    "this is a common situation in anisotropic inflationary scenarios with vector fields and in the ( pseudo)conformal universe .",
    "thus , a separate analysis is required in order to limit those models .",
    "we perform this analysis in section  4 with a focus on inflationary scenarios which comprise ( a collection of ) maxwellian fields non - minimally coupled to the inflaton  @xcite . in that case",
    ", sa is sourced by the infrared modes of these maxwellian ( gauge ) vector fields , which follow a gaussian distribution with a dispersion that grows linearly with the duration of inflation ( in terms of the number of e - folds )  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the number of e - folds can be constrained from the non - observation of sa . in section  4",
    ", we also briefly revisit the limits on some versions of the ( pseudo)conformal universe .",
    "this paper is organised as follows . in section  [ sec : est ] , we discuss the parametrisation of sa . in section  3 , we assess the sensitivity of the planck data to the new parameter @xmath12 .",
    "we constrain inflationary scenarios with multiple vector fields from the non - observation of sa in section  4 .",
    "our constraining scheme there is independent on the results of sections  2 and  3 .",
    "therefore , the reader interested only in those models may go directly to section  4 .",

    "the freedom of choosing the reference frame does not introduce any ambiguity in the quantities @xmath0 and @xmath12 : they are uniquely defined in the region @xmath34 and @xmath35 , only @xmath36 is uniquely defined . this has no physical consequences since the difference between quadrupoles with positive and negative @xmath0 smoothly goes to @xmath37 as @xmath38 , see section  [ ssec : results ] . ] .    for practical purposes",
    "it is convenient to express the coefficients @xmath17 in terms of the amplitude @xmath0 and the shape @xmath12 , @xmath39 where @xmath40 with the planck data at hand , one may reconstruct the coefficients @xmath17 and confront observations with the coefficients calculated for the given parameters @xmath0 and @xmath12 using eqs .   and  .",
    "notice that although we are always considering two parameters ( viz , @xmath0 and @xmath12 ) , an observer looking for imprints in the cmb will have to deal with three additional numbers determining the actual orientation of the quadrupole in the sky ( namely , three angles fixing the orthornomal vectors @xmath41 and @xmath42 ) .",
    "however , the theory typically tells nothing regarding the directions of these vectors , which should thus be drawn from uniform distributions .",
    "marginalising over these three extra parameters one is left with the amplitude @xmath0 and @xmath12 alone .",
    "conventionally , one employs quadratic maximum likelihood ( qml ) estimators to derive the @xmath9 coefficients from cmb maps . originally designed in ref .",
    "@xcite , they yielded the most stringent limits on sa to date  @xcite .",
    "we slightly modify the qml estimators to make them appropriate for the cross - correlation analysis  @xcite .",

    "the second is due to quantum fluctuations which get enhanced and stretched during inflation ( and finally classicalise once they leave the horizon )  @xcite .",
    "this is an infrared component which is built up of all modes , processed by inflation , which are now beyond our observable horizon .",

    "as far as the constraining procedure is concerned , barring cancellations , our limits would be conservative , as we attribute all anisotropy to one component only ; any other additional anisotropy would only exacerbate the discrepancy with the data .",
    "notice furthermore that in multivector scenarios background isotropy is attractive , and the anisotropy is then expected to only arise due to the infrared fluctuations .",
    "hence , we will be interested in the case for which the purely classical `` electric '' fields @xmath117 give a negligible contribution to sa , i.e. , @xmath118 .",

    "by glancing at eq .",
    ", one may see that the amplitude @xmath0 is scale - dependent . despite this dependence being relatively mild",
    ", it may essentially bias our constraints , because planck has access to a wide range of multipoles .",
    "in reality , the dependence present in @xmath106 and the one due to the slow roll potential @xmath120 compensate each other with a high accuracy : @xmath121 substituting the experimental central value @xmath122 and @xmath123 , we observe that two values on the r.h.s .",
