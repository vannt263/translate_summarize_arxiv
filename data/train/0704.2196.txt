    "mips images the sky in bands at 24 , 70 , and 160  .",
    "the absolute calibration of the mips bands is complicated by the challenging nature of removing the instrumental signatures of the mips detectors as well as predicting the flux densities of calibration sources accurately at far - infrared wavelengths .",
    "this paper describes the calibration and characterization of the 70  band .",
    "companion papers provide the transfer of previous absolute calibrations to the mips 24  band @xcite , the 24  band calibration and characterization @xcite , and 160  band calibration and characterization @xcite .",
    "@xcite also presents the mips stellar calibrator sample that is used for this paper .",
    "the calibration factors derived in these papers represent the official mips calibration and are due to the combined efforts of the mips instrument team ( at univ .  of arizona ) and the mips instrument support team ( at the spitzer science center ) .",
    "the characterization and calibration of the mips 70  band is based on stellar photospheres .",
    "the repeatability of 70  photometry is measured from observations of two stars , at least one of which is observed in every mips campaign . the absolute calibration of the 70  band is based on a large network of stars observed in the standard coarse - scale photometry mode with a range of predicted flux densities and backgrounds .",
    "in addition to the coarse - scale observations , a small number of stars were observed in the fine - scale photometry mode to allow the coarse - scale calibration to be transfered to this mode .",
    "the observations used in this paper include both in orbit checkout ( ioc , mips campaigns r , v , x1 , and w ) and regular science operations ( mips campaigns 1 - 29 ) with a cutoff date of 3 mar 2006 .    the goal of the calibration is to transform measurements in instrumental units to instrument independent physical units .",
    "the goal of the characterization is to determine if the calibration depends on how the data are taken ( e.g. , exposure time , time since anneal ) or characteristics of the sources being measured ( e.g. , flux density , background ) .",
    "the primary challenge for the 70  characterization and calibration is accurately correcting the detector transients associated with ge : ga detectors .",
    "the standard reduction steps are detailed in @xcite but extra steps to achieve accurate photometry with the highest possible signal - to - noise for point sources are needed and discussed in this paper .",
    "accurate calibration and high sensitivity is important at 70  as they enable a number of science investigations including the detection and study of cold disks around stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , imaging of warm dust in galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and investigation of faint , redshifted galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the 70  calibration program is based on stars with spectral types from b to m , predicted flux densities from 22  mjy to 17  jy , and predicted backgrounds from 4 to 26 mjy / sr @xcite .",
    "the observations were carried out in photometry mode with 3.15 to 10.49  s individual image exposure times and a range of total exposure times from @xmath450  s to @xmath4560  s. the majority of the observations were performed in standard coarse - scale photometry mode with a few done in the standard fine - scale photometry mode .",
    "the coarse- and fine - scale photometry modes are also referred to as the wide- and narrow - field photometry modes .",
    "the coarse - scale mode samples the 18  fwhm 70  psf with 9.85  pixels .",
    "the minimum coarse - scale photometry mode observation consists of 12 images of the target and 4 images where the internal calibration stimulator is flashed ( see fig . 2 of * ?",
    "the target point source is dithered around the central part of good half of the 70  array so that the source is on different pixels for each of the 12 image exposures .",
    "the stimulator flashes are used to remove the responsivity variations in the ge : ga detectors by dividing each image exposure by an interpolated stimulator flash .",
    "this division converts the raw dn / s units to fractions of the stimulator flash amplitude ( also measured in dn / s units ) which are termed mips70 units .",
    "these mips70 units are surface brightness units as the varying pixel size across the array has been normalized out due to the division by the stimulator flash .",
    "readers should refer to @xcite and @xcite for the details on how mips data are taken and reduced .",
    "the maximum image exposure time is 10.49  s , thus longer total exposures on a source are acquired by repeating the minimum set of images described above .",
    "the fine - scale mode samples the same 70  psf with 5.24  pixels and is designed for detailed studies of source structure .",
    "the dithering strategy is different for fine - scale mode where source - background pairs of images are acquired instead of dithering the source around the array .",
    "the minimum fine - scale photometry mode observation consists of 8 source - background pairs of images , 4 stimulator images , and 2 dedicated stimulator background images .",
    "the data reduction is the same as the coarse - scale mode and , thus , the resulting raw units of the images are also fractions of the stimulator flash and are termed mips70f units .",
    "these units are different than the mips70 units due to the change in the optical train used .",
    "the coarse - scale observations were extensive and motivated to check non - linearities versus flux density , background , exposure time , etc .",
    "the fine - scale observations were done to transfer the coarse - scale calibration to the fine - scale .",
    "the coarse - scale and scan map modes share the same optical train and only differ in the dithering strategy , thus the coarse - scale photometry calibration should apply to the scan map mode observations .",
    "each observation was reduced through the mips data analysis tool ( dat , v3.06 , * ? ? ?",
    "the resulting mosaics of this default processing are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_red_example]a , d for two point sources observed in coarse - scale mode .",
    "it is possible to improve the detection of point sources taken in photometry mode by utilizing the redundancy of the observations to remove residual instrumental signatures .",
    "these residual signatures arise because the stimulator flashes calibrate the fast response of the detectors well , but there is a drift between the fast and slow response of the detectors @xcite .",
    "in coarse - scale mode , point sources are dithered around the array to ensure their signals are in the well calibrated fast response .",
    "the dithering does not put the background signal in the fast response and as the sky level is roughly equal at the different dither positions , the background is in the slow response regime . as an accurate measurement of the background is essential for good photometry , the drifting background needs to be corrected by two additional steps .",
    "the extra steps are designed not to introduce biases into the data based on source flux density while reducing the residual instrumental signatures .",
    "the largest portion of the drift is seen to be in common among pixels in the same column .",
    "this is not surprising as columns represent a common strip of detector material @xcite .",
    "the column offset can be removed easily for observations of isolated point sources by subtracting the median of the column .",
    "the median of each column is computed after excluding a region centered on the source with a diameter of 9 pixels ( @xmath489 ) to ensure the resulting correction is not biased by the source .",
    "the column subtracted data are shown in fig .  [ fig_red_example]b , e . a smaller , but still significant background drift seen as array dependent structure is still present after this correction .",
    "this smaller residual instrument signature can be removed from each pixel by using a simple time filter .",
    "this time filter works by subtracting the mean value from a pixel of the previous and next 14 measurements of that pixel . to ensure that this mean value is not biased by the presence of the source itself , all measurements of the source within a spatial radius of 4.5 pixels as well the current , previous , and next measurements are not used in computing the mean value .",
    "the mean is computed after excluding all the pixels @xmath5 from the median ( sigma clipping ) .",
    "the time filter only uses data taken on a particular source which means that the time filtering is less accurate at the beginning and end of the observation set .",
    "this time filtering with constraints was optimized to minimize the background noise .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_red_example]c , f . from the two examples shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_red_example ] , it is clear that the importance of these extra processing steps increases with decreasing source flux density .",
    "unlike coarse - scale photometry mode where the large field of view provides sufficient area for background estimates , the reduced field of view of the find - scale mode requires that the point source be chopped off the array .",
    "this simplifies the extra processing to just subtracting the images taken in the off positions from the on position images which effectively removes the column offsets and smaller scale pixel dependent drifts in the background .      a necessary part of measuring the flux density of a point source using aperture photometry or point spread function ( psf ) fitting is an accurate psf .",
    "the repeatability measurements on hd  163588 and hd  180711 provide the ideal opportunity to compare the stinytim @xcite model of the mips 70  psf to the coarse - scale observations .",
    "the repeated observations of these two stars allow for very high signal - to - noise observed psfs to be constructed .",
    "all of the observations of these two stars taken after the final optimization of the array parameters ( @xmath65th mips campaign ) were mosaiced to produce two empirical psfs .",
    "the fine - scale observed psfs are from observations of the fine - scale calibration stars .",
    "the observed psfs are compared with the stinytim psf for a t  =  10000  k blackbody in fig .",
    "[ fig_psf_comp ] .",
    "all stars in our calibration program have the same spectrum across the 70  band as the rayleigh - jeans tail of stellar spectra is being sampled .",
    "thus , the psf generated assuming a t  =  10000  k blackbody is a good representation of any star s psf as long as it does not have an infrared excess .",
    "as can be seen for both coarse- and fine - scale , the model psf well represents the observed psfs when the smoothing associated with the pixel sampling is applied .",
    "we have simulated the pixel sampling smoothing two different methods .",
    "the first method used uses the mips_simulator program which produces simulated mips observations with the observed dithering using an input psf .",
    "these simulated observations where mosaiced , using the same software which is used for the actual observations , to produce the mips_simulator psf shown .",
    "the second method uses a simple boxcar smoothing function .",
    "the `` smooth=1.35 pix '' and `` smooth=1.5 pix '' psfs are created by directly smoothing the stinytim psf with a square kernel with the specified width where the pixel sizes are 9.85@xmath7 and 5.24@xmath7 for the coarse- and fine - scales , respectively . the close correspondence between the observed , mips_simulator , and directly smoothed psfs means that accurate mips 70  psfs can be generated from the stinytim psf smoothed with a simple square kernel .    the correspondence between the observed and stinytim model psfs was expected as the mips 70  band should be purely diffraction limited .",
    "the 70  band has a bandwidth of @xmath419  resulting in the psf varying significantly between blue ( peaking at wavelengths shorter than the band ) and red ( peaking at wavelengths longer than the band ) sources .",
    "in addition to stellar sources , we have verified that stinytim model psfs describe the observed psfs for sources with blackbody temperatures as low as 60  k using observations of asteroids and pluto .",
    "having a valid model for the psf allows for accurate , noiseless aperture corrections as the total flux density is known from psfs created with different source spectra",
    ".    the observed fine - scale psfs do show disagreement in the core , where the model psf is systematically higher .",
    "this is not surprising given that there are known flux density nonlinearities in the ge : ga detectors that are not corrected in the standard data reduction and the fine - scale calibration stars are brighter than those observed in the coarse - scale mode .",
    "characterization of these flux density nonlinearities is ongoing , but preliminary indications are that they are @xmath415% for point source flux densities of @xmath420  jy observed in the coarse - scale mode ( see  [ sec_nonlin ] ) .",
    "the coarse - scale observed psfs do not show any systematic disagreement in the core , consistent with the use of fainter stars .",
    "the aperture corrections were calculated by performing aperture photometry on square kernel smoothed model psfs .",
    "the model psfs were computed for a @xmath8 field to ensure that the total flux of a point source was measured .",
    "the method for computing the aperture corrections is the same as used for measuring the calibration star flux densities used in this paper .",
    "the method does not account for partial pixels but given that the model psfs were computed with pixels 10@xmath9 smaller than the array pixel size this is not expected to be an issue even for the smallest apertures considered in this paper . for the purposes of this paper ,",
    "we use the radius = 35  aperture ( 1.22 aperture correction ) to minimize the sensitivity of the calibration to uncertainty in the aperture correction and centering errors .",
    "the aperture corrections for a small sample of object aperture and background annuli are given in table  [ tab_apcor ] for three psfs ( t  =  10000  k , 60  k , and 10  k blackbodies ) .",
    "three psfs with different source spectra are given to emphasize the importance of using psfs with the right source spectrum for accurate photometry .",
    "the photometry was measured with aperture photometry and psf fitting for each observation of a calibration star .",
    "the aperture photometry was done with a circular aperture with a radius of @xmath10 and a sky annulus of 39 to @xmath11 .",
    "the psf fitting was done with starfinder @xcite which is ideally suited for the well sampled and stable mips psfs .",
    "the flux densities measured with these two methods are listed in tables  [ tab_meas_wf]-[tab_meas_nf ] .",
    "the aperture flux densities have had the aperture correction applied and the psf flux densities are naturally for an infinite aperture .",
    "in addition to the reported flux densities , signal - to - noise ( s / n ) calculations are also reported . in the case of the aperture photometry , the s / n",
    "calculation is done using the noise in the sky annulus to determine both the uncertainty due to summing the object flux density as well as subtracting the background .",
    "this s / n does not include the contribution from the photon noise of the source as the gain of ge : ga detectors is not a well defined quantity . in the case of the psf photometry , the s / n calculation is done by the starfinder program utilizing the empirical uncertainty image calculated from the repeated measurements of each point in the mosaic .",
    "only measurements with s / n greater than 5 are reported in tables  [ tab_meas_wf]-[tab_meas_nf ] .",
    "the columns in these tables give the star name , campaign of observation , aor # ( unique spitzer observation identifier ) , exposure start time , individual exposure time , total exposure time , aperture flux density , signal - to - noise , psf flux density , and signal - to - noise .",
    "the measurements used in this paper were all reduced with the dat and custom software based on the dat results .",
    "comparisons were done with measurements using data reduced with the spitzer science center ( ssc ) pipeline and similar software available from the contributed software portion of the spitzer website .",
    "note that the ssc pipeline reduced images are given in mjy sr@xmath0 and must be divided by the applied flux conversion factor ( given by the fits header keyword fluxconv ) to recover the instrumental mips70 or mips70f units .",
    "the result of this comparison is that the two methods produce equivalent results with a mean ratio of dat to ssc aperture photometry for the full sample of @xmath12 .",
    "the predicted flux densities at 70  were derived from the 24  predictions presented by @xcite using 24/70  colors derived from models . for each star ,",
    "the ratio of the flux densities at the effective filter wavelengths of 23.675  and 71.42  was computed for the appropriate @xcite model ( using a power - law interpolation ) and a blackbody at the effective temperature of the star .",
    "the model ratio was taken to be the average of these two values , which typically differed by 1 - 2% , and the uncertainty was taken to be the difference between them .",
    "the predicted flux densities at 24  were divided by this ratio to compute the 70  flux densities .",
    "the uncertainties on the flux density predictions were calculated by adding in quadrature the uncertainties in the 24  flux density and in the 24/70  color prediction .",
    "the average predicted backgrounds for the observations were estimated from spitzer planning observations tool ( spot ) with the uncertainties giving the range when each target is visible .",
    "the full sample of calibration stars covers a wide range of ecliptic and galactic latitudes providing a large range in backgrounds , but for any particular star the backgrounds vary by @xmath1330% for different dates of observation .",
    "the flux density predictions and background estimates are listed in tables  [ tab_ave_wf ] & [ tab_ave_nf ] .",
    "these tables also give each star s spectral type , the average of the measured aperture and psf flux densities and their associated signal - to - noises .",
    "in addition , the average calibration factor determined using the aperture and psf fitting measurements is given ( see  [ sec_nonlin ] ) .",
    "the zero point of the 70  band at the effective filter wavelength of 71.42  is @xmath14  jy in the @xcite system .",
    "it is important to note that the 70  calibration is based on stars ( 10,000  k blackbody ) .",
    "thus , measuring accurate 70  flux densities for objects with different spectral energy distributions requires the use of the color corrections given in @xcite .",
    "the first step in deriving the final calibration factor is to examine the ensemble of calibration factor measurements for stars which show significant deviations .",
    "these deviations can be the result of a star having an infrared excess , a poor flux density prediction , or a measurement corrupted by extended emission .",
    "infrared excesses and poor flux density predictions can be seen by calculating the calibration factor for each star and identifying stars that give calibration factors that are significantly deviant from the ensemble .",
    "stars with excesses will have measured flux densities well in excess of the predicted flux densities and , thus , will predict low calibration factors compared to non - excess stars .",
    "figure  [ fig_calfac_vs_flux ] displays the calibration factors for all the calibration stars versus predicted flux density .",
    "the calibration factors are calculated as a conversion from mips70 units to mjy  sr@xmath0 as the basic measurement made by the 70  detectors is flux per pixel which is a surface brightness ( see  [ sec_calfac_wf ] for the conversion from mips70 units directly to flux densities assuming the default 70  mosaic pixel size ) .",
    "measurements using both aperture photometry and psf fitting are shown in this figure .",
    "the psf fitting values show less scatter than the aperture photometry values and , thus , will be the basis for identifying deviant measurements .",
    "we identify two stars ( hd  102647 and hd  173398 ) which have possible excesses from fig .",
    "[ fig_calfac_vs_flux ] and no stars with poor flux density predictions .",
    "there are seven stars that have significant extended emission underlying or near the object position determined by visual inspection of the 70  images . during this inspection",
    ", it was seen that the observation of hd  173511 was affected by a nearby , much brighter object and , as a result , this star was also rejected .",
    "the stars in our sample that have been rejected for any of these three reasons are listed in table  [ tab_reject ] . if a star was rejected as part of the 24  analysis given in @xcite , it is not used at all in this paper .",
    "a possible source of scatter in the calibration factor measurements is flux density nonlinearities that are a characteristic of ge : ga detectors .",
    "in contrast to electronic nonlinearities that depend solely on total flux density , flux density nonlinearities are due to the change in rate of flux density falling on the detectors ( e.g. , when a source chops onto a detector ) . given that the nonlinearity is due to a change in flux density on the detector , the flux density nonlinearity could depend on background as well as source flux density .",
    "the electronic nonlinearities are small ( @xmath15% ) for the mips 70  pixels and are corrected when the data are reduced @xcite .",
    "[ fig_calfac ] shows the calibration factors versus predicted flux densities and backgrounds .",
    "the calibration factors have been calculated from the average of all the measurements of each star and the uncertainty on the average includes the flux density prediction uncertainty .",
    "the calculated calibration factors for each star are listed in tables  [ tab_ave_wf ] & [ tab_ave_nf ] .",
    "it is clear that flux density nonlinearities are present in the aperture photometry data but are much smaller or non - existent in the psf fitting photometry .",
    "a direct comparison of the aperture and psf fitting measurements is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_ap_psf_comp ] .",
    "starting at around @xmath41  jy , the aperture measurements begin to underestimate the psf measurements while below @xmath4200  mjy , the aperture to psf fitting ratio shows a large scatter . for bright sources , the flux density nonlinearities will show up at the peak of the psf and the psf fitting compensates as relatively more weight is given to the wings of the psf than in aperture photometry .",
    "for faint sources , the psf fitting shows less scatter since it more accurately accounts for nearby faint sources and background structure than aperture photometry . for these reasons",
    ", we will use the psf fitting measurements for the rest of this work .",
    "the psf fitting measurements show that the 70  calibration measurements are linear between 22  mjy and 17  jy .",
    "a linear fit to these data ( accounting for the uncertainties in both x and y values ) gives @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the flux density in mjy .",
    "there are four stars ( hd 31398 , 120933 , 213310 , & 216131 ) that are @xmath18 from the mean calibration factor and are identified with square boxes in fig .  [ fig_calfac ] .",
    "the large deviations of these four stars are most likely due to weak infrared excesses as the derived calibration factor is low compared to the ensemble .",
    "these four stars have been excluded from the fit and from the rest of the paper .",
    "the slope value is consistent with no nonlinearities ; the upper limit on the nonlinearities is computed to be 1.5% from the ratio of the fit values at 10  mjy and 20  jy .",

    "<S> the absolute calibration and characterization of the multiband imaging photometer for spitzer ( mips ) 70  coarse- and fine - scale imaging modes are presented based on over 2.5 years of observations . </S>",
    "<S> accurate photometry ( especially for faint sources ) requires two simple processing steps beyond the standard data reduction to remove long - term detector transients . </S>",
    "<S> point spread function ( psf ) fitting photometry is found to give more accurate flux densities than aperture photometry . </S>",
    "<S> based on the psf fitting photometry , the calibration factor shows no strong trend with flux density , background , spectral type , exposure time , or time since anneals . </S>",
    "<S> the coarse - scale calibration sample includes observations of stars with flux densities from 22  mjy to 17  jy , on backgrounds from 4 to 26  mjy  sr@xmath0 , and with spectral types from b to m. the coarse - scale calibration is @xmath1  mjy  sr@xmath0  mips70@xmath0 ( 5% uncertainty ) and is based on measurements of 66 stars . </S>",
    "<S> the instrumental units of the mips 70  coarse- and fine - scale imaging modes are called mips70 and mips70f , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the photometric repeatability is calculated to be 4.5% from two stars measured during every mips campaign and includes variations on all time scales probed . </S>",
    "<S> the preliminary fine - scale calibration factor is @xmath2  mjy  sr@xmath0  mips70f@xmath0 ( 10% uncertainty ) based on 10 stars . </S>",
    "<S> the uncertainty in the coarse- and fine - scale calibration factors are dominated by the 4.5% photometric repeatability and the small sample size , respectively . the 5@xmath3 , 500  s sensitivity of the coarse - scale observations is 68  mjy . </S>",
    "<S> this work shows that the mips 70  array produces accurate , well calibrated photometry and validates the mips 70  operating strategy , especially the use of frequent stimulator flashes to track the changing responsivities of the ge : ga detectors . </S>"
