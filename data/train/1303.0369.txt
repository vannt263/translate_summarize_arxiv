    "<S> being motivated in terms of mathematical concepts from the theory of electrical networks , klein & ivanciuc introduced and studied a new graph - theoretic cyclicity index  the global cyclicity index ( graph cyclicity , excess conductance , and resistance deficit , j. math . </S>",
    "<S> chem . 30 </S>",
    "<S> ( 2001 ) 271287 ) . in this paper , by utilizing techniques from graph theory , electrical network theory and real analysis , we obtain some further results on this new cyclicity measure , including the strictly monotone increasing property , some lower and upper bounds , and some nordhuas - gaddum - type results . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we establish a relationship between the global cyclicity index @xmath0 and the cyclomatic number @xmath1 of a connected graph @xmath2 with @xmath3 vertices and @xmath4 edges : @xmath5    * key words : * resistance distance , global cyclicity index , cyclomatic number , nordhuas - gaddum - type result </S>"
