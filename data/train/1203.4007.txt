    "the positivity of the hilbert space scalar product gives place to an infinite series of inequalities for the correlators of operators in quantum mechanics .",
    "given a family @xmath2 , @xmath3 , of operators , a state @xmath4 , and arbitrary complex numbers @xmath5 , we have @xmath6 because the @xmath5 are arbitrary , the matrix of correlators has to be positive definite .",
    "this is equivalent to @xmath7 for any collection of @xmath8 operators .",
    "when the starting point in the description of the theory is given by some numerical functions , these inequalities become specially relevant .",
    "in fact , this property allows us to recover the hilbert space from vacuum expectation values , and plays a central role in wightman reconstruction theorem in quantum field theory ( qft ) @xcite .    a remarkable case of a function unexpectedly satisfying inequalities analogous to ( [ det1 ] ) is given by the traces of integer powers of the local density matrix @xmath9 , @xmath10 .",
    "here @xmath11 is the vacuum state density matrix @xmath12 reduced to a region @xmath13 of the space by tracing over the degrees of freedom outside @xmath13 .",
    "it is quite surprising these statistical measures give place to operator correlators .",
    "the operator behind the identification with correlation functions for @xmath14 is not @xmath15 , which nevertheless produces the correct expectation values @xmath16 . here",
    "@xmath15 is not an operator in the usual sense since it depends on the state .",
    "more importantly , inequalities such as ( [ det1 ] ) further require that @xmath17 , for operators @xmath18 and @xmath19 localized in @xmath20 and @xmath21 , in some theory , not necessarily the original one in which @xmath22 is calculated .",
    "this is not the case of @xmath23 .",
    "an operator expectation value interpretation of @xmath24 follows considering the @xmath25-replicated model .",
    "this construction is valid in any quantum mechanical system .",
    "let us consider a system with global state @xmath26 , hilbert space @xmath27 , and let @xmath28 . in the replicated model we take @xmath25 identical copies of this system . the global state is @xmath29 , and let a basis of the global hilbert space of the @xmath30 copy be @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is a basis for the hilbert space",
    "@xmath33 and @xmath34 is a basis for the one corresponding to the complementary region @xmath35 .",
    "then , defining the unitary operator @xmath36 acting on @xmath37 @xmath38 it follows that @xmath39 we also have the splitting relation @xmath40 for non - intersecting @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "a lattice version of @xmath36 has been used in @xcite , where these are called swap operators .",
    "notice @xmath43 does not depend on the chosen basis for the hilbert spaces in ( [ chosen ] ) .",
    "the replica trick was first introduced in this context to give an expression of the trace @xmath44 in the path integral formulation .",
    "this is given by the partition function in a @xmath25-replicated space identified along the @xmath25 copies of @xmath13 in such a way one goes from a copy to the other crossing @xmath13 .",
    "the complete manifold is flat everywhere except at the boundaries of @xmath13 where it displays a conical singularity of angle @xmath45 . for a detailed description of this replica trick see @xcite .",
    "these partition functions in non trivial manifolds have been interpreted in the two dimensional case in terms of field operator expectation values in @xcite .",
    "these are called twisting operators , and are defined to do the job of imposing the correct boundary conditions .",
    "it is convenient for later use to express these traces in terms of the `` entanglement '' renyi entropies @xmath46 , such that @xmath47 allowing for arbitrary real index @xmath25 , the limit @xmath48 , gives the entanglement entropy corresponding to @xmath13 .    in the euclidean version of qft",
    "the positivity inequalities analogous to ( [ det1 ] ) are called reflection positivity inequalities @xcite .",
    "specifically , for the integer @xmath25 renyi entropies these later write @xmath49 here @xmath20 , @xmath50 is a collection of co - dimension one sets included in the half - space of positive euclidean time , and @xmath51 is the euclidean time - reflected region corresponding to @xmath21 .",
    "the region @xmath52 is just the union of @xmath20 and @xmath51 ( see figure [ parallelas ] ) .",

    "a short and direct proof of the inequalities ( [ det2 ] ) follows directly in the usual way reflection positivity is proved with the path integral .",
    "this involves splitting the path integral for positive and negative time . writing @xmath53 and @xmath54 for the restrictions of the field @xmath55 to positive and negative euclidean time , and considering a family of regions @xmath20 in the positive euclidean time half - space , we have @xmath56}\\hspace{7cm}\\\\ = { \\cal n}^{-n}\\int { \\cal d}\\phi_0(\\vec{x})\\ ,   \\left(\\sum_i \\lambda_i\\int^{v_i } _ { \\phi^+(0,\\vec{x})=\\phi_0(\\vec{x } ) } { \\cal d}\\phi^+ e^{-s[\\phi^+]}\\right ) \\left(\\sum_j   \\lambda_j^ * \\int^{\\bar{v}_j } _ { \\phi^-(0,\\vec{x})=\\phi_0(\\vec{x } ) } { \\cal d}\\phi^- e^{-s[\\phi^-]}\\right ) \\,.\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] these are integrals in @xmath25 replicated space , and the superscript @xmath13 means the appropriate boundary conditions take place on @xmath13 .",

    "@xmath36 are localized in @xmath13 , but they do not really depend on the shape of @xmath13 but only on its boundary @xmath65 .",
    "different @xmath13 with the same boundary give place to the same boundary conditions of the path integral . in the real time interpretation this is just causality : @xmath11 and @xmath66 are the same if the spatial sets @xmath13 and @xmath67 have the same boundary because in that case these are equivalent cauchy surfaces @xcite",
    ". a unitary transformation between the variables on these two surfaces amounts to an irrelevant change of basis in the renyi operators ( [ chosen ] ) .",
    "the hypersurfaces @xmath13 have two possible sides .",
    "crossing @xmath13 from one side , the change of copies in the replicated manifold is in the sequence @xmath68 or in the opposite direction @xmath69 , according to the chosen orientation for @xmath13 .",
    "if the orientation is determined by a normal vector to the surface @xmath13 , in the definition of @xmath70 it is assumed that the orientation vector has changed by a time reflection .",
    "we can take advantage of this to obtain inequalities for single component sets @xmath13 . arranging regions @xmath41 close to the surface @xmath62",
    ", @xmath71 approaches a one component region @xmath13 ( see figure 1b ) .",
    "the sides along the @xmath62 plane have opposite orientation and their contribution should decouple from the inequality ( [ det2 ] ) because the nearby operators should have an ope proportional to the identity .",
    "the entropy is obtained from the renyi entropies in the limit @xmath72 .",
    "this requires an analytic extension in @xmath25 from the knowledge of @xmath73 for @xmath25 integer .",
    "this extension is unique under reasonable assumptions ( see @xcite ) .",
    "however , in general there is no path integral representation of @xmath73 for general @xmath25 .",
    "the naive approach would be imposing boundary conditions in a manifold , with conical angle @xmath45 , for non integer @xmath25 , in the boundary of @xmath13 , and such that for integer @xmath25 one recovers the above mentioned replicated manifolds .",
    "unfortunately this can not be generally achieved using manifolds which are flat outside @xmath65 .",
    "a notable exception is the case where there is a `` rotational '' symmetry with the angle @xmath45 as the parameter of a one dimensional symmetry group ( see @xcite for a nice account of these problems ) .",
    "this is the case of @xmath13 being the half space in a general qft , or a sphere in a conformal qft . in curved space - times",
    "this symmetry appears typically when the boundary of @xmath13 is a killing horizon .",
    "another example in which thinking in terms of small deficit angle in the path integral is justified is solodukhin s formula for the logarithmically divergent term in the entropy for conformal theories and general regions in four dimensions @xcite .",
    "this is given as a linear combination of two dimensionless , conformally invariant , and local terms , which are integrals of polynomials of the extrinsic curvature on @xmath65 .",
    "this general geometric structure of the coefficient of the logarithmic term can be ascribed on general grounds to the nature of the ultraviolet divergences in the entropy .",
    "the coefficients of these geometrical terms are linear in the two trace anomaly coefficients of the cft .",
    "the trace anomaly coefficients are defined for smooth metrics , hence it is apparent the necessity of the limit of small conical defects to establish a connection with the entanglement entropy . for the case where @xmath13 is a sphere",
    ", the coefficient turns out to be proportional to the coefficient of the euler density in the trace anomaly .",
    "this has been later proved to be the case in any dimensions using purely qft arguments , which rely on the existence of a rotational ( conformal ) symmetry for the sphere @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . for a cylinder in flat space the other anomaly coefficient is selected in solodukhin s formula , though there is no additional rotational symmetry .",
    "however , the logarithmic terms are both local and conformally invariant , and in order to compute them a conformal transformation can be used to map the original geometry into another one in curved space , in which there is no extrinsic curvature , and there is a rotational symmetry around the boundary ( at least locally ) .",
    "the result for the cylinder has also been found by holographic calculations of entanglement entropy for theories with higher derivative gravity actions @xcite , and confirmed in numerical calculations of the logarithmic term for free massless scalars and fermions in four dimensions @xcite .    in more general cases , where there is no path integral representation for non integer @xmath25 ,",
    "one may still think , as a working hypothesis , that for infinitesimal deficit angles @xmath74 , appropriate for the limit corresponding to the entropy , it might be possible to use the path integral formula , and trust it to first order in @xmath75 . the conical curvature is then placed by insertion of an infinitesimal curvature tensor supported on the boundary of @xmath13 .",
    "this construction has been used in the literature in several occasions , though up to the present there is no clear deductive way to this representation for the entropy in a general region .",
    "a notable case where the representation of the entanglement entropy in terms of a path integral in a manifold with infinitesimal conical singularities is used is fursaev s proof of the holographic entanglement entropy @xcite , as given by the ryu - takayanagi ansatz @xcite .",
    "this ansatz gives the entanglement entropy in @xmath13 in the ads boundary qft as @xmath76 times the area of a minimal surface in the bulk ads space , with boundary coinciding with @xmath65 , @xmath77 we often call the area of the minimal surface directly as @xmath78 .",
    "this holographic formula for the entropy has passed several tests , including giving the correct coefficient of the logarithmically divergent term for the entropy of spheres in any dimension @xcite , the strong subadditive inequality for sets in a single spatial hyperplane @xcite , and the thermal entropy of the boundary in presence of a bulk black hole @xcite .",
    "however , the missing link between the replicated space for integer @xmath25 and the small angle hypothesis sheds some doubts on one of the assumptions of fursaev s proof for general geometries , as discussed in @xcite .",
    "thinking in terms of the positivity inequalities , the idea of the small deficit angle path integral representation , with insertions at the boundary of @xmath13 is far from being innocent , and implies a large body of non trivial relations .",
    "we have seen above that @xmath79 obeys the correlator inequalities due to its path integral representation .",
    "the assumption of the small deficit angle path integral representation can be then be rephrased ( and generalized ) as that @xmath79 obeys the positivity inequalities at first order in @xmath1 as @xmath0 .",
    "this is equivalent to the matrices @xmath80 being positive definite for small enough @xmath75 .",
    "as explained in section 2 this is the mathematical requirement for the matrices @xmath81 to be conditionally positive definite , or equivalently , the matrices of the exponentials @xmath82 , with any @xmath83 , to be infinitely divisible .",
    "expanding the determinants in ( [ det2 ] ) for small @xmath75 we get @xmath84 this is an infinite series of polynomial inequalities in the entropy , one for each polynomial order . if these conditional positive inequalities where correct the entropy itself would have an associated  almost  operator , such that @xmath85 , @xmath86 .",
    "@xmath87 is an  almost  operator , in the sense that positivity inequalities are not be satisfied by @xmath87 but they are fulfilled by @xmath88 , with @xmath89 a numerical function .",
    "this function generally has to be taken to be non translational invariant .",
    "an example of an almost operator in this sense is given by the free massless scalar field in two dimensions , as will be review later .",
    "the entanglement entropies have ultraviolet divergences which might in principle obscure the physical content of these inequalities . correspondingly , the minimal areas in ads space diverge due to the infinite volume of the surfaces as they approach the asymptotic boundary . however , these divergences , being local and extensive along the boundaries @xmath65 , cancel out in the generic matrix element in ( [ seiq ] ) .",
    "the inequalities can be equivalently written in terms of the mutual information @xmath90 , which is finite , as @xmath91 the divergences can also be eliminated from ( [ det2 ] ) by computing the well defined connected correlators @xmath92 with @xmath93 .",
    "multiplying the matrix elements in ( [ det2 ] ) by the factor @xmath94 does not change the positive definite character of the matrix .",
    "the linear inequality in ( [ seiq])(with @xmath95 ) writes @xmath96 it also holds for the integer index renyi entropies since it coincides with the @xmath95 case in ( [ det2 ] ) . when @xmath97 are on the same hyperplane the inequality ( [ doo ] ) coincides with some specially symmetric case of the strong subadditive inequality of the entropy .",
    "this last inequality has been discussed in the context of minimal areas @xcite .",
    "the reason for the validity of ( [ doo ] ) for minimal areas is very simple , and was first discussed in @xcite in relation to the strong subadditive inequality for coplanar regions .",
    "it is due to the triangle inequality satisfied by the minimum of the area functional ( see figure [ para ] ) .",
    "however , in the present case , the time - symmetric position of the regions in ( [ doo ] ) is important for the validity of the inequality , since it enforces the relevant minimal surfaces cut each other in order to apply the triangle inequality .",
    "further linear inequalities for the entropy in ads - cft have been discussed in @xcite .",
    "we hope that learning whether the @xmath98 non - linear inequalities in ( [ seiq ] ) hold will teach us something about the fundamentation of fursaev s proof and the ryu - takayanagi proposal for the holographic entanglement entropy . in this paper",
    "we take an `` experimental '' attitude and check these inequalities in all ( admittedly few ) known exact calculations of entanglement entropy in qft .",
    "so far , the entanglement entropy can be calculated exactly mostly for free fields in simple geometries and these are the cases we have checked .",
    "we use either numerical evaluation or analytical tools .",
    "up to what we have checked , we could not find a counterexample to these inequalities in the qft examples .",
    "then we check them for minimal areas representing holographic entanglement entropies .",
    "we find the inequalities are remarkably satisfied in several non trivial cases , though we also find some counterexamples .",
    "we distinguish two types of counterexamples , the ones in which the minimal areas in the correlation matrix experiment a phase transition as a function of the shape of the region , and the ones in which they do not .",
    "these phase transitions are related to the fact that the boundary theory is evaluated in a large n and large coupling constant limit , and are not expected to occur in the entanglement entropy for ordinary field theories with finite number of degrees of freedom .",
    "the counterexamples without phase transition violate the `` infinitesimal '' inequalities obtained from ( [ seiq ] ) for infinitesimally displaced regions .",
    "the infinitesimal inequalities involve an infinite series of inequalities for the function derivatives of arbitrarily high order .",
    "remarkably , we show the positivity relations of correlation functions can be integrated from the infinitesimal inequalities to yield the finite inequalities in regions of analyticity for the correlators .",
    "hence , when the infinitesimal inequalities hold in the neighborhood of a fixed region @xmath13 , they automatically hold for all the domain of analyticity .",
    "these domains of analyticity are broken by phase transitions in the entropy .",
    "our results give a negative answer for the general validity of conditional positivity for the holographic entanglement entropy .",
    "the theme of minimal surfaces in ads establishes a natural connection with wilson loop operators .",
    "maldacena s correspondence gives a geometric prescription for the correlators of wilson loops in a nontrivial interacting theory , the large n limit of @xmath99 @xmath100 super - yang - mills gauge theories in four dimensions @xcite .",
    "in euclidean space and in the the large thooft coupling limit @xmath101 we have @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the ( single component ) loop , and @xmath104 is the minimal area of a bulk two - dimensional surface whose boundary coincides with @xmath103 .",
    "this is independent of @xmath105 at leading order , and @xmath106 is a non exponential correction .",
    "it is then interesting to look at the way the quantum mechanical positivity property ( [ det1 ] ) is realized for wilson loops in this context .    in the next section we review this issue .",
    "we start discussing positivity in the broader context of the semi - classical and in large n limits .",
    "we recall large n wilson loops are  classical operators  in the interpretation of large n theories as classical limits .",
    "we show some exponential of classical operators lead to infinite divisible correlation matrices .",
    "this is analogous to the central limit of probability theory .",
    "we then discuss large n wilson loops highlighting the deep differences between the entropy and wilson loop behaviors as expansions in @xmath105 and @xmath107 .",
    "we show the linear triangle inequality for the minimal areas is enough to satisfy positivity at the leading order in large @xmath105 and @xmath107 , and no higher order polynomial inequalities are in principle required to hold for the minimal areas for wilson loops .",
    "in section 3 we prove positivity properties spread on the domain of analyticity of correlation functions . in section 4",
    "we analyze known exact examples of entanglement entropy in qft and check conditional positivity . in section 5",
    "we check the geometrical inequalities ( [ seiq ] ) for exact solutions of minimal surfaces in ads .",
    "finally , we end with a discussion of the results .",
    "the large n limits can be understood in the same terms as the classical limit of quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "then we first look at infinite divisibility in the semi classical limit .",
    "consider evaluating the expectation value in ordinary quantum mechanics in the euclidean framework @xmath108}{\\hbar}}q(-t_1)q(t_2)}{\\int { \\cal d } q(t)\\ , e^{-\\frac{s[q(t)]}{\\hbar}}}\\,.\\ ] ] by reflection positivity this has to be a positive definite kernel for positive @xmath109 .",
    "let the minimum of the action be attained for some value @xmath110 . in the @xmath111",
    "limit the action can be expanded around the classical minimum .",

    "then we have @xmath116 positivity for this correlator is trivial to the zero order , but to first order it implies conditional positivity of the kernel @xmath117 @xmath118 the condition on the possible test functions in ( [ refiso ] ) is necessary in order to have an inequality which does not involve the constant zero order term in the correlator ( [ coco ] ) .    in more generality , a matrix @xmath119 is said to be conditionally positive if @xmath120 that is , it is positive for any vector @xmath121 satisfying @xmath122 . in the language of qft @xmath119 is almost a correlator , since it satisfies the positivity inequalities except for a one dimensional subspace .",
    "equivalently , @xmath119 is conditionally positive if there is a vector @xmath123 such that @xmath124 is positive definite .",
    "another equivalent condition is that the matrix @xcite @xmath125 is positive definite .",
    "another aspect of positivity in the semi - classical limit is shown using correlation functions of delta function operators @xmath126 . these force the paths in the functional integral to pass through the point @xmath127 . as a result , in the classical limit",
    ", the correlation functions are dominated by exponentials of the classical action @xmath128 then the reflection positivity inequality for two points boils down to the triangle inequality for the classical action functional , in a way analogous to the one shown in figure ( [ para ] ) for the minimal surfaces .",
    "we have @xmath129 which is equivalent to @xmath130 the triangle inequality is immediate for a real euclidean action , containing at most first derivatives of the fields .",
    "there is a possible failure of the triangle inequalities for higher derivative theories due to boundary terms in non smooth surfaces which are required by the proof .",
    "this is related to the failure of these theories to be unitary .",
    "it is not difficult to convince oneself that the triangle inequality for the euclidean action is all what is required for the positivity of correlator matrices involving several delta function operators , to leading exponential order in @xmath114 .",
    "that is , in the @xmath111 limit , the inequalities for higher order determinants for delta function operators are satisfied provided the two - dimensional determinant inequality holds , since it is the only one homogeneous in @xmath114 .      in this subsection",
    "we comment on the relation between conditional positivity and another property called infinite divisibility , which is related to the central limit theorem .",
    "infinite divisible property is inspired by schur s theorem for positive definite matrices : if @xmath131 is positive definite ( it is hermitian and all its eigenvalues are positive ) then the matrix of the integer powers of the elements @xmath132 is also positive definite .",
    "a positive definite matrix @xmath133 which is equal to the entry - wise @xmath105-power of another positive definite matrix @xmath134 for any @xmath105 ( here @xmath134 depends on @xmath105 ) is called infinite divisible @xcite . in qft",
    ", the infinite divisibility of a correlator , means that its fractional powers also satisfy the positivity conditions a correlator ought to satisfy .",
    "then , these fractional powers can be thought as correlators for operators in another theory , non necessarily the original one .",
    "it is not difficult to show that the positive definite matrix @xmath131 , @xmath135 , is infinite divisible if and only if the matrix of the logarithms of its entries @xmath136 is conditional positive @xcite .",
    "an example of correlators which are powers of other correlators is given by a qft which is the tensor product of identical independent sectors named by @xmath137 .",
    "choosing the correlators of product operators @xmath138    most correlator matrices in qft are not infinite divisible . in principle , this property should be valid only for special type of theories and special types of operators in these theories .",
    "( [ gogo ] ) suggests that in order to have infinite divisibility one has to consider a theory in the limit of a large number of degrees of freedom , and some special kind of operators .",
    "we show in the next section this is the case of some exponential operators in large n theories .",
    "infinite divisibility is also related , and for the same reason which operates in large n theories , to the central limit of probability theory @xcite .",
    "take the probability distribution for a variable @xmath139 which is proportional to the sum of @xmath105 independent variables @xmath121 , with the same distribution @xmath140 .",
    "then the probability distribution @xmath141 for @xmath142 is the @xmath105-fold convolution @xmath143 the expectation value for the exponential @xmath144 ( called the characteristic function of the distribution ) is @xmath145 then , the infinite divisible case for the characteristic functions corresponds exactly to probability distributions which arise from an infinite sum of variables . under the condition that the variance of @xmath146 is finite",
    ", the limit of the sum of infinitely many variables can only be the gaussian distribution , which of course has infinite divisible characteristic function .",
    "this is the central limit theorem .",
    "different central limit distributions are also possible when the variance is non finite .",
    "notice that the characteristic functions satisfy positivity relations which are similar to the ones corresponding to two point correlators in qft : @xmath147 thus , @xmath148 are positive definite matrices , and ( [ seei ] ) means these write as entry - wise @xmath105 powers of other positive definite matrices .",
    "gaussian distributions are analogous to free fields , and the proof of infinite divisibility for the expectation value of exponential operators is direct .",
    "we have for a free field @xmath149 @xmath150 where @xmath151 is the two point function , and @xmath152 is an arbitrary function . then @xmath153 the first equation shows the expectation value of an exponential operator as a power of the expectation value of a different exponential operator in the same theory , and the second equality shows it as an expectation value in a different theory , which is one of @xmath105 independent free fields @xmath154, ... ,@xmath155 , with the same two point function .",

    "otherwise the mutual information would be always subleading in @xmath105 with respect to the entropy , and this is not possible since when the boundaries of @xmath41 and @xmath42 are near the mutual information must tend to twice the entropy .",
    "thus , while there is direct competition between surfaces of different genus for the leading term in the entanglement entropy , this competition occurs at higher order in @xmath218 for correlators of wilson loops .",
    "this is because the contribution of surfaces of higher genus to the wilson loop have additional powers of the string coupling .",
    "wilson loops satisfy a reflection positivity relation analogous to ( [ det2 ] ) , @xmath219 here @xmath220 , @xmath50 is a collection of loops included in the half - space of positive euclidean time , and @xmath221 is the euclidean time - reflected loop corresponding to @xmath222 .",

    "taking the large @xmath105 limit of the inequality ( [ det22 ] ) , and using the expression ( [ wl ] ) for the correlators , we have the conditional positivity of the matrix @xmath225 in the present case , the stronger condition of positivity holds for this matrix . to leading exponential order in @xmath107",
    "this is equivalent to the positivity of @xmath226 or to the infinite series of inequalities @xmath227 it is not difficult to see that due to the large @xmath107 limit all these inequalities collapse to the linear inequality for two regions , which is the case @xmath95 in ( [ nue ] ) , and is the only inequality homogeneous in @xmath107 , @xmath228 this is analogous to ( [ doo ] ) .",
    "the reason for the validity of ( [ doo1 ] ) is again the triangle inequality of the minimal areas , the same reason as in the case of holographic entanglement entropy @xcite .",
    "therefore , at least in the large @xmath107 limit , the positivity of wilson loops holds provided they are given by exponentials of minimal areas with large coefficients , without further requirements on the nature of the surfaces or the metric .",
    "in particular no higher order inequalities such as ( [ seiq ] ) are involved .    according to ( [ det22 ] ) for @xmath95 , a general version of ( [ doo1 ] ) ,",
    "the linear reflection positivity inequality for the logarithm of the expectation value of the wilson loops , @xmath229 is valid in any gauge theory independently of the large n , large @xmath107 limit .",
    "this was discussed for example in @xcite .",
    "it implies the behavior of the wilson loop is bounded between a perimeter and an area law . a generalization inspired in strong",
    "subadditivity has been discussed in @xcite for the case of wilson loops which live in the same two - dimensional plane in the ads - cft context .",
    "since we are considering the large @xmath105 and large @xmath107 limit we can think in rearranging the expansion ( [ wl ] ) to allow for the large @xmath107 limit to be taken first than the large @xmath105 limit . in this case the correlation function of wilson loops is directly dominated by the exponential of the minimal surface , disregarding of the topology of the surface .",
    "it is interesting to note that in this case we are in presence of a different semi - classical limit , with a different parameter @xmath230 rather than @xmath231 . in this limit",
    "the wilson loop should be considered as a delta function operator in the space of loops rather than a classical operator ( in analogy with the discussion at the end of section 2.1 ) , and the correlators are dominated by the exponential of the classical action on the trajectory joining the different points .",
    "the inequality ( [ doo1 ] ) is then analogous to ( [ 24 ] ) , which follows from the triangle inequality for the classical action .",
    "this explains why positivity of ( [ nue ] ) holds in addition to conditional positivity of ( [ uh ] ) .",
    "in this section we analyze the interplay between analyticity and positivity properties .",
    "we have in mind the inequalities for the entropies , but the arguments are generally valid for correlators in any qft .",
    "the positivity inequalities in qft have different formulations .",
    "the inequalities coming directly from positivity of the scalar product in real time ( [ det1 ] ) always involve the product of operators at coinciding points , and the distributional character of the correlation functions appears in a fundamental way .",
    "we are using here the reflection positivity inequalities in euclidean time ( where , on the other hand , the minimal area prescription holds in the ads - cft formulation ) which does not involve correlators for coinciding points ) , but the regions @xmath20 are spatial regions included inside the right wedge @xmath232 in minkowski space , and the reflection operation is the wedge reflection , @xmath233 , @xmath234 , @xmath235 , @xmath236 . ] .",
    "the conditional positivity of the entropies is given by inequalities ( [ seiq ] ) .",
    "according to the general results of section 2 , all the matricial inequalities ( [ seiq ] ) can be summarized as a single relation expressing the conditional positivity of the entropy ( minimal area ) kernel : @xmath237 \\,s(v_1 \\bar{v}_2)\\ , f[v_2]^*\\ge   0\\,,\\hspace{1.5 cm } \\int { \\cal d}v \\,\\,f[v]=0\\,,\\label{loop}\\ ] ] for any functional on regions @xmath238 $ ] with support on the positive time half - space .",
    "the measure in region space is not relevant in ( [ loop ] ) since it can be absorbed in @xmath239 .",
    "( [ seiq ] ) follows from this one by considering @xmath238 $ ] as a sum of localized delta functionals in the different @xmath20 .",
    "( [ loop ] ) follows from ( [ seiq ] ) by taking a discrete approximation to @xmath238 $ ] as a sum of delta functions .    in the following ,",
    "we consider a set of regions described by a finite number of parameters which live in an open set @xmath240 .",
    "let us start with the single parameter case @xmath241 .",
    "( [ loop ] ) then writes @xmath242 where @xmath149 is any test function with support in @xmath243 , and we have written @xmath244 , for the regions @xmath41 and @xmath42 described by one parameter , @xmath146 and @xmath142 respectively ( notice @xmath142 is the parameter corresponding to @xmath42 , not to @xmath245 ) . in order to fulfill the second condition in ( [ loopa ] ) we take @xmath246 .",
    "then , integrating by parts we have @xmath247 where @xmath248 .",
    "therefore , the conditional positivity of @xmath249 becomes the positivity of @xmath250 .",
    "now , we want to see the implications of ( [ loopb ] ) for coordinates in a very small region in the neighborhood of a point @xmath146 .",
    "we assume @xmath251 is real analytic around a point @xmath252 . in this neighborhood",
    "we write any coordinate as @xmath253 .",
    "we use again the discrete version of ( [ loopb ] ) involving only a finite number @xmath254 of points , which follows taking @xmath255 as a sum of localized delta - like wave packets .",
    "we have @xmath256 for any @xmath254 , @xmath257 and @xmath258 with @xmath259 . given a fixed @xmath254 , we choose @xmath260 , with all the @xmath261 different .",
    "we will later take the limit @xmath262 .",
    "then , the matrix @xmath263 for @xmath264 , and @xmath265 , is invertible .",
    "this follows from the vandermonde determinant .",
    "hence , for a fixed @xmath266 and @xmath261 we can choose the @xmath257 such that @xmath267 for @xmath268 is any chosen eigenvector of @xmath269 , with unit norm .",
    "lets call @xmath270 the corresponding eigenvalue . since the @xmath257 are at most of order @xmath271 , the sum @xmath272 for any @xmath273 is then of order @xmath266 at least .",
    "we then have @xmath274 taking the limit @xmath262 , this gives @xmath275 .",
    "this is equivalent to say that the matrix @xmath276 , @xmath277 is positive definite .",
    "therefore , we obtain the infinitesimal inequalities @xmath278 for all @xmath254 . hence , the kernel @xmath279 is positive definite in the space of all @xmath280 .",
    "now , for an analytic function , these infinitesimal inequalities imply the ones for finite values of the displacements from the point @xmath146 . writing ( [ qpuntoaa ] ) as @xmath281 we see this inequality holds",
    "automatically once the infinitesimal inequalities are valid .",
    "the equivalence between the infinitesimal and finite inequalities in the convergence neighborhood of the taylor series have a very important consequence .",
    "once the infinitesimal inequalities hold at a point @xmath146 they automatically hold at any other point in a neighborhood , and then the infinitesimal inequalities hold in any point inside the convergence radius around @xmath146 . regions of validity of the infinitesimal inequalities can then be extended in the same way analyticity domains are extended .",
    "the infinitesimal inequalities have the same domain as the analyticity domain .",
    "the finite inequalities hold ( at least ) provided the points in the correlator matrix are contained in the convergence radius of the taylor expansion around some point in this domain .",
    "since correlation functions are usually analytic in qft , the positivity turns out to be quite a local property .    from ( [ deti ] )",
    "we see the infinitesimal inequalities contain derivatives of the function @xmath250 of all orders .",
    "specifying for the case of a translational invariant entropy which only depends on the euclidean time variable @xmath146 , @xmath282 , the inequalities write @xmath283 more explicitly the first three inequalities read @xmath284 writing @xmath285 we have a simple recurrence rule for the successive inequalities , @xmath286 all these inequalities are clearly independent .",
    "it is not difficult to find solutions of @xmath287 which are not solutions of @xmath288 ( i.e. @xmath289 ) .",
    "perhaps it is interesting to see in a simple example how subtle the inequalities ( [ recurrence ] ) can turn for @xmath290 with large @xmath25 .",
    "take for example the function @xmath291 .",
    "being a correlation function in some qft , gives place to positive definite correlation matrices . then taking @xmath292 , @xmath293 , all the inequalities are satisfied .",
    "now consider writing @xmath294 for some positive @xmath295 .",
    "this is not any more a positive definite function since for large enough @xmath146 it changes sign .",
    "however , for small @xmath146 the positive definite correlator dominates and one can expect the inequalities are satisfied .",
    "a simple calculation shows that @xmath296 changes sign at @xmath297 .",
    "thus , for any @xmath146 there is a negative @xmath296 for large enough @xmath25 .",
    "this is in accordance with the above result on the local character of the inequalities for analytic functions : the non positivity of @xmath298 can be detected with the infinitesimal inequalities at any @xmath146 , no matter how small .",
    "this also shows that the @xmath290 for large @xmath25 are sensitive to smaller disturbances . on the other hand ,",
    "if we consider @xmath299 with positive @xmath295 , this is a positive definite function .",
    "it then follows that the short distance leading term @xmath300 has to be a positive definite function by itself .",
    "this shows that in checking the inequalities , it is also useful to check positivity for the leading short or long distance approximations .",
    "when the region depends on more than one variable a similar analysis can be done .",
    "let us write collectively these variables as @xmath301 . in a similar way as for the one dimensional case ,",
    "the conditional positivity of @xmath302 implies the positivity of the vectorial kernel given by the derivatives of the entropy , @xmath303 .",
    "expanding this in power series around a point @xmath146 we get @xmath304 where we have used the multi - index notation @xmath305 , with @xmath306 , for @xmath307 .",
    "the strategy is the same as for the one dimensional case .",
    "first , we choose the maximum derivative order @xmath308 which will appear in the infinitesimal inequality .",
    "this maximum number of derivatives includes a number of different derivative types @xmath309 given by the combinatorial @xmath310 @xcite .",
    "then , we choose the case of @xmath311 , and the @xmath312 such that @xmath313 is a normalized eigenvector of @xmath314 ( in this matrix the derivative types @xmath309 and @xmath315 belong to the first @xmath254 types ) .",
    "this can be done because it is always possible to choose @xmath316 such that the @xmath317 multidimensional vandermonde matrix @xmath318 is non singular @xcite .",
    "then , the same reasoning as in ( [ arra ] ) leads us to conclude that all the eigenvalues of @xmath314 ( a @xmath319 matrix ) are positive , and this matrix is positive definite .",
    "these are the differential inequalities in the multidimensional case .",
    "again , the differential inequalities imply the finite inequalities in the domain of convergence of the taylor series .",
    "this in turn leads to an automatic extension of the validity of the differential inequalities to all the domain of analyticity .    in order to clarify the discussion , let us be more explicit and look at the example of two variables , @xmath320 .",
    "for each @xmath321 we have that a square matrix of order @xmath322 in the derivatives of @xmath323 is positive definite . however , there may be repeated lines and columns in @xmath314 because of the derivatives in @xmath324 .",
    "since a sub - matrix of a positive definite matrix is also positive definite , we can eliminate these redundant lines .",
    "the first case @xmath325 involves only the type @xmath326 , and contains , due to the @xmath324 derivatives , only first derivatives on each of the entries of @xmath323 , @xmath327 the positivity of this matrix is a consequence of the linear inequality ( [ doo ] ) , and always holds for a minimal surface which is the true minimum , not only an extreme of the area functional .",
    "the second infinitesimal inequality @xmath328 involves the types @xmath326 , @xmath329 and @xmath330 , and contains one or two derivatives in each entry @xmath331 we recognize the upper @xmath332 sub - matrix is just the matrix ( [ 22 ] ) , and the positive definiteness of ( [ doe ] ) entails the one of ( [ 22 ] ) .",
    "however , in the positivity of ( [ doe ] ) , three more inequalities are added .",
    "hence , it is not enough to check the positivity of the determinant but to check the one of all the eigenvalues is necessary .    more generally , the analysis of this section can be generalized to the case of infinitesimal inequalities for correlator matrices ( or conditional positive entropy matrices as we have focused the discussion here ) , of different operators @xmath333 evaluated in the neighborhood of different points @xmath121 ( there may be also different number of parameters determining each @xmath121 ) .",
    "the infinitesimal inequalities imply the finite ones inside the radius of convergence of the taylor expansions .",
    "this provides a further extension of the inequalities , which propagates inside the multidimensional analyticity domain of the correlator matrices .",
    "basically , once positivity holds at some neighborhood of a multi - point @xmath121 , the only obstacles for further expansion have to be sourced by singularities which break up analyticity .",
    "in this section we check conditional positivity of ( minus ) the entanglement entropy in qft using numerical and analytical methods .",
    "the available exact results for the entropy in qft are not many , and involve mainly free fields in low dimensions and simple geometries @xcite .",
    "the numerical tests require high precision , typically around @xmath334 good digits for the @xmath335 defined in the previous section .",
    "this leaves us with a rather restricted scenario , both from the analytical and numerical point of view , and precludes the use of approximations such as the ones obtained by putting models in a lattice .",
    "the studied examples are consistent with conditional positivity of @xmath336 . however , by the above mentioned reasons we are not able to distinguish if this is due to the simple geometries used , or the free character of the models .",
    "in this sense , we have to mention two facts .",
    "the first one is that the counterexamples found for infinitesimal inequalities on the minimal surfaces in the next section occur for more complicated geometries for which there are no pure qft calculations of the entanglement entropy .",
    "these involve the entropies of two disjoint circular regions with different radius .",
    "the one parameter functions which are our best qft cases also seem to be conditional positive in the minimal surface case ( with the difference that only conformal examples are given by the minimal surfaces , while here we have also massive examples ) .",
    "the second commentary is that the case of free fields is up to a certain extent special since in this case the renyi entropies are also found to satisfy the conditional positivity inequalities while this does not hold for some interacting cases we review below .",
    "there is also an indication that the traces @xmath24 with non - integer index @xmath25 might be positive .",
    "if this `` fractionality '' property is correct , extending the positivity to non - integer @xmath25 , it would naturally lead to infinite divisibility of the exponentials of the entropy in free fields .",
    "however , conditional positivity in the free case does not hold for discrete systems .",
    "there is a natural generalization of the reflection positive inequalities applicable to discrete systems @xcite .",
    "we have applied it for free discrete fermions ( though we are not presenting details of this calculation in this paper ) , and have found counterexamples to the inequalities for some numerical examples using random density matrices in low dimensional hilbert spaces ( though conditional positivity holds for a large fraction of the random examples , specially as the dimensions are increased ) . hence",
    ", if conditional positivity holds for free qft , the continuum limit has to be an important ingredient .",
    "the entanglement entropy for an interval of length @xmath337 in two dimensions and any cft is given by @xcite @xmath338 where @xmath339 is the virasoro central charge , and @xmath266 a short distance cutoff .",
    "the logarithm is proportional to the correlation function of massless scalar fields @xmath340 ,",
    "hence it is a conditionally positive function .",
    "we give a direct proof of this in the next section .    on the opposite extreme to the conformal case",
    ", the long distance , large mass leading term for the entropy of an interval in a massive ( interacting ) theory is also known to have a general expression given by @xmath341 where the sum is over the spectrum of massive particles of the theory with masses @xmath342 , and @xmath343 is the bessel function .",
    "this formula has been shown to hold for generic integrable models @xcite , and argued to be valid for any massive two dimensional qft @xcite . for free fields",
    "a direct calculation is in @xcite .",
    "again , we find this entropy is proportional to a correlator .",
    "this is the one of massive free scalar fields in two dimensions .",
    "hence , it is conditionally positive .",
    "in fact , this contribution is positive ( rather than conditionally positive ) since the massive scalar is a well defined field operator .      still in @xmath344 dimensions",

    "the entropy function @xmath345 , with @xmath346 , is known exactly and given by @xcite ( see also @xcite ) @xmath347 where @xmath348 equation ( [ pds ] ) is a non linear ordinary differential equation of the painlev type .",
    "the difference between the fermionic and scalar cases is exclusively due to the boundary conditions on this equation , @xmath349 the functions @xmath350 are not conditionally positive , since their large distance approximation @xmath351 does not satisfy the inequalities .",
    "however , our numerical tests for the entropies ( [ sd ] ) and ( [ ssv ] ) using random interval sizes are compatible with conditional positivity .",
    "it is not easy to attain excellent numerical precision for these integrals except for the case of the dirac field where the solution for the differential equation can be obtained by a series expansion around the origin in terms of powers of @xmath142 and @xmath352 @xcite .",

    "the figure ( [ painleve - fermion ] ) shows a particular case @xmath365 .",
    "as shown in the figure , all the curves @xmath353 look very similar . this may indicate the conditional positivity in this case could be a consequence of the interplay between the recurrence rules ( [ recurrence ] ) for the inequalities and some recurrence relation on the painlev differential equation ( [ pds ] ) .",
    "the same rules ( [ sd ] ) , ( [ ssv ] ) , ( [ rule ] ) and ( [ rulero ] ) relates the entropy and renyi entropies for free fields of any region and space - time dimensions , perhaps pointing to the generality of this relation between conditional positivity for the entropies , renyi entropies , and fractionality in free theories .",
    "it is interesting to note that the exponentials of the painlev - related functions @xmath366 and the entropies , would then belong to the class of positive definite infinite divisible functions .",

    "we place the angular sectors with common vertex in a plane @xmath397 .",

    "because of conformal invariance , we have @xmath417 for some constants @xmath418 , @xmath419 , and a distance cutoff @xmath266 .",
    "in order to obtain the positivity inequalities for single component regions of this kind , we position different regions in the @xmath420 space , with the long sides lying parallel to the @xmath421 direction .",

    "hence , all regions have a common boundary line . because of the cancellation of the boundary lines passing on the point @xmath422 belonging to the regions and their reflected counterparts , the area is a two point function depending on the coordinates @xmath423 of the free boundary line of each region .",
    "we now prove the conditional positivity of minus the function ( [ piro ] ) , where @xmath424 . notice the conditional positivity condition does not take into account the cutoff dependent term in ( [ piro ] )",

    ". we can extend it to @xmath457 $ ] by using @xmath458 .",
    "we consider angular sectors on the plane @xmath459 , of the same size @xmath337 with common vertex at @xmath422 , and common side along the @xmath460 axes .",
    "then , the first two terms in ( [ pisto ] ) are not relevant for the inequalities .",
    "these write @xmath461 for arbitrary @xmath462 with support in @xmath463 $ ] , and @xmath464 .",
    "if we could write @xmath450 as a laplace transform ( perhaps for a distributional or discrete function @xmath465 ) , @xmath466 we could simplify the inequalities as @xmath467 using the same trick as in the previous section .",
    "unfortunately at present we can not understand whether an expression like ( [ exu ] ) is valid .",
    "thus , we can not offer a complete analytical check of these inequalities here .",
    "however , we have checked numerically the functions @xmath468 of the derivatives of @xmath450 which are predicted to be positive by the inequalities ( [ recurrence ] ) .",
    "up to what we have checked , these functions are indeed positive ( see figure [ angle ] ) .",
    "we have also checked the positivity of the determinants using up to @xmath469 random angles entropy matrices .",
    "we consider two coplanar circles of radius @xmath470 and @xmath471 , at a distance @xmath472 , where @xmath473 and @xmath474 are the distances of the circles to the plane @xmath475 .",
    "this case contains objects determined by two parameters , @xmath476 .",
    "the area for two parallel coaxial circles ( rather than coplanar ) was calculated in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this case can be transformed conformally to the one of the two coplanar circles @xcite . taking out a divergent piece proportional to the circles perimeter , the relevant part of the area is conformally invariant .",
    "it is then given as a function of the cross ratio @xmath477 of four points .",
    "we choose @xmath478 and @xmath479 to be the points in the two circles which are at a greatest distance to each other , and @xmath480 and @xmath481 the ones at the minimal distance .",
    "then the cross ratio is @xmath482 .",
    "we have a parametric expression for the area @xcite @xmath483 where @xmath484 and @xmath485 are the complete elliptic integrals of the first kind .",
    "the parameter @xmath146 is related to the geometry of the configuration by the following equation involving the cross ratio @xmath486 @xmath487 where @xmath488 is the complete elliptic integral of the third kind .",
    "we are interested in the solution which describes a surface connecting the two loops . for each @xmath489",
    "there are two solutions of equation ( [ largui ] ) for @xmath146 , but only one gives the minimal area .",
    "this corresponds to the solution with the greater value of @xmath146 ( having @xmath490 ) .",
    "the other solution corresponds to loops having the same orientation , which is not the case appearing in the reflection positivity inequalities ( and it does not satisfy these inequalities ) .",
    "considering the case of circles of equal radius @xmath491 we have that the entropy is a one dimensional function and we evaluate the corresponding functions @xmath290 .",
    "these are shown in figure ( [ paraq ] ) .",
    "this one parameter case seems to lead to a conditional positive function .",
    "then , we consider the full two parameter case , and evaluate the eigenvalues of the matrices in the derivatives discussed in section 4 with respect to both parameters , radius @xmath216 and distance @xmath492 to @xmath475 plane .",
    "the first non trivial matrix ( [ doe ] ) has 5 eigenvalues which we evaluate at the point of equal radius @xmath491 .",
    "we plot these eigenvalues as a function of @xmath486 in figure ( [ auto1 ] ) .",
    "we see this has a negative eigenvalue for @xmath493 .",
    "figure ( [ auto2 ] ) shows the eigenvalues of the matrices at the next order which consists of @xmath494 matrices .",
    "negative eigenvalues appear now for @xmath495 . according to the general theory ,",
    "since the functions are definitely not conditionally positive in this case , the matrices of higher rank should be able to detect negative eigenvalues for @xmath486 as small as we want .",
    "the same analysis can be carried out for the case of two parallel concentric circular wilson loops .",
    "the function of the cross ratio is the same , but this is given as @xmath496 in terms of the radius @xmath470 and @xmath471 of the circles , and their distances @xmath473 and @xmath474 to the @xmath475 plane ( which in this case is assumed parallel to the circles ) .",
    "the results are completely analogous to the ones above .",
    "in fact it can be seen that a conformal transformation commuting with the time reflection operation maps the positivity relations in one case and the other .",
    "hence , we have infinite divisibility for the one parameter case of circles with equal radius , but not for the full two parameter function .",
    "the case of two spheres can be treated similarly .",
    "again the relevant part of the minimal area is conformally invariant and depends on a cross ratio @xmath482 .",
    "the formula for the area can be obtained from the result for two concentric shells @xcite by a conformal transformation .",
    "we have for the mutual information of the two spheres @xmath386 and @xmath387 , @xmath497\\,.\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the connected minimal surface exists for @xmath498 .",
    "we obtain results very similar to the ones of the previous subsection .",
    "the one parameter function for equal radius @xmath491 gives place to ( apparently ) a conditional positive function .",
    "when the spheres are also allowed to vary in size the conditional positivity is lost , and we find negative eigenvalues for the matrices of multidimensional infinitesimal inequalities .",
    "we do not present the relevant figures here since they are in all respect similar to the ones of the last subsection for circular regions .",
    "now we consider regions formed by an arbitrary set of disjoint parallel strips .",
    "the analysis of infinite divisibility will display a curious phenomena , related to the gross - ooguri phase transition @xcite .",
    "we take all long edges on the regions parallel to the @xmath499 direction , with size @xmath337 .",
    "let us call @xmath500 to the lines on the boundary with one orientation and @xmath501 to the lines with the opposite orientation , where @xmath25 is the number of connected components .",
    "in the large @xmath337 limit the relevant piece of the minimal surface will be some choice of all the possible surfaces formed by the union of the minimal surfaces connecting just two lines , one of type @xmath295 and one of type @xmath360 .",
    "this can then be written as @xmath502 , with @xmath503 , the permutation of @xmath504 , producing the minimal area .",
    "this minimal area is just the sum @xmath505 .",
    "let us then think in a correlator involving @xmath8 of these multicomponent wilson loops @xmath506 , @xmath50 .",
    "we are interested in the matrix @xmath507 .",
    "let @xmath20 have @xmath508 boundary lines .",
    "then the minimal area of @xmath509 contains a group of @xmath510 surfaces which cross the @xmath475 plane and are connected to a group of @xmath511 lines in @xmath20 and @xmath511 lines in @xmath51 .",
    "there is also a group of @xmath512 lines in @xmath20 which are connected among themselves , decoupled from @xmath513 . then , suppose that in any of the correlators involving @xmath20 in the matrix , the same group of lines of @xmath20 are connected among themselves .",
    "the contribution of these lines is necessarily the same in all the correlators involving @xmath20 in the correlator matrix in question .",
    "let us call this contribution @xmath123 .",
    "now suppose the same happens for all the regions @xmath514 , that is , all the minimal surfaces in the correlator matrix elements @xmath515 which contain @xmath514 always has the same subset of the lines of @xmath514 which are connected among themselves .",
    "then we write @xmath516 where @xmath517 contains the contribution from the surfaces which cross the @xmath475 plane .",
    "( [ tercio ] ) then tells that @xmath518 is conditionally positive if and only if @xmath519 is conditionally positive .",
    "in this situation , the number of surfaces which cross @xmath520 must be the same in all correlator in the matrix , and hence @xmath521 is independent of @xmath522 . in this case",
    "the problem is simplified , we can forget about the disconnected pieces and think all lines are connected across @xmath475 by the minimal surface , and all loops have the same number of lines @xmath523 .",
    "once we have disposed off the disconnected pieces , we prove infinite divisibility under the following conditions : for all @xmath522 we require there is a smooth transformation @xmath524 , for @xmath525 $ ] , such that @xmath526 , @xmath527 .",
    "this requires in particular that all the regions have the same topology .",
    "further , we ask these transformations to form a group under concatenation of mappings , @xmath528 . and",
    "finally , but most importantly , we require that the sequence of minimal surfaces corresponding to @xmath529 , going from the minimal surface of @xmath530 to the one of @xmath531 , to be smooth .",
    "that is , the trajectory of minimal surfaces does not have to cross any phase transitions in the middle .",
    "in particular , the minimal surfaces on the correlator matrix must belong the same homotopy class of minimal surfaces .",
    "it is immediate that this condition implies for the kind of loops we are considering here that the minimal surfaces connect only homologous lines .",
    "more clearly , let us name the lines in @xmath20 as @xmath532 and @xmath533 .",
    "the conditions above imply we can choose the names of the lines such that in the minimal surface of @xmath534 the line @xmath535 is connected with @xmath536 , and @xmath537 with @xmath538 , for all @xmath539 . with this naming of lines , all the minimal surfaces of the correlator matrix connect the @xmath540 lines of type @xmath295 , and @xmath360 among themselves",
    ". then we can write @xmath541 this is a sum of conditionally positive matrices and then conditional positive .",
    "conditional positivity can not be proved in the case where the surfaces involved in the correlator matrix are separated by phase transitions , and some numerical examples show that generically it does not hold in these cases .",
    "then , we can think that for more general cases than the one studied here the conditional positivity , except for the disconnected components , requires the minimal surfaces in the correlator matrix to lie in the same sector in the sense specified above . notice that this does not exclude any topology for the minimal surfaces involved in the correlator .",
    "generally , the conditions can always be achieved if the loops participating in the correlation matrix lie in some sufficiently small neighborhood of a given loop @xmath13 . however , even in this cases without phase transitions we have already found some counterexamples of the inequalities in section 5.3 .",
    "motivated by the positivity relations satisfied by the integer @xmath25 index renyi entropies , and a natural conjecture about the path integral representation for the @xmath0 limit , we have checked whether the entanglement entropy gives place to conditionally positive correlation functions .",
    "we could not find counterexamples of the inequalities ( [ seiq ] ) among the few known exact qft results .",
    "this is not so for the minimal areas of the holographic entanglement entropies where we found counterexamples for the case of two spheres or circles of different radius . in this case , the two parameter infinitesimal inequalities fail .",
    "the relation between analyticity and positivity then implies that the inequalities have to fail in the whole domain of holomorphy of the two variable correlator .",
    "we have also found phase transitions are a source of violations of the inequalities for multicomponent regions .",
    "a question which remains open is the status of the conditional positivity inequalities for the entropy in qft . in the light of the results for minimal surfaces ,",
    "the evidence in favor of the inequalities in qft is quite weak .",
    "on one hand , most of the discussed cases refer to entanglement entropies for free theories , which have there own special properties and relations to the renyi entropies . on the other , for the simple geometries analyzed , the minimal areas also obey the inequalities .",
    "the entanglement entropy for two spheres is not known exactly for a qft yet .",
    "of course , a positive answer for the infinite divisible property of the entanglement entropy in qft would mean the holographic entropy ansatz has to be modified for some geometries .",
    "perhaps the full solution of the entanglement entropy for a simple geometry such as the case of two intervals in general cft would be enough to settle this question .    another interesting question is the direct mechanism ( either in the context of qft or a purely geometric one ) behind the validity of the inequalities in the one - parameter functions discussed in this paper . indeed , we have found evidence indicating that several non trivial functions are conditional positive , obeying an infinite series of inequalities on the function derivatives .",
    "this includes minus the entropies of one interval and one angular sector for free scalar and fermions , and the minimal areas corresponding to angular sectors , and pairs of circles and spheres of equal radius . in terms of the minimal areas",
    "the conditional positivity property is rather peculiar .",
    "for example it is easy to check it does not hold for ordinary geodesics in ads , but only for the limit of geodesics starting and ending at the boundary .",
    "one possible explanation could reside in the interplay between the positivity recurrence relations and some unknown differential recurrence relations for these functions . on the minimal surfaces",
    "these examples of infinite divisibility may be hinting to the validity for the small angle path integral representation of the entropy in these geometries .",
    "it would be particularly interesting to understand and generalize this enlargement of cases beyond the single sphere and the plane .",
    "it has been discussed in the literature that the small angle path integral representation is a weakness in fursaev s proof of ryu - takayanagi proposal for holographic entanglement entropy @xcite .",
    "we have further found it seems to involve contradiction for certain geometries . on the qft side the assumptions",
    "on which the proof is based lead to infinite divisibility , but the holographic result is in general not infinite divisible .",
