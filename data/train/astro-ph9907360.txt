    "kilohertz quasi - periodic oscillations ( kqpo ) have been discovered by the rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) in a number of low mass x - ray binaries ( strohmayer 1996 ) .",
    "the existence of two observed peaks with frequencies @xmath7 and @xmath13 in the upper part of the qpo spectrum became a natural starting point in modeling the phenomenon .",
    "attempts have been made to relate @xmath7 , @xmath13 and the peak difference frequency @xmath14 with the neutron star spin and possible keplerian motion of the hot matter surrounding the star [ see origin of keplerian motion discussed in titarchuk , lapidus & muslimov 1998 ( hereafter tlm ) and titarchuk & osherovich 1999 ] .    in the beat frequency model , the burst oscillations and the khz peak separation @xmath1",
    "are both considered to be close to the neutron star spin frequency and thus @xmath1 is predicted to be constant ( see , e.g. , review by van der klis 1998 ) .",
    "however , recent observations of khz qpo s in sco x-1 , 4u 1608 - 52 and 4u 1702 - 429 showed that @xmath1 decreases systematically when @xmath7 and @xmath13 increases ( van der klis et al .",
    "1997 ; mendez et al . 1998",
    "; markwardt , strohmayer & swank 1999 ) .",
    "indications of such a decrease was found by wijnands et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and ford et al .",
    "( 1998 ) for 4u 1735 - 44 as well .",
    "psaltis et al .",
    "( 1998 ) showed that the measured @xmath1 in all other known sources is consistent with the values found in sco x-1 and 4u 1608 - 52 .",
    "these sources have become standards for comparison between the khz qpo phenomena in different sources because of the high accuracy of measurements and the wide range of values of @xmath7 and @xmath13 available . for sco x-1 and 4u 1608 - 52 , @xmath15 changes from @xmath16 hz to @xmath17 hz when @xmath18 changes from @xmath19 hz to @xmath20 hz    in the lower part of the sco x-1 spectra , van der klis et al .",
    "( 1997 ) found two frequencies @xmath8 hz ( referred to below as @xmath21 ) and @xmath9 hz which also slowly increase with increase of @xmath7 and @xmath13 ; presumably 90 hz is the second harmonic of @xmath21 .",
    "any consistent model faces a challenging task of describing the dependence of @xmath1 and @xmath22 on @xmath7 and @xmath13 for the available sources .    in the beat - frequency model ( bfm )",
    "considered by miller , lamb & psaltis ( 1998 ) , the khz qpo s are identified with the orbital frequency at the sonic radius and its beat with the neutron star spin , and the lower frequency of horizontal branch oscillations ( hbo ) in z - sources with the beat of the orbital motion at the magnetospheric radius with the neutron star spin . in the general - relativistic ( gr ) precession / apsidal motion discussed by stella and vietri ( 1998,1999 ) , the khz peaks are due to orbital motion and gr apsidal motion of a slightly eccentric orbit , and low - frequency qpo to the lense - thirring precession of the same orbit .",
    "titarchuk and muslimov ( 1997 ) suggested that a set of peaks seen in the khz qpos can be naturally explained in terms of the effect of rotational splitting of the main oscillation frequency in the disk .",
    "the type of peak ( eigenmodes ) is dependent on mode numbers and a parameter describing disk structure . in tlm",
    "the authors argue that this effect of the rotational splitting originated in a disk region identified as the centrifugal barrier ( cb ) region oscilatted in the vertical and radial directions .",
    "the size oscillations of the cb disk region and reprocessing of the disk photons there ( due to comptonization ) led to an oscillation signal .    in this _",
    "letter _ , we take a different approach and we suggest that a khz qpo can be explained as oscillations of large scale inhomogeneities ( hot blobs ) thrown into the neutron star s magnetosphere . participating in the radial oscillations with keplerian frequency @xmath7 , such blobs are simultaneously under the influence of the coriolis force .",
    "the present model is very different than the tlm one where the site of the rotational splitting was associated with the cb disk region .",
    "thus , studying the keplerian oscillator in the rotating frame of reference ( magnetosphere ) , we attempt to relate @xmath1 and @xmath22 with @xmath7 and @xmath13 . in our model",
    ", we compare results of linear theory with the observations for three sources .",
    "we stress the fundamental role of the keplerian frequency ( which we identify with @xmath7 ) and the upper hybrid frequency relation between @xmath7 and @xmath13 . in this first _ letter _ , we depict the main features of the khz qpo phenomena .",
    "the discussion identifies some limitations of our approach and suggests further directions of the research we shall pursue .",
    "we assume that the interplay between the centrifugal , gravitational force and magnetic force maintains radial oscillations ( along the axis x ) with the keplerian frequency @xmath23 where g is the gravitational constant , m is the mass of the compact object and r is the radius of an orbit .",
    "self - similar spheromak - type models of a magnetic atmosphere can serve as an example of the exact time dependent mhd solutions in which non - radial equilibrium is maintained by magnetic force , while all motion is strictly radial ( farrugia et al . 1995 and references there in ) . taking the magnetospheric rotation with angular velocity @xmath24 ( not perpendicular to the plane of the equatorial disk ) , the small amplitude oscillations of such a blob thrown into the magnetosphere are described by equations ( landau and lifshitz , 1960 ) @xmath25 @xmath26 @xmath27 where @xmath12 is the angle between @xmath28 and the vector normal to the plane of radial oscillations , y is the azimuthal component of the displacement vector and z is the vertical component which is perpendicular to the plane of keplerian oscillations .",
    "the dispersion relation for the frequency @xmath29 @xmath30=0 \\label{six}\\ ] ] besides the non - oscillating mode ( @xmath31 ) , describes two spectral branches ( eigenmodes ) , high and low : @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the analog of the upper hybrid frequency @xmath34 in plasma physics ( akhiezer et al .",
    ", 1975 ; benson 1977 ) .",
    "when the angle @xmath12 is small ( as we believe is indeed our case ) : @xmath35 is related with the radial eigenmode and @xmath36 is related with the vertical eigenmode . for @xmath37 , corrections for @xmath38",
    "are of the second order in @xmath12 , but for @xmath39 , the angle dependent term is the main term .",
    "according to formula ( 7 ) @xmath40 is the rotational frequency , which , for the highly conductive plasma in the case of corotation , should be approximately constant ( @xmath41 ) . interpreting the two frequencies in the upper part of the khz spectrum as @xmath7 and @xmath13 [ where @xmath42 for sco x-1 , we plotted in figure 1 , @xmath43 versus @xmath44 ( solid circles ) .",
    "indeed , one may notice that as a first approximation @xmath6 the slow ( but systematic ) variation of @xmath45 is between 330 and 350 hz which should be compared with the variation by a factor of 1.5 for @xmath14 for the same range of @xmath7 .",
    "if the magnetosphere corotates with the neutron star ( solid body rotation ) , then our procedure would determine the spin rotation of the star .",
    "in fact , there is a differential rotation profile which depends on the magnetic field @xmath46 which can be presented in terms of the chandrasekhar potential @xmath47 ( chandrasekhar , 1956 ) @xmath48 where @xmath49 , @xmath50 is the colatitude in the spherical system of coordinates and @xmath51 is a function of @xmath47 only . for a combination of dipole , quadrupole and octupole fields @xmath52 \\label{thirteen}\\ ] ] where @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 are constants . for a highly conductive plasma",
    ", the mhd induction equation leads to the iso - rotation theorem of ferraro ( see alfvn and falthammar , 1963 ) which in our notation means that @xmath5 is a function of @xmath47 only .",
    "following a recent suggestion of osherovich and gliner ( 1999 ) , we assume that in the vicinity of a magnetic star @xmath56 has a maximum and therefore can be presented as @xmath57 where @xmath58 and @xmath59 are constants . since in the equatorial plane ( @xmath60 ) , according to ( 12 ) , the quadrupole term does not contribute to @xmath47 , from formula ( 13 ) we find @xmath61 where @xmath62 and @xmath63 are positive constants . expressing @xmath64 through the keplerian frequency @xmath65 from equation ( 1 ) , we find that formula ( 14 ) leads to the following presentation for @xmath5 : @xmath66 where @xmath67 ( not a free parameter because the radial part of the expansion is a full square of @xmath68 and @xmath69 with new positive constants @xmath70 and @xmath71 ) .",
    "the fit for sco x-1 ( solid line in figure 1 ) by formula ( 16 ) demonstrates the agreement of the proposed model with the data . indeed , for sco x-1 , we find @xmath72 hz , @xmath73 hz@xmath74 , @xmath75 hz@xmath76 and @xmath77 hz@xmath78 with high @xmath79 . in our fitting procedure , @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 are treated as four free parameters , i.e. , the relation between @xmath82 and the two constants @xmath81 and @xmath83 is not enforced .",
    "the fact that the derived @xmath82 indeed satisfies the relation @xmath67 shows the internal consistency of the model .",
    "three available data points for the 4u 1702 - 429 source are consistent with a constant value of rotation frequency @xmath84 hz , but the small number of data points does not allow us to recover the profile of @xmath85 .",
    "however , the fit of 4u 1608 - 52 , shown in figure 2 , demonstrates that the excellent agreement between our model and observations for sco x-1 is not accidental . for 4u 1608 - 52",
    ", we found @xmath72 hz , @xmath86 hz@xmath87 , @xmath88 hz@xmath76 and @xmath89 hz@xmath78 with @xmath90 .",
    "sco x-1 allows us to check the prediction of the model for @xmath22 [ formula ( 10 ) ] .",
    "taking the profile @xmath85 , presented in figure 1 , we plot @xmath91 in figure 3 .",
    "choosing @xmath92 , we found that our plot for @xmath93 and @xmath94 fit the data for the observed frequencies of @xmath95 hz and @xmath96 hz , respectively . from these results , we conclude that the rotational axis of sco x-1 and the normal to the plane of radial oscillations do not coincide but are separated by @xmath97 .",
    "the main thrust of this work is based on the hypothesis that two of the observed frequencies in the upper part of the khz qpo spectrum are the keplerian frequency ( @xmath7 ) and the upper hybrid frequency ( @xmath13 ) of the keplerian oscillator in the frame of reference rotating with the angular frequency @xmath5 . for three sources",
    ", we showed that @xmath5 calculated according to the formula @xmath98 changes with @xmath7 significantly less than @xmath14 , suggesting approximately constant rotation of the star s magnetosphere .",
    "the detailed profile of @xmath5 is successfully modeled as a function of @xmath99 within the dipole - quadrupole - octupole approximation of the magnetic field for sco x-1 and for 4u 1608 - 52 . for sco x-1 , the derived @xmath85",
    "is used to compare predictions of the model for the lower branch frequency @xmath21 with observations of @xmath95 hz and @xmath9 hz ( presumably @xmath100 ) .",
    "the last fit is done with only one unknown parameter @xmath12 ( angle between the @xmath28 and the normal vector to the plane of keplerian oscillations ) .    a good fit for @xmath22 and",
    "@xmath101 confirmed the suggested model and revealed the expectedly small angle @xmath92 .",
    "the profile for @xmath85 has been modeled strictly in the equatorial plane ( @xmath60 ) for the ideally aligned rotator ( @xmath102 ) . with @xmath103 , the next approximation will reveal the asymmetry of the qpo spectrum due to the quadrupole term .",
    "it has been shown ( osherovich , tzur and gliner , 1984 ) for the solar corona that the quadrupole term introduces north - south asymmetry in the makeup of the magnetic atmosphere surrounding a gravitating object .",
    "we shall pursue a similar study for the neutron star with the expectation of finding a signature of such asymmetry in the khz qpo .",
    "recent measurements show that the octupole field is comparable to the global dipole field near the sun , while the quadrupole field contributes @xmath104 of the total field ( wang et al . , 1997 ; osherovich et al . , 1999",
    ") .    in this",
    "_ letter _ , we restrict the scope of the work to a model for the linear keplerian oscillator .",
    "the presence of the second harmonic ( @xmath96 hz ) of the @xmath95 hz mode , noticed by van der klis et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , strongly suggests that a weakly nonlinear model is desirable . some oscillations below @xmath22 ( for sco x-1 oscillations with frequencies @xmath105 hz ) we attribute to the innermost edge of the keplerian disk , which adjusts itself to the rotating central object ( i.e. , neutron star ) .",
    "the physics of these oscillations related to accreting matter with a large angular momentum is outside the scope of this letter and it have been described in a separate paper ( titarchuk & osherovich 1999 ) .",

    "benson for help in the preparation of this paper and discussions and for fruitful suggestions by the referee .",
