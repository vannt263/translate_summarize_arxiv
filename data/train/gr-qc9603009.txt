    "@xmath6    from observations results that @xmath5 is a non - zero quantity .",
    "the first exact solution of equations ( 1 ) was found schwarzschild in 1915 . in the schwarzschild metrics [ 2 ]",
    "the scalar curvature @xmath7 outside of the area of the matter object has the value :    @xmath8    from relations ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) it results :    @xmath9 this fact was interpreted as a non - localisation of the gravitation energy .",
    "the mathematical and physical fundamentals of _ the standard model of universe _ is represented by the friedmann equations of the dynamics of homogeneous and isotropic relativistic universe [ 3 , 4 ] . using the robertson - walker metrics [ 5 - 9 ] they can be written in the form :    @xmath10    @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the gauge factor , @xmath13 is the mass density , @xmath14 is the curvature coefficient , @xmath15 is the cosmological member , and @xmath16 is the pressure .",
    "the friedmann - robertson - walker equations ( 5a ) and ( 5b ) are the applications of the einstein equations ( 1 ) to the whole of the universe in the newton approximation , under supplementary assumptions introduced into relativistic cosmology by einstein [ 10 ] and de sitter [ 11 ] and generalized by friedmann [ 3 , 4 ] .",
    "the total energy of universe is exactly zero [ 12 , p. 129 ] . in the general theory of relativity the curvature of space - time",
    "is determined by the energy density @xmath17 plus three - multiple of the pressure @xmath18 .",
    "therefore , in the ( flat ) expansive nondecelerative ( homogeneous and isotropic relativistic ) universe ( with total zero and local non - zero energy ) ( enu ) holds the relation : @xmath19 i.e. such a universe is determined by the state equation [ 13 ] :    @xmath20    the friedmann - robertson - walker equations ( 5a ) and ( 5b ) describe all theoretically possible models of the homogeneous and isotropic relativistic universe , therefore , the model of enu determined by the state equation ( 6 ) must be their solution .",
    "the state equation ( 6 ) is the solution of equations ( 5a ) and ( 5b ) only with @xmath21 and @xmath22 therefore , the enu is the only model of homogeneous and isotropic relativistic universe with total zero and local non - zero energy [ 13 ] .    in the enu - determined by the friedmann - robertson - walker equations ( 5a ) and ( 5b ) with @xmath21 and @xmath23 and the state equation ( 6 ) - hold relations [ 13 - 15 ] :    @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the cosmological time and",

    "therefore , the velocity of radial expansion @xmath42 , corresponding to the distance @xmath43 , is given by the relation [ 17 ] :    @xmath44    from the relations ( 10)-(12 ) it follows [ 17 ] :    @xmath45    from the relation ( 13 ) follows the relation ( 8) .",
    "the gravitation interaction theoretically acts in the range of the whole universe .",
    "however , from the relations ( 8) and ( 13 ) results that in the enu in an arbitrary large sphere with the ( critical ) energy density of the whole enu @xmath30 ( 8) the gravitation interaction is exactly compensated by its expansion .",
    "the gravitation energy density @xmath5 in the newton approximation can be expressed by the relation :    @xmath46    from the relations ( 8) and ( 14 ) it follows that in the enu the gravitation action of a body can manifest itself only up to the distance in which the absolute value of gravitation energy density of its field @xmath47 ( 14 ) is larger than the ( critical ) energy density of the whole enu @xmath30 ( 8) [ 17 ] .",
    "this means that in the enu the equations ( 8) and ( 14 ) determine the effective gravitation range @xmath48 of an arbitrary body with the gravitation radius @xmath49 :    @xmath50",
    "the relation ( 14 ) is a good approximation for the whole enu , but it does not allow to localize the gravitation energy .    according to the relations ( 7)-(9 ) ,",
    "the energy in enu is the function of time , therefore , its determination requires a metrics taking into account also the change of energy in time .",
    "such a property has the metrics of vaidya [ 18 ] , which contains the metrics of schwarzschild [ 2 ] as a special partial solution .    after introducing the vaidya spinor components to the riemann tensor and the vaidya spinor coefficients to the ricci tensor , the field metrics",

    "this means that the absolute value of gravitation energy density of the whole enu @xmath63 ( 21 ) is exactly equal to the ( critical ) energy density of the whole enu @xmath64 ( 8) , i.e. the total energy of enu @xmath65 is exactly equal to zero [ 21 ] .    comparing the relations ( 20 ) and ( 21 ) in the enu",
