    "microwave radiation - induced zero - resistance states@xcite are an interesting phenomenon in two dimensional electron systems ( 2des ) because , for example , coincidence of microwave - induced zero - resistance states with quantum hall zero - resistance states leads to the extinction of the associated quantum hall plateaus.@xcite the microwave radiation - induced magneto - resistance oscillations that lead into the zero - resistance states include characteristic traits such as periodicity in @xmath0,@xcite a 1/4-cycle shift,@xcite , distinctive sensitivity to temperature and microwave power,@xcite along with other specific features.@xcite .",
    "the linear - polarization - sensitivity of these oscillations has been a topic of intensive recent experimental study @xcite ; these studies have shown that the amplitude of microwave radiation - induced magnetoresistance oscillations changes periodically with the linear microwave polarization angle .",
    "looking at the linear polarization characteristics in greater detail , at fixed temperature and polarization angle the amplitude of microwave radiation - induced magnetoresistance oscillations increases with the microwave power .",
    "it follows , approximately,@xcite @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the amplitude of microwave radiation - induced magnetoresistance oscillations , @xmath3 and @xmath4 are constants and @xmath5 is microwave power . at fixed temperature and microwave power , amplitude of microwave radiation - induced magnetoresistance oscillations",
    "changes sinusoidally with the linear polarization angle .",
    "the experimental results have shown that the longitudinal resistance @xmath6 vs linear polarization angle @xmath7 follows a cosine square function@xcite , i.e. , @xmath8 ( @xmath2 and @xmath9 are constants , @xmath10 is the phase shift , which depend on microwave frequency@xcite ) , at low microwave power .",
    "note tha this angular dependence can also be rewritten as @xmath11 $ ] .",
    "deviation from this functional form was noted for higher microwave intensities .    from the theoretical point of view@xcite , there are many approaches to understand the physics of the microwave radiation - induced magnetoresistance oscillations .",
    "these include the radiation - assisted indirect inter - landau - level scattering by phonons and impurities ( the displacement model)@xcite , the periodic motion of the electron orbit centers under irradiation ( the radiation driven electron orbit model)@xcite , and a radiation - induced steady state non - equilibrium distribution ( the inelastic model)@xcite . among these approaches ,",
    "the radiation driven electron orbit model intensively considered temperature@xcite , microwave power@xcite and microwave polarization direction@xcite as factors that could change the amplitude of microwave radiation - induced magnetoresistance oscillations . here , we report an experimental study of microwave power and linear polarization angle dependence of the radiation - induced magnetoresistance oscillations and compare the results with the predictions of the radiation driven electron orbit model .",
    "the comparison provides new understanding of the experimental results at high microwave powers .",
    "the radiation driven electron orbit model@xcite was developed to explain the observed diagonal resistance , @xmath6 , of an irradiated 2des at low magnetic field , @xmath12 , with @xmath12 in the z - direction , perpendicular to the 2des . here",
    ", electrons behave as 2d quantum oscillator in the @xmath13 plane that contains the 2des .",
    "the system is also subjected to a dc electric field in the x - direction ( @xmath14 ) , the transport direction , and microwave radiation that is linearly polarized at different angles ( @xmath7 ) with respect to the transport direction ( @xmath15-direction ) .",
    "the radiation electric field is given by @xmath16 where @xmath17 , @xmath18 are the amplitudes of the mw field and @xmath19 the frequency .",
    "thus , @xmath7 is given by @xmath20 .",
    "the corresponding electronic hamiltonian can be exactly solved@xcite obtaining a solution for the total wave function , @xmath21\\ ] ] where @xmath22 are fock - darwin states , @xmath23 is the center of the orbit for the electron motion , and @xmath24 ( for the x - coordinate ) and @xmath25 ( for the y - coordinate ) are the solutions for a @xmath26 driven 2d harmonic oscillator ( classical uniform circular motion ) .",
    "the expressions for an arbitrary angle @xmath7 are given by @xmath27\\frac{ee_{0}\\cos wt}{m^{*}\\sqrt{(w_{c}^{2}-w^{2})^{2}+\\gamma^{4 } } } = a_{x}\\cos wt   \\nonumber\\\\ \\\\",
    "b(t)&=&\\left[\\frac{w\\sqrt{w^{2}\\cos^{2 } \\theta + w_{c}^{2}\\sin^{2 } \\theta}+(w_{c}^{2}-w^{2})\\cos\\theta}{ww_{c}}\\right]\\frac{ee_{0}\\sin wt}{m^{*}\\sqrt{(w_{c}^{2}-w^{2})^{2}+\\gamma^{4 } } } = a_{y}\\sin wt\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath28 is the electron charge , @xmath29 is a damping factor for the electronic interaction with acoustic phonons , @xmath30 the cyclotron frequency and @xmath31 is the total amplitude of the radiation electric field .",
    "these two latter equations give us the equation of an ellipse , @xmath32 .",
    "then , the first finding of this theoretical model is that according to the expressions for @xmath24 and @xmath25 , the center of the electron orbit performs a classical elliptical trajectory in the @xmath13 plane driven by radiation ( see inset of fig .",
    "4 ) . this is reflected in the x and y directions as harmonic oscillatory motions with the same frequency as radiation . in this elliptical motion electrons in their orbits interact with the lattice ions being damped and emitting acoustic phonons ; in the @xmath24 and @xmath25 expressions , @xmath29 represents this damping .",
    "the above expressions for @xmath24 and @xmath25 are obtained for a infinite 2des .",
    "but if we are dealing with finite samples the expressions can be slightly different because the edges can play an important role",
    ". then the key issue of symmetry / asymmetry of the sample has to be considered in regards of the polarization sensitivity . in the experiments the samples were rectangular - shaped or hall bars",
    "( asymmetric samples ) and the @xmath6 measurements were obtained at each of the longest sides of the sample between two lateral contacts . according to this experimental set up",
    ", we observe that along the classical elliptical trajectories the driven motion in the @xmath15 direction presents fewer restrictions since the top and bottom sample edges are far from the @xmath6 measurement points ( side contacts ) .",
    "thus , there is no @xmath33 constraints due to the existence of edges .",
    "however for the driven motion in the @xmath34 direction , the restrictions are very important due to the presence of the edges from the very first moment .",
    "the lateral edges impede or make more difficult the mw - driven classical motion of the electron orbits in the @xmath34 direction .",
    "the effect is as if the @xmath18 component of the microwave electric field were much less efficient in coupling and driving the electrons than the @xmath17 component .",
    "this situation has to be reflected in the @xmath24 and @xmath25 expressions .",
    "thus , we have phenomenologically introduced an asymmetry factor @xmath35 to deal with this important scenario affecting the obtained @xmath6 . since for a more intense radiation electric field",
    "@xmath31 , the motion in @xmath34 is increasingly hindered we have introduced @xmath36 where @xmath37 is a constant that tends to @xmath38 for symmetric samples and then @xmath24 reads : @xmath39\\frac{ee_{0 } } { m^{*}\\sqrt{(w_{c}^{2}-w^{2})^{2}+\\gamma^{4 } } } \\cos wt = a^{*}_{x } \\cos wt\\ ] ]    this @xmath40 behavior has a deep impact on the charged impurity scattering and in turn in the conductivity .",
    "thus , first we calculate the impurity scattering rate @xmath41 between two driven landau states @xmath42 , and @xmath43@xcite . in order to calculate the electron drift velocity ,",
    "next we find the average effective distance advanced by the electron in every scattering jump@xcite : @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the flight time that is strictly the time it takes the electron to go from the initial orbit to the final one .",
    "this time is part of the scattering time , @xmath46 , that is normally defined as the average time between scattering events and equal to the inverse of the scattering rate .",
    "@xmath47 is the average advanced distance without radiation .",
    "finally the longitudinal conductivity @xmath48 is given by : @xmath49 being @xmath50 the energy .",
    "to obtain @xmath6 we use the relation @xmath51 , where @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "therefore , @xmath54\\frac{ee_{0 } } { m^{*}\\sqrt{(w_{c}^{2}-w^{2})^{2}+\\gamma^{4 } } }    \\sin w\\tau\\ ] ]",
    "experiments were carried out on high mobility gaas / algaas hetero - structure hall bar samples .",
    "the samples were placed on a long cylindrical waveguide sample holder and loaded into a variable temperature insert ( vti ) inside the bore of a superconducting solenoid magnet .",
    "the high mobility condition was achieved in the 2des by brief illumination with a red light - emitting diode at low temperature . a microwave launcher at the top of the sample holder excited microwaves within the cylindrical waveguide .",
    "the angle between the long axis of hall bar sample and the antenna in the microwave launcher is defined as the linear polarization angle .",
    "this linear polarization angle could be changed by rotating the microwave launcher outside the cryostat .",
    "low frequency lock - in techniques were utilized to measure the diagonal and off - diagonal response of the sample .    at 1.5 k ,",
    "the longitudinal resistance @xmath6 vs magnetic field @xmath12 , exhibits strong microwave radiation - induced magnetoresistance oscillations , see fig .",
    "1 , for frequency @xmath55 = 45.2 ghz , source power , @xmath5 = 4 mw , and vanishing linear polarization , i.e. @xmath56 . the figure shows that maxima and minima up to the fourth order are observable below 0.15 t. the first maxima and minima are designated as @xmath57 and @xmath58 . in figs . 2 and 3",
    ", we examine the linear polarization angle dependence and the microwave power dependence at these extrema .",
    "figure 2 exhibits @xmath6 vs linear polarization angle @xmath7 at different microwave powers at @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "the common features of the data at different microwave powers are : a ) they exhibit an oscillatory lineshape and b ) the peaks and valleys at all powers occur at the same angle . at low microwave power ,",
    "the oscillating curve could be represented by a simple sinusoidal function . however , as microwave power increases , the amplitude of the oscillatory curves increases and , at the same time , deviations from the sinusoidal profile become observable and more prominent .",
    "for instance , at @xmath5= 4 mw , the maxima are relatively rounded and minima are relatively sharp for @xmath57 and , in contrast , the maxima are sharp and minima are rounded for @xmath58 . at the other oscillatory extrema in the @xmath6 vs @xmath12 trace at lower @xmath12 , see fig . 1 ,",
    "such deviations from the simple sinusoidal behavior were more prominent at the same power .",
    "figure 3 shows @xmath6 vs. @xmath5 at different linear polarization angle @xmath7 for @xmath57 and @xmath58 . for @xmath57 , see fig .",
    "3(a ) , @xmath6 increases non - linearly as the microwave power increases . on the other hand ,",
    "3(b ) , @xmath6 decreases non - linearly with increasing @xmath5 at @xmath58 .",
    "3(a ) and ( b ) , all traces start at the same resistance value at @xmath5=0.01 mw since the ( essentially ) dark resistance is invariant under polarization angle rotation .",
    "in figure 4 , we present calculated results of irradiated @xmath6 versus @xmath12 for a microwave frequency of @xmath59 ghz and power of @xmath60 .",
    "as in the experimental curve of fig .",
    "2 , we obtain , at a temperature of @xmath61 , clear @xmath6 oscillations which turn out to be qualitatively and quantitatively similar to experiment . for the exhibited curve ,",
    "the polarization angle is zero .",
    "the most prominent peak and valley are labelled as @xmath57 and @xmath58 respectively . in the inset of this figure we present a schematic diagram showing the radiation - driven classical trajectories of the guiding center of the electron orbit .",
    "figure 5 exhibits calculated results of irradiated @xmath6 versus linear polarization angle @xmath7 for different microwave powers for peak @xmath57 and valley @xmath58 in panels a ) and b ) respectively .",
    "the microwave frequency is 45.2 ghz and @xmath62 is 1.5 k. the microwave power ranges from 0.01 to 6.0 mw . as in the experimental results of figure 2 , we observe that the @xmath6 curves evolve from a clear sinusoidal profile at low microwave powers to a different profile where , for instance , in upper panel ( @xmath57 ) the peaks broaden and the valleys get sharpened .",
    "similar trend is observable in the lower panel ( @xmath58 ) .",
    "the explanation for this peculiar behavior can be obtained from equation [ 5 ] and the square root between brackets .",
    "when the microwave power ( electric field amplitude @xmath31 ) increases , the factor @xmath63 gets smaller and smaller . as a result , the @xmath6 curve begins to lose its simple sinusoidal profile . at high powers",
    "the latter factor is so small that the @xmath64 factor is predominant and the square root tends to the absolute value of @xmath64 : @xmath65   \\rightarrow \\sqrt{\\cos^{2}\\theta } = abs[\\cos \\theta ] \\ ] ] the profile observed in experiment and calculation for high powers is very similar to the one of the @xmath66 $ ] .",
    "this evolution can be clearly observed in the panel ( c ) of figure 5 .    in figure 6 , we present calculated @xmath6 under radiation versus the microwave power for different polarization angles for peak @xmath57 , upper panel , and for valley @xmath58 , lower panel .",
    "for increasing angles from @xmath67 to @xmath68 the behavior of @xmath57 and @xmath58 are similar in the sense that the corresponding intensity of both becomes smaller and smaller . in other words , for increasing angles the height of the peak decreases and the depth of the valley decreases too .",
    "the theoretical explanation comes from the square root term as before . for increasing angles the cosine term tends to zero becoming predominant the sine term",
    ". however the latter gets smaller for increasing power due to the asymmetry factor .",
    "all curves share one important feature , the non - linearity of @xmath6 versus @xmath5 suggesting a sublinear relation .",
    "this behavior can be straightforward explained with our model in terms of : @xmath69 and then the @xmath6 profile with @xmath5 follows a square root dependence as experiments show .     versus linear polarization angle @xmath7 for the magnetic fields corresponding to the peak @xmath57 ( panel ( a ) ) and valley @xmath58 ( panel ( b ) ) in panel ( c ) we present simulation of the curves evolution with mathematical functions when the @xmath70 term decreases .",
    "the microwave photo - excitation at 45.2 ghz , the microwave power ranges from from 0.01 to 6.0 mw and @xmath62=1.5 k. , width=302 ]",
    "we have presented together experimental- and theoretically - calculated- results concerning the microwave power and linear polarization angle dependence of the microwave irradiated oscillatory magnetoresistance in the gaas / algaas two - dimensional electron system .",
    "experimental results show that , as the microwave power increases , the @xmath6 vs. @xmath7 traces , see fig .",
    "2 , gradually lose the simple sinusoidal profile , as the profile begins to resemble the absolute value of the cosine function .",
    "we presented the theoretical insight to explain this evolution using the radiation - driven electron orbit model , which suggests a profile following @xmath66 $ ] .",
    "intuitively , one can motivate the change in the profile of the @xmath6 vs. @xmath7 curves with increasing power by noting that increasing the power , i.e. , driving the 2des more strongly , most likely increases the harmonic content in the @xmath6 vs. @xmath7 lineshape , which leads to deviations from the simple sinusoidal function proposed for low power in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the low power limit , this theoretical prediction of the radiation driven electron orbit model matched the experimental suggestion of @xmath71 $ ] @xcite .",
    "one might tie together the low power @xmath6 vs. @xmath7 lineshape ( @xmath72 ) with the high power @xmath6 vs. @xmath7 lineshape ( @xmath66 $ ] ) by examining the fourier expansion over the interval @xmath73 $ ] of @xmath66 = ( 2/\\pi ) + ( 4/\\pi ) \\sum_{m=1}^{\\infty } ( ( ( -1)^{m}/(1 - 4m^{2}))cos(2m\\theta)$ ] . if one keeps the lowest order ( @xmath74 ) term , which is the only one likely to be observable at low power , then @xmath66 \\rightarrow ( 2/\\pi)(1   + ( 2/3)cos(2\\theta ) ) \\sim cos^2(\\theta)$ ] .",
