    "massive black hole binaries are expected to be some of the brightest gravitational wave ( gw ) sources for the planned laser interferometer space antenna ( lisa )  @xcite .",
    "this joint esa - nasa mission will search for gws is the band @xmath0 . while the event rates are uncertain , it is likely that there will be at least a few events per year .",
    "massive black hole binaries are a very promising source of gws as we expect them to have integrated signal to noise ratios ( snrs ) in the hundreds to thousands . as well as being very bright , there should be little confusion with other sources ( a problem which plagues galactic binary extraction , and to a lesser extent the extreme mass ratio inspiral sources ) .    there have been many studies looking at parameter estimation for spinning and non - spinning binaries  @xcite , and , more recently , on the development of search algorithms  @xcite . with the exception of refs .",
    "@xcite , these studies have focused on the contribution from the dominant second harmonic of the orbital frequency , and have neglected the influence of the additional harmonics that appear at higher post - newtonian order . the studies that did consider the impact of these higher harmonic corrections ( hhcs ) saw improvements in parameter estimation , but only a few cases were considered .",
    "more extensive studies of the impact of hhcs have appeared in the last year  @xcite , and it has become apparent the effects can vary significantly from source to source .    our goal here is to consider a wider sample of systems , and to elucidate the mechanism by which the hhcs affect parameter estimation .",
    "our most significant finding is that hhcs greatly mitigate the effects of any hardware failures that reduce the instrument to a single interferometry channel  @xcite . indeed ,",
    "when hhcs are included , the science performance with a single channel is comparable to what was found for two channels when hhcs are neglected .",
    "we performed extensive monte carlo simulation for various redshifted chirp masses , with coalescence time @xmath1 , lumiosity distance @xmath2 and all other parameters chosen at random .",
    "results for other distances can be obtained by multiplying our parameter uncertainities by @xmath3 . as sky resolution is an important quantity , we considered 20,000 different sky locations per chirp mass and per mass ratio .",
    "finally , for each chirp mass , we run separate simulations for mass ratios of 1 and 10 .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in sec  ( [ sec : gw ] ) we outline the form of the gravitational waveform at the detector with higher harmonics corrections .",
    "we also give a brief description of the low frequency approximation  @xcite for the lisa response .",
    "( [ sec : pe ] ) contains a brief outline of the main tools used for parameter estimation .",
    "we finish this section with an outline of the monte carlo simulations we carried out . in sec  ( [ sec : hhc ] ) we present results of our analysis on the effect of the higher harmonic corrections for parameter estimation using different redshifted chirp masses and mass ratios .",
    "this is followed in sec  ( [ sec : cb ] ) by an investigation into what correlation breaking between parameters is responsible for the increase in parameter estimation",
    ". the final main section , sec  ( [ sec : ovt ] ) , deals with the effect of losing interferometry links during the mission .",
    "in the low frequency approximation , we can think of lisa as being composed of two orthogonal @xmath4 detectors .",
    "the strain of the gravitational wave ( gw ) in each channel of the lisa detector with both polarizations is given by @xmath5 where the phase shifted time parameter is @xmath6 here , @xmath7 500 secs is the radial distance to the detector guiding center , @xmath8 are the position angles of the source in the sky , @xmath9 , @xmath10 is the lisa modulation frequency and @xmath11 gives the initial ecliptic longitude of the guiding center .",
    "the gw polarizations up to 2-pn order in amplitude corrections are defined by  @xcite @xmath12 .",
    "\\label{eqn : strain}\\ ] ] here @xmath13 is the total mass of the binary , @xmath14 is the reduced mass ratio and @xmath15 is the luminosity distance of the source .",
    "the invariant pn velocity parameter is defined by , @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the 2 pn order orbital frequency for a circular orbit and @xmath18 is the orbital phase which is defined as @xmath19 where the quantity @xmath20 is related to the time to coalescence of the wave , @xmath21 , by @xmath22 and @xmath23 is the orbital phase of the wave at coalescence . all gw phases are then twice the orbital value . for the rest of the paper",
    ", we will work with gw phases .    in eqn  ( [ eqn : strain ] )",
    ", the functions @xmath24 contain the pn corrections to the amplitude and the extra phase harmonics .",
    "the restricted pn waveform corresponds to keeping just the @xmath25 terms .",
    "we should note here that contained in the half integer @xmath24 terms is a factor @xmath26 .",
    "this term has the effect of killing all the odd phase harmonics in the equal mass case .",
    "we can also see the extra frequency harmonics arising due to the @xmath27 terms .    using the wmap values of @xmath28 and a hubble s constant of @xmath29=71 km / s / mpc , the relation between redshift , @xmath30 , and luminosity distance , @xmath15 , is given by @xmath31^{-1/2 }   .\\ ] ]    the functions @xmath32 are the beam pattern functions of the detector given in the low frequency approximation by f^+(t ; , , , ) = , f^(t ; , , , ) = , where @xmath33 is the polarization angle of the wave and @xmath34 or @xmath35 defines the two - arm combination of lisa from which the strain is coming .",
    "the detector pattern functions are given by  @xcite d^+(t ) & = & , d^(t ) = . for two schwarzschild black holes , the above equations governing the evolution of the phase break down even before we reach the last stable circular orbit ( lso ) at @xmath36 .",
    "because of this , we terminate the waveforms at @xmath37 .",
    "the low frequency approximation is an extremely good fit to the full detector response at frequencies of @xmath38 3 mhz  @xcite . in this case",
    "the two channel formalism originally derived by cutler  @xcite corresponds to the construction of optimal orthogonal time delay interferometry ( tdi ) variables @xmath39 using the unequal - arm michelson tdi variables @xmath40 according to @xmath41 in later sections we will refer to the one channel case as @xmath42 and the two channel as @xmath43 .",
    "one of the main tools used in the gw community for the estimation of parameter errors is the fisher information matrix ( fim ) . in the high snr limit",
    ", the inverse of the fim gives the variance - covariance matrix .",
    "the square root of the diagonal elements of the inverse fim give a 1-@xmath44 estimation of the error in our parameter estimation .",
    "for lisa , it has been shown in a number of cases that the fim is a good parameter error estimator when compared with markov chain monte carlo techniques .",
    "for this particular problem , the parameter set we chose to work with is @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the chirp mass , @xmath47 is the reduced mass and all other parameters have been previously defined .",
    "it has been customary to divide this parameter set into intrinsic ( parameters that effect the dynamics of the system ) and extrinsic parameters ( those that are more relative to the detector ) . in the parameter",
    "set defined above , we consider the final four parameters to be extrinsic .",
    "the fisher matrix is thus defined by @xmath48 where @xmath49 is an un - normalized template and the angular brackets denote the inner product @xmath50 , \\label{eq : scalarprod}\\ ] ] where a tilde denotes a fourier transform and an asterisk denotes a complex conjugate .",
    "the quantity @xmath51 is the one - sided noise spectral density of the detector , which is a combination of instrumental and galactic confusion noise . for the instrumental noise",
    "we use the expression given by  @xcite @xmath52 , \\ ] ] where @xmath53 km is the arm - length for lisa , @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the position and acceleration noise respectively . the quantity @xmath56 is the mean transfer frequency for the lisa arm .",
    "notice that the final term in the expression has the effect of reddening the noise below @xmath57 hz to account for the fact that we may not be able to achieve the desired noise spectral density as we approach @xmath58 hz . for the galactic confusion we use the following confusion noise estimate derived from a nelemans , yungelson , zwart ( nyz ) galactic foreground model  @xcite @xmath59 where the confusion noise has units of @xmath60 .",
    "when two channels are available the total fim is the sum of the fim in each channel , i.e. @xmath61 .    for this study the fisher matrix is calculated numerically , where the derivatives of the waveforms are calculated using the central difference equation @xmath62 for all parameters other than @xmath63 and @xmath64 in the equal mass case . the central difference equation in un - applicable for these two parameters when we have equal masses , as it is a degenerate space .",
    "certain shifts in one parameter , while holding the other constant , leads to un - astrophysical individual masses .",
    "therefore , in the equal mass case , for @xmath63 and @xmath64 we use @xmath65 and @xmath66 for all other cases , we revert to the central difference formula .",
    "one of the quantities that we are most interested in investigating is the error box on the sky for a particular source .",
    "we therefore define the positional error on the sky as @xmath67 where the elements of the variance - covariance matrix are given by @xmath68 and the three main quantities in the sky resolution expression are given by @xmath69 @xmath70 and @xmath71    finally , we also quote the optimal signal to noise ratio ( snr ) for each source . in each individual detector",
    "this is defined by @xmath72 when we use both lisa detectors the total snr is given by @xmath73    for the monte carlo simulation , we used @xmath74 points , where the redshifted chirp mass , mass ratio , time to coalescence and luminosity distance were held constant and all other parameters were varied . to investigate as many cases as possible , we chose chirp masses of @xmath75 .",
    "for each chirp mass , we ran a monte carlo for mass ratios of 1 and 10 . in all cases ,",
    "the sources were put at a constant distance of 10 gpc .",
    "we assume the time of observation is 1 year , and the time to coalescence in each case is 0.999 years . to be consistent , we chose not to evolve our templates beyond 5 mhz as we know that we can not trust the low frequency approximation beyond this value . for cases where coalescence is seen (",
    "i.e. the coalescence frequency of the maximum harmonic is less than 5 mhz ) the templates were terminated once the distance between the bodies reached @xmath76 .",
    "for clarity , we will treat the equal and unequal mass results separately . in both cases , we focus on the most interesting parameters from an astronomical point of view .",
    "we focus on the two mass parameters , the time of coalescence , the luminosity distance and the sky resolution . for completeness , we also include information on the signal to noise ratios",
    ". we should also point out that due to the large tails in the distributions , median values are more informative than mean values .",
    "= 8.5 cm    = 8.5 cm      in fig  ( [ fig : em1 ] ) we plot the median results from the monte carlo simulation , for equal mass binaries , as a function of redshifted chirp mass .",
    "we can see that at 10 gpcs , we should be able to see sources with redshifted chirp masses of @xmath77 , both with and without the extra corrections .",
    "the hhcs give median improvements of factors of 26 in chirp mass , 194 in reduced mass , 17 in time to coalescence and 12 in sky resolution .",
    "however , we should adapt a cautionary air about these sources . while they are detectable",
    ", it does not look like we will be say much about parameter estimation .",
    "two of the most important quantities for astronomical observations are sky position and distance . for these particular sources ,",
    "the distance to the source is unresolvable .",
    "the factor of 12 improvement in sky resolution minimizes the error from all - sky to 1 steradian .",
    "again we should point out that these are median values , so there will be a small subset of the results which will give bigger improvements in the position and distance .",
    "but even then , it may not be good enough for astronomical purposes .",
    "so it is more realistic in this scenario to focus on the lower mass systems for parameter estimation . in this case",
    "we obtain more modest results , except in the case of the reduced mass . from the monte carlo",
    "we obtain hhc improvements in chirp mass of about 3.5 at @xmath78 down to approximately 1.7 at @xmath79 . for coalescence time",
    "we obtain improvements of 2.7 at high mass to 1 at low mass and an improvement in sky resolution of 5.3 at high mass to 1.3 at low mass .",
    "the smallest improvement comes for luminosity distance with 1.3 at @xmath78 to 1 at @xmath79 .",
    "however , the biggest improvement is for the reduced mass .",
    "here we get a factor of 28 improvement at high mass , increasing to a factor of 73 at low mass .",
    "we will explain this fantastic result in the next section when we look at correlation breaking between the parameters .",
    "it is clear from the plot that the biggest gain from using the hhc waveforms is in the redshifted chirp mass range of @xmath80 . below this value , the higher harmonics are now out of band at high frequencies .",
    "this leaves only the @xmath81 correction in band . from the cell where we display snr",
    ", we can see that this first correction has the effect of subtracting snr .",
    "the result that the hhc waveform has greater snr at high mass , and lower snr at low mass is well known .      in fig  ( [ fig : uem1 ] )",
    "we plot the same values for the mass ratio 10 scenario . in this case",
    "we are not able to detect binaries with a redshifted chirp mass of @xmath77 , even with the inclusion of hhcs . for unequal mass binaries ,",
    "the effect of the hhcs is somewhat less dramatic for the mass parameters .",
    "in fact we can see that we only have improvements in parameter estimation above @xmath82 .",
    "once again , between @xmath78 and @xmath79 , we have improvement factors of approximately 3 to 1 for both chirp mass and reduced mass . however , for @xmath83 and @xmath15 , there is an obvious advantage to having the hhcs .",
    "while the improvement is not great ( @xmath84 ) , we do see a gain in the time to coalescence estimate .",
    "the improvements for luminosity distance are between 3.5 and 1.5 , but the greatest improvement is for the sky resolution with median factors of 24 at @xmath78 and 1.5 at @xmath79 .",
    "what is important in this case is that for both of these parameters , the improvement stretches to pretty much all lower masses . in terms of snr",
    ", we see the same pattern as before . at higher masses",
    "the hhc waveforms have a slightly higher snr , whereas the opposite is true at low mass .",
    "we should say a few words here about why the hhcs are having an effect .",
    "this was outlined in refs  @xcite , but we feel it is useful to reiterate it here .",
    "we have seen that our measured signal is a function of nine parameters . the three most important , and hence easiest to measure , parameters are @xmath85 .",
    "we can see from eqn  ( [ eqn : phase ] ) that the waveform phase , and from @xmath86 , that the frequency and all its derivatives are determined with these three parameters . to get good a good estimate for sky position we rely on two effects : first , the doppler shift which is a function of @xmath87 and the beam pattern functions which are a function of @xmath88 . for a system like the inspiral of a massive black hole binary ,",
    "in effect each detector measures an amplitude and a phase .",
    "because the waveforms are long - lived in the detector , we are able to measure the frequency and it s derivatives to high accuracy .",
    "this allows us to measure @xmath85 quite accurately , but still leaves six unknowns @xmath89 .",
    "in a two detector system with no hhcs , each detector measures a phase and an amplitude , giving in effect , four observables with six unknowns .",
    "however , the introduction of the hhcs rectifies this . in the equal mass case",
    ", we stated that all harmonics which are a function of @xmath90 are null .",
    "this means that if we include all harmonic corrections up to @xmath91 , we still retain three harmonics , giving us three phases and three amplitudes in each detector .",
    "this gives us twelve observables in total for six unknowns .",
    "for the unequal mass case , we now end up with twenty - four observables for six unknowns .",
    "we can see the effect of having the extra observables by noting that the parameter estimation is always better in the unequal mass case .",
    "in the previous section we demonstrated that the hhcs lead to smaller predicted errors in the estimation of parameters , especially in the higher mass range . while we would expect as improvement due to the fact that the hhc waveforms extend to higher frequencies , this still does not answer the question of what exactly is causing the improvement . to try and give a more definitive reason , we look at correlation breaking between parameters .",
    "we stated earlier that the inverse of the fim , @xmath92 , is the variance - covariance matrix @xmath93 . rather than working with this",
    ", it is more informative to work with the matrix of standard deviations and correlation coefficients defined by @xmath94 in this matrix , the diagonal elements range between @xmath95 $ ] , where 1 is perfect correlation , -1 is perfect anticorrelation and 0 represents no correlation . for supermassive black holes",
    "there is some degree of correlation between most of the parameters .",
    "however , in most cases the correlations are mild . as we are concerned with any correlation breaking between the strongly correlated parameters , we will focus on parameter correlations with an absolute value of @xmath96 . as we have seen that the hhcs have a greater effect on the higher mass binaries , for this exercise we will only concern ourselves with the @xmath97 case .",
    "again , we will treat the equal and unequal mass cases separately .      in fig  ( [ fig : emcb ] )",
    "we plot the strongly correlated parameter breaking for the case of equal mass binaries .",
    "the dark lines represent the restricted waveforms , while the light lines denote the hhc waveforms . as was shown in ref  @xcite",
    ", there is a strong correlation between @xmath98 in the restricted pn case .",
    "what was not clear in these previous works is the fact that these three parameters are also quite highly correlated with the azimuthal sky angle @xmath99 . on the other hand",
    ", it turns out that @xmath100 is highly correlated with the three extrinsic parameters @xmath101 . finally in the restricted case ,",
    "one of the other parameters of interest is the polarization angle @xmath33 which is correlated mostly with @xmath102    if we now focus on the light curves , we can see the effect of introducing the higher harmonic .",
    "the most surprising thing we can immediately see is that for @xmath103 , rather than breaking the correlation , the hhcs actual make the reduced mass perfectly correlated with the chirp mass . in fact , the fisher elements for these two parameters are numerically equivalent in the equal mass case . as the chirp mass is already well resolved , even in the restricted waveform case , this perfect correlation explains the huge increase in precision for the reduced mass in fig  ( [ fig : em1 ] ) . going back to the top two cells in this figure",
    ", we can see that the error curves for both parameters are almost identical .",
    "so while there is an increase in correlation for @xmath103 , we can see that there is a huge correlation breaking for all the other intrinsic parameters upon introduction of the hhcs .",
    "we can see that both @xmath104 and @xmath64 decouple from @xmath105 , with median absolute correlations dropping from ( 0.46 , 0.78 ) to ( 0.18 , 0.18 ) respectively . in terms of the improvement in sky resolution",
    ", it looks like there is a combined effect from the higher harmonics .",
    "the first is that the azimuthal sky parameter @xmath99 decouples from @xmath106 with correlations dropping from ( 0.55 , 0.56 ) to ( 0.24 , 0.08 ) respectively .",
    "secondly , the polar angle @xmath100 decouples from @xmath107 . here",
    "the correlations decrease from ( 0.66 , 0.58 ) to ( 0.49 , 0.48 ) .",
    "finally we see the same thing happening with the polarization angle @xmath33 with correlation decreasing from ( 0.55 , 0.81 ) to ( 0.32 , 0.66 ) respectively .",
    "we believe these various breaking of correlation between @xmath108 and the other parameters are the main reason for the increase in sky resolution .      in fig  ( [ fig : umcb ] )",
    "we plot the same thing for the unequal mass case . here",
    "we find a similar story to the equal mass case .",
    "the main difference is that in this case we do observe some slight correlation breaking between @xmath63 and @xmath64 with the correlation reducing from 0.94 to 0.87 .",
    "once again , the main intrinsic correlation is between @xmath109 .",
    "firstly , both @xmath63 and @xmath64 decouple from @xmath105 with correlations dropping from ( 0.83 , 0.96 ) to ( 0.24 , 0.22 ) respectively .",
    "this is accompanied by correlation breaking between @xmath98 and @xmath99 with respective correlations of ( 0.83 , 0.97 , 0.98 ) dropping to ( 0.4 , 0.68 , 0.54 ) .",
    "again we see a drop in correlation between @xmath100 and @xmath110 with values changing from ( 0.53 , 0.8 , 0.46 ) to ( 0.19 , 0.42 , 0.19 ) . and",
    "finally , as in the equal mass case , we also observe some correlation breaking between @xmath33 and @xmath107 with correlations being reduced from ( 0.52 , 0.79 ) to ( 0.28 , 0.68 ) respectively .",
    "the final issue we look at is the advantage of using hhc waveforms if there is a problem with lisa and we lose two detector links .",
    "while the goal is always to have six links working , the question stands : can we still do astronomy with a broken detector ? in the following text",
    "we will refer to one channel restricted results as @xmath111 , two channel restricted as @xmath112 , one channel hhc as @xmath113 and two channel hhc results as @xmath114 .",
    "there are two results we can present here , before making distinctions between equal and unequal masses .",
    "the first is that a full lisa is always going to perform better , and the second is that there is in general an improvement in snr of @xmath115 in going from a one to a two channel lisa regardless of the waveform type .      in fig  ( [ fig : fem ] ) , we repeat the results of fig  ( [ fig : em1 ] ) , this time with the inclusion of parameter estimation just using one lisa channel .",
    "we can see that in all cases , losing one lisa channel and just having the @xmath111 output would seriously hamper our ability to carry out parameter estimation for all parameters . for the @xmath116 case , while the signal would be just about detectable over a galaxy with a median snr of 12.6 , we could say nothing about @xmath117 and would have an enormous error in time to coalescence prediction . as we go to the @xmath97 case ,",
    "the gap between the @xmath111 and @xmath112 results have narrowed for @xmath118 with a factor of @xmath119 2 in error .",
    "however for sky resolution and luminosity distance there is a loss of information of factors of 27 and 4.5 respectively .",
    "this is again due to the fact that in one channel , we would only measure one phase and one amplitude , giving two observables for the six unknowns @xmath89 .    with the introduction of the hhc waveforms ,",
    "it is clear , as we can see from the plots , that for a chirp mass of @xmath120 we can do as well , if not better , using the @xmath113 output as we can using the @xmath112 channels .",
    "again at @xmath116 , the sky position and luminosity distance are unresolvable using the @xmath113 channel only . however , for chirp mass , reduced mass and coalescence time we actually improve the error estimate by factors of almost 10 , 57 and 4 respectively over the @xmath112 channels . at around @xmath97",
    "we see the real power of including the hhcs . except for luminosity distance , where there is a slight increase in error , the performance of the @xmath121 channel equals or exceeds the @xmath112 channels .",
    "in fact , we see improvement factors of 2 in chirp mass and 16 in reduced mass when we use just the @xmath113 channel .",
    "we can justify this increase in performance by examining the observable count .",
    "we stated earlier that the @xmath112 combination measures two phases and two amplitudes , giving four observables for six unknowns .",
    "once we introduce the hhcs in the equal mass case , we now have three amplitudes and three phases , giving us the six observables we need for the six unknowns .",
    "we present the same results for the unequal mass case in fig  ( [ fig : fum ] ) . as in the equal mass case ,",
    "we see some similar patterns . in all cases an @xmath111 channel alone will seriously effect our ability to do gw astronomy , with the main effect coming in sky resolution and luminosity distance estimations .",
    "we can see that the errors for these two parameters changes by at least an order of magnitude , while there is a loss of almost an order of magnitude for the mass parameters . for the @xmath113 channel case",
    ", we again see that at @xmath122 the one channel with hhcs does as well if not better than the @xmath112 channels .",
    "as is expected , the improvement in the masses is not as pronounced in the unequal mass case , but we still see improvements at the highest mass . the major result in this case is that an @xmath113 channel will outperform the @xmath112 cases down to a redshifted chirp mass of @xmath123 .",
    "it is interesting to examine the effects of the hhcs in the one detector case in a deeper manner .",
    "to do so , we will focus on the the case of a system with a redshifted chirp mass of @xmath78 and a mass ratio of 10 . as usual",
    ", the source is at 10 gpc and is coalescing just inside the observation time .",
    "the first thing we can look at is the observables count . in this case , the extra harmonics allow us to measure six phases and six amplitudes giving us twelve observables for six unknowns .",
    "in fact , it is now clear that just adding the @xmath124 terms are enough to outperform the @xmath112 channels , as with this model we would have three phases and three amplitudes , giving us the six observables needed for the six unknowns .",
    "we should note however , that for the equal mass system , we would need to go to higher harmonic orders due to the null harmonic terms .",
    ".median errors for a source with a redshifted chirpmass of @xmath78 and a mass ratio of 10 at a distance of 10 gpc . for each parameter",
    "we show the one - channel lisa correlations without hhcs , @xmath111 , one - channel lisa correlations with hhcs , @xmath113 , two - channel lisa correlations without hhcs , @xmath112 , and two - channel lisa correlations with hhcs , @xmath114 , errors .",
    "the last four rows show the ratios of the median error values for various channel combinations .",
    "the errors for the angular variables are in radians . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "in this work we have looked at the effect of including higher harmonic corrections to the restricted pn waveforms in the lisa context . by carrying out an extensive monte carlo simulation for various redshifted chirp masses and mass ratios , we have tried to cover as many scenarios as possible .",
    "as was already known , the corrected waveforms bring previously invisible sources into the lisa bandwidth .",
    "we have shown however , that in general while we will be able to detect these sources , we will not be able to say anything useful for any electromagnetic follow - up .",
    "for equal mass binaries , due to a combination of correlation breaking and the reduced mass becoming perfectly correlated with the chirp mass , there is a significant improvement in mass estimation using the corrected waveforms .",
    "we found that while there are systems where improvements in sky resolution and luminosity distance are huge , the median improvements are not as dramatic as some individual sources .",
    "the same is true in the unequal mass case , although here there is an order of magnitude improvement in sky resolution .",
    "we also showed that the overall effect of the hhcs is providing enough observables to account for the number of unknown parameters .",
    "we finally looked at the more interesting case where the lisa output was reduced to one channel .",
    "we showed here that for supermassive and some massive systems , we can actually do better with a one channel lisa with hhcs than we can with a full lisa with no harmonic corrections . as the hhcs again provide enough observables to solve for the unknown parameters ,",
    "this allows us to improve mass measurement , sky resolution and make instantaneous measurements of the polarization @xmath33 .",
    "while a second channel always improves the parameter extraction , it is clear that the hhcs are the main source of correlation breaking and improvement in parameter estimation .",
    "this is an important result as it shows that while we would always like a full lisa , not all would be lost if we were forced to work with a single channel detector .",

    "<S> several studies have investigated how lisa observations could be used to constrain the parameters of these systems . until recently , most of these studies have ignored the higher harmonic corrections to the waveforms . here </S>",
    "<S> we analyze the effects of the higher harmonics in more detail by performing extensive monte carlo simulations . </S>",
    "<S> we pay particular attention to how the higher harmonics impact parameter correlations , and show that the additional harmonics help mitigate the impact of having two laser links fail , by allowing for an instantaneous measurement of the gravitational wave polarization with a single interferometer channel . by looking at parameter correlations we are able to explain why certain mass ratios provide dramatic improvements in certain parameter estimations , and illustrate how the improved polarization measurement improves the prospects for single interferometer operation . </S>",
