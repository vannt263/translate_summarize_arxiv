    "quantum decoherence control has been studied intensively in recent years due to the fact that it represents one of the main obstacles in implementing quantum computation . however",
    "the problem of decoherence remains daunting .",
    "although there have been rapid advances in physical realization of quantum operations on few levels system in which a single qubit or few qubit can be embedded .",
    "the fidelity for those quantum operations , such as rabi rotation , is typically far below the threshold to make the system scalable . to increase the fidelity , many strategies",
    "are proposed to counteract the undesired effects resulting from decoherence .",
    "those strategies can be roughly divided into two categories , depended on if an encoding scheme is used .",
    "some prominent examples in which encoding is needed are the quantum error - correction codes ( qecc)@xcite and the decoherence - free subspace ( dfs).@xcite one of the main drawback of the encoding strategies is the large amount of ancillary space needed , especially when the qubit is still a rare resource . as a result , strategies which do not need ancillary systems is highly desirable .",
    "closed - loop decoherence control ( such as quantum feedback control @xcite ) and open - loop decoherence control ( such as bang - bang or dynamical decoupling @xcite ) fall into this category .",
    "the open - loop decoherence control typically requires only a limited , _ a priori _ , knowledge of the system - environment dynamics .",
    "empirical determination of control parameters via quantum tomography has also been proposed recently.@xcite in this work we will focus on the dynamical decoupling , but it is acknowledged that no single strategy can efficiently eliminated the problem of decoherence at all levels . combining or concatenating different strategies is usually necessary for any real physical system .    in the original bang - bang decoupling framework , arbitrarily strong and instantaneous control pulses are utilized to induce frequent unitary interruptions during the evolution of the system .",
    "the control hamiltonian is independent of the system dynamics and are judicially designed to realize an effective decoupling between the system and the environment .",
    "the stringent requirement on the control hamiltonian represents a drawback of the bang - bang decoupling .",
    "experimentally it is impossible to implement arbitrarily strong and instantaneous pulses in real physical systems .",
    "an ultra strong and fast control pulse will also inevitably induce transitions to higher energy levels which are usually neglected in the analysis of the bang - bang decoupling .",
    "theoretically is difficulty to describe the evolution with and without control terms simultaneously .",
    "this also make it difficult to estimate the robustness of the control and to estimate the error induced by operational imperfections .",
    "the highly abstract group theory which is frequently used in the decoupling analysis also make it less intuitive and difficult to make transparent connection to the realization of bang - bang decoupling . to alleviate the need for strong and impulsive control actions ,",
    "a dynamical decoupling using only bounded - strength hamiltonian is recently proposed.@xcite within this framework the same group symmetrization is achieved by exploiting the _ eulerian cycles on a cayley graph of @xmath1_,@xcite where @xmath1 is the decoupling group . on the other hand a complimentary , geometric perspective of bang - bang decoupling is recently proposed to provide a more intuitive picture and provide a method to estimate implementation errors.@xcite in this work we extend the geometric picture of bang - bang decoupling to the case of continuous decoupling with bounded controls .",
    "we show that the decoupling by symmetrization is equivalent to average out error vectors whose trajectories are determined by the control hamiltonians .",
    "the decoupling pulses can be intuitively designed by viewing the effect of control hamiltonian from a geometric perspective . to avoid confusing we will use the term _ bang - bang decoupling _ to refer to the typical decoupling scheme originally proposed.@xcite the term _ eulerian decoupling _ corresponds to the decoupling with bounded hamiltonian introduced by l. viola and e. knill@xcite , while the term _ continuous decoupling _ corresponds to the version of continuous decoupling from a geometric picture developed in this work .",

    "this corresponds to rotate the error vector by @xmath169 at each kick . from the typical bang - bang decoupling point of view larger decoupling group",
    "represents a less optimal decoupling scheme since more kicks are needed . on the other hand",
    "when viewed as the limiting case of the continuous decoupling , @xmath170 bang - bang decoupling corresponds to require a large amplitude @xmath133 for small @xmath171 and turn @xmath133 off once the error vector @xmath140 is steered to @xmath158 .",

    "it is evident from the figure that a judicial envelope function will ensure that all time integrals of error vectors are zero .",
    "the decoupling pulse sequence designed here is equivalent to the eulerian decoupling prescribed in ref .",
    "however as pointed out in previous example the efficiency consideration should be based on the continuous decoupling framework . in ref",
    ", an example is given to demonstrate that a decoupling group may not be necessary to achieve the decoupling condition . from the geometric picture of the bang - bang decoupling it suffices to rotate instantaneously the error vectors to the vortices of a tetrahedron . from continuous decoupling point of view",
    "it is evident that for this kind of decoupling sequences the residual errors will accumulate when the error vectors are rotated from one vertex to another .",
    "it is difficult to cancel these residuals systematically using a design similar to what has been done in this example .",
    "even if it is accomplished , it would represent a less optimal solution .",
    "we thus argue that a decoupling group is not necessary to achieve continuous dynamical decoupling but a decoupling group usually provides a guideline to design the optimal continuous decoupling sequence .    ]",
    "next example consists of a two qubit system with independent dephasing error operators .",

    "any rotation in @xmath187 which can rotate both error vectors by @xmath139 should effectively decouple the system from the dephasing error . in many solid - state qubit",

    "matrices the heisenberg interaction is written as @xmath188 in other words the heisenberg interaction corresponds to three vectors @xmath189 , @xmath190 , and @xmath191 from the geometric perspective .",
    "a decoupling sequence compatible with heisenberg interaction should average error vectors to zero while leave those three vectors in tact . using the results in the appendix",
    "it is apparent that one should avoid using the generators @xmath192 , @xmath193 , and @xmath194 which either ca nt average error vectors to zero or have undesirable side effects on heisenberg interaction .",
    "this leaves us to the only choice of @xmath195 , @xmath196 , and @xmath197 .",
    "it is then easy to verify that any one of those three generators can be used as the control hamiltonian to average out the dephasing error with an appropriately designed envelope function @xmath133 while leaves the heisenberg interaction in tact .",
    "our final example consists of a three level system in which the first two levels @xmath198 are used as the qubit space while the third level @xmath199 is used as an ancilla level used to implement quantum operation in qubit space .",
    "we assume that all three levels are coupled to the environment , with the following system - bath hamiltonian : @xmath200 this system - bath hamiltonian corresponds to three error vectors @xmath201 , @xmath202 , and @xmath203 . by consulting the @xmath204 mapping in the appendix it is easy to show that all three error vectors can be averaged to zero via the generator @xmath205 .",
    "this simple example illustrates that the continuous dynamical decoupling from geometric perspective can be straightforwardly applied not only to the logical qubit space but also the physical qubit space or the larger space in which the physical qubit space is embedded in .",
    "in summary we have developed a continuous dynamical decoupling framework from a geometric perspective . within this framework , the need to perform unphysical , arbitrarily strong and fast control is eliminated , and bang - bang control can be viewed as a unphysical limit of the continuous decoupling in which the control hamiltonian is unbounded . the decoupling condition is equal to require that all time - dependent error vectors @xmath90 average to zero at the end of the decoupling cycle .",
    "the trajectories of the error vectors are steered by the control hamiltonian . by expressing control hamiltonian in terms of the generators of @xmath0 , the geometric picture provides an intuitive way to design the decoupling pulse sequences , provided that the structure function of the corresponding @xmath0 is known .",
    "several examples are given to explicitly illustrate how to design the decoupling sequences starting from a given system - bath hamiltonian .",
    "we also show that , in stead of the order of the decoupling group , the minimal time needed to finish one continuous decoupling cycle . the framework is not restricted to physical qubit space or logical qubit space .",
    "the ancilla levels or other relevant nearby levels can be naturally included in the analysis .",
    "this is important especially when ancilla levels are needed to perform quantum operation or when the nearby levels can not be neglected .",
    "the paper has focused on designing the decoupling pulses which are ideal for quantum memory .",
    "less is addressed about how to perform quantum operation and decoupling at the same time . the continuous decoupling framework developed in this work",
    "can be extended to systematically treat this problem.@xcite .",
    "the detail of the analysis is beyond the scope of this work and will be presented elsewhere .",
    "it is also intriguing to discuss the issue of optimal control . in a typical bang - bang decoupling framework",
    "a decoupling group is identified , assuming that the corresponding time evolution operators can be implemented .",
    "however in real system the possible control hamiltonian at our disposal might be limited and the desired time evolution operators might not be achievable .",
    "it is thus nature to ask the complementary questions : giving a set of possible control hamiltonian , what is the optimal decoupling sequence ?",
    "the geometric continuous decoupling framework developed here is suitable to answer this question . as a simplest example consider the case where some of the generators of @xmath0 can not be used as the control hamiltonian . in this case",
    "one can use the remaining generators and their corresponding rotations to construct a ( sub)-optimal decoupling sequence .",
    "recently there has been efforts to unify the dynamical decoupling and the quantum zeno effect.@xcite roughly speaking bang - bang control and quantum zero effect both require a strong interaction with a quantum system . this idea shared by two scheme leads to the possible unification .",
