    "networks of interacting quantum particles  so - called spin - networks  are important for transferring and distributing quantum information between different parts of a larger system such as different quantum components on a chip  @xcite .",
    "spin chains , linear arrangements of spins , for example , can play the role of classical wires connecting two parts , and branched networks allow the distribution of quantum information to different nodes . the way quantum information propagates through spin networks , however ,",
    "is quite different from classical information flow due to quantum inference effects .",
    "in particular , quantum state transfer between the nodes of the network is limited by fundamental physical principles and perfect quantum state transfer is usually possible only in very special cases . quantifying state transfer fidelities for spin networks is not easy in general , but for certain types of networks such as spin-@xmath0 particles with interactions of so - called xxz type , for example , this problem can be reduced to the maximum probability for a single excitation to propagate from one node to another , which can be computed efficiently numerically , and in some cases analytically .",
    "thus , for the respective spin networks , the latter is a basic measure for the maximum information transfer capacity ( itc ) between different nodes . for certain types of simple networks such as homogeneous chains",
    "the maximum itc is shown to induce a metric on a set of equivalence classes .",
    "we study the topology of simple networks with regard to this metric , showing that it differs substantially from the physical geometry .",
    "networks with trivial physical geometry such as linear chains can have a surprisingly rich geometric structure including curvature .",
    "analysis of the latter shows that spin chains appear to be gromov - hyperbolic with regard to this maximum itc metric but unlike classical hyperbolic networks their gromov boundary appears to be a single point . for more complex networks the maximum itc does not induce a metric but we can use hierarchical clustering to assess the proximity of nodes with regard to information transfer capacity . again , the resulting cluster structures differ substantially from the neighborhood relations induced by the physical geometry of the network , showing that the latter is not very useful in assessing the maximum itc between nodes in a network , unlike in the classical case .",
    "finally , we consider how minimal control of a single node in the network allows us to change information flow in the network , effectively changing the information transfer capacities ( and network `` topology '' ) , allowing us to achieve higher state transfer fidelities as well as generally speeding up the rate of information transfer .",
    "the hilbert space of spin networks with xxz interactions can be decomposed into so - called excitation subspaces @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the number of excitations in the network , ranging from @xmath3 to @xmath4 .",
    "if we denote the spin basis states by @xmath5 and @xmath6 , taking the latter to denote the ground state , then the @xmath3-excitation subspace consists of a single state @xmath7 , while the one - excitation subspace consists of @xmath4 states @xmath8 , where the excitation @xmath5 is in the @xmath2th position .",
    "thus transferring a quantum state @xmath9 from spin @xmath10 to @xmath2 is equivalent to transferring an excitation @xmath5 from spin @xmath10 to @xmath2 : @xmath11 where we used the shorthand @xmath12 to denote a product state @xmath13 , whose @xmath2th factor is @xmath14 , all others being @xmath6 .",
    "@xmath15         the probability that an excitation created at site @xmath16 has propagated to site @xmath17 after some time @xmath18 is given by @xmath19 in the system of units where @xmath20 .",
    "the maximum of this probability @xmath21 , or a monotonic function thereof such as @xmath22 gives a measure for the maximum state transfer fidelity between two nodes in a spin network without control , quantifying the intrinsic capacity of a spin network for quantum state transfer tasks .",
    "it can be shown that @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the eigendecomposition of the hamiltonian operator @xmath25 of the network in the first excitation subspace @xmath26 .",
    "if the rescaled eigenvalues @xmath27 are rationally independent  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 1.4.1 ) then it can be shown that for any @xmath28 there exists a @xmath29 such that @xmath30 , i.e. , the maximum itc is a tight bound and attainable in the limit .",
    "inspired by  @xcite we may hope that the maximum itc measure @xmath31 defined above can be shown to be a distance .",
    "@xmath31 clearly satisfies @xmath32 as @xmath33 , and we also have symmetry as obviously @xmath34 .",
    "however , @xmath31 can vanish for @xmath35 if @xmath36 , and in general we can not expect the triangle inequality to hold . in special cases , however , such as for homogeneous chains with either xx or heisenberg coupling , numerical exploration for systems up to 500 spins shows that the triangle inequality @xmath37 seems to be universally satisfied .",
    "this renders @xmath31 a semi - distance , which induces a proper distance on a set of equivalence classes defined by identifying nodes with @xmath38 .",
    "specifically , for heisenberg or xx chain with uniform coupling the @xmath4 spins can be shown to form @xmath39 equivalence classes comprised of spins @xmath2 and @xmath40 , which we shall denote by @xmath2 for @xmath41 in a slight abuse of notation . on this set of equivalence classes",
    "the itc measure @xmath31 is a metric , and it is interesting to study the induced geometry of a spin chain with respect to the itc metric , and how it differs from the physical network geometry .",
    "table  [ table1 ] gives the itc geometry for heisenberg chains up to @xmath42 , showing that it is very different from the ( trivial ) physical geometry .",
    "a heisenberg chain of length @xmath43 , for instance , appears as a pyramid structure with an equilateral triangle as its base formed by the vertices @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 as its apex , where @xmath2 refers to the index of the spin in the chain .",
    "chains up to length @xmath48 can be embedded in @xmath49 but for longer chains higher - dimensional spaces are required . by schoenberg s theorem  @xcite the distances @xmath31",
    "can be realized in @xmath50 if and only if the gram matrix @xmath51 is positive semi - definite of rank @xmath52 , where @xmath53 ( this is equivalent to the cayley - menger matrix criterion of  @xcite . )",
    "we numerically verified that the gram matrix for both heisenberg and xx chains is positive semi - definite for spins up to @xmath54 .",
    "analysis of the rank of the gram matrix furthermore suggests that the dimension @xmath52 required to embed a chain of length @xmath4 is @xmath55 for both heisenberg and xx chains .",
    "note that schoenberg s theorem also applies to the geometric realisability of general spin networks and whether our itc measure fulfills the triangle inequality .    to better understand the geometry for very long chains we analyze its curvature  la gromov . from both the gromov and the scaled - gromov point of view  @xcite spin chain of both heisenberg and xx coupling type appear hyperbolic .",
    "the strict gromov point of view is displayed in fig .",
    "[ f : gromov - plot](a ) and the scaled - gromov point of view is shown in fig .",
    "[ f : gromov - plot](b ) .",
    "the gromov property might appear to conflict with the euclidean embeddability of the metric space made up by the clusters with the itc metric , as the bonk - schramm  @xcite theorem says that gromov negatively curved spaces are embeddable in hyperbolic space .",
    "however , some metric spaces are embeddable in _ both _ euclidean and hyperbolic spaces , the most striking example being that of a complete graph with uniform edge weight , and spin chains with uniform couplings appear to fall into this category .    classical communication networks , both wired  @xcite and wireless  @xcite , have been shown to be gromov hyperbolic .",
    "gromov hyperbolic spaces have a unique vertex that achieves the minimum inertia  @xcite , the so - called @xmath56 classical networks indeed show a point of minimum inertia , which can be interpreted as a congestion point  @xcite .",
    "classical networks also have the property that their gromov boundary in the asymptotic limit is a cantor set  @xcite .",
    "quite surprisingly , quantum networks differ from their classical counterparts in that they have points of maximum inertia , or , as shown in figs  [ f : inertiaplot - h ] and [ f : inertiaplot - xx ] for heisenberg and xx chains , respectively , and their gromov boundary is a single point .",
    "the interpretation of the antigravity center is that the information flow in the network avoids this node , making it difficult to transfer excitation to and from it .",
    "it is interesting to note in this context that the distance between antipodal nodes is @xmath3 , meaning that we can achieve state transfer fidelities arbitrarily close to @xmath57 , i.e. , near perfect state transfer between the ends of the chain of any length given sufficient time , while near perfect state transfer is never possible between any pair of nodes with @xmath58 , no matter how long we wait .",
    "the maximum transfer probability is also a useful measure for the maximum fidelity of quantum state transfer in general spin networks .",
    "although it is in general no longer a metric , it can still be used as a similarity measure to define a hierarchical clustering .",
    "we use the pairwise clustering algorithm introduced in  @xcite .",
    "pairs of nodes are grouped hierarchically into clusters in order of their similarity , and only those clusters whose elements are closer to each other than any element outside the cluster are preserved . if we define a relation @xmath59 for nodes @xmath60 , @xmath61 , then these clusters are the equivalence classes of @xmath62 for a certain @xmath63 .",
    "the cluster hierarchy reveals the closeness of the nodes in terms of information transfer .",
    "for example , consider a network of 10 spins distributed in a square forming a general spin network as shown in fig .",
    "[ f : cluster - network ] .",
    "the positions of the spins are indicated by the blue dots . taking the coupling strength @xmath64 between spins @xmath65 and @xmath66 to be inversely proportional to the cube of the physical distance between the nodes",
    ", we compute the hamiltonian of the network , assuming xx - coupling .",
    "we then diagonalize this hamiltonian and compute the maximum transfer probabilities @xmath67 and the associated @xmath31 , which are used as input for our clustering algorithm .",
    "the resulting hierarchical clustering structure is shown in fig .",
    "[ f : cluster - network ] .",
    "different colours indicate clusters for different similarity levels ; i.e. for clusters marked in the same colour there exists an @xmath63 for which these are the equivalence classes of @xmath62 .",
    "again , the example shows that the physical distance of the spins is not a good measure of their proximity in an quantum information transfer fidelity sense .",
    "for instance , spin @xmath68 is physically closer to @xmath69 than any of the other nodes , yet the clustering indices that @xmath68 and @xmath69 are several levels removed with regard to the maximum itc .",
    "to overcome intrinsic limitations on quantum state transfer or speed up transfer , one can either try to engineer spin chains or networks with non - uniform couplings or introduce dynamic control to change the network topology .",
    "the idea of engineered couplings was originally proposed to achieve perfect state transfer between the end spin in spin chain quantum wires  @xcite .",
    "the analysis above shows that engineering the couplings is not strictly necessary . as the distance between the end spins with regard to",
    "the itc metric defined above is zero for uniform xx and heisenberg chains , we can achieve arbitrary high fidelities state transfer between the end spins if we wait long enough . engineering the couplings , however , can speed up certain state transfer tasks such as state transfer between the end spins at the expense of others .",
    "a more flexible alternative to fixed engineered couplings is to apply control .",
    "for instance , suppose we would like to transfer an excitation from node @xmath57 to @xmath70 for an xx chain of length @xmath43 .",
    "node @xmath70 being the anti - gravity center , the maximum transfer probability without control is low regardless how long we are prepared to wait .",
    "if we are able to change the hamiltonian of the network by applying some control perturbtation so that @xmath71 we can change the situation even if the control is restricted to @xmath72 , and @xmath73 is a local perturbation , e.g. , of a single spin induced by a magnetic field , e.g. , @xmath74 .",
    "switching the control on / off at times @xmath75 induces the evolution @xmath76 where @xmath77 and @xmath78 . by optimizing the control sequence , i.e. , in this restricted case the switching times @xmath79",
    ", we can change the dynamics to achieve near perfect transfer of an excitation or quantum state to a desired target node .",
    "in @xcite it was shown that applying a simple bang - bang control sequence to a single spin can significantly speed up quantum state transfer between the ends of a chain , but control also allows us to overcome fundamental limits imposed the maximum itc , enabling us to achieve near perfect excitation transfer to the anti - gravity center in very short time , as shown in fig .",
    "[ f : controlevol ] , for example .",
    "we can think of the control sequence as implementing an effective hamiltonian @xmath80 defined by @xmath81 at time @xmath75 .",
    "this effective hamiltonian differs from the system hamiltonian @xmath82 , as do the transition probabilities . for comparison , we diagonalize the effective hamiltonian , compute the associated maximum transition probabilities @xmath83 , and use hierarchical clustering to elucitate the proximity relations between spins under the original and effective hamiltonian .",
    "[ f : control ] shows that the results for a particular control example .     for a uniform chain xx chain of length @xmath43 under free and controlled evolution . under free evolution ( dashed )",
    "the population can not exceed @xmath84 ( dash - dot line ) but control can overcome this restriction resulting in near perfect excitation transfer.,scaledwidth=49.0% ]     without control ( a ) and clustering induced by controlled transition probability ( b ) for a bang - bang control sequence designed to achieve perfect state transfer from spin @xmath57 to @xmath70.,scaledwidth=49.0% ]",
    "following the recent trend of _ geometrization _ of classical communication networks , we have here developed the geometry of spin networks using an information transfer capacity metric .",
    "classical and quantum networks bear the similarity that they are both gromov hyperbolic , with the difference that classical networks have a cantor gromov boundary while spin chains have their gromov boundary reduced to a point .",
    "this probably accounts for yet another discrepancy : classical networks have a gravity center ( a congestion point ) while quantum networks have an anti - gravity center , a spin difficult to communicate with . the broader implication of this geometrization is that it specifies _ where _ control is necessary to overcome such limitations of the physics .",
