    "the discrete nature of the configuration space for @xmath0 classical bits is the key property allowing robustness of digital computation .",
    "the hilbert space @xmath4 for @xmath0 qubits , on the other hand , is a _ continuous _ complex * *  * * manifold .",
    "this continuity appears essential to the exponential speed - up of some quantum computing algorithms , such as shor s factoring algorithm@xcite , over their classical counterparts .",
    "but it also poses a challenging problem for the experimentalist : errors in quantum gates are themselves continuous , so even minute errors can accumulate throughout the execution of an algorithm and lead to its failure .    yet",
    ", quantum error correction and fault - tolerant computation schemes have been developed to meet this challenge@xcite .",
    "that reliable quantum computation is possible using both a noisy quantum register and noisy gates is a result of surpassing importance .",
    "however , such schemes still place stringent fidelity requirements on the basic quantum gates and the quantum register : estimates for the threshold error probability above which they fail are typically @xmath5@xmath6@xcite .",
    "can universal control of a scalable quantum register with this level of fidelity be realized ?",
    "if so , are there concepts we can borrow from digital computation that might facilitate the development of this technology ? if not , are there intermediate computational paradigms that might relax these requirements , but still exploit extra - classical  phenomena such as quantum parallelism and quantum entanglement ? we note that these are still possible in a _ discrete _ hilbert space .",
    "quantum gates are typically implemented by applying time - dependent fields to a qubit system .",
    "they correspond to rotations of a unit vector in @xmath1 , with the angle of rotation usually determined by the  duration and amplitude of the pulse which generates the field . in principle , such rotations are simple to implement , given an appropriate time - dependent hamiltonian .",
    "but in practice , noise in both the qubit system and applied fields inevitably leads to errors .",
    "sophisticated techniques that build up a desired gate from a sequence of rotations about successively orthogonal axes have been developed to mitigate the effects of noise . in the field of nmr ,",
    "especially , techniques for performing high - fidelity rotations are now very maturecummins .",
    "yet such techniques for protecting against noise are not directly generalizable to arbitrary angles and axes of rotation . as a result , most experimental protocols for quantum manipulations rely as heavily as possible on a small set of rotations , usually by an angle of @xmath2 or @xmath7 , specifically optimized for the given qubit system . in the landmark experiment by vandersypen , et al . ,",
    "in which an nmr - based quantum processor was used to factor the number fifteen via shor s algorithm , the protocol contained a single rotation by an angle less than @xmath2a conditional @xmath8 rotation@xcite .",
    "nonetheless , universal control of a quantum register requires in theory only a finite number of discrete gates , provided the gates form a universal set .",
    "then an arbitrary software - levelquantum gate can be constructed to a precision @xmath9 by concatenating @xmath10 discrete gates from the universal set ( @xmath11)@xcite .",
    "however , given that each discrete gate itself would likely comprise a sophisticated series of rotations , the prospect of concatenating @xmath12 such gates to create each software - level operation  and doing so before the register decoheres  makes the fidelity requirements of fault - tolerant computing schemes all the more exacting .",
    "much of this difficulty in achieving high - fidelity control of a quantum register can be alleviated by limiting ourselves to _ _",
    "non__universal sets of quantum gates which generate only _ finite _ transformation groups .",
    "a finite transformation group implies a finite number of possible states , so this is equivalent to imposing a discretization on the underlying hilbert space : the quantum register becomes digital . by suitably choosing the transformation group , the allowed states can be selected to have certain well - defined properties , such as known expectation values with respect to a set of measurement operators .    as an illustration of this idea ,",
    "consider the task of testing the experimental protocol for generating one - qubit rotations , which can be represented on the bloch sphere .",
    "suppose we wish to optimize the fidelity of a @xmath2 rotation about the @xmath13-axis in a given qubit system .",
    "starting from the state @xmath14 , we perform a counter - clockwise @xmath15 rotation about the @xmath13-axis , yielding the target state @xmath16 , then we perform a measurement in the @xmath17 basis . by repeating this many times",
    ", we obtain the expectation value @xmath18 of the target state @xmath19 .",
    "assuming imperfections in the state preparation and readout have been accounted for , this expectation value would approach zero if our @xmath2 gate were perfect , since @xmath20 , while deviations from zero would imply an imperfect @xmath2 gate .",
    "specifically , @xmath21 would imply that , on average , the gate has performed a rotation by an angle of @xmath22 .",
    "with knowledge of other one - qubit discrete states and their expectation values @xmath23 , we could also test rotations about the @xmath24- and @xmath25-axes . by direct generalization",
    ", this simple protocol can be used to test rotations on any number of qubits , provided we have an appropriate discrete set of target states .",
    "also , in the nascent field of quantum feedback control , techniques have been developed to _ dynamically _ correct quantum processes . by performing continuous weak measurements on the quantum system",
    ", it is possible to control and correct quantum state evolution through feedback@xcite . incorporating these techniques into quantum computing experiments",
    "could also be facilitated if the number of processes involved were reduced to include only a small class of rotations connecting states with well - defined properties .",
    "having explained why we wish to consider a discrete subset of the full continuous hilbert space , we would now like to draw a geometrical analogy . since we do not want to privilege any region of hilbert space over any other",
    ", the set must comprise a uniform sampling of * *  * * @xmath1 .",
    "the structure of the finite sets we have in mind is exemplified in real space by the platonic solids ",
    "geometrical figures such as the tetrahedron , cube and octahedron characterized by the geometric equivalence of their vertices  which represent discrete subsets uniformly spanning a sphere in @xmath26 . in short",
    ", we are seeking to generalize the platonic solids to hilbert space by selecting from @xmath1 a finite set of states corresponding to the vertices of  a @xmath27-dimensional complex uniform polytope .",
    "we call suchsubsets  _ uniform hilbertian polytopes , _ and denote them by @xmath28 .    in discretizing an @xmath0-qubit register ,",
    "what extra - classical phenomena must be sacrificed ?",
    "if we select the transformation group to include only @xmath7 rotations  the quantum generalizations of the not gate  we generate only a discrete set of @xmath27 states , and fall back on a purely classical register , with no possibility for quantum entanglement .",
    "but , as we will show , the next level towards finer rotations , the transformation group based on @xmath2 rotations , is sufficient for rich extra - classical behavior : the number of discrete states in the set then grows as @xmath29@xcite , the majority of which are entangled for @xmath30 .",
    "also , the super - extensive growth of the discrete set relative to the classical number of states @xmath27 implies that a great deal of the quantum parallelism possible in the full hilbert space remains possible in the discrete set .",
    "though such a digital quantum register would not allow algorithms which are exponentially faster than their classical counterparts ( gottesman - knill theorem ) , a possible reduction of an algorithmic scaling speed from @xmath31 to @xmath32 could still be useful .    at the same time , within the framework of traditional quantum computation , a discrete set and its associated transformation group can provide a useful roadmap  for navigation in the entire hilbert space .",
    "the notion of discrete sets of @xmath0-qubit states is not novel . indeed ,",
    "discrete sets have already been considered in quantum error - correcting codes . there ,  a special set of @xmath33 orthogonal states , to be used as codewords for the basis states of @xmath34 encoded qubits , are selected from a higher - dimensional continuous space @xmath1 .",
    "gottesman s stabilizer formalism provides a general framework for describing and producing quantum error - correcting codes , and allows an analysis of a broad class of quantum networks in the heisenberg picture@xcite .",
    "powerful though it is , the stabilizer formalism approaches the problem of discretization algebraically ; it does not address the geometric relationship between the discrete quantum states , nor the relationships among the various gates that connect these states .",
    "the purpose of this paper is thus to provide such a  geometric approach to the uniform discretization of @xmath1 , and to suggest the use of such discrete sets , either as an arena for exploring extra - classical behavior , or as a heuristic tool for the analysis of certain quantum information processing problems .",
    "we refer to these notions collectively as _ _ digital quantum information__. _  _    for simplicity",
    ", we focus here on the one- and two - qubit hilbert spaces",
    ". however ,  most of our results are directly generalizable to higher - dimensional spaces .",
    "when possible , we use a language that makes this generalization straightforward , if tedious .",
    "in section 2 , we treat the discretization problem using stabilizer theory and derive a class of generalized @xmath2 rotations belonging to the clifford group that connect states in the discrete set . later in section 3",
    ", we present an alternate , purely geometric approach to discretization based on shelling the high dimensional lattices .",
    "we begin this section with some essential results from stabilizer theory . first ,",

    "clearly , limiting the register to a finite number of possible states must alleviate this difficulty , but by how much ?",
    "it can be derived from the properties of the pauli group that each pseudostabilizer @xmath56 has @xmath0  levels of non - orthogonal neighbors . since the eigenstates of neighboring pseudostabilizers",
    "are connected by a single @xmath2 rotation , any state on @xmath51 can be reached from any other in at most @xmath177 such rotations .",
    "this is to be compared with the result that an arbitrary state in the full hilbert space can be reached to within an error @xmath9 by concatenating @xmath178 rotations from a universal set , with @xmath179 .",
    "in addition , note that the cnot and h gates are not directly implemented by a physical hamiltonian , but must be built up from @xmath2 rotations which are naturally realized with accessible field variations , so there is a second simplification from working with the @xmath2 rotations rather than standard universal gate sets such as hstcnot    from an experimentalist s point of view , therefore , the @xmath103 form a very natural language for building quantum gates .",
    "a rotation of the form @xmath180 is directly implemented by a term in the hamiltonian proportional to @xmath181 . and as shown above , this class of rotations generates @xmath182 .",

    "the following section shows a simple example of their calculus .",
    "the hamiltonian describing a given physical system determines which of the generalized @xmath2 rotations will be directly realizable in that system .",
    "implementing cnot according to the decomposition in section 2.5 requires a physical system with a hamiltonian proportional to @xmath183 in order to realize the entangling operation @xmath184 .",
    "though this type of inter - qubit interaction is possible , most qubit systems rely on a less exotic interaction , such as one proportional to @xmath185 or @xmath186 .",
    "how can we implement the cnot gate in one of these more standard registers ?    specifically ,",
    "suppose the system is described by a two - qubit hamiltonian of the form @xmath187 where the tuning parameters @xmath188 allow the relative strengths of the terms to be adjusted during an experiment .",
    "our task is to replace the rotation @xmath189 in the sequence @xmath190 with a rotation or sequence of rotations generated by the above hamiltonian . following the discussion in sections 2.3 and 2.4 on the relationships between the generalized @xmath2 rotations , it is straightforward to calculate that @xmath191 while @xmath192 .",
    "together these give an alternate decomposition that employs only directly realizable @xmath103 : @xmath193 since the decompositions differ in their implementation but not in their meaning , such sequences are synonyms .",
    "it is important to note that the cnot is not a special case : a synonym suitable for a particular implementation could likewise be calculated for _ any _ gate in @xmath194      in this section we have presented a geometric method for producing from the continuous hilbert space @xmath1 a discrete , uniform sampling @xmath49 . because all the states in the discrete set are geometrically equivalent , @xmath51 represents a generalized platonic solid in @xmath195 this method is closely related to the stabilizer formalism of quantum error - correcting codes .",

    "though computation over the discrete set @xmath51 is clearly less powerful than computation in the full @xmath1 , it is potentially more powerful than classical computation .",
    "in this last section , we present an alternate approach to discretization that addresses the hilbert space directly , without reference to operators in @xmath1 or the relevant transformation groups .    our strategy here is the following ( we note @xmath197 ) : the normalization condition , together with the writing of complex numbers as pairs of real numbers , identifies the hilbert space @xmath1 to the high - dimensional sphere @xmath198 embedded in @xmath199 . in order to discretize these hyperspheres ,",
    "we use the successive shells of dense lattices in @xmath199 . at the same time",

    "the hopf map that is used here in the two - qubit case is entanglement sensitive , which translates here in grouping sets of equally entangled qubit states .",

    "we now give two possible ( dual ) coordinates for its vertices , in each case as a real quadruplet and a complex pair .",
    "the correspondence between real quadruplets and complex pairs amounts simply to taking the first two ( last two ) real numbers as the real and imaginary part of the first ( second ) complex number .",
    "the first ( second ) complex number in the pair corresponds to @xmath219 ( @xmath220 ) .    a first set , denoted @xmath221 is the union of the eight permutations of type @xmath222 and the sixteen permutations of type @xmath223 .",

    "since the states @xmath241 only differ from @xmath242 by a global phase , they map onto the same six points on the bloch sphere .        as for the one - qubit case ,",

    "we shall focus here on the set of @xmath211 sites belonging to the @xmath210 first shell that forms the gosset polytope and , as for the one - qubit case , enumerate the physical states they represent .",

    "the points can be hopf mapped , as described elsewheremosseri - dandolof , onto the base space @xmath253 . the location of the mapped point is intimately related to the entanglement of the corresponding two - qubit state .",
    "indeed , the hopf map is simply described as a first map which sends the pair @xmath262 onto the quaternion @xmath263 ( which is sent to infinity if @xmath264 ) , followed by an inverse stereographic map which sends @xmath265 to @xmath266 a main result is that the hopf map is sensitive to entanglement : for separable states , @xmath265 is simply a complex number , not a generic quaternion ; conversely , for maximally entangled states ( mes ) , the purely complex part of @xmath265 vanishes .",

    "it is then easy to verify that the sets @xmath274 to @xmath275 correspond to separable states , while sets @xmath276 to @xmath277 correspond to maximally entangled states . the correspondence between vertices and states is made by transforming back the quaternion pairs into complex quadruplets whose terms are ( @xmath278 ) .",

    "since quaternion multiplication is non - commutative , this distinction is important in going back and forth between the lattice points and the states .",
    "consider the set @xmath282 corresponding to the twenty - four states such that @xmath283 , and which reads @xmath284 as a whole , the six sets @xmath285 @xmath286 encompass @xmath287 vertices , forming altogether @xmath288 physical states , with four values of the global phase for each qubit state .",
    "note that the precise value of the phases are important here in order that our discretization procedure uniformly cover the full hilbert space . using the above defined eigenstates of the one - qubit pauli matrices , these states read:@xmath289 where @xmath290  triggers the global phase .",
    "each of the nine entries stands for the four possible sign combinations , leading to the announced thirty - six physical states .",
    "a simple view of these separable states consists in relating them to the product  of two octahedra , each one belonging to the bloch sphere of the individual qubits .",
    "the remaining four sets ( altogether @xmath291 sites ) lead to a slightly more subtle structure .",
    "we find a total of twenty - four different physical mes , with four phase - distinct two - qubit states for each .",
    "but in the present case , the phase - distinct states actually belong to two different  sets , either @xmath292 or @xmath293    as an example , we consider the set @xmath276 and enumerate the states corresponding to , say , the quaternion pair @xmath294 which translates into the complex quadruplet @xmath295 and therefore to the mes : @xmath296 the shortened notation @xmath297 stands for @xmath298 there is only one other element in @xmath299 the pair @xmath300 , corresponding to @xmath301 the other two elements belong to the set @xmath302 and read @xmath303 and @xmath304 associated respectively to the states @xmath305 and @xmath306 . before giving the full list of states ,",

    "thus far , this alternate technique has provided compelling confirmation of the results from section 2 .",
    "however , the present purely geometric approach does not describe the discrete set s transformation group .",
    "this point could be in principle addressed , albeit in a much less transparent way than in the first part of this paper , by using the @xmath210 lattice point group ( which has a high order ) and finding the subgroup of rotations which survive the hopf map .",
    "but this lattice approach does have the benefit of allowing discrete sets with a finer minimum distance ( i.e. @xmath326 ) to be explored in a straightforward manner : while the first shell of @xmath210 provides the discrete set with a minimum distance of @xmath2 , a finer discretization might be achieved by considering the higher order shells in @xmath327 .",
    "this construction would provide a uniform set of two - qubit states , some of which would have intermediate entanglement .",
    "a note of caution is in order here , since we are only interested in describing normalized quantum states .",
    "lattice points which are aligned , as viewed from the origin , contribute to the same two - qubit state .",

    "we do not give here a detailed description of these finer discretizations of @xmath325 .",
    "however , we note that the number @xmath328 of sites on the @xmath329 shell around an @xmath210 vertex is simply given by@xcite @xmath330 where @xmath331 denotes integers which divide @xmath332 . the table below displays these numbers for the first four shells . again , the physical states are obtained from these two - qubit states by modding out a global phase .",
    "the shell by shell analysis , and its relation to the hopf map , was done elsewhere@xcite .",
    "it allows us to get points on the second shell corresponding to states having concurrence @xmath333 .",
    "the third  shell contributes states of concurrence @xmath334 @xmath335 @xmath336 @xmath337 @xmath338 and @xmath339      a second advantage of our lattice approach over the pseudostabilizer approach is that it allows a discussion of discrete sets of _ mixed _ states .",
    "it is well known that the full set of one - qubit mixed states can be obtained by tracing out one qubit of generic two - qubit pure states .",
    "mixed states are represented by points inside the so - called bloch ball ,  bounded by the pure - state bloch sphere . in the context of generalizing the bloch sphere for two - qubit pure states using the @xmath244 hopf fibration@xcite",
    ", it was shown that the bloch ball corresponds precisely to the restriction to the triplet @xmath340 on the base space @xmath253 .",
    "this describes mixed states obtained upon tracing out the second qubit . with this in mind , we are tempted to propose , in parallel to the two - qubit pure state discretization , an @xmath210-related discretization of the bloch ball .    from the @xmath210 first shell ,",
    "one gets the six permutations @xmath341 , corresponding to pure states on the bloch sphere ( the traced separable two - qubit states ) forming an octahedron .",
    "but one also gets the point @xmath342 , the bloch ball centre , corresponding to traced maximally entangled states .",

    "the pseudostabilizer and dense lattice strategies were done independently , and their agreement provides a compelling confirmation of our results , while also calling for a better understanding of their possible deeper relationship . while the dense lattice strategy is less easily focused on the transformation groups leaving the discrete sets invariant , it does have the advantage of allowing a discussion of discrete sets with a smaller minimum distance between states , and also of discrete sets of mixed states .",
    "looking ahead , a discretization of higher - dimensional hilbert spaces may be achieved in the dense lattice approach by using high - dimensional lattices in @xmath27 dimensions@xcite .",
