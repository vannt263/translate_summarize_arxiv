    "mira variables are optically - visible long - period variable stars with large - amplitude pulsations ( @xmath2 ) and stellar periods over 100  days .",
    "the stars have reached an advanced stage of evolution on the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) .",
    "miras typically have photospheric radii of @xmath3r@xmath4 , stellar luminosities of @xmath5l@xmath4 and effective temperatures of @xmath62500  k.    during their evolution on the agb , miras develop increasingly strong stellar winds , in which mass is lost from their outer hydrogen envelopes , with mass - loss rates @xmath7 above 10@xmath8  m@xmath4yr@xmath1 and outflow velocities of typically 8kms@xmath1 . such mass - loss plays a critical role in their subsequent stellar evolution , leading eventually to the formation of a white dwarf star and planetary nebula .",
    "the circumstellar mass - loss of miras and other related agb stars is driven by radiation pressure on solid grains , which form in the extended hydrogen atmospheres at heights of several stellar radii .",
    "once formed , the grains are rapidly accelerated outwards , while grain  gas collisions lead to an expanding circumstellar envelope @xcite .",
    "the radiation pressure model is well established but the physical conditions and mass - loss processes within the grain formation zone , are poorly understood .",
    "it is generally accepted that the high mass - loss rates are related to the stellar pulsations and strong shock waves which propagate outwards during each pulsation cycle , increasing the mass density in the upper stellar atmospheres to a height where dust formation occurs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "shock velocities in the optically visible photospheres have been estimated from hydrogen balmer and metallic emission lines to be between 10 and 90  kms@xmath1 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite and @xcite argued that at centimetre wavelengths , a post - shock partially - ionised layer , extending to several stellar radii , would emit optically thick thermal free - free emission . for a mira variable at a distance of several hundred parsec , the expected peak flux density from such a layer would be several milli - janskys which is easily detectable .",
    "in addition , thermal emission from the stellar photosphere and non - thermal radio emission associated with stellar flare activity might also be detectable .",
    "so far , radio continuum emission has been detected from approximately 15  miras and semi - regular variables ( section 4 ) .",
    "@xcite reported the detection of optically - thick thermal continuum emission from six nearby long - period variable stars .",
    "their vla radio flux densities are a factor of about two larger than expected for emission from the optical stellar photospheres alone .",
    "@xcite provided a convincing model for their data in which the radio emission occurs from a ` radio photosphere ' , of about twice the optical diameter , where the gas temperature and density are approximately 1600  k and @xmath9  @xmath10 respectively .",
    "for these sources , the low radio brightness temperatures are not consistent with strong shock activity in the radio emitting regions .",
    "however , earlier radio studies of several sources , including r  aql , @xmath11  cet and cw  leo ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) reported much stronger radio flux densities , consistent with higher brightness temperatures .    in this paper",
    "we describe a survey in which we used the australia telescope compact array ( _ atca _ ) to search for radio continuum emission at @xmath12 and 6  cm from a sample of 34  miras and semi - regular variables .",
    "the primary aim of this study was to use radio continuum flux densities or their upper limits as a means of investigating whether high radio brightness temperatures , consistent with strong shock activity , may be present in some sources .",
    "a sample of 34 miras and semi - regular variables was selected using the data in the fourth edition of the general catalogue of variable stars @xcite . of the 34 sources , 26 are southern mira variables with declinations below @xmath13 and visual magnitudes at maximum brightness of @xmath14 .",
    "one of the selected miras , r  aqr , is a well - known symbiotic binary star .",
    "in addition , three northern miras , u  ori , u  her and r  aql were also observed : u  ori and u  her as they have well - studied oh maser properties @xcite and r  aql as it has been previously detected in radio continuum emission .",
    "the sample also included five southern sources , r  pic , l@xmath15  pup , v  hya , w  hya and s  pav , which are classified as semi - regular variables but have well - defined light variations .",
    "the semi - regular variables have smaller amplitude pulsations and lower mass - loss rates than the miras and might be expected to have weaker shocks .",

    "strong flare activity and non - thermal emission has been reported from several single - dish observations : @xcite observed a rapid rise in the 10.6 ghz emission from 23 to 240  mjy over a period of only 30 minutes .",
    "less intense , but still unusually strong emission from r aql was later observed by @xcite , while @xcite detected non - thermal emission with a spectral index , between 2.3 and 8.4  ghz , of @xmath95 .",
    "a possible explanation for such a steep spectral index is non - thermal synchroton emission from electrons accelerated by a strong stellar shock @xcite .",
    "the more recent interferometric data for r aql however shows no evidence for excess continuum emission .",
    "our 8 ghz upper limit of 0.2 mjy is consistent with the 1990 vla upper limit of 0.09 mjy @xcite .",
    "the association of the earlier single - dish detections ( which did not have accurate radio positions ) with the stellar source is unclear .",
    "we do not however rule out the possibility that unusual and irregular flare activity may occur from r aql .    for w hya ,",
    "our upper limit of 0.25 mjy is slightly lower than the mean flux density of 0.36  mjy obtained by @xcite .",
    "their observations partially resolved the stellar disk , with an average diameter of 0.08 @xmath96 arcsec and a brightness temperature of 1,500 @xmath40 570  k .    for @xmath11 cet ,",
    "the three - sigma detection of @xcite is a marginal result .",
    "as this is inconsistent with both @xcite and @xcite , the published detection is probably spurious .",
    "@xcite found marginal evidence for periodic variability in the radio continuum emission with a mean flux density at 8.4 ghz of 0.42 mjy and peak - to - mean ratio of @xmath6 1.1 . from a periodic fit to the radio fluxes they showed that such variability could be explained by a modulation of the thermal radio emission caused by a weak pulsation - driven stellar shock propagating through the radio - photosphere , with a shock velocity of approximately 7  kms@xmath1 .",
    "our 3-sigma upper limit at 8.6 ghz of @xmath6 0.25 mjy is lower than the 8.4 ghz flux densities of 0.35 to 0.49  mjy obtained by reid & menten in 19901991 .",
    "the cause of the discrepancy between the vla flux densities and the atca flux density limit , obtained five years later , is unclear .",
    "however , it is well - known that pulsations amplitudes and shock strengths vary from cycle - to - cycle and some variation in the radio continuum emission appears likely .",
    "source variability may also occur on a longer timescales .",
    "@xcite showed that the optical size of @xmath11  cet , measured at wavelengths between 700 and 900  nm , increased systematically by a factor of 1.8 between 1991 september and 1993 december .",
    "the increase in optical size may imply an episode of increased mass - loss and a build - up of the circumstellar dust shell .",
    "such an enhancement of circumstellar dust density may damp the shock waves in the inner part of the stellar envelope @xcite .",
    "the star @xmath11  cet is a symbiotic binary comprising a variable red giant ( mira  a ) and an companion ( possibly a white dwarf , mira  b ) accreting material from the primary .",
    "it was resolved in vla observations of @xcite .",
    "the radio fluxes at 8.5 , 14.9 , 22.5 and 43.3  ghz were measured separately for both components at several epochs in 20042005 . in table  2we list only the fluxes measured for the red - giant component mira  a.    for 11 of the sources listed in table 2 ( @xmath11 cet , @xmath72 per , @xmath76 gem , r leo , rw lmi , w hya , g her , r lyr , r aql , @xmath90 cyg and r cas ) the detected radio continuum flux densities agree well with the radio - photosphere model of @xcite . for these sources we estimate brightness temperatures of 1500@xmath884000",
    "k indicating little if any excess emission . from the shock model given in paper i ,",
    "the radio brightness temperatures indicate that only weak or moderate shock strengths are possible with shock velocities below @xmath6 10  km  s@xmath1 .",
    "as discussed by @xcite , at temperatures between @xmath6 1000 and 4000  k , free electrons occur primarily from elements such as potassium , sodium and calcium which , although far less abundant , have much lower ionisation potentials than hydrogen .",
    "their calculations show that the dominant source of the free - free opacity occurs from interactions between free electrons from ionised metals with neutral hydrogen atoms and molecules .      excluding r  aql and @xmath11  cet ( discussed above ) , only three sources in table 2 , cw leo , v hya and @xmath97 her show a strong excess of radio continuum emission above the levels expected for radio photospheres .",
    "we note that two of the three sources , cw leo and v hya are n - type agb carbon stars .",
    "the carbon stars represent around eight per cent of agb stars and have c / o ratios enhanced surface carbon abundances due to a dredge - up of processed material .",
    "these stars have high mass loss rates and are considered likely to be near the end of the agb stage of evolution .",
    "cw leo ( = irc@xmath4110216 ) is an extreme carbon star ( c9 ) and a strong source of molecular emission , with over 50 molecular species detected from its circumstellar envelope . from an analysis of the co properties , @xcite",
    "estimate the distance to be 150  pc .",
    "for this distance , the  cm radio continuum flux densities indicate radio brightness temperatures between @xmath65,000 and 15,000  k. for our model , the corresponding shock velocities are between 11 and 24  km  s@xmath1 . for cw  leo ,",
    "the radio continuum emission almost certainly occurs from a chromospheric region .",
    "iue ultraviolet spectra with ionised emission features from mgii , cii and feii have shown that both oxygen - rich and carbon - rich agb stars have stellar chromospheres @xcite .",
    "@xcite provided a chromospheric model for n - type carbon stars . in their model",
    "the inner chromospheres have a steep temperature gradient and an outwards expansion velocity of around 50  kms@xmath1 , while the outer chromospheres are nearly static relative to the stellar photospheres .",
    "the heating mechanisms in the chromospheres of late - type stars are not well understood .",
    "however , if strong shocks are present then some chromospheric heating is likely to occur due to the dissipation of shock energy and heating of the post - shock gas .",
    "@xcite monitored cw  leo in 19911993 in the radio continuum with vla at 8.4 , 14.9 and 22.5  ghz ( see table  2 ) .",
    "they found possible variability correlated with the infrared phase and a spectral index very close to 2 .",
    "the variability , observed flux densities and upper limit on the source size are consistent with the emission arising from the stellar photosphere or a slightly larger radio photosphere . using the model of @xcite ,",
    "we have estimated shock velocities that would heat the radio photosphere to temperatures listed in table  2 ; we have obtained @xmath98  km  s@xmath1 .",
    "v hya is also an extreme ( c9 ) carbon star .",
    "co imaging of v hya has shown that most of the stellar mass - loss occurs within a high - velocity wide - angle bipolar outflow @xcite .",
    "such a geometry indicates that the star is likely to be close to leaving the agb and may be in a short - lived common envelope binary system .",
    "@xcite find that along the bipolar axis there is a strong velocity gradient with velocities decreasing outwards from over 50  kms@xmath1 at the inner boundary to around 8  kms@xmath1 at the outer boundary . within the bipolar cones , multiple shocks",
    "are likely to occur as faster moving gas collides with more slowly moving material . from this model and the above discussion we suggest that the radio continuum emission from v hya , detected by @xcite , has two possible sources ; chromospheric emission from the outer atmosphere and emission from high - velocity shocked regions located near the base of the bipolar outflows .",
    "finally , @xmath97 her is an m5ii star which belongs to a visual binary system . for this source",
    "the 5@xmath8815 ghz spectral index of 0.8 is close to the canonical value of 0.6 for thermal emission from an ionised wind expanding at a constant velocity ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite interpret the emission from this source as thermal emission occuring from a chromospheric region of temperature @xmath610,000  k and radius @xmath6 two stellar radii .",
    "here we note that the spectral index of 0.8 is consistent with expansion in the stellar chromosphere .",
    "considerable controversy exists on the interpretation of optical spectra of m - type mira and semi - regular variables .",
    "these characteristically show hydrogen balmer and metallic line emission lines , which are strongest near maximum light and decline in intensity with increasing phase towards minimum light .",
    "the linewidths of the emission lines are also strongly phase dependent with full widths of typically 80  kms@xmath1 near light maximum and 40  kms@xmath1 near light minimum ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) .    from an analysis of the balmer linewidths , @xcite",
    "advocate a model in which the double - peaked structure of the h@xmath99 emission line profiles observed in some m - type miras occurs from the front and back - side of a single spherical shock wave , with shock velocities estimated , in most cases , to be between 40 and 70  kms@xmath1 . for s",
    "car , @xcite estimated a maximum shock velocity of 90  kms@xmath1 .",
    "other authors determine smaller shock velocities by arguing that multiple shocks exist simultaneously in mira atmospheres @xcite . in this case , the h@xmath99 emission line profiles may have complex shapes .",
    "@xcite found three components in the h@xmath99 line profiles of several s - type miras .",
    "these were modelled as emission from different ionised layers , associated with a ` main ' outward shock and an ` inner ' shock caused by infalling post - main - shock gas .",
    "the shock velocities , inferred by this model , are below 40  kms@xmath1 .",
    "from the radial velocities of optical hydrogen and metallic emission lines , @xcite and @xcite showed that at maximum light the post - shock emission region has an outwards velocity of 1020  kms@xmath1 .",
    "similar velocities have also been obtained from low - opacity ultraviolet emission lines @xcite .",
    "@xcite demonstrate that the radial velocities decrease with increasing phase , and are almost zero at minimum light .",
    "this can be interpreted as a decrease in shock strength as a shock wave moves outwards through the stellar atmosphere , while the decrease in linewidth is likely to reflect a decrease in temperature and hence doppler broadening behind the shock front .    in the present study",
    "we have argued that the lack of any detected radio continuum emission from the 11 nearest sources in our sample is consistent with an upper limit to stellar shock velocities of around 67  kms@xmath1 near two stellar radii .",
    "a similar conclusion , based on the lack of strong radio variability , was also reached by @xcite .",
    "the lack of radio continuum detections in the present study clearly favours low shock velocities and/or damping of the shock energy within the inner few stellar radii .",
    "we have made a sensitive search with the _ atca _ for radio continuum emission at 3 and 6  cm from 34 mira and semi - regular variable stars .",
    "our search provided no detections of radio continuum emission , apart from for r  aqr which is a well known symbiotic binary system . in 1995",
    "november the radio emission from r aqr was in a quiescent state .    from the upper limits to the flux densities determined for the other 33 sources , we have estimated upper limits to the gas brightness temperatures near two stellar radii at a characteristic size of @xmath0  cm .",
    "shock velocities have been estimated using the model presented by @xcite .    for the six nearest sources in the _ atca _ survey , with distances within 140  pc ,",
    "we obtain brightness temperatures below 2,300  k indicating that there is no excess of radio continuum above the levels expected from the radio - photosphere model of @xcite . from previously published detections of centimetre continuum emission",
    "we find that for 10 out of 13 sources the detected flux densities indicate radio brightness temperatures below 4,000  k. in the model of @xcite we have used , a brightness temperature limit of 4,000  k corresponds to a shock velocity limit of @xmath610  kms@xmath1 .    only three long - period variable stars of those observed by other authors ,",
    "cw leo , v hya and @xmath84 her , show a strong excess of radio continuum emission . in each case , the strong continuum emission is likely to be associated with a stellar chromosphere .",
