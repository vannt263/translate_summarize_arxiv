    "<S> after the exclusion of these fundamental mechanisms of decoherence , it seems highly plausible that the decay of the spin - exchange oscillations arises from technical imperfections ( associated e.g. to the fast switching of the magnetic field ) .    in conclusion , </S>",
    "<S> we have observed for the first time fast , long - lived inter - orbital spin - exchange oscillations by exploiting a system of ultracold ael fermions trapped in a 3d optical lattice . </S>",
    "<S> the direct observation of several periods of these oscillations has allowed us to demonstrate the coherence of the process and to measure the exchange interaction strength in an accurate , model - independent way . </S>",
    "<S> we note that , if compared with the spin dynamics observed in other atomic systems , arising from either small differences in the scattering lengths @xcite or from second - order tunnelling between adjacent sites of an optical lattice @xcite , the oscillation that we have measured is significantly fast . in particular , the exchange energy @xmath22 , on the order of @xmath120 khz , is much larger than either the fermi ( @xmath121 ) and the thermal ( @xmath122 ) energies , which makes @xmath0yb remarkably interesting for the observation of quantum magnetism in a two - orbital system with su(n ) interaction symmetry @xcite . the direct measurement of @xmath123 has also allowed us to provide a determination of the inter - orbital spin - triplet scattering length , which exceeds the spin - singlet one by @xmath124 times . besides , from a wider point of view , this strong spin - exchange interaction entangles two stable internal degrees of freedom of the atom @xcite , which can be independently and coherently manipulated , opening new realistic possibilities for both quantum information processing and quantum simulation .    </S>",
