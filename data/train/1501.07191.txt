    "the cosmological recombination epoch marks an extended period over which electrons recombine with protons and helium nuclei as cosmological expansion and cooling cause the universe to transition from a fully ionized primordial plasma to a gas of almost completely neutral hydrogen and helium atoms . in the cosmological concordance model , the cosmological recombination epoch spans redshifts @xmath5 for hydrogen and for helium recombination the corresponding redshifts are @xmath6 for heii @xmath2 hei and @xmath7 for heiii @xmath2 heii . at these redshifts ,",
    "electrons and photons are tightly coupled through energy exchange via compton scattering and the thermodynamic temperature of electrons and photons are almost exactly equal ( at @xmath8  k ) . during hydrogen recombination ,",
    "once even a small neutral fraction builds up , photons emitted in any free - bound transition to the ground state would almost immediately be re - absorbed by a nearby neutral hydrogen atom , thereby effectively compensating for the electron captured @xcite .",
    "hydrogen recombination therefore relies on free - bound transitions to excited states followed by a trickle down to the ground state with the subsequent emission of numerous recombination photons . during this process",
    ", atoms are frequently photo - ionized by the huge number of cmb photons and after multiple dissociations and recaptures the atoms finally reach the ground state , emitting photons in the lyman-@xmath9 resonance or the @xmath10@xmath11 two - photon continuum @xcite and , at low frequencies , in transitions among excited states @xcite .",
    "recombination is expected to be stalled as the ambient radiation temperature in the lyman-@xmath9 transition wavelength rises and is balanced in a quasi - static equilibrium with populations in the 1@xmath12 and 2@xmath13 states .",
    "recombination thus depends on the depletion rate of @xmath14 atoms and removal of the excess brightness in the ambient lyman-@xmath9 line by hubble expansion and two photon decay from the 2@xmath12 state .",
    "these processes occur at a rate that is @xmath15 times slower than the spontaneous transition probability of the lyman-@xmath9 and play a vital role in controlling the dynamics of recombination . about @xmath16 of all hydrogen atoms",
    "become neutral through the @xmath10@xmath11 two - photon channel @xcite , which has a vacuum decay rate of only @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "consequently , hydrogen recombination is expected to be substantially delayed compared to what might be expected assuming equilibrium saha recombination at the average densities and temperatures typical for our universe .    as the number of photons per baryon is roughly @xmath18 ,",
    "radiative processes including stimulated recombination , induced emission and absorption of photons dominate the populating of atomic levels rather than collisions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as the universe gradually expands and recombination proceeds by uncompensated bound - bound and free - bound transitions , the level populations of atomic species slowly fall out of equilibrium with the radiation field , which causes departures of the cmb spectrum from an ideal planck form .",
    "the spectral lines corresponding to these transitions are predicted to appear as redshifted additive deviations to the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) spectrum , with most of the hydrogen lines originating from redshift @xmath19 @xcite ; the observable intensity of these spectral lines is furthermore expected to be uniform on the sky and unpolarized .",
    "the lines are also substantially broadened owing to the extended recombination time ( and electron scattering in the case of heii recombination ) . at low frequencies ,",
    "adjacent lines overlap substantially and hence the cosmological recombination radiation is expected to manifest itself as spectral ` ripples ' riding on a smooth continuum , which are together an additive component of the extragalactic background light extending over radio , microwaves and near ir wavelengths .",
    "improvements in our understanding of the recombination history within the framework provided by the concordance cosmology , the role of @xmath10@xmath11 two - photon decay and other factors governing the depletion of the @xmath14 level population , the importance of the contribution of helium to the recombination process , progress in related atomic physics and , last but not the least important , substantial improvements in computing power have all contributed to much improved and more realistic modeling of the epoch in question ( see * ? ? ?",

    "helium contributes locally at a typical level of @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "owing to the substantial line broadening resulting from the extended period of recombination , at low frequencies the recombination radiation appears as ( i ) a smooth continuum to the radio , microwave and near ir backgrounds , plus ( ii ) more easily distinguishable spectral ripples that has a quasi - periodic frequency dependence .",

    "it may be noted here that most of the recombination of hydrogen and helium and thus the spectral signatures that arise from these processes occur over redshifts _ before _ the formation of the cmb anisotropies that occurred near the peak of the thomson visibility function : spectral lines from transitions associated with the hydrogen atoms arise from a redshift range of 13001400 .",
    "hence detections of the recombination lines with increasing accuracy provides a way of constraining the thermal evolution of the universe beyond the last scattering surface ( see below ) .",

    "_ detection of cosmological recombination lines allows us to gain a better understanding of the thermal history of our universe on the basis of the different redshifts of hydrogen and helium recombination .",
    "for instance , it is possible to compute the recombination spectrum assuming that the ambient radiation field is a distorted blackbody , where the distortion is of @xmath24-type @xcite .",
    "the @xmath24-distortion @xcite could arise from the blue - shifting of photons by comptonization in the early universe , due to energy - release at @xmath25 , when the redistribution of photons in energy by compton scattering becomes inefficient @xcite .",

    "the contributions from hydrogen and helium to the total recombination spectrum depends both on the value of @xmath24 parameter and when the distortion was created @xcite .",
    "thus the cosmological recombination radiation may allow distinguishing between compton @xmath24-distortions that were caused by energy release before or after the epoch of recombination .",

    "these calculations ensure that the science return from _ planck _ and",
    "upcoming cmb experiments is not compromised by inaccuracies in the recombination model @xcite .",
    "however , the detailed dynamics of the recombination process is also reflected in the shape and position of the recombination features . any departures of the recombination spectrum from the theoretical predictions will indicate presence of some non - standard process ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "thus , by observing the recombination radiation we can directly confront our understanding of recombination physics with experimental evidence .",
    "detecting nk amplitude fluctuations in the extragalactic background brightness , which are indeed a tiny perturbation to the orders of magnitude larger sky brightness temperature that arises from the cmb , extragalactic sources and galactic emission , is a very challenging problem .",
    "however , we opine that receiver technology and the ability to produce detector arrays have progressed to the point where it is meaningful to look at the practical issues . in this first paper , we study the feasibility of such a detection by modeling the sky spectrum as recorded by an ideal instrument and examine whether it is at all possible to recover the weak signal embedded in the substantially brighter galactic and extragalactic foregrounds .",
    "we discuss methods for fitting to data for the recovery or detection of the faint recombination line spectrum when observed embedded in the substantially brighter cosmic radio background .",
    "we also compute optimal observing frequencies for the detection and associated signal - to - noise ratio for detection with realistic receivers and a purpose - built array of spectral radiometers with due consideration to contribution from atmospheric emission further guided by radio frequency interference ( rfi ) over the band .",
    "some of the challenges are very similar to those for the detection of the global 21 cm signal ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; however , the recombination ripples benefit from their unique frequency dependence , which is hard to mimic by other sources and instrumental effects .",
    "in this section , we discuss the frequency dependence of the spectral signal and that of the background brightness and additive instrument noise to arrive at estimates for signal - to - noise ratio versus frequency for detection of the line structure .",

    "we now address the problem of identifying the most suitable frequency range for the experimental detection of recombination lines from the epoch of recombination by first considering the relative amplitude of the spectral ripples arising from recombination to the noise in the detection .",
    "the total system noise is the additive sum of the spatially - varying sky background , consisting of contributions from discrete and diffuse galactic and extragalactic sources in the sky , the cosmic microwave background and the cosmic infra - red background , as well as effects of atmospheric emission , plus receiver noise that is at lowest quantum noise associated with zero - point fluctuations .",
    "this sets a fundamental limit on the achievable detection sensitivity . later in this section",
    "we also consider detection using receivers that have more realistic noise temperatures consistent with current technology .",
    "we also discuss constraints arising from the requirement that within the observing band we need to cover at least a distinctive segment of the quasi - periodic cosmological signal , which might provide a unique template specific to cosmological recombination that would be difficult to mimic by other astrophysical sources , atmospheric emission , rfi or instrumental effects .    as a representation of the telescope system noise contribution from additive sky radiation , we construct a model spectrum of the background sky brightness all the way from 50  mhz up to 4  thz , extending to just beyond the redshifted lyman-@xmath9 line that is essentially the highest frequency at which we may expect spectral features arising from cosmological recombination .",
    "we adopt the model presented in @xcite for the galactic and extragalactic contributions to sky brightness and derive sky temperatures towards the galactic pole at 150 , 408 and 1420  mhz .",
    "a fit of a power - law form to these brightness estimates yields a temperature spectral index of @xmath31 and a normalization corresponding to sky brightness of 438  k at 100  mhz ; this model spectrum towards the galactic pole is adopted to represent the contribution to system noise from galactic emission plus extragalactic discrete sources .",
    "we also include a component that is an estimate of the far and mid - infrared background ; this model is derived from data in table  47 of @xcite . for the receiver noise , we compute the system temperature for two cases : ( i ) assuming a state of the art cryogenically cooled receiver with noise temperature of 1  k above quantum noise @xcite and ( ii ) that for an uncooled receiver with a more realistic noise temperature of 14  k plus quantum noise @xcite .",
    "we use the _ am _ atmospheric model @xcite with typical conditions at the chajnantor plateau site to derive the atmospheric opacity versus frequency .",
    "the system temperature is finally translated to above atmosphere using this opacity so that it may be combined with the signal intensity derived above for calculating the signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "our adopted model spectrum for the above - atmosphere system temperature is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lines_vs_sky_tcmb_trec ] along with the spectrum of the expected recombination signal .    as a criterion for the minimum bandwidth required at any observing frequency",
    "we choose a spectral window that includes at least two adjacent broad recombination spectral lines that arise from @xmath28 ( @xmath9 ) transitions .",
    "this minimum bandwidth would correspond to the spacing between peaks of @xmath9 transitions from @xmath32 and @xmath33 shells .",
    "such a spectral window would be expected to include a sufficiently high order of the variation in the signal so as to give it a distinctive signature .",
    "[ fig : bw_vs_nu ] shows the ratio of this minimum bandwidth to the nominal center frequency versus the center frequency .",
    "the detection of recombination epoch spectral lines clearly requires a larger fractional bandwidth at higher frequencies .",
    "a ratio less than unity implies that an octave bandwidth at the observing frequency would contain more than two adjacent recombination lines , satisfying our criterion .",
    "the ratio falls below unity for observing frequencies below about 18  ghz , which implies that detecting the cosmological line spectrum would require bandwidths exceeding an octave if the center frequency were to exceed 18  ghz .",
    "receivers with bandwidths wider than an octave are susceptible to self - generated radio frequency interference from harmonics of system clocks and local oscillator frequencies ; therefore , although sensitivity for a detection would undoubtedly improve with wider observing bands , for the ultra - sensitive detection experiment being considered herein it would be unwise to attempt detection at frequencies above this value .    as an estimate of the detectable signal from hydrogen recombination , we require a measure of the peak - to - peak spectral variations versus observing frequency .",
    "we first fit a spline through the points in the recombination line intensity template that are at frequencies corresponding to the peaks of the @xmath28 hydrogen transitions .",
    "we use a redshift that is a mean value , which we determine by comparing the locations of the peaks in the predicted recombination line spectrum with the corresponding locations given by the rydberg formula . subtracting the spline",
    "fit gives a residual recombination line spectrum that represents the detectable signal in an observation from which a mean spectral baseline has been subtracted . in fig .",
    "[ fig : sig_cont ] we plot the strength of the expected recombination line signal defined as half the peak - to - peak amplitude of the baseline subtracted ripples expected in the observed band , versus observing frequency . with frequency , the expected ripple amplitude increases by orders of magnitude across the frequency range we consider here .",
    "it may be noted that although in terms of spectral intensity this ripple signal amplitude increases with frequency , as shown above the number of spectral ripples within any octave bandwidth decreases with increasing frequency .",
    "thus , a frequency regime that maximizes both aspects is sought .",
    "( see sect .",
    "[ sec : freq_choice ] )      the detection of spectral lines from cosmological recombination involves first subtracting a baseline from the observed spectrum to remove the relatively smoother foregrounds and cmb , after which the residual spectral segment may be examined for the expected spectral ripple using a matched filter .",
    "we evaluate here the signal - to - noise ratio for a detection method where an estimate of the amplitude of any spectral ripple that matches a theoretical template is derived from the measurement .",
    "the expected signal , following baseline subtraction , is similar to a sinusoidal ripple that has a period that varies systematically across the spectral segment .",
    "the noise or uncertainty in the estimate of the amplitude of the ripple is derived from the measurement errors in the measured intensities in the spectral channels , and from the propagation of errors from these measurements to the derived estimate of the amplitude of the signal present in the data .",
    "the measurement errors in channel data depend on the system noise , which originates from the sky brightness and receiver noise , and on the channel bandwidth and integration time .",
    "we consider here the ideal scenario where the measurement data  the bandpass calibrated spectrum of the cosmic radio background from which a baseline has been subtracted  contains a spectral ripple that is the same as the expected theoretical template without any other residual contamination . in this case where the signal amplitude is estimated using a matched filter derived from the template , we obtain a signal - to - noise ratio that is limited purely by the noise present in the spectral channels .",
    "this case study admittedly represents an optimistic estimate of the signal - to - noise ratio attainable .",
    "the residual spectrum after baseline subtraction is assumed to have @xmath34 frequency channels , each of bandwidth @xmath35 .",
    "the sampled residual sinusoidal ripple , which is also the template of the expected ripply recombination lines following baseline subtraction , is given by @xmath36 and has an amplitude of @xmath37 . from this template of the expected signal",
    "we define a weighting function @xmath38 , which is defined such that the weighted sum of @xmath36 is @xmath37 .",
    "the matched filter is thus the weighted summation of the observed spectrum and the matched filtering yields an estimate of the amplitude @xmath39 of the ripple from recombination : @xmath40 the template representing the expectation and the corresponding weighting function may be scaled appropriately to search the data for signatures of the ripple from recombination assuming a range of effective redshifts for the recombination lines .",
    "the weighting function is hence similar to the template in that it has the same ripple form but with an amplitude @xmath41 . if the signal matches the template , the requirement that @xmath42 ought to equal @xmath37 leads to the condition that @xmath43 .    the uncertainty in the channel data in the residual spectrum @xmath36 is @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the system temperature and @xmath46 is the total integration time .",
    "propagating this error in the channel data to the error @xmath47 in the estimate of the amplitude of the ripple from recombination : @xmath48 the last step above follows from the result that the average value of the square of a sinusoidal wave is half the amplitude . substituting the earlier result that @xmath43 yields : @xmath49    thus the signal - to - noise ratio in the measurement is given by : @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the total bandwidth of the observed spectrum .",
    "for this estimate it is assumed that noise in the different channels is uncorrelated .      in fig .",
    "[ fig : snr_cmb_rec ] we show the estimated signal - to - noise ratio versus observing frequency to guide the choice of observing frequency . in creating this plot the signal",
    "is assumed to be half the peak - to - peak magnitude of the ripple , which is the amplitude shown in fig .",

    "the noise is assumed to be the system temperature ( from fig .",

    "the integration time is assumed to be 1  s. the figure shows the signal - to - noise ratio for the case where the system noise corresponds to quantum - noise limited receivers ( in green ) ; we also show in red the signal - to - noise ratio for a cryogenically cooled receiver with 1  k noise temperature and in blue this ratio for the case of uncooled 14  k receivers .",
    "all three traces are assuming an ideal case where the spectral ripple in the measurement data matches the predicted template exactly .",
    "detection with maximum signal - to - noise ratio suggests observing in the 16  ghz band . if we avoid the lower end of this band where galactic hi and terrestrial and satellite down - link related radio frequency interference is substantial , the 26  ghz band is suggested . observing in octave bandwidths within this range also satisfies the criterion that at least two cycles of ripples of the recombination line spectrum ought to be contained in the observed spectral segment ( see fig .",

    "the recombination lines from cosmological recombination are detected by a receiver along with foregrounds , which are averaged by the telescope beam over its response pattern on the sky .",
    "the averaging over a multitude of sources with different emission spectra , over the sky and along line of sight , results in a detected spectrum that would have an unknown form : even if the emissivity of the gas is a power - law form at every location , the spectral index does vary across the sky and along line of sight and , therefore , the averaging by the telescope beam would result in an observed spectrum that deviates from a single power law . a similar effect , related to the superposition of blackbodies inside the beam of an experiment , causes an inevitable @xmath24-type distortion of the cmb spectrum @xcite ; the superposition of blackbodies simply is not a blackbody anymore @xcite .",
    "it is necessary to detect the presence of the recombination line spectrum in the observed spectrum although the line spectrum has amplitude that is _ almost nine orders of magnitude smaller _ and the additive foreground is a complex spectrum of unknown form ! by simulating the sky spectrum as would be observed by an ideal system , this section addresses the question of whether such a detection is at all possible .",

    "the mathematical definition suggests that if @xmath68 , where @xmath82 is frequency , is the foreground model over a certain bandwidth , then we may adopt a functional form for @xmath68 that is a complete monotone within the bandwidth of interest .",
    "successive approximation of an analytic functional form to data may be done using a taylor approximation .",
    "the taylor series of an analytic function always converges about every point in its domain .",

    "it may be noted here that increasing further the order of the polynomial , whose coefficients are constrained such that the polynomial is a complete monotone , will only yield vanishingly smaller coefficients for the higher order terms . since the constraint on the polynomial forces it to remain smooth , once the recombination lines dominate the residual the residual is not minimized further by the introduction of higher order terms .",
    "thus we converge to a smooth completely monotonic approximation to the foreground that leaves the recombination line spectral structure as a residual to the fit , which no longer changes significantly with increasing the order of the completely monotonic polynomial .",

    "any small departure in the spectral radiometer from the ideal behavior assumed herein could critically affect the detection likelihood .",
    "studies of the effects of potential instrumental non - idealities , and confusion arising from additive astrophysical contaminants , which have not been considered here , will form the next step in our future work .",
    "the key investigations are listed below .    *",
    "the spectral radiometer radio telescope used to detect the weak cosmological recombination lines must be capable of achieving the required spurious - free dynamic range so as to recover the embedded cosmological signal in the measurement .",
    "this implies that the receiver configuration and calibration techniques must be specifically designed to minimize systematics and that any residual systematics are either well characterized or emendable to accurate modeling so as to enable unambiguous detection of the weak signal .",
    "a future work is the design of a suitable receiver configuration , observing strategies , gain stability and calibration methods to achieve the required accuracy in the measurement . * in our simulations",
    ", we have generated mock sky spectra as observed by an ideal frequency independent antenna beam .",
    "the spectral response of such an antenna is _ maximally smooth _ if all sources in the beam have spectra that are complete monotones . however , designing and fabricating an antenna that is frequency independent over an octave bandwidth is non - trivial .",
    "frequency dependence in the beam pattern and its sidelobes may result in a response that is no longer smooth and may confuse the detection of cosmological recombination .",
    "a study of this mode coupling of sky structure into spectral structure in a spectral radiometer , which depends on the type of frequency dependence in the beam pattern , would lead to design tolerances on the antenna element for this detection experiment .",
    "* the all - sky ` ripply ' signal arising from the epochs of hydrogen and helium recombination is inherently unpolarized and this spectral feature may be detected with an antenna that responds to any single polarization mode , either linear or circular .",
    "however , the foreground synchrotron emission from extragalactic sources as well as galactic emission is linearly polarized and faraday rotation during the line - of - sight propagation results in the received polarization position angle varying with observing frequency .",
    "this causes linearly polarized sources to appear with a ` ripply ' spectral structure in the response of linearly polarized antennas .",
    "one possible way of eliminating beam asymmetries and the effect of beam rotation across the sky is to rotate the array itself .",
    "a study of this mode coupling of polarized sky emission to spectral structure is a future study that will lead to design tolerances on the polarization properties of the antenna element and on the polarization calibration .",
    "the potential of using the unpolarised nature of the cosmological signal to discriminate it from polarised foregrounds is another aspect to be explored . *",
    "the spectral template of the additive ripple - like feature from cosmological hydrogen and helium recombination has a fairly accurate theoretical prediction .",
    "the near quasi - sinusoidal nature of this signal acts as a fingerprint providing a means to distinguish it from other weak cosmological signals .",
    "two such cosmological signals are the @xmath164 and @xmath24 distortions of the cmb @xcite . even within the standard cosmological model ,",
    "these distortions are created at amplitudes that are typically larger than the cosmological recombination radiation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a large average compton @xmath24 distortions , at the level of @xmath165 , is expected from reionization and structure formation @xcite and unresolved clusters and filaments @xcite . at low frequencies",
    ", this type of distortion only leads to a weak frequency dependent signal , @xmath166 with @xmath167 $ ] , making it is less problematic . for a @xmath164 distortion , the low frequency spectrum shows much richer structure , especially when varying time - dependence of the energy release mechanism ( fig .",

    "each of these introduce spectral features in the cmb with the @xmath164 distortion peaking at about 1  ghz . in an experiment optimized to detect ripples originating from the epochs of hydrogen and helium recombination",
    "it would be interesting to study whether @xmath164 and @xmath24 distortions of the cmb are a possible source of confusion or would themselves be detected as a positive by - product .",
    "similarly , the anomalous microwave emission from spinning dust ( see * ? ? ?",
