    "biomembranes are ubiquitous in nature as they form cell walls",
    ". an essential element of a biomembrane is a lipid bilayer , which is composed of lipid molecules .",
    "these molecules have a hydrophilic head and a hydrophobic tail .",
    "due to these properties , when a large number of lipid molecules are placed in a solution they self assemble , under suitable conditions , into two - dimensional structures consisting of two leaflets ( or monolayers ) .",
    "the lipid molecules are oriented so that the tails of the molecules in each leaflet are in contact with each other , while the heads are in contact with the ambient solution ; see , for example , lasic ( 1988 ) .",
    "these two - dimensional structures often close to form vesicles and are usually between 50 nanometers and tens of micrometers in diameter but only a few nanometers thick , as observed by luisi & walade ( 2000 ) . due to these dimensions ,",
    "lipid bilayers are usually modeled as surfaces .",
    "there is a long history of work dealing with specifying a free - energy density for a surface representing a lipid bilayer . over forty years ago , canham ( 1970 ) , in an effort to explain the biconcave shape of red blood cells , proposed a bending - energy density dependent on the square of the mean curvature",
    "a few years later , helfrich ( 1973 ) also considered an elastic - energy density depending on the curvature of the surface associated with a lipid bilayer . in the canham ",
    "helfrich theory , the free - energy density @xmath0 of the lipid bilayer is of the form [ chenergy ] = ( h - h_)^2+|k , where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the mean and gaussian curvatures , @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the bending moduli , and @xmath5 is the spontaneous mean - curvature . the curvatures @xmath1 and @xmath2 are scalar invariants that describe the shape of the lipid bilayer .",
    "( see appendix [ appsurf ] for the definitions of @xmath1 and @xmath2 . )",
    "the splay modulus @xmath3 , which is always positive , characterizes the resistance to changes in mean curvature , while the saddle - splay modulus @xmath4 is related to the resistance to changes in gaussian curvature .",
    "the spontaneous mean - curvature @xmath5 is determined by the preferred , natural , local shape of the lipid bilayer .",
    "although canham ( 1970 ) and helfrich ( 1973 ) were the first to use a free - energy density of the form for biomembranes , such expressions were considered by poisson ( 1812 ) , in the @xmath6 case , germain ( 1821 ) , and the cosserat brothers ( 1909 ) in the study of elastic surfaces .",
    "although not present in the canham ",
    "helfrich theory , it is also possible to introduce a spontaneous gaussian - curvature @xmath7 , as do maleki et al .",
    "( 2012 ) , in which case the last term on the right - hand side of is replaced by @xmath8 .",
    "if @xmath4 and @xmath7 are both constant , the spontaneous gaussian - curvature can be neglected since the free - energy density is only determined up to an additive constant .    as mentioned above , the spontaneous curvatures @xmath5 and @xmath7 are determined by the preferred , natural , local shape of the lipid bilayer . as seifert ( 1997 )",
    "notes , one of the main causes for spontaneous curvature is asymmetry between the two leaflets making up the bilayer . the asymmetry can manifest itself in different ways . for example , dbereiner et al ( 1999 ) observe that spontaneous curvature may arise from differences in the chemical properties of the aqueous solution on the two sides of the lipid bilayer , while mcmahon & gallop ( 1998 ) explain that lipid molecules with different configurations may also lead to nonzero @xmath5 and @xmath7 .",
    "several derivations of the canham  helfrich free - energy density have appeared in the literature .",
    "for example , in a work concerned with lipid monolayers , safran ( 1994 ) derived by modeling the lipid molecules in a monolayer as springs . in safran s",
    "( 1994 ) derivation , the springs are allowed to change length with the bending of the bilayer but may not interact with one another .",
    "granted that the lipid monolayer is incompressible , safran ( 1994 ) expressed the length of a generic molecule in terms of the underlying mean and gaussian curvatures . upon making the additional assumption that the product of the spontaneous curvature with the natural length of the molecules is small , he found that the energy governing each spring takes a form consistent with .",
    "paunov et al .",
    "( 2000 ) also used statistical methods to derive an energy for a lipid monolayer .",
    "their expression for the energy consists of two terms : one associated with bending , which is taken from the work of safran ( 1994 ) , and the other associated with mixing .",
    "the mixing term accounts for interactions between the monolayer and the ambient solution . for the particular cases of",
    "spherical and cylindrical monolayers , paunov et al .",
    "( 2000 ) found that , when expanded up to include only terms up to the square of the inverse radius of curvature , their expression for the energy of a monolayer agrees with .",
    "following ljunggren & eriksson ( 1995 ) , who took the view that the bending energy of a bilayer is due to electrical forces , using the debye ",
    "huckel approximation , winterhalter & helfrich ( 1988 ) obtained expressions for the bending energy of planar , cylindrical , and spherical lipid bilayers . as with the derivation of paunov et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , winterhalter & helfrich ( 1988 ) considered only terms up to the square of the inverse radius of curvature and , in so doing , obtained expressions for the bending moduli and spontaneous curvature .    a derivation for the bending energy of a bilayer was also provided by seifert ( 1997 ) , who models the bilayer as a surface with molecules populating both sides , the molecular density being different on the sides . disregarding the structure of these molecules , seifert ( 1997 ) assumes that the energy of the bilayer is determined by the extent to which these densities deviate from an equilibrium density .",
    "the densities are defined on the midsurface of each monolayer . to obtain an energy density defined on the surface ,",
    "the two molecular densities are projected onto the surface .",
    "since these projections depend on the curvature of the surface , the energy density of the surface inherits dependance on the curvature . by assuming that the curvature of the surface is small , seifert ( 1997 ) finds an energy density for the surface of the canham  helfrich variety with no spontaneous curvature .",
    "in the present paper , we follow an approach used by keller & merchant ( 1991 ) to derive the energy of a liquid surface . to obtain their result ,",
    "keller & merchant ( 1991 ) expanded the energy of a mass of liquid in powers of the range @xmath9 of the intermolecular potential . beyond the first term of this expansion , which is volumetric , the second and third terms of this expansion are areal .",
    "of the areal contributions to the energy , the first is due to surface tension and is proportional to the area of the underlying surface , and the second is proportional to the integral over the surface of @xmath10 and , thus , to the bending - energy density arising in the plate theory of fppl  ( 1907 ) and von krmn  ( 1910 ) with poisson s ratio equal to @xmath11 .    in our derivation of the free - energy density of a lipid bilayer",
    ", we neglect interactions between the lipid molecules and the ambient solution and instead focus on interactions between the lipid molecules themselves .",
    "these molecules are modeled as rigid rods , as in the work of seguin & fried ( 2012 ) .",
    "the rods , representing the molecules , are distributed over the surface that represents the lipid bilayer . by assuming that the lipid molecules are oriented perpendicular to the surface and interact with each other only when they are within a distance of @xmath9 , we obtain an expression for the free - energy density for the bilayer . following the approach of keller & merchant ( 1991 )",
    ", we then expand the free - energy density in powers of @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is a characteristic length associated with the bilayer , and identify the canham  helfrich free - energy density as the coefficient of the term of order @xmath14 .",
    "this expansion rests on the assumption that the smallest possible curvature of the membrane is much larger than its thickness and , thus , our derivation does not hold for membranes that are undergoing crumpling , pitting , or budding .",
    "our derivation also neglects the effect of any molecular fluctuations .",
    "while these fluctuations are important in crumpling , budding , and pitting events , as described by lipowsky ( 1990 ) and sackmann ( 1994 ) , all of these events involve the membrane having large curvature and , thus , are not included in our theory .",
    "moreover , we view the canham  helfrich free - energy density as a mean - field description of a lipid bilayer . in classical mean - field theory ,",
    "fluctuations are neglected .",
    "this argument provides a direct and easy derivation of the canham  helfrich free - energy density .",
    "it also affords several observations .",
    "for one , if the lipid bilayer is symmetric , which occurs when its leaflets are of identical composition , and the lipid molecules are uniformly distributed , then the spontaneous curvatures @xmath5 and @xmath7 must vanish .",
    "moreover , since our derivation gives concrete expressions for the bending moduli , those expressions might be used to gain insight regarding the sign of the saddle - splay modulus @xmath4 .",
    "our paper is outlined as follows . in section  [ sectmain ] , we describe our approach to modeling lipid molecules , write down a free - energy density for a lipid bilayer , and state the result of expanding this energy in powers of @xmath15 .",
    "the details of this expansion can be found in the appendices .",
    "this is followed , in section  [ sectint ] , with a discussion of the resulting expansion and some consideration of special cases . in section  [ sectfd ] ,",
    "we discuss possible extensions of the method used in section  [ sectmain ] , including some possible approaches to weakening the assumptions made there .",
    "finally , in section  [ sectsum ] , we summarize our primary results and make some concluding remarks .",
    "in this section , guided by the work of keller & merchant ( 1991 ) , we derive an expression for the free - energy density of a single closed ( lipid ) bilayer suspended in solution .",
    "our result is based on the following assumptions :    * the thickness of the bilayer is small relative to its average diameter . *",
    "the ( lipid ) molecules can be modeled as one - dimensional rigid rods .",
    "* the molecules do not tilt relative to the orientation of the bilayer .",
    "* interactions between the bilayer and the solution are negligible .    on the basis of assumption ( i ) , which is commonly imposed in models for closed bilayers ( luisi & walade ( 2000 ) )",
    ", we identify both leaflets of the bilayer with a single orientable surface @xmath16 .",
    "this surface can adopt a large variety of shapes ; however , being made up of molecules of a finite size , it can not support arbitrarily large curvatures .",
    "let @xmath13 denote the smallest stable radius of curvature that @xmath16 is capable of exhibiting . for each leaflet @xmath17 of the bilayer",
    ", we introduce a molecular number density @xmath18 defined on @xmath16 and measured per unit area of @xmath16 . the total number of molecules in leaflet @xmath17 is then given by the integral _ w_i(y)a_y , where @xmath19 denotes the area element on @xmath16 .",
    "taking @xmath18 to be defined on @xmath16 amounts to assuming that the centers of the lipid molecules of both leaflets lie on @xmath16 , which is consistent with assuming that the bilayer is thin relative to its average diameter .",
    "in general , the number densities of the leaflets may differ .    on the basis of assumption ( ii )",
    ", the configuration of each such molecule may be described by a point on @xmath16 and a unit - vector - valued director ( seguin & fried ( 2012 ) ) , with the point representing the center of the rod and the director representing the orientation of the rod . without loss of generality",
    ", we suppose that the director tips point toward the headgroups of the molecules .",
    "we also assume that the interaction between a pair of molecules is governed by a potential that depends on the vector between the points and the directors and is restricted such that only molecules separated by distances less than some fixed cut - off distance @xmath9 may interact .",
    "we assume that the cut - off distance @xmath9 is small relative to the smallest radius of curvature @xmath13 the bilayer can support , so that @xmath20 or , equivalently , [ small ] : = 1 .    given molecules located at two points @xmath21 and @xmath22 on @xmath16 and corresponding directors @xmath23 and @xmath24 , we consider interaction potentials , with dimensions of energy , of the generic form ^(x - y,(x),(y ) ) = ( ^-2|x - y^2,(x - y)(x),(x - y)(y),(x)(y ) ) , [ psigeneric ] where , to ensure that rods separated by a distance greater than @xmath9 may not interact , @xmath25 must satisfy [ ieradius ] ( s , a , b , c)=0 notice that @xmath26 depends on @xmath27 , while @xmath25 does not . that @xmath28 must depend on the vectors @xmath29 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 only through the scalars @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33",
    "is shown by seguin & fried ( 2012 ) .",
    "this is also a consequence of the requirement that the potential be frame - indifferent .",
    "notice that the interaction energy @xmath34 between two molecules can change if the head and tail of one of the molecules flips .",
    "interaction potentials of this form may therefore account for differences between the polarities of the heads and tails of the molecules . in taking @xmath28 to depend on the cutoff distance @xmath9 as shown in ,",
    "we follow keller & merchant ( 1991 ) . in addition to a potential @xmath35 that accounts for interactions between molecules in each leaflet @xmath17",
    ", we introduce a potential @xmath36 that accounts for interactions between molecules belonging to different leaflets .",
    "although the specific forms of these potentials may differ , they share the same general properties to the extent that they satisfy and",
    ". a graph of a particular @xmath25 for fixed @xmath37 , and @xmath38 is given in figure [ fig0 ] .",
    "this function is based on the lennard - jones 6 - 12 potential .",
    "more tangible examples of interaction potentials are provided by yuan ( 2010 ) .     for fixed @xmath37 , and @xmath38.,title=\"fig:\",width=240 ] ( 5,32)@xmath39 ( -91,20)@xmath13 ( -190,32)@xmath40 ( -190,130)@xmath25    without loss of generality , we choose to orient @xmath16 with the unit - normal field that points into the fluid adjacent to the head groups of leaflet 1 and denote that field by @xmath41 . on the basis of assumption ( iii )",
    ", it then follows that the directors of molecules in leaflets @xmath42 and @xmath43 coincide with @xmath41 and @xmath44 , respectively .",

    "the two number densities are needed to account for the number of molecules at @xmath21 and the number of molecules at @xmath22 .",

    "finally , on the basis of assumption ( iv ) , the free - energy density of the bilayer at @xmath21 is determined completely by the sum of the four contributions defined in  and thus has the form [ energydecomp ] ( x)=_11(x)+_22(x)+_12(x)+_21(x ) .    on substituting  into the right - hand side of , the goal is to expand @xmath49 in powers of @xmath50 up to order @xmath14 , following keller & merchant ( 1991 ) , with the objective of capturing the dependence on the curvature .",

    "the quantities @xmath53 , and @xmath7 depend on the point @xmath21 in @xmath16 .",
    "thus , @xmath0 may depends on @xmath21 through not only the mean and gaussian curvatures but also through the splay and saddle - splay moduli and the spontaneous mean and gaussian curvatures .",
    "the result deserves some interpretation .",
    "the first term on the right - hand side of only depends on the interaction potentials and number densities at @xmath21 .",
    "this term remains in the limit as @xmath9 ( or , equivalently , @xmath50 ) approaches zero .",
    "the remainder of is the canham  helfrich free - energy density , augmented by a spontaneous gaussian - curvature term .",
    "hence , provides a microphysical derivation of the canham  helfrich free - energy density for a lipid bilayer .",
    "moreover , the abbreviations  describe how the spontaneous curvatures @xmath5 and @xmath7 and the bending moduli @xmath3 and @xmath4 depend on the interaction energies between the lipid molecules and the densities of the molecules in the two leaflets .",
    "the term @xmath54 is independent of the shape of the membrane and not part of the canham  helfrich free - energy density .",
    "however , due to implicit dependence of the number densities on temperature , concentration , and relevant electromagnetic fields , that term encompasses effects associated with ambient temperature , concentration , and relevant electromagnetic conditions .    since the number densities @xmath55 and @xmath56 need not be constant , the spontaneous curvatures @xmath5 and @xmath7 and the bending moduli @xmath3 and @xmath4 generally vary with position @xmath21 on the bilayer . since the free - energy density can be determined only up to an arbitrary constant , if it happens that both @xmath4 and @xmath7 are constant , then the the term @xmath57 can be dropped without loss of generality",
    "otherwise , the presence of the spontaneous gaussian - curvature @xmath7 can not be neglected .    to obtain some additional insight regarding the spontaneous curvatures and the bending moduli ,",
    "suppose that the two leaflets are identical , so that there is no leaflet asymmetry .",
    "this means that @xmath58 and @xmath59 . from and",
    ", we see that in this case @xmath60 and , hence , that there is no spontaneous mean - curvature . moreover , if the lipid molecules are evenly distributed on each leaflet so that the number densities @xmath55 and @xmath56 are constant , then @xmath61 and , hence , by , the spontaneous gaussian - curvature @xmath7 also vanishes .",
    "these results are in agreement with what other researchers have proposed regarding spontaneous curvature .",
    "specifically , seifert ( 1997 ) proposes that spontaneous curvature is a measure of the asymmetry of the two leaflets .",
    "mcmahon & gallop ( 1998 ) suggest that spontaneous curvature is a result of the leaflets having different molecular compositions . in the framework presented here",
    ", possible differences in the compositions of the leaflets are encompassed by allowing @xmath62 and @xmath63 to differ .",
    "ideally , it should be possible to obtain an interaction energy for a given type of lipid molecule and use  to explicitly calculate the spontaneous curvatures and bending moduli for a bilayer consisting of these lipid molecules .",
    "for example , consider an interaction potential of the form _",
    "ij(s , a , b , c):=p_ij(s)(c^2 - 1 ) , [ msresult ] which is taken from the maer  saupe ( 1958 ) theory of liquid - crystals .",
    "here , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , are functions of the square of the normalized distance @xmath66 between the lipid molecules . in this case",
    ", it is easily confirmed that @xmath67 and , hence , by and , @xmath6 .",
    "thus , when applied to lipid molecules , the maer  saupe ( 1958 ) interaction potential leads to zero spontaneous mean - curvature . without some concrete information about the functions",
    "@xmath64 it is not possible to say anything about the characteristic features of the moduli @xmath3 and @xmath4 and , thus , in particular , about the sign of @xmath4 .",
    "consider next the simple generalization @xmath68 \\text{if $ s\\ge \\ell$ for all $ ( s , a , b , c)\\in\\real\\times\\real\\times\\real\\times[-1,1]$ } \\label{msresult2}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] of , in which @xmath69 and @xmath70 are constants that influence the relative orientations of molecules .",
    "if @xmath71 , then pairs of molecules prefer to adopt orientations in which their directors are perpendicular to the line through their centers .",
    "if @xmath69 and/or @xmath70 is not zero , then pairs of molecules prefer to adopt orientations that are not perpendicular to the line through their centers . for interaction energies of the form , and yield h_:=_0^r^3r , + which shows that the spontaneous mean - curvature @xmath5 generally differs from zero when @xmath72 for @xmath73 or @xmath74 .",
    "for another more complicated proposed interaction energy see the work of yuan ( 2010 ) .",
    "there are numerous ways in which the results of the previous two sections might be generalized .",
    "these are mainly related to the weakening of the assumptions made in section [ sectmain ] .",
    "namely , we will consider possible ways to weaken assumptions ( ii ) and ( iii ) .",
    "let us begin with assumption ( iii ) , which concerns the orientation of the lipid molecules .",
    "although helfrich ( 1973 ) argues that any energetic contribution due to molecular tilt should be negligible and the lipid molecules making up a lipid bilayer are almost ubiquitously depicted as being perpendicular to the surface formed by the bilayer ( see , for example , mcmahon & gallop ( 2005 ) ) , there is no reason to rule out the possibility that molecules may tilt relative to the surface normal .",
    "moreover , any such tilt need not be small . for simplicity , consider only leaflet @xmath42 and , for brevity , drop the subscript @xmath42 .",
    "analogous statements apply to leaflet @xmath43 .",
    "a possible approach to modeling a lipid monolayer made up of tilted molecules is to assume that the orientations of those molecules on the surface to be given by a vector field @xmath75 , so that @xmath76 gives the orientation of the molecules at the point @xmath21 on the surface representing the monolayer .",
    "this vector field should satisfy [ conditions ] |=1>1 .",
    "while the first condition in constrains the lipid molecules to be of fixed length , the second condition ensures that the lipid molecules point roughly in the same direction as @xmath41 .",
    "if @xmath77 did not hold , then either the lipid molecules lie flat on the surface ( @xmath78 ) , which seems physically unrealistic , or the tail of the lipid molecules are in contact with the adjacent solution ( @xmath79 ) , which , due to the chemical properties of the lipid molecules , is physically unattainable . recall that while the tail of a lipid molecule is hydrophobic , the head is hydrophilic .",
    "the orientation @xmath75 should take the place of @xmath41 in expressions such as .",
    "it is possible to find a second - order tensor field @xmath80 such that [ kcond1 ] = .",
    "in essence , the tensor @xmath80 describes the rotation of @xmath41 into @xmath75 .",
    "notice that the condition is not sufficient to uniquely determine @xmath80 , however , if the natural condition ( y)=t_y ,  yis also imposed , where @xmath81 is the tangent space to @xmath16 at @xmath22 , then @xmath80 is uniquely determined . with the substitution , an argument analogous to that employed in section [ sectmain ] should go through .",
    "in particular , we conjecture that an expression for the free - energy density with the same form as should emerge but that the corresponding counterparts of the abbreviations  will involve @xmath80 and its surface gradient at @xmath21 .    to also weaken assumption ( ii ) , namely the assumption that the lipid molecules are inextensible , two steps are necessary .",
    "first , the condition @xmath82 must be removed .",
    "second , the potential governing the interaction between the molecules in must be replaced by ^(x - y,(x),(y))= ( ^-2|x - y^2,(x - y)(x),(x - y)(x),(x)(x),|(x)^2,|(y)^2 ) .",
    "[ intpoten ] once again , an analysis similar to that appearing in section [ sectmain ] should be feasible and we believe a result similar to might emerge from such an analysis",
    ".    it should also be feasible to relax assumption ( iv ) by adding to the right - hand side of a term that accounts for interactions between the lipid bilayer and the ambient solution .",
    "in pursuing such a generalization , it might make sense to follow the lead of paunov et al .",
    "( 2000 ) .",
    "steigmann ( 1999 ) developed a general theory of lipid bilayers , regarded as fluid surfaces with bending elasticity . aside from accommodating a completely general dependence of the free - energy density on the mean and gaussian curvatures , steigmann s ( 1999 ) theory accounts for the areal stretch of the lipid bilayer relative to some reference placement .",
    "it would be interesting to see if it would be possible to use an argument like that contained in section [ sectmain ] to obtain a free - energy density that incorporates dependence on the areal stretch . to achieve this",
    ", it would perhaps be necessary to introduce a reference placement for the lipid molecules and then to account for interactions relative to that reference placement .",
    "along with the other ideas mentioned in this section , we leave the details of any such analysis to a subsequent work .",
    "in section [ sectmain ] we presented a microphysical derivation for the canham ",
    "helfrich form of the free - energy density of a lipid bilayer that includes not only spontaneous mean - curvature but also spontaneous gaussian - curvature . our approach was inspired by the work of keller & merchant ( 1991 ) .",
    "the resulting expressions for the spontaneous curvatures allowed us to remark in section [ sectint ] that if the two leaflets are identical and the lipid molecules are evenly distributed across the surface of the bilayer , then the natural shape of that surface is flat .",
    "moreover , in section [ sectfd ] , we observed that it should be feasible to extend our method to allow for molecular tilt , molecular extension , interactions between the bilayer and the adjacent solution , and areal stretch .",
    "in these appendices we present the necessary linear algebra and differential geometry necessary to carry out the expansions needed in section [ sectmain ] .",
    "we also include some details of the expansion .",
    "here we recall some basic properties of tensors .",
    "let @xmath83 be a finite - dimensional vector space equipped with an inner - product .",
    "for the purposes of this work , a tensor @xmath84 of order @xmath85 is a multilinear mapping that takes in @xmath85 vectors and gives a real number .",

    "a linear mapping from @xmath83 to itself can be viewed as a second - order tensor and vice versa ; we denote the set of all such linear mappings by @xmath86 .",
    "other such statements regarding higher - order tensors can also be made .",
