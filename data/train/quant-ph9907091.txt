    "in 1935 einstein , podolsky and rosen @xcite proved the incompatibility among three hypotheses : 1 ) quantum mechanics is correct ; 2 ) quantum mechanics is complete ; 3 ) the following criterion of local reality holds : `` if , without in any way disturbing a system , we can predict with certainty [ ... ] the value of a physical quantity , then there exists an element of physical reality corresponding to this quantity . ''",
    "the paper opened a long and as yet unsettled debate about which one of the three hypotheses should be discarded . while einstein suggested to abandon the completeness of quantum mechanics , bohr @xcite refused the criterion of reality .",
    "the most important step forward in this debate was bell s theorem of 1965 @xcite , which proved that there is an intrinsic incompatibility between the assumptions 1 ) and 3 ) , namely the correctness of quantum mechanics and einstein s `` criterion of reality '' . in bell",
    "s approach , a source produces a pair of correlated particles , which travel along opposite directions and impinge into two detectors .",
    "the two detectors measure two dichotomic observables @xmath0 and @xmath1 respectively , @xmath2 and @xmath3 denoting experimental parameters which can be varied over different trials , typically the polarization / spin angle of detection at each apparatus . assuming that each measurement outcome is determined by the experimental parameters @xmath2 and @xmath3 and by an `` element of reality '' or `` hidden variable '' @xmath4",
    ", bell proved an inequality which holds for any theory that satisfies einstein s `` criterion of reality '' , while it is violated by quantum mechanics .",
    "such a fundamental inequality , which allows an experimental discrimination between local hidden ",
    "variable theories and quantum mechanics , has been the focus of interest in a number of experimental works @xcite .    unfortunately , bell s proof is based on two conditions which are difficult to achieve experimentally .",
    "the first is the feasibility of an experimental configuration yielding perfect correlation ; the second is the possibility of approaching an ideal measurement , which itself does not add randomness to the outcome . since 1969 , attention was focused on improving the correlation of the source on one hand , and , on the other , on deriving more general inequalities that take into account detection quantum efficiency or circumvent the problem , however , at the cost of introducing supplementary hypotheses ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) , as the well known `` fair sampling '' assumption .",
    "anyhow it was clear also to the authors of the same refs .",
    "@xcite that these assumptions are questionable , and , as a matter of fact , it was proved @xcite that in all performed experimental checks the results can be reproduced in the context of einstein s assumptions if quantum efficiency of detectors is less than @xmath5 .",
    "however , no experiment has yet succeeded in realizing such a high value of quantum efficiency .    in a typical experiment",
    "the source emits a pair of correlated photons and two detectors separately check the presence of the two photons after polarizing filters at angles @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively .",
    "alternatively , one can use four photodetectors with polarizing beam splitters in front , with the advantage of checking through coincidence counts that photons come in pairs .",
    "let us denote by @xmath8 the joint probability of finding one photon at each detector with polarization angle @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively . in terms of the correlation function",
    "@xmath9 bell s inequality @xcite writes as follows @xmath10 @xmath11 and @xmath12 being the polarization angles orthogonal to @xmath2 and @xmath3 respectively . in this letter",
    "we propose a new kind of test for bell s inequality based on homodyne tomography @xcite ( for a review see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in our set - up the photodetectors",
    "are replaced by homodyne detectors , which along with the tomographic technique can be regarded as a black box for measuring the joint probabilities @xmath8 .",
    "the main advantage of the tomographic test is that it allows using linear photodiodes with quantum efficiency @xmath13 higher than @xmath14 @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the method works effectively even with @xmath13 as low as @xmath15 , without the need of a `` fair sampling '' assumption , since all data are collected in a single experimental run . with respect to the customary homodyne technique , which in the present case would need many beam splitters and local oscillators ( lo ) that are coherent each other , the set - up",
    "is greatly simplified by using the recent self - homodyne technique @xcite .",
    "another advantage of self - homodyning is the more efficient signal - lo mode - matching , with improved overall quantum efficiency .",
    "the apparatus for generating the correlated beams is a @xmath16 nonlinear crystal , cut for type - ii phase  matching , acting as a nondegenerate optical parametric amplifier ( nopa ) .",
    "the nopa is injected with excited coherent states ( see fig .",

    "separately measure the intensities @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 of the mutual orthogonal polarization components of the fields propagating at different wave vectors .",
    "a narrow band of the photocurrent is selected , centered around frequency @xmath28 ( typically @xmath18 is optical / infrared , whereas @xmath29 is a radio frequency ) . in the process of direct detection , the central modes @xmath30 and @xmath31 beat with @xmath32 sidebands , thus playing the role of the lo of homodyne detectors .",
    "the four photocurrents @xmath24 , @xmath33 , @xmath26 , @xmath34 yield the value of the quadratures of the four modes @xcite @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 denote the sideband modes at frequency @xmath38 , which are in the vacuum state at the input of the nopa .",
    "the quadrature is defined by the operator @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the relative phase between the signal and the lo .",
    "the value of the quadratures is used as input data for the tomographic measurement of the correlation function @xmath41 .",
    "the direction of polarizers @xmath42 in the experimental set - up does not need to be varied over different trials , because , as we will show in the following , such direction can be changed tomographically",

    "notice that conventional experiments , concerning a two - photon polarization - entangled state generated by spontaneous down - conversion , consider a four - mode entangled state which corresponds to keeping only the first - order terms of the sums in eq .",
    "( [ psi ] ) , and to ignoring the vacuum component , as only intensity correlations are usually measured . here , on the contrary , we measure the joint probabilities on the state ( [ psi ] ) to test bell s inequality through homodyne tomography , which yields the value of @xmath62 in eq .",

    "the tomographic technique is a kind of universal detector , which can measure any observable @xmath63 of the field , by averaging a suitable `` pattern '' function @xmath64(x,\\phi ) $ ] over homodyne data @xmath65 at random phase @xmath66 .",
