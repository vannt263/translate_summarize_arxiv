    "consider the following rabinovich system @xmath0 this system was suggested in 1978 by m. rabinovich@xcite to describe the interaction of three resonantly coupled waves two of them being parametrically excited . here",
    "the parameter @xmath1 is proportional to the pumping amplitude and the parameters @xmath2 and @xmath3 are normalized dumping decrements .",
    "after the linear transformation ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) : @xmath4 one obtains the generalized lorenz system @xmath5 where @xmath6    system with @xmath7 coincides with the classical lorenz system @xcite . as it is discussed in @xcite , system can also be used to describe the following physical processes : the convective fluid motion inside rotating ellipsoid @xcite , the rotation of rigid body in viscous fluid @xcite , the gyrostat dynamics @xcite , the convection of horizontal layer of fluid making harmonic oscillations @xcite , and the model of kolmogorov s flow @xcite .    note that since parameters @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath1 are positive then parameters @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 are positive and parameter @xmath11 is negative . also , due to one",
    "can obtain the following relation between @xmath8 , @xmath11 and @xmath10 : @xmath12    hereinafter system will be studied under the assumption . in this case if @xmath13 , then has a unique equilibrium @xmath14 , which is globally asymptotically lyapunov stable @xcite .",
    "if @xmath15 , then system has three equilibria : @xmath14 and @xmath16 here @xmath17 and the number @xmath18 is as follows @xmath19.\\ ] ] the stability of equilibria @xmath20 of system depends on the parameters @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath9 . using the routh - hurwitz criterion we can obtain the following    [ prop : stability ] if under conditions on parameters of system   also one of the following conditions    1 .",
    "@xmath21 , [ cond : stability:1 ] 2 .",
    "@xmath22 , @xmath23 [ cond : stability:2 ]    holds , then the equilibria @xmath20 of system are stable",
    ".    the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial @xmath24 of the jacobian matrix of system at the point @xmath25 have the following forms @xmath26 one can check that inequalities @xmath27 and @xmath28 are always valid . if @xmath29 , then @xmath30 holds , and @xmath31 if @xmath32 which corresponds to condition [ cond : stability:1 ] .",
    "if @xmath22 , then @xmath31 holds and @xmath30 if @xmath33 which corresponds to condition [ cond : stability:2 ] .    note that system is dissipative in the sense that it possesses a bounded convex absorbing set @xcite , @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is a lyapunov function , @xmath36 is an arbitrary positive number such that @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "thus , system possesses a global attractor @xcite .    for system with fixed parameters @xmath39 , @xmath40 and increasing @xmath1",
    "it is possible to observe  @xcite the classical scenario of transition to chaos ( via homoclinic and andronov - hopf subcritical bifurcations ) similar to the scenario in the lorenz system . for @xmath41 in system",
    "there is a self - excited chaotic attractor ( see e.g. fig .",
    "[ fig : rabinovich : attr : se ] ) which coexist with two stable equilibria .",
    "the same scenario can be obtained for system when parameters @xmath42 and @xmath43 are fixed and @xmath10 is increasing .",
    "let us note that in @xcite system with @xmath44 was studied and it was shown numerically the existence of the hidden attractor . in this report",
    "we localize a hidden chaotic attractor in system with @xmath43 .",
    "remark that because of computational errors and multistability the sustained chaos situated very close to the unstable zero equilibrium is numerically indistinguishable from the transient chaos , which may persist for many cycles and then begin to damp down to one of the two stable equilibria ( see corresponding discussion on the lorenz system in @xcite ) .",
    "thus our aim is to change the parameters considered in @xcite in such a way that hidden attractor will be located not close to the unstable zero equilibrium .",
    "multistability in the rabinovich system with and the classical values of parameters @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath45 from @xcite : coexistence of three local attractors  two stable equilibria @xmath20 and a self - excited attractor ( self - excited with respect to the equilibrium @xmath46).,scaledwidth=50.0% ]",
    "attractor in dynamical system can be easily localized numerically if the initial conditions from its open neighborhood lead to the long - time behavior that approaches the attractor .",
    "thus , from a computational point of view , it is natural to suggest the following classification of attractors , based on the simplicity of finding the basin of attraction in the phase space :    @xcite an attractor is called a _ self - excited attractor _ if its basin of attraction intersects with any open neighborhood of a stationary state ( an equilibrium ) , otherwise it is called a _ hidden attractor_.    for a _ self - excited attractor _ its basin of attraction is connected with an unstable equilibrium and , therefore , self - excited attractors can be localized numerically by the _",
    "standard computational procedure _ in which after a transient process a trajectory , started in a neighborhood of an unstable equilibrium ( from a point of its unstable manifold ) , is attracted to the state of oscillation and traces it",
    ". thus self - excited attractors can be easily visualized .    for a hidden attractor its basin of attraction",
    "is not connected with equilibria .",
    "hidden attractors , for example , are the attractors in the systems with no equilibria or with only one stable equilibrium ( a special case of multistability  multistable systems and coexistence of attractors ) .",
    "one of the first well - known problems of analyzing hidden periodic oscillations arose in connection with the second part of hilbert s 16th problem ( 1900 ) @xcite on the number and mutual disposition of limit cycles in two - dimensional polynomial systems ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "later the study of hidden attractors arose in connection with various fundamental problems and applied models ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "recent examples of hidden periodic oscillations and hidden chaotic attractors can be found in @xcite .",
    "note that while coexisting self - excited attractors can be found by the standard computational procedure , there is no regular way to predict the existence or coexistence of hidden attractors .",
    "one of the effective methods for numerical localization of hidden attractors in multidimensional dynamical systems is based on a _ homotopy _ and _ numerical continuation method ( ncm ) _ : it is necessary to construct a sequence of similar systems such that for the first ( starting ) system the initial point for numerical computation of oscillating solution ( starting oscillation ) can be obtained analytically , e.g , it is often possible to consider the starting system with self - excited starting oscillation . then the transformation of this starting oscillation is tracked numerically in passing from one system to another .",
    "the last system corresponds to the system in which hidden attractor is searched .    in a scenario of transition to chaos in dynamical system defined by the ode @xmath47",
    "there is often a parameter @xmath48 ( or a set of parameters ) , the variation of which determines the scenario .",
    "let parameter @xmath49 varies in the interval @xmath50 $ ] , where @xmath51 corresponds to the system , where a hidden attractor is searched .",
    "choose parameter @xmath52 such that we can analytically or numerically localize a certain nontrivial attractor @xmath53 in system with @xmath54 .",
    "e.g. one can consider an initial self - excited attractor defined by a trajectory @xmath55 numerically integrated on a sufficiently large time interval @xmath56 $ ] with initial point @xmath57 in the vicinity of an unstable equilibrium .",
    "analytical approaches of defining initial attractors are described e.g. in @xcite .",
    "introduce the sequence of parameters @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 $ ] such that the distance between @xmath61 and @xmath62 is sufficiently small . on each further step @xmath63 of the procedure",
    "the initial point @xmath64 for a trajectory to be integrated is chosen as follows : @xmath65 . following this procedure and sequentially increasing @xmath63 , two alternatives are possible . the first case : the points of @xmath66 are in the basin of attraction of attractor @xmath67 . the second case : while passing from system with @xmath68 to system with @xmath69 it is observed a loss of stability bifurcation and attractor @xmath66 vanishes .",
    "if while changing @xmath49 from @xmath52 to @xmath70 there happens no loss of the stability bifurcation of the considered attractors , then the hidden attractor for @xmath59 ( at the end of procedure ) is localized .",
    "the fixed points of a dynamical system are the ones where velocity and acceleration of the system simultaneously become zero .",
    "if the existing fixed points are unstable then we may get either oscillating solutions or unbounded ones .",
    "if there are oscillating solutions then the fixed points are considered to be important points in phase space for locating the oscillating attractors , i.e. these unstable fixed points are considered as reference points and the initial conditions near to the fixed points lead to the attractors . however , for the systems having hidden attractors we do not have such unstable fixed points .",
    "therefore a natural question can be asked as `` is there a reference point for hidden attractors similar to the fixed point for self - excited attractors ? '' . in this section",
    "we show numerical results which suggest that there are points , termed as perpetual points , which could be considered as reference points of hidden attractors .    for a dynamical system specified by ode",
    "the fixed point @xmath71 corresponds to where @xmath72 .",
    "let us consider the derivative of eq .",
    "with respect to time , i.e. @xmath73 where @xmath74_{i , j=1}^n$ ] is the @xmath75 jacobian matrix . here @xmath76 may be termed as the acceleration vector .",
    ". shows the variation of acceleration in phase space .",
    "similar to the fixed points estimation where we set velocity vector zero , we can also get a set of points where @xmath77 in , i.e. the points corresponding to the zero acceleration . at these points velocity @xmath78",
    "may be either zero or nonzero .",
    "this set includes the fixed points @xmath71 with zero velocity as well as a subset of new points with nonzero velocity .",
    "these nonzero velocity points are termed as _ perpetual points _",
    ", @xmath79 @xcite .",
    "the velocity at these points is either maximum or minimum or of inflection behavior @xcite .",
    "it has been also observed that these points are important for better understanding of transient dynamics in the phase space .",
    "these points also show the bifurcation behavior , similar to the fixed points , as the parameters of the system vary , for details see @xcite .",
    "often the understanding of hidden attractor origins , as compared to the self - excited one , is difficult due to the absence of the fixed points . to locate the hidden attractors in a given system is even more difficult problem .",
    "however , the perpetual points could be used to locate the hidden oscillating attractors , rare attractors as well as coexisting attractors @xcite , in both single and coupled oscillators @xcite .",
    "the reason why perpetual points lead to hidden states is still not well understood and more analyses have to be made in this area .    here",
    "we denote the detection and study of perpetual points as _ perpetual point method ( ppm)_. for some systems perpetual points can be computed analytically but in general case due to the complexity of the equations it is possible to obtain perpetual points only numerically .    for the rabinovich system",
    "one can obtain the following    [ lemma : perpetual ] perpetual points @xmath80 of system can be derived from the following system @xmath81",
    "in this section we apply the ncm for hidden attractor localization in the rabinovich system and check whether it can be also localized using ppm .      in this experiment",
    "we fix parameter @xmath10 and using condition [ cond : stability:2 ] of proposition  [ prop : stability ] define parameters @xmath82 and @xmath83 . for @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86",
    "we obtain @xmath87 , @xmath88 and define @xmath89 as initial point of the line segment on the plane @xmath90 .",
    "the eigenvalues of the jacobian matrix at the equilibria @xmath46 , @xmath91 of system   for these parameters are as follows : @xmath92    by increasing parameters @xmath11 , @xmath9 let us construct on the plane @xmath93 a line segment , intersecting a boundary of stability domain of the equilibria @xmath20 with the final point @xmath94 , where @xmath95 , @xmath96 i.e. equilibrium @xmath46 remains saddle and equilibria @xmath91 become stable focus - nodes @xmath97     @xmath98 @xmath89 : self - excited attractor , + @xmath98 @xmath94 : hidden attractor.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    initial point @xmath89 corresponds to the parameters for which in system there exists a self - excited attractor , such that it can be computed by the standard procedure .",
    "then for the considered line segment a sufficiently small partition step is chosen and a chaotic attractor in the phase space of system at each iteration step of the procedure is computed .",
    "the last computed point at each step is used as the initial point for the computation of the next step .    in this experiment using path @xmath99 $ ] we organize ncm with @xmath100 steps ( see fig .",
