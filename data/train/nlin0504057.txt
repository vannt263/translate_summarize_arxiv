    "it has been revealed that periodically firing interneurons exhibit in - phase synchronization during the gamma oscillations ( 20 - 80 hz ) and the sharp wave burst ( 100 - 200 hz)@xcite .",

    "therefore , a significant effort has been devoted to understand a role of inhibitory chemical synapses in in - phase synchronization in a large ensemble of neurons@xcite .",
    "one major analytical approach to investigate synchronization of neurons is the phase reduction method , in which behavior of periodically firing neurons are reduced to the simple phase dynamics@xcite .",

    "they have found the degeneracy of eigenvalues , which makes it easy to analyze synchronization of many if neurons .",
    "actually , such degenerate eigenvalues in stability analysis are found not only in if neurons but also in many synchronization phenomena induced by mean field interactions .",
    "a most prominent example of this degeneracy is seen in synchronization in an ensemble of chaotic oscillators such like lorenz equations and logistic maps@xcite . just using the general properties of mean field interactions we can decompose linear stability of synchronous state of chaotic oscillators to two different components , which define the so called tangential lyapunov exponents and transversal lyapunov exponents .",
    "it must be noted that the result of this decomposition clearly indicates the occurrence of degeneracy regarding transversal lyapunov exponents .",
    "synchronization in many chaotic oscillators is thus characterized by only a small number of exponents included in tangential and transversal lyapunov spectrum even if the system size is infinitely large .    in the present paper",
    "we employ these sophisticated reduction techniques in the chaos synchronization theory to investigate synchronization in the large number of neurons .",
    "the target of the analysis is cluster state , where an ensemble of neurons are subdivided into a few clusters , in each of which neurons exhibit perfect synchronization . to evaluate the degeneracy of eigenvalues we carry out the above - mentioned decomposition of a linear stability and define stability of mean state ( tangential floquet multipliers ) and stabilities of clusters ( transversal floquet multipliers ) .",
    "stability of mean state elucidates if cluster state is stable in the dynamics among clusters while stabilities of clusters clarify whether small perturbations in each cluster converge to vanish .",
    "we explicitly compute floquet matrices of these stabilities for arbitrary neuron dynamics .",
    "therefore , we can elucidate stability of cluster state for any types of neurons , even if the size of networks is infinitely large and neurons are connected through strong couplings .    to give a concrete example of the present stability analysis",
