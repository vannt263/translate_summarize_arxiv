    "as known , the human brain radiates , during its biological activity , several kinds of electric waves ( ew ) which are generally classified as the @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 waves @xcite ( see also the references in @xcite ) .",
    "these ew , which differ in their frequencies ( @xmath4 ) and amplitudes ( @xmath5 ) and are detected by electrodes attached to the scalp , are tracked to the human states @xcite such as relaxation ( related to the @xmath0 waves ) , alertness ( related to the @xmath1 waves ) and sleep which gives rise to the @xmath2 and @xmath3 waves .",
    "the source of these ew are the neurons in the cerebral cortex which are transactional cells which receive and transmit among them inputs and outputs in the form of ionic electric currents over short and long distances within the brain ( see chapter 1 in @xcite ) .",
    "these ionic electric currents are , of course , electric charges in motion which may be calculated through the known gauss law @xcite . that is , assuming the brain is surrounded by some hypothetical surface @xmath6 one may measure , using the mentioned electrodes , the electric field which crosses that surface so that he can calculate , using gauss law @xcite @xmath7 , the charge @xmath8 inside the brain which is related to the measured ew . the @xmath9 in the former gauss s law is the electric field vector and @xmath10 is the permittivity constant . but",
    "as known , any ion and any charge @xmath8 has a mass @xmath11 which actually carries it so that one may use the corresponding gauss s law for gravitation ( see p. 618 in @xcite ) @xmath12 to relate the mass @xmath11 to the gravitational field vector @xmath13 which is identified at the neighbourhood of the earth surface with the gravitational acceleration @xmath14 , i. e. , @xmath15 .",
    "the constant @xmath16 is the universal gravitational constant and the gravitational field vector at the earth surface @xmath17 is a specific case of the generalized gravitational waves ( gw ) which have tensorial properties @xcite .",
    "these gw are very much weak compared to the corresponding ew as may be seen by comparing ( in the mks system ) the constants which multiply the mass @xmath11 and charge @xmath8 in the former two gauss s laws , e.g , @xmath18 .",
    "one may , however , consider the real situation in which the mentioned gw s originate not from one human brain but from a large ensemble of them .",
    "thus , if these waves have the same wavelength and phase they may constructively interfere @xcite with each other to produce a resultant significant gw . it has been shown @xcite , comparing gravitational waves with the electromagnetic ones , that the former may also display constructive or destructive interference as well as holographic properties .",
    "we emphasize here before anything else that this work is not about consciousness , mind or thinking at all ( the way discussed , for example , by roger penrose in his books @xcite or in @xcite ) but use only the assumption that the mass , associated with the charge in the brain , should be involved with gravitational field as all masses do .",
    "but , in contrast to the electromagnetic waves , no gw of any kind and form were directly detected up to now , except through indirect methods @xcite , even with the large terrestrial interferometric ligo @xcite , virgo @xcite , geo @xcite and tama @xcite detectors .",
    "morover , in contrast to other physical waves ( for example , the electromagnetic waves ) , gw s do not propagate as three - dimensional ( 3d ) oscillations in the background of the stationary four - dimensional ( 4d ) spacetime but are themselves perturbations of this spacetime itself @xcite .",
    "that is , the geometry of spacetime curves and oscillates in consequence of the presence of the passing gw so that , in case it is strong enough , it may even impose its own geometry upon the traversed spacetime @xcite .",
    "thus , the gw is an inherent part of the involved 4d spacetime in the sense that its geometry is reflected in the related metric form @xmath19 .",
    "this is seen , for example , in the metric form of the cylindrical spacetime @xcite or in the linearized version of general relativity where one uses the flat minkowsky metric form to which a small perturbation is added which denotes the appropriate weak passing gw @xcite .",
    "no one asks in such cases if these 4d perturbations , which propagate as gw s , occur in the background of some stationary higher dimensional neighbourhood .",
    "one may , however , argue that as other physical waves , such as the electromagnetic ones , are considered as 3d oscillations in the background of the stationary 4d spacetime so the gw s may also be discussed as 4d oscillations in the background of a stationary 5d neighbourhood .",
    "this point of view was taken in the known kaluza s 5d theory and in the projective field formulations of general relativity ( unified field theories , see chapter xvii in @xcite ) where it was shown that the related expressions in the 5d spacetime were decomposed not only to the known einstein field equations but also to the not less known maxwell equations .    in this work",
    "we discuss gw from this point of view and use the stochastic quantization ( sq ) of paris - wu - namiki @xcite which is known to yield by a unique limiting process the equilibrium state of many classical and quantum phenomena @xcite .",
    "an important and central element of the sq is the assumption of an extra dimension termed in @xcite fictitious time in which some stochastic process , governed by either the langevin @xcite or the fokker - plank @xcite equations , is performed .",
    "thus , one may begin from either one of the two mentioned equations , which govern the assumed stochastic process in the extra dimension , and ends , by a limiting process in which all the different values of the relevant extra variable ( denoted @xmath20 ) are equated to each other and taken to infinity @xcite , in the equilibrium state .",
    "the main purpose of the sq theory @xcite is to obtain the expectation value of some random quantity or the correlation function of its variables .    in this work",
    "we consider , as an example of stochastic process which may be discussed in the framework of the parisi - wu - namiki sq , the mentioned activity of the human brain .",
    "that is , as it is possible to calculate the correlation between a large ensemble of brains in the sense of finding them radiating similar ew s so one may , theoretically , discuss the probability to find them radiating similar gw s . we show that although , as mentioned , the gw radiated by one brain is negligible compared to the related ew the correlation between the gw s radiated from a large number of them may not be small .",
    "but in order to be able to properly calculate this correlation we should discuss some specific kind , from a possible large number of kinds , of gw s .",
    "thus , we particularize to the cylindrical one and calculate the probability ( correlation ) to find an ensemble of @xmath21 human brains radiating cylindrical gw s . we do this by calculating this correlation in the extra dimension and show that once it is equated to unity one finds that in the stationary state ( where the extra variable is eliminated ) _ all the ensemble of brains radiate similar cylindrical gws_. as mentioned , no one has directly detected , up to now , any kind of gw so all our discussion is strictly theoretical in the hope that some day in the future these gw may at last be directly detected .",
    "as mentioned , the sq theory is suitable for discussing stochastic and unpredictable phenomena which should be analyzed by correlation terminology and probability terms .",
    "thus , we found it convenient to discuss the electron - photon interaction which originates from quantum fluctuations and results in the known lamb shift @xcite by the sq methods .",
    "we first calculate the states of the electron and photon and the interaction between them in the extra dimension and then show that in the limit of eliminating the extra variable one obtains the known expressions which characterize the lamb shift @xcite .    in appendix",
    "a we represent the formalism and main expressions of the parisi - wu - namiki sq theory . we , especially , introduce the expressions for the correlation among an ensemble of variables along given intervals of the time @xmath22 and the extra variable @xmath20 . in our discussion here of the cylindrical gw we use the fact emphasized in @xcite that _ the adm canonical formalism for the cylindrical gw is completely equivalent to the parametrized canonical formalism for the cylindrically symmetric massless scalar field on a minkowskian spacetime background_. moreover , as also emphasized in @xcite , one may use the half - parametrized formalism of the mentioned canonical formalism without losing any important content .",
    "thus , in section ii we introduce a short review of this half parametrized cylindrical massless scalar field in the background of the minkowsky spacetime where use is made of the results in @xcite . in section iii",
    "we represent and discuss the cylindrical gw in the framework of the sq formalism and introduce the probability that a large ensemble of brains are found to radiate cylindrical gw s .",
    "this probability is calculated in a detailed manner in appendix @xmath23 . in section",
    "iv we realize that the somewhat complex expression of the calculated probability in the extra dimension is greatly simplified at the mentioned stationary limit so that one may clearly see that for a unity value of it all the @xmath21-brain ensemble radiate the same cylindrical gw s . in section",
    "v we discuss the electron - photon interaction , which results in the known lamb shift @xcite , in the framework of the sq formalism and the fokker - plank equation @xcite . in section vi we show that at the limit of the stationary state , in which the extra variable is eliminated , one may obtain the known expressions related to the mentioned lamb shift as obtained in the framework of quantum field theory @xcite . in section vii",
    "we summarize the discussion .",
    "as discussed in appendix a the stochastic process in the extra dimension @xmath20 is described by the @xmath21 variables @xmath24 where the finite intervals @xmath25 , @xmath26 of @xmath20 and @xmath22 during which the former process `` evolutes '' are assumed each to be subdivided into @xmath27 subintervals @xmath28 and @xmath29 . in the application of the sq formalism for the ensemble of brains we identify the mentioned ensemble of @xmath21 variables @xmath30 , which describe the stochastic process in the extra dimension @xmath20 , with the ensemble of brains .",
    "this ensemble of variables ( brains ) is related , as is customary in the sq theory , to the corresponding ensemble of random forces @xmath31 .",
    "as mentioned , our aim is to calculate the correlation between the @xmath21-member ensemble of brains with respect to the cylindrical gw . that is , according to the results of appendix b , we calculate the conditional probability to find this ensemble of brains radiating at @xmath22 and @xmath20 the cylindrical gw s @xmath32 if they were found at @xmath33 and @xmath34 radiating the cylindrical gw s @xmath35 and at @xmath36 and @xmath37 they were found radiating the cylindrical gw s @xmath38 @xmath39 and at @xmath40 and @xmath41 they were radiating the cylindrical gw s @xmath42 ( see the discussion after eqs ( [ @xmath43 ) , ( [ @xmath44 ) and ( [ @xmath45 ) in appendix @xmath23 ) .",
    "as mentioned , the cylindrical gw , in its adm canonical formalism @xcite , is completetly equivalent @xcite to the parametrized canonical formalism for the cylindrically symmetric massless scalar field in a minkowskian background .",
    "thus , for introducing the relevant expressions related to the cylindrical gw @xcite we write the action functional @xmath6 for the massless cylindrical wave in the minkowskian background @xcite @xmath46 where @xmath47 is is the lagragian density @xcite @xmath48 the @xmath49 denotes the minkowskian time and @xmath50 is the radial distance from the symmetry axis in flat space @xcite .",
    "the expressions @xmath51 , and @xmath52 denote the respective derivatives of @xmath53 with respect to @xmath49 and @xmath50 . in the parametrized canonical formalism in a minkowskian background one",
    "have to introduce @xcite curvilinear coordinates @xmath22 and @xmath54 in flat space @xmath55 as shown in @xcite one may discuss the cylindrical scalar waves in a half - parametrized canonical formalism without losing any physical content except for the spatial covariance of the scalar wave formalism @xcite .",
    "in this half - parametrized canonical formalism one use the following coordinates @xmath56 it was shown in @xcite , using eqs ( [ e1])-([e2 ] ) and ( [ e4 ] ) , that the action @xmath6 assumes the simplified form @xmath57 where @xmath58 and @xmath59 denote derivatives of @xmath49 and @xmath53 with respect to @xmath22 .",
    "the @xmath27 is a lagrange multiplier and @xmath60 is @xcite @xmath61 where @xmath62 and @xmath63 are related as @xcite @xmath64 the last result were obtained by using the following definition of the momentum operator @xmath65 @xmath66 from eqs ( [ e6])-([e7 ] ) one realizes that @xmath60 satisfies the constraint @xcite @xmath67 note that we do not discuss yet the sq theory with the extra dimension which will be discussed in the following section .",
    "eqs ( [ e5])-([e9 ] ) ensure that in the framework of the half parametrized canonical formalism the following variational principle is satisfied @xcite @xmath68 where all variables @xmath49 , @xmath63 , @xmath69 , @xmath65 , and @xmath27 may be varied freely @xcite .",
    "note that the function @xmath63 may be represented as the operator @xcite @xmath70 .",
    "also , it should be remarked that the commutation relation between @xmath65 and @xmath71 is zero at the same point , i.g .",
    ", @xmath72 = i\\frac{\\delta(\\psi_{,r}(r , t))}{\\delta \\psi(r',t)}= i\\frac{d}{dr}(\\frac{\\delta(\\psi(r , t))}{\\delta \\psi(r',t)})= i\\frac{d\\delta(r - r')}{dr}=0 $ ] since the @xmath2 function is antisymmetric so that one have @xmath73 . the wave function @xmath74 ( not in the half - parametrized formalism ) , which is obtained as a solution of the einstein field equations for the cylindrical line element , is generally represented as an integral over all modes @xmath75 @xcite @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the bessel function of order zero @xcite .",
    "the quantities @xmath78 denote the amplitude and its complex conjugate for some specific mode @xmath75 .",
    "note that here one assumes , as done in the literature , @xmath79 so that @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the frequency , @xmath82 the wave number and @xmath83 the momentum of some mode .",
    "the momentum @xmath84 , canonically conjugate to @xmath74 , may be obtained @xcite by solving the hamilton equation @xmath85 where @xmath74 is from eq ( [ e11 ] ) and the curly brackets at the right denote the poisson brackets .",
    "the hamilton function @xmath86 is @xcite @xmath87 where @xmath88 and @xmath89 are respectively the rescaled superhamiltonian and supermomentum which where given in @xcite ( see eqs ( 93)-(97 ) and ( 106)-(108 ) in @xcite ) as @xmath90 the quantities @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 denote differentiation of @xmath74 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 with respect to @xmath54 ( where in the half - parametrized formalism @xmath94 as realized from eq ( [ e4 ] ) ) and @xmath95 are the respective momenta canonically conjugate to @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "the @xmath96 and @xmath97 from eq ( [ e13 ] ) respectively denote the rescaled lapse and shift function @xmath27 , @xmath98 ( see eqs ( 96 ) in @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the @xmath84 in the half - parametrized formalism were shown @xcite to be @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the first order bessel function @xcite obtained by differentiating @xmath77 with respect to @xmath50 , e.g. , @xmath101 .",
    "as shown in @xcite one may express , using the expression @xmath102 , the observables @xmath103 and @xmath104 in terms of @xmath74 and @xmath105 as @xmath106 - ij_0(kr)\\pi_{\\psi}(r , t)\\biggr\\ }    \\label{e16 } \\\\ &       a^*(k)=   \\frac{1}{2}\\int_{(0)}^{\\infty}dr   e^{ikt}\\biggl\\{rk\\biggl[\\psi(r , t)\\biggl(j_0(kr)+    it_{,r}j_1(kr)\\biggr)\\biggr ] + ij_0(kr)\\pi_{\\psi}(r , t)\\biggr\\ }   \\nonumber \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "we , now , discuss the cylindrical gw from the sq point of view and begin by writing the langevin equation ( [ @xmath107 ) of appendix @xmath108 for the subintervals @xmath109 and @xmath110 in the following form @xcite @xmath111 where @xmath112 and the @xmath113 are conditioned as @xcite @xmath114 note that although the @xmath20 dependence is emphasized in the last two equations one should remember that there exist also spatial and time dependence ( see the following discussion and eq ( [ e19 ] ) ) .",
    "the @xmath0 in eq ( [ e18 ] ) is as discussed after eq ( [ @xmath115 ) of appendix @xmath108 .",
    "the appropriate @xmath116 for the massless cylindrical scalar wave in the minkowskian background may be obtained by using eq ( [ @xmath117 ) in appendix a and eq ( [ e5 ] ) from which one realizes that the lagrangian @xmath47 depends upon two independent variables @xmath22 , @xmath50 and five dependent varables @xmath69 , @xmath65 , @xmath118 , @xmath63 , @xmath27 .",
    "note that in the following we represent @xmath53 and @xmath119 by the expressions from eqs ( [ e11 ] ) and ( [ e15 ] ) as mentioned after eq ( [ e23 ] ) .",
    "thus , although the functions @xmath53 and @xmath119 should be denoted , because of that , as @xmath74 and @xmath105 we denote them as @xmath69 and @xmath65 and take , of course , into account the dependence of @xmath49 upon @xmath54 and @xmath22 as realized , for example , in eqs ( [ e27 ] ) .",
    "the mentioned dependence of @xmath47 upon the dependent variables include in our case , as seen from eqs ( [ e6])-([e7 ] ) and ( [ e15 ] ) , dependence of @xmath47 also upon some derivatives of them , i.e. , @xmath59 , @xmath52 , @xmath58 , @xmath120 .",
    "thus , the involved variation of @xmath121 is given by @xmath122 as seen from eq ( [ e17 ] ) we are interested in calculating the function @xmath116 which is given by eqs ( [ e23 ] ) and ( [ @xmath117 ) in appendix @xmath108 as @xmath123}{\\delta \\psi})_{\\psi=\\psi(s , t , x)}$ ] where the function @xmath53 as function of @xmath20 is introduced only after varying the action @xmath124 as functional of @xmath53 . also , in order to deal with compact and simplified expressions , as done , for example , in eqs ( [ e19])-([e24 ] ) , we do not always write the various functions such as @xmath53 , @xmath119 , @xmath49 etc in their full dependence upon @xmath50 and @xmath49 .",
    "we , now , should realize that the integrand in the last equation ( [ e19 ] ) is the total differential @xmath125 , whereas we are interested in @xmath126 which is seen from eqs ( [ e23 ] ) and ( [ @xmath117 ) in appendix a to be equal to the negative variation of the action @xmath124 with respect to @xmath53 .",
    "thus , according to the definition of @xmath6 from eq ( [ e1 ] ) @xmath126 should involve the @xmath50 and @xmath22 integration of the negative variation of the lagrangian @xmath47 with respect to @xmath53 .",
    "that is , we should consider only the first three terms of eq ( [ e19 ] ) which are related to @xmath53 and its derivatives .",
    "thus , for calculating the variations of these derivatives we note that @xmath127 , @xmath128 are the respective differences between the original and varied @xmath59 , @xmath52 and , therefore , they may be written as ( see p. 493 in @xcite ) @xmath129 using the former discussion and the last equations ( [ e20 ] ) one may write the appropriate expression for @xmath130 as @xmath131 the second term at the right hand side of the last equation may be integrated by parts with respect to @xmath50 where the resulting surface terms are assumed to vanish because @xmath53 tends to zero at infinite distances @xcite . the third term at the right hand side of eq ( [ e21 ] ) may also be integrated by parts with respect to @xmath22 where the boundary terms vanish because of the following assumed conditions of the variational principle @xcite @xmath132 .",
    "thus , eq ( [ e21 ] ) becomes @xmath133 we note that analogous discussion regarding the quantization of wave fields may be found at pages 492 - 493 in @xcite .",
    "thus , using the former discussion and eq ( [ e22 ] ) one may write the following expression for @xmath126 @xmath134}{\\delta \\psi})_{\\psi=\\psi(s , t , x)}=   -2\\pi\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}dt\\int_{(0)}^{\\infty}dr\\frac{\\delta{\\cal l}}{\\delta \\psi}= \\nonumber \\\\ & = -2\\pi\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty } \\int_{(0)}^{\\infty}\\biggl(\\frac{\\partial { \\cal l}}{\\partial    \\psi}-\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r }     \\bigl(\\frac{\\partial { \\cal l}}{\\partial    ( \\psi_{,r})}\\bigr)-\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t }     \\bigl(\\frac{\\partial { \\cal l}}{\\partial    ( \\psi_{,t})}\\bigr )   \\biggr ) dt dr \\label{e23 }     \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in order to obtain final calculable results we use , as mentioned , for @xmath53 and @xmath119 the respective expressions of eqs ( [ e11 ] ) and ( [ e15 ] ) .",
    "also , noting that @xmath119 from eq ( [ e15 ] ) depends upon the derivatives @xmath52 , @xmath59 one may use eqs ( [ e5])-([e7 ] ) and ( [ e9 ] ) to calculate the three expressions in the integrand of the last equation ( [ e23 ] ) as follows @xmath135 as seen from eq ( [ e23 ] ) the expressions @xmath136 and @xmath137 should be respectively differentiated with respect to @xmath50 and @xmath22 .",
    "thus , taking into account that these derivatives serve as integrands of integrals over @xmath50 and @xmath22 and using eqs ( [ e24 ] ) one may write eq ( [ e23 ] ) as @xmath138 in the following we use the boundary values related to the function @xmath49 ( see section iii in @xcite ) @xmath139 also , because of representing @xmath53 through the expression ( [ e11 ] ) , one may use the relation @xcite @xmath101 in order to write the derivatives of @xmath53 with respect to @xmath22 and @xmath54 as @xmath140 note that the leading terms of the bessel s functions of integer orders in the limits of very small and very large arguments are @xcite @xmath141 where @xmath142 . from the last limiting relations one obtains for @xmath143 and @xmath144 @xmath145 taking into account eqs ( [ e27 ] ) and the derivative @xmath101",

    "thus , one remains with only the last term at the right hand side of eq ( [ e30 ] ) which , using eqs ( [ e11 ] ) , ( [ e26 ] ) , ( [ e29 ] ) and the integrals @xcite @xmath155 and @xmath156 , may be reduced to @xmath157 we note , as emphasized in @xcite , that a hypersurface of constant time @xmath22 is not assumed to have conical singularity on the axis of symmetry @xmath158 .",
    "this requires the condition @xcite @xmath159 .",

    "that is , the conditional probability here includes a condition for each of the @xmath27 subintervals @xmath220 so that the superscripts of the variables @xmath53 at the beginnings of all these subintervals are the same as at the ends of them as remarked after eqs ( [ @xmath43 ) , ( [ @xmath44 ) , ( [ @xmath45 ) and ( [ @xmath221 ) in appendix @xmath23 .",
    "from the last equation ( [ e39 ] ) one may realize that for assigning to @xmath222 a probability meaning which have values only in the range @xmath223 the following inequality should be satisfied @xmath224 taking the @xmath225 of the two sides of the last inequality and solving for @xmath206 one obtains @xmath226^{\\frac{1}{2 } } , \\nonumber \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where for a unity probability one should consider the equality sign of the last inequality .",

    "this may be shown when one equates all the different values of @xmath20 to each other and taking the infinity limit as should be done in the stationary configuration .",

    "this means that the probability to find the related ensemble of brains all radiating at @xmath233 cylindrical gw @xmath234 is unity .",
    "note from the discussion in appendix @xmath23 that the stationary state from eq ( [ e43 ] ) have been obtained by inserting the cylindrical gw langevin expression from eq ( [ e33])-([e34 ] ) into the action @xmath235 for each subinterval @xmath236 of each member of the ensemble of variables as realized from eqs ( [ @xmath180)-([@xmath237 ) in appendix @xmath23 .",

    "the main lesson one learns from the discussion in the former sections about the gravitational brainwaves is that introducing the cylindrical gw expression into the actions @xmath6 of the path integrals related to the mentioned ensemble of variables ( brains ) results with the outcome that the probability to find them radiating this kind of waves is large . in this section",
    "we demonstrate this again regarding the quantum fluctuations which cause the shifting of the energy bands in the known lamb shift experiment @xcite . here",
    "the ensemble of stochastic processes do not represent , as in the previous sections , any biological brain activity but the action of a two - state electron which emits a photon and then reabsorbs it where the total energy during this process is not conserved .",

    "also , it is assumed that each of these stochastic processes is performed during finite @xmath20 and @xmath22 intervals @xmath174 , @xmath175 and that each of these intervals is subdivided into an @xmath27 subintervals @xmath240 , @xmath241 , ",

    "we formulate the appropriate expression for the described electron - photon interaction over some representative subintervals @xmath109 and @xmath110 and calculate the probability to find the ensemble of stochastic processes giving rise to the same remarked electron - photon interaction .",
    "in contrast to the discussion in the former sections where we use the stochastic langevin formulation of the sq theory we , now , find it better to discuss the equivalent fokker - plank version of it @xcite . that is , we use the following fokker plank equation @xcite @xmath246 where @xmath247 denotes the conditional probability to find the relevant ensemble of stochastic processes giving rise at @xmath248 and @xmath192 to the state @xmath249 if at the former @xmath250 and @xmath251 they give rise to the state @xmath252 . in the context of this section the states @xmath249 and @xmath252 are in effect two total situations each of them includes all the particular photon - electron interaction states related to the ensemble of stochastic variables at the two different @xmath22 and @xmath20 values of @xmath253 , @xmath254 and @xmath250 @xmath251 . in this way",
    "the @xmath179 s here have similar meaning to the @xmath179 s of the former sections which are related to cylindrical gw s .",
    "the @xmath255 in eq ( [ e44 ] ) is @xcite @xmath256 where @xmath86 , @xmath257 and @xmath249 are , respectively , the `` stochastic '' hamiltonian , momentum and state for the subintervals @xmath258 , @xmath259 .",
    "the @xmath0 , as mentioned after eq ( [ e3 ] ) , is either @xmath260 for classical phenomena or @xmath261 for quantum ones .",
    "the momentum @xmath257 is , as in quantum mechanics , a differential operator defined by @xcite @xmath262 and satisfied the commutation relations @xcite @xmath263= 2\\alpha \\delta^{mn}$ ] .",
    "the operator @xmath264 from eq ( [ e45 ] ) is also a differential operator which may be written generally for the ensemble of @xmath21 stochastic processes as @xcite @xmath265 noting that @xmath266 has the same meaning as in the langevin formalism of the sq theory ( see eq ( [ e17 ] ) and eq ( [ @xmath107 ) in appendix @xmath108 ) one may write the last equation ( [ e46 ] ) in a manner which emphasizes the underlying stochastic process @xmath267 @xmath268 as emphasized in @xcite one may develop , using the former relations , a stochastic operator formalism which corresponds to the quantum one so that it is possible to formulate a `` schroedinger '' , `` heisenberg '' and `` interaction '' pictures .",
    "thus , assuming an ensemble of @xmath21 stochastic processes , using the `` interaction '' picture and considering the whole intervals @xmath26 , and @xmath269 one may calculate the conditional probability to find at @xmath20 and @xmath22 these processes giving rise to the state @xmath53 if at the initial @xmath41 and @xmath40 they give rise to the state @xmath270 .",
    "this conditional probability is given by @xcite @xmath271 where the superscript @xmath272 reminds us that we use the `` interaction '' picture and @xmath273 is the probability that the ensemble of stochastic processes give rise at the initial @xmath40 and @xmath41 to the initial state @xmath270 .",
    "the states @xmath53 depends upon @xmath20 and @xmath22 and , therefore , the integration over @xmath53 is , actually , a double one over @xmath20 and @xmath22 .",
    "thus , substituting in a perturbative manner @xcite for @xmath274 one may write eq ( [ e48 ] ) as @xmath275 note that in the last equation we have obtained in each term the same factor of @xmath273 . now , since the lamb shift results from quantum fluctuations and since the states in quantum mechanics as well as in sq @xcite have a probabilistic interpretation we may assume that the probabilities @xmath276 denote states .",
    "we should , however , emphasize ( again ) that these @xmath179 s from eq ( [ e49 ] ) , as those of the previous sections ( see , for example , eqs ( [ e34])-([e35 ] ) ) , refer to the states of the whole ensemble of stochastic variables in the sense of the conditional probability to find them at a later @xmath20 and @xmath22 in some situation @xmath53 if , for example , at the initial @xmath41 and @xmath40 they were at the situation @xmath270 .",
    "we later at eqs ( [ e50])-([e59 ] ) denote the respective particular states of the interacting electron and photon by @xmath277 and @xmath278 .",
    "thus , following the last discussion one may use the quantum rules and terms as in @xcite , except for the introduction of the extra variable @xmath20 , for representing the electron and photon before and after the interaction between them as well as the general state of the whole ensemble of stochastic variables .",
    "the variable @xmath20 is introduced into the relevant quantities so that in the limit of equating all the different @xmath20 values to each other and taking to infinity , as required in the sq theory @xcite , the known expressions @xcite which represent the electron and photon and the correlation between them are obtained .",
    "thus , one may assign to the initial @xmath41 and @xmath40 the value of zero and refer to @xmath279 as the initial state of the ensemble system .",
    "as remarked , the electron is assumed to have two different states so that at @xmath280 and @xmath281 it was at the higher state 2 from which it descends to the lower state 1 through emitting a photon .",
    "then at @xmath282 and @xmath283 it reabsorbs the photon and returns to state 2 as schematically shown at the left hand side of figure 1 . in the following we denote the higher and lower energies of the electron by @xmath284 and @xmath285 respectively and that of the photon by @xmath286 where , due to the nonconserved energy character of the interaction , @xmath287 .",
    "we wish to represent the @xmath20 dependence of the electron and photon in the extra dimension in a similar manner as their @xmath22 dependence . the conventional @xmath22 dependence ( see , for example , chapter 7 in @xcite ) of an incoming electron with energy @xmath284 at time @xmath280 ( before any interaction of it ) is @xmath288 and that of an outgoing electron with energy @xmath285 at time @xmath282 ( after any interaction of it ) is @xmath289 .",
    "the @xmath22 dependence of the emitted photon at @xmath280 is @xcite @xmath290 and that of the reabsorbed photon at @xmath282 by @xmath291 .",
    "thus , according to the former discussion the @xmath292 dependence of the incoming electron @xmath293 and the emitted photon @xmath294 at @xmath280 and @xmath281 may be represented by @xmath295 where @xmath2 is an infinitesimal satisfying @xmath296 , and @xmath297 , ( @xmath298 is a constant ) @xcite .",
    "this is done so that for finite values of @xmath20 the dependence upon @xmath20 , for both the electron and photon , is similar , as remarked , to the dependence upon @xmath22 and when @xmath299 , which is the equilibrium situation in the sq theory , the terms in @xmath20 vanish as required .",
    "that is @xmath300 the expression for the outgoing electron at @xmath280 and @xmath281 with the lower energy @xmath285 ( after emitting the photon ) and its reduction for finite and infinite @xmath20 are @xmath301 where the @xmath2 has the same meaning as before .",
    "just before the reabsorption stage at @xmath282 and @xmath283 the electron and photon are represented by @xmath302 needless to remark that , according to our discussion , the former expressions reduce , for finite and infinite @xmath20 , to @xmath303 just after the reabsorption at @xmath283 and @xmath282 the expression for the electron and its reduction for finite and infinite @xmath20 are @xmath304 beside the former expressions for the separate electron and photon we should take into acount also the interaction between them , that is , the emission and reabsorption of the photon by the electron .",
    "this interaction for the emission part in the extra dimension @xmath20 , denoted @xmath305 , may be written as @xmath306 where @xmath307 , @xmath308 , denote the two energy states of the electron as given by eqs ( [ e50])-([e55 ] ) and @xmath294 is the expression for the photon given by eqs ( [ e50])-([e51 ] ) and ( [ e53])-([e54 ] ) .",
    "the @xmath286 and @xmath10 are respectively the energy of the emitted photon and the dielectric constant in vacuum .",
    "the integration is over the volume which includes also the @xmath20 dimension and the @xmath83 is the momentum operator which is represented by @xmath309 .",
    "the former expression for the emission interaction is suggested so that in the limit of @xmath299 it reduces to the known emission interaction which does not involve the @xmath20 variable ( see eq ( 7.112 ) in @xcite ) .",
    "that is , @xmath310 where the last result is obtained by noting from eqs ( [ e50])-([e55 ] ) and that in the limit @xmath299 the expressions for the electron and photon reduce to their known forms @xcite .",
    "the interaction for the reabsorption part may be obtained by noting that the expressions for the electron and photon participating in the reabsorption interaction are obtained by taking the hermitian adjoints of the expressions for the electron and photon participating in the emission process .",
    "thus , using the rule @xcite that the hermitian adjoint of the product of some expressions is the product of their adjoints in the reverse order , one may obtain the interaction for the reabsorption part , denoted @xmath311 , from that of the emission part @xmath305 as follows @xmath312 the reabsorption interaction reduces at the limit of @xmath299 , just like the emission process in eq ( [ e57 ] ) , to the known reabsorption interaction @xcite which does not involve the extra @xmath20 variable .",
    "that is , @xmath313 note that the whole processes of emission and reabsorption may , respectively , be read directly from eqs ( [ e57 ] ) and ( [ e59 ] ) if one realizes that the operator @xmath83 in each of these equations denotes the interaction undergone by the expressions ( denoting electron or ( and ) photon ) at its right hand side which result with the expressions ( also denoting electron or ( and ) photon ) at its left hand side .",
    "thus , in eq ( [ e57 ] ) , which describes the emission process , the @xmath307 at the right of @xmath83 denotes the initial electron with the higher energy state 2 and the @xmath314 at the left of @xmath83 are the electron with the lower energy state 1 and the emitted photon .",
    "likewise , in eq ( [ e59 ] ) , which describes the reabsorption process , the @xmath315 at the right of @xmath83 denotes the initial lower energy electron and the photon , before the reabsorption , and the @xmath316 at the left of @xmath83 is the electron with the higher energy state 2 after the reabsorption .",
    "now , we must realize that the final state at @xmath22 and @xmath20 after the reabsorption of the photon , where we remain with one electron with the higher energy state 2 , is the same as the initial state at @xmath40 and @xmath41 before the emission of the photon from the higher energy electron .",
    "thus , we may write for the relevant @xmath276 at the end of the whole process of emission and reabsorption @xcite @xmath317 where the coefficient @xmath318 denotes the mentioned evolution during the @xmath26 and @xmath25 intervals from the initial state @xmath273 back to the same state . we first note that as the @xmath292 dependence of the states of the electron and photon were represented as sums of two terms , one involves only the @xmath22 term and the second only the @xmath20 term , so the @xmath292 dependence of the entire mentioned interaction of ( emission@xmath319reabsorption ) @xmath318 may also be written as a sum of two separate terms , denoted @xmath320 and @xmath321 each of them involves only one variable .",
    "this is done , as will just be realized , so that at the equilibrium limit the @xmath20 term vanishes and remains only the @xmath22 term as is the case regarding the mentioned @xmath292 representation of the states of the electron and photon ( see eqs ( [ e50])-([e55 ] ) ) .",
    "thus , for the @xmath22 dependence of the emission process one should take into account that : ( 1 ) the emission process is executed during the interval @xmath322 , ( 2 ) the electron before and after emission at @xmath323 is , respectively , represented by @xmath288 and @xmath324 , ( 3 ) the emitted photon at @xmath323 is given by @xmath290 and ( 4 ) the emission itself is described by the interaction @xmath325 . and for the @xmath22 dependence of the reabsorption process one should take into account that : ( 1 ) the reabsorption process is executed during the interval @xmath326 , ( 2 ) the electron before and after reabsorption at @xmath327 is , respectively , represented by @xmath328 and @xmath329 , ( 3 ) the reabsorbed photon at @xmath327 is given by @xmath291 and ( 4 ) the reabsorption itself is described by the interaction @xmath330 .",
    "thus , one may write the @xmath22 dependence of the ( emission@xmath319reabsorption ) process @xmath320 as @xmath331 simiarly , for the @xmath20 dependence of the emission process one should take into account that : ( 1 ) the emission process is executed during the interval @xmath332 , ( 2 ) the electron before and after emission is , respectively , represented by @xmath333 and @xmath334 , ( 3 ) the emitted photon is given by @xmath335 and ( 4 ) the emission itself is described by the interaction @xmath305 . and",

    "thus , one may write the @xmath20 dependence of the ( emission@xmath319reabsorption ) process @xmath321 as @xmath341ds_1 \\cdot \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\cdot \\int_{0}^s\\exp\\biggl[i\\biggl(\\epsilon_2+i\\delta\\bigl(\\epsilon_2 + \\epsilon_1+w_{\\lambda}\\bigr)- w_{\\lambda}-\\epsilon_1\\biggr)s_2\\biggr]ds_2 ,    \\label{e62 }    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have set , as remarked , @xmath342 for both @xmath320 and @xmath321 .",
    "the coefficient @xmath343 from eq ( [ e60 ] ) is given , as remarked , by the sum @xmath344 so that in the equilibrium state obtained in the limit in which all the values of @xmath20 are equated to each other and taken to infinity the term @xmath321 vanishes and remains only the term @xmath320 as should be @xcite .",
    "the term @xmath321 vanishes in the stationary state because we have already equated the initial @xmath41 to zero so for equating all the @xmath20 s to each other one have to set also the other values of @xmath20 equal to zero which obviously causes @xmath321 from eq ( [ e62 ] ) to vanish .",
    "note that thus far we have discussed a single mode @xmath345 for the emitted and reabsorbed photon which makes sense in a cavity whose closed walls are of the same order as the wavelength of the photon .",
    "but for an infinite space or a cavity with open sides one should consider a continuum of modes @xmath346 .",
    "thus , considering this continuum of modes and performing the integration over @xmath280 and @xmath281 from eqs ( [ e61])-([e62 ] ) one obtains @xmath347 - 1\\biggr\\}}{i(\\epsilon_1+w_{\\lambda}-\\epsilon_2 ) } \\cdot \\nonumber \\\\ & \\cdot   \\exp\\biggl[i(\\epsilon_2-w_{\\lambda}-\\epsilon_1)t_2\\biggr]+   \\sum_{\\lambda_s}g^{em}_{\\lambda_s}\\cdot ( { g^{em}_{\\lambda_s}})\\dagger    \\cdot \\label{e63 }     \\\\ & \\cdot   \\int_{0}^sds_2\\frac{\\biggl\\{\\exp\\biggl[i\\biggl(\\epsilon_1- \\epsilon_2+w_{\\lambda}+i\\delta(\\epsilon_2+\\epsilon_1+w_{\\lambda})\\biggr ) s_2\\biggr]-1\\biggr\\ } } { i\\biggl(\\epsilon_1-\\epsilon_2+w_{\\lambda}+ i\\delta(\\epsilon_2+\\epsilon_1+w_{\\lambda})\\biggr ) } \\cdot \\nonumber \\\\ & \\cdot \\exp\\biggl[i\\biggl(\\epsilon_2- \\epsilon_1-w_{\\lambda}+   i\\delta\\bigl(\\epsilon_2+\\epsilon_1+w_{\\lambda}\\bigr)\\biggr)s_2\\biggr ] \\nonumber \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    now , performing the integration over @xmath283 and @xmath282 we obtain from eq ( [ e63 ] ) @xmath348 - 1 } { i\\biggl(\\epsilon_2-\\epsilon_1-w_{\\lambda}+ i\\delta\\bigl(\\epsilon_2+\\epsilon_1+w_{\\lambda}\\bigr)\\biggr)}\\biggr\\ } \\nonumber \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] one may realize that , because of the @xmath2 ( see its definition after eq ( [ e50 ] ) ) , the quotient @xmath349 in the second sum , which is of the kind @xmath350 , may be evaluated , using lhospital theorem @xcite , to obtain for it the result of @xmath20 so that eq ( [ e64 ] ) becomes @xmath351 - 1 } { i\\biggl(\\epsilon_2-\\epsilon_1-w_{\\lambda}+ i\\delta\\bigl(\\epsilon_2+\\epsilon_1+w_{\\lambda}\\bigr)\\biggr)}\\biggr\\ } \\nonumber \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the last expression for @xmath343 contains terms which are proportional to @xmath22 and @xmath20 , others which are oscillatory in these variables , and also constant terms .",
    "thus , for large @xmath22 and @xmath20 the oscillatory as well as the constant terms may be neglected compared to @xmath22 and @xmath20 as in the analogous quantum discussion of the same process @xcite ( without the extra variable ) .",
    "that is , one may obtain for @xmath318 @xmath352 substituting from the last equation in eq ( [ e60 ] ) one obtains @xmath353 where @xmath354 and @xmath355 are @xmath356 the result in eq ( [ e67 ] ) is only for the first - order term in eq ( [ e49 ] ) which involves one emission and one reabsorption done over the intervals @xmath357 , @xmath358 .",
    "if these emission and reabsorption are repeated for each one of the many subintervals into which the former finite @xmath20 and @xmath22 intervals were subdivided so that all the higher order terms of this process ( @xmath359 ) are taken into account one obtains , analogously to the quantum analog @xcite ( in which the variable @xmath20 is absent ) , the result @xmath360 the left hand side of figure 1 shows a feynman diagram @xcite of the emission and reabsorption process performed once over the relevant @xmath22 interval whereas the right hand side of it shows a feynman diagram of the fourth order term of this process over the same @xmath22 interval .",
    "now , as required by the sq theory , the stationary situations are obtained in the limit of eliminating the extra variable @xmath20 which is done by equating all the @xmath20 values to each other and taking to infinity .",
    "thus , since , as remarked , we have equated the initial @xmath41 to zero we must equate all the other @xmath20 values to zero .",
    "that is , the stationary state is @xmath361 the last result is the one obtained in quantum field theory @xcite for the same interaction ( without any extra variable ) .",
    "the quantity @xmath354 , given by the first of eqs ( [ e68 ] ) , has the same form also in the quantum version @xcite , where it is termed the energy shift .",
    "this shift have been experimentally demonstrated in the quantum field theory for the case of a real many - state particle in the famous lamb shift of the hydrogen atom @xcite .",
    "note that , as for the gravitational brainwaves case , introducing the expression of the detailed electron - photon interaction for all the subintervals of @xmath20 and @xmath22 of all the stochastic processes yields a correlation among them which truly represents , in the stationary situation , the corelation of the real interaction .",
    "that is , when all the values of @xmath20 are equated to each other and eliminated the equilibrium stage is obtained .",
    "one may , also , note that the elimination of the @xmath20 variable is fulfilled by only equating all its values to each other without having to take the infinity limit ( see the discussion before eq ( [ @xmath362 ) in appendix @xmath108 ) .",
    "for the first half of this work we have used the fact that the ionic currents and charges in cerebral system radiates electric waves as may be realized by attaching electrodes to the scalp .",
    "that is , one may physically and logically assume that just as these ionic currents and charges in the brain give rise to electric waves so the masses related to these ions and charges should give rise , according to the einstein s field equations , to weak gw s . from this",
    "we have proceeded to calculate the correlation among an @xmath21 brain ensemble in the sense of finding them at some time radiating a similar gravitational waves if they were found at an earlier time radiating other gw s . we have used as a specific example of gravitational wave the cylindrical one which have been investigated in a thorough and intensive way ( see , for example @xcite ) .",
    "the applied mathematical model , used for calculating the mentioned correlation , was the parisi - wu - namiki sq theory @xcite which assumes a stochastic process performed in an extra dimension so that at the limit of eliminating the relevant extra variable one obtains the physical stationary state .",
    "the hypothetical stochastic process , which is governed by either the langevin or the fokker - plank equation , allows a large ensemble of @xmath21 different variables @xmath53 which describes this process @xcite and represent the mentioned gravitational brainwaves radiated by the @xmath21 brain ensemble .",
    "thus , we have calculated the correlation in the extra dimension among the @xmath21 brain ensemble and show that at the limits of ( 1 ) eliminating the relevant extra variable and ( 2 ) maximum correlation one obtains the expected result of finding all of them radiating the same cylindrical gw .",
    "a similar and parallel discussion of the electron - photon interaction , which results in the known lamb shift , was carried in the second half of this work .",
    "this physical example is known to have originated from vacuum fluctuations and is in effect one of the first phenomena which were found to be related to these fluctuations .",
    "thus , it seems natural to discuss it in terms of the sq theory in which , as mentioned , some stochastic random forces at an extra dimension generate at the equilibrium stage the known physical stationary state .",
    "as mentioned , the mechanism which allows the reduction of the random stochastic process in the extra dimension to the known physical stationary state is the introduction of this same state in all the @xmath27 subintervals of all the @xmath21 variables .",
    "this means that once all the different @xmath20 values are eliminated for all the subintervals of all the variables one remains with the same introduced physical stationary state for all of them .",
    "the same mechanism may be shown to take effect not only for the assumed weak cylindrical gw s radiated by the brain and the quantum fluctuations of the lamb shift discussed here but also for any other physical phenomena which may be discussed by variational methods .",
    "the parisi - wu - namiki sq theory @xcite for any stochastic process @xcite may use either the langevin equation @xcite or the fokker - plank one @xcite as its basic starting point . for the following introductory representation of the sq theory and in sections ii - iv we find it convenient to use the langevin equation whereas in sections v - vi we discuss the electron - photon interaction which results in the known lamb shift @xcite from the point of view of the fokker - plank equation . the stochastic process , which is assumed in the sq theory to occur in some extra dimension @xmath20 , is generally considered to be of the wienner - markoff type @xcite and to be described by the @xmath21 variables @xmath363",
    ". this stochastic process is also characterized by the @xmath21 random forces @xmath364 which are gaussian white noise @xcite .",
    "thus , denoting the process related to the @xmath171 variable by @xmath365 , where @xmath366 , one may analyze it by taking its rate of change with respect to @xmath20 according to the generalized langevin equation @xcite @xmath367 where @xmath21 denotes the remarked @xmath21-member ensemble of variables and @xmath368 denotes stochatic process related to the variable @xmath365 .",

    "for properly discussing the `` evolution '' of the related process @xmath365 one , generally , subdivides the @xmath22 and @xmath20 intervals @xmath26 , @xmath25 into @xmath27 subintervals @xmath243 , @xmath244 ,  @xmath372 and @xmath240 , @xmath241 , ",
    "we assume that the langevin eq ( [ @xmath107 ) is satisfied for each member of the ensemble of variables at each subinterval with the following gaussian constraints @xcite @xmath374 where the angular brackets denote an ensemble average with the gaussian distribution , the @xmath75 superscript denotes the @xmath75 subinterval from the @xmath27 available and the @xmath171 , @xmath375 refer to the mentioned @xmath21 variables where @xmath376 .",

    "is identified @xcite with the plank constant @xmath379 .",
    "we note that using eqs ( [ @xmath107)-([@xmath115 ) enables one @xcite to discuss a large number of different classical and quantum phenomena .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that the right hand side of eq ( [ @xmath115 ) may be derived from the following gaussian distribution law @xcite @xmath380 which is the probability density for the variable @xmath365 and for the subintervals @xmath110 , @xmath109 to have a value of @xmath187 in @xmath381 @xcite , where @xmath382    for the @xmath21 variables one may write eq ( [ @xmath383 ) for the subintervals @xmath110 , @xmath109 as @xmath384 which is the probability density for the @xmath21 variables @xmath385 to have a value of @xmath187 in @xmath381 where @xmath386 . the angular brackets are product over any two variables as given in eq ( [ @xmath115 ) .",

    "@xmath25 , @xmath26 , which as mentioned were each subdivided into @xmath27 subintervals , one may generalize eq ( [ @xmath391 ) as @xmath392 where now the @xmath393 at the left is @xmath394 .",
    "note that eqs ( [ @xmath383 ) , ( [ @xmath391 ) and ( [ @xmath395 ) denote probability densities as realized from the @xmath393 at the left hand sides of these equations . in order to find the probabilities themselves one have to integrate the right hand sides of these equations over the appropriate variables .",
    "thus , using eqs ( [ @xmath107 ) , ( [ @xmath115 ) and ( [ @xmath396 ) one may write eq ( [ @xmath383 ) in a more informative way as @xmath397 where we have approximated @xmath398 .",

    "since it involves the same variable it may be termed autocorrelation of @xmath403 over the subintervals @xmath404 , @xmath405 . in a similar manner one may write eq ( [ @xmath400 ) for the whole ensemble of @xmath21 variables in the subintervals @xmath110 and @xmath109 as @xmath406 and",
    "the conditional probability over the whole intervals @xmath25 and @xmath26 may similarly be obtained by adding other factors and sums over the remaining @xmath407 subintervals .",
    "if one assume @xmath27 to be very large , and therefore the length of each subinterval to be very small , one may use feynman path integral @xcite as follows @xmath408 where @xmath409 is a normalization constant . the former formula",
    "may equivalently be written as @xcite @xmath410 where each @xmath179 at the right is essentially of the form of eq ( [ @xmath168 ) and the integrals are over the @xmath27 subintervals .",
    "the last equation , which is the conditional probability to find the ensemble of @xmath21 variables at @xmath22 and @xmath20 with the configuration @xmath53 if at @xmath40 and @xmath41 they have the configuration @xmath411 , is also equivalent @xcite to the green s functions @xmath412 which determine the correlation among the members of the ensemble @xcite .",
    "this function , as defined in @xcite , is @xmath413 where @xmath124 are the actions @xmath414 , @xmath409 is a normalization constant , and @xmath415 . as seen from the last equation the @xmath416",

    "it can be seen that when the @xmath20 s are different for the members of the ensemble so that each have its specific @xmath420 , @xmath421 , and @xmath422 the correlation in ( [ @xmath418 ) is obviously zero .",
    "thus , in order to have a nonzero value for the probability to find a large part of the ensemble of variables having the same or similar forms we have to consider the stationary configuration where , as remarked , all the @xmath20 values are equated to each other and taken to infinity . for that matter",
    "we take account of the fact that the dependence upon @xmath20 and @xmath22 is through @xmath53 so this ensures @xcite that this dependence is expressed through the @xmath20 and @xmath22 differences .",
    "for example , referring to the members @xmath171 and @xmath375 the correlation between them is @xmath423 , so that for eliminating the @xmath20 variable from the correlation function one equates all these different @xmath20 s to each other .",
    "we , thus , obtain the following stationary equilibrium correlation @xcite @xmath424 where the suffix of @xmath425 denotes the stationary configuration .",
    "in other words , the equilibrium correlation in our case is obtained when all the different @xmath20 values are equated to each other and taken to infinity in which case one remains with the known stationary result .",
    "thus , if all the members of the ensemble of variables have similar actions @xmath6 ( in which the @xmath20 values are equated to each other ) one finds with a large probability these members , in the later equilibrium stage , with the same result . that is , introducing the same similar actions into the corresponding path integrals one finds this mentioned large probability .",
    "this has been expicitly shown in section iv for the cylindrical gravitational wave and in sections v - vi for the lamb shift case .",
    "we , now , derive the expression for the correlation from eq ( [ e39 ] ) .",
    "for that we may use eq ( [ @xmath177 ) of appendix @xmath108 in which we substistute for the @xmath179 s from eqs ( [ @xmath400)-([@xmath168 ) . as noted in appendix @xmath108 the correlation is calculated not only among the ensemble of @xmath21 variables but also for each of the @xmath27 subintervals into which the finite @xmath22 and @xmath20 intervals are divided .",
    "thus , assuming , as noted in appendix @xmath108 , that @xmath27 is very large we may use the feynman path integral of eq ( [ @xmath176 ) and write this correlation as @xmath426 where @xmath409 is a normalization constant to be determined later from @xmath427 .",
    "note that in the exponent of eq ( [ @xmath180 ) , in contrast to that of eq ( [ @xmath176 ) in appendix @xmath108 , the sum over @xmath171 precedes that over @xmath75 and , therefore , the squared expression involves the variables @xmath181 , @xmath182 etc ( instead of @xmath181 , @xmath183 of ( [ @xmath176 ) ) .",
