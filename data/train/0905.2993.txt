    "spohn claimed that the critical point in @xcite of @xmath14 fluctuations for equilibrium tasep becomes a critical window ( representing the region of the rarefaction fan ) as @xmath2 is increased and @xmath9 decreased .",

    "in these papers , the entire one time fluctuation process is characterized in the case of the shock .",
    "the scaling conjectured for the rarefaction fan was proved in @xcite ( in terms of the corresponding corner growth / lpp model discussed below ) , though the scaling functions were not addressed therein .    beyond giving a complete proof of the prhofer  spohn conjecture , we believe that our coupling methods are very natural and provide a highly intuitive explanation for the transition between gaussian and tracy  widom scalings .",
    "these methods are also useful in studying last passage percolation models with more general weights and more general boundary conditions . in proving the prhofer  spohn conjecture , one may alternatively follow the approach of @xcite which is necessary in the critical case @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "that argument is very strong and widely applicable .",
    "it is based on the idea of the schur measure and involves a shift argument and a necessary analytic continuation argument .",
    "coupling completely avoids these technical issues and replaces the complex analysis and asymptotic analysis with simple and intuitive probability .",
    "it also seems to be applicable in certain cases where the schur measure argument can not be applied .    much effort has been devoted to understanding the analogous picture for asep , where particles may move to either the left of the right but are still subject to the exclusion rule .",
    "progress in this direction was made in @xcite in the early 1990s .",
    "the work of baik and rains @xcite , prhofer and spohn @xcite and imamura and sasamoto @xcite in the context of the closely related png model and last passage percolation with geometric weights was very important in formulating and understanding the theory of fluctuations . very recently ,",
    "due to the efforts of tracy and widom @xcite ) , derrida and gerschenfeld @xcite , balzs and sepplinen @xcite , quastel and valk @xcite , mountford and guiol @xcite significant progress has been made in answering this question in the general asep .",

    "this implies that @xmath413 converges in distribution to a standard normal , just like @xmath175 .",
    "proof of theorem [ lpp_fluctuations ] , ( @xmath149 ) we couple @xmath175 with a random variable @xmath392 where @xmath392 is the last passage time when forced to stay along the bottom edge for at least a specific , deterministic fraction of the path [ we likewise define @xmath391 ] .",
    "specifically we define @xmath392 to be the last passage time when the path is pinned to the bottom edge until the point @xmath415 after which point is forced into the bulk and allowed to follow a last passage path therein .",
    "the weights accrued along the bottom edge respect a simple central limit ( as they are the sums of a deterministic number of i.i.d .",
    "random variables ) and the weights accrued after the path is forced into the bulk follows the fluctuations theorem for standard exponential last passage times .",
    "as these two random variables are independent by construction , their means add since their fluctuations are of different order ( @xmath416 for the bottom and @xmath417 for the bulk ) the bottom fluctuations win out .",
    "following this idea , we find that the mean of @xmath392 is @xmath418 and the fluctuations are normal with variance @xmath419    to see this , observe that if we center @xmath205 by the mean and divide by the square root of the above variance , we are left with a random variable of the form @xmath420 , where @xmath421 converges to a normal , and @xmath422 converges to a @xmath15 . since the second term has a prefactor which goes to zero , we see that @xmath423 can be partitioned into a region of size @xmath283 where @xmath424 and a region of size @xmath425 where @xmath426 . on the second region ,",
    "we can replace @xmath422 by @xmath427 and find asymptotically that the probability differs from @xmath428 by only @xmath283 .",
    "taking @xmath283 to zero gives the desired convergence in distribution .",
    "therefore if we center @xmath175 and @xmath392 by the same amount and renormalize by the same amount we get two random variables which converge to the same distribution , despite the first one being almost always larger than the second one .",
    "this is one of the pieces we will need to apply lemma [ max_lemma ] .",
    "we can likewise define @xmath391 as the last passage time when the path is pinned to the left edge until the point @xmath429 after which point is forced into the bulk and allowed to follow a last passage path therein . as in the prior",
    "we see that centered and renormalizing @xmath176 and @xmath391 by the same amounts , gives to random variables which converge to the same distribution , despite the first one being almost always larger than the second one .    from the relationship between @xmath98 and @xmath118",
    "we know that the leading order terms for both @xmath392 and @xmath391 coincide .",
    "therefore , we can write @xmath430 where @xmath431 and @xmath432 and @xmath433 are constants ( which will play no role here ) . if we consider now @xmath434 , we find that @xmath435 where @xmath436 and @xmath437 are , respectively , the events @xmath438    as before , because of the @xmath439 prefactor to the @xmath422 and @xmath440 terms , we can condition on these terms being bounded by some large number @xmath427 , and only cost ourselves @xmath283 of the sample space .",
