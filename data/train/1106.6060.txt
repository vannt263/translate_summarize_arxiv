    "experimental evidence for various types of symmetry breaking in the pseudogap region of the phase diagram of the high-@xmath0 cuprate superconductors has been accumulating in recent years .",
    "neutron scattering experiments discovered a subtle staggered magnetic order in the pseudo - gap region of ybco@xcite and hg - compounds@xcite that could be accounted for by either so - called nematic - spin - nematic order@xcite or circulating current loops@xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "neutron scattering  @xcite and nernst effect  @xcite measurements on ybco as well as si - stm on bscco  @xcite point towards an electronic nematic state .",
    "all these states retain the translational symmetry of the underlying crystal and can thus naturally be described by breaking intra - unit - cell ( iuc ) symmetries .",
    "hence , identifying mechanisms for these symmetry - breaking possibilities and understanding their competition is crucial for understanding the nature of the pseudogap phase .",
    "theoretical investigations of translationally - invariant iuc order have so far been focussing on one particular ordering at a time within simplified models each aimed at the ordering of interest .",
    "nematic and nematic - spin - nematic order have only been studied in one - band models@xcite or in the extreme limit of infinite interactions@xcite .",
    "loop currents , being more dependent on an iuc picture , have been studied in a mean - field picture with additional assumptions@xcite or numerically on small clusters or ladders@xcite .    here , we aim at a comprehensive investigation of iuc - ordering possibilities suggested by recent experiments .",
    "a theoretical description of intra - unit - cell order should be based on a microscopic model that allows for structures within the unit - cell .",
    "we thus start from a three - band model for the cuo@xmath1 plane , the so - called emery model@xcite , and consider various on - site and nearest - neighbor ( nn ) interactions ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : unitcell ] ) .",
    "we analyze three distinct iuc orders : nematic , nematic - spin - nematic , and loop currents .",
    "these phases can be distinguished by the respective symmetries they break , both of the point group @xmath2 and time reversal , as is summarized in tab .",
    "[ tab : sym ] . for simplicity , only fourfold rotations , inversion , time reversal and combinations of these are shown . within a self - consistent mean - field scheme we analyze and compare the origins of these phases and compare the influence of the different model parameters on them .",
    "in addition , we show how the o - o on - site and nn interactions result in effective interactions of @xmath3 symmetry in one - band models , thus naturally leading to nematic or nematic - spin - nematic order .",
    ".the broken symmetries distinguishing the different iuc orderings with @xmath4 denoting symmetries broken in the respective phase . for simplicity ,",
    "we restrict the table to the fourfold rotation @xmath5 , the inversion @xmath6 , time - reversal operation @xmath7 as well as combinations thereof . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "a comment on the magnitude of the interactions necessary found here is in order : the energy scale of the pseudogap phase in the cuprates is of order 100 kelvin . for any of the above phases to reach to such high temperatures ,",
    "unrealistically large interactions are needed within our mean - field calculation .",
    "looking at the nematic phase for example and taking @xmath8 , @xmath9 needs to be of order @xmath10 as can be deduced from fig .",
    "[ fig : tcvpp](a ) . also , increasing the cu on - site interaction strength @xmath11 to enter a nematic phase leads to unphysically large values .",
    "for the nematic - spin - nematic phase , the respective interactions need to be even larger as can be seen in fig .  [",
    "fig : upc ] . finally , for the loop - current phase , we deduce values for the critical interaction strengths from fig .",
    "[ fig : varma ] , that are much higher than realistically expected . however , the aim of our analysis is not to answer whether this phases exist in the cuprates - a mean - field analysis would certainly not be the appropriate approach for such a task - but to analyze this different iuc orderings within the same framework .",
    "we can also draw some conclusions about the competition or coexistence of the iuc - ordered phases from our calculation . even though symmetry allows the two orders discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : static ] , the nematic and the nematic - spin - nematic , to coexist independently , they are promoted by different interactions , @xmath9 and @xmath12 , each hurting the respective other phase .",
    "in addition , both depend in a mean - field picture on the presence of a van hove singularity .",
    "even if the interactions were tuned in a way as to allow for both instabilities , having one kind of order removes already the high density of states from the fermi level , thus preventing the system from entering the other phase .",
    "in contrast , the loop - current phase is promoted by the same interaction as the nematic phase , @xmath9 , and does not depend on a high density of states at the fermi level .",
    "a deformation of the fermi surface has thus no direct influence on this instability .",
    "being of different symmetry , a nematic and a loop - current phase can therefore coexist in general independently .",
    "the mean - field analysis and our exploration of the rich phase space of the three - band emery model in this paper can serve as a stepping stone towards more sophisticated calculations of iuc orders and their interdependence .",
    "for instance , extension of the calculations in  @xcite to the case of three bands might provide further valuable insight .",
    "in particular , investigation of the interplay between these iuc orders and superconductivity in a genuinely strong coupling approach will be of great interest . as superconductivity can not be accessed within mean - field theory with purely repulsive interactions , we left out this important issue altogether  .",
    "the possible coexistence of nematic and loop - current phases we find in this work is interesting in light of experimental observations of both iuc nematic order@xcite and iuc staggered magnetism in underdoped ybco@xcite . on the other hand , in hg - compounds",
    "only iuc staggered magnetism has been observed@xcite . in order to test whether coexistence of both orders is a generic feature , we propose a measurement of anisotropy in nernst effect in the presence of a symmetry breaking field on hg - compounds .",
    "for example , an in - plane magnetic field could align possibly existing nematic domains in hg - compounds which is tetragonal otherwise , much in the same manner as in sr@xmath13ru@xmath1o@xmath14@xcite .",
    "in this appendix , the case @xmath15 is investigated for @xmath16 for which we write the hamiltonian   as @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 with @xmath20 the unperturbed hamiltonian can straight - forwardly be diagonalized yielding the eigenenergies @xmath21 and @xmath22 with the corresponding states @xmath23 given by the eigenvectors @xmath24 in these equations , we introduced @xmath25 , @xmath26 with @xmath27 and @xmath28 for @xmath29 , we can thus express the eigenenergies in powers of @xmath30 in a text - book perturbation - theory expansion , @xmath31 with @xmath32 and @xmath33 the derivatives appearing in the self - consistency equations  , and can thus all be expressed analytically through eq .",
    "yielding @xmath34 evaluating the derivatives for the oxygen hole density in eq .  , we find using @xmath35 using these derivatives , the self - consistency equation for the oxygen occupation number simplifies to @xmath36",
