    "studies of rr lyrae stars in the milky way globular clusters reveal what is traditionally known as the oosterhoff dichotomy ; the tendency for these clusters to be either oosterhoff i ( oo - i ) or oosterhoff ii ( oo - ii ) objects with a relatively clear zone of avoidance between these two groups .",
    "the left panel of figure 5 in @xcite strikingly illustrates the oosterhoff dichotomy in a plot of the average period of the rr lyrae stars of bailey type ab ( rrab ) versus cluster metallicity for milky way globular clusters .",
    "when one looks at the nearby dwarf galaxies and their globular clusters , one does not see an oosterhoff dichotomy as these objects fall not only into the oo - i / ii groups but also into the gap between those two groups .",
    "in fact the distribution of these extragalactic objects seems to peak in the zone of avoidance @xcite .",
    "the existence of oosterhoff - intermediate objects ( oo - int ) , objects that fall into the zone of avoidance , in the nearby dwarf galaxies poses a significant challenge to the hierarchical merger model for the formation of the milky way halo .",
    "the lack of oo - int clusters in the halo means that the objects that were accreted to form the halo could not have had properties entirely like the present - day nearby dwarf galaxies .",
    "this is the first of a series of papers focusing on variable stars in globular clusters in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) .",
    "the goal of this series is to better understand how the rr lyrae stars in oo - int systems compare to those in oo - i / ii systems .",
    "the lmc is an ideal place for this study because of the large number of oo - int clusters that it contains @xcite ; of the twelve lmc globular clusters that contain at least @xmath10 rrab variables , five of these clusters are oo - int ( ngc 1466 , ngc 1853 , ngc 2019 , ngc 2210 , and ngc 2257 ) . in this paper",
    "we identify , classify , and discuss the variable stars found in the lmc globular cluster ngc 1466 .",
    "subsequent papers will focus on the variable stars in other lmc globular clusters .",
    "ngc 1466 is an old globular cluster that is located relatively far from the center of the lmc .",
    "it has a metal abundance of [ fe / h ] @xmath11 , see discussion in section [ sec : abprop ] , and is not very reddened , e(b - v ) = @xmath12 @xcite . @xcite used color - magnitude diagrams obtained with the hubble space telescope to determine that the age of ngc 1466 is within @xmath6 gyr of the ages of the milky way globular clusters m3 ( ngc 5272 ) and m92 ( ngc 6341 ) .",
    "ngc 1466 features a well - populated horizontal branch that extends through the instability strip ( see figure 5 in walker 1992 ) ; thus it is expected to contain a significant number of rr lyrae stars .",
    "rr lyrae stars were first found in ngc 1466 by @xcite , and additional rr lyrae were discovered by @xcite .",
    "the most recent study of variables in ngc 1466 was conducted by @xcite , who found @xmath13 rr lyrae stars ; @xmath14 rrab and @xmath15 rrc stars . due to the density of unresolved stars in the cluster core , walker did not perform photometry of stars within a radius of @xmath16 arcsec from the cluster center , suggesting that there are probably additional rr lyrae stars that could not be detected in his study .",
    "the core radius of ngc 1466 is @xmath17 arcsec , as measured by @xcite using images from the hubble space telescope , which is entirely within the region of the cluster where walker was unable to perform photometry .",
    "advances in instrument resolution and image - subtraction techniques now make it easier for us to search for variable stars in more crowded regions .    in this paper",
    "we present the results of a new search for variable stars in ngc 1466 and use the rr lyrae in ngc 1466 to confirm the distance modulus and oosterhoff classification of the cluster .",
    "we also present fourier fits to the light curves and derive physical properties for the stars from these fits .",
    "a total of @xmath18 @xmath19 and @xmath20 @xmath21 images of ngc 1466 were obtained using the soi imager on the soar @xmath22-m telescope in february and december of 2008 .",
    "an additional @xmath23 @xmath19 and @xmath24 @xmath21 images were obtained using andicam on the smarts @xmath25-m telescope operated by the smarts consortium from september 2006 to january 2007 .",
    "this represents a larger data set than the 35 bv pairs obtained by @xcite .",
    "exposure times for the soar observations were between @xmath3s and @xmath26s for @xmath19 and between @xmath27s and @xmath26s for @xmath21 , but were usually @xmath28s and @xmath29s for the @xmath19 and @xmath21 observations , respectively .",
    "smarts exposures were @xmath30s for each filter .",
    "the images from both telescopes were bias subtracted and flat - field corrected using iraf . as noted in @xcite , ngc 1466 is located near two very bright stars which create problems with scattered light across some of the images , especially in many of the images obtained with the smarts telescope .",
    "we used the procedure described in detail by @xcite to remove this scattered light ; this was the same method employed by @xcite .",
    "peter stetson s daophot ii / allstar packages @xcite were used to locate , measure , and subtract stars from all images ; this produced images that only contained the sky background and scattered light .",
    "the subtracted images were then smoothed using a @xmath18x@xmath18 pixel median filter . the average sky level in the smoothed images was determined and then the smoothed images were subtracted from the original images , removing the background light .",
    "the average sky values were then added back into the new images , creating a final set of images with a constant sky background .",
    "stetson s daophot ii / allstar packages were run on the new set of images in to order obtain instrumental magnitudes for each star .",
    "observations of the landolt standard fields pg0231 , ru149 , sa95 , and sa98 @xcite were used to determine an initial transformation from instrumental magnitudes to the standard system .",
    "@xcite showed walker s photometry to be in good agreement with hst / wfpc2 observations of ngc 1466 , after these observations were transformed from the on - board hst system to the standard johnson - cousins system .",
    "we compared the results of our initial transformation to the standard system using walker s photometry of isolated non - variable stars across a range of brightnesses within the cluster .",
    "we made small corrections to the zero points and color terms from our initial transformation equations in order to achieve better agreement with walker s photometry .",
    "this produced an average difference between our data and walker s of @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "this is a similar level of scatter to that obtained by @xcite in their comparison with walker .",
    "the profile fitting photometry used in daophot ii / allstar does not work well in very crowded regions , such as the center of ngc 1466 . in order to locate variable stars in this region , the soar data on the cluster center was also searched using the isisv2.2 image subtraction program @xcite .",
    "the original images were used for the isis processing as the scattered light is less of a problem when using image subtraction techniques .",
    "the light curves produced by isis are in relative fluxes .",
    "there is a method to transform the relative fluxes obtained by isis into magnitudes in the standard system by using daophot to obtain magnitudes of the stars in the reference frame created by isis @xcite .",
    "four of our variable stars were found only by isis ( v@xmath33 , v@xmath34 , v@xmath35 , v@xmath27 ) .",
    "these stars are located deep in the cluster center and are too crowded to obtain accurate profile fitting photometry , even in the reference image .",
    "these four light curves are shown in relative fluxes ; for the other variables we present their light curves obtained from daophot ii / allstar .",
    "figure [ cmd ] shows our cmd for ngc 1466 .",
    "the cluster features a well - defined horizontal branch ( hb ) that extends across the instability strip .",
    "the majority of the hb stars are blue , with few hb stars located redward of the instability strip . as was noted by @xcite",
    ", the rr lyrae stars appear to be less luminous than the blue hb stars near the blue edge of the instability strip .",
    "as can be seen in the figure , there are some non - variable stars in the instability strip region .",
    "these are due to either poor photometry due to blending in the cluster center or are line - of - sight field stars .",
    "we used the @xmath19-band time series , which had more phase points than the @xmath21-band one , to identify candidate variable stars using peter stetson s allframe / trial package @xcite .",
    "period searches on the candidate variables were carried out using supersmoother @xcite , period04 @xcite , and a discrete fourier transform @xcite as implemented in the peranso software suite .",
    "this produced light curves which were then examined by eye to confirm the reality of each variable star candidate .",
    "light curves of potential rr lyrae stars were then fit to template light curves @xcite and checked by eye in order to confirm variable classification and period .",
    "resulting primary periods are typically good to @xmath36 or @xmath37 days while errors for the secondary periods of rrd stars are slightly worse but on the same order of magnitude .",
    "a similar search of the light curves produced with isis was done to find additional variables .",

    "the bottom panel is the same as the top panel but using the @xmath21-band amplitudes.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0% ]    another indicator of oosterhoff status is the position of the rr lyrae stars in the bailey period - amplitude diagram .",

    "many are located between the oo - i and o - ii loci , which is consistent with an oo - int object .",
    "however , there is a significant number of rrab stars that are clustered around the oo - i line , which is more typical for an oo - i object .",
    "the rrc stars fall almost exclusively between the reference lines , as is expected for an oo - int object .",
    "we found an hb type of @xmath168 for ngc 1466 .",
    "this was determined using the stars in an annulus with an inner radius of @xmath98 arcsec and an outer radius of @xmath74 arcsec ; this represented a region for which we felt our sample of the hb stars was complete .",
    "this hb type , combined with the metallicity of @xmath134}\\approx-1.60 $ ] that we obtained from the rr lyrae stars , places the cluster outside of the `` forbidden region '' where oo - int objects tend to fall in the hb type - metallicity diagram ( fig . 7 in catelan 2009 ) .",
    "if one used a lower metallicity similar to what was favored by @xcite or @xcite , ngc 1466 would be located much closer to the forbidden region .",
    "a lower metallicity would also be consistent with the theoretical predictions by @xcite for oo - int behavior , whereas the higher metallicity would indicate an hb morphology that is too red with respect to the predictions of the models ( see fig .",

    "figure [ hist ] shows the distribution of both the raw and the fundamentalized periods for the rr lyrae stars in ngc 1466 .",
    "a sharply peaked fundamentalized period distribution is not present , in contrast to what was found in @xcite in a number of ooi and ooii clusters .",
    "the distribution of the raw periods for the rrab stars displays two peaks , a broad one around @xmath169 days and a sharper peak at @xmath170 days .",
    "this is similar to the distribution seen in ngc 1835 @xcite although the shorter period peak for ngc 1466 is broader and its longer period peak occurs at a slightly longer period .",
    "soszyski suggested that this two - peaked distribution may be an indicator of a sum of oo - i and oo - ii characteristics , but our bailey diagram shows no evidence of an oo - ii population .",
    "tables 7 and 8 in @xcite show the mean physical parameters for rrc and rrab stars , respectively , in a selection of previously studied globular clusters .",
    "the parameters that we calculated for ngc 1466 fall between those for oo - i and oo - ii clusters , consistent with ngc 1466 having an oo - int classification .",
    "a more thorough comparison of the physical parameters for the rr lyrae stars in ngc 1466 and the other globular clusters in our study will be the subject of a future paper in this series .",
    "a photometric study of the lmc globular cluster ngc 1466 was conducted in order to locate variable stars , with a specific interest in the cluster s rr lyrae population . @xmath39 rr lyrae stars and @xmath6 candidate rr lyrae were found .",
    "we discovered @xmath8 rr lyrae stars which were not found by @xcite , previously the most extensive search for rr lyrae in ngc 1466 .",
    "of our @xmath39 rr lyrae stars , @xmath5 are rrd stars , making this the first time double - mode rr lyrae stars were found in this cluster .    a candidate anomalous cepheid variable was found in ngc 1466 .",
    "acs are rare in globular clusters , having previously been found only in ngc 1786 , ngc 5466 , and @xmath171 cen @xcite .",
    "interestingly , these three systems are ooii , though this of course may be just a coincidence , particularly since it is believed that acs in globular clusters should be the progeny of blue straggler stars ( e.g. , sills et al . 2009 and references therein ) , which in principle should not be related to the oosterhoff dichotomy .",
    "we performed fourier analysis on the rr lyrae light curves and used the resulting fourier parameters to calculate physical properties for the stars which will be compared to the properties of rr lyrae stars in other clusters in a future paper in this series .",
    "we obtained a reddening - corrected distance modulus of @xmath172 from the rrab and rrc stars .",
    "the average periods for the rrab and rrc stars and the ratio of number of rrc to total number of rr lyrae all suggest an oosterhoff - intermediate classification for ngc 1466 .",
    "the position of the rrab stars in the bailey diagram provides for a less clear oosterhoff determination .",
