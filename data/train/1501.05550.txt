    "the fe - pt alloys constitute a very important class of materials because of their various interesting physical properties and high application potential .",
    "crystallographically , they can be either chemically disordered fcc or ordered fcc / fct structures . according to the fe - pt phase diagram @xcite , at high temperatures an fcc solid solution of the components is observed .",
    "with decreasing temperature this disordered a1-type structure exhibits order - disorder transformations leading to three different ordered phases with structures and physical properties depending on the chemical composition .    at temperatures below 1570  k",
    ", the tetragonal l1@xmath3 structure is formed for the almost equiatomic concentration region from approximately 35 to 55 atomic percent of pt . in fe - pt alloys with lower or larger pt concentration ,",
    "the formation of the stable cubic l1@xmath4 structures , fept@xmath0 and fe@xmath0pt , is observed at temperatures below 1120  k and 1620  k , respectively .",
    "moreover , in the region below 670  k the fe - rich alloys show the anomalously low thermal expansion coefficient ( invar effect)@xcite and undergo a martensitic transformation.@xcite the martensite struture depends on the fe concentration and the chemical order . in the ordered state , the l1@xmath4 fe@xmath0pt phase is stable down to approximately 60 k , whereas the disordered fe@xmath0pt starts to transform to a bcc martensite already at room temperature . as a precursor of the distorted phase",
    ", the softening of the transverse acoustic phonons is observed in the [ 110 ] direction , @xcite however , the role of the soft mode in the mechanism of the structural transition is not fully explained .",
    "the ordered equiatomic fept alloy with the l1@xmath3 structure is composed of alternately stacked layers of fe and pt atoms along c - axis ( aucu - type structure with the @xmath5 space group ) .",
    "this structure exhibits ferromagnetic ( fm ) order below t@xmath6 = 750 k. the fept alloys with stoichiometry around 1:3 can form a cubic phase fe@xmath0pt or fept@xmath0 ( with the @xmath7 symmetry ) . in fe@xmath0pt ( or fept@xmath0 ) , the fe ( pt ) atoms occupy the cube corners and the pt ( fe ) atoms occupy the face - center positions .    in fe - pt alloys , both fe and pt",
    "atoms carry magnetic moments , however , the fe moments are significantly larger .",
    "the orientation of local magnetic moments depends on the fe and pt concentrations , arrangement of alloy components and temperature . the disordered a1 phase of fept and fept@xmath0 is ferromagnetically ordered in contrast to the fe@xmath0pt disordered alloy that is paramagnetic .",
    "differently , the ordered fept@xmath0 alloy is paramagnetic while fept and fe@xmath0pt are ferromagnetic .",
    "moreover , below 170 k , fept@xmath0 is antiferromagnetic ( afm - i phase ) with wavevector @xmath8 .",
    "subsequently , below 80 k it undergoes a second phase transition into an afm - ii phase with wavevector @xmath9 .",
    "it has been discussed , that the latter afm state is metastable and is probably induced by antiphase boundaries or small compositional variations .",
    "such a wide variation of magnetic structures in the fept alloys is evidently a consequence of different atomic configurations around fe atoms , which in turn , have a considerable effect on the electronic structure of these alloys .",
    "differences in crystal structures and chemical compositions influence also lattice dynamics of fe - pt alloys .",
    "experimentally , the knowledge on phonon spectra for fe - pt alloys comes from fitting the phonon dispersion relations obtained from the inelastic neutron scattering ( ins ) @xcite to the born - von karman model and from nuclear inelastic scattering ( nis ) measurements @xcite .",
    "the latter technique provides information on the fe contribution to the phonon density of states ( pdos ) , and it has been applied to ordered and disorder polycrystalline fe - pt alloys , @xcite thin films , @xcite as well as to nanoclusters @xcite .",
    "the theoretical studies based on _ ab initio _ methods enabled calculation of the phonon dispersion relations of fe / pt multilayers @xcite , estimation of the magnetic anisotropy of fe / pt(001 ) and pt / fe / pt(001 ) systems @xcite , identification of the structural and magnetic phases in fept surface alloys @xcite , determination of the partial fe pdos in ordered fept @xcite and investigation of the soft mode behavior in fe@xmath0pt .",
    "@xcite for fept , the first - principles results were compared with the partial fe pdos measured by the nis method .",
    "@xcite nevertheless , no direct comparison between the calculated and measured dispersion curves has been performed for any of the fe - pt alloys .    in this paper",
    ", we present the results of _ ab initio _ studies on the structural , magnetic , and dynamical properties for three ordered alloys : fept@xmath0 , fept , and fe@xmath0pt .",
    "the obtained results are confronted with previously measured phonon dispersion curves and pdoss as well as new nis measurements performed on fe@xmath0pt and fept@xmath0 thin films .",
    "using the same formalism and software for all these systems allows us to make detailed comparison and discuss the differences in lattice dynamics of different fe - pt alloys that otherwise would not be possible .",
    "in particular , we are studying the influence of local atomic configurations and magnetic order on phonon spectra .",
    "for fe@xmath0pt , we analyse the low - symmetry phase obtained from the soft mode , and compare the calculated phonon spectra with the low - temperature measurements .    the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec2 ] , the structure , magnetic ordering , and dynamical properties of room temperature phases of ordered fe - pt alloys are analysed and compared with the experimental data . in section [ sec3 ] , the detailed analysis of the anisotropy of phonon density of states and the low - temperature phases of fept@xmath0 and fe@xmath0pt is presented .",
    "section [ sec4 ] concludes the results .",
    "three ordered phases of fe - pt alloys were modelled by imposing the symmetry restrictions of the @xmath5 ( l1@xmath3 ) and @xmath7 ( l1@xmath4 ) space groups on the crystal structure .",

    "the agreement between the theory and experiment is much better for the tetragonal phase measured at 75  k than for the cubic one at room temperature . the positions and intensities of three peaks observed in the experiment",
    "correspond very well to those found theoretically .",
    "also , the shoulder at about 2 thz originating from the soft mode is very well reproduced in calculations .",
    "it clearly demonstrates that the tetragonal structure derived from the soft - mode is an important constituent of the low - temperature phase .",
    "it may be related to static precursors of the martensitic phase observed by x - ray , electron , and neutron diffraction and manifested as tetragonally strained structures growing in the austenite phase approaching the structural transformation @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that this type of crystal deformation may be driven by the electron - phonon interaction . according to previous theoretical studies on fe@xmath0pt , the condensation of the soft - mode opens a pseudogap in the density of states and leads to the extended reconstruction of the fermi surface due to nesting effects @xcite",

    "to complete and systematize the understanding of the ordered fe@xmath0pt , fept , and fept@xmath0 alloys , first - principles studies of their structural , magnetic , and dynamical properties have been performed .",
    "the obtained results have been compared with existing experimental data supplemented by the new partial fe pdos measured in thin fe - pt films of l1@xmath4 structure using the nuclear inelastic scattering technique .",
    "the calculations involve the room temperature as well as the low temperature phases of fe - pt alloys .",
    "\\(i ) the phonon dispersion relations calculated for fept and fept@xmath0 show very good agreement with inelastic neutron scattering data measured at room temperature .",
    "the paramagnetic fept@xmath0 systems were modelled using static fm and afm arrangements of local magnetic moments on fe atoms and both approaches reproduce the experimental data much better than the calculations for the non - magnetic state . in the cubic l1@xmath4 structure of fe@xmath0pt , the observed ta@xmath1 soft mode at the @xmath13 point of the brillouin zone leads to some discrepancy between the calculated and measured phonon branches .",
    "\\(ii ) on the basis of the analysis of different variants of calculated partial pdoss , the experimentally unobservable anisotropy of some sites or atoms is noticed .",
    "the anisotropy of the partial fe and pt pdoss appears evidently in the tetragonal fept , however , it is also observed for the atomic sites of the tetragonal symmetry in the cubic fe@xmath0pt and fept@xmath0 . for these cubic structures the pdos asymmetry , which is not important for a bulk material , can influence the properties of nanocrystals or surfaces .",
    "\\(iii ) the fe projected pdos calculated for the fe@xmath0pt and fept@xmath0 cubic structures were compared with new nuclear inelastic scattering measurements for thin films at room temperature . for fept@xmath0 , we found very good agreement between experiment and theory although additional broadening of the measured pdos is observed .",
    "the soft - mode behavior observed in fe@xmath0pt generates some disagreement between the theoretical and experimental pdos , mainly in the low - frequency region .",
    "the chemical ordering in conventional bulk fe - pt alloys becomes very slow at low temperatures making the experimental studies of the low temperature structures very difficult .",
    "nevertheless , this region was extensively investigated for the fe - rich compositions , as these alloys show the invar effect and undergo a martensitic transformation , and for the pt - rich compositions , where the paramagnetic - antiferromagnetic phase transition is observed .",
    "the results of our research on the low - temperature phases of fe@xmath0pt and fept@xmath0 can be summarized as follows :    \\(i ) in fept@xmath0 , the crystal structure parameters , magnetic moments , and total energies were determined for two antiferromagnetic arrangements that induce the tetragonal distortion ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "the ground state energies of afm - i and afm - ii configurations are nearly the same and slightly lower than the energies of the hypothetical fm and afm phases .",
    "the magnitude of magnetic moments calculated on fe atoms is about 3.3 @xmath14 for afm - i and afm - ii .",
    "in contrast , the measured magnetic moment of afm - ii phase is 2  @xmath14 and is equal to the value in disordered fe - pt alloys .",
    "it proves the previous findings describing the afm - ii phase observed in fept@xmath0 as formed by antiphase domains .",
    "our calculations showed that any antiferromagnetic structure is energetically favoured and the changes induced by these two magnetic configurations affect very weakly the lattice dynamical properties leading to very similar phonon spectra .",
    "\\(ii ) in fe@xmath0pt , the low - symmetry tetragonal structure ( @xmath2 ) has been derived using the soft - mode polarization vector .",
    "the energy of this structure is lower than the energies of two tetragonal fct phases ( @xmath5 ) obtained by uniaxial stress deformation .",
    "a few mev per unit cell differences between them seems to be irrelevant for the stabilization of the low temperature phase , however , it was shown that the dispersion curves and the fe projected pdos calculated for the @xmath2 symmetry agree very well with the inelastic neutron scattering and nuclear inelastic scattering ( at @xmath15  k ) data , respectively .",
    "it shows that although the martensitic phase transition is not a group - subgroup transformation , the tetragonal structure derived from the soft mode plays an important role in this transition as the main constituent of the low - temperature phase of fe@xmath0pt .",
    "this is also the case in the martensitic transformation of niti alloys where the soft mode of the austenite phase leads to either an intermediate incommensurate phase locked into a trigonal r phase or to an orthorhombic phase , which in turn , creates a low - frequency mode and favours the monoclinic martensitic phase .",
