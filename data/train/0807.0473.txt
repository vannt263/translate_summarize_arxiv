    "massive stars end their lives in various ways , as governed by their mass , composition , angular momentum and whether or not they are interacting with a companion star ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the most massive stars loose their outer layers through winds whose strength strongly depend on the metallicity of the star ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "these stripped stars explode as supernovae ( sne ) type ib ( sn ib ) if they have lost their hydrogen envelope or as sne type ic ( sn ic ) if they have also lost their he envelope .",
    "if the star is also rapidly rotating , it is believed that the star might even produce a gamma - ray burst ( grb ) @xcite .",
    "sne ib / c are much rarer than sne ii , which are produced by stars with masses of 8 to 40 m@xmath2 , whereas sne ib / cs are assumed to require zero age main sequence ( zams ) masses of @xmath3 35 m@xmath2 for non - rotating stars @xcite .",
    "grbs are even less common than sne ic which is in line with the general picture that grb progenitors require some special conditions to produce a grb .    only for sne ii",
    "has it been possible to identify the progenitor star - which turned out to be yellow , red or blue giants with masses of around 8  20 m@xmath2 , e.g. sn 1987a @xcite , sn 2002ov @xcite , sn 2004a @xcite and sn 2006gl @xcite .",
    "furthermore , several detections have been made using preexplosion imaging from the _ hst _ archive ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "sne ib / c have so far evaded an identification with a progenitor star @xcite .",
    "this is also the case for grbs which most often occur at distances that do not even allow us to resolve their host galaxies .",
    "when the progenitor can not be directly identified , studying the environment can provide important information about what kind of star exploded .",
    "spatially resolved photometric studies of the sites of different types of sne show that sne type ii trace the light of their host galaxies while grbs are more concentrated towards bright regions @xcite and that sne type ib , ic and grbs appear to be differently distributed within their hosts @xcite .",
    "spectroscopic investigations show that the broadlined sne ic which are not connected to grbs are found at sites with higher metallicities than those that are connected to grbs @xcite . a spatially resolved study of the host of one long - duration grb which was not connected to a sn also showed a low metallicity in comparison to the rest of the host galaxy @xcite .",
    "long duration grbs have been found to be associated with broadlined sne ic .",
    "there are four spectroscopically confirmed cases so far , namely grb980425 @xcite , grb030329 @xcite , grb031203 @xcite and grb060218 @xcite . for all other nearby long grbs up to 2006 where",
    "a sn could have been observed , additional light from the sn component was found in the late time lightcurves ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "grbs therefore offer a unique opportunity to observe a sn from the very onset of the explosion , as indicated by the prompt emission from the grb .",
    "the connection between grbs and broadlined sne ic , however , had to be revised in 2006 when two long - duration grbs were found not to show any sign of an associated sn @xcite .",
    "one important supernova that recently caught the attention of the community is sn 2008d which was associated with an x - ray transient ( xt ) @xcite .",
    "this supernova was serendipitously detected while the xrt instrument onboard the _ _ s__wift satellite @xcite observed another supernova , sn 2007uy , in the same galaxy . whether this prompt xt originated from a weak grb - like event or if it was due to the shock breakout from the star is still under debate @xcite .",
    "the x - ray emission , however , is clearly associated with the onset of the explosion , and consequently sn 2008d was one of the earliest observed sne .",
    "the sn spectrum evolved from a smooth spectrum with small undulations characteristic of a high - velocity ejecta into a typical sn ib @xcite .",
    "also the host galaxy of this supernova , ngc 2770 , has attracted some attention as it produced three sne within the last 9 years , sne 1999eh , 2007uy and 2008d .",
    "intriguingly , all three were stripped envelope core - collapse sne ib .    in this paper , we present a study on the local properties at the sn sites as well as of other regions in ngc 2770 with longslit spectroscopy and compare the host itself with a sample of other supernova producing galaxies .",
    "we want to investigate if the occurrence of three recent sne ib can be explained by some physical properties of the host galaxy . in section 2",
    "we present the observations and data reduction of the spectra , section 3 studies the global properties of ngc 2770 and properties derived from modeling the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) . in section 4 we analyze the different regions in the host in terms of metallicity , extinction and star formation rate ( sfr ) .",
    "section 5 compares ngc 2770 to a sample of other nearby galaxies with several recent sne and discuss the probability to find three sne ib in a galaxy within nine years .",

    "this corresponds to 0.13 kpc per arcsecond and we use a distance of 27 mpc to ngc 2700 .",
    "we carried out optical spectroscopy using the fors2 spectrograph at the vlt on jan . 11.31 , 2008 .",
    "a 10 arcsec wide slit together with the 300v grism provided a resolution of 11  .",
    "the slit covered the site of sn 2008d as well as some outer parts of the galaxy .",

    "the three not spectra were obtained at three different slit positions ( see also fig . [ ngc2770:slitmetallicities ] ) .",
    "the first included the positions of sne 2008d and 2007uy which were also detected in the spectrum .",
    "the second one was placed along the major axis of the galaxy and the last one included the positions of sne 2008d and 1999eh , where the latter one had already faded . on jan . 15.21 , we also obtained one 600s spectrum of the nearby galaxy ngc 2770b with alfosc @xcite .",
    "reduction and flux calibration of the spectra were done using standard tasks in iraf . for the flux calibration we used the standard stars hd 19445 , bd+75325 and bd+332642 for the alfosc spectra and gd 108 for the fors2 spectrum . from the longslit spectra",
    "we then extracted traces of equal sizes at the positions of the sne and other hii regions in the galaxy ( see section [ ngc2770:parts ] )    furthermore , we obtained high - resolution echelle spectra of sn 2008d with uves @xcite at the vlt on jan .",

    "furthermore , we obtained the infrared and radio fluxes from @xcite and @xcite reported in the nasa extragalactic database ( ned ) .",
    "these data were used to fit the broad band spectral energy distribution ( sed ) with templates from the grasil code @xcite .    in the grasil code each sed template is calculated by the following procedure . at the first stage an initial gas reservoir , infalling gas rate and star formation history are assumed and then at given time the emission of the resulting stellar population is summed up .",

    "sfr , sn rate , stellar , dust , gas and total baryonic masses are given as output from grasil for the best - fiting template .",
    "the infrared luminosity was obtained by integrating the sed over the range of @xmath13 m .",
    "the average extinction ( outside of the molecular clouds ) was calculated as : @xmath14 ( @xmath15-band starlight extinguished by molecular clouds only / @xmath15-band starlight observed , see @xcite ) .",
    "this parameter describes the extinction averaged throughout the galaxy as opposed to the line - of - sight extinction derived from optical grb afterglows .",
    "@xmath16 was calculated comparing the extinction in the @xmath15- and @xmath17-bands : @xmath18 .    the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of ngc 2770 is well represented by an average model composed of the spiral sc ( ngc 6946 ) and sb galaxies , taken from @xcite . from the sed fit ( see fig",
    ".  [ ngc2770:sed ] ) we derive a star - formation rate ( sfr ) of @xmath19m@xmath2 yr@xmath5 and a stellar mass of 2.1@xmath1210@xmath20 m@xmath2 ( see * ? ? ? * for details on how these are derived from the seds ) .",
    "the resulting specific star - formation rate ( ssfr ) is 0.05 gyr@xmath5 .",
    "the sfrs derived from different methods ( radio , ir , uv , sed modelling ) differ by about a factor of 2 .",
    "this is not surprising since the uv sfr estimate is affected by extinction and the different methods trace different parts of sf in the galaxy .",
    "still , the values indicate that the sfr is not particularly high in ngc 2770 .",
    "the sfr in radio is also directly connected to the supernova rate ( snr ) as the nonthermal radio flux is produced by relativistic electrons accelerated in the sn shocks .",
    "also the supernova rate ( snr ) both from radio data and the sed modelling is therefore rather low with 0.010.02 sne yr@xmath5 which is comparable to the snr of the milky way ( mw ) .",
    "in addition to the sed fit , we also searched the literature for global measurements and properties of ngc 2770 .",
    "those , together with the sed outputs , are presented in table [ ngc2770:globalprop ] .    ]      in order to quantify to what extent the properties of ngc 2770 are similar to other galaxies we compare the global properties of ngc 2770 with a sample of more than 100 nearby spiral galaxies from @xcite which also includes ngc 2770 .",
    "this sample is based on two hi surveys of spiral and irregular galaxies with the westerbork synthesis radio telescope .",
    "we then determine the median and mean values of a number of properties and compare that with the values derived for ngc 2770 .",
    "the mean in this sample is dominated by a few extreme outliers in the sample , therefore , we prefer to take the median value for comparison .",
    "we then conclude the following :    * the hi surface density is one of the highest in the sample ( median : 3.65 m@xmath2/pc@xmath21 , maximum : 8.05 m@xmath2/pc@xmath21 , ngc 2770 : 4.99 m@xmath2/pc@xmath21 ) .",
    "* the hi mass is also above average ( median : 3.5 @xmath1210@xmath22 m@xmath2 , ngc 2770 : 7@xmath1210@xmath22 m@xmath2 ) . *",
    "the total mass is above the median but slightly below the mean , however this is dominated by some very massive galaxies ( median : log m@xmath23=7.8 m@xmath2 , ngc 2770 : log m@xmath23=11.38 m@xmath2 ) . *",
    "the ratio of the gas mass to the blue ( @xmath17-band ) luminosity is close to average ( median : 0.26 m@xmath2/l@xmath24 , ngc 2770 : 0.24 m@xmath2/l@xmath24 ) . * the ratio of the gas mass to the near - ir ( @xmath25-band ) luminosity is slightly above average ( median : 0.31 m@xmath2/l@xmath26 , ngc 2770 : 0.44 m@xmath2/l@xmath26 ) . * the ratio of the gas mass to the total mass is slightly above average ( median : 0.05 , ngc 2770 : 0.06 ) .",
    "this comparison shows that ngc 2770 has more or less average properties within this sample , except for the hi mass .",
    "the rather high gas mass and hi surface density indicate that there is a lot of material present to produce stars",

    "its sfr and snr are around the average of other nearby spiral galaxies and our sample of frequent sn galaxies . *",
    "the only outstanding property of ngc 2770 is its high hi mass which indicates a large reservoir for forming stars .",
    "* the metallicities at the sn sites in ngc 2770 are around 0.5 solar which is similar to the values observed for nearby grb sites , but lower than for broadline sn ic sites .",
    "* almost half of the galaxies with sne ii and ib / c only have one type of sn which is likely connected to the age of the dominant stellar population .",
    "galaxies producing sne ib / cs have a higher devaucouleurs number than those producing sn ii .",
    "* sn and grb hosts seem to be somewhat different in terms of sfrs and masses . *",
    "the probability to detect 3 sne ib in a galaxy is 0.6 to 1.5 % assuming 10,000 monitored galaxies .",
    "it therefore seems to be likely that observing 3 sne ib in ngc 2770 was only a chance coincidence .",
    "ngc 2770 is by no means a special galaxy that would be predestined to produce only stripped - envelope sne .",
    "in fact its properties are not typical for galaxies with ( frequent ) sn ib / c occurrence .",
    "however , it might also imply that the local properties at the sn sites are more important , at least in some galaxies , to produce a certain type of sn than its global properties .",

    "<S> sn 2008d attracted special attention due to the serendipitous discovery of an associated x - ray transient . in this paper , we study the properties of ngc 2770 and specifically the three sn sites to investigate whether this galaxy is in any way peculiar to cause a high frequency of sne ib . </S>",
    "<S> we model the global sed of the galaxy from broadband data and derive a star - formation and sn rate comparable to the values of the milky way . </S>",
    "<S> we further study the galaxy using longslit spectroscopy covering the major axis and the three sn sites . from the spectroscopic study we find subsolar metallicities for the sn sites , a high extinction and a moderate star - formation rate . in a high resolution spectrum </S>",
    "<S> , we also detect diffuse interstellar bands in the line - of - sight towards sn 2008 . </S>",
    "<S> a comparison of ngc 2770 to the global properties of a galaxy sample with high sn occurance ( @xmath0 3 sn in the last 100 years ) suggests that ngc 2770 is not particularly destined to produce such an enhancement of observed sne observed . </S>",
    "<S> its properties are also very different from gamma - ray burst host galaxies . statistical considerations on sn </S>",
    "<S> ib detection rates give a probability of @xmath1 1.5% to find a galaxy with three ib sne detected in 10 years . </S>",
    "<S> the high number of rare ib sne in this galaxy is therefore likely to be a coincidence rather than special properties of the galaxy itself . </S>",
    "<S> ngc 2770 has a small irregular companion , ngc 2770b , which is highly starforming , has a very low mass and one of the lowest metallicities detected in the nearby universe as derived from longslit spectroscopy . in the most metal poor part , we even detect wolf - rayet features , against the current models of wr stars which require high metallicities . </S>"
