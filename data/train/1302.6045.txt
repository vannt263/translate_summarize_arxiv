    "in this section , we give the definition of an ordered exchange graph and introduce some basic notions on general categories , derived categories , quivers with potential and their ginzburg dg algebras as well as jacobian algebras .      a central notion in cluster theory",
    "is that of an ordered exchange graph , which we formalize for the purpose of this article as follows :      consider a set @xmath20 with a _",
    "compatibility relation _",
    "@xmath21 , that is , @xmath21 is reflexive and symmetric .",
    "we say that two elements @xmath22 and @xmath23 of @xmath20 are _ compatible _ if @xmath24 .",
    "assume the following conditions :    * all maximal subsets of pairwise compatible elements , the _ clusters _",
    ", are finite and have the same cardinality , say @xmath25 ; * any subset of @xmath26 pairwise compatible elements is contained in precisely two clusters .",
    "we then define an _ exchange graph _ to be the graph whose vertices are the clusters and where two clusters are joined by an edge precisely when their intersection has cardinality @xmath26 .",
    "we refer to the edges of an exchange graph as _ mutations _ , and we use the same terminology for any graph which is isomorphic to an exchange graph .",
    "note that all those graphs are @xmath27regular .",
    "the conditions on the compatibility relation @xmath21 can be rephrased as follows : consider the ( abstract ) simplicial complex @xmath28 whose @xmath29-simplices are the subsets of @xmath30 pairwise compatible elements of @xmath20 .",
    "a simplex of codimension @xmath31 is called a wall .",
    "we assume that    * @xmath28 is a pure simplicial complex , _ i.e. _  all maximal simplices are of the same dimension ; * every wall is contained in precisely two maximal simplices .",
    "then the exchange graph is the dual graph of @xmath28 .",
    "if in addition the exchange graph is connected , then @xmath28 is a pseudo - manifold .",
    "see  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 2.1 ) .",
    "we define an _ ordered exchange graph _ to be an exchange graph @xmath32 endowed with a partial order @xmath33 on the set of clusters such that :    * ( the underlying graph of ) the hasse quiver of the partial order @xmath34 coincides with the graph @xmath32 : a predecessor @xmath22 of @xmath35 with respect to @xmath34 is an immediate predecessor precisely when @xmath35 and @xmath22 are related by a mutation , * the hasse quiver has a unique source and at most one sink .    the orientation on an ordered exchange graph @xmath32 induces a colouring of the elements of each cluster @xmath22 : since @xmath32 is an @xmath27regular graph , there will be @xmath36 arrows starting in @xmath22 and @xmath37 arrows ending in @xmath22 . since edges correspond to mutations of the elements of @xmath22 , we can write the set @xmath22 as a union of @xmath38 `` green '' elements and @xmath39 `` red '' elements , where the condition ( 2 ) in the definition of an exchange graph ensures that these two sets are disjoint .",
    "the source in @xmath32 is the unique cluster with all of its elements green , and the sink ( if it exists ) has all elements red .",
    "a maximal path in an ordered exchange graph @xmath32 can thus be interpreted as a maximal sequence of mutations at green elements .",
    "these sequences , called _ maximal green sequences _ by b. keller  @xcite , play an important role in finding quantum dilogarithm identities and non - commutative donaldson  thomas invariants @xcite and in calculating the complete spectrum of a bps ( bogomolnyi  prasad  sommerfield ) particle in string theory @xcite ( this also appears implicitly in @xcite ) .",
    "the main feature of an ordered exchange graph is the property ( i ) : the arrows in the hasse quiver of the poset are given by mutations .",
    "this property has been established by happel and unger @xcite in the context of tilting modules ( see section  [ ss : tilting - module ] ) , and the concepts presented in this article can be seen as a way to enlarge the poset of tilting modules such that the hasse quiver becomes an @xmath27regular graph ( see section  [ ss : support - tau - tilting ] ) .    note that not all the structures of an ordered exchange graph ( the compatibility relation , the partial order , the mutations ) are explicitly visible or known for some of the examples .",
    "the purpose of this article is to point out that all examples we discuss carry all those structures , via the bijections we provide .",
    "some structures are more naturally defined for some cases : the compatibility relation is given by mutual vanishing of extension groups in the context of ( cluster-)tilting objects , the partial order is given most naturally by inclusion in the context of torsion classes , @xmath5-structures and co-@xmath5-structures , and the mutation is the main ingredient in the definition of @xmath40-matrices , @xmath41-matrices and clusters .",
