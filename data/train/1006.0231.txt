    "the advent of increasingly realistic three - dimensional convection simulations based on radiation - hydrodynamics codes @xcite has led to the conclusion that horizontal inhomogeneities and departures from local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) are crucial for an accurate abundance determination ( see the review by * ? ? ?",
    "three - dimensional hydrodynamic ( hd ) models have allowed to remove many uncertainties in abundance determination , in particular those coming from the use of micro- and macroturbulence velocity parameters @xcite . yet , several sources of uncertainty remain , resulting , e.g. , from possible blending of lines , errors in continuum measurements , equivalent width determination @xcite or calculation of collisions with h atoms @xcite .",
    "another potentially important source of uncertainty stems from the presence of significant amounts of magnetic flux in the photosphere of the quiet sun @xcite and its possible influence on the average width of the line profiles @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this letter is to use 3d magnetoconvection ( mhd ) models to estimate the influence of the magnetic field on the spectral profiles of a number of lines , and to translate the difference between the equivalent widths in mhd and hd models to the corresponding fe abundance corrections .",
    "the impact of magnetic fields on chemical abundance determinations has so far been widely neglected .",
    "it was implicitly assumed that the magnetic field should not play a major role in changing the shapes of spatially - averaged spectral lines , as these averages are weighted towards granules @xcite , while magnetic concentrations are thought to reside mainly in intergranular lanes @xcite .",
    "still , @xcite found that the neglect of magnetic broadening can lead to a systematic error of up to @xmath4 dex in the abundance determination of iron .",
    "the author used 1d spectral synthesis with uniform magnetic field in a plane - parallel atmosphere , therefore inevitably neglecting the effect of the field on the temperature stratification .",
    "however , the latter effect , although indirect , can be important and must be considered alongside the direct effect through zeeman broadening ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "iron is one of the crucial chemical elements for a variety of reasons like : ( a ) it is widely used to define a metallicity scale , hence as a proxy for the overall metal content ; ( b ) the effect of the magnetic field on the line profiles seem to be more pronounced for this element than for ,  si , c and o @xcite ; ( c ) the large amount of iron lines in the solar spectrum allows to consider features with high land factor .",
    "it is therefore advisable to start with iron when studying the magnetic effects on abundance determinations from mhd models . in this letter",
    ", we present results based on a series of three - dimensional magneto - convection simulations . our aim is to explore , understand and constrain the possible impact on the solar abundance determination of self - consistent , simultaneous 3d and magnetic effects .",
    "these effects are studied via comparison of the equivalent widths for the magnetic cases with those obtained in hd conditions . to derive the necessary abundance correction",
    ", we match the mhd equivalent width with that obtained on the basis of hd runs with changed abundance .",
    "our analysis focuses on quiet sun conditions .",
    "we conclude that magnetic effects , in particular via modification of the average temperature stratification , should be taken into account when considering the solar abundance problem .",
    "the results in this paper are based on simulations we carried out using the copenhagen stagger - code , a high - order finite - difference cartesian mhd code using hyper - diffusivities .",
    "all calculations reported here are for a domain of @xmath5 mm@xmath6 , with a grid of @xmath7 points and uniform spacing in the horizontal directions .",
    "the vertical direction is non - uniform and reaches a maximum resolution of @xmath815 km in the photosphere .",
    "this grid should provide sufficient resolution for the purpose of abundance studies @xcite .",
    "to initiate the mhd runs , a vertical uniform magnetic field of strength @xmath9 was introduced into an already evolved hd snapshot .",
    "an hd run and three different mhd cases ( with @xmath10 g ) were evolved for up to several solar hours , with snapshots taken every 30 seconds .",
    "when the implanted magnetic field is sufficiently strong , as the simulation evolves the continuum intensity starts to show fine bright threads / points and fragments ( fig .",
    "[ fig : contin ] ) , as in high - resolution solar observations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    to simplify the task , the spectral synthesis was performed in lte .",
    "we considered the three lines of  at @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 nm , which have epl @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 ev ; log gf = @xmath17 and @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively .",
    "we used the lilia code @xcite , and set the resolution to 1.28 pm over 200 wavelength points .",
    "the synthetic spectra were computed using no enhancement factor to the van der waals broadening formula in the spectral synthesis . to obtain the final synthetic profiles ,",
    "emergent spectra were calculated for each vertical column in the grid .",
    "averages were then calculated for each wavelength over the horizontal directions and in time , using @xmath20 solar minutes of the stationary stage of the simulations .",
    "in fig .  [ fig_mhd ] , we show ( solid lines ) the spatially- and temporally - averaged synthetic line profiles from our hd and @xmath0 g experiments ( top panels ) , and the differences in intensity between the spectral profiles derived in the mhd cases and those obtained for the hd case ( bottom panels ) . each of the profiles shown was normalized _ to its own continuum level_.    observational data taken from the fts spectral atlas @xcite are also shown in the figure for visual comparison ( top panels , empty circles ) .",
    "the fit of the line profiles is satisfactory , with the mhd models performing better than the hd one . in any case , since the objective is a _",
    "analysis between mhd and hd , the scope of the work presented here does not require obtaining extremely high accuracy in the fitting of observed line profiles .",
    "remaining discrepancies in the fitting , especially in the line cores , can be explained by the higher temperatures in the relevant layers of our mhd models , which will lead to stronger neutral iron overionisation and are thus likely to induce larger departures from the lte assumption adopted here .",
    "more importantly with regards to our aim here , we verified that our equivalent width calculation converged with regards to the number of sampled spectral wavelengths .",
    "moreover , our equivalent - width estimates are in fair agreement with the observational values found in the literature @xcite .",
    "a further check of the goodness of our simulations is possible : we obtain an excellent match between our continuum intensity values and those expected from the literature ( see figure 2 of * ? ? ?",
    "for example , in units of erg/(@xmath21 s ster  ) , we get stokes i values of @xmath22 ( continuum around the  @xmath23 and @xmath24 nm lines ) , @xmath25 ( continuum around the  401.02 nm line ) , @xmath26 ( around the  @xmath27 and @xmath28 nm lines ) and @xmath29 ( continuum around the  700.06 nm line ) .",
    "the latter two values match almost perfectly with the observational data of @xcite . on the other hand , our uv values , while still agreeing to a good level , may be slightly too high due to our neglect of line haze on continuum at those wavelengths .",
    "we have also used stokes v polarization signature results ( fig .",
    "[ fig : contin ] , right panel ) to derive stokes v amplitudes . depending on the wavelength considered",
    ", we find stokes v average amplitudes ( measured in units of stokes i continuum intensity ) of the order of @xmath30 ( `` 100 g '' case ) .",
    "this corresponds , when calibrating our stokes v signals using the weak - field approximation , ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , to an average unsigned vertical magnetic flux of the order of @xmath31 g. these numbers are typical for solar internetwork and network regions , as deduced when considering the effect of limited spatial resolution of observations .",
    "this result confirms that our simulations are representative of solar quiet regions , a description covering 90 percent of the solar surface .    regarding limb - darkening , recent work by @xcite shows that related uncertainties in the simulations play only a minimal role for solar abundances .",
    "our differential approach ensures that the small impact of any discrepancy found against limb darkening measurements can be neglected here .",
    "figure [ fig_stratif ] compares the average temperature stratification of the different magnetic runs versus optical depth : the averaging was done on a fixed @xmath32 scale , and over all snapshots . as seen in the figure , in the relevant layers of formation of the absorption",
    "features we consider , @xmath33 increases with increasing magnetic flux in the simulations , a result expected from radiation transfer considerations in strong solar magnetic elements @xcite .",
    "the formation heights of the relevant lines , for the hd case , are : -0.276 mm for  @xmath12 nm and -0.229 mm for  @xmath34 nm @xcite , and -0.135 mm for  @xmath13 nm @xcite , which correspond to an optical depth of between @xmath35 and @xmath36 . as seen in the figure , at these optical depths",
    "there is a significant temperature increase in the mhd cases compared to hd .",
    "the maximum temperature difference , arises at @xmath37 , reaching up to @xmath38 k for the run with average vertical magnetic flux density of @xmath0 g. together with the direct effect due to the presence of a magnetic field , this has direct implications for the equivalent width of the average profiles and , thus , for the abundance corrections .    as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig_mhd ] , the line core tends to get weaker in the mhd cases for all of the fe lines considered , due to the increased average temperature of the corresponding atmospheric models ( fig .",
    "[ fig_stratif ] ) .",
    "for the two visible lines , this indirect influence on the line formation turns out to be the dominant effect , with the direct effect of the magnetic field on the lines being small . due to its ir wavelength and large magnetic - sensitivity , the @xmath39 nm line experiences instead significant direct zeeman broadening , which , in terms of resulting equivalent width , goes in the opposite direction of the indirect ( core - weakening ) effect      to obtain a differential abundance correction between the hd and mhd cases , we modify the fe abundance upward or downward of the standard value @xmath40 @xcite in the calculation of the average spectra for the hd series .",
    "this is done in steps of @xmath41 dex , until the corresponding theoretical equivalent width matches the one derived using the standard iron abundance when computing the average spectra for the mhd case of interest .",
    "this method allows us to translate the effects of the magnetic field into abundance corrections .",
    "the equivalent widths of the three spectral lines calculated with the standard fe abundance are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : ew ] ( filled circles ) .",
    "the figure also gives ( dashed horizontal lines ) the equivalent width values for the hd case calculated with the iron abundance changed in steps of @xmath41 dex .",
    "since for each case we normalise the average profiles to the relevant continuum level , changes in equivalent width are due to actual changes in the shape and depth of the absorption features . by comparing the filled circles and the horizontal lines in each of the three panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : ew ] , we see that the maximum abundance difference is reached in all cases for the runs with the highest field strength , @xmath42 g. the actual numerical values for the maximum difference are : @xmath43 dex for  @xmath13 nm ; @xmath44 dex for  @xmath12 nm and slightly above @xmath45 dex for  @xmath34 nm .",
    "the variations of the equivalent width in fig .",
    "[ fig : ew ] are caused both by direct magnetic effects ( , via zeeman broadening ) and , indirectly , via changes in the stratification leading to different amount of absorption in the line core .",
    "as the name implies , zeeman broadening always causes an increase in the equivalent width .",
    "in contrast , the indirect contribution resulting from the increased average temperatures in the mhd models is a line - weakening effect for the three chosen lines .",
    "this is to be expected ( see discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 13 ) for neutral fe lines in the solar photosphere , where iron is mostly ionized in the relevant layers .",
    "one can estimate the relative importance of the direct and indirect effects by ad - hoc setting @xmath46 while keeping all other variables unmodified when doing the spectral synthesis for the mhd snapshots .",
    "the open circles in fig .",
    "[ fig : ew ] show the equivalent widths resulting from carrying out this experiment for all three lines . for the visible lines the indirect effects dominate , which can be expected since they form at heights in the photosphere where the temperature differences between the mhd and hd models become more important .",
    "the direct effect for those lines leads to a roughly linear increase of equivalent width with @xmath47 , which is compatible with the zeeman broadening origin of this effect . for the infrared  @xmath13 nm line , in turn",
    ", the direct magnetic effects become dominant to the point that they reverse the sign of the abundance correction in that case .",
    "the sensitivity of this spectral line to the magnetic field is in fact very high , given its longer wavelength and the fact that its land factor is g@xmath48 .",
    "also , for this infrared  line there seems to be a saturation effect , although no asymptotic horizontal regime is reached in the range of b used in the present study .",
    "in the past decade , an intense debate has arisen due to the conflict created by new solar abundance determinations , see e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . despite the fact that the new abundances well match meteoritic values and improve the agreement with solar - neighbourhood and local interstellar - medium abundances , the proposed large reduction of the solar overall metallicity has led to controversies , especially from the helioseismology community , because it spoils the previous agreement between interior sound speed profiles derived from helioseismic measurements and predictions based on the classical solar model @xcite .    to settle the open issues ,",
    "a thorough exploration of the effects on line formation of the interaction between magnetic field and convection is a necessary step . in this letter",
    "we have presented a study of that kind using three representative fe lines .",
    "we have determined that magnetic fields have a noticeable influence on the formation of iron lines and consequently on the solar fe abundance determination . for average vertical flux densities of @xmath0 g ,",
    "we obtain abundance corrections ( to be applied in order to obtain the same equivalent widths in hd and mhd ) between @xmath49 and @xmath50 dex in absolute value , while @xmath51 dex for all lines for the @xmath52 g case . a flux density of order @xmath53 g , as in the range shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ew ] , is probably the relevant reference value since it has been shown to correspond to the order of the mean field strength of the photospheric plasma @xcite .",
    "our results show that the direct ( zeeman ) and indirect ( stratification - related ) effects of the magnetic field contribute in different amounts to the changes in the different lines .",
    "the indirect effects cause most of the equivalent width change of the visible fe lines , with a small contribution from the zeeman effect ; for the infrared line , in contrast , the zeeman effect is dominant , and in fact changes the sign of the abundance correction .",
    "the absolute value of the total correction is similar for all lines , so we can take it as the reference abundance change related with the presence or absence of magnetic field in the convection model .",
    "in fact , for the visible lines , the use of mhd models to match the observational data will lead to _ higher _ derived iron abundance than when using an hd model , since the predicted theoretical equivalent widths are smaller for the former cases than for the latter .",
    "the opposite applies for the  @xmath13 nm , since the increased temperature of the mhd models is more than compensated by the very large direct zeeman line splitting .",
    "there are different avenues to explore with a view to confirming and extending all these results .",
    "one should consider further reliable fe i line pairs with different magnetic sensitivity @xcite , and carry out an extensive study including all stokes parameters for the same spectral features as in previous 3d investigations @xcite , but now based on mhd simulations .",
    "on the other hand , spectral synthesis using 3d convection models should aim to match key observational constraints such as spatially resolved line profiles @xcite , center - to - limb continuum behaviour , calibrated continuum intensities at disk center , spectral energy distribution , and h lines .",
    "finally , it is urgent to explore the magnetic effects in the sun for lines of other crucial elements .    financial support by the european commission through the solaire network ( mtrn - ct-2006 - 035484 ) and by the spanish ministry of research and innovation through projects aya2007 - 66502 , csd2007 - 00050 and aya2007 - 63881",
