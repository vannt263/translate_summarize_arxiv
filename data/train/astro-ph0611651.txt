    "as a result of the high density of matter and stars in the galactic center , opportunities arise for energetic particles , radiation , and interstellar matter to interact in ways that occur very rarely in the galactic disk .",
    "one manifestation of these interactions are iron fluorescence nebulae that are visible in the x - ray band , and that are associated with the molecular cloud complexes sgr b1 and b2 @xcite , sgr c @xcite , and m 0.11 - 0.11 @xcite .",
    "the fluorescence is thought to be produced when low - ionization iron in the molecular clouds is bombarded either by @xmath330 kev electrons @xcite or by @xmath38 kev x - rays @xcite .",
    "however , exciting the fluorescent features with electrons would require a large , and arguably unreasonable , amount of energy in kev electrons @xcite , and there is currently no x - ray source in the galactic center bright enough to illuminate these features @xcite .",
    "therefore , the excitation mechanism for these features is uncertain .    in this paper",
    ", we attempt to determine how the iron fluorescence features are excited , by searching for variations in the morphologies and intensities of the two examples with the highest surface brightnesses ( features 1 and 2 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which are located in the m0.11 - 0.11 cloud complex .",
    "if the fluorescence is excited by particles , which would propagate rather slowly ( @xmath4@xmath5 for 30 kev electrons ) , the features would not vary over the course of a few years . alternatively ,",
    "if the fluorescence is produced by x - rays , the absence of any source that is currently bright enough to produce them implies that the x - rays were produced in a transient event .",
    "if the outburst were short enough , then in a few years the light front could propagate across the features , causing their morphologies and intensities to change @xcite . here",
    "we report that , in fact , the two fluorescent features have changed after three years .",
    "the features that we studied were identified by @xcite , based on 500 ks of observations of the 20 pc around  taken with the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer imaging array between 2002 may 22 and june 3 .",
    "since then , 100 ks of data were acquired between 2004 july 5 and 6 , and 200 ks between 2005 july 24 and august 1 .",
    "all of the observations had aim points within 20  of , although the roll angles for the satellite differed in 2002 ( 76@xmath6 ) and 2004 - 2005 ( 280@xmath6 ) . features 1 and 2 are located near @xmath7=266.492@xmath6 , @xmath8=28.943@xmath6  ( j2000 ) , or 6  from , and are covered by all of our observations.=266.593 , @xmath8=28.920 in @xcite , but was not covered by the observations in 20042005 , and so we ignore this feature . ] at this offset , the point - spread function ( psf ) at 6 kev has a full - width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) of 6 , which corresponds to a physical scale of 0.2 pc ( @xmath9=8 kpc ; * ? ? ?",
    "we processed the event lists from each observation to remove bad pixels , cosmic rays , and background flares in the standard manner , using ciao version 3.3.0 and the calibration database version 3.2.2 .",
    "next , we identified point - like x - ray sources using the wavelet algorithm wavdetect .",
    "finally , the absolute astrometric frame was registered using x - ray sources with counterparts in the 2mass catalog @xcite , making it accurate to 02 .    to search for temporal evolution",
    ", we produced three separate images of the flux in the 48 kev band , using the data from 2002 , 2004 , and 2005 .",
    "this limited energy range was chosen to reject foreground emission , emission from soft plasma , and particle background . in figure",
    "[ fig : images ] , we display the portion of the field containing features 1 and 2 , smoothed by a gaussian with a fwhm of 6 .",
    "having smoothed the images on this scale , changes in the psf shape are not significant , as can be seen by examining point sources in the image . over three years ,",
    "the morphologies of features 1 and 2 change noticeably .",
    "these variations can be seen more clearly in difference images , which we have normalized to the uncertainty in the convolved flux maps and displayed in figure [ fig : difference ] . to generate these , we first calculated the one - sided , upper 1@xmath10 poisson uncertainty on the counts in each pixel of each image , following @xcite .",
    "we divided this by the corresponding exposure maps to obtain the uncertainties on the flux , @xmath11 .",
    "the uncertainties in each convolved image ( @xmath12 ) were then the square root of the convolution of the square of the uncertainties with the square of the gaussian smoothing function ( @xmath13 ) , @xmath14 .",
    "the uncertainties in each pair of images were then added in quadrature to obtain those of the difference images .",
    "the difference images were divided by the uncertainty maps to obtain the significance maps .    in figure",
    "[ fig : difference ] , red features were defined to be brighter in the later images ; a clear example is the transient source xmm j174554.4 - 285456 @xcite , which appeared in 2004 just north of the center of the image .",
    "we find significant variations in several places in the field .",
    "some of the most prominent variations are at the locations of the two fluorescent features with the highest surface brightness . the main ridge that composed feature 1 in 2002 faded at the 3@xmath10 level by 2005 , while the northern part of the feature on either side of the ridge brightened by 4@xmath10 . for feature 2 , we find that the southern portion faded by 3@xmath10 between 2002 and 2005 , whereas the eastern portion shifted farther east and became more extended at the 45@xmath10 level .",
    "we also find 34@xmath10 increases in the flux to the east of feature 2 and the south of feature 1 .",
    "the pervasive nature of these variations is not surprising , becuase then entire field contains molecular gas @xcite and exhibits diffuse iron k@xmath7 emission @xcite .",
    "next , we extracted spectra of the diffuse features .",
    "the source spectra were extracted from the solid ellipses in figure  [ fig : images ] ( top panel ) and the background from the dotted ellipses above and below the features .",
    "we excluded events that fell within circles circumscribing the 92% encircled - energy contours of the psfs for each point source .",
    "the background - subtracted spectra were grouped so that each bin had a signal - to - noise ratio of @xmath155 .",
    "spectra for all of the data are displayed in figure  [ fig : spectra ] .",
    "we modeled the spectra from the 2002 and 20042005 epochs jointly using xspec , as a power - law continuum with photon index @xmath16 and normalization @xmath17 , two narrow iron lines at 6.40 ( fe k@xmath7 ) and 7.06 kev ( fe k@xmath18 ) .",
    "we assumed that this emission was absorbed by the interstellar medium ( @xmath19 , plus a component of the absorption intrinsic to the associated molecular clouds ( @xmath20 ) that covered a variable fraction of the emitting region ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "the use of such a `` partial covering '' factor ( @xmath21 ) was motivated by the assumption that the emission from the clouds would take place at a range of optical depths .",
    "we also assumed that @xmath16 and @xmath22 were identical for both features during both epochs . in table",
    "[ tab : spec ] , we list the best - fit parameter values , iron equivalent widths , and fluxes .",

    "the fe k@xmath18 emission is @xmath210 - 15% of the strength of the k@xmath7 line , as is expected for fluorescent emission ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "both features are heavily absorbed , so most of the observed flux is received between 4 and 8 kev .",
    "we find that for feature 1 , despite the noticeable changes in the morphology , the 48 kev flux and the iron flux in the extraction region remained constant between 2002 and 2005 . for feature 2 ,",
    "the inferred iron flux remained constant , but the observed 48 kev flux declined by 26@xmath677% .",
    "we have found that two fluorescent iron features located 6(14 pc in projection ) from   varied in morphology and intensity between 2002 and 2005 ( figs .  [ fig : images ] and [ fig : difference ] , and tab .",
    "[ tab : spec ] ) .",
    "these changes in the fluorescence features require that the illuminating source varied on a time scale shorter than 3 years . moreover , the features are @xmath20.3  wide and @xmath2 1  long , which corresponds to projected physical sizes of @xmath20.7 @xmath68 2 pc .",
    "the smaller of these dimensions constrains the minimum duration of the outburst to have been two years .",
    "the fact that two features with a projected spearation of @xmath212 light - years varied over the same time interval implies that the illuminating source and the target clouds have separations with a component along our line of sight .    such rapid changes over the course of a few years would not be produced by steady , slow - moving sources such as ejecta from supernovae @xcite .",
    "these shifting iron fluorescence features also would not be produced by @xmath230  kev electrons , which would have velocities of only 0.06@xmath69 ( and slower diffusion speeds ) , and which would presumably be accelerated in shocks that persist for much longer than a few years .",
    "the most reasonable explanation for these variable fluorescent features is that they are scattered emission from the outburst of a transient hard x - ray source , such as an x - ray binary or the supermassive black hole .",
    "the luminosity of the source illuminating these reflection nebulae can be estimated from the optical depths of the scattering media coupled with the fluxes in the iron lines .",
    "the luminosity in the fluorescent fe k@xmath7 line is about 30% of the flux absorbed by the photoelectric edge , and so the observed flux can be computed from @xmath70^{-3 } } \\right ] de , \\label{eq : fka}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 is the distance from the observer to the fluorescence region , @xmath71 is the specific luminosity of the illuminating source as a function of energy ( units of photons s@xmath1 kev@xmath1 ) , @xmath72 is the distance between the source and the fluorescing cloud , @xmath73 is the area of the cloud projected toward the source , and @xmath74 is the optical depth of the iron photoelectric edge at an energy @xmath75 kev .",
    "this equation can be simplified given the parameters of our nebulae .",
    "the optical depth is given by @xmath76 , where @xmath77 @xmath78 is the cross - section for photoelectric absorption at 7.1 kev , and @xmath79 is the fractional abundance of iron for solar abundances . if we take @xmath80 @xmath81 ( tab .",
    "[ tab : spec ] ) , the optical depth to iron absorption is @xmath82 , and @xmath83 with an error of @xmath430% .",
    "next , we take @xmath9=8 kpc , define @xmath84 to be normalized to 10 pc , re - write @xmath73 as a solid angle @xmath85 normalized to 1 arcmin@xmath86 at 8 kpc , and write @xmath74 in terms of the column depth @xmath87 in units of @xmath88 @xmath81 and the abundance of iron relative to the solar value @xmath89 .",
    "finally , we assume that the spectrum of the illuminating source is a @xmath16=1.8 power law , @xmath90 .",
    "we then can integrate eq .",
    "[ eq : fka ] over energy , and write the result in terms of the 28 kev luminosity , normalized to @xmath91 erg s@xmath1 , @xmath92 . with these substitutions ,",
    "we find : @xmath93    if  is the source of the photons that produced the reflection features , and that the line - of - sight separation between it and the cloud is equal to the projected separation ( 14 pc ) , @xmath94 pc and an outburst with @xmath95 erg s@xmath1   would have been required .",
    "such an outburst would have occurred 60 years ago , before the advent of x - ray astronomy , and therefore would not have been observed .",
    "the lack of similar reflection nebula at negative galactic longitudes @xcite implies that those clouds do not lie within the light front of the outburst .    alternatively , if the bright transient that was in outburst in 2004 produced the fluorescent features , @xmath96 pc and @xmath97 erg s@xmath1 .",
    "although this is 100 times brighter than the outbursts in 2002 and 2004 @xcite , this outburst would have occurred 20 years ago , before the advent of both _",
    "chandra _  and the wide - field x - ray monitors on _ bepposax _ and the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ , so it too could have been missed .",
    "however , it is uncommon for the outburst of an x - ray binary to persist at this luminosity for 23 years @xcite , so we prefer the hypothesis that the source of the outburst was .",
    "the time evolution of a reflection nebula has been explored in detail by @xcite , assuming target material with a spherical geometry . however , the observed changes in the morphology in figure [ fig : images ] are significantly more complex than they considered .",
    "for instance , in feature 1 the vertical filament @xmath22 parsec long fades over the course of 3 years .",
    "the fact that the light - travel time along the feature is longer than the interval over which it fades implies that the light front propagated perpendicular to the filament , and had width that is similar to that of the filament ( 0.3 pc ) .",
    "the fact that the whole filament dimmed , with very little brightening adjacent to most of its length ( aside from knots in the north on either side of the filament ) implies that the x - rays were no longer propagating through dense material in 2004 and 2005 .",
    "therefore , the morphology of the iron features traces the structure of the clouds , revealing that they contain filamentary features a few tenths of a parsec wide and a couple parsecs long .",
    "the discovery of changes in the intensity and morphology of fluorescent iron nebulae near the galactic center demonstrates that they are reflection nebulae .",
    "the most likely source of the reflected x - rays is an outburst of  with a luminosity of at least @xmath91 erg s@xmath1 , which would have occurred about 50 years ago and lasted 23 years .",
    "if a similar outburst had occurred since then , it would have had a good chance of being detected by an x - ray instrument , or would have produced similar fluorescent features in other , nearby clouds . since no other , long outburst of  has been reported , and no fluorescent features have been identified closer to  @xcite , the duty cycle of bright , year - long outbursts from   must be @xmath985%",
    ".    these fluorescent features also reveal filamentary structures within the dense regions of the molecular clouds .",
    "interferometric millimeter observations would resolve clouds on a similar spatial scale , and additionally provide velocity information . combining the cloud velocities and",
    "the three - dimensional spatial information afforded by the evolution of the reflection nebulae would allow one to construct a physical model of these turbulent molecular clouds .",
