    "heavy quark spin symmetry ( hqss ) has proved to be a useful tool to understand the bottom and charm physics  @xcite , and it has been extensively used to describe the dynamics of systems containing a heavy quark @xmath1 or @xmath2 .",
    "hqss is an approximate symmetry of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , which appears in systems containing heavy quarks with masses ( @xmath3 ) that are much larger than the typical quantities ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 ) that set up the energy scale of the dynamics of the remaining ( light ) degrees of freedom .",
    "hqss predicts that all type of spin interactions vanish for infinitely massive quarks : the dynamics is unchanged under arbitrary transformations on the spin of the heavy quark ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "the spin - dependent interactions are proportional to the chromomagnetic moment of the heavy quark , and so are of the order of @xmath7 .",
    "the total angular momentum of the hadron @xmath8 is a conserved operator , the spin of the heavy quark @xmath9 is conserved in the @xmath10 limit , and therefore the spin of the light degrees of freedom @xmath11 is also conserved in the heavy quark limit .",
    "heavy hadrons come in doublets ( unless @xmath12 , with @xmath13 ) containing states with total spin @xmath14 obtained by combining the spin of the light degrees of freedom with the spin of the heavy quark @xmath15 .",
    "these doublets are degenerated in the @xmath16 limit .",
    "hqss has not been systematically employed in the context of non - relativistic constituent quark models ( nrcqm s ) .",
    "nrcqm s , based upon simple quark - quark potentials , partially inspired by qcd , lead to reasonably good descriptions of hadrons as bound states of constituent quarks .",
    "most of the quark - quark interactions include a term with a shape and a color structure determined from the one gluon exchange contribution and a confinement potential , which is assumed to come from the long - range nonperturbative features of qcd .    in this contribution , we will study masses and electroweak decays of various single and double heavy baryon within a nrcqm scheme , but taking explicitly into account hqss constraints , which , as we will show , lead to great simplifications in these systems .",
    "up to corrections of the order @xmath17 , hqss guaranties that the heavy baryon light degrees of freedom quantum numbers , compiled in table  [ tab : summ ] , are always well defined .",
    "the symmetry also predicts that the baryon pair @xmath18 ( or the @xmath19 pair , or the @xmath20 one ) become degenerated for an infinitely massive heavy quark , since both baryons have the same cloud of light degrees of freedom . in this section ,",
    "we first describe a variational approach  @xcite for the solution of the non - relativistic three - body problem in baryons with a heavy quark .",
    "thanks to hqss , the proposed method turns out to be quite simple , leads to simple and manageable wave functions and reproduces previous results ( baryon masses , charge and mass radii , @xmath21 ) obtained by solving the faddeev equations  @xcite .",
    "we will also discuss in this context , the semileptonic decay @xmath22 @xcite .",

    "the general structure is as follows ( @xmath114 ) : @xmath115 with @xmath116 the spin pauli matrices , @xmath117 and @xmath118 .    in a baryon ,",
    "the singlet color wave function is completely anti - symmetric under the exchange of any of the three quarks . within the su(3 ) quark model , we assume a complete symmetry of the wave function under the exchange of the two light quarks ( @xmath119 ) flavor , spin and space degrees of freedom . on the other hand , for the interactions described above , we have that both the total spin of the baryon , @xmath120 , and the orbital angular momentum of the light quarks with respect to @xmath6 , @xmath121 , with @xmath122 commute with @xmath110",
    ". we will assume that the ground states of the baryons are in s  wave , @xmath123 , which implies that the spatial wave function can only depend on the relative distances @xmath124 , @xmath125 and @xmath126 .",
    "note that when the heavy quark mass is infinity , the total spin of the light degrees of freedom , @xmath127 , commutes with @xmath110 , since the @xmath128 terms vanish in this limit .",
    "with all these ingredients , and taking into account the quantum numbers of the light degrees of freedom for each baryon , compiled in table  [ tab : summ ] and that in general are always well defined in the static limit mentioned above , we have constructed the wave functions in our variational approach .",
    "thus , for instance for @xmath129type baryons ( @xmath129type baryons : @xmath130 ) , we use , @xmath131 or @xmath132 ) and spin ( @xmath133 ) wave functions of the light degrees of freedom . ]",

    "note , that su(3 ) flavor symmetry ( su(2 ) , in the case of the @xmath138 baryon ) would also allow for a component in the wave function of the type @xmath139 with @xmath140 ( for instance terms of the type @xmath141 ) and , the real numbers @xmath142 are clebsh - gordan coefficients .",
    "this component is forbidden by hqss in the limit @xmath143 , where @xmath144 turns out to be well defined and set to zero for @xmath145type baryons .",
    "the most general su(2 ) @xmath138 wave function will involve a linear combination of the two components , given in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : sim ] ) and ( [ eq : antis ] ) . neglecting @xmath146",
    ", hqss imposes an additional constraint , which justifies the use of a wave function of the type of that given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sim ] ) with the obvious simplification of the three body problem .",
    "one can benefit  @xcite from similar simplifications induced from hqss for all the rest of baryons compiled in table  [ tab : summ ] .",
    "the spatial wave function , @xmath147 , is determined by the variational principle : @xmath148 for simplicity , we use a jastrow  type functional form for the spatial wave function , as in the context of the similar problem of double @xmath149 hypernuclei  @xcite , @xmath150 for simplicity , we do not entirely determine the functions @xmath151 and @xmath152 from the variational principle , but we rather fix the bulk of these functions to the @xmath153wave ground states ( @xmath154 ) of the single particle hamiltonians , @xmath155 , defined in eq .",

    "thus , we take @xmath156 with only one ( two ) free parameter for a @xmath157 or @xmath158 ( @xmath159 ) baryon light quark content . finally , we construct the light  light correlation function , @xmath160 , from a linear combination of gaussians , with a total of eleven free parameters to be determined by the variational principle .",
    "the mass of the baryon is just the expected value of the intrinsic hamiltonian .",
    "provided with this family of jastrow type functions constrained by hqss and using several inter - quark interactions , we have calculated masses , charge and mass radii of all bottom and charm baryons compiled in table  [ tab : summ ] ( see @xcite ) . for the baryons considered in @xcite , we agree remarkably well with the results of this latter reference , obtained by solving involved faddeev equations , but thanks to hqss , the baryon wave functions are significantly simpler and more manageable than those derived in @xcite .    using the semi  analytical wave functions found here , we have also studied the semileptonic decays  @xcite ( see middle panel of fig .",

    "we work on coordinate space , and develop a novel expansion of the electroweak current operator , which supplemented with heavy quark effective theory constraints , allows us to predict the baryon form factors and the decay distributions for all @xmath163 values accessible in the physical decays .",

    "we briefly review now static properties , semileptonic and electromagnetic decays of doubly heavy baryons within the hqss constrained nrcqm scheme sketched in the previous section .",
    "we will consider the ground states of baryons containing two charm , two bottom or one charm and one bottom quarks ( see table  [ tab : sumhh ] ) . in these systems ,",
    "hqss amounts to the decoupling of the heavy quark spins in the infinite heavy quark mass limit . in that limit",

    "[ tab : sumhh ] we showed the @xmath194 ground states of these baryons classified so that @xmath174 is well defined ( @xmath174-basis ) . due to the finite value of the heavy quark masses , the hyperfine spin interaction ( @xmath195 term in eq .  ( [ eq : phe ] ) ) between the light quark and any of the heavy quarks can admix both @xmath196 and @xmath197 spin components into the wave function  @xcite .",
    "this mixing should be negligible for @xmath198 and @xmath199 doubly heavy baryons as the antisymmetry of the wave function would require radial excitations and/or higher orbital angular momentum in the @xmath196 component .",

    "indeed , nrcqm s calculations show that physical and @xmath209basis states differ in just a rotation of around @xmath212  @xcite .",
    "masses ( eigenvalues ) are very insensitive to hyperfine mixing , since the non - diagonal terms induced by the hyperfine spin interactions are around one thousand times smaller than the diagonal ones . however ,",
    "as roberts and pervin  @xcite pointed out , this mixing could greatly affect the decay widths of doubly heavy baryons .",
    "nrcqm calculations confirmed  @xcite this strong dependence of the semileptonic @xmath0 decay widths on the hyperfine mixing .",
    "this is not surprising , and it can be easily understood since the @xmath0 semileptonic decay width for transitions involving the @xmath174-basis @xmath213 state is very much different from the corresponding one involving the @xmath214 baryon .",
