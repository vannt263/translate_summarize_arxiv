    "recent observational and theoretical studies suggest that gravitational microlensing can induce variability not only in optical light , but also in the x - ray emission of lensed qsos @xcite .",
    "variability studies of qsos indicate that the size of the x - ray emitting region is significantly smaller ( @xmath0 several light hours ) , than the optical and uv emitting regions ( @xmath0 several light days ) .",
    "gravitational lensing is achromatic ( the deflection angle of a light ray does not depend on its wavelength ) , but it is clear that if the geometries of the emitting regions at different wavelengths are different then chromatic effects could occur .",
    "for example , if the microlens is a binary star or if the microlensed source is extended @xcite different amplifications in different spectral bands can be present .",
    "studies aiming to determine the influence of microlensing on the spectra of lensed qsos need to take into account the complex structure of the qso central emitting region @xcite .",
    "since the sizes of the emitting regions are wavelength dependent , microlensing by stars in the lens galaxy may lead to a wavelength dependent magnification .",
    "for example , blackburne et al .",
    "( 2006 ) reported such a flux anomaly in quadruply imaged quasar 1rxs j1131 - 1231 .",
    "in particular , they found discrepancies between the x - ray and optical flux ratio anomalies .",
    "such anomalies in the different spectral band flux ratios can be attributed to micro- or milli - lensing in the massive lensing halo . in the case of milli - lensing one",
    "can infer the nature of substructure in the lensing galaxy , which can be connected to cold dark matter ( cdm ) structures ( see e.g. dobler & keeton 2006 ) .",
    "besides microlensing , there are several mechanisms which can produce flux anomalies , such as extinction and intrinsic variability .",
    "these anomalies were discussed in @xcite where the authors gave a method that can aid in distinguishing between variations produced by microlensing from ones resulting from other effects . in this paper",
    "we discuss consequences of variations due to gravitational microlensing , in which the different geometries and dimensions of emitting regions of different spectral bands are considered .",
    "the influence of microlensing on qso spectra emitted from their accretion discs in the range from the x - ray to the optical spectral band is analyzed .",
    "moreover , assuming different sizes of the emitting regions , we investigate the microlensing time scales for those regions , as well as a time dependent response in amplification of different spectral bands due to microlensing .",
    "also , we give the estimates of microlensing time scales for a sample of lensed qsos .    in section 2 , we describe our model of the quasar emitting regions and a model of the micro - lens . in section 3 we discuss the time scales of microlensing and in section 4 we present our results . finally , in section 5 , we draw our conclusions .",
    "in our models we adopt a disc geometry for the emitting regions of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) since the most widely accepted paradigm for agn includes a supermassive black hole fed by an accretion disc .",
    "@xcite calculated spectral line profiles for radiation emitted from the inner parts of accretion discs and later on such features of fe @xmath1 lines were discovered by @xcite in japanese asca satellite data for seyfert galaxy mgc-6 - 30 - 15 .",
    "moreover , the assumption of a disc geometry for the distribution of the emitters in the central part is supported by the spectral shape of the fe k@xmath2 line in agn ( e.g. @xcite , see also results of simulations @xcite ) . on the other hand , very often",
    "a bump in the uv band is present in the spectra of agn , that indicates that the uv and optical continuum originates in an accretion disk .",
    "we should note here that probably most of the x - ray emission in the 110 kev energy range originates from inverse compton scattering of photons from the disc by electrons in a tenuous hot corona .",
    "proposed geometries of the hot corona of agn include a spherical corona sandwiching the disc and a patchy corona made of a few compact regions covering a small fraction of the disc ( see e.g. @xcite ) . on the other hand",
    ", it is known that part of the accretion disc that emits in the 110  kev rest - frame band ( e.g. the region that emits the continuum compton reflection component and the fluorescent emission lines ) is very compact and may contribute to x - ray variability in this energy range . in order to study the microlensing time scales",
    ", one should consider the dimensions of the x - ray emitting region which are very important for the integral flux variations due to microlensing .",
    "the geometry of the emitting regions adopted in microlensing models will affect the simulated spectra of the continuum and spectral line emission @xcite . in this paper",
    "we assume that the agn emission from the optical to the x - ray band originates from different parts of the accretion disc .",
    "also we assume that we have a stratification in the disc , where the innermost part emits the x - ray radiation and outer parts the uv and optical continuum emission . to study the effects of microlensing on a compact accretion disc we use the ray - tracing method , considering only those photon trajectories that reach the sky plane at a given observer angle ( see , e.g. popovi et al .",
    "2003a , b and references therein ) .",
    "the amplified brightness with amplification @xmath3 for the continuum is given by    @xmath4    where @xmath5 is the temperature , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the impact parameters which describe the apparent position of each point of the accretion disc image on the celestial sphere as seen by an observer at infinity , @xmath8 is the observed energy , @xmath9 is an emissivity function .    in the standard shakura - sunyaev disc model @xcite , accretion occurs via an optically thick and geometrically thin disc .",
    "the effective optical depth in the disc is very high and photons are close to the thermal equilibrium with electrons .",
    "the surface temperature is a function of disc parameters and results in the multicolor black body spectrum .",
    "this component is thought to explain the blue bump in agn and the soft x - ray emission in galactic black holes .",
    "although the standard shakura - sunyaev disc model does not predict the power - law x - ray emission observed in all sub - eddington accreting black holes , the power law for the x - ray emissivity in agn is usually adopted ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "but one can not exclude other approximations for emissivity laws , such as black - body or modified black - body emissivity laws .",
    "moreover , we will assume that the emissivity law is the same through the whole disc .",
    "therefore we used the black - body radiation law .",
    "the disc emissivity is given as ( e.g. @xcite ) :    @xmath10,\\ ] ] where @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the speed of light , @xmath13 is the planck constant , @xmath14 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath15 is the surface temperature",
    ". concerning the standard accretion disc @xcite , here we assumed that ( see @xcite ) : @xmath16 taking that an effective temperature in the innermost part ( where x - ray is originated ) is in an interval from 10@xmath17 k to 10@xmath18 k.          to explain the observed microlensing events in quasars , one can use different microlensing models .",
    "the simplest approximation is a point - like microlens , where microlensing is caused by some compact isolated object ( e.g. by a star ) .",
    "such a microlens is characterized by its einstein ring radius in the lens plane : @xmath19 or by the corresponding projection in the source plane : @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the gravitational constant , @xmath12 is the speed of light , @xmath22 is the microlens mass and @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the cosmological angular distances between observer - lens , observer - source and lens - source , respectively . in most cases",
    "we can not simply consider that microlensing is caused by an isolated compact object but we must take into account that the micro - deflector is located in an extended object ( typically , the lens galaxy ) .",
    "therefore , when the size of the einstein ring radius projection @xmath26 of the microlens is larger than the size of the accretion disc and when a number of microlenses form a caustic net , one can describe the microlensing in terms of the crossing of the disc by a straight fold caustic ( schneider et al .",
    "the amplification at a point of an extended source ( accretion disc ) close to the caustic is given by @xcite ( a more general expression for a magnification near a cusp type singularity is given by @xcite ) : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the amplification outside the caustic and @xmath29 is the caustic amplification factor , where @xmath30 is constant of order of unity ( e.g. witt et al . 1993 ) .",
    "the `` caustic size '' @xmath31 is the distance in a direction perpendicular to the caustic for which the caustic amplification is 1 , and therefore this parameter defines a typical linear scale for the caustic in the direction perpendicular to the caustic .",
    "@xmath32 is the distance perpendicular to the caustic in gravitational radii units and @xmath33 is the minimum distance from the disc center to the caustic .",
    "thus , @xmath34    @xmath35    and @xmath36 where @xmath37 .",
    "@xmath38 is the heaviside function , @xmath39 , for @xmath40 , otherwise it is 0 .",
    "@xmath41 is @xmath42 , it depends on the direction of caustic motion ; if the direction of the caustic motion is from approaching side of the disc @xmath43 , otherwise it is + 1 .",
    "also , in the special case of caustic crossing perpendicular to the rotating axis @xmath44 for direction of caustic motion from @xmath45 to @xmath46 , otherwise it is @xmath47 .",
    "a microlensing event where a caustic crosses over an emission region can be described in the following way : before the caustic reaches the emission region , the amplification is equal to @xmath28 because the heavisied function of equation ( 4 ) is zero .",
    "just as the caustic begins to cross the emitting region the amplification rises rapidly and then decays gradually towards @xmath28 as the source moves away from the caustic - fold .    moreover , for the specific event one can model the caustic shape to obtain different parameters ( see e.g. abajas et al . 2005 , kochanek 2004 for the case of q2237 + 0305 ) .",
    "in order to apply an appropriate microlens model , additionally we will consider a standard microlensing magnification pattern for the q2237 + 0305a image ( fig .",
    "1 left ) . for generating this map we used the ray - shooting method @xcite . in this method",
    "the input parameters are the average surface mass density @xmath48 , shear @xmath49 and width of the microlensing magnification map expressed in units of the einstein ring radius ( defined for one solar mass in the lens plane ) .",
    "first , we generate a random star field in the lens plane with use of the parameter @xmath48 .",
    "after that , we solve the poisson equation @xmath50 in the lens plane numerically , so we can determine the lens potential @xmath51 in every point of the grid in the lens plane . to solve the poisson equation",
    "numerically one has to write its finite difference form : @xmath52 here we used the standard 5-point formula for the two - dimensional laplacian .",
    "next step is inversion of the equation ( [ psi ] ) using fourier transform .",
    "after some transformations we obtain : @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 are dimensions of the grid in the lens plane .",
    "now , using the finite difference technique , we can compute the deflection angle @xmath56 in each point of the grid in the lens plane . after computing deflection angle",
    ", we can map the regular grid of points in the lens plane , via lens equation , onto the source plane .",
    "these light rays are then collected in pixels in the source plane , and the number of rays in one pixel is proportional to the magnification due to microlensing at this point in the source plane .    typically , for calculations of microlensing in gravitationally lensed systems one can consider cases where dimensionless surface mass density @xmath48 is some fraction of 1 e.g. 0.2 , 0.4 , 0.6 , 0.8 @xcite , cases without external shear ( @xmath57 ) and cases with @xmath58 for isothermal sphere model for the lensing galaxy . in this article",

    "we also calculated microlensing magnification pattern for a `` typical '' lens system ( fig . 1 right ) , where the redshifts of microlens and source are : @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "in this case , the microlens parameters are taken arbitrary : @xmath67 and @xmath68 and the size of obtained microlensing pattern is also @xmath69 , where @xmath70 .",
    "typical scales for microlensing are discussed not only in books on gravitational lensing @xcite , but in recent papers also ( see , for example , @xcite ) . in this paper",
    "we discuss microlenses located in gravitational macrolenses ( stars in lensing galaxies ) , since optical depth for microlensing is then the highest @xcite in comparison with other possible locations of gravitational microlenses , as for example stars situated in galactic clusters and extragalactic dark halos @xcite .    assuming the concordance cosmological model with @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 we recall that typical length scale for microlensing is @xcite : @xmath74 where `` typical '' microlens and sources redshifts are assumed to be @xmath75 ( similar to @xcite ) , @xmath76 is the schwarzschild radius corresponding to microlens mass @xmath22 , @xmath77 is dimensionless hubble constant .",
    "the corresponding angular scale is @xcite @xmath78    using the length scale ( [ eq_suppl1 ] ) and velocity scale ( say @xmath79  600  km / sec as @xcite did ) , one could calculate the standard time scale corresponding to the scale to cross the projected einstein radius @xmath80 where a relative transverse velocity @xmath81  km / sec ) .",
    "the time scale @xmath82 , corresponding to a point - mass lens and to a small source ( compared to the projected einstein radius of the lens ) , could be used if microlenses are distributed freely at cosmological distances and if each einstein angle is located far enough from another one .",
    "however , the estimation ( [ eq_suppl3 ] ) gives long and most likely overestimated time scales especially for gravitationally lensed systems .",
    "thus we must apply another microlens model to estimate time scales .    for a simple caustic model , such as one that considers a straight fold caustic , @xmath83 where @xmath32 is the perpendicular direction to the caustic fold ( it is obtained from eq . ( [ eq04 ] ) assuming that factor @xmath84 is about unity ) .",
    "] , there are two time scales depending either on the `` caustic size '' ( @xmath31 ) or the source radius ( @xmath85 ) . in the case when source radius is larger or at least close to the `` caustic size '' ( @xmath86 ) , the relevant time scale is the `` crossing time '' @xcite : @xmath87 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 correspond to @xmath65 and @xmath66 , respectively and @xmath88  cm . as a matter of fact",
    ", the velocity perpendicular to the straight fold caustic characterizes the time scale and it is equal to @xmath89 where @xmath30 is the angle between the caustic and the velocity @xmath90 in the lens plane , but in our rough estimates we can omit factor @xmath91 which is about unity .",
    "however , if the source radius @xmath85 is much smaller than the `` caustic size '' @xmath31 ( @xmath92 ) , one could use the `` caustic time '' , i.e. the time when the source is located in the area near the caustic : @xmath93 where @xmath94  cm .",
