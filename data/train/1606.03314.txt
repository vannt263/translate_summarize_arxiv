    "this electric field induced shift in the spin resonance frequency is known as the stark effect .",

    "the stark effect for donors in germanium is comprised of two parts : the hyperfine and spin - orbit stark shifts which are respectively one and four orders of magnitude larger than in silicon .",

    "stark addressability has been shown for narrow linewidth nuclear spin ensembles @xcite , but the shifts are too small to address electron spin ensembles .",
    "stark tuning an individual donor electron spin on and off resonance with a driving microwave field has also been demonstrated @xcite but is insufficient for multi donor quantum computing schemes where each donor will experience a different inhomogeneous environment .",
    "based on the direct measurements of the stark parameters @xcite , it remains unlikely that one can tune donor electron spins by more than an ensemble linewidth before ionization sets in .",
    "germanium s large tunability arises from its large spin - orbit coupling , small valley - orbit splitting , and small binding energy @xcite .",

    "physically , the hyperfine stark effect arises from a shift in the electronic wave function away from the donor nucleus when an electric field is applied .",
    "the hyperfine coupling is proportional to the overlap of the electronic wave function with the donor nucleus , so a shift in the wave function results in a reduction in the hyperfine coupling .",
    "this is the smaller of the two effects at x - band magnetic fields .",

    "addressability was achieved for ensembles of sb nuclear spins , which have very narrow linewidths @xcite .",
    "a field of 900 v / cm was used in this work to produce a shift of 8 khz .",
    "these large electric fields are not necessary in germanium .",
    "in summary , we have investigated the stark tunability of @xmath1p and @xmath0as donor qubits in germanium  a largely unstudied quantum system that offers some major advantages over silicon .",
    "our results show that the spin - orbit and hyperfine components of the stark shift are four orders and one order of magnitude larger , respectively , when compared with silicon .",

    "this means that even large ensembles of donor qubits in germanium can be reliably gated using electric fields .",

    "<S> a hyperfine stark effect was also resolved and is an order of magnitude larger than in silicon . </S>",
    "<S> we report the stark parameters for @xmath0as and @xmath1p donor electrons and compare them to the available theory . </S>",
    "<S> our data reveal that @xmath1p donors in germanium can be tuned by at least four times the ensemble linewidth making germanium an appealing new host material for spin qubits that offers major advantages over silicon . </S>"
