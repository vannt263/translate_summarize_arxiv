    "@xcite was the first who noticed that no constant period could satisfy the observed times of maximum light of rw dra , an rr lyrae type star century the origin of the light variation of rr lyrae ( cluster - type ) variables was unknown and they were classified according to the shape of their light curves as ` antalgol ' type .",

    "the striking changes in the height of the light maximum and in the shape of the light curve of rr lyr , which turned out to be periodic with 40 days , was discovered by @xcite . following these discoveries ,",
    "the blazhko effect has been detected and studied in a number of rr lyrae stars .",
    "the large - scale surveys as macho and ogle @xcite detected 1030 per cent incidence rate of the modulation among rrab stars in the magellanic clouds and the galactic bulge , while a recent ground - based multicolour photometric survey @xcite and the highly accurate observations of the corot and _ kepler _ space missions @xcite revealed that a significantly larger fraction of the fundamental - mode rr lyrae stars ( about 50 per cent ) shows the effect .",
    "the high occurrence rate of modulated rr lyrae stars makes the blazhko effect an even more intriguing problem of the pulsation theory .",
    "no wonder that it has captivated the researchers interest again in recent years . in spite of the fact that the highly accurate space data and the ground - based multicolour photometries have given new insights into the blazhko phenomenon ( for",
    "a recent review see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , no generally accepted theory exists that is able to explain the observed features of the effect @xcite .",
    "the connection between the shock - waves in the atmosphere and light - curve modulation is particularly interesting .",
    "the shock - waves play a significant role in the appearance of the bump / hump features on the light curve of rr lyrae stars .",
    "@xcite , investigating the spectral - feature variations during the 41-day modulation cycle of rr lyrae , suggested a model in which ` a critical level of shock - wave formation moves up and down ' in the star s atmosphere .",
    "later , @xcite have found that the amplitude of shock - waves is greatly correlated with the blazhko modulation .    to describe the light variations of blazhko stars ,",
    "mathematical models have been propounded . a model that aimed to describe the full fourier spectrum of the modulation",
    "was suggested by @xcite .",
    "the triplet was interpreted as the non - linear coupling of the main pulsation mode and a non - radial mode close to it , and many of their combination terms .",
    "however , no detailed confrontation of the possible predictions of this model with the observations ( e.g. on the amplitudes of the components of the multiplets ) has been performed . in other approaches (",

    "* hereafter bsp11 ) the multiplet structure is the simple result of the modulation of purely radial pulsation .    in their comprehensive study , bsp11 presented an analytical formalism ( applied in electronic signal transmission ) for the description of the light curves of blazhko rr lyrae stars .",
    "their model shows several light - curve characteristics similar to those observed in real blazhko stars .",
    "it was also claimed that the new light - curve solution drastically reduced the number of necessary parameters compared to the traditional methods .",
    "however , in bsp11 , the suggested method was not tested on real observational data .",
    "recently , @xcite made an attempt at applying the proposed new analytic modulation formalism to the kepler data of the complex blazhko star kic 6186029 = v445 lyr .",
    "although the model light curve showed the global properties of the observed one , the fitted light curve deviated from the observed data significantly in certain phases of the pulsation and the modulation ( see figure 16 in * ? ? ?",
    "the surprisingly high variance of the residuals was explained by method - specific and object - specific reasons .",
    "the method did not describe the migration of the bumps and humps , and as any ` stationary ' model , it was unable to follow an irregular , time - dependent phenomenon @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we look into the possible short - comings of the formalism introduced in bsp11 .",
    "the mathematical formalisms are given in sect . 2 , and the results are documented by the different fits of the light curve of a blazhko star , cm uma in sect .",
    "3 . as the modulation of cm uma is quite simple and regular ; no secondary modulation is detected , and no higher order than quintuplet modulation components are present in the fourier spectrum , therefore no bias of the results arises from any time - dependent irregularity of the modulation , what was the case in v445 lyr .",
    "the fourier decomposition of the light curve of blazhko rr  lyrae stars is a common technique to analyse their modulation properties . if @xmath0 and @xmath1 indicate the fundamental and modulation frequencies , in the typical fourier representation of the light curve , the harmonics ( @xmath2 ) and the multiplets ( triplets , quintuplets , septuplets , etc . :",
    "@xmath3 ) , as well as the harmonics of the blazhko frequency ( @xmath4 ) appear in the spectrum .",

    "they depend only on @xmath20 and the constant parameters of the fourier series eq .",

[ eq : four ] , [ eq : summod ] , [ amod ] and [ pmod ] , the harmonic orders of the pulsation and the different modulation series @xmath29 are limited by the accuracy of the observations .    the equality of eqs .",
    "[ eq : four ] and [ eq : summod ] demands that the time - history of a modulated star must be equally well described by either of them , with about the same variance of the residual , no matter which of the two formalisms is chosen .",
    "then , the question is raised why does the formalism of bsp11 give an inferior fit to the fourier decomposition ? if eq .",

    ", each harmonic term of the fourier series of the unmodulated light curve is modulated in amplitude and angle by the    @xmath30    and    @xmath31    formulae , respectively .",
    "we note here that in bsp11 , the constant term of the amplitude modulation function @xmath32 is identified with the difference between the magnitude and intensity mean values , and the constant term of the phase modulation function @xmath33 is contracted into the @xmath34 phase constant of the pulsation .    in eqs .",
    "[ bamod ] and [ bpmod ] , the bsp11 notation holds , with the exception of denoting the harmonic order of the pulsation with @xmath19 , instead of @xmath35 . here @xmath36 does not depend on the harmonic order of the unmodulated light curve in the least , which is inconsistent with eq .",
    "[ amod ] , while in @xmath37 , the harmonic order is not taken into account correctly with the sole multiplication of the modulation function by @xmath19 ( cf .",
    "eq .  [ pmod ] )",
    ".      due to the adoption of simplified formulae for the amplitude and angle modulations , bsp11 drastically reduce the number of parameters in their formalism .",
    "however , the outcome is an inferior fit compared to the fourier fit ( see details in sect .  [ case ] ) .",
    "the modulation assumed by bsp11 can be effectuated in electronic signal transmission , but , a priori , it is not known how the star modulates its pulsation light curve ( the ` signal ' ) .",
    "another serious problem is the change of the mean brightness during the blazhko cycle .",
    "obviously , the angle modulation can not contribute to it .",
    "bsp11 state that ` the formalism naturally explains the mean brightness variations ' , however , in their description it is directly proportional to the amplitude modulation .",
    "like their amplitude modulation formalism describes only an averaged harmonic order dependence , it can happen that the mean varies in a more complex way than the bsp11 formalism demands .",
    "in real stars , it is actually observed : e.g. , neither the magnitude nor the intensity averaged variation of the mean @xmath38 brightness of mw lyr is linearly proportional to the amplitude variation of the star during the blazhko cycle ( see figure 14 in * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "moreover , their difference is blazhko phase dependent , thus it can not be taken into account as a sole constant , as in bsp11 .    in principle , the summation of @xmath35 and @xmath39 in eqs .",
    "[ amod ] and [ pmod ] can start from zero ; the @xmath40 terms modify the amplitude and phase of the unmodulated light curve in each harmonic order .",
    "these constant terms are included in the @xmath41 and @xmath34 parameters of eq .",
    "[ eq : summod ] .",
    "therefore , the choice of the starting index of the summation from 1 does not have any consequence on the results .",
    "these extra terms express the differences between the mean light curve of a blazhko star and the light curve of an unmodulated rrab star with the same physical properties .",
    "the difference between the phase and amplitude modulation functions of bsp11 and the present paper ( modulation functions deduced from the fourier series ) has another consequence , too .",
    "the observations prove that the amplitude versus phase diagrams for the different harmonic orders of the light curve during the blazhko cycle show intrinsically different forms ( see details in sect .",
    "[ a - p ] ) .",
    "these diagrams determined according to the formalism of bsp11 are morphologically exactly the same for each harmonic order .",
    "this fact also refers to that the reduction of the degree of freedom ( decreasing the number of free parameters ) by bsp11 alters the real phase and amplitude relations of the observations .",
    "a further important question , which is generally regarded as trivial , is the definition / determination of the phase difference between the angle and the amplitude modulations . in eqs .",
    "[ amod ] and [ pmod ] , the angles depend on the starting epoch , but their difference @xmath42 is epoch independent . since the @xmath43 values can be different for the possible combinations of @xmath19 and @xmath35 , the definition of the phase difference between the angle and the amplitude modulations is not at all obvious .",
