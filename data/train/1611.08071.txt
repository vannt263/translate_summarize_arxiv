    "the work of hanbury - brown and twiss ( hbt ) about six decades ago inaugurating the field of intensity interferometry in radio astronomy as well as in the visible region constituted a major conceptual and experimental advance in the subject  @xcite .",
    "even though initially there was some confusion regarding interpretation , especially with regard to the quantum mechanical meaning of hbt correlations , it has since been recognized that it can be satisfactorily understood in terms of the statistical features of general states of classical ( optical ) wave fields .",
    "each such statistical state is describable by a hierarchy of correlation functions of various orders , and the hbt intensity - intensity correlation function stands one step beyond the more familiar young type amplitude - amplitude correlation function ( also called the two - point function describing partial coherence ) adequate for handling interference and diffraction phenomena . as with the bell inequalities which characterize proposed local realist extensions of quantum mechanics , and which can be violated by specific entangled quantum states , in the hbt case too particular quantum states of radiation",
    "may lead to correlations beyond what classical theory can explain .",
    "however this does not invalidate the fact that as a concept the hbt correlations are classically meaningful .",
    "in contrast to the hbt effect , the concept of geometric phases in quantum mechanics was uncovered by berry just over three decades ago  @xcite .",
    "his analysis was in the framework of adiabatic cyclic unitary evolution of pure quantum states obeying the time - dependent schrdinger equation - at the end of such evolution the state vector ( or wave function ) in hilbert space acquires a new previously unrecognized phase .",
    "later rapid developments greatly clarified the situation - the geometric phase is ( in the language of quantum mechanics ) a ray space quantity ; it can be defined even in nonadiabatic and noncyclic evolutions  @xcite ; and it is meaningful in purely classical wave optical situations , so it is not specifically quantum mechanical in origin .",
    "indeed it was soon realised that a phase found by pancharatnam in 1956 in classical polarization optics was an early precursor of the geometric phase in a nonadiabatic cyclic situation , with the poincar sphere of polarization optics playing the role of ray space in quantum mechanics  @xcite .",
    "subsequent work on the kinematic approach to the geometric phase has shown that the basic ingredient is the use of a complex hilbert space to describe ( pure ) states of a physical system , whether in quantum mechanics or in classical wave optics , and the associated ray space  @xcite .",
    "it has also brought out the relevance of the bargmann invariants for geometric phase theory  @xcite .",
    "while some attempts have been made to define geometric phases for mixed state evolution  @xcite , the emphasis at the basic level has been on pure states .    against this background ,",
    "some very interesting recent work has attempted to bring together these two independent developments in an unexpected manner  @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that in a carefully prepared experimental setup involving polarizing gadgets the expression for hbt correlations contains just the kind of phase angle - a solid angle on a two - sphere - involved in pancharatnam s work .",
    "this has been described as a nonlocal form of the pancharatnam phase , and it has been subjected to an experimental test as well  @xcite . in particular the theoretical",
    "analysis uses the photon description of light , involving quantized radiation field operators ; and the nonlocal effect has been characterized as a genuinely two - photon property not visible at the single photon level .",
    "the aims of the present work are two - fold : the first is to show that a purely classical statistical treatment of radiation is adequate to obtain the result of  @xcite , without having to use the photon picture based on the quantum theory of radiation ; the second is to significantly simplify the experimental set up while retaining the appearance of the pancharatnam solid angle in the expression for hbt correlations , and so to understand better whether it is indeed a nonlocal form of the pancharatnam phase which in any event is a particular instance of the geometric phase .",
    "the contents of the paper are arranged as follows : section  [ hbt ] describes the original hbt scheme of  @xcite from a purely classical point of view . in section  [ mz ]",
    "we give a scheme based on a mach - zender interferometer , where similar results are obtained without the paraxial approximation .",
    "section  [ conc ] offers some concluding remarks and the appendix describes the mathematical conventions used in this paper .",
    "in this section we present a completely classical treatment of the hbt correlations involving the pancharatnam solid angle , comparing with  @xcite at relevant points .    we assume two localized sources @xmath0 of quasimonochromatic radiation of mean frequency @xmath1 , in independent statistical states ( more fully specified below ) . as in fig .",
    "[ hbt_setup ] , they are located a distance @xmath2 apart , at points @xmath3 along the x - axis of a spatial coordinate system .",
    "light from each source reaches two detectors @xmath4 and @xmath5 at positions @xmath6 a distance @xmath7 apart , and at a distance @xmath8 from the sources in the overall direction of the positive z - axis , with @xmath9 .",
    "therefore the propagation vectors of light waves from @xmath0 to @xmath10 may all be treated as practically parallel and along the positive z - axis , i.e. we are in the paraxial regime .",
    "polarizers @xmath11 placed immediately after @xmath0 select right and left circular polarizations respectively . just before reaching detector @xmath4 , the superposed fields from @xmath12 and @xmath13 pass through a linear polarizer @xmath14 at an angle @xmath15 in the transverse x - y plane ; similarly another linear polarizer @xmath16 at angle @xmath17",
    "is placed just before @xmath5 . within the limits of the paraxial approximation all relevant electric field vectors",
    "can be taken to be two - component objects in the common transverse plane , with only @xmath18 and @xmath19 components .    in the absence of polarizers @xmath20 , using the kirchoff and paraxial approximations the positive frequency analytic signal electric field vectors reaching @xmath4 from @xmath21 are given by        @xmath22    here @xmath23 is the effective area of the source @xmath24 , @xmath25 is a dimensionless geometrical propagation factor from @xmath24 to @xmath4 , and @xmath26 is the electric field vector at @xmath24 at the retarded time .",
    "we treat this field as effectively constant over @xmath23 . with the polarizers in place as in fig .",
    "[ hbt_setup ] , the total field reaching @xmath4 is @xmath27 for @xmath28 at @xmath5 we have a similar expression by replacing @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 .",
    "the intensities at @xmath4 , @xmath5 are proportional to @xmath33 and @xmath34 respectively . since we",
    "are concerned with a completely classical discussion , it is appropriate to treat the fields @xmath35 as belonging to corresponding statistical ensembles , described by appropriate classical probability distributions . for our purposes these",
    "are represented by correlation functions of various orders  @xcite .",
    "( the time arguments will be seen to be irrelevant , and as @xmath36 the differences in retarded times will be neglected ) . denoting ensemble averages by @xmath37 ,",
    "the hbt correlation of intensities at @xmath4 and @xmath5 is proportional to @xmath38 this is a sum of sixteen terms , each a product of four factors , which can be labelled in sequence as @xmath39 according to which term from each of the four bracketed expressions is included in the product .",
    "thus for example @xmath40 we now specify the statistics of the source fields @xmath41 .",
    "we make the physically plausible assumption that @xmath42 and @xmath43 belong to two independent time stationary centered random phase unpolarized gaussian ensembles . recalling that @xmath42 ,  @xmath43 are two - component complex column vectors with @xmath18 and @xmath19 components labelled by @xmath44 , we have the basic ensemble averages @xmath45 and the derived averages @xmath46 here @xmath47 , @xmath48 are in general different real positive parameters .",
    "these expressions can be easily reproduced by a suitable centered gaussian probability distribution for the four complex amplitudes @xmath49 treating all polarizations uniformly .    with these assumptions on the sources @xmath12 , @xmath13",
    "there are only six nonvanishing terms in @xmath50 corresponding to the products @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "these can be easily computed using the basic properties of the @xmath57 polarization matrices @xmath58,@xmath59 , @xmath14 , @xmath16 given in the appendix .",
    "we find : @xmath60 .",
    "\\nonumber \\\\ \\label{gamma_in_terms}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the last term in @xmath50 is reminiscent of the pancharatnam phase in the geometric phase context .",
    "as shown in the appendix , the trace term has a phase related to the solid angle of a ` lune ' on a two - sphere enclosed by the two meridians at polar angles @xmath61 and @xmath62 , @xmath63 so after including the propagation factors @xmath64 in eqn.([field_amplitude ] ) the last term in @xmath50 becomes @xmath65    this is the contribution made by the presence of the polarizers to the hbt correlations in the setup of fig .  [ hbt_setup ] .",
    "it is clear that the result  ( [ geom_contrib_gamma ] ) depends strongly on the statistical properties  ( [ ensemble_properties1],[ensemble_properties2 ] ) assumed for the sources @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "even a slight change in them can lead to the final result for @xmath50 not being expressible in terms of any recognizable solid angle on a two - sphere at all .",
    "thus the fact that the pancharatnam solid angle has entered the result  ( [ geom_contrib_gamma ] ) seems to be not generic or robust .",
    "we point out that the quantum mechanical treatment in  @xcite involves defining photon annihilation and creation operators @xmath66 corresponding to the modes ` at the detectors ' @xmath4 , @xmath5 in terms of operators @xmath67 for modes ` at the sources ' @xmath12 , @xmath68 .",
    "the proposed relationships are exactly parallel to eqn .",
    "( [ total_elec_field ] ) above for classical analytic signals and read : @xmath69 and their adjoints for @xmath70 , @xmath71 .",
    "here @xmath72 is a column vector of two annihilation operators for the two photon polarization states ` at @xmath4 ' , @xmath70 is a row vector , etc .",
    "however , using the classical wave propagation formulae for photon operators in this way can not be expected to preserve the bosonic commutation relations , and the meaning of @xmath73 in terms of photon numbers .",
    "a proper quantum mechanical treatment needs to address these points in a satisfactory manner .    nevertheless , the fact that the use of polarizers in hbt correlation measurements leads to nontrivial consequences , while not surprising , is interesting in itself .",
    "the proposed interpretation in the language of pancharatnam ( and geometric ) phases is examined more closely in the next section .",
    "the paraxial approximation used in the previous section suggests that a common poincar sphere could be used to describe the polarization states of transverse electric fields propagating in any of the four practically parallel directions @xmath12 , @xmath13 to @xmath4 , @xmath5 .",
    "however it should also be mentioned that the analysis did not require following the evolution of the polarization state of any electric field two - vector along any closed circuit on a poincar sphere , which is usually a prerequisite to identify a pancharatnam phase .",
    "to understand the situation better we now consider a simpler scheme involving only two propagation directions , thus giving up the paraxial property altogether .",
    "this is similar to but considerably simpler than the one discussed in  @xcite .",
    "we should point out that in general , when there are plane waves simultaneously propagating in several different directions , one should in principle use a separate poincar sphere attached to each propagation direction to follow the polarization state of the field vector propagating in that direction . furthermore",
    ", for each propagation direction there is an independent @xmath74 freedom in the choice of transverse axes , and even a @xmath75 freedom in the choice of orthonormal polarization states , in setting up these individual poincar spheres .",
    "it is only when there are physically significant simplifying features , such as the paraxial condition for instance , that many different poincar spheres may be identified with one another .",
    "we consider a setup with two sources or input ports @xmath76 producing plane electromagnetic waves of common frequency @xmath1 , propagating along the positive @xmath77 and @xmath18 axes respectively , as in fig .  [ mz_setup ] ( the @xmath19 axis then points out of the page ) .",
    "these waves pass through circular polarizers @xmath58 located close to the sources .",
    "the field from @xmath78 is described by a two - component complex column vector @xmath79 made up of its @xmath18 and @xmath19 components , while @xmath80 from @xmath81 is similarly described by its @xmath19 and @xmath77 components : @xmath82 this is a natural convention for the present non - paraxial situation .",
    "the plane wave factors are @xmath83 for @xmath79 and @xmath84 for @xmath80 , but in the sequel these can be omitted .    after the polarizers @xmath58",
    "the two plane waves arrive at a half - silvered plane mirror @xmath85 placed at an angle of @xmath86 bisecting the @xmath77 and @xmath18 axes .",
    "each plane wave is partially transmitted and partially reflected by @xmath85 , the intensities divided equally . thus @xmath79 gives rise to reflected @xmath87 and transmitted @xmath88 , while @xmath80 gives rise to transmitted @xmath89 and reflected @xmath90 .",
    "both @xmath89 and @xmath87 are described like @xmath80 in  ( [ column_fields ] ) , @xmath88 and @xmath90 like @xmath79 . at the mirror",
    ", the condition that there be no tangential field ( and the stated reduction in intensity ) determines @xmath87 in terms of @xmath79 , and @xmath90 in terms of @xmath80 . keeping in mind the conventions  ( [ column_fields ] )",
    ", it is seen that mirror reflection is expressed by the matrix @xmath91 ( pauli matrix @xmath92 as explained in eqn .",
    "( [ pol_pauli ] ) ) .",
    "since we are dealing with circular polarizations , upon reflection rcp and lcp get interchanged , while upon transmission they each remain unchanged . all in all , the two sets of reflected and transmitted waves are : @xmath93 the projection matrix @xmath58 of eq .",
    "( [ polarizer_rep ] ) can be used consistently for both @xmath79 and @xmath80 , using the conventions([column_fields ] ) .",
    "after superposition , @xmath94 passes through a linear polarizer @xmath14 ( in the @xmath95 plane ) , while @xmath96 passes through @xmath16 ( in the @xmath97 plane ) .",
    "each of these superpositions consists of one rcp wave and one lcp wave .",
    "they are then received at detectors @xmath98 , @xmath99 respectively , after having traversed distances @xmath100 and @xmath101 from the mirror @xmath85 . the total fields reaching the detectors are : @xmath102 therefore the hbt correlation of the two intensities is @xmath103",
    "let us assume the same statistical properties for @xmath104 here as for @xmath105 in section  [ hbt ] : independent , time stationary , centred random phase unpolarized gaussian ensembles .",
    "then eqns.([ensemble_properties1],[ensemble_properties2 ] ) are again valid with @xmath106 . in expression  ( [ gamma22_mz ] ) there are again sixteen terms of which ( as in section  [ hbt ] ) only 1111 , 1122 , 1221 , 2112 , 2211 and 2222 are nonzero .",
    "these have the values : @xmath107 the final result for the hbt correlations is : @xmath108 the similarity to the expressions and results in section  [ hbt ] is evident .",
    "however since now the two propagation directions are mutually perpendicular , there is no privileged poincar sphere in the problem .",
    "it is true that the phase of the trace in eq .",
    "( [ gamma22_mz_geom ] ) is most simply viewed as the solid angle of a lune on a two - sphere , but this two - sphere is useful for calculational purposes alone and can not be identified in any compelling manner with any physically meaningful poincar sphere in the present setup .",
    "for this reason it seems not possible to interpret the phase in eq(3.6 ) as a nonlocal pancharatnam phase , indeed as a geometrical phase at all .",
    "added to this is the fact that once again even a small change in the statistical properties of @xmath79 and @xmath80 is likely to alter the result  ( [ gamma22_mz_geom ] ) completely in structure .",
    "the attempt in  @xcite to bring together the ideas of hbt correlations and pancharatnam - or more generally geometric - phases is a very appealing one , even though our analysis suggests that this has not been achieved . in discussions of quantum measurement theory , the appearance of nonlocality is in connection with composite systems in entangled states of spatially separated subsystems and observations on them . since in our classical treatment",
    "we obtain the same expression for hbt correlations as found in  @xcite , it is clear that there is no quantum nonlocality involved .",
    "further the way in which the pancharatnam - like solid angle appears here does not depend on transporting a pure state of any system over a closed path in any parameter or state space ; hence while it reveals an interesting feature of hbt correlations which have indeed been experimentally verified  @xcite , its interpretation as a pancharatnam phase seems open to question .    in our view , from a wider perspective , the situation under discussion has similarities to the van cittert - zernike theorem in partial coherence theory - even with a spatially incoherent source , propagation can produce partial coherence at the amplitude level . in a similar manner , in the case of hbt correlations too we see that even if the source intensities are uncorrelated , after propagation nontrivial hbt correlations can develop , since each detector ( as in figures 1 and 2 ) receives inputs from each source .",
    "an element of nonlocality here is quite natural since wave propagation involves spreading in space .",
    "if polarizers are placed on the paths of propagating beams , the fact that they can influence the hbt correlations is also quite natural .",
    "however for this to be interpretable in geometric phase terms it seems necessary to have an underlying complex hilbert space structure and the pure state evolution concept in a physically significant manner .",
    "this feature is absent in the experimental setups and theoretical analysis described in sections  [ hbt ] and  [ mz ] .",
    "while we have shown that an entirely classical treatment suffices to obtain the results of  @xcite there are states of radiation which are genuinely non classical and for which hbt correlations take values beyond the classical range of possibilities .",
    "such states can certainly be used in the experimental setups of sections ii and iii .",
    "a proper quantum mechanical treatment capable of handling such states must respect the fundamental commutation relations describing photons .",
    "this analysis will be presented elsewhere .",
    "we collect here some elementary formulae concerning @xmath109 polarization matrices needed in the text .",
    "the matrices @xmath110 are hermitian projections onto corresponding two - component column vectors : @xmath111 the @xmath112 matrices of polarization optics are a cyclic rearrangement of the pauli matrices @xmath113 of quantum mechanics : @xmath114 in terms of them we have @xmath115 thus the circular polarization projectors @xmath58 , @xmath59 correspond to the n and s poles , @xmath116 , on the poincar sphere ; while the linear polarization projector @xmath117 maps to @xmath118 on the equator .",
    "the elementary traces needed in eqn.([gamma_in_terms ] ) are @xmath119 the nontrivial trace in eqn.([gamma_in_terms ] ) is a complex quantity : @xmath120 this @xmath121 is a four - vertex bargmann invariant , whose phase is known to be ( the negative of ) a geometric phase .",
    "more precisely , @xmath122 , where @xmath123 is the solid angle on the poincar sphere enclosed by the meridian from n to s at polar angle @xmath61 followed by the meridian from @xmath124 to @xmath125 at polar angle @xmath62 : @xmath126 in the scheme of fig .",
    "[ mz_setup ] in section  iii , reflection at a mirror amounts to action on two - component electric field vectors @xmath79 , @xmath80 by the matrix @xmath127 . with respect to the polarization",
    "matrices the properties of @xmath91 are : @xmath128 these are relevant in connection with eqns .",
