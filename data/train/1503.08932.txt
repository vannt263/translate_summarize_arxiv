    "according to the standard model of the primordial star formation process , the very first stars , the so - called population  iii ( or pop .",
    "iii ) stars form within dark matter ( dm ) halos with virial temperature @xmath1 k and masses @xmath2 @xmath3 that collapsed at redshift @xmath4 25 - 30 or above ( @xcite ) .",
    "the hydrogen atoms in the dm halos combine with the small abundances of free electrons via @xmath5 , followed by @xmath6 , where the free electrons act as catalysts and are present as residue from the epoch of recombination at @xmath4 1100 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the typical fractional abundances of h@xmath0 of @xmath7 are sufficient to permit the primordial gas in the minihalos to cool as it collapses ( see , e.g.  @xcite ) via h@xmath0 rotational and vibrational line emission .",
    "this occurs until the gas reaches a temperature @xmath8 200k @xcite at a density of @xmath9@xmath10 , at which point the h@xmath0 energy levels move into the local thermodynamical equilibrium ( lte ) with the kinetic temperature of the gas , and the resulting cooling time becomes longer than the free - fall of the gas .",
    "the gas now heats up slightly as the collapse proceeds .",
    "this transition from cooling to heating with increasing density sets a characteristic jeans length , allowing the gas to fragment with jeans mass of @xmath11 @xmath8 1000@xmath3 at typical temperatures of @xmath12k and number densities @xmath13@xmath10 ( @xcite ) .",
    "once the gas reaches a number density of @xmath14@xmath10 , further h@xmath0 formation is possible via the 3-body reactions @xcite : @xmath15 @xmath16 unfortunately , the rate coefficients for the above set of reactions are very uncertain in the temperature regime which is applicable to pop .",
    "iii star formation , with the current estimates in the literature spanning two orders of magnitude ( see @xcite for discussion ) . however , independent of the choice of rate coefficient , calculations of the gravitational collapse of primordial gas show that by a number density of @xmath14@xmath10 , almost all the atomic hydrogen is converted to h@xmath0 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the sudden formation of @xmath17 has two interesting effects .",
    "first , the process is accompanied by heating , since 4.4 ev is released for every h@xmath0 molecule that is formed .",
    "if the formation rate is fast enough , this heating can momentarily stall the collapse against collapse . on the other hand ,",
    "the ability of the gas to cool is proportional to ( among other things ) the fractional abundance of h@xmath0 , so the more h@xmath0 is formed , the more the gas can cool . in practise ,",
    "the interplay between these two phenomena is complex , and depends crucially on the adopted rates for the 3-body reactions @xcite . under certain conditions ,",
    "a chemo - thermal instability can also occur that may promote the gas to fragment @xcite .",
    "in addition to any fragmentation induced by the chemo - thermal instability , recent simulations conclude that the disk around the first primordial protostar becomes gravitationally unstable and forms a multiple system with low - mass protostars instead of a single protostar @xcite .",
    "this can occur on timescales as short as 10 to 100 years after the formation of the first object .",
    "@xcite show that the fragmentation of this disc results from the fact that the disc is unable to accrete onto the protostar faster than it accretes from the in - falling envelope .",
    "the study by @xcite used both sph and amr simulations to conclude that the choice of 3-body - rate coefficients can introduce significant uncertainty into the radial velocity , temperature and accretion rate , and therefore can affect the rate at which the protostellar disc is fed .",
    "this has recently been verified by @xcite , who used both old rates and newly calculated improved rate given by @xcite , to reach similar conclusion as @xcite .",
    "although they found compressed spiral arms , with strong density contrast between the arms and embedding medium , these simulations were unable to follow the evolution beyond the formation of the protostar , and so could not address the long - term behaviour of the disc structure .",
    "however the degree to which the disc fragmentation depends on the chemical uncertainties in the 3-body h@xmath0 formation rate has never been systematically tested .",
    "previous studies did not include sink particles , and could not study the fragmentation that occurs once the first object is formed . in this work we focus on the effect that the choice of 3-body reaction rate has on the fragmentation of the primordial gas .",
    "we investigate two minihaloshalos obtained from the cosmological simulations of @xcite , which used the hydrodynamic moving mesh code _ arepo _",
    "we use the snapshots from these simulations at a point when the central number density is just below @xmath18 @xmath10  comfortably before the onset of the 3-body reactions  as the starting point for this project . interpreting the mesh - generating points of _ arepo _ as lagrangian fluids particles",
    ", we then use the _ arepo _ output as the initial conditions for our gadget-2 @xcite implementation .",
    "the modifications to the standard gadget-2 include a time - dependent chemical network for primordial gas , and a sink particles to capture the formation of collapsing protostellar cores @xcite . a fuller description of the code and its features can be found in @xcite .",
    "the conversion from the moving mesh to smoothed - particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) formalism is the same as that performed by @xcite , and indeed the minihalos are identical , both in terms of the baryonic and dark matter content .",
    "the original _ arepo _ simulations resolve the jeans length with 128 cells @xcite , at which point further refinement is deactivated , resulting in roughly constant mass particles within central @xmath19 1000 au .",
    "however , to investigate the effect of 3-body h@xmath0 reactions , here we use the intermediate _ arepo _ snapshots ( when the central number density @xmath20 @xmath10 ) as the starting point .",
    "although the initial size of the minihalos are @xmath19 3 pc , all the fragmentation and accretion take place in the central region of the halos where the sph particle masses are roughly 10@xmath21 @xmath3 . in gadget-2 simulation",
    "the mass resolution for 100 sph particles ( e.g. @xcite ) is @xmath19 10@xmath22 @xmath3 .",
    "the chemical and thermodynamical treatment of the gas in the _ arepo _ simulations of @xcite is also identical to those in our gadget-2 implementation for the range of densities that are studied in this paper .",
    "more details of the initial conditions for this study are given below .",
    "of the various rates available in the literature for the 3-body h@xmath0 formation reactions , we choose the extreme rate coefficients : the slowest of which is @xcite ( hereafter abn02 ) alongside that of @xcite which provides the fastest of the rates ( hereafter fh07 ) .",
    "we have used the collisional - dissociation rate in the lte limit as described in @xcite . for our sph calculation",
    "we used a temperature - dependent value calculated via the principle of detailed balanced . for",
    "the abn02 runs , data from @xcite are used for low density ( and low temperature , @xmath23 k ) cases , and a power law ( described in table 1 ) for high density and temperatures . for fh07 runs , we used the rates given in @xcite . for the radiative cooling rate",
    ", we use sobolev approximation to calculate it in the optically thick region , as described in detail in @xcite and @xcite .",

    ", we resolve the halo gas and its velocity structure significantly better than in the sph models of our previous study @xcite .",
    "however , we note that none of the existing numerical calculations are able to fully resolve the turbulent cascade in the halo gas and do justice to the large reynolds numbers ( of @xmath41 or above ) that characterise the accretion flow ( see , e.g.  chapter 4 in * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "each of the minihalos are simulated with the two contrasting 3-body reaction rates , resulting in 4 simulations in total .",
    "the different minihalos allow us to distinguish between those features of the high - density collapse / evolution that are caused by the chemo - thermal differences arising from the reaction rates , and those features which result from cosmic variance ( i.e. differences caused by the formation of the minihalos ) .",
    "as collapse progresses in the central region of the cloud , sink particles are created once the number density of the gas reaches 5 @xmath42@xmath10 , at which point the gas has a temperature of around 1000k .",
    "the corresponding jeans mass at this density and temperature is 0.06@xmath38 , so our calculations for both of the halos are well resolved .",
    "we replace a candidate particle by a sink particle ( see , e.g. @xcite ) that can accrete gas particles within its accretion radius @xmath43 that we fix at 6 au , which is the jeans radius at the density threshold for sink creation .",
    "we also prevent sink particles from forming within @xmath44 of one another in order to avoid spurious formation of new sink particles out of gas that , in reality , would by accreted by a neighbouring sink particle .",
    "lastly , gravitational interactions between sinks , and between the sinks and the gas , are softened using a fixed softening parameter of 1.2 au for the sinks .",
    "we run our simulations until a mass of @xmath45 m@xmath46 has been accreted by all the sink particles.the final time scales range between @xmath47 yr due to the physical differences between the minihalos and the 3-body h@xmath0 formation rates .",
    "[ sec : instability ]     radially binned , mass - weighted averages of physical quantities for different 3-body h@xmath0 formation rate ( red : abn02 , green : fh07 ) of two different cosmological halos ( dotted : halo1 , solid : halo2 ) , are compared just before the first protostar forms .",
    "the enclosed mass ( a ) , h@xmath0 fraction ( b ) , temperature ( c ) , ratio of cooling time to free - fall time ( d ) and ratio of free - fall time to sound - crossing time ( e ) are plotted as a function of number density . ,",
    "in this section we examine the physical conditions in the gas once the central region has collapsed to a density of @xmath48 @xmath10 .",
    "the radial profiles of the gas for the two different halos and two different 3-body rates are shown in figure [ fig : gas_props ] .",
    "the panels show mass - weighted averages of the properties of individual sph particles within radial logarithmic bins .",
    "panel a shows the mass enclosed as a function of the number density , and we see that it displays a rough power - law over most of the density range covered here .",
    "this simply follows from the radial power - law in the density which is typical for primordial gas : @xmath49 ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we see that there are slight differences between the profiles for the two rates , but these are also comparable to the differences between the two halos .    in panel b , we see the rapid rise in the h@xmath0 fraction with increasing density that arises from the 3-body reactions . here",
    "we see a clear difference between the two rates , with the runs with fh07 producing most of the h@xmath0 by a density of @xmath41 @xmath10 , while the abn02 runs are only starting to produce h@xmath0 by the time this density is reached . as the rates are a strong function of density , we see very little difference in the h@xmath0 fractions between the two halos .    the mean temperature as a function of the number density is shown in panel c. we find that the gas is significantly cooler , up to a factor of 2 , around density @xmath50 @xmath10 , in the fh07 halos than in those using abn02 .",
    "the differences in temperature - density evolution start around a number density of @xmath51 @xmath10 , once the h@xmath0 abundance in the fh07 case has increased by an order of magnitude .",
    "again , we find that there is little difference between evolution of halos 1 and 2 in this panel , implying that the chemical state of the gas is more important for the temperature evolution than any differences in the halo properties . curves in panels a , b and c are consistent with the results of @xcite .",
    "in this section we study the difference in mass accretion associated with the cloud collapse , that can arise due to the choice of 3-body reaction rates . in what follows",
    ", we will first study the accretion rate as predicted by the properties of the gas in the clouds just before the first sink particle forms .",
    "we will then examine the accretion rate as measured by the sink particles themselves .",
    "the accretion rate can be estimated from the radial gas profiles using , @xmath52 this has been shown to be a good estimate of the accretion rate @xcite .",
    "in addition , one can define an accretion time from , @xmath53    since accretion is related to infall velocity , we also discuss the corresponding radial and rotational velocities .",
    "figure  [ vel ] shows these physical quantities as the function of enclosed mass for all the simulations , using the radial profiles in the gas just before the formation of the first sink particle .",
    "the left panel of figure  [ vel ] in the clockwise order , shows the accretion rate , radial velocity , radial velocity over sound speed and accretion time respectively .",
    "similarly the right panel of figure  [ vel ] shows the rotational velocity , radial velocity over rotational velocity , rotational velocity over keplerian velocity and rotational velocity over sound speed respectively in the clockwise order .",
    "we note that the mass accretion rate ( @xmath54 ) for all the simulations has a maximum at an enclosed mass @xmath8 12 @xmath55 . given that h@xmath0 line - cooling becomes optically thick at the corresponding densities for this enclosed mass , it makes sense that @xmath54 for all the simulations converge at this mass scale , as the gas loses its ability to cool efficiently . in general the differences in accretion rates caused by the choice of 3-body formation rate",
    "are small , around 25 percent .",
    "the differences between the rates in different halos are much larger , at around a factor of 2 for masses below a few tens of solar mass .",
    "however we see from the top left panel of figure [ vel ] that once the mass approaches 100@xmath56 , the difference in the accretion rates can be large , approaching an order of magnitude .",
    "we conclude that halo - to - halo variations will play a larger role in the accretion rates than chemical uncertainties .",
    "the choice of 3-body rate coefficient introduces difference in radial velocity of @xmath57 km s@xmath26",
    ". we also note that the radial velocities for both rates are substantially lower than the rotational velocities .",
    "the gas particles spiral inwards with trajectories following a combination of gravitational attraction and angular momentum conservation .",
    "all clouds are sub - keplerian .",
    "however , there is a slight tendency for the gas to be more rotationally supported in the fh07 runs  at least for the inner 10@xmath56 of gas .",
    "we can compare these results with both the amr and sph simulations of @xcite .",
    "our high - resolution study also concludes that the difference in the 3-body @xmath58 formation rates significantly affect the dynamical behaviour of the collapsing gas .",
    "the uncertainty in the velocity structure has also been investigated by @xcite using hydrodynamics code enzo .",
    "they also found that there are relatively large differences in the radial velocities of about @xmath59 km s@xmath26 depending on the halo distribution as well as 3-body h@xmath0 formation rates .",
    "although there is scatter in the velocities for abn02 and fh07 rates , the scatter also exists in the velocities for both halo1 and halo2 .",
    "we again conclude that the halo - to - halo differences in the velocity structure is , in general , more pronounced than that caused by the differences in the chemical reaction rates .",
    "the number of bonnor - ebert masses ( @xmath60 ) in the central dense volume is plotted as a function of enclosed mass , just before formation of first protostar .",
    "the degree of gravitational instability for fh07 within the central dense regime is larger than abn02 , indicating larger opportunity for the gas to fragment in the fh07 case , than in the abn02 simulations.,width=307 ]    we have shown in section [ sec : instability ] that the temperature of the gas at high densities , such as those in disc , depends on the choice of adopted 3-body h@xmath0 formation rate . in this section ,",
    "we study how the gas fragments as it evolves beyond the formation of the first collapsing core .",
    "our discussion will first focus on the properties of the gas , to see whether there is any hint of the future evolution already present before the first sink particle forms .",
    "we will then compare the properties of the sink particles in the simulations and discuss the differences .",
    "one useful measure of the ability of the gas to fragment is the ratio of the thermal to gravitational energy .",
    "this can be represented by the number of bonnor - ebert masses ( @xmath61 ) contained in the central dense volume ( @xcite ) .",
    "we therefore investigate the changes in the number ( i.e , @xmath62 ) for each of our simulations and how it varies with the enclosed gas mass , similar to the analysis performed by @xcite .",
    "we computed the bonnor - ebert mass as the mass - weighted average within the logarithmic radial bin , @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the sound speed , @xmath65 is the external pressure that we assume to be equal to the local gas pressure , @xmath66 is the mean molecular weight and @xmath67 is the adiabatic index respectively .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ mbe ] . note that the ratio @xmath62 is equivalent to the ratio of fragmentation timescale to that of accretion , @xmath68 . once again",
    ", these snapshots were taken immediately before the formation of the first protostar .",
    "the dashed lines represent the case when fragmentation timescale equals the accretion timescale .",
    "while we see that there are differences between the mass profiles of the fh07 and abn02 runs , the effects are , once again , not substantial .",
    "however , in the case of @xmath62 we see that the fh07 runs have a differently shaped profile from the abn02 runs ( top panel of fig .",
    "[ mbe ] ) . in the fh07 case",
    ", the profiles are peaked at characteristic mass of 1 - 2@xmath69 .",
    "in contrast , the abn02 runs do not display such a peak , and it is less clear whether these runs would favour a particular mass for fragmentation .",
    "if the ratio @xmath70 the gas enclosed in the shells are accreted faster than it can fragment . as a result",
    "fewer new protostars are formed and the available mass contributes to the mass growth of the existing ones @xcite . in our case",
    "we find @xmath71 , i.e. , the gas in the shells can fragment faster than it is accreted by the central dense clump , favouring low - mass protostars .         therefore by considering the radial density profiles before the onset of sink formation we conclude that gas in fh07 case is perhaps more likely to fragment than in the abn02 case .",
    "next we study how the gas fragments at later epochs after formation of the first sink particle .",
    "we follow the simulations until @xmath72 have been converted into , or accreted onto , sink particles .",
    "we have calculated the total mass accretion rate by all the sinks particles .",
    "although fragmentation may depend on the way sink particles are modelled , our implementation ( section 2.2 ) takes considerable care to avoid what is often called artificial fragmentation and the spurious formation of sink particles ( further details are found in @xcite , see also @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ) .",
    "the column density and column - weighted temperature distribution in the inner 2000 au at the end of the simulations are shown in figure [ disk_image ] . in all cases",
    "we see that the simulations exhibit disc structure on several scales within this central region .",
    "it is not surprising , given the high levels of rotational support seen in right - hand panel in figure [ vel ] .",
    "we also see that the temperatures in the disc are slightly less in the case with the fh07 rate , due to the increased h@xmath0 fraction .",
    "however from these images it is clear that all simulations fragment to form a small-@xmath73 system within the time that @xmath74 of material is accreted onto sink particles .",
    "figure [ imf]a shows the time evolution of total mass accretion rate onto the sinks ( same as figure [ vel ] ) .",
    "the plot shows that mass accretion rate for abn02 is larger than the fh07 rate . for both rates ,",
    "dm@xmath75/dt decreases with time .",
    "after @xmath76 years , further sink particles form , and the total accretion rate increases again , however , now with large temporal variations . in figure [ imf]b",
    ", we plot the mass accretion rate as a function of total sink mass .",
    "figure [ imf]c shows the time evolution of the total mass in sinks and figure [ imf]d shows the maximum sink mass in the period over which the sink formation occurs .",
    "we see that the simulations employing the abn02 rate produce a maximum sink mass that is consistently above the fh07 rate , for a given halo . however , the difference is less than a factor of 2 and is similar to the inter - halo difference .",
    "when we examine figure [ imf]e , which shows the total number of sink particle versus the total mass in all sinks , we see a similar behaviour : the differences between the runs with different rates can be a factor of two .",
    "although in this case the halo - to - halo differences are less pronounced .",
    "we caution the reader that our simulations do not include feedback effects from nascent protostars .",
    "we therefore restrain ourselves from following the dynamical evolution of the embedded stellar system over very long timescales .",
    "we end our calculations before we expect that radiative and mechanical feedback changes the thermal as well as chemical state  and as a consequence  also modifies the fragmentation behavior of the remaining gas ( see , e.g. , the discussion in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , or @xcite ) .",
    "we have investigated the effects of different proposed 3-body h@xmath0 formation rates during the collapse of primordial star - forming clouds and analysed their influence on the resulting fragmentation behaviour of the gas .",
    "we compared the rates proposed by @xcite and by @xcite , which span two orders of magnitude .",
    "we follow the chemical and thermal evolution of the primordial gas in two different minihalos in order to assess differences introduced by varying halo parameters .",
    "we find that the uncertainty in the 3-body h@xmath0 formation rates leads to the differences in the chemical state of the gas which is more important for the thermal evolution of the clouds than any differences in the halo properties .",
    "the halo to halo variation affects the dynamical evolution of the gas and mass - accretion more than the chemical uncertainties .",
    "we also find that the simulations employing the @xcite rate to produce on average fewer and more massive fragments compared to those calculations using the @xcite rate ( consistent with the results of @xcite which however did not use sink particles ) .",
    "this difference of roughly a factor of two , however , is comparable to the halo - to - halo variation .",
    "this is similar to the results reported by @xcite with added advantage of using sink particles .    in summary ,",
    "we find that the variations introduced to the mass distribution of primordial stars introduced by the uncertainties in the three - body h@xmath0 formation rate is of similar order to the fluctuations introduced by difference in the halo properties .",
