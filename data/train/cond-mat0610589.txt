    "it has recently been shown that copt@xmath0 ultrathin films and nanoclusters , grown by molecular beam epitaxy ( mbe ) , display perpendicular magnetic anisotropy ( pma ) with potential applications in high density magnetic storage media @xcite .",
    "previous simulations of copt@xmath0 nanocluster growth on a weakly interacting substrate suggested that pma originates from the combined effects of pt surface segregation and cluster shape @xcite .",
    "as suggested by experiments on co - pt multilayer systems @xcite , out - of - plane copt bonds contribute to a magnetic anisotropy energy that tends to align the co - moments along the bond direction and thus favours pma .",
    "when a perpendicular magnetization is induced by a magnetic field applied during growth , this type of a local magnetic anisotropy energy can be expected to lead to an additional preference of out - of - plane relative to in - plane nearest neighbour co - pt pairs .",
    "mbe - growth of copt@xmath0-clusters in a perpendicular field should therefore improve the formation of pma in nanoclusters .    in order to demonstrate this latter effect we perform kinetic monte carlo simulations of growth within a binary alloy model , supplemented by a magnetic anisotropy energy @xmath3 based on co - pt bond contributions .",
    "isotropic magnetic interactions , on the other hand , do not contribute in a significant way to any growth - induced structural anisotropy .",
    "their main effect in growth simulations is a small renormalization of chemical interactions , which can be neglected .",
    "however , both types of magnetic interactions in co - pt and related fcc - alloys can lead to an intriguing interplay between structural ordering phenomena and magnetism in samples at equilibrium @xcite . we confirm this by comparing predictions of landau theory with equilibrium monte carlo simulations .",
    "the model we consider refers to binary fcc - alloys with composition ab@xmath0 . a minimal set of chemical interactions between the atoms",
    "is chosen that is consistent with the main processes during structure formation : atomic migration in different local environments , surface segregation of the majority atoms and ordering with l1@xmath1-symmetry . on a semiquantitative level",
    ", these features can be reproduced by effective chemical interactions @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 acting between nearest neighbour @xmath7 or @xmath8-atoms on an fcc lattice .",
    "the linear combinations @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 determine the bulk ordering temperature @xmath12 @xcite , the degree of surface segregation of one atomic species and the average atomic binding energy , respectively . following previous work @xcite , we adapt our model to copt@xmath0 ( a = co , b = pt ) , where @xmath13k , and pt - surface segregation is strong ( nearly 100 % @xcite ) .",
    "compatible parameters are @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 , where we have used @xmath17mev , corresponding to @xmath18k , as our energy unit .",
    "the value for @xmath19 describes the average binding energy for intermediate coordination numbers experienced by atoms within the growth zone near the cluster surface .",
    "the substrate ( 111 ) surface is weakly attractive with a potential @xmath20 that acts on adatoms in the first layer . compared to a pt(111 ) surface with three bonds of typical strength @xmath19 , this amounts to about @xmath21 of the energy of a single pt - pt bond .",
    "the elementary processes in our continuous time kinetic monte carlo algorithm , which drive the cluster growth , are _",
    "( i ) _ codeposition of @xmath7- and @xmath8-atoms with ratio 1:3 and total flux @xmath22 , _ ( ii ) _ hopping of atoms to vacant nearest neighbour sites , and _ ( iii ) _ direct exchange of unlike nearest neighbour atoms ; one of them is an adatom with low coordination ( 3 to 5 ) on top of a terrace and the other one a highly coordinated atom ( coordination 8 to 10 ) underneath .",
    "such exchange processes facilitate pt segregation to the surface , which otherwise becomes kinetically hindered through the incoming flux . in our simulations",
    "we choose @xmath23 monolayers per second .",
    "as far as possible , other kinetic parameters are adapted from known diffusion data : jump rates for a and b atoms are of the form @xmath24 $ ] where @xmath25 s@xmath26 is the attempt frequency , @xmath27 @xcite is the diffusion barrier , and @xmath28 denotes the energy difference before and after the jump .",
    "direct exchange processes among pairs of unlike atoms are subjected to an increased barrier @xmath29 with @xmath30 . for more details on that model and on the choice of these parameters we refer to @xcite .",
    "as explained in the introduction , pma in copt@xmath0-nanoclusters can be related to a structural anisotropy , expressed by the parameter @xmath31 which is defined in terms of the difference between numbers of co - pt bonds out of plane , @xmath32 , and in plane , @xmath33 .",
    "@xmath34 is the total number of atoms in the cluster .",
    "the underlying analysis @xcite can in particular account for the temperature window where pma occurs , which lies below the onset of l1@xmath1 ordering .",
    "furthermore , it provides an interpretation of pma in terms of cluster size and shape , and the degree of pt - surface segregation .",
    "the associated magnetic model assumes a local crystalline anisotropy energy @xmath3 , that involves only co - moments @xmath35 as its dominant part . within a bond picture ,",
    "each co - atom experiences an anisotropy energy that is a sum over co - pt bond contributions @xmath36 here @xmath37 is a bond vector connecting the co - atom with one of its nearest neighbour pt atoms , and @xmath38ev is a parameter deduced from the interfacial part of the measured magnetic anisotropy of co - pt multilayers @xcite .",
    "we remark that these measurements also appear to justify the bond model implied by ( [ bond ] ) , when two different interfacial orientations are compared . for ( 111 ) interfaces the anisotropy energy per surface area",
    "is found about twice as large as for the ( 100 ) orientation .",
    "considering the different angles of bonds to the surface and the different packings , equation ( [ bond ] ) indeed can reproduce this difference with one consistent value for @xmath7 . since @xmath39 , spin alignment along a co - pt bond is favoured .",
    "certainly , @xmath7 is small relative to the chemical interactions @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 as well as @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "hence , in the absence of a magnetic field it is justified in a first approximation to neglect ( [ bond ] ) in simulating growth , but to include it _ a posteriori _ in order to relate a given cluster structure to its magnetic properties .",
    "however , when an external magnetic field is applied , we show here that inclusion of the magnetic anisotropy energy ( [ bond ] ) in the growth process itself leads to a small but notable change in the clusters short range order such that pma gets enhanced @xcite . to demonstrate this",
    ", we apply a strong field @xmath42 perpendicular to the substrate that drives the magnetization towards saturation .",
    "co - moments @xmath35 in ( [ bond ] ) are then aligned along the [ 111 ] direction , which introduces an asymmetry in the probabilities for jumps that form or break copt - bonds . for in - plane bonds , ( [ bond ] ) gives no contribution , whereas the energy of an out - of - plane co - pt bond is changed from @xmath5 to @xmath43 in the fcc lattice geometry .",
    "clearly , the expected magnetic field effects on growth are small in view of the smallness of the magnetic anisotropy parameter @xmath7 in ( [ bond ] ) . to obtain reliable results for the change in the structural anisotropy parameter @xmath44 with and without the field , we have carried out simulations including several much larger parameters @xmath7 up to @xmath45 .",
    "note that the energy unit chosen ( see above ) implies that the physical value @xmath46ev corresponds to @xmath47 .",
    "results for those different artificial @xmath7-values will be used in turn to extract the physical change of @xmath44 by interpolation .    from this analysis",
    "we first show results for the dependence @xmath48 on cluster size n , see figure  1 .",
    "all data sets referring to different @xmath7 exhibit an approximate linearity in @xmath49 , @xmath50 concerning the @xmath34-dependence , this confirms that the structural anisotropy essentially is a surface effect yield in addition a non - zero bulk contribution to @xmath44 which , however , is negligibly small in comparison with @xmath44-values for clusters with @xmath51 atoms . ] .",
    "the figure includes the case @xmath52 , represented by open symbols .",
    "this data formally corresponds to zero magnetic field , because for @xmath53 at the temperatures considered the co - moments @xmath35 are oriented randomly so that ( [ bond ] ) gives no contribution to @xmath44 .",
    "the important observation is that @xmath54 for fixed @xmath34 significantly increases with @xmath7 .",
    "figure 2 explicitly shows that the behaviour of the coefficient @xmath55 obtained from fits according to ( [ linearity ] ) , appears to be consistent with a linear @xmath7-dependence .",
    "assuming linearity even in the limit @xmath56 , we obtain @xmath57 for the physical value @xmath47 .",
    "depending on cluster size @xmath34 in the presence of the saturation field @xmath42 at temperature @xmath58 @xmath59k ) .",
    "averages are performed over 20 clusters .",
    "full lines display linearity in @xmath49 .",
    "open symbols are equivalent to the case of zero magnetic field . ]",
    "this result immediately translates to the magnetic field - dependence of the structural part of the total magnetic anisotropy energy @xmath60 , which is proportional to @xmath61 . using ( [ linearity ] )",
    ", we can write @xmath62 again with the relative change @xmath63 .",
    "thus , our main result is that the surface anisotropy constant @xmath64 in ( [ anisoenergy ] ) increases by about 3 @xmath65 when a perpendicular field of the strength of the saturation field @xmath42 is switched on .",
    "near @xmath66 ( @xmath67 ) , where the anisotropy develops its maximum @xcite , we obtain analogous results ( not shown ) .     determining the structural anisotropy versus the magnetic anisotropy constant @xmath7 at @xmath68 .",
    "data points result from the slopes of figure  1 including the case @xmath69 .",
    "dotted line : linear fit . ]",
    "so far we have shown that in the presence of a strong perpendicular magnetic field the anisotropy energy @xmath3 notably affects the frozen - in structure of growing nanoclusters and thus improves pma .",
    "based on landau theory , we now study effects of external magnetic fields on the equilibrium structure of bulk systems or homogeneous films .",
    "effects of this type are known in principle but have been explored only for few specific materials @xcite@xcite . for copt@xmath0 , quantitative calculations have been performed in the past within the cluster variation method in the tetrahedron approximation @xcite",
    ". landau theory , which we use here allows us to incorporate the magnetic anisotropy in a simple manner and helps clarifying the interrelation between different effects .    for the free energy @xmath70 per co - atom in copt@xmath0 in the presence of an external field @xmath71 we propose the form @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the average magnetic moment per copt@xmath0-unit . the first term in ( [ f ] )",
    "denotes the structural free energy that describes l1@xmath1-ordering without magnetic contributions @xcite , @xmath74 the structural order parameter components @xmath75 , @xmath76 , describe amplitudes for layering along one of the cubic axes @xmath77 of the fcc - lattice such that copt - layers and pt - layers alternate .",
    "superposition of these layer structures in all three directions yields the l1@xmath1-structure . as usual , we set @xmath78 ; @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 , where @xmath83 denotes the spinodal temperature .",
    "the associated ordering temperature @xmath84 is determined by @xmath85 .    the second term in ( [ f ] )",
    "is the isotropic magnetic free energy , with the behaviour @xmath86 as @xmath87 , where @xmath88 and @xmath89 denotes the curie - temperature of a disordered alloy .",
    "finally the third term in ( [ f ] ) , @xmath90 describes the coupling between structural and magnetic order . retaining only the lowest - order terms allowed by symmetry , we write @xmath91 for later purposes we define the landau coefficients such that @xmath75 becomes dimensionless , with @xmath92 for perfect structural order",
    ". expressions ( [ f ] )    ( [ lowest ] ) imply far - reaching interdependencies between structural and magnetic properties .",
    "combination with simple mean - field arguments allows us to make order - of - magnitude predictions which can be tested experimentally .",
    "first , collecting terms in ( [ f ] ) which are quadratic in @xmath75 , we find that in a state magnetized parallel to the [ 111 ] direction , both the spinodal and the transition temperature for l1@xmath1-ordering are shifted by an amount @xmath93 with @xmath94 to determine the @xmath95-coefficients in ( [ down ] ) we note that the same combination @xmath96 enters the difference in curie temperatures between disordered and ordered samples , @xmath97 this relation is immediately obtained from ( [ f ] ) by requiring the terms quadratic in @xmath98 to vanish .",
    "for the ordered samples we have set @xmath99 , because the discontinuity @xmath100 in @xmath75 at @xmath84 is large and curie temperatures are considerably lower than @xmath101k . within the same consideration the inverse magnetic susceptibility",
    "@xmath102 develops a discontinuity at the order transition at @xmath84 of magnitude @xmath103 .",
    "experimentally , @xmath104k , while @xmath105k @xcite .",
    "the reason for an increased curie temperature in quenched , disordered samples is the increased number of co - co direct exchange couplings relative to the ordered state .",
    "this temperature shift already allows a rough estimate of ( [ down ] ) .",
    "suppose , for example , the magnetic field is strong enough to drive the magnetic moment @xmath106 to values near its saturation value @xmath107 .",
    "using mean field arguments , we expect that both @xmath108 and @xmath109 are of order unity",
    ". therefore the two expressions ( [ quadratic ] ) and ( [ down ] ) should be of similar magnitude .",
    "in other words , for very strong magnetic fields @xmath110 $ ] equation ( [ f ] ) predicts a lowering of @xmath84 by about @xmath111k in copt@xmath0 .",
    "a further effect is worth mentioning .",
    "when the orientation of the external field is changed from [ 111 ] to [ 001 ] and @xmath112 , the disordered phase develops an instability towards formation of a layered structure with @xmath113 and @xmath114 , i.e. with @xmath115 symmetry . the corresponding transition point",
    "is increased relative to the spinodal temperature for [ 111 ] field orientation , @xmath116 , by an amount @xmath117 , but will exceed @xmath118 only if @xmath119 is sufficiently large .",
    "otherwise this layered structure can not form because the conventional ordering transition at @xmath118 will set in before . in copt@xmath0 anisotropic magnetic interactions determining @xmath120",
    "are weak ( see below ) so that this effect is unlikely to be observable .    at this point",
    "let us attempt to explicitly relate the parameters @xmath121 and @xmath120 to a specific magnetic model .",
    "for that purpose we adopt a phenomenological spin - hamiltonian @xmath122 pertaining to copt@xmath0 alloys . as its main contribution",
    "we assume classical heisenberg - type isotropic exchange interactions @xmath123 within nearest - neighbour co - co and co - pt pairs .",
    "this simplified form seems sufficient as we are dealing only with the energetics of homogeneously magnetized states .",
    "the respective magnetic energies for co - co and co - pt pairs with parallel spins are @xmath124 and @xmath125 , respectively .",
    "in addition , an anisotropy @xmath3 connected with co - pt bonds , see ( [ bond ] ) , is included . within first order perturbation theory",
    "the change in free energy due to @xmath126 is given by an average of @xmath126 over an unperturbed ensemble specified by the @xmath75 .",
    "mean - field calculations then yield @xmath127    in order to test the validity of the landau approach based on the coupling ( [ lowest ] ) between structural and magnetic order and its prediction ( [ down ] ) , we first focus on the anisotropy energy @xmath128 ( ignoring @xmath129 ) and perform monte carlo simulations of the lattice model described before , but now under equilibrium conditions .",
    "the simulation box contains 43200 atoms and is subjected to periodic boundary conditions in all three directions .",
    "equilibrated configurations are generated by allowing any pair of unlike atoms to exchange positions .",
    "order parameter @xmath130 for a bulk system at equilibrium as a function of temperature .",
    "averages were performed over 6 realizations . among the magnetic interactions",
    "only the anisotropy @xmath131 has been included in the simulations .",
    "the upward shift of the ordering temperature @xmath132k is clearly recognizable . ]    in figure  3 the structural order parameter is plotted versus temperature , and indeed shows an increased transition temperature in the fully magnetized state in comparison to the zero field case .",
    "we have again used @xmath133ev , see above , which gives an increase of @xmath84 by @xmath134k .",
    "this increase favourably agrees with ( [ down ] ) when we set @xmath135 , see ( [ mean ] ) , and @xmath136 .",
    "these results show that with realistic parameters for the microscopic anisotropy energy a measurable shift in the ordering temperature is observed .",
    "the physical reason for the increase of @xmath84 in figure  3 is that through the presence of @xmath3 the six nearest neighbour sites of a co - atom with bond vectors not orthogonal to [ 111 ] become preferentially occupied by pt - atoms during the equilibration process , thus favouring the ordered structure .",
    "basically this is the same mechanism that yields an increased structural anisotropy parameter @xmath44 discussed before .",
    "figure  3 , therefore , provides additional evidence , that @xmath3 affects the ordering transition .",
    "when exchange interactions are included , equation ( [ down ] ) predicts a much larger downward shift in @xmath84 , which we can estimate now in a more quantitative manner . from @xcite and known co- and pt - moments we obtain @xmath137k and @xmath138k , while @xmath7 is much smaller .",
    "thus @xmath139k , in agreement with the order of magnitude estimate of ( [ down ] ) given before , which was based on the comparison with measured curie temperatures .",
    "again , the corresponding change in @xmath84 according to ( [ down ] ) can be compared with predictions from numerical computation . however , within a lattice - model with nearest - neighbour chemical and isotropic exchange interactions , extra simulations for this problem actually are not needed when we note that in a fully magnetized sample the effect of @xmath123 is simply equivalent to modified chemical interactions @xmath140 since the ordering transition temperature satisfies @xmath141 , we find , using ( [ chemical ] ) , @xmath142 . because of ( [ mean ] ) and @xmath143 this is consistent with ( [ down ] ) and establishes a semi - quantitative estimate @xmath144k . clearly , since the exchange terms @xmath145 and @xmath146 in ( [ chemical ] ) are relatively small , we could neglect them in our previous discussion of structural anisotropy .",
    "experimentally , for copt@xmath0 it is probably very difficult to induce a sufficiently strong magnetization near @xmath84 such that the shift @xmath147 becomes measurable .",
    "the situation is more favourable for l1@xmath2-ordering of co@xmath148pt@xmath149 alloys near @xmath150 , where the curie temperature is closer to the ordering temperature @xmath84 and even intersects with @xmath84 on the co - rich side in the phase diagram .",
    "a similar situation occurs for ni - rich ni@xmath148pt@xmath151 alloys @xcite . for l@xmath152-ordering the structural part of the free energy @xmath153",
    "is again based on ( [ fs ] ) , however , with a change in sign in @xmath154 at @xmath155 , @xmath156 sufficiently negative and additional stabilizing higher order terms @xcite .",
    "elastic energy contributions due to the tetragonal distortion in the l1@xmath2 phase are thereby neglected .",
    "coupling between structural order parameters and the magnetization can again be represented by equation ( [ lowest ] ) .",
    "considering magnetic fields @xmath157 $ ] we now obtain @xmath158 and @xmath159 instead of ( [ down ] ) and ( [ quadratic ] ) , with a measured value of about @xmath160k for the latter temperature shift . using similar arguments as before , both temperature shifts @xmath161 and @xmath162 are expected to be of the same order .",
    "effects of external magnetic fields on both the far - from - equilibrium mbe growth of magnetic fcc alloys and their bulk structural phase behaviour at equilibrium have been studied .",
    "the statistical model we employed pertains to binary alloys of the copt@xmath0 type and l1@xmath1-ordering .",
    "kmc simulations are supplemented by equilibrium considerations based on landau theory . using realistic parameters for copt@xmath0",
    "our main aim was to explore the influence of the local crystalline magnetic anisotropy energy , modelled by a bond hamiltonian @xmath131 , on the structural properties of alloy nanoclusters , when a strong magnetic field is applied during growth .",
    "such an effect , although small in copt@xmath0 , appears to be general and indeed leads to a notable enhancement of the clusters structural anisotropy and the associated pma .",
    "experimentally , in order to induce a large magnetization , the substrate temperature should fall below the curie temperature of disordered samples but at the same time remain in the known temperature window where pma occurs .",
    "more favorable conditions for studying these effects experimentally should exist for alloys like copt or fept @xcite undergoing l1@xmath2-ordering , if clusters could be grown along the c - axis .",
    "as known from thin film measurements @xcite , the magnetic anisotropy in those alloys is a bulk property connected with alternating co(fe)- and pt - rich layers caused by the l1@xmath2 structural order .",
    "hence , under growth conditions where l1@xmath2-ordering is suppressed , one can expect a substantially larger field - induced pma .",
