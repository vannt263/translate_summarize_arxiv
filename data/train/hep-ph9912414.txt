    "in the solutions of the solar and atmospheric neutrino anomalies through the oscillations between the three active neutrino species , three ambiguities remain to be resolved : ( i ) the solution of the solar neutrino problem  sma , lma or vo , ( ii ) the type of mass hierarchy  normal ( @xmath4 ) or inverted ( @xmath5 , and ( iii ) the value of @xmath2 .",
    "we show how some of these ambiguities may be resolved from the observations of the neutrino spectra from a type ii supernova .",
    "only the main results are summarized in this talk . for the detailed arguments and derivations ,",
    "the reader is referred to @xcite .",
    "the neutrino transitions between different matter eigenstates inside the supernova take place mainly in the resonance regions @xmath6 and @xmath7 , which are characterized by @xmath8 and @xmath9 respectively . due to the @xmath10-hierarchy ( @xmath11 ) ,",
    "the dynamics in each of the two resonance layers can be considered independently as a @xmath12 transition @xcite .",
    "the final neutrino fluxes can then be written in terms of _ survival probabilities _ @xmath13 and @xmath14 of @xmath15 and @xmath16 respectively ( apart from the geometrical factor of @xmath17 ) : [ tr - matrix ] where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the final ( initial ) fluxes of @xmath20 and @xmath21 ( each of the non - electron neutrino or antineutrino species ) respectively .",
    "let @xmath22 and @xmath23 be the probabilities that the neutrinos ( antineutrinos ) jump to another matter eigenstate in the resonance layers @xmath6 and @xmath7 respectively .",
    "the values of @xmath13 and @xmath14 are determined by these _ flip probabilities _ and the mixing matrix elements @xmath24 .",
    "the flip probabilities depend on the density profile in the resonance layers .",
    "since @xmath25 ev@xmath26 for all transitions , the resonance densities are @xmath27 g / cc . the resonance layers lie in the outer parts of the mantle , where the density profile may be taken as @xmath28 @xcite . taking @xmath29 g / cc @xmath30 as the density profile , we show in fig .",
    "[ cont ] the contours of equal flip probability @xmath31 in the @xmath32 plot for two different energies on the borders of the observable spectrum .",
    "the dependence of the contours on the details of the density profile is very weak @xcite .",
    "the contours of @xmath33 and @xmath34 divide the plot into three `` regions '' .",
    "the _ adiabatic region _",
    "( i ) , where strong flavour conversions occur , is the region above the contour with @xmath33 . the _ non - adiabatic region _ ( iii ) , where flavour conversions are almost absent , lies below the @xmath34 contour . in the _ transition region _ ( ii ) , the flavour conversions are not complete and the extent of conversions depends on the neutrino energy .",
    "the @xmath6-resonance lies in the dark horizontal band in fig .",
    "[ cont ] , which corresponds to the allowed values of @xmath35 .",
    "the features of the final spectra depend strongly on whether the @xmath6-resonance lies in the region i or ii ( see table  [ ppbar ] ) . from fig .",
    "[ cont ] , the boundary between these regions is at ^2 2_e3 4 |u_e3|^2 ~10 ^ -3  , [ boundary ]",
    "the effects of neutrino transitions can be observed through the following features in the neutrino spectra .",
    "\\(ii ) the broadening of the spectra : though the initial ( pure ) spectra are expected to be `` pinched '' ( have a narrower energy distribution than the fermi - dirac one ) @xcite , the final ( mixed ) spectra need not be pinched .",
    "this effective broadening @xcite indicates that the final spectrum is composite , _",
    "i.e. _ the survival probability ( @xmath13 or @xmath14 ) is neither very close to 0 nor to 1 .",
    "the values of the survival probabilities @xmath13 and @xmath14 are given in table  [ ppbar ] , which illustrate the dependence of the final neutrino spectra on the ambiguities in the neutrino mass - flavour spectrum . from the table ,",
    "the following observations may be made :      \\(b ) if either the final @xmath15 or @xmath16 spectrum is determined to be hard ( almost the original @xmath21 spectrum ) , then the @xmath6-resonance is in region i. this gives a _ lower _ bound on @xmath2 .",
    "moreover , depending on which of the spectrum is the hard one , the type of hierarchy can be determined .",
    "a hard @xmath15 spectrum implies normal hierarchy , a hard @xmath16 spectrum implies inverted hierarchy .",
    "\\(d ) the observation of any earth matter effects rules out the scenario with the vo solution .",
    "if the earth matter effects are observed in the neutrino channels but not in the antineutrino channels , we either have the inverted mass hierarchy , or the normal mass hierarchy with the @xmath6 resonance in the region ii or iii .",
    "\\(e ) the observation of earth matter effects in the antineutrino channel identifies the lma solution .",
    "in addition , if the effects are significant in the neutrino channel also , the @xmath6 resonance can be established to be in the region ii or iii .",
    "the final neutrino spetra can thus help in resolving the three kinds of ambiguities .",
    "in particular , from the observations ( a ) , ( c ) , ( d ) , and ( e ) above , the @xmath6-resonance can be established to be in the region ii or iii , which implies ( eq .  [ boundary ] ) an upper bound of @xmath37 .",
    "this is two orders of magnitude better than the current bound ( see chooz in fig .",
    "[ cont ] ) or that expected from the planned long baseline experiments ( see minos in fig .",
    "[ cont ] ) .    a galactic supernova may provide us with a sufficient number of events @xcite to enable us to reconstruct the energy spectra of @xmath15 and @xmath16 . here",
    ", we have indicated the observations which can be used in principle to identify various conversion effects .",
    "feasibility studies , involving models for the initial spectra and the detector details , are needed in order to determine what can be achieved in practice .",
