    "one of the main difficulties lies in the fact that systems on a quantum scale are extremely susceptible to any kind of external noise , as well as to erroneous action of quantum gates in a circuit .",

    "two general approaches to this problem have been developed .",

    "for instance , in the unitary case , any product of two kraus operators is normal , so its numerical range is determined by the spectrum , which is not longer true in the general case .",
