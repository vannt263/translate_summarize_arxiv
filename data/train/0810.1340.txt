    "the problem of spin diffusion through conducting ferromagnetic medium attracted much attention over several decades.@xcite semiclassical spin transport in the presence of a weak magnetic field @xmath3 can be captured by the conventional diffusion equation ( neglecting spin relaxation ) : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the diffusion coefficient and @xmath3 is the total effective field ( omitting the gyromagnetic ratio ) , including the applied and exchange contributions .",

    "furthermore , the time - dependent exchange field induces spin - pumping currents@xcite inside the ferromagnet with spatially inhomogeneous magnetization dynamics , which can considerably modify the self - consistent magnetic equation of motion . here , we wish to elucidate the central role of such self - consistent dissipative spin currents , which govern the diffusion - like terms in the magnetic equation of motion in the limit of strong ferromagnetic exchange correlations .",

    "additional quadratic terms would be allowed phenomenologically if , e.g. , we developed our linearized theory with respect to an equilibrium magnetic texture , such as a domain wall or magnetic spiral .",
