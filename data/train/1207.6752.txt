    "recently , there has been a growing interest in understanding the characteristics of quantum entanglement in many - body systems  @xcite .",
    "entanglement ( von neumann ) entropy and the family of rnyi entropies have been demonstrated to be useful in quantifying bipartite entanglement in a variety of situations .",
    "more recently , the concept of entanglement spectrum ( es ) introduced by li and haldane  @xcite has attracted considerable interest .",
    "the es of a bipartite system consisting of @xmath1 and @xmath2 is obtained from the spectrum of the reduced density matrix @xmath3 for a subsystem @xmath1 .",
    "li and haldane demonstrated that the entanglement spectra for fractional quantum hall states reflect the gapless edge excitations at the _ fictitious _ boundaries created by tracing out the subsystem @xmath2 .",
    "since then , entanglement spectra have been studied in quantum hall systems  @xcite , topological insulators  @xcite , and quantum spin models in one  @xcite and two  @xcite dimensions .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , poilblanc studied the es of gapped two - leg spin-@xmath4 heisenberg ladders and found that the es is remarkably close to the _ energy _ spectrum of a single spin-@xmath4 heisenberg chain , which is one of the subsystems of the original two - leg ladder .",
    "this observation was later explained analytically using first - order perturbation theory in the limit of strong rung coupling  @xcite .",
    "it is natural to expect that a similar property also holds for gapped ( but non - topological ) spin systems in two dimensions since the entanglement in those systems is short - ranged . from this perspective , the two - dimensional ( 2d ) valence - bond - solid ( vbs ) states  @xcite , which are exact ground states of the affleck - kennedy - lieb - tasaki ( aklt ) model  @xcite , and their generalizations called projected entangled pair states ( peps )  @xcite were examined . in both cases , it was found that the reduced density matrix @xmath3 can be interpreted as a thermal density matrix of a _ holographic _ ( fictitious ) one - dimensional ( 1d ) system . in particular , for the vbs states , this holographic 1d system turns out to be a spin-@xmath4 heisenberg chain .    in this paper",
    ", we introduce and study another class of quantum many - body states , which falls into the category of tensor - network states  @xcite . the quantum lattice - gas model in which these states are ground states was first constructed by lesanovsky  @xcite .",

    "the model on the square lattice , referred to as the quantum hard - square model , was also examined for the validity of this ansatz  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , it was found that the normalization of the ground state in this case is given by the partition function of the _ classical _ hard - square model  @xcite .    while the parent hamiltonian can be easily constructed for any graph in any dimension",

    ", the es can be obtained from the eigenvalues of the transfer matrix in the classical lattice gas model in _ two dimension_. from this , it immediately follows that the es is gapless when the parameter @xmath5 is chosen so that the corresponding classical model is critical  @xcite .",

    "this conclusion is further supported by the nested entanglement entropy ( nee ) , the von neumann entropy of the ground state of the entanglement hamiltonian . for the model on the triangular ladder , we show that the entanglement hamiltonian is _ integrable _ in the same sense as in the hard - hexagon model solved by baxter  @xcite .",

    "a , we give a detailed proof that the constructed ground state has zero - energy . in appendix b",

    "in addition , this exact ground state resembles the ground state of the rydberg lattice gas which is experimentally realizable in cold atom systems . in the 1d model",
    ", explicit expressions for the energy gap and a couple of excited states were also obtained analytically  @xcite .    here",

    "this can be seen by noting that all of the off - diagonal elements of @xmath26 are nonpositive and satisfy the connectivity condition , and thus the perron - frobenius theorem is applicable .",
    "similar to the aklt model  @xcite and the rk model  @xcite as well as their generalizations called peps  @xcite , the ground state @xmath42 can be expressed as a weighted superposition of allowed states . to see this ,",
    "it is instructive to write the unnormalized ground state @xmath43 in terms of classical configurations : @xmath44 where @xmath45 label classical configurations of particles on @xmath24 and @xmath46 is the set of configurations with nearest - neighbor exclusion .",

    "this classical model in two dimensions has been studied extensively in the literature of statistical mechanics .",
    "for instance , the model on the square lattice is known as the hard - square model .",
    "one can easily imagine that the system undergoes a phase transition from a liquid state at @xmath51 to a solid state at @xmath52 , where the difference of the sublattice occupations is nonzero .",

    "the model on the triangular lattice is called the hard - hexagon model , which is integrable and was solved by baxter  @xcite .",
    "it also exhibits an order - disorder phase transition at @xmath54 , but this transition belongs to the universality class of the three - state potts model .",
    "let us return to the original quantum model .",
    "a particular feature of the present construction is that correlation functions in the quantum ground state are the same as those of the corresponding classical model  @xcite .",
    "this provides useful information on the ground state phase diagram of the quantum model .",
    "in fact , if the parameter @xmath5 is tuned so that the corresponding classical model is critical , then the ground state has algebraically decaying correlation functions , which suggests that the quantum model is critical as well .",
