    "various solar neutrino experiments  @xcite detect a flux - deficit of @xmath3 to @xmath4 of the standard solar model ( ssm ) prediction @xcite .",
    "the deficit can be explained by invoking the neutrino oscillation hypothesis . despite this",
    ", the solar neutrino problem is unsolved .",
    "super - kamiokande ( sk )  @xcite has not found evidence for any of the three litmus tests for neutrino oscillations : energy spectrum distortion , zenith angle dependence of the flux ( arising from the earth regeneration effect  @xcite ) or seasonal variations of the flux . moreover , there are three distinct robust solutions all of which have comparable significance levels , lma , sma and low  @xcite .",
    "a vac solution at is fragile in comparison to the three other solutions and its existence depends sensitively upon how much emphasis is placed on the sk data  @xcite .",
    "we do not consider it further and focus on the msw solutions .",
    "presently , data from sk favors the lma solution  @xcite .",
    "the kamland reactor neutrino experiment  @xcite will establish once and for all whether or not the lma solution is correct , independent of the solar neutrino flux .",
    "if it is , within three years we will know @xmath5 and @xmath6 to an accuracy of @xmath7% and @xmath8 , respectively  @xcite .",
    "the sno experiment  @xcite , too , is expected to make significant inroads towards the resolution of the solar neutrino puzzle  @xcite , especially through neutral current measurements .",
    "sno is a cerenkov detector with 1000 tons of heavy water as its detection medium .",
    "its central objective is to test whether electron neutrinos produced in the sun oscillate into active or sterile neutrinos .",
    "this can be accomplished by the simultaneous measurement of the rates of the charged current ( cc ) and neutral current ( nc ) reactions @xmath9 where @xmath10 denotes any of the active flavors .",
    "the nc reaction measures the total flux of active neutrinos which is the same as the @xmath11b flux produced in the sun if there are only active - active neutrino oscillations .",
    "thus , a cross section - normalized ratio nc / cc @xmath12 indicates the oscillation if oscillations into sterile neutrinos occur , both the cc and nc rates will be suppressed giving nc / cc of unity thereby signaling the existence of sterile neutrinos .",
    "since the energy threshold is expected to be about 5 mev for the cc reaction and 2.2 mev for the nc reaction , only @xmath11b and @xmath13 neutrinos will contribute to the sno event rates .    because the nc reaction is unique to sno , a number of studies have been devoted to its exploitation . in this work",
    "we undertake an analysis of what the cc rate measurements at sno by themselves can and can not tell us .",
    "they can provide valuable information for active - active oscillations but are not as sensitive to active - sterile oscillations .",
    "the recoil energy spectrum of cc events and their zenith angle distribution can in principle eliminate two of the three globally allowed regions in oscillation parameter space , and also measure the oscillation parameters .",
    "the stringent chooz limit  @xcite ( see also the palo verde experiment  @xcite ) of ( at the 95% confidence level ) , approximately decouples solar neutrino oscillations from atmospheric neutrino oscillations . for small values of @xmath14 , provided @xmath15 , the three - flavor survival probability @xmath16 is related to the two - flavor survival probability @xmath17 by ( see the first paper of ref .",
    "@xcite ) , @xmath18 where the inequality arises from the chooz limit on @xmath14 . thus , even when the limit is saturated , the two - neutrino analysis represents a very good approximation to the three - neutrino analysis .",

    "briefly describe how the electron recoil energy spectra expected in the daytime and nighttime are calculated",
    ". we will collectively call both spectra the `` d&n spectra '' . in section iii",
    "we analyze the d&n data from sk ( 1258 effective days ) with different @xmath0 definitions and find the optimum definition for the analyses of the simulated sno data . in section iv we describe our simulation of the sno experiment and the subsequent data analysis . in section v we critically examine if the zenith angle distribution at sno adds to what can be learned from the d&n spectra .",
    "we compare our expectations for sno with an analysis of the zenith - angle distribution at super - kamiokande .",
    "we summarize our results in .",
    "the sno cc data will provide an accurate determination of the shape of the energy spectrum from @xmath11b neutrinos .",
    "information about the oscillation parameters will be embedded in the overall suppression of the cc rate relative to that of the ssm and in the distortion of the shape of the energy spectrum .",
    "the low q - value of the cc reaction makes this process well - suited to obtaining a spectrum with high energy resolution because most of the energy of the incoming neutrino is carried away by the outgoing electron since sno is a real - time experiment , it is capable of studying the effect of the earth on neutrinos that pass through it en route to the detector .",
    "a nadir angle , @xmath19 , is defined as the angle between the negative @xmath20 axis of the coordinate system at the detector and the direction of the sun . with this definition , @xmath21 during the day and @xmath22 at night .",

    "it was found that with a suitable choice of binning , any smearing of peculiarities intrinsic to the region of parameter space can be avoided .",
