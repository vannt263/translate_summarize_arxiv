    "equilibrium statistical mechanics tells us that the probability of a microstate of a system in equilibrium with a thermal reservoir is given by the boltzmann - gibbs law  : if @xmath0 is the hamiltonian of the system , the probability distribution over the configuration space is proportional to @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the inverse of temperature .",
    "this _ canonical _",
    "prescription is the starting point for any study of a system in thermodynamic equilibrium  : it has provided a firm microscopic basis for the laws of classical thermodynamics , has allowed us to describe various states of matter ( from liquid crystals to superfluids ) , and has led to a deep understanding of phase transitions that culminated in the renormalisation group theory .    for a system out of equilibrium",
    ", the probability of a given microstate evolves constantly with time . in the long time limit",
    "such a system may reach a stationary state in which the probability measure over the configuration space converges to a well - defined and constant distribution . if the system carries macroscopic stationary currents that represent interactions and exchanges of matter or energy with the external world , this stationary distribution is _ generically not _ given by the canonical boltzmann - gibbs law . at present",
    ", there exists no theory that can predict the stationary state of a system far from equilibrium from a knowledge of the microscopic interactions of the elementary constituents of the system amongst themselves and with the external environment , and the dynamical rules that govern its evolution .",
    "the search for general features and laws of _ non - equilibrium statistical mechanics _ is indeed a central topic of current research .    for systems close to thermodynamic equilibrium",
    ", linear - response theory yields the fluctuation - dissipation relations and the onsager reciprocity relations .",
    "however , these properties of non - equilibrium statistical mechanics are only valid in the vicinity of equilibrium .",
    "another route to explore and discover the characteristics of a general theory for systems out of equilibrium is through the study of mathematical models .",
    "these models should be simple enough to allow an exact and thorough mathematical analysis , but at the same time they must exhibit a complex phenomenology and must be versatile enough to be of physical significance . in the theory of phase transitions such",
    "a corner - stone was provided by the ising model .",
    "it is natural to expect that a well - crafted dynamical version of the ising model could play a key role in the development of non - equilibrium statistical mechanics . driven lattice gases ( katz , lebowitz and spohn 1984 ; for a review see schmittmann and zia , 1995 ) provide such models ; they represent particles hopping on a lattice and interacting through hard - core exclusion .",
    "the particles are subject to an external field that induces a bias in the hopping rates resulting in a stationary macroscopic current in the system . due to this current , the microscopic detailed balance condition is violated and the system is generically in a non - equilibrium stationary state .    the asymmetric simple exclusion process ( asep ) in one dimension is a driven lattice gas that can be viewed as a special case of the general class of models defined by katz , lebowitz and spohn .",
    "this stochastic particle system was simultaneously introduced as a biophysical model for protein synthesis on rna ( macdonald and gibbs 1969 ) and as a purely mathematical tool for the study of interaction of markov processes ( spitzer 1970 , liggett 1985 , spohn 1991 , liggett 1999 ) .",
    "subsequently , the asep has been used to study a wide range of physical phenomena  : hopping conductivity in solid electrolytes ( richards 1977 ) , transport of macromolecules through thin vessels ( levitt 1973 ) , reptation of polymer in a gel ( widom et al . 1991 ) , traffic flow ( schreckenberg and wolf 1998 ) , surface growth ( halpin - healy and zhang 1995 , krug 1997 ) , sequence alignment ( bundschuh 2002 ) and molecular motors ( klumpp and lipowsky , 2003 ) .    from a theoretical point of view , the asep plays a fundamental role in the study of non - equilibrium processes ( krug 1991 ) .",
    "many exact results for the asep have been derived using two complementary approaches , the matrix product ansatz and the bethe ansatz ( for a review see derrida 1998 , schtz 2001 ) , the relation between these two anstze being still a matter of investigation ( stinchcombe and schtz 1995 ; alcaraz and lazo 2004 ) .",
    "the matrix product ansatz , inspired from the quantum inverse scattering method ( faddeev 1984 ) , is based on a representation of the components of the steady state wave function of the markov operator in terms of a product of non - commuting operators .",
    "this matrix product technique , initially introduced for the asep with open boundaries ( derrida et al .",
    "1993 ) , has proved to be a very efficient tool to calculate steady state properties such as equal time correlations in the steady state , current fluctuations ( derrida et al .",
    "1997 ) , and large deviation functionals ( derrida et al .",
    "this technique has been used to prove rigorously that the invariant distribution of the asep with two classes of particles is not a gibbs measure ( speer 1993 ) .",
    "the second approach , which consists in applying the bethe ansatz to a non - equilibrium process such as the asep , is due to d. dhar ( 1987 ) .",
    "the markov matrix that encodes the stochastic dynamics of the asep can be rewritten in terms of pauli matrices ; in the absence of a driving field , the _ symmetric _ exclusion process can be mapped exactly into the heisenberg spin chain .",
    "the asymmetry due to a non - zero external driving field breaks the left / right symmetry and the asep becomes equivalent to a non - hermitian spin chain of the xxz type with boundary terms that preserve the integrable character of the model .",
    "the asep can also be mapped into a six vertex model ( baxter 1982 , kandel et al . ,",
    "these mappings suggest the use of the bethe ansatz to derive spectral information about the evolution operator , such as the spectral gap ( gwa and spohn 1992 , kim 1995 , golinelli and mallick 2004a , 2005a ) and large deviation functions ( derrida and lebowitz 1998 ; derrida and appert 1999 ; derrida and evans 1999 ) .",
    "the aim of the present work is to provide the reader with an introduction to integrability methods applied to the asep and to describe some of the exact results derived with the help of the bethe ansatz .",
    "our presentation assumes little prior knowledge of these methods and we put emphasis on the algebraic properties of the model .",
    "in fact , the asep on a periodic ring is one of the most elementary systems to which the bethe ansatz can be applied  : it is a discrete and classical model of interacting particles with the simplest possible interaction , hard - core exclusion , and with a conservation law ( the total number of particles is constant ) .",
    "the layout of this work is as follows  : in section  [ sec : sym ] , we describe the natural symmetries ( by translation , reflection and charge - conjugaison ) of the asep on a periodic ring ; in section  [ sec : aba ] , we review the solution of the asep by algebraic bethe ansatz and derive the bethe equations that determine the spectrum of the model . in the case of the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process , the analysis of the bethe equations can be carried out very precisely , even for finite size systems  : in section  [ sec : eqtasep ] , we explain the procedure for solving the tasep bethe equations , determine the spectral gap , and show that a hidden symmetry of these equations allows to predict the existence of unexpected spectral degeneracies in the spectrum . in section  [ sec : ldf ]",
    ", we discuss the method for calculating the large deviation function of the total current ; in particular , we show that the gallavotti - cohen relation manifests itself as a symmetry of the bethe equations . in the last section  [ sec : variantes ] ,",
    "we review the applications of integrability techniques to some variants of the asep .",
    "we consider the exclusion process on a periodic one dimensional lattice with @xmath3 sites ( sites @xmath4 and @xmath5 are identical ) .",
    "a lattice site can not be occupied by more than one particle .",
    "the state of a site @xmath4 ( @xmath6 ) is characterized by a boolean number @xmath7 or @xmath8 according as the site @xmath4 is empty or occupied .",
    "a configuration @xmath9 can be represented by the sequence @xmath10 the system evolves with time according to the following stochastic rule ( see figure  [ fig : periodicasep ] ) : a particle on a site @xmath4 at time @xmath11 jumps , in the interval between @xmath11 and @xmath12 , with probability @xmath13 to the neighbouring site @xmath14 if this site is empty ( _ exclusion rule _ ) and with probability @xmath15 to the site @xmath16 if this site is empty .",

    "the jumps are totally biased in one direction ( @xmath20 or @xmath21 ) .",
    "we call @xmath22 the probability of configuration @xmath9 at time @xmath11 .",
    "as the exclusion process is a continuous - time markov process , the time evolution of @xmath22 is determined by the master equation @xmath23 the markov matrix @xmath24 encodes the dynamics of the exclusion process : the non - diagonal element @xmath25 represents the transition rate from configuration @xmath26 to @xmath9 where a particle hops in the forward ( _ i.e. _ , anti - clockwise ) direction , the non - diagonal element @xmath27 represents the transition rate from configuration @xmath26 to @xmath9 where a particle hops in the backward ( _ i.e. _ , clockwise ) direction .",

    "the knowledge of the spectrum of the matrix @xmath24 and of the associated eigenvectors provides a full description of the dynamics of the model .",
    "such a spectral analysis is very similar to that carried out in quantum mechanics .",
    "one should however keep in mind that in the present case the evolution operator is non - hermitian  : its eigenvalues are complex numbers and the associated eigenvectors do not form an orthogonal basis in the configuration space .",
    "moreover , because @xmath24 is not symmetric , its left eigenvectors are different from the right eigenvectors .      before diagonalizing the markov matrix @xmath24 by bethe ansatz , we present some invariance properties of the asep , that can be described using elementary methods .",
    "the exclusion process on a ring displays symmetry properties under translation , right - left reflection , and particle / hole exchange ( the last two symmetries play a role analogous to parity and charge conjugaison in quantum mechanics ) . these symmetries reveal some intrinsic formal properties of the markov matrix , and are very useful to reduce the computation time when numerical diagonalization is performed .",
    "finally , these natural symmetries will allow us to define some conserved quantities ( analogous to quantum numbers ) and to predict degeneracies in the spectrum .",

    ". only numerical and phenomenological studies of the spectrum were available ( bilstein and wehefritz 1997 , dudziski and schtz 2000 ) . in a remarkable recent paper ,",
    "de gier and essler ( 2005 ) were able to derive the bethe ansatz equations describing the complete spectrum of the markov matrix of the partially asymmetric exclusion process with open boundaries and general input / output rates .",
    "their work uses an exact solution of the open xxz chain with non - diagonal boundary terms ( nepomechie 2003 and 2004 , cao et al . 2003 ) .",
    "de gier and essler have calculated analytically the spectral gap of the tasep with open boundaries and have discussed the various regimes throughout the phase diagram ; in particular they have discovered a fine structure of the phase diagram that could not be found from the stationary state alone .",
    "their work opens the way to many further investigations , such as the description of the excited states and the calculation of the large deviation function of the current in the open system .",
    "the bethe ansatz was initially used to diagonalize quantum hamiltonians ( such as the heisenberg spin chain , the one - dimensional bose gas with @xmath393-interactions ) and to calculate real spectra of hermitian operators . in the 70 s and the beginning of the 80 s , the exact solutions of the six and eight vertex models and the development of the quantum inverse scattering method ( baxter 1982 , faddeev 1984 ) showed that many systems of interest in equilibrium statistical mechanics belonged to the class of integrable models .",
    "the asep , which plays the role of a paradigm in non - equilibrium statistical mechanics , thanks to its rich and complex phenomenology , has been shown to be integrable .",
    "this integrability property has allowed to derive many exact solutions for the asep and for some related models that we have reviewed here .",
    "these analytical results add to our knowledge of systems far from equilibrium and allow us to compare them with systems at equilibrium on a quantitative level .",
    "the use of integrability techniques in non - equilibrium statistical mechanics is an active field of current research . in particular , we believe that the following problems should lead to interesting results in near future  : the use of the nested bethe ansatz for asep with multiple species of particles , the investigation of asep with open boundaries , the study of exclusion processes with disorder , and the application of integrability techniques to the zero - range process ( povolotsky 2004 , povolotsky and mendes 2006 )      we wish to thank the guest editors of this special issue , patrick dorey , gerald dunne and joshua feinberg for inviting us to write this contribution .",
