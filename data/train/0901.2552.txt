    "the last decade has seen the proliferation of the so called hybrid methods of medical imaging , where different physical types of radiation are combined into one tomographic process ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "such a combination allows one to alleviate deficiencies of each separate type of waves , while combining their strengths .",
    "thermoacoustic ( and closely related photoacoustic ) tomography is an example of such a hybrid method ( see @xcite and references therein ) .    in this text",
    "we discuss a very specific type of hybrid imaging , the one that combines electrical or optical measurements with a concurrent scanning of the object with ultrasound ( us ) waves .",
    "the propagating us wave slightly modifies the local physical properties of the medium , such as its electrical conductivity or the distribution of light scatterers .",
    "this , in turn , perturbs the background tomographic measurements ( optical or electric ) .",
    "these perturbations are measured and used to reconstruct the electrical or optical properties of the medium .",
    "such hybrid methods hold a promise to improve the tomographic modalities that are otherwise notorious for their instability and/or low resolution , such as electrical impedance tomography   @xcite or optical imaging  @xcite . for these hybrid methods we will use the names",
    "acousto - electric tomography ( aet ) and ultrasound modulated optical tomography ( umot ) .",
    "it has been understood that if one could focus the ultrasound on a small spot inside the body , knowledge of this location would have a stabilizing effect on the reconstruction in otherwise highly unstable imaging modalities ( see e.g. @xcite and section [ s : eit ] below ) . in this text , however , our goal is not to discuss the ultrasound modulated imaging in detail , but rather to address the assumption of a well focused us beam .",
    "it is known that such focusing ( to the extent needed for tomography ) is hard to achieve ( see , for example , the detailed discussion of this issue in @xcite ) .",
    "thus , it would be important to find a way of utilizing instead unfocused us waves .",
    "as we will show , this can be achieved through the synthetic focusing , i.e. by extracting the measurements corresponding to well - focused beams , from the data obtained with unfocused waves . under such approach ,",
    "the tomographic problem is solved in two steps ( hopefully both stable ) : first , synthetic focusing , and then inversion from the focused  beam data .",
    "we will not attempt to address the second step in this short text ( see @xcite where the various implementations of such a procedure are discussed ) .",
    "instead , we show that the first step ( synthetic focusing ) , under appropriate choice of waves , is stable and mathematically equivalent to the reconstruction in thermoacoustic tomography ( although no thermoacoustic measurements are conducted ) . in some cases",
    ", this step can even be reduced to the inversion of the fourier transform .",
    "an example of the aet reconstruction is also provided .",
    "this paper is meant as a preliminary non - technical announcement , which follows a part of the lecture given at the jan boman s conference `` integral geometry and tomography '' in august 2008 .",
    "the technical analytic and numerical details will be provided elsewhere .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows : the idea of us modulation in tomography is summarized in section [ s : modulated ] .",
    "section [ s : focusing ] contains the description of four different types of unfocused us waves that one might try to use . in each case",
    "it is shown that the synthetic focusing ( within the assumed mathematical model approximation ) reduces to one of the well known analytic reconstruction procedures .",
    "section [ s : eit ] is devoted to a brief description of the aet procedure and a numerical example .",
    "remarks are contained in section [ s : remarks ] , followed by acknowledgments and references .",
    "as indicated in the introduction , the ultrasound ( us ) modulation in various types of tomography is performed by sending a us wave through the object , concurrently with the original tomographic measurement ( say , optical or electric ) .",
    "varying the shape of the wave , one observes the resulting changes in the tomographic data and tries to extract from them the quantity of interest .",
    "this technique promises to improve significantly the stability of such modalities as electrical impedance tomography ( eit ) and optical tomography ( ot ) .    to be more specific ,",
    "let us consider the eit case , where one seeks to recover the conductivity @xmath0 inside of an object occupying the domain @xmath1 from boundary impedance measurements .",
    "assume for instance that a boundary current @xmath2 is applied and one measures the corresponding boundary potential response @xmath3 . here",
    "@xmath4 and @xmath5 denote variable points on the boundary @xmath6 . in eit ,",
    "the current @xmath7 is varied and the potential @xmath8 is measured , so that the complete neumann - to - dirichlet operator @xmath9 on @xmath6 is obtained ( alternatively , by varying @xmath8 , one recovers the dirichlet - to - neumann operator ) . in the case of ultrasound modulation ( at least in the example discussed in section [ s : eit ] ) , a single boundary current can be used , rather than the whole operator @xmath9 ; we will thus assume that @xmath7 is fixed .",
    "suppose now that , given any point @xmath10 , we could create a us wave that would approximate well the delta function at the location @xmath11 .",
    "this would create a perturbation @xmath12 of the original boundary voltage @xmath13 . by scanning the focusing point @xmath11 through the domain @xmath1 ,",
    "one obtains the set of functions @xmath14 , from which one can try to recover the internal conductivity @xmath15 .",
    "this can actually be done , and the reconstruction does not inherit the original high instability of eit ( see the details in @xcite , where two different approaches are presented ) .",
    "a somewhat similar situation arises in ot @xcite .",
    "stability of such reconstructions can be seen in figures [ f : aet ] and [ f : uot ] ( taken from @xcite ) .",
    "these figures show mathematical phantoms ( left ) and their reconstructions obtained using the simulated perfectly focused us modulations in eit and ot correspondingly ( images on the right ) .",
    "these examples clearly demonstrate stability of these hybrid modalities ; the issues of stability will be discussed in more detail , along with the reconstruction methods , in @xcite .",
    "[ c]cc &   + &    however , as we have mentioned in the introduction , the problem with this technique is the difficulty of physically generating well localized us waves ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we thus suggest the use of a synthetic focusing approach described in the next section .",
    "we start by mentioning that the acousto - electric and opto - acoustic effects that are responsible for the perturbations in the electric and optical properties of the medium due to us irradiation , are very small ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "although this makes the resulting boundary effects harder to measure , it also enables one to use the linearization of the problem in the following sense .",
    "let @xmath0 be the parameter to be reconstructed , say , electrical conductivity in the eit case .",
    "the perturbation @xmath16 of @xmath15 due to the applied us wave will be very small .",
    "hence , one can safely assume that the operator @xmath17 that maps the perturbation @xmath16 into the perturbation @xmath18 of the measured data @xmath8 is linear .",
    "in fact , the operator @xmath17 depends on the underlying @xmath15 and thus will be denoted as @xmath19 .    due to smallness of the amplitude of the applied us wave , as well as the smallness of the acousto - electric and opto - acoustic effects , one can try also to linearize the effect of local pressure on the perturbation @xmath16 .",
    "it turns out that such a linearization is possible in aet ; it happens to be incorrect in the optical case , where the dependence is quadratic @xcite .",
    "let now @xmath20 be the linear operator that maps the distributed perturbation @xmath21 of the material parameter ( say , conductivity ) inside @xmath1 to the perturbation @xmath22 of the tomographic data measured on a part @xmath23 of the boundary @xmath6 ( which , in principle , could consist of a single point , although this would not be advisable in tomography ) .",
    "if one could create us waves well localized at arbitrary locations @xmath10 , this would allow one to measure the response of @xmath17 to delta - type inputs , and thus would lead to a direct measurement of the kernel @xmath24 of the operator @xmath17 : @xmath25 so , the use of perfectly focused us waves is equivalent to measuring the kernel @xmath24 . the general idea of * synthetic focusing * is to use a more realistic non - localized complete set @xmath26 of us waves and to recover the kernel @xmath24 from the measured responses @xmath27 in other words , one reconstructs numerically the would - be response of the tomographic measurement to the perfectly focused us irradiation , which explains our use of the name synthetic focusing .",
    "we now address some specific versions of synthetic focusing in sub - sections below .",
    "( the reader should be warned that we discuss here only the reconstruction of the kernel @xmath24 , but not the procedure of the further recovery of @xmath0 from the kernel . )",
    "suppose that one places a point us transducer at arbitrary location @xmath28 and creates a short impulse that approximates a spreading spherical wave @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the constant us speed in the tissue .",
    "then the response of the measurement operator @xmath19 produces the spherical integrals of the kernel @xmath24 @xmath31 we thus arrive to the problem of recovering a function @xmath24 of @xmath11 ( @xmath4 is now just a fixed parameter ) inside domain @xmath1 from known integrals from @xmath32 over all spheres centered at the boundary @xmath6 .",
    "this problem has been studied extensively , in particular due to its relevance for the thermoacoustic tomography ( tat ) ; numerous results concerning the solvability , stability , and inversion methods have been obtained ( see @xcite ) . in particular , when @xmath6 is a sphere , a variety of backprojection type formulas have been derived .",
    "we provide below the @xmath33 formula derived in @xcite ( it was generalized to all dimensions in @xcite ) : @xmath34 here @xmath1 is the unit sphere , @xmath35 is the average of @xmath32 over the sphere centered at @xmath36 and of radius @xmath37 , @xmath38 is the outward normal vector to @xmath6 at @xmath4 , and @xmath39 is the surface area measure .",
    "several different inversion formulas were derived earlier in @xcite .    in the case of non -",
    "spherical surfaces , eigenfunction expansions and time reversal methods can be used to reconstruct @xmath32 ( see @xcite and references therein ) .      since in aet the electric response of",
    "the medium is proportional to the perturbation in the pressure , one can use for scanning not only acoustic pulses , but also monochromatic waves . using such waves",
    "has the advantage that the resulting boundary measurement will oscillate with ultrasound frequency .",
    "hence , its time fourier transform allows one to selectively pick up this frequency , thus reducing the effects of the wide spectrum noise .",
    "suppose that the monochromatic wave @xmath40 with a time frequency @xmath41 is produced by a point transducer located at the point @xmath42 : @xmath43 then @xmath44 and the fourier transform with respect to time @xmath45 of @xmath46 will be equal to the integral of @xmath24 multiplied by the free - space green s function @xmath47 of the helmholtz equation : @xmath48 as before , we assume that the point @xmath4 at which the electrical measurements are conducted , is fixed",
    ". then , if the measurements are repeated for a wide range of frequencies @xmath41 and for all @xmath49 and are followed by the inverse fourier transform ( in @xmath41 ) applied to @xmath45 , one recovers the integral of @xmath32 over the spheres centered at @xmath5 as in ( [ e : spherical ] ) .",
    "now the problem of recovering @xmath24 from values of @xmath45 is equivalent to inverting its spherical mean radon transform of @xmath32 ;  such an inversion was discussed in the previous section .    alternatively , since the first step of the reconstruction formulas presented in @xcite consists in computing the values of @xmath45 , one can reconstruct @xmath24 without explicitly reconstructing the values of its spherical mean radon transform first .",
    "in particular , by using the 3-d formula from @xcite , one obtains the following reconstruction formula for @xmath24 from @xmath45 : @xmath50 with@xmath51   \\lambda d\\lambda.\\ ] ] here , as before , @xmath38 is the outward normal vector to @xmath6 at @xmath4 , and @xmath39 is the surface area measure .",
    "spherical waves arise when the size of the transducer is small compared to the wavelength .",
    "if the distance from the transducer to the object of interest is much larger than the size of the object , the wave is approximately planar .",
    "plane waves can also be created by using a large planar transducer . in either case",
    "the transducer should be broadband to permit generation of plane waves in a wide range of frequencies .",
    "measurement done using planar acoustic waves @xmath52 correspond to measuring the fourier transform of the kernel @xmath24 : @xmath53 synthetic focusing now reduces to the inversion of the fourier transform .",
    "let us illustrate by a numerical example the application of synthetic focusing to image reconstruction in aet .",
    "we simulated numerically a square domain , with the electrical currents equal 1 on the left and right sides of the square and 0 on the top and the bottom .",
    "the conductivity @xmath0 we used in our experiments was close to 1 ; the gray scale density plot of the logarithm @xmath54 is shown in the left part of figure [ f : aet ] . in this figure",
    "the light circles correspond to the value @xmath55 , the dark ones represent the value of @xmath56 , and the gray background depicts @xmath57 .",
    "the simulated electric potential was `` measured '' on the whole boundary of the square .    as mentioned previously",
    ", figure [ f : aet ] ( right ) presents the result of aet reconstruction from simulated measurements corresponding to perfectly focused us modulation .",
    "we compare this to the results of aet reconstruction of the same phantom , obtained by using synthetic measurements , as shown in figure [ f : aetpulse ] . in this example",
    "we modeled the perturbations of electric potential on the boundary caused by the spherical pulse waves with the centers on a circle surrounding our square domain .",
    "the total of 300 transducers and 800 different radii of outgoing spherical pulses per transducer were simulated .",
    "the reconstruction shown in the right half of figure [ f : aetpulse ] was obtained by using synthetic focusing to obtain @xmath24 and then by reconstructing conductivity @xmath0 ( again , the methods for reconstructing @xmath15 from @xmath32 will be discussed elsewhere . )",
    "the reconstructed image is clearly as good as the one obtained using the perfectly focused us modulation ( figure [ f : aet ] , right part ) .",
    "[ c]cc &   + &      one of the umot reconstruction methods , suggested in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , is in fact a synthetic focusing , rather than a true reconstruction .",
    "the authors of @xcite employed the observation that the focusing was non - perfect : the focal zone of the ultrasonic waves was 2 mm across and 20 mm in length , which made it a better approximation to a segment rather than a point .",
    "one thus can conclude that by shifting and rotating the focusing area , one can extract the x - ray transform of the kernel @xmath24 ( as before , with respect to the variable @xmath11 ) .",
    "then standard x - ray inversion formulas recover the kernel @xmath32 .",
    "as it has already been mentioned , exact analytic and numerical details of the reconstruction procedures will be provided elsewhere .",
    "practical implementation of the suggested synthetic focusing procedures will have to include more precise information about possibilities and imperfections of the currently available transducers .",
    "the umot situation differs from aet and will probably not allow usage of monochromatic us modulation .",
    "however , the modulation by spherical pulse waves should still be possible",
    ". these issues will be addressed elsewhere .",
    "( as it has been already mentioned , the synthetic focusing using x - ray transforms was implemented for umot in @xcite . )",
