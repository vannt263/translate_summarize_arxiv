    "moreover we will consider only tinfoil boundary conditions , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath103 , which simplifies the algebra .",

    "it shall proof useful in what follows to remark that one can rewrite the ewald potential as @xmath111 where @xmath112 is a harmonic function in the square and can thus be expressed quite generally as  @xcite @xmath113 where @xmath114 is the angle of @xmath115 with the axis @xmath116 and the constants @xmath117 , @xmath118 are such that @xmath119 is a periodical function .",

    "@xmath121 one finds the obvious result @xmath122 .",
    "therefore fulton s relation   takes the explicit form @xmath123 we stress that the above equation has been obtained under the assumption of the locality of the dielectric tensor @xmath98 .",
