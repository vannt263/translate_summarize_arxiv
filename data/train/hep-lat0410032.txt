    "forces among infinitely heavy quarks separated by distance @xmath4 are of great significance both at @xmath5 and when they are surrounded by an interacting medium with temperature @xmath0 .",
    "the lattice formulation of their free energy was successfully carried out already 20 years ago @xcite .",
    "numerous lattice results are available in quenched @xcite and also in full qcd @xcite at @xmath6 .",
    "there are recent calculations to determine the free energy in channels with definite color transformation properties .",
    "the gauge invariance and the interpretation of these singlet / octet channels in view of @xcite raised some new , interesting questions .",
    "all the previous results were obtained at vanishing baryonic chemical potential .",
    "lattice simulations at @xmath7 are difficult , because they are hindered by the sign problem of the fermion determinant .",
    "recently , new techniques have been proposed to study lattice qcd at non - vanishing @xmath1 @xcite . in this paper",
    "we use the multi - parameter reweighting to reach non - zero @xmath1 values .",
    "we determine the grand canonical potential of the heavy quark  anti - quark system up to @xmath8 mev in quark chemical potential on @xmath9 lattices for physical quark masses .",
    "we use the same configurations as have been used in @xcite .",
    "the free energy of a qcd system at @xmath10 with a static quark and anti - quark separated by distance @xmath4 can be expressed as follows @xcite : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the trace of the temporal wilson line , i.e. the polyakov loop and the @xmath13-s are the link matrices in the time direction .",
    "@xmath14 is needed for renormalization , and depends only on the lattice spacing ( see below ) .",
    "@xmath15 is the additional free energy due to the presence of the heavy quark  anti - quark pair .",
    "we can ask for the grand canonical potential of the heavy quark system , if we place it into a medium with @xmath0 temperature and @xmath1 chemical potential . one can modify the above formula in an obvious way @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the additional grand canonical potential due to the presence of the heavy quark  anti - quark .",
    "both @xmath15 and @xmath17 contain the self - energy of the static quarks . at @xmath5 , @xmath10 one usually normalizes the potential at a given distance : e.g. by demanding that @xmath18 .",
    "here we used the sommer scale ( @xmath19 fm ) .",
    "the @xmath4 independent shift , which is applied to the potential to satisfy the renormalization condition , is just the self - energy at a given lattice spacing .",
    "this @xmath5 shift has to be removed from the finite @xmath20 potentials as well . using these renormalized grand canonical potentials the renormalization of the polyakov - loop",
    "can also be done ( e.g. @xcite ) . in eq .",
    "( [ eq : free_g ] ) we need the expectation value of the polyakov - loop correlator for non - vanishing @xmath1 values . for moderate chemical potentials",
    "one can use the multi - parameter reweighting : one generates configurations at @xmath10 and reweights the generated ensemble in the @xmath21 and @xmath1 parameters , simultaneously .",
    "the new parameters are usually chosen to improve the overlap between the simulated and the target configurations , or saying it in another way to reduce the systematic errors of reweighting to as small as possible .",
    "starting from the transition point at @xmath10 the overlap is maximized along the transition line .",
    "however one is not forced to follow the transition line during the reweighting .",
    "the transition ensemble contains enough information about both the confined and the deconfined phases so a constant @xmath0 reweighting is also possible .",
    "( though this reweighting can not reach as far in @xmath1 as the one along the transition line . )",
    "the reweighting formula for the polyakov - loop correlator is : @xmath22 after diagonalizing the transformed fermion matrix the @xmath23 weights can be calculated for arbitrary @xmath1 values using the explicit formula of @xcite .",
    "we studied qcd with @xmath24 flavors of dynamical staggered quarks at physical quark masses , that is at @xmath25 and @xmath26 on @xmath27 lattices .",
    "150 000 configurations were simulated at the critical gauge coupling : @xmath28 .",
    "the scale was set using the sommer prescription .",
    "the wilson - loops were measured on @xmath29 lattices for relatively high quark masses .",
    "the scale for the physical quark mass is obtained from a chiral extrapolation : @xmath30 .",
    "note that the sommer - scale depends weakly on the quark mass , therefore the extrapolation is quite safe .     along the @xmath31 line for @xmath32 .",
    "higher @xmath1 corresponds to lower curve.,width=302 ]     as the function of @xmath1 for distances @xmath33 along the transition line .",
    "larger @xmath4 corresponds to higher curve.,width=302 ]    since @xmath21 changes along the critical line , it is necessary to deal with the problem of renormalization . in order to follow our renormalization prescription described in sec .",
    "2 we calculated the @xmath5 potentials not only at @xmath34 but at further two @xmath21 values . from the values of the potentials at a reference distance ( in our case @xmath35 ) one gets a @xmath21 dependent shift , which is used to renormalize the potentials along the critical line .    on fig .",
    "[ fig : f_crit ] the potential is plotted as the function of the distance for various chemical potentials .",
    "the reweighting was done along a constant temperature line . for higher @xmath1 values",
    "the potential flattens out at short distances , whereas for smaller @xmath1 values it reaches its asymptotic value only at larger distances .",
    "[ fig : g_crit ] shows the potentials as the function of @xmath1 .",
    "the reweighting is done along the transition line . until the critical point ( which is around @xmath36 )",
    "only slight changes can be observed .",
    "after this point the errors get enlarged .",
    "since there is only a small change in @xmath21 , the renormalization has only a small effect on the result .    , i.e. the difference in the correlator to the @xmath10 case as the function of @xmath1 . the distance is @xmath37 .",
    ", width=302 ]    it can be instructive to examine the change in the polyakov - loop correlator along the transition line .",
    "[ fig : corr ] shows the difference in the correlator to the @xmath10 case for a given distance .",
    "the correlator starts to grow intensively before the second order endpoint .",
    "unfortunately , at the same time the statistical errors get enlarged .",
    "we have determined the heavy quark  anti - quark grand canonical potentials for non - vanishing @xmath1 values on @xmath9 lattices .",
    "we have presented results at fixed @xmath0 and various @xmath1 values as a function of @xmath4 .",
