    "a growing rough surface is one of the simplest patterns created by a nonequilibrium state .",
    "consequently , many studies have examined growing rough surfaces .",
    "two exponents characterize a growing rough surface .",
    "one is the roughness exponent @xmath5 , which relates the space length scale @xmath6 to the surface width @xmath7 , ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "the other is the growth exponent @xmath9 , which relates the time scale @xmath10 to the surface width , ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "a scaling function including these two exponents can be written as @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the dynamic exponent @xcite .",

    "the kpz ( kardar - parisi - zhang ) equation was proposed as an equation that models the dynamics of a growing rough surface @xcite .",
    "the kpz equation is written as @xmath20 , where @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 are the surface height , effective surface tension , lateral growth strength , and a noise term , respectively . since the kpz equation is a stochastic nonlinear differential equation ,",
    "an exact solution can not be obtained .",
    "however , the roughness and growth exponents can be calculated by the renormalization group method as @xmath25 and @xmath26 , respectively @xcite .",
    "it has been suggested that the scaling - law @xmath27 holds in the kpz universality class .",
    "although most numerical simulations follow this result , many experiments of growing rough surfaces show @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "however , the kpz universality scaling law is satisfied even in many experiments whose @xmath5 is larger than @xmath29 . in order to interpret the large @xmath5 ,",
    "several models have been proposed .",
    "these include the power - law noise model @xcite , quenched noise model @xcite , and correlated noise model @xcite .",
    "moreover , certain systems with a large @xmath5 obey ew ( edwards - wilkinson ) universality @xcite . in this paper , we focus on the power - law noise model .    the noise in kpz growth is ordinarily considered uncorrelated gaussian noise .",
    "zhang suggested kpz growth with uncorrelated power - law noise @xcite .",
    "he performed numerical simulations of a bd ( ballistic deposition ) model and found that @xmath5 varies with the exponent of the power - law noise @xmath30 .",
    "power - law behavior of the noise distribution was observed in a fluid flow experiment @xcite .",
    "therefore , the zhang model is considered a moderate model for growing rough surfaces .    on the other hand , barabsi et al .",

    "in ordinary variance analysis for the case @xmath33 , a mean field approximation has been applied to obtain the relations among @xmath5 , @xmath9 , and @xmath30 @xcite , and the scaling - law @xmath27 was confirmed .",
