    "( i ) for an incident angle @xmath243 larger than a critical angle the particle reaches the opposite boundary and leaves with transmission probability @xmath111 .",
    "( ii ) at the value of the critical angle , @xmath244 , the particle leaves the barrier region parallel to the barrier .",
    "( iii ) for angles @xmath245 , the particle makes the full turn under the barrier and is perfectly reflected , @xmath246 . in this semiclassical picture the critical angle @xmath247 is obtained from @xmath248 which relates the maximal barrier width @xmath249 that can be overcome at incident angle @xmath105 and energy @xmath250 .",
    "in fact , the curves obtained for the hcl , taking the results of ref .",
    "[ ] , are almost identical when plotted on the scale of fig .",
    "[ fig : resultb : polarplot ] , confirming the semiclassical point of view also for graphene .    in figs .",
    "[ fig : resultsb : zoom](b ) and [ fig : resultsb : zoom](c ) we show the transmission probabilities for both lattices as a function of the normalized magnetic barrier width @xmath236 at different angles and energies where the transmission for @xmath251 is very close to unity . however , the @xmath0  lattice reveals as more transparent than the hcl , so that the latter is seen to develop quantum interference oscillations as a function of the barrier width .",
    "we have analyzed transmission properties of barriers on the @xmath0  lattice in the low energy approximation using the dirac - like hamiltonian ( [ model ] ) .",
    "first we derived and discussed the boundary conditions for the wave function at a given interface .",
    "wave function components of rim sites can be discontinuous , whereas the hub component is continuous ; this can be well understood in terms of the probability currents perpendicular and parallel to the barrier .",
    "an electrostatic barrier on @xmath0  has enhanced transparency compared to the hcl , which is a direct consequence of the specific boundary conditions of the @xmath6 hamiltonian .",
    "when the energy of the incoming wave equals half the barrier hight , we even obtain perfect transmission independently of the incident angle .",
    "this `` super klein - tunneling '' makes it possible to use a @xmath252-junction in order to design a perfect focusing lens without loss ; this must be contrasted to the 50@xmath253 of loss of hcl in the same configuration .",
    "therefore , we believe that @xmath0  can be interesting from the point of view of electron focusing and photonic crystals.@xcite    furthermore , we have confirmed numerically the analytical predictions about the super klein - tunneling via a lattice green s function method .",
    "in addition , we have investigated numerically the influence of the intervalley scattering in the @xmath0  lattice compared to the hcl and identified the crucial role of the flat band .    for a uniform magnetic field",
    "we have discussed the lls ; their energies differ from non - relativistic and from relativistic systems known so far .",
    "@xmath0  exhibits a high density of states at zero energy due to contributions from a zeroth ll and a topological level .",
    "finally , we have investigated the transmission through a magnetic barrier in @xmath0  which is found to be similar compared to the case of the hcl .",
    "both cases can be understood in a simple semiclassical picture from circular cyclotron orbits under the barrier .",
    "magnetic barriers of sufficient width can be used to confine particles in the @xmath0  lattice .",
    "we acknowledge a.  de martino , h.  grabert , v.  krckl , and p.  recher for useful discussions .",
    "the work of db is supported by the excellence initiative of the german federal and state governments .",
    "we can obtain the boundary conditions from the low energy wave equation together with the conservation of the probability current .",
    "the former states that @xmath254 , the latter that @xmath255 .    for the case of graphene and with the two component spinor @xmath256",
    "we get the following condition :    [ eq : graphene ] @xmath257 - 2v_\\text{f } \\partial_y { \\rm im}[\\psi_\\text{a}^*\\psi_\\text{b}]\\\\ & = -(\\partial_x j_x + \\partial_y j_y)\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    therefore , we can identify the two components of the probability current @xmath258,{\\rm im}[\\psi_\\text{a}^*\\psi_\\text{b}])^\\text{t}.\\ ] ] at an interface we require the continuity of the probability current @xmath55 perpendicular to the boundary .",
    "this implies for the hcl the continuity of the two components of the wave function @xmath259 at the interface .    on the other hand ,",
    "for the case of the @xmath0  lattice and the three - component spinor @xmath260 , we get    @xmath261 \\nonumber \\\\ & \\hspace{1 cm } + \\sqrt{2 } v_\\text{f } \\partial_y { \\rm im}[\\psi_\\text{h}^*(\\psi_\\text{a}-\\psi_\\text{b})]\\\\ & = -(\\partial_x j_x + \\partial_y j_y)\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in this case the probability current is defined by @xmath262,{\\rm im}[\\psi_\\text{h}^*(\\psi_\\text{a}-\\psi_\\text{b})])^\\text{t}.\\ ] ] the conservation of the @xmath10 component of the current corresponds indeed to eqs .  .",
    "the transmission probability through the magnetic barrier discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : magneticbarrier ] is obtained by imposing the matching conditions at @xmath263 that after basic algebraic manipulation read @xmath264 with @xmath265 .",
    "the prime denotes the derivative with respect to the coordinate .",
    "the expression for the resulting transmission is lengthy .",
    "it can be written in a more compact form when introducing the function @xmath266 and its derivatives @xmath267 with respect to the first / second argument .",
