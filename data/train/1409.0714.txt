    "this report describes the simulations performed by the uppsala group concerning the ion stopping efficiency at the igisol fission ion guide @xcite .",
    "one application of the igisol technique is to study independent fission yields , i.e. to determine distribution of fission products over mass a and charge z. @xcite .",
    "the emitted fission products are identified using the penning trap jyfltrap .",
    "fission is induced e.g.  by a proton beam impinging on a natural uranium target ( 15mg/@xmath0 thick ) and one of the two fragments is emitted in the direction of the stopping chamber ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the cyclotron beam irradiates the u - sample tilted 7 degrees with respect to the beam direction , in order to increase the effective target thickness . in order to reach the stopping chamber ,",
    "resulting fission products have to escape the uranium target and to pass a separating ni foil ( 1mg/@xmath0 ) .",
    "the purpose of the ni foil is to prevent the plasma created by the beam from getting into the ion guide .",
    "helium gas held at a pressure of 200torr ( @xmath1 mbar ) is used to collect the ions in the stopping chamber .",
    "if the fission products are slowed down sufficiently , they can be collected by the he - gas flow and extracted to the mass separator .",
    "this work investigates to what extent different ion properties affect the stopping efficiency .",
    "the fission process produces a wide range of nuclides with atomic masses ranging from @xmath2 70 to 160 .",
    "in addition , fragments show a large spread of kinetic energies , @xmath3 0.3 - 1.2mev / u . therefore it is important to understand the differences in stopping power as a function of mass , charge and energy .",
    "eventually the purpose is to decrease the systematic uncertainty of fission measurements at the igisol facility .          for the current simulations it is important to consider some main aspects on the properties of nuclear fission .",
    "firstly , the large spread in different nuclides produced .",
    "secondly , the wide variation in kinetic / excitation energy .",
    "thirdly , the difference between the pre - neutron emission fragments and the fission products ( hence the link to the prompt neutron emission ) . for an extensive survey on the fission process",
    "the reader is referred to ref . @xcite and references therein .    in this chapter , we consider fission of actinide nuclei .",
    "an actinide nucleus has relatively low binding energy and can undergo fission by adding relatively small activation energy .",
    "fissile nuclei ( e. g. @xmath4u , @xmath5np ) have odd number of neutrons and can fission with thermal neutrons , in contrast to fertile nuclei ( e. g. @xmath6u , @xmath7np ) , which need larger neutron kinetic energy .",
    "when a nucleus captures a neutron ( or a charged particle or a photon ) it gets excited above the ground state and may overcome the fission barrier .",
    "nuclear deformation gives rise to a strong reduction in nuclear force as a function of elongation , in contrast to the repelling coulomb interaction .",
    "the two fragments begin to form , and as soon as the nucleus reaches a critical state ( saddle point ) , fission can not be prevented .",
    "classically the liquid drop model ( ldm ) was employed to depict the nuclear potential energy .",
    "the ldm , however , has not allowed one to explain such phenomenon as asymmetric mass split , prompt neutron distribution and isomeric fission .",
    "all these were explained later by introduction of multi - humped barrier which was implied by nuclear shell corrections @xcite .      due to the properties of the fission barrier , the formed fragments are typically not equally sized .",
    "it is commonly agreed that a higher outer fission barrier suppresses the formation of symmetric fission ( relative to the asymmetric mass split ) . at higher excitation energies",
    "the probability of symmetric fission becomes higher . at low and intermediate energies , one observes clearly an asymmetric mass distribution with the most probable masses around a@xmath3100 and a@xmath3140 amu , in case of fission of e.g. @xmath6u .",
    "this stability as a function of fissioing system , is due to magic shells for instance around z = 50 and n = 82 and deformed shells at n = 88 , albeit recent studies have suggested a rather stable configuration due to z = 54 @xcite .",
    "figure  [ figneutron ] shows a typical double - humped mass yield distribution .",
    "the modelling of the mass yields has been improved considerably due to the development in computation power .",
    "nowadays sophisticated models try to map the nuclear potential energy landscape in a multi - dimensional deformation space @xcite .",
    "fragment properties are modelled as a result of different fission mode selection , often together with a statistical population of states ( for example via a random neck rupture or a random walk along the potential energy landscape ) .",
    "the large energy release in fission is owed to the repelling electromagnetic force .",
    "about 200 mev energy , released in each fission event is found mainly in kinetic energy of the fragments .",
    "the q value is shared between the total kinetic energy ( tke ) and the total excitation energy ( txe ) .",
    "the tke is directly related to the pre - scission shape .",
    "compact pre - scission shape results in a larger repelling force and hence a large kinetic energy .",
    "the opposite is true for large deformation in the fissioning nucleus which results instead in a smaller kinetic energy release .",
    "the average tke is at maximum around masses a@xmath3110 and @xmath3130 and decreases as the fragment mass ratio increases . in addition",
    "the tke release is anti - correlated to the number of emitted prompt neutrons .",
    "the single fragment kinetic energy is strongly mass - dependent . due to momentum conservation ,",
    "light fragments have larger kinetic energies than the heavy fragments .",
    "in addition the energy stays fairly constant in the light fragments , as will be seen later in sect .",
    "[ secions ] .",
    "most of fission fragments are neutron - rich , and they de - excite promptly after scission , by neutron and gamma emission . the neutron emission is mass - dependent with a substantial decrease due to magic shells around a = 132 .",
    "figure  [ figneutron ] shows the mass distribution before and after neutron emission together with the neutron emission curve as simulated using the gef code for the @xmath6u(n , f ) reaction .",
    "the prompt neutron distribution is often referred to as the `` sawtooth shape '' .",
    "the increased number of emitted neutrons is a direct measure of the deformation of the nascent fragments .",
    "a fragment with a fairly spherical shape ( e.g. around a = 132 ) exhibits very low neutron emission .",

    "in order to select a representative set of fission products , the gef code was used to simulate the reaction @xmath6u(n , f ) at incident neutron energy @xmath9 mev @xcite .",
    "the gef output has the advantage of giving both mass- and kinetic energy distributions for both the pre and post - neutron emission cases .",

    "figure  [ figrub ] shows @xmath6u(p , f ) at proton energies of 20 mev and 35 mev compared to the gef calculations for ( n , f ) .",
    "the main differences emerge in the ratio between symmetric and asymmetric fission yields which is due to the different excitation energies .",
    "the range of possible fission fragments is however relatively similar .",
    "this is partly because of the same compound nuclear mass ( a = 239 ) and partly because of fragment shell structure which contributes to the final mass selection .",
