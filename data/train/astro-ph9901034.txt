    "several studies in the early 90s have shown that binarity is a very common property of low - mass main sequence stars : about 53% of g - type stars , 45% of k - dwarfs and 42% of m - dwarfs are in fact multiple in the solar neighbourhood ( duquennoy & mayor @xcite , hereafter dm91 ; mayor et al .",
    "@xcite ; fischer & marcy @xcite ) .",
    "an important issue for current star formation models is to account for the high number of binaries , and to predict their physical properties",
    ".    the relative number of binary systems may be even larger among much younger stellar populations .",
    "one of the best studied low - mass sfrs , the taurus - auriga dark cloud , hosts almost twice as many binaries as the solar neighbourhood in the separation range 22000au ( leinert et al .",
    "@xcite ; ghez et al .",
    "@xcite ; simon et al .",
    "yet , subsequent surveys of a number of other sfrs have led to somewhat conflicting results : while some exhibit binary excesses comparable to that of the taurus cloud ( padgett et al .",
    "@xcite ; ghez et al .",
    "@xcite ) , others appear to have similar binary fractions as field dwarfs ( brandner et al .",
    "for instance , the orion trapezium shows a binary fraction in good agreement with that on the ms ( petr et al .",
    "@xcite ; prosser et al .",
    "@xcite ) . duchne ( @xcite ) recently reanalysed in a consistent way these various studies and confirmed that the binary fraction appears to vary from one sfr to the other , with the main exception of all orion clusters whose binary fraction is similar to that of the field .",
    "several proposals have been made to account for these results .",
    "it has been suggested that the fragmentation process during the protostellar collapse yields a high fraction of multiple systems which , however , steadily declines over time as multiple systems are disrupted during their subsequent evolution ( ghez et al .",
    "@xcite ) . then",
    ", the binary fraction would depend on the age of the stars and would vary over a timescale of several 100myr ( patience et al .",
    "@xcite ) . alternatively",
    ", it is conceivable that the binary fraction of a cloud is established at the very beginning of the cluster history .",
    "kroupa ( @xcite ) has recently shown from @xmath7-body simulations that in regions as dense as the trapezium cluster the binary fraction could decrease from 100% to about 50% in less than 1myr due to gravitational encounters .",
    "still another possibility is that the binary frequency is sensitive to environmental conditions in the parental molecular cloud . in a qualitative study ,",
    "durisen & sterzick ( @xcite ) found that both the current fragmentation models and disk instabilities are compatible with a lower binary fraction in clouds with higher temperatures .    in order to distinguish between these alternatives",
    ", we started a long - term project aimed at studying binaries in clusters at different evolutionary stages , from the birthline to the ms .",
    "in bouvier et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , we already found that the binary frequency in the 100myr old pleiades cluster is similar to that of the ms .",
    "we report here the results obtained in the pre - main sequence ( pms ) cluster ic348 .",
    "this cluster was selected on the basis of its age being similar to that of the taurus cloud ( about 2myr ) , but its stellar density being much larger ( about 500starspc@xmath8 compared to a few starspc@xmath8 for taurus ) .",
    "ic348 is a young cluster located in the perseus molecular cloud , at a distance of about 320 pc ( herbig @xcite , hereafter h98 ) .",
    "it hosts a b5 v star ( bd+31@xmath9643 ) , about 100 optical sources ( trullols & jordi @xcite ) , as well as a few hundred infrared sources , which are probably embedded young stars ( lada & lada @xcite ) .",
    "the age of this cluster has been estimated by several methods : lada & lada , by fitting the imf , estimate that star formation is still going on after a burst @xmath1057myr ago ; luhman et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , hereafter l98 , found that a major burst occured @xmath11myr ago , but that stars as old as 10myr also lie in the cluster .",
    "similarly , from a dereddened colour - magnitude diagram , h98 estimates ages ranging from less than 1myr and up to about 10myr for about 100 members , with a median age of @xmath12myr . from a deep near - infrared survey , lada & lada estimated a stellar density of about 500 starspc@xmath8 or 220@xmath13pc@xmath8 ( within the half - mass radius of 0.47pc ) , and a projected surface density of about 1000 starspc@xmath14 in the central 0.1pc , similar to the ngc 2024 cluster in orion .",
    "h98 also evaluated masses for the members , and found that the median mass is about 0.5@xmath13 , in agreement with the imf estimated for this cluster ( which is very similar to the imf from scalo @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , h98 conducted an h@xmath15 survey , and discovered over 110 emission - line stars in a @xmath16 area centred on the cluster ; all of these stars are very likely to be young , active cluster members ; about 70 of them have independently been confirmed as members on the basis of colour - magnitude diagrams .",
    "preibisch et al .",
    "( @xcite ) performed a systematic x - ray survey of the area , detecting over 110 sources within a 1@xmath9-radius circle .",
    "we report on our adaptive optics observations of ic348 in sect.[obs ] , and estimate the binary fraction in the cluster in sect.[fraction ] . in sect.[properties ]",
    "we discuss various other binary properties ( especially the scarcity of brown dwarf companions in our survey ) , and sect.[discus ] presents a discussion on the link between the binary fraction and environmental conditions in sfrs .",
    "sect.[concl ] summarizes our conclusions .",
    "our sample was selected from h98 s list : all stars brighter than @xmath17 were observed , with a 75% completeness level at @xmath18 ; overall , the survey is two - third complete at the @xmath19 limit .",
    "mosaicing with small offsets from the brightest stars , about 25 additional fainter stars were surveyed . in total , we observed 70 of h98 s members ( within 66 independent systems ) ; we also observed 24 stars for which h98 could not assess membership .",
    "ten of these stars are considered as members by l98 , on the basis of the detection of the li @xmath20 absorption line and of spectral classification ( for late m stars ) .",
    "the observations were obtained during four nights in december 1997 at the canada - france - hawaii telescope on mauna kea .",
    "we performed near - infrared ( @xmath21 ) , high angular resolution imaging using the adaptive optics bonnette and the new infrared camera kir , a @xmath22 hawaii detector .",
    "the pixel scale is @xmath23/pix , yielding a total field - of - view of @xmath24 .",
    "most of the images are diffraction - limited in @xmath25 and @xmath26 , but the images of the faintest stars or those observed at large offsets from the wavefront star ( @xmath27 ) , have fwhm as large as @xmath28 ; fig.[example ] illustrates the image quality in our survey .",
    "we surveyed each target in @xmath25 , and all resolved systems were also observed in @xmath29 and @xmath26 ( with the exception of pairs formed by two stars already known as members ) .",
    "a typical observing sequence consists of 16 images , at 4 positions , with individual exposure times ranging from 2 to 30 seconds to avoid saturation of the sources . on the first night , the observing procedure was different , since we produced @xmath30 mosaics centred on the brightest stars close to the cluster centre . in these images ,",
    "the exposure time was such that no star was saturated ; the 5@xmath31 detection limit in these images is about @xmath32 .",

    "ukirt photometric standards were observed every night for the flux calibration .",
    "data reduction was performed with iraf packages .",
    "astrometry and relative photometry of binaries were obtained by psf fitting and then combined with large - aperture photometry to get the absolute photometry of each component . in two cases ( ifa100 , 102 ) deconvolution had to be applied to obtain the relative photometry",
    "; we used the iterative deconvolution analysis in c ( idac ) routine ( jefferies & christou @xcite ) , and cross - checked with the lucy algorithm . in the case of ifa184 , deconvolution was unsuccessful in the @xmath25 band , and we consider here the results from psf fitting , although we think that this method leads to an underestimate of the flux ratio in this specific case .",
    "estimates of the uncertainties are 0.05mag and 0.02mag for absolute and relative photometry , @xmath35 for the separation and @xmath36 for the position angle .",
    "the errors are slightly larger when deconvolution was applied ; when the adaptive optics system was locked on a binary system ( e.g. , ifa139140 ) , the psf was substantially deformed , leading to increased uncertainties on the centroid locations .",
    "our binary candidates are listed in table[photom ] , together with their astrometric and photometric measurements . to accept two stars as a binary candidate",
    ", we have set an upper limit for the separation of 8@xmath1 , corresponding to @xmath102500 au .",
    "this limit should avoid confusion between real companions and background stars ( see discussion below ) .",

    "we failed to detect the faint companion @xmath39 away from ifa159 , because the latter is a faint star ( @xmath40 , @xmath41 ) , which was observed in a mosaic on the first night , with a more limited dynamic range compared to that usually achieved on other stars . at the 5@xmath31 level ,",

    "the two other very faint companions ( marked `` back . ?",
    "'' ) are also likely background stars , although we lack multicolour photometry to prove it . for the binary ifa139ifa140 , we only have @xmath25 photometry available ; we believe it is a physical binary , however , because of its close separation",
    ". the membership of ifa140 could not be determined by h98 since no @xmath37 band photometry was obtained for this star ; l98 classify it as a member .",
    "similarly , ifa82 lacks @xmath66 measurement in h98 s study , so that its membership is not decided .",
    "we consider , however , the pair ifa85ifa82 as a physical binary , because of the late spectral type of ifa82 ( m4 , h98 )",
    ". for all other systems , the location of the companions in a @xmath25@xmath67 diagram suggests membership and thus physical association with the primary .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     as an alternative to an evolutionary process , it has been proposed that the binary excess observed in various sfrs was the result of an observational bias : since the mass - luminosity relationship is shallower for younger stars , it is easier to detect companions around pms stars than in the ms population ( zinnecker , priv . com . ) .",
    "the fact that we know several sfrs , now including ic348 , with no binary excess indicates that this bias is not responsible for the observed overabundance of pms binaries in some regions .",
    "the binary fraction that seems to differ between sfrs relates to binaries which cover only a limited separation range .",
    "if the separation distribution was different from one sfr to another , the overall binary fractions could still be the same for all of them : an excess observed in a given separation range could be balanced by a deficiency of binaries with shorter or longer periods .",
    "there is currently no such evidence , except perhaps for the study of the @xmath68 population in upper scorpius by brandner & khler ( @xcite ) .",
    "several arguments indicate that the orbital period distribution does not vary significantly between pms and ms binaries : the number of spectroscopic binaries in taurus is at least as large as that of the ms ( mathieu @xcite ) , lunar occultation surveys in this sfr have shown that the binary excess was present down to @xmath101au ( richichi et al .",
    "@xcite ; simon et al .",
    "@xcite , and pleiades binaries have a similar period distribution as dwarfs ( mermilliod et al .",
    "@xcite ; bouvier et al .",
    "@xcite ) .      considering ic348 , the trapezium ( prosser et al .",
    "@xcite ; petre et al .",
    "@xcite ) and pleiades ( bouvier et al .",
    "@xcite ) clusters , and the solar neighbourhood stars ( dm91 ) , we have four samples with no binary excess at different evolutionary stages ( pms , zams and ms ) . we thus conclude that the binary fraction does not evolve with time between these stages .",
    "any evolution of the binary frequency would have to occur within the first myr after the formation process .",
    "furthermore , the differing binary fractions between the various sfrs of the same age have to be explained , and a global time effect can not be responsible for this .",
    "one common property of all the clusters without binary excess is that they are all rather dense : ic348 has about 500 starspc@xmath8 , and the trapezium is about 10 times denser . the older pleiades cluster , which is still dense nowadays , was probably even denser when younger , perhaps similar to the trapezium .",
    "on the other hand , the sfrs with high binary fractions ( taurus , ophiuchus , chamleon ) are rather loose , with no more than a few starspc@xmath8 in the taurus aggregates .",
    "this seems to indicate that a link exists between the binary fraction and the cluster density .",
    "several physical processes could be the reason behind such a link .",
    "the impact of the average cluster density on the binary fraction could be direct ; for instance , in dense clusters , the number of gravitational encounters is high and the binaries could be massively disrupted in such clusters over short timescales . from @xmath7-body simulations ,",
    "kroupa ( @xcite ) has shown that in clusters as dense as the trapezium cluster the binary fraction could decrease from 100% to about 50% in less than 1myr .",
    "then , a model where all sfrs form with a high binary fraction ( i.e. , close to 100% ) , and where gravitational interactions between multiple systems are responsible for the decrease of the number of binaries , would be in qualitative agreement with the observational results : in all dense clusters , the binary fraction would have already decreased down to the ms level even for the youngest clusters in which binary fractions have been measured so far , while it would have remained high in loose pms associations .    alternatively , it is possible that the density is not the main parameter governing the binary fraction , but that another physical parameter , during or even before the star formation process , drives the subsequent evolution of the cluster , including its stellar density and binary fraction simultaneously .",
    "durisen & sterzik ( @xcite ) have shown that the current models of fragmentation and disk instability may imply higher binary fractions when the initial cloud temperature is lower . in general , cold giant molecular clouds",
    "may not be very efficient in forming stars , if the output of their fragmentation is small aggregates , with low densities ( like taurus ) .",
    "regions creating high - mass stars , on the other hand , have rather high cloud temperatures ; they usually from dense clusters , such as the trapezium cluster . the link we find between binary frequency and cluster density could then be an intrinsic output of the fragmentation process .",
    "other characteristics of the cloud before star formation occurs could as well be responsible for the observed linked between density and binary fraction . for instance , the nature of the pre - collapse equilibrium in the parent cloud may influence the mass , size and angular momentum of the fragmented cores , leading to differing binary fraction and cluster density .    environmental conditions at the time of star formation",
    "thus could have an impact on the resulting binary population ( i.e. , the total number of multiple systems ) . at the present time",
    ", it is not possible to distinguish between a very rapid temporal evolution of the binary fraction , during the first myr , or an intrinsic dependence of the binary fraction on these conditions .",
    "observations of even younger populations in embedded clusters , as well as determination of accurate orbital period and mass ratio distributions are needed to go further into the history of binary formation and evolution .",
    "from a high - angular resolution study of ic 348 low - mass members we find that the binary frequency in this very young cluster ( @xmath69myr ) is similar to that of the pleiades ( @xmath70myr ) and of low - mass field dwarfs ( @xmath71gyr ) .",
    "we therefore conclude that the binary frequency does not significantly evolve over time on a timescale of several 100 myr .",
    "instead , it appears that the binary frequency among low - mass stars is already established at very young ages , i.e. , within @xmath101myr after the formation process .",
    "in particular , a long - term evolutionary effect can not be responsible for the differing binary fractions found in different sfrs : on the one hand , taurus and ophiuchus exhibit binary excesses , on the other , the trapezium and ic348 clusters do nt . yet , all these regions have similar ages of @xmath1012myr .",
    "furthermore , in the ic348 sample , we do not find evidence for an evolution of the binary fraction or the orbital period distribution within the age spread of the cluster of about 10myr .",
    "a time evolution of the binary frequency , if any , is thus constrained to occur within the first 1myr of stellar evolution . after this time , intrinsic differences exist between sfrs regarding their binary content .    in spite of the large dynamic range of our images , no brown dwarf companion is found in ic348 binaries ( to the possible exception of ifa192b ) .",
    "the mass ratio distribution we find is consistent with the absence of brown dwarf companions to low - mass members of this cluster ; a similar conclusion was drawn for the hyades cluster .",
    "also , the mass - ratio distribution is not peaked towards @xmath72 , in possible contradiction with what has been proposed for the solar neighbourhood m - dwarfs population .",
    "further studies with larger telescopes will allow a better determination of this distribution .    comparing the results obtained on ic 348 to similar studies in other clusters",
    ", it appears that the binary fraction may be inversely correlated with the average cluster density , with dense clusters showing low binary fractions ( similar to field dwarfs ) , as opposed to the loose t - associations like the taurus - auriga and chamleon complexes where the binary fraction is larger .",
    "on the basis of this qualitative trend , at least two scenarios may explain the observed differences in binary fractions : either the formation mechanism always leads to an initially high binary fraction ( of the order of 100% ) and frequent gravitational encounters in dense clusters disrupt binaries on a timescale of 1myr or less , or specific initial conditions in the parent molecular cloud , such as the gas temperature , metallicity , angular momentum , etc ... , lead to different output of the star formation process and govern simultaneously the binary frequency and the cluster density .",
    "high resolution studies of embedded clusters even younger than those investigated so far are still needed to settle these issues .",

    "<S> we report on a near - infrared adaptive optics survey of a sample of 66 low - mass members of the pre - main sequence stellar cluster ic348 . </S>",
    "<S> we find 12 binary systems in the separation range @xmath08@xmath1 , excluding 3 probable background projected companions . </S>",
    "<S> an estimate of the number of faint undetected companions is derived , before we evaluate the binary frequency in this cluster . in the range @xmath25.07.9days , </S>",
    "<S> the binary fraction in ic348 is @xmath3 % . </S>",
    "<S> this is similar to the values corresponding to g- and m - dwarfs in the solar neighbourhood population ( @xmath4 % and @xmath5% , respectively ) . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the distribution of orbital periods of ic348 binaries in this range is consistent with that of field binaries . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that there is no binary excess in ic348 .    </S>",
    "<S> substellar companions are found to be rare , or even missing , as companions of low - mass stars in the separation range we surveyed . </S>",
    "<S> also , the mass ratio distribution is not peaked at @xmath6 in ic348 , and it is unlikely that an observational bias can account for that .    </S>",
    "<S> we do not find any evidence for an evolution of the binary frequency with age within the age spread of the cluster of about 10myr . </S>",
    "<S> comparing the binary frequency in ic348 with that of other star forming regions ( sfrs ) and young open clusters , we conclude that there is no significant temporal evolution of the binary fraction between a few myrs after the formation process and the zero - age main sequence ( zams ) and field populations . </S>",
    "<S> we find instead a trend for the binary fraction to be inversely correlated with stellar density , with dense clusters having a binary fraction similar to that of field dwarfs and loose associations exhibiting an excess of binaries . </S>",
    "<S> two scenarios can be suggested to explain these differences : either all sfrs , clusters and associations alike , initially host a large number of binaries , which is subsequently reduced only in dense clusters _ on a timescale of less than 1 myr _ due to numerous gravitational encounters , or specific initial conditions in the parental molecular clouds impact on the fragmentation process leading to intrinsically different binary fractions from one sfr to the other . </S>"
