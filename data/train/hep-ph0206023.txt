    "the description of electroweak symmetry breaking in the standard model , in terms of a fundamental scalar higgs field , suffers from a stability crisis .",
    "the quadratically divergent radiative corrections to the higgs mass suggest that the description of tev scale physics in the standard model is incomplete .",
    "new physics at the tev scale must emerge to stabilize the weak scale .",
    "recently , a qualitatively new category of realistic theories of electroweak symmetry breaking has been introduced @xcite .",
    "these models , based on deconstruction @xcite and the physics of `` theory space''@xcite offer a new mechanism for softening the quadratic divergences in the higgs mass .",
    "electroweak symmetry breaking is accomplished with naturally light higgs bosons that descend from non - linear sigma model fields whose mass is protected by `` chiral '' symmetries of the sigma model .",
    "the first attempts at models of this kind were the `` composite higgs '' theories @xcite that required fine tuning to keep the higgs light .",
    "more recently , models similar in spirit to the theory space models and using the same group theory structure as the composite higgs model have been developed @xcite . in all of these theories ,",
    "the physics is perturbative at energies parametrically above the tev scale , ultimately requiring an ultraviolet completion near where the non - linear sigma model fields become strongly coupled .",
    "however , the physics of electroweak symmetry breaking and the new physics at the tev scale are weakly coupled and do not depend on the ultraviolet completion . these models are fully realistic , incorporating fermion masses without producing dangerous flavour - changing neutral currents in the low energy theory .",
    "the general structure of these models is characterized by a `` theory space '' , consisting of sites , lines and faces .",
    "each site represents a gauge group , each line represents a non - linear sigma model link field transforming under the gauge groups at the ends of the line , and each face corresponds to `` plaquette '' operators involving a trace of products of the link fields bounding the face .",
    "the little higgs descend from the link fields , while their quartic coupling arise from the plaquette interactions .",
    "based on deconstructing extra dimensional intuitions , the models used in @xcite were @xmath0 deconstructed torus . the basic ingredients that make this class of models successful theory of electroweak symmetry",
    "breaking are the absence of one loop quadratic divergences in the higgs mass , guaranteed by the approximate chiral symmetries , and the presence of large quartic self interaction for the higgs .    in this paper",
    ", we seek a way of extracting the low energy physics of general theory spaces in order to decide which spaces can be used for electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "we also develop a method for building theory spaces with a given low energy particle content and potential .",
    "the spectrum of electroweak symmetry breaking theories based on theory space is characterized by two or more higgs doublets at roughly and at least one tev scale particle for each quadratic divergence of the low energy theory .",
    "in contrast with supersymmetric theories , quadratic divergences are canceled by ` partners ' of the same spin .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : homotopy ] , we review the structure of theory space and present a systematic procedure to calculate the moduli space of general theory space , allowing us to obtain the low energy potential of the theory .",
    "we illustrate this procedure with several examples .",
    "we then reverse the logic and show how to build theory spaces that possess arbitrary low energy physics .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : radiative corrections ] , we analyze the structure of radiative corrections in little higgs model , and present two simple rules that ensure that a theory space is free of quadratic divergences at one loop . in sec .",
    "[ sec : fermions ] we discuss how to include yukawa couplings so that they do not reintroduce one loop quadratic divergences .",
    "we also show that it is possible for fermions to generate the plaquette potential .    finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : lifting ] we discuss how to lift unnecessary states out of the low energy theory and into the range .",
    "when the gauge symmetry is reduced at one site new plaquette potentials are allowed that can differentiate between the adjoint states and higgs ( these are the @xmath1 plaquettes of @xcite ) .",
    "this allows us to build models free of light triplet and singlet scalars that were present in other little higgs models constructed from theory space @xcite .",
    "in particular we present an extension of the two sites model of @xcite where the @xmath2 gev triplet and singlet scalars of @xcite are pushed to the tev scale .",
    "there are general statements we can make about the existence of little higgs and their potentials from the structure of theory space alone . understanding the general structure of theory space and its relation to the low energy dynamics",
    "will allow us to classify the little higgs theories and determine if they are viable models of electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "the physics of little higgs models is specified by the gauge structure , the link variables and the scalar potential , these define theory space by points , lines , and faces , respectively .",
    "gauge groups are labeled by points : @xmath3 .",
    "link variables are labeled by line segments , @xmath4 that transform as bifundamentals under the endpoints of the line @xmath5 @xmath6 finally the plaquette potentials are interpreted as shaded in faces and are the product of the link fields that bound the faces : @xmath7 .",
    "the lagrangian for a theory space is given by : @xmath8    the full gauge group of a theory space is given by the product of the gauge groups associated with each sites : @xmath9 .",
    "however , only a small subgroup of this gauge symmetry is realized linearly on the @xmath10 .",
    "this is the low energy unbroken subgroup under which : @xmath11 so long as all the link fields connect two sites , for each disconnected component of theory space there is an unbroken gauge symmetry corresponding to the diagonal subgroup of the product of all the gauge groups associated with the sites in the given component .    to build realistic models of electroweak symmetry breaking",
    ", the higgs must transform as @xmath12 under @xmath13 .",
    "however , if all the gauge groups of a theory space are the same and the link fields transform as bifundamentals , the scalars of the theory will be adjoints under the unbroken gauge group .",
    "one way of solving this problem is to reduce the gauge symmetry at one of the sites .",
    "we will in general take all the sites to be @xmath14 gauge group except one where we will gauge only @xmath15 .",
    "the link fields are @xmath16 matrices and a link that touch the site of reduced gauge symmetry transform as : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is to have the higgs doublet have hypercharge @xmath19 . ] and where @xmath20 commutes with @xmath1 .",
    "the unbroken diagonal subgroup is the electroweak @xmath13 and the scalars of the theory will decompose into triplets , doublets and singlet of the unbroken @xmath21 .",
    "the site of reduced symmetry allows for interesting possibilities that will be discuss in sec .",
    "[ sec : lifting ] , but for the discussion of the present section , it is irrelevant .    we want to study the low energy physics of these models at scales beneath the modes that have tree - level masses .",
    "this can be done by integrating out the massive modes , but this is a cumbersome procedure . to integrate out the heavy modes and have the low energy theory ,",
    "it is necessary to find the full spectrum of the theory and to find all trilinear interactions involving two light scalars and a heavy scalar and all quartic interactions with only light scalars .",
    "when heavy scalars are integrated out , trilinear interactions involving two light scalars and a heavy scalar can exactly cancel a quartic interaction with only light scalars .",
    "verifying which light scalars have a tree - level quartic interaction is therefore rather intricate and avoiding this procedure is desirable .",
    "the moduli space captures much of the relevant low energy physics in the scalar sector and calculating this space will be the primary goal of this section .",
    "we first explain the procedure for calculating the moduli space of a general theory space and then illustrate it with several examples .",
    "the moduli space is gauge invariant , meaning that we can gauge fix in any convenient manner . if theory space is arc - wise connected , then it is possible to draw a simply connected line through theory space that touches every point only once .",
    "all the links along this line can be gauged away and this procedure completely fixes the gauge .",
    "when theory space is not arc - wise connected , there is no simple rule and we must gauge fix by hand . to find the physical spectrum it is more convenient to go to unitary gauge which is a more difficult task .    after gauge fixing",
    ", we minimize the plaquette potential by setting the products of link fields corresponding to faces to the identity matrix .",
    "this minimization will fix most of the link fields .",
    "the interesting part of the moduli space is then specified by relations between the remaining link fields .",
    "the flat directions of this moduli space are the little higgs of the theory . to reproduce this moduli space in the low energy effective action",
    ", we include the relations as a potential so that as we go off the moduli space there is an energy cost .",
    "theories that have no relations must have potentials generated radiatively and therefore have the same generic problems that typical pseudo - goldstone bosons suffer from  that it is not possible to have a parametric separation between the cut - off and the vacuum expectation value .",
    "identifying interesting little higgs theories reduces to finding theory spaces with interesting relations .",
    "the procedure of gauge fixing then minimizing the potential is precisely equivalent to calculating the fundamental group of theory space ( or first homotopy group ) , see chapter four of @xcite for more details . in the equivalence ,",
    "little higgs are non - contractible cycles on theory space and the low energy potential is the relation in the homotopy group .",
    "this links all the relevant low energy physics to topological properties and is independent of the tiling of theory space chosen .",
    "when the tilings are taken to be large , the physics of theory space is identical to the physics of an extra dimension . in the extra dimensional picture ,",
    "the little higgs are flat gauge connections and are classified by the fundamental group . in the extra dimensional limit the physics of theory space and of extra dimensions are identical , however , this equivalence is valid for any theory space , including ones that bear no resemblance to an extra dimension .",
    "the relation between the low energy physics and the fundamental group provides a practical way for both analyzing models as well as constructing new models .",
    "a theory space that is topologically a circle is an example of a theory with a little higgs .",
    "this theory was analyzed in @xcite and in more depth in @xcite .",
    "the link fields transform as @xmath22 and can be written as exponential : @xmath23 .",
    "the lagrangian is given by : @xmath24 the ellipses represent higher dimension operators that are irrelevant at low energies .",
    "the residual gauge symmetry indicates that there is a massless gauge boson and @xmath25 massive vector bosons . of the @xmath26 non - linear sigma model fields , @xmath25",
    "are eaten by the massive vector bosons and one physical massless scalar is left over .",
    "furthermore , from eq .",
    "[ eq : lagrangian_circle ] , we see that this scalar does not have a tree - level potential because there are no plaquettes .",
    "we will choose to gauge fix in a manner that eliminates as many of the link fields as possible .",
    "starting with @xmath27 , we can choose gauge transformations @xmath28 and @xmath29 so that @xmath30 .",
    "similarly it is possible to gauge away @xmath31 with @xmath32 .",
    "it is possible to gauge away all but one of the links .",
    "it is not possible to gauge away the last field because the last link closes the circle and the gauge freedom for @xmath28 had already been used to fix @xmath27 . in this gauge",
    "the physical scalar , @xmath33 , mixes with the gauge fields , therefore this gauge is inconvenient for calculating the physical spectrum of gauge bosons .",
    "unitary gauge is more convenient for computing the spectrum because there is no vector - scalar mixing",
    ". we can interpret @xmath34 as a classical modulus of the theory .",
    "this classically massless mode is a pseudo - goldstone boson called a little higgs .",
    "the low energy effective action is just : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is an adjoint under the unbroken gauge symmetry .",
    "a potential for @xmath36 that lift the moduli space will be generated at one loop , however , the only gauge invariant operators are of the form @xmath37 .",
    "the pseudo - goldstone boson , @xmath36 , can not have significant self - interaction without having a significant mass .",
    "this form of the low energy potential is too constrained to be used for electroweak symmetry breaking as it does not allow for a parametric separation between the vacuum expectation value of the little higgs and the cutoff of the theory .",
    "next , consider a theory space with the topology of a disk by adding the plaquette @xmath38 .",
    "this space has no non - contractible cycles and therefore has no little higgs . after filling in theory space with more sites , links and plaquettes",
    ", we can make `` holes '' in a disk by omitting plaquettes .",
    "this creates non - contractible cycles in theory space .",
    "a theory space with the topology of a disk with two holes is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : disc2holes ] .",
    "we can gauge fix by drawing a line through theory space that goes through every points . upon minimizing the potential , there are two moduli corresponding to the two non - contractible cycles .",
    "these moduli are arbitrary non - linear sigma model fields because there is no relation for the homotopy group .",
    "this means that there is no tree - level potential in the low energy theory and any deconstruction of this space will be unsuitable for electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "the existence of two little higgs does not guarantee a tree level potential . because of the homotopy arguments , a disk with @xmath39 holes will have @xmath39 little higgs , but none of these scalars will ever have a tree - level potential because the fundamental group of theory space is ( in the notation of @xcite ) @xmath40 , where @xmath41 are the non - contractible cycles on theory space and `` @xmath42 '' represents that there is no relation between the cycles .      a theory space that is topologically a torus has two little higgs .",
    "the primary new feature with this theory space is the appearance of a relation in the definition of the fundamental group : @xmath43 this will lead to a tree - level potential for the little higgs associated with the cycles @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "consider an @xmath46 sites deconstruction of a torus with the sites labeled @xmath47 .",
    "we will take our fields to be @xmath48 and @xmath49 . to make this space topologically a torus",
    ", we periodically identify @xmath50 .",
    "this theory breaks the @xmath51 gauge symmetry down to the diagonal subgroup @xmath52 .",
    "there are @xmath53 nambu - goldstone bosons that are eaten by the massive vectors . from the continuum limit",
    ", we suspect that the potential gives mass to @xmath53 of the physical modes leaving two modes massless .",
    "the lagrangian for theory space is given by : @xmath54 where @xmath55 we can see that there are two massless modes in this theory from the fact that the @xmath56 plaquettes terms @xmath57 give masses to @xmath53 of the scalars .    to analyze the model in more details , we first gauge fix to eliminate as many fields as possible .",
    "we then minimize the potentials by requiring that @xmath58 .",
    "this procedure is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : torus ] .",
    "we find that the vacuum is given by : @xmath59 this is the classical moduli space : two unitary matrices that commute . to enforce this in the low energy",
    "effective action we include this relation as a potential so that there is an energy cost for going off the moduli space : @xmath60 there is now a tree - level quartic potential , and masses are induced radiatively .",
    "this allows a hierarchy between the cut - off and the vacuum expectation value of little higgs that will allow stabilization of the electroweak scale .",
    "if one of the plaquette couplings of the torus is taken to vanish , the topology of theory space has changed . in fig .",
    "[ fig : torushole ] we compute the fundamental group and find that there is no relation between the cycles and therefore no low energy potential for the little higgs .",
    "we can calculate the coefficient of the potential for a general torus through a linearized analysis by diagonalizing the scalar mass matrix and then integrating out the massive modes .",
    "we find that the coefficient of the potential @xmath61 is given by : @xmath62 we see that if any coefficient vanishes , then the low energy potential vanishes precisely matching the topological argument .",
    "toroidal theory spaces of the type shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : torus ] are not the simplest theory space having the fundamental group of the torus ( eq . [ eq : homotopy_torus ] ) .",
    "consider a theory space with two sites , four bi - fundamental links @xmath63 and two plaquettes : @xmath64 this theory was first analyzed in @xcite .",
    "it can be easily analyzed by first gauge fixing @xmath65 to @xmath66 and then solving for @xmath67 .",
    "we are left with the relation @xmath68 which is the commutator potential of a torus .",
    "one can show that this theory space is related to the @xmath69 torus by orbifolding by a translational symmetry that sends all points @xmath70 .",
    "this symmetry acts freely and does not change the homotopy of the space and therefore does not change the little higgs or their self - interaction . the physics of this theory space is studied in more details in @xcite .",
    "finding the low energy physics from a theory space is a straight - forward procedure of gauge fixing then minimizing the potential .",
    "there is also an intuitive procedure for taking a low energy potential in the form of a product of nonlinear sigma model fields and finding a high energy theory that produces it at low energy .",
    "this construction is reverse engineering the theory space from the low energy potential .",
    "the most interesting theories to consider are the minimal ones .",
    "it is not difficult to conclude that the simplest potential that is viable for electroweak symmetry breaking is @xmath71 .",
    "this means that the theory space that produces this potential is homotopically equivalent to the torus .",
    "the simplest such theory with more than one site is the two sites four links model of the previous section . to illustrate this construction we will use non - minimal models that are still viable models of electroweak symmetry breaking .    given a set of non - linear sigma model light fields @xmath63 and a potential @xmath72 that is a product of the fields and their inverses , we draw out the potential as a polygon with each side being the corresponding link field . each link begins and ends at the same site , @xmath73 .",
    "for instance consider three light fields @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 and a potential @xmath77 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : xyzskel ] , we draw out the unfolded and folded versions of this theory space .    any theory space that tiles this minimal version of theory space will have the same low energy potential .",
    "dividing the plaquettes and links by placing new points and links in theory space will not change the low energy potential .",
    "for instance we can divide the theory space in fig .",
    "[ fig : xyzskel ] up in fig .",
    "[ fig : xyzmodel ] .",
    "we can also build different theory spaces that have the same low energy physics as the torus .",
    "figure [ fig : torus2 ] shows three such theory spaces .",
    "they are obtained by requiring a low energy potential of the form @xmath78 and tiling the original construction in different manners .",
    "+   +   +    finally , some spaces have fundamental groups with more than one relation . to construct theory spaces that are homotopically equivalent to these spaces we draw the multiple relations as disjoint diagrams although theory space is connected .",
    "fig : two relations ] a theory space with a fundamental group @xmath79 is constructed .",
    "we have shown how to analyze and build theory spaces with classically massless higgs and order one quartic interactions .",
    "this is not sufficient to ensure that a theory space can be used for electroweak symmetry breaking , as radiative corrections might make the higgs too heavy .",
    "we will show in the next section that in order for that not to be the case , theory spaces must satisfy mild constraints but there is still an arbitrariness to the theory spaces that produce a given low energy physics .",
    "without gauge couplings and plaquette interactions , a theory space with @xmath80 link fields has a @xmath81 global chiral symmetry , under which each link field transform as bifundamental under independent global symmetries : @xmath82 without couplings , the link fields are exact goldstone bosons with only derivative interactions .",
    "once gauge and plaquette couplings are included , some set of the chiral symmetries are broken .",
    "the coupling constants may be viewed as spurions that give rise to masses and non - derivative interactions .",
    "the essential feature of little higgs theories that guarantees ultraviolet insensitivity is that generation of operators containing mass terms for the little higgs requires many spurions .",
    "consequently , since ultraviolet physics is analytic in the parameters , quadratically divergent contributions to the little higgs mass are suppressed by many loop factors .    when building theory spaces there must be enough spurions so that there are no one loop quadratic divergences",
    "however , even if the one loop quadratic divergences are absent , generically there will be a one loop finite contribution to the little higgs mass so long as the little higgs is not an exact goldstone boson . infrared physics is not analytic in the parameters and the finite contribution is of the order of : @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the mass of lightest new state which generically is of order @xmath85 . using this relation",
    "we find : @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the ultraviolet cut - off of the theory .",
    "the infrared contributions are of the same order of magnitude as a two loop quadratic divergence .",
    "therefore , it is unnecessary to eliminate anything but the one loop quadratic divergence . the only benefit of eliminating divergent contribution of higher loop order would be that the little higgs mass would be calculable because the mass would be dominated by infrared physics , as opposed to having ultraviolet and infrared physics providing parametrically the same contribution .",
    "another possible reason for eliminating more than one loop quadratic divergences would be if a coupling was so strong so that loops involving this coupling were not suppressed .",
    "having to only eliminate the one loop quadratic divergences , the constraints on theory space are very mild and can be stated simply :    gauge sector : : :    every link must connect two different sites .",
    "scalar sector : : :    no plaquette can contain the same link twice .",
    "we can prove these rules by computing the quadratically divergent part of the one loop coleman - weinberg potential .",
    "we turn on a little higgs background fields and calculate @xmath88 where @xmath80 is the mass matrix of the theory in the presence of the background .",
    "we first consider the gauge sector and show that gauge interactions never produce one loop quadratic divergences so long as all the link connect two different sites or equivalently all link fields are in bifundamentals as opposed to adjoint representations .",
    "consider a link field between two different sites @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "the gauge boson mass matrix comes from the covariant derivative , @xmath91 a_j^b$ ] , where @xmath92 are gauge indices and @xmath93 = \\frac{f^2}{4 }   \\left ( \\begin{array}{cc }   { \\frac{1}{2}}g_i^2 \\delta_{ab } & -g_i g_j m_{ab}[\\tilde{u } ] \\\\",

    "if a field is in the adjoint , then this argument will break down and a one loop quadratic divergence will appear .",
    "we now turn to the scalar sector .",
    "consider an arbitrary plaquette : @xmath96 where @xmath97 are arbitrary matrices .",
    "we rewrite the link fields as a linearized fluctuations , @xmath98 , and a background fields , @xmath99 : by dividing @xmath100 in this way , the background field drops off the kinetic term and we can extract the mass of @xmath98 directly from the potential without having to worry about putting the kinetic term in canonical form .",
    "we expand out the plaquette to quadratic order in the fluctuations and find the mass matrix , @xmath101 .",
    "the diagonal of the mass matrix is @xmath102 where @xmath103 are gauge group generators .",
    "then summing over the diagonal entries of the mass matrix and using @xmath104 , we find @xmath105 which is just the plaquette operator .",
    "since , by definition , the plaquettes do no contain mass term for the little higgs , this shows that plaquettes never produce one loop quadratic divergences to the little higgs mass unless fields appear in plaquettes more than once .",
    "if a field appears in a plaquette more than once , than this argument will break down because the mass matrix will have a more complicated form with @xmath95 dependent diagonal entries .    we are left with two requirements for a theory space to have no one loop quadratic divergences : that no link begins and ends on the same point  that no link field is in an adjoint representation , and that no plaquette contains a link twice .",
    "these constraints can be easily satisfied , even with small theory spaces .",
    "these requirements place restrictions on the minimal field content at the tev scale .",
    "for instance , there must be at least a second @xmath106 ( or @xmath14 ) gauge symmetry broken around the tev scale with massive gauge bosons @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",
    "there must also be a massive multiplet of triplet , doublet and singlet scalars @xmath109 , @xmath39 , and @xmath110 at the tev scale to ensure that the scalar potential does not induce a one loop quadratic divergence .",
    "the standard model higgs is a pseudo goldstone boson in little higgs models and has the same quantum numbers as the kaon .",
    "the higgs mass is only protected from one loop quadratic divergences if we preserve some of the global @xmath14 chiral symmetry . in the gauge and scalar sectors of these theories",
    "this was automatic at one loop , however , in the fermion sector one loop quadratic divergences are possible if all the @xmath14 chiral symmetry that is protecting the higgs mass is broken by one coupling .",

    "a simple solution is to complete these theories into supersymmetric linear sigma models at this scale .",
    "these couplings introduce quadratic divergences of the form : @xmath124 this is just the usual quadratic divergence to the higgs mass coming from yukawa couplings . for everything , but the top quark , the yukawa couplings are small enough so that the quadratic divergences are small enough to be ignored . for the top quark , removing the one - loop quadratic divergence is of paramount importance .",
    "a solution was discussed in @xcite where additional dirac fermions were introduced on intermediate @xmath14 sites .",

    "similarly to the gauge and scalar sectors , we now have a rule for avoiding quadratic divergence in the fermionic sector :    fermion sector : : :    the top yukawa couplings must preserve either a left    ( @xmath131 ) or right    ( @xmath132 ) chiral symmetry .    the effective top quark yukawa coupling is @xmath133 meaning that @xmath134 and @xmath135 should both be at least order unity to have an adequately large top yukawa coupling .",

    "the emphasis is that plaquette operators are naturally generated with a sizeable coefficients from physics below 10 tev .    a simple realization of top physics inducing the entire higgs potential uses an additional colored weak doublet dirac fermion @xmath139 , @xmath140 . introducing two wilson lines @xmath141 and @xmath142 , we couple one wilson line to each two quark doublet in the yukawa interactions : @xmath143 where @xmath144 is a unitary matrix of phases and @xmath145 .",
    "the one loop quadratic divergence gives each plaquette : @xmath146 the one loop coleman - weinberg analysis gives a negative contribution to the higgs mass driving it negative and breaking electroweak symmetry .",
    "as mentioned in sec . [ sec : homotopy ] , the theory spaces we are considering for realistic models have mostly @xmath14 sites , one @xmath15 site , and @xmath147 matrix link fields transforming as bifundamentals under the @xmath14 chiral symmetries .",
    "scalars decompose into triplets , doublets and singlets under the unbroken @xmath21 . in all the models presented in the previous sections ,",
    "the triplets , doublets and singlets were classically degenerate . to construct realistic theories we need light doublets , but the triplets and singlets appear as extra adjoint matter that appears to make the doublets into a full @xmath14 adjoint multiplets . finding the minimal",
    "@xmath148 field content is an interesting question for phenomenological signatures of the model .",
    "the natural question is whether it is possible to remove the light triplets and singlets from the @xmath148 spectrum .",
    "until now we have considered plaquettes that were @xmath14 symmetric , and treated triplets , doublets and singlets on equal footing . in this section",
    "we generalize plaquette operators to include matrices that are invariant under the @xmath15 gauge symmetry , but break the @xmath14 chiral symmetry .",
    "this will allow lifting the extra adjoint matter up to the tev scale while leaving the doublets at the @xmath148 scale .",
    "the new types of operators that we will consider are of the form : @xmath149 with @xmath111 being the @xmath106 site and @xmath150 the analysis of the low energy physics of theory spaces that contain these generalized plaquettes proceeds as before , by first gauge fixing and then minimizing the potential plaquette by plaquette .",
    "however , the plaquette might not be minimized when the product of link fields is the identity as before . for a plaquette of the form : @xmath151 with @xmath152 real and positive , there are three different phases for the minimum , depending on the choice of @xmath73 and @xmath153 .",
    "@xmath154    with @xmath155 , @xmath156 , and @xmath157 , @xmath158 .",
    "typically the @xmath159 vacuum is uninteresting because it produces tree level masses for all the fields and we will not consider it any further .    the resulting moduli space might not be @xmath14 symmetric , and when the link fields are expanded around the appropriate vacuum , the number of triplet and singlet zero modes might be different than the number of doublet zero modes . to see how this happens ,",
    "consider a general @xmath16 special unitary matrix : @xmath160 then @xmath161 and a relation of the form @xmath162 indicates that around @xmath163 , the triplet and singlet , @xmath109 and @xmath110 are massive while the doublet @xmath39 is massless .",
    "we can now use this tool to lift the triplet and singlet zero modes that were present in the models considered until now .",
    "the most obvious set of relations that would produce this result is given by : @xmath164 the first relation guarantees the presence of a commutator quartic potential as in the torus , and the last two relations , when expanded around @xmath165 lift the singlet and triplet zero modes .",
    "we now need to build a theory space which yield those relations .",
    "we use a very similar procedure to the one described in sec .",
    "[ subsec : reverse ] . as before , we first draw the relations using only one site but we now insert @xmath166 as they appear in the relations .",
    "we then tile this construction in a way that satisfies the rules mentioned earlier .",
    "the insertion of @xmath166 represents a plaquette that is minimized at @xmath166 .",
    "[ fig : moose ] shows the building of the theory space in question .",
    "we can also build simpler theory spaces with the same relations .",
    "consider the two sites model presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : torus ] .",
    "in addition to the plaquettes in eq .",
    "[ eq : nelson - katz ] we add two new plaquettes containing @xmath166 .",
    "the total potential is given by : @xmath167 the analysis of this model is straight forward .",
    "we can gauge fix by setting @xmath168 .",
    "we then minimize the first plaquette which gives @xmath169 .",
    "minimization of the second plaquette gives @xmath170 .",
    "the third plaquette then requires @xmath171 .",
    "finally the fourth plaquette yields @xmath172 . therefore we see that this theory space has the same relations and consequently the same low energy physics as the theory space of fig .",
    "[ fig : moose ] .",
    "the spectrum of this theory can also be understood by expanding the plaquettes around the vacuum which we choose to be at @xmath173 .",
    "[ eq : omega ] , we can see the plaquettes give mass to three combinations of triplets and singlets and to one combination of doublets .",
    "one triplet , one singlet and one doublet scalar are eaten by the @xmath14 gauge field multiplet that pick up a mass and we are left at low energy with two doublet zero modes .",
    "these are the little higgs of our theory and they pick up a negative mass squared through top yukawa interaction which can be implemented as in sec .",
    "[ sec : fermions ] .",
    "there is a large stabilizing quartic interaction which is guaranteed by the potential and can be tied to the top quark yukawa coupling in the manner described in sec .",
    "[ sec : yuk2plaq ] . at the tev scale",
    ", the theory contains one doublet , three triplet and three singlet scalars and one multiplet of @xmath14 vector bosons .",
    "it also contains heavy fermions that were introduced in order to cancel the quadratic divergence associated with the top yukawa coupling .",
    "because the top yukawa is in general larger than the gauge couplings and quartic interactions , these heavy fermions will typically be the lightest of the new tev scale particles .",
    "the stability of the weak scale requires new physics at the tev scale .",
    "this physics could be strongly coupled as in technicolor models or weakly coupled as in supersymmetry .",
    "there is now a new class of models that stabilize the weak scale with weakly coupled new physics qualitatively different than supersymmetry @xcite .",
    "higgs bosons in these theories are pseudo - goldstone bosons and therefore naturally light .",
    "we studied models of this kind that can be described by general theory spaces .",
    "this generalize the analysis of @xcite which used toroidal theory spaces .",
    "the physics however remains the same : the higgs are pseudo - goldstone bosons and have their mass protected by approximate chiral symmetries .",
    "the quadratic divergences caused by couplings of the higgs to particles of the low energy theory are softened at the tev scale by `` partners '' of the same spin .",
    "the theory remains perturbative up to scales of @xmath123 tev where an ultraviolet completion is needed .",
    "the main result of this paper is the development of systematic procedures for extracting the low energy particle content and potential form arbitrary theory spaces and for building theory spaces that produce arbitrary low energy field content and potential .",
    "the former consists in calculating the classical moduli space of the theory by first gauge fixing and then minimizing each plaquette , and is equivalent to calculating the fundamental group of the theory space .",
    "we thus learn that the low energy physics of a theory space is determined by its topology , and different theory spaces with the same first homotopy group will have the same low energy physics .",
    "they will differ only in their tev scale spectrum .",
    "we also derived two simple properties that a theory space must satisfy in order to be free of quadratic divergences at one loop .",
    "this put some mild constraints on the shape of admissible theory spaces .",
    "we also showed a simple way of introducing the top yukawa coupling without reintroducing quadratic divergences .",
    "the one loop constraints make for minimal tev scale physics predictions . to solve the one loop gauge quadratic divergence there must be a @xmath107 and @xmath108 massive vectors in the range . to remove the one loop quadratic divergences from the tree level scalar potential",
    ", there must be at least pair of triplets and a pair of singlets in the range and an additional set of triplet , doublet of singlet scalars in the range . finally , for the top quark coupling",
    ", a coloured dirac fermion in the range is necessary .",
    "the lack of striking experimental signatures in the range is the surprising feature of this class of models . in particular , distinguishing this set of models from supersymmetric models from the two light doublets would be a challenging task at the tevatron or lhc .    finally , we made use of the presence of a site of reduced gauge symmetry and introduced generalized plaquettes that are gauge invariant but break the chiral symmetries ( the `` @xmath1 plaquette '' of @xcite ) .",
    "this allowed us to push to the tev scale the light singlet and triplet scalars that were present before @xcite and were the `` @xmath14 companions '' of the higgs doublets . using these generalized plaquette we built a minimal model of electroweak symmetry breaking from theory space .",
    "it is very similar to the model of @xcite but with the light triplet and singlet scalar lifted to the tev scale . in the 100 gev region",
    "the model has only two higgs doublets and in the tev range has three singlet and triplet scalars , one doublet scalar , one @xmath14 vector boson multiplet and one coloured fermion .",
    "little higgs theories are still largely unexplored and there are a lot of model building and phenomenological studies to be done .",
    "interesting possibilities include combining the ideas of @xcite with little higgs , pushing the cutoff to higher energies by using a `` cascade '' of theory spaces , detailed studies of collider signatures , and cosmological implications .",
