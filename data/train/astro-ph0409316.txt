    "the possibility of discovering new astrophysical phenomena through the observation of high energy neutrinos has inspired a number of recent experimental efforts .",
    "unlike photons and baryons , high energy neutrinos can traverse the universe without suffering energy losses and thus provide a probe into high energy phenomena throughout the entire universe .",
    "the study of high energy cosmic neutrinos also offers the opportunity to test particle interactions at energies well above terrestrial accelerators .",
    "however , the fluxes of known astrophysical sources are expected to be challenging low and uncertain .",
    "it is often claimed that the only _ guaranteed _ source of very high energy neutrinos are ultra - high energy cosmic rays ( uhecrs ) .",
    "ultra - high energy cosmic ray protons originating in extragalactic sources interact with the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation and generate neutrinos through the photopion production and subsequent pion decay @xcite .",
    "these neutrinos are called cosmogenic , photopion , or even gzk neutrinos as the photopion production responsible for their generation also induces a strong feature in the cosmic ray spectrum known as the gzk cutoff ( after greisen , zatsepin , and kuzmin @xcite ) .",
    "this cosmogenic neutrino flux has been extensively studied @xcite since it represents the best hope for detectability at high energies .",
    "however , the cosmogenic flux is not _ guaranteed _ because the composition and source of cosmic rays at the extremely high energies is unknown ( for reviews on uhecrs see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "while there is a common assumption that protons dominate at the highest energies , hard experimental evidence is lacking at energies above @xmath2 ev .",
    "recent composition studies indicate the dominance of heavier primaries between @xmath3ev and @xmath4 ev followed by a lighter composition up to @xmath5 ev @xcite . for a detectable cosmogenic neutrino flux ,",
    "protons are assumed to be the main cosmic ray primaries up to energies @xmath6 ev .",
    "here we show that even if the highest energy cosmic rays are heavier nuclei , such as iron , a significant flux of `` propagation '' neutrinos should exist @xcite .",
    "heavy nuclei are attractive as uhecr primaries because they can be more easily accelerated than protons in astrophysical sources ( their rigidity is smaller at the same energy ) , and they are more easily isotropized by magnetic fields .",
    "the absence of correlations between the arrival direction of uhecrs and candidate sources can be explained by the larger deflection of heavy nuclei in intergalactic magnetic fields .",
    "the interaction of heavy nuclei with cosmic backgrounds as they propagate through intergalactic space also generates a feature in the uhecr spectrum @xcite that should be detectable by future experiments , such as the pierre auger observatory and euso .",
    "the most relevant interactions between cosmic background photons and ultra - high energy nuclei are pair production in the field of the nuclei , photodisintegration of the nucleus , and photopion production .",
    "pair production has a threshold of 2@xmath7 , in the rest frame of the nucleus , and is proportional to @xmath8 for a nucleus with charge @xmath9 and mass number @xmath10 .",
    "figure [ fig : f1 ] shows characteristic time , @xmath11 , for the energy loss due to pair production on the cosmological backgrounds ( dashed - line ) as a function of energy for @xmath12he , @xmath13ne , @xmath14ca , and @xmath15 fe , where @xmath16    in figure [ fig : f1 ] , we also show the timescales for photodisintegration of each nuclei by plotting the single - nucleon emission process times ( solid lines ) .",
    "photodisintegration of a nucleus into lighter nuclei due to the interaction with background photons is dominant over pair production losses over most of the relevant energy range . in terms of background photon energy in the rest frame of the nucleus , @xmath17 , there are two important contributions .",
    "the first comes from the low energy range @xmath18 mev , in the giant dipole resonace region , where the emission of one or two nucleons dominates .",
    "the second contribution comes from energies between 30 and 150 mev , where multi - nucleon energy losses are involved . in this paper",
    ", we calculate this process by a monte - carlo method according to @xcite .",
    "these authors parametrized the total cross section @xmath19 as a function of photon energy in the rest frame of the nucleus .",
    "then the probability of photodisintegration per unit length @xmath20 is calculated by the following equation : @xmath21      d \\epsilon \\ \\ ; \\ ] ] where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the energies of the photon in the lab frame and in the nucleus rest frame respectively , @xmath24 is the differential number density of photons including the cmb and the infrared background ( irb ) @xcite , and @xmath25 is the lorentz factor of the nucleus .",
    "the term inside the bracket corresponds to the angle - averaged cross - section for a photon of energy @xmath22 .",
    "photodisintegration by the cmb is maximized when @xmath26 . in general , one or a few nucleons and a single lighter nucleus are emitted by this interaction .",
    "the lorentz factor is conserved at each photodisintegration interaction , though it is reduced by pair - production . in the case of iron primaries , photodisintegration is most efficient at energies @xmath27 ev , yielding a value of @xmath28 s ( 2 mpc ) . at lower energies ,",
    "the contribution of the irb is more important .",
    "because the irb density is much lower than the cmb density , @xmath11 increases rapidly at lower energies . for an iron nucleus of @xmath29 ev , @xmath30s ( 2.5gpc ) .",
    "the third process relevant for the propagation of nuclei is the photopion production off cmb photons .",
    "photopion production in nuclei occurs at energies above @xmath31 ev , i.e. , @xmath32 ev for iron nuclei . at these energies ,",
    "iron nuclei photodisintegrate completely in @xmath33 mpc .",
    "only iron nuclei with energies above @xmath34 ev have photopion interaction lengths comparable with that of complete photodisintegration . for the energy range we consider , the neutrino emission due to photopion interactions of the primary nucleus is insignificant when compared to the the photopion interactions of the secondary nucleons emitted by the nuclei lead to a significant neutrino flux .",
    "secondary nucleons emitted by the propagating nuclei suffer energy losses through pair production and photopion proccesses .",
    "the interaction length , @xmath35 , for photopion production is given by @xmath36 where @xmath24 is the photon number density per unit energy per unit volume for a blackbody spectrum with temperature t=@xmath37 k , and @xmath38 is the cross section for photopion production given in @xcite .    for a nucleon , @xmath39 ,",

    "neutral pions decay into photons while charged pions decay into @xmath42 ( or @xmath43 ) and @xmath44 .",

    "we calculate the spectra of particles arising from the propagation of high - energy nuclei by combining a monte - carlo simulation of neutrino yields due to nuclei propagation from single sources folded into an uniformly distributed source distribution .",
    "the single source neutrino yield is simulated using an adaptation of the code developed by @xcite up to a distance of 500 mpc .",

    ", iron nuclei are completely photodisintegrated at distances @xmath50 mpc .",
    "we ignore magnetic fields in this work , but it is clear that their effect is to shorten this distance considerably .",
    "the propagation of iron nuclei from the source generates a number of daughter nuclei and nucleons . for each nucleus",
    "we consider every photodesintegration process involving the emission of one or more nucleons .",
    "the interaction length is calculated for each photodisintegration process and a propagation distance is calculated for each channel by @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the interaction length for a given channel at energy @xmath53 and @xmath54 a random number between 0 and 1 .",
    "the channel with smallest @xmath55 is taken , and the nuclei are propagated in steps of 200 kpc to their interaction point . in each step",
    "the energy is updated to include continuous energy losses by pair production and adiabatic losses .",
    "adiabatic losses do not play an important role due to the small photodisintegration distances ( @xmath56 500 mpc ) .",
    "when the particle reaches its interaction point , we allow the interaction to happen with a probability given by the ratio of the interactions lengths for the energy before and after propagation to @xmath55 of the chosen channel following @xcite .",
    "protons and neutrons are propagated in a similar way to nuclei . in the case of neutrons , photopion production competes with neutron decay at energies larger than @xmath57 ev . when neutrons decay , the energy of the produced proton , electron , and electron antineutrino is calculated using free three - body decay .",
    "photopion interactions produce a nucleon and a pion that further decays producing neutrinos or photons .",
    "the propagation terminates when particles reach the most distant `` observation '' sphere , decay , or get older than the age of the universe .",
    "figure [ numneu ] shows the mean number of neutrinos produced per primary , for propagation distances of 100 , 300 , and 500 mpc , for proton primaries ( left ) and iron primaries ( right ) as a function of the primary s energy .",
    "the neutrino yield is fully developed for a source distance of 300 mpc . for iron primaries ,",
    "solid lines correspond to neutrinos produced in the decay of pions from photopion interactions , while dashed lines correspond to neutrinos produced by the decay of neutrons from the disintegrated nuclei . for energies above @xmath58",

    "[ lambda ] ) . in the disintegration of iron ,",
    "30 neutrinos are produced in the decay of 30 neutrons . above this energy ,",
    "no additional neutrinos are produced until the threshold for photopion production is reached . for larger energies , the number of neutrinos produced increases rapidly due to the photopion production of 56 nucleons per iron nucleus .",
    "figure [ dndloge ] shows the fluxes of electron and muon neutrinos produced by protons ( left ) and iron ( right ) after propagation over a distance of 300 mpc .",
    "the maximum primary energy is 10@xmath60 ev in both cases . for proton primaries ( left ) two peaks",
    "are apparent in the electron neutrino fluxes : the peak at lower energies corresponds to electron neutrinos produced in the decay of neutrons arising from photopion interactions , while the one at higher energies correspond to electron neutrinos coming from the decay of muons produced by pions . since electron neutrinos produced by neutron decay carry @xmath61 of the neutron energy , the maximum neutrino energy from neutron decay in @xmath1 ev , while the lowest energy is @xmath62 ev , corresponding to primaries at the proton photopion production threshold , @xmath63 ev .",
    "charge pion decays produce three neutrinos ( 2 muon neutrinos and 1 electron neutrino ) each carrying @xmath47 5% of the nucleon energy .",
    "therefore , the energy of neutrinos from charged pion decay ranges from @xmath64 ev down to @xmath65 ev . the average number of photopion interactions that a 10@xmath60 ev proton has as it traverses 300 mpc is @xmath66 .    the right panel in fig .",

    "the secondary nucleons emitted by photodisintegration have on average @xmath67 ev , which is just around the threshold for photopion production .",
    "thus , secondary nucleons from iron at 10@xmath60 ev have only about one photopion interaction on average , and a narrow peak of electron and muon neutrinos from the decay of the pions should be around @xmath68 ev .",
    "similarly , the spectrum of electron neutrinos from neutron decay should peak @xmath62 ev ) .",
    "these estimates are in good agreement with the results from our simulations .",
    "note that the spectrum of neutrinos is less broad in the case of iron primaries compared to protons , as most of the neutrinos arise from the first interaction of secondary nucleons which have a small dispersion in the energy .",
    "the amplitude of the iron fluxes may seem high compared to the proton case , but the small number of photopion interactions in the case of iron is compensated by 56 nucleons that can interact once .",

    "<S> we calculate the flux of neutrinos generated by the propagation of ultra - high energy iron over cosmological distances and show that even if ultra - high energy cosmic rays are composed of heavy nuclei , a significant flux of high - energy neutrinos should be present throughout the universe . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting neutrino flux has a new peak at @xmath0 generated by neutron decay and reproduces the double peak structure due to photopion production at higher energies ( @xmath1 ev ) . </S>",
