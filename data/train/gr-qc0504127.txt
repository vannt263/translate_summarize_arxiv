    "as suggested by bekenstein , a black hole may have an intrinsic entropy proportional to the surface area at the event horizon@xcite , and subsequently hawking provided quantum field theoretic calculations for the schwarzschild black hole@xcite .",

    ", quantum effects can be easily taken into account@xcite .",
    "introducing a brick - wall cutoff makes it possible to remove the divergent term due to the infinite blue shift near the horizon@xcite .",
    "the entropy from the brick - wall method consists of mainly two parts : the most dominant term compared to the logarithmic one gives the bekenstein - hawking entropy , and the other represents a typical infrared contribution at large distances .",
    "although this original brick - wall method is useful for various models@xcite , some difficulties may arise because it is assumed that there exists a thermal equilibrium between the black hole and the external field even in a large spatial region .",
    "obviously , this method can not be applied to a nonequilibrium system such as a system of non - stationary space - time with two horizons because the two horizons have different temperatures and the thermodynamical laws are also invalid there .",
    "solving these problems , a thin - film method as an improved brick - wall method has been introduced@xcite . in the thin layer ,",
    "local thermal equilibrium exists and the divergent term due to large distance does not appear any more .    on the other hand , in ref@xmath0@xcite , many black hole issues have been treated as field theoretical problems in fluid because this acoustic analogue was useful in that including its thermodynamics such as hawking radiation and entropy might be tested hopefully in the laboratory .",
    "moreover , a `` draining bathtub '' referred to as an acoustic analogue of a rotating black hole had been well defined@xcite .",

    "thus , in this paper , we would like to investigate the draining bathtub in terms of the thin - film method , which is helpful since the angular speed near the horizon can be approximately fixed to a constant . in sec .",

    "in order to calculate the entropy of a given system in the original brick - wall method , we consider a quantum gas of scalar particles confined within a box near the horizon of a black hole and introduce a cut - off parameter as in ref@xmath0@xcite . the free scalar field is assumed to satisfy the klein - gordon equation given by @xmath1 with boundary conditions @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the horizon , and @xmath4 and @xmath5 represent the inner and outer walls of a `` spherical '' box , respectively , and @xmath6 is an infinitesimal cutoff parameter .",

    "the series in the partition function ( [ z ] ) has a finite value for @xmath15 , but it becomes divergent for @xmath16 , so it is ill - defined . in order to resolve such problem caused by the rotation of the geometry , we deal with the mode solutions of the klein - gordon field carefully , which will be of the form , @xmath17 , for a rest observer at infinity(roi ) because there exist two killing vector fields denoted by @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "note that the angular speed @xmath14 in eq .",
    "( [ z ] ) appears in the thermodynamic first law for a reservoir , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath20 for a stationary rotating system .",
    "besides , the angular speed of a particle for a roi should be restricted because no particles can move faster than the speed of light . in fact , it takes a value between the maximum @xmath21 and the minimum @xmath22 given by @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the angular speed of zero - angular - momentum - observer(zamo)@xcite .",
    "it is clear that both @xmath25 converge to the constant value of @xmath26 near the horizon , so the angular speed of every particles near the horizon can be always thought of as @xmath27 . since the dominant contribution to the physical quantities of the system , such as total entropy ,",
    "is attributed to the quantum gas in the vicinity of the horizon , it is natural to assume that the system is in equilibrium with a uniform angular speed @xmath28 .    before formulating a generic free energy for a rotating black hole ,",
    "the density function defined by @xmath29 is introduced in order to calculate the free energy strictly , where @xmath30 is the number of mode solutions whose frequencies , or energies , are all below @xmath31 for a given value of angular momentum @xmath32 .",
    "thus , @xmath33 represents the number of single - particle states whose energies lie between @xmath31 and @xmath34 and whose angular momenta are @xmath32 .",

    "here , @xmath43 is 1 for @xmath44 and @xmath45 for @xmath46 .",

    "( [ ang : res ] ) , which will be explicitly shown in the following section so that global thermal equilibrium can not be achieved . instead ,",
    "if we consider scalar particles confined within a thin layer near the horizon@xcite , their angular speeds naturally take the same value of a constant @xmath27 due to local thermal equilibrium , and the thin - layer method is useful to find the thermodynamic quantities in our model .    apparently , the degrees of freedom of a field within a thin layer near the horizon play a major role in the calculation of the entropy of a black hole ; hence global thermal equilibrium is not necessary any more because particles are assumed to be distributed only in the narrow region .",
    "since it is well known that hawking radiation is derived from the vacuum fluctuation near the horizon , the bekenstein - hawking entropy should be associated with the field in this narrow region , where thermal equilibrium exists locally and statistical mechanics remains valid .",
    "this local thermal equilibrium is the main postulate of thin - film method , and the thermodynamic properties such as pressure and temperature near the horizon is assumed to vary slightly .",
    "the thickness of layer is supposed to be so small on a macroscopic scale that the physical quantities can be considered to be constant and that the narrow region can be locally in thermal equilibrium .",

    "( [ bc : period ] ) is replaced by @xmath60 , where the parameter @xmath61 is a positive physical small quantity related to the thickness of the layer .",
    "it means that @xmath61 has the scale over plank length , but the brick - wall cutoff @xmath6 is very small compared to the plank length .",
    "we now set up an acoustic analogue of a rotating btz black hole in order to investigate its thermodynamics with superradiance taken into account . in the irrotational",

    "we then consider a draining bathtub fluid flow described as a @xmath72-dimensional flow with a sink at the origin .",
    "if the metric is stationary and axisymmetric , the equation of continuity , stokes theorem , and conservation of angular momentum yield that @xmath66 is constant and @xmath73 , where @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 are arbitrary real positive constants@xcite . then , the velocity of the mean flow is given by @xmath77 .",

    "this means that no particle can move along with the angular speed of @xmath27 over @xmath95 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ang ] , so the spherical box should be located inside the critical radius @xmath95 . moreover , as discussed in the previous section , the radius of its outer boundary should be smaller than that of the ergosphere . then , the radial part of the sonic wave satisfies @xmath96    + r^2 n^4 k^2 ( r;\\omega , m ) \\psi_{\\omega m}(r ) = 0,\\ ] ] where @xmath97 .",
    "it can be easily shown that the function @xmath98 plays the role of the momentum eigenvalue in the wkb approximation .",

    "the contribution of @xmath102 to the following calculations is dominant near the horizon because @xmath102 is approximately @xmath103 and diverges as @xmath82 goes to @xmath3 .",
    "this tells us that the thin - film method is valid .",

    "in addition , there exists no infrared divergence since the large distance is out of consideration , while infrared divergent terms remaining in total free energy were cut off from consideration in refs@xmath0@xcite .",
    "it seems appropriate to comment here that for the limiting case of non - rotating acoustic black hole , @xmath111 , there are no sr modes due to the fact that the angular speed of horizon vanishes , @xmath112 ; in addition , there are no critical radius @xmath95 and no ergoregion due to @xmath113 .",
