    "a large number of concepts have been introduced over the years to quantify the `` size '' of sets of zero lebesgue measure , in order to be able to distinguish among them . among the most useful ones",
    "are a number of `` fractal dimensions '' of sets , such as hausdorff dimension and box - counting ( or minkowski ) dimension . generally speaking ,",
    "these dimensions arise as critical exponents when trying to cover or pack the set in an optimal way .",
    "there are , however , other geometric quantities that make the notion of `` zero measure '' quantitative .",
    "recall from the lebesgue density theorem that if a set @xmath0 has positive lebesgue measure , then it contains no `` holes '' , in the sense that for almost every @xmath1 , if @xmath2 is small then one can not find a large part of @xmath3 which is disjoint from @xmath4 .",
    "thus , the presence of `` holes '' of a certain relative size at all , or many , scales , is a quantitative notion of singularity .",
    "making this idea precise leads to a variety of concepts of porosity of sets .",
    "intuitively , it seems that both these notions are related : if a set has many large holes , then it should be easier to cover it by small sets . likewise ,",
    "if it is possible to cover a set with few small balls , then it must have many holes .    in this survey",
    "we will look at the connections between porosity and dimension , but we will concentrate on measures rather than sets . as we will see , one can define a variety of notions of porosity and dimension of measures , which allow to distinguish among , and quantify the degree of singularity of , measures on euclidean space .",
    "this is a finer study than for the case of sets , since any given set supports a large number of measures . indeed , for each result we will discuss for measures , a corresponding result for sets can be obtained as a corollary .",
    "we adopt the point of view that fractal dimensions are more naturally defined for measures than for sets .",
    "for example , there are dual notions of hausdorff and packing dimensions , but for sets the usual definitions are different in crucial ways .",
    "in particular , the definition of packing dimension requires an extra step . for measures ,",
    "the duality of both definitions becomes transparent .",
    "in addition to their intrinsic geometric interest , notions of porosity have found applications in a variety of areas , including the theory of quasi - conformal mappings , singular integrals , and complex dynamics . in this article",
    ", our focus will be on the key geometric problems , but examples will be briefly presented to give a flavor of the breadth of applications .",
    "we strove to keep the exposition of the main geometric concepts and methods as elementary as possible , but the examples assume familiarity with certain areas .",
    "another recent , but shorter , survey on porosity is @xcite . there",
    "the focus is on the proof of the `` large porosity '' sharp bound , while here we discuss the proof of the `` small porosity '' bound ( these concepts will be explained in section [ sec : connections ] ) .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in section [ sec : dimensionandentropies ] , we define the dimensions of a measure that we will need in the rest of the article , introduce the concept of local entropy averages , and state and prove the main result giving the connection between entropy averages and dimension . in section [ sec : porosity ]",
    "we describe porosity and mean porosity of sets and measures , and give some illustrative examples and applications . in section [ sec : connections ] , we explore the connection between dimension and porosity .",
    "we state the most general result on the dimension of mean porous measures , briefly discuss its history , and then give a partial proof of the `` small porosity '' bound . finally , in section",
    "[ sec : generalizations ] we present some further generalizations of porosity and explain its connection to conical densities and singular integrals .",

    ", logarithms will always be to base @xmath8 .",
    "let @xmath9 .",
    "if @xmath10 for some @xmath1 and small @xmath2 , it is reasonable to consider @xmath11 as a kind of dimension at the point @xmath1 .",
    "more precisely , the _ local dimension of @xmath12 at @xmath1 _ is defined as@xmath13 provided the limit exists . in general",
    ", one can always speak of the _ upper and lower local dimensions _ at a point , by taking @xmath14 and @xmath15 respectively .",
    "these will be denoted @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "lebesgue measure on @xmath18 has local dimension @xmath19 at all points .",
    "more generally , if @xmath12 is lebesgue measure on a @xmath20-dimensional immersed submanifold of @xmath18 , then the local dimension of @xmath12 at all points of its support is @xmath20 . for fractal measures ,",
    "the value ( and even the existence ) of the local dimension may vary from point to point , and may take non - integer values .",
    "the ( upper and lower ) local dimensions reflect the decay of mass of small balls .",
    "however , one is often interested in some global numerical quantity , rather than a function that depends on the point .",
    "since we are dealing with measures , it is convenient to ignore sets of measure zero . thus , in order to globalize the notion of ( upper / lower ) local dimension , it is natural to take the essential supremum or essential infimum of the local dimensions .",
    "this leads to the first of our key definitions : hausdorff and packing dimension of a measure .",
    "the upper ( resp .",
    "lower ) _ packing dimension _ of a measure @xmath12 , denoted @xmath21 ( resp .",
    "@xmath22 ) is the essential supremum ( resp .",
    "infimum ) of the upper local dimensions .",
    "the upper ( resp .",
    "lower ) _ hausdorff dimension _ of a measure @xmath12 , denoted @xmath23 ( resp .",
    "@xmath24 ) , is the essential supremum ( resp .",
    "infimum ) of the lower local dimensions .",
    "we note the obvious inequalities @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "all of the inequalities may be strict .",
    "in general there is no comparison between @xmath23 and @xmath22 .    for completeness , we recall the relationships between the dimensions of measures we have just defined , and the hausdorff and packing dimensions of sets . for the latter , good introductions",
    "are @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the proof of the following can be found in ( * ? ? ? * propositions 10.2 and 10.3 ) :    [ prop : dim - of - measures - in - terms - of - sets ] let @xmath29 .",
    "then : @xmath30    at first sight the above result may appear rather surprising , since the hausdorff and packing dimension of sets are defined in terms of the global structure of the set , while for measures we have followed a local approach . nevertheless , the proof of this proposition is not very difficult .",
    "the converse is a deeper fact : for any set @xmath4 , it is possible to find measures supported on @xmath4 of hausdorff and packing dimension arbitrarily close to those of @xmath4 :    [ prop : dim - of - sets - in - terms - of - measures ] let @xmath31 be a borel set .",
    "then : @xmath32    for hausdorff dimension , the above is the classical frostman s lemma ; see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 9.8 ) .",
    "the packing dimension version is due to cutler @xcite .",
    "we underline that in this article we will not make direct use of hausdorff of packing dimensions of sets ; proposition [ prop : dim - of - sets - in - terms - of - measures ] can be taken as their definition .",
    "an exception is section [ sec : generalizations ] , where some familiarity with hausdorff measures is helpful .",
    "see e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 4 ) for its definition and main properties .",
    "a very extended trick in analysis is to transfer a problem to a dyadic setting , and then profit from the tree structure of the family of dyadic cubes .",
    "one of the aims of this article is to show that this idea can be very powerful in dimension calculations , and in particular in bounding the dimension of porous measures .",
    "here we start by setting up some notation and making some basic observations .",
    "fix an ambient dimension @xmath19 .",
    "we denote the half - open unit cube @xmath33 by @xmath34 . for @xmath35 , we let @xmath36 be the collection of dyadic half - open cubes of step @xmath37 , i.e. @xmath38 further , we let @xmath39 be the collection of dyadic cubes of all levels .",
    "each @xmath36 generates a finite @xmath40-algebra which we denote @xmath41 .",
    "the sequence @xmath42 is increasing , and the limit @xmath40-algebra ( i.e. the smallest @xmath40-algebra containing all @xmath41 ) is the borel @xmath40-algebra of @xmath34 . given @xmath43 , we let @xmath44 be the collection of cubes in @xmath45 which are contained in @xmath46 . in other words , these are the level @xmath47 dyadic subcubes of @xmath46 .",
    "let @xmath48 . to avoid technical problems",
    ", we always make the standing assumption that @xmath12 assigns zero mass to the boundaries of all cubes in @xmath49 .",
    "this is usually not a restrictive assumption , since it is satisfied by almost every translation of @xmath12 , and many of the problems one is interested in are translation - invariant .",
    "another way to put it is that the dyadic frame is usually just a tool , and we can translate the frame at our convenience .    for any @xmath50 with @xmath51 and any @xmath52 , the measure @xmath12 induces a discrete probability measure with @xmath53 atoms , given by the relative measures of the @xmath47-th level subcubes of @xmath46 .",
    "more precisely , define @xmath54    we will write @xmath55 .",
    "for @xmath56 , this process can be reversed , and provides a flexible way to construct measures satisfying certain desired properties .",
    "namely , suppose that for each @xmath57 , a probability measure @xmath58 on @xmath59 is given .",
    "one can then construct a measure @xmath12 by starting with a unit mass on @xmath34 , and inductively splitting the mass of each @xmath60 according to the distribution @xmath58 .",
    "for example , suppose @xmath61 and @xmath58 is the uniform measure @xmath62 ; the resulting measure is then lebesgue measure on @xmath63 $ ] .",
    "more generally , if @xmath58 is independent of @xmath46 ( but not necessarily uniform ) , the resulting measure is _ self - similar _ , as the restriction to any dyadic cube is an affine image of the original measure .",
    "also note that , as long as each @xmath58 is globally supported ( i.e. each cube of next level inherits a positive proportion of the mass ) , the resulting measure @xmath12 will also be globally supported on @xmath34 , although it can be highly singular .    in general , if we construct a measure this way , it may happen that @xmath64 for some @xmath46 .",
    "indeed , this will happen whenever the boundary of some cube has positive measure .",
    "under our standing assumption , the process of forming the conditional measures @xmath65 starting with a measure @xmath12 , and of building the measure @xmath12 out of the family of conditional measures @xmath66 , are inverses of each other .",
    "the definitions of local , hausdorff and packing dimensions are in terms of euclidean balls .",
    "it is natural to ask what happens if one instead uses dyadic cubes .",
    "namely , let @xmath67 denote the ( unique ) cube in @xmath36 containing @xmath1 .",
    "given a measure @xmath12 supported on @xmath34 , we define the upper `` dyadic local dimension '' as @xmath68 ( recall that @xmath69 is the logarithm to base @xmath8 . ) likewise one defines the lower dyadic local dimension @xmath70 .",
    "the question is then : how do these quantities relate to the usual ( spherical ) local dimensions ?",
    "the potential issue is that @xmath1 may be very far from the center of @xmath67 , so one can not simply nest dyadic cubes and balls centered at @xmath1 to conclude that @xmath71 .",
    "and indeed it can happen that both are different at some points .",
    "the good news is that this can only happen on a small set :    ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem b.1 ) [ prop : dim - from - dyadic - dim ] let @xmath72 . then @xmath73 and likewise for the lower local dimensions .",
    "in particular , @xmath74 and likewise for lower packing dimension , and upper and lower hausdorff dimensions .",
    "there are a number of methods to estimate the dimension of fractal measures . in this section",
    "we describe an approach , using local entropies , that turns out to be useful to bound the dimension of porous measures , as well as in other geometric and dynamical problems .",
    "we recall some basic definitions and properties about entropy .",
    "if @xmath75 is a probability vector , its entropy is @xmath76 the entropy quantifies the `` amount of information '' or `` uniformness '' of the vector @xmath77 .",
    "one has @xmath78 for all probability vectors with @xmath79 coordinates .",
    "the minimum is attained exactly at vectors with some @xmath80 , and the maximum is attained precisely at the uniform vector @xmath81 . if @xmath82 is a measure with finite support , we define the entropy @xmath83 in the obvious way .",
    "now let @xmath72 , and fix @xmath84 .",
    "for a point @xmath85 , we can consider the sequence of conditional measures @xmath86 on dyadic cubes converging down to @xmath1 .",
    "these are discrete measures with at most @xmath87 atoms , so we can compute their entropy ( which takes values between @xmath5 and @xmath88 ) .",
    "it is reasonable to expect that for measures with large dimension , @xmath89 will be large often , while the opposite will happen for measures of small dimension .",
    "this turns out to be exactly the case .",
    "the following is a slight extension of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 4.2 ) ; this particular formulation is due to m. hochman [ private communication ] .    [",
    "thm : local - entropies ] let @xmath72 and @xmath84 . for almost every @xmath1",
    "we have @xmath90 in particular , @xmath91 for @xmath12-a.e .    before giving the proof , we make some remarks on this statement .",
    "although similar results have been obtained and applied in many contexts , theorem [ thm : local - entropies ] seems to be the cleanest and most powerful manifestation of the underlying idea . at first sight , it might seem that one is replacing a simple quantity - decay of mass - with an average of a more involved expression . nevertheless , the latter is sometimes much more convenient , for the following reasons :    1 .",
    "one often has some information on the geometric distribution of a measure in small balls , and would like to convert that into information on the actual measure of small balls .",
    "as we will see , this is precisely the case when one deals with porosity properties .",
    "the entropy averages in the theorem are very natural from the dynamical point of view .",
    "in fact , theorem [ thm : local - entropies ] can be seen as a version of the shannon - mcmillan - breiman theorem for general ( non - invariant ) measures .",
    "3 .   related to the above is the fact that averages are often convenient to deal with .",
    "for example , if one lacks any control on the measure at a small number of scales , this will have small or little effect on the average .",
    "4 .   likewise , entropy has many pleasant properties that are exploited throughout ergodic theory and can also be useful in applying theorem [ thm : local - entropies ] .",
    "one basic example is the concavity of the entropy function @xmath92 .",
    "the proof of theorem [ thm : local - entropies ] is a straightforward application of the law of large numbers for martingale differences , which we now recall :    [ thm : llnmd ] let @xmath93 be an increasing sequence of @xmath40-algebras on a space @xmath94 , and let @xmath95 be the smallest @xmath40-algebra containing all @xmath93 .",
    "let @xmath12 be a measure on @xmath96 .",
    "further , suppose that @xmath97 is a uniformly @xmath98-bounded sequence of martingale differences , i.e. @xmath99 is @xmath93-measurable , @xmath100 is uniformly bounded , and @xmath101 for all @xmath37 .",
    "then @xmath102    for a proof , see e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 3 in chapter vii.9 ) .",
    "this is indeed a generalization of the law of large numbers : if @xmath103 is a sequence of @xmath98-bounded i.i.d .",
    "random variables with zero mean , then letting @xmath93 be the @xmath40-algebra generated by @xmath104 , one clearly has @xmath105 by independence . generally speaking ,",
    "sequences of martingale differences enjoy many of the properties of independent sequences .",
    "note also that if @xmath97 is a sequence of martingale differences , then @xmath106 is a martingale , and conversely if @xmath107 is a martingale , then @xmath108 is a martingale difference sequence ; this explains the terminology .",
    "we observe also that if @xmath109 is any sequence where all the @xmath110 are @xmath93-measurable , then @xmath111 is a sequence of martingale differences .",
    "let @xmath112 recall that @xmath113 is the @xmath40-algebra generated by @xmath36 .",
    "we fix some @xmath114 , and consider the sequence @xmath115 relative to the filtration @xmath116 .",
    "we have @xmath117 note that @xmath118 where the supremum is taken over all probability vectors @xmath119 .",
    "since conditional expectations do not increase @xmath98 norms , we see that @xmath120 is a sequence of uniformly @xmath98-bounded martingale differences . by theorem [ thm :",
    "llnmd ] , @xmath121 since @xmath122 we obtain that @xmath123 adding over @xmath124 from @xmath5 to @xmath125 and rescaling the summation range concludes the proof of the first part of the theorem .",
    "the latter statements are then immediate from proposition [ prop : dim - from - dyadic - dim ] .",
    "we now turn our attention to a variety of notions of porosity , and their basic properties .",
    "we start with the simplest concept , which is the porosity of a set .",
    "let @xmath31 be any set .",
    "given a point @xmath126 and a radius @xmath127 , we define @xmath128 we think of @xmath3 as a reference ball , and @xmath129 as the relative size of the largest hole of @xmath4 in this reference ball .",
    "the porosity of @xmath4 at @xmath1 is then defined as @xmath130 thus , if @xmath131 , then @xmath4 contains holes around @xmath1 at _ all _ sufficiently small scales . finally , the porosity of @xmath4 is the size of the largest hole one sees at all points : @xmath132 if @xmath133 , we will simply say that @xmath4 is porous .",
    "we make some remarks on this definition .    1 .   clearly , @xmath134 .",
    "both extreme values can be attained : @xmath135 has porosity @xmath5 , and @xmath136 has porosity @xmath137 .",
    "2 .   a hyperplane in @xmath138 has maximal porosity @xmath137 .",
    "this illustrates two trivial but important characteristics of porosity : first , rather large sets may still have maximal porosity .",
    "porosity itself does not allow us to distinguish between a hyperplane and a point . in section [ subsec :",
    "k - porosity ] we will outline the finer concept of @xmath20-porosity , which remedies this issue . secondly , porosity ( unlike dimension ) depends on the ambient space , it is not an intrinsic property of the metric structure of a set .",
    "3 .   one could define an alternative notion by taking the @xmath14 in , i.e. requiring holes only at arbitrarily small scales .",
    "both notions of porosity are useful and well - studied .",
    "the definition we have followed is sometimes called _ lower porosity _ , and the one with the @xmath14 , _",
    "upper porosity_. there are sets of large upper porosity that nevertheless have full dimension ( it is easy to construct such examples via the dyadic subdivision process ) . since in this article our main focus is on nontrivial relations between the ideas of porosity and dimension , we will exclusively focus on ( lower ) porosity without further comment .    what are some examples of porous sets ?",
    "heuristically , any set of zero measure which satisfies some form of self - similarity ( i.e. the set is made up of smaller pieces which are similar to the whole , perhaps in a statistical sense or after some distortion ) is likely to be porous . indeed , since the set has zero measure , it has macroscopic holes around some points .",
    "the self - similar structure then propagates those holes to all points and scales .",
    "we review some basic facts on iterated function systems ( ifs s ) . given strictly contractive maps @xmath139 on @xmath138 ( an ifs ) , there exists a unique nonempty compact set @xmath4 , called the _",
    "attractor _ or _ invariant set _ , such that @xmath140 when the maps @xmath141 are similarities , @xmath4 is called a _ self - similar set_. when they are conformal , @xmath4 is called _ self - conformal_. it is possible to extend the notion of attractor to ifs s with a countable family of contractions , see e.g. @xcite for an introduction .",
    "suppose that the pieces @xmath142 are mutually disjoint ( this is know as the _ strong separation condition _ ) . if the @xmath141 are similarities , or conformal under some mild additional assumptions , it is not hard to make the above argument precise to show that @xmath4 is indeed porous , with a bound on the porosity that depends on the derivatives of the @xmath141 and the distances between the @xmath142 .",
    "we remark that the nonoverlapping of the @xmath142 is crucial here ; there are self - similar sets of zero measure which are _ not _ porous .",
    "the porosity of self - similar sets was investigated in @xcite , where it was shown that porosity allows to distinguish between self - similar sets of the same dimension . moving away from strict self - similarity",
    ", the situation may become more complicated . in @xcite ,",
    "the porosity of attractors of _ conformal infinite _ iterated function systems was thoroughly studied .",
    "several conditions for porosity , and non - porosity , were given , and applied to a range of examples , including sets defined in terms of their continued fraction expansion .",
    "another class of porous sets are smooth curves in @xmath143 , and more generally a smooth @xmath20-surface in @xmath138 ( @xmath144 ) . while this is trivial , we remark that smoothness is crucial : there exist continuous curves of positive lebesgue measure , which are therefore not porous .",
    "we will see in section [ subsec : meanporosity ] that a weaker condition , mean porosity , is satisfied by the boundaries of domains satisfying certain geometric assumptions which are much weaker than smoothness .",
    "as remarked earlier , our main focus will be on measures rather than sets .",
    "the concept of porosity of measures was introduced by eckmann , jrvenp and jrvenp in @xcite .    in order to adapt the definition of porosity to measures ,",
    "the key issue is how to define an appropriate notion of `` measure - theoretic hole '' .",
    "a first attempt might be to consider balls of zero measure inside a reference ball .",
    "however , it is quite easy to see that , if we proceeded in this way , we would end up with the porosity of the support of the measure . in order to get a notion of porosity that is genuinely measure - theoretical ,",
    "the trick is to introduce a new parameter @xmath145 . roughly speaking , an `` @xmath146-hole '' inside a reference ball",
    "@xmath3 will be a smaller ball @xmath147 with relative mass at most @xmath146 . more precisely , if @xmath12 is a measure on @xmath148 , we let @xmath149 as before , the porosity at a point is then obtained by taking @xmath15 .",
    "@xmath150 to obtain the porosity of @xmath12 , we need to make two natural modifications with respect to porosity of sets .",
    "first , we take essential infimum rather than infimum : @xmath151 finally , we need to let @xmath152 : @xmath153    before proceeding further , we make some observations .    1 .",
    "it is important to take limits in this order ; otherwise we would end up again with the porosity of the support of @xmath12 .",
    "also note that the limit as @xmath152 does exist as @xmath154 is nondecreasing in @xmath146 .",
    "2 .   again",
    ", we have @xmath155 .",
    "the left inequality is trivial , but the upper bound is now slightly more involved ; see @xcite for the proof .",
    "if @xmath156 then @xmath12 is singular ; this is an immediate consequence of the lebesgue density theorem .",
    "4 .   one trivially has @xmath157 , since any ball disjoint from @xmath158 in particular is an @xmath146-hole for all @xmath145 .",
    "strict inequality is however possible .",
    "in fact , there are porous globally supported measures .",
    "for simplicity we give the construction in @xmath159 ; the adaptation to higher dimensions is immediate .",
    "we define the measure @xmath12 on @xmath63 $ ] by specifying the collection of conditional measures @xmath58 as in section [ sec : dyadic - filtration ] . for any @xmath43 , we let @xmath58 take the value @xmath160 on the left dyadic subinterval of @xmath46 , and @xmath161 on the right - dyadic subinterval .",
    "it is clear that @xmath12 is globally supported , and it is not hard to see directly from the definition that @xmath162 .",
    "the first generalization of the idea of porosity involves requiring holes not at _ all _ scales , but only at a _ positive proportion _ of scales , resulting in the notion of _ mean porosity _ .",
    "this concept was introduced by p. koskela and s. rohde in @xcite , and turns out to be a very natural one .",
    "indeed , examples of sets which are mean porous ( but not necessarily porous ) abound . before giving examples , we state the formal definition ( we note that this deviates slightly from the original definition given by koskela and rohde ; the basic principle is the same but the quantitative emphasis is different ) .",

    "the reason why koskela and rohde were interested in mean porosity was to prove sharp dimension bounds for classes of sets arising in analysis .",

    "quasiconformal maps may be far from smooth so this is a deep generalization of the fact that smooth surfaces are porous .",
    "3 .   an important open problem in complex dynamics is to characterize the rational maps of the riemann sphere which have julia sets of full dimension . in @xcite and @xcite",

    "we illustrate this with a very general recent result of kenmki et al @xcite .",

    "it is in fact possible to use results on conical densities to prove upper bounds for the dimension of porous sets and measures in the large porosity situation .",

    "we observed earlier that porosity does not allow to distinguish between points and sets as large as a hyperplane .",
    "since one of the goals of the definition of porosity is to give a means to distinguish between the size sets of zero measure , it is desirable to have a concept of porosity type that is able to differentiate , at least , between subspaces of different dimensions .",

    "the idea of @xmath20 porosity is somewhat artificial in the small porosity context ; in fact , one can not give any better dimension bounds than .",
    "in the large porosity case , kenmki and suomala in @xcite proved and applied conical density results to conclude that there is a function @xmath311 with @xmath312 as @xmath201 , such that @xmath313 a @xmath20-plane shows that the limit @xmath314 as @xmath201 is optimal .",

    "the concept of mean @xmath20-porosity has not been investigated .",
    "it appears that a combination of the ideas of @xcite with the method of local entropy averages may yield dimension bounds in that context .",

    "more precisely , let @xmath318 , and let @xmath319 for some @xmath144 .",
    "we define the @xmath320-directed porosity in the usual steps as follows : @xmath321    we note that directed porosity is a stronger notion than porosity ( in other words , @xmath322 ) , and it becomes stronger as @xmath20 becomes smaller . in terms of dimension ,",
    "directed porosity behaves the same as porosity ; one can not get any better bounds since the known examples illustrating the sharpness of the estimates can be taken to be @xmath320-directed porous for any @xmath323 .",
