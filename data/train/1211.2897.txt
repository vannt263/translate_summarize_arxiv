    "in the past decade , there has been a significant growth in the usage of wireless networks , and in particular , cellular networks , because of the increased data demands .",
    "this has been the driver of recent research for new ways of managing interference in wireless networks .    due to the superposition and broadcast properties of the wireless medium ,",
    "interfering signals pose a significant limitation to the rate of communication of users in a wireless network .",
    "hence , it is of interest to understand the fundamental limits of communication in interference channels and to capture the effect of interference on optimal encoding and decoding schemes .",
    "the problem of finding the capacity region of even the simple @xmath11user gaussian interference channel is still an open problem .",
    "however , approximations exist in the literature , where the capacity region or the sum capacity is known in the special scenarios of strong and low interference ( @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite ) .",
    "another effective approximation that simplifies the problem is to consider only the sum degrees of freedom ( dof ) or the pre - log factor of the sum capacity at high signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) .",
    "the dof criterion provides an analytically tractable way to characterize the sum capacity and captures the number of interference - free sessions that can be supported in a given multi - user channel .    in  @xcite",
    ", the dof per user of the fully connected gaussian interference channel was shown to be upper bounded by @xmath12 .",
    "this was shown to be achievable through the interference alignment ( ia ) scheme in  @xcite . however , this achievable dof many not be sufficient to meet the demands of wireless applications in many scenarios of practical interest , and hence , it is of interest to study ways to enhance the infrastructure of wireless networks in order to increase the rate of communication .",
    "the considered infrastructural enhancement in this work is the deployment of a backhaul link , through which the transmitters / base stations can exchange messages that they wish to deliver in a cellular downlink session . in order to model the finite capacity of the backhaul link ,",
    "we impose a cooperation constraint where each message can be available at a maximum of @xmath1 transmitters .",
    "we call @xmath1 the _ cooperation order_. the availability of each message at more than one transmitter allows for coordinated multi - point ( comp ) transmission  @xcite . in  @xcite , a comp transmission model for the fully connected @xmath0-user interference channel was considered .",
    "each message was assumed to be available at the transmitter carrying the same index as the message as well as @xmath13 succeeding transmitters .",
    "using an extension of the asymptotic interference alignment scheme of  @xcite , the dof of the channel in this setting was shown to be lower bounded by @xmath14 , and it was conjectured that this lower bound is valid for all values of @xmath0 .",
    "it was then shown that this lower bound is within one degree of freedom of the maximum achievable dof .",
    "we note that this dof cooperation gain beyond @xmath15 does not scale linearly with @xmath0 as @xmath0 goes to infinity .",
    "in other words , the asymptotic per user dof remains @xmath12 . in section  [ sec : fc ] , we study whether there exists an assignment of messages satisfying the cooperation order constraint that enables the achievability of an asymptotic per user dof that is strictly greater than @xmath12 .",
    "the assumption of full connectivity is key to the results obtained in  @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite , and in section  [ sec : fc ] of this work . for the fully connected interference channel , interference mitigating schemes",
    "are designed to avoid the interference caused by all other transmitters in the network . however , in practice , each receiver gets most of the destructive interference from a few dominant interfering transmitters . for example , in cellular networks , the number of dominant interfering transmit signals at each receiver ranges from two to seven . all the interference from the remaining transmitters may contribute to the interference floor , and the improvement obtained by including them in the dominant interferers set may not justify the corresponding overhead .",
    "for this reason , we study locally connected channels in section  [ sec : lc ] , where the channel coefficients between transmitters and receivers that lie at a distance that is greater than some threshold are approximated to equal zero .    for the locally connected channel model",
    ", we assume that each transmitter is connected to @xmath6 neighboring receivers as well as the receiver carrying its own index , @xmath16 preceding receivers and @xmath17 succeeding receivers . the special case of this model where @xmath9 is wyner s asymmetric model  @xcite .",
    "this special case was considered in  @xcite , and it was assumed that each message is available at the transmitter carrying the same index as well as @xmath13 succeeding transmitters .",
    "the asymptotic per user dof was characterized under this setting as @xmath18 .",
    "the achieving scheme relies only on zero - forcing transmit beamforming . in section",
    "[ sec : lc ] , we extend this result and characterize the asymptotic per user dof for wyner s asymmetric model as @xmath8 under a general cooperation order constraint .",
    "the message assignment enabling this result uses only local cooperation , that is , each message is available only at neighboring transmitters .",
    "the size of the neighborhood does not scale linearly with the size of the network , and therefore , our assignment scheme enjoys the same advantage as the message assignment considered in  @xcite .",
    "the remainder of this work is organized as follows .",
    "related work is summarized in section  [ sec : relatedwork ] . the problem setup",
    "is then introduced in section  [ sec : problemsetup ] .",
    "an informal summary of results is provided in section  [ sec : informalsummary ] .",
    "the asymptotic per user dof of the fully connected interference channel with comp transmission is studied in section  [ sec : fc ] .",
    "the locally connected channel model is considered in section  [ sec : lc ] .",
    "the introduced results are then discussed in section  [ sec : discussion ] , and the paper is concluded with some final remarks in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "many existing works studying interference networks with cooperating transmitters use the term _ cognitive radios _",
    "( e.g.  @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite ) .",
    "cooperation through cumulative message sharing is studied for the fully connected channel in  @xcite , where each message is available at the transmitter carrying the same index and all following transmitters .",
    "we use a similar setting of cooperation to that of cumulative message sharing in the coding scheme for locally connected channels in section  [ sec : dofgains ] . in another body of work , unlike the considered setting where we assume that transmitters cooperate by sharing complete messages , cooperation through sharing partial message information that is considered as side information is studied ( see e.g. ,  @xcite ) . in  @xcite and  @xcite ,",
    "the transmitters are allowed to cooperate through noise free bit pipes or over the air , respectively .",
    "communication scenarios with cooperating multiple antenna transmitters have been considered in  @xcite and  @xcite under the umbrella of the x - channel . however , in the x - channel , mutually exclusive parts of each message are given to different transmitters .",
    "this is extended in  @xcite to allow each part of each message to be available at more than one transmitter , and in  @xcite the mimo x - channel is studied in the setting where transmitters share further side information .",
    "finally , it is worth noting that in the considered setting , we implicitly assume the coordinated design of the transmit beams between all transmitters .",
    "this kind of coordination is also referred to in the literature as _ transmitter cooperation _ , even without the sharing of messages ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "we use the standard model for the @xmath19user interference channel with single - antenna transmitters and receivers , @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the time index , @xmath22 is the transmitted signal of transmitter @xmath23 , @xmath24 is the received signal at receiver @xmath10 , @xmath25 is the zero mean unit variance gaussian noise at receiver @xmath10 , and @xmath26 is the channel coefficient from transmitter @xmath23 to receiver @xmath10 over the time slot @xmath21 . we remove the time index in the rest of the paper for brevity unless it is needed .",

    "on one hand , the achievable scheme is enabled by the choice of the message assignment strategy , and on the other hand , the assignment of messages to transmitters is governed by the technique followed in the design of transmit beams , e.g. zero - forcing transmit beamforming or interference alignment . in the following ,",
    "we discuss each of the design parameters .",
    "the assignment of each message to more than one transmitter ( comp transmission ) creates a virtual multiple input single output ( miso ) network .",
    "a real miso network , where multiple dedicated antennas are assigned to the transmission of each message , differs from the created virtual one in two aspects .",
    "first , in a comp transmission setting , the same transmit antenna can carry more than one message .",
    "second , for locally connected channels , the number of receivers at which a message causes undesired interference depends on the number of transmit antennas carrying the message .    for fully connected channels , the number of receivers at which a message causes undesired interference is the same regardless of the size of the transmit set as long as it is non - empty .",
    "the only aspect that governs the assignment of messages to transmitters is the pattern of overlap between transmit sets corresponding to different messages .",
    "it is expected that the larger the sizes of the intersections between sets of messages carried by different transmit antennas , the more dependent the coefficients of the virtual miso channel are , and hence , the lower the available dof . for the spiral assignments of messages considered in  @xcite , @xmath395 , and the same value holds for the size of the intersection between sets of messages carried by successive transmitters . in general ,",
    "local cooperation implies large intersections between sets of messages carried by different transmitters , and hence , the negative conclusion we reached for @xmath396 .    for the case where we are restricted to zero - forcing transmit beamforming as in section  [ sec : dofgains ] , the number of receivers at which each message causes undesired interference governs the choice of transmit sets , and hence , we saw that for locally connected channels , the message assignment strategy illustrated in theorem  [ thm : lowerbound ] selects transmit sets that consist of successive transmitters , to minimize the number of receivers at which each message should be cancelled .",
    "this strategy is optimal under the restriction to zero - forcing transmit beamforming schemes .",
    "while it was shown in  @xcite that comp transmission accompanied by both zero - forcing transmit beams and asymptotic interference alignment can achieve a dof cooperation gain beyond what can be achieved using only transmit zero - forcing , this is not obvious for locally connected channels . unlike in the fully connected channel , the addition of a transmitter to a transmit set in a locally connected channel may result in an increase in the number of receivers at which the message causes undesired interference .",
    "we note that unlike asymptotic interference alignment scheme , the zero - forcing transmit beamforming scheme illustrated in section  [ sec : dofgains ] does not need symbol extensions , since it achieves the stated dof of theorem  [ thm : lowerbound ] in one channel realization .",
    "however , it is not clear whether asymptotic interference alignment can be used to show an asymptotic per user dof cooperation gain beyond that achieved through simple zero - forcing transmit beamforming ; we believe that the answer to this question is closely related to both problems that remain open after this work , i.e. , characterizing @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "we studied the dof gain achieved through comp transmission . in particular",
    ", it was of interest to know whether the achievable gain scales linearly with @xmath0 as it goes to infinity , under a cooperation constraint that only limits the number of transmitters at which any message can be available by a cooperation order @xmath1 .",
    "we showed that the answer is negative for the fully connected channel where message assignment strategies satisfy the local cooperation constraint , as well as all possible message assignments for the case where @xmath99 .",
    "the problem is still open for fully connected channels and values of @xmath104 .    for locally connected channels where each transmitter is connected to the receiver carrying the same index as well as @xmath6 neighboring receivers , we showed that the asymptotic per user dof is lower bounded by @xmath7 .",
    "the achieving coding scheme is simple as it relies only on zero - forcing transmit beamforming .",
    "we showed that this lower bound is tight for the case where @xmath9 .",
    "in particular , the characterized asymptotic per user dof for that case is @xmath8 , and is higher than previous results in  @xcite , and  @xcite .",
    "we also revealed insights on the optimal way of assigning messages to transmitters under a cooperation order constraint .",
    "for instance , we considered a local cooperation constraint , where each message can only be available at a neighborhood of transmitters whose size does not scale linearly with the number of users .",
    "while we showed that local cooperation does not achieve a scalable dof gain for the fully connected channel , we also showed that local cooperation is optimal for locally connected channels .",
    "furthermore , we have shed light on the intimate relation between the selection of message assignments and the design of transmit beams .",
    "we have shown that assigning messages to successive transmitters is beneficial for zero - forcing transmit beamforming in locally connected channels as it minimizes the number of receivers at which each message causes undesired interference .",
    "however , the same message assignment strategy can be an impediment to other techniques such as asymptotic interference alignment , because the overlap of sets of messages carried by transmit antennas is large for this assignment of messages .",
