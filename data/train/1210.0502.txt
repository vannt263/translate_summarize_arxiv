    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) launched on 14 december 2009 and operated until placed into hibernation on 17 february 2011 .",
    "wise surveyed the entire sky near 90@xmath3 solar elongation in four infrared wavelengths : 3.4 , 4.6 , 12 and 22 @xmath2 m ( denoted @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 respectively ) .",
    "this scan pattern resulted in an average of 12 exposures on the ecliptic , rising to hundreds of exposures at the ecliptic poles with 6.5 arcsecond spatial resolution at 12 @xmath2 m .",
    "cooling for all four detectors was provided by dual solid hydrogen tanks .",
    "survey operations began on 7 january , 2010 , and the first pass on the entire sky was completed six months later .",
    "coverage of the solar system was incomplete at that time owing to the long synodic periods of near - earth objects ( neos ) and many main belt asteroids ( mbas ) .",
    "the outer hydrogen tank was exhausted on 5 august , 2010 , resulting in the loss of the 22 @xmath2 m channel that day .",
    "as the remaining hydrogen ice in the inner tank sublimated , both the detectors and the telescope temperature rose . during this period ,",
    "the 12 @xmath2 m channel continued to operate ( albeit with reduced sensitivity ) until 29 september , 2010 .",
    "the inner tank s hydrogen supply was then finally exhausted , and the telescope temperature rose , resulting in the loss of this channel .    before launch ,",
    "the wise baseline data processing pipeline was enhanced with the wise moving object pipeline system ( wmops ) to enable the independent discovery of new minor planets in near real - time and archive individual exposures .",
    "these augmentations to the wise pipeline , collectively known as ",
    "neowise , \" resulted in the discovery of @xmath134,000 new asteroids , including 135 new neos .",
    "the survey has reported observations of @xmath0158,000 minor planets @xcite .",
    "beginning 1 october , 2010 , nasa s planetary science directorate funded a four month extension , known as the neowise post - cryogenic survey , to search for new asteroids using wmops and to fill in the gap in coverage of the inner main asteroid belt ( see figure 1 of * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the focal plane assemblies , optics and telescope temperature warmed to 73.5 k , cold enough to permit observations in the two shortest wavelengths . as discussed in @xcite , the @xmath4 and @xmath5 arrays operated with minimal performance degradation .",
    "data collection was halted on 1 february , 2011 .    to date",
    ", the neowise post - cryogenic survey data have been processed using a first - pass version of the reduction pipeline .",
    "the image data were calibrated using early versions of dark and flat field images and bad pixel masks that were largely derived from the fully cryogenic ( fc ) mission phase .",
    "the current processing version does not benefit from the improvements implemented in the second - pass processing that have been applied to the wise all - sky and 3-band cryogenic data release products .",
    "furthermore , the precise calibrations needed to compensate optimally for the effects of the increasing temperature were not applied to the post - cryogenic survey data .",
    "for example , the @xmath4 and @xmath5 system throughput is known to have changed with time as the focal plane arrays and telescope warmed .",
    "comparison of photometry of inertial calibration sources ( primarily stars ) between the four band data and the post - cryogenic survey data indicates that objects may appear up to 2% brighter in @xmath4 and up to 11% brighter in @xmath5 during different times throughout the post - cryogenic survey @xcite .    the neowise post - cryogenic survey preliminary data were delivered to nasa s public infrared science archive on 31 july , 2012 .",
    "these preliminary release data do not have the same degree of quality assurance as the final release products delivered for the fully cryogenic wise all - sky data release .",
    "consequently , users are strongly advised to consult the cautionary notes in section viii.1.d of the post - cryo preliminary data release explanatory supplement .",
    "the neowise project is now reprocessing the post - cryogenic survey data with a second - pass version of the pipeline , using the much improved calibrations optimized for the warm telescope .    here , we characterize the performance of the preliminary version of the post - cryogenic survey data with regard to small bodies . to date , @xmath16500 objects were detected during the neowise post - cryogenic survey , including 88 neos .",
    "neowise discovered @xmath11000 new asteroids during the post - cryogenic survey , including 12 new neos .",
    "we present preliminary thermal model results for neos detected during the 3-band cryogenic and post - cryogenic survey phases .",
    "neowise discovered two unusual neos during the post - cryogenic survey : 2010 tk@xmath8 , the first known earth trojan @xcite , and 2010 so@xmath9 , an neo in a so - called  horseshoe \" orbit @xcite .",
    "the fits for these and other objects are given .",
    "we consider the accuracy of thermal model fits for small body measurements using the neowise post - cryogenic survey data in two ways .",
    "first , we compare fit results from data collected during the fc mission for a number of objects with well - known diameters to fits performed using only the @xmath4 and @xmath5 bands from the same fc dataset ( i.e. drop bands @xmath6 and @xmath7 ) .",
    "next , we compare fits performed using the fc data for @xmath1430 neos to fits for the same objects using only their @xmath4 and @xmath5 data ( again dropping @xmath10 ) .    at 3.4 and 4.6 @xmath2 m ,",
    "asteroid fluxes are a mix of reflected sunlight and thermal emission . while flux at 12 @xmath2 m is dominated by thermal emission for most neos and mbas , which is only a weak function of visible albedo ( ) , the fluxes at shorter wavelengths are strong functions of .",
    "we make the simplifying assumption that @xmath11 . in @xcite",
    ", we showed that infrared albedos are correlated with taxonomic classification .",
    "asteroids that are red - sloped ( such as t and d types ) from visible to near - infrared wavelengths tend to have the higher ratios of , and asteroids with blue to flat slopes ( such as c and b types ) tend to have lower  ratios .",
    "we apply the near - earth asteroid thermal model ( neatm ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to obtain estimates of the asteroids physical parameters .",
    "this model uses a beaming parameter , @xmath12 , to account for the tendency of surface features such as craters to  beam \" radiation back to the observer at low phase angles .",
    "when two or more thermally - dominated bands are available , @xmath12 can be estimated , and this was done for more than a hundred thousand asteroids observed by wise during the fc survey phase @xcite .",
    "these works implemented the neatm code in such as way as to determine the free parameters @xmath13 , , , and @xmath12 by using a least - squares minimization to the four wavelengths and their errors , along with absolute visible magnitude @xmath14 and its assumed error ( taken to be @xmath150.3 mag in most cases ) , and slope parameter @xmath16 and its error ( @xmath150.1 mag ) .",
    "however , for objects detected only during the post - cryogenic survey , it is not usually possible to fit for @xmath12 for most inner solar system objects , because only the @xmath5 band is thermally dominated . for asteroids at sufficiently large heliocentric distances , even @xmath5 is primarily dominated by reflected sunlight .",
    "hence , for most inner main belt asteroids and neos observed in only the post - cryogenic survey , we must assume a value for @xmath12 , along with an estimate of its variance .",
    "for neos , we adopted @xmath17 , following @xcite , while for mbas , we set @xmath18 based upon the average values shown in @xcite . following @xcite , errors in derived physical parameters such as diameter and  were computed using monte carlo trials which varied the wise magnitudes , absolute visible magnitude @xmath14 according to their 1-@xmath19 errors , along with any other assumed parameters such as @xmath12 or  where necessary .    when measurements in all four wise wavelengths and an absolute visible magnitude @xmath14 are available , it is possible to fit for  directly rather than compute it from  using an assumed value for the ratio .",
    "however , when there are insufficient measurements dominated by reflected sunlight available , it is no longer possible to fit . in that case , an assumed value for  must be used .",
    "we used = 1.6@xmath151.0 for neos based @xcite , and = 1.3@xmath150.5 for mbas based on @xcite .    for objects detected by wise at 12 and 22 @xmath2 m , we have shown in @xcite that effective spherical diameters can generally be determined to within @xmath1510% , and albedos to within @xmath1525% of their values .",
    "we assembled a collection of 112 asteroids from the literature with reliable diameters that were measured with non - radiometric methods ( radar observations , stellar occultations , or spacecraft visits ) .",
    "here , we calculate thermal fits for these calibration objects using only bands @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "figure [ fig : w1w2_v_radar1 ] shows the results of neatm fits for the 112 calibrator objects from data from the fc survey phase , but using only @xmath20 measurements .",
    "gaussian fits to the resulting histogram of differences between @xmath20-only fits and the diameters taken from non - radiometric literature sources produces a 1-@xmath19 diameter spread of @xmath120% , and a 1-@xmath19 spread in albedos of @xmath140% of the objects albedos .",
    "the accuracy of the diameters and albedos derived using @xmath20 only is degraded by about a factor of two relative to fits derived using @xmath10 .",
    "figure [ fig : w1w2_v_radar1 ] shows that fits for  for objects with lower  tend to be somewhat lower than those derived from radar , etc .",
    "similarly , fits for  for higher albedo objects may be somewhat systematically too high . as noted in @xcite ,",
    "s - complex asteroids tend to have redder visible - to - near - infrared slopes , so therefore they tend to have higher values of . as most of the objects shown in figure [ fig : w1w2_v_radar1 ] are mbas , the assumed value used for  of 1.3@xmath150.5 is probably too low ; @xcite found a median value of @xmath11.6 for s - complex asteroids .",
    "moreover , @xcite found a median  of @xmath11.0 for c - complex asteroids , as might be expected from their blue to flat visible - to - near - infrared slopes .",
    "the ratio  seems to indicate that on average , for many objects , the trend of the visible to near - infrared slope continues out to 3 - 4 @xmath2 m .",
    "there are exceptions to these general trends ; t- and d - type objects , which have lower , have red to extremely red slopes and median  of 1.5 and 2.0 , respectively . the one - size - fits - all assumption of = 1.3@xmath150.5 for mbas and",
    "1.6@xmath151.0 for neos when performing thermal fits using @xmath20 only is perhaps overly simplistic . nevertheless , given that taxonomic classification is not usually available for most objects , it is probably not safe to assume different values for .",
    "the errors are more properly accounted for by using an appropriately large error on the assumed value of .",
    "we next compared thermal fit results derived for 429 neos observed during the fc survey phase with fits derived using their @xmath20 detections only ( i.e. dropping 12 and 22 @xmath2 m ) .",
    "of the 429 neos detected in the fc survey phase , 218 were detected in bands @xmath20 in addition to @xmath10 . by comparing the fc fits to fits for the same objects using only their @xmath20 fluxes , we can assess the difference in diameters and albedos ( figure [ fig : w1w2_v_cryoneos1 ] ) .",
    "the @xmath20-only fits replicate the four band fits to within @xmath1520% in diameter and @xmath1540% in albedo .",
    "while the mean offset between the @xmath20-only diameters and the four band diameters is zero , there is a skew in the histogram of differences between @xmath20-only albedos and four band albedos . as noted with the calibration objects shown in figure [ fig : w1w2_v_radar1 ] , when performing thermal fits using = 1.6@xmath151.0 ( the median value derived from the fc survey phase for neos ) , neos with @xmath210.1 tend to have somewhat larger albedos than their corresponding four band values .",
    "given that in @xcite it was shown that  is most likely related to an object s visible / near - infrared slope , which is not known in most cases , we must use the median value of = 1.6@xmath151.0 .",
    "nevertheless , figures [ fig : w1w2_v_radar1 ] and [ fig : w1w2_v_cryoneos1 ] show that the neowise post - cryogenic survey data produce reasonable estimates of an asteroid s effective spherical diameter and albedo .",
    "table 1 gives the physical properties of 32 neos detected during both the 3-band cryogenic phase of the wise mission and the 88 neos detected during the neowise post - cryogenic survey .",
    "the median diameter of objects detected in the post - cryogenic survey phase was 0.87 km , vs. 0.76 km during the fc mission .",
    "table 1 includes a number of unusual objects .",
    "several objects that are currently co - orbital with respect to the earth were detected , including ( 3753 ) cruithne .",
    "cruithne s orbit , when viewed from a reference frame corotating with earth , follows a horseshoe - shaped pattern @xcite .",
    "neatm yields an effective spherical diameter of 2.1@xmath150.21 km .",
    "its high albedo ( @xmath22 ) and moderately high infrared albedo ratio ( = 1.13@xmath150.35 ) are consistent with its spectral classification of q @xcite .",
    "it exhibits a large - amplitude lightcurve that appears consistent with the 27.4 hour rotational period derived by @xcite .",
    "neowise discovered another object that was determined to be in a horseshoe orbit with respect to the earth by @xcite , 2010 so@xmath9 , during the post - cryogenic survey .",
    "it was detected in band @xmath5 , and a neatm fit assuming the standard values of @xmath17 and = 1.6@xmath151.0 determined from @xcite yields an effective spherical diameter of 0.35@xmath150.14 km with a visible albedo @xmath23 .",
    "the first known earth trojan asteroid , 2010 tk@xmath8 , was discovered by neowise during the post - cryogenic survey .",
    "@xcite analyzed its orbit and determined it to be bound to the earth s l4 lagrange point .",
    "a neatm fit to the post - cryogenic survey data shows the object to be 0.38@xmath150.12 km in diameter with @xmath24 .",
    "2010 tk@xmath8 passed through the wise field of view for @xmath180 exposures during the fully cryogenic portion of the mission , but it was not detected even in a comoving coadded image of all of these frames . a prediction of its magnitude using the physical properties determined from the post - cryogenic survey indicates that it would have fallen well below the detection threshold even with @xmath180 exposures .",
    "a quasi - satellite was also detected during the fully cryogenic portion of the mission in bands @xmath5 and @xmath6 , ( 164207 ) 2004 gu@xmath25 .",
    "it will likely trail the earth for the next @xmath11000 years , after which point it will most likely enter a horseshoe orbit @xcite .",
    "it is small ( @xmath26 km ) and bright ( = @xmath27 ) .",
    "neowise also detected a known mars trojan , ( 121514 ) 1999 uj@xmath8 .",
    "the object was observed in two epochs , first during the fully cryogenic portion of the mission in bands @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 in march , 2010 , then again in october , 2010 in bands @xmath4 and @xmath5 only .",
    "a neatm fit reveals its diameter to be large , about 2.5@xmath150.2 km , with a low visible albedo ( @xmath28=0.048@xmath150.012 ) , consistent with its x or t classification @xcite .",
    "its low albedo is significantly different from those of other mars trojans with measured albedos such as ( 5261 ) eureka and ( 101429 ) 1998 vf@xmath29 ( @xmath28=0.39 and 0.32 respectively ; * ? ? ?",
    "the difference in albedo and spectral classification may indicate a different origin from the other mars trojans .",
    "most of the asteroids detected by wmops during the fully cryogenic phase of the wise mission were identified using band @xmath6 , centered at 12 @xmath2 m . at this wavelength ,",
    "the dominant source of flux for neos is thermal emission rather than reflected sunlight . as thermal flux",
    "is only weakly dependent on @xmath28 , band @xmath6 is essentially equally sensitive to high and low albedo objects .",
    "however , neos detected by wmops in band @xmath5 during the post - cryogenic survey were not selected in such an albedo - insensitive manner , given that flux in band @xmath5 is usually a mix of reflected sunlight and thermal emission for most neos .",
    "darker , smaller neos are therefore somewhat less likely to have been detected .",
    "figure [ fig : albedo ] shows the relationship between @xmath28 and diameter for neos observed during the fully cryogenic mission phase as well as during the post - cryogenic survey . as expected , somewhat fewer small , low albedo neos were detected by wmops during the fully cryogenic survey phase .    in order to extrapolate the sample of co - orbital near - earth asteroids detected by neowise to the larger population as was done for the fully cryogenic survey phase in @xcite and @xcite , we must develop a synthetic population of objects with suitable orbital elements and physical properties .",
    "this synthetic population will be combined with a model of the survey s sensitivity as a function of sky position and wavelength to produce estimates of the survey s biases with respect to orbital elements as well as diameter and albedo .",
    "this analysis will be the subject of future work .",
    "the neowise post - cryogenic survey has resulted in the collection of 3.4 and 4.6 @xmath2 m observations for nearly 100 neos to date .",
    "comparison with well - known calibrator objects shows that for objects with low amplitude lightcurves , good signal - to - noise measurements , and thermally - dominated fluxes in band @xmath5 , diameters can be computed to within @xmath1520% and albedos to within @xmath1540% of their values .",
    "while the accuracy of the diameters and albedos computed from bands @xmath4 and @xmath5 only is lower when compared to the fully cryogenic mission data , it is nevertheless possible to learn useful physical information about these objects .",
    "we have computed preliminary thermal models for the neos detected during the 3-band cryogenic and post - cryogenic survey phases , including a number of objects that are co - orbital with the earth and mars .",
    "future work will include extrapolation of these detections to place constraints on the populations of these objects as well as strength and effect of non - gravitational forces on their orbital evolution .",
