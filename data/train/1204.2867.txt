    "the minority game ( mg ) was originated from the el farol bar problem in game theory first conceived by arthur in 1994 @xcite , where a finite population of people try to decide , at the same time , whether to go to the bar on a particular night . since the capacity of the bar",
    "is limited , it can only accommodate a small fraction of all who are interested . if many people choose to go to the bar , it will be crowded , depriving the people of the fun and thereby defying the purpose of going to the bar . in this case , those who choose to stay home are the winners .",
    "however , if many people decide to stay at home then the bar will be empty , so those who choose to go to the bar will have fun and they are the winners . apparently ,",
    "no matter what method each person uses to make a decision , the option taken by majority of people is guaranteed to fail and the winners are those that choose the minority one .",
    "indeed , it can be proved that , for the el farol bar problem there are mixed strategies and a nash - equilibrium solution does exist , in which the option taken by minority wins @xcite .",
    "a variant of the problem was subsequently proposed by challet and zhang , named as an mg problem @xcite , where a player among an odd number of players chooses one of the two options at each time step .",
    "subsequently , the model was studied in a series of works @xcite . in physics , mg has received a great deal of attention from the statistical - mechanics community , especially in terms of problems associated with non - equilibrium phase transitions @xcite .    in the current literature",
    ", the setting of mg is that there is a _ single _ resource with players two possible options ( e.g. , in the el farol bar problem there is a single bar and the options of agents are either going to the bar or not ) , and an agent is assumed to react to available global information about the history of the system by taking on an alternative option that is different than the current one it is taking .",
    "the outstanding question remains of the nonlinear dynamics of mg with _",
    "multiple resources_. the purpose of this paper is to present a class of multi - resource mg models . in particular , we assume a complex system with multiple resources and , at any time , an individual agent has @xmath3 _ resources / strategies _ to choose from .",
    "we introduce a parameter @xmath0 , which is the probability that each agent responds based on its available local information by selecting a less crowded resource in an attempt to gain higher payoff .",
    "we call @xmath0 the _ minority - preference probability_. we find , strikingly , as @xmath0 is increased , the phenomenon of grouping emerges , where the resources can be distinctly divided into two groups according to the number of their attendees .",
    "in addition , the number of stable pairs of groups also increases .",
    "we shall show that the grouping phenomenon plays a fundamental role in shaping the fluctuations of the system .",
    "the phenomenon will be demonstrated numerically and explained by a comprehensive analytic theory .",
    "an application to the analysis of empirical data from a real financial market will also be illustrated , where grouping of stocks ( resources ) appears .",
    "our model is not only directly relevant to nonlinear and complex dynamical systems , but also applicable to social and economical systems .",
    "our multi - resource mg model is presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] .",
    "the emergence of grouping phenomenon is demonstrated in sec .",
    "[ sec : numerics ] .",
    "a general theory is developed in sec .",
    "[ sec : theory ] to elucidate the dynamics of the emergence and evolution of the strategy groups .",
    "concluding remarks are presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "we consider a complex , evolutionary - game type of dynamical system of @xmath4 interacting agents competing for multiple resources .",
    "each agent will chose one resource in each round of the game . and",
    ", each resource has a limited capacity , i.e. , the number of agents it can accommodate has an upper bound @xmath5 .",
    "there are thus multiple strategies ( @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , where @xmath9 is the maximum number of resources / strategies ) available to each agent . on average ,",
    "each strategy can accommodate @xmath10 agents , and we consider the simple case of @xmath11 .",
    "let @xmath12 be the number of agents selecting a particular strategy @xmath13 .",
    "if @xmath14 , the corresponding agents win the game and , consequently , @xmath13 is the _ minority strategy_. however , if @xmath15 , the associated resource is too crowded so that the strategy fails and the agents taking it lose the game , which defines the `` majority strategy . ''",
    "the optimal solution to the game dynamics is thus @xmath16 .    in a real - world system , it is often difficult or even impossible for each agent to gain global information about the dynamical state of the whole system .",
    "it is therefore useful to introduce the concept of _ local information network _ in our multiple - resource mg model . at each time step , with probability @xmath0 , namely the _ minority - preference probability _ , each agent acts based on local information that it gains by selecting one of the @xmath9 available strategies . in contrast , with probability @xmath1 , an agent acts without the guidance of any local information . for the minority - preference case , agent @xmath17 has @xmath18 neighbors in the networked system . the required information for @xmath17 to react consists of all its neighbors strategies and , among them , the winners of the game , i.e. , those neighboring agents choosing the minority strategies at the last time step .",
    "let @xmath19 be the set of minority strategies for @xmath17 s winning neighbors , where a strategy may appear a number of times , if it has been chosen by different winning neighbors .",
    "with probability @xmath0 , agent @xmath17 will chose one strategy randomly from @xmath20 .",
    "thus , the probability @xmath21 for strategy @xmath13 to be selected is proportional to the times it appears in @xmath20 , i.e. , @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the number of elements in @xmath20 and @xmath24 the times strategy @xmath13 appears in @xmath20 .",
    "if @xmath20 is empty , @xmath17 will randomly select one from the @xmath9 available strategies . while , for the case that an agent selects a strategy without the guidance of any local information with probability @xmath1 , it will either choose a different strategy randomly from the @xmath9 available ones with mutation probability @xmath25 @xcite , or inherit its strategy from the last time step with probability @xmath26",
    "as a concrete example to illustrate the strategy - grouping phenomenon , we set @xmath27 . figures [ fig : ts](a - c ) show time series of @xmath12 , the number of agents selecting each strategy @xmath13 , for @xmath28 , 0.45 , and 1.0 , respectively . for fig .",
    "[ fig : ts](a ) where @xmath29 , an agent makes no informed decision in that it changes strategy randomly with probability @xmath25 but stays with the original strategy with probability @xmath26 . in this case , @xmath12 s appear random .",
    "for the opposite extreme case of @xmath30 [ fig .",
    "[ fig : ts](c ) ] , each agent makes well informed decisions based on available local information about the strategies used by its neighbors . in this case , the time series are quasiperiodic ( a detailed analysis will be provided in sec .",
    "[ sec : theory ] ) . for the intermediate case of @xmath31 [ fig .",
    "[ fig : ts](b ) ] , agents decisions are partially informed . in this case ,",
    "an examination of the time series points to the occurrence of an interesting grouping behavior : the 5 strategies , in terms of their selection by the agents , are divided into two distinct groups @xmath32 and @xmath33 that contain @xmath34 and @xmath35 resources , respectively . the time series associated with the smaller group exhibit larger fluctuations about its equilibrium .    to better characterize the fluctuating behaviors in the time series @xmath12",
    ", we calculate the variance @xmath36 ^ 2\\rangle$ ] as a function of the system parameter @xmath0 , where @xmath37 is the expectation values averaged over a long time interval , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : variance ] on a logarithmic scale .",
    "we observe a generally increasing behavior in @xmath38 with @xmath0 and , strikingly , a bifurcation - like phenomenon .",
    "in particular , for @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the bifurcation point , @xmath41s for all strategies assume approximately the same value . however , for @xmath42 , there are two distinct values for @xmath41 , signifying the aforementioned grouping behavior [ fig .",
    "[ fig : ts](b ) ] . from fig .",
    "[ fig : variance ] , we also see that , after the bifurcation , the two branches of @xmath41 are linear ( on a logarithmic scale ) and have approximately the same slope @xmath43 , suggesting the following power - law relation : @xmath44 , for @xmath45 , where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the intercepts of the two lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : variance ] .",
    "we thus obtain @xmath48 in sec .",
    "[ sec : theory ] , we will develop a theory to explain the relations among the variances of the grouped strategies and to provide formulas for the amplitudes of the time series in fig . [",
    "fig : ts ] and the sizes of the groups ( denoted by @xmath49 and @xmath50 , respectively ) .",
    "specifically , our theory predicts the following ratio between the variances of the two bifurcated branches : @xmath51 which is identical to the numerically observed ratio in eq .",
    "( [ eq : main_ratio ] ) , with the additional prediction that the strategies in the group of smaller size exhibit stronger fluctuations since the corresponding value of @xmath41 is larger .",
    "overall , the emergence of the grouping behavior in multiple - resource mgs , as exemplified in fig .",
    "[ fig : variance ] , resembles a period - doubling like bifurcation .",
    "while period - doubling bifurcations are extremely common in nonlinear dynamical systems , to our knowledge , in complex game systems a clear signature of such a bifurcation had not been reported previously .",
    "a careful examination of the time - series for various @xmath0 has revealed that the strategy - grouping processes has already taken place prior to the bifurcation point @xmath40 in the variance @xmath41 , but all resulted grouping states are unstable .",
    "take as an example the @xmath52-strategy system in fig .",
    "[ fig : ts ] . in principle",
    ", there can be two types of pairing groups : @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "for any grouping state , the following constraint applies : @xmath55 there are in total @xmath56 ( if @xmath9 is even ) or @xmath57 ( if @xmath9 is odd ) possible grouping states for the system with @xmath9 available strategies .",
    "however , the grouping states are not stable for @xmath58 .",
    "what happens is that a strategy can remain in one group but only for a finite amount of time before switching to a different group .",
    "assume that the sizes of the original two pairing groups are @xmath59 and @xmath60 , respectively .",
    "the sizes of the new pair of groups are thus @xmath61 and @xmath62 , as stipulated by eq .",
    "( [ eq : constraint ] ) . associated with switching to a different pair of groups , the amplitudes of the time series @xmath12 for each strategy also change . as the bifurcation parameter @xmath0 is increased , the stabilities of different pairs of grouping states also change . at the bifurcation point @xmath40 ,",
    "one particular pair of groups becomes stable , such as the grouping state @xmath54 in fig .",
    "[ fig : variance ] .    the bifurcation - like phenomenon and the emergence of various strategy - grouping states are general for multiple - resource mg game dynamics .",
    "for example , fig .",
    "[ fig : k16 ] shows @xmath41 as a function of @xmath0 for a system with @xmath63 available strategies .",
    "there are in total 8 possible grouping states , ranging from @xmath64 to @xmath65 . as @xmath0 is increased , the grouping states @xmath64 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 become stable one after another , as can be seen from the appearance of their corresponding branches in fig .",
    "[ fig : k16 ] . the behavior can be understood theoretically through a stability analysis ( sec .",
    "[ sec : theory ] ) .",
    "another phenomenon revealed by fig .",
    "[ fig : k16 ] is the merging of bifurcated branches .",
    "for example , as @xmath0 is increased through about 0.8 , the grouping states disappear one after another in the reverse order as they initially appeared .",
    "this can also be understood through the stability analysis ( sec .",
    "[ sec : theory ] ) .",
    "here we develop an analytic theory to understand the emergence , characteristics , and evolutions of the strategy groups .      in general , for a multiple - resource mg system of @xmath4 agents , as the parameter @xmath0",
    "is increased so that agents become more likely to make informed decision for strategy selection , the available strategies can be divided into pairs of groups .",
    "the example in fig .",
    "[ fig : ts](b ) presents a case where there are two distinct strategy groups @xmath32 and @xmath33 , which contain @xmath49 and @xmath50 strategies , respectively , where @xmath70 . for fig .",
    "[ fig : ts](b ) , we have @xmath71 .",
    "the strategies belonging to the same group are selected by approximately the same number of agents , i.e. , the time series @xmath72 for strategies in the same group are nearly identical . during the time evolution , a strategy @xmath13 can switch iteratively from being a minority strategy [ @xmath73 to being a majority one [ @xmath74 .",
    "in particular , as shown in the schematic map in fig . [",
    "fig : sketchmap ] , for the strategy in group @xmath32 denoted by @xmath75 , and the strategy in group @xmath33 denoted by @xmath76 , if @xmath77 , we will have @xmath78 .",
    "in addition , the time series @xmath12 reveals that the average numbers of agents for strategies @xmath75 and @xmath76 , denoted by @xmath79 and @xmath80 ( the blue dash line and red dot line in fig .",
    "[ fig : sketchmap ] ) , respectively , are not equal to @xmath10 ( the black solid line in fig .",

[ fig : sketchmap ] .",
    "based on the numerical observations , we can argue that the strategy grouping phenomenon is intimately related to the fluctuations in the time series @xmath12 . assuming the mg system is closed so that the number of agents is a constant , we have @xmath91 thus , for two consecutive time steps , we have , @xmath92 substituting eq .",

    "we calculate the pearson parameter @xmath198 of each pair of the detrended log - returns @xmath199 and @xmath200 , which leads to a @xmath201 correlation matrix @xmath202 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : matrix](a ) . in terms of the eigenvector associated with the maximum eigenvalue of matrix @xmath202 ,",
    "we rank the order of the stocks and obtain the matrix @xmath203 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : matrix](b ) . _",
    "the striking behavior is that the matrix is apparently divided into 4 blocks , a manifestation of the grouping phenomenon . _ in particular , the matrix elements @xmath198 among the first 15 stocks and those among the remaining 12 stocks are generally positive , but the cross elements between stocks in the two groups are negative .",
    "it is thus quite natural to classify the first 15 stocks as belonging to group @xmath32 and the remaining 12 to group @xmath33 .",
    "we can then write the matrix in a block form as @xmath204 where the elements of @xmath205 and @xmath206 are positive , and those of @xmath207 and @xmath208 are negative .",
    "the phenomenon is that the @xmath2-stock system has self - organized itself into a @xmath209 grouping state , which is a natural consequence of the mg dynamics in multi - resource complex systems .    for one given stock @xmath17 ,",
    "the mean absolute correlation is @xmath210 this parameter reflects the weight of the stock in the system . if @xmath211 , oscillations of stock @xmath17 are contained in the noise floor . in this case , there is no indication as to whether this stock belongs to group @xmath32 or @xmath33 .",
    "the larger the value of @xmath212 , the less ambiguous that the stock belongs to either one of the two groups . from the value of @xmath212 ranked in the same order as in @xmath203",
    ", we can see that the boundary of the two groups is the stock with minimum @xmath212 .",
    "thus @xmath212 can be considered as the characteristic number to distinguish different groups .",
    "we can also reorder the matrix @xmath203 according to @xmath212 within group @xmath32 and @xmath33 , respectively .",
    "this leads to the matrix @xmath213 , as shown in fig .",

    "minority game , since its invention about two decades ago , has become a paradigm to study the social and economical phenomena where a large number of agents attempt to make simultaneous decision by choosing one of the available options @xcite . in the most commonly studied case of a single available resource with players two possible options ,",
    "agents taking the minority option are the guaranteed winners .",
    "various minority game dynamics have also received attention from the physics community due to their high relevance to a number of phenomena in statistical physics .",
    "it has become more and more common in the modern world that multiple resources are available for various social and economical systems .",
    "if the rule still holds that the winning options are minority ones , the questions that naturally arise are what type of collective behaviors can emerge and how they would evolve in the underlying complex system .",
    "our present work aims to address these questions computationally and analytically .",
    "the main contribution and findings of this paper are the following .",
    "firstly , we have constructed a class of spatially extended systems in which any agent interacts with a finite but fixed number of neighbors and can choose either to follow the minority strategy based on information about the neighboring states or to select one randomly from a set of available strategies .",
    "the probability to follow the local minority strategy , or the probability of minority preference , is a key parameter determining the dynamics of the underlying complex system .",
    "secondly , we have carried out extensive numerical simulations and discovered the emergence of a striking collective behavior : as the minority - preference probability is increased through a critical value , the set of available strategies / resources spontaneously break into pairs of groups , where the strategies in the same group are associated with a specific fluctuating behavior of attendance .",
    "this phenomenon of strategy - grouping is completely self - organized , which we conjecture is the hallmark of mg dynamics with multiple resources .",
    "thirdly , we have developed a mean - field theory to explain and predict the emergence and evolution of the strategy - grouping states , with good agreement with the numerics .",
    "fourthly , we have examined a real - world system of a relatively small - scale stock - trading system , and found unequivocal evidence of the grouping phenomenon .",
    "our results suggest grouping of resources as a fundamental type of collective dynamics in multiple - resource mg systems",
    ". other real - world systems for which our model is applicable include , e.g. , hedge - fund portfolios in financial systems , routing issues in computer networks and urban traffic systems .",
    "we expect our model and findings to be not only relevant with statistical - physical systems , but also important to a host of social , economical , and political systems .",
    "additionally , the double - grouping ( or paired grouping ) period - doubling like bifurcation are not the exclusive mode for the grouping of resources .",
    "we have also observed the period@xmath214 double - grouping [ see fig . [",
    "fig : mapping](a)(b ) ] , and the period@xmath214 triplet - grouping bifurcation phenomena [ see fig . [",
    "fig : mapping](c ) ] .",
    "further research about these phenomena are of great interest and is valuable for the understanding of chaotic and bifurcation in social systems .",
