    "su(2 ) einstein - yang - mills ( eym ) theory possesses regular static spherically symmetric solutions @xcite .",
    "these solutions are aymptotically flat and have non - trivial magnetic gauge field configurations , but no global charge .",
    "they have a high - density interior region , followed by a near - field region with approximately reissner - nordstrm metric and a far - field region with approximately schwarzschild metric @xcite .    to every regular solution in su(2 ) eym theory , there exists a corresponding family of black hole solutions with regular event horizon @xmath2 @xcite . outside their event horizon these black hole solutions possess non - abelian hair . like the regular solutions ,",
    "the black hole solutions are unstable @xcite .",
    "like eym theory , einstein - yang - mills - dilaton ( eymd ) possesses static , spherically symmetric non - abelian regular and black hole solutions @xcite . here",
    "the dilaton coupling constant @xmath3 represents a parameter . in the limit",
    "@xmath4 the dilaton decouples and eym theory is obtained , for @xmath5 contact with the low energy effective action of string theory is made , and in the limit @xmath6 gravity decouples and yang - mills - dilaton ( ymd ) theory is obtained .",
    "recently we have shown , that ymd theory possesses also static axially symmetric regular solutions @xcite .",
    "these solutions are labelled by the winding number @xmath7 and the node number @xmath1 of the gauge fields . for @xmath8",
    "one obtains the static spherically symmetric solutions of ymd theory @xcite .",
    "the axially symmetric solutions have a torus - like shape . choosing the @xmath9-axis as the symmetry axis",
    ", the energy density has a strong peak along the @xmath10-axis and decreases monotonically along the @xmath9-axis .",
    "the existence of the regular static axially symmetric ymd solutions strongly suggests the existence of the corresponding eymd solutions for finite values of the dilaton coupling constant . in this letter we present strong ( numerical ) evidence , that such regular gravitating axially symmetric solutions indeed exist in eymd theory and also in eym theory .",
    "we consider the su(2 ) einstein - yang - mills - dilaton action @xmath11 with @xmath12    to obtain static axially symmetric solutions we employ isotropic coordinates and adopt the metric @xmath13 with @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 being only functions of @xmath10 and @xmath9 .",
    "the corresponding ansatz for the purely magnetic gauge field ( @xmath17 ) is @xcite @xmath18 @xmath19 @xmath20 with the pauli matrices @xmath21 and @xmath22 , @xmath23 .",
    "the four functions @xmath24 and the dilaton function @xmath25 depend only on @xmath10 and @xmath9 .    with this ansatz",
    "the energy density @xmath26 becomes @xmath27         + e^{2 \\kappa \\phi } \\frac{f^2}{2 m^2 }   ( \\partial_\\rho w_2 ^ 3 - \\partial_z w_1 ^ 3 ) ^2   \\nonumber \\\\        & + & e^{2 \\kappa \\phi } \\frac{f^2}{2 m l } \\left [    \\left ( \\partial_\\rho w_3 ^ 1 + \\frac { ( n w_1 ^ 3 + w_3 ^ 1 ) } { \\rho }       - g w_1 ^ 3 w_3 ^ 2 \\right)^2   + \\left ( \\partial_\\rho w_3 ^ 2 + \\frac {             w_3 ^ 2   } { \\rho }       + g w_1 ^ 3 w_3 ^ 1 \\right)^2   \\right .",

    "with respect to the transformation @xmath28 the functions @xmath29 transform like a scalar doublet , and the functions @xmath30 transform like a 2-dimensional gauge field .",
    "we fix the gauge by choosing the gauge condition @xcite @xmath31    to make contact with the spherically symmetric case @xmath8 , we introduce the coordinates @xmath32 and @xmath33 ( @xmath34 , @xmath35 ) and the gauge field functions @xmath36",
    "@xcite @xmath37 the spherically symmetric ansatz of ref .",
    "@xcite is recovered for @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath8 .    the above ansatz and gauge choice yield a set of coupled partial differential equations for the metric and the matter field functions . to obtain regular asymptotically flat solutions with finite energy density",
    "we impose at the origin ( @xmath40 ) the boundary conditions @xmath41 and at infinity ( @xmath42 ) @xmath43 further we impose for all functions that their derivatives with respect to @xmath33 vanish on the @xmath10- and the @xmath9-axis @xcite .",
    "the boundary conditions for the gauge field functions at infinity imply , that the solutions are magnetically neutral .",
    "note , that a finite value of the dilaton field at infinity can always be transformed to zero via @xmath44 , @xmath45 .",
    "the mass @xmath46 of the regular axially symmetric solutions can be obtained directly from the total energy - momentum `` tensor '' @xmath47 of matter and gravitation , @xmath48 @xcite , or from @xmath49 both expressions give the same values for the mass of the solutions .",
    "we now remove the dependence on the coupling constants @xmath50 and @xmath51 from the differential equations by changing to the dimensionless coordinate @xmath52 , the dimensionless dilaton function @xmath53 and the dimensionless coupling constant @xmath54 ( @xmath55 corresponds to string theory ) .",
    "the dimensionless mass is then given by @xmath56 .",
    "in the spherically symmetric case the following relations between the metric and the dilaton field hold @xcite @xmath57 @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the dilaton charge .",
    "these relations also hold for the regular axially symmetric solutions considered here .",
    "their derivation is based on the equation of motion of the dilaton field and will be given elsewhere @xcite .",
    "subject to the above boundary conditions , we solve the equations numerically . to map spatial infinity to the finite value @xmath60 , we employ the radial coordinate @xmath61 .",
    "the numerical calculations are based on the newton - raphson method .",
    "the equations are discretized on a non - equidistant grid in @xmath62 and @xmath33 .",
    "typical grids used have sizes @xmath63 , covering the integration region @xmath64 and @xmath65 . the numerical error for the functions is estimated to be on the order of @xmath66 and @xmath67 for @xmath68 and @xmath69 , respectively .    in tables  1 and 2",
    "we show the dimensionless mass of a subset of the regular axially symmetric solutions obtained so far .",
    "the energy density @xmath70 of the solutions has a strong peak along the @xmath10-axis , and it decreases monotonically along the @xmath9-axis .",
    "thus equal density contours reveal a torus - like shape of the solutions . as a typical example",
    "we show the energy density @xmath71 of the solution with @xmath72 , @xmath73 and dilaton coupling constant @xmath55 in fig .",
    "[ eps ] .",
    "with @xmath0 and @xmath3 fixed and increasing @xmath1 , the location of the peak of the energy density moves inward and the peak increases in height , whereas with fixed @xmath1 and @xmath3 and increasing @xmath0 the peak of the energy density moves outward and decreases in height .",
    "this is demonstrated in table  2 .",
    "the gauge field functions @xmath74 and the dilaton function @xmath75 of the regular axially symmetric eymd and eym solutions look similar to those of the corresponding ymd solutions @xcite . like the dilaton function @xmath75 , the metric functions do not exhibit a strong angular dependence .",
    "these functions will be exhibited elsewhere @xcite .    for fixed @xmath0 and @xmath3 ,",
    "with increasing @xmath1 the sequence of axially symmetric solutions tends to a limiting solution .",
    "the gauge field functions @xmath76 tend to the limiting function @xmath77 .",
    "( because of the boundary conditions at the origin and at infinity , they approach the limiting function nonuniformly . ) the dilaton functions @xmath78 tend to the limiting function @xmath79 , which represents the dilaton function of the `` extremal '' emd solution @xcite with @xmath0 units of magnetic charge and the same value of @xmath3 .",
    "this is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ phi ] for @xmath72 and @xmath55 .",
    "we observe , that @xmath78 deviates from @xmath79 only in an inner region , which decreases exponentially with @xmath1 .    for finite values of @xmath3 and",
    "fixed @xmath0 , the sequences of solutions thus approach as limiting solutions the `` extremal '' emd solutions @xcite with magnetic charge @xmath0 and the same @xmath3 .",
    "this generalizes the corresponding observation for the spherically symmetric solutions with @xmath8 @xcite . for @xmath80",
    "the limiting solutions represent the exterior of extremal reissner - nordstrm black holes with charge @xmath0 . for the ymd solutions the limiting solutions are magnetic monopoles with @xmath0 units of charge @xcite .",
    "the limiting values for the mass , @xmath81 @xcite , represent upper bounds for the sequences , as observed from tables  1 and 2 .",
    "the larger @xmath0 , the slower is the convergence to the limiting solution .",
    "further details on the convergence properties of the sequences of solutions will be given elsewhere @xcite .",
    "in addition to the known static spherically symmetric solutions , both eymd and eym theory possess sequences of regular static axially symmetric solutions .",
    "these sequences are characterized by the winding number @xmath7 , and the solutions within each sequence by the node number @xmath1 .",
    "( for @xmath8 the spherically symmetric solutions are recovered . ) for fixed @xmath0 and @xmath3 , with increasing @xmath1 the solutions tend to the `` extremal '' einstein - maxwell - dilaton solution @xcite with @xmath0 units of magnetic charge and the same @xmath3 .",
    "the multisphalerons have a torus - like shape . apart from that ,",
    "many properties of the axially symmetric solutions are similar to those of their spherically symmetric counterparts .",
    "in particular , there is all reason to believe , that these regular static axially symmetric eymd and eym solutions are unstable .",
    "since we can also associate the chern - simons number @xmath82 @xcite ( for odd @xmath1 @xcite ) with these solutions , we interpret them as _",
    "gravitating multisphalerons_.    having constructed the axially symmetric solutions in eymd and eym theory , it appears straightforward to construct analogous solutions is theories with a higgs field .",
    "we therefore expect to find gravitating axially symmetric multimonopoles ( for the case of a higgs triplet ) or gravitating axially symmetric multisphalerons ( for the case of a higgs doublet ) .",
    "similarly there should be gravitating axially symmetric multiskyrmions .",
    "work along these lines is in progress .",
    "we consider the above set of solutions to be the simplest type of gravitating non - spherical regular solutions of eymd and eym theory .",
    "we conjecture , that there are gravitating regular solutions with much more complex shapes and only discrete symmetries left .",
    "this conjecture is based on the observation , that for some types of solitons in flat space the symmetry structure of the ( energetically lowest ) solutions becomes increasingly complex with increasing winding number or charge @xmath0 .",
    "for instance for skyrmions , the lowest @xmath8 solution is spherically symmetric , the lowest @xmath83 solution has axial symmetry , and the lowest @xmath84 solutions respect only discrete crystal - like symmetries @xcite .",
    "but eymd and eym theory also possess black hole solutions .",
    "the non - abelian spherically symmetric black hole solutions may be regarded as black holes inside sphalerons @xcite .",
    "we conjecture , that also the gravitating axially symmetric solutions can accommodate black holes in their interior .",
    "and this conjecture naturally extends to gravitating solutions with more complex shapes and less symmetry .",
    "the existence of such black hole solutions without rotational symmetry inside multimonopoles has also been conjectured from a stability argument @xcite .",
