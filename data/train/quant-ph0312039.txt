    "in recent years , a great deal of effort has been devoted to the understanding of entanglement in spin systems .",
    "in fact , a number of schemes for quantum information processing based on spin interactions have been proposed ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) , motivating the theoretical study of the amount of entanglement present in spin models  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the interest in the content of entanglement available in statistical systems has also been increased due to the observed relationship between entanglement and the theory of quantum critical phenomena  @xcite .",
    "indeed , it has been noted that quantum phase transitions present in condensed matter systems can be described from the point of view of entanglement . as examples ,",
    "the ground state pairwise entanglement of xy and xxz chains in a transverse magnetic field has been worked out  @xcite , from which scaling behavior near the transition point is observed .",
    "for the transverse field ising model , the quantum phase transition has also been characterized through the concept of localizable entanglement  @xcite , which is the maximal amount of entanglement that can be localized for two particles in the system by doing local measurements on the other particles .",
    "the typical scale for which the localizable entanglement decays defines the entanglement length , which diverges in the ising quantum critical point  @xcite .",
    "moreover , in the case of first - order quantum phase transitions , changes in the amount of pairwise entanglement at quantum critical points have been shown to be associated to macroscopic jumps in the magnetization for some frustrated spin models  @xcite . in a general framework",
    ", the association between quantum phase transitions and bipartite entanglement has recently been analysed in ref .",
    "hence , in addition to its intrinsic relevance for quantum information applications , entanglement also plays an interesting role in the context of statistical mechanics .    keeping both motivations in mind ,",
    "the aim of this work is to analyse the effect of a topologically non - trivial structure on the entanglement of a spin system .",
    "more specifically , we shall discuss the spin-1/2 anisotropic ferromagnetic heisenberg chain in the presence of domain walls .",
    "a related discussion about entanglement in spin models with open boundary conditions can be found in ref .",
    "the quantum domains can be generated by an antiparallel magnetic field on the boundary spins of the chain . for a critical value of the magnetic field ,",
    "the system undergoes a first - order quantum phase transition  @xcite , which arises from the interplay among the exchange coupling @xmath0 in the xy direction , the anisotropy @xmath1 in the @xmath2-axis ( @xmath3 ) , and the magnetic field @xmath4 on the boundary .",
    "the quantum critical point separates a ferromagnetic phase from a kink - type phase , in which we show that entanglement is present .",
    "it is interesting to observe that entanglement is known to be usually absent for ferromagnetic heisenberg interactions regardless a magnetic field is present in a particular direction or the effect of temperature is taken into account  @xcite . even in the anisotropic chain , namely the xxz model",
    ", entanglement is vanishing in the region @xmath5  @xcite .",
    "actually it has recently been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that entanglement can be nonvanishing for finite ferromagnetic heisenberg chains at low temperatures when a magnetic field is applied .",
    "however this entanglement is seen to disappear in the thermodynamical limit .",
    "the domain walls can thus be seen , due to the induction of the phase transition , as a general mechanism to promote the existence of entanglement in heisenberg models with ferromagnetic couplings .",
    "moreover , we will show that an analysis for large chains , in the kink - type phase , suggests that entanglement is independent of the boundary magnetic field .",
    "this result will allow for a general expression , in terms of the length of the chain , for the entanglement between arbitrary spins in the ground state , which is exactly known at the critical point .",
    "we shall also investigate the region @xmath6 , corresponding to a gapless regime for @xmath7 and a gapful phase for @xmath8 .",
    "for these ranges of anisotropy , the distribution of nearest neighbor entanglement oscillates along the chain , exhibiting a clearly different behavior from the kink - type phase , where a monotonic increase is observed from the boundaries towards the center .",
    "interestingly , a characterization of the critical anisotropy @xmath9 can also be achieved from multiparticle entanglement properties of the model .",
    "indeed , we will show that @xmath9 corresponds to a minimum of the derivative of the global measure of entanglement introduced by meyer and wallach in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the section",
    "ii , we describe the quantum heisenberg model for a ferromagnetic domain wall , numerically discussing , for chains up to @xmath10 sites , the general properties of the entanglement available in the system and its relation with the quantum phase transition . in section iii , we perform an analytical computation of entanglement for general pairs of spins starting from the exact ground state wave functions at the critical point .",
    "section iv is devoted to the numerical discussion of the case @xmath6 . in section",
    "v we analyse the entanglement properties of the model from the point of view of a multipartite measure .",
    "finally , in section v , we summarize our results , presenting our conclusions .",
    "the hamiltonian for the one - dimensional heisenberg model in the presence of a magnetic field generating domain walls reads  @xcite @xmath11where the coupling @xmath12 and the anisotropy @xmath13 are exchange parameters , and the effective magnetic field @xmath14 represents the interactions of the spins with the boundary surfaces .",
    "the spin-1/2 operators @xmath15 , @xmath16 , act on the site @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) and are given by @xmath19 , with @xmath20 denoting pauli matrices . in order to focus the discussion on the values of the anisotropy and the magnetic field ,",
    "let us assume , without loss of generality , @xmath21 . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the model presents a critical field @xmath22that separates two quantum phases for a chain of arbitrary length : a ferromagnetic ground state ( @xmath23 ) and kink - type ground state ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "remarkably , eq .  ( @xmath25 ) provides the exact location of the phase transition for chains of any size , the critical field remaining fixed as the number of sites is changed .",
    "moreover , the ground state is exactly known at the quantum critical point , with degenerate wave functions given by  @xcite @xmath26where @xmath27 denotes the magnetization sector , @xmath28 , @xmath29 is the basis where @xmath30 is diagonal , and @xmath31 is the normalization factor , which is found to be @xmath32the sums over spin configurations @xmath33 appearing in eqs .",
    "@xmath34 and @xmath35 are to be taken in the sector of magnetization @xmath36 .",
    "the parameter @xmath37 is defined by the following expressions @xmath38    before describing our results we present the definition of concurrence , which is the measure of entanglement used throughout this paper . as shown in refs .",
    "@xcite , there is a one - to - one correspondence between concurrence and entanglement of formation  @xcite , the latter being a strictly increasing function of the first . the concurrence @xmath39 for a pair of qubits labelled as 1 and 2 is defined by  @xcite @xmath40 where the @xmath41 are the square roots , in decreasing order , of the eigenvalues of the operator @xmath42 in eq .",
    "( [ rdef ] ) , @xmath43 denotes the density matrix , which can be either pure or mixed , for the pair of qubits 1 and 2 , and @xmath44 its complex conjugate in the the standard basis @xmath45 . in a system with more than two qubits , @xmath43",
    "is obtained by tracing the density operator over the other qubits .",
    "the concurrence ranges from 0 , implying an unentangled state , to 1 , in which the two qubits are maximally entangled .    as mentioned , the critical point given in eq .",
    "( @xmath25 ) is invariant under changes in the size of the chain . actually , as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , two sites are enough to identify the critical field . from the point of view of entanglement , the phase transition can indeed be observed by looking at jumps in the concurrence for arbitrary pairs of spins . for @xmath46 ,",
    "the system is in the ferromagnetic phase , with vanishing concurrence for all the pairs . at the critical point ,",
    "a wave function in the sector of magnetization @xmath47 , which is entangled , becomes part of the ground state , but its mixture with the other sectors destroys entanglement .",
    "as @xmath4 crosses the critical value , the ground state becomes non - degenerate , with components only in the sector @xmath47 , resulting in a jump in the concurrence for any pair of spins .",
    "this kind of non - analytical behavior in first - order transitions has been found in ref .",
    "@xcite , where magnetization plateaus are associated to jumps in the entanglement . in our case , numerical computation of concurrence up to @xmath10 spins shows that the jumps are always observed in @xmath48 regardless the number @xmath49 of sites , in agreement with ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "concerning the distribution of entanglement along the chain , it is important to observe that the quantum domains break the ground state translation invariance , which implies that entanglement will depend not only on the distance of the spins , but also on their positions in the chain .",
    "the result is a concentration of pairwise entanglement in the central region , with the spins in the center forming the most entangled pairs .",
    "in fact , for a system with even number @xmath49 of sites , it is possible to obtain a high degree of concurrence for the central pair , which evolves exponentially towards a stabilization value as we increase @xmath49 .",
    "for instance , we show in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] that this concurrence stabilizes in @xmath50 for @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "this exponential behavior towards the stabilization is observed for all the pairs and the stabilization value is quickly obtained for large @xmath1 and magnetic fields near @xmath53 .",
    "in fact , the stabilization value is strongly dependent on the anisotropy . in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] we show how the concurrences for the pairs @xmath54 and @xmath55 change as a function of @xmath1 in a chain with @xmath56 sites .",
    "note that , differently from the antiferromagnetic xxz model without the quantum domains  @xcite , the maximum of @xmath57 occurs for values of anisotropy greater than the isotropic value @xmath58 .    on the other hand , the study of the concurrence as a function of the magnetic field suggests that the stabilization value is independent of the field for large chains .",
    "for example , we show in table  [ t1 ] the concurrrence for the central pair as a function of @xmath49 , for anisotropy @xmath59 and several values of @xmath4 . as it can be seen",
    ", there is clearly indication to an approximately constant value @xmath60 for any value of @xmath61 assuming that we are not extremely far from the critical field @xmath53 .",
    "as we will show in section  [ sce ] , this numerical result leads to an analytical derivation of a general expression for the concurrence between arbitrary spins since , as given by eq .",
    "( @xmath62 , the exact ground state of the model is known at the critical magnetic field for a general @xmath49 .",
    ".concurrrence for the central pair @xmath63 as a function of the chain size @xmath49 for @xmath59 and @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 .",
    "note that , as @xmath49 is increased , @xmath63 tends to the stabilization value @xmath67 independently of @xmath68 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "in this section , we shall derive an analytical expression , holding in the kink - type phase , for the concurrences between arbitrary spins along the chain . as will be shown",
    ", this formula comes from the analysis of the entanglement present in one of the degenerates ground states at @xmath48 , i.e. the wave function with magnetization @xmath47 .",
    "thus , let us suppose that the system is prepared in the vanishing magnetization state @xmath69 , given by eq .  @xmath34 .",
    "then , the corresponding density operator is @xmath70where the sums over @xmath33 and @xmath71 are performed in the sector @xmath47 .",
    "the reduced density operator for a particular pair of spins in the sites @xmath72 and @xmath73 can be written as @xmath74with @xmath75 denoting trace over all degrees of freedom except the spins in the positions @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "therefore the matrix elements of @xmath76 are @xmath77where @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 , and @xmath81 represent the spin in the corresponding positions @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "the sum over @xmath33 stands for the set of @xmath82 spin configurations @xmath83the conditions ( [ condm01 ] ) and ( [ condm0 ] ) ensure that we are working in the sector of magnetization @xmath47 .",
    "writing @xmath76 as a matrix , we have @xmath84 with the functions @xmath85 @xmath86 given by @xmath87 where the sums over the @xmath82 spin configurations @xmath88 are required to obey the restrictions @xmath89 we are then able to compute the concurrence @xmath57 , by means of eq .",
    "@xmath90 , for the spins in the sites @xmath72 and @xmath73 , which gives @xmath91hence we have obtained a simple and very general expression to analyse concurrences in the model . in fact , as we discussed in section  [ cc ] , the ground state in the kink - type quantum phase is given by the wave function with @xmath47 and the corresponding concurrences are independent of the magnetic field for large chains ( see table  [ t1 ] ) .",
    "therefore , concurrences obtained from the wave function with vanishing magnetization at @xmath48 , given by eq .",
    "( [ finalc ] ) , turn out to hold also in the kink - type phase , where @xmath68 . in other words ,",
    "entanglement in a large chain , computed from the @xmath47 ground state wave function , does not change as the magnetic field is increased .",
    "( [ finalc ] ) displays a good property of being defined in terms of sums and not in terms of matrices , which are difficult to deal with when we have a large number of sites .",
    "it is worth mentioning that this expression holds as a good approximation even in the case of small number @xmath49 of sites assuming that the magnetic field is close to the critical value @xmath53 .",
    "agreement with numerical simulations is observed , providing support to the exponential behavior , with respect to @xmath49 , of the pairwise concurrences along the chain .",
    "as discussed above , the concurrence for any pair of spins , for @xmath93 , presents an exponential behavior towards a constant value in the kink - type phase .",
    "moreover , the distribution of nearest neighbors concurrences along the chain exhibits a peak at the center , decaying as we get nearer the boundary .",
    "however , as @xmath1 is changed to less than the critical value @xmath58 , entanglement properties become rather different .",
    "as shown in fig  [ f3 ] , the distribution of concurrences for nearest pairs are now characterized by an oscillating behavior , with a sequence of peaks along the chain .",
    "observe that the oscillations become sharper as the anisotropy @xmath1 is decreased and that the effect of the boundary field is a displacement of the peaks , with a damping of the concurrences .",
    "the peaks can physically be explained by the tendency to antiferromagnetic ordering as @xmath92 , which is observed from the negative sign of the two - point correlation functions @xmath94 for nearest neighbor spins @xmath17 and @xmath95 .",
    "thus , for @xmath96 the spins @xmath97 tend to align antiferromagnetically , trying to form a bell state , and similarly the spins @xmath98 , @xmath99 , ... , @xmath100 ( for @xmath49 even ) .",
    "the concurrences for these spins are greater than for the pairs @xmath101 , @xmath102 , ... ,",
    "@xmath103 which , despite also exhibiting a tendency to antiferromagnetic alignment , are less correlated .",
    "when the domain walls are considered , the boundary spins are governed by the quantum domains , favoring the correlations of the pairs @xmath101 , @xmath102 , ... , @xmath103 , which leads to a dislocation of the peaks , in addition to a reduction of their sharpness . in the next section",
    ", we will show that the critical anisotropy @xmath104 can also be very well characterized by looking at multiparticle entanglement properties of the model .",
    "let us discuss now some multiparticle entanglement properties of the model , which will be seen to provide support to the results presented before .",
    "it is important to emphasize that , for multiparticle systems , we do not have a unique measure of entanglement .",
    "then it turns out that a number of measures have been proposed  @xcite and different measures can be related to distinct physical aspects of multipartite entanglement .",
    "we shall consider here the so - called global entanglement , which is a scalable measure for pure states introduced by meyer and wallach in ref .",
    "@xcite . for a general quantum state @xmath105 in the hilbert space @xmath106 ,",
    "the global entanglement is @xmath107 where the vectors @xmath108 and @xmath109 , which are elements of the hilbert space @xmath110 , are defined by @xmath111 with @xmath112 , for @xmath113 , denoting the following operation over basis vectors @xmath114 of @xmath106 : @xmath115 in eq .",
    "( [ opmw ] ) , the symbol @xmath116 means absence .",
    "the function @xmath117 in eq .",
    "( [ mewa ] ) is the norm - squared of the wedge product of @xmath108 and @xmath109 @xmath118 it has recently been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the global entanglement can be expressed in a simple way in terms of the one - qubit reduced density operator of the system @xmath119 where @xmath120 is the density matrix for the spin @xmath121 after tracing out the rest .",
    "from eq .",
    "( [ qbre ] ) we can numerically compute the global entanglement in our model . since the measure is defined only for pure states",
    ", we shall always be referring to the kink - type phase , where @xmath68 . as a first property , and in agreement on the results for the concurrence , @xmath122 is seen to be independent of the magnetic field if we are not too far from the critical point .",
    "this motivates the analytical computation , as performed in the case of the concurrence in section  [ sce ] , of the global entanglement from the sector @xmath47 of the exact ground state eq .",
    "( [ gs ] ) .",
    "the one - qubit reduced density matrix for a site @xmath72 in this case reads @xmath123 where @xmath31 is the normalization factor given by eq .",
    "( [ n ] ) and the functions @xmath85 @xmath124 are defined by @xmath125 with the sums over the @xmath126 spin configurations @xmath88 obeying the restrictions @xmath127 thus the global entanglement @xmath122 can analytically be expressed by @xmath128 the expression above can be used to compute , in a very good approximation , the global entanglement for large chains in the kink - type phase assuming that we are not extremely far from the critical point , since a very high antiparallel boundary magnetic field can considerably increase @xmath122 .",
    "a further nice porperty of the global entanglement is that it presents an inflection point which characterizes the transition from the kink - type phase to the regime @xmath92 .",
    "in fact computing , from eq .",
    "( [ qbre ] ) , the derivative of @xmath122 with respect to the anisotropy , at a fixed number of sites , we observe the existence of a minimum exactly in @xmath104 , which gets more pronounced as we increase the number of sites .",
    "this behavior is explicitly displayed in fig .",
    "this characterization of the transition is rather attractive since , based on a multipartite measure of entanglement , it reflects a qualitative change in the variations of the ground state wave function of the system .",
    "related characterizations of quantum phase transitions in terms of the global entanglement can be found in the ref .",
    "@xcite for the transverse field ising model and in ref .",
    "@xcite for the single - mode dicke hamiltonian .",
    "in this paper , we have presented a discussion of how a nontrivial geometric interface , the ferromagnetic domain wall , can modify the pattern of entanglement in the spin-@xmath129 anisotropic heisenberg chain . as shown ,",
    "the quantum domains can be seen as a mechanism to generate pairwise entanglement in a model with heisenberg ferromagnetic couplings , which is usually unentangled .",
    "moreover we have seen that the amount of entanglement generated can be relatively large , specially for the central pair of spins .",
    "these effects are consequence of the first - order quantum phase transition induced by the presence of the domain walls . as a further nice result",
    ", we have been able to compute an analytical general expression for the concurrence of large chains thanks to the numerical observation that , in that case , entanglement is independent of the boundary magnetic field .",
    "finally , we have detected different patterns for the entanglement in the kink - type and @xmath92 regimes . from the point of view of pairwise",
    "entanglement , these regions are identified by a different distribution of entanglement along the chain .",
    "moreover these distinct phases have also been shown to be characterized by looking at the problem from the point of view of multiparticle entanglement . by considering the derivative of the global entanglement with respect to the anisotropy we showed that a minimum occurs exactly at the critical point @xmath104 .",
