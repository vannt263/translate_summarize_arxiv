    "one of the main objectives of linear collider experiments is the precision spectroscopy of new particles predicted in theories of physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) , such as supersymmetry ( susy ) . in this talk",

    "the parameters chosen are such that the lightest neutralino has a mass of 340 gev , the charginos and heavier neutralinos have masses in the range 643 to 917 gev , the right handed selectron and smuon have a mass of 1010.8 gev , the left handed selectron and the sneutrino have masses of 1110.4 gev and 1097.2 gev respectively .",
