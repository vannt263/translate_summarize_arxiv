    "most of the attention given to ferromagnetic / antiferromagnetic ( fm / afm ) bilayers is normally directed to the changes of the magnetic properties of the fm when it is in contact with the afm .",
    "the commonly observed effects are a unidirectional shift ( exchange bias ) and a significant increase of the coercivity @xcite .",
    "the blocking temperature , @xmath0 , below which these effects are observed , is comparable to the bulk neel temperature when the afm film is thick , but can be considerably lower when the afm film is thin @xcite .",
    "it is generally believed that this reduction of the blocking temperature is due to finite size effects in the afm , _",
    "i.e. _ the ordering temperature of the afm is decreased due to its finite thickness @xcite . in a recent neutron experiment on coo / fe@xmath1o@xmath2 ,",
    "however , van der zaag _ et .",
    "_ @xcite have found that the afm shows signs of ordering above @xmath0 .",
    "this indicates that the proximity of the fm influences the phase transition in the afm in a way that can not be predicted from studying free afm films .",
    "in this paper we use monte carlo simulations to analyze the effect of the fm on the transition between disordered and ordered states in the afm for various film thicknesses and compensated exchange across the fm / afm interface .",
    "the system studied here consists of a multi - layered ferromagnetic ( fm ) film coupled to an underlying multi - layered antiferromagnetic ( afm ) film with no lattice mismatch at the fm / afm interface .",
    "the hamiltonian of the model is given by @xmath3 where @xmath4 is a three - dimensional classical heisenberg spin of unit length , @xmath5 denotes nearest - neighbor pairs of spins coupled with exchange interactions @xmath6 on the fm film , @xmath7 on the afm film , and @xmath8 at the fm / afm interface , which is on a ( 001 ) plane .",
    "spins on the afm film have a uniaxial single - site anisotropy @xmath9 , whose easy axis is along the @xmath10 axis .",
    "in contrast , the single - site anisotropy for spins on the fm film has a hard - axis ( @xmath11 ) along the @xmath12 direction , which is perpendicular to the fm / afm interfacial plane .",
    "no external magnetic field is applied on the films .",
    "the structure of the films is a body - centered cubic lattice , with linear sizes @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 , measured in terms of two - spin unit cells . @xmath16 and @xmath17 denote the number of unit - cell layers on the afm and fm films , respectively . hence , the total number of spins in the lattice is @xmath18 .",
    "we use periodic boundary conditions along the @xmath19 and @xmath10 directions and free boundary conditions along the @xmath12 direction .",
    "the effect of the film thickness on the fm and afm transition temperatures is studied for fixed interaction parameters .",
    "we consider @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and a compensated interface with @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is a random number uniformly sampled in the interval @xmath26 $ ] .",
    "values of the film thickness used are @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 , with several cross sections ( @xmath30 , and @xmath31 ) to analyze finite - size effects .",
    "the order parameter for the ferromagnetic transition is the uniform magnetization per spin @xmath32 , whereas to characterize the antiferromagnetic transition it is necessary to divide the bcc lattice into two simple cubic sublattices , denoted i and ii , and consider the staggered magnetization per spin defined as @xmath33 .",
    "our simulations were carried out using importance sampling monte carlo methods @xcite , with metropolis algorithm , at fixed temperature @xmath34 . typically @xmath35 monte carlo steps / site ( mcs )",
    "were used for computing averages after about @xmath36 mcs were discarded for thermalization . whenever not shown ,",
    "error bars in the figures are smaller than the symbol sizes .",
    "figs.([figthick]a ) and ( [ figthick]b ) show the uniform and staggered magnetizations per spin for films of different thicknesses and fixed cross section . at low temperature ,",
    "both @xmath37 and @xmath38 tend to 0.5 , indicating ordered fm and afm films ( note that both quantities are computed for the entire lattice and thus go to 0.5 instead of 1.0 when the films are ordered ) . as the temperature increases , both @xmath37 and @xmath38 decay to zero , indicating disordered spin configurations on both films at higher temperatures .",

    "therefore , we have considered different cross sections for each film thickness .",
    "illutrations of finite - size effects on the uniform and the staggered magnetizations near the phase transitions are presented in figs.([figcross]a ) and ( [ figcross]b ) , respectively .",
    "these figures show that as the cross section increases , the decay of the magnetizations @xmath37 and @xmath38 to zero becomes sharper .",
    "such dependence of order parameters on finite lattice sizes is characteristic of real phase transitions .",
    "similar finite - size effects were observed for the uniform and the staggered magnetizations of films of other thicknesses .",
    "the behavior of the uniform and staggered magnetizations shown in figs.([figthick]a ) and ( [ figthick]b ) , with finite - size effects described above , suggests that for a given film thickness there are two distinct phase transitions , one occuring on the afm film and one on the fm film .",
    "the afm transition temperature seems to be slightly higher than the fm one , presumably due to the higher anisotropy on the afm film .",
    "in addition , it appears that the transition temperatures on both the fm and the afm films increase with film thickness .",

    ", the fm transition appears to be at @xmath45 ; however , the nature of this transition has not been determined yet .",
    "figs.([figlayer]a ) and ( [ figlayer]b ) show the @xmath19 , @xmath10 , and @xmath12 components of the uniform magnetization per site as a function of film layer , for @xmath41 , at @xmath46 and @xmath47 , respectively .",
    "while fig.([figlayer]a ) illustrates the behavior of the layer magnetizations when both films are in the respective ordered states , fig.([figlayer]b ) corresponds to a temperature above the fm transition and below the afm one . in our notation ,",
    "layers 1 to 12 belong to the afm film , whereas layers 13 to 24 comprise the fm film .",

    "the solid lines are guides to the eyes.,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]    layer magnetizations on the afm film are almost entirely along the @xmath10-axis , which is the easy axis for the uniaxial anisotropy on this film .",
    "because of the bcc lattice structure , spins on consecutive layers belong to different sublattices ; hence consecutive layer magnetizations on the afm film have different sign . in contrast , layer magnetizations on the fm film in the ordered state are essentially parallel , with a large component along the @xmath19-axis . in the absence of the afm film ,",
    "spins on the fm film have global rotation symmetry on the @xmath19-@xmath10 plane , which is the easy plane for spins on this film .",
    "however , coupling to the afm film causes spins on the fm layers to orient preferentially in a direction perpendicular to the afm easy axis .",
    "the slightly lower values of the magnetizations for layers 1 and 24 in fig.([figlayer]a ) are due to the free boundary conditions used along the @xmath12 direction .",
    "similar boundary effects are seen in fig.([figlayer]b ) .",
    "we have used extensive monte carlo simulations to study a system of coupled fm / afm films , with compensated exchange across the interface . for the values of anisotropies and interaction parameters considered",
    ", it appears that the fm and the afm phase transitions occur at different temperatures .",
    "the latter transition is consistent with the two - dimensional ising universality class .",
    "our preliminary simulations suggest that both phase transition temperatures increase with the film thickness .",
