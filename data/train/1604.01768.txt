    "all large galaxies possess globular cluster ( gcs ) populations , or systems , comprising hundreds or thousands of individual gcs .",
    "they are often used as discrete tracers of galaxy assembly , especially at the outer regions of large galaxies where they can be more easily observed than the faint integrated galaxy light . moreover ,",
    "they provide information on the various processes and progenitors that are present in the different phases of the build up of early - type galaxies ( zaritsky et  al .",
    "2014 ) , which are the dominant structures at the centers of galaxy clusters ( dressler 1980 ) .",
    "interestingly , the number of gcs , or the total mass of the gc system , appears to be related to the mass of the dark matter halo of the galaxy or galaxy cluster ( blakeslee et  al .  1997 ;",
    "blakeslee 1999 ; bekki et  al .",
    "2008 ; spitler & forbes 2009 ; alamo - martnez et  al .",
    "2013 ; hudson et  al .",
    "however , even at a given mass , there is significant galaxy - to - galaxy scatter in the number and other properties of the gc systems , and this scatter is likely the result of environmental effects and stochastic variations in the galaxy formation histories ( e.g. , peng et  al .",
    "2008 ; harris et  al .",
    "gc formation requires very high star formation rates , and thus the major star formation episodes and assembly histories of early - type galaxies can be traced by the observed properties of their gc systems , such as their colors , metallicities , and spatial distributions ( e.g. , brodie & strader 2006 ; peng et  al .",
    "2006 ; forte et  al .",
    "2014 ) .    since nearly all the gcs surrounding massive galaxies are old",
    ", metallicity is the main stellar population variable among individual gcs within a gc system .",
    "however , at present the acquisition of large samples of spectroscopic metallicities for large numbers of gc systems is impractical . with the exception of a few nearby early - type galaxies such as ngc5128 ( e.g. , beasley et  al .",
    "2008 ; woodley et  al .",
    "2010 ) , the majority of the lick index - type spectroscopic studies using 10 m class telescopes have been carried out on samples of @xmath11 to 50  gcs .",
    "one  recent major effort on this front is the sluggs survey ( brodie et  al .",
    "2014 ) , which uses the calcium ii triplet ( cat ) index as a metallicity proxy for over 1000 gcs within a sample of 25 gc systems .",
    "cat index distributions have been investigated by usher et  al .",
    "( 2012 ) , and a clear case of bimodality was presented by brodie et  al .",
    "( 2012 ) for the edge - on s0 galaxy ngc3115 .",
    "obtaining spectra with sufficiently high signal - to - noise ratios to measure accurate metallicities for large samples of extragalactic gcs is difficult ; obtaining large samples of high - quality photometric colors is much simpler .",
    "optical color distributions for gc systems of massive galaxies are generally found to be bimodal ( e.g. , peng et  al .",
    "2006 ) ; however , this bimodality does not always hold when considering other color combinations including near - infrared ( nir ; blakeslee et  al .",
    "2012 ; chies - santos et  al .",
    "2012 ) or uv bands ( yoon et  al .",
    "2011a , b ) . cantiello & blakeslee ( 2007 ; see also puzia et  al .",
    "2002 ) have shown that optical / nir colors are better metallicity proxies than purely optical colors .",
    "optical wavelengths in old stellar systems are sensitive to the red giant branch , but also to stars on the horizontal branch ( hb ) and near the main sequence turn - off point , and therefore are degenerate in age and metallicity .",
    "the nir wavelength range is dominated by red giant branch stars , so the optical - nir colors are therefore mainly sensitive to metallicity . moreover , yoon et  al .",
    "( 2006 ) have shown that non - linear color - metallicity relations , possibly related to a sharp transition in the hb morphology at a certain metallicity , can transform a unimodal metallicity distribution into bimodal optical color distributions ( see also richtler 2006 ) . despite bimodal metallicity distributions found for galaxies such as ngc3115 and the milky way ,",
    "color - color nonlinearities are present to a certain degree ( cantiello et  al .",
    "2014 ; vanderbeke et al .",
    "2014 ) and are not yet fully understood . in a study of stacked gc spectra around the cat region for 10 galaxies ,",
    "usher et  al .",
    "( 2015 ) found galaxy - to - galaxy variations in the cat - color relations , implying that different types of galaxies require different color - metallicity transformations for estimating gc metallicities from photometric data .",
    "the situation is even more complex .",
    "the bimodality in the optical color distributions of gcs around massive galaxies varies in both the relative proportions of blue and red gcs and in the mean colors of these two components . even within a given galaxy",
    "there are variations .",
    "for instance , the blue gcs of certain massive galaxies are observed to have redder colors at brighter magnitudes .",
    "this color - luminosity relation , or `` blue tilt '' ( harris et  al .  2006 ; mieske et  al .  2006 ; strader et  al .",
    "2006 ; wehner et  al .",
    "2008 ) has been suggested to be due to self - enrichment ( e.g. , strader & smith 2008 ; bailin & harris 2009 ) . the blue tilt only becomes significant for gcs with masses above @xmath12 but this effect has important implications for color distribution studies as the location of the blue and red peaks will vary with the magnitude range of the gcs considered .",
    "the coma cluster of galaxies is a truly massive and rich galaxy cluster at a mean redshift of @xmath13 ( colless & dunn 1996 ) , corresponding to a distance of about 100mpc ( for @xmath14 ) .",
    "its virial mass of @xmath15 ( kubo et  al .",

    "much of the remaining portion of coma s core gc system belongs to its cd galaxy ngc4874 , which also has a bimodal color distribution , but with a blue population that is somewhat redder than the blue igcs .    this paper presents an analysis of new , significantly deeper acs optical data than was obtained by the acsccs , with the addition of new high resolution _",

    "as part of _ hst _  program go-11711 , we imaged ngc4874 with the advanced camera for surveys wide field channel ( acs / wfc ) for four orbits in f814w ( @xmath1 ) and one orbit in f475w ( @xmath0 ) ; to this , we added additional imaging in @xmath0from go-10861 .",

    "we corrected for galactic extinction toward ngc4874 assuming @xmath20  mag ( schlegel et  al .",
    "1998 ) and the revised acs / wfc and wfc3/ir extinction coefficients ( for @xmath21 ) from schlafly & finkbeiner ( 2011 ) ; the resulting corrections were small , amounting to 0.030 , 0.014 , and 0.005  mag in @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 , respectively .",

    "since it is uncertain how good the evolutionary stellar population synthesis models are at nir wavelengths and the estimated k - corrections are small but model - dependent , we have not applied them to our magnitudes and colors for gc candidates .    in this paper , we calibrate the acs photometry to the ab system following bohlin ( 2012 ) and adopting the time - variable zero points from the online acs zeropoints calculator .",
    "the wfc3 photometry is calibrated using the ab zero points from the online wfc3 zero  point tables ( 06  march 2012 revision ) . for reference ,",

    "in order to detect point - like objects embedded in the extended galaxy halo light , we first removed the smooth galaxy light profiles from the final combined images .",
    "we constructed elliptical isophotal models for each of the bright galaxies in each of the stacked bandpass images using the iraf / stsdas tasks ellipse and bmodel , which use the fitting algorithm and the uncertainty estimation method described by jedrzejewski ( 1987 ) and busko ( 1996 ) .",
    "we started by making an initial model ( improved with later iterations ) of the brightest galaxy ( ngc4874 ) , then progressed by modeling the other galaxies in order of their luminosity . when running ellipse , we first masked bright foreground stars , bad pixels , and any bright galaxies in the field except for the galaxy being fitted ; then we modeled the isophotes of the galaxy light distribution . using the isophotal parameters from ellipse ,",
    "we then build a smooth galaxy model with bmodel .",
    "after subtracting the model from the original image , we fitted isophotes of the next brightest galaxy and subtracted this isophotal model as well",
    ". we repeated this process until we had subtracted ten galaxies in the acs / wfc image and four galaxies ( ngc4874 itself and three surrounding galaxies ) in the wfc3/ir image .",
    "as mentioned above , it was necessary to model the galaxies iteratively in order to achieve the cleanest model subtractions ( e.g. , alamo - martnez et  al .",
    "2013 ) .        after subtracting the elliptical isophotal models",
    ", we modeled the residual background using sextractor ( bertin & arnouts 1996 ) to fit a two - dimensional bicubic spline with the parameters @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "this removes residual structure on scales much larger than the full width half maximum ( fwhm ) of the point spread function ( psf ) , and thus does not detrimentally affect the point source photometry ( see jordn et  al .",
    "we note that subtraction of the isophotal model generated by the bmodel task sometimes results in a noticeable discontinuity in surface brightness at the `` edge '' of the model .",
    "however , because we modeled the galaxies to very low surface brightness levels , and performed careful iterative modeling to achieve flat local background levels , such residual `` edge '' features were generally in the noise .",
    "in addition , spurious detections associated with the model edges would be removed by our point source selection criteria described below .",
    "panels ( b ) through ( d ) of figure  [ fig : imgf814w ] respectively show our combined isophotal models for the galaxies labeled in panel ( a ) plus two additional galaxies ; the isophotal galaxy models plus the residual background map ; and the final `` residual image '' after subtracting the galaxy and residual background models . for comparison ,",
    "the stacked wfc3/ir f160w science image and residual image following galaxy and background map subtraction are presented in figure  [ fig : imgf160w ] .",
    "because of the smaller field of view , only ngc4874 and the three other galaxies ( labeled ) were modeled .",
    "disky residuals are noticeable in some cases , but the subtracted images are generally quite clean , revealing many faint sources .      object detection and photometric measurements were performed on the final residual images using sextractor independently for each bandpass ( i.e. , in `` single - image mode '' ) . for the acs photometry , we used the rms weight images produced by apsis as the sextractor weight images ( type map_rms ) . for the wfc3/ir f160w photometry",
    ", we used a variance map ( type map_var ) constructed from the inverse - variance image produced by multidrizzle , and including the photometric noise from the science data image itself . in order to flag bad pixels",
    ", we made maps denoting blank image areas , pixels close to frame boundaries , and the circular detector defect visible in wfc3/ir images .",
    "the maps were referenced using flag_image in sextractor .",
    "we ran sextractor with a gaussian detection filter to identify objects with an area of at least four connected pixels with a flux level above two times the background rms in the acs f475w and f814w images .",
    "the slightly larger value of @xmath28 was used for the wfc3/ir f160w image since the subpixel resampling from the original pixel scale to 01  pix@xmath10 during the multidrizzle run causes more noise correlation between neighboring pixels .",
    "separation of blended objects was performed using the sextractor parameter @xmath29 and @xmath30 and @xmath31 for acs / wfc and wfc3/ir images , respectively .",
    "the source catalogs extracted from the acs / wfc f475w and wfc3/ir f160w images were matched against the acs / wfc f814w catalog using the source positions to remove spurious sources from the multi - band data .",
    "we estimate total @xmath1  magnitudes for each object using the mag_auto  values . for the color estimations ,",
    "the aperture photometry was performed using apertures with radii of 3  pixels ( 015 for acs and 030 for wfc3/ir data ) as in blakeslee et  al .",
    "aperture corrections were determined for a typical gc at the coma distance using psf - convolved king models .",
    "the empirical psfs for acs / f475w , acs / f814w , and wfc3/f160w bands were produced with the same drizzle parameters , including interpolation kernel , pixfrac , and output scale ( all of which have important effects for magnitudes measured within small apertures ) as the science data for each band .",
    "our final aperture corrections for the 3-pixel radius sextractor apertures are @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34  mag for @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 , respectively , with uncertainties of @xmath35  mag .        in order to identify gc candidates",
    ", we used the f814w photometric catalog because of its higher signal - to - noise ratio ( @xmath36 ) than the f475w data , and larger field of view than the wfc3/ir image .",
    "prior to classifying candidates as gcs , we required the sextractor parameter @xmath37 for all three bands in order to exclude sources too near the image edges ( e.g. , puzia et  al .",
    "2014 ) . to limit our analysis to sources detected with @xmath38",
    ", we require @xmath39 ( the rms error on the magnitudes within the isophotal area ) in f814w to be less than 0.2  mag .",
    "figure  [ fig : selection ] shows our photometric selection criteria for probable gcs as a function of the total @xmath1  magnitudes , for which we adopt the values of mag_auto  measured with sextractor ( as an additional sanity check , we require the uncertainty in mag_autoto be less than 1  mag ) .",
    "as demonstrated in the top left panel of figure  [ fig : selection ] , the uncertainties on the isophotal magnitudes are smaller than 0.1  mag for the majority of the gc candidates brighter than the turnover of the gc luminosity function ( gclf ) , which is expected to occur at an ab magnitude of @xmath40  mag at the distance of the coma cluster ( peng et  al .  2009 , 2011 ) .",
    "the majority of gcs can be treated as point sources in our _ hst",
    "_  images since the mean half - light radius of typical gcs in early - type galaxies , @xmath41  pc ( jordn et  al .  2005 , 2009 ;",
    "masters et  al .",
    "2010 ) , corresponds to @xmath160006 at 100  mpc .",
    "we therefore required candidate gcs to be compact .",
    "the sextractor `` stellarity index '' values class_star  for all detected objects in f814w are plotted against the total magnitudes in the bottom left panel of figure  [ fig : selection ] . the objects with @xmath42 were classified as point - like sources , and thus possible gcs in coma . since the class_star  parameter is unreliable for the fainter objects , we also adopted additional criteria , based on the measured fwhm and concentration index @xmath43 , to select faint point - like sources .",
    "the @xmath43 concentration index was introduced by peng et  al .",
    "( 2011 ) in order to select likely gc candidates in coma ; it is defined as the difference between magnitudes measured in apertures with diameters of 4  pix and 10  pix .",
    "these additional selection criteria are graphically indicated in the right panels of figure  [ fig : selection ] , where it is clear that a large fraction of the detected sources follow tight loci around a fwhm  of 2  pix and a @xmath43 value of 0.4  mag .",
    "we can thus summarize our initial ( i.e. , from the acs f814w band , prior to any color cuts ) gc candidate selection criteria as follows : @xmath44 , @xmath45  pix ( with 005  pix@xmath10 ) , and @xmath46  mag .",
    "we adopted a relatively broad cut in @xmath43 in order to include gc candidates that are more extended than typical gcs .",
    "however , using the above combination of criteria ensures that we select robustly characterized compact sources as gc candidates . in figure",
    "[ fig : candidates ] ( left panel ) , we plot the locations in the acs f814w image of the 6303 gc candidates selected solely from the f814w photometric data with magnitudes in the range @xmath47  mag . these f814w gc candidates are widely distributed around the central cd galaxy ngc4874 , with localized concentrations around several of the surrounding cluster galaxies .    in this work",
    ", we also analyze the color properties of the gc candidates , and for this analysis we impose additional criteria to reject objects that are likely to be contaminants based on their color . in matching the f814w - selected candidates with the acs f475w object catalog , we imposed a broad color cut of @xmath48  mag ( e.g. , peng et al .",
    "2011 ) for the gc candidates .",
    "we plot in the central panel of figure  [ fig : candidates ] the 4612 gc candidates from the left panel that have colors within this range and color uncertainties less than 0.2  mag . in matching the f814w candidates to the wfc3/f160w catalog",

    "note that the paucity of matched f814w+f160w gc candidates near the galaxy ngc4873 ( labeled in figure  [ fig : imgf814w ] ) occurs because this galaxy is off the edge of the wfc3/ir field of view ( see figure  [ fig : imgf160w ] ) and was not cleanly subtracted by isophotal modeling ; thus , we did not obtain reliable f160w photometry for objects in its immediate vicinity .",

    "thus , the slope is more than a factor of three steeper when fitted as a function of the acsccs colors .",
    "this is understandable in light of the larger measurement errors for those colors .",
    "since the vast majority of these objects are gcs , which intrinsically define a fairly narrow color range @xmath65  mag , the scattering of the colors outside this color range primarily results from photometric errors , which are larger for the shallower acsccs measurements ; thus , this error - induced slope is larger when plotted as a function of the acsccs colors .",
    "we find that we can reproduce the slopes and scatters in figure  [ fig : acsccsgicolor ] if we assume gaussian errors with @xmath66  mag for our color measurements and @xmath67  mag the acsccs colors . for comparison , the median estimated color errors in the two catalogs are 0.063  mag and 0.098  mag , respectively .",
    "this suggests that our quoted errors may be slightly overestimated and the acsccs color errors slightly underestimated , but only by about 10% in each case .",
    "we conclude that our measurements agree well with the acsccs photometry from peng et  al .",
    "the much greater exposure time of our @xmath1  imaging allows us to reach about 1  mag fainter in this bandpass , while our @xmath5  color errors for gc candidates are approximately a factor of two smaller than for the acsccs data .",

    "as discussed in the introduction , gc systems of massive galaxies generally follow bimodal distributions in optical color",

    "2006 ; mieske et  al .  2006 , 2010 ;",
    "strader et  al .",
    "2006 ; harris 2009 ) , possibly indicating an increasing mean metallicity with gc luminosity .",
    "this effect , known alternately as the gc color - magnitude relation , mass - metallicity relation , or informally as `` the blue tilt '' ( a `` tilt '' of the blue peak towards a redder mean color at bright magnitudes ) is most generally believed to be a consequence of self - enrichment within the most massive gcs ( e.g. , bailin & harris 2009 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : cmd ] displays the color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) for gc candidates in ngc4874 in both the optical @xmath5  ( left panel ) and optical - nir @xmath4  ( right panel ) colors .",
    "we have marked in these panels the objects , included in our gc selection , that are spectroscopically confirmed ( red squares ) or possible ( blue triangles ) ultra - compact dwarfs ( ucds ) from the study of chiboucas et  al .",
    "( 2011 ) . in this case , ucds are defined simply as compact stellar systems with colors similar to gcs and absolute @xmath68 magnitude @xmath69  mag . because of the larger acs / wfc field , there are six of these objects in the optical cmd of the left panel , but four in the right panel ( in both cases , two of the ucds are uncertain coma members based on their spectra ) .",

    "although there are more objects in the left panel , and the ridge - line of the blue gc component is also much more distinct in the @xmath5  color , overall the cmds appear fairly similar over a range of 5  mag in luminosity , with an overall tilt towards redder colors at the brightest magnitudes where objects tend to be classified as ucds .        in order to quantify the degree of `` blue tilt '' in ngc4874 , we binned the gc candidates by magnitude and applied the gaussian mixture modeling ( gmm ) code of muratov & gnedin ( 2010 ) to each bin",

    "linear fits to the red and blue peak positions for bins brighter than this magnitude are shown by the solid black lines , defined by the following relations : @xmath74 the error bars here reflect the statistical uncertainties in the parameters from the linear fits .",

    "the shallower slope over the wider magnitude range reflects the nonlinearity of the color - magnitude tilt ( e.g. , harris 2009 ; mieske et  al .",

    "the large @xmath155  for the blue gc distribution is likely related to the very extended , mainly blue igc population in coma ( peng et  al .",

    "the gcs at larger radii within these galaxies are overwhelmingly blue .",

    "however , we have also repeated the full two - dimensional analysis using the matched f814w / f475w sample , and the results do not change in any significant way . to characterize the two - dimensional gc distribution , we divided the acs field into two - dimensional grids with various grid sizes : 40 , 50 , 60 , 70 , 80 , 90 , and 100  pix on a side ( recall the scale is 005  pix@xmath10 for our acs imaging ) and calculated the number density of gcs within each grid cell .",

    "this translates to semi - major and semi - minor axes of 4.0 and 3.2  kpc , respectively .    for the gcs with @xmath196  mag ,",
    "9 of the 11 inside the green ellipse lie to one side of the minor axis ; the probability of this occurring by chance is 6.5% , based on monte carlo tests .",

    "it is evident from figure  [ fig : dwarfgal ] that the outermost galaxy isophote is also offset slightly ( centroid shift of 04 ) in the same direction as the gcs .",
    "we can estimate the size of the gc population in sdssj125935 from the @xmath202 gc candidates ( the error is based on poisson statistics ) with @xmath200  mag within the blue ellipse in figure  [ fig : dwarfgal ] .",

    "the difference is @xmath204 , which represents the number of gcs associated with sdssj125935 brighter than the gclf turnover . for the total population , assuming a symmetric gclf , we double this number to obtain @xmath205  gcs .",
    "to estimate the specific frequency @xmath206 ( number per unit @xmath207 luminosity ; harris & van den bergh 1981 ) , we measure the galaxy magnitude within the same elliptical aperture for consistency and find @xmath208 mag .",

    "both of these values are on the ab system and are corrected for galactic extinction . using empirical transformations from blakeslee et al .",

    "remarkably , sdssj125935 has a heliocentric radial velocity of @xmath215  km  s@xmath10 , measured by biviano et  al .",
    "this is nearly 3000  km  s@xmath10  less than the velocity of @xmath216  km  s@xmath10for ngc4874 ( trager et al .",
    "according to colless & dunn ( 1996 ) , the main component of the coma cluster centered on ngc4874 has a mean velocity @xmath217  km  s@xmath10  and line - of - sight velocity dispersion @xmath218  km  s@xmath10 .",
    "thus , sdssj125935 has a relative velocity of @xmath219  km  s@xmath10  with respective to the cluster mean , or @xmath220 .",
    "numerical simulations indicate that des at such small clustercentric radii and high relative velocities are likely to be on their first infall into the cluster core ( smith et  al .",
    "2013 , 2015 ) .",
    "the same simulations show that dwarfs that pass through the cluster centers can lose a large fraction , even the majority , of their gc systems ( see also aguilar & white 1986 for illustrations of how similar encounters can result in asymmetric distributions of gc - like test masses ) .",
    "we suggest that sdssj125935 is a dwarf elliptical with a relatively rich gc system , similar to some des in virgo , that has recently fallen at high velocity into the core of the coma cluster and is undergoing stripping of its gc system .",
    "unfortunately , it is presently unfeasible to measure spectroscopic velocities for the surrounding point sources to determine what fraction belong to sdssj125935 .",
    "this would be another interesting system for detailed dynamical modeling .",
    "we have studied the rich gc system of ngc4874 , the cd galaxy in the core of the coma cluster of galaxies , using optical _ hst _  @xmath0  and @xmath1  imaging from the acs / wfc and near - ir @xmath2  imaging from wfc3/ir .",
    "the gc system of ngc4874 and the surrounding coma core was previously studied in @xmath0  and @xmath1  as part of the acsccs ( peng et  al .",
    "2011 ) , and we find excellent photometric agreement with that study , but the exposure time of our @xmath1  observations is more than seven  times that of the acsccs imaging , giving a limiting magnitude more than a magnitude fainter in this bandpass . because we added the acsccs @xmath0  observations to our own , the stacked @xmath0  image has a factor of two more exposure time than the acsccs in the overlap region ; tests show that our @xmath5  color measurements have a factor of two smaller errors than those from the acsccs .",
    "in addition , we include new deep f160w observations , with an exposure time slightly longer than that of @xmath1 , over the smaller field of the wfc3/ir .    because the @xmath4  color for old stellar populations measures red giant branch temperature",
    ", it should be sensitive mainly to metallicity , while @xmath5  also depends on horizontal branch morphology and the location of the main sequence turnoff .",
    "over most of the luminosity range probed by our data , there exists clear bimodality in the distribution of @xmath5  colors of our selected gc candidates .",
    "this optical bimodality can be traced at least to @xmath221  mag , corresponding to @xmath93  mag at the distance of coma , or @xmath222  mag for typical gcs . from a gaussian mixture modeling analysis as a function of magnitude",
    ", we find that at the brightest magnitudes , the blue peak exhibits a very strong `` tilt '' towards redder colors , with a slope @xmath223 for @xmath73  mag .",
    "based on the empirical calibration of metallicity as a function of photometric color from the acs virgo cluster survey , this corresponds to a very steep mass - metallicity scaling of @xmath7 at these highest masses .",
    "the gmm analysis for the @xmath4  color distribution is generally less robust than for @xmath5 , especially when the sample is further broken down by magnitude .",
    "we therefore instead examined the variation in the overall mean @xmath4  color in the same magnitude range as for @xmath5 .",
    "again for @xmath73  mag , we find a steep slope in the mean @xmath4  color of @xmath224 .",
    "although there is no empirical relation between @xmath4  and metallicity for gcs , the linear approximation to the relation between @xmath4  and @xmath5  gives , which again implies @xmath102 .",
    "thus , the mean metallicity scaling derived from the full @xmath4  color range is the same as that found from the blue component of the @xmath5  color distribution .",
    "however , the color - magnitude tilt is not a simple linear relation , and if we extend the linear fit another magnitude fainter to @xmath221  mag , then the best - fit slopes are roughly a factor of three shallower , giving scalings of @xmath94 , consistent with the typical scaling found by mieske et  al .",
    "( 2010 ) over a similar mass range .    as a consequence of the tilted color - magnitude relations , the color distributions change as a function of magnitude .",
    "both the @xmath5  and @xmath4  distributions appear broad and red , with no evidence for multiple peaks for the brightest gcs at @xmath225  mag .",
    "fainter than this , @xmath5  is clearly bimodal , with the prominence of the red peak decreasing at progressively fainter magnitudes .",
    "the bimodality is less evident in @xmath4 , but the same general trend occurs , with the histogram transitioning from a redward tilt to being skewed towards the blue at fainter magnitudes . because of the blue tilt at bright magnitudes and increased measurement error at faint magnitudes , the bimodality is most evident for @xmath226  mag , and we have compared the gmm bimodal decompositions for @xmath5  and @xmath4  for the identical sample of gc candidates over this magnitude range . once the four bluest objects in @xmath4  are excluded , the red : blue decompositions are consistent , with red fractions @xmath119 of @xmath227 for @xmath5  and @xmath228 for @xmath4 .",
    "while the separation of the peaks in units of the peak dispersion is very clear in @xmath5  with @xmath229 , it is less clear in @xmath4  with @xmath230 , even though the separation in magnitudes is essentially identical .",
    "the reason for this is that the blue peak is much narrower in @xmath5 , with a dispersion @xmath231  mag , compared to @xmath232  mag for @xmath4 , a difference of nearly 50% . for the red peaks , the dispersions are @xmath233  mag and @xmath234  mag for @xmath5  and @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "previous studies of optical gc color distributions ( e.g. , peng et  al .  2006 , 2009 ;",
    "harris et  al .",
    "2016 ) also found that the blue peak was significantly narrower than the red peak ; however , peng et  al .",
    "( 2006 ) pointed out that the dispersion in @xmath22 $ ]  was actually larger for the blue peak because of the steeper variation in metallicity with color for the blue component of the gcs .",
    "the differences in the blue and red color dispersions for @xmath5  as compared to @xmath4  suggests that the colors follow different color - metallicity relations , despite their nearly identical total range in color .",
    "in particular , the metallicity slopes at blue and red colors must be more similar ( i.e. , weaker nonlinearity ) for @xmath4  than for @xmath5 .",
    "consistent with this , we find that the variation in @xmath4  with @xmath5  is nonlinear , with an inflected shape that can be described well by a cubic polynomial .",
    "we have compared the radial distributions of the blue and red gcs over the wider acs field of view .",
    "consistent with previous studies , we find that the blue gcs follow a more spatially extended radial profile than the red gcs .",
    "interestingly , for this field located in the dense central region of the rich coma cluster of galaxies , the broader extent of the blue gcs is at least partially the result of the gcs associated with the fainter neighboring early - type cluster galaxies , whose gc systems are predominantly blue , especially at large galactocentric radii .",
    "this is consistent with the view that a significant fraction of the blue gcs in the halos of massive galaxies are added through the accretion or stripping of lower luminosity satellite galaxies .",
    "curiously , the center of the spatial distribution of the gcs in this field is offset by @xmath8  kpc from the center of ngc4874 itself .",
    "this offset does not appear to result from the superposition of the gc population of any neighboring galaxy , but it is likely the signature of past dynamical interaction .",

    "although ngc4872 does not have a significant gc population of its own , the 4  kpc displacement in the centroid of the ngc4874 gc system lies along the line towards ngc4872 .",
    "we have also discussed the asymmetry of the gc system of the de galaxy sdssj125935 , which is projected 42  kpc from ngc4874 , but has a relative velocity of @xmath235  km  s@xmath10  with respect to the cd , and @xmath236  km  s@xmath10  with respect to the cluster mean .",

    "the likelihood of the asymmetry in its gcs occurring by chance is @xmath190% .",
    "we suggest that this de is on an initial high - velocity infall into the cluster core and its gc system is in the process of being stripped .",
    "interestingly , based on stellar absorption line indices , trager et  al .",
    "( 2008 ) concluded that ngc4874 and neighboring early - type galaxies showed evidence for an intermediate - age stellar population component , which would imply a significant star formation event several billion years  ago . for now , it remains a matter of speculation whether this proposed star formation event in the relatively recent past is associated with the spatial offset of the ngc4874 gcs .",
    "it is also unknown whether or not such an event may have produced any significant population of intermediate - age gcs .",
    "if so , one would expect the color - metallicity and color - color relations in this field to differ from those in massive galaxies with exclusively old gc populations , as predicted from stellar population models ( yoon & chung 2009 ) .",
    "usher et  al .",
    "( 2015 ) have shown that the color - metallicity relations do indeed vary among early - type galaxies , and that this variation appears to correlate with galaxy luminosity and color ; further work is needed to understand the detailed causes of these variations .",
    "we are currently carrying out an optical - nir photometric study of gcs in a much larger set of 16 early - type galaxies in the fornax and virgo clusters by cross - matching our _ hst _  wfc3/ir data ( jensen et  al .",
    "2015 ) with the published f475w and f850lp catalogs from the acs fornax and virgo cluster surveys ( jordn et  al .  2009 , 2015 ) .",
    "because these galaxies cover a large range in luminosity and color , this sample will shed light on whether optical / nir color - color relations show variations with galaxy type similar to those found by usher et  al .",
    "( 2015 ) for the relation between optical color and metallicity estimated from the cat index , as well as illuminating differences in the ways that different broadband colors trace the underlying metallicity . unfortunately ,",
    "existing samples of spectroscopically estimated metallicities for massive early - type galaxies are of inhomogeneous quality , tend to be based on a small number of metal absorption line indices , and often have large uncertainties in excess of @xmath237  dex .",
    "a large sample of uniformly high - quality spectroscopic metallicities ( @xmath238}}}\\sim0.1 $ ] dex ) and ages determined over a broad spectral range for hundreds of gcs spanning the full color range in a nearby cd galaxy ( which likely combines gcs from a diverse mix of other cluster galaxies ) would be an invaluable resource for the community .",
    "such a sample would allow us to calibrate empirically the detailed forms of the color - metallicity relations from the uv to the nir , and thus constrain the enrichment histories of more distant galaxies from photometric studies alone ; it would also enable crucial tests of the stellar population models",
    ". the evolutionary histories of massive galaxies and their surrounding environments are encoded in the properties of the ancient systems of gcs that surround them ; decoding these histories remains a major ongoing archaeological effort in extragalactic astronomy .",
    "support for this work was provided by the national research foundation of korea to the center for galaxy evolution research ( cger ) .",
    "thanks the national research council of canada s herzberg astronomy & astrophysics for hospitality during several visits .",
    "thanks the cger at yonsei university for hospitality on numerous occasions .",
    "we thank pat  ct , ruben sanchez - janssen , laura sales , and rory smith for helpful conversations .",
