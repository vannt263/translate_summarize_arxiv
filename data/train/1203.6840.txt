    "spectroscopic measurements of the helium atom have presently reached the level of accuracy at which they are sensitive to uncertainties of fundamental constants and the nuclear effects .",
    "this fact can be utilized for improving our knowledge on fundamental constants and nuclear parameters .",
    "a recent example is the independent determination of the fine structure constant @xmath3 @xcite made by comparison of the theoretical prediction and the experimental results for the @xmath4he fine structure .",
    "good agreement of the obtained value of @xmath3 with the more precise determinations @xcite provided a highly sensitive test of consistency of different theories across a wide range of energy scales .",
    "recent optical measurements in @xmath1he @xcite and @xmath4he @xcite achieved the relative precision of about @xmath5 and thus became sensitive to the uncertainties of the rydberg constant and the nuclear charge radius .",
    "these experiments created a possibility for the spectroscopic determination of the nuclear charge radii of @xmath1he and @xmath4he , with a significantly higher accuracy than can be reached by the electron scattering methods @xcite .",
    "such determination is of particular interest now , in view of the discrepancy for the proton charge radius observed in the muonic hydrogen experiment @xcite and the proposed follow - up experiment on the muonic helium @xcite .",
    "realization of this project requires progress in theory , namely a complete calculation of the @xmath6 corrections to the energy levels .",
    "such calculation is difficult but probably feasible , at least for the low - lying triplet states .",
    "while the present theory is not accurate enough to provide the nuclear charge radii of @xmath1he and @xmath4he separately , it can provide their difference @xmath7 , as the isotope shift is considerably simpler to calculate than the energy levels .",
    "two such determinations have recently been reported by experiments of the amsterdam @xcite and the florence @xcite groups , their results being in disagreement of four standard deviations .",
    "there was also the older spectroscopic value of @xmath7 by shiner _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , which relied on the theory of the hyperfine splitting available at that time .    the main goal of the present investigation is to calculate the combined fine and hyperfine structure of the @xmath0 levels of @xmath1he with the complete treatment of the @xmath2 corrections .",
    "the results obtained represent an order - of - magnitude improvement over the previous theory @xcite and are in good agreement with the experimental data available @xcite .",
    "the improved theory allows us to make a reevaluation of the @xmath7 determination by shiner _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , in reasonable agreement with the florence result @xcite .",
    "we also update the previous results for the hyperfine splitting of the @xmath8 state of @xmath1he @xcite , making its treatment fully consistent with that of the @xmath0 states .",
    "the @xmath0 energy level in @xmath9 is split by the hyperfine and fine structure effects .",
    "the hyperfine splitting is induced by the interaction between the dipole magnetic moment of the nucleus and that of the electrons , whereas the fine structure is due to the interaction between the electron spin and the electron orbital angular momentum . for heavy atoms , it is common that the hyperfine splitting ( being suppressed by the electron - to - proton mass ratio ) is much smaller than the fine structure splitting , and so the hyperfine and fine structure effects can be investigated separately . for the @xmath0 states of @xmath9 , however , both effects are of the same order of magnitude and thus should be calculated together .",
    "the general method of calculation of the combined fine and hyperfine structure is the nonrelativistic perturbation theory for quasidegenerate states .",
    "the active space of ( strongly interacting ) quasidegenerate states is defined as @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the total angular momentum of the atomic state and @xmath12 , 1 , 2 is the electronic angular momentum . in the case of @xmath9 , the nuclear spin @xmath13 , so @xmath14 and the active space consists of five levels .",
    "note that , unlike in previous studies @xcite , we do not include the @xmath15 state in the active space , as its mixing with the @xmath0 levels is relatively weak .",
    "the contribution of this state is accounted for by the standard perturbation theory for non - degenerate states .",
    "the energies of the @xmath10 states are the eigenvalues of the @xmath16 matrix of the effective hamiltonian @xmath17 , whose elements are @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the projection of the total angular momentum @xmath11 .",
    "( since the energies do not depend on @xmath19 , it can be fixed arbitrary . ) in practical calculations , it is convenient to consider the shifts of the individual @xmath10 levels with respect to the @xmath0 centroid . in other words , we require that @xmath20 in this case , all effects that do not depend on the nuclear and/or electron spin do not contribute and can be omitted in the calculations .",
    "the matrix elements of the effective hamiltonian ( [ e1 ] ) are obtained in this work by expansion in terms of the fine structure constant @xmath3 , @xmath21\\rangle    \\nonumber \\\\ & +   \\langle h_{\\rm hfs}^{(4)}\\,\\frac{1}{(e - h)'}\\,h_{\\rm hfs}^{(4)}\\rangle + \\langle h_{\\rm nucl\\ & ho } \\rangle\\ , , \\label{01}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath22 is the effective operator responsible for the fine - structure splitting in the absence of the nuclear spin and the other terms are the nuclear - spin - dependent contributions .",
    "@xmath23 is the leading hyperfine hamiltonian with the recoil and anomalous magnetic moment additions ; it is of nominal order @xmath24 and contains parts of higher - order contributions .",
    "@xmath25 is the effective hamiltonian of order @xmath2 and is derived in the present work .",
    "the next two terms in eq .",
    "( [ 01 ] ) are the second - order corrections that also contribute to order @xmath2 .",
    "@xmath26 is @xmath23 without the recoil and anomalous magnetic moment additions , @xmath27 is the effective hamiltonian responsible for the leading fine - structure splitting of order @xmath24 , and @xmath28 is the effective hamiltonian responsible for spin independent effects of order @xmath24 .",
    "finally , @xmath29 represents the nuclear effects and the higher - order @xmath30 qed corrections proportional to the @xmath31 function at the origin .",
    "this part can not be accurately calculated at present , because of insufficient theoretical knowledge of the nuclear structure . it will be obtained from the experiment on the ground - state hyperfine splitting in @xmath9 .    in order to facilitate the evaluation of the matrix elements in eq .",
    "( [ 01 ] ) , it is convenient to factorize out their dependence on the nuclear degrees of freedom @xmath11 and @xmath19 and on the electronic angular momentum @xmath32 .",
    "it can be achieved by observing that any operator contributing to eq .",
    "( [ 01 ] ) can be represented in terms of six basic angular - momentum operators : @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 , where the second - order tensors are defined by @xmath39 and the summation over the repeated indices is assumed . since the nuclear spin of helion @xmath40 , there are no operators quadratic in @xmath41 .",
