    "electronic transport in weakly disordered metals is successfully described by the boltzmann theory , in which electrons are treated as effectively classical particles moving freely between scattering events .",
    "the wave nature of electrons gives rise to a number of corrections to transport properties , such as the weak localization correction,@xcite the altshuler - aronov interaction correction,@xcite or the universal conductance fluctuations.@xcite weak localization results from the constructive interference of electrons propagating along time - reversed paths.@xcite the physical intuition behind the interaction correction is constructive interference of electron trajectories which are scattered on impurities and friedel oscillations of the electron density.@xcite these quantum corrections become increasingly important as the temperature is lowered , the effective dimensionality of the sample is reduced , or as the disorder level is increased .",
    "they have a distinctive and universal dependence on external parameters , such as temperature or magnetic field , which makes them identifiable in experiments .",
    "in particular , the two quantum corrections to the conductivity , weak localization and the altshuler - aronov correction , can be distinguished by application of a magnetic field , since weak localization is suppressed by already a very small magnetic field , whereas the altshuler - aronov correction is not .",
    "a `` classical analog '' of a disordered metal is realized in high - mobility semiconductor structures with randomly placed large antidots.@xcite the absence of impurities ensures that electrons move ballistically between reflections off the antidots .",
    "the reason why these systems are referred to as classical is that the size of the antidots @xmath3 is much larger than the fermi wavelength @xmath4 . as a result , not only the electron s motion through the two - dimensional electron gas , but also the reflection off an antidot",
    "is described by classical mechanics .",
    "( in contrast , in a disordered metal , the size of impurities is comparable to @xmath4 , so that the scattering event is strongly diffractive . ) for an irregular arrangement of antidots , the classical dynamics is chaotic .",
    "nearby trajectories separate exponentially in time , the exponential separation being characterized by the lyapunov coefficient @xmath5 .",
    "the chaotic dynamics is essential for the existence of quantum corrections in this system , as it magnifies the quantum uncertainty of even a minimal wavepacket up to classical dimensions within the short time @xmath6 thus transforming the classical dynamics into quantum - diffractive dynamics on time scales larger than @xmath1.@xcite the time @xmath1 is known as the `` ehrenfest time '' .",
    "since wave effects are not operative for times shorter than @xmath1  electrons essentially move along classical trajectories up to the ehrenfest time  , the ehrenfest time serves as a short - time threshold for the duration of the trajectories contributing to the quantum corrections in an antidot array . for weak localization",
    ", it was found that the correction to the conductivity is exponentially suppressed if @xmath1 is larger than the dwell time @xmath7 , the typical time to be transmitted through the system , or the dephasing time @xmath8.@xcite in contrast , other quantum corrections , such as the universal conductance fluctuations , remain finite if @xmath9.@xcite    the goal of this article is to present a theory of the ehrenfest - time - dependence of the altshuler - aronov correction @xmath0 .",
    "our analysis significantly extends a previous calculation by kupferschmidt and one of the authors,@xcite which studied the @xmath1 dependence of the interaction correction to the conductance of a ballistic double quantum dot and found that @xmath0 is strongly suppressed if @xmath1 exceeds the dwell time @xmath7 or the inverse temperature @xmath10 .",
    "the double quantum dot studied in ref .",
    "is the simplest system with nonzero altshuler - aronov correction to the conductance , and is characterized by a long - range interaction , which is spatially homogeneous within each dot .",
    "the theory presented here is valid for both short - range and long - range interactions and can be applied to any geometry in which the classical electron dynamics is chaotic  although we will focus our discussion on the case of an antidot array . for the general case considered here we confirm the suppression of @xmath0 for @xmath11 and we calculate the precise functional dependence of @xmath0 on @xmath7 and @xmath12 for finite ehrenfest time .",
    "the explicit dependence on temperature is characteristic for the interaction correction , which has its origin in virtual processes with an energy transfer larger than temperature .",
    "our calculation makes use of a semiclassical formalism that starts from the saddle - point approximation around classical trajectories for the single - particle green function . in this way",
    ", the conductance in the absence of electron - electron interactions is written as a double sum over classical trajectories that connect source and drain reservoirs.@xcite weak localization and other quantum corrections to the conductance then follow from special configurations of trajectories , in which the two trajectories in the summation are piecewise paired , and proceed through `` crossings '' at points where the pairing is changed.@xcite in the language of diagrammatic perturbation theory , segments where the trajectories are paired correspond to diffusons or cooperons , whereas the crossings correspond to hikami boxes . the application to interacting electrons requires a modification of the formalism , which will be described in detail below .",
    "our analysis applies to a `` ballistic '' conductor , where the label `` ballistic '' is meant to specify that the electrons move along well - defined classical trajectories . in the literature",
    ", `` ballistic '' sometimes refers to a different limit , and several calculations of the interaction correction to the conductance have been reported for such `` ballistic limits '' . whereas the original work of altshuler and aronov@xcite addressed a disordered metal with short - range scatterers in the diffusive regime @xmath13 , the theory was generalized to account for the effects of higher temperatures @xmath14 , a regime referred to as `` ballistic''.@xcite the case of a smooth disorder potential , in which scattering is predominantly forward ,",
    "was considered in ref .  .",
    "another type of system , where interaction corrections appear , are networks of capacitively coupled ballistic quantum dots,@xcite where , however , ehrenfest - time - related phenomena can be neglected as long as @xmath1 is much smaller than the dwell time in a single quantum dot .",

    "we would like to emphasize that we kept here only those diagrams for which one retarded and one advanced green function are connected to each current vertex .",

    "although the structure of the calculation for conductance or conductivity considerably differs , the final results for these quantities are related by a geometrical factor only . in two dimensions , for a rectangular sample , one has @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the width of the system .",

    "the diffuson in turn is long - ranged , and hence needed to describe propagation from one lead to the other , as required for the conductance .",
    "we also note that the calculation of the conductance as it is outlined here is similar to the calculation of the density - density correlation functions .",
