    "<S> a theory of dynamical control by modulation for optimal decoherence reduction is developed . </S>",
    "<S> it is based on the non - markovian euler - lagrange equation for the energy - constrained field that minimizes the average dephasing rate of a qubit for any given dephasing spectrum .    _ </S>",
    "<S> introduction_. quantum information processing ( qip ) harbors enormous unleashed potential in the form of efficient algorithms for classically intractable tasks and unconditionally secure cryptography @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> perhaps the largest hurdle on the way to a realization of this potential is the problem of decoherence , which results when a quantum system , such as a quantum computer , interacts with an uncontrollable environment or bath @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> decoherence reduces the information processing capabilities of quantum computers to the point where they can be efficiently simulated on a classical computer . in spite of dramatic progress in the form of a theory of fault tolerant quantum error correction ( qec ) @xcite , finding methods for overcoming decoherence that are both efficient and practical remains an important challenge . </S>",
    "<S> an alternative to qec that is substantially less resource - intensive is dynamical decoupling ( dd ) @xcite . in dd one applies a succession of short and strong pulses to the system , designed to stroboscopically decouple it from the environment . </S>",
    "<S> this can significantly slow down decoherence , though not halt it completely , since unlike qec , dd does not contain an entropy removal mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> similar in spirit to dd ( in the sense of being feedback - free ) , but more general , is the method we term here dynamical control by modulation(dcm ) , wherein one may apply to the system a sequence of arbitrarily - shaped pulses whose duration may vary anywhere from the stroboscopic limit to that of continuous dynamical modulation @xcite . in the dcm approach , the decoherence rate is governed by a universal expression , in the form of an overlap between the bath - response and modulation spectra , subject to finite spectral bandwidth and amplitude constraints .    </S>",
    "<S> neither dd @xcite nor dcm @xcite studies have so far gone beyond particular schemes for suppression of decoherence . </S>",
    "<S> what is lacking is a systematic theory for finding the _ optimal modulation _ for any given decoherence process . </S>",
    "<S> here we apply variational principles to the dcm approach in order to address this problem . </S>",
    "<S> we derive an equation for the _ optimal , energy - constrained control by modulation _ ( odcm ) that minimizes dephasing , for any given dephasing spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> we numerically solve this equation , and compare the optimal modulation to energy - constrained dd pulses . </S>",
    "<S> we show that odcm always outperforms dd when subjected to the same energy constraint . </S>",
    "<S> we note that ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite developed an optimal dd pulse sequence for the diagonal spin - boson model of pure dephasing , but without an energy constraint , i.e. , assuming zero - width pulses . </S>",

    "<S> the optimal modulation is trivially similar to the one of the resonant spectrum , with a shifted energy - constraint @xmath77 . </S>",
