    "solid state coherent system are at the forefront of present day research because of the perception that large scale integration may be combined with new physical properties to yield new paradigms for nanoelectronics .",
    "a concrete example is quantum computation  @xcite with solid state devices , with several proposals  @xcite and few recent experiments  @xcite .",
    "more generally the ability of controlling the dynamics of a complex quantum system would open a wide scenario for both fundamental and applied physics .",
    "controlled dynamics may be achieved if first it is possible to prepare ( write ) and measure ( read ) a set of @xmath1 observables @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "this set defines the basis of the so called _ computational states _ @xmath3 .",
    "if moreover it is possible to tune the hamiltonian of the system , then the dynamics of a generic state @xmath4 may be controlled . in general @xmath5",
    "is a _ superposition _ of computational states and moreover if @xmath6 can not be factorized in individual functions @xmath7 , then @xmath5 is _ entangled",
    "_  @xcite .",
    "quantum algorithms use superpositions to produce constructive interference towards the correct answer and entanglement for the speed up of information processing .",
    "thus certain calculations which are practically impossible on a classical computer could be performed if _ coherence _ could be preserved . coherence usually denotes situations when a well defined relation between the components @xmath6 of the state eq.([eq : state ] ) exists . in our case this simply means that the nanodevice can be described by the pure state eq.([eq : state ] ) , the relation between the @xmath6 being the solution of the schrdinger equation .",
    "loss of coherence is due to the fact that the hilbert space of the device is much larger than the computational space  @xcite .",
    "the _ system _ ( defined by the set @xmath2 ) interacts with the _ environment _ ( defined by all the other observables needed to complete the set )  @xcite .",
    "even a weakly coupled environment may cause _ decoherence _",
    "@xcite , i.e. it may destroy the phase relation between @xmath6 . the system should be described by a density matrix @xmath8 rather than a pure state as eq.([eq : state ] ) .    considering a larger hilbert space",
    "is needed because the nanodevice is a many - body object and @xmath2 is only a small set of collective variables .",
    "decoherence from these `` internal '' sources represents a serious limitation due to the presence of many low energy excitations in the solid state environment .",
    "clever protocols and technological progress may reduce these effects , but even in an idealized situation there is an `` external '' environment of apparata ( for preparation , measurement , tuning of the hamiltonian during time evolution ) which are themselves quantum systems enlarging the overall hilbert space . to appreciate the importance of the external environment , notice that of course we would be happy with a system we can manipulate at will , but to obtain easy tunability we have to open a port to the external world and this determines decoherence .    in this work",
    "we consider the charge - josephson qubit  @xcite .",
    "it is a superconducting island , where the charge @xmath9 can be stored , connected to a circuit via a josephson junction and a capacitance @xmath10 ( fig.[fig : cjqubit]a ) . adding a charge polarizes the surroundings and costs energy , provided by the voltage source @xmath11 .",
    "then @xmath11 may be used to fix @xmath9 to the desired value . on the other",
    "hand josephson tunneling mixes the charge states . under suitable conditions ( charging energy @xmath12 much larger than the josephson coupling @xmath13 and temperatures @xmath14 ) only two charge states are important and the system realizes a qubit with hamiltonian @xmath15 where the eigenstates @xmath16 of @xmath17 represent a well defined extra number @xmath18 of cooper pairs in the island and span the computational space",
    ". superconducting qubits  @xcite are important because they are the only solid state implementations where coherence in a single qubit has been observed in the time domain  @xcite and promising experiments exist for two - qubit systems  @xcite",
    ". problems on decoherence can thus be posed in a realistic perspective .",
    "we will study models of environments which describe decoherence due to fluctuations of the external circuit and to @xmath0 noise produced by charges which may be trapped close to the device ( fig.[fig : cjqubit]b ) .",
    "these have been recognized to be major sources of errors in charge - josephson qubits , because the computational states @xmath19 are coupled to charges moving in the environment .",
    "the system plus environment hamiltonian reads @xmath20 where @xmath21 describes the environment , coupled to the system via the operator @xmath22 , which acts as an extra contribution to the polarization @xmath23 .",
    "since we are interested on measurements on the qubit , the standard road - map is to calculate the reduced density matrix @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the system plus environment density matrix .",
    "equations for @xmath8 can be written in terms of statistical information on the environment , i.e. correlation functions like @xmath26 and system - environment correlations , which makes the problem formidable . in practice",
    "we hope that in order to make predictions we do not really need such a detailed knowledge of the microscopic parameters which define @xmath21 .",
    "this may happen in two remarkable cases , namely if the environment is weakly coupled and fast , and if the environment is modeled by harmonic oscillators .",
    "then all the information needed on the environment is encoded in the power spectrum of the coupling operator @xmath22 @xmath27 roughly speaking if the environment is weakly coupled and fast on the time scales typical of decoherence , then the system is unable to probe it in great detail . if the environment is made of harmonic oscillators all its equilibrium statistical properties can be derived from the power spectrum .",
    "unfortunately this is not enough to describe all the effects of a solid state environment , since low - energy excitations may determine _ memory effects _ and in general specific gates are sensitive to different details of the environment .    to conclude this introduction we notice that although decoherence comes from the entanglement of the system with its environment , the reduction of the amplitude of the coherent signal in specific experiments may often be studied in less fundamental terms .",
    "for instance one may think to the environment as producing a classical stochastic field which couples to the qubit . in this way spontaneous emission",
    "is missed but , apart from that , this may be a useful point of view for practical estimates of the effect of solid state environments .",
    "for a weakly coupled environment the trace on the environmental degrees of freedom can be approximately calculated in several ways , in second order in the interaction  @xcite .",
    "a standard approach leads to the markovian master equation in the basis of the eigenstates of @xmath28  @xcite @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the difference of the energy eigenvalues .",
    "the relaxation tensor @xmath31 depends on combinations of quantities of the kind @xmath32 and may be calculated if the green s function of the environment @xmath33 , or its fourier transform @xmath34 , is known .",
    "read @xmath35 and @xmath36 , for a factorized initial density matrix @xmath37 . the system - environment interaction term for the hamiltonian eq.([eq : syst - env - hamiltonian ] )",
    "reads @xmath38 . ] in deriving this equation it has been assumed that the environment is always at equilibrium and it is fast , i.e. @xmath39 should decay on a time scale @xmath40 which is the smallest scale in the problem .",
    "often the sum in eq.([eq : master ] ) can be restricted to the secular terms ( terms such that @xmath41 ) and the result for the relaxation rate @xmath42 , governing the exponential decay of the populations @xmath43 towards equilibrium , and for the decoherence rate @xmath44 which describes the vanishing of the coherences @xmath45 , is readily found @xmath46{0pt}{6pt } \\qquad ; \\qquad   \\gamma_\\phi = \\gamma_\\phi^{0 } + \\frac{1}{2 } \\ , \\gamma_r = \\frac{1}{2 } \\ , \\cos^2 \\theta \\ ; s(0 ) + \\frac{1}{2 } \\ , \\gamma_r\\ ] ] where @xmath47 is the bare level splitting and @xmath48 is the angle characterizing @xmath49 in the bloch sphere representation . as we will see the major problems in solid state come from the so called adiabatic term @xmath50 , which depends on low frequencies of the environment .",
    "the result eqs.([eq : master - result ] ) suggests that an optimal operation point is @xmath51 and that dephasing only depends on the power spectrum of the environment at the operating frequency @xmath52 .",
    "a typical protocol is depicted in fig.[fig : single - shot]a .      for @xmath53",
    "the system is sensitive to low frequencies of the environment .",
    "this case , usually referred to as `` pure dephasing '' , is special in that the hamiltonian  ( [ eq : syst - env - hamiltonian ] ) commutes with @xmath17 .",
    "the charge in the island is conserved and no relaxation occurs .",
    "however if we prepare the qubit in a superposition of charge states the system will dephase and consequently the coherences will decay ( a typical protocol is depicted in fig.[fig : single - shot]b ) .",
    "if the initial density matrix is factorized , @xmath37 , it is possible to write an exact expression for the coherences only in terms of the environment  @xcite .",
    "@xmath54 where @xmath55 .      in order to apply the above results we now specify a model for the environment which describes fluctuations of the external circuit , modeled by an external impedance @xmath56 ( fig.[fig : cjqubit]b ) . on the classical level",
    "the effect is accounted for by substituting @xmath57 in eq.([eq : qubit - hamiltonian ] ) , where @xmath58 are the classical voltage fluctuations @xmath58 at the impedance .",
    "the phenomenological quantum model is obtained by applying the following rules .",
    "first we substitute @xmath59 in eq.([eq : qubit - hamiltonian ] ) .",
    "then we introduce a set of harmonic oscillators to describe the impedance and to weight quantum fluctuations of @xmath60 @xmath61 which specifies the hamiltonian ( [ eq : syst - env - hamiltonian ] ) .",
    "finally the power spectrum of @xmath60 is identified by the voltage fluctuations at @xmath56 @xmath62 where @xmath63 and to make contact with the standard notation  @xcite we introduced the spectral density of the environment @xmath64 . this allows to identify @xmath65 and to estimate the rates using eq.([eq : master - result ] ) . at the optimal point the quality factor @xmath66 for typical values of the parameters ( we took @xmath67 and @xmath68 is the superconducting quantum of resistence ) , which would allow a single qubit gate to work perfectly .",
    "adiabatic dephasing would lead to an even larger @xmath69 , by a factor @xmath70 .",
    "numerous experiments have shown that the performance of single electron tunneling ( set ) devices strongly suffer from fluctuations of background charges ( bc ) located in the vicinity of the junctions  @xcite .",
    "their behavior can be visualized as a random extra polarization @xmath71 which produces voltage fluctuations at the device .",
    "voltage noise can be measured in set transistors , and it has been observed to have the @xmath0 form up to @xmath72  @xcite .",
    "using experimental data we may identify @xmath73 where @xmath74 is about @xmath75  @xcite and eq.([eq : master - result ] ) at the optimal point leads to a quality factor @xmath76 .",
    "this procedure underlies two questionable assumptions : first , one should extrapolate observed @xmath0 noise up to frequencies @xmath77 , second , one should make the ad hoc assumption that there are nonequilibrium impurity charges at such frequencies , much larger than the temperature noise at high frequencies  @xcite.they were interpreted within a similar `` one photon '' approach wich requires the ad hoc assumption that there are nonequilibrium impurity charges at such frequencies .",
    "this analysis yields the better value @xmath78 but is certainly non conclusive . ] .",
    "apart from this eqs.([eq : master - result ] ) badly fails in estimating @xmath79 which is proportional to the inverse of the small ( and unmeasurable ) low - frequency cut - off @xmath80 of @xmath0 noise . in order to have a more reliable estimate",
    "it has been proposed that one may describe the environment as a set of harmonic oscillators  @xcite . in this case",
    "the exact expression eq.([eq : gamma - pure - dephasin - general ] ) may be evaluated  @xcite , yielding @xmath81 for times @xmath82 , where @xmath83 is the high - frequency cut - off of the @xmath0 noise , @xmath84 is approximated by @xmath85 .",
    "the result is still dependent on @xmath80 in a relevant way : each decade of noise , including noise produced by very slow fluctuators , gives exactly the same contribution to dephasing .",
    "it has been proposed the recipe to use instead an ad hoc effective low - frequency cut - off which gives resonable results , but in order to have a clear picture of what is going on one should take more seriously the discrete character of charge noise .",
    "in particular the main difficulty in treating the @xmath0 environment by the above standard methods is that the large majority of degrees of freedom are much slower than all time scales of the evolution of the system , so they give rise to important _",
    "memory effects_. as a consequence different gates are sensitive to different details of the environment .",
    "in this section we introduce a simple model of an environment which yields @xmath0 noise , which is a suitable set of bistable fluctuators  @xcite . we first consider the fluctuators to be sources of a classical stochastic process , i.e. each fluctuator switches between two configurations with total rate @xmath86 and determines an extra polarization of the qubit given by @xmath87 , where @xmath88 . the total extra polarization , @xmath89 , has power spectrum @xmath90 , where the overline means average on the stochastic processes . the standard assumption  @xcite of a distribution of switching rates @xmath91 for @xmath92 $ ] and zero elsewhere leads to @xmath0 noise , @xmath93 for frequencies @xmath94 $ ] ( @xmath95 is the number of fluctuators per noise decade ) .",
    "already at this level it is clear that the environment presents a large number of slow fluctuators , so memory effects are important .",
    "we introduce a quantum model  @xcite by describing each fluctuator as a localized impurity level connected to a band  @xcite .",
    "the system plus environment hamiltonian reads @xmath96           +   \\sum_{k } \\varepsilon_{ki }   c_{ki}^{\\dagger } c_{ki } \\ , .",

    "this electron may tunnel , with amplitude @xmath101 to a band described by the operators @xmath102 , @xmath103 and the energies @xmath104 .",
    "for simplicity we assume that each localized level is connected to a distinct band .",
    "an important scale is the total switching rate @xmath105 ( @xmath106 is the density of states of the electronic band , @xmath107 ) , which characterizes the classical relaxation regime of each bc .",
    "finally the coupling with the qubit is such that each bc produces a bistable extra bias @xmath108 .",
    "it may be argued that the impurity model introduced here describes impurities in metals , rather than in insulating substrates .",
    "however our aim is to discuss consequences of the discrete nature of the bcs and this is the simplest model embedding this feature .",
    "moreover this model has been introduced and used in ref .",
    "@xcite to successfully explain experiments on charge trapping in systems of small tunnel junctions very similar to the charge - qubit .",
    "our aim is to investigate the effect of the bc environment on the dynamics of the qubit .",
    "the picture which emerges from our analysis is that the contribution of the single bc in dephasing the qubit depends on the ratio @xmath109 . as a consequence ,",
    "we distinguish between two different kinds of bc : the ones with @xmath110 , which we call _ weakly coupled _ and the ones in the other regime , which we call _ strongly coupled_. concerning these latter notice that we are interested to a physical situation where the @xmath108 are so small that the energy scale associated to the total extra bias produced by the set of bcs is much smaller than @xmath111 , so strongly coupled charges means small @xmath86 .",
    "strongly coupled bcs give rise to memory effects and moreover differences of their statistical properties from those of an oscillator environment ( cumulants higher than the second are nonvanishing ) may be relevant  @xcite . as a consequence the results eqs.([eq : master - result ] ) may be inapplicable .",
    "one possibility is to calculate higher orders in the master equation , but even if one assumes that the environment is still modelled by harmonic oscillators , the corrections for @xmath0 spectrum are of the same order of the leading terms  @xcite . here",
    "we follow a different strategy , namely we enlarge the `` system '' which allows to treat more accurately the dynamics of the bcs , at all orders in the couplings @xmath112 . in the modified roadmap we consider _ only _ the continuos electron bands in eq.([eq : hamiltonian - backcharges ] ) as the environment and investigate the reduced dynamics of the system composed by the qubit and the bcs .",
    "we find that weakly coupled charges behaves as a source of gaussian noise , whose effect is fully characterized by the power spectrum @xmath113 . on the other hand , from our quantum mechanical treatment",
    "it emerges that the decoherence due to strongly coupled charges shows pronunced features of their discrete character . in the following",
    "we will specialize our analysis to the two cases @xmath114 .",
    "if the environment is made of a single bc we can implement the new roadmap by solving the master equation eq.([eq : master ] ) for a system composed by the qubit and the bc .",
    "this method is unpractical for a large number @xmath1 of bcs since the number of equations becomes @xmath115 .",
    "so we study the general problem by using the heisenberg equations of motion . for the average values of the qubit observables @xmath116 ,",
    "@xmath117 we obtain ( @xmath118 ) @xmath119 in the rhs averages of new operators which involve also the localized levels and the bands are generated and we can write new equations for them . this procedure could be iterated and we would obtain an infinite chain of equations , but instead at this stage we factorize high order averages , so we are left with a set of @xmath120 equations . in practice",
    "we ignore the cumulants @xmath121 and @xmath122 for @xmath123 and insert the relaxation dynamics for the bcs in the approximated terms .",
    "this method gives accurate results for general values of @xmath124 even if @xmath125 is not very small , as we checked by comparing with numerical evaluation of the reduced density matrix of the qubit with one and two bcs .",
    "results are presented in fig.[figure : equil ] where the time fourier transform of @xmath126 , proportional to the average charge on the island , is shown .",
    "we assumed factorized initial condition for the qubit and the bcs .",
    "we first consider a set of weakly coupled bcs in the range @xmath127\\ ,   e_j$ ] which determine @xmath0 noise in a frequency interval around the operating frequency .",
    "the coupling strengths @xmath108 have been generated uniformly with approximately zero average and with magnitudes chosen in order to yield the amplitude of typical measured spectra  @xcite ( extrapolated at ghz frequencies ) .",
    "these bcs are weakly coupled , and determine a dephasing rate which reproduces the prediction of eq.([eq : master - result ] ) ( fig.[figure : equil ] dotted line @xmath128 ) .",
    "now we add a slower ( and strongly coupled @xmath129 ) bc , in order to extend the @xmath0 spectrum to lower frequencies .",
    "the added bc gives negligible contribution to @xmath130 so according to eq.([eq : master - result ] ) it should not modify @xmath131 .",
    "instead , as shown in fig.[figure : equil]a , we find that the strongly coupled bc alone determines a dephasing rate comparable with that of the weakly coupled bcs .",
    "the overall @xmath131 is more than twice the prediction of eq.([eq : master - result ] ) .",
    "the above result shows that @xmath131 does not depend only on @xmath130 .",
    "moreover we checked that information beyond the full @xmath113 is needed : we considered sets of charges with different @xmath1 and @xmath108 which realize the same power spectrum @xmath113 and we find they yield different values of @xmath131 .",
    "the decoherence is larger if bcs with @xmath132 are present in the set . in summary",
    "these results show that eq.([eq : master - result ] ) _ underestimates _ the effect of strongly coupled bcs and in particular that a finite @xmath131 at the optimal point can be obtained even if the @xmath0 spectrum does not extend up to frequencies @xmath133 .    if we further slow down the added bc we find that @xmath131 increases toward values @xmath134 , the switching rate of the bc .",
    "this indicates that the effect of strongly coupled bcs on decoherence tends to saturate .",
    "we discuss later similar results for the case of pure dephasing , where this conclusion can be made sharp , but we stress here that this is a consequence of the nonlinearity inherent to the discrete nature of the bc environment . in this regime",
    "we observe also effects related to the initial preparation of the strongly coupled bc ( see fig.[figure : equil]b ) .",
    "as we will discuss later we may describe different experimental procedures using different preparations of the environment .",
    "thus we have here a first example of the fact that different measurement protocols should be analized separately as far as dephasing due to bcs is concerned .",
    "in the absence of the tunneling term eq.([eq : hamiltonian - backcharges ] ) is a model for pure dephasing . the analysis can be carried out using the exact result eq.([eq : gamma - pure - dephasin - general ] ) .",
    "we notice that for our model eq.([eq : hamiltonian - backcharges ] ) @xmath135 can be decomposed in a sum of commuting terms each referring to a bc , so if we assume factorized @xmath136 eq.([eq : gamma - pure - dephasin - general ] ) also factorizes @xmath137 in averages referring to a single bc . using a real - time path - integral technique , the general form of @xmath138 in laplace space",
    "is obtained  @xcite @xmath139 where @xmath140 specify the initial conditions for the charges . the kernels @xmath141 and @xmath142",
    "are expressed by formal series expressions in the tunneling amplitudes @xmath143 .",
    "an interesting explicit form of the kernels is obtained in the non interacting blip approximation ( niba )  @xcite , which amounts to approximate the kernels @xmath141 and @xmath144 at lowest order in the tunneling amplitudes @xmath143 .",
    "the result is @xmath145 \\quad.\\ ] ] in order to appreciate the physical meaning of the niba result , we notice that it is also obtained using the heisenberg equations of motion , which yield a closed set of equations provided that the electronic band is assumed in thermal equilibrium .",
    "thus the niba result , besides describing the dynamics of the qubit plus bc at all orders in the couplings @xmath112 , is valid even if the couplings @xmath146 with the bands are not small .",
    "what is possibly missed are details of the dynamics of the bands , which is in total agreement with the phylosophy of the modified roadmap outlined in sec.[sec : model and methods ] .",
    "we now want to apply these results to a set of bcs which produce @xmath0 noise . in order to produce a clear physical picture",
    ", we will consider only the physically relevant limit where the bcs have an incoherent dynamics .",
    "this limit can be formally obtained from the niba result by approximating the kernel @xmath147 , and can be expressed in analytic form @xmath148 where @xmath149 in the framework of the niba this result is valid if @xmath150 , but again its validity is broader .",
    "indeed eq.([offdiag ] ) it may be obtained in different ways , for instance by analizing the system of qubit and bc by a master equation and taking the limit where @xmath100 is the largest scale , or even as the exact result of a model where the coupling operator @xmath151 is substituted by a classical stochastic process @xmath152 which is the sum of random telegraph processes ( see app .",
    "[ sec : stochastic ] ) .",
    "the form of eqs.([offdiag],[alpha ] ) elucidates the different role of weakly and strongly coupled bcs in the decoherence process .",
    "we focus on the long time limit @xmath153 .",
    "dephasing due to each bc comes from the sum of two exponential terms . for extremely weakly coupled charges , @xmath154 , whe have @xmath155 and",
    "only the first term is important , which describes decay of the coherences with a rate @xmath156 \\ , v_j^2/\\gamma_j$ ] .",
    "this is precisely the result of eq.([eq : master - result ] ) for the adiabatic rate @xmath79",
    ". for strongly coupled charges , @xmath157 , each of the two exponentials in eq.([offdiag ] ) expresses roughly the same decay rate @xmath158 , the switching rate of the individual bc , and moreover they come with the same weight .",
    "the individual @xmath159s have large imaginary parts so the main effect of strong coupling with the qubit is not decay but rather an energy shift",
    ". the short time limit , which is more important in actual experiments , will be discussed in the next subsection .",
    "the long time limit allows to draw a simple picture of the effect of a bc : the qubit is practically insensitive to very fast bcs ( @xmath157 ) , which are averaged completely .",
    "the dephasing effect increases as @xmath160 as the bc gets slower but eventually saturates . indeed",
    "a very slow bc ( @xmath157 ) will dephase only when it switches ( effect @xmath161 ) so for most of the time it provides a static extra polarization for the qubit .",
    "based on this picture one could conclude that slow charges could be neglected , however it is not a priori clear if this is a valid choice for the @xmath0 spectrum , where the number of slow charges is large due to the @xmath162 distribution . eq.([offdiag ] ) allows to answer to this question , but we defer this point to section [ sec : single - shot ] and we first discuss in detail other aspects of the result for a single bc .",
    "results for a single bc are concentrated in fig .",
    "we consider eq.([offdiag ] ) for @xmath163 and look at the quantity @xmath164 in fig.[fig5 ] we compare this quantity with the exact result for an oscillator environment , eq.([eq : gamma - pure - dephasing - oscillators ] ) , which is reported as the thick dashed line .",
    "we show the effect of a single bc for various initial conditions and different values of @xmath165 .",
    "weakly coupled charges ( @xmath166 ) give a contribution close to @xmath84 , whereas deviations are observed in the other cases . in particular bcs such that @xmath167 show slower dephasing compared to an oscillator environment with the same @xmath113 , as a manifestation of saturation effects .",

    "on the other hand if we choose @xmath177 , the equilibrium value , @xmath169 decays more rapidly , @xmath178 .",
    "these latter choice of initial conditions corresponds physically to repeated measurements in which we do not control the preparation of the bc so @xmath169 describes both dephasing _ during _ time evolution and the blurring of the total signal of several realizations of the time evolution with slightly different characteristic frequency , a sort of inhomogeneuos broadening .",
    "notice finally that if we use the above equilibrium initial conditions @xmath169 follows @xmath84 for short times , the two curves becoming indistinguishable only if moreover @xmath179 .",

    "we notice finally that for this single shot protocol @xmath169 is roughly given by @xmath84 provided we use @xmath192 as a low frequency cut - off .",

    "we discussed the problem of the information needed to characterize the effect of the environment . for environments which are weakly coupled and fast or environments made of harmonic oscillators",
    "the information needed is entirely contained in the power spectrum of the operator which couples the environment to the system . for a fluctuator environment with @xmath0 spectrum memory effects and higher order moments are important so additional information is needed .",
    "we discussed in detail the remarkable case of pure dephasing where the reduction of the amplitude of the coherent signal is given by correlation functions of the environment alone ( see eq.([eq : gamma - pure - dephasin - general ] ) ) and provided exact results for the fluctuator environment . in this case the additional information of the environment needed depends on the protocol but often reduces to a single parameter .",

    "the relevant scale is instead @xmath237 where @xmath213 is the overall measurement time .",

    "it may be possible that the same sources generate both charge noise and fluctuations of @xmath238 .",
    "this can be accounted for in our model by choosing the `` noise axis '' as the @xmath239 axis .    in this work we have also briefly discussed the possibility of finding optimal operating points for the qubit",
    "this idea has been succesfully implemented in the experiment of ref .",
    "@xcite and consists in operating with external parameters tuned at the points where the energy splittings of the system are less sensitive to fluctuations .",
    "however a slight deviation from the optimal point determines a strong degradation of the performances .",
    "an equivalent point of view is that the system should be tuned at the point where adiabatic dephasing cancels in lowest order , since the effect of a low frequency environment ( in particular the @xmath0 environment ) is minimized .",
    "an explicit example is the recent proposal of implementing a communication protocol with josephson junctions  @xcite .",
    "low - frequency noise can also be minimized by echo techniques , but the flexibility in the implementation of gates is greatly reduced . a possibility is to implement quantum computation using berry phases  @xcite , where the design of gates includes an echo procedure , but a detailed analysis of the effect of @xmath0 noise is still missing .",
    "finally we mention that the sensitivity of coherent devices may be used to investigate high frequency noise  @xcite .",
    "in particular an accurate matching between measured inhomogeneous broadening , echo signal and relaxation may give reliable information on the actual existence of bcs at @xmath240 and on the high - frequency cut - off of the @xmath0 spectrum .",

    "<S> a high degree of quantum coherence is a crucial requirement for the implementation of quantum logic devices . </S>",
    "<S> solid state nanodevices seem particularly promising from the point of view of integrability and flexibility in the design </S>",
    "<S> . however decoherence is a serious limitation , due to the presence of many types low energy excitations in the `` internal '' environment and of `` external '' sources due to the control circuitery . </S>",
    "<S> here we study both kind of dephasing in a special implementation , the charge josephson qubit , however many of our results are applicable to a large class of solid state qubits . </S>",
    "<S> this is the case of @xmath0 noise for which we introduce and study a model of an environment of bistable fluctuatiors . </S>",
    "<S> external sources of noise are analized in terms of a suitable harmonic oscillator environment and the explicit mapping on the spin boson model is presented . </S>",
    "<S> we perform a detailed investigation of various computation procedures ( single shot measurements , repeated measurements ) and discuss the problem of the information needed to characterize the effect of the environment . for a fluctuator environment with @xmath0 spectrum memory effects turn out to be important . </S>",
    "<S> although in general information beyond the power spectrum is needed , in many situations this results in the knowledge of only one more microscopic parameter of the environment . </S>",
    "<S> this allows to determine which degrees of freedom of the environment are effective sources of decoherence in each different physical situation considered . </S>"
