    "the chemical enrichment history of the intracluster medium ( icm ) is arguably the least understood aspect of galaxy cluster evolution . particularly puzzling are the relatively high fe abundance and moderately large @xmath0fe@xmath1 $ ] @xcite .",
    "the former has been interpreted as evidence for large gas outflows from galaxies @xcite , while the latter , in combination with constraints from cluster galaxies , is interpreted as evidence for a non - standard initial mass function ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* although see @xcite for a contrasting result ) .",
    "both of these inferences have a wide ranging impact on a variety of astronomical topics . here",
    "we present evidence that the first argument should be significantly revised , and that the second argument should be revisited .",
    "our proposal is straightforward .",
    "the intracluster stars ( ics ) that we have found without exception in a sample of 24 clusters ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper i ) must chemically pollute the icm via supernovae .",
    "such intergalactic sne have already been observed @xcite .",
    "we evaluate the degree to which the ics plays a role with the simplest modeling we can envision . as the vast literature on this topic demonstrates , there are many variables and unknowns in this type of model .",
    "we will adopt _ plausible _ , often typical , values of the relevant variables and demonstrate that the intracluster stars make a significant , and perhaps dominant , contribution to the enrichment history of the icm .",
    "this study is not intended to be a complete or comprehensive treatment of the ics enrichment of the icm , but it illustrates the likely importance of the ics in the chemical abundance budget of galaxy clusters .",
    "in paper i we present observations of 24 clusters that span a range of velocity dispersions and bautz - morgan types @xcite .",
    "the sample consists of nearby clusters ( @xmath2 ) that contain a dominant brightest cluster galaxy ( bcg ) with a major axis position angle that lies within 45 degrees of the east - west axis ( our drift scan direction ) .",
    "we present details of these unique data and our reduction procedure in paper i.    from modeling the two dimensional optical surface brightness distribution , we conclude in paper i that the bcg light can be divided into two components .",
    "the inner component is similar to normal giant ellipticals in extent , luminosity , and scaling relations .",
    "the outer component is closely related in scale and ellipticity to the distribution of galaxies in the cluster .",
    "we associate the inner component with the bcg and the outer component with the ics . in paper",
    "i , we determine the luminosity of the outer component , which we will use here as a measure of the intracluster stellar content .",
    "standard measurements of bcg light underestimate the contribution of this low surface brightness outer component ( for example , assuming a single @xmath3 surface brightness profile to evaluate the total magnitude leads to a 50% underestimate of the total luminosity of the bcg plus ics ; paper i ) .    for constraints on the properties of the icm",
    ", we have searched the literature for x - ray gas masses @xcite and chemical abundances @xcite .",
    "there are only two clusters in our sample for which such data exist ( table [ tab : obs ] ) .",
    "we have adopted the gas mass inside of @xmath4 , the radius at which the mean mass density exceeds 500 times the cosmological value , as the measure of the gas mass .",
    "we measure the ics luminosity directly only within 300 kpc , but our model fit provides an estimate of the total luminosity .",
    "the mismatched apertures limit the precision with which comparisons can be made , although even if the apertures are matched , the comparison is complicated by flows of material across the aperture during the cluster s evolution .",
    "the gas masses have been rescaled to our adopted cosmology ( @xmath5 km / sec / mpc , @xmath6 and @xmath7 ) , and the observed abundances have been rescaled due to the difference between the older value of the photospheric solar abundance by mass ( 0.0026 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the more recent one that we adopt here ( 0.0017 , * ? ? ?",
    "this conversion increases the canonical fe cluster abundance from 0.3 to 0.46 fe@xmath8 .",
    "this type of study usually relies on analytic models of the enrichment history @xcite , but we choose to model the chemical evolution with the publicly available modeling package , pegase.2 @xcite , which provides estimates of the type i and ii supernovae rates as a function of age for a user - selected star formation history and initial mass function .",
    "we use these models because they also provide luminosities and colors of the resulting stellar population , which we need to scale our predictions for the observed ics population .    to mitigate ambiguity in our results",
    ", we adopt a very simple star formation history ( a single burst of star formation that peaks at @xmath9 and is finished by @xmath10 ) , an initial chemical abundance by mass fraction of 0.004 for the ism ( although adopting values of 0.0001 and 0.08 does not significantly affect the results ) , a standard imf @xcite , and all the default pegase parameters ( such as a binary fraction of 0.5 ) . changing the star formation history so that the peak star formation rate is at @xmath11 3.5 and the star formation",
    "does not cease entirely until @xmath12 decreases the predicted abundances by @xmath13 .",
    "varying the adopted initial chemical abundance only affects aspects of the stellar evolutionary modeling , such as the predicted stellar colors .",
    "we always assume that the icm abundance is zero until we add the contribution from the ics .",
    "[ fig : sne ]    by integrating the rate of sne predicted from the pegase models ( figure [ fig : sne ] ) and adopting fe yields for sne , we obtain the total fe mass ejected over time . for the yields we assume that a type i ejects 0.7@xmath14 of fe per supernova and that a type ii ejects 0.05@xmath14 of fe per supernova .",
    "this yield for a type i is the canonical value adopted by various other studies ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while that for type ii s is the mean value @xcite over the observed range , 0.0016 to 0.26 @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "because type i s dominate the enrichment in our models , the results are fairly robust to decreasing the type ii yield from our adopted value . increasing the type ii yield leads to more pronounced changes .",
    "however , increasing the type ii yield obviously produces a larger total fe mass and therefore is not a conservative approach .",
    "this discussion sidesteps the difficulties others have encountered in reproducing @xmath15/fe@xmath1 $ ] or specific element ratios @xcite .",
    "however , any solution that has been proposed previously , such as non - standard initial mass functions , will also work with our ics scenario , with the added flexibility that now one does not need to fit both the icm and galaxy abundance patterns with the same model . therefore , although we do not pursue the [ @xmath16/fe ] question here , we conclude that it is no more difficult a problem than in the standard models .",
    "future models should be able to take advantage of the wealth of information becoming available on the spatial gradients of these element ratios @xcite .",
    "we present two different calculations that provide quantitative estimates of the importance of the ics .",
    "first , we model clusters as a general population , adopting typical ratios of such quantities as gas mass to stellar mass .",
    "second , we model the only three clusters for which all of the required quantities are measured . in both approaches ,",
    "we combine the pegase supernovae rates with the yields described above to calculate the fe mass that 1 m@xmath8 of initial material produces after 14 gyr ( this 1 m@xmath8 of material results in 0.59 m@xmath8 of stellar mass , including remnants , at the current time ) . in the first type of calculation",
    ", we utilize the ratios of gas mass to galaxy mass in stars ( @xmath17 ) and of ics to total cluster luminosity ( @xmath18 ) , and assume that that the ics and galactic stars have the same m / l ratio , to calculate the ratio of icm gas mass to ics mass .",
    "we then use this ratio , and the calculated fe abundance per solar mass of ics , to calculate an icm fe abundance .",
    "values for @xmath17 vary between @xmath19 to 10 @xcite , although a combination of recent optical work with the sloan digital sky survey @xcite and a large rosat sample @xcite favors the upper end of that range @xcite . in the limited observational work to date , values for @xmath18 range from 0.1 @xcite to 0.2 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* adjusted for the division into two components of abell 1651 from paper i ) . if , as models predict @xcite , the stars in the ics are on average older than those in the galaxies , then our assumption of equal m / l for the ics and galactic stars leads to an underestimate of the relative amount of mass in the ics .",
    "this is therefore a conservative assumption in our determination of the produced fe . instead of adopting specific values for the various ratios , we provide results over the range of plausible values ( figure [ fig : ratios ] ) .",
    "figure [ fig : ratios ] demonstrates that for the ics to chemically enrich the icm to cluster - like values requires both a fairly high @xmath18 and a low @xmath17 relative to the ranges of values explored .",
    "however , to reach a level where the ics contributes significantly to the icm ( @xmath20 fe@xmath8 ) requires values of the two scaling ratios that lie well within the observational ranges @xcite .",
    "furthermore , because m / l is likely to be larger for the ics than for the galaxies ( see above ) , our scaling may underestimate the contribution from the ics by up to a factor of two .",
    "[ fig : ratios ]    the second type of calculation provides a more direct comparison in the few clusters for which the relevant data are available . for two of our clusters , we find corresponding @xmath21 and metallicity measurements in the literature ( table [ tab : obs ] ) .",
    "we scale the fe mass , as calculated from the pegase models and our adopted yields , using the m / l from those models and the total luminosity of the outer component ( paper i ) .",
    "the icm without the contribution of the ics is assumed to have zero metallicity .",
    "the calculated metallicity resulting from the ics contribution is presented in table [ tab : obs ] for comparison .",
    "@xmath22 represents the stellar mass , including remnants , in the intracluster volume .",
    "lrrrrrrrr abell 1651 & 0.0853 & 6.5 & 1.73&@xmath2324.95 & ... & 0.9&0.44&0.22 + abell 1914@xmath24&0.1712&12.9&2.46& ...",
    "&@xmath2324.94&1.8&0.37&0.22 + abell 3112 & 0.0759 & 4.5 & 1.53&@xmath2325.74 & ... & 1.9&0.68&0.66 + [ tab : obs ]    it is unfortunate that only two of our 24 clusters have published values of @xmath21 and fe abundance .",
    "however , for those two clusters , we find that the ics can account for a large fraction of the metals in the icm , and we reproduce the relative rankings of metallicity for the two clusters .",
    "there are numerous adjustments that can be made due to uncertainties in the luminosity of the ics , the region over which @xmath21 and the ics are measured , the adopted yields , the modeling of the sne rates , the star formation history , initial mass function , and so forth . in table [ tab : obs ] we also include results for a cluster observed by @xcite . despite some differences in their definition and measurement of the ics , our model again reproduces a sizable fraction of the icm iron abundance in this cluster .",
    "the purpose of this exercise is primarily to demonstrate that for plausible values of the various parameters , the ics can contribute a significant amount of iron to the icm .",
    "a similar conclusion has been reached using scaling relationships and infrared photometry by @xcite .",
    "a complete model of cluster enrichment must include the contribution from all stars , whether currently in the ics or in galaxies , and must account for the metals both in the icm and in galaxies .",
    "our approach has ignored 1 ) the contribution of metals to the icm from stars currently in galaxies , because we are interested in determining the contribution from the newly measured ics component , and 2 ) the metals currently locked in galaxies , again because we are interested in the connection between the ics and icm . in effect , we have treated the current cluster galaxies as closed box systems and set them aside .",
    "this approach produces a conservative estimate of the metal enrichment of the icm .",
    "it is important to discuss one possible refinement of our chemical enrichment model .",
    "we make no direct assumption about the origin of the ics , which , in simulations , arises from the tidal disruption of cluster galaxies early in the cluster s history @xcite . if these simulations are correct , then the metals in the icm are some combination of the metals already present in those first cluster galaxies and the subsequent evolution of the stars stripped from those galaxies .",
    "so far in this paper , we have discussed only the latter issue .",
    "we now consider the former issue by asking what fraction of the metals in those ics progenitor galaxies enters the icm .",
    "if the parent galaxies of the ics were completely disrupted , then the answer is 100% and our model implicitly includes this possibility .",
    "if some of the parent galaxies survive to the current time , then our calculation overestimates the ics metal contribution to the icm by whatever amount of metals is locked in these galaxies . without knowing when the ics formed and its detailed star formation history",
    ", we can not estimate the magnitude of this effect , but it may be significant .",
    "for example , for a star formation model that peaks sharply at @xmath25 , an age comparable to the mean age of the ics in the simulation by @xcite , about 25% of the fe forms prior to the mean age of the ics stars .",
    "if the stars are stripped from these galaxies shortly thereafter , the galaxies might retain as much as 25% of all the metals that we attribute to the ics .",
    "nevertheless , even if our calculation overestimates the ics metal contribution to the icm by as much as 25% , the ics still contributes between 35% and 75% of the metals in the three clusters that we model in detail ( table 1 ) .",
    "we calculate that the chemical enrichment due to intracluster stars ( ics ) , a ubiquitous population in galaxy clusters ( paper i ) , is a significant component of the chemical enrichment history of the intracluster medium ( icm ) .",
    "furthermore , our model suggests that for at least some clusters the ics could contribute the bulk of the metals in the icm . unlike models of icm enrichment",
    "in which the metals originated in the cluster members we see today , the simplest version of our model has no uncertainty related to the fraction of the processed material from the ics that pollutes the icm .",
    "in fact , once the relevant measurements ( icm mass , icm metallicity , and ics mass ) are made sufficiently precise , our argument could be turned around to place limits on the metal outflow from cluster galaxies .",
    "the ics , and the associated sne , should also be an important factor in the energy budget of the icm ( see @xcite for such calculations relating to the sne within the cluster galaxies and @xcite for the effects of ics sne on large - scale cluster gas dynamics ) .",
    "lastly , table [ tab : obs ] suggests that the factor of @xmath26 2 scatter in abundances among clusters @xcite is related to the balance between the mass of the icm gas and that of the ics .",
    "we speculate that the trend seen in fe abundance versus temperature @xcite may reflect an interplay between the ics fraction , which appears to decrease in less massive clusters @xcite , and the gas fraction , which varies in a complex manner as a function of temperature @xcite .",
    "this paper is not a detailed exploration of the parameter space currently accessible to models of icm enrichment by the ics , but rather a demonstration case for the importance of including the ics in any accounting of the chemical enrichment history of clusters . as such ,",
    "our conclusions are based on simple models that adopt typical values of such unknown quantities as the initial mass function and stellar yields .",
    "future work should aim to obtain the requisite observational constraints to test these models in detail across a larger sample of clusters .",
