    "one - dimensional ( 1d ) electron systems represent a valuable test case for the understanding of unusual quantum many - body states . on theoretical grounds the enhanced correlations in 1d",
    "lead to a breakdown of the paradigmatic fermi liquid picture involving new generic low - energy excitations . these manifest themselves in a dynamic decoupling of charge and spin degrees of freedom commonly referred to as spin - charge separation.@xcite while the low - energy physics is captured @xmath0 within the so - called tomonaga - luttinger model , which assumes linear band dispersions and therefore does not imply any intrinsic energy scale , the simplest model to explore generic 1d physics on the energy scale of the conduction band width is the 1d single - band hubbard model ( hm).@xcite the organic quasi-1d conductor ttf - tcnq , where stacks of either the tcnq or ttf planar molecules are effectively doped and become conducting by charge transfer from ttf to tcnq , was the first material where angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) was able to positively identify such 1d single - band hm spectral features as spinon and holon branches and the shadow band.@xcite however , in order to achieve a quantitative description of the experimental data a renormalization of the hopping integral @xmath1 at the surface by a factor of @xmath2 with respect to the bulk value from density - functional theory or estimates from bulk - sensitive measurements had to be assumed . at that time",
    "it was argued that due to the different madelung potential at the surface the topmost molecular layer may be relaxed with tilting angles of the molecules against the 1d axis being different from the bulk .",
    "an alternative proposition has recently been elaborated on,@xcite namely the necessity to incorporate the next - nearest neighbor coulomb repulsion @xmath3 in a hm description in addition to the onsite coulomb energy @xmath4.@xcite this reduces the effective energy for two electrons to pass each other to @xmath5 and hence enhances the effective hopping integral @xmath6 without the need to assume a larger @xmath1 .",
    "indeed , it was shown by density - functional theory that @xmath7 within a stack.@xcite however , these results are based on the bulk crystal structure and an experimental proof that no surface reconstruction is at work here is still lacking .",
    "there are few experimental techniques which in principle could give access to the molecular surface tilt such as quantitative low - energy electron diffraction ( leed ) @xmath8 measurements or scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) .",
    "nevertheless these techniques if applicable at all provide only indirect information and need theoretical simulations to interpret the experimental results . here",
    "we employ a method widely used in surface physics to determine orientations of adsorbed molecules and apply it to the surface of ttf - tcnq , namely angular dependent near - edge x - ray absorption fine structure ( nexafs ) spectroscopy.@xcite",
    "the nexafs measurements were performed at the pm-3 beamline of bessy ( berlin , germany ) using its mustang endstation .",
    "the energy resolution amounted to 35mev at the n  @xmath9 edge and was even lower according to the characteristics of a plane - grating monochromator at the c  @xmath9- and s  @xmath10-edges .",
    "clean sample surfaces were exposed through _ in situ _ cleavage of ttf - tcnq single crystals at low temperatures . to reduce radiation damage all spectra",
    "were recorded at 60k , _",
    "i.  e. _ above the charge density wave ( cdw ) phase transition temperature in the metallic phase .",
    "in order to achieve the required surface sensitivity the absorption signal was monitored in the auger electron yield mode using a specs phoibos  150 analyzer set to kinetic energies of 151ev , 268ev , and 381ev for s- , c- , and n - specific auger lines , respectively . at these kinetic energies",
    "the electron mean free path is typically less than 10@xcite which compares to the thickness of a single molecular layer in ttf - tcnq of @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the lattice constant perpendicular to the surface ( see below ) .",
    "hence the absorption signal indeed stems essentially from the topmost molecular layer .",
    "all absorption spectra were corrected for the time and energy dependence of the incoming photon flux through division by the ring current and the drain current of a freshly sputtered pt foil , respectively .",
    "the data were normalized in an energy region about 75ev above the absorption thresholds , where the final states are basically free - electron - like and hence isotropic .",
    "great care was exercised to avoid sample degradation upon irradiation .",
    "the irradiation exposure time of one and the same sample was about 40min before significant changes in the photoemission spectra of the s  2@xmath13 core level were detected which turned out to monitor most sensitively photon - induced damages",
    ".    in a molecular orbital picture nexafs involves the resonant x - ray excitation of a @xmath9- or @xmath10-shell electron into unoccupied low - lying molecular states governed by dipole selection rules .",
    "these project out the @xmath14- , @xmath13- , or @xmath15-like components of the antibonding @xmath16 or @xmath17 final states at the excited atom which makes nexafs site- and element - specific .",
    "the idea to determine the molecular orientation of molecules on or at surfaces is based on the polarization dependence of the involved dipole matrix elements .",
    "maximum absorption is obtained when the electric field vector @xmath18 of the linearly polarized x - rays points along a vector - like orbital or lies within a plane - like orbital.@xcite the absorption intensity then scales as @xmath19 where @xmath20 denotes the angle between @xmath21 and the direction of a vector - like orbital or the plane of a plane - like orbital .",
    "detailed expressions for the angular dependence of the @xmath9-shell absorption signal are given in ref .",
    "considering both the polar and azimuthal orientation of molecular orbitals with respect to the sample surface normal and in addition the degree of polarization .",
    "we note that in our case the expressions are simplified and become applicable also for @xmath10-shell absorption since the azimuthal orientation of the ttf and tcnq molecules can be assumed to be fixed and the variation of the x - ray light incidence angle is restricted to the plane spanned by the sample surface normal and the 1d axis .",
    "if one moreover takes into account that the molecules from adjacent stacks of the same kind are tilted in opposite directions one finally arrives at the following expressions for the angular dependence of vector and plane like orbitals , respectively : @xmath22 here @xmath23 is the angle between the direction of the incident x - rays and the sample surface , @xmath24 is the angle between the sample surface normal and the vector pointing in the direction of a vector - like orbital , @xmath25 denotes the angle between the sample surface normal and the normal vector of a plane - like orbital , @xmath26 is the degree of polarization , and @xmath27 and @xmath28 are normalization constants.@xcite note that @xmath24 and @xmath25 are related to the corresponding tilt angles of the molecules through @xmath29 and @xmath30 , respectively .",
    "the tilt angles can be determined by this method to an accuracy of about @xmath31 .    in order to study the effect of surface relaxation on the hopping integral @xmath1 band calculations",
    "were performed within the standard density - functional theory ( dft ) using the generalized gradient approximation ( gga).@xcite we employed the self - consistent full - potential linearized augmented plane wave ( lapw ) method as implemented in the wien2k code.@xcite",

    "the tilt angle is oppositely oriented between adjacent stacks .",
    "metallicity arises through charge transfer of about @xmath42 per ttf to each tcnq molecule .",
    "a detailed description of the strongly anisotropic band structure as obtained by gga calculations can be found elsewhere.@xcite here we focus on the ttf- and tcnq - derived conduction bands just below the fermi energy @xmath43 along @xmath37 , i.  e. along @xmath44z in the 1st brillouin zone ( black lines in fig .  [ ldabands ] ) . around @xmath44 a tcnq - derived band doublet ( split by hybridization of the electronic states of the two stacks per unit cell )",
    "can be identified while the corresponding almost degenerate ttf - derived doublet is found towards the brillouin zone boundary .",
    "what is important in our context is the fact that the experimental arpes dispersions indicate a bandwidth larger by a factor of @xmath2 with respect to band theory.@xcite this discrepancy might be reconciled by the assumption of a relaxed topmost molecular layer . at the surface",
    "the madelung potential and the polarization screening are different from the bulk which may allow for different molecule tilt angles to minimize energy .",
    "larger tilt angles lead to a smaller intermolecular distance @xmath15 and hence an increased transfer integral which is counteracted by a reduced area overlap through a larger lateral offset @xmath45 of adjacent molecules in a stack . assuming explicitly a @xmath46-dependence @xcite of the transfer integral this simple consideration leads to estimates for renormalized tilt angles as required to reproduce the experimental band widths , _ viz . _",
    "@xmath47 and @xmath48 for tcnq- and ttf - molecules , respectively . in order to explore this idea of a possible surface relaxation",
    "further we have performed new dft calculations for a hypothetical bulk structure based on these tilt angles . while these indeed almost replicate the observed larger ttf - derived conduction band width the occupied part of the tcnq band around @xmath44 comes out to have hardly any dispersion .",
    "probably this is due to the complex nodal structure of the tcnq - lumo@xcite perpendicular to the molecular plane which was neglected in the above qualitative consideration but can modulate the otherwise slowly varying functional behavior of @xmath49 in an oscillating manner causing one or several minima.@xcite in any case , one can induce from the above that ( i ) a molecular surface relaxation with @xmath15 and @xmath45 values in a realistic parameter regime can indeed be responsible for the enhanced experimental band widths and ( ii ) that a sizeable increase in the tilt angles by @xmath50 would be necessary .",
    "we add that it was briefly noted in the context of recent gga calculations that a structural optimization for the outer molecular layer keeping the others fixed found changes in the molecule inclination angles though with minor consequences for the electronic dispersions along @xmath37.@xcite     ( color online ) bulk gga band structure of ttf - tcnq along the 1d direction for the real ( black solid lines ) and a hypothetical ( red solid lines ) band structure based upon enlarged molecule tilt angles .",

    "the site and element sensitivity of nexafs enables the determination of the ttf and tcnq surface tilt angles separately recording the s  @xmath10 and n  @xmath9 absorption edges , respectively . on the other hand",
    "the angular dependence of the c  @xmath9 edge spectra contains information about the orientation of both molecules provided that the numerous resonances can be disentangled . in order to accurately extract the angular dependence of a certain resonance feature the nexafs spectra have to be analyzed using a suitable fitting scheme .",
    "we followed the approach of outka and sthr @xcite and fitted the spectra after a proper background subtraction with a minimal number of gaussian- and lorentzian - like peaks .",
    "absorption into the free - electron continuum was accounted for by an error function step where appropriate , whose position and width reflects the binding energy and the relative chemical shift@xcite due to the various inequivalent atoms in the structure .",
    "no `` hidden '' peaks were included in the fitting at a certain angle unless there was a definitive indication for them in the spectra at neighboring angles and a remnant still seen in the spectrum to be fitted .",

    "is reproduced together with the corresponding fit analysis from which the integral peak intensities are obtained .",
    "right panel : integrated peak areas for the peaks as in the fit of the left panel as a function of light incidence angle ( dotted curve ) .",
    "the solid lines mark fits according to the model as described in the text.,width=302 ]    ideally , during the fitting of a complete angle series the parameters for all peaks ( including the continuum step ) are determined once and for all for a particular spectrum and then held fixed except for the ones describing the relative integral weight of each component . in practice , this can not be sustained all over , especially for the c  @xmath9 edge where 9 crystallographically different c  atoms contribute and a unique identification of each resonance for all angles becomes difficult .",
    "moreover , a small relaxation ( within a few percent ) of all parameters was permitted in order to achieve better fits . for peak assignment we relied on the comprehensive nexafs study of fraxedas _ et al . _ on highly textured ttf - tcnq films.@xcite note that throughout this paper @xmath16 and @xmath17 resonances correspond to plane- and vector - like molecular orbitals within the classification scheme of ref .  .",

    "[ nkedge ] n  @xmath9 absorption spectra are displayed for various light incidence angles @xmath23 .",
    "on unbiased inspection four resonances can be discerned which are numbered and denoted according to their symmetry .",
    "their intensity variations with different light incidence angles are clearly seen .",
    "the n  @xmath9 edge spectra represent the `` clean '' case , @xmath52 all spectra can be fitted with one single set of underlying components .",

    "these values are in fair agreement with the number @xmath41 from the bulk .",
    "the somewhat higher value derived from the intensity variation of peak  3 probably reflects the insufficient approximation of the underlying spectral weight by just one peak as can be seen from its relative broad lorentzian shape .",
    "actually , most of the resonances which are denoted here comprise more than one molecular orbital with the same symmetries.@xcite however , this shortcoming has to be accepted following the directive to use a minimal set of peaks , for all of which clear indication is to be seen in at least one spectrum .",
    "( color online ) left panel : s  @xmath10 edge nexafs spectra of ttf - tcnq for various light incidence angles @xmath23 .",
    "right panel : integrated area for the pronounced @xmath57 resonance peak at 164.8ev ( dotted curve ) .",
    "the solid line depicts a fit according to the model as described in the text.,width=302 ]    figure  [ sledge ] shows s  @xmath10 edge nexafs spectra which are specific for ttf . as before distinct intensity variations as a function of @xmath23 are observed for at least four resonances which again are marked according to their symmetry in the plot .",
    "a detailed fit analysis is hampered here for two reasons .",
    "first the signal - to - noise ratio is much worse in the auger yield detection mode as compared to the n  @xmath9 edge which however can not be easily compensated by longer measuring times due to the comparatively rapid radiation induced sample degradation .",
    "second the overall spectral shape is much broader and the individual resonance peaks are much less well separated than in the case of the n  @xmath9 edge spectra except for the @xmath16 resonance at 164.8ev .",
    "therefore we only fitted this single peak for the evaluation of the ttf tilt angle . from the fit of the angle - dependent integral intensity which is displayed in the right panel of fig .",

    "the solid line depicts a fit according to the model as described in the text.,width=302 ]    the results obtained so far for the ttf and tcnq tilt angles might be corroborated from an analysis of the c  @xmath9 spectra if one succeeds to trace the intrinsic angular dependence of a resonance located either on the ttf or tcnq molecules . in fig .",
    "[ ckedge ] c  @xmath9 spectra taken at different light incidence angles are plotted . by comparison of c  @xmath9 edge spectra for ttf , tcnq , and ttf - tcnq shown in ref .",

    " a representative regression curve is plotted in the lower part of the left panel in fig .",
    "[ ckedge ]  it turns out that a unique tracking is only possible for the most pronounced resonance structure at 285.6ev which is identified as a @xmath17 resonance on ttf . in the right panel",
    "the angular variation of its integral intensity is shown together with the corresponding fit curve giving a tilt angle of @xmath60 .",
    "this again reflects the bulk value of @xmath61 in agreement with the analysis of the s  @xmath10 edge spectra instead of a strongly increased tilt for a relaxed surface .",
    "in the search of experimental realizations of generically 1d systems many claims have been made on the observation of certain _ isolated _ aspects such as spin - charge separation or the non - universal power - law suppression of spectral weight at the chemical potential .",
    "however , it is fair to say that a _ comprehensive _ theoretical and experimental picture where a sufficient number of pieces are put together thus exhibiting clear 1d phenomenology has not yet been achieved for any of these systems . probably for ttf - tcnq",
    "such an understanding is farthest developed .",
    "there not only the electronic arpes dispersions of the tcnq related spectral weight could be quantitatively fitted by the spinon and holon branches of the 1d hm using the bethe ansatz solution@xcite and the pseudofermion dynamical theory@xcite but also the overall spectral weight distribution could be reproduced by density - matrix renormalization - group ( ddmrg ) calculations.@xcite the underlying parameter set in both cases , _ viz .",
    "_ @xmath62ev and @xmath63ev , however , assumes a hopping integral @xmath1 which is enhanced by a factor of @xmath2 with respect to the dft calculations . to justify this assumption",
    "it was argued from an experimental point of view that the topmost surface layer of ttf - tcnq might be relaxed.@xcite on the other hand , further theoretical work has shown that the also observed transfer of spectral weight at @xmath64 over the entire conduction band width with increasing temperatures can not be reconciled within this parameter set.@xcite the effective magnetic exchange @xmath65 which defines a characteristic temperature for the onset of such an spectral - weight transfer would come out much too large within the 1d hm .",
    "this questions the assumption of a surface relaxation and hence an enhanced value of @xmath1 to explain the experimental data .",
    "results by exact diagonalization@xcite for @xmath66 found that the inclusion of the nearest - neighbor coulomb repulsion @xmath3 in the extended hubbard model offers a possible loophole since it effectively increases the bandwidths of the spinon and holon excitations to match the experimental dispersions while at the same time allowing for a smaller @xmath1 and hence a smaller @xmath65 in better agreement with experiment .",
    "indeed , koch _",
    "et al._@xcite recently have reported on density - functional results which find that the long - ranged coulomb repulsion even to the third nearest neighboring molecule within a stack is still about 20% of @xmath4 . however , these results are based on the bulk crystal structure of ttf - tcnq . in this context",
    "the nexafs work presented here provides the missing link which is needed to reconcile arpes dispersions and @xmath67 dependence with theory , _ viz .",
    "_ hm and dft calculations .",
    "our results indicate that no surface relaxation , _ i.  e. _ no extra molecule tilt , occurs for either the ttf or the tcnq stacks leaving the hopping integral @xmath1 at the surface essentially unaltered with respect to the bulk .",
    "these findings validate the work by koch _",
    "et al . _ which in turn corroborates the theoretical conclusion concerning the temperature - dependent redistribution of spectral weight above @xmath65 .",
    "it should not be concealed here that a theoretical description of the complete arpes data is not yet accomplished . in particular , the ttf derived part of the data calls for a consistent treatment on the same footing .",
    "this should be able to explain _",
    "e.  g. _ the seeming absence of the spinon - holon splitting although the electronic states of the ttf stacks should be more strongly correlated than those of the tcnq stacks .",
    "from the analysis of the angular dependence of the n  @xmath9 , s  @xmath10 , and c  @xmath9 nexafs spectra we arrive at a consistent picture where under the restrictions imposed by experiment the topmost molecular layer of ttf - tcnq single crystals appears to be structurally unaltered with respect to the bulk .",
    "this result lends additional significance to the approach to explain the deviations between experimental and dft band dispersions purely electronically . a refinement of the single - band 1d hubbard model by inclusion of a next - neighbor coulomb repulsion @xmath3 as proposed to explain the temperature dependence of the photoemission data thus seems plausible from an experimental point of view .",
    "we are grateful to m. sperling for technical assistance during the experiments at bessy and thank a. schll for fruitful discussions .",
