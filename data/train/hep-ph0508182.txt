    "this contribution reviews some of the recent developments in bsm phenomenology with an emphasis on results presented in the bsm working group sessions .",
    "however , it would be a mistake to consider this topic in isolation from the other working group topics .",
    "i expect the next few years to be exciting times in particle physics with the start of the lhc leading to major advances in our understanding of electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "it is likely that this will give us the first hints of physics bsm but it is possible that the first hints will come from elsewhere , perhaps anomalous properties of the top quark .",
    "maybe this new physics is supersymmetry .",
    "and maybe the new physics unravelled at the ilc will explain some of the puzzles in cosmology .",
    "the point is that while the physics topics have been divided up into ewsb , susy , top / qcd , new physics , and cosmology , they are all connected and one should not forget this when focusing on individual topics .",
    "this will be apparent in some of the examples chosen to describe the search for new physics .",
    "there are numerous models of new physics .",
    "an important task of the ilc will be to disentangle the possibilities and identify the correct one .",

    "i will examine some of approaches discussed to understand the underlying physics .",
    "this summary should not by any means be viewed as a comprehensive overview ; it is a snapshot of a selection of topics covered at this workshop and studied over the last few years .",

    "an important omission in this summary is the subject of higgless elecroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "a selection of recent papers on this subject is given in ref .",

    "some of the models that have attracted attention recently are the little higgs model @xcite , various models of extra dimensions @xcite ; add @xcite , rs @xcite , ued @xcite , and the higgsless model @xcite .",
    "however , we should nt ignore older models that , although less fashionable , may contain elements of truth in them .",
    "some models of continued interest are extended gauge sectors with extra @xmath0 factors @xcite like the @xmath1 where the extra @xmath0 factors give rise to extra neutral gauge bosons , the left - right symmetric model , @xmath2 , and dynamical symmetry breaking models such as technicolour and topcolour @xcite . from the point of view of disentangling these possibilities",
    "we need to understand what they have in common and how we can distinguish them . as a result",
    "i will focus on predictions of the various models and how we can unravel the underlying physics rather than on theoretical details of the various models .    in the next few paragraphs",
    "i will give a rather superficial survey of some recent models and refer the interested reader to the literature .",
    "my purpose here is to simply identify the characteristics of the various models that might reveal themselves by experiment .",
    "little higgs models : :    @xcite are a new approach to stabilize the weak scale against    radiative corrections .",
    "they predict new gauge bosons    @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 and a    new heavy top quark at the tev scale .",
    "the parameters of the littlest    higgs model relevant to the discussion are @xmath6 , the vev    that breaks the global symmetry group to a smaller group and sets the    mass scale of the new heavy particles in the model , and gauge boson    mixing angles @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "a light higgs    boson is expected at @xmath9  gev .",
    "the couplings to    @xmath10 are sensitive to new physics running in the    loop so measurement of the higgs @xmath10 and    @xmath11 br s is a sensitive test of the heavy top quark ,    extra gauge bosons and new scalar particles expected in little higgs    models .",
    "other modifications are expected due to mixing of tev - scale    particles with sm particles and corrections to sm parameters .",
    "extra dimensions : :    @xcite in most scenarios our 3-dimensional space is a 3-brane    embedded in a @xmath12-dimensional spacetime . the basic signal    is a kaluza klein ( kk ) tower of states corresponding to a particle    propagating in the higher dimensional space - time .",
    "the details depend    on the geometry of the extra dimensions with many different    variations .    +    * the add scenario @xcite has a kk tower of graviton states in 4    dimensions that behaves like a continuous spectrum which hewett    @xcite parametrized as the effective operator    @xmath13 that will lead to deviations in    @xmath14 dependent on @xmath15    and @xmath16 , a cut - off scale on the summation over the kk    states .",
    "add also predicts graviscalars and gravitensors propagating in    extra dimensions .",
    "the parameters of interest for add are the mixing    between the higgs boson and the graviscalar , @xmath17 , the    number of extra dimensions , @xmath18 , and the    @xmath19 scale .",
    "the mixing of the graviscalar with the higgs    boson leads to a significant invisible width of the higgs .    * in the randall sundrum model @xcite 2 3 + 1 dimensional branes are    separated by a 5th dimension .",
    "it predicts the existence of a radion    which corresponds to fluctuations in the size of the extra dimension .",
    "radions have anomalous couplings with gluon and photon pairs and since    they can mix with the higgs boson this alters the corresponding higgs    br s . in the rs model",
    "the kk graviton spectrum is discrete and    unevenly spaced .",
    "it is described in terms of two parameters , the mass    of the first kk state and the coupling strength of the graviton .",
    "tev    scale graviton resonances are expected to be produced in 2-fermion    channels .",
    "* in the universal extra dimension scenario @xcite all sm particles    propagate in the bulk resulting in kk towers for the sm particles with    spin quantum numbers identical to sm particles .",
    "the resulting spectrum    resembles that of susy and the conservation of kk number at tree level    ensures that the lightest kk partner is stable and is always pair    produced so that the signatures look alot like signatures of susy .    *",
    "an extension to both add and rs is the existence of higher curvature    terms in the action for gravity that may manifest themselves as we    approach @xmath20  tev @xcite . in rs the dominant    effect is a modification of the kk graviton mass spectrum and their    couplings to matter . in the case of",
    "add the modifications are quite    different .",
    "the usual add signatures remain unaltered but the    modifications lead to the production of long lived black holes . both    the rs and add modifications can be studied at the ilc .    to summarize , the models predict extra higgs bosons ( doublets and triplets ) , radions , graviscalars , gravitons , kk excitations of the @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , extra gauge bosons and extra fermions .",
    "almost all of the models predict new @xmath7-channel structures at the tev scale , either as extended gauge bosons or new resonances .",
    "to sort out the models we first need to elucidate and complete the tev particle spectrum and to then make precision measurements of their properties .",
    "there are several paths to discovering new physics .",
    "the most straight forward is the direct discovery of new particles .",
    "the next possibility is the indirect discovery by comparing deviations from the sm to specific new models .",
    "the final approach is to test for new physics by measuring the parameters of effective lagrangians .",
    "a starting point for indirect searches for new physics is to consider the common features of the various models . in almost all cases a new @xmath7-channel structure",
    "is expected at the tev scale either in the form of extra gauge bosons or as some other type of new resonance .",
    "each of these models predicts different properties for these new resonances so to distinguish between the possibilities we will need to make precision measurements .",
    "while it is likely that discoveries at the lhc will get us started it is almost a certainty that we will need the ilc to discriminate between models .",
    "an incomplete list of tools we will have at the ilc are measurements of the various di - fermion channels , anomalous fermion couplings , anomalous gauge boson couplings and measurement of the higgs couplings .",
    "let s start by considering the possibility that the lhc discovers an @xmath7-channel resonance in the dilepton invariant mass distribution .",
    "there are numerous possibilities of what it might be ; graviton , kk excitations , a @xmath24 , etc .",
    "the lhc can give some information about what it might be using the invariant mass distribution and forward backward asymmetry measurements @xcite .",
    "however , these measurements are rather crude and would require significant luminosity to achieve any sort of precision and resolving power .",
    "on the other hand if we assume the lhc discovers a single , rather heavy resonance , the ilc can make many precision measurements such as cross section and widths ( depending on the mass for the latter case ) , angular distributions , and its couplings via decays and polarization measurements .",
    "if the resonance is below the ilc threshould it can be produced on resonance . in this case",
    "angular distributions can be tested against different spin hypothesis to distinguish between a spin 2 graviton and say , a spin 1 @xmath24 .",
    "br s could be used to measure the resonance couplings which would distinguish between the universal couplings of a graviton or the unique couplings expected for the various @xmath24 scenarios .",
    "angular distributions and branching ratios for spin-2 gravitons from davoudiasl , hewett and rizzo @xcite are shown in fig .",
    "[ davoudiasl ] .",
    "a more likely scenario is that the mass of a new state is beyond the direct reach of the ilc . in this case",
    "we can still learn a considerable amount about a new resonance .",
    "there are numerous di - fermion channels and since the couplings to each channel is model dependent , observables such as cross sections to specific final states , forward - backward asymmetries , and left - right asymmetries can be used to distinguish between models .",
    "a first step is to disentangle the spin of the exchange particle . as a concrete example",
    "there have been a number of studies examining how to distinguish virtual graviton kk expected in the add scenario of finite size extra dimensions from other possibilities .",
    "hewett @xcite parametrized the exchange of virtual graviton kk states as the effective operator given in eqn .",
    "[ eq : hewett ] .",
    "she showed how interference with sm amplitudes leads to deviations in the dilepton observables dependent on both @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "rizzo has studied how multipole moments could be used to distinguish spin 2 from spin 1 @xcite .",
    "osland pankov and paver used the various difermion observables to estimate to what extent @xmath16 could be constrained at the ilc @xcite .",
    "more recently they constructed a `` forward - backward centre - edge '' defined as @xmath25 to identify graviton exchange and act as a discriminator between possible models @xcite . in this defination",
    "`` centre '' refers to a region with @xmath26 and `` edge '' refers to @xmath27 with @xmath28 a value that can be varied to optimize the discrimination power and @xmath29 is the forward - backward asymmetry evaluated for the centre region and the edge region .",
    "@xmath30 is shown in fig .",
    "[ pankov ] for a contact interaction and add graviton exchange .",
    "they estimated that the ilc would be sensitive to @xmath16 up to 3.5 and 5.8  tev for @xmath31 and 1.0  tev respectively with @xmath32  fb@xmath33 .",
    "a next step would be to measure the resonance couplings .",
    "riemann used the leptonic observables to demonstrate that one can extract a @xmath24 couplings and discriminate between models @xcite .",
    "a more recent analysis is shown in fig .",
    "[ godfrey ] which shows the resolution power for @xmath24 s coming from the @xmath34 @xmath35 , lr - symmetric , littlest higgs , and kk excitations .",
    "note that the couplings shown for the kk case do not in fact correspond to the kk @xmath24 couplings as in this model there are both photon and @xmath22 kk excitations . the point is simply the kk model can be distinguished from other models .",
    "these figures were produced for @xmath36  gev and @xmath37ab@xmath33 assuming electron and positron polarization of 80% and 60% respectively , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 .",
    "there is a two - fold ambiguity in the signs of the lepton couplings since all lepton observables are bilinear products of the couplings .",
    "the hadronic observables can be used to resolve this ambiguity since for this case the the quark and lepton couplings enter the interference terms linearly .",
    "a complementary approach was described by conley le and hewett @xcite who showed how the little higgs parameter space can be probed in the di - fermion channels .",
    "their results are shown in fig .",
    "[ conley ] which indicates how well the parameters of the model can be constrained assuming that the mass of the @xmath4 is known from the lhc .        the di - fermion channel has also been applied to other possible new physics .",

    "the kk excitations only couple to conventional fermions through loops . as a result",
    "the couplings are much smaller than sm couplings and @xmath41 is much less sensitive to ued kk excitations than to other types of new gauge bosons .",
    "a final example is that of universal extra dimensions ( ued ) .",
    "the kk spectrum in ued closely resembles that of susy .",
    "the typical signal for susy is missing @xmath42 .",
    "so , for example , if a signal with significant @xmath42 was observed at the lhc it is quite possible that one could not decide if it was due to susy or ued @xcite .",
    "however the spins of susy particles are different than that of ued kk particles .",
    "one can take advantage of this by studying the angular distributions of the outgoing muons in @xmath43 . in ued",
    "this signature arises from kk muon production , @xmath44 while in susy it arises from smuon pair production , @xmath45 .",
