    "x - ray absorption fine structure ( xafs ) is being used for studying both the electronic and the real structure of solids . for high photoelectron energies (  ev ) , the extended x - ray absorption fine structure ( exafs ) can be intuitively described in terms of backscattering of the excited photoelectron by neighboring atoms and the exafs analysis has become a standard tool for real structure investigations . on the other hand ,",
    "x - ray absorption near edge structure ( xanes ) is lagging behind in its applications for structural studies , despite some promising applications in selected systems.@xcite the reason for this rests in a more complex physics hidden behind xanes , resulting both in a more difficult theoretical treatment ( multiple - scattering , selfconsistency in potentials , non muffin - tin effects ) and in a lack of a proper intuitive insight into the formation of xanes peaks .",
    "the need for involving xanes in structural analysis stems partly from the fact that exafs is predominantly sensitive only to atomic distances and not to bond angles , and partly from the high signal - to - noise ratio for some interesting classes of systems which severely limits the ability to extract exafs oscillations from their spectra .    a means to interpret xanes in intuitively plausible terms would , among others , facilitate application of xanes spectroscopy in investigations of both the real and the electronic structure .",
    "various procedures were applied in the past with the aim to connect xanes spectral features with real structure . among them , let us mention inspecting the effect of adding or removing certain atoms in the test cluster,@xcite investigating the dependence of the height of the pre - peak on the geometry of the nearest neighborhood,@xcite calculating xanes by summing over many scattering paths@xcite or employing `` direct inversion '' technique for obtaining atomic positions and scattering potential from experimental xanes.@xcite in this study , we would like to tackle the problem of interpreting xanes spectra from yet another side , namely , we want to explore the probability density of the photoelectrons . such a procedure can be  from a certain viewpoint  considered as an answer to the naive question `` where the xanes photoelectron really is '' .",
    "answering such a fundamental question would have implications for real structure as well as for electronic structure studies .    at the beginning of this paper ,",
    "a general consideration of the problem will be outlined , the main goal being to define the task in exact terms .",
    "then we will present few mathematical formula which describe the problem and determine how the proper probability density ought to be evaluated .",
    "next follows a discussion of some practical aspects of evaluating the photoelectron probability density and the technique is illustrated on the pre - edge structure of ti _ k _ edge of  and on the whole ti _",
    "k _ edge xanes of .",
    "some more technical details are given in the appendices .",
    "xafs arises due to the energy - dependence of the core - electron photoeffect : an electron absorbs an x - ray photon , is ejected off the atom and starts to travel inside the solid . in a stationary picture , the wave function of the excited photoelectron can be viewed as being subject to multiple scattering by neighboring atoms .",
    "the probability of photoabsorption oscillates with energy  one can , especially in the exafs regime , interpret this oscillatory behavior intuitively as a consequence of either constructive or destructive interference of the photoelectron wave function .",
    "one can thus associate a particular spectral peak with scattering of a photoelectron of a certain energy .",
    "the topic of this section ( and of this paper as a whole ) is to explore the spatial localization of this photoelectron .      in the framework of the quantum theory , the popular question `` where is the electron '' can not be answered .",
    "however , it is possible to ask what is the probability density @xmath0  that a quantum - mechanical object can be found at a given place   it is just the square of the modulus of its wave function , @xmath1 so the problem is reduced to the task of finding the wave function @xmath2  which would appropriately describe the photoelectron participating in the formation of xanes at a given energy .",
    "the correct form of this wave function ought to emerge from the way of calculating the x - ray absorption  spectrum .",
    "the x - ray absorption spectrum ( xas ) intensity is proportional to the probability @xmath3  that a photon is absorbed by a core electron . that can be expressed , within the first - order perturbation theory , as @xmath4 where @xmath5  is the interaction hamiltonian perturbing the initial electron state @xmath6   and the sum / integration over @xmath7  spans _ any _ complete set of electron wave functions @xmath8  ( rydberg atomic units are used throughout this paper , taking , , , , ) .",
    "applying standard procedures , eq .",
    "( [ nusum ] ) can be transformed into expressions which involve either sums over bloch states,@xcite or molecular cluster basis functions,@xcite or photoelectron diffraction states@xcite or which , in the case of green function formalism , dispose of the final state wave functions altogether.@xcite the important factor is that the choice of the set of wave functions @xmath9does not affect the outcome of eq .",
    "( [ nusum ] ) .",
    "this is favorable on the one hand , as one does not have to care about the particular form of wave functions @xmath8  when calculating xas intensity . on the other hand ,",
    "it means that the proper photoelectron wave function can not just be borrowed from eq .",
    "( [ nusum ] ) or from any of its clones .    a close look at eq .",
    "( [ nusum ] ) reveals that the situation is even worse at the first sight .",
    "namely , it follows from eq .",
    "( [ nusum ] ) that the total absorption rate is actually resultant from many _ incoherent _ processes .",
    "hence , there is simply _ no single wave function _",
    "like @xmath10  which could have been inserted into eq .",
    "( [ born ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , one still can ask what is the probability that any electron ejected as a results of an absorption of a photon with energy @xmath11  can be found at .",
    "one only has to reformulate the problem slightly : instead of searching for , the quantity of interest should rather be a weighted sum of probability densities of those wave functions which describe states participating in the absorption process,@xcite @xmath12 the weights @xmath13  with which the participating wave functions contribute to  are the probabilities that a core electron @xmath14  is ejected into the state @xmath15 , @xmath16 they ought to be normalized so that their sum yields the total xas probability @xmath3 .",
    "note that all this is just another way of saying that the ejected photoelectron is described not by a single quantum state but rather by a density matrix , @xmath17    unfortunately , there appears to be a complication resulting from the use of eqs .",
    "( [ pr])([wf ] ) . unlike in the case of eq .",
    "( [ nusum ] ) , the outcome of eqs .",
    "( [ pr])([wf ] ) now , namely , _ does depend _ on the choice of the set of wave functions @xmath15  [ complete on the energy surface determined by the @xmath18-function in eq .",
    "( [ nusum ] ) ] .",
    "there is no way to fix this choice by relying solely on eq .",
    "( [ nusum ] ) .",
    "it is a matter of physical intuition , not formal mathematical procedures , to establish which set of states @xmath15  is relevant to the physical process in question .",
    "a guide for this choice could be the conservation of electron number : as one has one electron in the initial state ( it is the core electron @xmath6 ) , one has to end up with one electron in the final state as well .",
    "the choice of states @xmath15  is quite straightforward in the case of transitions to bound states ( say , of a molecule ) .",
    "the final states @xmath15  are just asymptotically decaying bound states @xmath19 , normalizable",
    "the situation is more complicated for transitions to the continuous part of the spectrum , as there is no _ a priori _ preference for normalization and/or boundary conditions which such a wave function ought to observe .    in order to find the correct wave functions ,",
    "let us contemplate a finite cluster of atoms ( a situation tacitly assumed in most applications of the real - space formalism)@xcite and follow the fate of the initially core electron . as a result of absorbing a photon ,",
    "this electron is torn off an atom and , having its energy above the continuum threshold , must finally leave the cluster and turn into a plane wave with a well - defined momentum direction .",
    "this means that the elementary incoherent processes involved in the sum ( [ pr ] ) must be _ photoelectron diffraction _ events . indeed , x - ray absorption is conceptually nothing else but angularly integrated photoelectron diffraction ( ped).@xcite the final states @xmath15  are , therefore , time - inversed scattering states , @xmath20 , which are in turn solutions of the lippman - schwinger equation@xcite @xmath21 where @xmath22  is the advanced free electron green function and @xmath23  describes the potential of the cluster .",
    "the states @xmath20  are normalizable to the delta function [ apart from the constant factor ] , which guarantees that they describe exactly one electron at a time.@xcite    the probability density  obtained via eqs .",
    "( [ pr])([wf ] ) can not be normalized to one .",
    "however , due to eq .",
    "( [ lse ] ) , it can be related to the probability density of a free electron , which is described by the wave function  and holds thus a constant probability density everywhere .",
    "so the probability density  is actually measured in `` units of free - electron probability density '' .",
    "thus , by pegging the normalization of @xmath15  to the normalization of the free - electron wave function , one keeps a universal definition of .",
    "intuitively , the wave function @xmath20  can be viewed as that wave function , from which a plane wave evolves within a sufficiently long time .",
    "it represents the state into which the core electron `` jumps '' as a result of the electromagnetic perturbation @xmath5 .",
    "thus , the quantity @xmath0   ought to be interpreted as the probability , that the electron ejected from a core level can be found at position , `` just after '' having absorbed an x - ray photon . by evaluating @xmath0 ,",
    "one provides the most sensible answer to the seemingly naive question about the localization of the xanes photoelectron .",
    "we bear in mind , at the same time , that this lippman - schwinger - like description can not fully substitute for a proper time - dependent treatment.@xcite      in this section , we present equations necessary for calculating the photoelectron probability density @xmath0 .",
    "although some of them can be found in that or other form in various papers dealing with x - ray absorption  or photoelectron diffraction  theory ( especially in refs .  ) , we present them here anyway in order to embed them into the context of this work , to offer the reader a complete set of equations which might be helpful for practical calculations and , last but not least , to unify various notations and conventions .    the proper mathematical expression for evaluating the probability density of electrons participating in x - ray absorption  process",

    "one has to recall , however , that pepd and xas carry in fact different kind of information : while the xanes intensity informs us about the probability that the ejected electron goes anywhere , pepd tells us how this `` anywhere '' looks like .",
    "only a tiny fraction of the photoelectron density matrix ( [ denmat ] ) , namely , that part of it which overlaps with the core of the central atom and which has the angular - momentum character conforming to the dipole and/or quadrupole selection rules , enters indirectly into expressions for the xanes intensity ( [ signbd])([sigtau ] ) .",
    "one can see immediately from the lower left panel of fig.[fig_tis2 ] that the chemical type governs the gross shape of curves ( we checked that this is true also for more distant atoms , which are not displayed here ) .",
    "the differences between pepd s around atoms at crystallographically equivalent positions ( say , ti or s atoms belonging to different coordination spheres ) comes first of all from the fact that this quantity is specifically related to the position of photoabsorbing atom , i.e. , the site from which the photoelectron was ejected .",
    "( apart from that , our finite - cluster approach obviously introduces inequality among otherwise equivalent sites . )",
    "hardly any polarization effect can be noticed in the  or @xmath53  curves , despite the fact that the -dependence in the xanes spectrum is quite significant . only the difference probability , which emphasizes the effect of the particular site from which the photoelectron is ejected , displays a strong polarization dependence .",
    "this is a manifestation of the dominance of the dos - generated unidirectional  contribution to the total pepd , as mentioned in the end of sec .",
    "[ sec_practical ] .",
    "neither local dos nor @xmath65   take into account that the photoelectron is _ ejected from a particular site _ via a dipole transition@xcite",

    "it is this small difference which reflects the fact that the  crystal does not look identical when viewed from the ti site either in the @xmath63-plane or in the @xmath66-axis directions .",
    "so one has to resort to the difference probability  if the polarization - related features of pepd are to be studied .    on the other hand , simple subtraction of the single - atom probability density",
    "does not provide a new insight .",

    "[ fig_tis2 ] , there seems to be no simple correspondence between xanes peaks and peaks in the photoelectron probability density .",
    "although for some atoms and/or peaks , one can establish a visual connection between xanes and pepd , for other features such a discernible connection is clearly absent .",
    "this lack of simple correspondence between xanes and pepd peaks may be a manifestation of the interference nature of xafs  it is generated not just through accumulating electrons here and there but rather by interference between many scattering paths .",
    "we performed also an angular - momentum analysis of pepd , according to eqs .",
    "( [ pr_l])([psph_l ] ) .",
    "we found that the @xmath68  component dominates at ti atoms ( it contributes by more that 95% to either or  or ) and that the @xmath69  component prevails at s atoms ( comprises 6070% of pepd ) .",
    "moreover , practically all of the fine structure in pepd is formed by the dominant @xmath46-component ( i.e. , @xmath68  at ti and @xmath69  at s atoms ) .",

    "they arrived at this conclusion by observing that this pre - peak disappears if those six ti atoms are removed from the cluster",
    ". a closer look at fig.[fig_tis2 ] reveals that the dos - inclusive probability  is , indeed , much higher near ti atoms than near s atoms .",
    "however , this effect is clearly dos - related , having little connection with the particular direction of the photoelectron trajectory . by inspecting the dos - corrected difference probability density  corresponding to the dominant pre - edge peak at @xmath70=6.5  ev",
    ", we can see that the largest effects _ purely connected with x - ray absorption _  actually occur at the nearest sulphur atoms .",
    "it is thus clear that nearest sulphurs definitely have their role in generating the  pre - peak .",
    "in fact , we found that omitting six nearest s atoms from a large 135-atoms cluster changes the calculated xanes drastically ( making the very concept of pre - edge region inapplicable ) .",
    "only the secondary - in - importance pre - edge peak at 7.58.0  ev seems to be generated by scattering off second - shell ti atoms , as it follows from  curves in fig .",
    "[ fig_tis2 ] .",
    "it seems , therefore , that the physical picture of the process which is responsible for the  pre - peak should consider the nearest sulphur atoms into account .",
    "namely , although the total amount of the photoelectron density  is small on sulphurs as compared with titaniums , its relatively modest variations with energy and polarization have a big impact on the xanes .",
    "let us emphasize that , strictly speaking , this kind of analysis only informs about sensitivity of the photoelectron density near individual atoms to the changes of polarization vector direction .",
    "it does not testify about the physical mechanism which may stand behind the creation of the pre - peak electron states .",
    "so our conclusions do not in fact contradict the suggestions that those states arise due to hybridization of central ti 4@xmath69  and next - neighboring ti 3@xmath68 orbitals@xcite  both views may be rather complementary than opposing .",
    "finally , let us note that the new look on the role of nearest sulphurs we take here may be relevant to other non - centrosymmetric systems with a distinct xanes pre - peak , such as a colossal magnetoresistence material la@xmath71ca@xmath72mno@xmath73  ( ref .  ) .",
    "the ti _ k _ edge  xanes of rutile  was studied very intensively due to its interesting pre - edge structure and the debate still does not seem to be settled.@xcite in this paper , however , we want to concentrate on the extended xanes up to @xmath74120  ev , as a comprehensive study of the effect of individual atoms on spectral peaks in this region was performed.@xcite in rutile , the ti atoms are located at the center of a distorted octahedron .",
    "the plane containing four equatorial oxygens  is parallel to the crystallographic @xmath75axis while two axial oxygens  lie inside the plane defined by axes @xmath76  and @xmath77 .",

    "jeanne - rose and poumellec@xcite studied how the polarized ti _",
    "k _ edge  xanes of , calculated for a cluster of 25 atoms , is affected by variations in the positions of  and  atoms .",
    "that makes it possible for us to explore here to what extent does sensitivity of a spectral peak to a position of a certain atom imply high pepd around that atom and _ vice versa_. in accordance with the discussion in sec .",
    "[ sec_tis2 ] , we will concentrate more on the difference probability  than on  itself .    in fig .",
    "[ fig_tio2 ] , theoretical polarized ti _",
    "k _ edgexanes of  is shown together with corresponding , , and  curves for the central ti and its nearest neighbors . in order to connect with",
    "jeanne - rose and poumellec,@xcite we consider a cluster of 25 atoms .",
    "the notation of spectral peaks @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81  and @xmath82  is taken from ref .  , too .",
    "the _ ad - hoc _ fermi energy would be around 10  ev in the energy scale of fig .",
    "[ fig_tio2 ] , meaning that the wild oscillations at the beginning of the pepd curves actually fall predominantly into the region of occupied states .",
    "let us now compare the conclusions of jeanne - rose and poumellec@xcite with the picture offered by the pepd analysis .",
    "the equatorial oxygen  was found to influence both the c and the d peaks for both polarizations , the effect being significantly stronger on d than on c and for the  polarization than for the  polarization.@xcite a counterpart to this effect can be found in the pepd : a distinct peak in  around can be found at d and a mild feature at c for both polarizations ; the d peak in  is higher for the  than for the  polarization .",
    "when the position of the axial oxygen  varies , the calculated  xanes is drastically altered at the d peak and not so much at the c peak , while the spectrum is changed at the c peak only.@xcite a brief look at the  curves in fig .",
    "[ fig_tio2 ] reveals that the largest  around the  atom is at the d peak for the  spectrum and at the c peak for the  case .",
    "so indeed , the energy at which a particular atom affects the photoelectron probability density most prominently coincides in this case with the energy at which the xanes is significantly changed when that atom is moved .",
    "the analogy is nevertheless only a qualitative one  larger  does not necessarily imply bigger changes of xanes peaks when  is moved . for example , the c resonance in   for  is stronger than the d resonance for , and yet the exact position of the  atom affects more the d spectral peak at  than the c peak at  polarization.@xcite on the other hand , the total probability density  is larger at the d peak energy than at the c peak for both oxygens , reflecting correctly the greater sensitivity of the d peak to their positions .",
    "so the following intuitively plausible picture emerges : for comparing xanes peaks at different energies , the total probability  may be a good indication of their respective sensitivity to atomic positions . for investigating polarization effects",
    ", one has to resort to .    unlike for the c and d peaks",
    ", a correspondence between xanes and  peaks can not be established for the e@xmath83   maxima .",
    "jeanne - rose and poumellec@xcite found that the e@xmath84  peak in the  spectrum is affected quite a lot by the  movement while peaks e@xmath85  and e@xmath73  are left basically intact for either polarization  a property that does not seem to have a counterpart in fig .",
    "[ fig_tio2 ] .",
    "the sensibility of a xanes peak to a movement of a particular atom , hence , does not necessarily imply a high localization of the photoelectron around that atom  that can be found only by a proper pepd calculation .",
    "it is worth noting that if single - scattering dominates in generating a particular xanes peak ( such as c for the polarization),@xcite one can observe a distinct resonance in  at corresponding energy . on the other hand ,",
    "such a correspondence appears to be blurred for spectral peaks where a significant contribution from multiple - scattering is suspected ( such as c peak at the  atom for the  polarization or the e@xmath84  peak at and   for the  polarization).@xcite this seems to be plausible  a multiple - scattering nature of a peak emphasizes that it is generated not by a mere `` presence '' of the photoelectron near certain atom but rather by a complicated interference process .",
    "it remains to be explored to what extent this trend is a general one .",
    "photoelectron probability density offers us a direct look on the spatial localization of those electron states which are seen by xas .",
    "contrary to a bit vague concepts like importance of various atoms for the formation of a particular xanes peak or order of multiple - scattering which has to be accounted for , pepd is a rigorously defined quantity with a transparent physical interpretation .",
    "hence even if there were no immediate practical applications , pepd analysis would still remain a valuable tool for understanding the physical processes which give rise to the xanes spectrum .",
    "apart from this principal asset , there are two directions where pepd analysis could contribute to solving concrete problems : investigations of real structure of solids and investigations of their electronic structure .",
    "one of the obstacles to overcome when fitting the experimental xanes spectrum with calculated spectra of trial structures is that ones has , in general , a lot of atoms to move and hence it is difficult to identify those whose positions are most critical for the xanes shape . by providing a deeper insight into the `` photoelectron trajectory '' , pepd analysis may drop a hint for the most critical spots in advance .",
    "intuitive arguments and practical experience ( sec.[aplikace ] ) show that both  and  reflect the sensitivity of xanes to movement of individual atoms : total probability density  is more relevant for comparing roles of different chemical species while  is more indicative of the polarization and site dependence of xanes spectra .    in electronic structure studies ,",
    "the appealing feature of pepd is that it directly investigates those unoccupied states which are probed by xas .",
    "when investigating the spatial localization of these states , one is thus not left relying on heuristic arguments like `` which atom affects the spectrum most if moved '' .",
    "one can even explore the angular - momentum character of xanes states by projecting the wave functions  along eqs .",
    "( [ pr_l])([psph_l ] ) . in that way",
    ", one can see not only from which atom a particular xanes peak arises but also from what type of orbital is comes from .",
    "the concept of pepd relates , of course , not just to the xanes region but to the exafs part of the absorption spectrum as well .",
    "the reason why we mention only xanes here explicitly is that exafs oscillations can be properly analyzed with other tools .",
    "note also that the pepd analysis could be applied to photoelectron diffraction as well  one would just have to omitt the angular integration  in eqs .",
    "( [ vaha ] ) , ( [ psph ] ) and in related expressions .",
    "our analysis demonstrates that it makes sense to explore the probability that a photoelectron participating in a xanes process can be found at a specific place .",
    "the relevant quantity is the photoelectron probability density and it can be calculated as a sum of squares of wave functions describing elementary ped processes , weighted by normalized ped cross sections . when investigated as a function of the photoelectron energy ,",
    "it exhibits a resonance - like structure and depends on the atom around which it is evaluated .",
    "the bulk of pepd is dominanted by dos - like effects , meaning that , e.g. , hardly any polarization dependence can be seen in it unless the dos - related portion is subtracted . in many cases ,",
    "high difference probability  around an atom may serve as an indication of high sensitivity of xanes towards the position of that atom for a given energy .",
    "the fine structure in pepd does not copy the corresponding xanes : for some atoms and/or peaks , a visual connection between xanes and pepd can be established , for other features such a discernible connection is absent . this may be a manifestation of the interference nature of xafs  the correspondence between xas and pepd peaks is more often observed for features which arise from single scattering than for multiple - scattering peaks .",
    "the spatial dependence of pepd thus provides information which is not equivalent to what can be learned from comparing theoretical spectra for various trial structures but rather is complementary to it .    by performing a pepd analysis for a ti _ k _ edge  of",
    ", we found that , contrary to earlier interpretations , the sulphur atom nearest to the absorbing titanium participates significantly in formation of the distinct polarization - dependence of the pre - peak .",
