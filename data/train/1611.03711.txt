    "<S> the better quality of the data , the higher beam energies , and the better separation of pure exclusive events motivate an update of the analysis of @xmath3 diffractive photoproduction given in refs . </S>",

    "<S> corrections due to the skewing of the gluons and the real part of the amplitude are included exactly as in @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we use @xmath2 factorization to obtain a more precise expression than that given in ( [ eq : lo ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> it accounts for the main kinematic corrections to the lo formula and we call it the ` nlo ' approach </S>",
    "<S> . however it does not include the full nlo corrections in terms of collinear factorization . </S>",
    "<S> to keep the value of @xmath2 unchanged we have to account for the fact that no additional gluons with transverse momentum larger than @xmath2 are emitted in the exclusive process by including the sudakov factor @xmath30 , t(k_t^2,^2 )  =  exp , with @xmath31 for @xmath32 ; and integrating over the @xmath2 of the gluons . </S>",

    "<S> when evaluating ( [ eq : nlointegral ] ) we use a nlo gluon parametrisation of the same form as fitted in @xcite , see ( [ eq : gpdf ] ) below . recall </S>",
    "<S> that working in terms of @xmath2 factorization we avoid the problem of the choice of the factorization scale @xmath39 , which in the low @xmath1 region creates a large uncertainty for the theoretical prediction based on collinear factorization . here the convergence of the integral over @xmath2 is provided by an explicit form of the ` hard ' matrix element ; that is , by the factor @xmath40 in ( [ eq : nlointegral ] ) even without the kinematic cutoff which is , strictly speaking , beyond the leading log approximation .    what additional corrections are there in our calculation of @xmath41 ? </S>",
    "<S> first , there may be an uncertainty arising from the skewed factor , which accounts for the difference between the conventional ( diagonal ) gluon pdf and the generalized ( gpd ) distribution , arising from the different @xmath42 and @xmath3 masses . </S>",
    "<S> as in @xcite , we use the shuvaev transform to relate the diagonal pdf and the gpd . </S>",
    "<S> this provides sufficient accuracy , @xmath43 , in our low @xmath1 domain . </S>",
    "<S> next , there may be an uncertainty coming from the real part of the amplitude , which is evaluated approximately . again </S>",
    "<S> the uncertainty is small ( less than 2% ) in the low @xmath1 region , where the @xmath1 dependence is not steep and the re / im ratio is rather small . finally , there are relativistic corrections to the @xmath3 wave function , which in the analysis were considered just in the non - relativistic approximation . </S>",
    "<S> these were estimated by hoodbhoy @xcite : normalizing to the experimental values of @xmath19 and @xmath44 , he found the remaining relativistic corrections are rather small , amounting to a suppression of about @xmath45 .    here we perform a combined description of the hera data for @xmath46 and the lhcb data for @xmath47 at 7 tev @xcite first omitting , and then including , the preliminary 13 tev data @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we also include not only the hera photoproduction data but also electroproduction data . to describe the scale dependence of the gluon pdf we take the form xg(x,^2 )  =  nx^-a()^bexp  with  g= , [ eq : gpdf ] with parameters @xmath48 and @xmath49 to be determined by the data . </S>",
    "<S> with three light quarks @xmath50 and @xmath51 we have @xmath52 . </S>",
    "<S> the exponential accounts for the resummation of the leading double logarithmic terms @xmath53 . </S>",
    "<S> we use the one - loop @xmath54 coupling and allow for the single log contributions via free parameters : the variable @xmath55 to account for the @xmath1 dependence and the variable @xmath49 to account for the @xmath56 dependence . </S>",
    "<S> we take @xmath57 mev and @xmath58 gev . </S>",
    "<S> the expression obtained from fitting the parametric form to the data reproduces , to good accuracy , nlo dglap low @xmath1 evolution in the internal of @xmath59 from @xmath60 gev@xmath61 more than covering that needed for the exclusive @xmath3 data .    to describe the exclusive lhcb @xmath62 process , </S>",
    "<S> we must account for the probability of additional soft interactions between the two colliding protons , which will generate secondaries that will populate the rapidity gaps and destroy the exclusivity of the event . </S>",
    "<S> these absorptive corrections are calculated using an eikonal model @xcite . in this way </S>",
    "<S> we obtain a suppression or survival factor , @xmath63 , which depends on the @xmath11 collider energy and the energy , @xmath21 , of the photon - proton sub - process @xmath64 . </S>",
    "<S> recall , from @xcite , that there are two diagrams describing exclusive @xmath3 production of rapidity @xmath65 at the lhc . </S>",
    "<S> the diagram with the larger photon - proton sub - process energy , denoted @xmath66 , gives the major contribution for a @xmath3 produced at large rapidity and allows a probe of the gluon to very low @xmath1 values , @xmath67 . </S>",
    "<S> the other diagram in which the virtual photon is emitted from the other proton has lower @xmath22 energy , @xmath68 , and opposite @xmath3 rapidity with respect to the proton which radiates the photon . </S>",
    "<S> that is @xmath69 . </S>",
    "<S> the theoretical prediction for the @xmath62 cross section is given by @xmath70 we see that the values of the subprocess cross sections , @xmath71 , are weighted by the corresponding survival factors @xmath72 and the photon fluxes @xmath73 for photons of energy @xmath74 . </S>",
    "<S> the interference term between the @xmath66 and @xmath68 diagrams is strongly suppressed , see @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> .rapidity gap survival factors @xmath63 for exclusive @xmath3 production , @xmath75 , as a function of the @xmath3 rapidity @xmath65 for @xmath11 centre - of - mass energies of @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 tev . </S>",
    "<S> the columns labelled @xmath72 give the survival factors for the two independent @xmath64 subprocesses at different @xmath79 centre - of - mass energies @xmath80 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     in comparison with our previous analyses @xcite , here we use the precise expression for the photon flux @xcite , keeping all the corrections of @xmath81 . moreover , we used an updated model for the gap survival factors tuned to the precise totem data @xcite for @xmath11 scattering at 7 tev . </S>",
    "<S> was removed , which slightly reduces the values of @xmath63 . ] the updated values of the survival factor as listed in table [ tab : a1 ] for the @xmath11 centre - of - mass energies 7 , 8 and 13 tev and for the relevant range of @xmath3 rapidities @xmath65 . </S>",
    "<S> these improved values of the survival factors and the photon flux were used in the jmrt prediction shown in the recent 13 tev lhcb paper @xcite ; a prediction obtained from an earlier fit to the 7 tev lhcb data and hera data . additionally , we improve our fitting procedure to allow also for bin - to - bin correlated errors within each individual data set as well as uncorrelated errors . </S>",
    "<S> for each of the zeus 2002 and 2004 data sets @xcite we allow for a fully correlated 6.5@xmath82 normalisation error . </S>",
    "<S> for the h1 2006 data set @xcite we include a fully correlated 5@xmath82 normalisation error ( also between the photoproduction and electroproduction data ) . for the h1 2013 data @xcite we use the full covariance matrix as provided by h1 . </S>",
    "<S> for the lhcb 2014 data @xcite we allow for a fully correlated 7@xmath82 normalisation error . </S>",
    "<S> the lhcb 2013 data @xcite are superseded by the 2014 data and are not included . </S>",
    "<S> for the preliminary lhcb 2016 data @xcite we take the fully correlated normalization error of 7@xmath82 .    </S>",
    "<S> [ h ]    the two bands in fig . 1 show the results of two ` nlo ' fits to the lhcb data for @xmath83 together with the hera data for @xmath84 ; first omitting , and second including , the preliminary 13 tev lhcb data . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain respectively the parameter values @xmath85 </S>",
    "<S> @xmath86 for the gluon distribution of ( [ eq : gpdf ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the two sets of parameters are essentially identical . </S>",
    "<S> we only show the diagonal errors , but note that there is a strong correlation between the parameters @xmath87 and @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> note that the gluon form ( [ eq : gpdf ] ) produces a curvature in the @xmath1 behaviour which prevents the band going through the centre of the 7 tev lhcb data @xcite , even when omitting the 13 tev data @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we emphasize that the ` effective ' lhcb data points for @xmath88 shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : f1 ] are not measured directly by the experiment , but display the self - consistent @xmath66 solution which results from our fits .    </S>",
    "<S> [ h ]    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : f2 ] we compare the integrated gluon pdfs , @xmath89 , extracted from the ` nlo ' fits to the lhcb data , with the _ central _ values of the nlo gluon distributions obtained from the global parton analyses of refs . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , for different values of the scale @xmath90 . </S>",
    "<S> the spread of these central values of the ` global ' gluon distributions are bounded by the faintly shaded domains in the figure . </S>",
    "<S> we see that we have a good general agreement between the gluon pdf obtained using exclusive @xmath0 lhcb data and the gluon determined in the global parton analyses in the region @xmath91 where the global analyses are able to determine the gluon from data . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , the spread of the central values for @xmath92 indicates that the global analyses are unable to pin down the gluon distribution in this region . of course , strictly speaking , </S>",
    "<S> the ` nlo ' gluon pdfs that we obtain from exclusive @xmath0 data using @xmath2 factorization , should not be directly compared to the @xmath93 pdf distributions of the nlo global parton analyses , since our ` nlo ' gluon distributions ( i ) do not include all the collinear nlo corrections , and ( ii ) correspond to the ` physical ' scheme in which the pdfs are a bit different to those defined in the @xmath93 scheme .    </S>",
    "<S> recall that , although the nlo corrections to @xmath0 photoproduction have been known explicitly in the collinear @xmath93 factorization scheme for some time @xcite , it has been impossible to extract information in this scheme due to the very strong dependence on the choice of factorization scale . </S>",
    "<S> very recently this problem has been solved in principle . </S>",
    "<S> we can choose the so - called optimal factorization scale , @xmath94 , which allows the resummation of the double - log @xmath95 contributions @xcite ; also it is possible to resum the bfkl - induced single - logs @xmath96 terms @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> ( here the skewed parameter @xmath97 plays the role of @xmath1 . ) </S>",
    "<S> finally we need to impose a ` @xmath98 cut ' @xcite , which gives rise to power corrections that are necessary to avoid double counting and which are crucial numerically at the low optimal factorization scale . </S>",
    "<S> this opens the possibility of the exclusive @xmath3 data in the forward direction at the lhc being able to determine the @xmath93 gluon pdf at low scales . </S>"
