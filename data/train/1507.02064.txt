    "in @xcite it was shown through a zero temperature analysis that @xmath4 scalar states , such as the @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and the two @xmath7 s are preferred to have masses above @xmath8  gev .",
    "similar results was obtained with @xmath4 states in @xcite , while in @xcite it was shown by using tetraquarks instead of @xmath4 states that the ( tetraquark ) scalar masses are in the range @xmath9  gev .",
    "these results suggests that the physical states @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 ( or @xmath14 ) are predominantly @xmath15 states , while @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 are predominantly tetraquark states .",
    "however , states with the same quantum numbers do mix , thus the physical scalar particles are mixtures of @xmath4 and tetraquarks states . in the current case of the extended linear @xmath20 model ( el@xmath20 m )",
    "we have only one scalar nonet , thus we can describe one @xmath5 , one @xmath6 and two @xmath7 ( which will be denoted by @xmath21 ) particles . consequently , one of the most interesting question is that which physical states our fields predominantly are if we investigate the finite temperature / density behavior of our model additionally to the zero temperature properties .",
    "the lightest isoscalar ( @xmath22 ) @xmath4 state , @xmath7 ( also called @xmath20 ) is strongly related to the non - strange condensate . since the larger is the sigma mass compared to the mass of its chiral partner ( the pion ) the larger is the temperature at which @xmath23 approaches @xmath24 in the chiral symmetry restoration , one would expect that a large @xmath23 mass results in a large pseudocritical temperature ( @xmath25 ) at zero baryochemical potentials . on the other hand",
    "it is a common expectation that the chiral phase transition is of first order as a function the baryochemical potential ( @xmath3 ) at @xmath1 , and since with increasing @xmath23 mass the transition weakens , at some point it is possible that the transition becomes crossover @xcite .",
    "this suggest that for a good thermodynamic description a small @xmath23 mass is needed , and indeed as it turns out our approach supports this requirement .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next subsection",
    "we introduce the model by giving the lagrangian . in sec .",
    "[ sec : param ] the determination of the model parameters is shown , while the description of the approximation used to calculate the grand potential together with the field equations are presented in sec .  [",
    "sec : field_eq ] .",
    "the lagrangian we shall use has the following form : @xmath26 -    m_{0}^{2}{\\mathop{\\mathrm{tr}}}(m^{\\dagger}m ) - \\lambda_{1}[{\\mathop{\\mathrm{tr}}}(m^{\\dagger } m)]^{2 } -    \\lambda_{2}{\\mathop{\\mathrm{tr}}}(m^{\\dagger}m)^{2 } { { \\nonumber}}\\\\    & + c_{1}(\\det m+\\det m^{\\dagger } ) + { \\mathop{\\mathrm{tr}}}[h(m+m^{\\dagger } ) ]   -    \\frac{1}{4}{\\mathop{\\mathrm{tr}}}(l_{\\mu\\nu}^{2}+r_{\\mu\\nu}^{2 } ) { { \\nonumber}}\\\\     & + { \\mathop{\\mathrm{tr}}}\\left [ \\left(\\frac{m_{1}^{2}}{2}+\\delta\\right )      ( l_{\\mu}^{2}+r_{\\mu}^{2})\\right ] + i\\frac{g_{2}}{2}({\\mathop{\\mathrm{tr}}}\\{l_{\\mu\\nu}[l^{\\mu},l^{\\nu}]\\ } +    { \\mathop{\\mathrm{tr}}}\\{r_{\\mu\\nu}[r^{\\mu},r^{\\nu}]\\ } ) { { \\nonumber}}\\\\    & + \\frac{h_{1}}{2}{\\mathop{\\mathrm{tr}}}(m^{\\dagger}m){\\mathop{\\mathrm{tr}}}(l_{\\mu } ^{2 } + r_{\\mu}^{2 } )    + h_{2}{\\mathop{\\mathrm{tr}}}[(l_{\\mu}m)^{2}+(m r_{\\mu } ) ^{2 } ] \\\\    & + 2h_{3}{\\mathop{\\mathrm{tr}}}(l_{\\mu}m r^{\\mu}m^{\\dagger } )       + \\bar{\\psi}\\left[i \\gamma_{\\mu}d^{\\mu}-\\mathcal{m}\\right]\\psi { { \\nonumber}}\\end{aligned}\\]][eq : lagr ] the covariant derivatives above are given by @xmath27 , \\quad d^{\\mu}\\psi = \\partial^{\\mu}\\psi - i    g^{\\mu}\\psi,\\ ] ] where @xmath28 with @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) denoting the @xmath31 group generators given in terms of the gell - mann matrices @xmath32 . here",
    "@xmath33 stands for the scalar ",
    "pseudoscalar fields , @xmath34 for the left and right handed vector fields ( which contain the nonets of vector ( @xmath35 ) and axial vector ( @xmath36 ) meson fields ) , @xmath37 is the electromagnetic field , while @xmath38 are the gluon fields .",
    "the field strength tensors are ( @xmath39 ) @xmath40 - \\left\\{\\partial^{\\nu}q^{\\mu } -    iea_{e}^{\\nu}[t_{3},q^{\\mu}]\\right\\},\\ ] ] while the external fields related to the scalar and vector fields are @xmath41 , @xmath42 ( for more details on the model see @xcite ) .",
    "there are @xmath43 unknown parameters in eq .  , which will be present in the field equations at finite temperature and/or density , namely , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 . from this set",
    "@xmath52 can be melted into @xmath48 thus leaving @xmath59 unknowns .",
    "these parameters are determined similarly as in @xcite , that is we calculate values of various masses and decay widths at tree - level and compare them with the corresponding experimental value taken from the pdg @xcite through the @xmath60 minimalization process of ref .",
    "it is important to note that we artificially increased the errors of the pdg to a minimum level of @xmath61 , since we do not expect that our model to be more precise .",
    "another important points are that now we use a different anomaly term in eq .",
    "( the term proportional to @xmath47 ) as was presented in @xcite , we fit the total width in case of @xmath16 instead of the amplitudes , we include the @xmath7 masses and decay width into the global fit , we take into account of the effects of the fermion vacuum fluctuations , case of which the expression of the ( pseudo)scalar masses are modified . moreover , since now we also included the constituent quarks in the isospin symmetric limit , we use two additional equations to their tree - level masses with the values @xmath62  mev , and @xmath63  mev .    the scalar meson sector below @xmath64  gev contains more physical particles than we can place into one @xmath65 nonet ( consisting of @xmath5 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 ) , since in nature two @xmath5 , two @xmath66 and five @xmath7 particles exist in that energy range .",
    "these particles are the @xmath16 and @xmath10 ( denoted by @xmath69 ) , the @xmath70 and @xmath71 , ( denoted by @xmath72 ) , the @xmath18 ( or @xmath20 ) , @xmath19 , @xmath12 , @xmath14 and @xmath13 , ( denoted by @xmath73 ) .",
    "accordingly there are @xmath74 particle assignment possibilities to pair the physical particles to the members of the nonet in the model .",
    "we performed a @xmath60 fit for all the assignments and ordered them according to their @xmath60 values .",
    "the results of the @xmath75 best solution along with the particle assignments in two cases ( with and without the fermionic vacuum fluctuation ) are shown in table  [ tab : chi2 ] .    .@xmath60 and @xmath76 values ( @xmath77 ) for the first five best solutions of the fit together with the particle assignment without ( left part ) and with ( right part ) the fermionic vacuum fluctuations . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     by a similar fitting procedure in @xcite we argued that the best assignment without fitting the @xmath21 is the @xmath78 , while we reasoned that @xmath21 should correspond to @xmath79 .",
    "now it seems that the situation changes since table  [ tab : chi2 ] one can see that the two best assignment in case with and without using the fermion vacuum fluctuation are @xmath80 and @xmath81 , respectively .",
    "this suggest that using only zero temperature quantities in this model is not enough to point out uniquely a single particle assignment .",
    "thus we investigated the properties of the different particle assignments at finite temperature / densities as well .",
    "in our model there are four order parameters , which are the two chiral condensates @xmath54 ( non - strange ) and @xmath55 ( strange ) and the two polyakov loop variables @xmath82 and @xmath83 ( for the introduction of the polyakov loop variables and their potential see @xcite ) .",
    "the field equations , which determine the dependence on @xmath84 and @xmath85 of the order parameters are given by the minimalization of the grand canonical potential ( see eg .",
    "@xcite ) , @xmath86 which will result in four coupled equations . in our approach",
    "we only consider vacuum and thermal fluctuations for the constituent quarks and not for the mesons .",
    "the explicit expression for the field equations can be found in @xcite ( eq .  ( 2)-(5 ) ) .",
    "by solving the field equations eq",
    ".   we can investigate the behavior of the @xmath54 , @xmath55 order parameters as a function of @xmath84 at @xmath2 and as a function @xmath3 at @xmath1 .",
    "it was calculated on the lattice @xcite that at @xmath2 the value of the pseudocritical temperature @xmath87 should be @xmath88  mev , while it is a common belief that the order of the transition in @xmath3 at @xmath1 should be of first order . on fig .",
    "[ fig : tc_vs_muf0 ] the @xmath25 and @xmath89 values for all the 40 assignments are shown as a function of @xmath90 ( the low lying isoscalar mass ) together with the lattice value for the @xmath25 .",
    "( left ) and @xmath89 ( right ) values versus @xmath90 . on the left @xmath25",
    "is shown for two different polyakov potential.,width=396 ]    it can be seen that in order to be consistent with the lattice @xmath25 the @xmath90 mass should be below @xmath8  gev , which can be correspond either to @xmath18 or to @xmath19 .",
    "however if we would like to have first order phase transition on the @xmath3 axis , the @xmath90 mass should be even smaller ( @xmath91  mev ) .",
    "consequently we investigated the phase boundary for parameterizations with relatively small @xmath90 masses .    on the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : cep ] the phase boundary together with the position of the critical endpoint ( cep ) is shown , while on the right panel the cep variation with the @xmath90 mass is presented .",

    "the cep position on the left is at @xmath92  mev , @xmath93  mev),width=396 ]    if we increase the @xmath90 mass above @xmath94  mev the cep ceases to exist .",
    "in conclusion we can say that in order to have a good thermodynamic description within the framework of the current model we must have the @xmath18 particle in the spectrum .",
