    "an accurate value for the coupling constant @xmath5 in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) is important both for qcd phenomenology , and as an input for possible theories beyond the standard model . some of the most accurate values for the coupling constant come from numerical simulations of qcd using lattice techniques , when combined with very accurate experimental data for hadron masses . in this paper",
    "we update our previous determinations of the coupling from wilson loops in lattice qcd  @xcite .",
    "our new analysis takes advantage of new simulation results , from the milc collaboration , that employ smaller lattice spacings  @xmath6 .",
    "we also now account systematically for chiral corrections associated with the masses of sea quarks in the simulation , and for @xmath7 uncertainties in the values we use for the lattice spacing .",
    "few - percent accurate qcd simulations have only become possible in the last few years , with the development of much more efficient techniques for simulating the sea quarks ; see , for example ,  @xcite for an overview and references .",
    "the simulations we use include only light quarks ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) in the vacuum polarization ; the effects of @xmath8 and @xmath9 quarks are incorporated using perturbation theory , which is possible because of their large masses .",
    "our lattice qcd analysis proceeds in two steps .",
    "first the qcd parameters  the bare coupling constant and bare quark masses in the lagrangian  must be tuned . for each value of the bare coupling ,",
    "we set the lattice spacing to reproduce the correct @xmath10@xmath11  meson mass difference in the simulations , while we tune the @xmath12 , @xmath2 , @xmath8 and  @xmath9 masses to give correct values for @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 , respectively ; more information can be found in @xcite .",
    "for efficiency we set @xmath17 ; this leads to negligible errors in the analysis presented here .",
    "once these parameters are set , there are no further physics parameters , and the simulation will accurately reproduce qcd .    having an accurately tuned simulation of qcd",
    ", we use it to compute nonperturbative values for a variety of short - distance quantities , each of which has a perturbative expansion of the form @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath1 are dimensionless @xmath6-independent constants , and @xmath20 is the ( running ) qcd coupling constant , with @xmath21 light - quark flavors , in the @xmath22  scheme  @xcite . given the coefficients @xmath19 , which are computed using feynman diagrams , we choose @xmath20 so that the perturbative formula for @xmath23 reproduces the nonperturbative value given by the simulation . given @xmath1 and @xmath6 , and the @xmath8 and @xmath9 masses , we can then use perturbation theory to convert @xmath20 to the more conventional coupling constant @xmath24 , evaluated at the mass of the z  meson  @xcite .",

    "the simplest short - distance quantities to simulate are vacuum expectation values of wilson loop operators : @xmath26 where @xmath27  denotes path ordering , @xmath28  is the qcd vector potential , and the integral is over a closed @xmath29  rectangular path .",

    "this matters since comparing results at different lattice spacings bounds the uncalculated high - order perturbation theory coefficients in our analysis ( @xmath19 for @xmath76 ) .",
    "we are also allowing for larger finite-@xmath6 errors in @xmath85 on the coarsest lattices than we did previously .",
    "the changes in @xmath85 , together with the smaller lattice spacing , account for most of the increase in our final result .",
    "another change , which has less impact , is the inclusion of possible higher - dimension condensates .",
    "we also now do a more systematic analysis of effects due to the sea - quark mass , fitting results with many different masses , but the effect on our final result is small .",
    "finally , we now use better scales  @xmath62 for the creutz ratios and tadpole - improved loops than in our previous analysis  @xcite . using the new scales",
    "shifts our final result up by only a third of a standard deviation , but the dispersion between results from different short - distance quantities is decreased from @xmath215 to  0.2 .",
    "any high - precision determination of @xmath5 based upon lattice qcd simulations has to address several key issues :    * _ finite - lattice - spacing errors : _ errors due to the finite lattice - spacing can enter in two ways .",
    "first they affect lattice determinations of the physical quantity or quantities used to set the scale of the coupling .",
    "in our analysis we use simulation values for @xmath85 , from the static - quark potential , to determine ratios of scales from different configuration sets , and simulation values for the @xmath10@xmath11 mass difference to set the overall scale  @xcite . in each case",
    "we use data from multiple lattice spacings to bound finite-@xmath6 errors , which are small because we use highly - improved discretizations in our simulations .",
    "the second source of finite-@xmath6 errors , for some analyses ( but not ours ) , is the lattice determination of the short - distance quantity that is compared with perturbation theory ( to extract  @xmath5 ) .",
    "a short - distance quantity that is defined in continuum qcd  for example , changes @xmath216 in the static - quark potential for small @xmath217s  @xcite , or current - current correlators for @xmath8-quark currents  @xcite  will have finite-@xmath6 errors that must be included in the final error analysis .",
    "the use of multiple lattice spacings is again important .",
    "this is not an issue for us here because we analyze our short - distance quantities using lattice qcd perturbation theory , which treats finite-@xmath6 effects exactly ( that is , to all orders in  @xmath6 , order - by - order in @xmath69 ) .",
    "both the simulation results and the perturbation theory for our 22  short - distance quantities are free of finite-@xmath6 errors .",
    "this greatly facilitates our use of results from multiple lattice spacings to bound uncalculated higher - order terms from perturbation theory .",
    "* _ truncation errors from perturbation theory : _ the coupling is determined by comparing perturbation theory with ( nonperturbative ) simulation results for a short - distance quantity . generally the perturbation theory is known through only a few low orders in  @xmath5 . the error analysis for",
    "any determination of the coupling must account for the uncalculated ( but certainly present ) terms from higher - order perturbation theory .",
    "we not only account for the possibility of higher - order terms ( through tenth order ) , using our bayesian priors , but also attempt to estimate the size of these corrections by comparing values of our short - distance quantities at five different momentum scales  @xmath62 , corresponding to our five lattice spacings . we find sizable contributions from high - order terms , particularly for @xmath63s : leaving them out would shift our final result for the coupling down by one to two standard deviations ( and lead to poor fits for most of our short - distance quantities ) .",
    "the agreement between our 22  different short - distance quantities , some with very different perturbative expansions ( see section  [ sec : perturbation_theory ] ) , is important evidence that we have analyzed truncation errors correctly . * _ sea - quark vacuum polarization : _ in our previous analysis  @xcite , we showed that the coupling is quite sensitive to contributions from the vacuum polarization of sea quarks : @xmath200 is 30% smaller when all quark vacuum polarization is omitted .",
    "it is therefore important to include vacuum polarization from all three light quarks .",
    "vacuum polarization corrections from heavy quarks ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath218 ) can be computed using perturbation theory , but light quarks ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) can only be incorporated nonperturbatively . in the past",
    "we have used simulations with fewer than three light - quarks and extrapolated to @xmath21 ( @xmath219 appears to be reasonably linear in @xmath220 )  @xcite . here ( and in our earlier paper  @xcite ) contributions from all three light - quarks are included in the configurations provided to us by the milc collaboration .",
    "we also account for the small but ( barely ) measurable dependence upon the sea - quark masses . *",
    "_ other lattice and nonperturbative artifacts : _ usually one must worry about the finite volume of the lattice in a qcd simulation .",
    "our wilson loops , however , are about as ultraviolet singular as is possible on a lattice , and so are completely insensitive to the volumes of our lattices ( 2.5fm across ) .",
    "another issue , for continuum as well as lattice determinations of the coupling , is the possibility of nonperturbative contributions to the short - distance quantity .",
    "our quantities are sufficiently short - distance that we do not expect appreciable nonperturbative contamination .",
    "we nevertheless allowed for nonperturbative contributions from both gluons and quarks .",
    "the expected size of nonperturbative contributions varies widely over our set of 22  different short - distance quantities and 6  different lattice spacings .",
    "the excellent agreement among all of our results is strong evidence that we understand these systematic errors .    in this ( and our previous ) paper",
    ", we have addressed all of these issues .",
    "we have extended our earlier analysis of the strong coupling constant from wilson loops in lattice qcd ( and hadronic spectroscopy ) to include results from 22  different short - distance quantities computed on 12  different lattices , with 6  distinct lattice spacings and a variety of sea - quark masses .",
    "we extracted a new value for the qcd coupling by comparing these @xmath221 different pieces of simulation data , varying by a factor of seven in momentum scales ( @xmath62 from  2.1 to  14.7gev ) , with perturbation theory .",
    "our result , @xmath222 , is in excellent agreement with our previous result from wilson loops  @xcite , 0.1170(12 ) , and also with non - lattice determinations : for example , the world averages 0.1176(20 ) from  @xcite and 0.1189(10 ) from  @xcite .",
    "our new result also agrees well with our very recent result , 0.1174(12 ) , from current - current correlators computed using lattice qcd  @xcite .",
    "while they are derived from the wilson loops , our creutz ratios and tadpole - improved loops provide coupling - constant information that is independent from that coming from the loops directly .",
    "this is because the highly ultraviolet contributions that dominate the loops largely cancel in the other quantities , making the latter more infrared .",
    "consequently both perturbative and nonperturbative behavior differs significantly from quantity to quantity .",
    "this is particularly true of the sensitivity to nonperturbative contributions : for example , our most infrared creutz ratios are more than 100 times more sensitive to gluon condensates than our most ultraviolet loops . that all of our quantities agree on the coupling ( figure  [ fig : almz - results ] ) is strong evidence that we understand the systematic errors involved .",
    "the close agreement of our results with non - lattice determinations of the coupling is a compelling quantitative demonstration that the perturbative qcd of jets , and the qcd of lattice simulations , which encompass both perturbative and nonperturbative phenomena , are the same theory .",
    "it is also further evidence that the simulation methods we use are valid .",
