    "transiting planets have attracted much recent attention thanks to their ability to characterize planetary orbits , atmospheres , and evolution history . in particular , the _ kepler _ spacecraft @xcite has yielded a wide variety of planetary systems including notably unique ones ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "one nuisance concerning searches for transiting planets is that transit photometry is often contaminated by background / foreground sources , and such contaminators are sometimes responsible for the periodic light - curve depressions that mimic planetary transits ( so - called false positives ) . according to the recent statistical study , the false positive rate for kepler objects of interest ( koi ) is estimated to be @xmath5 depending on the size of planet candidates @xcite .",
    "the false positive rate becomes vanishingly small when we focus only on multiple transiting systems @xcite , but it is still necessary for their confirmations to use independent techniques such as radial velocity ( rv ) measurements or transit timing variations ( ttvs ) .    in this paper , we present a global analysis for koi-977 , one of the planet - host candidates reported by _ kepler",
    "_ @xcite with a goal of confirming the planetary nature of koi-977.01 . kepler input catalog ( kic ) reports that koi-977 ( kic 11192141 ) is an evolved star ( giant ) with the effective temperature of @xmath6 k and surface gravity of @xmath7 .",
    "later studies confirmed koi-977 to be a red giant from a medium - resolution spectroscopy in the near infrared region @xcite or photometric analysis @xcite .",
    "contrary to the situation for main sequence stars , only a few hot jupiters are so far reported around evolved stars in spite of many dedicated rv surveys for those stars .",
    "the lack of close - in planets is often attributed to the outcome of tidal interactions , but there has been a debate on this paucity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this context , a detection or non - detection of a hot jupiter around koi-977 should become an important constraint on the occurrence rate and/or tidal evolution of giant planets around evolved stars .    with a quick look at the light - curve for koi-977",
    ", we noticed that the light - curve folded with koi-977.01 s period ( figure [ fig : phasebest ] ) shows a clear pattern of well - known flux modulations by ellipsoidal variation and emission / reflected light from koi-977.01 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "indeed , giants / subgiants are ideal targets for phase - curve analyses since the amplitude of ellipsoidal variation is approximately proportional to the cube of stellar radius ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the short orbital period of koi-977.01 ( @xmath8 days ) , along with the moderate transit depth ( @xmath9 mmag ) , makes this system an interesting target for further observations / analyses .",
    "our global analysis involves spectroscopic and asteroseismic determinations of host star s properties , rv measurements , and light - curve analysis of the public _",
    "data for koi-977 . in sections",
    "[ s : obs ] and [ s : seismology ] , we show via spectroscopy and asteroseismology that the most luminous object in koi-977 is indeed a red giant in the red clump , but its estimated radius is much larger than the estimated semi - major axis of koi-977.01 , inferred from kepler s third law . the observed rvs taken by high dispersion spectrograph ( hds ) on the subaru 8.2 m telescope",
    "show a small variation , and the best - fit model suggests a very eccentric orbit , which is incompatible with the phase - folded light - curve for koi-977.01 ( section [ s : obs ] ) .",
    "therefore , we are obliged to conclude that koi-977.01 is likely a false positive , meaning that the pulsating giant ( for which we took rvs ) is different from the object yielding the transit - like signal ( i.e. , eclipsing binary ) .",
    "based on this assumption , we present the light - curve analysis in order to put a constraint on the properties of the eclipsing binary in section [ s : model ] . employing the evil - mc model by @xcite with some revisions",
    ", we simultaneously model the phase - curve variation ( i.e. , ellipsoidal variation , doppler boosting , and emission / reflected light from the companion ) and transit / eclipse light - curve .",
    "section [ s : discussion ] is devoted to discussion and summary .",
    "we conducted spectroscopic observations on ( ut ) 2013 june 29 , july 1 , and 2014 july 13 , 14 with subaru / hds and obtained rvs for koi-977 .",
    "we employed the ",
    "i2b \" setup in the 2013 campaign and  i2a \" setup in 2014 with image slicer # 2 , with which we can achieve a spectral resolution of @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "the spectra for rv measurements were taken with the iodine ( i@xmath11 ) cell for a precise wavelength calibration .",
    "on july 12 ( 2014 ) , we also took high signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) spectra without the i@xmath11 cell for an rv template as well as to estimate basic spectroscopic parameters .",
    "the raw spectra were reduced by the standard iraf procedure ; they were bias - subtracted , flat - fielded , and subjected to the scattered light subtraction before extracting one - dimensional spectra .",
    "all spectra were subjected to the wavelength calibration by th - ar emission spectra taken during the twilights , but for the exposures with i@xmath11 cell , these rough wavelength solutions were later recalibrated based on i@xmath11 absorption lines for a more precise calibration for the rv measurement @xcite . the resulting snr for koi-977",
    "was typically @xmath12 per pixel around sodium d lines .",
    "following the rv analysis pipeline by @xcite , we compute the rvs for koi-977 .",
    "first , we estimate the instrumental profile ( ip ) for the night during which the stellar template spectrum was taken , from the flat - lamp spectrum transmitted through the i@xmath11 cell .",
    "we then deconvolve the high snr template with the ip and extract the intrinsic stellar spectrum .",
    "each of the observed spectra with the i@xmath11 cell is modeled and fitted using this intrinsic spectrum with the relative rv and other relevant parameters describing the observed spectrum ( e.g. , those for ip and relative depth of the i@xmath11 absorption lines ) being free .",
    "the result is summarized in table [ tab : rv ] ; the rv precision ( statistical error ) is typically @xmath13 m s@xmath14 . since the i@xmath11-cell rv technique only gives relative rvs , we roughly estimated the absolute stellar rv with respect to the barycenter of the solar system from the position of h-@xmath15 line as @xmath16 km s@xmath14 .",
    "we here adopt the dartmouth isochrone model @xcite since this model also gives the absolute magnitude in the _ kepler _ band ( @xmath17 ) for an arbitrary stellar mass , so that we can directly compare the contrast between koi-977a and 977b . allowing @xmath18 and @xmath19 to vary , we minimized equation ( [ eq : chi_mass ] ) and estimated the stellar parameters of koi-977b and koi-977.01 for each case of @xmath3 . for simplicity",
    ", we fix the metallicity and age at @xmath20=0.07 $ ] and 3.25 gyrs , respectively , and use the corresponding single isochrone when we convert the mass into radius . table [ tab :",
    "binary ] summarizes the result of our fit .",
    "for all cases of @xmath3 , our fit indicates that koi-977b and koi-977.01 are late - f and early - m dwarfs , respectively .",
    "figure [ fig : hrdiagram ] plots the dartmouth isochrone ( black line ) on the hr diagram , for @xmath20=0.07 $ ] and @xmath21 gyrs .",
    "the locations of koi-977a , 977b , and 977.01 are plotted by the triangle , circles , and squares , respectively .",
    "different colors for koi-977b and 977.01 mean different @xmath3 , with red , blue , and green corresponding to @xmath22 , 30 , and 20 , respectively .",
    "the _ kepler _ absolute magnitude for the best - fit model of koi-977a is @xmath23 , while those for koi-977b and 977.01 are listed in table [ tab : binary ] .",
    "the differences in @xmath17 for koi-977a and 977b are translated into the dilution factors of @xmath24 , and 71 for the assumed @xmath3 of 37 , 30 , and 20 , respectively . comparing these values , we speculate that the true dilution factor @xmath3 should be located between 20 and 30 ( closer to 30 ) .",
    "it is possible to fit the light - curve for various @xmath3 and iteratively estimate the stellar parameters of koi-977b and 977.01 through the isochrone , or more directly to perform a more global analysis with @xmath3 being free .",
    "however , the calculation above is based on a rather strong assumption that koi-977a and the eclipsing binary are bound to each other composing a triple system , so that we do not try such an analysis here .",
    "the confirmation of the companion and its common proper motion by future direct imaging is important in order to apply the above discussion .",
    "we will also be able to discuss the physical association between koi-977a and 977b by measuring the absolute rv of koi-977b with a near infrared spectroscopy using adaptive optics , and comparing the value with koi-977a s absolute rv .",
    "one remaining issue on the above scenario is that the phase - folded light - curve shows an asymmetric flux maximum that can not be explained by doppler boosting . our empirical treatment adopting a phase - shift in the emission / reflection of",
    "the secondary resulted in a westward phase - shift of @xmath25 , which is acceptable for a close - in giant planet ( or brown dwarf ) with an inhomogeneous cloud coverage on the surface @xcite .",
    "however , this is only the case when the surface is relatively cool ( @xmath26 k ) so that the surface cloud could be generated .",
    "our analysis for the case that koi-977 is a triple system indicates that koi-977.01 is an early m star with @xmath27 k , which is too hot to form a surface cloud .",
    "in addition , the magnitude of phase - shift ( @xmath28 ) is too large for a stellar secondary .        in order to gain a more insight into",
    "the asymmetric observed flux , we phase - fold the observed light - curves with only five consecutive quarters instead of using the whole data .",
    "figure [ fig : lcqdiff ] shows the comparison among the folded light - curves for different epochs .",
    "the red circles , green triangles , and blue squares respectively represent the folded ( and binned ) fluxes for q1q5 , q6q10 , and q11q15 .",
    "this figure suggests that even if we fold the light - curve of a relatively long span ( @xmath29 days ) , the folded flux can vary significantly ; while folded light - curves for q1q5 and q6q10 exhibit the same feature ( higher flux values at @xmath30 ) as in figure [ fig : phasebest ] , the one for q11-q15 looks very different and the flux peaks at @xmath30 and @xmath31 have approximately the same height .",
    "this variation of folded fluxes suggests that the impact of stellar pulsation may not be completely canceled out by phase - folding with a timescale of a few years .",
    "this seems likely especially since the amplitude of koi-977a s pulsation is @xmath32 ( see figure [ fig : sc ] ) , which is ten times greater than the amplitude of koi-977b s ellipsoidal variation .",
    "therefore , we suspect that the higher peak at @xmath33 in figure [ fig : phasebest ] is not astrophysical , arising from an imperfect removal of stellar pulsation .    if the higher peak at @xmath30 is indeed an artifact ( i.e. , unphysical ) , the second term in the right - hand side of equation ( [ eq : planetlight ] ) should be interpreted as an empirical correction term ( by a sinusoidal fit ) for the residual of koi-977a s pulsation .",
    "a longer - term monitoring would uncover the origin of the apparent flux asymmetry in the observed data .",
    "it should be emphasized that the systematic errors arising from this artifact ( e.g. , in @xmath34 ) is much smaller than the uncertainty by the imperfect knowledge on @xmath3 ( table [ tab : bestfit ] ) , and our conclusion that the eclipsing binary is likely comprised of f and m dwarfs is not affected by the observed apparent asymmetry in the light - curve .",
    "our analysis has clarified that koi-977.01 is very likely a false positive , suggesting that the pulsating giant koi-977a is different from the eclipsing binary that produces transit - like signals .",
    "however , our technique which combines the information from spectroscopy , asteroseismology , and light - curve analysis ( transit , ellipsoidal variation , etc ) was initially developed for a planet confirmation and its characterization . in fitting ellipsoidal variations , parameters such as @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath34 often have a degeneracy , and different sets of the parameters yield similar light - curves ( see e.g. , equation ( 2 ) in * ? ? ?",
    "this degeneracy could be resolved by combining the phase - curve modeling with rv measurements and/or transit fits ( for transiting systems ) .",
    "basic stellar parameters estimated by asteroseismology and/or spectroscopy would further help to characterize the systems ( e.g. , ages and stellar obliquities ) .",
    "we hope to present somewhere else a new report of planet discoveries by the global analysis developed here .",
