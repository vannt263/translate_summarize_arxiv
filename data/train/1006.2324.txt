    "the coupling constants are the following g_ff&=&4k_fa_ff , g_bf&=&2k_fa_bf(1 + ) , and we deal with six independent parameters in the system : number of bosons @xmath0 , chemical potential of fermi sub - system @xmath12 , ratio of the masses @xmath25 , scattering lengths @xmath26 and @xmath27 and radius @xmath28 of the 3d volume we consider .    in the 3d case the coupling constant @xmath6 in @xmath29 [ eq .

    "however , when the considerable interactions are turned on it becomes energetically favorable to separate bosons and fermions , the @xmath58 is depleted around the center and bosons form a bound state localized in small area around @xmath59 .",

    "the interaction of fermions and the _ impurity _ bose particles influences the pairing function @xmath29 only locally , see fig .",

    "three ] we show the average radius of the bose cloud @xmath62 and the standard deviation @xmath48 as a function of the coupling constant @xmath7 .",
    "the self - localization means that both @xmath62 and @xmath63 are much smaller than the radius of the 3d volume .",
    "one can see that there is a critical non - zero value of @xmath7 leading to the self - localization .",
    "this critical @xmath7 is different from the critical value for the instability of the homogeneous solution ( i.e. phase separation condition ) .",
    "the latter , for the case without boson - boson interactions , corresponds to @xmath33 .",
    "if we replace the sodium atoms by @xmath50li atoms , it turns out that the critical value of @xmath7 for the self - localization increases .",
    "this is , because compressing the cloud of light lithium particles costs more energy than in the case of heavier sodium atoms .",
    "a small non - zero temperature mostly affects superfluidity and has little effect on the self - localization phenomenon .",
    "indeed , in fig .  [",

    "the density of such fermions , contrary to the localized fermion pair , possesses a minimum at @xmath86 and thus effectively makes the potential well for bosons weaker .",

    "we do not observe the self - localization for attractive boson - fermion interactions in the 3d case . in this context",
    "the self - localization requires sufficiently strong boson - fermion interactions .",
    "however , for strong attractive interactions no metastable state of the system exists and the densities of the atoms collapse to dirac - delta distributions indicating a breakdown of the description with the contact interaction potentials . in the 1d case",
    "there is no collapse for attractive boson - fermion interactions .",
    "the self - localization of bosons is accompanied by localization of a pair of fermions at the bottom of the fermi sea .",
    "this phenomenon can be described by a simple model where the self - localization is related to the existence of a vector soliton solution .    to realize experimentally the self - localization of bosons in a fermi system , ultra - cold clouds of bosons and fermions have to be prepared in a laboratory .",
    "for a sufficiently large boson - fermion coupling constant , that can be achieved by means of a feshbach resonance , the self - localization takes place .",
    "signatures of the self - localization can be visible in expansion of the atomic clouds after trapping potentials are turned off .",
    "that is , if during the time of flight the boson - fermion interactions are kept negligibly weak , the initially strongly localized boson cloud will show much faster expansion than the fermi cloud due to release of a large kinetic energy . the simplest experiment would employ a fermi sub - system in a normal phase . in order to observe the self - localization in a superfluid fermi mixture a manipulation of a fermion - fermion coupling constant",
