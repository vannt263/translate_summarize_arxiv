    "the structure and properties of accretion disks around non - magnetic compact objects in close binaries are primarily determined by the rate at which matter is supplied by the roche  lobe filling donor star .",
    "if this rate is smaller than a critical value @xmath5 , the disk is subject to a thermal  viscous instability and undergoes a limit cycle evolution alternating between a hot and a cool state , the outburst and quiescent phases .",
    "this model has been successfully applied to dwarf nova outbursts in cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) , where the accretor is a white dwarf ( wd ) ( for reviews see , e.g. , cannizzo 1993 ; osaki 1996 ) , and also to x  ray transient outbursts in low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) , where the accretor is a neutron star or a black hole ( for reviews see , e.g. , lasota 1996 ; wheeler 1998 ) .    in the case of lmxbs , where the accretion efficiency and hence the x - ray luminosity from the compact object is higher than in cvs , there is strong evidence that self  irradiation is important ( see , e.g. , van  paradijs & mcclintock 1994 ; king & ritter 1998 ) .",
    "x  ray irradiation from the central accretor raises the disk temperature for a given mass transfer rate , thereby suppressing the instability . as a consequence , @xmath5 is significantly smaller in lmxbs than in cvs , consistent with observations ( van  paradijs 1996 ) .",
    "the strength of the irradiation in lmxbs depends on the nature of the compact object . in the neutron ",
    "star case , the irradiating source is equivalent to a point source at the center of the disk , while , in the black  hole case , the lack of a hard stellar surface implies that the irradiating source is only the innermost disk , which is weaker by a factor about equal to the relative disk thickness , the other system parameters being constant ( king , kolb , & szuskiewicz 1997 ) .",
    "disk irradiation has important consequences for short  period lmxbs .",
    "these systems evolve towards shorter orbital periods @xmath6 under the influence of orbital angular momentum losses @xmath7 ( henceforth `` j  driven '' systems ) , caused by a magnetic stellar wind from the donor star ( magnetic braking ) or by gravitational radiation . assuming that @xmath8 from magnetic braking ( mb ) is independent of the nature of the accretor",
    ", the same orbital braking formalism must apply for both cvs and lmxbs . for a given mb law ,",
    "i.e. , for a given dependence of @xmath7 on binary parameters , the mass transfer rate ( proportional to the fractional angular momentum loss rate ) is smaller in black  hole binaries than in neutron  star binaries , as the total angular momentum increases with primary mass .",
    "this , together with the higher values for @xmath5 , leads to transient behavior for all j  driven black  hole binaries , as observed .",
    "the converse appears to be true for neutron",
    " star systems",
    ". the mb transfer rate may be up to two orders of magnitude larger than @xmath5 ( king , kolb , & burderi 1996 ) , suggesting that there are no or only very few neutron star transients .",
    "however , it is clear from observations that the fraction of transients among short  period neutron  star lmxbs is non  negligible .",
    "five out of 23 lmxbs with a confirmed or possible neutron star primary and with periods in the range @xmath9 are classified as transient ( ritter & kolb 1998 ) .",
    "although it is difficult to estimate the _ intrinsic _ value of this fraction , it may be even larger than @xmath10 ( see  5.1 below ) .",
    "a possible resolution of this apparent contradiction between the disk - instability model and the observations has been suggested by king , kolb , & burderi ( 1996 ) and king & kolb ( 1997 , hereafter kk97 ) .",
    "the mass transfer rates in j  driven lmxbs with somewhat evolved donor stars ( close to the end of core",
    " hydrogen burning ) , are significantly smaller than in systems with unevolved donors , therefore favoring transient behavior .",
    "then the large observed transient fraction demands that the contribution of these evolved systems to the total population is correspondingly large . under the assumption of spherically symmetric supernovae ( sn ) and for strong magnetic braking at high ( @xmath11 ) donor star masses",
    ", kk97 showed that lmxbs forming via the standard evolutionary channel involving a helium star supernova ( sutantyo 1975 ; van den heuvel 1983 ) do indeed have this property .",
    "however , for weaker magnetic braking ( constrained by rotational velocity data for f stars ) , kalogera & webbink ( 1998 ; hereafter kw98 ) showed that j  driven lmxbs form only if supernovae are asymmetric .",
    "kk97 also showed , in a qualitative way , that asymmetric sne with on average large kick velocities imparted to the neutron stars would inevitably lead to a large number of unevolved systems in the population , and hence a small number of transient systems among the short - period lmxb population , contrary to observations .",
    "this qualitative conclusion by kk97 appears to be in contradiction to numerous pieces of evidence for the existence of rather substantial kick velocities ( kaspi et al .",
    "1996 ; hansen & phinney 1997 ; lorimer , bailes , & harrison 1997 ; fryer & kalogera 1997 ; fryer , burrows , & benz 1998 ) , so the need for a quantitative study of the problem arises . the formation of lmxbs including the effect of natal neutron ",
    "star kicks has been studied in detail by kw98 . here , we use these detailed synthesis models to address the issue of the transient fraction among lmxbs and investigate its dependence on different evolutionary parameters .",
    "the increase of this fraction in the model populations is accompanied by an increase of the fraction of systems with donors that have evolved beyond the main sequence , i.e. , of long  period systems driven by nuclear expansion of the secondary ( `` n  driven '' systems ) .",
    "our goal is twofold : first , to disentangle the differential dependences on model parameters of the two observable quantities , the predicted fraction of `` j  driven '' systems among all lmxbs and the predicted transient fraction among `` j  driven '' lmxbs .",
    "second , to constrain quantitatively the input parameters by requiring that both predicted fractions are consistent with current observations .",
    "these two observational constraints operate in opposite directions , and this allows us to derive limits on the mean magnitude of natal kicks imparted to neutron stars , the strength of magnetic braking , and the efficiency with which orbital energy is consumed during the common envelope phase prior to the supernova . as the observational sample increases in the future , the model calculations presented here can be used to tighten these constraints still further .    in  2",
    ", we review the evolutionary picture of j  driven lmxbs and derive a simplified criterion for transient behavior . in  3 , we describe the different models for lmxb formation considered here , while the results and basic effects of varying model parameters are presented in  4 . in  5 , we first (  5.1 ) describe the observed sample and derive the observational constraints , and then (  5.2 ) evaluate the models based on these constraints .",
    "we conclude in  6 with a discussion of our results and of possible extensions of the present study .",
    "in the context of the thermal  viscous instability model , transient behavior occurs when the average mass transfer rate from the donor to the disk is lower than a critical rate , @xmath5 , so that hydrogen is not ionized at the outer disk rim . as shown in king , kolb , & szuszkiewicz ( 1997 ) under reasonable assumptions for various disk properties , the critical transfer rate for lmxbs",
    "can be approximated by 6 10 ^ -12 m_ns^5/6 m_d^-1/6 p_h^4/3 ^-1 [ 3.0 ] ( see their eq.[7 ] , scaled appropriately for irradiation in neutron star systems ) , where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the neutron and donor star masses , @xmath14 and @xmath15 , in solar units , and @xmath16 the orbital period in hours .    in general , the secular mean",
    "mass  transfer rate is determined by the rate of angular momentum loss from the system , the donor s nuclear expansion rate , and the radius  mass exponents , @xmath17 , i.e. , the logarithmic derivatives of the donor and roche  lobe radii with respect to mass ( see , e.g. , webbink 1985 , ritter 1996 ) . for j  driven systems , angular momentum losses dominate over nuclear evolution .",
    "the mean mass transfer rate for such systems is = , [ 3.2 ] ( e.g. , ritter 1996 ) , where the thermal equilibrium radius  mass exponent is @xmath18 , the roche ",
    "lobe exponent is @xmath19 ( for conservative mass transfer ) , and @xmath20 is the orbital angular momentum .",
    "the angular momentum loss rate , @xmath7 , is the sum of the loss rate due to magnetic braking , @xmath21 , and due to gravitational wave radiation , @xmath22 .",
    "typically , magnetic braking is more efficient than gravitational radiation by about two orders of magnitude at binary periods of a few hours .",
    "neither the strength of magnetic braking nor its functional dependence on stellar and binary parameters is known from first principles .",
    "there are as many different suggested mb laws as attempts to model the magnetohydrodynamic problem ( e.g. , verbunt 1984 ; mestel & spruit 1987 ; kawaler 1988 ; tout & pringle 1992 ; zangrilli , tout , & bianchini 1997 ) .",
    "for this reason , an empirical law ( verbunt & zwaan 1981 ) derived from rotational velocity data of isolated g stars as a function of time ( skumanich 1972 ) has usually been used .",
    "application of magnetic braking to the evolution of close binaries , however , requires the extrapolation of this empirical law to stars with a different mass and a much more rapid rotation .    adopting a skumanich - type parameterization of the magnetic braking law , @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the orbital angular velocity and @xmath25 the donor s moment of inertia",
    ", the fractional angular momentum loss rate can be expressed as :  =  - _ 0 b(m_d ) m_d^ r_d^ p^-10/3 , where @xmath26 is a normalization constant , @xmath27 is a mass - dependent efficiency factor , and @xmath28 is the radius of the secondary .",
    "the free parameters @xmath29 and @xmath30 , which are believed to be of order unity , allow for a different overall mass and radius  dependence . assuming that the empirical mb law is universal , i.e. , it is applicable to cvs and lmxbs alike , and that the cv period gap is caused by a discontinuous drop of @xmath21 to zero at the upper edge of the gap , it is then possible to calibrate the strength of magnetic braking , i.e. , fix @xmath26 at @xmath31 , so that the width and location of the observed period gap is reproduced in the models ( e.g. , kolb 1996 ; kolb & baraffe 1998 ) . in stars more massive than @xmath32 , the outer convective envelope , thought to sustain the stellar magnetic field ,",
    "gradually disappears and magnetic braking must become less efficient .",
    "for the extrapolation of the mb law to these higher masses , one can derive a mass  dependent efficiency , @xmath27 , to reproduce the mean rotational velocities of stars of spectral type f0 and f5 ( kw98 ) .    given the above normalizations",
    ", the strength of magnetic braking at periods longer than a few hours is determined by the dependences on stellar radius and orbital period . for a binary with a given secondary mass",
    ", we can show that the magnetic braking strength decreases with increasing degree of nuclear evolution of the donor at the onset of mass transfer . using equations ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) , and ( 3 ) , and the fact that in a semi ",
    "detached binary the orbital period is inversely proportional to the square root of the donor s mean density , i.e. , @xmath33 at a fixed @xmath15 , we obtain r_d^-7 [ mdotratio ] for the ratio of the mean transfer rate from the donor to the critical rate for disk instability . if @xmath34 , which holds for mb laws derived both empirically and from first - principle calculations ( e.g. , verbunt & zwaan 1981 ; rappaport , verbunt , & joss 1983 ; mestel & spruit 1987 ) , then at fixed donor mass the ratio @xmath35 decreases with increasing stellar radius , hence with orbital period at roche  lobe overflow .",
    "it is therefore lower for donors that have evolved significantly away from the zero  age main sequence .",
    "these systems are thus prone to transient behavior .",
    "a measure of the degree of nuclear evolution of a star is the ratio @xmath36 , i.e. , the age of the donor in units of its main  sequence lifetime , @xmath37 .",
    "secondaries of j  driven systems are still on the main sequence and hence correspond to @xmath38 . from relation ( [ mdotratio ] ) it follows that transient behavior in a binary can occur if the value of @xmath39 exceeds some critical value @xmath40 close to unity .",
    "an accurate estimate of @xmath40 requires detailed models of the evolution of systems with moderately evolved secondaries of different initial masses and for different mb laws .",
    "such sequences are computationally demanding and beyond the scope of this study . the few such computations that have been published ( pylyser & savonije 1988 , 1989 ; singer , kolb , & ritter 1993 ; see also ritter 1994 ) indicate that only stars with @xmath41 , i.e. , close to the end of core  hydrogen burning , lead to transfer rates lower than @xmath5 . therefore ,",
    "in our discussion of the models , we avoid quantifying @xmath42 and treat it as a free parameter .",
    "however , when comparing to observations , we assume for simplicity that there is a global value @xmath42 characterizing the transient population ( i.e.  we neglect its mass dependence and assume that during the secular evolution @xmath42 does not change ) , @xmath43 .",
    "evolution of binaries with initially extreme mass ratios through a common - envelope phase and the supernova explosion of a helium star is thought to be the main evolutionary channel leading to lmxb formation .",
    "a detailed quantitative study of this channel , taking into account the complete set of structural and evolutionary constraints imposed on the lmxb progenitors as well as the effect of natal neutron star kicks , has been presented by kw98 ( see also terman , taam , & savage 1996 ) .",
    "results of these calculations include predicted model distributions of nascent ( at the onset of mass transfer ) lmxbs over donor mass and orbital period . here , we extend these calculations for a set of different magnetic braking laws and use the resulting lmxb distributions to calculate two quantities that quantitatively describe the j - driven lmxb population and the transient systems among them . for a description of the input distributions to the synthesis models , the relevant constraints on the population , the semi - analytic synthesis method used , and the dependence of some of the results on the model parameters , we refer to the extensive discussion in kw98 .    for our purposes",
    "here we focus on the following two diagnostic quantities :    \\(i ) the fraction , @xmath0 , of j  driven systems among the total neutron ",
    "star lmxb population .",
    "detailed calculations ( pylyser & savonije 1988 , 1989 ) of the secular evolution of a few systems in the mass range of interest here have shown that j  driven and n  driven systems are separated by a critical `` bifurcation '' period , @xmath44 , which in detail depends on the donor mass and on the magnetic braking strength .",
    "guided by the results of pylyser & savonije ( 1988 , 1989 ) , we adopt a mass - independent critical period of @xmath45h ( see also  5.1 ) .",
    "an alternative definition of @xmath0 , as the fraction of systems with donors on the main sequence at the onset of mass transfer , gives essentially the same quantitative results ( within just a few per cent ) .",
    "\\(ii ) the normalized cumulative distribution over @xmath39 of systems with donors on the main sequence and masses below @xmath46m@xmath47 , i.e. , the fraction @xmath48 of j  driven systems with donors that are more evolved than @xmath42 , as a function of @xmath42 . as is clear from the discussion in  2 , we identify this fraction , for an appropriate value of @xmath42 , with the transient fraction among short ",
    "period lmxbs .",
    "the upper limit for the donor mass arises because we require that the system is stable against thermal  timescale mass transfer . in the case of conservative mass transfer",
    ", this limit is @xmath49 ( with @xmath50 ) , while in the case of eddington  limited mass transfer ( kalogera & webbink 1996 ) it is @xmath51 .    in the following sections , we study the dependence of the above two quantities on the various unknown model parameters .",
    "model assumptions regarding the birth rate of primordial binaries with extreme mass ratios ( of relevance to lmxb formation ) have been shown ( kw98 ) to affect essentially only the predicted _ absolute _ birth rate of the lmxb population and not its distribution over binary parameters .",
    "since both of the above diagnostic quantities are ratios of birth rates , they are not affected by differences in the absolute normalization .    for the treatment of the common - envelope phase ( for a review see iben & livio 1993 )",
    ", we adopt the simplified parametrization of orbital shrinkage based on the common  envelope efficiency , @xmath52 .",
    "this is the efficiency with which orbital energy is deposited in the common envelope , causing it to become gravitationally unbound ( for the exact definition used here , see kw98 ) .",
    "we investigate models with high ( @xmath53 ) and low ( @xmath54 ) efficiency .",
    "a major event in the evolution of lmxb progenitors is the explosion of the primary as a supernova .",
    "studies of a wide variety of neutron star systems , single and binary radio pulsars , and x  ray binaries , have provided strong evidence that kicks , probably associated with some asymmetry in the explosion , are imparted to neutron stars at birth . however ,",
    "the distribution of these kicks in magnitude and direction is not yet known ; we assume it is gaussian in each of the three velocity components , which leads to isotropic kicks with a maxwellian distribution in magnitude .",
    "we investigate models with r.m.s .",
    "velocities @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58kms@xmath2 .",
    "finally , we consider three different formulations for magnetic braking , which we label mb1 , mb2 and mb3 .",
    "mb1 ( `` strong '' mb ) follows the description by verbunt & zwaan ( 1981 ) , has been used by kk97 , and is given by :  =  - 1.810 ^ -5  r_d^4  p_h^-10/3  yr^-1 , where @xmath59 is the donor s radius in solar units .",
    "mb2 ( `` weak '' mb ) follows rappaport , verbunt , & joss ( 1983 ) and is given by :  =  - 6.910 ^ -6  r_d^2  p_h^-10/3  yr^-1 .",
    "both expressions are widely used in studies of cv and lmxb evolution .",
    "they are in reasonable agreement with the normalization that reproduces the cv period gap . for the extrapolation of the above laws to masses",
    "higher than @xmath60m@xmath47 , we consider two variations of them , labeled as a and b. we adopt either a discontinuous drop to zero at @xmath61 ( laws mb1a and mb2a ) , or a gradual decline for @xmath62 with @xmath63 ( law mb1b ) and @xmath64 ( law mb2b ) .",
    "the latter law was adopted by kw98 , and details about the derivation of @xmath27 are described in that paper .",
    "we also investigate a third law , mb3 , which simply assumes that magnetic braking is restricted to semi ",
    "detached binaries only . in this case",
    ", unstable disk accretion still requires the donor to be close to the end of core  hydrogen burning , while in the _ detached _ phase prior to lmxb formation and after the sn explosion , angular momentum is lost only via gravitational radiation , at a rate  =  - 1.2510 ^ -8  m_d  p_h^-8/3  yr^-1 .",
    "( e.g. , landau & lifshitz 1951 ) .",
    "the physical motivation for this choice is that the donors in detached binaries need not necessarily be in corotation .",
    "then magnetic braking just brakes the donor s spin , not the orbital motion . clearly , mb3 is a somewhat artificial and extreme case included here only to show the effect of negligible magnetic braking on the two diagnostic quantities , @xmath0 and @xmath65 .    in figure",
    "[ mblaws ] , we plot @xmath66 for all five cases as a function of donor mass for donors on the zero - age main sequence ( @xmath67 ; @xmath68 ) . in the regime @xmath69 , mb1a is much stronger than mb2a because of the stronger dependence on @xmath28 .",
    "in contrast , the laws mb1b and mb2b are similar for @xmath62 as the braking efficiency factors @xmath70 were obtained to fit the same rotational velocities of f stars .",
    "for a set of different models , where the r.m.s .",
    "kick magnitude , the common envelope efficiency , and the magnetic braking law were varied , we calculate the two diagnostic quantities , @xmath0 and @xmath65 ( see  3 ) , for the nascent lmxb population . the dependence of the two quantities on the varying model parameters can be quite strong ; in this section we discuss the various trends as we vary each of the parameters separately and try to understand the origin of the effects .    _",
    "average kick magnitude .",
    "_ natal neutron star kicks affect the lmxb population primarily in two ways ( hills 1983 ; brandt & podsiadlowski 1995 ; kalogera 1996 ) : ( i ) systems that would have been disrupted in their absence remain bound , and ( ii ) post - sn orbital separations smaller than the pre - sn ones are allowed and can actually be more abundant in the post - sn separation distribution .",
    "both effects favor the formation of short - period systems with unevolved donors . compared to the case of zero kicks",
    ", the first effect allows lmxbs with lower donor masses to form ( see fig .",
    "[ mdist ] ) , i.e.  reduces the mean donor mass and lengthens the mean nuclear - evolution time , @xmath71 .",
    "the second effect reduces the average lifetime of the detached phase as the magnetic braking strength is inversely proportional to a high power of the orbital period .",
    "hence the mean value of @xmath39 is smaller in the presence of kicks .    as the average kick magnitude increases , the fraction of short - period systems increases , while the fraction of j  driven systems with evolved donors decreases ( see fig.[r1 ] , [ r2 ] , and [ s ] ) .",
    "in fact , as @xmath72 changes from being negligible to moderate , the increase of @xmath0 is extremely steep for _ all _ models , except for the one with strong magnetic braking ( mb1a ) and low common - envelope efficiency ( @xmath73 ) .",
    "the origin of this strong dependence is related to the size of the pre ",
    "sn orbits .",
    "the combination of all the constraints imposed on the progenitors leads to such pre  sn orbital sizes that , in the absence of kicks , only wide ( n  driven ) lmxbs can be formed , while in the presence of even small kicks , systems with smaller orbits are allowed to form and the short - period fraction increases rapidly ( kw98 ) .",
    "the exception in the case of mb1a and low values of @xmath74 arises because this particular mb law is strong enough at high masses to bring a significant fraction of the population to shorter periods ( see kk97 ) .",
    "_ common  envelope efficiency .",
    "_ a decrease in the value of @xmath74 results in smaller post  ce orbital separations , therefore smaller post  sn orbits and an increase in the fraction , @xmath0 , of short - period systems ( see fig.[s ] ) .",
    "this effect on @xmath0 becomes more prominent at low kick magnitudes , where the vast majority of lmxbs form with wide orbits _ unless _",
    "@xmath74 is low .",
    "the effect of a decreasing @xmath74 on the transient fraction among j  driven systems is more complicated and depends on the strength of magnetic braking , as well . in the case of strong magnetic braking ( mb1a )",
    ", the shift of the population to shorter periods decreases the transient fraction ( fraction of systems with high values of @xmath39 ) , while in cases of weak or moderate magnetic braking the accompanying increase of the mean donor mass dominates , increasing the transient fraction accordingly ( see fig.[r1 ] ) .    _ magnetic braking .",
    "_ as already mentioned , strong magnetic braking favors the formation of short  period ( j  driven ) lmxbs .",
    "therefore , the extreme case of magnetic braking being non - operative during the semi - detached phase ( law mb3 ) always leads to a lmxb population with the highest fraction of evolved donors among j  driven systems but at the same time the lowest short - period fraction in the total population ( fig.[r1 ] and [ s ] ) .",
    "the effect of varying the magnetic braking strength is also more prominent when the other two parameters , average kick magnitude and common - envelope efficiency , are such that the majority of lmxbs form with donor masses in the range @xmath75m@xmath47 , where the differences between mb laws are more significant ( see fig.[mblaws ] ) . as a result , the cumulative distributions @xmath65 for all the mb laws ( except for the extreme mb3 ) at high common  envelope efficiencies and intermediate to high kick magnitudes are essentially indistinguishable ( fig.[r2 ] ) .",
    "in what follows , we constrain the three input parameters of our models for lmxb formation by comparing the predicted values for the fraction of short - period systems and the fraction of transients among them with observations . in order to do so",
    ", we estimate the _ actual _ short - period fraction of lmxbs and the transient fraction among these , based on the observed sample of lmxbs and the selection effects that operate on them .      in selecting the set of systems of interest to our study , we use the catalogues compiled by ritter & kolb ( 1998 ) and van  paradijs ( 1995 ) . from the sample of _ all _",
    "observed lmxbs we exclude systems that are _ not _ found in the galactic disk and systems for which there has been evidence , based on mass - function measurements , that the compact object is a black hole ( tanaka & shibazaki 1996 ) . following van  paradijs & white ( 1995 )",
    "we also exclude non - variable sources with x - ray fluxes lower than 10@xmath29jy , because their nature is uncertain .",
    "our sample consists of ( i ) 39 systems that are classified as confirmed neutron ",
    "star lmxbs because they show x - ray pulsations or type i bursts , or are z or atoll sources ( hasinger & van  der  klis 1989 for a definition ) , and ( ii ) 40 systems for which the nature of the compact object is uncertain and are considered as possible neutron stars .",
    "we expect that most of the persistently bright systems in the galaxy have already been detected ; with a typical luminosity of @xmath76ergs@xmath2 , these sources are detectable with current x - ray instruments , even if they are located at the far side of the galaxy .",
    "the situation is very different for the transient sources , for which the quiescent luminosities are very low and the bright outburst state is short - lived . in our sample , 31 systems appear to show transient behavior .",
    "any estimate of the total number of transient neutron ",
    "star lmxbs in the galactic disk is clearly very uncertain .",
    "we follow tanaka & shibazaki ( 1996 ) and assume that the number of transients is roughly equal to the product of their average detection rate and their mean recurrence time , @xmath77 , further weighted by the completeness , @xmath78 , of the transient sample relative to the persistent sources .",
    "assuming complete sky coverage over the last 30 years ( see chen , shrader , & livio 1997 ) , we estimate the detection rate to be simply equal to the number of transient systems detected over a thirty - year period divided by 30 years . the _ observed _ mean recurrence time of _ all individual outbursts _ is @xmath46yr ( chen et al .",
    "this mean value is certainly biased in favor of short recurrence times , as sources with only one recorded outburst , hence long recurrence times , are not included and systems with short recurrence time are overrepresented .",
    "given the uncertainties , we treat @xmath77 as a free parameter and obtain results for three different values of it ( 1 , 10 , and 100yr ) , although we expect @xmath79 to be longer than a few tens of years .",
    "we also treat the completeness of the transient sample relative to the persistent sources as a free parameter and investigate two cases , @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "in fact , only this relative completeness enters the observational estimate of the fraction of short - period systems and that of transients among them , @xmath0 and @xmath1 respectively , and not the assumption of 100% completeness for persistent sources .    in our sample ,",
    "the orbital period has been measured for 33 of the 79 systems , 24 of which are confirmed neutron  star lmxbs .",
    "this set of lmxbs with measured periods is certainly biased by selection effects .",
    "measurement of orbital periods of lmxbs almost always relies on the identification of the optical counterpart to the x - ray source and this is easier when the donor star is bright , i.e. , has evolved to the giant branch .",
    "therefore , we expect the majority of systems with undetermined period to have main - sequence donors and hence short orbital periods . to investigate the quantitative effect of this assumption we consider two extreme cases : ( i ) all of them being short - period and ( ii ) all of them being long - period systems .",
    "as in  3 , we use the orbital period , @xmath6 , to distinguish between j  driven ( @xmath82 ) and n  driven ( @xmath83 ) systems .",
    "lmxbs with donors less massive than @xmath60m@xmath47 do not approach the end of their main - sequence phase within the age of the galaxy , have periods below 12h , and are j  driven .",
    "systems with masses in the range @xmath84m@xmath47 ( for 1.4m@xmath47 neutron stars ) and periods longer than @xmath85h have donors that have evolved beyond the base of the giant branch and are n  driven ( see kalogera & webbink 1996 ) . in the intermediate regime , 12h @xmath8630h , both n  driven and j  driven systems can occur . as a working criterion",
    ", we use @xmath87  h , although it turns out that our results are not sensitive to this choice .    in order to use the properties of the observed sample to evaluate the models , we convert the observed numbers of systems into formation rates . for this",
    ", we have to take into account the possible difference between the lifetimes of systems in each group .",
    "based on estimates of the lifetime of lmxbs with donors on the giant branch ( following webbink , rappaport , & savonije 1983 ) , we expect that n  driven and persistent j  driven systems have comparable lifetimes .",
    "given the fact that transient j  driven systems have mean transfer rates lower than some critical value , and hence lower than those of persistent sources , their lifetimes are correspondingly longer by an uncertain factor of a few .",
    "we again treat this factor , @xmath88 , as a free parameter , and consider the cases @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "table 1 summarizes the number of observed systems in each of four different groups : transient and persistent sources among all lmxbs with confirmed or possible neutron ",

    "star accretor . based on the above discussion of selection effects acting on the observed sample , we attempt to correct the numbers given in table 1 . in table 2",
    ", we list the fractions @xmath1 and @xmath0 , calculated for the observed sample that includes all lmxbs , for the different combinations of @xmath78 , @xmath77 , and @xmath88 .",
    "the fractions are given under the assumption that known lmxbs with undetermined orbital period are short  period systems ( columns 2 and 4 for @xmath1 and @xmath0 , respectively ) or that they all are long  period systems ( columns 3 and 5 for @xmath1 and @xmath0 , respectively ) . the corresponding numbers for the subset of lmxbs with confirmed neutron  star primaries remain essentially unchanged .",
    "furthermore , we find that the inferred values of @xmath1 and @xmath0 are fairly insensitive ( typical changes of @xmath91% ) to uncertainties due to poisson noise in the observed number of systems in each group ( table 1 ) .    based on what we consider as a reasonable choice of parameters , i.e. , @xmath92  yr , @xmath93 , @xmath94 , and with the assumption that most lmxbs with unknown orbital period are short - period systems , we adopt the values @xmath95 ( at @xmath96 , see section 2 ) and @xmath97 as probable minimum requirements for the transient and the short - period fractions , respectively .      here",
    ", we discuss the consistency of the models with respect to the limits set by the observations , for three groups of the average kick magnitude ( see fig.[r1 ] , [ r2 ] , and [ s ] ) .",
    "[ [ negligible - kicks ] ] negligible kicks + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    @xmath98kms@xmath2 .",
    "all of the models result in very low values of @xmath0 , with only one exception , the case of strong mb ( mb1a ) and low @xmath74 ( 0.3 ) .",
    "for this model though , magnetic braking is strong enough to prevent the formation of a significant fraction of evolved ms donors and fails the condition @xmath99 .",
    "we have further investigated the dependence of the mb1a models on @xmath74 and found that both of the constraints on @xmath0 and @xmath1 can be satisfied _ only _ if @xmath74 is narrowly restricted at @xmath100 .",
    "we note that the magnetic braking strength assumed by the mb1a law at high stellar masses is not consistent with the rotational velocity data of f stars , if the @xmath101 dependendence is valid for all @xmath24 .",

    "on the other hand , mb3 models are the only ones that satisfy the constraint for @xmath103 .",
    "all other mb models at @xmath104 can be safely excluded , while at lower @xmath74 values the weak mb laws ( mb1b , 2a , and 2b ) could be accepted only if the critical @xmath40 is smaller than @xmath105 .",
    "[ [ intermediate - kicks ] ] intermediate kicks + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    @xmath106kms@xmath2 .",
    "all models with high @xmath74 ( close to unity ) and models without any magnetic braking ( mb3 ) at any @xmath74 can be excluded because they do not produce enough short - period systems . from the rest of the models ,",
    "only those with relatively weak magnetic braking ( mb1b , 2a , and 2b ) can produce enough j  driven systems with donors close to the end of the main sequence , and hence are acceptable .",
    "taking all the above into account , a globally consistent picture between models and observations emerges for an average kick magnitude of about @xmath107kms@xmath2 , weak magnetic braking ( mb1b , 2a , or 2b ) , and low common  envelope efficiencies ( @xmath108 ) .",
    "these models are the only ones that are comfortably in agreement with observational constraints , without the need to fine  tune model parameters .",
    "we applied the population synthesis techniques developed by kw98 to investigate the influence of varying mean supernova ",
    "kick magnitudes , orbital angular momentum loss strengths , and common envelope efficiencies on the population of transient and persistent short  period lmxbs that form via the helium star supernova channel .",
    "a main premise of our study is the identification of short  period transients with systems where the donor is significantly nuclear  evolved , close to the end of core  hydrogen burning .",
    "we tested our models against two properties inferred from the observed sample : that a significant fraction ( @xmath109 ) of nascent lmxbs are short  period , and that a significant fraction of these ( @xmath110 ) have donors close to the end of core  hydrogen burning .",
    "we found that any combination of model parameters that results in a large fraction of short - period systems with evolved donors , hence high values of @xmath1 , at the same time results in the formation of many systems with donors that have evolved beyond the main sequence , and hence leads to low values of @xmath0 .",
    "it is exactly these two counteracting effects that allow us to constrain the three model parameters . with an increasing mean kick magnitude @xmath0 grows , while @xmath1 drops .",
    "model predictions for @xmath0 and @xmath1 are consistent with observational estimates in an intermediate regime of moderate mean kick magnitudes , @xmath111  km / s , if ( i )  the orbital braking for systems with donor masses @xmath112 is weak , i.e. , much less effective than a simple extrapolation of magnetic braking beyond @xmath113 would suggest , and ( ii )  the efficiency of common envelope ejection is low ( @xmath114 ) .",
    "consistency with observational estimates could also be achieved in the absence of kicks or for a very large mean kick velocity , but _ only _ in combination with a fine - tuned common - envelope efficiency and/or fairly extreme assumptions on the efficiency of magnetic braking at masses @xmath115 ( very high for small kicks , almost negligible for large kicks ) . however , in view of the various uncertainties that enter our study we can not unambiguously rule out these models .",
    "overall , we have shown that the model predictions are sufficiently sensitive to the variation of the three input parameters to place constraints on them when comparing to observations .",
    "given accurate input from the observational sample , the constraints can be reasonably tight ( for example , had the adopted values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 been known within a factor of 2 , we could unambiguously exclude a single peak of kick magnitudes at @xmath116 or @xmath117kms@xmath2 ) .",
    "nevertheless , significant uncertainties exist that have their origin mainly in two areas : secular evolution of j  driven lmxbs and observational selection effects , which prevent us from accurately inferring the intrinsic properties of the lmxb population from the observed sample .    in the first area , a systematic study of j  driven lmxb evolution with detailed stellar models",
    "is needed to relate transient behavior quantitatively to the degree of evolution of the donor for different orbital angular momentum loss rates . this will also allow one to examine in detail the transition regime between j  driven and n  driven systems and to quantify the relative lifetimes of persistent and transient systems .",
    "the efficiency of magnetic braking affects both the lifetime of the systems and the critical degree of evolution for transient behavior .",
    "an increasing braking strength restricts transient behavior to donors closer to the end of core  hydrogen burning . at the same time",
    ", it leads to higher mass transfer rates in persistent systems , and hence shorter relative lifetimes .",
    "the first effect increases the critical degree of evolution , @xmath42 , whereas the second reduces the intrinsic transient fraction , @xmath118 , derived from the observed sample .",
    "therefore , the consistency criterion , @xmath119 , moves along a typical curve @xmath120 ( fig.[r1 ] and [ r2 ] ) , so that the choice of successful or unsuccessful models is not , to zeroth order , affected by the neglect of these dependences .",
    "we note that another long  standing problem in the evolution of lmxbs , the fate of j  driven systems once they approach to orbital periods of 3h , and the apparent lack of systems with @xmath121h ( see kk97 for a discussion ) , does not affect our study as long as any comparison is restricted to systems with periods longer than 3h .    the skumanich  type magnetic braking formulation adopted here is by no means the only possible parametrization of the orbital angular momentum losses .",
    "constraints on the real functional form could come from further analysis of stellar rotational rates in open clusters of different age .",
    "some studies ( e.g. , krishnamurthi et al . 1997 , and references therein ) suggest that @xmath7 becomes a less steep function of @xmath24 above a certain critical angular velocity .",
    "repeating our model calculations with such more general magnetic braking laws seems worthwhile only once the critical degree of evolution , @xmath40 , for transient behavior can be estimated more quantitatively .",
    "progress in the second area of uncertainty requires a systematic study of observational selection effects on x  ray binaries ( given the x - ray instruments used so far ) .",
    "this is hampered by the difficulty of calculating the spectral distribution of the emergent x  ray flux in a system with given period and transfer rate .",
    "the assessment of the relative completeness of the different subgroups involved ( black  hole , neutron  star , transient , persistent , short  period , and long  period systems ) will certainly gain reliability when future observations increase the known sample and the number of systems with determined binary and transient parameters .",
    "the completeness is further affected by a possible dependence of the transient outburst recurrence time on orbital period .",
    "giant donor systems have larger disks , which take longer to reestablish the critical pre  outburst surface density .",
    "if the recurrence time is systematically longer in long  period systems , the short  period fraction could be significantly smaller than estimated .",
    "this in turn would make models with even smaller mean kick velocities acceptable .    despite these uncertainties , the preference for moderate mean kick velocities of @xmath122  km / s inferred from our study",
    "is likely to persist even for a more detailed treatment of secular evolution and a better understanding of selection effects .",
    "this preference seems to be in conflict with the fairly large _",
    "natal kicks traditionally deduced from pulsar proper motions ( e.g. , @xmath123  km / s is favored by lorimer et al .",
    "( note that our study can not constrain the fraction of very high ( @xmath124kms@xmath2 ) kick magnitudes , because this only affects the absolute lmxb birth - rate normalization . ) while this might point to an underlying physical difference in the way supernova explosions of type ii and type ib proceed , there is also the possibility that natal pulsar velocities are significantly smaller than this estimate .",
    "indeed , it has been pointed out that a relatively wide variety of qualitatively different distributions are consistent with the observed pulsar velocity distribution ( hansen & phinney 1997 ; cordes & chernoff 1998 ; fryer et al .",
    "1998 ; hartmann 1998 ) .",
    "although our study was limited to maxwellian kick distributions we can conclude quite generally that the observed short - period transient lmxb population favors kick distributions with a dominant component at moderate mean velocities of about 100 km / s .",
    "we conclude by noting that with future progress the observational sample of lmxbs will undoubtedly increase and improve in quality , and more detailed calculations of the secular evolution of lmxbs will become available .",
    "the model calculations we have presented here , of the fraction of short - period lmxbs and the transient fraction among them , can then be used to derive even tighter constraints on the supernova and evolutionary parameters .",
