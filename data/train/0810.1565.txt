    "a celebrated result in probability theory states that in three or higher dimensional space , particles undergoing diffusion or brownian motion have a chance to escape to infinity rather than be captured to a finite adsorbing surface .",
    "this was first demonstrated in the case of random walks ( discrete versions of brownian motion ) on a @xmath0d cubic lattice , on which a walker starting at a site adjacent to the adsorbing origin escapes with probability @xmath9 or is captured with probability @xmath10 , where @xcite @xmath11 in fewer than three dimensions , walks return to the origin an infinite number of times and are thus recurrent ; while in three and higher dimensions they escape and are transient .",
    "the transient nature of random walks in @xmath0d is the basis for long - range diffusive transport and is essential for many important physical phenomena involving particles that must escape a locally trapping region .",
    "the same phenomenon in continuum theory is illustrated by the problem of adsorption of diffusing point particles on a spherical boundary of radius @xmath2 .",
    "say the particle starts initially at a distance @xmath12 from the center of a sphere .",
    "the survival probability @xmath13 up to time @xmath14 satisfies the backward diffusion equation @xmath15 with the initial condition @xmath16 for all @xmath17 and the boundary conditions @xmath18 and @xmath19 for all @xmath14 . exploiting radial symmetry ,",
    "the solution to this equation is easily found at all times @xmath14 @xmath20 taking the limit @xmath21 , one finds that the probability to ultimately escape is simply @xmath22 a well - known result in probability theory .",
    "the capture probability is @xmath23 .    in this paper , we ask how having a finite step - length in the diffusing particle s motion and discrete time - steps affects the continuum results in eqs .",
    "( [ survival],[escape ] ) .",
    "in particular , we consider a random walker in @xmath0d continuum where , in each step of equal time interval @xmath24 , the particle jumps isotropically a distance @xmath25 drawn from a distribution @xmath26 , bounded above by @xmath27 , but otherwise arbitrary .",
    "if the particle jumps inside the sphere it is captured .",
    "let @xmath28 be the probability that the particle , starting at @xmath29 , survives up to step @xmath30 .",
    "the net capture probability is then @xmath31 .",
    "the question of the net capture probability in this case is also important to many computer simulation problems , where particle diffusion is carried out by such a discrete - time process , typically through a pearson flight in which the particle at each time step jumps a discrete distance @xmath32 which may be of the order of magnitude of @xmath2 or even larger .",
    "the capture probability can be used to find chemical or catalytic reaction rates , and is also relevant to non - equilibrium growth studies , notably in diffusion - limited aggregation @xcite and related aggregation models",
    ". there has been little ( or no ) discussion on how the simulation s jump length affects the ultimate results of these simulations .",
    "another situation where a finite jump length is relevant is when particles are diffusing in a gas and the mean free path becomes comparable to the diameter of the adsorbing sphere .",
    "then the motion of the diffusing particle is not an infinitesimal wiener process described by the diffusion equation , but instead is described by the ornstein - uhlenbeck theory of brownian motion with inertial drift , integrated to position space @xcite .",
    "only after particles travel a certain distance do they  forget \" their initial direction and continue in a random direction .",
    "an approximation to this process is given by discrete random walk .     and eventually escapes .",
    "the dashed circle represents the effective capture radius @xmath33 for particles that start far from the sphere . ]    for the discrete random walk problem , we find that the survival probability @xmath28 becomes substantially modified from its continuous - time counterpart @xmath34 .",
    "we show that the ultimate survival probability @xmath35 has the following asymptotic behavior @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the mean - square jump distribution and @xmath38 is a constant ( computed explicitly below ) that depends upon the details of @xmath39 .",
    "thus if the particle starts very far from the surface of the sphere , the final survival probability has a similar expression as in the continuous - time case in eq .",
    "( [ escape ] ) , except that the effective radius of the sphere @xmath40 shrinks by a finite ` extrapolation ' length @xmath41 ( see fig . [ walkfig ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "if the particle starts right outside the surface of the sphere we find a rather surprising result : in sharp contrast to the continuous - time case , the survival probability is nonzero and moreover has a universal value @xmath42 in units of the dimensionless ratio @xmath8 , and is completely independent of the other details of the jump distribution ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "to derive these results our strategy is to first map the capture problem to the so called ` flux ' problem to a sphere and then use the known results of the latter problem .",
    "this mapping works both for continuous - time brownian motions as well as for discrete - time random walkers . for simplicity",
    "we discuss first the mapping for continuous - time brownian motions .",
    "the continuous - time flux problem , first studied by smoluchowski @xcite , is defined as follows .",
    "consider an infinite number of noninteracting brownian particles initially distributed with uniform density @xmath43 outside a sphere of radius @xmath2 in @xmath0d .",
    "each particle subsequently performs brownian motion and , if it reaches the sphere , it is absorbed .",
    "if @xmath44 denotes the density profile at time @xmath14 , the instantaneous flux to the sphere is @xmath45 .",
    "the density profile @xmath44 can be calculated easily as follows . for the uniform initial condition ,",
    "@xmath46 is only a function of the radial distance @xmath25 and it satisfies the diffusion equation @xmath47 $ ] for @xmath48 with the initial condition @xmath49 and the boundary conditions @xmath50 and @xmath51",
    ".   one can reduce this problem to a @xmath52d diffusion problem with @xmath53 satisfying @xmath54 , and @xmath55 and @xmath56 , whose solution can be easily found via the method of images .",

    "( [ survival ] ) one sees that the survival probability @xmath34 has the same expression as the density profile @xmath61 in the flux problem provided one replaces @xmath25 by @xmath1 in the latter problem .    to understand the origin of this connection between the two problems it is useful to discuss both of them simultaneously in terms of a single green s function .",
    "the green s function @xmath62 for finding the particle at position @xmath63 at time @xmath14 , starting at @xmath64 outside the sphere at @xmath65 , satisfies @xmath66 subject to the initial condition @xmath67 , and the absorbing boundary condition @xmath68 for @xmath69 .   in the flux problem ,",
    "given an arbitrary initial density @xmath70 , the density at time @xmath14 can be found from @xmath71 where the integration is over @xmath72 .   in the capture problem , the survival probability @xmath73 up to time @xmath14 , starting at @xmath74 , can also be written in terms of the same green s function , @xmath75 where the integration is over @xmath48",
    ".   for uniform and isotropic initial density @xmath43 in the flux problem one gets from eq .",
    "( [ green ] ) @xmath76 since the green s function @xmath77 is symmetric in @xmath63 and @xmath64 for unbiased brownian motion , it follows by comparing eqs .",
    "( [ eqr0 ] ) and ( [ eqr ] ) the equality @xmath78 this leads to the quite general result that the probability @xmath79 a particle at position @xmath80 survives up to time @xmath14 can be found directly by solving the density profile in the corresponding flux problem starting from an initial uniform density .",
    "( [ seqrho ] ) just says that the net probability a walker starting at point @xmath1 survives up to time @xmath14 is the same as the sum of the probabilities that particles starting at every point in space reach @xmath1 in time @xmath14 without being adsorbed .",
    "we note that the same general argument goes through even for discrete - time random walks , leading to the relation @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is the density profile at step @xmath30 of the corresponding discrete - time flux problem .",
    "this equivalence is also discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "thus we can use many of the discrete - time flux - problem results from refs .",
    "@xcite to study the present capture problem .",

    "[ walkfig ] .",
    "because of radial symmetry , this problem can be formulated as a one - dimensional problem , exactly analogous to the case of radial diffusion discussed above , with effective density @xmath89 and an effective jump probability given by the symmetric , non - negative function @xmath90 which is also normalized to unity , @xmath91 .",

    "finally , relation between the @xmath0d flux and @xmath52d random - walk problems was shown in @xcite .",
    "for the pearson flight , we can find @xmath161 to higher order numerically @xmath162 , and in this case we confirm that eq .",

    "notice that the value of @xmath38 is just a little larger than that of the pearson walk .",
    "in deriving these results , we assumed that adsorption occurs only if the final position of the particle falls within the sphere  thus trajectories that pass through or graze the sphere are assumed not to adsorb . including these events",

    "physically , of course , such trajectories should be adsorbed , so in that case our results are only accurate for @xmath177",

    "interestingly , @xmath192 also appears in the problem of adsorption of a particle ( in @xmath52d ) diffusing by the ornstein - uhlenbeck process@xcite , where it is also related to the boundary extrapolation length , as well as in in the context of the maximum of a rouse polymer chain  @xcite or gaussian random walks  @xcite .",
    "thus , we have shown that the discreteness of the time always affects the ultimate capture probability of a particle undergoing a random walk .",
    "even if the walk length were drawn from a proper gaussian distribution appropriate for brownian motion representing the time interval @xmath24 , the capture probability would not be the same as the solution for the diffusion equation , because of the ability of the discrete walk to jump away from the surface .",
    "different distributions change the constants @xmath5 and @xmath151 , but the general behavior remains the same .",
    "this work implies that , when doing computer simulations involving capture on a sphere , in order to get a capture probability that is say 99% correct , one should make @xmath6 less than @xmath193 , or in the case of the pearson flight , make @xmath32 less than @xmath194 by eq .",
